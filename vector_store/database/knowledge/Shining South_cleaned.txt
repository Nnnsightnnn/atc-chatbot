The lands of the South each have their own unique char-

acter. Dambrath is a nation with two histories, one of human

barbarians and another of half-drow conquerors. It is known for

aggression and horse breeding. To the west sits mighty Halruaa,

a nation where everything is done with magical assistance, and

items of power are created and put to use unlike anywhere else

in the whole of Faern. The wizards try to keep their eldritch

practices a secret, but hints of their capabilities have slipped

beyond their borders nonetheless. North of Halruaa sits the

western end of great grasslands known as the Shaar, which runs

all the way east to the Giants Belt Mountains, the very edge

of the world by some folks reckoning. Fierce nomadic tribes

of humans, wemics, loxos, thri-kreen, and others wander the

plains, chasing the herds and ghting for territory, water, and

sacred lands. Right in the middle of the Shaar is the Great

Rift, homeland of the gold dwarves. Halings, too, have their

own nation in the South. The hin, as they prefer to be called,

live quietly in Luiren, enjoying the serenity of its pastures and

woodlands. Finally, just to the east of the haling home sits

the Shining Lands, a place of commerce and faith. The people

of this place revere trade and wealth above all else, but couple

that reverence with honesty and open minds.

What You Need to  Play

This sourcebook assumes that you own the three core rulebooks

of the Dungeons & Dragons game: the Players Handbook, the

Dungeon Masters Guide, and the Monster Manual. In addition,

material in this book frequently refers to the Forgotten Realms

Campaign Setting and Players Guide to Faern.

We also recommend Monster Compendium: Monsters of

Faern and Races of Faern. A number of the creatures men-

tioned in this sourcebook (primarily in the random encounter

tables) can be found in those resources.

I n other parts of Faern, travelers speak of the wonders

they have seen in the Shining South. Tales and songs

tell of lands scorched by heat, people ruled by drow,

traders who could negotiate the name away from an Amnian,

and wizards who use magic for tasks mundane to miraculous.

The Shining South is a vast place with perhaps the broadest

variety of cultures anywhere. Halings call part of the region

home, while in another area half-drow rule and deem others

outsiders. The most prominent dwarven abode sits squarely in

the South, within the Great Rift, a carved canyon that has

belonged to the dwarves for untold centuries. The Shining

South is a place of ancient magic kept alive and practiced with

casualness that would make the barbarians of the Silver Marches

howl in consternation.

Folk from many other parts of the world came to settle the

South, so people here can trace their cultures back to powers that

rose and fell in distant times, including Netheril and Imaskar.

Peoples such as the distant Nars and Illuskans managed to nd

their way to the shores of the Faerns southern coast. All these

and more have given rise to tribesmen on the plains of the Shaar,

traders in Durpar, and reclusive wizards of Halruaa.

At its most basic denition, the Shining South is an area

encompassing the lands between the Chultan Peninsula and the

blasted deserts of the ancient Imaskari region, and from the Great

Sea all the way to the fringes of Chondalwood and the ancient

nations of Unther and Mulhorand. Over 1.1 million square

miles could be considered part of the South, divided between six

principal localesDambrath, the Great Rift, Halruaa, Luiren, the

Shaar, and the Shining Lands (Durpar, Estagund, Var the Golden,

and Veldorn). Amid these major regions, dozens of independent

cities and strongholds sit among a web of trade routes.

4

L ike many other corners of Faern, the diversity

of the Shining South is enormous, with represen-

tatives of every major race present. Some ways

of life might be unique to a particular group in this region,

but humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halings are much

the same here as elsewhere. In addition to these races, a few

species, such as the wemic, are unique to the Shining South,

including two that are fully detailed in this book: the loxo and

the thri-kreen.

Characters who hail from the Shining South can choose from

several new regions described later in this chapter. The chapter

concludes with a selection of new feats and regional feats.

Of the major races in the South, humans are the most preva-

lent. A number of dierent human ethnicities populated the

southern coast of the continent in the early days, most of them

roaming the land rstasbarbaricnomadsandonlylatersettling

down and taking up the practices of farming, craftsmanship, and

trade. Among those, the Arkaiuns, the Durpari, the Halruaans,

and the Shaarans are the most dominant.

Besides humans, gold dwarves and halings are numerous

here due to the presence of their native homelands. The gold

dwarves call the Great Rift home and have spread from there to

the various mountain ranges throughout the South, especially

since Moradins Thunder Blessing. They mine for precious metals

and gems in both the Curna and Toadsquat ranges, among others.

The halings hail from the land of Luiren, where humans are

few and far between. Halings have also migrated into other

regions, particularly the Hills of the Dead Kings and various

urban centers along the coast of the Golden Water.

Elves and half-elves are a rarity in most parts of the South,

for few forests here once served as their traditional homes. Minor

communities of wild elves populate the Forest of Amtar, while a

similar, if more vicious, lot of the green elves inhabit the Misty

Vale. Enclaves of elves and half-elves can be found in several

human cities, but they are small and have no real presence. The

marked exceptions to this paucity are the drow beneath the

Gnollwatch Mountains and the half-drow Crinti who rule the

land of Dambrath on their behalf. The natural order has been

turned upside down in that nation, for half-drow reign supreme,

while humans kneel at their feet.

Gnomes and planetouched are uncommon in the Shining South.

A sizable gathering of gnomes serve as master gemcutters in the

city of Ormp in Durpar, while another group defends the western

end of the Rathgaunt Hills in the Shaar. Other small, isolated

clans live deep in the hills, but the only gnomes usually spotted in

the open are those who hail from other lands. A few planetouched

linger in and around the Shining Lands, a reminder of the days

when demons ruled some of the cities along the Golden Water,

in the Land of Monsters known as Veldorn. Their ospring still

call the more cosmopolitan urban centers home, and few do more

than look twice at the outsiders in their midst, so long as those

outsiders have coin to spend like everyone else.

A few half-orcs and other humanoids serve as hired swords

or bodyguards for less particular folk. They are more welcome in

Dambrath than anywhere else in the South, because the Crinti

employ unsavory soldiers of all sorts. The lizardfolk of Rethild

are said to oermercenaryservicefromtheirswamphome,and

a variety of humanoids roam the open plains of the Shaar.

Human, Arkaiun

Regions: Dambrath, The Golden Water, Halruaa, The Shaar.

Racial Feats: Knife Fighter, Resist Poison, Saddleback

Arkaiuns are a relatively new ethnicity among humans, a blend of

other cultures that have been forced to eeorsubmittoothersfor

most of their existence. Today, they are scattered throughout the

southern coast of Faern, though Dambrath is their traditional

home. Arkaiuns are generally short and stocky, with dusky skin

and dark brown to black hair.

Races and Regions

History

The Arkaiuns who came to the grass-covered plains of the region

now known as Dambrath originally hailed from Shandaular, the

capital of the kingdom of Ashanath far to the north. Shandaular

was actually two separate parts of the same city, each built around

one of the termini of a two-way portal connecting the Council

Hills region and the western shore of Lake Ashane. When the

nentyarch of Tharos attempted to destroy Shandaular during

his conquest of Ashanath in 946 DR, the citizens ed through

their portal to the southern half of the city, leaving behind their

king, Arkaius the Archmage, to close the portal and destroy

it. The Nar people took the name of the fallen king, calling

themselves the Arkaiuns, and continued to live in the shadow of

the quiet portal arch for several more centuries. Though their

identity remained intact, the glory of the people of Shandaular

waned to a shadow of its former self. Eventually, the Arkaiuns

were little more than numerous tribes of nomads who considered

their former city a meeting place.

In the century leading up to Dale Reckoning, a second ethnic-

ity of humans arrived through the same portal terminus, albeit

from a dierent region of Faern. These were a lost tribe of

Illuskans, having vanished from their homeland of Rauthym

during that nations expansive years. The Illuskans settled among

the Nar-Arkaiuns and interbred, and eventually, the two groups

became one. The mixed Arkaiuns continued to dwell in the

Council Hills region for a couple more centuries, forming the

kingdom of Eltabranar during that time.

After an ill-advised invasion of Unther and Mulhorand ended

disastrously, the Arkaiuns edsouthandwest,eventuallysettling

along the coast of the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. There, they

began to farm the land and founded trading centers, remaining

a presence in the region for a number of centuries.

Early in the ninth century DR, the Arkaiuns accidentally broke

through into the Underdark and encountered the drow for the rst

time. Foolishly, their king ordered an army to march down into

the depths of the mountains and conquer the drow city. It was

a disaster of record

proportionsthe

tables were

turned within half a century, and the Arkaiuns were the ones facing

subjugation. The nalstrawcameintheformofbetrayalatthe

hands of a group of priestesses of Loviatar. Dambrath belonged

to the drow, and the Arkaiuns became their servant race.

Outlook

Few Arkaiuns identify themselves on a nationalistic level any

longer. They have long been an oppressed people, held under the

thumb of half-drow and drow in what was once their homeland

of Dambrath. Those who migrated to other regions before the

coming of the Crinti have stayed there, and others have managed

to slip away at opportune moments.

Arkaiun Characters

Arkaiuns do well as ghters,rogues,andrangers,sincetherole

they play in Dambrathan society is one of manual labor and

struggle. In urban areas, they are house guards, sailors, and

thieves, while they function as warriors and ranch hands in

the countryside. Some outlaws might be barbarians, still trying

to preserve a nomadic lifestyle and ready to ee the Crinti at

a moments notice. Few Arkaiuns become spellcasters of any

sort, particularly in Dambrath itself, where practice of magic is

forbidden to Arkaiuns, and religion is enforced.

Prestige Classes: Arkaiuns are inclined toward physical

prestige classes, such as the assassin, duelist, Great Sea corsair,

horizon walker, and guild thief, rather than those of a spiritual

or arcane nature.

Arkaiun Society

Crinti rule overshadows Arkaiun society.

and service in the military. Outside that nation, Arkaiuns simply

blend in with the habits of those around them.

Some Arkaiuns live in the wilds beyond the immediate control

of the Crinti and still uphold their traditional ways, insisting on

observing the nomadic lifestyle and ceremonies they maintained

before the coming of the drow. In these cases, Arkaiuns are a

savage people, as is evidenced in their occasional veneration of

Malar as the master of the hunt.

Language and Literacy

Arkaiuns who live in Dambrath speak Common and Dambrathan.

This latter tongue is a combination of Old Illusk and ancient

Nar, neither of which are spoken today. It employs the Dethek

alphabet. Ordinary second languages include Illuskan, Halruaan,

Shaaran, and Undercommon. Only 30% of the Arkaiuns living

in Dambrath are literate.

Arkaiun Magic and Lore

Arkaiuns are unused to using magic, since their Crinti rulers do

not allow them to learn spellcasting. Of the magic with which

they are familiar, armor and weapons bearing minor powers are

most common.

Spells and Spellcasting

The Arkaiuns who have taken up the mantle of spellcaster have

to another culture to learn

almost universally adapted

those  ways.  Among

Arkaiuns whose culture is

barbarian peoples living on

still intact (primarily

society,

the fringes of Crinti

often as utter outlaws), a few adepts, bards, druids, and rangers

have managed to develop some magical prowess. These individuals

are rare, however.

Spellcasting Tradition: Since spellcasting among Crinti-ruled

Arkaiuns is forbidden, the people have no discernible spellcasting

tradition.

Unique Spells: None.

Arkaiun Magic Items

Since few Arkaiuns are aorded the opportunity to engage in

spellcasting, they have neither the knowledge nor the means to

manufacture magic items.

Common Magic Items: None.

Arkaiun Deities

In Dambrath itself, Arkaiuns are forcibly devoted to Loviatar and

sometimes Lolth. Left to their own devices, most honor Tempus,

though a few more savage folk (particularly the barbarians that

roam the fringes of Dambrath, ghting to remain free of Crinti

inuence) venerate Malar for his hunting portfolio. In other

lands, the Arkaiuns have adapted to the beliefs of the locals, so

they honor a wide variety of deities.

Relations with Other Races

Obviously, most Dambrathan Arkaiuns view the half-drow and

the drow who rule their land with stiedloathing.Thisabhorrence

carries over to most other elves and half-elves (chiey because

the half-drow have reinforced such notions). Arkaiuns get along

well enough with dwarves and gnomes, but their relationship with

Races and Regions

halings is strained due to several invasion attempts on Luiren

(both before the arrival of the drow and at the behest of that

race). Arkaiuns coexist surprisingly well with half-orcs, since

a large number of them live in Dambrath, serving in martial

capacities alongside humans.

More than a few Arkaiuns have migrated (or ed) to nearby

human nations, so they have been accepted openly in the region

around the Golden Water and integrated well with the Durpari

people there. On the other side, Halruaans view Arkaiuns with

suspicion due to a bad history between the two countries.

Arkaiun Equipment

Arkaiuns have access to every type of equipment available in the

Players Handbook, due to the extensive trade that takes place all

along the southern coast of Faern, Dambrath included.

Arms and Armor

Arkaiuns employ many weapons but prefer ranged weapons when

in the open grasslands. Favored arms include crossbows, slings,

and javelins for ranged combat, and short swords, daggers, and

rapiers for melee. The heat of the South means breastplates,

leather, and studded leather are the most common armors, along

with bucklers or small shields.

Common Items: Breastplate, leather armor, buckler, javelin,

short sword, light crossbow.

Animals and Pets

Arkaiuns have always been superior riders, and the horses that

run on the elds of Dambrath are major assets to that nation.

The humans bred and rode the animals long before the coming

of the drow and half-drow, and they continue to do so today. As

a result, almost every Arkaiun learns to ride a horse by the time

he is ve years old.

Durpari have clustered around the Golden Water, the great bay of

their homelands in the far southeastern section of Faern, for many

centuries. Through hard work and dedication to a few simple yet

profound ideals, the Durpari have turned themselves into a culture

of astute traders and kind, welcoming people. Their predilection

for commerce has allowed them to spread all along the southern

coast of the continent and northward into other lands.

History

The Durpari tribes originated as subjugated barbarians to the great

Imaskari Empire of millennia ago. When that nation fell into

ruin, the Durpari quickly lost what civilizing inuencestheyhad

acquired. Reverting to the lifestyle of simple nomads, the ancient

Durpari roamed the coastline along the Golden Water. For over

two thousand years, the Mulan of Mulhorand preyed on southern

tribes, wiping out entire clans in ferocious wars all across the plains

that now comprise the eastern Shaar and lands southward.

Eventually, the Durpari tribesfolk began to settle down, estab-

lishing trading communities where they would be sheltered, fresh

water was available, and boats could be pulled ashore. Though the

tribes still squabbled, they were learning how to defend themselves

against the depredations of the Mulan to the north and the

Ulgarth to the east.

The trade centers grew, and the tribes began farming in

earnest, nding the land good for growing grains and other

produce for which tribes farther along the coast were eager to

deal. Over time, the Durpari became so skilled at trading they

knew no rivals. Ships from all over the sea found their way into

the waters of the bay to do business with the folk.

Somewhere along the way, the Durpari found religion. A

simple merchant began preaching of the Adama, both a belief

system and a code of conduct. To the Durpari, the Adama is the

one true force guiding their lives, and all deities in Faern are

considered a part of it.

Outlook

The Durpari people are warm and friendly, almost to a fault,

but this graciousness doesnt hamper their sharp trading skills.

They are hard workers as well, driven by their love of commerce

and the belief that all things are possible with dedication and

goodwill. This open-minded outlook makes the Durpari natural

explorers, undeterred by the odd and extraordinary.

The Adama teaches that only through honest business prac-

tices and mutual respect can one ndpeaceandhappiness.The

Durpari people get their strong senses of truth, fairness, and racial

tolerance from the conviction that everything and everyone is

a manifestation of the Adama. These principles have, in turn,

garnered the Durpari a reputation for evenhandedness and made

them more welcome in other lands.

Durpari Characters

Durpari characters are diverse, for they ndmanytypesofskills

and abilities useful. They make good sorcerers and wizardses-

pecially abjurers, diviners, and illusionists, who are functional

in protecting goods, determining the value of magic items, and

enhancing business negotiations. People of the Golden Water

region also have a strong divine inspiration, and many join the

clergy or serve as paladins on behalf of the Adama. Some become

bards to better entertain guests or sustain their travels, monks

due to their proximity to eastern lands, or ghters and rangers

if they spend a great deal of time on the Veldorn frontier. Few

Durpari are thieves, because their society teaches so vehemently

against such crimes, and almost no barbarians reside among the

people now, despite their history.

Prestige Classes: Durpari ndthemostvalueininformation

gathering and the protection of their livelihoods. They gravitate

toward the eldritch knight, Great Sea corsair, hand of the Adama,

hierophant, loremaster, Maquar crusader, and mystic theurge

prestige classes.

Races and Regions

Durpari Society

For most Durpari, the business of their culture is business itself,

and their communities reectthis.Achaka,ormerchanthouse,

is the most recognized social unit among the people. Everyone is

judged by how well they do for themselves, rather than who their

ancestors were. Life in the settlements is lled with the noise

of the marketplace, where everyone works to turn the highest

prots while maintaining personal integrity.

Durpari value freedom. Their laws put much trust in the

virtues taught by the Adama, allowing the people to pursue their

goals unfettered by many commercial regulations. Despite this

lax bureaucracy, the Durpari are not easy on criminals. They do,

however, believe in redemption.

Durpari society is open to all, regardless of culture or heritage,

with the obvious exception of wicked organizations and the fol-

lowers of evil or destructive deities. Many races and cultures live

and work alongside Durpari without fear of bigotry or oppression.

Unless someone shows he cannot live without hurting others, his

only judges are the consumers, who vote with their coin.

Language and Literacy

The people of the Golden Water region of Faern speak Durpari,

derived from elements of Draconic, Mulhorandi, and Rauric. It

employs the Thorass alphabet, which was brought east during the

earliest days of trading. Almost every Durpari has some level of

literacy, since their businesses often depend on them being able

to read and write.

Durpari Magic and Lore

Magic is a useful tool in Durpari dealings, and the people are

at ease around both arcane and divine spells and items. Many

Durpari employ sorcerers and wizards as part of their operations.

Of course, the prevalence of faith in the Adama means the clergy

of that devotion are a strong presence among the Durpari.

Spells and Spellcasting

Durpari who study arcane spellcasting prefer divination and illu-

sion magic when dealing with potential business partners, while

spellcasters of any focus are useful on the caravan trail.

Spellcasting Tradition: To facilitate potential customers, Dur-

pari merchants might employ illusions to create a comfortable

atmosphere for foreign clients. They also favor divination, which

aids in predicting everything from the future price of goods to

the best shipping routes to avoid storms and hazards.

Unique Spells: Few spells are associated with Durpari

wizards because of the mercantile focus of their culture. They

have managed to obtain their magic the way they acquire other

goodsthrough shrewd bargaining in distant lands.

Durpari Magic Items

Durpari folk prefer magic items that reveal information, protect

caravans, and make life a little more comfortable at home.

Durpari Deities

The Durpari people have a highly developed belief system that is

part code of conduct and part pantheon. Known as the Adama,

which means the One, this system preaches both broadminded-

ness and proper behavior in all that the Durpari do. Everything

in the world and beyond is a part of the Adama. Because of its

all-encompassing nature, the Adama incorporates all the deities

of Faern, and thus all are accepted (to one degree or another)

in Durpari society.

Strictly speaking, the deities most revered are Zionil (Gond),

Curna (Oghma), Lucha (Selne), Torm, and Waukeen. These

vedeitiesbestexemplifythespiritandcorevaluesofthefaith,

which teaches all to work hard, deal fairly, and prevent no other

from doing the same. Worship of the Adama is more a matter of

everyday behavior than ceremony and ritual. By treating others

justly, one honors the Adama. For all practical purposes, the code

has the same tenets as the faiths venerating the ve Faernian

deities mentioned above.

Relations with Other Races

The Durpari comprise one of the most accepting cultures in

Faern. They have learned that to excel at trade, they must be

willing to deal with all types of people.

Durpari Equipment

The Durpari, being master traders, have access to every conceiv-

able item from any land. As a result, the contents of the Players

Handbook equipment lists are considered commonly available in

Durpari lands.

Arms and Armor

The Durpari culture has adopted a blend of Mulhorandi and

Utter Eastern arms and armor preferences. Kukris, falchions, and

scimitars are most prevalent as melee weapons, while crossbows

and shortbows are favored for ranged attacks. The hot climate of

the Durpari homelands means that the people prefer light armor

for protection. The majority of combatants wear leather, studded

leather, or breastplates, along with light shields.

Common Items: All weapons and armor are available in

Durpari nations.

Animals and Pets

The Durpari are not fond of any one type of creature over any

others, though a wide variety of species can be found in the public

areas, shops, and homes of the wealthy. Such fauna come from

many regions, brought back by merchants interested in selling

unusual specimens to those who delight in showing ounique

pets. Animals that fare particularly well in Durpars hot climate

include lizards, snakes, and other reptiles, as well as colorful birds

and exotic creatures from nearby jungles and rivers.

Racial Feats: Arcane Schooling, Magical Training, Spellwise

History

Halruaans are the descendants of two cultural groups. Their

original ethnicity comes from the Lapal (forebears of the

Tashalans), a people who edtothisregionafterescapingtheir

yuan-ti masters in the jungles near the Lapal Sea. More than

three millennia ago, these escaped slaves settled a sheltered valley

region that sat along the southern coast of Faern, surrounded on

three sides by high mountains and the Great Sea on the fourth.

They established an uncomplicated life of farming, animal herd-

ing, and shing. The Lapal had few cities and many monster

problems, but their existence was secluded and undisturbed for

over a thousand years.

When the empire of Netheril was shattered by the folly of

Karsus and the magic of the phaerimm, a number of wizards,

along with their families, servants, and extended clans, ed

the northland, led by the archmage Raumark. They traveled

southward by way of skyships, looking for a place where they

could both hide from the phaerimm and settle into a life of

magic once more. Eventually, they came upon a broad valley

set between three mountain ranges that even their skyships had

dicultytraversing.TheretheyfoundthesimpleLapalpeople,

still farming and shing.

Within three generations, the two groups had merged into

one culture. The Netherese taught the ways of magic, and the

Lapal oered the secrets of using the lands resources. In the

centuries since then, the Halruaans have enjoyed a good life while

preparing for invasion from elsewhere, always expecting either

the phaerimm or other jealous nations to come and try to take

their magic away.

At one point late in the second century DR, a small faction

of Leira worshipers broke from the wizards of Halruaa and

relocated to the island of Nimbral. Though they are Halruaan

by blood, they are a distinct culture separated from their kin by

many miles of ocean.

Outlook

Halruaans are a happy people who treat one another with exag-

gerated niceties, though they are suspicious of outsiders and always

suspect strangers of trying to appropriate their magical secrets.

They enjoy the fruits of their labors well, for the quality of life

in a land lledwithwizardsishigh.Eventhebasestofcommon-

ers might be able to perform a few simple spells. Likewise, with

magic so common in the culture, most people have managed to

acquire at least one or two magic items.

Few Halruaans develop wanderlust. Of those that do venture

beyond the mountains that shelter their home, most are simply

on a quest for new and unusual spell components or devices they

have never seen before. Ironically, Halruaans are loath to give

up their own magical mysteries, but they dont think twice about

acquiring the arcane lore of others.

Halruaan Characters

Although it is not strictly true that more Halruaan wizards roam

Faern than those from any other landthe Red Wizards might

beg to dieritisacceptedthatthemajorityofHalruaanswho

leave home are blessed with arcane power. Most are wizards,

although a few are bards. Halruaan sorcerers are probably more

common outside the country than within, as the rest of Halruaan

society distrusts sorcerous magic and considers sorcerers danger-

ous, tainted individuals. Few Halruaans are barbarians, druids,

monks, paladins, or rogues. Some take up the mantle of divine

devotion, almost exclusively to one of the two deities of magic,

Mystra or Azuth. Savras and Velsharoon have small followings

subservient to the church of Azuth. Other faiths are overtly

discouraged or expunged, but rumors persist of a cult of Shar

(and her Shadow Weave).

Prestige Classes: Because of their focus on wizardry, any of the

prestige classes that seem to be a natural extension of arcane magic

are favored by Halruaans. Arcane devotees, archmages, eldritch

knights, Halruaan elders, Halruaan magehounds, loremasters,

and mystic theurges are all attractive choices. If any Halruaan

wizards have secretly turned to the Shadow Weave, a few might

have become shadow adepts.

Halruaan Society

Halruaans make a point of elevating those accomplished in the

arcane arts. Its a fact of their society that masterful wizardry

is the ultimate goal in life. That is not to say that they scorn or

abuse those who cannot wield magic. On the contrary, the lowly

cook who must light a rewithintandsteelservesanimportant

functioneven the high evoker needs a full belly to practice his

magic. Still, the haves and the have-nots are clearly delineated

in Halruaa, though no discriminatory laws against magic-bereft

individuals exist in the nation.

Appearance is everything among Halruaans, the ashierthe

better. Folk measure one another by their dress, responsibilities,

and transportation, impressed all the more if magic is a part

of all three. Halruaans prefer to dress in bright colors, lavishly

adorn themselves with trinkets and magical eects,andridein

luxurious vehicles. Conveyances are often magic items, such as a

skyship or carpet of ying.

In the countryside, amboyant ways are not so important,

but the use and display of magic still is. Rural folk value the

practical application of magic more than magic for its own sake.

A spell or item that can harvest the crop or herd the sheep more

eciently is esteemed more than ashy wizardry.

The Halruaan government is also set up around the inuence

of magic. The netyarch, or wizard-king, of Halruaa is generally

accepted to be the single most powerful magic-wielding individual

in the entire nation, culled from an elite group of wizards called

the Council of Elders. It is the wizard-king, with advice and as-

sistance from the elders, who determines the policies of the land.

A netyarch certainly recognizes the value of evaluating decisions

10

Races and Regions

from every angle, but everyone understands that decrees handed

down favor those with the gift of the Art.

Language and Literacy

Halruaans almost universally speak Halruaan, which is simply a

modern dialect of ancient Netherese. They employ the Draconic

alphabet in their writings. Of course, no self-respecting Halruaan

wizard limits herself to a single language. Many go out of their

way to master half a dozen or so tongues, many of them ancient

and/or dead, to aid in magical research. The lowliest wizards learn

at least one or two other languages, if for no other reason than

to better facilitate trade with nearby nations.

A land of wizards is also a land of literacy. Those who cannot

invoke arcane energy still learn to read and write at an early age.

The Halruuans have two reasons for this basic education. The

rst is to uncover those Halruaan children who have a spark of

magic in them, which is accomplished through a series of tests.

Part of the preparation for these tests is learning to read and

write. Additionally, a developed intellect is prized in Halruaa, as

the nations public school system, which all youngsters attend,

shows. Literacy is quintessential to this point of personal pride.

Halruaan Magic and Lore

Halruaa is magic, and magic is Halruaa. As descendants of the

Netherese, who were perhaps the greatest wizards in the history

of Faern, Halruaans have the strongest magical tradition of

any aliveperhaps more deeply rooted than that of Thay. Every

kind of magic imaginable has been researched, perfected, and built

on by Halruaan wizards. Divine magic is not as highly regarded

in Halruaan society, but clerics of Faerns deities of magic are

common enough.

Spells and Spellcasting

While countless wizards of every school have dominated the

landscape of Halruaa throughout its past, the diviner is now

the slight favorite. Knowledge is power, thus great knowledge

is great power, is a common saying in Halruaan social circles.

Divination is the key to hidden information.

Spellcasting Tradition: In Halruaa, wizardry of every sort is

accepted, and the more the better. Other forms of arcane magic

are considered less important or unsafe. Divine spells tend to

focus on divination and protection, to both learn about and guard

arcane secrets and magic items.

Unique Spells: Far too many useful and wondrous spells come

from Halruaa to mention here. The vast majority of new spells

in this book account for but a fraction of the magic distributed

from Halruaa throughout the centuries.

Halruaan Magic Items

As with spells, magic items are so widely created and used through-

out all facets of Halruaan culture that it would be impossible to

eectively list them here. The majority of new items described

in Chapter 4 of this book, as well as countless items from other

sources, originated in Halruaa.

Halruaan Deities

Early in Halruaan history, the people likely followed a broader

pantheon derived from their previous culturesthe Lapal the

divinities of the jungle and yuan-ti, and the Netherese their own

deities. These eventually gave way to the current divine beings

worshiped in the land of wizards.

The vast majority of Halruaans venerate Mystra, the deity

of magic. They see service to her as benecial to their way of

life, and prayers asking for protection of the Weave are a daily

ritual. In fact, it is likely that the Netherese who became the

Halruaans recognized the change in the divinity of magic shortly

after the destruction of Mystryl. Perhaps they felt in some way

obligated to curry the new deitys favor in the hopes that nothing

so disastrous would befall them (such as pursuit by the phaerimm).

That Mystra heard and answered those ancient supplications

secured the utter loyalty of mainstream Halruaa to this day.

Eventually, some Halruaans began to migrate toward the

worship of Savras and Azuth, recognizing a tighter focus to their

own interests in their tenets. While both churches were initially

scorned, shunned, and relegated to the fringes of society, each

saw in the other a long-term rival. Eventually, worship of the

All-Seeing Eye all but vanished, and the Church of Azuth became

widely accepted. Today one in six Halruaans worship Azuth.

Sects dedicated to Savras and Velsharoon also exist in Halruaa,

controlled by the church of Azuth, much as these lesser deities

owe fealty to the Lord of Spells. Those who follow the All Seeing

have gained prominence of late, due to the popularity of divina-

tion and the reemergence of the chuch of Savras across Faerun,

albeit subservient to the church of Azuth. Savrass sect maintains

impartiality, serving all who can barter for foresight. Research-

ers into death and undeath are allowed to plumb the mysteries

Velsharoon oers, but such studies are strictly monitored and

regulated by the clergy of The High One.

Another group of wizards, illusionists loyal to Leira, chose to

leave the shores of Halruaa, rather than take up the same ght

into which the followers of Azuth had been forced. These servants

of the Mother of Illusionists journeyed to the distant island of

Nimbral, where they remain today. Since the Time of Troubles,

the inhabitants of Nimbral have not openly acknowledged the

death of Leira, although most privately suspect or admit she

is truly gone. Ironically, the traditionalists receive their spells

from Cyric, who is anything but. The churches of Akadi, Azuth,

Mystra, Savras, and Shar have all gained adherents as Visages

in the Mist, but none has yet been embraced as Leira reborn.

Though it is spoken of only in whispers, and evidence of it is

rarely seen, a cult of Shar is gaining ground in Halruaa. Wizards

of every level of power, from rural peasant magicians to powerful

elders, have secretly turned to the Shadow Weave.

Relations with Other Races

Halruaans are a private lot, not prone to mingling with others.

This keeps with their suspicious natures and belief that non-

Halruaans are interested only in illicitly acquiring Halruaan

magic. The wizards understand that they cannot exist in total

isolationinteraction with other cultures is required for trade.

11

Races and Regions

So, merchants can visit coastal cities. Durpari tradesmen enjoy

highest favor, because they are adept at acquiring unusual material

components and delivering them to Halruaas shores.

Enough elves and half-elves have established a solid reputa-

tion among the elite of Halruaaseveral of them serve on the

Council of Eldersthat Halruaans have grown more indier-

ent to them than in the past. Dwarves are welcomed, provided

they make themselves useful through their crafts. Halings

are only barely tolerated within the borders of Halruaa, for

the wary citizenry see every haling as a potential spy or thief.

Halruaans know widely of gnomes only due to the intrusions

of a nasty group of gnome werebeasts in the north. The oc-

casional gnome that comes to assist dwarves in their work is

grudgingly accepted.

Halruaans openly dislike half-drow, and the hostile nature of

the Crinti to the east is an easy testament to why. On the other

side of the country, yuan-ti occasionally become a nuisance. In

both cases, the wizards have been able to handle the threat.

Halruaan Equipment

Halruaans are wealthy, as a rule, and they can aord to import

whatever clothing is in fashion at the moment. They prefer cool,

loose-ttingouttsbecauseofthehotclimate.ManyHalruaan

wizards stubbornly cling to traditional robes, nding magical

means of adequate cooling.

Arms and Armor

Because of the cultural blend from the formative days when the

Lapal and Netherese came together, and because of their ability

to craft just about anything magical, the Halruaan combatant

has access to a wide variety of styles. Still, lighter armor is usually

preferred to heavier gear unless some magic is available to keep

the wearer from overheating.

Common Items: All arms and equipment are available in

Halruaan cities.

Animals and Pets

Halruaans are fond of unusual creatures, and they take great

pains to show o their lifestyle and wealth through the display

of remarkable pets. In particular, Halruaan behirs and beguilers

are popular, but any number of strange animals from every

conceivable land might be acquired by the extremely wealthy.

Human, Shaaryan

Regions: Dambrath, The Golden Water, Halruaa, Lapaliiya,

Mulhorand, The Shaar, Unther.

Racial Feats: Fleet of Foot, Horse Nomad, Survivor

History

The history of the nomadic tribes of the Shaar region is old and

unwavering. Clans of people have wandered the plains for as long

as history recalls, and the lifestyle of these nomads has changed

little in that time. Though other cultures have periodically at-

tempted to assimilate the Shaarans, the tribesfolk have resisted

such eorts.Thetruthis,thesepeoplesurvivetheonlywaythey

can, and they would rather die than be transplanted.

The single biggest incursion into the Shaar came from the

Shoon, but that did not last either. In the fth century DR,

Shaarans rebelled against their Shoon masters. Despite bloody

reprisals, the Imperium was forced to withdraw from the region,

and the nomads quietly returned to their previous way of life.

Outlook

Shaarans have a simple view on life that places little value on

the long term. The most critical decisions are those revolving

around survival, and to do that, the tribes must follow the herds.

Everything else is secondary, and this intrinsic understanding

of the laws of the plains is what helps the typical Shaaran

get by.

For the most part, Shaarans are ercely loyal, relentlessly

vengeful, and respect anyone who has the ability to survive the

harsh rigors of the grasslands. The nomads revere horses, the

herds, other native animals of the plains, and a worthy adversary.

He also values the foreigner who comes to trade. A Shaaryan

tribesman doesnt look down on such strangers, but he and his

comrades know that an outsider can never truly understand what

it means to be Shaaran.

Shaaryan Characters

Shaarans make excellent barbarians, rangers, ghters, and

druids because of the harsh environment in which they live.

Understanding the land and being able to coexist with it is of

primary importance, and these classes are most practiced at such.

A few Shaarans become rogues, particularly those who prefer to

raid settlements, caravans, and other tribes. Those with spiritual

tendencies might follow the faith of a nature or hunting deity

instead of becoming a druid. A Shaaran with latent arcane ability

becomes an adept, bard, or sorcerer, but formal study is an alien

concept to the culture. Few wizards come from Shaaryan stock,

while monks and paladins are likewise rare.

Prestige Classes: A Shaaran typically becomes a Shaaryan

hunter. Among those who choose to leave the grasslands, more

than a few choose the path of the horizon walker.

Shaaryan Society

Shaaryan culture is built around the concept of the extended

family, or clan. Several clans form a tribe, and the tribe lives,

moves, and hunts together across a portion of the Shaar. At

dierent times, various tribes might ally or go to war with one

another (over water rights, hunting territory, or historic bad

blood), but they spend most of their time hunting and ignoring

others. The nomads hunt antelope, bison, boar, and elephant, all

of which provide them sustenance, food, shelter, and tools.

A tribe pools its shrewdest, most trustworthy adults into a

council of wise persons known as elders, and it is from this pool

that the tribe selects a chieftain, by secret vote. The chieftain

decides when it is time to relocate to keep up with a herd, when

to switch to a new herd to avoid over-hunting one, what to do

with criminals, and so forth. Everyone else is expected to obey

12

Races and Regions

the chieftain and the elders. Those who cannot abide by these

directives are exiled, for the tribe has no time or energy to

reform miscreants.

Tribes dont give a second thought to raiding one another

and dont, if the raiding party has fewer than twenty warriors,

consider such attacks to be warfare. The stealing of food, horses,

equipment, and even women and children is an accepted part of

life on the plains. Raids with larger forces are considered outright

acts of war, and such conicts continue until the two tribes

meet to discuss peace terms. Warring tribes are barred from the

semiannual intertribal gatherings at the Council Hills.

Language and Literacy

Shaarans speak Shaaran, a language that has no connection with

any other language family in Faern. The language has adapted

some words from other cultures over the centuries, particularly

with the coming of traders to the region. Few Shaarans can read

or write because the culture relies on an oral history. Those who

have learned to scribe the Shaaran language employ the Dethek

alphabet, learned from the gold dwarves in the Great Rift.

Shaaryan Magic and Lore

Shaaryan spellcasters are not numerous, although every tribe can

count on the services of one or two arcane, and perhaps twice

that many divine, spellcasters. Usually the chieftain or a loyal

elder is an adept or cleric with the ability to portend events. The

tribe almost always includes several rangers who serve as scouts,

as well as a druid to deal with the elements and the herds.

Spells and Spellcasting

Divination magic allows a tribe to determine when is the best time

to move camp, when inclement weather might threaten, and so

forth. Abjuration spells are useful for protection from attacks, the

elements, and monsters. Illusion spells enhance storytelling and

the presentation of oral history. Among divine spellcasters, spells

that focus on nature, healing, and the elements are most useful

to the nomadic culture, and druids and rangers are particularly

valuable to the survival of a tribe.

Shaaryan Magic Items

Few Shaarans become skilled enough at crafting magic items to

provide them for others. More often, they acquire such objects

through trade. Shaaryan nomads are fond of items that aid their

warriors in combat, including weapons, armor, and potions that

heal or increase battle prowess.

Shaaryan Deities

The folk of the Shaar follow deities of nature and of the hunt.

A whole tribe might worship a particular deity, but more often

various tribe members venerate a number of diering deities.

Many tribes follow Tempus. In the Shaar, all are warriors, for

foes are not limited to enemy tribes, but include the harshness

of the land and the creatures it hides. Before raids and during

war, Tempus is often propitiated.

Other nomads, who revel in the hunt more than the glory of

war, devote themselves to Malar, the Beastlord. These Shaarans

usually focus on that deitys hunting aspect, eschewing the bloodier

portions of Malars portfolio. Those working for survival cant

aord to be needlessly bloodthirsty.

A few Shaarans seek solace in the embrace of Akadi, nding

comfort in her tenets and how they relate to life in the grasslands

and the movement of the tribes.

Relations with Other Races

Shaarans have grown used to numerous other species moving

through or settling in their traditional lands, and they do not

favor one over others. The plains are a great crossroads for so

many dierentspeciesandculturesthatitdoesntmatterwhat

race a merchant is, or where he came from, as long as he has

something to oer. To a Shaaran, a persons ability to survive

in the grasslands and be a useful member of the tribe is of far

greater interest than where he might have been born.

Some tribes get along far better with the loxos and thri-kreen

that inhabit the Shaar, depending on how close the nomads

hunting grounds come to those two species territories. Shaarans

interact with other indigenous races as much as the other culture

allows. They have little contact, for example, with the wild elves

of the Misty Vale, but regular dealings with the gold dwarves

in the Great Rift.

Shaarans detest gnolls, but have equal distaste for the yuan-ti

that have begun to appear near Lake Lhespen or the Lake of

Salt. In both cases, Shaaryan nomads attack on sight and let the

bodies fall where they may. Fortunately, the dragons that hunt

the Shaar for food do not come often or in great numbers, for

most tribes can do little about them.

Shaaryan Equipment

The Shaaryan people derive almost every piece of equipment

they use from the land around them and the animals they hunt.

In addition to food, the herds they follow provide them with

weapons, clothing, and tools. Of course, the nomads trade for a

few additional items, but such possessions are rare and wondrous

by Shaaryan norms.

Arms and Armor

Shaaryan warriors prefer functional weapons that suit the no-

madic lifestyle and can be constructed or repaired in the grasslands

without the need for a blacksmith. Knives, spears, nets, and bows

are typical arms, and are often made of stone or bone. Light

armor, such as padded or leather, is most prevalent.

Animals and Pets

The Shaaryan culture depends primarily on its horses for

continued existence. Shaaryan horses are superior specimens

that thrive on the grasses of the plains, but tend to sicken

and die if removed from the Shaar. It is not uncommon to

nd a Shaaryan ranger or druid with a powerful predator of

the plains, such as a lion or cheetah, as a companion. Smaller

creatures, conditioned to the lifestyle of the nomads, are

13

Races and Regions

sometimes kept as pets, but most often these are familiars to

tribal spellcasters.

Loxo

Almost like humanoid elephants, the nomadic loxos share the

plains of the Shaar with humans and others. Loxos are hunter-

gatherers that prefer the seclusion that comes with miles of open

terrain and little interaction with other species. They have roamed

the plains for some two centuries, claiming to have arrived from

another world via mysterious means. Only the loxos are certain

where they came from, and they do not speak of it.

Personality: Loxos are peaceful creatures that want nothing

so much as to be left alone. Though they are not aggressive, they

defend their herds ferociously, able to ghtinaterribleragewhen

necessary. They are fond of geometric patterns in their simple

clothing, particularly with circle or diamond shapes, and enjoy

creating rustic works of art to trade.

Physical Description: A loxo appears to be a bipedal elephant,

albeit a bit smaller. Its skin is bluish-gray, wrinkled, and covered

with rough, sparse hair. It has stocky limbs and ngers,atfeet,

and large ears. Its most striking feature is the pair of trunks

that grow from its face, framed by large

tusks. Each trunk is about 2 feet long

and has three ngerlikedigitsat

the end. The typical loxo stands

about 7 to 7-1/2 feet tall

and weighs about 500

pounds.

Relations: Loxos prefer the company of their own kind, but

do not go out of their way to discourage visitors unless they know

hostilities are likely. They come into the cities to trade from

time to time, particularly to oer pieces of their artwork for

sale. Otherwise, left to their own devices, loxos avoid the other

nomads of the Shaar.

Alignment: Isolationist by nature, loxos do not involve them-

selves in causes or in other species problems. They are removed

from the struggles between good and evil that surface in other

parts of the world, favoring neither side. To the loxos, everything

has its place, but extremes can be detrimental to the survival of

the herd. Loxos tend to be true neutral.

Religion: Loxos venerate nature and strength, having a preva-

lent druidic tradition and a secondary priesthood. The worship of

the druids appears to focus on an entity that must be an aspect

of Hiatea, a deity of giants, but also one of nature, agriculture,

hunting, and childbirth. Many loxo clerics worship their vision

of Hiatea, while some favor an aspect of Iallanis (also a deity of

giants) for his strength and healing ability.

Language: Loxos speak their own language. Many of them also

learn Common and Shaaran to trade or negotiate eectively.

Male Names: Alagar, Debib, Gaugan, Jatik, Ranjeet, Rohap,

Taral, Varien.

Female Names: Agrit, Bakal, Devrika, Jamune, Kasi, Lavika,

Otala, Ranial, Shali, Tarali, Valsha.

Adventurers: As is often the case with youths, young loxos

occasionally feel a need to travel beyond the traditional territory

of their herd. Intrigued by humans and other races, some loxos

take up with a group of adventurers for an experience of life

beyond the Shaar.

Regions: Most loxos live in the Shaar, though a very few

might hail from the Golden Water region.

are powerful physical specimens, but their lack of contact with

outsiders limits their abilities of persuasion.

Monstrous Humanoid: Loxos are not subject to spells or

eects that aect only humanoids, such as charm person or

dominate person.

Large: As a large creature, a loxo has a 1 penalty to Armor

Class, a 1 penalty on attack rolls, a 4 penalty on Hide checks,

a +4 bonus on grapple checks, and his lifting and carrying

limits are double those of Medium characters.

Space/Reach: 10 feet/10 feet.

Loxo base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Racial Hit Dice: A loxo begins with ve levels of

monstrous humanoid, which provide him with

base saving throw bonuses of Fort +1, Ref +4,

Will +4.

Racial Skills: A loxos monstrous humanoid

loxo can make single attack with one

trunk (as a slam attack) that deals 1d6

points of damage, or with a full-attack

action, he can make slams with both

member killed or incapacitated enters a berserk rage. The

loxo gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution,

and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a 2 penalty

to Armor Class. This rage lasts a number of rounds equal to

3 + the loxos (newly improved) Constitution modier. After

the rage ends, the loxo is fatigued (2 penalty to Strength,

2 penalty to Constitution, cant charge or run) until the

end of the encounter.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a loxo can trample

creatures of Medium size or smaller. The loxo merely has

to move over the opponents. The trample deals 1d8 (plus

1-1/2 times the loxos Strength bonus) points of bludgeon-

ing damage. A trampled opponent can make an attack of

opportunity with a 4 penalty against the trampling loxo

or attempt a Reex save for half damage. The DC for the

15

Reex save is 10 + 2 (1/2 of the loxos racial HD) + the

loxos Str modier.

Automatic Languages: Loxo. Bonus Languages: Common,

Favored Class: Ranger. A multiclassed loxos ranger class does

not count when determining whether he takes an experience

point penalty for multiclassing.

Level Adjustment: +2.

Thri-Kreen

Thri-kreen are a mantislike race of hunters that travel in packs

across the grasslands of the Shaar. They are reclusive and alien

to most other creatures that share the plains with them.

Their physical nature and aggressive hunting tactics make

them superior in the region, but thri-kreen do not usually

attack other sentient creatures without provocation.

Personality:  Thri-kreen  have  no

solid personalities as hu-

mans would denethem.

Unpredictable in every-

thing they do, thri-kreen

do not evidence much emotion in their

behavioral patterns. Their faces are in-

capable of exhibiting most feelings, but

agitation does show in the rapid motion

of antennae and mandibles. The

focus of the thri-kreen

is always on survival, and they respect

only prowess and strength.

Physical Description: A thri-kreen

looks like a bipedal praying mantis,

between 4-1/2 and 7 feet tall, weigh-

ing 100 to 375 pounds. Of the six

limbs protruding from a thri-

kreens midsection, two are

used for walking, and each

of the other four ends in

a four-ngered hand. A

sand-colored exoskeleton

covers an adult thri-kreens

body. Two compound eyes, two antennae, and a complicated jaw

structure, which includes a pair of wicked mandibles, give the

head an insectlike appearance. The typical thri-kreen wears a

harness, belt, and slings for holding its equipment, but no other

clothing or armor.

Relations: Thri-kreen neither seek nor shun contact with

other races. They simply exist with other species and share terri-

tory so long as others do not begin to over hunt an area or waste

precious resources. If a thri-kreen pack perceives interlopers as

a danger, they attack relentlessly, heedless of their own safety,

until the threat is either driven o or slain. Lacking any sense

of honor or loyalty, thri-kreen are a hard species with which

to negotiate.

Alignment: Thri-kreen lack devotion beyond the convenience

of joining with exceptional hunting companions, and are spontane-

ous in most of their actions. Adding to this chaotic behavior, they

Thri-kreen

Races and Regions

have no traditions of their own and see little value in those of

others. Further, while thri-kreen are not needlessly cruel or evil,

they do not go out of their way to help others. Simple existence

and survival rule the thri-kreen way of lifethe strong live and

the weak die.

Religion: Thri-kreen have no established religious practices.

However, some of them have become attuned to the hunting and

resource aspects of nature deities, such as Silvanus or Malar, and

developed druidic spellcasting abilities. Others, perhaps inuenced

by Shaaryan neighbors, see the power in following Tempus or

Akadi and become clerics of one of these deities.

Language: Thri-kreen speak their own language, Thri-Kreen,

which is composed of clicks and snaps of their mandibles. Most

thri-kreen learn to speak a smattering of Common if their packs

roam near humanoid civilizations.

Names: Thri-kreen make no distinction between male and

female names, and they have no surnames.

Thri-kreen  Names:  Chital,  Drik-chkit,  Gulnik,  Kiktul,

Klaktuk, Krik, Pok, Ptekwe, Taltich, Tilnak, Tik-tik

Adventurers: Thri-kreen sometimes break with the pack

and explore lands beyond their hunting grounds. Typically,

this activity is at the behest of leaders, who feel information is

important for the survival of the pack. Lone thri-kreen often

become caravan guards or join with those that roam the lands,

seeking only to better survive, but learning the ways of other

folk in the process.

Regions: The Shaar.

Thri-kreen Racial Traits

+2 Strength, +4 Dexterity, 2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, 4

Charisma. Thri-kreen are superior physically, but their alien

thinking prevents them from easily grasping higher concepts

or dealing well with others.

Monstrous Humanoid: Thri-kreen are not subject to spells or

eects that aect humanoids only, such as charm person or

dominate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, thri-kreen have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Thri-kreen base land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Thri-kreen do not sleep and are immune to sleep spells and

similar magical eects. A thri-kreen spellcaster still requires

8 hours of rest before preparing spells.

+3 Natural Armor: A thri-kreens exoskeleton is tough and

resistant to blows.

Multiple  Limbs:  Thri-kreen  have  four  arms,  and  thus

can take the Multiweapon Fighting feat (page 304 of the

Monster Manual) instead of the Two-Weapon Fighting feat.

Thri-kreen can also take the Multiattack feat. These are not

bonus feats.

Natural Attacks: Thri-kreen can attack with four claws and

a bite. The claws deal 1d4 points of damage, and the bite is

a secondary attack that also deals 1d4 points of damage. A

thri-kreen can attack with a weapon (or multiple weapons) at

its normal attack bonus and make either a bite or claw attack

as a secondary attack. For example, a thri-kreen ranger with

the Multiweapon Fighting feat who is armed with four short

swords could attack with all four swords at a 2 penalty (the

normal penalty for ghtingwithmultipleweaponswhileusing

light weapons in o hands) and also make a bite attack at a

5 penalty.

Poison (Ex): Injury (bite), initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary

damage paralysis for 2d6 minutes, DC 11 + the thri-kreens

Con modier. A thri-kreen produces enough poison for one

bite per day.

Leap (Ex): Thri-kreen are natural jumpers. They have a +30

racial bonus on all Jump checks.

Weapon Familiarity: Thri-kreen can treat the gythka and

chatkcha (see sidebar) as martial weapons, rather than

exotic weapons.

Naturally Psionic: When using the Expanded Psionics Hand-

book, thri-kreen gain 1 bonus power point at 1st level. This

benetdoesnotgranttheabilitytomanifestpsionicpowers

unless such powers are gained through another source, such

as levels in a psionic class.

equal to 1/2 the thri-kreens Hit Dice (minimum 1st).

Thri-kreen Weapons

Thri-kreen warriors have invented two exotic weapons that are

unique to their race: the gythka and the chatkcha.

Gythka: This two-handed exotic melee weapon is a polearm

with a blade at each end. You can ght with it as if ghting

with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack

penalties associated with ghtingwithtwoweapons,justasifyou

were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. A thri-kreen

can wield two gythkas at once as double weapons due to its four

arms. When so doing, the creature takes penalties as if its o-hand

weapons were one-handed weapons, not light weapons.

Age, Height,

and Weight

The details of your characters age, gender, height, weight, and

appearance are up to you. However, if you prefer some rough

guidelines in determining these details, refer to Tables 12

through 14.

Character Age

Your characters age is determined by your choice of race and

class, as summed up on Table 12: Random Starting Ages. For

example, a loxo barbarians starting age is 12 + 1d4 years, or

1316 years, while a thri-kreen ranger is 5 + 1d2 years old, or

67 years of age.

As your character ages, his physical ability scores (Strength,

Dexterity, and Constitution) decrease and his mental ability scores

(Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) increase. The eects of

each aging step are cumulative, but a characters ability scores

can never be reduced below 1 by aging.

When a character reaches venerable age, the DM secretly

rolls to determine his maximum age. This is the sum of the

races venerable age plus the modierfromtheMaximumAge

column of Table 13. When a character reaches his maximum

age, he dies of old age at some point in the following year, as

determined by the DM.

Merchant ships owbackandforthalongtheentirestretchofthe

southern coast of Faern, following the shoreline, transporting

goods to market, and gaining new cargos destined for yet another

city. Goods and news arent the only cargos carried along the trade

routes, though. Specialists, skilled in everything from commerce

to monster hunting, move from place to place, sharing their

expertise with others. The wizards of Halruaa might jealously

guard their skills, but some have managed to disseminate them

all the same.

Regions for humans who call some part of the Shining South

home include Dambrath, The Golden Water, Halruaa, and The

Shaar. A new region for humans is The Swagdar. Characters

might journey to any part of the South from other lands, of

course, but any humans native to the area hail from one of these

areas. Numerous nonhuman characters are also found in the

South. Their regions include Dambrath (half-drow), The Great

Rift (gold dwarves), Luiren (strongheart and lightfoot half-

lings), and The Shaar (centaurs, loxos, thri-kreen, and wemics).

Loxos and thri-kreen also have their own regions described in

this booka character that chooses one of these racial regions

could certainly be a native of the Shining South. This section

also introduces four new nonhuman regions: Forest of Amtar

and the Misty Vale (wild elves), Rathgaunt Hills (gnomes), and

Rethild (lizardfolk).

Races and Regions

Reading the Region

Descriptions

Each of the regions is described in the following way.

Automatic Languages: The character knows all the languages

identied here. All player characters also know Common.

Bonus Languages: 1st-level characters, with Intelligence scores

of 12 or higher, can choose one language from this list for every

point of Intelligence bonus.

Regional Feats: The feats specictocharactersoftheregion.

All the feats mentioned in this

section are described in Play-

this bonus equipment at 1st level,

in addition to any starting money

he gains based on his choice of

class. He gains only one of the

equipment packages provided

here. Items marked with an

asterisk (*) are masterwork

items.

Regions for

Characters Above

1st Level

Characters from powerful

races might be equivalent to

2nd-, 3rd-, or 4th-level charac-

ters despite the fact that they have

only one class level. When such

a character chooses a region, he

gains access to regional feats,

automatic and bonus languages,

and bonus equipment just like any

other character. A beginning char-

acter of higher than 1st level should

be equipped as a character of his eectivecharacterlevel(ECL),

so the bonus equipment is often less important to him than it is

to a 1st-level character.

If the character has racial Hit Dice before he adds his rst

level of a character class, he can still choose a region. This

provides the character with the normal benetsofaregion,but

he can only choose a regional feat if his racial Hit Dice and/or

levels would permit him a new feat. For example, a loxo begins

with 5 Hit Dice, and thus ve levels of monstrous humanoid.

He can use his 1st- or 3rd-level monstrous humanoid feat, or

his 6th-level character feat (gained when he adds the rstlevel

of any character class), to choose regional feats.

Forest of Amtar Region

Deep in the heart of the hot, humid woods north of Dambrath,

the wild elves try to preserve their way of life and prohibit

incursions from all sides. They use guerrilla tactics to thwart the

Crinti logging that is slowly destroying their homeland, drive o

bandits to the north, and deter the gnolls and other dark things

that lurk beneath the Gate of the Iron Fangs to the west.

On the outskirts of

the lands of Dambrath,

some folk choose to

endure the harshest

wilderness rather than

submission to the Crinti.

These people are ready to

ght for what they need,

hide from those who would subdue them,

and die before they surrender their free-

dom. They might not be honorable, but

at least they answer to no one but themselves.

Automatic Languages: Arkaiun.

Bonus Languages: Drow, Gnoll, Halruaan, Shaaran.

Regional Feats: Blooded, Might Makes Right, Thug.

Bonus Equipment: (A) Hide armor* or (B) shortbow* and

20 arrows.

Thri-Kreen Region

The thri-kreen roam the open grasslands of the Shaar, unremit-

tingly hunting the plains. They care little for the other races that

share their territory, so long as those species do not encroach

on their resources. When that happens, the thri-kreen attack

without pity or remorse.

Automatic Languages: Thri-kreen.

Bonus Languages: Shaaran.

Regional Feats: Discipline, Fearless, Tireless.

T he Shining Souths cultural and ethnic diversity

has resulted in a wide variety of elite organizations,

secret orders, and masters of specialized knowledge.

Some of these groups serve only their own twisted interests, while

others benet society at large.

Of the prestige classes described in the Dungeon Masters

Guide, both the archmage and the dwarven defender are the most

familiar in the Shining South. While large numbers of wizards in

Halruaa have followed the path of the archmage, a nearly equal

amount of gold dwarves in the Great Rift have focused their at-

tention to the task of protecting their ancient home. Among the

wild elves of the vast Forest of Amtar and the Misty Vale, more

than a few arcane archers practice their craft. Arcane tricksters

are prevalent in many parts of the southern regions of Faern,

particularly in Luiren. Assassins and blackguards certainly exist

among the monsters of Veldorn or the Bandit Wastes south of the

Shaar, but they are rare elsewhere in the South. On the plains of

the Shaar, where dragons have hunted since time immemorial, a

number of dragon disciples roam, while on the coasts, particularly

in the less savory quarters of sea ports, duelists make themselves

at home.

Among the defensive forces in Halruaa, eldritch knights are

both ubiquitous and welcome, though they might face oagainst

others of their ilk who hail from across the mountains in Dam-

brath. Hierophants are scarce in the lands of the Shining South,

found mostly around the Golden Water and among the tribes

of the Shaar. Horizon walkers are the logical product of such

diverse, wild places as are found in southern Faern. Loremasters

are almost as widespread in Halruaa as archmages, and so are

mystic theurges. Shadowdancers skulk in just about any port city in

the Shining South, and perhaps among those wizards in Halruaa

who have secretly embraced the Shadow Weave. Finally, a few

thaumaturgists might be found on the borders between Durpar

and Veldorn, calling on their respective otherworldly powers to

aid them in battling their foes.

Many of the classes presented in the Forgotten Realms

Campaign Setting, Races of Faern, and Players Guide to

Faern are active in the Shining South. Arcane devotees are

common in Dambrath, Halruaa, and the Golden Water region,

while divine champions are also numerous among Durpari

people, as well as the dwarves of the Great Rift. Divine disciples

can be found in temples scattered across the entirety of the

South, but they are particularly well known in both Dambrath

and the Golden Water. Guild thieves are uncommon, though

they might be found in Luiren. A number of shadow adepts

are likely scattered throughout the entire region, particularly

in Halruaa, where a secret cabal of those who tap the Shadow

Weave is suspected. While gnomes themselves are rare in the

South, breachgnomes certainly mingle with the followers of

Gaerdal Ironhand in the Rathgaunt Hills. Runecasters reside

among the gold dwarves and the nomadic tribes of the Shaar

that have been inuenced by the culture of the Great Rift.

These latter two cultures also have distinctive vocationsthe

Shaaryan hunter is a customary profession among the nomads

of the Shaar, and the Great Rift skyguard is unique to the gold

dwarves canyon home.

This chapter presents nine new and two adapted prestige classes

for the Shining South: the Crinti shadow marauder, the Great

Rift deep defender, the Great Sea corsair, the Halruaan elder, the

Halruaan magehound, the hand of the Adama, the hin st, the

jordain vizier, the Luiren marchwarden, the Maquar crusader,

and the scourge maiden.

Prestige Classes

Crinti

Shadow Marauder

Among the idly rich Crinti of Dambrath, some thrill in the havoc

they wreak on their traditional foesthe halings to the east,

the wild elves to the north, and the wizards to the west. These

riders take pleasure in instilling uncertainty in their prey from

a shroud of shadows, then imparting feelings of fearful surprise

as the marauders appear without warning, escalating

nallytosheerterrorasthechasebegins.Fewactually

see Crinti shadow marauders coming, and fewer live

to tell the tale.

Crinti shadow marauders combine the physical

prowess of master rider with the stealth of the most

cunning shadowdancers. Rangers work as the best

entry class, but multiclass rogues and ghtersarealso

attracted to the path of the Crinti shadow marauder.

Clerics, druids, and wizards ndthemselvesparticu-

larly ill suited to the strange combination of skills

demanded by this class.

Crinti shadow marauders are found almost

exclusively in Dambrath, since they tend to come

from the aristocracy that rules that land. They ride

in packs as small as three to four individuals, all

the way up to large skirmishing forces of several

hundred. While the riders favor the ne horses of

Dambrath, they are by no means limited to such

mounts. Occasionally, a Crinti shadow marauder grows tired

of the life of riding on the plains with her comrades and

leaves Dambrath entirely, perhaps taking up with others to

see the wider world.

Furilla Joswyvn,

a Crinti shadow marauder

Sudden Strike (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level,

if a Crinti shadow marauder can catch an op-

ponent when he is unable to defend himself

eectively from her attack, she can strike

a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever a

Crinti shadow marauders target is denied his

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether the target

actually has a Dexterity bonus to AC or not), the

marauder deals an extra 1d6 points of damage with her attack.

The extra damage increases to 2d6 at 4th level. The extra damage

from the sudden strike ability stacks with extra damage from

sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.

Ranged attacks count as sudden strikes only if the target is

within 30 feet. A Crinti shadow marauder cant strike with deadly

accuracy from beyond that range.

A Crinti shadow marauder can only use sudden strike against

living creatures with discernible anatomiesundead, constructs,

oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack.

Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to

sudden strike damage. The Crinti shadow marauder must be able

to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be

able to reach such a spot. A Crinti shadow marauder cannot make

Prestige Classes

a sudden strike while striking a creature with concealment or

striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are out of reach.

A Crinti shadow marauder cant use sudden strike to deliver

nonlethal damage. Weapons only capable of dealing nonle-

thal damage dont deal extra damage when used as part of a

sudden strike.

Bonus Feat: At 3rd level, the Crinti shadow marauder gains

a bonus feat selected from the following list: Mounted Archery,

Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample. The Crinti shadow

marauder must meet the normal prerequisites for the feat.

Shadow Walk (Sp): Starting at 3rd level, a Crinti shadow

marauder can use shadow walk once per day, aectingonlyherself

and her mount. Her caster level is equal to her Crinti shadow

marauder level, and she must be astride her mount to use this

ability. This ability does not stack with shadow walk spell-like

abilities granted by other sources.

Shadow Pounce (Ex): At 5th level, a Crinti shadow marauder

learns how to attack swiftly from the shadows. Any time she

uses an ability, spell, or eect with the teleportation descriptor

(for example, her shadow ride ability), she can execute a full

attack upon completion of the teleportation. The marauder

must have line of sight to her intended target from her original

location. Further, the spot to which she teleports must be a

place from which she can make a melee attack against the

intended target with whatever weapon she had in hand at the

beginning of her action.

Great Rift

Deep Defender

The Great Rift deep defender has a keen understanding of the

importance of making a stand. He knows he must remain vigilant

against the possibility of attack from the ancient enemies of the

gold dwarves, and he has taken it upon himself to become an

immovable bastion of protection at the edges of his subterranean

home. He acts as a dam against the enemies that would invade

his beloved Rift, and such a dwarf refuses to give way to any

attacks, no matter how formidable.

24

Prestige Classes

Most Great Rift deep defenders are rst ghters, paladins,

rangers, or clerics. Rogues, bards, and monks depend too heavily

on mobility to eectivelyusetheabilitiesoftheGreatRiftdeep

defender, and the gold dwarves dont count many barbarians

among their number. While sorcerers and druids might ndthe

defensive capabilities of the Great Rift deep defender benecial,

such individuals usually have other goals.

Great Rift deep defenders serve as the main line of defense

along the perimeter of the Deep Realm, that portion of the Great

Rift below the surface and adjacent to the Underdark. They work

well in units, guarding passages that lead deeper into uncontrolled

territory. Occasionally, a Great Rift deep defender can be found

on some special mission elsewhere in the Underdark or, more

rarely, on the surface.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become a Great Rift deep defender, a character

must fulll all the following criteria.

Race: Gold dwarf.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Feats: Dodge, Endurance, Toughness.

Region: The Great Rift.

(and the key ability for each skill) are

Improved Uncanny Dodge

(Ex): At 4th level and above,

a Great Rift deep defender can

no longer be anked,sincehecan

react to opponents on opposite

sides of him as easily as he

can react to a single attacker.

This defense denies rogues

the ability to use anking

to sneak attack the deep

defender. The exception

to this defense is that a rogue

at least four levels higher

than the deep defender

can ank him (and thus

sneak attack him).

If the character gains

uncanny dodge (see above)

from a second class (such

as rogue), the character

automatically gains im-

proved uncanny dodge,

and the levels from those

classes stack to determine the minimum

rogue level required to ank the Great Rift

deep defender.

Subterranean Bulwark (Ex): When he

is in an enclosed area, the Great Rift deep

defender can become a stalwart bastion of

defense. In a narrow or a low space, he

gains DR 3/, as well as a +1 bonus on

attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage

rolls. (A narrow space is an area no wider

than 5 feet, while a low area is shorter

than the deep defender, but at least half

of his height.) He cannot move from

the spot he is defending without losing

the benets of this ability.

The deep defender ignores the penalty

for hampered melee when ghting in a

narrow or low space with light or one-

handed melee weapons, and takes only a

4 circumstance penalty on attack rolls

when using a two-handed weapon in such

conditions. In a space both narrow and

low, the deep defender functions as if

only one of those conditions applied. In

addition, when ghtingincrampedquar-

ters the deep defender does not lose his

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.

A Great Sea corsair

Great Sea Corsair

Plying the trade lanes along the southern coast of Faern,

the Great Sea corsair is a master of the waves with a devil-

may-care attitude. Branded pirate by some and independent

mercenary by others, the Great Sea corsair is a privateer who

runs things her own way and gets payment for services up

front. Those who pay a Great Sea corsair can expect their own

ships to sail safely, secure that they have a powerful naval force

watching their backs. Ships that havent bothered to contract

with these privateers can anticipatesooner or later and out

of sight of landto be boarded and plundered. Such is life on

the Great Sea.

Rogues are most likely to turn their attention to the path

of a Great Sea corsair, while barbarians, bards, ghters, and

rangers do so less frequently. Occasionally, a spellcaster might

be attracted to life aboard a privateers ship. Other classes either

dont have the requisite skills or simply have no interest in such

a drastically dierent lifestyle.

Great Sea corsairs enjoy one anothers company. A number

of them might carouse together when ashore, but few ever stray

far enough inland to leave behind the tangy smell of salt and

the soothing sound of crashing waves. Sometimes a Great Sea

corsair takes up with other adventurers, especially if there is

seagoing travel to be expected and treasure to be had.

Creating a Great Sea Corsair

You can create a Great Sea corsair by adapting the dread pirate

prestige class from Song and Silence for use in Faern. (An

updated version of the dread pirate prestige class also appears

in the upcoming D&D supplement Complete Adventurer.) The

prestige class can be used with the following adjustments.

Patron (Ex): At 1st level, the Great Sea corsair must des-

ignate some merchant or political entity as her patron. This

patron is a person or an organization that the corsair has

served in some way. For example, if the Great Sea corsair has

been hired by a Dambrathan noble to sink his rivals merchant

ships, then the corsair can designate the noble as a patron. The

corsair gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks

when dealing with her patron. She gains a +2 circumstance

bonus on Intimidate checks when dealing with any of her

patrons adversaries, or anyone she is known to have pirated

before (as inconsequential as a single ship and its crew to as

daunting as an entire nation). At any point, the corsair can

switch to a new patron, in which case the circumstance bonuses

change accordingly. If the corsair ever chooses to forgo a patron

altogether, she immediately takes a 2 circumstance penalty

on all Diplomacy checks with anyone the DM deems appropri-

ate, until such time as she establishes a new patron. A corsair

without a patron is a mere pirate, unworthy of trust.

all the following criteria.

Skills: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks,

Spellcraft 10 ranks.

Halruaan Elder

For a member of Halruaan society, being recognized as a wizard

is not enough; the panache with which one utilizes magic is of

equal importance. Halruaan elders are the very epitome of such

ostentatious thinking, and their dazzling and unique displays of

arcane force make them the most respected practitioners in the

land. Their unparalleled talents are what earned them a seat

on the revered and prestigious Council of Elders, where they

participate in the policy-making of the country.

Arcane spellcasters are the only classes eligible to join the

ranks of the Halruaan elders, and the vast majority are wizards.

Neither bards nor sorcerers are respected in Halruaan society,

so few of them ever stay in their homeland long enough to

attain the level of talent necessary to become a member of the

Council. No other classes have the necessary skills to become a

Halruaan elder.

Though Halruaan elders are responsible for governing the

country, the demands on their time in this capacity are not great.

Thus, they are free to travel, experiment, and research new spells

or craft items. A sizable number of elders rarely appear in the

court of the netyarch (wizard-king), choosing instead to venture

forth in search of wondrous magic elsewhere in Faern.

Hit Die: d4.

Table 23: The Halruaan Elder

Region: Halruaa.

Special: The character must petition for entry into the

Halruaan Council of Elders and, after a divinatory background

check by current elders, be accepted to that ruling body.

Class Skills

The Halruaan elders class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int),

Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int),

Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modier.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the Halruaan elder prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: Halruaan elders gain no

prociency in weapons or armor.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each level, the Halruaan elder

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he

had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which

he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not,

however, gain any other benetacharacterofthatclasswould

have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If he had more than

one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a Halruaan elder,

he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Adroit Casting (Ex): The Halruaan elder has become so skilled

at casting his spells with various metamagic feats that utilizing

such feats has become easier for him. At 1st level, he picks a

metamagic feat he knows. The cost in increased level of spell

slots to use that metamagic feat is now permanently reduced by

one level, to a minimum total modication of a spells original

level + 1. For example if a Halruaan elder with adroit casting 1

wishes to prepare an empowered magic missile, that spell takes

up a slot only one level higher than its original level (instead of

two). At 4th level, and every three levels thereafter, the Halruaan

elder can choose another metamagic feat he knows. That feat

gains the same benet; spells altered by that feat take up a slot

one level lower than normal (minimum of the spells original

level + 1). If the Halruaan elder doesnt have a metamagic feat

to apply the ability to when he gains a level that grants adroit

casting, or if hes has previously applied adroit casting to all of

the viable metamagic feats he knows (any metamagic feats that

require spells to occupt a slot two or more levels higher than

normal), he gains no benet from this ability until

he aquires a new metamagic feat that adroit cast-

ing can aect. At that time, he can

automatically designate that feat as

altered by the unused application of

adroit casting.

The elder cannot choose the same

metamagic feat more than once

with adroit casting. For example, a

Halruaan elder who picks Quicken

Spell at 4th level, reducing the cost

in increased level of spell slots to three, cannot pick

Quicken Spell against at 7th or 10th level to reduce

the cost again.

The elder can prepare a spell with multiple

metamagic feats altered through the adroit casting

ability. For examply, a 10th-level wizard/10th-level

Halruaan elder who has selected Empower Spell

and Maximize Spell as two of the metamagic

feats altered by adroit casting can prepare

1st-level empowered, maximized spells in

4th-level spell slots, as opposed to 6th-level

spell slots (2  1 [empowered] + 3  1 [maximized]

= 3 [new spell slot used]).

Circle Link (Ex): A Halruaan elder has

the ability to participate in Halruaan

circle magic through the Halruaan

Adept feat, a prerequisite for entry

into the class. Circle magic is described

fully on page 59 of the Forgotten Realms

Campaign Setting and page 194 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

A Halruaan elder of at least 5th level can be a circle leader. He

also goes through a ritual so he can be contacted via Halruaas

Crystal Orb (see page 59).

Signature Spell: A Halruaan elder gains Signature Spell as

a bonus feat at 2nd, 5th, and 8th levels. He need not meet the

prerequisite for the feat, and thus can choose any spell he knows

as a signature spell, rather than a spell he has mastered with the

Spell Mastery feat. See page 43 of Players Guide to Faern for

the Signature Spell feat.

Halruaan Magehound

Magehounds are Halruaas inquisitors. Conceived in the countrys

earliest days as a means of preventing the kind of tragedy Karsus

brought upon the Netherese, magehounds are tasked with

keeping renegade practitioners in check. They test the

Jordaini for magical ability, track down criminal wiz-

ards, and enforce Halruaas most important lawsthose

governing the use of magic. Everyone fears magehounds

to some degree, for they are considered above the normal

laws of the land. They answer only to the Council of

Elders, and even those wizards are not immune to a

magehounds wrath.

Typically, only wizards or clerics have the insight and

dedication to become a Halruaan magehound. tempera-

ment Occasionally, sorcerers become magehounds, and

they are, in some ways, considered more appropriate for

the task because of their perverse (by Halruaan standards)

arcane nature.

The job of Halruaan magehounds is often lonely.

Arcane spellcasters shun their company, and rarely

do these inquisitors gather in force unless their prey

is particularly powerful or dicult to capture. More

often, a magehound has associates to assist her in the

hunt. These companions provide skills and abilities that

compliment the magehounds own, making her task

that much easier.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Halruaan magehound

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: A Halruaan magehound

gains no prociency with any weapon or armor.

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each level except 4th and

8th, a Halruaan magehound gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in

a spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the

prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benet

a character of that class would have gained (improved chance

of turning or destroying undead, metamagic or item creation

feats, and so on). If she had more than one spellcasting class

before becoming a Halruaan magehound, she must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Improved Saves (Ex): The Halruaan magehound learns to

improve her resistance to the very sorts of spells she uses against

others. At 1st level, she gains a +1 resistance bonus on her saves

against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1

every two levels above 1st, to a maximum of +5 at 9th level.

Arcane Sensitivity (Sp): The Halruaan magehound develops

a keen awareness of the presence of arcane magic in any living

creature. She can use arcane sensitivity (see page 44) at will as

a wizard whose level is equal to her Halruaan magehound level

plus her highest spellcaster level..

Spell Resistance (Ex): The Halruaan magehound develops

resistance to magic. At 4th level, she gains a spell resistance equal

to 15 + her Halruaan magehound level.

Antimagic Field (Sp): The Halruaan magehound develops a

powerful tool to thwart the mages she is hunting. At 10th level,

the magehound can use antimagic eldonceperdayasawizard

whose level is equal to her Halruaan magehound level plus her

highest spellcaster level.

Prestige Classes

Clerics and paladins most often turn to the role of spiritual

advisor and peacekeeper that the hand of the Adama embodies.

Very rarely, a druid or ranger accepts the mantle of a hand of the

Adama. No other classes have the spiritual connection necessary

to serve a temple and its ock in such a manner.

Hands of the Adama often work in small groups together, or

with others who are devoted in their own way to furthering the

tenets of the faith. Occasionally, a hand of the Adama leaves the

Golden Water on some mission or purpose, but most are not often

seen far from home. The companions of a hand of the

Adama must be individuals of high moral character.

Hand of

the Adama

The hand of the Adama is a benign leader, judge

and jury, and protector of the common folk all

rolled into one. In a land where the faith of the

people is intertwined with their day-to-day activities,

the hand of the Adama is the presence that helps

them remember the code of conduct, settles disputes, and assists

those who require aid. A hand of the Adama understands better

than anyone the truths of The One and serves as teacher for

others to gain clarity in their actions.

Sovial, a hand of the Adama

Spells Per Day/Spells Known: At each level, a hand of the

Adama gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable)

as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to

which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does

not, however, gain any other benet a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying

undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). If he had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a hand

of the Adama, he must decide to which class to add each level for

the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Tongues (Sp): A hand of the Adama can use tongues as the

spell a number of times per day equal to his hand of the Adama

level plus his Charisma bonus (minimum once per day) as a caster

of a level equal to his hand of the Adama level plus his highest

divine spellcaster level.

A hin fist

Lay on Hands (Su): A hand of the

Adama can heal a total number of hit

points of damage equal to his hand of

the Adama level  his Charisma bonus

(if any) by touch. See the paladin class feature

on page 44 of the Players Handbook. Paladin levels

stack with hand of the Adama levels for the purpose

of determining how many hit points the hand of the

Adama can heal per day.

Discern Lies (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, a

hand of the Adama can use discern lies as the

spell three times per day as a caster of a level

equal to his hand of the Adama level plus his

highest divine spellcaster level. The save DC against

this ability is 14 + the hand of the Adamas

Wis modier.

Remove Disease (Sp): A hand of the

Adama of 2nd level can use remove

disease, as the spell, once per week at

2nd level. At 5th level and higher, he

can use this ability twice per week.

Divination  Enhancement  (Ex):

Beginning at 3rd level, a hand

of the Adama adds twice his

hand of the Adama level to his

percentage chance of success

when using divination spells such as augury or divination. If a

cleric 11/hand of the Adama 4 casts divination, his chance of

success is 70% (base) + 15% (1% per caster level) +8% (2  his

hand of the Adama level), or 93%.

Pierce Illusion (Su): At 4th level and above, a hand of the

Adama gains the supernatural ability to penetrate illusions and

disguises at will. Whenever a hand of the Adama sees an illusion

or disguise spell of any sort, he immediately makes a Will

save to see through it. The hand of the Adama need not

interact with or touch the illusion; visual contact is

enough to give the Will save.

Learn the Truth (Su): By touching a creature

that has lied to him, a hand of the Adama of

5th level can force the creature to tell the

truth. The creature can make a Will save

(DC 15 + the hand of the Adamas Cha

modier) to resist this mind-aecting

compulsion eect. If the saving throw

fails, the creature must speak the true

version of the lie it uttered. The hand

of the Adama can use this ability at will,

but only after casting discern lies (or using

his spell-like ability of the same name) on the

creature in question.

Hin Fist

A hin st is a devout member of a temple dedicated to both

Yondalla and the protection of the haling realm of Luiren.

Brimming with condence in her own abilities, a hin st

transforms that self-assurance into the power of mastery

over herself and the world around her. She sees her body and

mind as gifts from Yondalla that should be developed and used

to the fullestthere should be no need for articialtoolssuch

as weapons.

Clerics, paladins, and monks make the best hin sts,while

bards, ghters,androguessometimesnarrowthefocusoftheir

life to adapt to these ways. Even druids, sorcerers, and wizards

can occasionally discipline the mind and body enough to make

good use of a hin sts skills and abilities.

Hin stsusuallystudyandimprovethemselvesamongtheir

own kind in temples in Luiren. Otherwise they wander across

the land alone or with small groups, serving as champions of

Yondalla. Their strict beliefs require them to select comrades

that are true of heart.

Creating a Hin Fist

You can create a hin st by adapting the sacred st prestige

class from Complete Divine for use in Faern. The prestige

class can be used with the following adjustments.

To qualify to become a hin st, a character must fulll the

following criteria (in addition to those of the original prestige

class).

Race: Haling.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Patron Deity: Yondalla.

Region: Luiren.

Jordain Vizier

The Jordaini are a special servitor caste, though still

upper class, in the magocracy of Halruaa. They are

trained at a young age to understand magic, schooled in a wide

range of academic disciplines, and taught to be imperturbable

in the face of the wondrous. Following their graduation from

House Jordain, they are assigned to one of Halruaas ruling

class of wizards, where their special skills make them important

advisors to and guardians of their new masters.

Most jordain viziers begin their training as experts, and

then apply their abilities to the monk class until qualifying as a

jordain vizier, whereupon they typically alternate between monk

and jordain vizier levels. Members of the jordain order usually

multiclass as experts, ghters, jordain viziers, and monks, but

some multiclass as rogues. Few take up spellcasting classes, since

doing so inevitably makes them hunted by the magehounds.

Jordain viziers approach adventures as unappablyasthey

approach everything else. While most jordain viziers are found

away from their homes only when they accompany their masters

on important missions, a few ee Halruaa due to a breech of

their ethical code or to ndfreedom.Suchrenegadesarehunted

persons, likely to surround themselves with likeminded allies and

be always on the move.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To qualify to become a jordain vizier, a character must fulll

all the following criteria.

Race: Human (Halruaan).

Alignment: Any lawful.

Base Will Save: +6.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Diplomacy 2 ranks, Gather

Information 2 ranks, Heal 2 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 8

ranks, Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, Knowledge (nobility

and royalty) 4 ranks, Knowledge (any one other) 4

ranks, Listen 2 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Spellwise.

Patron Deity: One of Halruaas accepted deities,

usually Mystra or Azuth.

Special: Must be literate and speak Common,

Halruaan, and at least two other languages. Must

have been raised by House Jordain. Such rearing

precludes the practice of arcane magic and the use

of many magic items, subject to investigation by

a magehound.

Class Skills

The jordain viziers class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con),

Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather In-

formation (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all skills,

taken individually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha),

Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Speak

Language (n/a), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the

jordain vizier prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: A jordain vizier

gains no prociency with any weapons or armor.

Arcane Nondetection (Ex): A jordain vizier undergoes mental

and physical training to make him diculttodetectwitharcane

divination spells and items. This ability functions exactly like

the nondetection spell, except that it works only against arcane

magic. The DC to overcome this nondetection ability is 15 + the

characters jordain vizier level + his Cha modier.

Arcane Spell Resistance (Ex): A jordain vizier has spell

resistance against arcane magic equal to 10 + the characters

jordain vizier level + his Cha modier.

Eidetic Memory (Ex): Jordain viziers are trained so deeply in

various forms of mnemonics that their skills become subconscious.

They collect knowledge from all disciplines and can process it

in a deductive way that deesexplanation.Thisabilityhasthree

functions: recollection of knowledge and perceptions, committing

specic things to memory, and making accurate conclusions.

Zurleau, a Jordain vizier

Prestige Classes

Through years of study, with the intention of becoming of

the greatest use to his wizard master, a jordain vizier gains the

ability to know legends or information regarding various topics,

just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. The jordain vizier adds

his jordain vizier level + his Int modier to a lore check, which

functions otherwise exactly like a bardic knowledge check. See

page 28 of the Players Handbook for more information on bardic

knowledge. If a jordain vizier has levels in bard, loremaster, or

another class that grants an ability similar to bardic knowledge,

those class levels stack for the purpose of determining the

ecacy of this aspect of eidetic memory. Table 26: Eidetic

Memory shows additional example DCs for recalling or knowing

a particular fact.

A jordain vizier can also commit an item to memory with

perfect accuracy. He can store a number of items equal to his

jordain vizier level + his Int modier.Thejordainviziercandrop

older items in favor of new ones. Dropped items can be recalled

as if they were other types of memories, using the DCs on Table

26: Eidetic Memory.

conversation; which spells aect a particular kind of golem.

daughter; word-for-word recollection of an entire conversation;

the resistances and immunities of various outsiders.

Finally, the jordain vizier can use his honed memory to

make lightning-fast deductions based on only the slightest clues,

patterns, or scraps of information. He can make reasonable state-

ments about a person, place, or object, from seemingly little

knowledge. However, this ability is the result of a rigorously logical

process, involving recalling and correlating every possible piece

Table 27: The Jordain Vizier

of data with bearing on the topic. The nature of the knowledge

the jordain vizier gains is subject to DM discretion, but might

include the answer to a riddle, the way out of maze, or even a

conclusion concerning a dilemma. An eidetic memory check,

with a bonus equal to the characters jordain vizier level + his

Int modier,mustbemadetocompilethedesiredinformation.

The DM secretly determines the DC.

Bonus Language (Ex): During their laborious studies, jordain

viziers learn new languages to access more knowledge and better

serve their wizard masters. The jordain vizier can choose a new

language at 2nd and 4th level.

Combat Insight (Ex): Due to their quick, deductive minds and

extensive training, jordain viziers can predict an opponents next

move to some extent. Jordain viziers gain a +1 insight bonus on

attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. At 4th level,

the bonuses increase to +2.

Counterspell (Su): While jordain viziers do not learn to cast

spells, beginning at 3rd level, they learn to direct their spell resis-

tance outward. This, combined with their knowledge of wizardry

and how to disrupt spells, gives them the ability to prepare to

counterspell an arcane spell as a ready action. (For more informa-

tion on counterspells, see page 170 of the Players Handbook.)

Like a spellcaster, a jordain vizier must select an opponent

as the target of the counterspell and ready an action to counter

her spell. When the opponent tries to cast a spell, a vizier makes

a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spells level) as a free action to

identify the opponents spell. Unlike a spellcaster, to complete the

action, the jordain vizier must make a special class level check

(1d20 + jordain vizier level) that equals or exceeds 5 + the spells

caster level. If successful, the jordain vizier negates the arcane

spell with no other results. The jordain vizier can only counter-

spell spells of a level equal to or less than his jordain vizier level

+ his Cha modier, and he can only attempt to counterspell a

number of times per day equal to the same number. This power

is Weave-based and can be aectedbyShadowWeavefeatsand

magic just as any other Weave magic.

An ex-jordain vizier who gains the ability to counterspell as

a spellcaster must choose, after making his Spellcraft check, to

counterspell either as a jordain vizier or as his spellcaster class.

The abilities do not stack in any way.

Aide-de-Camp (Ex): Jordain viziers eventually become indis-

pensable assistants to their masters. At 5th level, the character

doubles his Intelligence and Wisdom bonuses (if any) for the pur-

poses of eidetic memory and all appropriate class skill checks.

Prestige Classes

Grace (Ex): At 5th level, jordain viziers become more resistant

to the eects of magic. The character can apply his Charisma

bonus (if any) as a bonus on saving throws against supernatural

abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities.

Code of Conduct: Jordain viziers are indoctrinated to never

lie, never utilize spells (or magic items that produce spell-like

eects), and obey Halruaan wizards, authorities, and laws.

The punishment for breaking these rules is usually death. All

Jordaini are rendered infertile upon graduation, so no jordain

vizier can have children. Jordain viziers seldom handle money

on the theory that they are less likely to be corrupted by its

lure. They are taught to value the philosophical over the mate-

rial and rely on their wizard masters to handle most of their

material needs.

Multiclass Note: Most jordain viziers multiclass in expert,

monk, and/or ghter.Jordainvizierscanaddlevelsinanyofthese

classes without losing the ability to advance as a monk. This is

an exception to the rule in the Ex-Monks section, page 42 of the

Players Handbook. Violating this expanded limit by multiclassing

into a class other than those listed above ends the jordain viziers

development as a monk, as described in the standard rules. Such

multiclassing does not end the jordain viziers development as a

jordain vizier.

Some jordain viziers multiclass as rogues or sorcerers,

though the latter choice almost assuredly forces them out of

the jordain order and makes them fugitives hunted by the deadly

magehounds.

Ex-Jordain Viziers: A jordain vizier who becomes nonlawful

cannot gain further levels as a jordain vizier, but he retains all

jordain vizier abilities. In addition, a jordain vizier who gets

caught violating the code of conduct can be thrown out of the

jordain order, thereby preventing him from gaining new levels

in this class. Unfortunately, such banishment is more rare than

a death sentence.

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

it to slow his descent while falling. Zurleau takes damage as if

of the enchantment school.

Possessions: Amulet of natural armor +1 (with symbol of

House Jordain).

Luiren Marchwarden

The Luiren marchwarden is the defender of the frontier in

the land of the halings. In Luiren, much of the territory

is still verdant and untamed. The hin rarely settle down for

long stretches, but their communities are still threatened by

encroaching monsters and would-be invaders from other lands.

The halingsneedprotectorstowatchoverthemandkeepdangers

from slipping past the borders unobserved. Such is the task of

the Luiren marchwarden.

Rangers and druids are best suited to become marchwardens,

but sometimes other classes choose this path. Of those classes,

only wizards and sorcerers truly lack the defensive instincts

necessary to carry out the tasks of the marchwarden eectively.

Barbarians are unusual in Luiren, and thus they are also rare

as marchwardens.

Marchwardens work alone and in small groups. Either way,

they accept responsibility for a specicregionofthecountryside,

and they consider it their duty to defend that plot of landand

the halings who reside on itfrom any and all threats. They

seldom roam beyond their home territory, because many of

their abilities and powers are tied to the region where they

stand vigilant.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a Luiren marchwarden, a character must

fulll all the following criteria.

Race: Haling.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Knowledge (Luiren local) 5 ranks, Knowledge (geog-

raphy) 8 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Investigator, Track

Spells: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

Region: Luiren

Class Skills

The Luiren marchwardens class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str),

Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (Luiren local) (Int),

Prestige Classes

Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival

(Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Luiren marchwarden

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: A Luiren marchwarden

gains no prociency with any weapons or armor.

March Bonus (Ex): A Luiren marchwarden

gets a morale bonus on saves and to Armor Class

whenever he  is within the boundary of his march

(see Sanctify March, below). He also

gets this bonus on Hide, Knowledge

(nature), Listen, Move Silently,

Spot, and Survival checks while

within his march. This bonus

starts at +2 and improves with

every odd marchwarden level, until

it reaches +4 at 5th level.

Sanctify  March  (Ex):  A  Luiren

marchwarden establishes a territory,

called  a  march,  which  is  his  to

defend against all threats. This

march is an area 5 miles per

marchwarden level in a radius

from a central pointusually

the center of a village or town,

but sometimes an unusual place,

such as a sacred grove or a waterfall.

To consider a location for his march,

a marchwarden must know the terrain

exceptionally well (as indicated by

the skill requirements for this

class). While a marchwarden is

within his sanctied march,

he  gains  all  the  additional

abilities and bonuses of the class as

specied below.

fully vested immediately. The rstweekaLuirenmarchwarden

occupies his new march, he has only the benets of a 1st-level

marchwarden. During the second week, the benetsduea2nd-

level marchwarden activate, and so on each week, until the

maximum benets of the marchwardens own level function.

The moment a marchwarden establishes a new march, he loses

all benets in the old one.

Detect Evil (Sp): A Luiren marchwarden can use detect evil

at will while inside the boundary of his sanctied march.

Share March Bonus (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a Luiren

marchwarden can share the morale bonuses he gains from his

march bonus ability with a single ally within 30 feet. Sharing

the march bonus is a free action that can be performed at will,

but a marchwarden must be able to see his ally at the time the

ability is activated. The eect lasts until the target is out of

range or until the Luiren marchwarden ends it as a

free action.

Easy Trail (Su): From 2nd level on, any

time a Luiren marchwarden is inside the

boundary of his sanctied march, he can

move through all types of terrain as though

under the eects of an easy trail spell. This spell

Prestige Classes

Maquar Crusader

The Maquar are the noble class of warriors in the nation of

Estagund that exist for one purposedevoted service to the rajah

of that land. A Maquar crusader follows a strict code of conduct

that not only limits what he can own or where he can live, but also

limits the ways in which merchants can inuencehim.Tradition-

ally, Maquar crusaders are charged with protection of the royal

house and family, defense of the nation, and consultation on battle

tactics. They are both powerful champions, capable of impressive

combat prowess with the falchion, and renowned defenders, skilled

at protecting those who cannot defend themselves.

Fighters and paladins make up the bulk of recruits to the

ranks of the Maquar, though rangers and clerics sometimes hear

the call to serve the rajah. Members of few other classes have

the combination of dedication, military skill, and discipline to

succeed as Maquar crusaders.

Maquar crusaders usually operate in groups, though these can

be small elite units tasked with specic jobssuch as security

for the rajahs daughteror in larger forces during times of

war. A lone Maquar crusader might be sent on a serious mission

in the service of his rajah, perhaps as a guardian for diplomats.

At these times, the crusader might welcome the companionship

of adventurers, though some nd the Maquars strict code of

conduct inconvenient at times.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a Maquar crusader, a character must fulll

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good or lawful neutral.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (nobility and royalty) 4 ranks.

Feats:  Alertness,  Combat  Expertise,  Weapon  Focus

(falchion).

Patron Deity: The Adama.

Region: The Golden Water.

Special: The character must have a reputation as an honorable

and dedicated person. He must spend one full month living by

Table 29: The Maquar Crusader

the standards of the Maquar crusaders code of conduct before

being admitted into the Maquar.

Class Skills

The Maquar crusaders class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),

Jump (Str), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis),

and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modier.

Class Features

Weapon and Armor Prociency: Maquar crusaders are pro-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, all types of armor,

and shields.

Uncanny Loyalty (Ex): The Maquar crusaders unswerving

dedication and loyalty to his duty makes him diculttocorrupt

or inuence.Beginningat1stlevel,hegainsa+1resistancebonus

on Will saves against all mind-aecting spells and spell-like

abilities; this bonus increases as the crusader gains levels, until

it reaches +4 at 10th level.

Harms Way (Ex): A Maquar crusader can elect to place

himself in the path of danger to protect a single ally, called

his charge. Anytime the crusader is within 5 feet of his charge,

and the charge is subject to an attack, the crusader can elect to

switch places with her and take the attack in her place (the two

physically switch spaces). The crusader must declare his intent

to switch places with his charge before the attack roll is made.

A charge can be selected as a free action when the crusader rolls

initiative at the beginning of a combat and cannot be changed

for the duration of that combat. The Maquar crusader can only

use this ability if his charge is one size category larger than he

is, or smaller.

Greater Weapon Focus: Maquar crusaders receive Greater

Weapon Focus (falchion) as a bonus feat.

Smite (Su): Once per day, a Maquar crusader of 2nd level or

higher can make a single melee attack with a +4 attack bonus and

smite is usable two times per day, increasing to three times per

day at 9th level.

Allied Defense: A 3rd-level Maquar crusader gains Allied

Defense (see page 19) as a bonus feat.

Defensive Strike (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a Maquar crusader

can make an attack of opportunity against an adjacent opponent

who attacks his charge in melee. The crusader is still limited

to one attack of opportunity

per round, unless he has the

Combat Reexesfeat.Hegains

a +1 bonus on this attack for

every three levels above 4th.

DeectAttack(Ex): Begin-

ning at 5th level, the Maquar

crusader can attempt to parry a

melee attack against his charge.

To attempt this, he must be with-

in 5 feet of his charge, aware of

the impending attack, not at-foot-

ed, and holding a melee weapon or

shield capable of deectingtheattack.

Once per round when his charge would

normally be hit with a melee weapon,

the crusader can make a Reexsave(DC

20 + attacking weapons magic enhancement

bonus [if any]). If he succeeds, he deectsthe

blow as a free action, rendering it harmless.

At 8th level, the Maquar crusader gains a

+1 competence bonus on this Reexsave.

Code of Conduct: The Maquar crusader

must adhere to a strict code of conduct at

all times or risk being expelled from the

Maquar and losing his honored status within

society. A Maquar cannot own anything

other than the clothes he wears, his

armor, his sword, and a small amount

of personal eects that he can carry

himself. (Maquar crusaders hailing from

the paladin class can keep their special mounts

and the gear required for riding.) He has no home

other than the one his rajah supplies him. It is the

rajahs responsibility to provide for a Maquar crusader (one cannot

hold a job other than as a crusader), but he is expected to assist

the public in a time of need, whether that means defending the

rajah from assassins or helping to build a new public building

in a small village. A Maquar crusader cannot take payment for

his service, whether in coin or other material goods, but he can

ask for a single nights hospitality from any citizen when he

is away from his usual quarters. The Maquar are expected to

obey the rajah (or a leader he appoints to operate on his behalf)

unquestioningly.

Multiclass Note: A character who was a paladin before

joining the Maquar crusader prestige class can freely add levels

of Maquar crusader without losing the ability to advance as a

paladin, so long as he continues to meet all other requirements

for maintaining paladin status. This is an exception to the rule

in the Ex-Paladins section, page 44 of the Players Handbook.

Violating this expanded limit by multiclassing into a class other

than Maquar crusader ends the characters development as a

paladin, as described in the standard rules. Such multiclassing does

not end the characters development as a Maquar crusader.

becoming a scourge maiden, she must decide to which class to

add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Weapon Focus: A scourge maiden receives Weapon Focus

(scourge) as a bonus feat.

Bane (Sp): At 2nd level and above, a scourge maiden can ll

her enemies with fear and doubt. This ability, usable three times

per day, duplicates the eects of the bane spell, with a save DC

can evoke great sadness. Three times per day, the

scourge maiden can use crushing despair, with a

Stunning Strike (Ex): Beginning at 4th

level, a scourge maiden can stun an op-

ponent with a blow from her scourge. She

must declare that she is using this ability

before she makes her attack roll (thus, a

failed attack roll ruins the attempt). This

ability forces a foe damaged by the scourge

maidens attack to make a Fortitude saving

throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the scourge maidens char-

acter level + the maidens Wis modier), in

addition to dealing damage normally. An

opponent who fails this saving throw is

stunned for 1 round (until just before the

scourged maidens next action). A stunned

character cant act, loses any Dexterity

bonus to AC, and takes a 2 penalty to AC.

A scourge maiden can attempt a stunning

attack once per day for every scourge maiden

level she has attained, and no more than once

per round. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead,

incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune

to critical hits cannot be stunned.

Painful  Strike  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  the

scourge maiden can cause great pain with her scourge

attacks. She can spend one of her stunning strike

daily uses to subject the target of her scourge to such debilitating

pain that he is nauseated for 2 rounds. A successful Fortitude save

course, the most prevalent magic of all is that of the wizards of

Halruaa, who do not sell their secrets, but are certainly interested

in buying everyone elses. The clerics of the Adama in Durpar

hold sway over their ock with a dierent kind of magic, but

one that holds sway in the everyday practice of trade.

Secrets of the South

Secret magic is not so widespread in the South as in other parts

of Faern, but no culture guards its magical research and ability

as jealously as the wizards of Halruaa, partly out of fear that

such power could lead to another cataclysm like the fall of ancient

Netheril, and partly out of greed.

Rune Magic

Rune magic is an ancient form of the Art considered unrenedby

many practitioners today, but it still has its adherents. In the Great

Rift, many dwarves still retain the old ways of harnessing magic

through the crafting of runes, a practice they use to aid in defend-

ing their homeland from the vile terrors of the Underdark.

Rune magic is described in Chapter 2 of the Forgotten

Realms Campaign Setting. Numerous gold dwarf (and a few

Shaaryan) clerics learn the Inscribe Rune feat, and a sizable

portion of them take up the mantle of runecaster. Most of

these remain within the connes of their home territories, but

others set out on the road and oer their services abroad. Few

demonstrate the power of runes to any other than their most

trusted servants.

In some parts of the South, rune magic is seen as a wicked

power, because it is in the hands of dangerous creatures. A few

among the lizardfolk of Rethild have learned rune magic, as have

some ogres in the Toadsquat Mountains and some giant clans in

the Dustwall.

The Shadow Weave

Few folk are really sure just how prevalent wielders of the Shadow

Weave actually are in the Shining South. No one would actually

confess to any prociency in the dark side of magic, though

rumors abound that a cult of Shadow Weave users is growing in

power in the highest ranks of the Council of Elders in Halruaa.

Such tales claim that this secret organization has designs on

overthrowing the established regime and all who serve Mystra

and Azuth, replacing it with their own members. Nearly half

of the rumblings suggest that the fabled Conclave of Halruaa,

a second secretive organization of wizards, is on the verge of

exposing the shadow wizards. Just as many claim that the two

groups are in league or, even more insidious, one and the same.

The only certainty is very few know the truth, and none of those

who do are admitting anything.

Divination

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

With a touch, you instantly determine if a creature can cast

arcane spells and the maximum spell level it can cast.

Brittleskin

Transmutation

Level: Druid 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You cause a creatures natural armor to crystallize and become

brittle. Whenever the aected creature is hit in combat, part of

the crystallized hide cracks and shatters, dealing it additional lethal

damage equal to its natural armor bonus. Thus, if a creature with

+3 natural armor is aectedbythisspell,ittakesanextra3points

of damage each time it is struck by a melee, ranged, or natural

weapon. The creatures actual Armor Class does not change.

Circlet of Enervation

Necromancy

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Eect: 6-inch circlet of negative energy

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You form a small ring of negative energy in your hand, which

harms neither you nor your equipment. The circlet launches from

your hand, and you must succeed on a ranged touch attack to

strike your target. A struck creature takes 2d6 points of damage

and gains one negative level (a Fortitude save negates the negative

level). No sooner do you hurl the circlet than another one appears

in your hand, ready to be launched again on your next turn.

Negative levels from circlet of enervation function exactly

like those gained from the enervation spell.

44

Magic and Spells

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell heals

2d6 points of damage when it strikes an undead, rather than

harming it. Further, each time an undead creature is struck by

the circlet, it gains 5 temporary hit points. The spell has no eect

on constructs or inanimate objects.

Focus: A jet bracelet worth 100 gp.

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5ft./2 levels)

Area: Up to a 10-ft. cube/level (S)

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Eect: 5 ft. cube of coral/level (S)

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You cause living, submerged

coral to grow at an accelerated

pace in a shape you control.

Since you control the form,

you can cause the coral to

grow into a wall, a large

ball, and so forth. You are

limited in the size of the new

coral, but this is not dependent

upon the amount of existing materiala

tiny piece can be used as a starter seed for

the new growth, so long as that piece

is alive.

Coral growth is popular for con-

structing buildings and statues out of

coral in Halruaa. It is also a favorite

of various aquatic races for building

underwater cities.

Material Component: A small

piece of coral.

Daltims Fiery

Tentacles

Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Saving Throw: None and Reex half; see text

This spell functions similarly to Evards black tentacles, except

that the tentacles are limned in blue-white re. Every creature

within the area of the spell takes 1 point of redamagepercaster

level (maximum 15 points) each round. A successful Reexsave

halves this damage, but a character grappled by the tentacles

cannot make the save.

Darssons Chilling Chamber

Evocation [Cold]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

You lower the temperature in the aected area to the level of

extreme cold (as dened under Cold Dangers, page 302 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide). For every minute spent in the area, a

creature vulnerable to cold takes 1d6

points of lethal damage (no save).

In addition, a creature must

make a Fortitude save (DC

15, +1 per previous check) or

take 1d4 points of nonlethal

damage. Those wearing

metal armor, as well as those

coming in contact with metal

that has been in the area for at

least 1 hour, are aectedasif

by a chill metal spell.

This spell was original-

ly developed as a means of

preserving food (cast inside

cellars), but wizards quickly

determined that it could be used as a

deterrent (on long hallways or in treasure

vaults, for example) or for creating

a comfortable environment for

cold-loving pets.

Darssons chilling chamber

can be made permanent with

a permanency spell.

Darssons Cooling

Breeze

Evocation [Air]

Level: Druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Brittleskin

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Eect: Line-shaped breeze emanating out from a point you

designate within 10 feet of you to the extreme of the range

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a light breeze (approximately 9 mph) that originates

from a point you designate, aectingallcreatures,gasses,clouds,

and fogs in its path. Any airborne vapors, fumes, clouds, smoke,

and gasses drift away from the point at a speed of 80 feet per

round and dissipate in one-fourth the normal time.

In addition to the eects noted, the cooling breeze can do

anything that a normal breeze would be expected to do. It can

45

move wind chimes, scatter pieces of paper or parchment, cause

candle or hearth ames to icker, and so forth.

Darssons cooling breeze can be made permanent with a

permanency spell.

Darssons Fiery Furnace

Evocation [Fire]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: Up to one 10-ft. cube/level (S)

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You raise the temperature in the aected area to the level of

extreme heat (as denedunderHeatDangers,page303ofthe

Dungeon Masters Guide). For every minute spent breathing the

air in the area, a creature vulnerable to heat takes 1d6 points of

lethal damage (no save). In addition, the creature must make a

Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check)

or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy

clothing or any sort of armor take a 4 penalty on their saves.

In addition, those wearing metal armor, as well as those coming

in contact with metal that has been in the area for at least 1

hour, are aected as if by a heat metal spell.

This spell was originally developed as a means of cooking

food (cast inside cauldrons, brick ovens, and smoke houses), but

wizards quickly determined that it could be used as a deterrent (on

long hallways or in treasure vaults, for example) or for creating

a comfortable environment for heat-loving pets.

Darssons ery furnace can be made permanent with a

permanency spell.

Dispel Fog

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: Up to four 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

Duration: 1 min./level; see text

Saving Throw: Fortitude half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You make normal or magical fog within the aected area

instantly and completely vanish. This spell is eective against

fog and mist from any source, including spells such as obscuring

mist or cloudkill, but not against bodies of water, precipitation,

or smoke. The dispelled area stays clear for 1 minute per level

regardless of other conditionsafter that, it can ll in again if

there is sucient fog in the surrounding vicinity. Natural fog

is automatically cleared in the aectedarea;naturalfogreform

within 1 minute after the expiration of the spell. Magical fog

(such as that from a fog cloud spell) requires you to make a

dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against

the spell to clear the area. The DC for this dispel check is 11 +

the spells caster level. Success means the spell is dispelled in the

area you designate, but magic fogs covering large areas might

not be completely cleared away by dispel fog.

Creatures in fog or mist form who are in the area must succeed

on a Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage. Even those

who make their saves must immediately assume another shape.

Easy Trail

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You radiate energy that gently pushes plants aside, allowing easy

(see Table 95: Terrain and Overland Movement, page 164 of the

Players Handbook). Once you have passed, plants return to their

normal shapes. The DC to track anyone who traveled within the

eect is increased by 5 (the equivalent of hiding the trail).

This spell cannot push or hold plant creatures aside.

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

to strike with each beam, and one that hits deals 4d6 points of

re damage.

You need not use your eye rays while the spell is in eect;other

actions, such as spellcasting, can be performed. However, each

checks. The en-

hancement bonus

increases to +20

at caster level

10th, and to +30 (the

Land Womb

Abjuration

Level: Druid 4, hathran 4, ranger 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: You and one other creature/level

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)

47

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You descend into a protective bubble in the earth 10 feet below

where you are standing. It appears as though the ground opened

up and swallowed you. A land womb only opens through tillable

soil, not rock.

One additional creature per caster level can accompany you

into the land womb. Such creatures must be touching one another,

with at least one touching you (a ring of hands, for instance).

Creatures inside the land womb can breath

and speak normally, but the space is

too tight to move about in or cast

spells  with  somatic

components. The

surface above the

land  womb  cannot

be sensed without magical

means, and anything within

t h e   l a n d   w o m b

cannot be detected by

At  the  end  of  the

duration,  or  upon

spot  where  it

spell took eect.

Eect: Fog spreads in a 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Reex half

Spell Resistance: No

You conjure a smoky cloud that llstheareawithsmallelectrical

discharges. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In

addition, the discharges deal 1d4 points of electricity damage plus

1 point per caster level (maximum +15) to everything within the

cloud on your turn each round.

As with a fog cloud spell, wind disperses the smoke, and the

spell cant be cast underwater.

Magic and Spells

Mycontils Last Resort

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Area: 30-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You unleash deadly explosive power, similar to the eects of a

retributive strike created by breaking a staofpower(see page

245 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information). The

spell converts any remaining spell slots in your mind into a blast

of magical energy. All creatures within 10 feet of you take 8

points of damage per spell slot remaining, creatures between 11

and 20 feet take 6 points per spell slot, and creatures between

21 and 30 feet take 4 points per remaining spell slot. You take

maximum damage and are allowed no saving throw.

It is widely thought that Mycontil and his assistants used this

spell in a circle magic ceremony to defeat the Arkaiun barbarian

chieftain, Reinhar I of Dambrath, during Dambraths invasion

of Halruaa. Mycontil and his assistants vanished after the blast

and were presumed destroyed. There has been no other recorded

use of the spell.

Material Component: The nger bone of an archmage that

has been packed in diamond dust worth 5,000 gp for 1 week.

Protection from Winged Flyers

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 1, druid 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: No; see text

The spell functions like protection from evil, except that the

bonuses apply to attacks from creatures that have wings and a

yspeed.Summonedcreaturesthatywithwingscannottouch

the subject. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this

protection and touch the warded creature.

Arcane Material Component: A feather or bat wing.

Redirect Spell

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3, paladin 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a magical connection between you and an ally such

that any spells targeting the ally (rather than an area or eect)

are redirected to you. For example, magic missiles cast at your

ally target you instead.

Both you and your ally must be within range of a spell for the

redirect to occur. If your ally is within range of the caster but you are

not, the spell targets your ally normally. Should you and the subject

of the spell move out of range of each other, the spell ends.

Rock Catch

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 2, ranger 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

A single creature you touch gains the ability to catch hurled rocks

of Small to Large size (including projectiles of a similar shape

and size, such as catapult ammunition). Once per round, as an

immediate action (a free action taken during another creatures

turn), when the subject of this spell would normally be hit by a

rock, he can make a Reex save to catch it. The DC for catching

a Small or smaller rock is 15, 20 for a Medium one, and 25 for

a Large one. Caught rocks must be subsequently dropped as part

of the action.

Rockburst

Evocation

Level: Cleric 3, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 20-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reex half or Fortitude negates; see text

Spell Resistance: No

You cause a stone object, with volume of at least 8 cubic feet, to

explode. Rock shards y outward from the detonation, and all

creatures within the area of the spell take 1d4 points of damage

plus 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). A successful Reex

save halves this damage.

A magic stone object, or a nonmagic stone object in the pos-

session of another creature, gets a Fortitude save to negate the

eect. Creatures cannot be aected by rockburst.

Safe Clearing

Abjuration

Level: Ranger 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Touch

Area: 30-ft.-radius spread

48

Magic and Spells

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You make an area safe from attacks, as if the entire space

were under a sanctuary spell. Once the spell is cast, its area

is immobile.

Any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise directly

attack a creature within the area, even with a targeted spell,

must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can

attack normally and is unaected by the spell. If the save fails,

the opponent cannot follow through with the attack, that part

of its action is lost, and it cant directly attack anyone in the safe

clearing for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to

attack creatures inside the warded area remain unaected.This

spell does not prevent the warded creatures from being aected

by area or eect spells.

Those inside the safe clearing cannot attack without breaking

the spell, even if they are unaected by it.

Sea Legs

Transmutation

Level: Bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You grant a creature the ability to maneuver easily while aboard

ship, even during inclement weather. Any creature aected by

a sea legs spell automatically succeeds on Balance checks (DC

20 or lower) made due to sloped surfaces and slightly slippery

conditions. Furthermore, the creature can move at its normal

speed while balancing on a ships deck, rather than half speed.

See the Balance skill description in the Players Handbook for

more information.

Shuffle

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: One or more willing creatures touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You grant one creature, plus one additional creature for every ve

caster levels, the ability to teleport a short distance as a move

action. Each subject can use the ability once per round, on its

turn, to travel to a spot it knows intimately or can see, which

can be no more than 5 feet per two caster levels away (maximum

50 feet at 20th level). Creatures aected by this spell can carry

objects, as long as the weight of those objects doesnt exceed the

subjects maximum load. If a subject of shue would arrive

in an area occupied by solid material, that attempted teleport

simply fails.

Sparkles

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: 10-ft.-radius/level spread

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: None

You create a cloud of multicolored, sparkling motes that shower

down and attach to any living creature in the area. The sparkles

visibly outline anything to which they stick, cannot be removed

by nonmagical means, continue to twinkle and glow until the

spell fades, and visibly outline invisible things in the area for the

duration of the spell. Any creature covered by motes takes a 40

penalty on Hide checks.

This spell is popular during festivals in Halruaa, where the

wizards cast it over the cities from their skyships and let the motes

decorate the celebrants. However, others have found more practical

uses for it, including exposing invisible and hiding foes.

Arcane Material Component: A pinch of ground mica.

Sticks and Stones

Necromancy

Level: Cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One Small pile of debris

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You animate a pile of rocks, branches, limbs, and other debris

into the crude shape of a skeletal creature of Medium size

that immediately attacks whatever foe you designate. You can

change the animated creatures chosen target as a move action.

The creatures combat statistics are those of a 2 HD humanoid

Magic and Spells

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Sticks and stones

You cause a block of stone to turn invisible and hover at a designated

point in the air. The stone remains there until triggered, either by

special conditions set by you or by a command word you choose.

Once triggered, the stone trap turns visible and falls naturally.

The stone of the stone trap can be positioned so that it

holds up additional material within the weight limit of the

spell. For example, a 2,200-

pound stone with stone trap

cast on it by a 13th-level

cleric could support

an  additional  400

pounds. This addi-

tional weight could be

placed on top of the

stone in midair, the

stone could function

as a plug in a hole in

a ceiling, and so on.

As a trap, the sus-

pended stone has an

attack bonus equal to your

caster level. Any creatures hit

by the stone when it falls

take 1d6 points of damage

for every 200 pounds of

weight, plus 1d6 points

of damage for every 10

feet the stone falls,

for a maximum of

20d6 points of dam-

age. Anything atop the

stone might deal addi-

tional damage, but

such supplementary

material  can  only  deal

damage above and beyond the maximum

(20d6) if it doesnt rely on the fall to deal that damage.

The conditions for triggering a stone trap can be as simple

or as elaborate as you desire. Special conditions can be based on

a creatures name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be

based on observable actions or qualities. Other intangibles such as

level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points dont qualify. For example,

a stone trap can be set to activate when a lawful evil creature

approaches, but not when a blackguard approaches.

Arcane  Material  Component:  A  drop  of  blood  and  a

pebble.

Stonefire

Evocation [Fire]

Level: Cleric 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Area: One 5-ft. square + one 5-ft. square/four levels

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You cause natural, nonliving stone to combust, emitting thick

black smoke and sending forth waves of heat. Anyone touching

the burning rock takes 2d6 points of re damage each round,

while the intense heat coming from the stone deals 2d4 points

of re damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of

re damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet.

The burning stone deals its

damage to all creatures in the

area when it appears and on

your turn each round. Un-

dead take double damage

from stonere.

Ignited stone is consumed by

the ames at the rate of 1 foot of

thickness per round (so a 10-foot-

thick wall covered with stonere

would require 10 rounds to burn through).

Burning away load-bearing walls, columns,

or other supports might cause cave-ins or

collapses. See Cave-Ins and Collapses, page

66 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

If the burning stone takes 20 points

of cold damage or more in 1 round, the

without your concentration, hovering in the same space as the

target with a readied touch attack. Whenever the target next takes

any sort of action, the streamer makes a touch attack against

it (at the casters base attack bonus). On a successful attack roll,

follows. You can mentally direct the object to move up or down

as much as 45 feet each round for the duration of the spell; doing

so is a move action. When you cease concentration, the object

remains in place for the duration of the spell.

Material Component: A small leather loop suspended from a

bent wire of gold.

Tidal Wave

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M, XP

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: A wave 75 ft. high and 500 ft. wide

Duration: 1 min./level; see text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You create a moving wall of water that can drown swimmers,

swamp ships, and oodportcities.Uponcompletionofthespell,

the tidal wave forms and moves from the starting point you desig-

nate in the direction you specify at a speed of 150 feet per round

for the duration of the spell, or until it strikes land. Any creature

swimming in the water as the tidal wave hits it must make a DC

30 Swim check each round to remain aoat.Creaturesthatsuc-

ceed are washed forward by the tidal wave and must continue to

make Swim checks each round. Creatures that fail the check are

sucked beneath the tidal wave and forced 8d10 feet below the

surface of the water, taking 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. The

wave passes over submerged creatures, which are subject to drown-

ing (see page 304 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Any Medium or smaller ship caught in the path of the tidal

wave takes 6d10 points of damage, while larger ships take an

additional 6d10 points of damage per size category they are

larger than Medium. Furthermore, the ship is carried along by

the tidal wave for a number of feet equal to the number of points

of damage taken 5. For example, a sailing ship that takes 66

points of damage is carried in the surge of the wave for 330 feet.

If the movement of the ship results in a collision with another

ship or with land, the ship takes additional damage (see below).

Any creatures and equipment aboard the ship that are not lashed

down are swept othedecksandintothesea(andcreaturesare

then subject to the Swim checks noted above).

If a tidal wave drives up onto shore, it deals 6d10 points of

damage to everything in its path within 200 feet of the shore, 3d10

points of damage to everything farther than 200 feet but within

400 feet of the shore, and 1d10 points of damage to everything

farther than 400 feet but within 1,000 feet of shore. Any ships

in port or washed ahead of the tidal wave take 6d10 points of

damage in addition to any taken for being struck by the wave (see

above) and end up 5d1010 feet inland when they come to rest.

Material Component: A plank of wood smacked against the

surface of the water.

XP Cost: 500 XP.

per caster level (to a maximum of 15d4) per round to anyone

caught in it.

Focus: A miniature scourge.

T he wizards of Halruaa are every bit as skilled as

those of Thay in crafting magic items, but the

Halruaans ociallyexportnothing,guardingthe

secrets and results of their workmanship quite closely. Still, the

products of their expertise have found their way beyond the Walls

and into distant lands. The gold dwarves of the Great Rift also

make remarkable items that they sell in their surface markets on a

regular basis. Spellcasters among Dambraths Crinti manufacture

sinister objects designed for macabre entertainment and war, while

the Durpari make up for what they dont construct with the

prolic amounts of magic they import from distant lands.

Magic Items

In addition to the magic items presented in the Dungeon

Masters Guide and any other items in an ongoing Forgotten

Realms campaign, the following magic items can be found in

as an arachnid or an insect); this feature is entirely decorative

and has no other eect on the armor.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

mass charm monster; Price +49,000 gp.

Weapons

As a place where certain nations can trace their roots back to

some of the most powerful spell-using cultures in the history

of Faern, the Shining South is the source of a wide variety of

new magic weapons.

Magic Weapon Special Abilities

A magic weapon with a special ability must have at least a +1

enhancement bonus.

Enervating: An enervating weapon is particularly insidious and

favored by dark-hearted cultures such as that found in Dambrath

or Veldorn. On a critical hit, a creature hit by an enervating

weapon takes damage and also gains one negative level, and that

creature dies if it has total negative levels equal to or exceeding its

HD. Spell resistance applies. If the creature survives, any negative

level bestowed by this weapon is removed after 13 hours. Undead

struck by an enervating weapon take weapon damage normally,

but they also gain 5 temporary hit points instead of a negative

level. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the enervating

ability upon their ammunition.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

enervation; Price +3 bonus.

Weakening: Weakening weapons deal 1 point of Strength

damage in addition to their regular damage with each successful

attack. Spell resistance applies. This weakness lasts for 10 minutes,

and multiple strikes on the same creature are cumulative, but

the creatures Strength score cannot drop below 1 as a result

of this ability. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the

weakening power upon their ammunition.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, ray of enfeeblement; Price +3 bonus.

Exhausting: Any creature struck by an exhausting weapon

must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or become fatigued for 5

minutes. Spell resistance applies. The ability has no eect on

creatures that are already fatigued or those immune to fatigue.

Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the exhausting

ability upon their ammunition.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

ray of exhaustion; Price +1 bonus.

Paralyzing: On a successful critical hit, a paralyzing weapon

renders any living creature immobile for 10 rounds unless it

succeeds on DC 17 a Will save. Each round on its turn, the para-

lyzed creature gets a new saving throw to break the eect.Spell

resistance applies. Creatures immune to mind-aectingmagicare

immune to this property. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted

confer the paralyzing ability upon their ammunition.

Moderate enchantment; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, hold monster; Price +2 bonus.

Rusting: A rusting weapon is never constructed of any iron

parts, but must be built of wood, bone, stone, or other nonfer-

rous materials. When it is employed, it can cause metal objects

with which it comes into contact to quickly rust. A wearer of

a ferrous armor or shield that is struck by a rusting weapon

must make a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or the item loses

1 point of armor bonusshields are struck rst. Once an item

loses its entire armor bonus, it falls to pieces, ruined. Bows,

crossbows, and slings so crafted confer the rusting ability upon

their ammunition.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, rusting grasp; Price +1 bonus.

Specific Magic Weapons

The following weapons are usually constructed with exactly the

abilities described here.

Great Rift Blazing Skylance: This +2 lance is specically

designed for use by Great Rift skyguards. Three times per day,

the lance can be commanded to re a cone of searing ames

out to a distance of 15 feet from the tip, dealing 5d4 points of

blazing skylance, this +2 lance can produce a magic missile eect

on command, three times per day, ringthreemissileswitheach

use. These missiles can be aimed at up to three targets within

150 feet of the lance.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

magic missile; Price 14,334 gp.

Pick of Piercing: Crafted by the dwarves of the Great Rift,

this +1 heavy pick destroys objects made of force, such as Bigbys

forceful hand or a wall of force. To destroy such objects, the

wielder of the pick must touch them with the pick.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, disintegrate; Price 13,508 gp.

Scourge of Pain: This +1 scourge is covered in razor-sharp

barbs. Each time it strikes, it deals an extra 1d8 points of non-

lethal damage and causes agonizing pain in the creature struck.

Wondrous Items

In addition to the vast varieties of won-

drous items found elsewhere in Faern,

the following unusual magic items are

popular in the Shining South.

Amulet of Proof Against Petrication:

This amulet gives its wearer immunity to

any petrifying attack.

Strong  transmutation;  CL  11th;

Craft Wondrous Item, stone to esh;

Price 66,000 gp.

Belt of Priestly Might: Many of these

items rst appeared in Halruaa at the

end of the Time of Troubles, which the

wizards took as a sign that Mystra had

returned. Each broad leather belt has a

stamp of the holy symbol of a deity in

the front, and followers of that deity or

anyone of the deitys alignment can wear

the belt safely. (If this item is placed as

treasure, select or randomly determine

the deity to whom it is dedicated.) Any

other creature gains one negative level

from wearing the belt. The negative level

remains as long as the belt is worn. This

negative level never results in actual level

loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way

(including restoration spells) while the belt

Moderate necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, symbol of pain; Price 26,320 gp.

Stun Bolt: This +1 bolt has been specially enhanced so that it

deals normal damage and stuns a creature struck by it. A target

struck by a stun bolt must make a DC 20 Will save or be stunned

for 1d6 rounds. Creatures immune to mind-aectingspellsand

abilities are also immune to stun bolts.

Strong enchantment; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

symbol of stunning; Price (50 bolts) 9,630 gp.

Whip of Constricting: This +2 whip has the ability to entangle

and crush opponents it strikes. A Large or smaller creature struck

by the whip takes normal damage and must make a DC 15 Reex

save or become entangled, if the wielder so wishes. A creature

capable of spellcasting that is bound by the whip must make a

DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature

can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check. If youve com-

manded the whip to entangle someone, you cant continue to use

it as a weapon.

Once per day, the whips wielder may command it to con-

strict whatever it has entangled. For 17 rounds, the whip gains a

Strength score of 35 and a grapple bonus of +41. Every grapple

check that succeeds against the entangled creature deals 2d6+12

points of damage.

is worn. Three varieties of this sort of belt exist.

Belt of Priestly Might: This version grants its wearer a +2

natural armor bonus to Armor Class and a +4 enhancement

bonus to Strength.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item,

barkskin, bulls strength; Price 28,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Belt of Priestly Might and Warding: This version has all the

abilities of a belt of priestly might, plus once per day, on command, it

can create a magic circle against evil (or a magic circle against good,

if the belt is devoted to an evil deity) that lasts for 80 minutes.

Moderate transmutation; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item,

barkskin, bulls strength, magic circle against evil (or magic

circle against good); Price 41,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Belt of Holy Might: This version has all the abilities of a

belt of priestly might and warding. Its magic circle against evil

(or magic circle against good) ability lasts for 110 minutes, plus

its wearer may use a word of recall once per day, aecting only

himself and his equipment, that transports him to the nearest

temple devoted to the belts deity.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item,

barkskin, bulls strength, magic circle against evil (or magic circle

against good), word of recall; Price 70,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Dweomered Doors: A wide variety of these magic doors exist

in the Shining South, serving both benecialandbalefulpurposes.

Such doorways are widespread in Halruaa, where wizards install

them in their sanctums. These doors might come in odd shapes,

be crafted of unusual materials, and possibly have other features

55

(locks, traps, additional spells) set on them as well. The doors are

often masterfully crafted, with highly stylized motifs, but just as

many are unremarkable. Some guard valuable prizes, some block

a means of escape, and some open onto blank walls, nothing more

than a trap for the overly curious. Eight examples follow.

Animating Door: Any dead creature that falls or is carried

through a doorway of this type is temporarily animated (as the

animate dead spell) for 1d6+4 rounds. The animated creatures

function in all ways as either zombies or skeletons, depending on

the state of decomposition (DMs discretion) and attack any

other living creatures in the area.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft

Wondrous Item, animate dead;

Price 15,000 gp.

Holding Door: Doors of this

type are often constructed as an exit

from a particularly dangerous area

to give those eeing from danger

a false sense of impending escape.

When  they  pass  through  such  a

door, living creatures vulnerable to

mind-aectingspellsandabilities

must succeed on a DC 17 Will

save or be held immobile for 9

rounds. Immobilized creatures get

a new saving throw to end the

eect each round.

Moderate enchantment; CL

9th; Craft Wondrous Item, hold

monster; Price 90,000 gp.

Door of Beasts: This door is

always found shut, locked, and

adorned with an elaborate knocker or

doorknob in the shape of a beast-head

decorated with gems for eyes. Any time

the gems are disturbed, the door ies

open and emits monsters (as the summon

monster IV spell) that immediately

attack. The same happens if the

door is opened from the side of

the knocker. Summoned creatures disappear 7 rounds after

they appear, but the door has no limit to the number of

creatures it can summon.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon

monster IV; Price 56,000 gp.

Door of Derangement: Typically, this doorway aects only

every third creature that passes through it, though variations are

not uncommon. The aected creature must make a DC 17 Will

save or be blinded, deafened, and feebleminded (as the respective

spells) for 1d4+1 minutes.

Moderate enchantment; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item,

blindness/deafness, feeblemind; Price 40,500 gp.

Door of Mirrors: This type of doorway usually functions

sporadicallyone creature in four, once per day, or randomly

(20% chance). Those aected by the door are surrounded by

1d4+2 exact images of themselves, which duplicate their every

Door of Negation: This powerful doorway suppresses the spell

and spell-like functions of magic items. The door makes a dispel

check (1d20+20) against the caster level of any magic item that

passes through it. If the dispel check equals or exceeds the

11 + the items caster level, its functions are suppressed for

1d4 rounds. Artifacts are immune to this eect.

Halruaan skyship

Halruaan Skyship: Of all the won-

ders of Halruaa, the most famous is the skyshipa sailing vessel

that oatsonairinsteadofwater.Halruaaseldersguardedtheir

methods of creating these devices for centuries, leaving others to

experiment (and fail) with various methods. Recently, a renegade

Halruaan wizard let the secret out, and a couple of wealthy

governments have commissioned their own skyships.

A skyship is much like a standard sailing vessel in appearance and

crew needs. The typical Halruaan skyship has three masts, square

sails, two panels that can be swung out on each side for guidance,

and a broad beam that allows it to land on atsurfaceswithout

listing. Ten plates are axedtotheundersideoftheship,which

are traditionally made from the shells of Halruaan sea turtles.

The magic of a skyship comes in multiple parts. Essential is

the control rod, a narrow cylinder of silver with a tube of gold

slipped over each end, which is linked to the plates on the ships

belly. These ten plates contain the magic that causes the vessel

to rise into the air (a larger ship requires more plates). The rod

56

ampliesthewilloftheshipshelmspersonandtherebycontrols

the vertical movement of the ship, allowing the vessel to rise and

fall at a speed of 45 feet. While most of the ships horizontal

movement is at the mercy of the wind, its sails, steering panels,

and supplemental magic from the plates allow it to turn with

clumsy maneuverability. A skyship can also enter and sail in water

and cannot be sunk so long as its magic remains intact.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, y,

Pouch of Winds: This item looks like an

ordinary leather pouch, tied shut and bulging

at the seams with its contents. It weighs no

more than the leather it is made of. Once per

day, when the pouch is opened, the user can

select one of two eects:afavorablewind

or a contrary wind. If the user chooses a

favorable wind, then the prevailing wind

conditions shift so that a strong wind (see

Table 324: Wind Eects, page 95 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide) turns to blow in

the direction the user wishes. If a contrary

wind is called from the bag, a strong wind

blows directly opposite the current heading of

a single ship within sight of the user. Either

of these conditions last for 2d12 hours before

the wind shifts back to its original course.

Solution of Stillness: This stoppered bottle

contains a thick, oily substance that, when

poured into a storm-tossed ocean, calms

the waters (winds become light/moderate) in

a 100-foot radius for 2d12 hours. The solu-

tion negates magically created waves and also

acts as an antipathy spell against any creatures

from the Elemental Plane of Water.

Magic Items

Annihilation Doorway: This item is usually more of a passage

or tunnel than an actual door. It is often carved or constructed to

look like something else, such as a demonic head with its mouth

(the passage) open wide, a water slough between levels of a dun-

geon, and so forth. The open space of an annihilation doorway

functions as a sphere of annihilation, except that the black void

is shaped to match the passage and it cannot be moved by any

means. A creature passing through an annihilation doorway is

utterly consumed and destroyed. Only the intervention of a

deity can reverse the eect.

Strong transmutation; CL 20th.

Imprisoning Doorway: Like an annihilation doorway,

an imprisoning doorway is often more of a passage or

tunnel. Any creature passing through the doorway

is instantly bound into the door (as per the trap

the soul spell) unless it makes a DC 22 Will

save. Spell resistance does not apply. An im-

prisoning doorway can hold up to 100 HD

of creatures, and when new victims are

imprisoned, creatures that have been trapped

in the doorway the longest are released to keep

the total at or below this maximum. To all

outward appearances, an aectedcreature

seems to disappear (or shapechange into

a  new  form,  if  another  creature  is

released). If an imprisoning doorway

is destroyed, all the creatures bound

within it are released (DM determines

randomly; hostile creatures immediately

attack others in the area).

Strong conjuration; CL 20th.

Wraith Doorway: This form of dread

doorway houses a dread wraith inside (see

page 258 of the Monster Manual). The

door is always encountered locked, and

it usually also has other magical means

of barring passage. Each time a crea-

ture touches or walks through a wraith

doorway (or each round, if continuous

contact is maintained or a creature

stands in the open doorway for

consecutive rounds), it must succeed

on a DC 22 Fortitude save or take 1d8

points of Constitution drain. If a creature is

slain by this drain, it rises as a wraith 1d4

rounds later.

Faint transmutation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous

Item, fog cloud; Price 5,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Wraith doorway

Minor Artifacts

In the lands of the Shining South, particularly Halruaa, mighty

wizards and priests have crafted some amazing items, a few of

which are described below.

Dread Doorway: Perhaps the most infamous item known to

come from Halruaas magical history, a dread doorway is a truly

frightening item to encounter. Three forms of dread doorways

are known.

The dread wraith within a dread doorway cannot be turned

or attacked while imprisoned in the dread doorway. Destroying

the door releases the dread wraith, which immediately attacks. At

that point, the dread wraith can be attacked normally.

Strong necromancy; CL 19th.

Great Elixir: Of all the tales of powerful magic that have

emerged from Halruaa, the legend of the great elixirs is perhaps

the most remarkable. The rst great elixir concoction possibly

originated in Netheril itself. Regardless of their origins, the cha-

otic nature of these liquids made them an unappealing risk, and

57

Magic Items

the formula for their creation was eventually lost and forgotten.

Some caches of the unpredictable studopopupeveryoncein

a while.

A great elixir is a translucent, aquamarine liquid that twinkles

and swirls gently about in endless motion. It is described as tast-

ing like ne wine on re. Oddly, the uid works on a particular

creature only once per experience level; additional consumptions

generate no results. The possible eects of a dose of the elixir

are as follows.:

Zarangan: Each one of these wondrous stones, almost certainly

created in Netheril, is a smooth rock that has been polished to

a glassy sheen. A zarangan is shaped to t in a wielders hand,

with small protrusions jutting up between the ngersofaclosed

st.Inthisway,itcanfunctionasa +1 weapon that deals 1d4+1

points of damage.

A zarangans main powers are far more impressivean

individual grasping the stone can, on command:

use dimension door as the spell 1/round as a 20th-level

wizard;

use word of recall to teleport to the zarangans home (a

destination determined during the items creation) 1/day;

use cure critical wounds (on the bearer only) 1/day.

A zarangan often has its command word inscribed on its

surface somewhere. It can only transport the individual grasping

it, regardless of how many other creatures are in contact with

the bearer. It frees the bearer from all nonmagical restraints and

forcibly separates him from the grasp of other creatures when it

is called upon to use its word of recall ability.

In addition to the above common faculties, each zarangan

also has additional unique capabilities. First, it has one of the

following spells as an ability usable 1/hour: chain lightning, cone

of cold, invisibility, lesser ironguard, levitate, unseen servant, or

water breathing. Second, it grants spell immunity against 1d3

spells (determined randomly).

Many zarangans were carried to Halruaa after the fall of

Netheril, and several have been taken to other lands or buried

in ancient tombs in the intervening years. More than a few

liches have manufactured a zarangan that has since found its

way elsewhere, and those who try to use one of these mysterious

stones might nd themselves in an undead wizards home, far

from their own.

Strong varies; CL 19th; Weight 2 lb.

major Artifacts

A few unique and ultrapowerful items with ties to places and

people in the Shining South are known (or believed) to exist to

this day.

Astrolabe of Nimbral: This large and cumbersome apparatus is

covered with an assortment of levers, knobs, and buttons, looking

remarkably like a cross between a printing press and a pipe organ.

With it, a character can transport an entire structure, such as a

vehicle or a small tower, anywhere on Toril in a great display of

teleportation. As its name implies, the Astrolabe of Nimbral was

crafted by the most powerful of wizards from the island nation

of Nimbral, and stored in the treasure vaults of the Nimbral

Lords. It was eventually stolen by a particularly resourceful band

of adventurers led by the Halruaan wizard Dwalimar Omen and

taken back to his home nation. From there, it was installed on

the Halruaan skyship Realms Master and used by Omen and

several others to hunt down dangerous artifacts at the behest of

Netyarch Zalathorm.

The Astrolabe of Nimbral allows one who is skilled in its

use to teleport an object of up to twenty 10-foot cubes in size,

as well as everything contained inside that object, anywhere on

Magic Items

These are variations on reball created with alternate

energy descriptors; for example, an acidball spell functions as

a reball spell but deals acid damage. Gulkulusters Deathsta

can hold 50 chargesand through a unique property of its

construction, it automatically regains 1 charge each week. If

it ever reaches 0 charges, it becomes nonfunctional until a

week has passed.

Ongild: Named for the Halruaan wizard that created it, the

Ongild is a st-sizedemeraldthathasbeenimbuedwithavariety

of powers. Its last known location was in the belly of the red

dragon Hoondarrh, who lairs on the isle of Skadaurak in the

kingdom of Mintarn. The Ongild continually allows its wearer

to heal 1 point of damage per level every hour. Furthermore,

its wearer can use each of the following eectsasan18th-level

wizard 1/daydelayed blast reball, prismatic spray, reverse

gravity, and spell turning.

Sunphelm of Shandaular: The Sunphelm of Shandaular is

an ancient crown that has served as the regalia of at least three

kingdoms: Ashanath, Eltabranar, and Arkaia. Its origin is un-

known, having been discovered by Shan the Golden, a wizard in

the employ of the gold dwarves of the Great Rift, in an ancient

crypt buried beneath the waters of the Akanamere shortly before

the opening of the Orcgate.

Shan bore the crown for many years, rst as a mercenary

leader of the Nars, and later as the rstqueenofAshanath.After

her death, it passed to her son, grandson, and great-grandson

(Arkaius the Archmage), each ruling Ashanath from the city of

Shandaular in turn. It is from this era that the headpiece became

known as the Sunphelm of Shandaular.

Today, the Sunphelms fate remains unknown, although

knowledgeable scholars speculate that it rests atop the brow of

some matron mother in the drow city of Tlindhet.

Fashioned of silver and gilt with golden runes, the Sun-

phelm is a simple circlet with seven beljuril-tipped spikes that

seem to icker with inner light. A trio of kings tears dangles

from the front of the crown on silver chains. Each kings tear

contains a dierent image withina view of the arch in the

northern half of Shandaular circa 1000 DR, a view of the

arch in the southern half of Shandaular circa 200 DR, and a

view of the city of Arkatuil and the Bay of Dancing Dolphins

circa 750 DR.

The seven beljurils of the Sunphelm of Shandaular col-

lectively provide light equal to that of a candle and exhibit the

eects of a holy star spell (see page 104 of Players Guide to

Faern) as commanded by the wearer. In addition, the wearer

of the Sunphelm is continuously girded by the benets of a

contingent heal spell that activates immediately whenever the

wearer would be killed from damage or Constitution damage

or drain.

Toril. To properly understand and control the Astrolabe, the user

must make a DC 30 Intelligence check. A character gains a +2

bonus on this check for every 5 ranks in Spellcraft and Knowledge

(arcana) he has. Failure by 4 or less indicates the destination is o

by 5d1010 miles; failure by 5 or more means the destination is

randomly determined.

Objects moved from one location to another are subject to

changes in slope, altitude, and stability in the foundation. Thus,

it is considered wise to be aloft (such as in a skyship) before

operating the Astrolabe.

Crystal Orb: Thought to have been crafted by the wizard

Halruaa (one of the first wizard-kings of the nation bearing

the same name), the Crystal Orb is a large, clear sphere about

1 foot in diameter. Since the beginning of the rule of the

netyarchs, the Orb has been the primary means of communi-

cating and managing the affairs of Halruaa. The Crystal Orb

currently resides in an inner chamber in Zalathorms palatial

tower in Halarahh.

The Orb only responds to the primary user, which was des-

ignated as the reigning netyarch of Halruaa during its creation.

With the Crystal Orb, a user can communicate with up to ve

hundred unique individuals at once. During a conversation, the

user has complete control over who can speak and be heard by the

rest of those mentally present. The link also provides a mental

image of the face of any speaker.

The Orb must be attuned to contact any particular individual

through a minor activation sequence whereby the user touches

both the Orb and the potential recipient at the same time and

utters a command word. Thereafter, the user can mentally

contact the recipient when that command word is uttered a

subsequent time. Zalathorm has established a single command

word for the entire Council of Elders, and he is able, thusly, to

reach every member at the same time to conduct the business

of running Halruaa.

Contact from the  Orb is not compulsory. The recipient can

feel a mental signal, but he can choose to ignore it. If the recipient

chooses to respond to the signal, he immediately ndshimselfin

telepathic contact with the wielder of the  Orb and anyone else

the wielder has contacted at that time.

To protect the Crystal Orb, it has been further imbued with

a contingent teleport object spell. Anyone attempting to remove

it from the chamber where it is kept causes the Orb to be sent

to the inner sanctuary of the high priest of Mystra at Mount

Talath, who magically contacts Zalathorm to make arrangements

for the artifacts safe return.

Gulkulusters Deathsta: Created by one of the most powerful

of Halruaas wizards centuries ago, Gulkulusters Deathstawas

designed to be used as a means of ultimate destruction against

almost any foe. Each use of the Deathsta produces one of the

following eects.

Maximized widened reball

Maximized widened acidball*

Maximized widened electricity ball*

Maximized widened frostball*

T he expanses of the Shining South serve as home to

a wide variety of creatures, gentle beasts and erce

predators alike. A few are unique to this region

of Faern, such as the rattelyr dragon that burrows under the

grasslands of the Shaar, or the enigmatic laraken that inhabits a

swamp in Halruaa. Others are not only common to many

parts of the continent, but also infest the dark places

of the South.

Beguiler

60

This plump quadruped is about the size of

a small dog. It is somewhat mouselike in

appearance, with big, glistening black eyes,

large ears, and a pointed snout.

The beguiler is an exceptionally intelligent

creature with natural camouagingand

the ability to see the truth behind any

illusion. A beguiler is about a foot tall

and around 2 feet long. Though not

particularly aggressive, beguilers are

prized by wizards as familiars or for

the magic inherent in their pelts.

The origin of the beguilers un-

usual powers has long been a mystery,

but those who have studied this creature

have determined that it is the favored prey

of ethereal marauders. The beguiler species seems

to have developed its unique abilities to avoid these

planar predators. Beguilers feed on both plants

and animals, preferring plump, water-rich cacti

prevalent in their native environment, as well

as small eld mice and the eggs and young of

ground-nesting birds.

Monsters of the South

The Halruaan version of the many-legged behir is a smaller, more

magical breed than its cousin. They are kept as guardians and oc-

casionally pets. It is rumored that unsavory elements in Halruaan

society raise vicious strains of these creatures for behir-baiting

dens, but such sport is frowned upon, if not actually illegal.

Halruaan behirs take about veyearstoreachadultsize,which

is about half the size of average behirs. They seldom reach 20 feet

or weigh more than 1,500 pounds. Halruaans usually harvest

a behir long before it gets too big.

Halruaan behirs are known for their colorful hides. Blue

is the most common color, but innovative breeders (who are

invariably necromancers) have developed strains of green, coral,

and even rose-hued monsters. The intelligence of the Halruaan

behir has suered, due to this forced breeding for color and

size. They are still cunning predators and sharp-eyed guardians,

however, and their breath weapon is fully as strong as that of

their larger kin.

Halruaan behirs do not speak any recognizable language.

Combat

A Halruaan behir is likely to rely on its breath weapon when

threatened, because hatchlings are often trained not to bite,

maul, or crush. Some Halruaan behirs are trained to constrict

preyor intrudersto the point of unconsciousness. Since they

emit discharges of electricity when agitated, any form of combat

with a Halruaan behir can be dangerous.

Breath Weapon (Su): 20-foot line, once every 10 rounds,

damage 7d6 electricity, Reex DC 17 half. The save DC is Con-

stitution-based.

Constrict (Ex): A Halruaan behir deals 2d6+6 points of damage

plus 1d4 points of electricity damage on a successful grapple check.

It can make six rake attacks against a grappled foe.

Rake (Ex): Six claws, attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d2+2

plus 1d4 electricity.

Static Discharge (Ex): When angry or agitated, a Halruaan

behir generates electricity with its body. This discharge deals 1d4

points of electricity damage to any creature hit by the behir,

touches it, or makes a successful melee attack against it with a

natural or metal weapon.

Skills: Halruaan behirs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks.

A Halruaan behir can always choose to take 10 on climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

Beguilers speak their own language and Common.

A beguiler can be acquired as a familiar by a 7th-level arcane

spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat. See page 200 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide for more information.

Combat

Beguilers possess four sets of sharp, retractile claws and a sharp

bite attack. Beguilers can also wield weapons in their hairless,

prehensile tails.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +5 melee, damage 1d32.

True Seeing (Su): Beguilers always see as if under the eect

of a true seeing spell.

Skills: While dry, beguilers can change the hue and pattern

of their fur to match the coloration of their surroundings, even

to colors and patterns not found in nature, giving them a +8

racial bonus on Hide checks. Beguilers have a +8 racial bonus on

Climb checks. A beguiler can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened.

What seemed to be a normal

cypress tree moments ago

begins to slash and claw with its thick,

woody limbs. A terrible maw opens

along one side of its trunk, lined with

wicked teeth.

Native to the Shining South, dark

trees drink the blood of humans

and other intelligent creatures that

wander into their native jungles.

A  renegade  Halruaan  wizard

named Benauril created them

about 200 years ago, hoping for

servants not unlike treants. His

creations slew him instead and

have now spread from Aerilpar

Forest to the Forest of Amtar, Rethild, the

Toadsquat Mountains, and the southern and eastern reaches of

the Lluirwood.

Dark tree

Dark trees resemble cypress trees, but their bark is darker,

and little moss grows on them. Usual specimens are about 18

to 20 feet in height, with a span of branches 40 feet across, but

dark trees can grow to twice this size. They weigh as much as a

normal tree. Two deep black eyes, which are almost impossible

to ndunlessoneknowspreciselywheretolook,aresetabovea

dark trees maw. These creatures superciallyresembletreants,

but anyone who sees a dark tree can hardly ignore the palpable

hatred and evil emanating from it.

Dark trees do not speak.

Combat

Dark  trees  prefer  intel-

ligent prey and delight in

tormenting their victims

before the kill. They attack with

their two arms, trying to draw

victims toward their gaping maws

to bite and drink blood.

Blood  Drain  (Ex):  A  dark

tree can feast on the blood of its

victims by making a successful

grapple check. If it has a creature

grappled, it can make a grapple

check to deal bite damage and

drain blood, dealing 1d4 points

of Constitution damage to the

creature.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use

this ability, a dark tree must hit

a single target with both of its

claw attacks. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking attacks of op-

portunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can

begin to drain blood.

Confusion  (Sp):  As  a  free

action once per round, a dark

tree can use confusion on one

victim within 50 feet (Will DC

12 negates). In combat, this has

the same eectastheconfusion

spell cast by a 10th-level sorcerer.

Occasionally, victims of the dark trees

confusion ability end up wandering deep

into the surrounding wilderness, becoming hopelessly

lost. More often than not, a dark tree takes advantage of a victims

confused state and drains it of its blood.

Monsters of the South

Rattelyr dragons are territorial creatures, but they take interest in

the world beyond their lairs. They like to burrow through loose

earth and surprise opponents by bursting out of the soil.

Rattelyrs are wingless dragons with webbed claws, a fanged

maw, and the serpentine tail of a rattlesnake. They have glossy,

rust-colored scales at birth, which slowly deepen into hues of deep

magenta, charcoal, and black at maturity. Young rattelyrs possess

small nodules of violet at the base of their heads, which grow

into distinctive ribbed hoods by adulthood. An adult rattelyrs

hood tenses and extends forward in proportion to how angry it is,

usually reaching full extension only during a battle to the death

with a blue dragon or some other hated foe. Unusually short-lived

for dragons, rattelyrs age ve times faster than normal for the

species, becoming great wyrms in 240 years and dying of old age

before 300.

Rattelyrs prefer warm climates and usually restrict themselves

to environs with loose soil. Although they get some of their

nourishment by absorbing heat and sunlight, these carnivores

favor esh and will not hesitate to eat sentient beings. These

dragons dwell in large, low-ceilinged burrows or caverns, but spend

much of their time stalking their home territories in search of

intruders or any form of excitement.

If well fed and approached cautiously, rattelyrs have been

known to converse and deal with other intelligent creatures. On

occasion, rattelyrs might ally themselves with beings of great

power for the promise of wealth or sport. They can be sociable,

and have been known to capture adventurers or lost

merchants just to gain news of the outside word. Of

course, such guests only depart with their lives if

the dragon isnt hungry.

Rattelyrs speak Draconic, Common, and

various regional tongues.

Combat

Rattelyrs employ their keen eyesight

to spot potential prey from far o,

which usually gives them sucient

warning to prepare for combat. If

time  permits,  they  bury

themselves under a light

layer  of  sand  or  dirt,

waiting for the tar-

get to approach, and

then erupt directly into

melee combat. Against

formidable opponents,

rattelyrs  unleash  their

breath weapon rstandfol-

low up with their fearsome

rattle. Rattelyrs enjoy toying

with weak opponents.

Breath Weapon (Su): A rat-

telyr has one type of

breath weapon: a cone

of re.

Rattle (Su): A rattelyr can employ the rattle on its tail as

a standard action. Any nondragon within 240 feet of the rat-

telyr must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the rattelyrs HD +

its Cha modier) against this sonic, mind-aecting ability or

become panicked for 4d6 rounds. Those with 5 or more HD

are shaken for 4d6 rounds instead. A creature that makes the

Will save cannot be aectedbythesamedragonsrattleforone

day. All creatures (including dragons) that are within range and

can hear the rattle must make a DC 15 Concentration check to

employ any spells or spell-like abilities for as long as the rattling

noise lasts.

Hood Extension (Su): A rattelyr can extend its hood as a free

action. When fully extended, the hood reects spells as if the

rattelyr were aectedby spell turning (as the spell). The dragon

can reect as many levels of spells per day as it has Hit Dice.

Tremorsense (Ex): Rattelyrs can automatically sense the

location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with the

ground.

Skills: Climb, Hide, Jump, and Move Silently are considered

class skills for rattelyrs. They have a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks and a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in sandy terrain or

in areas of loose dirt.

A laraken is a magic-absorbing creature from the plane of

Nishrek, home of the orc pantheon, that hates all other living

things and attacks any that approach. It prefers to lurk in wet

places such as marshes and swamps where it can stay moist.

Indeed, a laraken will not willingly come onto dry land, except

to pursue its foodmagic.

Also known as a magic-drainer, a laraken appears as a glis-

tening, yellow sphere with two long tentacles protruding from

opposite sides of its eshy body. A full-size laraken is about 10

feet in diameter and can weigh as much as 2,500 pounds.

Level Adjustment: 

This yellow sphere glistens from moisture as it undulates

through the muck. Two thick, twitching tentacles protrude

from opposite sides of its body.

Combat

A laraken lashes out with both of its tentacles each round. In

addition to dealing bludgeoning damage, the touch of a larakens

tentacle drains magic. Larakens sometimes use magical abilities

they have absorbed.

Absorb Magic (Su): A laraken absorbs magic in the form of

spells cast at it, magic items it contacts, or the spells of spellcast-

ers the creature strikes. Larakens prefer to drain spells, but they

settle for the powers of magic items.

Spellcasters struck by a laraken must make a DC 22 Fortitude

save or lose their highest-level spell slot or prepared spell. The

laraken can then use that spell on its next turn if it so chooses.

If the victim possesses two or more spells of the same level, the

drained spell is randomly chosen.

If a spell cast at a laraken fails to overcome the creatures

spell resistance, it absorbs the spell and has the ability to cast

that spell on its next turn as a standard action.

Each time a laraken is struck by a magic item with charges,

bonuses, or other special powers (or it strikes the item using the

rules for sundering found on page 158 of the Players Handbook),

the item must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be permanently

drained of one charge, power, or bonus. Larakens rst drain

charges the item has, then powers (most potent rst),theneach

individual point of enhancement bonus the item possesses.

A laraken gains 1 temporary hit point for every charge

it absorbs, gains a +1 bonus on its attack rolls until

the end of its next turn each time it absorbs a

point of enhancement bonus, and it can use any

power it drains from an item until the end

of its next turn.

These magic-absorbing abilities do not

function against arcane spells (or items)

utilizing the Shadow Weave. The save DCs are

Dimension Door (Sp): As a standard action,

a laraken can use dimension door as an 8th-level

Monsters of the South

Sense Magic (Su): A laraken can discern magical auras and

their strengths, as well as remaining spell slots within a spellcaster,

choosing its targets based on this perception. Even without the

aid of sight, the creature can sense a spellcaster with remaining

spell slots, a functioning spell, or magic item within 60 feet. This

ability functions automatically and is always active.

Skills: A laraken has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endan-

gered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it

swims in a straight line.

This elephantlike humanoid has bluish-gray skin and two

trunks, each of which ends in a three-ngered handlike

appendage. The creature is stocky in all extremities, sporting

large ears and tusks. It wears loose, patterned clothing.

67

Loxos are peaceful creatures, but they defend their territories and

families with great tenacity, becoming highly enraged when they

see other members of their clan hurt. They are among the most

dangerous of all plains dwellers to those who incur their wrath.

Loxos prefer simple, rustic clothing, particularly cut from

cloth patterned with circles or diamonds. The typical loxo stands

about 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds.

Loxos speak their own language. Some individuals also speak

Common or other dialects.

Combat

Loxos prefer melee to ranged

combat, and they use thrown

weapons only when they cant

close with enemies. If a herd

is threatened, the adult male

loxos charge intruders while

the females move the young

to a defensible location. Once

the young are secure, the

males make a ghting retreat

toward the females, so that they

too can join the melee.

Berserk Rage (Ex): A loxo that sees

a clan member killed or incapacitated

enters a berserk rage. For 6 rounds, the loxo

gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to

Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will

saves, but takes a 2 penalty to Armor Class.

The following changes are in eectaslongasthe

berserk rage lasts: HD 5d8+15 (37 hp); AC 12, touch 8,

(DC 18); SV Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +6; Str 23, Con 17,

Climb +9. After the berserk rage ends, the

loxo is fatigued (2 penalty to Strength,

2 penalty to Constitution, cant charge or run) until

the end of the encounter.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a loxo can trample creatures of Medium size or smaller.

The loxo merely has to move over the opponents. The trample

deals 1d8+6 points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent

can either make an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or

attempt a DC 16 Reex save for half damage. The save DC is

Strength-based.

Loxo Society

Loxo herds are nomadic. They move about, grazing and harvesting

fruits and nuts from groves of trees they have planted. When they

reach a grove or a good area for grazing, they build temporary

huts to serve as shelter until its time to move on. Loxos need

Monsters of the South

massive amounts of grass and other vegetable material to fuel

their big bodies. When not eating, these creatures create rustic

works of art that they barter for items or tools they need.

Loxo herds are divided into clans, and all members of a clan

wear the same pattern of clothing. Each herd has a chief (called

a lox-thik, or herd-lieutenant), who is a ranger, and a tannuk,

who has at least two levels of spellcaster.

Loxos as Characters

Leaders of loxo herds tend to be rangers. Loxo clerics worship

aspects of the Faernian giant deities Hiatea and/or Iallanis and

can choose two of the following domains: Animal, Good, Family,

Healing, Moon, Plant, Strength, and Sun.

Loxo characters possess the following racial traits.

+8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, 2 Charisma.

Large size: 1 penalty to Armor Class, 1 penalty on attack

rolls, 4 penalty on Hide checks, +4 bonus on grapple checks,

This creature has the hindquarters of a big

goat and the forequarters of a great lion.

It has batlike wings and three headsa

horned goat, a vaguely humanoid beast,

and a erce dragon. Its back is set with

curved barbs, and its long tail ends in a

cluster of deadly spikes.

Mantimera

68

Monsters of the South

Mantimeras are the sterile crossbreeds resulting from the

mating of a manticore with a chimera.

The creature has the humanlike head of a manticore,

as well as its wings and tail. Its other two heads are those

of the chimerathe goat and the dragon. A mantimera

is about 10 feet long, stands around 5 feet tall at the

shoulder, and weighs between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds.

Mantimeras speak Draconic and Common.

Combat

Like its chimera parent, the mantimera prefers to surprise

prey. It swoops down from the sky or lies concealed, loos-

ing a volley of tail spikes and its dragon breath weapon

before closing to ght. If possible, the beast stays aloft

during battle.

Breath Weapon (Su): A mantimeras breath weapon

depends on the color of its dragon head. To determine

the head color and breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10

and consult the table below. Regardless of its type,

a mantimeras breath weapon is usable once every

1d4 rounds, deals 3d8 points of damage, and allows

a DC 17 Reex save for half damage. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Spikes (Ex): With a snap of its tail, a mantimera can loose

a volley of six spikes as a standard action (make an attack roll

for each spike). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no

range increment. All targets must be within 30 feet of each

other. The mantimera can launch only twenty-four spikes in

any 24-hour period.

Skills: A mantimeras three heads and manticore parentage

give it a +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. *In areas

of scrubland or brush, a mantimera gains a +4 racial bonus on

Hide checks.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a mantimera is up to

348 pounds; a medium load, 349696 pounds; and a heavy load,

6971,044 pounds.

This gossamer-winged snake glitters with an iridescent sheen,

resembling a rope of gemstones as it ies through the air.

A starsnake is an antisocial creature that is most dangerous while

asleep. Though it is native to open grasslands, the creature prefers

to rest on high rocks or trees.

A starsnakes glossy scales range in hue from luminous shades

of blue and green to radiant ruby. Their eyes always possess a

sky-blue hue. Starsnakes can reach 8 to 10 feet long when fully

grown but weigh only 6 to 8 pounds. A starsnake ndsitsownkind

Monsters of the South

abhorrent, and being hermaphroditic, doesnt seek the company

of other starsnakes to produce young.

When resting during the heat of the day, the snakes employ a

dream shield that repels magic and rewards anyone who touches

them with a jolt of electricity. They are reclusive creatures that

are usually seen only at twilight, their beautiful wings reecting

the sunset colors. Starsnakes feed upon rodents, presenting a threat

only to other creatures foolish enough to disturb their slumber.

They do, however, delight in playing pranks on intelligent

beings, coming to rest in spots where they might engage such

creatures in conversation. While talking, starsnakes often plant

ludicrous (but usually harmless) suggestions. A common expla-

nation for foolish behavior is to claim, only half in jest, that

someone was beguiled by a starsnake.

Starsnakes speak Sylvan. Individuals might speak other

languages as well, such as Halruaan and Common.

A starsnake can be acquired as a familiar by a 12th-level arcane

spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat. See page 200 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide for more information.

Combat

Starsnakes spend much of the day and night dreaming, for their

abilities are as potent asleep as awake. When awake, a starsnakes

defends itself with its spell-like abilities if it can, using its bite

attack only if it must.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 12, initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Static Discharge (Ex): A starsnake generates electricity within

its body while it sleeps. If a starsnake is asleep, any creature that

touches it or makes a successful melee attack against it with

a natural or metal weapon takes 1d4 points of electricity

damage from the discharge.

Dream Shield (Su): While asleep, a starsnake generates

an aura that absorbs spells and spell-like abilities.

Any targeted spell directed at the starsnake is

absorbed and instantly converted into electrical

energy. This energy is discharged back at the

original caster in a bolt that deals 1d10

points of electricity damage per level of the

spell absorbed.

The bolt is 5 feet wide with a maximum

range of 200 feet, and a successful DC 20

The tall mouther is a whirling dervish of devastation in melee.

Its an object lesson in the value of being close friends with a

powerful spellcaster or archersomeone who can kill the beast

without having to charge into melee range. These creatures

plague Luiren.

A tall mouther has a huge head with six long limbs protruding

directly from it, and no torso to speak of. At any given time, two

or three of the surprisingly exible,15-foot-longlimbsareonthe

ground to support the weight of the head and give the mouther

stability. The mouthers head rarely rises 15 feet high, unless its

attempting to avoid the blow of a weapon. The creatures natural

motion keeps the head 5 to 7 feet otheground.Itweighsabout

500 pounds.

Tall mouthers speak Common and broken Haling, both in

accents that can only be described as obscene.

Combat

Tall mouthers stand out of their opponents melee range and use

their slam attacks. If would-be prey rushes in to ghtandmoves

more than 5 feet into or through a mouthers threatened area,

the mouther gets an attack of opportunity (or multiple attacks

of opportunity, thanks to the Combat Reexesfeat,shouldmore

than one opponent make the same mistake).

Arrow Evasion (Ex): A tall mouthers wild whirl of arms

and its shifting central head make it hard to hit with normal

missiles (but not magical ranged attacks, such as spell rays and

magic arrows). Normal ranged attacks (such as from bows or

thrown weapons) have a 20% chance of missing the mouther

outright.

Skills: Tall mouthers have a +4 racial bonus on Climb

checks.

This small, long-legged humanoid has a atheadandagreen

hide covered with black hair. It shues forward, dragging

its knuckles as it moves.

Tasloi are jungle inhabitants whose race is thought to be thousands

of years old. They are quick and nimble in the trees and prefer

to spend their time among the branches.

A tasloi stands about 3 feet tall and weighs between 30 and

40 pounds. They walk in a crouching posture, dragging their

knuckles at times. Their skin is green and thinly covered with

coarse, black hair. Tasloi have gold, catlike eyes.

71

Monsters of the South

Tasloi speak their own language, but some clever individuals

might speak Common or another human dialect.

Combat

Tasloi normally attack from above, dropping from the surround-

ing treetops onto their unwary opponents. If they gain surprise,

they use their nets to ensnare adversaries, otherwise attacking

with their short swords and javelins. They use hit-and-run tactics

to wear down tough foes, always avoiding a stand-up ght.Ifthey

manage to down an enemy, tasloi always try to abscond with the

bodyfood for the group.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Tasloi are dazzled in bright sunlight

or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Skills: Tasloi have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and use

their Dexterity modier rather than their Strength modier

when making such chesks. A tasloi can always choose to take

10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. Tasloi have a

+4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. *In thickly

forested areas, the Hide bonus increases to +8. Tasloi cavalry

(mounted on Medium dire rats) exchange Alertness for Mounted

Combat and have a Ride bonus of +5, reducing Listen and Spot

to +0 each.

The tasloi warrior presented here had the following ability

scores before racial adjustments: Str 12, Dex 11, Con 13, Int 10,

Wis 9, Cha 8.

Challenge Rating: Tasloi with levels in NPC classes have a

CR equal to their character levels 2.

Tasloi Society

The tasloi live in loosely structured bands consisting of several

families. Their lairs are usually a series of large trees intercon-

nected by vines and ropes. Each tree sports platforms, 50100

feet above the ground, upon which the tasloi live. Some tasloi work

and live on the ground, along with the villages livestock.

That livestock includes a number of dire rats and, occasionally,

several spider eaters. The rats are kept as pets and used to aid in

construction, maintenance, and protection of the community.

Medium dire rats are used as mounts. If the village has any spider

eaters, these beasts are reserved as steeds for the most powerful

tasloi in the settlement.

Tasloi as Characters

Tasloi leaders tend to be rogues or ghter/rogues.Tasloiclerics

worship an aspect of the goblin deity Maglubiyet and may choose

to two of the following domains: Destruction, Evil, Planning, or

Trickery. Most tasloi spellcasters are adepts.

This creature looks like a humanoid praying mantis, complete

with an insectlike head sporting compound eyes and a complex

jaw structure. A sand-colored exoskeleton covers its entire

body, and six limbsfour of which are arms, the other two

legsprotrude from its midsection. Its mandibles clack and

antennae wave eagerly as it leaps forward, strange weapons

at the ready.

Thri-kreen, often called mantis warriors, are intelligent hu-

manoids who prefer to live in deserts and savannas, where they

maintain a nomadic lifestyle as hunters. Alien and inscrutable,

thri-kreen can seem bloodthirsty monsters to those who dont

know them well.

Monsters of the South

A  thri-kreen,  when  fully

grown, averages about

6 feet tall and weighs

about 200 pounds. The

typical thri-kreen wears only what it

needs for holding its equipment, but

no clothing or armor. They create

and wear no decoration.

Thri-kreen are at home in arid,

open landscapes where they can

easily blend in with the dry grass, windblown

dunes, and bare rock. Permanent thri-kreen

communities are just about nonexistent. Instead,

packs of thri-kreen range widely over their own

territories, foraging and hunting for daily

sustenance. On rare occasions, two or

more packs might come together to

join their strength against especially

dangerous foes.

Thri-kreen speak a language

made up of clicks and snaps of

their mandibles. Most thri-

kreen whose packs roam

near humanoid civilizations

also speak Common.

Thri-kreen

Combat

While hunting, thri-kreen use their natural camouageto

sneak up on potential prey. Thri-kreen close to combat (and ee

from it) quickly due to their speed and leaping ability. They can

use the gythka and chatkcha (exotic weapons that are unique to

mantis warriors), but they prefer to attack with their claws and

poisoned bites.

Poison (Ex): Injury (bite), Fortitude DC 11, initial damage

1d6 Dex, secondary damage paralysis for 2d6 minutes. A thri-

kreen produces enough poison for one bite per day. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Psi-Like Abilities: When using the Expanded Psionics

Handbook, apply the following psi-like abilities to a thri-kreen.

3/daychameleon, know direction and location; 1/daygreater

concealing amorpha, metaphysical claw. Manifester level is equal

to 1/2 the thri-kreens Hit Dice (minimum 1st).

Leap (Ex): A thri-kreen is a natural jumper. It gains a +30

competence bonus on all Jump checks.

Naturally Psionic: When using the Expanded Psionics

Handbook, a thri-kreen gains 1 bonus power point at 1st level.

This benetdoesnotgranttheabilitytomanifestpsionicpowers

unless such powers are gained through another source, such as

levels in a psionic class.

Skills: *The exoskeleton of a thri-kreen blends in well with

desert terrain, granting a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in sandy

or arid settings (including the Shaar).

D ark things creep out of the hearts of gloomy

forests, attacking caravans that roll past

along trade roads. Strangers whisper of

hidden tombs lying buried in the hills, the last resting places

of long-lost kings. Sinister forces from the Underdark creep

to the surface, and deadly beast-chieftains band together to

harry the lands around their territories. Remnants of an

ancient nation lie hidden within trap-lled towers in a land of

wizards. Old portals disgorge travelers from far-away places. In

the Shining South, adventurers can nd plenty to keep them

busyand wealthy.

A campaign set in the Shining South oers a multitude

of possibilities for adventure, intrigue, and treasure. The lands

of Halruaa, the Shaar, and the Golden Water feature vastly

divergent human cultures from those found elsewhere in Faern.

Dambrath, Luiren, and the Great Rift are nations of other races

entirely, places where half-drow, hin, and gold dwarves consider

humans a minority. The land of Veldorn is ruled by terrible

monsters altogether.

The following chapters detail nine dierentlandsoftheSouth,

including information on major settlements and sites. Some cities

have detailed statistics.

Organizations

of the South

The Shining South is a place far removed from western Faern,

both in distance and in culture. Similarly, the subtle and secre-

tive powers of other parts of the world hold no sway over the

southern coast. Where the Zhentarim butt heads with the folk

of the Dalelands and beyond, and the Red Wizards torment the

peoples of the East, the South has its own organizations. Certainly,

agents from distant lands travel to the south (whether openly or

incognito), but they are solitary gures far from their masters

spheres of inuence.

The Conclave

Within the Council of Elders in Halruaa is a smaller, hidden

organization known only as the Conclave. Its membership is a

secret, and all in Halruaa both respect and fear it. The Conclave

is not an ociallysanctionedpoliticalbody,butrathera private

and elite society of the most powerfuland power-hungryof

Halruaas arcane spellcasters. Its members have taken it upon

themselves to police the research, use, and abuse of magic in

Halruaa. Though no one can say for sure, most believe the

Conclave was founded shortly after the Netherese arrived in

what would become Halruaa as a force to ensure no repeat of

their peers tragic mistakes in Netheril.

When a wizards experiments or practices get out of control,

the Conclave often steps in to correct the situation. Usually,

a simple note is delivered, a warning against further misuse

of the Art. If that doesnt work, the Conclave nds other

means of persuading the oending wizard from continuing

to step over the line. Of course, some practitioners are simply

too pride-lledtoacknowledgethepoweroftheConclaveand

ignore the warnings. When such hubris occurs, the Conclave

simply eliminates the oending wizard. At least, that is what

most presume happenstroublemakers who oendtheConclave

tend to just disappear.

Of course, some see the Conclave as more than just a watchdog

force, believing the organization is a far more ambitious entity,

with designs on controlling the wizard-king and the elders

outright. A few believe the Conclave already exerts this control.

Still others insinuate connections between the Conclave and the

rumored rise of shadow magic in Halruaa, a combination that

is more than a little unsettling.

Campaigns

Church of Loviatar

The worship of Loviatar is the ocial religion of Dambrath.

Most of the leaders in the nation are high-ranking members

of the temples hierarchy, and the Maiden of Pains tenets have

inuencedasubstantialportionofthecountryspersonalityits

laws and punishments, its recreation and pastimes, and its relation-

ships with other nations. It is small wonder that undercurrents

of tension owbetweentheadherentsofLoviatarandthedrow

of Tlindhet in the Underdark below.

Perhaps it is because the drow recognize the value of the

alliance that was made so many centuries ago, or perhaps it is

simply because the church of Loviatar has grown too powerful

to oppose, but Dambrath has gradually but steadily begun to slip

from the matron mothers grips. The priestesses of the scourge

grow ever more bold and independent with each passing decade.

Some say it wont be long before those who worship Lolth nd

themselves unwelcome in Dambrath.

In the meantime, Loviatars church continues to expand its

inuence,lookingtoestablishpropertemplesinplacesinFaern

that have never welcomed the Maiden of Pain before. Taking

a cue from the Red Wizards of Thay, the high priestesses are

considering establishing their own kind of enclaves in foreign

cities where they trade heavily. Such an establishment would be

an ocialDambrathantradecentertoalloutwardappearances,

but it would also serve as a temple for those far from the comforts

of home. Rumors of these plans have reached the ears of other

nations, leaving fear in their wake.

House Jordain

The Jordaini are as integral a part of Halruaan society as the

wizards themselves, and every one of them was trained at House

Jordain. Sitting on the coast of Halruaa southwest of Khaerbaal,

House Jordain is nominally answerable to Zalathorm and the

Council of Elders in Halruaa, but in truth, it operates indepen-

dently of all except the magehounds. The training grounds are

responsible for producing the counselors who serve their wizard

masters in a unique, magic-free manner.

But the wizards operating House Jordain, and the Jordaini

themselves, have the ability to manipulate the endless political

games that take place among the wizards. From everything as

overt as allowing favored wizards to choose the best and bright-

est among the newly trained to the far more subtle workings of

advice meant to steer policy, the ways in which the Jordaini can

sway the outcome of Halruaan politics is immeasurable.

The Maquar

The noble warriors of Estagund live to serve the rajah of that

nation in whatever capacity he requires. They have dedicated

their lives to loyalty and obedience, and they are the rajahs

bodyguards, couriers, public work force, and army. They are also

the single most inuential organization in Estagund, though

few people realize it.

The rajah of Estagund relies heavily on the Maquar, and he

values the leaderships insight into matters political and war-

related. He uses the crusaders not only as a peacekeeping force

in his own nation, but also as a standing army. The rajah might

also employ the Maquar to exert pressure on his political rivals,

because he can assign units of Maquar crusaders to various landed

nobles in Estagund to use as they see t. What the rajah gives

he can take away.

Although the Maquar are unquestioningly loyal to the rajah,

most of the citizens mistakenly think that is based on tradition.

The reality is, the Maquar choose to serve, but only so long as

it benetstheMaquar.Thecrusadershavediscoveredjusthow

much pull they have with the rajah, and they use it to their

advantage. As a group, the Maquar are every bit as powerful as

the rajah himself, and they are beginning to exploit this fact to

mold Estagund to their liking.

Quinix the Glabrezu

Deep inside the heart of the Gate of Iron Fangs in the far

southwestern tip of the Forest of Amtar, a end plots. Quinix, a

glabrezu, accidentally stumbled through a partially functioning

portal several years ago and found himself in the bowels of a

ruined and crumbling city. A large tribe of gnolls camped in the

surface ruins, and Quinix quickly brought them under his sway

through intimidation and lies. They now believe the glabrezu

to be a direct representative of their demon lord Yeenoghu, and

they his privileged servants. For his part, Quinix has used the

portal, which functions only erratically, to bring in two vrocks

to serve as his bodyguards and lieutenants, and he has plans to

add more endstohisretinue.Withtheseassetsathisdisposal,

the glabrezu has grown ambitious.

For a demon, Quinix is surprisingly cautious. He has chosen

to remain low-key initially, biding his time while his minions

carefully reconnoiter the surrounding geography and political

climate. He has instituted a policy of raids designed to maximize

results while minimizing suspicion. His gnoll followers have struck

at numerous caravans and small, isolated settlements, but they

have managed to keep their true level of organization hidden.

They capture everyone they dont kill and take them back to the

ruins as slaves who are put to work rebuilding the ruined city.

As success builds, Quinix envisions expanding his territory,

raiding farther aeldforabroaderrangeofresourcesHalruaa

is a prime target because of the rich magic the glabrezu believes

is there for the taking. The demon also intends to recruit humans

to serve as spies and soldiers (many in the Swagdar are suitable

candidates). With such an army, Quinix expects to conquer some

of the surrounding land outright.

Shadow Wizards

Hushed whispers in Halruaa claim that some among the elders

have turned to Shar and the Shadow Weave. Of course, no one

knows anything denite,butthesuspicioussuggestthatthese

shadow wizards meet in secret, heavily warded against any sort of

divination, and plan for the downfall of the current government

in the nation. With their shadow magic, these criminals are slowly

usurping the reins of power from Zalathorm and the Council

Campaigns

of Elders, ultimately planning to do away with the worship of

Mystra and Azuth, and put Shar above all others.

Some propose that the Conclave and the shadow wizards are

one and the samethat their various deeds only appear to be

guided from dierentgroups.OtherscounterthattheConclave

tirelessly opposes the shadow wizards, and only the formers in-

tervention has prevented the latter from gaining the upper hand.

Most believe half of these rumors are propaganda perpetrated

by both sides in their struggles against one another and the rest

of the wizards of Halruaa.

Others

Numerous other organizations and power groups ndahome

in the Shining South beyond those discussed above. Among

them are:

Beholders of Veldorn: The beholder clans that originally con-

quered Assur in Durpar still operate from the wild hinterlands

of Veldorn. Part of the league of beast-chieftains, the beholders

have machinations much more ambitious than merely antagoniz-

ing the caravan trac. They want their old city back, and more

territory besides.

Kethid: The lizardfolk nation of Kethid in the Great Swamp

of Rethild plays an active role in events all across Faern, due

to the availability of units of their mercenary company, the

Servants of the Royal Egg. For the right price, King Ghassis is

willing to have his troops do just about anything.

Nagas of Ilimar: The nagas of the ruined city of Ilimar are

a powerful group that has yet to ex its muscle fully. They bide

their time, waiting for the moment when their ancient masters,

the sarrukh, who lie entombed somewhere in the ruined city,

emerge to lead them into battle. On that day, nagas, lizardfolk,

and other, more frightening things will march out of the swamps.

In the meantime, they have agents scouting the countryside of

Dambrath and Halruaa, gathering intelligence and looking for

possible weaknesses to exploit when the time comes.

Pirates of the Great Sea: The various corsairs and pirates that

sail the coastal waters of the Great Sea are a constant source of

either frustration or wealth for many in the Shining South. A

number of them have begun to operate in concert lately, with

agents in every major city procuring information on shipments,

protection fees, and job oersfrommerchantswhowishtosee

their rivals ships sitting on the bottom of the ocean. From

such a position of strength and organization, the pirates have

become a true menace to every honest trading organization in

the Shining South.

Red Wizards: The Red Wizards have only a tiny foothold in

the Shining South, having enclaves in various cities of the Golden

Water. They have designs on expanding their trade further. In

fact, the Thayans would love to get their greedy hands on some

Halruaan secrets.

Veldorni Freedom Fighters: Not everyone in the Land of

Monsters is willing to submit to the iron rule of the beast-chief-

tains. Groups of resistance ghtershavebeenorganizedwithin

a number of monster-controlled settlements in the hopes of

fomenting rebellion and eventually winning freedom. Several of

these guerrilla groups are sponsored by other countries, churches,

or by monstrous rivals of those currently in power.

Yuan-ti: The serpent folk are widespread and constantly

look for ways to exploit local populations in their endless quest

for power and wealth. A number of yuan-ti factions operate

secretly in the Shining South, looking for buried riches, subjects

for experimentation, or to expand their territory. These groups

might work in concert with one another until power struggles

break the alliance.

Dungeons in the

Shining South

A dungeon is traditionally an underground chamber in which

prisoners are incarcerated, but adventurers in Faern use the

term more loosely. To them, just about anything underground

is a dungeon, preferably populated with monsters rather than

prisoners. Mines, ruins, caves, subterranean homes, and passages

all qualify.

By the adventurers denition,therearedozensofdungeons

across Faern, many of which were looted long ago, while others

have lain undisturbed for centuries. When it comes to dungeons,

the Shining South is no exception. The most notorious of these

are described here.

Aerilpar Mound: Sitting in a clearing in the heart of the

Aerilpar Forest in Veldorn, this mysterious mound radiates strong

magic. No trees grow inside the perimeter of the mounds sur-

rounding wall, and the predators of the forest stay well clear.

Its origins are unknown, but everyone whos heard of it agrees

something must be hidden there. Few adventurers have managed

to ghttheirwaythroughthedangerouswoodstothemound,

let alone spend any time searching for a way inside.

Akhlaurs Tower: The wizard Akhlaur built his tower in the

middle of the swamp that now bears his name. Finding the tower

had been dicult,sinceitwasmostlysubmergedbeneaththe

surface of the growing swamp. Recently, however, the swamp has

ceased its expansion and the tower once again sits above the water.

For anyone lucky and resourceful enough to survive the dangers

of the swamp itself, the tower still promises to be a storehouse of

treasures that once belonged to one of the most powerful wizards

in Halruaa.

Ammathtar: This city was founded as a trade center where

humans and halingscouldmeetonneutralgroundtodobusiness.

Built on the fringes of the Southern Lluirwood near the caravan

road running along the eastern side of Dambrath, the city was

mysteriously wiped out overnight by something living inside the

woods. Though much of the city was razed, plenty of buildings

still stand for the brave to explore. Of course, whatever destroyed

the city initially is almost certainly still lurking nearby.

Azulduth: Known as the Lake of Salt, this shallow body of

water is surrounded by ruins of an ancient sauroid civilization.

Most of the ground-level structures have been picked clean by

wizards from Mulhorand and elsewhere, but many unexplored

levels reportedly lie below the surface. Of course, the local

populationwhich includes some yuan-tiis unlikely to welcome

invasive explorers.

Castle of Alhanar: Reputedly built during the time of the

long-vanished kingdom of Eltabranar, this ancient ruined fortress

sits just south of the border of the Sharawood. The castle is

the traditional home of the Knights of the Undying Dragon,

an ancient order of crusaders who served as the sword arm of

Myrkul. The Knights have stayed their post in the ensuing mil-

lennia, even in undeath. Once every century, the Knights ride

forth from their castle to destroy the dracolich of the Sharawood,

bringing its treasures back with them. The castle is rumored to

contain more magic than has been seen in one place since the

Imaskari ruled.

Chasoln: This strange temple sits high on the clisthatface

the Great Sea in the East Wall of Halruaa. Massive, stylized

heads seem to watch the ocean, perhaps waiting the return of

some lost civilization. An altar above and behind the great heads

marks the opening of a cave that seems to hold the promise of

greater secrets inside, though no one has admitted to discovering

any passages leading deeper.

Council Hills: The ruined city of Shandaular sits in the middle

of this cluster of barren hills where the Shaaryan tribes meet.

Once the southern terminus of a two-way portal that connected

Southern Shandaular with its northern sister city (on the coast

of Lake Ashane, known as the City of Weeping Ghostssee

Unapproachable East for more information), these ruins are now

nothing more than crumbling stones. Beneath the hills, however,

much of the old city remains. The tribes of the Shaar bury many

of their honored dead in tombs in the uppermost passages, but

they rarely explore the deeper tunnels. Those same tribes dont

like to see the remains of their ancestors disturbed.

The Gate of Iron Fangs: This long-abandoned city sits in the

extreme southwestern tip of the Forest of Amtar. Its architecture

hints that it was built by a serpent race, but no one knows for cer-

tain. The forest has mingled with the tumbled ruins aboveground,

but much of the subterranean city still lies intact. Unfortunately

for any would-be explorers, the city is infested with gnolls who

serve a glabrezu named Quinix. The demon makes his home deep

in the heart of the city and has used the portal there to bring in

other ends.

Guilmarl: Once a trade center for the Arkaiuns, this coastal

city just east of Rethild was overrun by lizardfolk, who tired of

the recurring incursions into their homeland. Now the adven-

turous search the remains of the city, hoping to nd some of

what must have been left behind or lost. Explorers must contend

with an ancient fang dragon that has taken up residence in the

heart of the ruins if they want to come away with anything of

signicant value.

Ilimar: This ruined city dates back to the earliest times, and its

construction is attributed to the sarrukh, one of the creator races.

Nestled in the foothills north of Rethild, Ilimar is considered a

holy site by the lizardfolk, who venerate the resident nagas. The

nagas themselves jealously guard Ilimar against any intruders,

for they can sense the presence of powerful life forms hidden

somewhere in the heart of the ruins.

Lhesper: On the shore of Lake Lhesper in the western Shaar

sits a ruined town. Destroyed by rampaging gnolls during the 7th

century DR, the place has continued to be a source of interest

for treasure hunters. The ruins have become more dangerous in

recent years as yuan-ti have arrived, searching for something

they believe to be buried in the place.

Campaigns

Mortik City: Most locals who live near Mortik Swamp in

Luiren dismiss the rumors of a ruined city in its heart, but that

hasnt stopped an endless owofadventurersfromsearchingfor

it. Whatever might be submerged there is well protected, for the

Bog King and his minions are not fond of visitors.

Narthtowers: This wizards tower sits in the foothills of the

North Wall of Halruaa, and its most recent owner, Thongameir

Stormspells Halargoth, has been dead for a number of years.

No one else has gured out a way to claim the tower as their

ownHalargoth was famous for his love of collecting unusual

ora, and his tower is said to be lled with killer varieties. If

anyone can destroy the deadly plants, theres certain to be a trove

of magic waiting as a reward.

Old Vaelen: Once the capital of Veldorn, the ruined city of

Old Vaelen is nestled among a handful of hills northwest of the

Golden Water, along the Liontongue River. Though the ground

level of the destroyed city contains little, the vaults beneath

the hills are substantial. Theyre also lled with undead and

werecreatures who serve the king of the city, Saed the Vampire

Lord. With all the raiding from Old Vaelen owing its source to

Saed, his warrens must hold vast wealth.

Peleveran: This unusual city was built into the side of the

Landrise, a little north of where the River Shaar emerges from

the great cliface.PeleveranwasdestroyedintheYearofDracor-

age (1018 DR) by the Cult of the Dragon during a spectacular

and cataclysmic battle against a rebelling faction of its own, who

had turned to the service of the demon-god Gargauth. A hidden

temple lies deep inside the ruins of the city, and it might include

a portal to the Nine Hells.

Quarlins Tomb: This burial vault is rumored to house the

remains of a Halruaan wizard who specialized in creating magical

staves. No one knows for sure where the tomb is located, though

it is reputedly near Dapplegate, in the Border Kingdoms. Anyone

who manages to nd it may be able to recover a fortune in

ancient magic, but not before ghtingthroughthetombswards

and guardians.

Shaareach Ruins: In the middle of the wooded section of the

Channath Vale, where the River Shaar and the River Channath

become the River Talar, the lush forest is slowly overgrowing and

destroying the remnants an ancient city. Mysterious structures

from an unknown culture line the banks of the rivers here, the

architecture hinting at a civilization of skilled craftsfolk. Some of

the buildings have already been consumed by the river or become

so vine-cloaked that they are barely recognizable. Reaching the

ruins is a trick in and of itself, because many fell creatures inhabit

both the woods and the rivers.

Starspires: This ruined keep sits on one side of Talath Pass in

northwestern Halruaa. Once the home of Hansandrar Ilmeth,

an archmage of Halruaa who created fabulous magical tomes and

other items, it is now the lair of dangerous creatures native to the

mountains. Old records indicate that Ilmeth tunneled extensively

beneath and behind his keep, and he built warded vaults to store

and protect his magical works of art.

Thruldar: Formerly the westernmost city of Estagund,

Thruldar was demolished by an evil druid and a horde of dark

trees. Ghostwise halingsmanagedtoslaythedruidandmagically

seal his ghost and minions inside the city, but the place is now

a deadly nest of fell plant creatures and undead things longing

to get out. Since there were few survivors in the initial attack,

most of the original inhabitants wealth is still inside the city,

but the ghostwise halingsarenoteagertoletanyoneexplore

the place.

The Tombs of the Dead Kings: Scattered through the Hills

of the Dead Kings, these various concealed tombs are the last

resting sites of the old lords of Dambrath, when the Arkaiuns

ruled before the coming of the drow. While Crinti explorers have

already plundered some of these crypts, others were hidden well

enough that no one has yet found them. Rumors claim that Malar

himself granted the Arkaiuns treasures with which to guard their

kings tombs.

Wilderness

Encounter Tables

The Shining South is a vast region encompassing over 1.1 mil-

lion square miles. Civilization resides in small pocketscities

along the coasts and trade routeswhile most of the rest of

the land is miles and miles of open plains, mysterious forest, or

sheer-sided mountains.

Encounter Chance

As a party travels across the Shining South, there is a chance

per hour of travel of a wilderness encounter, as set out in Table

61: Wilderness Encounter Chance. The rst number in a

column is for a single hour of travel in that type of terrain,

while the second (in parentheses) is the chance of a single

encounter in 8 hours of travel in that terrain. If the terrain

does not change in the course of a days travel, its much easier

to make a single check and then randomly determine when the

encounter takes place.

Parties moving at half their best possible speed or slower are

those that are stopped or camped normally. Parties camping in

secret or hiding use the Concealed Camping/Hiding column. A

party that lights a re is never camping in secret unless it can

somehow hide the light and smoke.

Desolate areas are not settled and do not support great

numbers of wildlife or monsters.

78

Campaigns

Wilderness areas are not settled, but support signicantwildlife

or monsters.

Frontier areas are lightly settled, but communities are small

and far apart.

Settled areas feature broad stretches of cleared land, small

villages, and thorps no more than a days travel from each other,

and some patrols from nearby cities or fortresses.

The Shining South holds eighteen general adventuring areas,

whose encounter chances are described in tables 72 through 719

below. These supplant the encounter tables in the Forgotten

Realms Dungeon Masters Screen, since they provide more local-

ized encounter possibilities. Encounter areas are: The Channath

Vale; Dambrath; Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden; Dust-

wall and Giants Belt Mountains; Forest of Amtar; Gnollwatch

Mountains; the Great Rift; Great Sea Coastal Waters; Halruaa;

Lake Halruaa; Lluirwood; Luiren; Rethild, the Great Swamp;

The Shaar; Southern Lluirwood; Toadsquat Mountains; Veldorn;

and the Walls.

How to Use the

Encounter Tables

Each encounter table includes the following information:

d%: The result on percentile dice that generates the encounter.

Natural Hazards

Although monsters and heartless bandits pose the most obvious

threats to travelers in the Shining South, subtler dangers abound.

The lands along the southern coast of Faern have as many perils

as the harsh climes in the far north. Only the foolish travel the

South ill-prepared.

Hot Weather

In this part of Faern, the heat is extreme and can be deadly

when coupled with high humidity. The local folk have learned to

stay indoors during the hottest part of the day, seeking shelter

in the shade. Those thoughtless enough to ignore the warnings

of the wise might ndthemselvessueringheatexhaustionor

worse. Characters traveling without taking precautions against

exposure to the broiling sun are subject to the eects detailed

under Heat Dangers, page 303 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

The temperature ranges included in the random weather tables

below correspond to the denitions of heat levels given in the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Campaigns

Random Weather

Though weather patterns are complex and dierent seasons

bring changes, the major factors inuencingtheweatheralong

Faerns southern coast are the latitude of the region and the

winds blowing in from the Great Sea. When the warm, humid

air ows in o the ocean and is then lifted up along the anks

of the various mountain ranges that stretch along the coast, the

result is frequent and often violent thunderstorms.

Any particular days weather consists of three components:

the temperature, the wind strength, and the precipitation. Tables

620 through 623 provide random weather combinations based

on each season, weighted toward more likely results. A freak

cold snap is possible in summer, but it is not as probable as long

stretches of broiling heat and oppressive humidity.

Using the Tables

The weather tables are organized into four basic locations: clear

coastline, forest and swamp, plains, and mountains. Roll d% and

apply the same result to all four regions. This makes weather more

realistic, with slightly milder conditions more likely along coasts

and colder conditions at higher elevations. Any given weather

condition lasts for 1d6 days before a new pattern sets in, so its

only necessary to roll for new weather when the previous pattern

ends, not every day.

Clear/Coast: Any stretch of clear land or coastal waters that

sits south of the various mountains or forests falls into this

category, including Halruaa, Dambrath, Luiren, and the area

around the Golden Water.

Forest/Marsh: This includes any of the wooded regions

anywhere in the Shining South, as well as the swamps of the

region, including Akhlaur, Mortik, and Rethild.

Plains: All of the Shaar, the Great Rift, and Veldorn fall into

this category.

Mountains: Any of the mountain ranges, from The Walls in

the west to the Dustwall in the east, are included here.

solid day of rain is pretty rareeven during heavy downpours

and thunderstorms, clear spells hours long usually appear.

Clear: No precipitation of note.

Downpour: 1d3 downpours lasting 1d4 hours each occur

during the day. Otherwise, the day consists of rain.

Humid: No precipitation of note, but characters suering

the eects of exposure to Hot or Severe temperatures take an

additional 2 penalty on their Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal

heat damage each hour.

Snow: Snow falls steadily, but 1d41 clear breaks of 1d4 hours

each interrupt the snowfall.

T. Storm: 1d3 thunderstorms lasting 2d610 minutes each

or rainy (50% chance).

Definitions

Results from Tables 620 through 623 are described below.

Temp.: Temperature results fall into the following broad cat-

egories. Nighttime temperatures are generally 10 to 20 degrees

colder and might actually fall into the next colder category

(50% chance).

Severe: Above 110 F. (At night, temperatures always fall

into the Hot category.)

Hot: Between 86 and 110 F.

Warm: Temperatures between 61 and

85 F.

Mod.: Temperatures from 41 to 60 F.

Cold: Temperatures between 0 and 40 F.

Wind: The strength of the prevailing wind. Periods

of calm or sudden stronger gusts are possible.

Wind strength decreases one category at night

(severe to strong, for example). The three

results on the Random Weather tables

are fair, varies, and storm. Roll d%

Halflings of Luiren lure a tall mouther into an ambush

93

T o outsiders, Dambrath seems a land of contrasts. Its

people dwell in open grasslands under a sweltering

sun and an endless blue sky, but they owe fealty to

the drow, who shun the light. Though the majority of its popula-

tion is human, Dambrath is ruled by the Crintipeople of mixed

human, drow, and elf heritage. The nation draws its most lucrative

trade commodities from both the land and the sea. Because of its

leaders surprisingly nonaggressive policies toward their neighbors

and their aversion to allowing outsiders too far inside the nations

borders, Dambrath has remained a land of mystery to most of

Faerns folk. That situation suits its noble class just ne.

Geographic Overview

Stretching between the East Wall, which serves as its border with

Halruaa to the west, and the Southern Lluirwood to the east,

the nation of Dambrath measures more than 700 miles across.

Its coastline is nearly twice that long because of the way the Bay

of Dancing Dolphins doubles back inland. From the coast, the

land stretches about 300 miles north to the Forest of Amtar.

Most of Dambraths inhabited land, however, lies south of the

Gnollwatch Mountains and the Hills of the Dead Kings, which

divide the nation into northern and southern regions. Dambrath

also claims some additional land east of the Forest of Amtar,

along the trade road toward Delzimmer. Rethild, also known as

the Great Swamp, is ostensibly part of Dambrath, though its rulers

claim that area in name only, since the lizardfolk and nagas that

live there deter any thoughts of true control.

Dambraths climate is oppressively hot except during the

rainy season, which begins in mid-Uktar and lasts two to three

months. South of the Gnollwatch range, the days are sweltering,

but the nights are pleasant because the breezes blowing in o

the Great Sea cool the air quickly. North of the mountains, the

temperatures are even hotter, and the air is stiingly sticky.

Rain comes much more frequently there, making the Forest of

Amtar a humid zone every bit as muggy as the jungle regions of

the Chultan Peninsula. Most people dwelling in the countryside

have never seen snow, and morning frosts are almost nonexistent

except in the mountains.

Most of Dambraths land consists of open plains covered

with tall grasses particularly suited for the breeding of horses.

This veritable sea of rolling plains stretches as far as the eye can

see in every direction. Horse ranchestiny, self-sucientcom-

munities dedicated to breeding the nestmountsinFaerndot

the countryside every few miles. Most of the urban population

dwells in trading cities on the coast, particularly along the shores

of the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. The crystal-clear waters of

the bay keep Dambraths shing and pearl-diving industries

lucrative year-round.

Major Geographic

Features

Dambrath has two distinct geographies: the coastline around

the Bay of Dancing Dolphins and the inland plains north of

the Gnollwatch Mountains. The inhabitants perceive every

other major geographic feature as little more than inconvenient

wasteland bordering on the inhabited areas. Stay out of the

wildernesss way, and the wilderness will stay out of your way,

as the Dambrathans are fond of saying.

The Bay of Dancing Dolphins

The sheltered body of water known as the Bay of Dancing Dol-

phins is more than 300 miles long. It stretches across most of

Dambraths central coastline, shielding the nations interior from

the harsher weather of the Great Sea. The bay is a key factor in

the Dambrathan economy because it teems with both pearl-bear-

ing oysters and a wide variety of sh. Fishermen all along the

94

Dambrath

95

Dambrath

coast lltheirnetseachdaywithswordsh,snapper,seabass,and

other sh, most of which are sold locally to stock the larders of

Dambraths citizens. All along the shoals near the coast, the pearl

divers work oyster beds that are visible dozens of feet below the

surface because of the clarity of the water. Merchant vessels sailing

to and from the harbors of Dambraths various port cities form a

steady stream of traconthebayandmakechoicetargetsfor

the noble-nanced corsairs who frequent these waters.

The waters of the bay are almost unnaturally calm, giving

rise to rumors that some kind of subtle magic protects it from

storms. Indeed, no storm has churned its waters for at least the

last 500 years, though many stretches of coastline nearby have

been repeatedly battered by winds and rain. Indeed, the captains

of the many ships that frequent the bay have learned not to

venture out beyond its mouth when the dolphin population grows

noticeably more crowded. The creatures seem to sense when a

storm is imminent and gather in the bay a day or two beforehand

for shelter.

Even during calm weather, the many schools of dolphins

that call the bay home are by far its most prominent, visible,

and impressive features. Each day at dusk, thousands of dolphins

all along the bay engage in a playful, apparently coordinated

dance or game. Locals often come down to the shores or board

open-decked vessels and venture out onto the waters to watch the

dancing dolphins.

In addition to their entertainment value and their beauty,

these dolphins are valued as a defense against aquatic hazards. In

addition to predicting foul weather by their behavior, they have

eliminated almost all predatory creaturesincluding sharks, giant

squids, and sahuaginfrom the bay. They have also aided drown-

ing swimmers (including a queen who ruled Dambrath more than

300 years ago) on numerous occasions. Because of their uncanny

ability to protect the bay, dolphins are revered and protected in

Dambrath. Anyone caught harming one suersextraordinarily

painful punishment at the hands of Loviatars priestesses.

Various sages have attempted to study the dolphins and to

discover what, if any, weather-controlling dweomer protects the

bay. A few have discerned a faint and scattered emanation of

magic, but no one has thus far determined its origins or eects.

Several sages have theorized that the source of the bays protective

magic is some greater intelligence that dwells beneath the surface

of the water, and that this being has also somehow organized and

trained the dolphins.

Indeed, legends have persisted for many years about a sunken

city in the middle of the bay. Many sailors have reported seeing

the tops of spires in the water when the sun shines down from

directly overhead, illuminating the crystal-clear depths. But such

claims never indicate the same location twice, and follow-up visits

to search for the fabled city invariably turn up nothing. Some

believe that the city is a remnant of a long-forgotten empire that

once sat on dry land, and that magic gone awry submerged the

city, creating the bay in the process. Others argue that the sunken

city is the home of a sinister seafaring race whose members are

biding their time until they can attack the shores of Dambrath.

In this version of the tale, the dolphins are allies of the undersea

dwellers, performing their dance and saving drowning swimmers

just to lull the surface dwellers into a false sense of security.

The truth is somewhere in between. A hidden city does exist at

the bottom of the Bay of Dancing Dolphins, and its inhabitants

are tritons. These outsiders were quite friendly with the Arkaiun

tribes that once occupied the coast of Dambrath, and the two

races traded occasionally. Even then, however, the tritons kept

the existence of their city a secret, preferring to venture close

to the shore in small groups to deal with the humans. Several

centuries ago, a dispute over the value of pearls caused the tritons

to withdraw, and the human tribes eventually forgot about them.

By the time the drow overran the surface and conquered the

Arkaiuns, the tritons were no longer even a legend.

The tritons keep the existence of their city secret through

potent magic worked by a circle of powerful clerics dedicated to

their own deity. The magic hides the walls and spires of their city

by simple displacementthat is, the structures appear to be at

various other spots in the depths of the bay. The triton clerics are

also responsible for the perpetually calm weather in the bay, and

the dolphins are indeed their friends and allies. A portal in the

heart of the triton city leads to the Elemental Plane of Water.

The Forest of Amtar

The Forest of Amtar is a lush, humid, near-tropical woodland.

Dense tangles of suthwood stretch for miles, forming natural

barriers at various locations throughout the forest. Vast stretches

of shadowtops and slightly shorter pines llthegapsbetween

the suth tangles, and thick vines, ivy, and brambles form the

understory, sometimes even climbing the trunks of the trees.

Though little direct sunlight reaches beneath the boughs that

form the forest canopy, the rainy climate and tropical location

keep the interior damp and hot, making the Amtar a perfect

haven for endless swarms of crawling and ying insects.

The Amtar is also home to many kinds of wild animals. Par-

rots, macaws, and other tropical birds nest in its trees, and lizards

and snakes of all sorts slither through the undergrowth. Mammals

native to the forest include wild boars and dangerous predators

such as tigers and leopards. Families of monkeys and gorillas

roam the woodland, but their populations are more concentrated

in the northern half. Travelers must be wary of more than just

the normal animals, however. Giant snakes, lizards, and beetles

also prowl the deepest sections of the forest, and a few girallons

and dire apes lead wandering packs.

A tribe of wild elves known as the Trunadar, or star people,

calls the southern half of the Amtar home. The tribe, which

numbers no more than vehundredadults,takesadvantageof

the relative protection oeredbytheGnollwatchMountainsto

the south, which serve as an additional screen against the preda-

tions of the Dambrathans. The Trunadar roam the central part

of the southern forest, steering clear of both the community of

Elveswatch on the east side and the ruin known as the Gate of

Iron Fangs on the west. The tribes nominal leader, Ferla Treerun-

ner (CG male wild elf barbarian 8/sorcerer 6), occasionally sends

a raiding party to disrupt logging on the edge of the forest near

the community of Elveswatch. Just as occasionally, the Crinti

rulers of Dambrath send a force of soldiers into the forest to scare

the wild elves away. Neither side, however, is willing to engage in

any true warfare on the others home turf.

96

Dambrath

Several small bandit groups use the concealing growth to hide

from pursuit, and some have staked out areas along the edges of

the forest as temporary bases. These latter groups usually hide

out along the northern boundary of the woods, preying on the

caravan trac that moves along the road between Rethmar

and Delzimmer. A few take refuge in the eastern stretches of

the Amtar and range out toward the Traders Way. The thick,

tangled woods make pursuit dicult at best, since the bandits

always know the paths through the endless stretches of suthwood

much better than their pursuers do.

Tandith Tornears (LE male ogre mage barbarian 5) leads one

such group of raidersa motley collection of humans and half-

orcs augmented by a couple of ogres. Tandith and his minions

prowl the stretch of woods along the road between Channathgate

and the Landrise. There the forests edge comes right up to the

route, making ambushes easier. Folk from Three Swords have

tried in vain for several years to catch Tandiths band, but they

have never succeeded. They have recently petitioned the Great

Rift for aid, since a substantial portion of the goods stolen in

these raids was either heading toward or coming from the gold

dwarves. The leaders there are presently considering a course

of action.

The Gate of Iron Fangs

An ancient city, its origins lost in the mists of time, stands at the

southwestern tip of the Forest of Amtar. Only a few of its stones

still stand, and creepers and vines have wormed their way over

and through every remnant of the citys previous glory.

Named for the oddly curved and menacing towers that ank

what is left of the main gate, the Gate of Iron Fangs was already a

crumbling ruin by the time the Arkaiuns migrated to this region.

Those few who have studied the citys remains in detail speculate

that it was founded by the same culture that constructed Ilimar

to the south, based on the similarity of the architecture and the

gates resemblance to a pair of serpentine fangs. Whatever its

origins, however, most sensible folk avoid the place because of

the dangerous creatures that call it home.

A large tribe of gnolls has claimed the site as its own and

now uses it as a base from which to raid south and east into the

ranch country of Dambrath, and north toward Channathgate and

Rethmar. These gnolls are much better organized than others

of their kind, somehow managing to strike key locations and

particularly wealthy caravans each time they raid. Most victims

of their predations believe that the gnolls are working in concert

with the outlaws of the Swagdar (see below), but the truth is far

more sinister.

Several years ago, a glabrezu tanarri named Quinix found his

way through a partially functioning portal from the Abyss into

the subterranean levels of the city. The demon quickly gained

the loyalty of the gnolls via a complex web of lies liberally spiced

with bribery. As a result, the gnolls now believe that Quinix is a

direct representative of Yeenoghu, and that his presence is proof

that they are the deitys favored servants. Quinix has since used

the erratically functioning portal to bring in a pair of vrocks,

which serve as his assistants and bodyguards. The glabrezu now

sits deep within the bowels of the ruined city, plotting ways to

bring chaos and evil upon the surrounding lands.

The Gnollwatch Mountains

The Gnollwatch Mountains run east and west for about 275

miles in the northern half of Dambrath, eventually giving way

to the Hills of the Dead Kings to the east. The Gnollwatches

are not particularly tallmost peaks barely reach 9,000 feet,

and Mount Hazail, the highest point in the range, tops out at

11,512 feet. Still, since the majority of Dambrath is so close to

sea level, the range presents a striking contrast to the rolling

plains just south of it.

The Gnollwatch Mountains wear a mantle of light snow for

about ve months out of the year, most of it falling during the

winter rainy season. The rest of the time, the copses of pine, shad-

owtop, and suthwood that dot the slopes appear as spots of dark

green against the tan mountain meadows, which are dominated by

short, coarse grasses similar to those on the plains below. Above

the timberline, more of this brown grass covers the mountains

smooth, rounded domes. Unlike some of the more craggy ranges

in other parts of Faern, the Gnollwatch Mountains have been

worn down over millennia by the daily rainstorms that build

along the slopes and the incessant sea breezes that blow from

the south.

True to their name, the Gnollwatches are home to numerous

tribes of gnolls that dwell in cave complexes scattered along

their wooded slopes. For the most part, the Dambrathans living

near the foothills consider the gnolls an aggravation because

they are aggressive, hostile, and a drain on the areas resources.

However, the few gnoll tribes that have consolidated under

Grubash Blacksnout (LE male gnoll ghter 6), a particularly

disciplined leader, have actually managed to maintain cordial

relations with their human and Crinti counterparts. Grubash

coordinates hunting territories to minimize conicts,andhehas

arranged for gnolls to serve as mercenaries for the Dambrathan

nobility. In exchange for generous supplies of meat and silver

trinkets, gnoll mercenaries battle other gnoll tribes on behalf

of powerful ranch owners and occasionally attack ranches owned

by their employers rivals.

A handful of hill giants roams some of the higher slopes of

the Gnollwatches, competing with the gnoll tribes for hunting

grounds. These giants occasionally stray into the Hills of the Dead

Kings, and sometimes into the grasslands to poach food from

the human ranches. (They are fond of horseeshandconsiderit

a delicacy.)

A single family of storm giants maintains a well-hidden castle

in a particularly remote and sheltered crag near the highest peaks

of the Gnollwatches. Abinor Lashingwind (CG male storm giant

sorcerer 7), the head of the family, takes great pains to keep his

household hidden from the prying eyes of both the Dambrathans

in the plains and the drow below them. The hill giants know about

their rivals but leave them alone, seeing no good reason to incur

the larger giants wrath. To warn ounwantedintrudersofother

races, Abinor has taken to creating evidence of an immense,

cranky silver dragon that dwells high in the peaks, and rumors

of this ctitious beast have spread all the way to the coast and

into neighboring Luiren.

A number of rich silver deposits snake through the Gnollwatch

Mountains, and miners discover more new lodes every year. The

97

Dambrath

Dambrathans have made themselves wealthy digging the ore

from the earth, and they have actively prospected all through

the mountains, despite the danger from monsters and outlaws.

Some of the larger mining consortiums hire competing mining

operationsand even less friendly gnoll tribesto work their

claims, thus ensuring maximum yield with minimum danger.

The drow city of Tlindhet sits squarely beneath the Gnoll-

watch Mountains, several miles below the surface. Unlike most

connections between the Underdark and the world above, the road

from Dambrath into the bowels of the earth is an open trade

route, since the drow have laid at least a nominal claim to the

lands of their surface counterparts. The main road connecting

the two regions winds out of Herath into the southern foothills

along the far western end of the range, where it enters a broad

cave. From there, the path descends through worked tunnels to

the drow community. Numerous smaller roads join the route

from other surface entrances, but since the drow do not use these

secondary paths as regular thoroughfares, they make no eort

to keep them predator-free.

The Hills of the Dead Kings

This region of gently sloping, grass-covered knolls was once known

simply as the Hills of the Kings. Its name changed when the Arkai-

uns were conquered by the drow and their unexpected allies, the

priestesses of Loviatar (see History of Dambrath, below). Despite

their somewhat moribund name, the hills are pleasant and relatively

danger-free, except when the hill giants from the mountains to the

west wander this way. Scattered copses of pines and the occasional

shadowtop dot the grassy rises here and there, but trees are rare

in these hills. Numerous streams meander through the meadows

toward the atter plains to the south and east.

A number of halings dwell at the eastern end of the Hills

of the Dead Kings. Most of these hin are stronghearts who

migrated west from the Southern Lluirwood and eventually

found themselves beyond the borders of their native Luiren (see

Chapter 10 of this book). The halingskeeptothemselves,living

in small hamlets and villages throughout the hilly region. The

hin rarely leave their domain, though they do maintain trade

relations with the Dambrathans to the southwest. They are also

more than willing to trade with any merchants who deem it

worth their while to detour o the route between Cathyr and

Delzimmer.

The hills got their name because the old Arkaiun tribe

that had settled the region (see History of Dambrath, below)

preferred to bury its kings in remote tombs. Of the nine Arkaiun

monarchs who reigned in Dambrath, seven are reputedly en-

tombed in secret vaults deep in these hills. Only Reinhar I,

who died in battle in Halruaa, and Reinhar IX, who was slain

during the battle with the drow of Tlindhet, did not receive

such honorable resting places. Even so, at the command of

Malar the Beastlord, the Arkaiuns constructed an empty burial

chamber in honor of Reinhar I, lling it with treasures and

setting numerous guards and wards to protect it. According

to legend, Malar also presented the Arkaiuns with two magic

constructsa stone lion and an iron tigerto serve as guard-

ians inside this tomb.

The Arkaiun people of Dambrath (now called Shebali by their

Crinti rulers) proudly claim that the tombs of their dead forebears

have never been found or plundered. In truth, however, Crinti

adventurers have sacked several of them. The Crinti wisely keep

this tidbit of information to themselves, for fear of causing an

uprising among the Shebali. The tomb robbers have carefully

smuggled whatever wonders they have found to other parts of

the world, where they could reap tidy prots from them. Still,

several of the tombs lie undiscoveredno doubt protected by the

ancient magic of the Arkaiun builders.

Rethild, the Great Swamp

The Great Swamp of Rethild pools around the base of Halruaas

East Wall, which marks the western border of Dambrath. The

southern edge of the swamp gradually grows wetter and the

ground less rm as it fades into the ocean. The swamp is a

sweltering place lledwithmoss-coveredcypressandzalantar

trees, as well as countless horrors waiting to prey on the unwary.

Few choose to venture into it, and fewer still return from its

murky interior.

The air in the Great Swamp is hot, sticky, and foul-smelling.

Most of the year, the combination of high temperatures, wretched

humidity, and endless clouds of swarming, biting insects creates

an oppressive environment that few creatures not native to the

place can tolerate for more than a couple of hours. Even during

the rainy season, when the temperature cools a few degrees, the

place is still a bug-infested, sweltering steam bath. Deaths result

as often from exhaustion, sickness, and overheating as from the

dangerous creatures that abound here.

The noxious vapors that bubble up through the water are

the products of decomposing matter, monstrous exudations,

and residual magic left here long ago. These odious fumes form

steaming clouds of pale yellow, brown, or green gas that hug the

ground and drift slowly along through the trees, driven by the

sluggish breezes. Some of these clouds are deadly, carrying poisons

such as burnt othur fumes or diseases such as cackle fever and

mindre through the swamp.

The Great Swamp is home to numerous unusual creatures,

including giant versions of leeches, toads, and snakes, tribes of

bullywugs and tasloi (see page 71), and the occasional shambling

mound. In addition, rumors abound of yet another inhabitanta

black dragon named Valraxaxath that dwells in a ruined city at the

heart of the swamp. These rumors are true, but the dragon hasnt

been seen in almost sixty years, since it prefers to hunt far aeld

by means of a portal network. The name of the lost city where it

lairs is unknown, but legend holds that it was constructed by the

same race that built Ilimar (see below), and possibly Chasoln

(see page 134) as well.

By far the most numerous denizens of the swamp are the

lizardfolk tribes, which have united into the kingdom of Kethid

under Ghassis (CE male half-end lizardfolk sorcerer 15). Not

content simply to rule his kingdom, King Ghassis has taken an

interest in both the wonders and the politics of the world beyond

the Great Swamp. Under the leadership of his eldcommander

Sladdis (CE male lizardfolk ghter 12), Ghassis dispatches

companies of lizardfolk mercenaries, known collectively as the

98

Dambrath

Servants of the Royal Egg, to ght in distant wars. Members

of this company exhibit plenty of single-minded determination

and an intense sense of group identity, so they are valued for

their prowess in head-to-head combat. Their lack of initiative and

poor tactical sense, however, means that strong leadership and

explicit instructions are vital in achieving the desired results.

For the most part, Ghassis is indierent to the fate of these

mercenaries. The king of the lizardfolk is far more interested in

the wealth he can accumulate from potential employers than in

seeing his subjects return safely home after an engagement. He

has no qualms about sending the Servants of the Royal Egg on

dangerous assignments from which they are unlikely to return,

though he does expect an especially lucrative deal for committing

them to their deaths. In recent years, he has dedicated several

companies of the Servants of the Royal Egg to Tethyrs War of

Reclamation, and a few to limited ghtingintheJunglesofChult.

Despite the popularity of lizardfolk mercenaries elsewhere, the

folk of Dambrath rarely call upon them to serve in battle against

their enemies. Because most of the nations strife is internal, foes

have plenty of opportunity to oerGhassisabetterdealandthe

Dambrathans know that he might order his minions to change

sides during a ght for enough cash.

Possibly as payment for the services of the Servants of the

Royal Egg, or perhaps simply through trickery or cunning,

Ghassis has acquired three Halruaan skyships. Though his

own subjects know about the ying vessels, the king tries to

keep their existence a secret from the rest of the world. Most

of the time, they are hidden deep inside the swamp under

camouage. However, King Ghassis uses them to travel the

length and breadth of his kingdom from time to time, or to

deliver mercenaries to the battleeld on rare occasions. Now

and then, folk beyond the borders of the swamp see the lights

of the skyships as they rise into the night. Such sightings have

sparked rumors about lights dancing in the skies over the Great

Swamp, though speculation about their origins is as wild and

as varied as the people who have seen them. Few guesses have

actually come close to the truth.

Ilimar

Ilimar is a split city, divided between the two ends of a portal.

Now crumbling ruins, these two sites are all that remains of a city

founded millennia ago by the sarrukh, the progenitor race that

created most of Faerns intelligent lizard and serpent creatures,

including nagas, yuan-ti, and lizardfolk. The southern half of

Ilimar lies nestled in the hills, near the headwaters of one of the

streams that feeds the Great Swamp from the north. The northern

half lies in the western reaches of the Gulthmere Forest, near

the southern shore of the Lake of the Long Arm.

99

Dambrath

A sacred site to the lizardfolk of Rethild, the southern portion

of Ilimar is ruled by a circle of spirit nagas, whom the lizardfolk

worship as deities. These nagas know that three sarrukh lie in

hibernation somewhere beneath the center of southern Ilimar.

The sarrukh took great pains to ensure that they were well hidden

from potential threats, so the nagas dont know precisely where

they are. However, they can sense the presence of their creators,

and they plan to be ready when their masters emerge from the

depths of the ruins.

The spirit nagas use the lizardfolk as a labor force to hunt

for other lost sites from the time of the sarrukh. Upon nding

such a ruin, they excavate it for valuable artifacts that once

belonged to their creators, hoping to oer these baubles as

tokens of their continued fealty when their masters return. The

nagas have already discovered a few such sites, including the

ruins of Chasoln (see Chapter 9) throughout the East Wall

and the swamp.

The Swagdar (Outlaw Waste)

The wasteland known as the Swagdar stretches from the foot-

hills of the East Wall to the fringes of the territory patrolled

by Heraths military, and from the northern edge of the Great

Swamp to the southern boundary of the Forest of Amtar. For

decades, the Swagdar has been a haven for anyone who refused

to bow down to the Crinti who rule Dambrath. Bandits, thieves,

and Shebali who escaped the rule of the Crinti roam this wide-

open countryside, embracing an almost nomadic lifestyle. With

no single charismatic leader to unite them, the various tribes

scue among themselves almost as much as they do with the

Dambrathans. For the people of this lawless region, however,

the sort of dangerous freedom the Swagdar oersisbetterthan

a life of subjugation.

Many of those who come to the Swagdar are criminals

eeingtheirpastsorseekingaplacewheretheycancontinue

their depredations outside the watchful eye of the law. Others

are loners who prefer the solitary nature of the countryside to

the more heavily settled plains of Dambrath proper. Still others,

claiming to be descendants of the original Arkaiuns, come here

to defy the overbearing Crinti and return to their ancestors way

of life. These wanderers typically worship the Beastlord, as their

forebears did centuries ago.

When the bandit raids grow intolerable, the Crinti send

expeditionary forces into the Swagdar to conquer or drive o

the occupants. Thus far, their successes have been marginal at

best, since the nomadic people of the Swagdar can scatter at a

moments notice and hide in the hills, forest, or swamp. Once

the Crinti tire of chasing dust trails and return to their civilized

lands, the tribes drift back and take up where they left o.

Though the tribes of the Swagdar range freely over the

wastelands open ground, they make a point of avoiding ruins

such as Ilimar and the Gate of Iron Fangs. More than a few

bandits whose curiosity got the better of them have disappeared in

those places, and the locals share cautionary tales over communal

campres with all new residents and travelers. However, they

gleefully urge any self-assured adventurers passing through the

area to seek their fortunes in such places.

People of Dambrath

The female Crinti nobles who serve as the stewards of Dam-

brath make this nation a true rarity in Faern. The Crinti,

all of whom are of racially mixed heritage, not only hold the

highest social positions within Dambrathan society, but also

consider themselves above the lesser races that dwell within

the countrys borders.

Races and Cultures

About fteenpercentofDambrathspeopleareofmixedhuman,

drow, and elf heritage. Most of them have at least partial drow

blood, but generations of interbreeding among drow, half-drow,

humans, and half-elves have made it more pronounced in some

individuals than in others. Regardless of their precise heritage,

these racially mixed people are called half-drow or Crinti, and

they constitute the aristocracy of Dambrath.

Most of the humans (Shebali) are descended from the Arkaiuns

who lived here before the coming of the drow and their half-elf

allies. Though humans make up seventy percent of the population,

they are considered second-class citizens throughout the nation.

However, this distinction is more clearly delineated in the urban

centers than in the countryside, where ranch work demands more

pragmatism and greater tolerance.

The rest of Dambraths population consists of halings,gnolls,

and a smattering of other humanoids. These individuals have no

higher status than humans.

Elves other than drow are not welcome in Dambrath, and

locals turn them away at the borders. Any such elves caught deeper

in Dambrathan territory are usually captured and turned over to

the temples of Loviatar for entertainment purposes. Dwarves,

while not denied entry, are not truly accepted either. Most of

those who do visit Dambrath are traders coming south down the

Traders Way, and they do not stay long.

Arkaiuns

Though they are predominantly Nar, the Arkaiuns also have

a bit of Illuskan blood, thanks to an extraordinary portal (see

History of Dambrath, below, and Chapter 11) that brought their

parent tribes together in the Council Hills region of the Eastern

Shaar. They migrated from that area to Dambrath more than

a millennium ago.

The typical Arkaiun is short and stocky, with dusky, tanned

skin and raven-black hair. Occasionally, however, a child is born

who grows regally tall, or sports a mane of golden-blond or red

hair, like his Illuskan forebears.

Except for those Arkaiuns who were born and raised in the

heart of the coastal cities, every human in Dambrath learns to

ride a horse by the time he is veyearsold.Inurbanareas,most

Arkaiuns are laborers, craftsfolk, and artisans. In the countryside

to the north, they serve as ranch hands on the great ranches of

the Crinti landowners.

The Crinti do not permit humans to own land. Some few

Shebali claim their own land in the plains, but such homesteads

are always in the Swagdar or elsewhere on the outskirts of the

country, where the law exists in name only.

100

Dambrath

Most outsiders still look upon the Arkaiuns as little more

than barbarians, and indeed, because of their lower-class standing

in Dambrathan society, they seem to be a rough and barbaric

people. Nonetheless, the Arkaiuns ercely cling to a national

identity, despite (or perhaps because of) the way they have been

subjugated by the Crinti.

Crinti (Half-Drow)

The Crinti of Dambrath come from widely varied bloodlines. Nine

in ten are descended from unions between the drow of Tlindhet (see

below) and their human slaves or paramours. The rest can actually

trace their bloodlines to one of the Firstthe 112 half-elf priest-

esses of Loviatar who brokered the deal to rule Dambrath on behalf

of the drow. Known as Children of the First, these Crinti have

the highest status in Dambrathan society, though their ancestry

might include more human than elf or drow blood.

The typical present-day Crinti has a convoluted lineage

that incorporates several dierent drow Houses, plus humans,

half-drow, and occasionally a half-elf priestess of Loviatar. The

Crinti constitute Dambraths nobilitythe ruling class that

owns the property, runs the government, and enjoys the fruits

of the landor rather, they do so on behalf of their full-blooded

drow patrons.

Crinti enjoy positions of authority in Dambrath that they

could never attain anywhere else in Faern. But while they have

risen to the top of the social ladder on the surface world, they

are still little more than half-breed bumpkins in the eyes of their

drow patrons beneath the Gnollwatch Mountains. Because of this

double standard, most Crinti spend their lives striving to outdo

one another and to prove their worthboth to the drow they

serve and to themselves.

A typical Crinti has dark gray or black skin, with silver or

white hair and eyes of almost any color known among humans

or elves. Some Children of the First, however, are pale-skinned,

like their human and half-elf ancestors.

Drow of Tlindhet

The drow of Tlindhet, the subterranean city located several miles

below Dambrath, rarely visit the surface lands to which they lay

claim. Members of Tlindhets various great Houses prefer to

scheme and plot against one another as they always have, leaving

the less appealing task of managing their surface holdings to their

Crinti governors. Despite their dislike of the other races involved

in this strange relationship, the drow have found it advantageous

to let the Crinti control their interests on the surface and rule

over the human laborers. In this way, the dark elves gain the

advantage of surface-world trade without the distasteful necessity

of actually interacting with the plebeian creatures that make it

possible. Because of this arrangement, the road between the plains

of Dambrath and the caverns of Tlindhet remains open to trade,

rather than serving as a battleeldbetweensurfacedwellersand

the denizens of the Underdark.

The drow of Tlindhet have yet to acknowledge the Silence of

Lolth to their surface-dwelling kin, but maintaining that secret

has forced them to cede even more control of Dambrath to the

Crinti. Moreover, whispers have begun to spread among the Crinti

that the surface-dwelling followers of Lolth have lost the favor

of the Spider Queen. So far, however, they do not suspect how

widespread the problem really is.

Life and Society

The social divisions within Dambrath segregate the population

not only by race but also by gender. The loftiest positions in both

government and culture are reserved for female Crinti; all others

are viewed as inferior in some capacity. The combined inuence

of the drow overlords and the Church of Loviatar established

this unusual political and social division some vehundredyears

ago, and it has remained in place ever since.

The mixed-heritage Crinti rule the land on behalf of the drow

who claim it from below. The Shebalithe human descendants of

the Arkaiun horsepeople who originally roamed the landcon-

stitute the vast majority of the citizens. In Dambrathan society,

the Crinti enjoy the privileges, and the Shebali serve at their

pleasure.

But the racial separation of the citizenry is only half the

storyDambrath is also a true matriarchal society. As in the

drow civilization and the church of Loviatar, females hold the

reins of power in Dambrath. Though this social order is more

pronounced in the noble court than among the common folk,

females maintain a position of superiority over males in most

aspects of Dambrathan culture. The fact that both the priest-

esses of the Maiden of Pain and the drow embraced this precept

permitted the two groups to ndacommongroundonwhich

to build their unusual relationship vecenturiesago.Withoutit,

the drow claims to the surface might not have survived against

even weakened humans for long.

In the cities and at the higher levels of society, the matri-

archal social structure is much more pronounced than it is in

the countryside. Females attain positions of power within the

government more frequently than males, and female Crinti are

the only citizens permitted to function as honglath, or judges (see

Law and Order, below). Females expect males to show them every

courtesy, to walk behind them in the street, and to defer to them

in all matters relating to intellect. Both females and males serve

in the military, though women hold most of the ocerpositions.

In fact, noble families consider it a great honor for their ospring

to serve in some branch of Dambraths military as ocers.

Economy

Despite its isolationist policies (see Politics and Power, below),

Dambrath trades briskly with the rest of Faern, and even beyond.

The nation has three major exports: horses, silver, and pearls. Its

other export commodities include nishedwoodengoods(cabinets,

chairs, tables, and other furniture, as well as nelycraftedarrow

shafts) made of lumber cut from the Amtar, plus fruit harvested

from orchards in the Hills of the Dead Kings and sh caught in

the Bay of Dancing Dolphins. Because so much of the countrys

population is clustered in the port towns and cities along the

coast, shipping trac is vigorous, bringing a steady stream of

goods from other lands to citizens eager to trade.

So much of the plains country north of the coast is devoted to

horse ranches that horseeshprovidesthemajorityofthecountrys

income. Owning a ranch on the open plains is both lucrative and

101

Dambrath

prestigious, since the horses bred by the Crinti landowners are prized

all along the coast of the Great Sea, as well as in other parts of

the world, such as Zakhara. Unsurprisingly, Dambrathan horse

merchants are said to be among the shrewdest in Faern.

Those few landed gentry who have not invested in the horse trade

usually put their money into mining silver from the Gnollwatches.

Mine owners often form consortiums to enhance their protability

and ensure maximum exploitation of the veins located.

The pearl trade provides a good living for divers all along the

coast. Because of the bays sheltered nature and the clarity of its

waters, oyster beds are both plentiful and easy to nd. Thus, a

divers daily take is often valued at several hundred gold pieces.

Pearl traders sell many of these pearls to wealthy Crinti, who are

constantly working to outshine their political and social rivals

through displays of conspicuous consumption, but plenty remain

for export.

Occasionally, a diver might be fortunate enough to haul in a

special Dambrathan pearl. Found only in the waters of the Bay

of Dancing Dolphinsand then only rarelythese pearls have

an oddly rich, blue-green hue. A Dambrathan pearl fetches ve

times a normal pearls value in Dambrath, or seven to ten times

normal value in other trading centers.

Though the majority of Dambraths trade is sea-based, a steady

ow of caravans visits the nation from the north, arriving via

the Traders Way from Delzimmer. The Queen of Dambrath,

in keeping with her isolationism, maintains a policy forbidding

caravans from coming any farther into the country than Cathyr,

and every single train is inspected thoroughly in Dunfeld before

it can proceed farther south. This high level of security slightly

depresses prices for most goods, since everything must be sold in

Cathyr and then borne to other Dambrathan markets by local

merchants. Still, the business is lucrative enough that the caravan

masters are more than willing to put up with the inconvenience.

Even as part of a caravan, however, elves other than drow may

not enter the country. Any caught attempting entry are taken

into custody and sent to the temples of Loviatar.

Law and Order

For legal purposes, an individual must be able to prove that he

has at least 1/32 drow or First blood to be classied as Crinti. In

practice, Crinti who have the look of drow or elves (dusky skin or

pointed ears) receive more favorable treatment than those who

appear more human.

The laws of Dambrath are structured, and justice is swift and

often harsh. Judges known as honglath preside over trials and

make all decisions regarding legal issues. Only Crinti females may

become honglath, and they guard their power as judges ercely.

Typically, punishments for crimes committed by Crinti consist

of nes(exceptinextremecircumstances),whileShebalisuer

harsher penalties, such as torture at the hands of the Maiden

of Pains priestesses. In both cases, males typically receive more

severe penalties than their female counterparts. The sentence for

the most heinous crimeshorse theft, teaching a male any sort

of magic, or overstepping the jurisdiction of a honglathis death

by slow torture in the temples. In the case of teaching magic to

a male, the perpetrator is stripped of titles and lands, then sent

to the temples. The male who received the instruction is either

executed or subjected to a feeblemind spell and sent to work in

the silver mines.

Only Crinti may own land in Dambrath, and inheritance is

passed down via the female linethough not necessarily to the

oldest. The local honglath, rather than the Crinti matron herself,

decides who inherits property. Often, the daughter who demon-

strates the most initiative, good sense, and general aptitude for

managing assets earns the inheritance. Occasionally, a honglath

divides a Crinti matrons wealth up among all her daughters. If

the matron has no daughters or granddaughters, a male child may

inherit the property, provided that he is married. In such a case,

his wife immediately assumes control of the estate. If the male

inheritor is not married, he must take a wife so that the property

can be properly passed down. A honglath often arranges the mar-

riage if the matron was unable to do so before her death. More

than a few Crinti males have discovered a newfound popularity

among eligible females when such a situation occurs.

Defense and Warcraft

The Crinti value a strong military presence for many reasonsto

deter Shebali uprisings, to enforce Dambraths isolationist poli-

cies, and because their heritage and relationship with the drow

earn them varying degrees of enmity from other lands. Thus,

Dambraths leaders maintain standing military forces in every

major city.

The typical communitys land-based military presence consists

of one-third infantry and two-thirds cavalry. The infantry is typi-

cally composed of light foot soldiers trained for quick movement

over long distances rather than for heavy ghting.Theamount

of ground they must cover and the extremely hot and unpleasant

conditions prohibit wearing heavy armor and lugging a great deal of

equipment about. The cavalry usually consists of two-thirds heavy

and one-third light (skirmishers), and the riders tactics reectthe

need to outdistance and surround enemies in the open plains.

Every port larger than a village maintains a eetofonetosix

fast-moving frigates. These warships are staedwithanumber

of spellcasters to aid in tracking down and destroying pirates and

smugglers who try to slip into the Bay of Dancing Dolphins and

disrupt the trade. Some of the wealthier Crinti also fund their

own merchant eets and retain privateers to escort them, so

that they can transport their own goods to market. Predictably,

rival private eets frequently employ terror tacticsincluding

piracyon one another. Depending on the politics of the moment,

the Dambrathan ports eetmightturnablindeyetosuchacts,

or it may mete out swift and harsh justice.

Religion

The ocial religion of Dambrath is the worship of Loviatar,

since her priestesses provided considerable aid to the drow during

their conquest of the Arkaiuns. Every large community has a

major temple dedicated to the Maiden of Pain, complete with a

full complement of priestesses and torture facilities. Aspects of

her faith pervade many elements of Dambrathan societypar-

ticularly entertainment for the masses and punishment of crimes

(including all capital punishments).

Not everyone in Dambrath chooses to observe the state religion.

Some Arkaiuns still secretly revere Malar, as their ancestors did

102

Dambrath

before the coming of the drow, and more than a few displaced folk

in the Swagdar still acknowledge the Beastlord as a necessary element

of the hunt. The majority of the full-blooded drow who have chosen

to dwell on the surface venerate Lolth, but a very small minority of

both drow and Crinti choose to pay homage to Eilistraee. Loviatars

clerics are willing to look the other way regarding Malars and

Lolths inuencebecauseofthosedeitiesrelationshipswiththeirs,

but they are less pleased with the foothold that the Lady of the

Dance has established in Dambrathan society.

Adventurers

Beyond the fact that some races are simply not welcome in the

country, Dambraths leaders frown mightily on outsiders traipsing

around on their lands, and they have enacted laws to prevent it.

Groups that appear to be from somewhere else draw the suspicion

of the Crinti, who consider them trespassing merchants at best

and spies or horse thieves at worst.

Despite this lack of hospitality, more than a few adventurers

have risked capture to explore the ruins on the fringes of the

civilized lands. The most brazen of these adventurers regularly

attempt to reach the Great Swamp and Ilimar, and more than a few

target the Gate of Iron Fangs, Guilmarl, and Ammathtar in their

search for wealth and secrets. The Dambrathans give a token show

of patrolling some of these areas to dissuade such intrusions, but

the expense is prohibitive and the results generally unsatisfying.

Politics and Power

Hasir,thecurrentQueenofDambrath,cantraceherbloodline

directly to the original queen, who took control with the bless-

ing of the drow shortly after the defeat of Reinhar IX and his

Arkaiun forces. Though the history of Dambraths Crinti royalty

is full of intrigue and betrayal, the same family has managed

to maintain rm control of the throne for ve centuries. Such

stability does not ensure the current queens safety, however. Many

of Hasirs cousins hold seats of power throughout Dambrath,

and more than a few of them scheme to unseat her and rule in

her place.

Despite its relatively threatening posture, Dambrath is decid-

edly standoshwithrespecttoothernations.TheCrintiarent

interested in conquering anyone elsethey enjoy the creature

comforts of home too much to go otowar.Buttheyrecognize

all too well that other nations might not be convinced of their

disinterest, particularly because of Dambraths relationship with

the drow of Tlindhet. Thus, they nditnecessarytomaintaina

reasonable military force to dissuade those nations from acting

on their fears.

For their part, the drow of Tlindhet feel the same way. They

have more than enough business to occupy their energies in the

Underdark without worrying about the goings-on above, much

less the happenings beyond Dambraths borders. As long as the

Crinti continue to manage Dambraths aairs eectively and

keep a steady owofgoodspassingbetweenthesurfaceandthe

Underdark, the dark elves are happy.

Queen Hasir realizes that the Crinti are not the sole bas-

tion of power in Dambrath, and she would like very much to

change that situation. But she is wise enough to know that there

is little to be gained and much to be lost by confronting Ferla

Treerunner in the Forest of Amtar or King Ghassis in the Great

Swamp. Even chasing down the rebels hiding out in the Swagdar

would probably put enough strain on her forces and weaken the

country against invasion from the outside. Thus, she presents a

remarkably disinterested face regarding these issues, believing

that she can reduce their signicance accordingly.

History of Dambrath

The history of Dambrath is a brief one. Despite its advantageous

geography and relatively favorable climate, settlers took a long

time to arrive here from other parts of Faern. The nations

short history can be broken into two main periods: the time of

the humans, and the time of the Crinti.

Government

Dambrath is a matriarchal society ruled by a queen who also

serves as the High Priestess of the Temple of Loviatar. The queen

selects Crinti nobles to ll the other posts within the national

government, including but not limited to the honglath (judges),

the commanders of the military, and the senior priestesses of

Loviatars temples in other cities.

The current Queen of Dambrath is Hasir Hazmcri (LE

female half-drow wizard 12/cleric 4 of Loviatar), whoin deance

of customwas a powerful wizard rather than a high cleric of

Loviatar when she took the throne. Her selection came as a sur-

prise to her subjects, who fully expected her mother Yenandra (LE

female half-drow rogue 3/cleric 10 of Loviatar/scourge maiden

3), the so-called Pirate Queen, to name one of Hasirs sisters

as successor, since both were clerics who shared their mothers

taste for sailing and pillage. But Yenandra was visibly failing from

both old age and a wasting disease that baedDambrathsclerics.

In exchange for the throne, Hasir oered her mother a spell

104

Dambrath

that would allow her to choose the manner and time of her own

death, bind her to the land she had ruled for so long, and weave

her name into undying legend.

With the help of a circle of drow sorcerers and the blessing of

Loviatar, Hasir transformed Yenandra and her favorite horse

into a spectral guardian and a nightmare, respectively. Now,

during the dark of the moon, the people of Dambrath often

report seeing a beautiful Crinti rider and her horse, their eyes

glowing with red light, moving soundlessly across the countryside.

Now called the Nightmare Queen, Yenandra is both loved and

feared, as she was during life, and the red lights of her eyes have

become a common sight in Dambrath.

Upon taking the throne, Hasirwasforcedtoaccepttherole

of High Priestess of Loviatar as well as the crown. Thus, she

began clerical training and has proven an apt enough student,

though she has to rely heavily on advisors within Loviatars

church to perform the more important ceremonies until she is

procientenoughtodothemherself.Thus,herclericaladvisors

wield considerably more political power than Loviatars secondary

priestesses normally would.

Crinti duchesses and baronesses hold traditional and hereditary

seats of power in Dambraths various cities, ruling the urban cen-

ters and the lands around them with the support of the honglath

and the local temple of Loviatar. Though the honglath hold trials

and pass judgment on criminals, the duchesses and the temple

are responsible for enforcing those rulings and meting out the

punishments. In Dambrath, governmental processes are tightly

intertwined with the tenets of the Maiden of Pains faitheach

compliments and supports the other across many facets of daily

life. The three components of the political structurethe nobility,

the honglath, and the templesfunction as a set of checks and

balances for one another. Because the queen derives her power from

the support of these groups, she takes care to ensure that she has

the full backing of at least two of them on any given issue.

Enemies

From the Crintis point of view, just about every other government

or power center in southern Faern is a potential enemyif for no

other reason than the general hatred of drow and their kin that

pervades most of Faern. However, this xenophobia has waned to

some degree with Dambraths emergence as a valued trade partner

in both sea and land commerce. Because of this commercial poten-

tial and the fact that Dambrath has shown no signs of hostility in

a number of decades, a cautious peace reigns between Dambrath

and its neighbors. Still, the chance of sudden conictkeepsthe

leaders of each country eying the others nervously.

Halruaa

Of all the nations with which Dambrath has engaged in

armed conict in the past, its neighbor to the west is perhaps

the least willing to believe that the Crinti desire peace. The

Halruaan wizards are suspicious already because of their keen

fear of invasion by nations greedy for their magic, but they

particularly distrust Dambrath, since both the Crinti and the

Arkaiuns before them have given the wizards good reason to

doubt that peace can hold. Even today, despite Queen Hasirs

ocialstanceofneutrality,Dambrathanprivateerssometimes

prey on Halruaan merchant ships, and Crinti shadow maraud-

ers regularly ride into the Nath to harass and raid Halruaan

citizens there. Yenandra sent emissaries to Halarahh on more

than occasion to assuage the wizards concerns, but she secretly

enjoyed watching them bristle and bluster about her lack of

control over her own people.

Since Queen Hasirs ascension to the throne, the Halruaan

wizards have grown more concerned about invasion because of

her intense interest in magic. Rumors suggest that she plans

to unleash new spells upon her western neighbor, including

some acquired from drow sorcerers, to gain access to the fabled

Halruaan magic. Worse still, some of the more ambitious and

unscrupulous members of Halruaas growing cult of Shar have

begun to wonder whether Crinti magic might speed their ascent

to power. Though all Halruaans are insular and somewhat xe-

nophobic, the corrupting inuenceoftheShadowWeavemight

sway the emerging sorcerers in their midst to seek dangerous new

alliances with their Crinti neighbors.

Wild Elves

The wild elves living in the Forest of Amtar constitute Dam-

braths only stable elf population. The Trunadar are dedicated

to battling the drow of Tlindhet to ensure that the forest never

falls to the dark elves the way the rest of Dambrath has.

Though few other elves have any interest in setting foot inside

the countrys borders, they would not be sorry to see its Crinti

power structure crumble into ruin. But the elves returning from

the Retreat have little interest in moving against Dambrath

directly, since they have far too many other crises to contend

with (such as the drow invasion of Cormanthor). However, if the

Arkaiuns were to rise up against their oppressors, more than a few

elf adventurers might be willing to aid the cause of freedom.

Cities and Sites

Most of Dambraths population lives in the various cities, towns,

and villages along the coast. Almost every community of any

size on the Bay of Dancing Dolphins is a port, and more trac

occurs by boat than on foot among these settlements. Every

harbor is lled with shing boats, and substantial markets on

shore handle the incoming and outgoing trade goods. Each of the

larger port cities features a sizable stockyard, where the prized

horses from the ranches await their sale to merchants, who in

turn ship them to far-o ports.

The rest of Dambraths citizens reside on the ranches scat-

tered across the plains or in the mining camps nestled along the

south side of the Gnollwatch range. Each ranch is a sprawling,

self-sucientcommunitythatincludesa mainmanorhousefor

the Crinti owners, barracks for the ranch hands, a smithy/armory

for ironworking, numerous barns and grain storage buildings,

and several corrals. These buildings are surrounded by thousands

and thousands of acres of open grassland, where herds of horses

run. The proprietor of the smallest such ranch might own a

herd numbering close to a hundred, while the wealthiest Crinti

rancher might own a dozen or more separate ranches, each with

several thousand horses.

105

Dambrath

Cathyr (Metropolis)

Somewhat surprisingly, the capital city of Dambrath does not

sit on the Bay of Dancing Dolphins, but rather just east of its

mouth, on the shore of a smaller bay along the coast. Cathyr

marks the southern end of the Traders Way, which runs almost

due north up the eastern side of the country toward Delzim-

mer. Formerly known as Shantil, Cathyr is perhaps the most

cosmopolitan city in Dambrath. Indeed, the right amount of

coin can buy almost anything here.

Thick, solid stone walls surround Cathyr, but the gates are

seldom closed. The marketplace actually sits outside the walls to

the north of the city, since the stockyards where horse trading

occurs take up far too much space to be contained inside. In fact,

caravans arriving from the Traders Way must stop in the mar-

ketplace, and their wagons may not enter the city proper, though

caravan personnel who are not elves can do sofor a fee.

The queens palace sits near the center of the city, surrounded

on all sides by broad green parks. On one side of the palace is

the nations largest temple to Loviatar; on the other is a slightly

less august temple dedicated to Lolth. This latter temple sports

ying buttresses shaped to resemble spider legs, and its main

entrance is carved to resemble a spiders head and mouth.

The inner city is a crowded, bustling, aromatic place. The

smells of hay and horse manure permeate the air, since the nobles

maintain several hundred stabled horses here. The wealthy live

in roomy townhomes that rise two to three stories up from the

wide streets of their neighborhoods, most of which are located on

the west side of the city. Most of Cathyrs poor crowd together in

the eastern section of town, closer to the docks. Some, however,

dwell outside the city walls in hovels that stretch southward along

the coast in a wide band. In this area, sharecropping farmers

who work land owned by the Crinti provide much of the food

for the folk living inside the city walls. Legally speaking, these

human and humanoid workers are indentured debtors and minor

criminals who can earn their own freedom with years of hard

labor in the elds of their Crinti mistresses, but in practice they

are little more than slaves.

Cathyr maintains a garrison of 2,000 troops to keep order in

the city, battle invaders, or overcome monsters that threaten the

populace. This military force is roughly two-thirds cavalry and

one-third foot soldiers. The garrison is commanded by Rimala

Grevos (LN female half-drow ghter 6/evoker 7), a competent

leader who also happens to be a Daughter of the First, though

she has little political ambition.

In addition to this land force, Cathyr maintains a eet of

twelve warships. Half of these vessels are out patrolling the waters

near the city at any given time, while the rest are positioned to

defend the port.

Herath (Large City)

Located at the headwaters of the River Dambron, Herath boasts

a population of nearly 18,000, making it the third-largest city

in Dambrath. The citys economy centers around the silver

mined in the mountains just to the north, as well as a lively

smithing trade. Most of the nations dwarves reside in Herath,

where they earn top coin for their smithing work. A number

of human smiths have also made names for themselves here.

So good are the smiths of Herath that they equip most of

Dambraths armed forces.

Selanith Lbaros (LE female half-drow aristocrat 13), the

baroness of Herath, is a cruel woman with a fondness for games

and contests that end in death. The city arena oers regular

events designed to sate the baronesss unusual tastes. Selanith

is Queen Hasirs third cousin, and like many Crinti related to

royalty, she hopes that someone in her family (preferably herself)

will one day sit on the throne. But although she is ambitious, she

is also realistic; she has only 1/32 drow blood, and her features

resemble those of a human far more than a dark elf. Still, she

was shrewd enough to take a male drow as her consort, so her

daughters should all be quite eligible for the crown should the

opportunity ever arise.

Maarlith (Metropolis)

Like its sister city Cathyr to the east, Maarlith is one of the

busiest trade ports in Dambrath, though its population is only

a bit more than three-quarters that of the capital. Since foreign

trade caravans cant venture any deeper into Dambrath than

Cathyr, Maarlith has become the dispersal point for most of

the trade goods destined for the interior of the country, almost

all of which arrive here by ship. Much of the citys business

district is occupied by Crinti trading costers whose sole business is

transporting needed goods and luxury items inland to the other

towns, villages, and ranches. In addition to the ships carrying

goods from elsewhere along the coast, the citys docks are crowded

with oceangoing vessels bringing trade items from other lands

and loading up with goods for export. Like Cathyr, Maarlith

maintains huge stockyards just outside its walls, where many of

the ranchers house the horses they intend to sell.

The baroness of Maarlith, Joine Dulare (LE female half-

drow ghter 7/Crinti shadow marauder 5), spent much of her

pampered youth becoming an expert horsewoman, and she rode

about the countryside with a small following of friends whenever

she pleased. She even ventured into the Nath region of Halruaa

several times to raid the villages there, just for the fun of it.

Joine inherited the rulership of Maarlith after she and several

of her friends bribed the house guard, kidnapped her mother

while she was vacationing at one of her numerous ranches, and

then hunted her down for sport.

Purl (Village)

The name of this pirate haven on the coast of the Great Sea

is a bastardization of pearl, the gem that many of its visitors

use to pay their expenses. Nestled among the hills, the village is

half hidden from both the sea to the south and the rest of the

country to the north. In reality, Purl is little more than a shanty

towna fetid collection of brothels, beer halls, ophouses,and

gambling dens. Its merchants cater to the less savory types who

make their livings aboard the corsairs ships and privateers vessels

that sail the high seas around Dambrath.

Most of Purls visitors are grizzled veterans of the sea, though

not all are independent fortune-hunters. In fact, at least half the

sailors in port at any one time are in the service of one or another

of the Crinti nobles, though the seadogs themselves might not even

realize that they work for someone other than their captains.

With a population just a little above 400, Purl is large enough

to cater to every visitors tastes, yet small enough to be beneath

most folks notice. In fact, were it not for the ships that anchor in

its small, sheltered harbor and the orange glow of its nighttime

res,noonewouldknowthetownexisted,sinceitsbuildingsare

hidden from sight.

Though Purl is nominally under the jurisdiction of Dambraths

matriarchy, the Crinti completely ignore it. The village has no

lawsonly the understanding that no one rules anyone else.

Fights are not just common, they are part of the attraction, and

more than a few unlucky souls wind up dead each night when

the carousing gets too rowdy.

Tlindhet (Small City)

The drow living below the Gnollwatch Mountains might have

a valid claim to the lands of Dambrath, but few of them ever

venture forth from the more pleasant, shadowy connesoftheir

home city. With a population of slightly more than 9,000 drow

and slaves, Tlindhet is somewhat small compared to many of

its sister cities in the Underdark. Still, it can be a formidable

opponent, as the Arkaiuns discovered half a millennium ago.

The city proper is situated atop an immense plateau inside

an elongated cavern about 3 miles below the surface. A great

underground river owsthroughthecavern,partingatthebase

of the plateau into two streams that skirt the sides of the rise

before rejoining on the opposite end. On the cavern oor,beyond

the protection of the plateau, the drow have established a separate

market village right at the end of the trade route that emerges

107

Dambrath

near Herath. Within this area, merchants from the surface and

elsewhere in the Underdark congregate to ply their trade. As a

result of this unusual proximity to a permanent commercial site,

the drow of Tlindhet enjoy a variety of goods from all over

Faern at better than reasonable prices.

Tlindhet boasts fourteen great drow Houses, which languidly

vie for control of both the city and the lands above. Since their

conquest of Dambrath, the drow of Tlindhet have fallen into a

rather placid state of comfort. Seemingly content to enjoy their

accumulated wealth, they display little of the ambition that drives

other drow. Perhaps the drow of Tlindhet have grown soft, but

with the increased creature comforts that their trading acumen

has bought, they see little reason to play such destructive games

of maneuver and countermaneuver. They have not completely

abandoned their drow wayscertainly the members of every

House enjoy the spectacle of rival siblings struggling for control

of the estate, and occasionally an opportunity for one House to

bring another low is too ripe to pass up. All in all, however, the

citizens of Tlindhet would rather partake of the fruits of the

lesser races labors than struggle to advance themselves.

Heroes and Monsters

Despite its busy commerce and growing population, Dambrath

produces surprisingly few adventurers. Those rare characters who

do take up the adventuring life are mostly humans or Crinti.

Human adventurers are either Arkaiuns seeking a better life

outside the oppression of their Crinti mistresses, or the ospring

of outlaws from the Swagdar. Most of the Crinti who choose

this path are simply dissatised with their lives as pampered

nobles, but a few take up adventuring because they feel that

their more humanlike visages prevent them from gaining

prestige within the ranks of the nobility. Regardless of their

race, males often have a strong desire to escape the oppression

they face in Dambrath. Lizardfolk characters might leave the

Great Swamp and strike out on their own, and occasionally a

half-orc or gnoll who has grown tired of life as a bodyguard

or sellsword might be ready to leave Dambrath in search of

something more.

The regions from Chapter 1 suitable for Dambrathan charac-

ters include the Forest of Amtar region and the Rethild region.

Of the prestige classes in Chapter 2, the Crinti shadow marauder,

the scourge maiden, and the Great Sea corsair are all designed

for characters originating from Dambrath.

The monsters from Chapter 5 frequently found in Dam-

brath include the beguiler, the dark tree, the mantimera, the

tall mouther, and the tasloi. Other creatures commonly found

in the country include gnolls, various giants, lizardfolk, nagas,

and drow.

A typical night in Purl

108

D urpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden, the three

trading nations collectively known as the Shin-

ing Lands, sprawl around the large bay known

as the Golden Water, just otheGreatSea.Thesebalmycountries

soak up the warmth of the southern sun at what most folk consider

to be the extreme southeastern end of Faern. Many assume that

the Shining Lands mark the end of the civilized world, since all that

lies beyond the bay is the Utter Easta collection of lands known

to most of Faern only through legends too fantastic to be believed.

Some claim that the Shining Lands have taken on many of the

strange characteristics of their more bizarre eastern neighbors and

as such are hardly recognizable as part of Faern at all.

Though Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden dierintheir

forms of government and internal operations, all three champion

trade as a way of life. Merchant consortiums known as chakas

provide products and services, and their leaders, known as nawabs,

hold both political and economic power. All three nations also

embrace the Adama, a combination of a religious belief and a

code of conduct that guides citizens in their daily lives.

Geographic Overview

The Shining Lands stretch for nearly 500 miles, from the very

end of the Toadsquat Mountains and the Lluirwood eastward

to the nation of Ulgarth. From the Great Sea, which marks

the southern boundaries of Estagund and Var the Golden, the

territory rises gently until it reaches the southern slopes of the

Dustwall, covering a distance of nearly 250 miles. Estagund

occupies the western part of the plains, while Var the Golden

extends out onto the peninsula on the south side of the Golden

Water. Durpar hugs the bay along its southwestern, western,

and northern sides, occupying a narrow, horseshoe-shaped strip

of land between the water and two mountain ranges. Though

technically not considered part of the Shining Lands, Veldorn

(which is known as the Land of Monsters) sits closer to those

three countries than perhaps any other region. It occupies the

grassy stretch of land just north of Estagund, wedged between

the eastern limit of the Shaar and the Giants Belt Mountains.

109

Flat, sun-baked plains suitable for growing crops such as wheat,

coee,andwarm-weathervegetablesdominatetheShiningLands.

Where the land hasnt been tamed, the countryside consists of endless

miles of gently undulating ground covered with coarse grass, cactus,

and the occasional copse of squat, thorny trees. Dry gullies break

up the terrain from time to time, but otherwise, the only limit to

line of sight in this part of the world is the next distant rise.

Civilization in the Shining Lands clusters around the available

water. Towns and cities hug the coast of the bay and the banks of

any rivers large enough to continue owinginthehottest,driest

part of the summer. The areas farther inland are much more

thinly populated, despite the generally pleasant conditions. Few

humanoids live in any of the mountain ranges in and around the

Shining Lands, since the monsters that claim the slopes ght

ercely for the limited food supplies there.

The weather in the Shining Lands is hot almost all year. The

area gets plenty of sunshine and most of the country (with the

exception of the Great Seas coastline) experiences a mild rainy

season. On most days, steady breezes blowing otheoceancool

the land along the coast, making the temperature bearable once

the sun slips low in the west. Inland, the breezes gently billow

through the waving wheat, making the land seem like a great,

dun-colored ocean. During droughts, the winds in the plain

occasionally stir up great dust clouds that hamper travel.

Major Geographic

Features

Because most of the region consists of at,grain-coveredplains,

the unusual physical features of the Shining Lands stand out all

the more prominently. Some of these features serve as barriers

Estagund and the Shining Lands

along the borders, while others simply rise up from the midst of

the land like beacons.

The Aerilpar Forest

Known also as the Wood of Dark Trees, this small but dense tropical

forest is a gloomy, dangerous blight on an already monster-infested

regionthe far eastern section of Veldorn. The wood tswellwith

the rest of the Land of Monsters, since few who enter its steamy

depths ever return. Despite the Aerilpars reputation, more than a

few brave explorers have attempted to navigate it, seeking the many

treasures hinted at by rumors that circulate in other lands.

The two biggest threats within the Aerilpar Forest are the

ying snakes and the dark trees (see page 62). Both of these

creatures abound within the woods, somehow coexisting while

making the area extremely dangerous for other creatures. In

addition, a mated pair of chimeras has established a comfortable

nest near the middle of the forest. Each has a black dragon head,

and the two have trained a few of the native acid snakes to serve

as guard pets near the handful of eggs the female has laid.

In the very center of the forest, a 40-foot-diameter, 4-foot-

high, circular stone wall sits in a clearing, with tree branches

growing right up to it, but not over the top. Inside the wall, a steep,

grass-covered hill rises to a central peak more than 30 feet high.

A hallow spell and a permanent Mordenkainens private sanctum

spell protect the entire area inside the wall. Needless to say, the

creatures of the forest stay clear of this mysterious mound.

The Curna Mountains

This rather small range is sometimes known as the Bluetips or

the Mountains of Wisdom. These mountains stretch along the

northern coast of eastern Estagund and western Var, forming a

barrier between those two nations and the Golden Water to the

north. As mountains go, the Bluetips are short and well worn, with

far more gentle, grassy meadows and slopes than jagged outcrop-

pings of rock. The tangled copses of suth trees that dot the slopes

of the mountains occasionally make travel quite dicult.

Despite their unimposing appearance, few venture into the

Curna Mountains because the range has always been home to

a number of fell beasts. In fact, when the Durpari barbarians

rst began to settle the Shining Lands, they referred to the

northwestern end of the range as the Beastlands because of the

surprising number of deadly creatures that swarmed down out

of the lowest passes to harass them. Later, after the Durpari

had developed a more sedentary lifestyle, the creatures of the

mountains preyed upon their trading caravans.

Modern-day sages have speculated that some unnatural feature

hidden within the mountains (a portal, perhaps, or some magi-

cal monster-generating horror) must have caused this unusual

concentration of monsters. The tales and stories, along with the

few sketchy records that exist, seem to indicate a far greater rate

of population growth than normal, given the types of creatures

present and the available food. Regardless of the speculation, no

one has ever discovered any anomaly hidden in the mountains

that could possibly bring about such a situation, and the inuxof

new monsters has dropped considerably from what it was centuries

ago. Currently, a number of leucrottas roam the lower slopes of

the Curnas, occasionally wandering down toward human settle-

ments to prey on shepherds and travelers who stray too far from

safety. A mated pair of rocs that lives among the highest peaks

feasts primarily on the leucrottas, though the two occasionally

soar out over the bay to sh for sharks, dolphins, or marlins.

A true menace dwells in a cave complex high in the eastern

end of the range, just southeast of Ormp. Zesilias (LE medusa

sorcerer 5), who has a thirst for magic, hides in the mountains

with her manticore companion. The two work together to gain

treasures and magic items to feed Zesiliass habit. The manticore

wears an amulet of proof against petrication (see page 55) that

allows it to remain with the medusa without risking the eectsof

her gaze. Zesilias and her pet prey on the citizens of the coastal

communities just north of the mountains, often venturing forth

in disguises (magical and otherwise) in search of more magic.

Despite the dangers of the mountains, some dwarves recently

formed a merchant house (the Gemstone Chaka) in Ormp after

discovering a motherlode of emeralds there. Known as Curna

emeralds, these stones have an unusual mineral property that

causes their centers to give oaturquoiseglowwhencutproperly.

The chaka jealously guards the location of its mine, but rumors

around Ormp have hinted that the dwarves discovered an ancient

map in the citys great library that led them to the emerald veins.

The discovery of the Curna emeralds has made the Gemstone

Chaka quite wealthy in a short period of time, and its members

have gained considerable political clout. In fact, the head of the

Gemstone Chaka now holds a seat on the Nawab Council of

Durpar and was instrumental in the decision to relocate the

capital from Heldapan to Vaelan (see Politics and Power).

The Dustwall

The mountain range known as the Dustwall has many names,

including the Mountains of War, the Mountains of Adama, and

the Gryphon Mountains. Among the tallest mountain ranges

in Faern, the Dustwall forms a high, forbidding barrier that

separates Durpar from the Raurin Desert. Unlike the Curnas,

these mountains are raw, rough, and towering. Most peaks along

the highest central ridge easily reach 15,000 feet, and Adamas

Wrath, the highest point, tops 22,000 feet.

These harsh, treacherous mountains form an eectivebarrier

against the raging dust storms that pervade the Raurin on the far

side of the range. Legend has it that the Dustwall rose during the

cataclysm that destroyed the ancient Raurin Empire, and anyone

who views the range harbors little doubt as to the authenticity of

that tale. The Dustwall is rocky and steep, etched with gorges and

deadfalls all across its length. The hills that abut the mountains

are jagged, scree-covered ridges, the intervening valleys choked

with rocky outcroppings and thorny brush. Little vegetation grows

in the Dustwall range, except for the hardiest scrub growth.

Despite its forbidding nature, the Dustwall swarms with gray

orcs. Some say that the total number of these creatures exceeds

the population of the Shining Lands as a whole, though others

reject such a claim, pointing to the lack of available food to

support such numbers. Still, when a gray orc horde descends

upon the plains of Durpar to raid, its numbers sometimes equal

the population of a small town. Folk living near the gray orcs

hunting range are ever watchful for attacks. Recent reports have

indicated that a few rakshasas might be settling in among the

gray orcs, planning to bring them to heel and forge an empire

in the lowlands after the humans have been vanquished.

In addition to the gray orcs, the Dustwall range supports

wyverns and various kinds of giantkin, including ogres, cyclopes

(see page 64), stone giants, and hill giants, as well as a few storm

giants. Also, rumor has it that a frost giant clan dwells high

among the peaks, where the snows last year-round. No one is

certain how the frost giants could have gotten there when the

climate in the lowlands around the mountains is so hot, but the

rumors persist nonetheless.

The Giants Belt

Like the Dustwall, the Giants Belt range forms an impressive and

desolate barrier between the lowland plains of the Shining South

and Raurin. Actually a continuation of the Dustwall, the Giants

Belt range is nearly as high, and just as rocky and crag-lled.The

Giants Belt juts up suddenly and steeply from the grasslands of

Veldorn, looking all the more forbidding because of the drastic

change in elevation.

The Giants Belt is aptly named because the rubble-strewn

slopes of its mountains support a large and well-organized

clan of hill giants led by a particularly crafty and disagree-

able specimen named Gruzog Granitejaw (CN male hill giant

druid 5/runecaster 5). Gruzog has recently joined with the other

beast-chieftains of Veldorn in a mutual assistance pact. His clan

skirmishes occasionally with the stone giants that live in the far

northern end of the range.

The Golden Water

This tranquil bay forms the coastline for the majority of the

Shining Lands. Protected from the harsher ravages of the sea

by both land and barrier reef, the waters of this sheltered inlet

are unusually calm and clear. The shing in the Golden Water

is sublime, and the daily catch keeps almost every table in the

coastal settlements supplied with fresh seafood. At any given

moment, scores of trading ships and naval vessels are visible from

any point along the surface of the bay. Some of these ships carry

cargo to the various ports along the shore; others keep watch for

creatures that could menace the shipping.

The Golden Water contains certain minerals that give o a

warm, golden hue when struck by the light of the rising or setting

sun. This phenomenon is what originally gave both the bay and

the Shining Lands their names, though now, most Faernians

associate these monikers with the locals love of trade and the

gold it brings them.

Most of the sea creatures that dwell in the Golden Water

are peaceful, though schools of sharks sometimes disrupt the

pearl-diving and coral-gathering operations. The aquatic elf city

called Nemilar sits at the bottom of the bay in the middle of its

expanse, just northeast of Ormp. Several years ago, a fanatical

aquatic elf druid named Dilishae Lheilos (N male aquatic elf

112

Estagund and the Shining Lands

druid 12 of Deep Sashelas), used the awaken spell to give a giant

octopus sentience. He hoped to gain the creatures aid in stopping

the destruction of the coral reefs by nearby humans, who regularly

harvested chunks of the coral to make jewelry. The octopus, who

took the name Slulushtup, gladly provided the aid requested, but

it was not enough to stop the humans depredations. Afterward,

the octopus studied Dilishaes ways and eventually embraced the

druidic path himself. Now Slulushtup (N male awakened giant

octopus druid 9 of Deep Sashelas) has taken up residence near

the chain of islands that divides the eastern half of the bay from

the western half. He has begun using his own awaken spells to

create a cadre of intelligent sharks and dire sharks, which he has

convinced to patrol the reefs and attack coral harvesters.

Raurin, the Dust Desert

Sometime before the founding of Mulhorand and Unther, an

empire of wizards rose up in the eastern lands of Faern. Known

as Imaskar, this nation was a place of mighty magic, strange

technologies, and terrible hubris, even in the face of the deities

themselves. When the Imaskari brought a whole horde of slaves

through a portal and then sealed it to trap them in Imaskar for-

ever, no one dreamed that the deities of those slaves would come

to Toril and wreak their vengeance upon the prideful wizards.

The wasteland now known as the Dust Desert of Raurin is the

result of those deities dreadful vengeance.

Terrible sandstorms ravage the blasted land where Imaskar

once stood, tearing at the ground, the foothills, and the few

creatures bold enough to make their homes here. Lightning and

thunder rage back and forth across the featureless atlands,but

no rain ever falls. Clouds of dust swirl and buet everything in

their path, preventing even small piles of stones from remaining

intact for long.

A scant few creatures ndthelashingwindandtearing,blowing

sand to their liking. Both blue and brown dragons are fond of the

Dust Desert, though their battles with one another sometimes

rumble so loudly that they drown out the buetingwindshowling

around them. In addition, a few genies occasionally gather here for

private discussions or to battle one another. Djinn visit most often,

since the interminable winds are similar to those characteristic

of their home plane, but efreet also drop in from time to time

to enjoy the scorching air and bone-dry conditions.

Little remains of Imaskars great cities, and the few partial

structures that do exist are often buried in the shifting sands.

Legends speak of vast ruins lledwithwondrousandpowerful

artifacts, as well as long-lost secrets of magic coveted by modern-

day wizards. Rumors also persist of a great underground temple to

Set hidden somewhere in the center of one of those ruined cities.

Estagund and the Shining Lands

People of the

Shining Lands

For the most part, the people of the Shining Lands devote their

time and energy to furthering trade, accumulating creature com-

forts, and strengthening their bonds of mutual respect. Where

these fundamental aspects of civilization are lacking or the people

are oppressed (in Veldorn, for example), the residents struggle to

improve their lives, striving to emulate the shining example set

by Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden.

Races and Cultures

Though the dominant ethnic group of the Shining Lands is the

Durpari, the open, welcoming nature of the natives has ensured

that every recognizable race and ethnic group is represented

here. Traders and merchants who come from distant lands often

choose to spend extra time in one or more of the three countries

to enjoy the favorable climate and the hospitality. Some settle

down and intermarry with the natives; others simply visit for a

short time and take their leave.

Other than humans, halings are the most prevalent hu-

manoids in the Shining Lands, and they have established sizable

populations in both Estagund and Durpar. Most of these hin

have migrated from Luiren, either to establish trade or simply

to partake of the delights oered by another culture. Dwarves

congregate in both the Dustwall and the Curna Mountains, and

many have established powerful chakas, or merchant houses,

based on the mining of gold and gemstones. More than a few

half-elves live in the urban centers of the Shining Lands because

they are accepted and valued as individuals. Few elves live in

or visit these countries, however, since most of them nd the

strong focus on trade and wealth distasteful. In recent years,

more and more gnomes have begun to settle in the region,

because their talents as craftsfolk (particularly gemcutters) are

in great demand.

Durpari

The Durpari people have lived along the shores of the Golden

Water since before the rise of the Imaskari Empire. They never

really established a national identity in their formative years as

a people, since they were regularly enslaved, slaughtered, or aban-

doned to barbarism by various other groups around themmost

notably the Mulan of Mulhorand. Thereafter, except for a brief

period of conict in which the Arkaiuns of Dambrath invaded

and sacked much of the Shining Lands, the Durpari have been

free and independent people. Out of their relative isolation, the

Durpari have at last developed a national identity based on trade,

respect, and structured law.

The average Durpari stands only 5-1/2 feet tall and has dark,

almost ebony-colored skin and black or gray eyes. Her hair is

usually dark and thick, though once in a while, a child with deep

reddish-gold hair is born.

Folk in the Shining Lands speak Durpari, which has its roots

in Draconic, Mulhorandi, and Rauric. They employ the Thorass

alphabet, which was imported from the west.

Monsters (Veldorn)

The lands north of Estagund and northwest of Durpar are in-

fested with powerful and well-organized monsters, each of which

controls a portion of present-day Veldorn. Through sheer force

of personality and more than a little special power, the leaders

of these various organizations, who are known outside Veldorn as

beast-chieftains, have managed to form an alliance whereby they

protect one another from the depredations of armies from other

lands to the south, west, and north. Beyond this mutual defense

pact, the various kinds of monsters leave one another alone.

Veldorn began as a number of small Durpari settlements

along the western shore of the Golden Water, between the bay

and the Curna Mountains. Over time, creatures such as vampires,

beholders, wererats, and beings from the lower planes began to seep

down out of the mountainsmostly from the northwest region

known as the Beastlands. These evil creatures either overran

the human settlements outright or subtly insinuated themselves

into their power structures. Other sorts of monsters also shared

space with these creatures, either acting as servant races to more

powerful creatures or cohabitating for mutual benet.

Gradually, all the centers of civilization in the Veldorn region

fell under the sway of fell beasts, and the country became known

as the Land of Monsters. Other creatures, including a dragon

or two and the hill giants of the Giants Belt range, have since

joined the alliance, staking their own territorial claims. Through

the centuries, the humans of Durpar and Estagund have man-

aged to drive some of Veldorns creatures away from the coast

of the Golden Water and reclaim that area as their own, but the

beast-tribes have simply migrated to other areas still held by their

compatriots, causing Veldorns borders to shift north and west.

Life and Society

Life in the Shining Lands is surprisingly free, with none of the

heavy-handed interference from the power structure so common

in neighboring lands. As long as the citizens follow the way of the

Adama (see Law and Order and Religion, below), they can generally

pursue their business aairsastheyseet.Becauseitpervades

so many of the day-to-day activities in the Shining Lands, the

Adama allows the people to govern themselves, eectivelynegating

the need for a central authority. Durpar, where society revolves

around business, serves as the best model of this arrangement. In

Estagund, much the same situation prevails, though the ruler still

makes the major decisions and commands a high level of respect

and service from the people. In Var the Golden, the lifestyle of the

average merchant or laborer is the same in most ways as it would

be in the other two states, but life at the top is decidedly more

political, with three factions constantly struggling for political

power. Such posturing tends to draw attention away from business

and force the citizens to take sides in debates whether they want

to or not. But the fact that commerce remains the driving force

behind the struggle ties Var the Golden tightly to the other two

nations of the Shining Lands.

Economy

The business of the Shining Lands is business, or so the popular

saying goes. The Durpari people have long practiced trade as

114

Estagund and the Shining Lands

a way of life, and they have become exceptionally good at it.

Durpari like to claim that their focus on commerce came about

as a more peaceful means of competition than warring with one

anothera practice that long held the various nomadic tribes

back from advancement as a people. With the recognition of the

Adama, the Durpari turned from killing one another to trying

to outdo one another in the marketplace. The resulting devotion

to material gain spawned a people so skilled in bargaining that

they rival even the people of Amn.

Since trade is the center of life in the Shining Lands, the chaka

(trading house) is the most prominent kind of organization in

the region. Most Durpari identify a citizen by his chaka before

even his family, though in most cases, family and chaka are one

and the same. A small chaka might operate only a single busi-

ness, such as a laundry or a cheese shop, while the most powerful

might actually have a number of smaller chakas under its wing.

These larger chakas are usually diversiedandself-supporting,

managing a number of businesses and trade routes. Often, they

set up shops in other lands to sell the same goods they export

from their own countries.

Unlike many countries, the nations of the Shining Lands

welcome any kind of coinage minted elsewhere. A Durpari

merchant doesnt care whether a gold coin came from Cormyr

or Calimshan, as long as it is gold. Though they examine coins

carefully to ensure that they are legitimate, they happily accept

them at face value.

The countries of the Shining Lands export a number of

natural products, the most important of which is grain. Durpari

farmers harvest acres of wheat from the endless stretches of open

plains to sell in the markets of other lands. Gems of various

types, coee,sh,anda fewkindsoffruitandvegetablesarealso

shipped from ports in the Shining Lands to other parts of Faern.

Manufactured goods are gradually becoming important export

commodities too, as are trade goods from other lands. Durpari

chakas specializing in exotic goods bring products from distant

Zakhara and Maztica to the Shining Lands, where they are sold

to both the local people and the merchants who wish to ship them

to far-ung Amn, Waterdeep, and Thesk, among other places.

Law and Order

The Durpari hold very strongly to their belief in a code of conduct

known as the Adama. This code aectseveryaspectofsociety,

from trade practices to punishments for crimes. Both a religious

belief and a way of life, the Adama dictates how citizens should

conduct themselves in all aspects of life. Because so much of life

in the Shining Lands centers around trade, however, the precepts

of the Adama tend to focus on a persons conduct in business.

In general terms, those who adhere to the Adama view all

crimes as theftwhether the perpetrator has stolen property,

life, or the trust of another. Thus, fraud is considered just as

heinous a crime as murder, and unfair or dishonest business

practices draw penalties just as harsh as those imposed for more

traditional crimes. Few criminals receive second chances here,

since tolerance for injustice is minimal.

In general, punishments for crimes in the Shining Lands t

the culture. Fines are eectivedeterrentsinasocietythatvalues

commerce and wealth above almost all else. Even trying to pass

substandard products o as quality workmanship can result

in nancially crippling punitive damages. Furthermore, since

citizens are quick to abandon a chaka that has been found guilty

of underhanded business practices, the scaldamageoftenfar

exceeds the mere neslevied.Morethanafewchakashavelost

both business and political clout (see Government, below) when

consumers registered their dissatisfaction with their coin purses.

Interestingly enough, Durpari society views capital punish-

ment as an oenseagainsttheAdama.Thus,peoplefoundguilty

of capital crimes are restrained, usually as indentured workers

in mines or on farms, instead of being put to death. For most

oenses,suchenforcedservitudelastsonlyafewyears,butthe

criminal must begin again with nothing upon releasea second-

ary punishment in itself. Those not rehabilitated after an initial

sentence are restrained for the rest of their lives.

Defense and Warcraft

Each country in the Shining South handles its military aairs

in a slightly dierent manner, though the end result is nearly

the same across the entire region.

Durpar: Like all other matters in Durpar, national defense is

treated as a business proposition and contracted out to the private

sector. Thus, instead of maintaining a national standing army, the

country entrusts its defense to a collection of privately operated

mercenary companies, each based out of whichever city funds

its operations. The nawabs of the various communities handle

the hiring of the defense chakas, but the execution of the local

defense is generally left up to the heads of the chakas that receive

the contracts.

Every city and town in Durpar collects sucient taxes from

the sale of goods (see Government, below) to pay a contract for

defense. The larger ports typically hire chakas that specialize in

naval defense, but even the tiniest town usually hires a defense

chaka, though it might be no more than an extended family of

traditional soldiers. More than a few adventuring groups have

chosen to retire in Durpar, form a chaka, and accept a contract

to defend the community they call home.

Estagund: Unlike in Durpar, where absolutely every function is

a business process, the time-honored tradition of a noble warrior

class is still alive and well in Estagund. Known as the Maquar,

the members of this noble class follow a highly restrictive code of

conduct that dictates many aspects of their lives and limits or pro-

hibits many activities. In exchange for these sacrices,theMaquar

are freed from the responsibility of providing for themselves so

they can devote their lives entirely to the protection of the people.

The Maquar are answerable only to the Rajah of Estagund and

those he deems ttolead(usuallytheleadersofthevariouscities

to which units of Maquar are allocated for defense).

Var the Golden: Not all is calm and peaceful in the Land of

Wheat. Three major factionsthe nawabs (merchants), the hajwas

(landed nobles), and the janas (priests of the Adama)constantly

struggle with one another for power (see Government, below),

and each side of this unstable triangle backs up its claims with

private military forces. Although such gamesmanship has little

eect on the daily life of the common merchant or laborer, the

costs in coin, time, and manpower to keep all these troops in good

order saps the countrys prots.Butinmanywaysthemoneyis

115

Estagund and the Shining Lands

well spent, since the presence of these forces acts as a deterrent

to would-be invaders. Few enemies would casually arontVar,

knowing that the various factions could easily band together and

pool their forces to repel any threats from the outside.

Religion

The Adama pervades all facets of life in the Shining South, just

as mainstream religion does in many other parts of Faern.

The major dierence is that the Durpari people are extremely

tolerant of other religions, since their belief system accepts the

multitude of deities followed in other parts of the world, rather

than competing with them.

In the strictest sense, the Adama, also known as the One,

is the embodiment of the spirit found in all thingshumanoids,

animals, plants, rocks, and even the gods. Therefore, all creatures

and objects on Toril, including deities, are considered manifesta-

tions of the Adama. In principle, the Adama is so far-reaching

that worshiping any deity is eectively paying homage to it.

In practice, however, not every deity is acceptable. Some are

favored because they embody the core values of the Adama better

than others. In particular, Zionel (Gond), Curna (Oghma), Lucha

(Selne), Torm, and Waukeen represent the broadest aspects of

day-to-day life in the Shining Lands, and thus their followers are

welcomed above all others. Other deitiesspecicallythosethat

require human sacrice,andMask,whorepresentsthieveryare

rejected because the tenets of their faiths are at cross-purposes

with those of the Adama. This seeming contradiction does not

bother the inhabitants of the Shining Lands. The opposite of a

cherished principle might be a philosophical necessity, but that

doesnt make it appealing.

Following the Adama is more a matter of everyday bearing

and conduct than ceremony and ritual. The Durpari believe that

the Adama exists in all things they do, and if their dealings with

others are fair and just, then they honor the Adama. The laws

that govern the people are based on the Adamas tenets, which

for all practical purposes are the same as the principles espoused

by the ve Faernian deities who best exemplify it.

Adventurers

For the most part, adventurers are treated the same as any other

visitors to the Shining Landsneither sought after nor scorned.

While sellswords and wandering wizards have ample opportunity

to explore the edges of civilization and unearth treasures from

the ruined remains of the past, the Durpari do not want such

activities to interrupt the owofbusiness.Thus,adventurerswho

get in the way of commerce (or worse yet, violate the laws of the

Adama through their actions) are dealt with just as quickly and

harshly as any local citizen might be.

This general ambivalence toward adventurers does not, however,

mean that the folk of Estagund, Durpar, and Var the Golden have no

use for them. On the contrary, Durpari merchants are quite happy to

conduct business with any newcomers who have coins burning holes

in their pockets and need specializedand expensiveequipment.

Likewise, they are quite willing to bargain with adventurers who

return victorious from distant places with wondrousand often

magictreasures to exchange. Beyond the opportunity for prot,

though, the citizens of the Shining Lands recognize the need for

brave outsiders who can rid their lands of foul beasts that would oth-

erwise prey on their cities, disrupting both lives and livelihoods.

Veldorn is the obvious exception to this attitude, since the beast-

chieftains of that land hold adventurers in the lowest regard. As far

as these monster lords are concerned, anyone who comes storming

into their territories spoiling for a ght is fair game for a little

retributive amusement, and monster-hunting heroes automatically

go to the top of that list. Few who strike out to tame wild Veldorn

realize just how united the beast-chieftains are when it comes to

repelling invaders, and fewer still return to warn others of their

unusual level of organization. Occasionally, the foul creatures of

Veldorn do more than send the would-be heroes packingthey also

mount a counterattack, usually along a trade way, to reinforce the

concept that they are not to be tried with.

Politics and Power

The Golden Rule (He who has the gold makes the rules) ap-

plies in the Shining Lands perhaps better than anywhere else in

Faern. Wealth might well be the driving factor in the politics

and power structure of most other nations, but nowhere else is

that fact so openly embraced.

The nations of the Shining Lands look at politics in slightly

dierent ways, as described below.

Durpar: The people of this nation so completely buy into

the idea that wealth is synonymous with power that they have

established a government based solely on auence,withthelead-

ers of the richest chakas forming the nations ruling body. This

system is not nearly as corrupt as it might appear. Although it

behooves every chaka to amass as much wealth as possible to earn

a seat on the council, doing so at the expense of solid business

practices inevitably backres.Achakathatproducesshoddygoods

and overcharges for them might gain a seat for one season, but

such tactics would soon become known, and the oendingchaka

could well crumble from the ensuing nes and lost business.

The citizens of Durpar are shrewd, and they understand that

shopping is more than just procuring goodsits also a means

of voting for council members. No chaka on the High Council

can remain there long by engaging in shady contracting practices,

either. Contracting ones own chaka to perform street cleaning

or some other public function wont work unless the chaka has

the means of getting the job done right. The people of Durpar

wont stand for any aront to the Adama, so the members of

the High Council must act in the public interest.

Despite the inherent checks and balances on the system, the

politics of Durpar are not entirely nonpartisan. On the contrary,

the various nawabs constantly plot and scheme with one another

to incorporate favorable trading conditions for themselves and

their allies into the laws and contracts. Perhaps the most

recentand possibly the most stunningdisplay of politics in

Durpar was the High Councils recent decision to relocate the

capital from Heldapan to Vaelan, a move that most Vaelenor

consider a true feather in the citys cap, though the citizens of

Heldapan still scowl about it when the issue is brought up.

Estagund: Since Estagund is a hereditary monarchy, its power

structure isnt quite the same as Durpars, but the result is similar

116

Estagund and the Shining Lands

because the Rajah of Estagund draws his power from wealth.

Not only is he the wealthiest individual in Estagund, but he is

also the kingdoms war leader and the supreme commander of

the Maquar. The heads of the various wealthy chakas do wield

considerable inuenceingovernment,buttheyactasanadvisory

council at best; the Rajah functions as a true monarch.

Var the Golden: Also a monarchy, Var is ruled by Supreme

Potentate Anwir Duprestiskava. Just below him, three powerful

factionsthe hajwas, the nawabs, and the janas, constantly vie with

one another for supremacy. Each faction is powerful enough in its

own right to unseat the ruler if it could focus on that goal, but

Anwir avoids that outcome by playing one against the others in

an endless political game. If not for this incessant power struggle,

life in Var would be a lot more like that in its neighbor states.

The hajwas, or landed nobles, have the most wealth in the

form of property and trading investments. The nawabs, leaders

of the various chakas, argue constantly with the hajwas for a

greater percentage of the prots because they make the deals

and do all the work of shipping the goods to market. The janas,

or priests, want to see the wealth reallocated for the glory of the

Adama and spent as they see t. After all, without their divine

guidance, there would be no wealth to enjoyor so they claim.

Veldorn: In the Land of Monsters, the power structure is

simple: The beasts rule as much territory as they can, and all who

oppose them are brutally eliminated. No love is lost between the

rulers of Veldorns various city-states, either. If greater threats

from beyond their borders did not occupy much of their attention,

the monsters that control this region would tear one another

apart. But because a few of them have the foresight to understand

the fate that awaits them all without cooperation, they have

forged a loose alliance in which each watches the others backs.

So far, this system has worked, and the beast-leaders otherwise

leave each other alone to conduct their aairs.

History of the Shining South

The region around the Golden Water began as a fertile land well

suited to the nomadic lifestyle of the many human tribes that

roamed its coasts. Over time, these tribes tired of skirmishing with

one another and sueringthedepredationsofother,greaternations,

so they settled into more permanent communities, where trading

became a prominent occupation. Today, the inhabitants of these

nations are considered some of the best hagglers in the world.

Year of the Portentous Waters: Durpar makes its rst

attempt to reopen the trade route with Mulhorand by

Old Vaelen or Vaelan?

Over the centuries, merchants and explorers from the

Heartlands have visited the Shining South and returned

with numerous maps of the region. Unfortunately, few could

agree on both the location and the spelling of the city known

as Vaelan. Some claimed that they had visited a bustling,

fortied trading port by that name on the western coast of

the Golden Water, which was under Durpars banner. Others

insisted that Vaelen was actually a monster-lled ruin far

inland from the bay, nestled near a natural spring in some

hills about a half-days ride from a great river. Only recently

was this confusion resolved, when a scribe named Loducius

the Laughing returned from the shining Lands to Waterdeep

with an explanation.

In the early days of the Shining Lands, the Veldorn tribe

gathered yearly in some low hills, where a spring bubbled forth

and trickled away toward the Liontongue River. Eventually, when

these tribesfolk settled down to engage in trade, they founded the

community of Vaelen at their old gathering site. In later years,

when rival tribes began to attack their caravans, the Veldorn

built a fortiedtradingportonthecoastoftheGoldenWater

and named it Vaelantar, which meant Little Vaelen in Durpari.

The caravans could store their goods there until ships arrived to

pick them up.

When monsters began pouring forth from the Curna Moun-

tains in the second century DR, Vaelantar fell to beholders and

was lost to Veldorn. A century later, the capital of Veldorn

also fell, this time to werecreatures. Then Mulhorand, tired of

having its caravans harassed by the werecreatures of Vaelen,

sent an army that reduced the former capital of Veldorn to

rubble in 1046. A half century after that, Durpar reclaimed

Vaelantar for the human population by nallydrivingoutthe

monsters, sending them north and west. The nawabs of the

High Council, recognizing the advantage of controlling more

ports on the bay, claimed the territory between the Golden

Water and the Curna range as part of Durpar and began to

resettle the old communities. Somewhere along the way, the

name Vaelantar was shortened to Vaelan, and the original

capital became known as Old Vaelen.

Government

The formal power structures of the nations known as the Shining

Lands dier more than any other shared feature. Though to all

outward appearances the almighty coin is king in Durpar, Esta-

gund, and Var, the truth is a little dierent.Infact,eachkingdom

approaches government from a slightly dierent perspective.

Durpar: Compared with the citizens of other countries along

the southeastern coast of Faern, the people of Durpar live almost

autonomous lives. Though the citizens consider adherence to the

Adama to be of paramount importance for maintaining peace,

harmony, and a sense of accomplishment on both a personal

and a national level, the people of Durpar are generally free to

conduct their business and personal aairs as they see t.

The nawabs of the eleven richest chakas in the country form

the High Council of Durpar, the ruling body of the nation.

Seats on the council are lledannually,accordingtothechakas

reported assets, and the leader of the wealthiest one becomes

the Grand Nawab of Durpar. The current grand nawab is Kara

Jeratma (LG female human aristocrat 4/illusionist 10), who is

not only the wealthiest member of the High Council but also

one of the wealthiest individuals in Faern.

The people of Durpar accept the High Councils authority

because they believe that its members act in the best interests

of the country. The logic behind this assumption is purely

mercantile: The council members have already proven their

business acumen by accumulating the vast fortunes necessary

to gain their council seats in the rst place. Predictably, their

decisions tend to benettheirownchakas,butfromabusiness

viewpoint, whats good for them is likely to be good for the rest

of the chakas as well.

In theory, the nawabs are empowered to make only the decisions

that are necessary to keep the kingdoms infrastructure operational

and its economy running smoothly. For example, they can collect

a modest tax on every sales transaction to fund public works. With

these funds, the High Council contracts various chakas to protect

the population from invasion, keep the streets clean, maintain the

public buildings, keep the peace, and so forth. In reality, the eleven

wealthiest people in Durpar have quite a bit of political pull, so

they can inuencemanyotherchakasbehindthescenes.Recently,

several of the nawabs on the High Council managed to swing a

vote to move the capital from Heldapan, its traditional location,

to the newer city of Vaelan. The nawabs who voted in favor of this

change all maintain their chakas along the old Veldorni region

of the Golden Water, and a new inux of wealth from mines in

that area enabled them to earn enough seats on the High Council

to pass the measure. Thus, those chakas stand to gain improved

trading conditions and can reward their own favored chakas with

juicy contracts for public service.

In the same way that the High Council manages the aairs

of the entire country, individual councilseach with eleven

nawabscontrol the operations of the individual communities

where they are based. The only requirement for earning a seat

on such a community council is that the chakas headquarters be

inside that citys boundaries. Only rarely do nawabs of the High

Council also sit on community councils. Though they are certainly

eligible to do so by virtue of their wealth, they are usually far too

busy to manage multiple council positions. But when the High

Councils membership shuesbecauseofa suddenchangein

wealth status, the nawabs unseated from the High Council tend

to take a sudden interest in their local ones.

Estagund: In this kingdom, the rajah maintains control over

the country, but he relies heavily on the assistance of his advi-

sorslanded nobles who also happen to be the heads of Estagunds

wealthiest chakas. Though the power rests in the hands of a

hereditary monarch rather than a council of the wealthy, as in

Durpar, the royal family also controls the wealthiest chaka.

In 1026 DR, Jeradeem Seltarir, considered by many to be the

most uncanny trader in the history of the Durpari people, actu-

ally purchased the throne of Estagund from King Hedgita for

precious gems with a total value in excess of a million gold pieces.

Jeradeem promptly placed his second son, Numambi Seltarir,

on the throne as rajah. This new wealth allowed the formerly

impoverished Hedgita to become a landed noble and an advisor

in Numambis court, and the change allowed Estagund to dig

its way out of nancialsqualorandbecomearespectedtrading

power. The Seltarir family has ruled Estagund ever since, and

neither its power nor its wealth has waned. The current rajah,

Ekripet Seltarir (LG male human aristocrat 5), is a young but

energetic ruler who works hard to see his nation prosper.

The one true force that allows Ekripet to remain in power,

even when his decisions are unpopular with the nobility, is the

Maquar. A wise legacy from Numambi, who established the

organization in his earliest days as rajah, the Maquar is a cadre

of hand-picked soldiers ercelyloyaltothethrone.Thoughsome

units of the Maquar have been placed under the command of

various nobles to protect the countryside, they never move against

the throne, regardless of their commanders orders to the contrary.

The current leader of the Maquar, who answers directly to Rajah

Seltarir, is Indamu Podo (LG male human ghter8/Maquarcru-

sader 6), a dedicated soldier who has trained for the position since

childhood. Though Ekripet nominally commands the Maquar,

he considers Indamu a close friend and carefully considers his

advice in all military matters.

119

Estagund and the Shining Lands

The nobles are sometimes referred to as hajwas, though that

title is formally used only in Var. Many are longtime landhold-

ers (descendants of the original nomadic tribes that rstsettled

the region) who have amassed their wealth from centuries of

farming. Others are the new richthe ospring of merchant

princes who used their protstopurchasebaronieswithinthelast

few generations. These two groups often ndthemselvesatodds

with one another, and the rajah must occasionally settle disputes

between rival nobles who like to look down their noses at one

another. When they are not arguing, the nobles manage their

holdings much as they see t,thoughtheyarestillconstrained

by the tenets of the Adama and by the good business practices it

requires. In a way, the common folk of Estagund exert a degree

of power over the nobles because, should a noble not provide the

safety, infrastructure, and incentives for trade (low taxes) that the

people expect, they can simply relocate to a barony that does.

Var the Golden: The government of this peninsular country is

by far the most convoluted and controversial in the three trading

nations. Supreme Potentate Anwir Duprestiskava is nominally the

head of state, but realistically, the three factions (the hajwas, the

nawabs, and the janas) that vie for inuencewiththerulerwield

almost as much power as he does. This unstable triangle spawns

constant maneuvering, inghting,andoutrightconictamongthe

factions, and the potentate typically plays the role of peacemaker.

The hajwas are traditional nobles, hereditary landowners who

have invested most of their wealth in their property and in busi-

ness. They want to continue to control the wealth of the nation

the old-fashioned way, with the common people working the land

for the nobles benet.Anylandednobleisautomaticallypartof

the hajwa faction should she choose to participate, but the owners

of the larger holdings have considerably more inuencewithin

the faction than those with smaller holdings.

If Estagund were a more agrarian country, the hajwas would

undoubtedly hold sway over the other two factions and have the

potentates ear. But since Vars economy has expanded beyond agri-

culture, the nawabs (merchants) have gained an equal footing in the

politics of the country. The nawabs have established a stranglehold

on Vars trade industry, including the export of grains and vegetables

from the nobles land. The merchants identify most closely with

Durpars business empire model and would like to see their own

nation mimic it. Any merchant headquartered in a Var port may

participate in the Nawab Council, as the faction is called. As in

Durpar, the eleven wealthiest merchants form its ruling body. All

other members may only discuss issues and advise their leaders.

While the other two factions bicker over the nature of business,

the janas strive to refocus the countrys ideals on a higher goal. The

janas, or priests of the Adama, are much more powerful here than

they are in the other kingdoms of the Shining Lands. The janas

established a foothold during Vars early days as a nation, when Rajah

Bheshti II, a devoutly religious ruler, lavishly donated to the temples

of the Adama. The rajah encouraged the priests to preach that the

pursuit of coin at the expense of mutual well-being was the basis for

the rift that divided old Gundavar into Estagund and Var. The janas

gained their greatest level of power during the Arkaiun occupation by

appealing to the common folk who toiled for the benetofothers.

Even after the withdrawal of the Arkaiun occupying force, the janas

remained on equal ground with the hajwas and nawabs.

Wedged in among these three factions is the Supreme Potentate

of Var, a hereditary ruler who must constantly perform a subtle

balancing act to stay in power and keep the country running.

The leaders of the three factions established the monarchy as a

means of ending the Golden Wara battle for control in the

power vacuum left behind by the withdrawal of the conquering

Arkaiuns of Dambrath. Realizing that no faction would support

a leader from either of the other two, all three wisely agreed to

bring in an outsider to become titular ruler. Though the monarchy

is hereditary, no potentate with ties to any of the three factions

may take the throne. Thus, the title does not always pass from

parent to child, though as far as anyone other than the potentate

knows, it has always remained within the same family.

Few people realize that the current Supreme Potentate of Var,

Anwir Duprestiskava by name, is actually an ancient blue dragon

playing at being human. Though he is a powerful creature in his

own right, he is coming to understand (after nearly two hundred

years on the throne) that the forces of public opinion and the wealth

of the populace can be much stronger inuencesonthecourseof

events than a single beingeven a dragon. On occasion, Anwir

has been forced to eliminatesometimes very unsubtlyhis most

outspoken opponents. Now and then, he orders the assassination of

a particularly charismatic gurewithnostrongtiestohim,oreven

one of his allies, simply because the individual could unbalance the

trio of factions that he manages to keep at odds with one another.

Such heavy-handed tactics work only because on the surface, it is

not always clear that the outcomes favor him, but many suspect

he has had a hand in them nonetheless.

Veldorn: The Land of Monsters is hardly a nation at all,

though it began its existence as the fourth trading power of

the Golden Water region. Indeed, its borders no longer resemble

those of the former human kingdom; they have migrated north

and west because of Veldorns continuous conictwithDurpar,

Estagund, and Var.

Each center of civilization in Veldorn is an independent city-

state ruled by some fell creature or group of creatures. All that has

kept these beasts from falling to the armies that march against

them from time to time is the alliance they have established with

one another for mutual protection.

But the Land of Monsters isnt made up only of horrible

creatures out of nightmare. The general populace of each center of

civilization (to use the term loosely) is usually composed of more

common sorts of folk. Plenty of humans still live in Veldorn,

though many of them are indentured laborers, slaves, or outlaws

who have edotherrealms.Numeroushumanoidswhondthe

rulership of beholders, dragons, werecreatures, and vampires to

their liking also dwell there. The beast-chieftains (as the residents

of nearby countries have named the monster leaders) rule with

an iron st,runningtotalitarianstateswheremightmakesright

and the economy is based on raiding caravans and communities

on the fringes of other civilizations.

In Veldorn, the traditional power structure has been turned

upside down. The criminal elementssuch as the thieves guilds,

evil arcane conclaves, and groups that might become fringe so-

cieties in other citiesare in charge, and the righteous defenders

of the downtrodden have been forced underground to ghtfor

freedom in secret.

120

Estagund and the Shining Lands

Enemies

For the most part, the trading nations of the Shining Lands

have no enemies. Only those who oppose honest trade, such as

thieves, can expect to incur the wrath of the governments in

these countries. But Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden all

oppose the monsters of Veldorn, which wreak havoc on any trade

that owsnorthwesttowardMulhorand.Thoughafewmilitary

clashes have occurred between countries in the Shining Lands,

most of the conictoccursinthemarketplace,wherecompetition

for the sale of goods can be erce.

For its part, Mulhorand instigates hostilities almost as often as

it welcomes the trade goods that the Shining Lands send its way,

primarily because of quarrels over tax and coin exchange rates.

In addition, the peace that has existed for some time between

Durpar and Ulgarth is a guarded one, for those two nations

have a history of conict that many citizens cannot forget. But

both Ulgarth and Mulhorand recognize the greater benet of

trade over war, and their leaders work to keep relations with the

Shining Lands favorable. Only Dambrath could be considered a

true enemy of the Shining Lands. Its leadersboth the Arkaiun

tribes of long ago and the Crinti of modern timeshave a history

of invading the three trading nations.

Cities and Sites

The vast majority of Shining Lands communities hover around

the bay known as the Golden Water. Originally established as

trading sites for the tribes that roamed the shores of the bay, these

settlements slowly grew into centers of civilization where nomads

could turn to sedentary pursuits in exchange for safety.

Trade always has been the foremost function of these com-

munities, and most of that trade is conducted by sea. Thus, every

city of note has both a large, permanent marketplace and a good

harbor with sucientcapacityforoceangoingshipstodock.Even

the few cities that lie inland from the water were founded on the

banks of rivers large enough to support shipping vessels.

Assur (Large Town)

Founded as a small trading community to serve the Durpari tribes

that roamed the western shores of the Golden Water, Assur was

originally part of the kingdom of Veldorn. But in the Year of the

Prowling Naga (142 DR), several clans of beholders swept down

out of the Curna Mountains from the region known to the barbar-

ians as the Beastlands and overwhelmed the city in a matter of

hours. Any who resisted were slain; the rest were enslaved. In the

course of a day, the beholders had rmlyentrenchedthemselves

as the undisputed totalitarian rulers of the town.

Humans were unable to drive their monstrous overlords out

of Assur until the Year of the Chaste Maiden (1102 DR), when

they nally sent the beholders eeing toward the safety of the

plains to the northwest. After its reclamation by humans, Assur

existed rstasanindependentcity-stateandmorerecentlyasa

part of Durpar. Little evidence of the time of the eye tyrants

remains, and today the community is as vibrant and prosperous

as most other trading centers around the bay.

With a population slightly in excess of 3,200, Assur sports

a sizable marketplace, which sits very near its deepwater harbor.

Many of the natives make their livings shing; others harvest

pearls and coralthough unusually intense shark activity in the

nearby waters has made these trades hazardous in recent years.

The First Nawab of the Assur Council, Turmli Valshu (LN

male human aristocrat 7) of the Valshu Chaka, specializes in

textile imports. He currently seeks a group of adventurers to

find and return his wayward daughter to him. She recently

ran off with several Sharess-loving acquaintances who enticed

her to wander the wider world and partake of its pleasures

with them.

Chavyondat (Metropolis)

The capital of Estagund, Chavyondat is the largest city in the

Shining Lands that is not actually on the coast of the Golden

Water. Originally known as Klionna, the city was founded by its

namesake tribe in 862 DR. In the Year of the Tempest (1027

DR), Rajah Numambi Seltarir renamed the capital in honor of

his rstborn daughter.

Chavyondat has been raided numerous times by both land and

seamost often by Dambrathans (both the Arkaiuns of the fth

and sixth century DR, and the Crinti of more recent times). The

city was the rst to fall when Reinhar I of Dambrath launched

a full invasion of Estagund in the Year of the Barren Chamber

(551 DR).

Chavyondat (Metropolis): Conventional; AL LG; 100,000 gp

limit; Assets 337,445,000 gp; Population 67,489; Mixed (human 82%,

haling 7%, half-elf 4%, dwarf 3%, gnome 2%, half-orc 2%).

Authority Figures: Rajah Ekripet Seltarir (LG male human

aristocrat 5), ruler of Estagund and head of Chaka Seltarir, the

wealthiest chaka in the country.

Important Characters: Indamu Podo (LG male human ghter

8/Maquar crusader 6), the leader of the Maquar; Mulad Shaulim

(LG human male cleric 5 of Waukeen/hand of the Adama 7),

High Priest of the Temple of the Adama; Venz Krulmir (wizard

7/Red Wizard 4), head of the Thayan Enclave.

Market and Docks

The marketplace in the citys old district, near the docks, consists

of rows and rows of permanent, roofed stalls. The Chavyondat

Commerce Authoritythe governing oce that manages

trade, the docks, and the public worksrents these structures

to merchants by the day, the tenday, or the month. Because of

its distance from most other communities of the Shining Lands,

merchant ships from western lands that dock at Chavyondat

dont have to sail as far to sell their wares or acquire new cargo.

Thus, Chavyondat gets a slightly better trade value for both

imports and exports.

Five of the rajahs warships patrol and protect the harbor and

the Bay of Kings from invasions, pirates, and sea monsters. Also

based here are another twelve warships owned and operated by

major chakas, including six that belong to Chaka Seltarir. The

chakas use their ships both to defend the city and to escort their

merchant ships through troubled waters.

121

Estagund and the Shining Lands

House of the Vanquisher

This structure, just a little west and downhill from Seltarir Palace,

serves as the traditional home and training center for the Maquar.

At present, more than two thousand Maquar warriors live here,

and three times that many are scattered among various other

cities, where they serve the nobles. During a military crisis, the

Maquar can either form into elite units or assume command of

militia formed from the ranks of the countrys population.

House of Chakas

All the business behind the business is handled in this building.

The Commerce Authority, which answers directly to the rajah,

regular basis to discuss business practices, set loan rates, address

Major Temples

The largest temple in Chavyondat, located near the center of

town, is dedicated to the Adama. Mulad Shaulim (LG human

male cleric 5 of Waukeen/hand of the Adama 7) presides over

the faithful, conducting services daily at dawn and dusk.

On the west edge of town, the halingshavededicatedasmall

shrine to Cyrrollalee in their sizable community.

Notable Businesses

Anything and everything is available for sale in the market of

Chavyondat, but one notable shopping area is separate from the

market. The Thayan Enclave, established three years ago, is a

walled manor house in the wealthy district of town from which

the Red Wizards sell all sorts of imported goodsparticularly

spell components. Their specialty is discounted magic items, and

their prices are lower than those of most other merchants in the

city (consistently 10% lower than the prices given in Chapter 7

of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Seltarir Palace

The rajahs palace sits on the highest ridge along the eastern end of

Chavyondat, overlooking the whole community and the bay below.

The palace was built more than three hundred years ago out of

white limestone and highlighted with salmon-colored coral details.

Constructed on the site of the watchtower that protected the city

when it was no more than a trading camp, the palace has been

expanded three times since it was built. It houses the rajahs extended

family and is defended by a host of three hundred Maquar.

Old Vaelen (Large Town)

This ruined city once served as the capital of Veldorn, but many

tragic events have befallen it since. The community was founded in

1234 DR, on the site of a natural spring amid a cluster of hills. In

Estagund and the Shining Lands

the Year of the Dun Dragon (245 DR), an army of werecreatures

led by a wererat prince swarmed up out of the hidden places in the

city and wrested control of it from the human population. Since

that time, the place has been known as a haven for werecreatures

of any sort, as well as a dangerous thorn in the side of every

caravan that tries to cross the open plains from the Golden Water

to reach Mulhorand and more distant points.

Tired of taking so many losses on the caravan route, Mul-

horand marched an army on Old Vaelen and destroyed it in the

Year of the Twilight Campaign (1046 DR). Although the city had

been reduced to rubble, a signicantnumberofthewerecreatures

survivedmostly by hiding underground, where the Mulhorandi

feared to go. Two years later, a newly transformed vampire named

Saed, who had been a nawab on the Turelve Council, edtoOld

Vaelen and quickly established a following. Soon enough, the

majority of the creatures inhabiting Old Vaelen recognized him

as the lord of the city. A year after taking control, Saed somehow

managed to convince the other beast-chieftains to unite against

their common foes by forming a mutual protection pact. With

such an agreement in place, the werecreatures serving under Saed

were free to raid caravans with impunity once more.

Today, Old Vaelen appears to be nothing but grassy knolls

with a scattering of stone rubble. Beneath those hills, however,

lies a huge complex that serves as a lair for a sizable population

of wererats, wereboars, werewolves, and other lycanthropes, as

well as a number of undead servitors. In all, more than 2,000

creatures dwell in the former capital of Veldorn.

Ormp (Large Town)

Like Assur and Vaelan, Ormp started out as a small shing vil-

lage and eventually grew into a sizable trading community before

beholder princes seized control of it in the second century DR. But

though the beholders held the other two cities for centuries, they did

not last long in Ormp. In the Year of the Wolfstone (153 DR), a

horde of demons led by a particularly nasty ghour attacked the city,

driving the eye tyrants out and assuming control of their human

slaves. The ghour and its minions maintained a reign of terror in

Ormp for the next 950 years, until Durpar, Estagund, and Var

managed to uproot them through a combined eort.Manyhumans

and demons were slain in the ghting,buttheghourmanagedto

escape, eeingtowardtheGiantsBeltMountainswhere,according

to rumor, he took up with the native hill giants.

Today, Ormp is a rustic mining community with approxi-

mately 4,500 residents. Several chakas have built their fortunes

here through the sale of beautiful gemstones and jewelry. The

Gemstone Chaka, a dwarf merchant house, recently roared to the

forefront of Durpari politics when its discovery of a rich lode

of emeralds catapulted its leader, Krakus Stoutgut (LN male

gold dwarf aristocrat 2/expert 9), into the High Council. With

Nawab Stoutguts help, the High Council successfully relocated the

capital of Durpar to Vaelan, a move that brought the Gemstone

Chaka certain tax benetsandcheapershippingprices(dueto

an agreement with the nawab from Vaelan, oeredinexchange

for the Gemstone Chakas vote).

The inuxofbothwealthandpeopleseekingithascausedthe

population of Ormp to grow rapidlyfar faster, in fact, than the

Ormp Council had anticipated. As a result, the city has a rather

large slum section where those with little money and few prospects

for work congregate, waiting for a break. Part of the problem is

that the Gemstone Chaka prefers to employ only dwarf miners

for the digging and gnome gemcutters for preparing the emeralds,

leaving the desperate humans unemployed. If something isnt done

about the squalor soon, the situation could quickly turn ugly.

Pyratar (Metropolis)

The capital city of Var the Golden, Pyratar (population 44,389)

is one of the largest cities on the Golden Watersecond in size

only to Heldapan. Besides serving as the center of government for

Supreme Potentate Anwir and the three power factions of Var,

Pyratar is also its most cosmopolitan city, thanks to the various

outside inuencesthathavegainedastrongerfootholdherethan

elsewhere. The drift from the tenets of the Adama represented by

these outside factions runs deeper than most folk realize. A sect of

Mask-worshiping thieves has established a lucrative operation in the

bowels of the city, headed by Fourth Nawab Kelsipal Turamir (LE

male human rogue 5/cleric 11 of Mask) of the Pyratar Council.

Vaelan (Metropolis)

Like Assur and Ompr, Vaelan once fell to the monsters of the

Curna Mountains but was eventually reclaimed. In the earliest

days of Veldorn, it was simply a fortied caravan stop called

Vaelantara waystation set up to protect goods until the ships

that would carry them to distant ports arrived. Gradually folk

who catered to traders began to set up businesses there, and soon

enough it became a thriving little market community. While the

beholders held the town, they actually built it up considerably,

turning it into a veritable armed fortress lled with magical

defenses. After a hard-fought and bloody battle, the trading

nations reclaimed the city, and the portions of it that were still

standing when the dust cleared were quite impressive.

In the two and a half centuries since Vaelan was freed, it has

been transformed into a thriving port and marketplace that rivals

the other major trading centers in the region.

Heroes and Monsters

Characters from the Shining Lands are most often humans or half-

elves, though a few might be halingswhoseancestorsmigrated

from Luiren or dwarves from the Curna Mountains. Among the

humans of the region, the vast majority are Durpari, though some

are Mulan or Arkaiun. In addition, various kinds of monster

characters hailing from Veldorn might have decided to leave the

oppression of that region behind for a life of adventuring.

Among the prestige classes detailed in Chapter 2, the Maquar

crusader, the hand of the Adama, and the Great Sea corsair are

all common to the Shining Lands.

A wide variety of monsters can be found in the lands around the

Golden Water, especially in Veldorn. Among those new creatures

detailed in Chapter 5, the dark tree, cyclops, and mantimera are

indigenous to the region. Other monsters native to Veldorn include

beholders, werecreatures, leucrotta, demons, and various giants.

123

I n a region ringed by mountains lies Halruaa, a nation

of reclusive wizards. This rich realm is famous for its

gold mines, its ery Haerlu wine, and most of all, its

magic. Halruaans wizards, like their mighty Netherese ancestors,

crave powerful magic and pursue their craft with fanatical devo-

tion, and even Halruaans who do not practice the Art respect its

inescapable power and inuence.

Geographic Overview

Halruaa is almost completely encircled by the Walls of Halruaa,

a series of mountain ranges that form the eastern, northern, and

western borders of the country. The coastline of the Great Sea

forms its southern boundary. Halruaa stretches approximately

500 miles from east to west, and more than 350 miles from the

coast to the northern foothills. The vast majority of the country

consists of at,windsweptplains,brokenonlybybroad,sluggish

rivers and the occasional unusual feature.

For the most part, Halruaa is a warm, humid land, with tem-

peratures ranging from more than 100 degrees in the summer to

between 80 and 90 degrees in the winter. The mountains trap the

moisture that rolls in othesea,producingsuddenandfrequent

thunderstorms. The higher foothills and valleys of the Walls of

Halruaa are cooler and more comfortable than the lowlands in

the middle, and the mountains are even colder, with permanent

snowcaps on the highest peaks. Winter often brings snow to the

temples on the mountain slopes as well, though never to the inland

plains. The winds blowing o the mountains make life inland

more bearable, though the weather patterns produced when they

meet over Lake Halruaa make the lake a tricky place to sail.

Major Geographic

Features

The nation of Halruaa is perhaps the single most isolated

country in Faern, with the possible exception of some island

kingdoms. Great mountains tower over the central plains, their

snowcapped peaks tantalizingly out of reach of those who live

in this hot, windswept land. High, narrow passes through these

severe mountains provide some measure of contact with the

rest of the world, as does shipping from the Great Sea to the

south. For the most part, however, the wizards of Halruaa live

in comfortable dissociation from those around them.

The Akhlaur Swamp

This 4,000-square-mile swamp to the west of Lake Halruaa

is a warren of dangerous creatures and long-forgotten magic.

Named after an ambitious necromancer who set up his hidden

and magically defended fortress-home at its center, the Akhlaur

wasnt always the size it is today. When the necromancer rst

went into seclusion, the swamp that ankedtheRiverGhalagar

covered only half the territory it does now. Until recently, the

lowlands around the swamp continued to oodataslowbutsteady

pace, expanding the swamps boundaries by perhaps 100 feet a

year, though the river drained o more than enough water to

maintain equilibrium.

Most Halruaans knew that the swamp was oodingbecause

of a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water, but few know the

whole truth. Akhlaur was an ambitious wizard who focused his

attention on researching interplanar connections. When one of

his experiments with a connection to the Elemental Plane of

Water went awry, the magic he had set in motion went out of

control. Magically charged water began to pour through a never-

closed portal from that plane, oodingAkhlaurslaboratoriesand

overowingintotheswamp.Theportal pumped more water into

The Akhlaur Swamp is home to many undead creatures

the swamp than the river could drain eectively. Had it kept

expanding, Akhlaur Swamp would eventually have reached the

coast, swallowing Halagard in the process. Recently, however, a

wild elf magehound named Kiva moved the portal to the Nath

by means of a magic device similar to a portable hole, stopping

the expansion of the swamp. Later, a sorceress named Tzigone

closed it during a battle between the Halruaan wizards and some

Mulhorandi invaders. Just before it sealed, Kiva managed to bring

Akhlaur back through from the other side.

Today, the swamp remains at the size it was when the portal

was moved, but many concerns remainthe most important of

which, at least to those who know the swamp well, is the presence

of the larakens. These bizarre creatures from a distant plane began

to appear at about the same time that the oodingbegan.Few

know for sure whether they originated from the Elemental Plane

of Water or were simply pulled through from another plane at

about the time the portal was opened. Whatever their origin, the

larakens present a deadly danger to wizards everywhere because

of their magic-draining abilities.

The larakens are not the only dangerous creatures dwelling

in Akhlaur Swamp. Snakes, crocodiles, and schools of piranhas

hide in the shallow areas, and numerous undeadsome the

results of Akhlaurs strange experiments and others spawned

from doomed expeditionslurk everywhere in the interior of

the swamp. Despite these threats, wizards and adventurers often

enter the swamp in search of Akhlaurs fabled magic treasures.

The Bandit Wastes

In the shadow of Halruaas North Wall lie the desolate barrens

known as the Bandit Wastes. The rough, rocky terrain of this

region consists of jagged hills and dusty plains, punctuated by

draws, ravines, and dry streambeds. This hot and desolate place

boasts very little vegetation, water, or shade. Few stay in the

region for long unless they must, and those who do stay rarely

survive long.

In addition to a wide variety of monsters, this region has

traditionally served as home to outlaws eeing the reach of

Halruaan, Lapaliiyan, or Shaaryan justice. At present, the worst

such group is the Blood Screamers, a band of savage gnome dire

weremoles led by a gnome vampire called the Blood-Curdling

Scream (CE male rock gnome vampire illusionist 9). This group

reportedly lairs in a warren of tunnels dug by giant ants in the

barrens east of Lapalgard, and its members raid as far aeld as

the Rathgaunt Hills and the Nath.

Lake Halruaa

This central body of brackish water connects the lands river ports

to the sea. Though strong and unpredictable winds blowing in o

the mountains make sailing and shinginthelaketrickyand

ying over it in a skyship even trickierLake Halruaa is the

central hub for the majority of trade and travel passing through

126

Halruaa

the country. Each of Halruaas major rivers ultimately feeds into

Lake Halruaa, and every ship that moves along one of these

waterways skirts the lake, hugging the shoreline to avoid the

worst of the choppy water and capricious winds before moving

into a new channel and completing its route. Because of this heavy

shipping trac,mostofthenationspopulationisconcentrated

in communities on or near the shores of the lake, including the

capital city of Halarahh.

Though few Halruaans care to venture out into the wild,

hazardous central portion of the lake, more than a few unusual

beasts call these waters home. Some of these creatures are likely

native to Lake Halruaa, while others migrated up the wide chan-

nel connecting it with the Great Sea to the south. Whatever the

case, sightings of such creatures are common enough that they

cause little stir among the populace. Once in a while, however,

an aquatic beast ventures close enough to shore to stir up some

excitement. When a real threat is discerned, the local wizards

waste little time chasing the interlopers back to the lakes central

depths. In the past year, a few unusually large sharks, octopi,

and dragon turtles have been spotted, and quite a few folk have

reported a winged beastpossibly a dragondiving into or

soaring out of the midst of the lake, usually at night.

The Nath

The Nath, an upland basin of gentle hills in the northeast corner

of Halruaa, is known for its herds of wild roth and auroch, both

of which are raised for food. Consid-

erably higher in altitude than

most of the rest

of the country, this area boasts a slightly more temperate climate.

Temperatures in the Nath rarely reach 100 degrees, and the rains,

though more frequent, are much gentler, nurturing the meadow

grasses upon which the herds graze.

Perhaps the most signicant features of the Nath Valley are

the temples situated on the lower slopes of the mountains that

surround the valley. Each of these temples focuses on one school

of arcane wizardry above the others. The sects are small because

while most in Halruaa profess at least a passing devotion to

Mystra or Azuth, few feel the need to cement their connections

to the divine through ceremony. The clerics and wizards who

tend the temples are the few who have been called to serve the

deities of magic in a more formal way.

Other than the temples, the valley holds little of signicance.

The Nath is a rugged, wild country compared to the rest of

Halruaa, and those who live here must be prepared for threats

from many directions, though by far the greatest threat comes

from the east. Crinti riders occasionally sneak through the Nath

Pass to harass the herders or raid the temples in the hills. Sizable

Crinti forces have invaded this area on more than one occasion,

but the powerful magic of the Halruaan aristocracy has always

forced them back before they could get much beyond the mouth of

the valley. Even so, the folk who by proximity serve as a rstline

of defense remain ever-watchful for the gray-skinned riders.

considerably in the atplains,oftenspreadingseveralmilesacross

as they meet the broad lake. At such points, the rivers owcalmly

and shallowly, appearing more like channels or inlets of the lake

than rivers in the strictest sense.

River Ghalagar, on the west side of the lake, is the only runo

from the West Wall that runs through the Akhlaur Swamp.

Because of the extraplanar water source that has until recently

fueled the Akhlaurs bizarre expansion, the lower Ghalagar is

rather swift. The Rivers Halar and Aluer, both of which drain

the North Wall, are the widest, most tracked waterways in

Halruaa. Countless villages and towns line the banks of these

two rivers, receiving their goods from the merchant ships and

barges that pass back and forth along their courses. To the east,

connecting Lake Halruaa to Lake Maeru, the River Maeru

ows down out of the East Wall. This waterway serves as the

main shipping avenue for the vast quantities of gold mined from

those mountains, and it too is lined with communities at regular

intervals.

Like the lake they feed, these watercourses occasionally sport

an unusual creature or two. For the most part, however, they

host nothing more dangerous than large schools of sh.

The Walls

Three mighty mountain ranges known as The Walls bound Hal-

ruaa on the west, north, and east, creating an isolated nation that

is most easily reached by sea. The Walls are breathtakingly high,

and each range boasts several peaks towering 20,000 feet or more

above sea level. Only vemajorpassesthoughthesemountains

connect Halruaa to the often hostile kingdoms beyond.

The mountains on the west side of the country are known

as Lhairghal, or the West Wall. This range spans more than

350 miles from its southern end, which borders the Great Sea,

northward to Talath Pass. The West Wall is split in two by the

Mhair Pass, which links Halruaa with the Mhair Jungles on the

other side. Where the West Wall meets the North Wall, in the

northwest corner of the nation, Talath Pass connects Halruaa

with Lapaliiya.

The northern range, including the mountains surrounding

the Nath, is called the North Wall, or Nathaghal. This stretch

of mountains and steep hills runs from Talath Pass on the west

to the Nath Pass on the east, spanning a distance of more than

600 miles. The North Wall is divided by the Bandit Pass, which

connects Halruaa with the Bandit Wastes to the north. The

Nath Pass in the northeastern section of the country provides a

corridor between Halruaa and Dambrath.

The East Wall is known as the Muaraghal. Like the West

Wall, it stretches more than 350 miles and, like both of the

other mountain ranges bordering Halruaa, it is split by a pass.

The Azhal Pass lies just south of the river Maeru and connects

Halruaa with the Great Swamp, Rethild. The Muaraghal is richly

veined with some of the purest gold deposits in Faern. Mining

in the hills and mountains of the East Wall is perhaps the second

most valuable industry in Halruaa, next to magic.

The mountains surrounding Halruaaparticularly those

that cradle the Nath Valleyare home to the countrys various

temples of magic. Mount Talath, in the western half of the North

Wall, houses the high temple to the deity Mystra and contains

one of the largest libraries and storehouses of magic in Faern

(see Mount Talath, below).

All told, the mountains are uncommonly threat-free, at least

on the Halruaan side, where long years of careful defense have

largely tamed them. The opposite slopes, however, are much wilder

and more dangerous. On the west side lurk nagas, yuan-ti, and

other threats from the Mhair Jungles, while a variety of mon-

stersincluding bestial gnomes and banditsroam the north side.

On the eastern side, Crinti raiders from the plains of Dambrath

and creatures from the Great Swamp, including lizardfolk and

mysterious serpent beings, plague the lower slopes. Furthermore,

ogres, tall mouthers, giants, perytons, and stray outsiders all call

the entire set of mountain ranges home. Most of these creatures,

however, know better than to tempt the wrath of the Halruaan

wizards, so they rarely brave the high and forbidding peaks to

reach the other side of the mountains.

People of Halruaa

Perhaps because they are descendants of the mighty Netherese

wizards, Halruaans have never lost their love of and fascination

with magic. It permeates their lives, aects every facet of their

existences, and provides a standard of living found nowhere else

in Faern. Though not all Halruaans have mastered the Art,

everyone feels comfortable around it. The nations wizards pursue

the Art with fanatical devotion and consider all other studies

to be inferior pursuits. Thankfully, the Halruaans have thus far

avoided the soul-blindness that doomed Netheril, and if they

remain vigilant against such hubris, they might enjoy the fruits

of their labors for many years to come.

Races and Cultures

Halruaa is predominantly (90%) a human nation, and Halru-

aan humans make up 80% of the human population. In the

countrys earliest days, the great valley formed by the three Walls

of Halruaa was sparsely populated by Lapal tribes that had ed

the jungles to the west. With the fall of Netheril, a group of

Netherese led by the great wizard Raumark moved southward,

arriving in magnicent skyships to nd a land that seemed like

paradise. Within a generation, they had begun to blend with

the natives. Not long after that, waves of Arkaiun tribespeople

who had come west from Dambrath intermingled with the early

Halruaans, creating the ethnic group that exists today.

Most modern Halruaans are dark-haireda trait shared

by both their Netherese and Lapal ancestors. Though the

fair-skinned Netherese originally dominated the population, the

darker, olive-colored skin tones of the Lapal tribes proved more

suitable for the sunny clime and became a dominant trait. Today,

the typical Halruaan has dark hair and skin in any shade from

ruddy to deep olive, though an occasional paler-skinned child is

born. Eye color ranges from black to chocolate brown to deep

green. Halruaan men average about 5 feet 9 inches tall, and

women about 3 inches shorter.

128

Halruaa

Halruaans speak Halruaan, which is simply a modern dialect

of ancient Netherese. They employ the Draconic alphabet in

their writings.

The remainder of the nations population consists primarily of

dwarves and halings.Mostofthedwarvesliveinthemountains

that form the eastern perimeter of the country, where they work

the gold mines. Some adventuresome strongheart halingtrad-

ers from Luiren have settled in trading communities near the

coast, while small populations of lightfoot halings have been

established in Halruaas urban centers for several generations.

A few elves and half-elves also call Halruaa home, though

they are rare enough to be considered oddities anywhere in the

interior of the country. For the most part, those with elf blood

who have made themselves at home in this nation of wizards

either have sucient aptitude to vie for the power that comes

with magic, or have chosen to serve as counselors to others who

do. A small handful of elves and half-elves make up one bloc of

the governing Council of Elders (see Government, below).

Life and Society

Most folk who have never been to Halruaa hold a couple of

mistaken assumptions. The rst is that all Halruaans are wiz-

ards. Though far from true, this assumption has doubtless been

fostered in the minds of foreigners by the few Halruaans with

whom they have had contact. In fact, only about one-third of all

Halruaans have the gift of wizardry; the other two-thirds just

act as though they do. The second bit of misinformation shared

by those not native to Halruaa is that all the countrys wizards

seclude themselves in dark, brooding towers built in desolate areas,

where they cackle gleefully while working on their latest magical

experiments. Again, though this notion is quite understandable,

it isnt accurate.

In truth, Halruaans live their lives in much the same way as

other people in Faern. They marry, have families, and live in

communities where they have friends and engage in trade and

gossip, just like other folk. The dierenceisthatmagicpervades

their lives on an everyday level, and they dont think twice about

its presence. In most of Faern, those who understand magic are

considered mysterious outcasts, but in Halruaa, they have the inside

track to health, wealth, and happiness, and those who dont have

the spark of magic feel as though theyre on the outside looking

in. Although it is not necessary to practice magic in order to live

well in Halruaa, it does helpa fact that might explain why so

many Halruaans at least pretend to know a bit of wizardry.

Of the third of the population with magical skill, ap-

proximately two-thirds have never been able to get beyond a

simple trick or two (as noted in the description of the Magical

Training feat; see page 36 of the Forgotten Realms Campaign

Setting). The resta little more than 10 percent of the total

populationactually understand the intricacies of casting spells.

To Halruaans, the true Art is wizardrythey view sorcery as

a dangerously undisciplined and primitive approach to magic.

Those few Halruaans whose gifts lead them to sorcery instead

of wizardry either downplay the extent of their powers or leave

the country.

With all that magic at their ngertips, its no wonder that

Halruaans practice exaggerated courtesies with one another. Hal-

ruaan social interactions usually involve lengthy declarations of

intent, ritual sharing of spell components, and other elaborate

niceties, usually as part of formal visits to one anothers homes.

Such practices might be considered an unnecessary waste of time

in a society that doesnt feel the weight of magic every day, but for

Halruaans, they represent self-preservation as much as politeness.

To the eyes of visiting outsiders, these courtesies initially seem to

be a whirlwind of gestures, bows, and ritualistic exchanges that

are too rapid and confusing to gure out. Eventually, though,

patterns become discernible, and visitors soon learn to follow

along and participate.

Halruaans as a whole are self-satisedpeoplemoreinterestedin

staying at home than in exploring or exploiting the rest of Toril.

Wizards enjoy pursuing their research in the privacy of their

laboratories and dont see much need to get beyond the Walls.

Those who do leave their native land are often merchants or

agents in search of unusual spell components. A few such agents

are important enough to travel in one of the fabled Halruaan

skyships, but these yingvesselsarefragileandsovaluablethat

they are not sent outside the Walls for anything less than major

missions.

While Halruaan wizards do spend a substantial amount of time

on their studies, they still manage to make time for family life,

though they rear smaller numbers of children on average than

citizens of other nations. As a result, children in this country

tend to get more individual attention. Halruaans receive public

schooling until at least the age of thirteen. Screening for magi-

cal aptitude occurs at age ve,andmagic-capablestudentsoften

master cantrips by the time they are fteen.

The smaller than normal number of ospring also means

that Halruaa is not a densely populated nation. In fact, it has

no large cities, and almost every urban center that does exist is

less crowded than one would expect. The streets are wide, stately

boulevards, the homes sit on spacious lots with plenty of open

grass, and public parks and squares are numerous and open.

Economy

To its citizens, Halruaa is truly a land of plenty. Much of its

countryside consists of open plains that are well watered by fre-

quent rains. Farming is a signicant part of the economy, and

because of the relatively sparse population, the farms around Lake

Maeru and north of Lake Halruaa can produce most of the food

the country needs. Fish abound in the wide rivers and along the

shores of the lakes, and fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy products,

and meat are daily fare on most tables throughout Halruaa.

The nations largest exports are gold and Haerlu wine. The gold

is mined out of the mountains on the eastern side of the nation,

and the wine is made in vineyards throughout the countryside.

Some of the gold is smelted directly into ingots and used as trade

bars, but a signicant amount is crafted into ne works of art,

either alone or alloyed with silver to form electrum. Gold and

electrum jewelry and Haerlu wine fetch nepricesallalongthe

southern coast of the Great Sea, and in nations such as Lapaliiya

and Chondath.

129

Halruaa

Halruaans could rival the Red Wizards in the export of magic

if they chose to do so, but oddly enough, spells and magic items do

not often make their way beyond the countrys borders. Halruaans

are decidedly possessive about their magical creations and do not

easily let them spread into the wider world beyond their borders.

As it is, more than a few folk in prominent positions scowl every

time they hear another tale of a skyship racing along somewhere

beyond the Walls.

Magic is perhaps rst on the list of Halruaas imports. The

appetites of the Halruaan wizards for new and unusual magic

from other lands knows no bounds, and their habit of taking

magic without giving any back doesnt seem to bother them

in the least. In addition to arcane imports, Halruaa is also a

viable market for precious metals and other rare and valuable

goodsparticularly those useful in the creation of magic, such

as spell components. In a nation with such a high quality of life,

the demand for exquisite jewelry and other neartisalwayshigh,

and ostentatious wizards prefer to craft their magic items out of

the best materials.

Law and Order

Perhaps the greatest dangers in living in a society so steeped in

magical ability are the threats of escalating magical combat and

the eectssuchbattlescouldhaveoninnocentbystanders.Because

Halruaans recognize the danger of the magic they wield, such

awesome and deadly displays are few and far between. Nonethe-

less, magic seems to hang in the air of every village and town,

and wizards of every persuasion magically check out anyone who

might appear to be a threat. Scrying is common, and divinations

of every sort are ung about on the streets of Halruaan com-

munities like trinkets at a parade. The result is that for the most

part, Halruaa is a self-policed nation.

When a problem does arise, justice is swift but carefully mea-

sured. The Halruaan magehounds, who are tasked with enforcing

the laws regarding magic, track down renegade practitioners and

bring them to justice. No trial is convened without thorough

wizardly research, and no case is ever presented without ponder-

ous magical proof to back it up. Once sucientproofhasbeen

oered that a person is guilty of a crime, punishment is not far

behindassuming that punishment is deemed appropriate. Intent

guressignicantlyintothejusticesystem,andanargumentof,

He pointed something at me that looked like a wand, so I slew

him, is an acceptable defenseprovided that the defendant really

thought her life was in danger.

All the magical power at everyones beck and call actually

serves to make Halruaa a peaceful nation, at least internally.

Few can expect to get away with crimes if people on every street

corner have the means to magically force a confession out of the

perpetrator.

Defense and Warcraft

A simple glance at a map reveals that Halruaa is geographically

well protected. The mountains that surround it on three sides

are high and forbidding, and they completely isolate the country

from all its neighbors.

The best means that Halruaans have found to ensure their

own safety is prevention. One good bit of intelligence goes a long

way toward avoiding military disasters, and divination is often

the best way to gain knowledge of the enemy. Over the centuries,

diviners have earned great prestige for their ability to forecast

impending dangerbe it monstrous threats, hazardous weather,

or invasions by hostile countriesand Halruaas military has

managed to turn back numerous attacks in recent decades simply

by knowing what was going to happen before it did.

Still, all the preparation in the world wouldnt do any good

without a strong military presence to back it up, and Halruaans

learned long ago that magic alone cannot make the dierence.

Though skyships can whisk soldiers, supplies, and support magic

from place to place quickly, the vessels are fragile enough that

the wizards rarely waste them in actual battle. Instead, skyships

are typically set down to unload troops, and more traditional

military tactics often decide the day.

The vemountainpassesarethebiggestweaknessesinthe

Halruaan armor, but those are easily defended. Though less for-

bidding than the high ridges that ankthem,thepassesarenot

easy routes for an advancing army, especially if a smaller force

is determinedly entrenched in its path. The few times that enemy

forces have managed to reach the interior of the country (a rare

event, thanks to timely divinations), the Halruaan military has

met them with a force that included a large percentage of light

cavalry to take advantage of the open ground. Historically, only

the Crinti just to the east have given as well as they have taken

in mounted combat.

The Halruaan navy can mount a strong force for defense

against invasion by sea. Several fast, maneuverable warships are

docked in every port city, and more patrol the nearby waters.

Since the majority of the population dwells in the interior

(around Lake Halruaa), any invading navy would have to sail

straight up the channel between the lake and the sea to mount an

invasion. Few armadas would be able to survive such a conned

route, particularly with the agile warships darting around them

and both banks of the river lined with wizards defending their

homeland. The only other viable option for invasion would be

to land on the outer shores of the country and unload troops,

which would then have to march overland. At that point, the

superior mobility of the Halruaan skyships would quickly gain

the defenders the upper hand.

But even in the face of such defenses, more than a few enemy

nations and hordes of monsters have attempted forays against the

nation of wizards, lured by the enticing rumors of magic to be

gained. The reality of Halruaas magic is a little less ashy than

the stories indicate, but the locals nevertheless put it to good use

in protecting their own.

Religion

Though religion has its place even in a society dominated by

arcane magic, it is not at the forefront of everyday life in Halruaa

the way it is in some locales. Nonetheless, almost all Halruaans

oer at least a token nod to the gods, knowing full well the

folly of turning their backs on the deities that granted them the

130

Halruaa

marvels of magic. To believe that they could get by without such

veneration would be the height of arrogance.

Most Halruaans worship either Mystra or Azuth. The vast

majority of the population pays homage to the Mother of All

Magic, praying to her to watch over the Weave and thus ensure

that the Halruaan way of life continues undisturbed. Every

community of village size or larger has, at the very least, a

shrine dedicated to Mystra, and an extravagant temple honors

her in every major town and city. While some of these temples

verge on ostentatious, they all pale in comparison with Mouth

Talath, the center of magic in Halruaa. High on the mountain

slopes along the north side of Halruaa is Mount Talath, the site

of the largest temple to Mystra in Faern. It houses not only

a grand worship center, but also one of the most complete and

coveted archive and library in Faernat least so far as magic

is concerned.

Not everyone in Halruaa chooses to venerate Mystraa siz-

able faction follows the teachings of the Lord of Spells. Indeed,

the rise of Azuths following during the earliest days after his

ascension to godhood took place largely in Halruaa, and his wor-

shipers here have constituted the nucleus of his church for more

than a millennium. Their collective voice has grown stronger in

the years since the Time of Troubles because more than a little

dissent grew among the ranks of the Mystra-worshipers during

that period, causing signicantnumbersofwizardsevenamong

the eldersto shift their patronage.

As if the rivalry between the two faiths did not create

enough strife, rumors have begun to surface that a new secret

cult dedicated to Shar has emerged in Halruaa. Such whispers

suggest that some Halruaansperhaps even a few eldershave

heeded the Mistress of the Nights call and turned to the Shadow

Weave. Although such tales might be exaggerated, they probably

do contain seeds of truth. While the members of the Council

of Elders traditionally have diculty nding common ground

on much of anything, those among them who have embraced

the Dark Goddess are almost certainly united in their own

dark causes.

No other faith has established much of a foothold in Halruaa

so far. The churches of Savras and Velsharoon are the most

prominent of the minor faiths, but both of these have been largely

absorbed into the Church of Azuth, and the populace works to

keep it that way. While priests of other deities might visit coastal

ports for short durations (perhaps in the service of traders or

as emissaries from another nation), they are not welcome to

venture deeper into Halruaa, nor are they permitted to spread

the tenets of their faith among the locals. Those who attempt to

do so quickly draw attention to themselves and are politely asked

to leave. Any who persist are magically discharged from Halruaa

to the other side of the nearest border, typically landing high in

the mountains or in the midst of the Great Sea.

Adventurers

Because Halruaans are fond of their isolation, few of them ap-

preciate outsiders traipsing around the countryside. The nation

does accept a small number of local adventurers who periodically

visit the more remote regionsparticularly the Walls of Halruaa,

Akhlaurs Swamp, the jungles of Mhair, and the Swagdar in

Dambrathin search of prot and adventure. But folk from

other lands who come to Halruaa to hunt treasure and slay

monsters are seldom welcome. Those few who manage to slip in

are not forcibly removed as long as they dont cause trouble and

do not try to spread the tenets of an unwelcome faith, but the

locals keep a suspicious eye on their activities.

Some career adventurers also ndalternatemeansofmaking

a living in Halruaa. Veteran combatants can usually nd work

with the military, while mages might be able to pay or trade

for training, especially if they bring knowledge and samples of

outside magic. Foreign thieves, however, are not tolerated. Like

rival priests, those who are caught plying the thiefs trade are

either asked to leave or magically evicted from the nation.

Politics and Power

Magic is the most venerated form of power in Halruaa, and

those who can wield it most eectively tend to wield political

power as well. Fortunately for the rest of the world, the wizards

of Halruaa seldom see eye to eye on any topic. Thus, Halruaas

power structure consists of numerous factions of wizards, all

working at cross-purposes in their quest for more magic.

Zalathorm, the present Wizard-King of Halruaa, is a diviner

whose ability to foretell the future has extinguished several threats

before they could become serious. In fact, Zalathorm and the

other diviners have been so successful in protecting the nation

that most citizens favor placing divination specialists in leadership

positions from now on, rather than entrusting the nations fate

to evokers, conjurers, and the other kinds of wizards who ruled

in the days when Halruaa had to defend itself actively.

History of Halruaa

The earliest people to settle the warm, rain-drenched plains of

Halruaa were Lapal tribes that had ed from their oppressive

yuan-ti masters in the jungles to the west. These sturdy folk settled

along the banks of the wide, gentle rivers and around the lake,

becoming farmers, sherfolk,andshepherds.Becausethethree

mountain chains around Halruaa formed a natural barrier against

the outside world, the tribes were left mostly in peace.

No others arrived in the valley until nearly 1,400 years

later, when a group of Netherese wizards led by the archmage

Raumark edthescourgeofthephaerimmsandthedestruction

of the empire of Netheril by skyship. Raumark had foreseen the

doom approaching his native land and begun planning such an

escape even before Karsuss fateful act and Mystryls death. Upon

crossing the mountains, the Netherese found a beautiful and rich

country, sparsely populated by Lapal shepherds and sherfolk,

and decided to adopt it as their new home.

The two ethnic groups embraced one another rather than

ghting over such a bountiful and available land, and they

quickly learned to coexist. The wizards provided the simple folk

of Halruaa with an organized ruling class, laws, justice, and

wondrous works. Native Lapalians with a talent for magic were

131

Halruaa

accepted as students with no hesitation, and the presence of so

many powerful wizards soon discouraged the raiders and monsters

that had once plagued the lowlands.

In the years after the arrival of the Netherese, Halruaa

grew and prospered as a nation of wizards in relative isolation.

But although its citizens have never shown much interest in

occurrences beyond the Walls of Halruaa, the converse has not

been trueHalruaas neighbors have made numerous attempts

at conquest despite the countrys fabled defenses. Envious of

Halruaas riches and magical treasures, the Dambrathans have

been the most frequent pests, invading Halruaa for brief periods

on several occasions.

In 585 DR, a eet of Dambrathan galleys attacked Halruaas

coasts and occupied the country south of Lake Halruaa for sev-

eral months, until the great Halruaan wizard-king known as

Mycontil defeated the invaders and slew their leader. The last

serious invasion occurred about one hundred years ago, when a

charismatic satrap of Lapaliiya led a great raid through Talath

Pass. The Halruaans drove o these invaders easily.

Halruaa

Government

Halruaas ruling body is the Council of Eldersa tumultuous

body of more than four hundred powerful wizards headed by the

netyarch, or wizard-king. Though all the elders are independent

thinkers with widely dieringopinions,theysomehowmanage

to work together well enough to govern the country eectively.

The leader of the council and current netyarch of Halruaa

is Zalathorm Kirkson (LN male human diviner 20/loremaster

4/Halruaan elder 5), who is rumored to be several centuries old.

His tower stands in the middle of the temple complex dedicated to

Mystra in Halarahh. The netyarchs palace is an ornate building

protected by a wide variety of magical guardians and defenses.

Zalathorm uses a special magic item known as the Crystal

Orb (see page 59) to call a meeting of the council. The Orb

allows him to contact all the elders at once with a single com-

mand, and those who respond remain in telepathic contact with

Zalathorm and the other respondents for as long as desired. The

use of this device means that the elders need not actually travel

to the palace to participate in a meeting, though most of them

have the magical wherewithal to do so easily. On most occasions,

fewer than half the elders respond to the telepathic summons,

since many of them are involved in arduous magical research

or other personal business when a meeting occurs. Unless the

issue at hand is of the direst nature, only one-tenth of the

council members need to vote to render a decision. When an

issue seems serious enough to warrant the participation of the

entire council, a special vote is called. If it passes, a magical

summons is sent out to every single elder, requesting that she

proceed with all due haste to the palace because important

business is afoot. When feasible, a waiting period is established

to allow every member a chance to arrive. Once the full council

is in session, however, those unable to attend must live with the

decisions of those present.

To become an elder, an individual must demonstrate a certain

minimal arcane aptitude and petition the council for entry. In

general, the wizards already on the council perform a background

check with a few perfunctory divination spells to ensure that

the potential member isnt going to create a problem later. Most

of the time, this check is a mere formality, since every wizard

worth her salt in Halruaa already knows every other one (either

as a potential ally or a rival) and is keenly aware of the dynam-

ics of all the various factions in the Council of Elders. Once

accepted into the council, each individual member ndsalevel

of participation that is both useful and comfortable.

When the netyarch dies or steps down, the full Council of

Elders convenes to select a new one. The elders are supposed to

choose the most powerful among their number, but the succession

meetings have always been contentious, politically charged aair.

The last three netyarchs have all been specialists in the school of

divination, primarily because diviners have demonstrated the value

of ferreting out threats to the nation before they actually occur.

Since most Halruaan wizards worship Mystra, her church plays

a key role in the government. Priests of the Lady of Mysteries

serve as judges for the state, determining truth and intent in all

criminal trials via divination spells. More recently, the legal side

of the governing process has opened up a bit more to servants of

Azuth, giving this segment of the population better representation

in all facets of Halruaan politics.

The Council of Elders determines policy for the nation at

large, but each town and city elects a mayor to handle local mat-

ters. In practice, the citizens almost always vote a Council Elder

to the post of mayor, since they believe that the most powerful

wizards are also the most qualied to run their communities.

The mayors manage the mundane issues in their communities

and appoint worthy individuals to llallmannerofgovernment

postsparticularly those that involve keeping the peace and

defense. Patrols, city guards, and, occasionally military forces are

common sights on the streets. Such a defensive unit almost always

includes a priest and a mage to serve as judge and executioner.

Enemies

To a Halruaan, people of any other nationality are enemies. The

Halruaans view natives of other nations as a bunch of greedy,

magic-grubbing freeloaders who cant wait to get their hands on

the results of all the wizards hard work. Perhaps this attitude

is a residual eect of Halruaas early days, when the displaced

Netherese believed that the phaerimms were coming for them,

or perhaps it results from the various raids on Halruaa in the

not-too-distant past. Whatever the cause, most folk in Halruaa

believe that everyone outside their nation covets their magic and

wishes to steal it.

Bandits

Perhaps the most irritating foes Halruaa faces are the endless

hordes of bandits that seem to worm their way over, through, and

under the North Wall from the Bandit Wastes. While divination

is a useful tool in forecasting major threats to the land, it does

not do as good a job predicting the arrival and movements of

small bands of raiders. Thus, the Halruaans from the northern

part of the country have learned to keep an eye open for trouble

and a hand near their spell components at all times.

Dambrath

Realistically speaking, few countries would dare to take on a

wizard nation directly. Thus far, the boldest such challenger has

been Dambrath, but historians have always found the wisdom

of that countrys pre-Crinti barbarian leadership suspect. More

recently, raiding the Nath has become great sport for the Crinti

of Dambrath, though such raids are typically forms of enter-

tainment sponsored by independent-minded nobles rather than

actual invasions organized by the queen and her advisors. Since

the rise of the diviners has led to better preparedness and more

eectivedefensesagainstoutsideattacksoverall,theCrintihave

been gradually losing interest in annoying their neighbors. Still,

the range of formidable mountains and the vast swamp that

separate the two countries are probably a boon to both. So long

as they do not venture far from the docks, Crinti merchants are

welcome to trade in Halruaan cities, and this courtesy seems to

appease both sides.

133

Halruaa

Lapaliiya

This loose confederation of city-states has decided before that

raiding Halruaa would be benecial. The acquisition of magic

is the most likely explanation for this decision, but that same

magic resulted in resounding defeat for the Lapaliiyan invaders,

and that situation isnt likely to change any time soon. Currently,

healthy levels of trade ow in both directions through Talath

Pass, and as long as the Lapaliiyans are willing to stay on their

side of the mountains, the Halruaans are happy to do business

with them.

Thay

Though overt hostilities have never broken out between these two

great magic-using nations, no one who understands the two coun-

tries at all has any doubt that they distrust one another. For their

part, the Red Wizards would like nothing more than to get their

hands on Halruaas more extraordinary secrets, and they have

tried repeatedly to establish an enclave in Halruaa, though all such

attempts have been rmlyrebued.TheHalruaanssuspectthat

letting the wizards to the north get a foothold in their country

would just be inviting endless trouble, no matter what pretense

the Thayans oered. Individual Red Wizards have occasionally

been caught sneaking into and around Halruaa, though what they

were doing there is anyones guess, since Halruaas policy is to

deal swiftly and summarily with all such trespassers before they

have a chance to cause any damageand often before they can

be made to talk. Not surprisingly, guesses as to the true reasons

for their presence usually involve the theft of magic.

Cities and Sites

The population of Halruaa congregates in numerous villages and

cities scattered throughout the countrys interior. Most of these

communities are small, cozy settlements with no more than a

few hundred inhabitants each. The folk in such a village can

usually rely on a wizard of at least 11th level to provide both

protection and leadership. Such an individual serves as the mayor

and probably also as a member of the Council of Elders.

The largest of Halruaas urban centers is small in comparison

to the great cities of most other nations, and Halruaas cities

are far less densely packed than the urban sprawls common

elsewhere. The capital city of Halarahh is the largest community

in Halruaa, but it boasts only about 8,000 citizens, though it

easily covers enough acreage for a city twice as large. Most

of the other major cities huddle along the shores of the sea,

the lakes, and the rivers, though a few have grown up around

the resources used in the countrys leading industriesnamely

mining and winemaking.

Life in the cities of Halruaa is touched by magic in many

ways. Quiet streets are lined with a variety of housessome large

and ostentatious, others small and modesteach of which has a

few built-in magical enhancements. A favorite practice in cities

along the coast is to magically coax coral to grow into walls

to enclose homes and gardens, and streets in all parts of the

country are well lit at night with light-producing spells that adjust

their brightness in relation to the time of day. Even a common

laborer might have a minor magic item or two at his disposal to

make some part of his life or work a bit easier. Spells of cooling,

cooking, and food preservation are available to everyone.

For those who can aordit,exoticmagicisasmuchameans

of decoration as a tool. Spells that produce sparkling light and

pleasing sounds are often woven into nefabricstoenhancetheir

beauty. Strange and highly magical creatures, such as behirs, are

favored as pets. Travel by means of oating carriages, carpets

of ying, or skyships is common. Everywhere in Halruaa, the

people take great pains to show o their abilities as well as

their wealth.

Aluarim (Small Town)

Situated near the banks of the river Aluar, Aluarim (population

1,328) is well protected from potential invaders by virtue of its

location in central Halruaa. The town functions primarily as a

shipping center for exports from the surrounding farms. Most

of the acreage of this quaint town is taken up by the produce

warehouses near the riverbanks, where the docks jut into the

water. Naval trac to and from Aluarim is steady, since it is

the last stop along the northbound shipping route except for

Eru in the far north.

Until about six months ago, Aluarim was the home of Rhodea

Firehair (NG female human evoker 18/Halruaan elder 3), the

most powerful evoker in the country. Rhodea was known for

her absolute fearlessness, and she led troops into combat on

several occasions.

Surprisingly, Rhodea died not in battle, but in an accident at

the royal mint involving a polymorphed dragon. A short time

after her tragic demise, her daughter Thalia was stabbed to death

by Procopio Septus and Dhamari Exchelsor, the two wizards

whose magic had caused the incident at the mint.

The tower in which Rhodea made her home has stood on the

northern fringes of Aluarim since before the town existed. For

reasons unknown, tradition demands that this tower always serve

as the home of an evoker. Its previous occupant, one Alteb Lazin,

was far less friendly with the locals than Rhodea was, though he

did his part to help defend the town when necessary. The tower

has been vacant since Rhodeas death, but her skyship, the Will

o Wisp, is still docked at the top.

Chasoln

A bizarre remnant of a civilization that predates the arrival of

the Netherese, Chasoln lies on the coast of the Great Sea at the

southern tip of the East Wall, close to the Bay of Pirates and

Yaulazna. Two stone heads with exaggerated features have been

carved out of the clis that border the ocean here, rising more

than 500 feet above the water. Almost caricatures of human

heads, these images stare out toward the ocean, ankinganopen

space in which a winding, narrow staircase leads up the side of

the cli from a narrow strip of sandy beach. Cut directly into

the rock, the stairs ascend for more than a quarter-mile above sea

level to a well-hidden outcropping that also faces the sea.

Atop this rocky ledge are some crumbled and tumbling ruins,

plus a large stone tablepossibly an altarcarved with bizarre

sea life and odd-looking ocean vessels. Flanking this table are two

134

wide, shallow, stone bowls, their interiors blackened from oil res.

Set back into the clifacetotherearoftheoutcroppingaretwo

sets of columns that ank the mouth of a tunnel, which opens

into a large, high-domed chamber with no other apparent exits.

More than a few adventurers have visited this site in hopes of

discovering more about the area and ndinganyhiddentreasures

that might lie inside.

Galdel (Large Town)

Galdel, a cozy community of about 3,200 people, lies on the south

side of Lake Halruaa. Its primary claim to fame is its population

of electrumsmiths. A dozen or so highly sought-after artisans

make their homes here, alloying gold and silver into the metal

known as electrum and fashioning neartobjects,rings,wands,

and weapons from it. Among these artisans is a dwarf craftsman

named Boronuil Ironst (LN male gold dwarf ghter 4/expert

13), who is considered by many to be the best in the business.

If the customer can aord it, Boronuil can craft custom-made

items from gold, silver, or electrum for magical enhancement.

He charges quadruple standard rates and has a waiting list of

two years or more.

Halagard (Small City)

With about 7,500 residents, Halagard is second only to Halarahh

in population. Situated at the mouth of the Halagard Channel on

the Bay of Halruaa, the city boasts a sizable shingeet.TheBay

of Halruaa is both a safe harbor and a productive shing area,

and sh is one of Halagards major exports. About two-thirds

of the sh taken from the bay go inland to feed the rest of the

nation, and the other third is smoked or salted and packaged for

shipping to distant lands.

For many years, Halagard served as the capital of Halruaa, but

a little more than a century ago, Zalathorm called the Council of

Elders to vote on moving the capital inland, where it would be

safer from potential invaders as well as the encroaching danger

of Akhlaur Swamp. The vote was close, with a strong bloc led

by the mayor of Halagard dissenting, but the measure passed,

and the citizens of Halagard have never forgiven the wizard-king

for this embarrassing slight. Despite the change, some residents

of Halagard still think of themselves as the true bearers of the

Halruaan spirit. In keeping with their stand against newfangled

Halarahhan fashions (a means by which they silently protest

their beloved citys demotion), wizards of Halagard generally

specialize in conjuration or evocation rather than divination.

The current mayor of Halagard is Eledric Omanrys (LN

male human conjurer 14/Halruaan elder 2), who is also a rather

inuential member of the Council of Elders. A conjurer of no

small talent, Eledric is very fond of apprentices and counselors,

so he makes a practice of surrounding himself with numerous

conjurers-in-training and Jordaini advisors. The lives of his ap-

prentices are not easy; he works them hard and expects a great

deal from them. Despite his reputation as a dicult master,

however, he never lacks applicants to ll vacancies on his sta,

since he is one of the most powerful conjurers in the land.

Twelve other elders also live in Halagard. The number of elders

outskirts of the city, the dangers it sheltered became more obvious.

Halruaa

The situation had to be dealt with quickly to prevent Halagard

from being swallowed up in the morass of wetlands. To that end,

several prominent wizards moved to Halagard to study the swamps

progress and research ways of thwarting the encroachment. Still

others came merely to provide some defense against the dangerous

creatures wandering out of the swamp. Now that the portal to the

Elemental Plane of Water within the swamp has been closed, most

of the wizards who came to study the phenomenon have left, but

a few, nding the city to their liking, remained.

Halarahh (Small City)

The seat of Zalathorms power, Halarahh has a population just

slightly above 8,000, making it the largest city in Halruaa. This

wide, sprawling town is situated on the northern banks of Lake

Halruaa, at the mouth of the river Halar. The city boasts lots of

expansive public places for strolling, oratory, and celebrations.

Fully three thousand of the capital citys inhabitants, includ-

ing seventeen members of the Council of Elders, are practicing

wizards, giving Halarahh the largest concentration of magical

prowess anywhere outside Thay. Hundreds of wizards towers

lofty edices built of colorful coral, stone, crystal, and magical

forcedominate the skyline, jutting upward from an otherwise

low-slung city prole.Inpastdecades,eachwizardtriedtooutdo

his rivals by building the highest tower with the grandest and most

breathtaking view of the countryside around the city. Eventually,

however, the risks to both towers and skyships forced Zalathorm to

actively discourage this tower war, and the mad building spree

halted. In hopes of currying Zalathorms favor, some wizards have

actually reduced the height of their towers, making the skies that

much safer for skyships.

Because of its high concentration of wizards and the fact that

the wizard-king and his council conduct business here, Halarahh

is a dicult place for those not gifted in the Art to live. In all

walks of life, favorable treatment and promotions come to those

who have the spark but elude those who lack magical aptitude.

The obvious exceptions to this rule are the Jordaini. These magi-

cally immune counselors vie for positions and prestige alongside

their wizardly patrons in the never-ending game of politics that

is Zalathorms court. Though they cannot partake of the vast

wealthboth scal and magicalthat is available to so many

others in the city, their stature in the eyes of everyone from the

wizard-king down to the lowliest street urchin is auenceenough

for them.

Arbor Square

Near the Netyarchs Palace in the heart of the city lies Arbor

Square, an expanse of parks, rivers, pavilions, and gazebos

designed for strolling, chatting, or orating. A wide variety

of temperate to tropical trees, many of which are owering

or fruit-bearing, lls the square. Vine-covered trellises create

spaces for private conversations, and bridges span manmade

canal-rivers, giving Arbor Square the feel of a vast, perfectly

manicured garden. Along the periphery, vendors sell wares rang-

ing from edible treats and beverages to magic trinkets such as

cooling caps (hats with minor chilling spells cast upon them)

Halarahh, capital of Halruaa

and dazzle stones (pretty colored rocks enspelled with cantrips

to make them blink or spark.)

The citizens of Halarahh come to Arbor Square regularly

to converse, debate, or listen to passionate orations. Anyone is

free to step onto a platform and begin ponticatingonwhatever

subject most concerns him, but a few well-known speakers always

draw the largest crowds. Some of the liveliest debates that have

led to policy changes for the nation began as passionate speeches

in Arbor Square.

Dockside Square

As with other Halruaan cities, much of Halarahh has grown up

along the shoreline. Its docks, however, are not the tight, noisy

causeways abutted by closely packed warehouses that are standard

for Faerns port cities. Instead, its broad docks quickly give way

to an open park known as Dockside Square. This open plaza is

paved in colored stone, and large trees provide good quantities of

shade for strolling and chatting. Interspersed among the trees are

numerous pavilions with brightly colored awnings.

Dockside Square is the customary site for just about every

festival and fair that takes place in the city. In the spring, when

the Queens Regatta is held over Lake Halruaa, crowds gather in

Dockside Square to witness the spectacle and hopefully gain a bit

of the scatted fortune dust that oatsdownduringthetraditional

light shows. In the summer, the square hosts numerous monster

fairs in which exhibitors oer their latest catches from all over

Faern. Wizards interested in procuring fashionable pets, prepar-

ing new culinary delights, or simply restocking consumed spell

components ocktotheseeventstoexaminethewares.Asone

Durpari merchant said upon visiting Halarahh during a monster

fair, If you can eat it, cage it, put it on a leash, or chop it up for

parts, like as not itll be there.

The Ice House

In a low-slung building near the docks, numerous journeymen

wizards are hard at work each day, using their magic to generate

huge quantities of ice. Once created, the ice is promptly segmented

into blocks, wrapped in insulating cloth, and delivered all over

the city to those who can aord the luxury and to those who

cant operate their businesses without it.

Because the manpower needed to create so much frozen water is

extraordinary, even by wizard standards, the possibility of securing

a steady source of ice by creating a portal to the Ice Wastes in

the Abyss has recently been under discussion. The cost savings in

magic would be immense and immediately felt, but the potential

dangers of such an option have thus far kept the proposal bottled

up in committee among the elders of the council.

The Netyarchs Palace

Even in Halarahh, where wizards who mix magic with archi-

tecture vie with one another to create the grandest homes, the

Netyarchs Palace is more dazzling than any other edice.

137

Halruaa

The sprawling structure is a masterpiece of architecture that fea-

tures soaring spires connected by causeways seemingly suspended

in thin air. Large facings and supports made of transparent

materialor sometimes magical forcegive the whole building

an open, airy feel.

Inside, the heavy-handed use of magic borders on the

frivolous. Every room is decorated with a liberal sprinkling of

magical enhancements. A night sky, an ocean-caressed beach

at dusk, and an otherworldly scene of glowing ora from the

distant Underdark are among the many lighted displays designed

to resemble majestic outdoor scenes. Various chambers have been

built to showcase the more interesting properties of sound, and

the hallways are lledwithmagicconstructsdesignedtofrighten,

delight, and awe the viewer. Life-sized mechanical dragons,

complete with misty vapors issuing from their mouths, crouch

in niches along the wide corridors, and specially created display

cases lled with living, breathing, miniaturized versions of real

creatures form dividing walls between rooms. Deep within the

heart of the palace, a few special rooms illuminated with articial

sunlight feature thick rain forests populated by colored birds,

snakes, and tree frogs.

But not all the magic in the wizard-kings grand home is

for show. The entire place is warded with untold varieties of

protective magic designed to prevent entry by thieves and assas-

sins, and to keep treasures safe. Several wings of the palace are

strictly forbidden to visitors because they are replete with deadly

symbols, animated guardians, and binding magic intended to

destroy trespassers rather than just thwarting them.

The Promenade

One of the most fashionable and enjoyable pastimes for the citi-

zens of Halarahh is to see and be seen strolling the Promenade,

especially at dusk. The Promenade is a wide walkway that runs

along the tops of the city walls, which for the most part are

ceremonial rather than functional, anyway. The path can be

reached via several sets of wide marble stairs, making it readily

accessible to the citizens. Every evening, hundreds of the citys

well-to-do venture forth dressed in their best nery(whichoften

bears magical enhancements) and perhaps walking their favorite

Halruaan behir or other pet. These folk have made a game of

seeing whether they can outdo one another, but simply being

part of the crowd is the most important consideration.

House Jordain

Along the very southern coast of Halruaa, on a peninsula that

juts out into the Bay of Taertal, a large, sprawling complex looks

out over the Great Sea. This walled compound is House Jordain,

home of the order that trains and indoctrinates all the magic-

resistant counselors known as Jordaini. House Jordain boasts

enough acreage to support large gardens and numerous eldsof

crops, plus provide plenty of open land for grazing herd beasts.

In the center of the grounds stand several buildings that house

barracks, a kitchen and dining hall, classrooms, and combat

training facilities for the aspiring Jordaini who live there. Like

other major plantations and ranches, House Jordain is entirely

self-sucient,thoughitmaintainstraderelationswiththenearby

city of Khaerbaal anyway, so as to acquire trade goods its residents

cannot produce themselves.

Not just anyone can come to House Jordain to learn the

ways of the magic-resistant Jordaini; its recruits are literally

bred for the task. Divination spells select parents that can

provide the proper genetic makeup, and special elixirs ensure

that the newborns resulting from such planned pairings have

an uncommonly powerful innate resistance to magic. Once a

Jordaini is born and determined to be an appropriate candidate,

every detail of his life is carefully planned out by the hierarchy

of House Jordain.

House Jordain serves as home not only to aspiring Jordaini

but also to numerous wizards who serve as instructors and train-

ers. Each day, they present the Jordaini with a wide variety of

magical challenges, honing their charges to physical and mental

perfection. At the same time, they use other spells to teach the

young Jordaini how to retain knowledge and become indispensable

to their future patrons.

Khaerbaal (Small City)

On the southern coast, sheltered in the Bay of Taertal, lies the

city of Khaerbaal. Like most of Halruaas settlements, Khaerbaal

is open, airy, and lled with wide avenues, parks, and plazas,

though it is undeniably rougher around the edges than most of

its sister communities.

One of only two bases for the small Halruaan navy, Khaerbaal

has about fteen seafaring ships and six skyships in residence.

The navys principal fortied base and construction docks are

on the isle of Rulasuu, which lies just o Khaerbaals coast.

Since Rulasuu has no real cityjust a military fortication

and the accompanying docksmost of the sailors based there

take shore leave in Khaerbaal. The unusually large number of

inns and taverns that have sprung up to handle this trade make

Khaerbaal a rather wild town.

In addition to serving as a military post, Khaerbaal also

functions as a trading center for the southwestern section of

the country. Merchant ships whose captains dont wish to make

the trip all the way up the mouth of the bay into Lake Halruaa

come to Khaerbaal instead. The prices here are nearly as good as

those in the interior, and merchants can shave several days o

their travels by trading here. Most of the people in Khaerbaal

who arent wizards or military personnel are merchants who

represent all the local villages and farms of the region.

Khaerbaal is governed by Grozalum (N male human il-

lusionist 16/Halruaan elder 2), the leading elder of the city,

though he is rarely present. Grozalum prefers to spend his time

at the netyarchs court in Halarahh, hoping to curry favor and

funding for his endless series of magical research projects. In his

absence, he leaves the aairs of the city to the naval ocers,

who have to spend as much time keeping their own troops in

line as enforcing the law. Such an arrangement has naturally

led to no small amount of resentment among the ocers,who

feel that their time and resources are stretched too thin. Thus

far, however, the citizens of Khaerbaal have been disinclined to

make a change because they are quite happy with only a small

governmental presence.

138

Halruaa

Perhaps the single most signicantfeatureofKhaerbaalother

than its military eet is the spacious park in the center of the

city, where several great bilboa trees grow. These gigantic trees

tower high above all the buildings, and experts claim that this

great size is almost certainly due to magical inuence.Theradius

of a bilboa trees top can easily reach 100 feet, creating a self-

contained world within its foliage. Transients and vermin often

nest in the hollows of the great bilboa trees, creating settlements

similar to the slums in other cities of Faern.

Maeruhal (Village)

Deep within the foothills of the East Wall sits Maeruhal, the

settlement closest to the nations gold mines. Little more than a

rough-and-tumble mining town, Maeruhal is lledwithfolkwho

dig for gold by day and carouse in the evenings. The merchants

who cater to the miners expect a raucous crowd in the evenings,

and they strive to oer goods and services that appease their

patrons while minimizing brawls and riots. Plenty of bards

and musicians make their way to Maeruhal, as do courtesans

of every persuasion and interest. Gambling halls occupy every

street corner, and some wizards (particularly illusionists) have

made small fortunes oeringmagicalentertainmentsandshows

for the locals to enjoy.

Despite its rough reputation, Maeruhal is not completely

lawless. Two companies of dwarf mercenaries, the Righteous

Hammers and the Golden Shield, have agreed to enforce the

peace on behalf of the handful of elders who call the town home.

Just as gruandrowdyastherestofthefolk,thesetroopsbash

a few heads when the need arises and brook no nonsense from

anyone. In general, however, they keep the place quiet enough

that outsiders arent afraid to visit.

Each of the elders living here has a skyship, though they

have little use for such ostentatious items other than personal

prestige and enjoyment. Some of the more rambunctious locals

occasionally try to swipe one of the yingvesselsandtakeitfor

a joyride, so the wizards have had to employ creative security

measures to dissuade theft without harming the miscreants.

Mount Talath (Small Town)

Considered by some to be the center of magic in Halruaa, Mount

Talath is a small town located high on the slopes of one of the

tallest mountains in the Walls. The town is really nothing more

than a series of homes for the folk who work in the high temple

to Mystra carved into the mountainside.

The high priestess of the temple is Greila Sontoin (LN

female human cleric 20 of Mystra), who is said to have gained

unearthly wisdom and insight into all things magical through

both her own magic and the favor of Mystra. Though Greila is

very old and seldom leaves the temple anymore, she is still capable

of powerful magic, and she could be a formidable challenger to

Zalathorm should the two ever cross one another. Fortunately,

the wizard-king and the high priestess are on good terms and

communicate regularly because each trusts the others judgment

about most issues.

The Temple of Mystra is a magnicentstructurewithsoaring

spires that seem impossibly tall alongside the steep mountain

slope. Like the grand towers of the wizards in the cities below,

the temple is built primarily of stout stone, but it also includes

crystalline walls and permanent walls of force. Anyone wishing

to pay homage to the Mistress of Magic may enter here to wor-

ship, but those who come expecting to get their hands on unique

spells or magic items are invariably disappointed. All items of

true value are kept behind and beneath the temple proper, in

a huge cavern complex designed to store centuries of magical

knowledge safely.

Gaining access to the temple storerooms is no easy matter.

Visitors who wish to enter the storehalls must undergo a rigorous

series of magical screenings. Those who pass muster are admitted,

but the depth to which any particular individual may roam is

strictly dened, and the temple sta might require the visitor

to be escorted while inside. A member of the Council of Elders

is permitted access to almost every section, but other natives of

Halruaa are restricted to the more mundane areas. Visitors to the

country can only scratch the proverbial surface, and each must

pay a ridiculously high fee to gain access at any level. Travelers

who return to their native lands from a trip to the temple at

139

Halruaa

Mount Talath often speak of its wondrous libraries, not realizing

that they have not seen a third of its treasures.

Despite the best eorts of the priests, thieves and spies oc-

casionally gain entrance, but ample abjuration magic is always

in place to deal with such intruders. Many are not found for

several days after they have been fried, frozen, or partially

disintegrated.

The complex has some degree of organizationvisitors can

usually locate any desired piece of magical knowledge with no

more than ve or six years worth of diligent research. Halru-

aan wizards pride themselves on their ability to track down the

information they need in Talaths caverns, and some diviners

have actually devoted their lives to the goal of devising new

spells expressly for speeding that process. In the end, though, no

one in all Halruaaexcept perhaps a lich or two with knowledge

of such mattershas any real idea just how vast the body of

information within Mount Talath is.

Talathgard

The fortress of Talathgard sits in the bottom of the pass at

the base of Mount Talath. The military force stationed here is

charged with guarding the path that leads to the settlement of

Mount Talath and the entrance to the High Temple of Mystra

near the mountains summit.

Talathgard is staedwithanelite,200-memberforceofpotent

wizards and battle-hardened warriors. No wizard of Halruaa is

foolishly prideful enough to believe that such defenses can keep

out every creature intent on gaining entrance to the temple

or the cavern complex behind it, but the force does deter most

potential threats. Ninety percent of the prowlers are chased o

before they get beyond the gates of Talathgard; the other ten

percent know better than to come at the temple from the front

road anyway.

In addition to serving as a gatehouse for the temple, Talathgard

also provides a rst line of defense for Talath Pass, which con-

nects Halruaa with Lapaliiyaa nation with which the wizards

of Halruaa have squabbled in the past.

Yaulazna (Bay of Pirates) (Hamlet)

Hidden deep within the inlet known as the Bay of Pirates, the

secret shantytown of Yaulazna serves as a refuge and hangout

for many of the pirates who ply the waters along the coast of

the Great Sea. Half of this hamlet lies on shore; the other half

on a oatingplatformcomposedofderelictshipsthathavebeen

lashed together. The landbound portion was built on a much older

sitea collection of ancient foundations and odd stone columns

dating from the same time and culture as the ruins at Chasoln.

Numerous tunnels, warrens, and chambers honeycomb the ground

beneath and behind the shantytown, where the mountains rise

up from the ocean.

Unlike Purl to the east, Yaulazna has a strong central author-

ity gurethe legendary Pirate King Yargo (LE male lightfoot

halingrogue9/GreatSeacorsair8).Yargoconsidershimselfthe

owner of Yaulazna, and for all intents and purposes, he is right.

He maintains iron-sted control of the community, and he has

the hired muscle to back up his word. But despite his authoritar-

ian nature, most of the pirates welcome Yargos authority in

Yaulazna.

First and foremost, Yargo provides pirates with a suitable

place to hide when either the law or a rival is hot on his trail.

The Pirate King couldnt care less what a pirate does on the high

seas. As long as he minds his manners while in port, hes free

from persecution or retribution.

Second, Yargo happily resolves disputes between feuding cor-

sairs who come before him. His one stipulation is that anyone

who chooses to submit to his counsel must abide by his decision

or never be welcomed back in Yaulazna again.

Third, Yargo maintains a standing oerthatanyonewishing

to store plunder can keep it safely in the caverns beneath the

town for as long as desired, so long as Yargo gets ten percent of

its total value, payable upon placing the goods in storage. The

Pirate King has demonstrated his own trustworthiness on so many

occasions that most of the pirates feel comfortable taking him

up on his oer, and an astonishing amount of booty is hidden

in the network of chambers underground. Once in a while, a

rogue pirate sneers at the thought of handing his treasure over

to Yargo for safekeeping, but the Pirate King never has to defend

his practice. Almost every other pirate in town quickly speaks up

on Yargos behalf when such a situation occurs.

An outsider might nd it somewhat surprising that the

navies of the coastal countries have made no eort to shut

down Yaulazna, but Yargo has planned for such a contingency.

In fact, both Halruaa and Dambrath have tried several times to

sail an armada into the Bay of Pirates and burn the shantytown

to the ground, but each time ships have arrived, their crews have

found nothing to put to torchas if the whole place had simply

vanished. This impression is actually not far removed from the

truth. Yargo has a powerful frienda renegade wizard from

Halruaa named Zuusted Nimderval (NE male human conjurer

20), who has developed a variation on the plane shift spell that

actually causes the entire shantytown to vanish to another plane

temporarily. For security, Yargo simply posts watches near the

entrance to the bay and higher up the sides of the mountain (to

watch for skyships), and Zuusted uses magical means to detect

scrying spells and creatures trying to approach with magical

stealth. At the rstsignoftrouble,theshantytownandeveryone

in it shifts away until the heat is o. Yargo uses a good portion

of the money that pirates pay him for storing their treasure to

keep Zuusted happy.

Zalazuu (Large Town)

Zalazuu, located on the Bay of Azuth, is a large town of nearly

5,000 people that serves as the main trading center for the south-

eastern portion of Halruaa. Like Khaerbaal, Zalazuu functions

as an urban getaway for a nearby Halruaan naval base. Almost

2,000 military troops and nearly twenty warships (both seagoing

vessels and skyships) are stationed at Fort Zalazuu, a large walled

fortress located just outside the town.

Lailuu Gyrrite (LG female human cleric 19 of Mystra) rules

Zalazuu, but she is more concerned with defending Halruaa than

ruling the city. She leaves the day-to-day administration of the

town to a bureaucracy of petty clerks and ocialsthathasbecome

more massive and unwieldy with each passing year. Most of these

civil servants have little or no skill with magic, but they have

managed to elevate their own importance (and thus, preserve

their job security in a nation predisposed to favor wizards) by

creating a tangle of forms, procedures, and regulations that no

one else understands. As a result, trade in this port of call is less

lucrative than it could be, simply because most merchants know

its easier to conduct business in other Halruaan cities. Despite

the extra travel time, most of them believe its better to sail up

the channel than to stop in Zalazuu.

The Kilmaruu Swamp

Just east of the town of Zalazuu lies the Kilmaruu Swamp.

Though slightly less famous than Akhlaur Swamp near Hala-

gard, it is still a fetid, dangerous spot and a threat to those

who live nearby. In fact, this bog is part of the reason that the

Halruaan navy has based so many of its vehicles and troops

in Zalazuu.

Somewhere in the middle of the swamp lies a ruined city. Few

have managed to reach the ruins and return with any details,

but those who did come back revealed that the city was built

by elves before the swamp existed. For reasons unknown, a trio

of powerful Halruaan wizards diverted a river that normally

owed into the Bay of Azuth and ooded the elf community.

The elves attempted to battle the wizards, hoping to drive them

away so that they could restore the river to its normal course,

but they could not prevail. Their community was destroyed, and

the slain elves rose as undead creatures. Their festering nega-

tive energy eventually pervaded the entire swamp, saturating

it with foul diseases, twisted and corrupted creatures, and still

more undead.

Soldiers and adventurers alike have tried time and again to

rid the swamp of this foul pestilence, but until recently, almost

every eort served only to make the swamp more deadly. To

quote a common Zalazuu expression, The swamp helps keep the

number of fools in town low. A few months ago, however, the

magehound Kiva took a group of Jordaini into the swamp and

destroyed the green sphere (an artifact created by the necromancer

Akhlaur) that had been responsible for their creation. Ever since,

the number of undead creatures in the swamp has been shrinking

rapidly. Now that their reign of terror has ended, more mages

and other adventurers have started to search the ruins, hoping

to recover the lost treasures of the elves.

Heroes and Monsters

Most characters who hail from Halruaa are human, though a hero

of some other race could easily originate in that country. A gold

dwarf, for example, might be the ospringofgoldminersinthe

eastern mountains or craftsfolk from any of a dozen cities that

export nejewelryoritemsdestinedformagicalenhancement.

An elf or half-elf could be the child of one of the elf wizards on

the Council of Elders. In addition, a few halings from nearby

Luiren have migrated to the coastal cities over the centuries,

nding urban life in a land of wizards to be interesting and

lled with opportunity.

Since wizards are especially abundant in Halruaa, any

wizard character could easily hail from that nation. Bards

are also common, though most have heard more than a few

snickers about their parlor magic. Sorcerers are not unknown

in Halruaa, but they are exceedingly rare, and many take up

adventuring to leave a life of suspicion and persecution behind.

Priests of the deities of magic and spellcasting are common

enough in Halruaa, but those devoted to other deities are

almost nonexistent. Druids and rangers are more common in

the rural sections of the countrysideparticularly on or near

the mountainsthan they are in the cities. A few monks have

trained in the temples dedicated to the deities of magic, and

an occasional paladin champions an esoteric cause, but neither

class is prevalent in Halruaa. Likewise, rogues and barbarians

are exceedingly rare.

All the feats in Chapter 1 are relevant to a character who calls

Halruaa home. The Halruaan magehound, Halruaan elder, and

jordain vizier prestige classes detailed in Chapter 2 are particularly

suitable for characters hailing from the land of wizards.

Few monsters roam Halruaa, primarily because its citizens

have taken such careful pains to ensure that their home remains

free of such threats. However, adventurers are likely to ndafew

monstrous creatures between the Walls, including the beguiler,

the Halruaan behir, the laraken, and the starsnake. Other crea-

turestypically those with the strength and endurance to nd

their way across the mountainsinclude dragons, lizardfolk,

werebeasts, summoned creatures, and yuan-ti.

141

L uiren, the land of the halings, is both peaceful

and bustling. Though halings can be found in

almost every country in Faern, all their ancestors

originally migrated from Luiren. Sometimes known as Small

Folk, halings actually prefer the term hin, the name they call

themselves. But they dont hold the use of other names against

visitors who dont know any better. Theyre happy enough to

Geographic Overview

The hin nation of Luiren sits on the southern coast of Faern,

nestled between Dambrath to the west and Estagund to the east.

The settled portions of the kingdom wrap around a small bay

known as the Luirenstrand, on a strip of ground between the bay

and the Lluirwood that measures no more than 30 to 50 miles

wide in most places. This populated region stretches generally

southwest to northeast, covering approximately 275 miles from

the edge of the Southern Lluirwood to the point where the

Lluirwood meets the ocean, just east of Fasruil.

The Lluirwood lies north of the open coastland where the

major settlements are. Though ostensibly part of the kingdom,

the forest is mostly untamed wilderness, and few halingsdare

venture into it. The north side of the Lluirwood is bounded by

the Toadsquat Mountains, and beyond those, the vast plains of

the Eastern Shaar stretch away for hundreds of miles. Most of

Luirens countryside is lled with gentle, rolling hills blanketed

with rich soil that supports a wide range of crops. Small copses

of very large, very old trees dot this pastoral landscape. The

only portion of the nonforested land that is not arable is the

Mortik Swamp, which butts up against the southern coast of

the Luirenstrand and divides the southern peninsula of Luiren

in half.

Like the rest of southern Faerns coastal region, Luiren

is warm and humid through most of the year. Because of the

Toadsquat Mountains, which catch the updrafts of humid air

otheoceanandchurnthemintocooler,rain-lledcloudsover

the woodlands, Luiren gets more rain than either Dambrath to

the west or Estagund to the east. The season of heaviest rain,

during the winter months, slows trade and travel but is good for

the growing season during the rest of the year.

Major Geographic

Features

The green, rolling farmland that makes up most of Luiren is

bounded on three sides by forest or mountains, and on the fourth

by the ocean. Though the halings enjoy the forests, they do

not stray far into the woods for fear of the monsters that live

there. Most of the region is rural, and the halings grow grains,

vegetables, and citrus fruits for eating or sale to merchants from

other lands. In the quaint communities of hillside tunnel-homes

that dot the open country, the hin often gather together to share

produce, stories, and news from other lands.

The Lluirwood

Sometimes referred to as the Long Forest by the halings to

the south, the Lluirwood stretches more than 400 miles along

the north side of Luiren, covering nearly half the country.

Along its whole length, citrus trees and many warm-weather

evergreens form a deep, dark canopy that shelters trailing vines

and a profusion of undergrowth. Where the northern side of the

forest climbs up the slopes of the Toadsquats, numerous hardwood

trees, especially oaks, which thrive in the cooler temperatures,

replace the less hardy varieties.

Though no place within the forest is safe, the eastern end is by

far the more dangerous, especially in and around Thruldar. Ghost-

wise halingscallthisareahome,andtheybrooknointrusioninto

their territory. In addition to the occasional bandits, the eastern

end of the Lluirwood is home to immense spiders, rhino beetles,

yingsnakes,stirges,andperhapsworstofall,tallmouthers.The

western section of the wood serves as the expansive temple of

Nola Treesong (NG female strongheart haling ranger 5/druid

8 of Sheela Peryroyl), who spends her time nurturing the forest,

aiding marchwardens in keeping it safe, and discouraging foolish

and unprepared folk from venturing too far into its depths.

The Luirenstrand

The bay known as the Luirenstrand is not as calm and safe as

either the Bay of Dolphins to the west or the Golden Water to the

east. Its depths are noticeably darker and murkier than either of

those two bodies of water, and the halings,whoarenotmuchfor

sailing, spend little time on its surface. Still, the amount of trade

passing in and out of Luiren means that merchant ships crisscross

the Luirenstrand on a regular basis. A regularly scheduled route

from Shoun to Krenalir crosses the bay in one direction every

couple of days to ferry merchants and other folk between those

two cities, thereby saving them several days travel overland.

The Mortik Swamp

The Mortik Swamp is a lowland region in southern Luiren that

eectivelyseparatesthetipofthepeninsulafromtherestofthe

country. The region is so close to sea level that the ground cannot

drain properly, and the excess water has formed a swamp.

Mortik Swamp is a nasty bog lled with countless pests. In

addition to the giant ticks that give the place its name, Mortik

is also home to giant varieties of frogs, snakes, water spiders, and

deadly wasps, as well as biting swarms of more mundane insects.

Perhaps the most dangerous and cunning inhabitants of the

swamp, however, are the merrow. These creatures occasionally raid

the surrounding farms and caravans, carrying olivestockand

food stores to feed their tribes. A powerful shaman or chieftain

known as the Bog King (CE male merrow barbarian 7) presides

over these creatures. With these creatures at his command, the

Bog King can make the road between Chethel and Krenadir a

dangerous route.

Almost as long as this region has been inhabited, rumor

has held that a hidden city lies somewhere in the middle of the

swamp. To date, the persistent lack of evidence to support such

claims has never stopped adventurers from trying their luck.

Most of those foolhardy enough to brave the Mortik and lucky

enough to return emerge with swamp fever, rashes, leech bites,

and mud-covered bodies, but no fortunes to speak of.

Quelthiir

The isle of Quelthiir is little more than a wide sandbar that divides

the mouth of the Luirenstrand from the rest of the Great Sea. The

entire island, 100 miles long but only 10 miles wide, is made up

mostly of low hills covered with sea grasses, scrub brush, and a few

scattered, stunted trees. Every few years, a storm surging inland from

the ocean scours the island unmercifully with rain and wind.

Despite its inhospitable geography, this island is the source

of many rumors. More than a few tales have hinted at buried

treasure hidden on the island by pirates who once terrorized the

southern coast of Faern. The most-often heard rumor revolves

around Captain Jape One-Eye Belson, a notorious rake from

Durpar with a cunning nature and a mean streak. According to

the stories, One-Eye seized a fortune in pearls and silver from

an outbound Dambrathan merchant ship that he subsequently

sent to the bottom of the sea with its entire crew still on board.

Thereafter, he sailed straight to Quelthiir, where he constructed

a buried vault protected by all sorts of nasty tricks and traps.

He supposedly hid the loot in the vault and then high-tailed it

to Purl to hole up for a while, but the Dambrathans caught him

and dragged him to the temple of Loviatar, along with his entire

crew. His treasure, if it ever existed, must still be sitting at the

bottom of that hidden vault.

The Southern Lluirwood

This untamed stretch of forest serves as an eectiveboundarybe-

tween Luiren and Dambrath. In the formative years of Faern, the

Lluirwood and the Southern Lluirwood comprised a single, great

forest that covered present-day Lluiren. This vast woodland was

eventually divided into two parts by a combination of clearcutting

by the stronghearts after the Hin Ghostwars, several bouts with

tree blights, and the need for a road to Delzimmer. In the years

since, the Southern Lluirwood has shrunk to perhaps two-thirds

of its original size, but it is still shunned by most prudent folk.

A gloomy, mysterious place, the Southern Lluirwood houses

creepy, dark things that the halingsuseintheirghoststories.Some

of the hin (particularly marchwardens) try to patrol the periphery

of the woodland, but the dangers are so real and subtle that many

of them simply disappear and are never seen again. What they

dont realize is that two dierentbutverydangerouscreatures

roam the forest, and neither of them likes to be noticed.

The rst threat is a tribe of yuan-ti based in the southern

regions of the Black Jungles on the Chultan Peninsula. Members

of this tribe have been entering the wood for some time by means

of a two-way portal and kidnapping halingswhostraytooclose,

then transporting them back to their own city for experimenta-

tion. In addition, these woods are haunted by a tribe of beholders

led by a very old and cunning beholder mage named Xianthrope

(LE beholder mage 7). Xianthrope has created a number of death

tyrants to destroy both hin and yuan-ti who wander into their

hunting grounds.

The Toadsquat Mountains

The Toadsquat Mountains form Luirens northern border, divid-

ing it from the Eastern Shaar to the north. This range, sometimes

referred to as the Little Mountains by people in Estagund, is

old and worn, and its gentle slopes are covered with trees on the

south side, where it merges with the Lluirwood. If it werent for

the silver that lies in the depths of these mountains, few would

pay them any attention at all.

Numerous tribes of gold dwarves live in the mountains and

work the silver mines they have established there. The Stout Folk

144

Luiren

divide their time between extracting the silver and battling the

ogres that contest their living space. In recent years, the ghting

has gotten worse, primarily because an ogre mage named Kalispar

Onefang (LE male ogre mage sorcerer 7) has been organizing

and inciting his followers toward more aggressive tactics against

the dwarves.

People of Luiren

Most folk who visit Luiren come away with a mixed sense of

warmth and confusion. The halingsofthislandarehappyand

gregarious, but their customs and traditions seem more than a

little strange to anyone from another land. On the coast, where

the majority of their trade occurs, the halings go out of their

way to accommodate the Big Folk, building larger places for them

to sit, eat, and sleep. Those living inland are just as happy to see

humans, elves, half-elves, and dwarves as their kin on the coast,

but about the best they can oer in the way of hospitality is a

dry barn and a hot meal or two.

Races and Cultures

Though the hin can be found in almost every corner of Faern,

they are considered visitors everywhere in the world except here.

In the cities of the humans, halingsareoftenrelegatedtoethnic

neighborhoods. In Luiren, however, the hin rule, and their culture

reectsthatfact.FewmembersoftheotherracesstayinLuiren

longnot because they are inherently unwelcome, but simply

because they dont t inboth literally and guratively.

The three halings subraces all look the same, though their

manner of dress tends to dierentiate them from one another.

The typical hin stands about 3 feet tall and weighs between 30

and 40 pounds. She has dark brown or black eyes, ruddy skin, and

straight, black hair. Once in a while, however, a child is born with

fairer skin and curly brown or red-brown hair. Such a feature is

always considered a good portent, and the hin say that such a

child is blessed by Brandobaris.

Halflings (Ghostwise)

Very few ghostwise halings still dwell in Luiren, and those

who do live deep in the Lluirwood. These hin are rarely seen

by visitors.

Halflings (Lightfoot)

Though lightfoot halingscallLuirenhome,theyconstituteonly

a small minority there because most of them departed the Llu-

irwood right after the Ghostwars. According to the tales passed

down from parents to children, the lightfoots were unwilling to

remain in close proximity to the sites of the massacres that had

occurred during that conict.Thosefewwhostayedbehindhad

little choice but to settle in with the stronghearts, trading in

their nomadic ways for more sedentary lifestyles.

respect to their strongheart cousins. In fact, the only discern-

habit of frequent relocation within Luiren (see Life and Society,

below) was instituted by the lightfoots to assuage their wanderlust

without actually leaving their homeland, though this practice was

later adopted by the stronghearts as well. Lightfoots immensely

enjoy pets, and the typical lightfoot family keeps a large hound

of some sort as both companion and protector. Lightfoots might

not be quite as stodgy and dour as their strongheart cousins, but

both groups have learned that the only way to convince the tall

people to leave them alone is to ghtback.Thelightfootsused

to just run away, but now they stand shoulder to shoulder with

their strongheart neighbors when necessary.

Halflings (Strongheart)

Of the three subraces of halings native to Faern, the strong-

hearts are the most closely tied to Luiren, and the vast majority

of them still reside in their native land. It was the stronghearts

who rst experienced the depradations of the ghostwise tribe

during the Hin Ghostwars, and the stronghearts were the ones

who insisted on seeing that grisly work all the way to its conclusion

(see History of Luiren, below). After the Hin Ghostwars, the

strongheart halings chose to turn away from their previously

nomadic existence, clearing the forest and settling the land now

known as Luiren.

Though not quite as dour and reserved as ghostwise halings,

the stronghearts are the most down-to-earth and practical of the

three subraces. Whereas the lightfoots have never completely

shaken otheirdesirefortravel,moststrongheartsarecontent

to work their land, share their goods, and enjoy a pleasant evening

in front of a hearth with a lled pipe. At the same time, the

stronghearts have adapted well to the lightfoots concept of a

partially nomadic existence, and they occasionally pack up and

shift to new locations (and as often as not new careers) without

undue thought. The strongheart tribe has earned its name on

more than one occasion from its members ercedetermination

to stand strong in the face of adversity, to defend their homeland

and protect their young, and to endure the hardships of the land.

More than a few would-be invaders have been surprised by the

unwavering determination of their strongheart foes.

Strongheart halingsprefertodressinsimplegarbsuitable

heart typically wears loose pants stuedinsidestoutworkboots,

with a sleeveless leather lace-up vest over a simple linen shirt. A

female usually prefers a peasant dress, often with an apron, and

a simple cap beneath which to tuck her hair. During inclement

weather, a haling of either gender wears a light cloak to keep

out the damp. In addition, a typical strongheart takes along a

good walking stick wherever she goes.

Life and Society

The halings of Luiren live a happy-go-lucky lifestyle that suits

them well but causes some misunderstandings with other races.

Teamwork is a major component of hin society, and just about

every haling worth his salt pitches in to help with whatever

community project is at hand. The Small Folk have an innate

understanding of the fact that no individual can get much done

without cooperation from his fellows.

One unique aspect of Luirens culture is the halings occa-

sional desire to uproot themselves and relocate. A family might

suddenly decide to move to another part of the same town, or

even to a dierentcity.Familiesoftenexchangetheintensityof

life in an urban center for the rural quiet of farm life, or vice

versa. Such a relocation can occur several times in a halings

life, and someone moves at least once per tenday in any sizable

community. When a haling moves, all his possessions are left

behindfurniture, food, clothing, and even his job. All the

neighbors pitch in to throw a special kind of going-away party,

wherein everyone helps clean up the property to get it ready for

the next tenants. The house does not stay empty for long, because

whenever a hin family moves away, another soon arrives.

At any given time, a certain percentage of the abodes in any

locale are vacant and waiting for new occupants. Families visiting

a town for the rsttimemightspendadayortwocheckingout

the vacancies before deciding which place (and furniture, and

clothing, and job) are right for them. Outsiders ndthisbehavior

more than a little odd, but to the hin, its as natural as a rainbow

after rain.

Economy

Most of Luirens economy is based on agriculture. The hin export

raw foodstussuchasgrains,vegetables,andcitrusfruits,plus

prepared foods such as cheese, brewed beverages, and baked goods

(particularly pastries). They also oerafewhandcrafteditems,such

as carved wood and redpotterygoods.Afewfarmsalsospecialize

in livestock, so wool and hides are exported in small quantities.

The halingsdoasubstantialamountoftradewiththegold

dwarves of the Great Rift, exchanging their surplus foodstus

for precious metals. Most of their remaining trade goods travel

to market by ship, but few halings have the temperament for

sea travel, so they rely on merchants from other lands (primarily

Durpar) to handle such trade for them. Because of this frequent

business contact, certain inns and taverns in the coastal cities of

Luiren, where the human merchant ships dock, oerhuman-size

accommodations.

The remaining goods are taken overland by caravan to

Dambrath. Great care is used on such trips because the halings

know their Crinti neighbors (and their long history of aggressive

invasion) quite well. For that reason alone, the halingschooseto

conduct their negotiations with merchants in Dunfeld traveling

deeper into Dambrathan territory. Other caravans travel the road

between Luiren and Estagund, though this route isnt a main

trading path, since moving the goods by ship is usually easier,

faster, and less dangerous.

The hin do not mint their own coins, since they have no need

for them except to trade with outsiders. Inland, most hin feel no

need for money, instead using a barter system to trade with one

another when the need arises. Halingswhodonothavecause

to visit the coast or the border regions of Luiren can go months

or years without seeing a minted coin. What little coinage does

146

Luiren

move through the coastal trading cities comes from other nations,

primarily Dambrath and Durpar.

Thus far, the hin have adamantly refused to allow the Red

Wizards of Thay to proliferate in their homeland. To date, the

Thayans have inquired several times about the possibility of estab-

lishing an enclave in Beluir, and each time, the mayorwith the

solid backing of both the citizens and the leaders of the clergyhas

steadfastly refused. The hin feel that no good can come from

allowing the wretched Red Wizards to get a toehold in Luiren,

and their attitudes arent likely to change anytime soon.

Law and Order

The hin of Luiren have few laws and many customs. Strictly

limiting the actions of a people who are whimsical and mis-

chievous by natureand who acknowledge an avowed rascal in

their pantheonwould be a nigh-impossible task. Nonetheless,

the halingsmanagetoregulatethemselvesenoughtoprevent

most serious oenses against society. When a native of Luiren

commits a minor oense, the miscreant usually just receives a

good talking-to and an admonition to straighten up and yright

from an older, wiser haling.Whenanoutsiderstirsuptrouble,

the halings often nd creative ways to turn the crime back on

the criminal. For example, a con artist might ndhimselfduped

into losing his own coin as well as what he gained through his

cheating ways, or a thief might wake up to discover that hes been

moved in the middle of the nightminus his belongingsto

the middle of nowhere.

The halingsrecognizethatthereareafewtrulybadapplesin

every barrel, and that if left unchecked, an exceptionally villainous

individual can cause quite a mess. When such a situation occurs,

the hin call on a local marchwarden (see Defense and Warcraft,

below) to administer justice. Though halings are generally

jovial and prone to forgiving slights, they can deal with serious

threats quite rmly, as evidenced by the Ghostwars. When hin

law catches up to a murderer, he shouldnt expect much more

than a quick execution.

In any rural community in Luiren, two rather informal councils

of village elders handle most of the governing. The menfolk as-

semble on the front stoop of the largest communal building (usually

a taproom or general store), and the womenfolk gather around

the baking table inside. These two groups discuss the situations

facing the community and decide on the proper way to handle any

problems. Usually, the most respected and/or prominent citizen in

the community presides over the dual meeting as mayor or wise

woman, though occasionally a marchwarden assumes the role of

leader. This individual listens to all arguments and counterargu-

ments and, if the gathering cannot come to a consensus, hands

down a decision for dealing with the situation at hand.

In Luirens urban centers, the governing body is more formal.

During each of the ve seasonal holidays, anyone who wishes

a voice in the government comes to the central square (or the

marketplace or the green in front of the mayors oce) to par-

ticipate in discussions on the issues that concern the community.

These debates address all pertinent topics, including whether or

not the current mayor is handling the situation well enough to

continue serving. More often than not, unless a real crisis occurs

or the current mayor has decided to uproot and move to a new

place for a while, that part of the discussion lasts only a few

moments and consists of a few toasts, some good-natured jokes

at the mayors expense, and a quick verbal vote before the real

celebrations begin. Should a change of leadership be in order, the

citizens might spend an hour or two hearing various prominent

citizens speak before a vote is called. At that point, whichever

hin is elected takes over management of the town or city.

The mayor is responsible for the citys day-to-day public

operations, but he usually delegates such tasks to other halings

who he knows can get the job done. A halingsettlementoften

collects a minimal tax to help defray the costs of running the

city, but the tax rates are usually very low. The marchwardens,

with the aid of a few volunteer city guards, deal with any trouble

that erupts, whether caused by halingsoroutsiders.Fewhumans

who have spent a night or two in a haling-sizedprisoncellare

eager to do so again.

Defense and Warcraft

Along the boundaries of the nationmost specicallyattheedges

of the forestsa loosely organized group of halingprotectors

known as marchwardens is constantly on the lookout for threats.

The marchwardens are volunteers who understand the need to be

vigilant and have the necessary skills to handle trouble. The rest of

the population genuinely appreciates the marchwardens, recognizing

them as Luirens rst line of defense against enemies.

For such a small people, the hin are surprisingly ferocious

when it comes to defending their homes and land. They do not

make a habit of going to war, but they are perfectly capable

of rising up and organizing a defense against other nations or

monsters that arrive with conquest on their minds. Marchwar-

dens are quite eectiveatmotivatingandguidingmilitiaforces

of halings against larger opponents, and many an invading

army has discovered that such a force is good at guerrilla tactics,

especially in regions heavy with wooded thickets. Since almost

every side of Luiren is screened by forest, such tactics almost

invariably work to the halings advantage.

Defense of the coast is a bit trickier for the halingsofLuiren.

Only a few of the Small Folk are truly comfortable on the ocean,

so hin warships are few. Instead, the folk of Luiren nd honest,

trustworthy human corsairs and oer them a regular cut of

trade protsinexchangeforpatrollingthecoastline.Thosefew

halingswhodotaketotheseaoftensailwiththisindependent

navy. Though halingsmightseemsillyandightytomembers

of other races, they are good judges of character and have little

trouble distinguishing trustworthy sea captains from those who

would try to take advantage of them.

Religion

As a rule, halings prefer to venerate the entire hin pantheon,

recognizing the value that each deity brings to the overall religious

experience. The stronghearts and lightfoots of Luiren, however,

often choose to favor some deities over others. Arvoreen has

the most ardent following, since the natives of Luiren nd the

tenets of the Vigilant Guardian most in keeping with their line

of thinking about how to protect their land. Many clerics of the

Wary Sword serve in positions of political power, as mayors or

even marchwardens.

147

Luiren

After Arvoreen, Yondalla is the most popular deity among

Luiren folk. The halings view her focus on home and security

as wise and useful, and they welcome her notions of tradition. In

addition, a sizable faction of hinespecially druids and rangers

who live on the fringes of civilizationchoose to venerate

Sheela Peryroyl.

Most of the settled halings who have remained in Luiren

are curious, if not troubled, by the teachings of Cyrollalee the

Hearthkeeper, who urges her followers to earn the respect of

other peoples by establishing a hin nation. After all, Luiren is

already such a nation, and its citizens do not understand why the

goddess would suggest otherwise. While few hin go out of their

way to discredit such views, they believe that this concept bears

careful watching.

Although every halingoersupsomelightheartedrespectto

Brandobaris, few who live in Luiren truly venerate the trickster

deity. All hin understand that Brandobariss outlook and antics

reectapartoftheirnature,buttheolderandwiserindividuals

also understand the limitations of such behavior. Nonetheless,

every haling knows by heart the legend of how Brandobaris

helped the halingsfoundLuireninthedawningdaysofFaern,

and almost every hin oers an occasional prayer of thanks to

him for granting the race its clever and cunning nature.

Adventurers

The hin certainly do not object to the presence of adventurers

in their lands, and in fact, their tradition of hospitality demands

that they welcome such visitors, as long as they dont cause any

trouble. The hin tend to be a little more cautious about wizards

and sorcerers than they are about other adventurers, since prox-

imity to Halruaa and Durpar has made the halings wary of

powerful arcane spellcasters who use magic excessively. Likewise,

priests of dangerous or evil deities are unwelcome inside Luirens

borders, but other clerics are permitted to visit, so long as they

do not attempt to proselytize to the locals.

The hin know that most out-of-towners come to Luiren not

to see them, but to explore the dangerous places along the fringes

of civilization. This suits the halingsjustne,sinceadventurers

usually return from their quests with coin to spend on goods and

services, and they might actually defeat a dangerous monster or

two along the way. The halingsgladlylettheadventurerskeep

half of everything valuable that they bring back from the depths

of the forests, swamps, and mountains.

Politics and Power

In Luiren, the hin live in a sort of benevolent anarchy, since

no actual law-establishing body other than the clergy exists.

The eldest and wisest of the citizens in any given community

enforce a level of control over the rest, but the hin accept this

rulership more out of respect for the wisdom of their elders

than through any real fear that disobedience could bring civil

collapse. Beyond the local mayor and the village council, the hin

informally recognize two other political powers within Luiren:

the temple clergy and the marchwardens.

148

Many priests of the various haling deities nd themselves

functioning as the spiritual and secular leaders of communities.

At the very least, other hin come to the clergy for advice, for

aid in settling disagreements, and for divine healing in times

of sickness or injury. Clerics of the faith not burdened with any

sort of formal leadership roles usually travel the land to teach,

protect their ocks,andredresswrongdoings.Thus,thoughthey

are not formally recognized as a ruling body of Luiren, haling

clerics do hold appreciable inuence in hin society.

The marchwardens also wield considerable power, functioning

as the protectors, defenders, and perhaps even the vigilantes of

Luiren and its people. They generally operate outside of any other

ruling structure but cooperate fully with mayors and village

councils. The marchwardens meet from time to timeoften

by chance but occasionally intentionallyto discuss persistent

problems, threats, and progress in dealing with such. They have no

real hierarchy among themselves, but they generally acknowledge

the more experienced of their number as leaders during gatherings.

Though disputes between marchwardens are not unheard of, they

are quite rarethere is no room for pride or disagreement when

the well-being of the country is at stake.

History of Luiren

In the earliest centuries, three tribes of the Small Folk roamed

the great Lluirwood as woodland nomads. After the Ghostwars,

the Strongheart Tribe and a few members of the Lightfoot Tribe

stayed in the area and settled down, clearing the land for farming

and establishing contact with other nations. From that point on,

the history of the halingswasaquietone,interruptedfromtime

to time by the invasions and depredations of humans and human-

oids who wanted Luiren and its resources for themselves.

Kaldair and Vaprak

The Legend of Luirens Founding

Before the fall of Myth Drannor, when the Lluirwood

covered the whole of the land that is now Luiren and Es-

tagund, the Small Folk came to Faern. At rst, they lived

on the coast of the Luirenstrand, while the ogres ruled the

woods. These cruel, terrible creatures tormented the Small

Folk constantly, and they prayed for deliverance. One day,

a haling named Kaldair Swiftfoot came upon the avatar

of the ogre deity, Vaprak the Destroyer. The haling began

to tease Vaprak and nally challenged the avatar to catch

him if he could. In a rage, Vaprak chased the haling for

ten days and nights, but he could never succeed in grabbing

the irksome creature.

Finally, Vaprak collapsed in exhaustion, and Kaldair ap-

proached him. You cannot defeat me in a battle of agility, and

I do not think you can beat me in a test of strength, he said.

Vaprak growled at the insult and quickly agreed to the test.

Lets see which of us can pull a tree out of the ground

without ripping its roots apart, Kaldair suggested. If you

win, the hin will retreat to the mountains north of the forest,

and the ogres may have the woodlands all to themselves. But

if I win, all the ogres must live in the mountains, leaving the

forest to the Small Folk.

Vaprak agreed and immediately grasped the nearest tree. He

yanked it easily from the ground, but many of its roots tore.

The ogre deitys avatar tried again, but again, he succeeded only

in damaging the tree.

Finally, after Vaprak had tried and failed with many great

trees, Kaldair took his turn. He walked up to the tiniest sapling

and very carefully removed it, pulling its lone taproot from

the ground with harming it in the least.

Vaprak trembled and roared with rage, but he knew that he

had been beaten. At that moment, Kaldair revealed his true

identityBrandobaris the Trickster.

You cannot best me in a test of agility, nor can you win in

a contest of wits, it would seem, the hin deity taunted. Now

you and your kind must leave the woods for the mountains

and never bother the Small Folk again.

Vaprak raged and stomped and tore up more trees, but he

had been beaten fair and square. So he gathered his ogre people

and took them into the Toadsquat Mountains, where they live

to this day.

And that is how Brandobaris won the kingdom of Luiren

for the halings.

Year of Rogue Dragons (current year).

Government

Luiren has no central government, since the halings prefer

cooperative self-regulation. The only communal governments are

the village and town councils in the rural regions, and mayors

who serve more as organizers than as true rulers in the urban

centers. The priests of the hin temples hold a great deal of

inuenceovermanyaspectsofsociety,andthemarchwardens

identify and deal with threats against Luiren and its people.

No government beyond those groups is recognized, and the

halings manage to remain happy and civilized without any

additional oversight.

Enemies

Though Luiren has little in the way of valuable resources other

than the produce from its farms, it has been the focus of enmity

from other races and countries surprisingly often. The halings

keep to themselves and dont trouble anyone who isnt interested

in trading with them, yet invasions both explicit and subtle have

plagued them throughout their history.

Dambrath

Though Dambrath and Luiren are currently at peace, they

maintain that state only because at present, trade is more lucra-

tive than war. Luirens western neighbor has such a long history

of aggression against the halings that the Small Folk never

let down their guard anymore. From the raids by the human

barbarians in early days to the more recent incursions by the

Crinti, the Dambrathans have demonstrated time and time again

that they are untrustworthy. The hin dont understand why they

should merit such malevolence, but theyve learned the hard way

not to be fooled; they fully expect another attack from the west

in the near future.

Toadsquat Ogres

A long-standing enmity exists between the sour-tempered ogres

living in the mountains to the north and the halings in the

woods and plains below. Since the founding of Luiren, the two

races have squabbled over territory, and the disputes are not likely

to be settled anytime soon. The ogres used to swarm down out

of the foothills and into the haling villages on a regular basis,

but in recent centuries, they have found the Small Folk to be

more formidable foes, thanks in large part to the tireless eorts

of the marchwardens.

Yuan-Ti

The fact that the halings dont even know the yuan-ti are

their enemies makes these creatures the most formidable of all

Luirens foes. The serpentfolk have opened a two-way portal that

connects Ssyintiasaminass, one of their cities in the depths of

the Black Jungles, with the center of the Southern Lluirwood.

They use this magical pathway to travel to the woods, snatch up

lone halings who stray too far into the forest, and transport

them back to Ssyintiasaminass for experimentation. The yuan-

ti are attempting to create a new slave race, and they believe

that the halings might be a key component in their success.

The marchwardens who patrol the target area have known for

a very long time that dangerous creatures creep around in the

Southern Lluirwood, but they do not know the specic nature

of the threats. Thus far, they have simply been warning any and

all hin to steer clear of these woods.

150

Luiren

Cities and Sites

As might be expected in a city where the people are half the size

of humans, just about everything in a hin community is built

to a smaller scale. The Big Folk might ndafewbusinessesthat

cater to creatures their size, but for the most part, those who visit

Luiren feel like overgrown giants in a childs world.

Most of the hin communities of any appreciable size are

located along the coast, where the thriving trade allows halings

and visitors to intermingle easily. In every coastal city, businesses

along the waterfront (particularly inns, taverns, and hostels) can

handle guests of either human or halingsize,andtheBigFolk

tend to feel more welcome here. Farther inland, though, the

lodgings quickly shrink to better accommodate the natives.

Beluir (Metropolis)

Most of the folk who live beyond Luirens borders consider

Beluir its capital city. In truth, however, the hin do not have

a capital at all, since they have very little in the way of

established government, and certainly none to speak of on a

national level. Still, Beluir is the largest city on Luiren soil,

and it houses the biggest temple dedicated to Yondalla, so its

as good a place as any for outsiders to come seeking audience

with important personages.

In keeping with their hospitable nature, the hin have designated

one section of the city to accommodate diplomats and emissaries

from other nations. A few human-sized homes in a particularly

wide-open neighborhood go a long way toward oeringcomfort

to foreign dignitaries.

In addition, many merchant ships put in at Beluir on a regular

basis to acquire Luiren trade goods for sale elsewhere. Thus, the

businesses along the waterfront cater to all sizes and tastes.

Calcitro Burrow (NG male strongheart haling ghter 8)

serves as the mayor of Beluir. The Burrow family is actually quite

wealthy, and its members own a large fruit grove just a few miles

beyond the city limits, as well as a number of ne taverns in

town. Calcitro is something of a legend in the community. In his

earlier years, he was a renowned adventurer who supposedly slew

two raiding hill giants single-handedly. In fact, his opponents were

drunken ogres, but whenever the tale is told, the truth stretches

a bit more.

Major Temples

Gringa Thistlehair (LG female strongheart haling cleric 10 of

Yondalla), the Devout Voice of Yondalla, presides over Yondallas

templethe largest one in the city. Gringa is fervent in both her

faith and her eorts to better the lives of everyone in Beluir.

Though she is privately troubled by Cyrrollalees recent urgings

for the hin to ndahomeland,shekeepsherconcernstoherself

and preaches that tolerance of outsiders will lead to respect for the

hin. Gringas other preoccupation at the moment is the number

of disappearances in and around the Southern Lluirwood. She

has discreetly approached a number of dierent adventuring

groups, hoping she can ndsomeonetoinvestigate,butthusfar,

she has learned nothing.

Notable Businesses

A tavern and inn known as the Cold Duck, situated near the

waterfront, caters to Big Folk as well as hin locals. The mayor of

Beluir owns the place, though he rarely appears there, preferring

to leave the day-to-day operations to his niece, Cullada Burrow

(NG female haling expert 6). The Cold Duck is famous for its

deviled spice-and-salmon duck eggs, a delicacy known throughout

the southern coast and the inspiration for the taverns name.

Erdel Talltufts (NG male strongheart haling rogue 7) runs

Erdels Extraordinary Equipment Emporium, a shop catering

to outsiders who have come to Beluir intending to travel into its

interior. Erdel sells just about anything an adventurer might want

or need (everything on the Simple Weapons, Martial Weapons,

Armor and Shields, Adventuring Gear, Tools and Skill Kits, and

Clothing tables in Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook), all at

standard costs. What most folk in Beluir dont realize is that

Erdel also heads up a small and rather informal thieves guild

composed primarily of young boys and girls. He has trained the

members of this guild to sneak aboard the various ships that come

into the harbor and carry o a few items of valuable cargo.

The rest of Beluirs citizens are too numerous to describe

here.

Chethel (Large City)

The city of Chethel lies a little way down the coast from Beluir,

on the north side of the Mortik Swamp. With a population of

slightly more than 14,500 people, Chethel is somewhat smaller

and more quaint than the metropolis to the north. Chethel is

known primarily for its wonderful hin shipyards, where the

halingshappilyconstructsomeofthemostseaworthyvessels

aroundthough few of them actually sail aboard their craft.

About 1,500 of Chethels inhabitants are elves and half-elves.

They have established their own neighborhood, known as the

Long Quarter, where most of them reside in homes and shop at

businesses suited to their stature and tastes, but they get along

well with the haling population in the rest of the city. Perhaps

because of the stable inuenceoftheelfneighborhood,many

hin have chosen to settle permanently in Chethel rather than

move around, as their brethren in other parts of Luiren are

wont to do.

Most of the outsiders who visit Chethel are merchants seeking

trade opportunities or repairs for their ships, though adventurers

151

Luiren

and explorers often stop here on their way to investigate the

swamp. A small area near the docks houses a handful of businesses

that cater to such brave folk, but the hin do not really expect

repeat business, since the swamp claims plenty of adventurers

lives. In fact, some residents favor passing laws to prohibit anyone

from entering Mortik, simply because those who go in tend to

make the Bog King angry, and he and his minions take out their

frustrations on Chethel. Because of this danger, Chethels walls

are high and stout, even by human standards.

Crimel (Village)

The village of Crimel is nestled up against the Lluirwood about

60 miles west of Beluir. Only about 500 hin dwell here in the

shadow of the great forest. Many of these residents cut lumber

from the forest under the watchful gaze of a druid and work the

wood into usable and well-crafted items for sale in the markets

of Beluir. Others provide food for the populace by farming the

land or keeping herds of cattle or sheep in the open pastures

surrounding the village. All in all, the hin who live in Crimel

ndlifetheresimplebutrewarding.Evenwiththerisksinherent

in living so close to the forest, the people of Crimel wouldnt

trade the sense of community and friendship they all share just

to move to safer environs.

Because of its proximity to the Lluirwood, Crimel has been

the target of numerous monster attacks over the decades. As a

result, the local temple has made certain that the community is

prepared for any sort of danger. A sizable group of marchwardens

lives in the village and patrols the forest around it, particularly

the area where logging occurs.

Notable Businesses

Near the center of the village green is the Tumbling Troll, a

popular tavern where the locals can meet and carouse with their

friends and hear the latest news and gossip from travelers passing

through. In addition, the village elders gather here on a regular

basis to discuss developing events around Crimel. The Tumbling

Troll has a couple of rooms that visitors can rent (one of which

is human-sized), but its primary business is the taproom. The

human-sized room has been rented for the last several months

by a human called Malric Fodemun (LN male human cleric 5

of Bane), who claims to be a retired mercenary looking for a

quiet place to live out his remaining years. In reality, he wronged

a superior while serving the temple of Bane in Westgate on the

Dragon Coast, found out about his error before his head was

taken, and ed. Malric Fodemun is an assumed name.

On the opposite side of the green from the Tumbling Troll

is Portly Pands Provisions, a general store that oers basic

tools, supplies, and hardware for the loggers and farmers in the

village. Pand Roundnose (NG male lightfoot haling expert 9)

is as skinny as they come, but he found the misnomer of his

store most humorous and kept it. A warm and compassionate

fellow, he constantly extends credit to the locals when they need

to barter. He doesnt supply much in the way of adventuring

equipmentin fact, the only weapon hes ever purchased for the

store is a mundane short sword that still hangs on the wall by

the door, over his checkout desk.

Major Temples

The rst center of worship in Crimel is the Temple of Yondalla

on the northwest side of town. This building is actually the home

of Hubin Sharpears (LG male strongheart haling cleric 6 of

Yondalla), the Revered Nurturer of the temple in the village.

Hubin has been trying to convince the folk of Crimel that they

need a proper shrine to Yondalla, and numerous discussions at

the elders meetings of late have included this topic.

In the woods just north of town, a small shrine dedicated to

Sheela Peryroyl has been built into the hillside. Nola Treestump

(NG female strongheart haling ranger 5/druid 8) tends the

shrine and occasionally enters the village to see if anyone needs

her care, but she spends most of her time out in the forest,

working with the local marchwardens to fend o threatening

creatures. Nola is the druid who visits the loggers at least once

per tenday to discuss which trees to cut and which ones to leave

standing in order to best preserve and regrow the forest.

Mayors House

Silvo Carver (NG male strongheart haling aristocrat 2/expert

4) is the mayor of Crimel and its wealthiest individual. He dwells

in one of the few homes in the village thats an actual building,

as opposed to a burrow hole. Silvo owns a large farm on the

outskirts of the village, and everyone says his livestock is the

largest and healthiest for miles around. In addition to selling fresh

dairy products in Beluir, he also sells some of his livestock each

year, often to other farmers in the area. Silvo moved to Crimel

about fteenyearsagoandjusthappenedtoarriveshortlyafter

the former mayor had decided to relocate. Silvo simply settled

into the vacant house and the job, and no one has seen reason

to vote him out since.

152

Luiren

Krenalir (Large Town)

Krenalir sits on the opposite side of the Mortik Swamp from

Chethel, its sister city. Although Krenalirs docks are more than

adequate to accommodate all the trade necessary to keep its populace

comfortable and happy, most merchant ships choose to tie up to

the wharves at Chethel or Beluir instead, since those cities oer

better accommodations for outsiders. However, quite a bit of caravan

traccomesaroundtheswamptoKrenalir,despitethedangers.

With a population of about 4,800 peoplealmost all of

them halingsKrenalir is really just a cozy little community.

Its main assets are the miles and miles of citrus orchards that

stretch away eastward on the Krenalir Peninsula. At harvest time,

ships line up three deep in the harbor, each waiting its turn to

dock and take on a load of the precious fruit. During this time,

Krenalirs population swells to almost half again its normal size.

Afterward, when the rainy season starts, many Krenalir natives

head north to other parts of the country in search of better

weather, turning the city into a virtual ghost town until spring,

when the trees need tending again.

Krenalirs mayor, Hudkin Madhair (LN male strongheart

haling aristocrat 3/ghter 1), is a former wanderer who hated

life on the road and couldnt wait to get back home. As a result,

he despises adventurers and makes every eorttokeepKrenalir

as inhospitable to them as possible. He has managed to establish

regulations that prevent the towns businesses from oeringhuman-

sized accommodations or selling human-sized equipment. Such

eortshaventreallystoppedadventurersfromcoming,butthey

have made it dicultforthecitytoenticemoretrade.Duringthe

past few elections, Hudkin has remained in ocebyonlya narrow

margin, and its likely only a matter of time before the townsfolk

get tired enough of his anti-adventurer stance to vote him out.

Shoun (Small City)

On the eastern coast of Luiren, the city of Shoun (population

7,487) sits on a jut of land that sticks out into the Luirenstrand

and forms the bays northern boundary. Shoun is the last major

community along the trade route to Estagund before the trail

enters the wild region where the Lluirwood meets the coast.

Thus, the town receives the initial caravan trac on the land

route out of the Golden Water region. It is also frequently the

rst stop for ships arriving from other ports, before they travel

farther into the Luirenstrand.

Shoun is well known for two major exportsbaked goods and

dairy products. The pastureland around it is lledwithherdsof

cattle and goats, and the farmers who raise them bring cheese

and butter into the city to sell. Many Shoun bakers have literally

made their fortunes using those dairy ingredients to create a wide

variety of consumables in their ovens, from cheese breads to delicate

dessert pastries. Merchants make a point of stopping in Shoun to

purchase some of both commodities, usually on their way back out

of Luiren, so that they can ensure that the goods are as fresh as

possible when they arrive at their next ports of call.

Melino Smalltoes (LN male strongheart haling aristocrat

7/rogue 8) is the mayor of Shoun and has been for nearly 70 years.

He also happens to be the wealthiest hin in the entire city and for

a days walk in any direction around it, since he owns numerous

153

Luiren

dairies in the eldsoutsidethetownandanumberofbusinesses

in Shoun. Because of his accumulation of wealth, many in the

community have begun referring to him as Richtoes, but only

in a lighthearted way, for he is well loved by the community.

Perhaps two decades ago, Melino couldnt be bothered with

integrity and forthrightness in his oce,andcorruptionwashigh

in Shoun. The rest of the city got frustrated with his backroom

politics, and he nearly lost his mayoral seat to a rival. Somewhere

along the way, though, he found religion and discovered that

Shoun (and by extension, its mayor) could actually prosper more

if he cleaned up the corruption and ran the city fairly. His plan

worked, and though he had to deal with some of his former

business partners who were none too happy about his change of

heart, the citizens of Shoun have been grateful ever since.

Thruldar

Thruldar was once the last outpost city of Estagund along the

trade route into Luiren. In the Year of the Shattered Altar

(1264 DR), a human druid named Voolad Espiral led a surprise

attack on Thruldar with the support of some of the monster

chieftains of Veldorn. The druid commanded a small army of

dark trees and other dangerous plant creatures, and he managed

to take the city completely by surprise. Thruldar was razed and

most of its inhabitants slain.

In the nearby forest, several tribes of ghostwise halingstook

notice of the dark magic emanating from Thruldar and went

to investigate. Upon discovering what had occurred there, the

tribes organized a second surprise attack and managed to slay

the druid. But the powerful evil that had given the druid purpose

would not accept the defeat of its servant, and Voolad soon rose

up as a ghost. The hin managed to seal the druids ghost and

his fell minions inside the city by placing powerful spells on the

walls. This solution meant that much of the citys wealth had to

be sealed away, too, and it remains there still. Knowing that the

druid and his dark trees are locked inside the city, the halings

make a point of keeping an eye on the place, hoping to discourage

would-be adventurers from entering the ruined city and possibly

releasing the evil inside.

Heroes and Monsters

Characters originating from Luiren are almost certainly hal-

ings, whether stronghearts (the most prominent), lightfoots,

or ghostwise. An elf or half-elf character could hail from the

appropriate neighborhood of Chethel, or a human could come

from a family that chose to settle down in one of the hin cities

a generation or two ago. Other races are practically nonexistent

as natives of Luiren, though extraordinary circumstances might

result in such a heritage.

The appropriate prestige classes for characters native to Luiren

include the hin standtheLuirenmarchwarden,andtoalesser

extent, the Great Sea corsair.

Monsters in the region include dark trees and tall mouthers

(both described in Chapter 5), plus beholders of various types,

ogres, yuan-ti, and a wide variety of woodland creatures.

T o folk from other parts of Faern, the Shaar seems

to be a vast expanse of nothingness that presents an

unfortunate obstacle to trade among other lands.

The ercebarbaricnomadsanddangerousbeaststhatroamits

grassy plains appear to spend all their time attacking caravans

and ghtingoverpreciouswater.Indeed,manyfeelthateveryone

would be better o if the Shaar just disappeared.

But this immense sea of gently rolling hills is far more

diversied and wondrous than most people understand. The

Shaar is a land of hardship and erce people, certainly, but it

also oers a bounty of unusual cultures, varied resources, and

trade opportunities found nowhere else.

Geographic Overview

The Shaar is an almost endless stretch of grassy plains that

measures more than 1,500 miles from east to west and aver-

ages about 250 miles from north to south. Its western end

touches the very tip of the Shining Sea, and its eastern end

butts up against Veldorn, the Land of Monsters. It is bisected

by two signicant geographical features: a cli face called the

Landrise, and the Great Rift, a gouge in the earth more than

200 miles long and half that wide. Folk usually refer to the

area west of the Landrise as the Shaar, and the area east of it

as The Eastern Shaar.

The Firesteap Mountains, a portion of the Chondalwood, the

Uthangol Mountains, and the far southern border of Mulhorand

all serve as borders along the north side of the Shaar. Similarly,

the Channath Vale (a series of woods and mountains along the

length of the River Channath), the Forest of Amtar, and the

Toadsquat Mountains mark its southern boundary. A number

of isolated woodlands and a couple of small collections of hills

dot the otherwise featureless plain, and several shallow rivers

and streams cross it, though these waterways tend to become

sandy-bottomed gullies during the dry season.

While not truly a desert, the Shaar does not receive much

rainfall, and little other than coarse grass, cactus, and thorny

bushes grows on its surface. The days are blisteringly hot and the

155

nights uncomfortably cold. Both geographically and meteorologi-

cally, the Shaar is a land of extremes.

Major Geographic

Features

The sea of grass that makes up most of the Shaar is not as at

as outsiders claim, though compared to other parts of Faern, it

might as well be. The forests, mountains, and rivers oer land-

marks by which to navigate the open stretches, but the ground

in between appears to be just an endless surface of atearthto

those who are not traversing it.

The plains gently undulate, and the countrys entire length

slopes at an almost imperceptible angle from east to west. In fact,

the whole of the Shaar drains into the Sea of Fallen Stars far to

the north and the Shining Sea to the west. The mountain ranges

at the southern end of the Shaar form a continental divide, even

though the Great Sea to the south is closer to much of the land.

Throughout the Shaars length, the grasslands are dotted with

localized variations on the terrain. In some places, sand dunes

interrupt the at horizon, while in others, small valleys gather

enough rainwater to form ponds, supporting a relative abundance

of plant life that attracts grazing animals and birds.

Nomadic human tribes have roamed the Shaar since recorded

history began, but little in the way of civilization exists here.

From time to time, other powers have assumed authority over

certain regions of these grasslands and even built settlements

to manage trade, but only the crumbling remnants of their

eorts remain.

Humans are not the only nomadic creatures living on the

plains. Wemics, centaurs, thri-kreen, and loxo also roam the Shaar,

The Shaar and the Great Rift

156

The Shaar and the Great Rift

157

hunting the great herd animals for food and constantly squabbling

over water rights. From time to time, gnolls, perytons, manticores,

wyverns, and dragons challenge the nomads for supremacy of

the area.

Azulduth, the Lake of Salt

In the southeast reaches of Mulhorand lies the Lake of Salt, a

shallow, highly salinated body of water drained by the River of

Swords. During the hot season, signicantportionsofAzulduth

dry up to form salt ats for months at a time. By a quirk in the

ancient treaty between Mulhorand and Unther, the Lake of Salt

was claimed by neither empire. Even today, despite the fact that

Mulhorand now rules much of Unther, the Old Empires display

little formal interest in Azulduth. However, numerous powerful

wizards and other Mulan have come south to investigate the

Lake of Salt, particularly the ruins scattered about its shores.

Evidence suggests that most of these ancient stones are the

remains of a civilization built by a sauroid race race more than

thirty thousand years ago.

Today, a couple of small communities sit on the shores of the

lake (or on the edges of the salt ats, during the dry season).

The citizens of Azun and Buldamar make their livings mining

the salt and shing the lake. When caravans moving between

the Golden Water and Council Hills pass their way, they barter

whatever sh and salt they havent consumed for other trade

goods. From time to time, adventurers come to explore the ruins,

causing the local economy to pick up slightly.

Besides the sh that live in the lake, Azulduth is home to a

wide variety of crocodiles and snakes, whose presence makes the

already harsh environment even more dangerous. Indeed, the

reptile population around the lake has increased signicantlyin

recent years, leading some to speculate that perhaps the ancient

sauroid empire is on the rise again. Certainly, most locals point to

the belief that more ruins lie beneath the surface of the lake as

evidence of their theories. (For more information on Azulduth,

see Serpent Kingdoms.)

The Channath Vale

The Channath Vale is a narrow stretch of land along the southern

side of the Shaar, where the River Channath owswestintothe

River Talar. The North Wall of Halruaa and the Bandit Wastes

form its southern boundary, while the Shaar anksitonthenorth.

The vale consists of three separate woodlands (the Channathwood,

the Misty Vale, and the Shaareach Forest), as well as the Dun

Hills and the tiny range of mountains known as the Wyrmbones.

A major caravan route follows the south side of the vale, con-

necting the Great Rift with lands west of the Shaar. Several

communities have arisen in Channath Vale along this trade way,

and their citizens reap the benets of caravan trac.

The Channathwood

The Channathwood is a region of steamy jungle nestled against

the southern slopes of the Rathgaunt Hills, where the headwaters

of the River Channath cascade into and through the woods. This

hot, stiing thicket is not terribly large, but its thick, overgrown

interior is home to a tribe of ghostwise halings.Thesereclusive

hin keep to themselves most of the time, but they occasionally

appear along the edges of the forest to trade with the human

farmers who live on the outskirts of Channathgate. Such peaceful

contact does not mean that friendly relations exist between the

two peoples. Humans may gather herbs and berries on the edges

of the forest without peril, but the halings brook no deeper

invasion of their woodland home. The ghostwise tribe actively

discourages such incursions through the use of deadfalls, snares,

and even a few warning shots from slings or bows.

The Dun Hills

This low stretch of hills shelters the Misty Vale from the coastal

lands of Lapaliiya along the Shining Sea. The western slopes

support scattered groves of olive trees, but little other vegeta-

tion grows there. Small herds of goats, some shepherded by local

tribes, wander the region, feasting on scrub growth. The central

hills hide many Lapaliiyan tombs, and wise travelers avoid the

undead that continue to plague the area despite the eorts of

Kelemvors priesthood to clean it up. The mist-shrouded eastern

slopes of the Dun Hills are covered with trees, making them

nearly as impenetrable as the Misty Vale itself, though the wild

elves who claim that forest do not venture so far west.

The Misty Vale

The Misty Vale is a largely unexplored, thickly overgrown,

stiingly hot jungle tucked between the Dun Hills and the

Wyrmbones. The River Channath ows through the center of

the woodland, becoming sluggish where tangles of creepers and

vines dangle down into its waters. The river teems with sh,and

the occasional crocodile, snake, and more unusual jungle aquatic

creature also call its waters home. In the canopy overhead, count-

less birds with colorful plumage cry out, their voices echoing

through the deep green.

In the courts of the High Suihk of Ormpur and the Overk-

ing of Lapaliiya, records dating back to the foundings of both

realms speak of a race of feral elves native to the steaming jungle.

According to these documents, the elves were so xenophobic that

they made a practice of hunting down and killing any intruders

in their ancient homeland.

The descendents of the wild elves described in those ancient

records still dwell in the same forest today. Their oral tradition

relates how their ancestors betrayed the other wild elves to the

depredations of the drow during the Crown Wars. Afterward, they

were given this section of woodland to call home, though the drow

sorcerers had released numerous dark horrors there. Remorseful

over having betrayed their own kind, the wild elves of the Misty

Vale withdrew into the forest so deeply that no one would ever

see their guilt, vowing to live in isolation forever after. In accord

with that philosophy, they embraced Fenmarel Mestarine, the

Lone Wolf, as their patron deity. Today, their descendants still

adhere to both their ancestors isolationism and the worship of

their deity. They tolerate no intrusion into their forest and slay all

intruders without exception. Though the wild elves have hunted

many of the deadlier monsters in this wood nearly to extinction,

a few terrible creatures still lurk in the deepest shadows of the

Misty Vale.

158

The Shaar and the Great Rift

The Shaareach Forest

This section of stiing, sultry woodland straddles the junction

of the River Shaar and the River Channath at the point where

the two waterways merge to become the River Talar. Like its

companion forests along the Channath Vale, the Shaareach is

overgrown with thick, lush vegetation, making overland travel

slow and dicult.Theconvergingwaterwaysmakeitfareasier

to navigate the interior of the Shaareach by watercraft than

overland, but either route is fraught with dangersin particular,

the packs of digesters that roam the woods and attack anything

that looks edible. Because of the forests proximity to Lake

Lhespen and the Lhespenbog, a number of giant eels, water

spiders, and even a few yuan-ti also prowl the waterways inside

the Shaareach Forest.

Near the center of the woods, where the tributaries converge

to form the Talar, the banks are dotted with numerous ruins, all

half choked and buried beneath the jungle growth. Few adventur-

ers have managed to reach the ruins and explore them, but those

who have found little evidence of their origin.

The Wyrmbones

This small chain of mountains wedged between two forests got

its name from the tribesfolk of the Shaar, who thought the ridges

and peaks resembled a skeletal dragon slumbering on the plain.

Despite the colorful name, the only creatures inhabiting the

mountains in any numbers are gnolls, led by a powerful chieftain

known as the Wyrm Master (CE male gnoll ranger 8). The Wyrm

Master conducts raids on caravans along the trade road between

the Wyrmbones and the Shaareach Forest, but Kormul has yet

to muster the forces necessary to deal with the threat.

Council Hills

Like a lonely island in a sea of grass, this cluster of hills sits

smack in the middle of the Eastern Shaar. The hills would be

utterly unremarkable except for the ruins of an ancient city in

the central valley they enclose. Known as Shandaular during its

heyday, the city rose up around the southern terminus of a two-

way portal that connected with several other points throughout

Faern. After the portal was shut down, the city slowly withered

and faded away as its inhabitants took up the nomadic lifestyle

and began to wander the Eastern Shaar. The nal death knell

for Shandaular occurred during a conict with Unther and

Mulhorand early in the third century DR.

Today, the site of the old city serves as a special gathering

place for all the tribes of the Shaar. Every spring and fall, each

tribe that is not engaged in war with its neighbors sends delegates

to the ruins, where they hold peace talks and drink together,

discussing alliances, hunting territory, and potential threats from

other creatures. The area known as Council Hills is considered

sacred neutral ground because many of the tribes have buried

their ancestral chieftains in caves there. No ghtingispermitted

between nomads while either party stands among these hills. On

numerous occasions, however, tribes have used violence to prevent

enemy tribes from reaching the Council Hills gathering, setting

up a perimeter of warriors to attack their approaching foes.

159

The Shaar and the Great Rift

The Great Rift

The traditional home of Faerns gold dwarves, the wide canyon

known as the Great Rift lies near the western end of the Eastern

Shaar, not far from the Landrise. The bottom of this chasm lies

more than 1,000 feet below the plains, surrounded by sheer cli

walls on every side. The arid, hilly ground that serves as the oor

of the Great Rift is split down the middle by the Riftlake, a deep,

icy-cold body of clear water that is often shrouded in morning

mists. The lake is fed by the numerous small streams and rivers

that ow throughout the Great Rift, as well as some very deep

springs, which rumors suggest are fed by portals from the El-

emental Plane of Water. The lake in turn drains into the River

Shaar, which snakes along the valley oorbeforedisappearing

into a spray-lled gorge on the north end of the canyon. From

there, it winds along a subterranean route more than 150 miles

long before emerging in an impressive waterfall from a cave set

into the side of the Landrise. Despite its high cli walls, the

Great Rift is wide enough that a person standing on the shore of

the Riftlake cant actually see the walls on the other side. Thus,

in many places, the valley oor seems more like open ground

than the oor of a deep canyon.

The weather inside the Great Rift is somewhat wetter than

it is on the surrounding plains, though the ground is far from

damp. The grasses that grow on the valley oorareabitthicker

and greener than the sparse, coarse weeds native to the rest of

the Shaar, and plenty of animalssome herded by the dwarves

for foodgraze on this lush abundance.

The Deep Realm

The Great Rift is but a fraction of the territory controlled by

the gold dwarves, who also inhabit miles of underground caverns,

tunnels, and forticationsconnectedtothesurfaceinandaround

the canyon. Known as the Deep Realm, these hidden regions cover

twice as much area as the canyon alone, mostly to the east and

northeast. The Deep Realm is a place of wonder that features

hanging spiral staircases, waterfalls and cascades operated by

mechanical pumps, glowing, ever-shifting sculptures of magically

radiant metal, and similar marvels.

The Deepwild (Great Bhaerynden)

Beyond the reach and control of the gold dwarves lies a portion of

the Underdark called the Deepwild. Known as Great Bhaerynden

to the rest of the inhabitants of the subterranean realms, the

Deepwild stretches outward beneath the Shaar in all directions,

well beyond the boundaries of the Deep Realm. Included in

this territory is the accursed drow city of Llurth Dreier, where

Ghaunadaur reigns supreme. The Deepwild also encompasses

a series of dragon lairs known as the Wyrmcaves and a huge

underground waterfall called the Deepwall.

Once the ancient home of the dwarves, the city of Bhaerynden

once sat where the Great Rift is today, but deeper beneath the

surface. Millennia ago, when the drow rstdescendedintothe

Underdark, they invaded and conquered Bhaerynden and renamed

it Telantiwar. Some time later, the great caverns that made up

the heart of their new domain collapsed. Billions of tons of earth

and stone came crashing down, crushing a dozen drow cities and

forming the Great Rift on the surface. Though the settlements

in the center of the region were destroyed, the leagues of tunnels

around the periphery of the Great Rift remain intact and in use

by various denizens of the Underdark.

The Landrise

This escarpment divides the grassy plains into two halves and

marks the boundary between the Shaar and the Eastern Shaar.

Along the entire length of the Landrise, the eastern side is any-

where from 200 to 400 feet higher than the western side. The

extended clisarebrokeninseveralplacesalongthelengthofthe

Landrise, allowing travelers to move back and forth between the

two elevations with relative ease. Most of these spots are nothing

more than steep and often treacherous footpaths, but caravan

routes cross the Landrise in several places where broader, more

gently sloping breaches in the clishavebeendiscovered.During

rainstorms, the Landrise sports numerous cascading waterfalls,

but most of the time, little water spills over the cli edges.

The Landrise is more than just a notable landmark. Frequently,

tribes at war with one another attempt to position themselves

on the high side of the clis so that they can watch for their

enemies approach and gain a tactical advantage in battle. Other

tribes consider the Landrise a holy place and bury their dead in

high caves on the faces of the clis, often in spots that appear

completely unreachable. A few bodies have even been laid to

rest on platforms braced by logs protruding from the cli face.

Visitors who have seen these hanging crypts have marveled at

the distances the nomads had to carry the wood and the eort

needed to get the bodies into position. The prevailing wisdom

holds that magic was almost certainly employed to create these

odd tombs.

Lake Lhespen

Though not as salty as Azulduth on the other end of the Shaar,

Lake Lhespen is a mineral-laden body of water with salt-crusted

shores that is unsuitable for most uses. Despite its inhospitable

nature, several small villages and towns have sprouted up along its

shores over the centuries, peopled by hardy souls who manage to

eke out a living by gathering salt or harvesting the few shthat

live in these waters. Nomads who do not wish to pay the higher

prices for salt in Shaarmid to the north frequently come here

to gather their own or trade for it. In addition, the occasional

adventurer, wizard, or sage is attracted to the place by the various

ruins scattered around the periphery of the lakeall remnants of

older civilizations that occupied the Shaar in bygone days.

In recent years, however, the yuan-ti and the creatures in the

bog to the east have made the area around Lake Lhespen more

dangerous than ever (see Lhesper, below). As a result, fewer and

fewer caravans travel the road between Kormul and Shaarmid,

preferring to utilize safer routes.

The Lhespenbog

The Lhespenbog is a region of soft, spongy grassland sprinkled

intermittently with rivulets and ponds. The grasses of the plains

grow incredibly tall here and mix with cattails, mangrove trees,

The Landrise divides the Shaar in half

and creeping vines and moss. Giant eels, darting water spiders, a

few chuul, shocker lizards, and various oozes and slimes dwell in

the Lhespenbog, feeding on one another and on foolish explorers

who wander too deeply into its depths.

This marshy ground is also home to a number of undead. Sages

believe that these creatures might once have been soldierspart

of a rebellion force that was cornered and slaughtered by troops

loyal to the Shoon Imperium during the Seven Burnings campaign

in the fth century DR. Whatever the truth might be, the bog

stirs with strange lights and sounds at night, and those who listen

closely can hear the echoes of old battles being fought.

The Rathgaunt Hills

Wedged between Lake Lhespen and the Lhespenbog on the west

and the Landrise on the east, this stretch of rocky crags dominates

the southern half of the plains of the Shaar. Worn down from

eons of exposure to the relentless winds that scour the region,

these mountains are home to colonies of perytons, wyverns, and

manticores. These creatures y out over the at grasslands to

hunt, making the whole region around the mountains a dangerous

place for the unwary.

The Rathgaunt Hills also support a large settlement of

gnomes. In the heart of Sevenstones Hill, a prominent tor

whose rounded peak overlooks the caravan route to the north

between Shaarmid and Kholtar, these gnomes have established

a heavily fortied abbey known as the Shield of the Rathgaunt

Hills. Manned by the Cult of Gaerdal, which numbers some

200 warriors and priests who venerate Gaerdal Ironhand, the

abbey serves as a bastion of defense. The members of the cult

tirelessly strive to keep the mountains safe for all gnomes in the

area and to keep caravan trac owing.Ledby ShieldGeneral

Martak Ironwall (LG male gnome paladin 8/divine champion

5 of Gaerdal Ironhand), the gnomes have recently smoothed

over some points of friction between themselves and the gold

dwarves of the Great Rift. This new, more amicable relationship

has led to a pact of mutual assistance and defense between the

two regions.

The Riftwood

Just east of the Great Rift and generally north-northwest of

Delzimmer lies the Riftwood, a small section of forest that

appears lonely and isolated on the open plains of the Eastern

Shaar. This woodland is generally round in shape and somewhat

less overgrown with creepers, vines, and undergrowth than many

of the near-tropical forests in the region. The Riftwood is not on

the way to anywhere, nor is it particularly vital to anyone except

the gold dwarves of the Great Rift.

The inhabitants of the Deep Realm have dug a large passage

up into the heart of the Riftwood and established a small logging

community there, shielded from the prying eyes of visitors. The gold

161

The Shaar and the Great Rift

dwarves harvest timber from the Riftwood and take it to their

homeland below the Shaar for use in various kinds of construc-

tion, including scaoldingfornewdigs,furnitureforwhichstone

is unsuitable, and so forth. They are careful to take no more wood

than they need from the forest, and to replant sections they have

already cleared so as not to exhaust their supply of wood. The gold

dwarves maintain a large enough force on or near the surface to

keep most natural predators away from the logging operations, but

they allow those same beasts (panthers, snakes, giant beetles, and

so forth) to remain on the periphery in hopes that they can keep

unwanted visitors from entering the forest.

The River Shaar

The River Shaar actually originates inside the Great Rift, where it

drains the icy-cold Riftlake. The river plunges into a deep chasm

at the north end of the canyon, where it begins an underground

journey of more than 150 miles through caverns, ssures, and

a couple of subterranean lakes. The gold dwarves channel some

of the rivers water into their realm for drinking, sluicing in

their mines, and as a means of transport to dierent parts of

the Deep Realm.

The River Shaar returns to the surface at the Landrise, emerg-

ing from a broad cavern at the base of the clisalmostdueeast

of the Shaarwood, near the ruins of Peleveran (see below). Still

icy cold from its journey through the earth, its water is crystal

clear and uncontaminated by the dwarven mining operations

below the surface.

From the Landrise, the River Shaar winds its way across the

Shaar, cutting a wide but gentle and relatively shallow course

with numerous fords along its length. Eventually, it widens out

into the body of water known as Lake Lhespen, then owsinto

the Shaareach Forest, where it merges with the River Channath

to become the River Talar.

Many tribes rely on this waterway for sustenance, knowing that

it is one of the few rivers in the Shaar that does not dwindle much

in the hottest part of the year. Whereas many other watercourses

are reduced to tiny trickles in sun-baked mud ats during the

summer, the River Shaar ows strongly all year round. Some

shswiminitswatersprimarilychannelvarietiesandbottom

feeders that prefer the sluggish motion of its current.

The Shaarwood

The Shaarwood lies just north of the River Shaar, about equi-

distant between Shaarmid and the Landrise. Unlike most of

the forested regions of the Shaar, the Shaarwood is a dry, dusty

woodland, and its trees have been twisted and stunted by the

eternal winds that blow across the grasslands. The Shaarwood is

composed mostly of cedar and oak, interspersed with plenty of

cactus, razor-sharp grasses that grow chest-high to a human, and

thorny shrubs that slash and scrape any creature that tries to pass

through them. The ground is hard-packed and arid, suitable only

for lizards, snakes, scorpions, and ground squirrels.

The nomads of the Shaar occasionally come to the Shaarwood

to harvest some of the peppers that grow in abundance there,

which they use to season their food. Some also attempt to gather

berries from the thorny bushes, though doing so is hot, tiring,

bloody-ngeredwork.Theforestiscompletelyunsuitableforthe

nomads mounts because the grasses are unpalatable to the horses,

and the underbrush can quickly turn a riders legs into raw meat

without proper protection. Even the horses are susceptible to

scratches and cuts from the razor grasses that grow here. Bandits

occasionally hide out in the Shaarwood for brief periods, some

to avoid capture and others to rest between raids on the caravan

route just to the south of the woodland.

The Sharawood

Sometimes referred to as the Drakewood, the Sharawood sits

between Azulduth to the northwest and the Toadsquat Moun-

tains to the south. Thick and overgrown with tropical vines

and oweringcreepers,theSharawoodholdsmanysecrets,since

few sentient beings have ventured into its murky interior. The

nomads of the plains occasionally come to the edge of this forest

to gather herbs, hunt for food, or hide from their enemies, but

they rarely venture deeper into the woods because of the many

sword spiders that dwell there. These dangerous predators hunt

any creature that enters the forest, and occasionally they come

out as far as the edge of the woods to prey on herd animals that

stray too close to the trees.

As if the spiders didnt present enough danger, a traditional

story says that a terrible undead creature that steals peoples bodies

and turns them into zombie slaves haunts the Sharawood. In

fact, this tale is not far removed from the truth. An extremely

old and powerful dracolich known only as the Everlasting Wyrm

inhabits the darkest, deepest part of the Sharawood, ruminating

on its nefarious plots and slowly collecting a brood of minions.

Though it keeps to itself and tries to remain unnoticed by the

nomads of the plains, it does not hesitate to enslave any tribesfolk

who discover its existence. The dracolichs worst enemies are the

Knights of the Eternal Dragon, a group of undead stalwarts

hidden away in the ruins of the Castle of Alhanar, just south

of the Sharawood. Once every century, the knights arise and

charge into the woods to do battle with the dracolich and its

horde of living spawn. Though the knights always destroy the

dracolich and all its minions, this battle seems doomed to play

out over and over until the end of time because true to its name,

the Everlasting Wyrm simply reforms over a decade or two and

begins its machinations again.

The Uthangol Mountains

This chain of peaks stretches eastward from the tip of the

Chondalwood, forming an eectivebarrierbetweentheShaar

on the south side and the Black Ash Plain and the Green Lands

of Unther to the north. Windswept and relatively barren of

vegetation, the Uthangols serve as the northern boundary of

the territory claimed by the gold dwarves of the Great Rift,

who have followed and expanded on the endless tunnels and

caverns that stretch from their canyon all the way beneath

the heart of the mountains. Over the years, the gold dwarves

have tunneled up into the mountains from below, riddling the

Uthangols with mines.

from the Black Ash Plain dwell on the mountainsides. They ght

spiders, and avoid the hippogris,wyverns,andcopperdragons

that dwell in the higher reaches.

People of the Shaar

The people native to the Shaar share one very prominent

featurean indomitable spirit that lets them survive against

unfavorable odds. Though the various races and cultures of the

grasslands dier in dress, traditions, and outlook toward one

another, they have all learned to overcome the harshest weather,

terrain, and enemies that Faern has to oer, and to persevere

in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

Races and Cultures

Of all the regions of the Shining South, the Shaar is perhaps the

most complex in terms of its great variety of races and cultures.

Some racessuch as the gold dwarves of the Great Rift, the

sedentary humans in the trading centers, or the reclusive wild

elves and ghostwise halingsofthevariousforestsarermly

entrenched in their ancestral homes. Many othersincluding

humans, wemics, centaurs, and othersroam the grasslands as

nomadic tribes, coexisting in a never-ending cycle of hunting

and gathering. Still other races visit the Shaar only occasionally,

yet their presence impacts every native creatures way of life in

profound ways. Few outsiders fully understand the delicate bal-

ance that maintains the Shaar, but the grassy sea has been the

same for many centuries, and all who are part of it accept it as

an intrinsic element of their very existences.

Centaurs

While most centaurs in Faern inhabit the great forests, some

tribes roam the Shaar alongside other nomads. Like the other

natives of the Shaar, centaurs hunt the grasslands, taking only

what they need from the great herds that graze there. They either

ally or squabble with one another and with other nomads, just as

the humans do, though they are less savage overall than either

humans or wemics.

A typical centaur stands 7 to 8 feet tall from front hoof to

crown and measures 6 to 8 feet long from chest to tail, and weigh-

ing in at nearly 1,000 pounds. The horse portion of a centaurs

body resembles a zebraa trait that distinguishes him from

the centaurs elsewhere in Faernand his face is decidedly fey

in appearance, with swept-back, angular features and somewhat

pointed ears. He has golden bronze skin, light brown or golden

163

The Shaar and the Great Rift

hair, and eyes in any of a wide variety of shades. Shaaryan centaurs

prefer to wear their hair long, though they usually tie it back

and weave decorative tokens into it. The number and kind of

decorations a centaur wears indicate his rank in the tribe, though

such distinctions are usually lost on outsiders.

Male centaurs generally do the hunting, while females tend to

the camp and the young. During times of danger, both genders

ghtequallywell.Ingeneral,centaurskeeptothemselves,though

they occasionally join the humans in ceremonies at Council Hills,

and they sometimes trade in the towns on the fringes of civili-

zation. The centaurs get along best with the wemics, and they

respect the loxo, though they typically give the elephant folk a

wide berth.

Dragons

Not many dragons are native to the great plains of the Shaar,

but many of the winged terrors from all over Faern visit the

plains on occasion to feed on the great herds. Though a number

of dierent wyrms live in isolated parts of the mountains,

swamps, and forests in and around the Shaar, others visit from

as far away as the Sword Coast. A feeding dragon might make

two or three passes across a stretch of the plains, swooping low

and scooping up wild horses, roth, and other herd beasts, then

ying o to feed in peace.

Most of the time, these dragon visits are isolated events, and

the wyrms that frequently use the Shaar as a hunting ground

arrive at specictimesofdaydictatedbytheirownpreferences.

Some prefer to come in low from the east at dawn, and others

like to dive down from overhead, as though falling out of the

noonday sky. Still others hunt only at night. Occasionally, two

dragons cross paths while hunting, and a frightening battle above

the grassy plains often results. The nomads tales even speak of

a handful of legendary sky-battles involving three, four, or even

half a dozen huge wyrms at once. While such spectacles might be

awesome to behold, the nomads know better than to stick around

and wait to see which drake winds up the victor, since the winner

is not likely to be in a good mood afterward.

Gnolls

Of all the savage humanoids that roam the Shaar, only the gnolls

have the numbers to qualify as a formidable group. Though they

have carved out traditional homes throughout the hills and on

lower mountain slopes of every range across the Shaar, they are

most common in the western half, especially along the various

ridges north of the Channath Vale. The gnolls have histori-

cally preyed upon human settlements along the shores of Lake

Lhespen and on the caravans that move through that region. The

Lapaliiyans to the southwest have tried to eradicate the gnolls

several times in the past. All those eorts were in vain, and the

gnolls continue to plague the nomads in the western Shaar and

the cities where they trade.

Gold Dwarves

The Great Rift has been the traditional home of the gold dwarves

for untold centuries. Since they rstreclaimedthehugecanyon

and the tunnels and caverns beneath and around it from the drow

after the fall of Telantiwar, they have proudly and unfalteringly

stood their ground, never relinquishing control of their homeland.

With the onset of Moradins Thunder Blessing, the gold dwarves

have actually begun to overll their domain, and some have

started to seek out other locales in which to found new colonies.

They plan a great western migration to the caverns of Old Shana-

tar, with an army of crusaders to serve as its vanguard.

The average gold dwarf stands about 4 feet tall, but her stocky

build gives her almost the same weight as an adult human. Her

skin is a deep tan or brown color, and her eyes are usually brown

Human Tribes of the Shaar

Although the tribes of the Shaar share many featuresincluding

ethnic heritage, common enemies, and a nomadic lifestylethey

are as dierentinotherwaysasamerchantfromWaterdeepis

from an assassin in Thesk. Some tribes maintain good relations

with others, and some allow bad blood that has passed down for

many generations to divide them from other tribes.

Below are a few details about the largest and best-known

tribes that roam the Shaar. Several smaller and more isolated

tribes exist, but they are less visible to outsiders visiting the

plains than those detailed below.

Ankheg: The Ankheg Tribe roams the region of the Shaar

that lies between the Firesteap Mountains and the Shaarwood,

stretching from the Duskwood to the Landrise. The people

of this tribe have adopted the ankheg as their animal symbol,

and their raiders have adopted elements of its ghtingstyle.

Cheetah: The Cheetah Tribe claims the territory between the

Uthangol Mountains and the Great Rift, as far east as Council

Hills. The raiders of this tribe have trained themselves to run

like the cheetahs that roam the grasslands.

Eagle: The Eagle Tribe reveres the giant eagles that soar

overhead, and its raiders take pride in the superior vision and

leaping ability they have cultivated in imitation of the great

birds. The tribesfolk wander the territory in the far western part

of the Shaar, between the Shining Sea and Lake Lhespen.

Hyena: The Hyena Tribe controls all the land south of

Council Hills between the Riftwood and the Sharawood. Like

their namesake creature, the tribes raiders employ hiding and

tripping attacks in battle.

Lion: The members of the Lion Tribe roam the plains

from Lake Lhespen to the Landrise, south of the River Shaar.

Its raiders imitate the great lion when they attack, entering a

slashing frenzy when they charge opponents.

Rhinoceros: The Rhinoceros Tribe wanders the area between

the Great Rift and the Landrise, and from the Chondalwood

to the Amtar. Like the horned beasts from which they take

their name, Rhinoceros raiders have learned how to heighten

damage when charging.

wear their hair long, and most males (as well as some females)

also wear carefully groomed moustaches and beards.

The gold dwarves of the Great Rift share a proud but suspi-

cious nature. They claim all the area that lies a full days ride by

pony in any direction from the canyon, and they do not suer

the presence of bandits or explorers lightly. Nondwarves are

rarely permitted inside their homes. They have established the

city of Eartheart (see Cities and Sites, below) for dealing with

outsiders.

See page 11 of Races of Faern for more information on

gold dwarves.

Loxo

The loxo of the Shaar are nomadic hunter-gathers who live

side-by-side with the other great tribal races of the plains. The

other nomads tend to leave them alone because an angry loxo is

fearsome to beholdor to battle. Though their numbers are small,

the loxo roam vast tracts of land, sating their huge appetites with

grass, vegetables, and occasionally fruits and nuts.

A loxo is an elephantine humanoid that stands about 7 or

8 feet tall and easily weighs 1,500 pounds or more. He has

blue-gray, wrinkled skin covered with rough, sparse hair, and his

stout body has elephantine appendages, including thick, round

limbs, at feet, and pudgy ngers. His ears are large and swept

back, but his most striking features are his twin trunks, which

protrude from his face just above the mouth and are ankedby

long, curving tusks. Each trunk is about 2 feet long and ends in

three small, ngerlike digits.

The loxo organize by clans, each of which is little more than

an extended family. All the members of a particular clan wear

similar rustic clothing, with special designs woven into the fabric.

Two or more clans might travel together in a herd.

Occasionally, loxo come to the edges of human civilization,

bringing rustic works of art crafted from animal bones, wood,

or stone to trade for food and supplies. Though the Shaaryan

humans are wary of the strange-looking loxo, the elephant folk

are not adversarial unless threatened. The loxo do not interact

with the other nomadic tribes of the grassland on a regular

basis. Unlike the wemics and centaurs, the loxo do not make a

habit of venturing to Council Hills for the human gatherings,

though in extraordinary circumstances, they have been known

to send a delegate.

Shaarans

The humans who roam the plains of the Shaar are known as

Shaarans. They have wandered the grasslands as nomads since

before the areas recorded history began, enduring the hardships

of an inhospitable environment, dangerous enemy tribes, and

a host of predators from both the plains and the surrounding

165

The Shaar and the Great Rift

areas. This constant struggle has honed them into a tough,

proud people who are loath to give up their ways, even in the

face of conquest.

The typical Shaaran is long-faced and yellow-skinned, but

not very tall (about 5-1/2 feet, on average). Her hair and eyes

are usually black or dark brown. On rare occasions, a Shaaran

is born with bright green eyesa sign of good luck among the

nomads. Few Shaaran males wear facial hair, and both genders

cut their hair short.

Nomads: A Shaaryan nomads most prized possession is her

horsea magnicentanimalthatthrivesonthegrassesofthe

plains where the nomads roam. In fact, Shaarans refuse to take

their horses out of the Shaar because the animals never seem

to fare well elsewhere. Almost invariably, they grow weak and

eventually die if denied the opportunity to feed on their native

grasses. A Shaaran carries everything she owns on her own horse

or, if she is wealthy, on a pack horse. Children are practically

born in the saddle.

The dozen or so tribes of Shaarans share a common culture,

but each also maintains separate elements of its own tradition.

Outsiders have diculty distinguishing among the dierent

tribes, but the nomads can readily identify one anothers tribal

aliationbythedierencesin dress,horsecoloration,dwelling

styles, weapon styles and decorations, and traditional roaming

territories. Some tribes view women as equal to men, and a few

have elected female chiefs.

No one has ever tried to unify the Shaarans. Some regions of

the Shaar (particularly in the western half) have been conquered

on occasion, but in each case, the Shaarans simply waited until the

conquerors power base vanished, then resumed their way of life

as though nothing had happened. Occasionally, two tribes form a

close bond, usually through a marriage between a powerful family

from each tribe. Such a relationship allows the tribes to reap the

benetsofmutualprotection,sharewater,andavoidterritorial

disputes with one another for several generations. Over time,

though, intertribal relationships always change, as new bonds

form and old alliances fade away.

Townspeople: The humans who dwell in the communities

scattered across the Shaar are most often Shaarans who preferred

a settled way of life to the nomadic lifestyle of their ancestors.

Most of these towns and cities arose as a result of trade meets

between various tribes, usually in prime locations where natural

resources were abundant. Others were founded when nations and

empires attempted to conquer or settle certain regions of the

Shaar. The most signicant settlement eort occurred during

the Shoon Imperium, when the Shoonach held all the territory

from the Shining Sea to the Landrise. The settlements founded

during that period still exist, though they no longer owe anyone

allegiance. Regardless of how and why they formed, the vari-

ous urban centers in the Shaar have always remained small by

Faernian standards, and they subsist primarily on the trade

that passes through their markets and the sale of the few meager

resources (such as sh,salt,lumber,orworkedgoodsmadefrom

animal parts) that they have available.

While the majority of the people in these towns and cities

are Shaaran, other ethnicities are also represented. Most often,

such individuals arrive via trade caravans that wind their way

through the grassland on a regular basis and simply decide to

stay. Some locals are descendants of traders who came from as

far away as Durpar, Turmish, and Amn. Whatever their origin,

the residents of these towns live together in relative harmony

and share two common purposes: survival and prosperity.

Thri-Kreen

The strange, insectlike thri-kreen are perhaps the most bizarre of

the hunter nomads native to the Shaar. The thri-kreen roam the

plains just as the humans and other nomadic races do, following

herd animals for sustenance. Unlike the humanoids that call the

Shaar home, the thri-kreen are built for the hot, arid conditions

of the grasslands, and they thrive in this environment. Because

of their alien nature and their skill with camouageandsurprise

attacks, many other inhabitants of the Shaar fear the thri-kreen

and give them a wide berth.

A thri-kreen looks like a bipedal praying mantis with six

limbstwo for standing and four more for manipulating tools

and weapons. The carapace of a typical specimen might be any

shade from sandy brown to pale green, whichever blends in best

with the surroundings. Thri-kreen wear harness belts, to which they

attach various tools and small weapons, but no other clothing.

The thri-kreen exist in relatively small numbers, and their

territory is limited to the lowlands and the hills just north of

the Toadsquat Mountains. They make occasional forays farther

north, though they try to avoid confrontations with the humans,

so they usually stay clear of Council Hills. Wemics and centaurs

dislike thri-kreen, but they rarely go out of their way to engage

them. Loxo, perhaps because they too are considered alien by most

inhabitants of the Shaar, accept the thri-kreen and sometimes

trade with them.

Wemics

Wemics might be the most skillful and savage hunters in the

entire Shaar. Strongly tribal, they possess no writing skills and

no interest in recorded history. Wemics have had to ght to

maintain their traditional hunting grounds since they arrived

in the Shaarbefore the recorded history of any of the other

races of the areaand they dont intend to let anyone take their

territory away from them.

A wemic is a centaurlike creature with the body of a lion, the

upper torso of a human, and a head with a mixture of human

and leonine features. An average specimen stands about 6-1/2 to

7 feet tall from his forepaws to the top of his head and measures

about 12 feet long from head to tail tip. An adult can weigh as

much as 600 pounds. A wemics body is covered with golden or

golden-brown fur, and the tip of his tail is always darker in color

than the rest of his body. He has ears that sit high on his head and

eyes like a cats, with golden irises and narrow, slitted pupils. All

six of his limbs end in claws, though the ones on his humanoid

hands and front paws are retractable. A mane the same color as

his tail tip frames a male wemics face.

Wemics are proud creatures and ercenomadichunters.They

are not adversarial to other creatures that accept their ways and

do not try to steal their territory. A wemic that feels threatened,

however, ghts tooth and claw to his dying breath to keep his

way of life intact.

166

The Shaar and the Great Rift

For the most part, the wemics get along well enough with the

human tribes of the Shaar, sometimes joining them at Council

Hills for the biannual gatherings. The feline hunters are not so

tolerant of the settled humans who live in the small communities

scattered throughout the Shaar, though they occasionally enter

these towns to trade. The wemics get along best with the centaurs

with whom they share the grasslands, and they have a healthy

respect for the loxo, though thee two races rarely interact. In

times of troubleparticularly when dragons appear overhead

for feastingany wemics, centaurs, and loxo in the area come

together in joint defense.

See page 149 of Races of Faern for more information

on wemics.

Wild Elves and Ghostwise Halflings

Both the wild elves (who live primarily in the Forest of Amtar

on the south side of the Shaar and the Misty Vale along its

southwestern border) and the ghostwise halings(wholiveinthe

Channathwood and the area where the southeastern tip of the

Chondalwood borders the Shaar) are strong isolationists. Neither

race is interested in interacting with others, and both prefer to be

left alone in their respective woodland domains. In fact, the wild

elves of the Misty Vale are so xenophobic that they drive back

any human incursions into their territory with fatal eciency.

Though the other races that roam the grasslands know of the

elves and the hin, they respect their privacy and give their woods

a wide berth.

Life and Society

The inhabitants of the Shaar share several characteristics. Most

notably, they have adapted to the harsh terrain and climate,

established many centuries worth of traditions, and developed a

mutualif sometimes grudgingrespect for one another based

on their shared experiences. In other ways, however, they are quite

dissimilar. Tradition might be an important aspect of life for all

who live in the endless grasslands, but specic traditions dier

greatly from group to group, tribe to tribe, and race to race.

Economy

The economy throughout most of the Shaar is not based on

money. No coins are minted here, and they are of little use in

areas other than towns.

City Dwellers: The folk who live in the urban centers have a

slightly more developed economy than the nomads. While city

dwellers are willing to barter with the tribesmen who come to

their markets, they also accept coins, particularly from merchants

passing through the Shaar from one nation to another. In fact,

the trading communities of the Shaar have eectivelybecome

currency exchange centers, since caravans often trade not only

in goods, but in coinage as well. A merchant from Durpar might

arrive with goods to sell and be more than willing to accept cur-

rency from Chondath in exchange, since he intends to head there

next. While in the Shaar, the same merchant might purchase

some local crafts and pay in Durpari coin. The next merchant,

perhaps from Calimshan, is happy to take the Durpari coin for

her goods, since she can use it at her next stop in Estagund.

Gold Dwarves: The gold dwarves of the Great Rift simply

mine their currency, digging precious metals and minerals out

of the earth beneath their homeland and fashioning them into

exquisite jewelry or ingots for trade with merchants. In exchange

for their silver, gold, gemstones, and the magic items they some-

times craft, the gold dwarves acquire food (fruit, vegetables, and

cheese), textiles, lamp oil, and other worked goods.

Nomads: For the most part, the tribes (human and otherwise)

that roam the grasslands get everything they need from the

land, using the animals they hunt for food, clothing, tools, and

sometimes mounts. When they slay an animal, they use every

part of it, wasting nothing. They have no commerce, and few

have ever seen a coin, much less had any use for one. When the

nomads wish to exchange goods, they simply barter with one

another or with the merchants in the towns, who are used to

this arrangement and dont mind trading goods for goods. The

only items not needed for survival that the nomads consider

valuable are pieces of jewelry (usually necklaces, bracelets, and

hair adornments) made of animal bones or particularly beauti-

ful rocks and crystals. They occasionally use such jewelry as a

kind of currency, particularly when trading with other tribes

that roam dierent regions and thus do not have access to the

same materials.

Wild Elves and Ghostwise Halings: The races that dwell in

the forests of the Shaar rarely participate in trade of any sort.

They are completely self-sucientwithintheirwoodedhomelands

and for the most part, they have neither the need nor the desire

to venture outside those domainsnor do they wish merchants

to visit them. Only the ghostwise halingsoftheChannathwood

ever deign to trade with outsiders, and they leave their woodland

homes to do so rather than allowing others to enter.

Law and Order

Those native to the Shaar have dierentapproachestolawand

order depending upon their races and lifestyles.

City Dwellers: In the cities and towns, law and order are

much more structured than in the plains because the citizens

face dierentdangersthanthenomads.Theconstantpresence

of settled people with property and valuables is an irresistible

draw for gnolls and other monsters, as well as bandits. Nomads

frequent the towns, and occasionally members of adversarial

tribes attempt to resolve their dierences in the middle of the

marketplace. Furthermore, the urban centers are natural targets

for any enemy nations that wish to conquer tracts of the Shaar.

Thus, every community elects a chief from a Council of Elders,

just as the tribes do in the wild, and maintains a standing militia

or defense force of some kind to protect the citizens. The chief,

with the backing of the militia, deals with any and all trouble,

from within or without.

Gold Dwarves: The laws and customs that govern gold dwarf

society have been in place for millennia. Respect for clan elders

is paramount, but beyond that, few outsiders know anything

about their social traditions. Their laws pertaining to outsiders,

however, are well publicized and quite strict. Gold dwarves see

little value in the magic-lust of humans, the foolishness of elves,

or even the tolerant nature of their cousins, the shield dwarves,

so they regulate the activities of such folk quite rigorously. First

167

The Shaar and the Great Rift

and foremost, they strictly limit how far any other being can

venture into gold dwarf territory. Merchants must stick to the

roads heading into and out of Eartheart, but they may not enter

the city proper. They must conduct their business in the market

town known as Hammer and Anvil, just outside Earthearts

walls. Those caught violating this rule of sanctity are usually

never seen again. In addition, anywhere within the boundaries

of the Great Rift (a one-day ride on ponyback in any direction

from an edge of the canyon), all the traditional laws of peace and

fairness apply (no violence except in self-defense, no theft, and so

forth). These laws are enforced by the dwarf watchguardsabout

seventy stern and dour warriors who keep an eye on everything

and suspect everyone of some kind of mischief.

Nomads: Shaarans have traditional laws that regulate their

conduct on the open plains. Raiding is so common between tribes

that it has become an accepted fact of life. A raiding party made

up of fewer than twenty individuals is considered acceptable,

and the targets of such a raid might return the favor in kind.

However, any attack by a force greater than twenty is denedas

an act of war, and other tribes quickly band together to defend

themselves against the aggressor. Often, such events become topics

of discussion at the spring and fall gatherings at Council Hills.

Since that place is considered sacred ground and violence and

bloodshed are prohibited there, it is a logical place for warring

tribes to meet and resolve their dierences.Shaaryanhistoryis

lledwithinstancesofonetribeambushinganothertoprevent

just such an occurrence, hoping to prolong a war.

Within each tribe, traditional respect for the elders dictates

how problems are resolved. The tribal elders may choose a chief,

order penance for wrongdoings, or cast out an oendingmember

of the tribe. The laws of any given tribe are somewhat uidbecause

the Shaarans believe it is more important to consider the tribes

current needs and values than to worry about what has occurred

before. If a former enemy of the tribe is named a friend, then

all members of the tribe must put aside any personal vendettas

they have against that person and respect the new relationship.

Defense and Warcraft

The defensive needs of the Shaars natives dierdependingon

their lifestyle.

Gold Dwarves: The gold dwarves defend the Great Rift

staunchly and stubbornly, and they take great pains to deal with

all potential threats, whether they arrive overland, by air, or via

subterranean pathways. The rim of the canyon is surrounded by

sixty structures known as riftedge towers. These stone towers

are accessible only via tunnels from below, and each houses a

deadly array of catapults and ballistae, as well as a unit of sixty

gold dwarf warriors armed with heavy crossbows and dwarven

axes. Any unauthorized being or vehicle approaching the Great

Rift is greeted with a single warning shot. If the intruder fails

to retreat, a deadly hail of missile re follows.

In addition to the troops stationed inside the riftedge towers,

a special unit called the Peacehammersa collection of hip-

pogri-mounteddwarfskyridersarmedwiththrowingaxesand

lancespatrols the skies overhead, above both the Great Rift

itself and the plains beyond the edge of the canyon. Some of these

skyriders carry magic lances that can reboltsofameormagic

missiles upon command. Any dwarf sentry or lookout stationed

anywhere within the gold dwarves realmon the canyon oor,

in a niche set into one of the canyon walls, or on patrol out on

the grasslandscan sound a horn and have a corps of Peaceham-

mers yingherwayinamatterofmoments.(SeetheGreatRift

skyrider prestige class in Races of Faern for more information

on the Peacehammers.)

In addition to these specialized forces, the gold dwarves also

maintain a police force known as the Steel Shields, which is

stationed inside the religious temple-fortress of Eartheart on

the surface. The Steel Shields are 14,000 strong, and their leader

is elected annually by the Deep Lords of the Deep Realm. The

current Lord Scepter is Mariochar Bladebeard (LG male gold

dwarf cleric 10 of Clangeddin Silverbeard/dwarven defender 7),

an insightful tactical genius who has held the position for the last

thirty-ve years. Mariochar has devoted his life to the defense

of the Great Rift.

The main entryway into the subterranean tunnels beneath

the Great Rift is a broad passage sealed by 70-foot-tall, solid-gold

doors. Known simply as the Gates, these great valves are further

protected by magical wards and runes to ensure their stability.

The Gates bar entry into a large cavern designed to overawe any

visitorsthough such are exceedingly rare. Beyond this chamber

is the great dwarven city of Underhome. The Gates are kept closed

except in times of war, when they part to allow the armies of

the gold dwarves to march forth to battle. Most trac passes

through the Gates by means of small sally doors set into the

bases of the huge portals. One popular legend among the gold

dwarves states that shortly after their construction, the Gates

withstood a full-on attack from a great wyrm, which attempted

to hurl itself against them at full ying speed. The Gates stood

strong, and the dragon was no more.

The last defense of the gold dwarf nation is its standing army,

which is commanded by a duke selected from among the Deep

Lords. All told, the army can muster nearly 60,000 troops, broken

down into an elite ducal bodyguard (600), axe wielders (29,000),

light crossbow troops (16,000) heavy crossbow troops (6,000), and

regulars (4,0005,000). While this army might seem inordinately

large, the Deep Lords know that a force of immense size is the

only way to protect the vast amount of territory claimed by the

gold dwarves and guard the many approaches from which enemies

could close in.

Nomads: For those who roam the plains, the best defense is

enough speed to escape any threat. The mobility that is so vital for

following the herds serves the tribes in many other ways. Mounted

combat with ranged weapons, which provides a means of damaging

the enemy while remaining out of harms way, is as much a part

of the nomads culture as sleeping inside tents. Raiding works as a

combat style because battles are rapid and the raiders can be gone

almost before their targets become aware of them.

In true combat, most of the tribes (whether human, wemic,

centaur, thri-kreen, or otherwise) use the same tried-and-true

technique, in which the males form a defensive line while the

females move the children otosafety.Thereafter,thefemales

and males join together to ghtwhateverthreatensthem.Almost

every race that roams the Shaar employs simple weapons such as

slings and spears, which can be easily constructed out of animal

parts and the scattered vegetation native to the plains. A chieftain

or great warrior might have a bow of some sort, though such

weapons are prized more as status symbols than as tools of war,

since arrows are diculttocomebyexceptinthetradecenters.

Religion

The deities venerated in the Shaar are as varied as the nomads

who roam there. Each race pays homage to a handful of deities,

but no single religion holds sway everywhere.

Centaurs: As a group, the centaurs of the Shaar are not terribly

devout. Those who do follow a deity most often venerate Solonor

Thelandria of the Seldarine, though a few oertheirdevotionto

Silvanus. Sages speculate that the veneration of this latter deity

might be a carryover from ancestors who once dwelled in more

verdant parts of Faern.

Gold Dwarves: The dwarves of the Great Rift honor the entire

dwarven pantheon in much the same way as their northern kin,

though Moradin and Clangeddin Silverbeard are venerated above

all others. Moradins popularity stems not just from his status as

Father of the Dwarves, but also from the Thunder Blessing that

he granted to all dwarves. This monumental event has allowed the

gold dwarves to enjoy greater prosperity and advancement than

they have seen in several centuries. Clangeddin holds a special

place for those who defend the Great Rift and anyone else who

ventures to the surface frequently.

In addition to those two deities, many gold dwarves of both

genders are favorably disposed toward Haela Brightaxe. The Lady

of the Frays love of no-holds-barred, unadulterated battle appeals

to many of the gold dwarves, who enjoy nothing more than a

good battle against old enemies deep in the Underdark. Lastly,

because they face relatively few challenges compared with their

shield dwarf kin, some gold dwarves have the time to develop their

creativity and their philosophical nature. These individuals, who

often prefer to venerate Dugmaren Brightmantle, spend their days

contemplating the deeper mysteries of dwarven life and applying

what theyve learned to crafting, shaping, and sculpting new and

wondrous items.

Humans: Most Shaarans pay homage to Tempus, since his

devotion to protection and strength reectsthevaluestheyhave

cultivated over the centuries to ensure their survival on the harsh

plains. Others, who glory in the hunt rather than in war, choose

to follow Malar. Those few nomadic tribes that serve Akadi make

it a point to gather at the hallowed hill of Blaskaltar (see Cities

and Sites, below) every midsummer to revere her.

In the cities of the Shaar, the inuenceofthedeitiesissome-

what less obvious. A wide variety of cultures and faiths cross

paths in these places, and none holds an appreciable upper hand.

But in certain portions of the urban centers where thieves and

worse are numerous, Shar and Mask hold sway. Since no strong,

organized religious presence exists in the Shaar, these shadowy

forces operate virtually unchecked.

Wemics: The vast majority of the wemics follow their own

deity, Nobanion, the patron of their druids and rangers. A few

of the more savage individualsparticularly those who enjoy the

thrill of the huntchoose to follow the Beastlord instead.

Other Races: Neither loxo nor thri-kreen are religious

by nature.

Adventurers

Most inhabitants of the Shaar could care less whether adventurers

enter the plains or not. Since the nomads dont assign ownership

of the land to any one group of people, they do not feel any

territorial jealousy toward strangersthough this attitude does

not mean that adventurers have nothing to fear from them.

More than a few members of the various tribesparticularly the

more bloodthirsty among the humans, wemics, and thri-kreen as

well as the vast majority of the gnollsdont hesitate to attack

strangers on sight, just for the sake of killing. Certainly, such

behavior is common among the wild elves of the Misty Vale. In

other places, adventurers must be wary of more insidious evils,

such as the yuan-ti that hide in the ruins of Lhesper, grabbing

explorers to use in their searches (see Lhesper, below).

Within the cities, the merchants are happy to send adventur-

ers ointothewildernesswellequippedwithsuppliespurchased

from their carts and stores. The shopkeepers truly hope to see

these intrepid heroes return with pouches full of newfound coin,

which they might be willing to spend on more goods. On the

outskirts of civilization, bandits also appreciate seeing adventurers,

since their presence means more opportunities to take coin and

equipment by force.

Politics and Power

No centralized power base exists among the peoples of the Shaar,

with the possible exception of the gold dwarves in the Great Rift,

who keep to themselves, anyway. The nomadic tribes constantly

skirmish with one anotherboth verbally at Council Hills and

on the eld of battleover territory, water, and food. When

planning attacks, the chief of each tribe must balance the desire

for greater glory against the wisdom of making enemies of too

many other tribes. Some chiefs are more charismatic than others,

but none are powerful enough to unite all the tribes under a single

ruler, or even to command superiority at the biannual meeting

at Council Hills.

For the most part, the city-dwellers of the Shaar desire noth-

ing more than to pursue trade. A few assertive folk might have

designs on dominating a trade route or a marketplace, either

nancially or militarily, but no location is so strategically valu-

able that trade could not continue without it. Were one area to

fall under the control of a tyrant, trade would simply continue

somewhere else. The Shaar simply was not made to be conquered

or ruled.

The gold dwarves, on the other hand, practice enough politics

for all the races combined. For many centuries, the Great Rift and

its immediate subterranean surroundings were awash in royalty.

These petty, decadent rulers squabbled incessantly, and with the

drow and duergar growing in power, their endless feuds, bickering,

and private wars began to threaten the survival of all the gold

dwarves. To end the inghtingandbringpeaceandstabilityto

the realm, the ruling body known as the Deep Lords was created

some 700 years ago. Today, although the gold dwarves homeland

is still ruled by a monarch (currently a queen), the Deep Lords

make policy for the realm.

Government

Since it is not a nation, the Shaar has no single, unifying govern-

ment. Each of its major population groupsthe nomadic tribes,

the citizens of the settled communities, and the gold dwarves of

the Great Riftoperates independently of the others and has

its own kind of government.

City Dwellers: Though more structured within the towns

and cities, the government of Shaaryan towns is minimal

compared to many of the urban centers elsewhere in Faern.

Usually, the leader is a mayor or similar oceholderoften

the wealthiest merchant or the most powerful warrior. This

leader works with a council of the most inuential people to

meet the communitys critical needs, such as building a wall,

raising military forces for defense, deciding the level of taxation

needed to pay for services, and so forth. In most cases, the

citizens want as little control and restriction on their activities

as possible, and they rely on the governing body to do only

what is necessary to keep trade owing.

Gold Dwarves: In the surface portion of the gold dwarves

realm, the government focuses on the military, with officers

in command of various defenses and police forces acting

as nominal governors. Underground, the situation is more

political. The affairs of the Deep Realm are administered

by the Deep Lords, the governing council of the gold dwarf

clan elders, which consists of four representatives from each

clan. This body dispenses justice, commands the dwarf armies,

and decides matters of policy. The council answers to Queen

Karriva of the Simmerforge clan (LG female gold dwarf

aristocrat 13).

Nomads: Government is least formal among the human

tribes. Though not anarchistic, the tribes accept only enough

government to ensure survival and promote prosperity. Each

tribe functions under the watchful eye of a group of elders,

generally men and women at least thirty years old. These elders

select a chief from among their number, typically by secret vote.

Male chiefs rule most of the tribes, but a few have elevated

women to that position. The chief, in consultation with the

elders, makes decisions that aect the tribe as a whole, such

as movements, trading, warfare and raiding, and punishments

for crimes committed by tribal members and enemies. In some

cases, the chief is part of a powerful, charismatic family that

has held the seat of power in the tribe for many years.

Enemies

For the most part, the tribes vie with one another for territory,

horses, and food to so great an extent that they need no external

enemies. When beset by threats from beyond the edges of the

Shaar, however, they manage to band together and fend o

attacks by outsiders. Though the gold dwarves do their best to

remain aloof and separate from the rest of the peoples of the

Shaar, they too are ready and willing to ght to maintain the

sanctity of their homeland.

The Shaar and the Great Rift

Lapaliiya

This coastal nation has a long history of attempting to cultivate

and colonize the interior of the Shaar. On more than one occasion,

its citizens have settled towns along the Shaars riverfronts and

attempted to tame the barbaric nomads by a variety of means.

Also, Lapaliiya has sometimes been under the thumb of some

other nation with designs on civilizing the plains, including the

yuan-ti of Serpentes (see Serpent Kingdoms for more information)

and the old Shoon Imperium. Every time conquerors arrived,

however, the tribesfolk simply vanished or avoided the invaders,

then returned to their traditional lands as soon as the troops

were recalled. Past failures are no insurance against future at-

temptsperhaps even in the near future.

Mulhorand

Though this aggressive theocracy has not made any untoward

movements into the Shaar as yet, it has a history of dominating

the regions surrounding it. The invasion of neighboring Unther

has given the tribes that wander closest to the Shaars border with

Mulhorand pause. If the time comes for the Mulhorandi clergy to

consider invading the plainsperhaps to control the trade routes

therethe nomads will face a formidable foe, indeed.

Underdark Races

The ancient enemies of the gold dwarves, especially the drow and

the duergar, are scattered throughout Great Bhaerynden and are

never far from the Deep Realm. Any one of these fell races could

renew its hostilities with the gold dwarves at any time. The drow

cities of Llurth Dreir and Tlindhet are both within striking

distance and bear constant watching. (See Underdark for more

information on these races and their plans.)

Yuan-Ti

The serpent people are closer than most folk of the Shaar realize,

and they present a constant threat. Most recently, the yuan-ti

have returned to the ruins of Lhesper, where they have begun

to dig for ancient artifacts from the long-forgotten kingdoms

of the sarrukh, their creator race. Serpentfolk have also begun

to awaken in and around Azulduth, the Lake of Salt. Tribes

roaming close to either of these locations might become pawns

in the yuan-tis nefarious schemes. (See Serpent Kingdoms for

more information on the yuan-ti and their plans.)

Cities and Sites

Most communities in the Shaar are little more than trading

centers. Each is close to a reliable source of water, since potable

water is such a prized commodity in the plains. Because of the

concentration of valuable commodities that accumulates in

such places, almost all the Shaars towns and cities have walls

to protect their citizens from the raiders and bandits who roam

the grasslands. The gold dwarves have their own cities, only a

few of which are on the surface. These urban centers tend to be

markedly dierentfromtherestoftheplainscommunities,since

the races do not share ideas readily.

Blaskaltar

Blaskaltar is nothing more than a broad, low mound of grassy

earth warmed by the baking sun of the Shaar. Though rumor

says that a city once stood on this site, no records of it exist, and

no remnants of it are leftnot even ruined stonework.

The followers of Akadi refer to this mound as the First Shrine

of the Queen of Air and consider it the most important holy

site of their faith. Every midsummer, followers of the Lady of

the Winds gather here to worship her, swelling the nearby com-

munities of Shaarmid and Kormul for several days.

Delzimmer (Small City)

Four powerful merchant families control this free-trade city: the

Harlhauns, the Jathlets, the Belarks, and the Olaundrans. Though

they are rivals in business, the families have managed to ndenough

common ground to establish some level of law and order for the

town, using their private militias to keep the peace. The families all

run businesses associated with serving caravans, including storage

warehouses, outtters,andnancialservices(moneylendersand

moneychangers), but they are not costers themselves.

The stone walls surrounding the heart of Delzimmer have long

since outlived their usefulness. The city has grown considerably

since the walls were built, and shops, dwellings, and warehouses

have spilled out into the open ground beyond their perimeter.

Roads have been cut through the walls to provide access to the

businesses outside, and the remaining portions are in poor repair,

sporting cracked mortar and holes of various sizes.

Delzimmers citizens are all in the business of providing

services, either for the caravan trac or for the other locals.

The rest of the people in the city on any given day are caravan

masters, their escorts, and the merchants who hire them.

The Shaar and the Great Rift

Eartheart (Metropolis)

The dwarven city of Eartheart is actually separated into two

major sections. Eartheart proper is a walled fortress-city with

soaring towers and ramped, multilevel streets. Outside its walls is

the tent-city of Hammer and Anvil (see below), where outsiders

come to trade. Eartheart is only partially visible from the plains

around the Great Rift, since many of its levels are belowground,

accessible only via spiraling staircases.

The Lord Scepter of Eartheart, Mariochar Bladebeard (LG

male gold dwarf cleric 10 of Clangeddin Silverbeard/dwarven

defender 7), rules the city on behalf of the Deep Lords. Aided

by the troops known as the Steel Shields, he runs the place like a

military compound, though the city contains far more civilians

than soldiers.

Eartheart serves as the gold dwarves connection with the

rest of the worlda place where they can store trade goods

and provisions and also maintain an army that can deal with

outside threats before they ever reach the Great Rift. Many

dwarvesboth gold and shieldwho come and go from the

Great Rift prefer to live in Eartheart rather than elsewhere in

the canyon or its subterranean environs.

Aviaries

The Peacehammers, the Great Rifts aerial defense forces, house

their hippogris in great roosts high in the city. Numerous

grooms, trainers, and even some druids are on hand in the

aviaries to care for these creatures. Though the skyguards take

their mounts out on regular patrols and allow them to feed on

the wild herd animals that roam the plains, an incredible amount

of fresh meat must be brought to the aviaries each day. Most

of it is obtained in Hammer and Anvil from the hunters of the

plains tribes who come there to trade.

Steel Shield Headquarters

The Steel Shields are stationed in an immense, walled compound

near the gate that leads to the tent-city known as Hammer and

Anvil. Since the Steel Shields organization boasts more than

14,000 troops, including ocers,thecompoundtakesupenough

room to be another small city in its own right. The headquarters

houses barracks, mess halls, training facilities, and armories.

Temple of the

Morndinsamman

Actually  a  collection  of  individual

temples gathered together in the center

of the city, the Temple of Morndinsam-

man occupies the central point of Eartheart.

Each building is dedicated to a dierentdeity

of the dwarven pantheon, with the Temple

of Moradin in the center and the others

forming  a  circle  around  it.  Though

impressive enough when viewed from

the surface, the temples true stature

can be fully appreciated only by

those who descend into their

lowest levels, where the most

powerful and revered servants

of the dwarven deities show

their respect deep within

the earth.

Hammer and

Anvil (Small City)

Built against the western outer

wall of Eartheart is Hammer

and Anvil, a sprawling tent-city

consisting primarily of moveable

workshop-huts and tents. Nu-

merous watchful dwarf guards

are posted within the town to

ensure that those who come to

trade cause no trouble. Most

nondwarves are not welcome

beyond Hammer and Anvil, but

in the tent-city, the gold dwarves

are more than happy to meet

with all comers and trade their

gold, silver, and forged goods for

foodstus,textiles,andotheritems

in short supply on the plains and

underground. Of the roughly 8,000

people in Hammer and Anvil at any

time, about half are nondwarves who

have stopped briey to trade, and the

other half are dwarves who live in Eartheart

and come here daily to barter on behalf of the Deep

Realm or sell their services (primarily blacksmithing,

armor repairs, and so forth).

The city of Eartheart

173

Hardcastle

(Small Town)

Founded in the days of the Kingdom

of Peleveria, Hardcastle is not much

more than a fortied trading

camp  (population  1,316)

that sits at the crossroads of

three major caravan routes.

One  road  comes  in  from

Delzimmer  and  the  Great

Rift to the south, one from

Unther, and the third from the

Vilhon Reach. After Mulhorand in-

vaded Unther, the folk of Hardcastle

expected the trade from that region

to dry up, but the trac on the

road to Unther has actual-

ly increased over the last

year because the Mulho-

randi forces have required a

healthy supply of goods

particularly food, weapons,

and healing magicto keep

their armies supplied.

The  reigning  lord  of

Hardcastle  is  Frego

Cordwell (LE male hu-

man ghter 4/rogue 9),

a former caravan master

out of Chondath who de-

cided that he could make

more  money  with  less

road time by taking over

one of the most lucrative

stops. Since assuming con-

trol of the trading camp, he

has enticed numerous small

business owners to set up shop

in Hardcastle, where they can

cater to the caravan trac.

Borrowing an idea from the

Durpari people, with whom

he once had business deal-

ings, Cordwell has contracted

private organizations to provide

all the town services, including

law enforcementthough he

made certain to hire a former

business associate for that job to

ensure some measure of loyalty.

Thus, Frego is free to administer

the usage fees he charges without

having to actually worry about the

logistics of providing the services.

The Shaar and the Great Rift

Khltar (Small City)

Known as the Iron City because of its unusual, iron-covered

walls, Khltar (population 7,643) is a muddy, smoky community

with lots of stout but squat stone buildings, cobbled streets, and

minimal greenery. Its 100-foot-tall, double outer walls stand in

two concentric rings around the city, with a 30-foot-wide, poorly

drained trench in between. The trench is lledwithrottinggar-

bage, iron waste from the forges, and the occasional corpse. On

the north, west, and south sides of the city, gates pierce the walls,

and a bridge spans the trench at each of these points.

Originally founded by the gold dwarves, Khltar is a city of

forginga place where those who dont wish to pay the higher

prices in Hammer and Anvil can come to purchase everything

from arms and armor to ladles, scoops, belt buckles, and andirons.

The sky over Khltar is always black and sooty by day and a hazy,

glowing orange by night.

In the center of the city sits High Khltar, the center of law

and government. The ruler of the city, known as the Muni-

cent Belarkh, is ostensibly a supreme merchant and an absolute

overlord. The truth is that merchant families with extensive

investments in various businesses run the city, and the belarkh

simply acts as their mouthpiece. The current belarkh is Enklaevur

Rostigror (CN male human expert 4/ghter3/rogue6),aformer

caravan merchant, thief, and vagabond trader.

Lhesper

In the heart of the Shaar, at the northern tip of Lake Lhespen,

lies the ruined town of Lhesper. Destroyed by gnoll raiders in

640 DR, it has lain in ruins ever since. Currently, several yuan-ti

arcane spellcasters, all of whom are members of an organiza-

tion known as the Coiled Cabal, are searching for something

in Lhesper. Recently, they have begun enlisting the unwilling

aid of local tribesfolk and travelers to help with that search.

Humanoids taken to Lhesper are usually either sacricedtothe

yuan-ti deity or transformed into broodguards and tainted ones.

(See Serpent Kingdoms for more information on the yuan-ti

and the Coiled Cabal.)

Peleveran

The ruins of this ancient city are built into the side of the

Landrise, very near the point where the River Shaar emerges

from the subterranean portion of its journey. Peleveran was once

the capital of an ancient kingdom called Peleveria, which stretched

across the plains connecting the Landrise, the Firesteaps, and the

Shaarwood. The city was destroyed in the Year of the Dracorage

(1018 DR), when it became the site of a devastating conict

between two warring factions of the Cult of the Dragon.

A temple known as the Dark Pit of Malecence,dedicatedto

the demigod Gargauth, is hidden deep in the tunnels and caverns

beneath the city, inside an immense cavern that once served the

city as a granary. At the very bottom of the temple is a nearly

bottomless pit that sages suspect connects directly to Baator via

a portal.

Shaarmid (Large City)

Shaarmid is a free trading city with a population of about 23,500.

Its stout walls and formidable defensive forces make the city a

safe haven for merchants, who ock here from all points in the

region for protection from raiding tribes, bandits, and monsters

of the grasslands.

Shaarmids citizens claim no connection with or allegiance to

the tribes of the surrounding plains, though many are descended

from them. In fact, some privately embrace their heritage, but

they prefer that others not view them as biased in favor of their

former clans. A slight majority of the population is ethnically

pure Lapalian, and therefore closely related to the Tashalans.

The ancestors of these folk migrated here to found Shaarmid

after the fall of Lhesper in 640 DR.

Despite the refusal of Shaarmids citizens to show favorit-

ism, the tribes accept them as long-time allies because of their

reputation for brokering the best deals possible with traders from

other lands. The markets of Shaarmid have become a little less

wholesome of late because of the illicit trade that has been

trickling down from Innarlith since Ransar Pristoleph came to

power there (see Innarlith in Chapter 12), but this change has

attracted little attention so far.

Heroes and Monsters

Characters of many races can hail from the Shaar. Among the

nomadic tribes, Shaarans, centaurs, wemics, loxo, and thri-kreen

are all possibilities. Other human ethnicities, as well as half-elves,

elves, gnomes, halings,dwarves,andhalf-orcscouldoriginate

in any of the trading cities scattered across the grasslands. Most

gold dwarf characters hail from the Great Rift, as does the oc-

casional gnome, though the Rathgaunt Hills are a more likely

place of origin for gnome characters. A gnoll character could have

grown up in and around the Dun Hills, and under extraordinary

circumstances, even a wild elf from the Misty Vale might go

adventuring.

The Misty Vale region, the Loxo region, and the Thri-Kreen

region are all new for the Shaar. Many of the new feats, including

the various rage-based and tribal membership feats, are appropri-

ate for characters originating from this area.

Among the prestige classes detailed in Chapter 2, The Great

Rift deep defender is appropriate for gold dwarves. The Great

Rift skyguard (see Races of Faern) is also quite suitable for a

gold dwarf character from this region. A rock gnome character

might be attracted to the breachgnome prestige class (see Races

of Faern), and a human might want to become a Shaaryan

hunter (see Players Guide to Faern).

The Shaar is teeming with all sorts of dangerous creatures. Of

the new monsters detailed in Chapter 5, beguilers, cyclopes, loxo,

mantimeras, rattleyrs, starsnakes, and thri-kreen are appropriate

for this area. Other common monsters include gnolls, behirs,

ankhegs, wemics, centaurs, wyverns, perytons, and manticores.

174

T he Shining South cuts a broad swath across Faern,

stretching for more than 2,000 miles along the

coast of the Great Sea and covering nearly 1,000

miles from north to south at its widest point. The lands of

Dambrath, Durpar, Estagund, the Great Rift, Halruaa, Luiren,

the Shaar, Var the Golden, and Veldorn are bordered by numerous

kingdoms, forests, and mountain ranges that the people of the

Shining South trade with, war with, or just eye warily. To the

east, Ulgarth looms as both a longtime threat and a potential

trading partner, and beyond that is the Utter East. To the north

lie the Firesteap Mountains and the Chondalwood, the warring

nations of Unther and Mulhorand, and the desolation known

as the Plains of Purple Dust. To the west, the Shining Sea,

the kingdom of Lapaliiya, and the mysterious Mhair Jungles

form a line that serves as a boundary for the area known as

the Shining South.

The Border Kingdoms

and the Lake of Steam

Just north of the Shaars far western end is a stretch of coastline

along the Lake of Steam that is occupied by a handful of small

realms known as the Border Kingdoms. Despite the name, these

realms dont truly border on anything except one another, and

their boundaries are constantly in ux because the local rulers

(mostly adventurers) rise and fall with the changing of the seasons.

The common folk who dwell in this area make their livings by

logging, mining, and shing.Theydontpaymuchattentionto

who the local lord is, since they know full well that the ruler

who arises today might well be replaced tomorrow.

The nomads of the Shaar rarely ride this far west because

the Border Kingdoms oernothingthatcantbeobtainedmore

easily deeper in the grasslands. The barrier formed by the River

Scelptar makes the area an even less inviting target for raids.

Still, a healthy level of trade passes through the Border Kingdoms

from both directions, since caravans moving between the Shining

175

South and Calimshan, Tethyr, and beyond often stop here. Some

of these traders follow the road around the shore of the Lake of

Steamcrossing the Strait of Storms between Theymarsh and

Thuldolphorwhile others brave the stinking yellow waters and

foul inhabitants of the lake itself, crossing to the north shore to

trade with the cities there.

On a regular basis, adventurer lords from the Border Kingdoms

ride out from their small keeps and fortresses into the Shaar, seek-

ing adventure to further whatever long-range goals they espouse.

In most cases, the nomads leave them be, since they are usually

on their way elsewhere and not worth confronting. Sometimes,

however, adventurers are drawn into one of the tribal skirmishes

or territorial wars that frequently rage across the grasslands. In

such a case, the more heroic adventurers usually feel compelled to

take sides, while the less savory ones provide weapons and magic

to both sides in hopes of prolonging the conict. Typically, the

tribesfolk eventually grow tired of the adventurers meddling

and resolve their dierences on their own, then turn on the

interlopers and chase them out of the Shaar.

The Duskwood

and the Querth Forest

A signicant portion of the land encompassed by the Border

Kingdoms is shrouded in forest, and nomads from the Shaar

have long been gathering herbs and hunting for food and water in

these regions. In recent years, however, some woodland-oriented

adventurers visiting the Border Kingdoms have begun to settle the

fringes of these forests. The Shaarans consider the Duskwood and

the Querth Forest part of their traditional lands and do not look

Border Areas

happily upon the encroachment of druids, rangers, and reclusive

sorcerers in those areas. The more adventurers who settle there,

the more volatile the situation becomes, and a number of major

skirmishes have occurred in recent years.

The Chondalwood

This long stretch of forest runs from the north side of the Shaar

past the north end of the Landrise and behind the Firesteap

Mountains, extending all the way to the coast of the Vilhon

Reach. Though much of this woodland is beyond the area known

as the Shining South, the southern end of it ankstheOldRoad,a

trade route that connects Chondath with many locales throughout

the Shaar. At the very southern tip of the grasslands, the Old

Road and the Road of Dust merge at Hardcastle.

The denizens of the Chondalwood actively discourage out-

siders from entering its deep, dark interior. In addition to the

usual dangerous animalssuch as snakes, spiders, tigers, and so

forththe forest houses numerous dangerous plants and plant

creatures. Various fungi and mushrooms, as well as mistletoe

and other parasitic plants, are prominent along the forest oor.

Shambling mounds, tendriculoses, assassin vines, and other evil

vegetable creatures also sprout here from time to time. But the

true menaces to foreigners traveling these woods are the satyrs,

centaurs, wild elves, and feral ghostwise halings. In addition,

rumors that a sizable contingent of giants has settled here have

been drifting through the nearby towns of late.

The druids who live in the Chondalwood jointly watch over

the woodland and keep it healthy. Their enclave, which is even

more secretive and aloof than most such groups, has assembled

various kinds of creatures into patrols and instructed them to

watch for and be wary of any groups other than trade caravans

that pass along the Old Road. When evidence of adventurers or

loggers comes to light, the creatures begin a campaign of terror

against the encroachment, making menacing sounds and display-

ing strange lights in hopes of scaring o intruders before they

set foot beneath the forest canopy. When that doesnt work, the

creatures do not hesitate to take more aggressive action.

Ruthien-Than

The legend of an ancient elf city hidden deep inside the Chondal-

wood has been told around campresforcenturies.Thestories

vary as to exactly where the city is, but most versions have a

few common threads. The elves lived openly in the forest for

several millennia in a number of tree-cities. They traded with the

humans who were settling along the forests fringes at rst,but

when logging began in earnest, the elves tried to stop it. After a

terrible defeat against a united force of humans, the remaining

elves retreated deep into the middle of the forest, supposedly to

the hidden city of Ruthien-Than. Some say that this city was

abandoned during the Elven Retreat, while others claim it never

existed in the rstplace.Noonehasbeenabletondanyevidence

of this ancient city so far, though many have looked.

The Firesteap

Mountains

The Firesteap Mountains stretch from the tip of the Lake of

Steam eastward to the Landrise and the Chondalwood, then

continue along the northern boundary of the Shaar to connect

with the lands beyond. As mountains go, the Firesteap range

is not terribly forbidding or monster-infested, nor are its peaks

particularly high. On the south side, Shaaryan tribes have claimed

the foothills as sacred burial grounds, and the tombs of their

ancestors are thickly scattered throughout the entire stretch of

ridges there.

The nomads do not tolerate anyone entering these moun-

tainsnot even members of rival tribes that do not claim

traditional rights to the site. Anyone they nd trespassing in

the region is attacked on sight and driven o or killed. On the

north side, bandits and intelligent monsters such as hobgoblins

and ogres make a nuisance of themselves by attacking caravans

along the various trade routes that snake through the area.

The Old Road from Chondath skirts the northern boundary

of the mountains, squeezing between the Firesteaps and the

Chondalwood, while the Golden Road out of Sespech actually

runs right through a narrow pass on the western end of the

ridge. The militias of both Torsh in the east and Innarlith in the

west send out regular patrols to prevent raiders from completely

overrunning the roads.

Innarlith (Metropolis)

Innarlith occupies the far eastern tip of the Lake of Steam,

just north of the Firesteap Mountains. For the right price, any

commodity can be purchased here, including illegal goods such

as poison, narcotics, and slaves.

The recent ascension of Ransar Pristoleph (LE male Chon-

dathan human wizard 12) to rulership of the city has brought

about some fundamental changes in the dynamics of the region.

First and foremost, Ransar likes his creature comforts, and

he vehemently dislikes anything that prevents caravans from

getting into or out of his city. Thus, he has taken an aggressive

approach to dealing with the raiders who hide in the Firesteaps

and attack the trade trac on the Golden Road. Ransar has

begun sending large military forces into the mountains to hunt

down and kill any sentient being that doesnt have a legitimate

reason for being thereand a few that do, just to be on the safe

side. Furthermore, because of Pristolephs secret ties to Cyric

and his eorts to subvert most of the major trading houses to

his cause, more and more of Innarliths illicit trade has been

spreading southward, to Shaarmid.

176

Border Areas

Lapaliiya

Lapaliiya is a confederation of city-states along the southeastern

shore of the Shining Sea. It stretches from the eastern end of the

Delphin Mountains to the Sheir Peninsula, and from the shores

of the Shining Sea to the northern edge of the Mhair Jungles,

the Walls of Halruaa, the western edge of the Bandit Wastes,

and the peaks of the Dun Hills. Loosely ruled by the Overking

of Sheirtalar, these small realms are sometimes known as the

Lapal League or the Cities of the Seabreeze, though the latter

name technically also includes Narubel, Tashluta, Ormpur, and

the ruins of Procalith. But the city-states that compose this nation

are a fractious lot, and conictamongthem(bothovertpolitical

confrontations and covert machinations) is more prevalent than

disputes with neighboring countries.

Each city-state in Lapaliiya has a civic deity, and its citizens

discourage all other faiths. The dark deity of Lapalian myth is

Amphisbaena the World Serpent, who has wrapped the world in his

coils and is slowly crushing it into pulp as he devours himself.

Today, Lapaliiya is inhabited mostly by Shaaryans and Cal-

ishites, and Tashalans make up only a small minority. Regardless

of their ethnicity, Lapaliiyans are zealous warriors and industrious

merchants who place tremendous value on personal honor and

propriety. Duels and feuds over slights that folk of other lands

might readily dismiss are common. Clerics and monks enjoy

positions of respect and authority in Lapaliiya, while arcane

spellcasters are viewed with some suspicionan attitude that

dates back to the Rage of Wizards (1142 DR).

Lapaliiyans consider serpentfolk the greatest threat to their

lives and property. Such creatures are slain on sight if they reveal

themselves as such, and overt dealings with them are punishable

by death. Nevertheless, the yuan-ti wield considerable inuence

in Lapaliiya, and ocialsroutinelyoverlooksuspiciousdealings

involving persons with signicant political strength.

In centuries past, Lapaliiya was a nation in name only,

ruled by an essentially powerless Grand Council composed of

the satraps of the ve most powerful city-states. The union of

the ruling houses of Sheirtalar and Lushpool in the Year of

Glad Tidings (1147 DR), occurring as it did in the immediate

aftermath of the Rage of Wizards, led to the installation of a

rulerthe Overking of Lapaliiya. In addition to ruling the cities

of Sheirtalar and (through the heir to the throne) Lushpool, the

overking theoretically governs all Lapaliiya with the consent

of the Grand Council, which can vote on the policy he sets

forth but cannot initiate its own decrees. In practice, however,

the overking must still secure unanimous consent from the

representatives of Sammaresh, Ithmong, Lushpool, Sheirtalar,

and Uzurr for any new policies, and this process usually involves

negotiating with the reigning Shoonsar of Ithmong and the

Satraps of Lushpool.

Ormpur (Large City)

Also known as Ormpar in the local vernacular, the City of Saf-

fron (population 24,612) lies at the head of Ormpur Bay on the

eastern end of the Shining Sea. Ruled by High Suikh Helbareim

the Storm Wind Alanasker, the city is known for its produc-

tion of saron. In fact, Ormpur Bay is the only spot in Faern

where the crocus owerneededtoproducethisrarespicegrows

in abundance. Unlike Lapaliiya to the south, the majority of

the human population here is of Tashalan origin. The dierence

in ethnicity stems from the fact that Ormpur has never been

conquered by Shaaryan nomadsprimarily because those folk

have always been welcomed in the citys markets.

Ormpur has long been a powerful and independent city-state,

thanks to a long-standing alliance with a clutch of chromatic

wyrmlings. Even during the era of the Shoon Imperium, Ormpur

retained its nominal independence via careful diplomatic maneu-

vering in the court of the qysars and the unspoken threat posed

by its wyrmling-mounted cavalry. In recent times, however,

bloody inghtingamongtheroyaltyofthecitycombinedwith

a number of other unfortunate events has reduced Ormpur from

a great city to the lesser realm that it is today. Although it still

retains its nominal independence, Ompur is increasingly falling

under the sway of the Overking of Lapaliiya.

Sheirtalar (Metropolis)

The Shining City by the Sea (population 52,135) sits at the head

of Sheir Bay on the northern end of the much larger Talar Bay,

which is located at the foot of the Sheir peninsula. The land slopes

sharply down to meet the waters, allowing those arriving on ships

to see almost all the city at once. The citys apt nickname arises

from the fact that most of the prominent buildings are domed

and leafed in silver and gold.

Sheirtalar is the capital of Lapaliiya and the largest and most

powerful of the confederated city-states. Its ruler is the Overking

of Lapaliiya, Shaliim Wyrmslayer (CN male Tashalan human

ghter5/sorcerer5/eldritchknight7).TheDomedPalaceofthe

Overking, the most prominent of Sheirtalars landmarks, sits

atop a granite outcropping in the upper third of the city. The

Gilt House of Gleaming Coins, the temple dedicated to Waukeen,

the citys civic deity, is also incredibly opulent. Because most

trade goods exiting the Shaar for western Faern pass through

this port, it has become one of the most cosmopolitan cities in

the South.

For more information on Lapaliiya, see Serpent Kingdoms.

The Mhair Jungles

The Mhair Jungles lie between the Lapal Sea and the West Wall

of Halruaa. This expanse of dark, tropical forest contains all

manner of plant, animal, and monster lifemost of it unknown

anywhere else, and much of it deadly. The yuan-ti, who consider

these jungles sacred, come here to hunt, scour the ancient ruins

of their ancestors, and drive o intruders. The northern Mhair

Jungles are also the preserve of dire tigers, digesters, and many

nomadic tribes of wild dwarf hunters. The wetter southern reaches

eventually give way to vast mangrove swamps hunted by solitary

sword spiders and nagahydras.

Many yuan-ti lair in the Mhair Jungles

Yuan-ti dwell in and among the ruins of Mhairshaulk, and

other major ruins are claimed by solitary Faernian ha-nagas and

nagahydras. Lesser ruins are uncommon on the surface because

the jungle growth has wholly devoured them over the course of

millennia. Scattered sinkholes throughout the Mhair Jungles

lead into the Serpent Deeps, and explorers are advised to watch

out for sinkhole traps set by dwarf hunters.

For more information on the Mhair Jungles, see Serpent

Kingdoms.

Mulhorand

Once a sprawling empire that included much of eastern Faern,

Mulhorand is now but a shadow of what it was at its height.

Despite its general decline and the fact that mortal leaders have

replaced its former deic rulers, Mulhorand is still a mighty

nation and a potential threat to any country in its vicinity.

Fortunately for the nomads of the Shaar, most of Mulhorands

attention has been turned north and west, rather than south.

Thay was once a part of the Mulhorandi Empire, and the Mulan

of both nations still remember that fact. Mulhorand has also

been a traditional enemy of Unther, and Mulhorandi forces have

recently invaded that country and nearly conquered it.

Because so much time, attention, and resources have been

devoted to other interests, Mulhorands leaders have given little

consideration to the possibility of southward expansion. In fact,

the nomads have beneted from the current situation, since

Mulhorand requires a steady stream of trade goods to equip and

feed its armies in Unther. The ow of goods and coin back and

forth between Mulhorand and the Golden Water region would

be even greater if not for the monster problem in Veldorn, and

the Mulhorandi are sure to address that issue at some point in

the future.

The Dragonsword Mountains

This narrow band of mountains divides Mulhorand from the

Plains of Purple Dust. Since its peaks are infested with sphinxes,

grions,yrthaks,andseveralbluedragons,itservesasaneective

barrier between those two regions. The mountains jut down into

the fringes of the Shaar, and the only navigable route from the

Golden Water to Mulhorand and back again passes between the

tip of the range and Azulduth, the Lake of Salt.

The small city of Mishtan, which serves as a gateway to the

City of the Dead, marks the end of the trade road from parts

south. Ruled by clergy dedicated to Osiristhe Mulhorandi deity

of the deadMishtan serves as a base of operations for the

continual construction of the City of the Dead. Mishtan houses

the workers who build the tombs, and its warehouses store supplies

and food, a substantial portion of which comes from the south.

The City of the Dead, where the Mulhorandi have tradition-

ally buried their honored dead, lies a little east of Mishtan,

178

Border Areas

nestled in the foothills at the southern end of the Dragonsword

Mountains. Tombs, obelisks, and other grand features jut up

from the low hills here, and such structures would be inviting

targets for tomb robbers and adventurers if not for the swarms

of zombies and skeletons housed in the nishedtombs.Thefew

brave souls who do try to steal the riches sealed in the graves

often inadvertently release undead to roam the foothills, and

occasionally these creatures venture west into Mishtan or south

toward the trade route.

The Plains of

Purple Dust

Like Raurin, the Dust Desert, the Plains of Purple Dust consist

of a vast wasteland marked by blowing sand and buried ruins.

Reputedly formed when deities of Unther and Mulhorand battled

one another, the sand is said to be faintly magical, though no one

can agree on its exact properties. Despite the rumors of fell magic

and the perils of a wind-torn desert, the plains are not completely

uninhabited. Hardy nomads roam along the far western fringe,

staying just close enough to the foothills of the Dragonsword

Mountains to ndwaterandgame,butfarenoughawaytoavoid

the worst of the predators that live on the mountain slopes.

In fact, the dangers of the Plains of Purple Dust go far

beyond the scorching sun, lack of water, and blinding sandstorms.

Mammoth purple worms lair in the sands, rising up like massive

snakes to devour anything and everything that comes within

range. These behemoths can easily best any creature except the

largest and most cunning dragons of the region.

Once part of the Imaskar Empire, the Plains of Purple

Dust still hide many of that ancient nations secrets. Numerous

ruins are scattered across its surface, and abundant routes lead

down through the sand and rock into the Underdark below.

Wedged between the Earthroot region and Deep Raurin, the

area of the Underdark below the Plains of Purple Dust is home

to several erce and cruel tribes of lizardfolkcreatures that

havent seen the light of day in centuries, if not millennia.

These scaly beings routinely bring old Imaskari magic to bear

in defense of their caverns, utilizing items of power unheard

of in modern-day Faern.

The Shining Sea

Except for the Sea of Fallen Stars, the Shining Sea supports

the most merchant trac of any body of water in or around

Faern. A signicant portion of its commerce runs directly to

the eastern tip of the sea, to Lapaliiya and the independent city-

state of Ormpur. Those ports function as staging points between

the seagoing tracandtheoverlandcaravans,whichtransport

goods throughout the Shining South. As a result, goods from

the Chultan Peninsula, Calimshan, and as far away as the Sword

Coast make their way into the western end of the Shaar, through

the Talath Pass into Halruaa, and into still other areas of the

Shining South. Even vessels that have ventured as far away as

Maztica often bring strange and exotic items to the markets of

the Shining South via the Shining Sea.

Ulgarth

Though geographical proximity might lead some to consider

Ulgarth part of the Golden Water region, the marked dierences

between this nation and the others on the bay are signicant

enough to merit its classication as a separate realm. In many

ways, Ulgarth is an isolated nation, bounded on the north by

the Dustwall, on the west by Durpar and the Golden Water, on

the south by the Great Sea, and on the east by the vast plains of

the Utter East. Like the other ospring countries of the Raurin

Empire, Ulgarth endured centuries of dark barbarism after that

great nation was destroyed. Little technological or commercial

development occurred here while rival tribes from the Shining

South and beyond waged countless small wars on this region.

Finally, after the bloodshed had reduced the local population to a

fraction of its previous size, the people of the Ulgarth region grew

tired of war and turned to agrarian pursuits. The nation developed

a highly structured caste system consisting of lords who owned

the land and peasants who worked it on the lords behalf.

Today, Ulgarth is a traditional monarchy ruled by King Drasna

Bluemantle (LG male human aristocrat 6/ghter8)anddivided

into six distinct baronies. The barons who oversee these sections

must provide troops to aid in the defense of the country, and they

engage in heavy trade to pay for the support these armies.

As with its neighbors on the bay, much of Ulgarths wealth and

prosperity stems from the trade on the Golden Water. The nation

has become a strong exporter of crops, shipping foodstus to

many other regions along the southern coast of Faern. Ulgarths

proximity to the ocean moderates the inland temperatures, and

the almost daily rain and generally humid climate result in rich,

fertile cropland.

The rulership and governmental policy in Ulgarth are very

localized. The barons oversee most of the law enforcement,

trials, and punishment of criminals. Religion is not as dominant

in Ulgarth as it is elsewhere in the Golden Water area, and

priests do not play as active a role in making and enforcing

the laws. The people strongly believe in a clear separation of

secular and spiritual roles, and they feel that a persons worldly

behavior should not be the purview of the temples. But even

so, those who dispense justice recognize the value of a good

truth-seeking spell, and they often call on priests or mages who

can wield such magic.

Ulgarths criminal system is quite strict. Any citizen found

guilty of a capital crime is usually sentenced to a quick death

and executed. For a lesser crime, the guilty party can choose

between enforced service in the army, working a barons elds,or

serving a prison sentence. Few choose prison, though service in

the army often means patrolling the eastern border of Ulgarth

and watching for invading hordes of barbarians from the Utter

East. Once a criminal has served her sentence, her record is clean,

and she is free to resume her position in society with no stigma

of any kind.

The population of Ulgarth is overwhelmingly human, though

other races are more than welcome here. Few elves, dwarves,

gnomes, or halings feel comfortable in the feudal society of

Ulgarth, though, so those who do visit tend to attract attention

from the locals. A few dwarves live in the local mountain ranges

179

Border Areas

and work the mines there, but they are distinctly separate from

the rest of Ulgarths society and rarely mingle with the humans

except to trade. Other humanoids are not welcome in Ulgarth,

particularly since the country has had a history of trouble with

incessant raiding by the gray orcs of the Dustwall. Most of the time,

humanoids other than those noted above are slain on sight.

Ulgarth and Durpar have a hostile history that has only

recently been put to rest in favor of peaceful relations. Though

the two nations have nally found a means of understanding

one another, the Ulgarthans still maintain a strongly fortied

border with their neighbor to the northwest.

Kelazzan (Large Town)

Kelazzan (population 5,000) is both the southernmost and the

westernmost community in Ulgarth. Because the countrys naval

shipyards are based here, the port is much larger than a city its

size would normally support. Most of the residents make their

livings constructing and maintaining ships, but a considerable

number work in government operations.

The baron of this region is Larid Herokimal (LG male human

paladin 13), a war hero and devoutly religious man. He does

not foist his beliefs on his people, but he does insist that those

who would live within in his barony abide by what he considers

a just and fair system of laws. He does not tolerate criminal

activity, and he devotes an unusually high level of resources to

rooting out and eliminating thieves and other miscreants. On

the brighter side, the baron also wishes to see everyone partake

of the fruits of his own labor as much as possible. This attitude

does not stem from any noble notion that all people are equal in

stationHerokimal just feels that no one should be allowed to

take unjust advantage of another or prevent another from taking

advantage of opportunities. As a result, trade is brisk, and the

living conditions within Kelazzan are uncommonly pleasant.

Orvyltar (Large City)

Situated on Copper Bay (so named because its water does not

appear quite as golden as that of the larger bay to the north),

the capital of Ulgarth is also the site of King Bluemantles vast

estates. Orvyltar (population 21,000) is also Ulgarths primary

trade link with the rest of the world, and commercial sea trac

is very heavy through its port, which is defended by nearly two

dozen warships. In addition to its strong naval presence, Orvyltar

maintains a sizable standing army, and three massive towers

protect its harbor, each equipped with a huge ballista that can

re a quarter-mile out into the bay.

Sizable quantities of foodstusandpreciousmetalsleavethe

port each day, and luxury goods of similar value arrive. The

marketplace in central Orvyltar is not quite as large as those in

the Durpari cities, but the trade is just as vigorous. Ulgarthans

are happy to conduct business with the Durpari these days, and

though their neighbors to the northwest still get the better of

most deals, the Orvyltarans have become commercial masters

in their own right.

Unther

Once just as mighty and proud as Mulhorand to the east, Unther

is now a nation divideda broken image of its former glory torn

apart by civil unrest and invasion. After the fall of Gilgeam and

the military invasion by Mulhorand, Unthers people are both

terried of what the future holds and hopeful that a new way

of life is on the horizon. Resentful of the decades of division

between the haves and have-nots, commoners have turned on

the clergy. Law and civility have fallen by the wayside as people

struggle to take what they need to survive by force or theft. The

resulting chaos has driven many refugees out of Unther ahead

of the approaching Mulhorandi armies.

Those refugees who have ed down into the Shaar have

discovered that the journey across the open grasslands to other

places is both long and perilous. Many of those who have not

succumbed to the elements have either been captured by tribal

raiding parties and sold as slaves or slain outright for trespassing

on sacred lands. Others have managed to reach nearby trading

communities, where they struggle to nd work or hope to join

caravans heading elsewhere.

The war has also served as a boon for traders moving up into

Unther from the south. Initially, Untherian soldiers needed sup-

plies to defend their homeland, and after they were driven back,

the Mulhorandi forces needed the same sorts of goods. Weapons

from the Great Rift, food from Var the Golden, and even some

magic from Halruaa has made its way into the war-torn regions

of southern Unther to aid in the conict and feed the refugees.

The Black Ash Plain

Named for the thick layer of volcanic detritus that constantly

showers down from the Smoking Mountains to the north, the

Black Ash Plain is home to sizable populations of brown dragons

and ash giants (stone giants with black, dusty skin). A number of

refugees from the Untheric-Mulhorandi conictwereforcedto

eethroughthisarea,andthosewhomanagedtogetthrough

unscathed insist that they saw several ruined buildings jutting

up from the ashy ground. Those who claim to have taken refuge

in those ruins almost universally claim that substantial works

exist below the surface of the ground. No one, however, was

brave (or foolish) enough to venture into the subterranean levels

to nd out more.

The Green Lands

In normal seasons, the fertile elds in this region of Unther are

magically enhanced to produce crop yields sucient to feed a

good portion of the nation. During the invasion, however, the

Green Fields were churned to mud and the crops ruined. To avoid

widespread famine and possible rioting among the locals, the

Mulhorandi forces imported large quantities of food from the

south, particularly the Shining Lands and Luiren. As a result,

trade in foodstushasbeenmorebriskthanusualthroughout

the Shining South.

180

Places of interest to adventurers abound in and around

the lands of the Shining South. From the ancient ruins

of forgotten cultures to vibrant city streets in every

port along the coast, opportunities for heroism can be found

without much diculty. The inux of treasure and magic from

newly discovered monster hoards, abandoned cities, and forgotten

tombs have as much impact on the local economies as commerce

and trade. The region is as well known for its adventure as its

harsh environments and unique cultures.

This chapter details three short, site-based adventure areas.

The Astral Inn depicts a Halruaan tavern and inn, its propri-

etor, and his unusual pastime. Bandit Camp describes a hidden

encampment of highway robbers in the Forest of Amtar and

its denizens. Dwarven Crypt details a forgotten gold dwarf

burial chamber.

The Astral Inn

At the main crossroads of the farming village of Eichul in

Halruaa sits a popular pub and hostelthe Astral Inn. Owned

by Pirsnil Fireleap (whose statistics are at the end of this section),

the Astral Inn is a cozy place where one can nd a ne drink or

meal and get a room for the night. Of course, being in Halruaa,

the Astral Inn is also lled with all manner of unusual and (in

the eyes of some outsiders) frivolous magic. Pirsnil has made a

point of taking advantage of every possible comfort, installing a

variety of magic enhancements in his inn to attract customers.

For the most part, his eortshaveworked.Thetaproomislled

every afternoon and evening until closing, and nearly every room

is rented on most nights.

Prices for food and lodging at the Astral Inn are double

those listed on Table 78: Goods and Services, page 128 of the

Players Handbook; meals and inn stays rate as good. However,

Pirsnil prices the drinks and common food more cheaply (the

same price as on Table 78) to keep the locals coming, and he

discounts rooms 10% when a patron wants to rent by the week.

Pirsnil also hires himself out for spellcasting on occasion.

181

The Ground Floor

The main oor of the Astral Inn includes the common room,

the bar, the kitchens, and the storage rooms othekitchen.They

are all described below.

1. Common Room

The common room, or taproom, is lledwithbothwoodentrestle

tables with matching benches and round tables with chairs. Unlike

most taverns in the northerly climes of Faern, which are often

dark, re-warmedaairswithdeepshadowsandplentyoflantern

smoke, the Astral Inns main room is open and airy. Every wall

is set with wide windows that let in plenty of light, and theyre

kept open to allow breezes in when the weather is mild. To keep

the insects out at such times, the windows are covered with wire

mesh screens fashioned by the gold dwarves of the Great Rift.

During the long, hot part of the year, the windows stay shut.

Instead of natural cooling, Pirsnil uses a magical system built into

his twin replaces (which are just for show; they never actually

get used for res). Each chimney can be cooled on command

with a Darssons chilling chamber. Another command activates

a Darssons cooling breeze, sending a slight draft down the ue

and out into the room. In this way, the temperature is pleasantly

cool all day long, and the taproom is a popular place to spend

the heat of the day.

An iron golem named Clang stands stoically in full view,

serving as the Astral Inns bouncer. Constructed with the help

of gold dwarves and an iron golem manual, Clang is dwarikein

appearanceonly 4 feet tall and much broader than would be

proportional for a human gure.Thegolemsimposingformis

a reminder that Pirsnil brooks no trouble in his inn, but Clang

Adventure Sites

has been instructed not to use lethal force unless someone deals

it real damage. It simply escorts oenders out the doors and

bars them further entry. In the history of the inn, Clang has

only removed a single patron who was too drunk to control

himself (or to think rationally about facing an iron golem).

The interior of the room is lit at regular intervals along the

walls, ceiling, and at each table with dierentgemsuponwhich

continual ame has been cast. These magical lights stay soft and

low during the day, but the lights begin to rise as dusk nears.

When darkness falls fully, the inn is illuminated with a rainbow

of colored light.

Once in a while, a patron tries to steal a continual ame gem

or two, but Pirsnil can tell when the lighting dynamics of the

room change. A shouted warning, including a reminder of Clangs

presence, always sees the stone returned to its proper place.

Clang: Medium Iron golem; hp 129; see page 136 of the

Monster Manual and adjust statistics for the golems size.

2. Bar

The bar stretches across the wall next to the doors leading into

the kitchen and under the stairs leading to the second oor.Pirsnil

spends most of his time here, keeping an eye on his establishment.

He has several small iron compartments beneath the bar, which

are permanently imbued with Darssons chilling chamber spells,

where he keeps beverages cool and ice on hand.

Above the bar, on the back wall, Pirsnil has installed a special

display case. The entire case is made of 1-inch-thick glassteel

(hardness 20, 40 hit pointssee page 158 of Races of Faern for

more information) and protected by a lock of the highest quality

(Open Lock DC 40). In addition, the case itself is a wondrous

item that radiates an antimagic eld to protect its contents and

radiating 1 foot in every direction. (As a magic item, the case

has a +7 bonus on Fortitude saves against any blow that might

break it.)

Inside the case, Pirsnil has one of his most prized possessions

on displaya zarangan that dates back to the time of Netheril

(its unique properties are described in a separate entry at the end

of this section). Furthermore, Pirsnil places an audible version

of the alarm spell on the zarangan each day, which goes o if

anyone other than him touches the item. Of course, the alarm

wont sound immediately, since the zarangan is inside the inu-

ence of the antimagic eld, but it sounds loud and clear once the

stone is taken out of that zone.

3. Kitchen

The food that the Astral Inn serves is prepared here. The room

is equipped with several tables, as well as a large stone oven

that has Darssons ery furnace cast on it each morning. Pirsnil

employs three cooks and two serving girls, but all ve can do

either job. Much of the fare of the Astral Inn includes smoked

sh from the coast, cuts of meat from the herds in the Nath,

and a wide assortment of pickled fruits and vegetables imported

from Luiren.

4. Pantry

Food items that do not need any special preservation are kept here.

Such items include dried and smoked meats, sacks of our,herbs,

some vegetables, crockery, and pots and pans for cooking.

5. Cooling Chamber

This room has thick, insulated walls and

has been augmented with a permanent

Darssons chilling chamber spell to keep

a variety of food cold and fresh. Eggs,

meat, poultry, sh, extra barrels of

beverages, cheeses, and other vegetables

can be found here.

6. Pirsnil Fireleaps

Quarters

Pirsnil occupies these chambers. The

door is secured with an amazing lock

(Open Lock DC 40), which is also a

wondrous item crafted using an arcane

lock spell. The arcane lock allows

Pirsnil to pass, and he has a key for

the mechanical one. Every window has

been enhanced with arcane lock as well,

and the whole room is warded with a

permanent alarm (mental version).

Finally, Pirsnil keeps a pet Halruaan behir

herea beautiful, topaz-yellow specimen

named Shaprak that likes to snooze

on a throw rug in the center of

the room.

The main sitting room holds

a pair of chairs, a writing desk and

stool, and numerous shelves with books,

displays, and knickknacks. A few wall

hangings liven up the place. None of Pirsnils really valuable items

are out in his rooms; he keeps those safely secured in a Hewards

handy haversack that he keeps on himself at all times.

Pirsnil has a cooling system in his room, much like that found

in the guest rooms (see area 8).

A. Closet and Washroom: Pirsnil keeps his personal belongings,

clothing, and so forth in here. He also maintains a washstand,

bath, and privy.

B. Bed Chamber: Pirsnils bed is here, along with a nightstand,

more bookshelves, and a 2-foot by 4-foot dressing mirror of

polished silver (1,000 gp).

Shaprak: Halruaan behir; hp 55; see page 61.

7. Storage Closets

Each of these compartments has clean linens, pillows, comfort-

ers, towels, and so forth for the guest rooms. The cabinets are

not locked.

8. Guest Rooms

These personal guest rooms are available for rent by the night or

the week. Each contains two beds, a writing table and one chair,

a washbasin and mirror, and a nightstand with a lantern.

The doors are secured with average locks (Open Lock DC 25),

but the locks are also wondrous items imbued with arcane lock

spells. Each magic lock has a command word that allows Pirsnil

to give it a password. The password negates the arcane lock for

183

The Astral Inn

10 rounds, or until the password is spoken again, and each locks

password can be changed by Pirsnil (only he knows the method

to change a locks password). When a guest rents the room, she

is given a key and a password to bypass the magic lock on her

room. Pirsnil changes the password after each guest checks out,

providing a new one to the next guest.

In the rafters, Pirsnil has installed small wooden ducts that

function much like the replaces in the taproom. When the

weather is hot, Pirsnil can activate the ducts so that chilled air

owsintotheroomseachday.Theductsaresmallenoughthat

only a Tiny creature could tthroughthem,andsteelgrillscover

the openings into each room.

The Game

Most folks dont know that Pirsnil has a twin brother named

Librad who lives halfway across Halruaa in another small town.

The two are currently playing a game. Each brother tries to steal

the zarangan and keep it from the other for the most time over

the span of a year. When one of the two succeeds in swiping

the item, the victim must wait at least a month before trying

to steal it back, to give the new owner time to devise security.

The lone caveat to the whole competition is that the zarangan

cannot be hidden in an extradimensional place, but it must be

kept in an accessible location and openly displayed by whomever

has possession of it.

Adventure Sites

Since Pirsnil currently has the zarangan in the Astral Inn,

Librad must steal it. The player characters might be visiting the

Astral Inn when the attempted theft takes place, or the party

could be hired by Librad to help him steal the item.

The Theft

Librad arrives inside the inn via teleport and under the eectof

greater invisibility. He releases a rust monster (see page 216 of

the Monster Manual) to attack Clang and distract the customers

and Pirsnil. The aberration is charmed via charm monster (from

days ago) and invisible (thanks to an invisibility spell Librad casts

on it before they arrive). While the rust monster drama plays

out, Librad approaches the case, pours very strong acid into the

lock, is rendered temporarily visible by the antimagic eld, grabs

the zarangan, moves away from the case, and then uses teleport

to escape. If all goes well, he is home with the zarangan before

the alarm has sounded for more than a moment or two. Should

luck be against him, Librad tries everything in his power to

get the zarangan and eewithoutharmingPirsnilscustomers.

Anyone who attacks Librad with lethal force, however, loses the

protection of the would-be thiefs limited scruples.

Pirsnil and Librad Fireleap

Born to farmers in the agricultural region near Talath Pass,

Pirsnil and Librad grew up with about as good an understand-

ing of magic as anyone. They both excelled in Halruaas arcane

tests, surpassed expectations in their formal tutoring in magic,

and probably would have ended up serving on the Council of

Elders if either had any inclination to do so. Unfortunately,

these twin brothers were too busy having a good time to worry

about politics. They both love practical jokes, especially at each

others expense.

The pair has spent most of their lives getting one over on

each other, coming to the point where heavy doses of magic have

become the norm in their elaborate games. Neither seems to

care who else gets caught in the crossre,thoughtheycertainly

dont intend to hurt anyone. Other powerful mages in the region,

especially a few who sit on the Council, frown deeply at Pirsnil

and Librads antics. Neither brother has yet caused severe enough

damage to person or property to make anyone take action.

against it with a natural or metal weapon takes 1d4 points

of electricity damage from the discharge.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): Umrad can deliver touch

spells for Pirsnil (see Familiars, page 52 of the Players

Handbook).

Dream Shield (Su): While asleep, Umrad generates an

aura that absorbs spells and spell-like abilities. Any targeted

spell directed at Umrad is absorbed and instantly converted

into electrical energy. This energy is discharged back at the

original caster in a bolt that deals 1d10 points of electricity

damage per level of the spell absorbed.

The bolt is 5 feet wide with a maximum range of 200 feet,

and a DC 20 Reexsavehalvesthedamage.Itcansetreto

combustibles and damage objects in its path. If the damage

caused to an interposing barrier breaks through that barrier,

the bolt may continue if range permits. Otherwise, the bolt

stops at the barrier. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Improved Evasion (Ex): If Umrad is exposed to any

eect that normally allows it to attempt a Reex saving

throw for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful

saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

verbally with Pirsnil. Other creatures do not understand the

communication without magical help.

Impromptu Sneak Attack (Ex): Once per day, Librad can

declare one sneak attack an impromptu sneak attack. The target

of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to Armor

Class, but only against that attack. The power can be used against

any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take

no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to

AC against the attack).

Pirsnils and Librads Zarangan

The Fireleaps zarangan is a translucent purple color, like an

amethyst. In addition to standard zarangan powers, the stone can

generate a cone of cold eectonceperhour,anditprovidesspell

immunity against shocking grasp and suggestion. The designated

home of this particular zarangan was one of the yingcitiesof

Netheril and no longer exists, so the word of recall power simply

deposits the wielder in the middle of the Anauroch desert, as close

to the former site of the city as the stone can manage.

Bandit Camp

The route that runs between the Channath Vale and the Great

Rift passes between a line of mountains and woodlands on one

side and the great Forest of Amtar on the other. It is a path

heavily used by caravans. Slow-moving groups of wagons are

easy prey for the bandits that hide in the fringes of the Amtar.

When such scoundrels spot a caravan that appears weak enough

to hit, they strike fast and melt away into the trees when their

raid is concluded.

These bandits maintain camps in the forest where they can

hide from patrols, count their loot, and wait until the next op-

portunity for plunder arises. What follows is a sample group of

bandits and their hidden locale. It can be placed anywhere along

the edge of the Forest of Amtars north side (or in the fringes

of any forest region that parallels a trade route).

The Reavers

The members of the Reavers are:

Tanushk The Grim One Versix

Blackteeth

Blackteeth doesnt know how he gained his sorcerous powers,

and he doesnt care. Spells give him an edge in combat that few

gnolls possess, and they are part of the reason Blackteeth is the

leader of the Reaver gnolls. He thinks Tanushk is too gloomy,

but he enjoys sharing bouts of bloodlust with Vaujer. (Blackteeths

familiar recently met a cruel end.)

Vaujer Gashe

Vaujer considered it a blessing from Garagos when the Reavers

attacked the caravan on which he rode. He immediately turned

on the caravan crew and fought alongside the bandits, letting

his battle rage do the talking for him. When it was all over,

Tanushk let the cleric join the Reavers, and Vaujer has been the

most enthusiastic member of the group ever since.

When the gang is not out on a raid, they can usually be found

in camp. Refer to the following descriptions for the members

locations. If the heroes attack the camp, leave, and return for a

second assault later, half of the human and gnoll reavers lost in

the previous battle have been replaced by new gnolls. The order

of the characters given above is the order of command for the

group, and the order of ascension to power should anyone higher

up on the list be killed.

Tactics: When attacking a caravan, the Reavers are straight-

forward, hiding in a anking position until the quarry arrives,

then hitting their foes hard with magic and ranged attacks before

charging. When pursued, the bandits use their winding trails (see

area 1 below) to outank enemies.

The Camp

The Reavers camp consists of a hidden hollow in a dense thicket

of brambles, vines, underbrush, and suth trees that create an

eective screening barrier 30 to 40 feet high. The thicket is

interspersed with twisting paths, many of which switch back

and dead end. Only one path leads to the interior of the camp,

188

Adventure Sites

and it is no wider or more easily discernible than the

false ones.

1. Meandering Trails

To ensure that pursuers cannot track the bandits too quickly,

Tanushk has the gnolls and warriors walk the fake paths

two or three times a week, leaving footprints and keeping

the plants trampled and clear. Thus, only a DC 30 Survival

check by someone with the Track feat reveals the dierences

between the real trail and the false ones.

2. Camp Entrance (EL 11)

The path empties into a small clearing with three very tall

zalantar trees, each with a treehouse built in the midst of

its eight trunks. Four crude huts are scattered about the

clearing beneath the trees. In the center of the hollow, the

bandits have set up a large, open re pit for cooking.

When interlopers enter the encampment, the bandits

likely have an ambush prepared. Vaujer, the gnolls, and the

warriors hide behind the huts, the gnolls and warriors ready

with ranged weapons and Vaujer with spells. Tanushk and

Blackteeth attack from the treehouses with spells, ranged

attacks, and magic items. Only after the bandits have ex-

hausted their ranged attacks do they engage in melee combat.

If things go badly for the Reavers, some slip out of the

camp by means of the secret path (area 4, below)Tanushk

might just y o.

3. Hut

Each of these four huts is made of crudely hewn logs lledwith

mud. They are dank and smelly inside, with dirt oors and little

furniture. The humans share two huts, while the gnolls get the

other two. Hidden in shallow holes in the oorortuckedinchinks

in the walls of each hut are 1d4 personal hoards, the shares of

treasure belonging to the warriors and gnolls. Each of these

collections can be found on a DC 15 Search check and consist

of a 1st-level treasure as generated on Table 35: Treasure, page

52 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

4. Escape Route

At this point in the wall of brambles and underbrush, a Medium

creature can squeeze through by crawling on hands and knees.

The Reavers use this escape route if the ghtinthecampbegins

to turn against them. Once through the escape route, they get

out into the forest and use the foliage to hide and evade until

pursuit lags behind.

5. Treehouses

Each of the treehouses sits high in the branches of the zalan-

tar tree in which it is built, 20 feet o the ground. The main

construction is a at, octagonal platform with a half wall on

almost every side, and a atroofoverhead.Aropeladderleads

to a hole in the middle the platform, allowing someone to climb

into the treehouse and to pull the ladder up afterward. Rope

bridges connect the three treehouses, and there are no half walls

where they attach.

189

Dwarf Crypt

This long-forgotten and tightly sealed tomb of a gold dwarf

aristocrat is a prime example of the exquisite craftsmanship and

superior eorts taken by that race to honor their dead. It has

remained undisturbed for untold centuries, well hidden by both

skilled stonework and abjuration magic. The heroes might be the

rst living creatures to enter the hallowed chambers in almost

a millennium.

This tomb is designed to be used practically anywhere. In the

Great Rift, it could be placed in an out-of-the-way area, perhaps

as part of an entire clans sacred burial vaults. Alternatively,

it could be located in any remote spot in any of the mountain

ranges in the Shining South. Maybe miners, who abandoned

a petering vein shortly after burying their comrade, built it.

Conceivably it was covered by a rockslide, and recent tectonic

activity has exposed it again. Whatever reasons for the tombs

past lack of discovery, it has spent its existence as a secret,

undisturbed by graverobbers.

The Crypt

The crypt was cut out of solid stone, a site of seamless granite

divined at the time of construction. The dwarves wanted to be

able to use a single piece of rock, rather than simply dig into a

segmented section and have to shore it up with supports. The angles

and measurements of every face, corner, and column are nearly

perfectany aws,ifsomeexist,cannotbeseenwiththenaked

eye. No additional stone was quarried elsewhere and brought into

this crypt. Dwarven craftsmen who built the tomb simply cut away

what didnt belong and left everything else. Thus, the columns, the

dais, and the ceremonial oeringbowlinthemainchamber,aswell

as the actual sarcophagus, were not placed there, but revealed as

everything around them was removed. In this way, the gold dwarves

who built the crypt believed they were honoring the stone in which

they intended to lay their companion to rest.

1. Entry Tunnel

This passage has been bored into the rock face so precisely that

the plug that llsitisthesamestonethatwasremovedtocreate

the passage in the rst place. The plug weighs more than 10

tons and ts so tightly in the passage that the seal is

airtightit can only be found with a DC 30 Search

check. Laid upon the stone is a permanent

nondetection spell.

The tunnel beyond the plug is only

5 feet wide and 5 feet high for its

entire length, tall enough to accom-

modate dwarven stonecutters. The

walls are perfectly smooth and

unadorned by any carvings or

other decorations. The dwarves

who tunneled out the burial

chamber almost certainly used

magical means to replace the

plug and seal the tomb.

2. Stone Trap (EL 8)

At this point in the passage, a

stone trap spell has been set to hold

up a large (5 feet by 5 feet, 6 inches

thick, weighing 2,100 pounds) panel

of granite right against the ceiling.

Since the panel is made invisible by the spell, it

cannot be seen, but it hangs down 6 inches below

the top of the tunnel, allowing someone to strike

a forehead on it before actually passing underneath. The spell

triggers when any living creature passes beneath the panel, caus-

ing it to fall.

Stone Trap: CR 8; spell; spell trigger (stone trap); no reset;

spell eect (stone trap, 13th-level cleric); Atk +13 melee (10d6);

Search DC 16 (half normal due to poor placement of the stone);

Disable Device DC 32.

3. Main Chamber

The entry passage ends at a second plug of stone after 25 feet.

This plug is not very thick and only weighs 500 pounds. It can

be moved aside only by shoving it into the room beyond, which

requires a DC 15 Strength check. Once the passage is cleared,

the tunnel opens into a well-lit room. Read the following aloud

to the players:

This chamber glows brightly from the re burning in

what appears to be a large stone bowl sitting atop a dais

in the middle of the room. Two steps high, the dais is

190

apparently cut from the same stone as the entry tunnel

and its two plugs. Around the dais are carved intricate

runes and patterns.

The chamber is about twice as wide as it is deep, with

a ceiling approximately ten feet overhead. Four stone

columns stand near the four corners, which are tapered

rather than square. Every surface of every wall has been

carved in runeslong passages of text, interspersed with

superbly rendered portraits of dwarven faces.

Along the back wall, opposite of the entrance, is yet

another stone plug.

The ames burning in the bowl

in  the  center  of  the  room  are

actually four adjacent continual

ame spells, arranged to appear

like one larger re. The text run-

ning along the walls and around

the dais is carved in Dwarven

with Dethek runes. Around the

dais are engraved prayers to Du-

mathoin for the protection of

the interred dwarf. The passages

on the walls include a history

and genealogical lineage of the

deceased, describing his exploits,

as well as those of his father,

brothers, uncles, and cousins.

Each individual has a portrait,

a set of guardians to watch over

their honored kin.

The curious can glean some in-

formation from the runes carved

into the walls of the chamber. The

dwarf buried in this tomb was named Rindorn

Starhelm. He served as a defender of the Great Rift,

but he was on a mission away from home when he

was killed by mountain trolls (and refused the call of

his cousins resurrection spell). His cousin (a cleric of

Dumathoin), two brothers, and two friends spent three months

carving out this set of chambers before burying Rindorn here.

The third stone plug is as large and heavy as the rst,

completely lling the 5-foot-long passage beyond.

4. Crypt (EL 9)

Before the heroes can get a decent look at the room, a mantimera

zombie attacks them. A mantimera was killed, brought here, and

animated by the Rindorns cousin. The gruesome creature is the

rooms only guardian.

Single Actions Only (Ex): Zombies have poor reexesandcan

perform only a single move action or attack action each round. A

zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round,

but only if it attempts a charge.

Once the mantimera zombie has been dealt with, the characters

can examine the chamber. It is almost completely featureless,

with seamless walls and a ceiling only 7 feet tall. Set against the

far wall of the chamber is a large sarcophagus.

Carved directly from the rock, the con was simply cut o

at the top and hollowed out, Rindorns body was placed inside and

a make whole spell was used to fuse the top back together with

the base. It is engraved with glittering runic patterns, and the lid

has been carved with an image of the dead dwarf inside, along

with his name and a blessing. Any who would see the inside of

the sarcophagus must devise a way to get inside through 1 foot

of solid stone on all sides (hardness 8, 180 hp, break DC 45).

Unfortunately, the runic patterns on the stone casket contain a

trap, triggered when the sarcophagus is touched.

waraxe, and a single red tear gem (900 gp).

Tomb Robbers (EL 10)

When the heroes nallyemergefromthecryptwiththetreasures

of Rindorns sarcophagus, read or paraphrase the following text:

Exiting the crypt, you see six beady-eyed bugbears grasping

morningstars. They stand in a semicircle outside the

crypt entrance, their faces twisted into sneers. A gru

voice from some unseen source calls out to you. You have

violated the crypt of Rindorn Starhelm. Well done. His

treasures, if you please.

A sly gold dwarf treasure-hunter named Vurak Shadowshield has

come to rob the PCs of their hard-earned treasure. Vurak works

for the church of Abbathor. With the aid of some divination spells,

Vurak has located the crypt and ascertained the easiest means of

acquiring the treasures within (robbing another group of tomb

robbers). Vurak stands 10 feet behind the line of bugbears and has

cast invisibility, mage armor, shield, bears endurance, and stoneskin

(from a scroll) on himself. He uses a ventriloquism spell to throw

his voice, making it dicultforPCswithoutseeinvisibilityspells

to pinpoint his location. He has also cast magic weapon on his club

and bulls strength on the 21-hp bugbear. During the rstround

of combat, he casts haste on himself and the bugbears.

Of the items in Rindorns sarcophagus, Vurak is most interested

in the masterwork dwarven waraxe. It doubles as a key that unlocks

a sealed vault built by the Starhelm clan deep in the Great Rift.

The Starhelms and Shadowshields are rivals, and Vurak seeks to

loot the secret Starhelm trove. Ironically, the greedy dwarf is less

interested in Rindorns magic items. If the PCs stubbornly cling

to their hard-earned treasures, Vurak tries to bargain for the

masterwork waraxe, claiming it belongs to his clan.

Vurak employs six surly bugbear mercenaries called the Rift-

reavers. If four of them fall in battle, Vurak ees via dimension

door. However, he doesnt go far; rather, he shadows the PCs as

best he can until an opportunity arises to snatch Rindorns axe.

Vurak appears as a broad-shouldered dwarf of typical height

draped in heavy robes. His toad familiar perished on a recent

expedition, and Vurak hasnt replaced it.

A Web Enhancement Adventure Site for THE SHINING SOUTH

Wemic

Camp

The Shining South is filled with information for players and Dun-

geon Masters whose campaigns feature adventures in the south of

Faernparticularly  in  Dambrath,  Estagund,  the  Shining  Lands,

the  Shaar,  the  Great  Rift,  Halruaa,  Luiren,  and  the  Border  King-

doms. These exotic and mysterious lands are ripe with adventuring

possibilities, and their cultures are rich and deep.

You  need  not  set  an  fntire  campaign  in  the  Shining  South  to

make  use  of  this  product.  Dharacters  can  travel  the  length  and

breadth  of  Faern  via  portal networks  and  more  conventional

means,  and  adventures  can  take  characters  to  multiple  locations

before resolution.

Wemic Camp is an adventure site that can be dropped into any

adventure  that  takes  place  within  the  vast  expanse  of  the  Shaar.

Taking on the entire camp is a serious challenge (at least CR 12),

and each of the wemic leaders constitutes a CR 6 or 7 encounter. As

always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as you see fit

to make it work with your campaign.

Preparation

You (the DM) need the D&D core rulebooksthe Players Hand-

book, the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  and  the  Monster  Manualas

well  as  The  Shining  Southto  use  this  adventure  site.  This  infor-

mation presented here utilizes the D&D v.3.5 rules.

To get started, print out the adventure site, including the map.

Read through it at least once to familiarize yourself with the situa-

tion,  site,  and  major  NPCs  (particularly  their  motivations).  You

must  decide  what  kind  of  action  takes  placewhether  the  PCs

simply stumble upon the wemics campsite or have a reason to visit.

Finally,  review  the  information  on  wemics  in  Monster  Com-

pendium:  Monsters  of  Faern  and Races  of  Faern. Monster  and

NPC statistics are provided with each encounter in abbreviated form.

Background

The wemic pride known as the Golden Mane roams throughout the

plains of the Shaar, but its movements are far from random. The

pride  has  established  several  campsites  that  it  can  use  in  rotation

during  its  travels.  It  shares  some  of  these  sites  with  other  wemic

prides  that  move  on  a  different  schedule  and  occasionally  with  a

loxo herd as well.

The Golden Mane Pride stays in each of its campsites for periods

varying from a week to two months, depending upon the prevalence

of game in the area. Upon moving into a site, the shaman reads the

signs left by the last occupantsmost of which detail new dangers

or competing predators in the area, as well as the movements and

relative abundance of game. The females and young clear the site of

any  debris  that  has  collected  during  its  vacancy,  while  the  males

scout the surrounding area.

Upon leaving a site, the shaman leaves offerings for Nobanion,

plus signs to inform the next pride of the conditions encountered.

The males police the site, taking care to leave no signs of the direc-

tion they have taken that enemies could follow.

The Campsite

This  campsite  is  on  the  open  plain  in  an  area  blanketed  with  tall

grasses. Low brambles and occasional hardy but twisted trees dot the

landscape as well. A few creeks crisscross the area, and water holes

here  and  there  provide  enough  water  to  support  the  herd  animals

and predators of the plains.

The campsite is approximately 160 feet long by 110 feet wide. It

is  bounded  by  three  rocky  outcroppings,  each  1520  feet  high

(Climb DC 12) and a thorn barrier that connects them. Some of the

prides males stand guard at night atop these rocks, which offer an

excellent view of the surrounding grasslands. The remainder patrol

the perimeter of the camp, just outside the thorn barrier.

The barrier was grown by one of the prides shamans some years

ago, and the shamans of the prides that use the area still tend it lov-

ingly. It stands approximately 10 feet high and is about 10 feet wide

in  most  places.  The  barrier  functions  like  heavy  undergrowth  (see

page 87 in the Dungeon Masters Guide), except that thorns tear at

anyone trying to pass through it. For every 5 feet so moved, the bar-

rier  makes  a  melee  attack  (attack  bonus  +3  melee)  and  deals  1d4

points of damage on a successful hit.

Inside the barrier is a watering hole about 15 feet in diameter and

8 feet deep at the center. The wemics use it to drink and bathe, and

they sometimes scoop water from it to clean the blood from their

weapons.

Nine scraggly trees provide some shade during daylight hours. Six

of  them  surround  the  watering  hole,  and  the  rest  are  near  the

perimeter of the campsite. The trees range from 30 to 40 feet high

and are deciduous.

The wemics sleep on mats of woven grass placed on the ground.

A wemic sleeping on one of these mats (or on the ground) has total

concealment unless the viewer is taller (or up higher) than the sur-

rounding grass, which stands about 7 feet high.

The  wemics  usually  enter  and  exit  the  camp  via  the  rocky  out-

croppings, jumping up on top of them and then down again, rather

than  pushing  their  way  through  the  brambles.  At  times,  however,

they find it more convenient to simply jump the thorny barrier. A

female bringing back a kill usually either leaves it outside the camp

for  others  to  feed  on,  or  places  it  in  Wrokeens  Hewards  handy

haversack so that she can bring it into camp easily.

The Pride

The Golden Mane Pride currently consists of four adult males, ten

adult  females,  and  five  noncombatant  cubs.  The  leader  is  Shaqar,

the  strongest  male  in  the  group.  His  mate,  Wrokeen,  is  the  lead

hunter, and Kretnor is the shaman of the pride. Shaqars rival for

leadership is Beren, a wemic with dark powers that most of his kind

do not even suspect.

D Shaqar: Male  wemic  barbarian  4;  CR  7;  Large  monstrous

Rage (Ex): Twice a day, Shaqar can enter a state of fierce rage

that lasts for 7 rounds. The following changes are in effect as long

as he rages: hp 84; AC 17, touch 9, flat-footed 17; Grp +22; Atk +19

Shaqar is fatigued for the duration of the encounter.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex): Shaqar  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus  to

Armor Class even when flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe (he

still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile).

Possessions: +2 silent moves hide armor, +2 greatclub, +1 composite

longbow  (+4  Str  bonus), gloves  of  Dexterity  +2,  potion  of  bulls

strength, gold pectoral (worth 750 gp).

Description: Shaqar has a fabulous russet mane with gold streaks,

and his face and chest sport several battle scars. He wears an elabo-

rate pectoral of beaten gold and dragon teeth, which he fashioned to

show off his trophies from a fight with a blue dragon in the com-

pany of some adventurers. He still uses a composite longbow that he

carried  during  that  battle,  despite  the  fact  that  his  abilities  have

advanced beyond its limitations.

As a leader, Shaqar tries to be fair but authoritative. He won

his position within the pride from his uncle in fair combat when

the latter became too old to lead. Wrokeen is Shaqars designated

mate and true love, and she often advises him on local conditions

and  appropriate  movements.  Smarter  than  the  average  wemic,

Shaqar realized early that the younger male known as Beren had

a black heart and constituted a threat to the pride, so he encour-

aged the youngster to go adventuring. Since his return, Beren has

been too secretive for Shaqars liking, and the leader watches him

closely.

Possessions: Amulet of natural armor +1, +2 battleaxe, +2 compos-

ite longbow (+6 Str bonus) with 20 arrows, lesser bracers of archery

(composite longbow), Hewards handy haversack, 3 potions of cure

light wounds, 10 gp.

Description: The  acknowledged  mother  of  the  pride,  Wrokeen

enjoys  her  position  as  lead  hunter  for  the  group  and  Shaqars

favored mate. She has borne Shaqar seven cubs, four of which are

still with the pride today. The most recent cub is still below the age

of maturity, so she spends some of her time caring for him. When

she hunts, however, she leaves the cub in the care of one of her own

daughters.

Wrokeen  has  long,  dark  hair  that  she  keeps  tied  back  with  a

simple  leather  thong.  Her  face  is  considered  lovely  and  exotic  by

humans,  largely  because  of  her  elegant  features  and  catlike  green

eyes. She is the fastest member of the pride, and her skill with the

bow is already legendary.

It is Wrokeen who always acts as the scout for the pride, tracking

food  animals  and  potential  enemies,  seeking  out  fresh  sources  of

water, and blazing new trails for the prides annual movements. Her

talent for reading the signs of nature keeps the pride well informed

about potential adverse weather, recent battles between creatures of

the plains, and new threats to the territory.

Description: Kretnor is a red-haired beauty with tattoos of various

beasts  on  her  face  and  arms.  She  has  produced  three  cubs  for  the

pride, all male, and all now living with prides of their own. Beren has

been actively courting her for some time, and she is flattered by his

attention, but she senses something dark about him and has thus far

resisted his advances.

Kretnor is a dedicated follower of Nobanion. As shaman for the

pride, she keeps the worship of Nobanion alive and vital, ensuring

proper sacrifices and observation of his holy days.

As the tribes only healer, Kretnor spends much of her time making

healing potions and unguents. She sometimes participates in territo-

rial battles, but Shaqar prefers to hold her in reserve so that she can

heal the rest of the combatants. Kretnor chafes somewhat under such

restrictions because she feels that she can more than hold her own in

combat. Thus, after she provides the required post-battle healing, she

often disappears for a few days to hunt alone. When she returns, she

invariably has a sizable killoften some dangerous creature.

Despite Kretnors misgivings, she is appreciated by the rest of the

pride for her varied talents as well as her combat ability. She serves

as spiritual advisor to the pride as a whole, and to Shaqar in partic-

ular.  Kretnor  looks  forward  to  the  day  when  she  will  be  able  to

assume  the  forms  of  animals,  but  for  now  she  relies  on  her  hawk

companion  Silvin  for  reconnaissance  information  about  the  sur-

rounding area.

reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up

to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures without dis-

cernible  anatomies,  and  creatures  immune  to  extra  damage  from

critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. Beren may choose to

deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak attack, but only when using

a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).

Evasion  (Ex): If  Beren  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that  normally

allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, he

tures abilities and characteristics are summarized below.

normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for

half  damage,  he  takes  no  damage  with  a  successful  saving

throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Familiar  Benefits: Beren  gains  special  benefits  from  having  a

familiar.  This  creature  grants  him  a  +3  bonus  on  Bluff  checks

(included in the above statistics).

Alertness (Ex): *Slick grants his master Alertness as long as he is

within 5 feet.

Empathic Link (Su): Beren can communicate telepathically with

his familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile. The master has the same

connection to an item or a place that the familiar does.

Share Spells (Su): Beren may have any spell he casts on himself

also affect his familiar if the latter is within 5 feet at the time. He

may also cast a spell a target of You on his familiar.

Trapfinding (Ex): Beren can find, disarm, or bypass traps with a

DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to find, and the Dis-

able Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the

spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the traps

DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the trap without trig-

gering or disarming it.

Sorcerer Spells Known (caster level 1st): 0detect magic, mage

hand, read magic, touch of fatigue (+10 melee touch, DC 11); 1st

charm person (DC 12), true strike.

Possessions: Bracers of armor +2, wand of magic missile (1st), +1

short sword, dagger of venom, +1 heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, dust

of disappearance.

Description: Beren has always known he was different from other

wemics. Born with the shadow of evil upon his soul, he has always

been greedy and cruel, though he has learned to hide such feelings

well and mouth the platitudes that his fellow wemics wish to hear.

Concerned about Berens unhelpful attitude, Shaqar encouraged

him to go forth from the pride and find adventure in his youth, and

he did so. Beren ventured closer to human civilizations than most of

his kind do, and he was quickly adopted by an avaricious adventur-

ing  group.  From  this  association,  he  learned  the  ways  of  thievery,

and he made an excellent thug on the streets of outlying cities. He

also  discovered  the  spark  of  magic  within  himself  and  decided  to

develop it as best he could.

When he returned to the pride after a particularly unprofitable

season  in  the  city,  Beren  hid  his  magical  abilities  as  well  as  his

roguish skills, knowing that neither fit the prides barbarian image.

Since  then,  he  has  used  his  sneak  attack  ability  liberally  in  battle,

though he always tells his fellow wemics that his blow was a piece

of good luck.

For some time now, Beren has nursed a secret desire to take over

the pride. He plots and schemes constantly against Shaqar, planning

to  weaken  him  in  subtle  ways  while  undermining  his  credibility

within the pride. Beren has also sought alliances outside the pride

with  both  rival  leaders  who  would  like  to  meld  the  Golden  Mane

with their own prides, and with thri-kreen, loxo, and even Sharryan

humans who covet the prides territory.

Beren  appears  as  a  golden-furred  wemic  with  a  midnight-black

mane and a cruel glint in his yellow eyes. Thin and lithe, he lacks the

musculature of most males, but his magic and rogue abilities make

him just as deadly in combat.

A Typical Day in Camp

While the Golden Mane Pride is in residence here, the males guard

the perimeter by night and drive off intruders while the females and

cubs sleep. During the day, the males sleep while some of the females

hunt and others keep an eye on the camp, and the cubs romp and

learn to use weapons. The elder members of the tribe who are not as

fast  as  they  once  were  make  themselves  useful  by  fashioning  and

repairing  weapons  and  shields,  caring  for  the  young,  and  making

tools, sleeping mats, shelters, and medicines for the pride.

During inclement weather, those wemics not on guard duty often

take shelter under half-tentstanned hides supported at one end by

poles. The wemics rarely use fire because they prefer their meat raw

and understand the dangers that fire can present in the grasslands.

The females travel considerable distances to track herds of food

animals.  Wrokeen  often  uses  her  Hewards  handy  haversack to

bring back single kills. She also does her best to drive the herds closer

to the wemic camp, so that other females need not carry their kills

so far.

Adventure Options

The PCs could visit the wemic camp for many reasons. As DM, you

know best how to work a particular site into your storyline, but you

can use the ideas below as inspiration.

The PCs happen upon the camp while traversing the Shaar.

The characters encounter Wrokeen hunting herd animals in the

plains  or  charting  a  new  course  for  the  prides  fall  migration.

They  may  accidentally  interfere  with  her  efforts,  or  aid  her  in

some way. If she learns from the PCs that some new threat hangs

over the Shaar, she may take the characters back to the pride to

discuss the issue with Shaqar.

Shaqar  is  concerned  about  a  band  of  thri-kreen  that  has  been

hunting  outside  its  normal  territory  of  late.  A  few  skirmishes

have already taken place, but Shaqar is considering taking a few

of  the  males  from  the  pride  and  seeking  out  the  renegade  thri-

kreen. At present, he is considering whether to involve the local

loxo herd, but the presence of adventurers may convince him to

seek their aid instead.

Beren  is  about  to  make  a  bid  for  power.  For  some  time,  he  has

been using his spells to degrade the leaders authority within the

pride while slipping plant-based poison that deals Strength damage

into his food. When Shaqar is sufficiently weak, Beren plans to

challenge him to combat, using his spells to enhance his own abil-

ities and his dagger of venom to ensure the leaders death. The PCs

arrive just as the combat is starting.
