Introduction

Book of Vile Darkness is a sourcebook of evil. It contains a

large amount of new game materialall of it vile, loath-

some, dark, and despicable. Although evil monsters, spells,

and magic items have appeared in previous products, this

compendium is a collection of the most vile, hideous, and

disgusting aspects of evil that might appear in a game. Its

pages contain references to acts of horrible depravity and

malevolent behavior unlike anything you have probably

encountered before in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.

Let this be a warning: Book of Vile Darkness is intended for

mature audiences. The topics covered herein are not for the

immature, squeamish, or faint of heart. This book deals

with fictional gore, extreme violence, human sacrifice,

addiction, corrupt magic, and deviant behavior. Its content

is not a lighthearted take on badnessit is about evil,

pure and simple.

Before you put this book down in disgust, however, con-

sider this: The darker the shadow of evil, the brighter the

light of good. The more horrible the villain, the greater the

hero. If you are interested in adding the truly horrific to

your game as something for the player characters (PCs) to

vanquish, then this book is for you.

HIDE THIS BOOK!

Book of Vile Darkness is for Dungeon Masters (DMs) only. Just

as you would keep the contents of a published adventure to

yourself, restrict your players access to this book as well.

Dont let them know whats in store for their characters.

EVIL IN THE GAME SESSION

Every powerful force in the universe has an opposite and

equally powerful force. Evil and darkness pervade the

world of the D&D game, combating the forces of good (as

epitomized by the PCs). Each time a great malevolence is

vanquished, another springs up to take its place, like a

hydra with an unlimited number of heads. Heroes confront

evil head-on. Other, less fanatic characters deal with it only

when they need to. But smart characters never dwell over-

long on corruption and darkness, lest it overtake them.

When a paladin returns home from a quest to enjoy time

with loved ones and friends, she should put away thoughts

of the horrors she has seen.

Try not to let the forces of evil portrayed in Book of Vile

Darkness overwhelm your game. The power of the arch-

fiends, the insidiousness of evil magic, and the corruption

of some of the feats and magic items in this book are

extreme. You may be tempted to unleash elements of this

book on your characters time and time again. But unless

you want to run the bleakest of campaignsand your play-

ers do, tooresist that temptation and use this information

sparingly. This book is not an excuse to turn your game into

a dreary slog through the bowels of utter depravity. For the

deepest evil to have a proper impact, PCs must encounter it

only occasionally. If you can make your players gasp in

horror at the foes they face, their victories over those oppo-

nents will be all the sweeter.

WHATS INSIDE

The eight chapters of this book break down the material

into easily digestible sections.

The Nature of Evil (Chapter 1): This chapter deals with

the basics of evil and evil acts. It provides advice on creating

villains and examples of how to incorporate the ideas in this

book into your campaign. Rules are given for various evil

predilections that villains might have, such as cannibalism

and addiction. Here youll find many examples of evil cul-

tures, characters, places, and gods that you can put to use in

your D&D games.

Variant Rules (Chapter 2): In this chapter, youll find a

miscellany of new rules regarding vile topics. Vile damage,

curses, sacrifices, possession, and diseases are among the

topics detailed here.

Equipment (Chapter 3): Torture implements, traps, poi-

sons, and drugs are important parts of every evildoers arse-

nal. This chapter explains how to use them in your game. It

also presents a wide variety of magic itemsincluding arti-

factsthat are touched by evil.

Feats (Chapter 4): This chapter offers new feats, includ-

ing some that fall into a new category called vile feats. To

acquire a vile feat, a character must be evil.

Prestige Classes (Chapter 5): Some of the prestige

classes in this chapter are specifically for monsters or

fiends. Others are designed for characters who dedicate

themselves to the worship of demons and devils.

Magic (Chapter 6): For characters wishing to delve into

dark magic, this chapter introduces corrupt spells. These

spells are usable by any spellcaster willing to pay the toll

that such magic exacts.

Lords of Evil (Chapter 7): This chapter describes the

worst of the worstthe archdevils who rule the Nine Hells

and the demon lords who call the Abyss home. Veteran

D&D players are probably already familiar with some of

these  names:  Demogorgon,  Asmodeus,  Orcus,  and

Baalzebul.

Evil Monsters (Chapter 8): Demons and devils are

here, and new undead and other creatures are also detailed.

Also in this chapter are templates to make evil creatures

even viler than their ordinary counterparts.

All of these chapters are tools meant to aid the DM in

constructing malevolent foes. At the end of the book is an

appendix that deals specifically with evil PCs, providing

some guidance for dealing with situations that can occur if

you allow evil characters into your campaign.

ood and evil are not philosophical concepts in the D&D

game. They are the forces that define the cosmos.

D&D Players Handbook

Evil is a word that is probably overused. In the con-

text of the game, and certainly of this book, the word should

be reserved for the dark force of destruction and death that

tempts souls to wrongdoing and perverts wholesomeness and

purity at every turn. Evil is vile, corrupt, and irredeemably

dark. It is not naughty or ill-tempered or misunderstood. It is

black-hearted, selfish, cruel, bloodthirsty, and malevolent.

EVIL IN YOUR GAME

There are two recommended ways to deal with the concept

of evil in your campaign: the objective approach and the

relative approach. This second option is a variant approach

and should be used with some caution.

THE OBJECTIVE APPROACH

This is the straightforward approach taken in the D&D

game, and it is the one stressed in this book as well. From

this frame of reference, evil can be judged objectively. The

evil nature of a creature, act, or item isnt relative to the

person observing it; it just is evil or it isnt. This clear-cut

definition allows spells such as holy smite to work. Con-

versely, an objective definition of evil exists because

the detect evil spell works. Want to know whats evil?

Dont study a philosophy book, just watch who gets

hurt when the cleric casts holy smite. Those creatures

are evil. The things they do, generally speaking, are

evil acts. If your character still isnt certain, he can

summon a celestial creature or cast a commune spell

and simply ask, Is this evil? The higher powers are

right there, ready to communicate.

The Players Handbook says,  Evil implies hurt-

ing, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil crea-

tures simply have no compassion for others and

kill without qualm if doing so is convenient.

Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or

out of duty to some evil deity or master.

This objective approach to evil works well for

fantasy roleplaying games. Evil is a thing that a

hero can point at and know he must fight. An

objective concept of evil allows players (and

their characters) to avoid most ethical or moral

quandaries, particularly the kinds that can

derail a game session. If you run an adventure

about fighting gnolls, you dont normally want

the entire session consumed by a philosophical

debate about whether killing gnolls is a good

thing or a bad thing.

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:31 AM  Page 6

THE RELATIVE APPROACH (VARIANT)

A second approach considers evil to be a relative concept

that is wholly dependent on the attitude of the observer.

This is not the approach of most D&D games; rather, it

resembles how many people see the real world. Using this

variant outlook changes a game dramaticallyat least as far

as evil is concerned. In the relative approach, evil is not

something that your character can point a finger at; its rela-

tive to each individual. While its possible for a number of

creatures (an entire culture, for example) to have a similar

view on what is good and what is evil, another group might

have a different or even opposite view. Of course, conflict-

ing views can also occur if your D&D game uses the objec-

tive approach, but in that case, one group can simply prove

that its views are right.

In a world where evil is relative, a deity might put forth

tenets describing what is right and wrong, or good and evil.

But another god might have different, even contradictory

dogma. A paladin of one deity might talk about the evil, god-

less heathens across the mountains and eventually go to war

with them. If she does, she may find herself battling pal-

adins of a different god and a different culture who look

upon the crusading paladin as an evil infidel.

If you decide that this is the approach you want, you have

some game-related decisions to make. For instance, in a

world where evil is relative, how does a detect evil spell work?

When two paladins of opposing views meet on the field of

battle, can they use their smite abilities against each other?

The easiest and best option in this case is to do away with

spells such as detect evil because they have no real meaning.

Take away the good and evil descriptors from spells (so that

any character can cast any of those spells), and disregard any

holy or unholy damage a weapon deals. Having to know or

determine the outlook of a character casting detect evil is

cumbersome and unwieldy, and it leads to confusion and

arguments over who should be affected by the paladins holy

sword or the clerics holy smite.

DEFINING EVIL

Of course, even if you take an objective approach in your

game, evil people might not always call themselves evil.

They would be wrong or simply lying to do so, but they

might still deny their evil nature. Even the most deranged

mass murderer might be able to justify his actions to himself

in the name of his beliefs, his deity, or some skewed vision

of what is best for the world.

A killer might slay any children he deems weak or unfit to

reach adulthood. Another might kill children he believes

will grow up and become evil themselves. Perhaps such a

killer once had a prophetic dream telling him that evil was

growing among the children of the town.

On a larger scale, an evil priest might believe that to

better serve his dark god, he needs to destroy an entire vil-

lage and sacrifice all the residents. Is that evil? Yes. Does the

priest see it as evil? No, he sees it as a demonstration of his

unending devotion and an aspect of his faith. Or perhaps he

does see it as evil and doesnt care.

A dictator might order the elimination of an entire race

of good creatures because she believes them to be evil. She

might seek to dominate the world and bring its people

under her unyielding fist. But such a despot could also

believe that she is a good person and that the world will be

better off with her guidance. This attitude makes her no less

a villain.

INTENT AND CONTEXT

So, does the objective definition of evil imply that intent

plays no part in determining what is good and what isnt?

Only to a degree.

Consider the paladin Zophas. When climbing to the top

of a hill of loose rocks to get away from some owlbears, he

triggers a rockslide that buries the owlbears and continues

down the hill, crushing a hut full of commoners. Is Zophas

an evil murderer who must suddenly lose his lawful good

alignment? No, although Zophas might still feel guilt and

responsibility. He might attempt to right the inadvertent

wrong as best he can.

But what if Zophass friend Shurrin said, Dont climb up

there, Zophas! You might start a rockslide that will crush the

hut! Zophas goes anyway. Now is it evil? Probably. Zophas

was either carelessly endangering the commoners or so

overconfident of his climbing prowess that he acted out of

hubris. At this point, Zophas isnt exactly a murderer, but he

should probably lose his paladin abilities until he receives

an atonement spell or otherwise makes amends.

If Zophas can clearly see the danger of the rockslide but

climbs up anyway because he wants to get away from the

owlbears, thats clearly evil. In a world of black-and-white

distinctions between good and evil, killing innocents to

save yourself is an evil act. Sacrificing yourself for the

good of others is a good act. Its a high standard, but thats

the way it is.

The foregoing text defines three levels of intent: acciden-

tal acts, reckless or negligent acts, and intentionally evil

misdeeds. Sometimes, however, those categories are insuffi-

cient to determine evil intent. You are free to judge an act in

the context of other actions.

A maniac puts poison in a towns water supply, believing

(wrongly) that all of the people in the town are demons. Is

that evil? Yes. A glabrezu convinces a good character that the

townsfolk are all fiends that must be destroyed, so the char-

acter pours poison into the towns water supply. Is that evil?

Probably notat least, not in the context of the rest of the

characters actions and the circumstances involved. Still,

good characters shouldnt commit even remotely question-

able acts on a large scale unless theyre absolutely sure

theres no other way to succeed. Its rarely a good idea to

destroy a town of evil people, because there might be at least

a few good people in the town as well.

But lets make it even more complicated. Another charac-

ter witnesses the good character about to put poison in the

towns drinking water. Is it evil for the witness to kill the poi-

soning character in order to stop him? No. Again, the intent

isnt evil, and the context makes such an act preferable to the

alternative. Standing by while a mass murder occursthe

other choice the witness hasis far more evil than prevent-

ing the poisoning.

GRAY AREAS

Even with the most black-and-white, objective approach

to good and evil, gray areas will always exist. Consider this

example: A terrible disease has come to the village of

Varro, and the cure lies in the heartwood of the sacred

trees of the Varrowood. The villagers go into the wood to

get the cure. The druids of the Varrowood believe that the

trees are holy and should not be violated. They try to stop

the villagers. Is either side truly evil in this scenario?

Probably not.

Not all conflicts are based on good versus evil. It is possible

for two good nations to go to war. It is likely that two evil

nations will go to war. Is it evil for your character to kill a good

character if your characters kingdom is at war with his? Thats

certainly a gray area. Characters who are extremely strict in

their moral outlook should examine the reasons behind the

war very closely. In general, quarter should be given and

accepted. Such a character should cause no more damage and

inflict no more harm than is necessary. If possible, he or she

should find a different way to resolve the conflict.

EVIL ACTS

Examining the actions of the malevolent not only helps

define what evil is, but it also gives an insight into the

schemes of a villain. What follows is more than a list that

defines evil as opposed to good. Read over the following sec-

tions to get ideas for villainous plots, schemes, motivations,

and personalities.

LYING

Misdirection, tricks, and manipulation are tools of the trade

for most villains. With such tools, they can lead enemies

into traps, both physical and otherwise. A well-told, well-

placed lie can redirect a whole army, change the opinion of

an entire citys populace, or simply make an adventurer

open the wrong door in a dungeon.

Some liars are compulsive; that is, they have a psychologi-

cal need to lie. Others delight in fooling people. If a villain

can get a foe to believe a lie, he has shown himself (at least in

his own mind) to be superior to that foe.

Intelligent villains often concentrate on gaining ranks in

Bluff to facilitate their lies. Of course, being liars themselves

alerts them to the fact that others probably lie just as much

as they do. Thus, they often have a high Sense Motive modi-

fier as well.

Lying is not necessarily an evil act, though it is a tool that

can easily be used for evil ends. Lying is so easy to use for

evil purposes that most knightly codes and the creeds of

many good religions forbid it altogether.

CHEATING

Cheating is breaking the rules for personal gain. When evil

villains cheat, its not just at games. They create contracts with

clauses that they can manipulate to trick others. Villains

manipulate officials so that evildoers are set free instead of

going to prison. They rig their enemies equipment so that it

breaks or does not function properly. Cheaters may threaten

the lives of a councilmans family to make him vote for their

plan. They may use spells and poison to ensure that a particu-

lar gladiator dies in the arena so that they can earn a profit by

wagering on the survivor.

Cheating can take many forms. For example, a cheater

might trick two enemies into fighting each other, or fool

an enemys lover into betraying his or her loved one. A

cheater might challenge an opponent to a rigged contest or

a fight that is rigged, or simply make an agreement that he

or she has no intention of upholding.

THEFT

Any child can tell you that stealing is wrong. Villains, how-

ever, often see theft as the best way to acquire what they

want. Evil people pay only for things they cannot take.

An evil character needs a reason not to steal. Fear of being

caught is the most common deterrent, but sometimes a vil-

lain elects not to steal an item because he or she doesnt want

to incur the wrath of its owner. For example, a drow cleric

might pay a rogue for a magic item. The cleric isnt averse to

stealing from the rogue, but she pays for the item so that the

rogue will continue working for her.

BETRAYAL

A betrayal is often nothing more than an elaborate lie, but

its implications are greater. Such an act involves earning

someones trust and then using that trust against him or her.

Common acts of betrayal include learning and then reveal-

ing secrets, or using trust to get close to ones enemies for an

attack or theft.

Betrayal does not have to be intentionalor at least it

does not have to start intentionally. Sometimes a character

can be tempted into betraying someone whose trust he or

she earned legitimately. Children can betray their parents, a

lover can betray a lover, and a friend can betray a friend.

However, it can also be more complex than that: A king can

betray his people, a husband can betray his wifes family, and

a human can betray his entire race. Virtually any sort of link

between two creatures can eventually become the founda-

tion for betrayal.

MURDER

Killing is one of the most horrible acts that a creature can

commit. Murder is the killing of an intelligent creature for a

nefarious purpose: theft, personal gain, perverse pleasure, or

the like.

The heroes who go into the green dragons woodland lair

to slay it are not murderers. In a fantasy world based on an

objective definition of evil, killing an evil creature to stop it

from doing further harm is not an evil act. Even killing an

evil creature for personal gain is not exactly evil (although

its not a good act), because it still stops the creatures preda-

tions on the innocent. Such a justification, however, works

only for the slaying of creatures of consummate, irre-

deemable evil, such as chromatic dragons.

Evil beings delight in murder. It is the ultimate expres-

sion of their power and their willingness to commit any sort

of heinous act. It shows that they are either powerful

enough or detached enough to do anything they wish.

To particularly evil creatures, especially those with very

alien outlooks, murder is itself a desirable goal. Some such

creatures hate life and despise all that lives. They relish

either death or undeath and thus seek to quench life wher-

ever possible. Such creatures are usually (but not always)

undead themselves.

VENGEANCE

Revenge is a powerful force. An act of vengeance does not

have to be evil, but the evil mindset usually redefines the

concept as revenge at any price. Vengeance without limits

can quickly lead to all sorts of evil acts.

For example, suppose someone steals a magic ring from a

kuo-toa wizard. The wizard breaks into a duergar fortress to

use a crystal ball to locate the thief. The kuo-toa teleports to

the thief s locationa busy tavernand begins hurling

lightning bolts into the crowd. The thief gets away and uses a

nondetection spell to keep such a close call from happening

again. Undaunted, the wizard magically adopts an inconspic-

uous form and begins to track down the thief s family mem-

bers, torturing them for information regarding his where-

abouts. Such a scenario depicts the evil side of revenge.

Forgiveness and mercy are not traits that most evil crea-

tures possess. Vengeance for wrongs committed against

themor even for perceived wrongsis the only appropri-

ate response.

WORSHIPING EVIL GODS AND DEMONS

Priests who revere dark powers are as evil as the beings they

serve. In the name of Vecna, Erythnul, or Lolth, these foul

emissaries make living sacrifices, conduct malevolent rites,

and put schemes in motion to aid their patrons. Sometimes,

the activities of evil cultists are straightforward: kidnapping

victims for sacrifice, stealing money to fund their temples,

or simply following a dogma that requires murder, rape, or

activities even more foul. Other times, their machinations

are far subtler than such overt crimes.

For example, an archdevil such as Belial might begin a

scheme by instructing his followers in a town (through

dreams, visions, and commune spells) to drive off families

with healthy children of a particular age. In twenty years,

when such children would have been adults in their prime,

Belial intends to unleash a powerful cornugon to steal a

valuable artifact from the local church. With few able-

bodied adults available to stop the theft, the cornugon is

more likely to succeed.

Evil temples are sometimes secret places hidden within

unsuspecting communities. Beneath an old barn, in a ware-

house, or simply in a back room of someones homean

evil temple can be anywhere. Larger, more permanent

shrines to malevolence are usually situated farther away

from civilizationat least, far away from good-aligned com-

munities. Such an evil church may be a towering structure

of stone covered with macabre reliefs and filled with terrible

statuary, standing alone in the wilderness. Other evil tem-

ples may be surrounded by towns or cities populated by foul

creatures.

ANIMATING THE DEAD OR

CREATING UNDEAD

Unliving corpsescorrupt mockeries of life and purity

are  inherently  evil.  Creating  them  is  one  of  the  most

heinous crimes against the world that a character can

commit. Even if they are commanded to do something

good, undead invariably bring negative energy into the

world, which makes it a darker and more evil place.

Many communities keep their graveyards behind high

walls or even post guards to keep grave robbers out. Grave-

robbing is often a lucrative practice, since necromancers pay

good coin for raw materials. Of course, battlefields are also

popular places for grave-robbersor for necromancers

themselvesto seek corpses.

CASTING EVIL SPELLS

Evil spells may create undead, inflict undue suffering, harm

anothers soul, or produce any of a slew of similar effects.

Sometimes, a nonevil spellcaster can get away with cast-

ing a few evil spells, as long as he or she does not do so for an

evil purpose. But the path of evil magic leads quickly to cor-

ruption and destruction. Spells with corruption costs (see

Corrupt Magic in Chapter 6) are so evil that they take a

physical and spiritual toll on the caster.

DAMNING OR HARMING SOULS

While harming ones enemies physically is not inherently

villainous, harming their souls is always evil. Only the

foulest of villains could actually want to cause pain to

another creatures eternal aspect. Creatures without corrupt

hearts simply dispatch their foes quickly, believing that send-

ing a villain off to the justice of the afterlife is punishment

enough. But evil beings like to capture foes and torture them

to death, and some even prefer to torture the souls of their

foes, never granting them the release of death. Worse still,

some evil beings use their foul magic to destroy an oppo-

nents soul, ending his or her existence altogether.

CONSORTING WITH FIENDS

If characters can be judged by the company they keep, then

those who deal with fiendsdemons and devilsare

surely evil beings themselves. Fiends are the ultimate ex-

pression of evil given animate formliterally evil incar-

nate. Destroying a fiend is always a good act. Allowing a

fiend to exist, let alone summoning one or helping one, is

clearly evil.

Occasionally, a spellcaster may summon a fiendish crea-

ture to accomplish some task. Such an act is evil, but not ter-

ribly so. However, some characters, particularly those who

worship demons or devils or see them as valuable allies, may

work with (or for) fiends to further their own ends. Worse

still, some mortals sell their souls to fiends in order to gain

more power or support. Although dealing with fiends or

selling souls is risky at best, the lust for power is a tempta-

tion too strong for some to resist. But fiends have great

power, infinite life spans, and a delight for double-crossing

others, so its not surprising that most characters who ask for

a fiends aid end up on the wrong end of the deals they make.

CREATING EVIL CREATURES

Some villains are not content with simply consorting with,

summoning, or controlling evil creatures. They feel the

need to go one step further and actually create such crea-

tures with foul experiments or evil magic.

Evil warlords sometimes create legions of horrible mon-

sters (or have their underlings do so) and lead them into

battle against the forces of good. Demons, devils, and other

foul creatures guard their fortresses. The desire to create is

strong, and so is the desire to have a large number of easily

controllable minions. Both creation and control demon-

strate power, and power-mad villains are all too common.

Another way to create evil creatures is to allow the mon-

sters themselves to remake fallen foes in their own images.

For example, a bodaks victims rise the next day as new

bodaks, and a werewolf can spread its evil by infecting

others  with  lycanthropy.  Characters  who  foster  such

processes are often interested in spreading evil for evils

sake. Such evildoers love the chaos, death, and suffering that

such monsters bring.

USING OTHERS FOR PERSONAL GAIN

Whether its sacrificing a victim on an evil gods altar to gain

a boon, or simply stealing from a friend, using others for

ones own purposes is a hallmark of villainy. A villain rou-

tinely puts others in harms way to save his or her own

neckbetter that others die, surely.

The utter selfishness of an evil character rarely leaves

room for empathy. He is so consumed with his own goals

and desires that he can think of no reason not to succeed at

the expense of others. At best, other creatures are cattle to be

used, preyed upon, or led. At worst, they are gnats to be

ignored or obstacles to be bypassed.

nature. The ten-year-old princess who forces bards to sing

songs of her beauty or else face the wrath of her tyrannical

mother (the queen) is indeed a bully.

BRINGING DESPAIR

Evil creatures often enjoy spreading pain and misery to

others. Some do this because breaking the spirits of others

makes them feel superior; others sow despair for the sheer

joy it provides them.

Sometimes encouraging misery runs counter to other evil

goals. For example, a blackguard interested in bringing

despair  might  leave  his  enemies  alive  but  wounded,

defeated, and broken (and maybe even cursed or magically

corrupted). However, refusing to finish off ones foes isnt

always the wisest course of action, because the blackguards

enemies might heal themselves and oppose him again, with

a vengeance.

Similarly, a misery-loving fiend might tell a captured foe

his plans before he kills her, just to revel in his victims

despair. Such a creature wants its enemies to realize how

utterly defeated they are.

A villain with a love of misery may attempt to break his

foes, either instead of or before killing them. Straightfor-

ward techniques such as torture can break an enemy, and so

can more elaborate schemes, such as destroying the good

aspects of an enemys life, one by one. If the villains foe

delights in the beauty of an ancient forest, the evildoer

might command fire elementals to burn it down. If the foe

has a lover, the villain could capture and torture the loved

oneor turn him or her against the foe. The villain might

also frame the foe for others crimes, spread lies about him,

destroy his home, or infect him with a disease. A crafty,

despair-loving villain makes it unusual for the foes loved

ones to speak his name except as a curse.

Despair-loving creatures delight in spells such as bestow

curse, contagion, and sorrow. Such villains love using any mag-

ical effect that does more than simply kill their foes because

they consider death too pleasant an end.

GREED

TEMPTING OTHERS

Greed is so simple a motivation that it hardly seems worth

mentioning. Yet it drives villains perhaps more than any

other factor. Greed is tied into most of the types of evil

behavior mentioned here. Ambition taken too farparticu-

larly advancement at the expense of otherscan manifest

itself as greed. Lust for wealth, power, or prestige can lead to

jealousy, theft, murder, betrayal, and a host of other evils.

BULLYING AND COWING INNOCENTS

Bullying is simply a symptom of an obsession with power. A

villain who has power over another likes to brandish that

power to prove her own might, both to herself and to others.

Such brutes feel that power has no worth if others do not

know about it.

Although the archetypal bully is a strong and powerful

thug, other kinds of bullies exist as well. Sometimes a bully

uses magical might rather than physical prowess to cow

those around her. Sometimes the power is political in

Temping good individuals to do wrong is an evil act. Plots

with this goal are largely the purview of demons and devils

that seek to corrupt mortals in order to taint their souls. The

products of a tempters work are larvae, the physical mani-

festations of evil souls on the Lower Planes (see Chapter 7).

Larvae are valuable to fiends; in fact, they are a form of cur-

rency in their own right. Some demons and devils, particu-

larly erinyes, succubi, and glabrezu, spend almost all their

time corrupting mortals with offers of sex, power, magic, or

other pleasures.

When evil mortals tempt other mortals, often the tempta-

tion comes in the form of a bribe to get others to do what the

villain wants. For example, a wealthy man might convince a

woman to kill her father in return for a vast sum of money.

Unlike a demon, the wealthy man doesnt care about corrupt-

ing the womans soul; he just wants the father dead. Still other

mortal evildoers might tempt someone to commit an evil act

for the sheer pleasure of spreading temptation.

FETISHES AND ADDICTIONS

Many slaves to darkness are consumed by addictions and

perverted tastes. Unsavory sexual behavior, drug addiction,

sadism, and masochism are just some of the horrible traits

common to the evil and perverse.

Cannibalism: Cannibals are creatures that eat others of

their own kind. In the broader sense, cannibals may be

defined as creatures that eat other intelligent creatures for

whatever perverted pleasure they gain from it. Many crea-

tures do thisdragons eat humans and other intelligent

creatures all the timebut usually they gain no more pleas-

ure (and definitely less sustenance) from a human than they

do from a cow.

Cannibals gain pleasure, and in some cases power (see

the absorb mind and absorb strength spells in Chapter 6),

from eating others. Often cannibals consume foes that

they have defeated in battle, but sometimes they simply

murder their meals.

Diseases, many of which involve mental disorders, may

be transmitted through cannibalism. Eating particularly

foul creatures, such as trolls or fiends, can be very danger-

ous (see the blue guts disease in Chapter 2).

Masochism: Masochists are rarely at full hit points

because they continually inflict wounds upon themselves.

A masochist gets pleasure from feeling pain and sometimes

cant tell the two sensations apart. Masochists wear jewelry

and devices that dig into their flesh with hooks and clamps,

they flagellate themselves with whips and barbed wires,

and they cut at their own bodies with knives and razors.

When encountered, a masochist has typically lost 1d310%

of his total hit points to self-inflicted wounds.

A masochist gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving

throws against pain effects (such as a symbol of pain). Fur-

thermore, if he takes damage equal to his character level in

a round, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack and

damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for the next

round. Masochists often grin with a sickening glee when

struck in combat, and they make noises of ecstasy even as

they suffer terrible wounds.

Self-Mutilation: Like masochists, self-mutilators are fas-

cinated by harming themselves. But the pain isnt impor-

tant to a self-mutilator; its the alteration and destruction of

his own flesh that fascinates him. Such characters turn the

destruction of their own bodies into a twisted sort of art, so

they are often covered in patterned scars. Sometimes this

ritual scarification is part of a religious ritual, but its just as

often self-inflicted for no other reason than a characters

own sick and twisted desires.

Not all self-mutilators are motivated by masochism or art.

Some insert useful mundane or magic items into their

flesh. Tiny objects such as keys can be hidden not only in

body cavities, but also under the skin, thrust into self-

inflicted wounds. In some cases, a subdermal pouch forms

when such a wound heals around an object. Tattooing can

further disguise the scars of such insertions.

A self-mutilator always has 1d3110% fewer hit points

than his or her normal maximum when encountered. Like

a masochist, a self-mutilator gains a +4 circumstance bonus

on any saving throw against pain effects.

Finally, a self-mutilator can choose to reduce his or her

hit point total by 10 points permanently to cover his or her

body in scabs and scars. This process toughens the flesh,

granting the character a +1 natural armor bonus.

Sadism: Sadists love to inflict pain. Generally, they hate

suffering pain themselves, but a few are sadomasochists,

who enjoy both giving and receiving pain. Foes gain a +1

circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks when they

threaten a sadist with physical harm, unless the sadist is

also a masochist.

If a sadist inflicts damage equal to her character level in a

round, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack and

damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for the next

round. A sadist laughs and licks the spray of blood across

her face whenever she inflicts a grievous wound.

Psychopathy: Technically, a psychopath is anyone with a

severe mental disorder resulting in any egocentric and anti-

social behavior. For the purpose of the D&D game, how-

ever,  a  psychopath  is  someone  who  derives  pleasure

fromand in fact can become addicted tokilling. Such

psychopaths slay for the sheer joy of it and to experience

the  power-mad  rush  that  accompanies  the  taking  of

anothers life. Psychopaths who enjoy watching their vic-

tims beg for mercy are often sadists, and this type enjoys

inflicting pain before killing a victim. The type of psy-

chopath who simply enjoys the feeling of ending a life is

interested only in death, and cries of mercy or pain only

annoy him.

Yet another type of psychopath is worth mentioning:

the rapist. This deplorable villain uses forced intercourse

as a means to attain power over others. Rapists can be

either gender, but almost all are male. A rapist is likely to

take his foes captive, particularly those of the gender he

is attracted to (although this is not necessarily the case,

because rape is about dominance and power, not true

sexual attraction).

Necrophilia: Among the foulest of fetishes, necrophilia

is the enjoyment of sex with the dead (or in some cases the

undead). Necrophiliacs are often members of a death cult,

servants of an undead deity such as Vecna, or followers of a

demon lord such as Orcus. Necrophiliacs may have sex

with corpses as part of a religious rite, as a sign of fealty to

a higher power, or simply for their own pleasure. Particu-

larly vile individuals violate the bodies of their defeated

and slain enemies to give themselves a feeling of power

and superiority.

Bestiality: An individual who has the terrible fetish of

bestiality desires sex with creatures of a type, shape, or

intellect vastly different from his or her own. Sometimes

bestiality stems from a desire to have power over a creature

of limited intelligence, but more often this perversion is

caused by a deviance in attraction. Shapechangers are the

most common culprits, although for some reason evil

dragons occasionally find themselves attracted to various

creatures other than their own kind. Thus, dragons often

learn spells or acquire magic items that allow them to take

different shapes. Fiends are willing to seduce or rape virtu-

ally any creaturepractices that result in all manner of

horrid half-fiends.

Alcoholism/Drug Addiction: An individual addicted

to the use of a particular substance is prone to erratic, vio-

lent,  and  sometimes  self-destructive  behavior.  Some

addicted people reach a point at which they need the sub-

stance to function normally, so they sell off their material

possessions (and in some cases their family members) to

get the drugs they crave.

Drug  addictions  function  much  like  diseases,  as

described in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. See Chapter 3 of

this book for specific drug and addiction rules.

VILE GODS

In comparison with gods such as Erythnul and Vecna, the

deities described in this section are fairly minor, with only

small congregations and cults in their name. Most people

speak these deities names in fear, or not at all lest they

attract a dread gods attention. Any or all of these deities can

be incorporated into an ongoing campaign.

KARAAN

Known primarily as the Beast God, Karaan is a monstrous

entity of savage lust and wanton destruction. Karaan is nor-

mally depicted as a hulking humanoid covered in fur, with

terrible claws and teeth. He resembles no specific animal

but has a predatory appearance.

Karaan represents the dark side of nature, and thus he is

the enemy of Obad-Hai and Ehlonna. He is often revered in

association with Erythnul, although his cults are much

more obscure. A few believe him to be related in some way

to Yeenoghu, though that demon prince is not an actual god.

Karaan is the patron of lycanthropes and bestial creatures

such as bugbears, gnolls, worgs, manticores, and some

sphinxes. His symbols are gnawed, broken bones and

bloody teeth. His favored weapon is the greatclub (though

the bared claw and sharp tooth are just as favored). The

domains he is associated with are Chaos, Destruction, and

Bestial. He is chaotic evil.

Clerics of Karaan are as bestial as the god they serve.

They despise civilization and love to destroy thingspar-

ticularly objects fashioned through craftsmanship, for such

skills are alien to them. They wear furs, hides, or armor in

battle, or they wear nothing at all. Their hair is usually wild

and flowing, and they are given to incoherent screams and

grunts. They often undergo scarification as a part of their

rituals and file their teeth into points if they are not natu-

rally sharp.

Karaans temples are places of natural power: secluded

glens, rocky outcroppings, and deep pits in the wilderness.

They are always full of the bones of their prey, sacrificial vic-

tims, and fallen enemies.

RALLASTER

Rallaster, the Razor God, is a deity of murder, torture, and

psychotic behavior. Religious scholars refer to him as the

Insane God and the God of Madmen, but Rallasters follow-

ers find him completely sane and comprehensible.

Rallaster is normally pictured as a tall, glistening, ebony-

skinned humanoid without hair or wrinkles. Closer inspec-

tion reveals that his entire body is made of razors dripping

with blood and oil to keep the blades sharp and rust-free.

Rallasters symbol is a toothy mouth clamped down on a

bloody, razor-thin blade, and his favored weapon is the short

sword. The domains that Rallaster is associated with are Evil,

Destruction, and Pain. He is chaotic evil.

Rallasters clerics are psychopaths and mass murderers who

lurk in the shadows or discreetly in plain sight. Many act per-

fectly normal, maintaining a second identity as shop clerks or

artisans. Whether they camouflage themselves within society

or remain apart from it, Rallasters minions delight in tortur-

ing and killing their victims, usually in seclusion.

Rallaster has very few temples. His followers are usually

loners, and as such they keep secret shrines just for them-

selves. Each shrine has a small altar made entirely of razors.

THE PATIENT ONE

Waiting in the darkness, the Patient Onealso known as

the Dark Watcheris a strange and alien creature. Always

whispering secrets to itself, the Patient One waits until its

time comes, and then it strikes, destroying or consuming

everything in its path.

Although never actually pictured in its entirety, this god

is known to have many eyes, many mouths, and many

clawed arms around its bulbous body. The Patient Ones

symbol is a mouth surrounded by eyes, always done in dark

colors. The domains it is associated with are Evil, Darkness,

and Corruption, and its favored weapon is the flail. The

Patient One is neutral evil.

Though some humanoids worship this strange being,

many more aberrations revere it. The Patient Ones tem-

ples are towers, often built on high hills in isolated areas.

With beholders and mind flayers as clerics and wor-

shipers, the Patient Ones towers are also found under-

ground. At the apex of each tower is a stone altar, carved to

appear as a mouth surrounded by eyes, stained dark red

with blood.

SCAHROSSAR

Known by all as the Mistress of Exquisite Pain, Scahrossar is

usually portrayed as a woman covered entirely in tight, stud-

ded black leather so that even her face is concealed. She usu-

ally holds a whip and a hook. She is selfish, cruel, and domi-

neering, and so are most of her followers. Scahrossar is

Olidammaras sister, but the two deities have nothing to do

with each otheronly the most obscure religious texts

even mention their relationship. Scahrossar is lawful evil

and is associated with the domains of Evil, Pain, and Death.

Her favored weapon is the whip.

Scahrossars clerics dress as their mistress does, preferring

to hide their identities with leather or iron masks. They are

all sadists (and most are also masochists) who prefer to give

pain rather than actually kill. Sacrificial victims dedicated to

Scahrossar often take days to die, for they are tortured to

deaththe more slowly the better. Scahrossars followers

delight in the sounds of screams and tearing flesh, and

because they try to prolong a victims agony, many are skilled

in the healing arts. In their spare time, the clerics devise new

tortures and new torture devices.

Temples to the Mistress of Exquisite Pain are hidden

behind false facades. The clerics often maintain front busi-

nesses, such as bakeries, dairies, and curiosity shops, with

the temples accessible through hidden doors. The temples

rooms  are  soundproofed  to  muffle  the  cries  of  pain.

Although most of Scahrossars clerics are compulsive about

keeping their temples clean, it is usually impossible to keep

a dribble of blood or a loose tooth from dropping to the floor

at any given time. Altars are usually baroque monstrosities

of spikes, spines, clamps, and chains.

THE XAMMUX

Not a single god, but an entity composed of at least six sepa-

rate beings, the Xammux represents cold, analytical think-

ing taken to its extreme. The Xammux serves as the patron

of utter indifference and of delving into forbidden knowl-

edge through exploration and experimentation.

The symbol of the Xammux is a pair of glistening, razor-

sharp steel calipers. The Xammux is neutral evil. It is associ-

ated with the Evil, Knowledge, and Darkness domains. Its

favored weapon is the short sword (which Xammuxs clerics

call a long knife).

Clerics of the Xammux are cold, uncaring beings who

are fascinated by knowledge. They think nothing of dis-

secting living creatures simply to learn more about their

biology. They place creatures in torture chambers to see

how long they can withstand terrible pain before their psy-

ches crumble.

The temples of the Xammux are stark stone edifices filled

with traps and ingenious locks. White plaster often covers

the interior walls. Altars dedicated to the Xammux are

always made of polished steel.

YEATHAN

God of the evil depths, master of the last gasping breath, and

lord of the deep darkness, Yeathan is a god of the sea. Once a

simple water deity, Yeathan gradually brooded on darker,

more mysterious matters until he became a neutral evil god

of all things foul and malevolent about the sea. Some sahua-

gin, a few kuo-toas, and a fair number of aboleths and their

skum servants revere Yeathan, who is largely unknown

among land-dwellers.

pqs

OTHER EVIL GODS

Creating new evil gods is not difficult. One way to create one is

simply to take any existing deitys portfolio and combine it with

evil. You could create an evil earth deity, an evil fire god, an evil

war god, an evil (bad) luck deity, an evil travel deity, and so on.

In  a  desert,  it  is  easy  to  imagine  an  evil  sun  deity.  You  could

even develop an evil god of healing that gives succorbut at a

terrible price.

pqs

Yeathans temples are always submerged and unlighted,

filled with sharks, octopi, and strange denizens usually

found in only the deepest undersea trenches. His symbol is a

dark bluish-green spiral with a black center. Yeathan is asso-

ciated with the Evil, Destruction, and Water domains, and

his favored weapon is the trident. Yeathan is neutral evil.

Clerics of Yeathan are quiet, brooding individuals with

quick tempers. They wear dark green and black. If they are

not native water-breathers, they are nevertheless accom-

plished swimmers.

VILE RACES AND CULTURES

Sometimes, an entire culture or race is evil. Examples of evil

races can be found by examining the Monster Manual entries

for drow, duergar, orcs, and mind flayers. Following are

some examples of cultures (subdivisions of existing races)

that are thoroughly evil.

VASHAR

There is a legend that few tell of a race known as the Vashar.

Intelligent beings do not speak of the legend not only

because of the darkness involved but also because of the

shame.

When the gods set out to create humanity, they formed

the first man and gave him life. According to the legend of

the Vashar, the first man immediately began hunting in the

wilderness while the gods watched their new creation with

curiosity. The man found an animal and killed it with his

bare hands. The gods were surprised by the brutality, but

they continued to watch. The man ate the animals flesh and

tore away at its guts until he found some large bones. It

lashed these bones together with tendons and sinew, demon-

strating a cleverness that further surprised the deities.

Then the man broke one of the bones so that it had a

sharp point, creating a weapon. He immediately turned

upon his creators and attempted to kill them, snarling his

first wordscurses and death-oaths. The deities were in no

danger, of course, but they were disgusted by what they had

wrought. They destroyed the man and left. They would

return in later eons to create humanity, learning from the

mistakes made in their first attempt.

After they left, a demon gathered the remains of the first

man and spirited them away to a hidden locationan

impossibly high plateau accessible only through a series of

underground catacombs filled with foul corruptions of

nature. There, the demon resurrected the man and created a

woman. The demon bestowed upon them the ability to pro-

create, then disappeared back to the Abyss with an evil grin.

Many versions of the legend name the demon Grazzt,

before he became a demon lord, as the one whose dark hand

fashioned these two. A few others call the fiend an ultroloth.

One version describes the demon as a succubus who actu-

ally gives birth to the mans children, imbuing the race with

demonic blood.

This, it is said, is the origin of the Vasharan people.

Vasharans are humans, but they are to other humans as

drow are to elves. In a normal human society, evil individu-

als are mixed amid the neutral and good people, but Vasha-

rans are evil as a race. Vasharans rarely call themselves evil,

but they do not object to others putting that label on them.

They claim to be beyond such terms.

All Vasharans are born out of rape, anger, and pain. They

understand only hate, selfishness, and greed. Yet as much as

they love to kill and maim, one goal fuels their souls even

more strongly: deicide. The Vasharans want to kill the

deities that created them. This burning hunger for god-

death keeps them bound together as a reluctant society.

While Vasharans sometimes kill other Vasharans, it is a rare

act despite their bloodthirsty, destructive, and utterly

immoral nature.

Personality: Vasharans do not understand concepts such

as mercy, kindness, or lovenot even toward each other.

These concepts are so alien to them that they rarely think to

use the emotions of others as leverage. For example, only a

Vasharan with years of experience among other humanoids

would kidnap someone; most would not even consider that

the victims friends might actually value her life. Vasharans

also show no revulsion for creatures or acts that other

humans find repellent. They have no aversion to gore or

filth, they have no taboos against rape and incest, and they

have no distaste for creatures such as insects, serpents, and

worms. If a Vasharan believes that eating maggots will

somehow help her, she wont hesitate to do so.

Physical Description: A typical Vasharan stands a little

more than 6 feet tall and weighs from 175 to 210 pounds.

The  males  are  noticeably  taller  and  heavier  than  the

females. Vasharan skin shades range from fair to very pale,

their hair is straight and black, and the men generally have

facial hair. Like humans, Vasharans have short life spans,

achieving adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living

beyond a century.

Relations: Other races generally treat Vasharans as they

do other humans, because few know the difference. While

abroad, Vasharans treat other races as humans do.

Alignment: Any evil.

Vasharan Lands: The plateau of Vashar is extremely well

defended, with traps and enslaved guardian monsters filling

the cavern entrances. The Vasharans leave to capture slaves

or to steal items they need (though they rarely need any-

thing from the outside world). Captured Vasharans may

speak of a terrible plan, in the works for centuries, that is

finally nearing fruition, but they know no details. Given

Vasharan history, the plan likely involves deicide.

The people of Vashar have evolved into a fairly sophisti-

cated and organized culture, despite their collective destruc-

tive demeanor. A council of elders elected through demo-

cratic means rules Vasharthe Vasharans would never abide

a despot and would all die before submitting to tyranny. The

council members are simply administrators, because Vasha-

rans have few laws. They do what they want and take what

they want, and each defends himself as well as he can. Some-

how, this system of government worksmostly because of

the hatred that binds the Vasharans together and their utter

incomprehension that life could be lived any other way.

Religion: None.

Language: Vasharans speak Common. They typically

learn other languages, including obscure ones. In addition,

they are particularly likely to pick up a few lesser words of

the Dark Speech (see Chapter 2).

Names: As humans.

Adventurers: Vasharans favor arcane magic. Many take

up the wizard class, and many others are born into sorcery.

Vasharan spellcasters thrive on corrupt spells and evil

magic, and they develop new spells all the time. Despite

their distaste for divine magic, the Vasharans do have a few

clerics of a sort, called ur-priests. These individuals do not

channel power from the godsthey steal it. The Vasharans

claim that the proper role of the cleric is not to serve, but to

take. Vasharan fighters, rogues, assassins, blackguards, shad-

owdancers, loremasters, warriors of darkness, cancer mages,

vermin lords, and diabolists are also common. A very few

Vasharans are rangers or demonologists. Vasharans are

never druids, bards, barbarians, or any of the disciple or

thrall prestige classes. (See Chapter 5 for descriptions of the

evil prestige classes mentioned above.)

Vasharan Racial Traits

Medium-size: As Medium-size creatures, Vasharans have

no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Vasharan base speed is 30 feet.

Because they are vile to the core, Vasharans each receive 1

extra vile feat at 1st level. See Chapter 4 for a description

of vile feats.

A Vasharan receives 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1

extra skill point at each additional level. Like humans,

they are versatile and capable. (The 4 skill points at first

level are added on as a bonus, not multiplied in.)

Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Any

(other than secret languages such as Druidic). See other

racial lists for common languages or Table 46: Lan-

guages in the Players Handbook for a more comprehensive

list. See also the rules for Dark Speech in Chapter 2 of

this book.

Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass

Vasharan takes an experience point penalty, his highest-level

class does not count. (See Experience for Multiclass Charac-

ters in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook.)

JERREN

Jerren are halflings, although they despise that name.

About two hundred years ago, the Jerren were typical

nomadic halflings who inhabited a wide prairie. Every

OTHER VILE RACES AND CULTURES

Any evil monster can easily be thought of as a member of an

evil racelamia, sahuagin, driders, dark naga, or umber hulks

could all develop their own evil societies. It is not hard to imag-

ine other evil cultures, either. Just take a look at the evil villains

discussed  below  and  extrapolate.  For  example,  a  tyrannical

state could exist in which everyone conforms to the evil rulers

will or faces death. The people there are eager to turn on their

fellows to get ahead in this cutthroat culture.

spring, they were beset by goblins and bugbears from the

nearby hills. These raids cost the Jerren dearly in lives and

food, eventually threatening to wipe out the halflings

entirely. The leaders of the various Jerren clans gathered

one winter and made a harsh decision. They called upon all

the spellcasters among the Jerren and gave them access to

corrupt magic secured from a secret source. They armed

each warrior with terrible poisons and weapons designed

to spread disease and plague among the goblinoids.

The next spring, the ensuing war between the Jerren

and their enemies threatened to wipe out both sides.

Blood stained the prairie. Even with their new tactics, the

Jerren would have lost, except that their previous decision

opened  the  door  to  further  malevolence.  Soon  the

halflings were committing atrocities against their ene-

mies that even the goblins and bugbears found repulsive.

When the latter retreated into the hills, the Jerren fol-

lowed them. Soon all that remained of the goblinoids

were heads upon spikes positioned throughout the hills

and grisly scenes that suggested bloody sacrifices made to

evil gods.

Today, the plains are inhabited by terrible bands of

vicious halflings who seek to overcome, feed upon, and cor-

rupt all those they can hunt down and catch. All travelers

and prairie-dwellers fear Jerren hunters.

Personality: Jerren are ruled by strength and blood lust.

No leader can manage to control more than a small band of

these chaotic and evil halflings, and those who show even

the slightest bit of weakness or mercy are quickly cut down

and devoured by the others. Like other halflings, Jerren live

a nomadic lifestyle. They prey upon others for their food

and most of their goods. The only things Jerren produce are

instruments of war and tortureand the poisons for which

they are now infamous.

Physical Description: A Jerren is physically indistin-

guishable from a lightfoot halfling, but its evil is so palpa-

ble  that  no  one  would  ever  mistake  it  for  a  normal

halfling. In their rituals to dark deities such as Karaan,

Erythnul, Rallaster, and the unnamed power revered by

their ancestors, Jerren cover themselves with ritual scars

and self-inflicted wounds. Jerren are always angry, bitter,

and savage. They are always sadists and often masochists

as well.

Relations: Jerren prey upon any living creature that

crosses their path. They crave blood and sacrifices to feed

the insatiable hunger of the deities to whom they have

sworn allegiance. Jerren seek victims to experiment upon

with their newly concocted poisons, corrupt spells, and

specially fostered diseases.

Alignment: Any evil.

Jerren Lands: Jerren bands claim stretches of plains,

prairie, and desert, far from any bastion of civilization. They

are nomadic, and the race is broken up into tribal bands

that each claim large stretches of territory. When different

THE BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS

The  original  book  of  vile  darkness  was  a  scroll  penned  by  a

Vasharan  spellcaster  millennia  ago.  It  contained  his  wicked

thoughts  and  the  terrible  knowledge  that  he  had  gained

through  experimentation  and  study.  In  just  a  few  thousand

words, he recorded malevolent ideas and concepts so vile that

to this day they have never occurred to another, not even the

foulest soul. Years later, the scroll was discovered by a cleric of

Nerull.  She  added  to  it,  tripling  its  length  by  recording  her

knowledge of dark gods, sacrifice, and evil divine magic. Many

other evil priests learned from her scrolls (for the manuscript

soon became too long for just one scroll), adding bits of knowl-

edge  from  their  own  polluted  minds  and  abominable  experi-

ments.  Some  writers  even  asked  questions  of  summoned

fiends and recorded their words directly.

Eventually the collected works fell into the hands of a geno-

cidal wizard and warlord named Vecna. He took the scrolls and

added some of his own discoveries to them. After he died and

rose as a lich, Vecna transcribed the scrolls into a bound book,

creating its cover from the flesh of a human face and the bones

of a demon, magically transformed into a dull metal binding. It

is said that the strange symbols on the cover are understand-

able only by those who have read the book in its entirety, and

that  the  sudden  realization  of  the  utter  wickedness  that  they

representa  darkness  so  deep  that  it  shames  hell  itselfis

why the book is so highly prized.

most  of  them  were  incomplete  or  flawed  in  some  way.  The

errors  contained  in  these  lesser  copies  usually  caused  the

reader to be drawn onto one of the Lower Planes, never to be

seen again.

Thieves stole the original during a great war, and the book

passed  through  many  hands  after  that.  According  to  some

records,  the  demon  lord  Baalzebul  kept  the  book  in  his

personal library for a time, adding a few pages of his own. Six

complete  copies  are  known  to  exist,  at  least  one  of  which

was  made  after  Baalzebuls  alteration.  At  least  three  times

that  number  of  flawed  copies  or  outright  fakes  also  exist.

These books are often found in evil temples, dark libraries,

and  the  hands  of  wicked  collectors.  Vecnas  original  still

exists as well, and it is a prize coveted by almost every priest

of a dark god.

The book is a fantastic reference work of evil deities, black

magic,  sacrifice,  and  forbidden  secrets.  Its  lore  is  so  potent

and  so  dark  that  nonevil  creatures  that  read  its  contents  are

often corrupted to evil through defilement rather than tempta-

tion. Once a mind has absorbed the knowledge in this book,

the attached soul is so polluted that there is no recourse other

than to turn to evil.

Unlike  its  good  counterpart,  the  book  of  exalted  deeds,  the

book of vile darkness does not mysteriously disappear after it is

read. An evil character is likely to keep it around for reference,

although not even the darkest-hearted villain peruses its pages

haphazardly.  Powerful  fiends  watch  over  the  book,  because

where it goes, evil power grows.

Cultists  loyal  to  Erythnul  held  the  book  in  a  dim  vault  for

many years, using it as a final initiation into their innermost

circle.  A  few  copies  were  made  during  this  time,  although

Jerren bands meet by chance, they may turn upon each

other, their base nature overcoming their desire to honor

their common heritage.

Religion: Not particularly pious, Jerren may give lip

service to any evil power. However, they all secretly revere

an unnamed power, the power their elders long ago bar-

gained with to secure their victory at the cost of the corrup-

tion of their race.

Language: Jerren speak a guttural dialect of Halfling,

which uses the Common script (though Jerren rarely write

at all). Almost all also speak Common.

Names: A Jerren typically chooses a name that helps her

make the impression she wants to make. If she wants to be

known for slaying the kin of her enemies, she chooses a

name such as Kinslayer. If she wants to be known as a

terror to all she meets, she picks a name such as Blood-

spray.

Adventurers: Jerren  are  drawn  almost  invariably

toward violent careers in which they can kill, degrade, and

enslave others. Thus, rogues, assassins, blackguards, and

many of the prestige classes in this book are ideal for

Jerren.

THE BOORISH THUG

Perhaps the simplest sort of villain is the crude, selfish oaf

who just takes what he wants. His desires rarely go beyond

simple wealth or privilege, although he might crave some-

thing as significant as respect.

Driven by basic needs and desires, this villain does not

employ subtle or sophisticated methods. He is straightfor-

ward, and the only weapon he employs is brute force. If he

has assistance or allies, they are likely to be just like him,

since companions who are not like him cannot long tolerate

his presence.

Example: Trendan Resh (NE male human Ftr2/Rog4) is a

criminal who has lived all his life in the big city. Since his

youth, Trendan has run a small gang of other young toughs.

None of them seek gainful employmentthey would

rather waylay visitors to the city or steal from the drunks in

the alleyways behind Tavern Row. Trendan is cowardly, lazy,

and crude. He isnt even particularly skilled at fighting, but

he knows how to crack people on the back of the head with

a club when they arent looking.

THE TYRANT

Jerren Racial Traits

+2 Dexterity, 2 Strength: Jerren are quick, agile, and

skilled with ranged weapons, but they are Small and

therefore not as strong as other humanoids.

Small: As Small creatures, Jerren gain a +1 size bonus to

Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size

bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller weapons

than humans use, and their lifting and carrying limits are

three-quarters of those of Medium-size characters.

Jerren base speed is 20 feet.

+2 racial bonus on Intimidate, Bluff, and Move Silently

checks. Jerren are scary, untruthful, and sneaky.

+1 racial bonus on all saving throws. Jerren are surpris-

ingly capable of avoiding mishaps.

+2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. (This

bonus stacks with Jerrens +1 bonus on saving throws in

general.)

+1 racial bonus on attack rolls with a thrown weapon.

Jerren delight in inflicting harm from afar.

+2 racial bonus on Listen checks. Jerren are quite skilled

in overhearing secrets.

Automatic Languages: Common and Halfling. Bonus

Languages: Infernal, Abyssal, Goblin, and Orc.

Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass Jerrens rogue class

does not count when determining whether she takes an

experience point penalty for multiclassing. Jerren delight

in stealth, sly tricks, and lies, and the vocation of rogue

comes naturally to them.

CREATING VILLAINS

If you understand evil, you can create villains with appro-

priate personalities and motives. The following examples

detail some villains whose activities reflect the aspects of

evil described above.

The classic power-mad villain craves domination over all

that he seeslands, people, and magic. He can be a ruler, a

would-be ruler, or a loner who desires physical domination

more than political power.

A tyrant villain might be a powerful cleric leading legions

of fanatic soldiers or a scheming crime lord who runs all

manner of illegal operations in the heart of a city. Other

tyrants include the petty megalomaniac ruler who wishes to

expand her holdings and isnt afraid to tax her people to

death to do so, and the bookish wizard who studies alone,

cloistered in a library for years, so that he can learn the spells

that will let him take over the world.

The tyrant generally uses minions to accomplish what he

wants. He believes that he is superior to others and thus

should not have to sully himself with minor deeds. He

orders paid mercenaries around and manipulates others

with magic. Some tyrants create their own minions, ranging

from constructs to slaves to blackmail victims coerced into

working for him. A tyrants schemes are usually fairly

sophisticated, although not all tyrants are smart. Sometimes

a tyrant is nothing more than a power-hungry simpleton,

dangerous only because he was born into a position of favor.

Example: Ystan the Graylord (CE male dwarf Wiz15)

seeks to take over the area around Mount Exalt through the

use of his undead minions. However, he does not yet possess

the might to animate an army large enough to assault the

walled city of Kachel alone, so he has spent years questing

for a magic artifact that can dominate the wills of others.

With undead and mentally enslaved soldiers, Ystan can

launch his assault. Thus begins Ystans dream of a vast and

terrible empire.

Ystan carries a special item called the skull of past splendor,

which has all the powers of a rod of splendor. Additionally, it

confers the memories once contained in the skull to the

owner, granting Ystan a +2 circumstance bonus on his

Knowledge and Spellcraft checks.

THE SCHEMING LIAR

The slippery weasel, the cunning thief, the silver-tongued

roguethese villains present different dangers than brutes

and psychopaths do, but they are dangerous foes nonethe-

less. These enemies are far more likely to slip a dagger in

someones ribs while he sleeps than fight him face to face.

Or better yet, thinks the schemer, shell just frame someone

for murder and let the authorities hang him in the public

square. Such diabolic malefactors spin a web of deceit wher-

ever they go. Schemers know just what to say and who to

say it to in order to get what they want.

Scheming liars can be political manipulators who use

others to accomplish their goals. They do not go against

the laws and rules; they make laws and rules work for

them, bending and twisting the words as needed. They

dont truly respect the law, but they want to avoid the

appearance of breaking it. Such villains are difficult to

defeat, and its even harder to prove that they are villains in

the first place.

Example: Narma Glitterhome (CE female gnome Wiz8)

serves as a butler to Lord Feddin Spritestar, a powerful and

influential gnome. What most people do not realize is that

Narma has the lords ear and frequently gives him advice

about the rulership of his demesne. But Lord Spritestar does

not know that Narma is manipulating him into a war against

the nearby kobold tribes of Bloodwall.

Narma is an illusionist who frequently travels to Blood-

wall in the guise of a male kobold to manipulate the council

of chieftains there. If war breaks out, Narma is poised to

assume a third identity: the long-lost gnome queen Halli

Guttenstone, who will save the gnomes from the kobolds

and become ruler of the land.

Narma wears a ring precious to her, the ring of many faces,

which grants her the use of polymorph self three times per day

and a +10 profane bonus on her Disguise checks.

THE PSYCHOPATH

Some villains focus on the act of evil itself, rather than on

the goals an evil act helps them reach. They revel in killing,

inflicting pain, and spreading misery. The motives and

methods of psychopaths vary greatly. Some creatures are

born psychopathiclamias, destrachans, orcs, beholders,

and black dragons, for example. These monsters are evil

through and through, and they delight in death and misery.

Their love of killing for its own sake makes them far more

dangerous than monsters that simply kill to eat, such as the

ankheg or the remorhaz.

Human, elf, dwarf, halfling, and gnome psychopaths are

no less varied. Some are clean and efficient at what they do.

They sneak up on their victims quietly and make sure that

when they are finished, no evidence ties the murderer to the

murder. Other psychopaths are far more blatant and direct.

They do not care who knows of their activities, and they

relish their victims fear of death almost as much as they

enjoy the pain and the killing itself. Often, such psy-

chopaths have positions of power that keep anyone from

easily putting a stop to their terrible activities.

Example: Reynod (NE male human vampire Rog6/

Asn4) is the henchman of a powerful criminal overlord.

Most of the crime lords other henchmen expect a bonus

when they eliminate one of the syndicates enemies. After

all, killing is a dangerous and dirty business. Not so with

Reynod, who delights in killing. In fact, the crime lord

worries about what might happen if he didnt give Reynod

someone to kill every so often. Reynod loves the use of

knives; he owns a collection of them that numbers more

than three hundred. He is sneaky, subtle, and sly. Reynods

victims rarely know what is coming because he is so effi-

cient at shadowing, then approaching his prey. Not even

Reynods criminal employer knows that he is actually a

vampire.

Reynod wears an amulet he calls fathers tooth. The fang-

shaped tooth grants Reynod an additional +4 turn resistance.

THE SOPHISTICATE

A villain can be a horrible murderer or a lying cheat and yet

still retain a veneer of sophistication. This type of villain can

be a foppish rogue without a conscience or a dispassionate

overlord who enjoys a sampling of fine elven wines while

watching the execution of prisoners.

Sophisticated villains are sometimes the evildoers that no

one suspects. Only a thorough investigation can prove their

terrible deeds. Urbane villains are able to convince most

people that they are noble, civilized individuals. In other

cases, these villains are known for what they truly are, but

they still believe themselves to be cultured and sophisti-

cated, and they conduct themselves accordinglyeven as

they commit atrocities.

Example: Duchess Winsone DArtreda (LE female human

Ari13) rules over a vast, wooded realm. All know her as a beau-

tiful, well-mannered, and sophisticated woman. Unknown to

most, however, she is also a sadist and a cold-blooded killer.

She has a secret set of chambers in the dungeons below her

castle where she keeps her victims. Winsone has a strange

code of honor: She preys only upon the lower class or upon

intelligent nonhumanoid creatures. Her secret hunters make

raids upon outlying villages or scour the woods for pixies,

dryads, and even the occasional centaur.

Winsone delights in the use of her custom-made whip of

many thongs, which grants her a +2 circumstance bonus on

Intimidate checks when she uses it in her midnight torture

sessions.

THE MISGUIDED FOOL

Some villains do not even know that they are villains.

Deluded through insanity, religious belief, or just stupid-

ity, they commit horrible acts and never realize what it is

that they do. A foolish villain might suspect that his acts

and thoughts are tainted, but hes too apathetic to try to

uncover the truth. Blindly committing evil acts because it

is  just  easier  that  way,  the  misguided  fool  can  easily

become a truly sinister villain over time, continuing his

evil deeds while his own perceptions veer ever farther

from reality.

his god, and the radical racial purist are all examples of the

misguided fool.

Example: Nerence Unger (NE male human Exp5) is the

leader of a school for young boys. Every few months, two

men come to Nerences office and give him a large bag of

gold. At the same time, one of the boysone whom Ner-

ence has recently put on record as a troublemakerdisap-

pears. Nerence says nothing. He just counts his gold. He

tells himself that he did not do anything wrong.

THE MONSTER

The monster villain craves killing, lives in filth, and seeks to

destroy everything that he encounters. More depraved than

psychopaths or sadists, this creature is beyond redemption.

This villain is practically a demon or a devil in his own right.

He drinks the blood of his enemies and allows it to run down

his chin and over his chest. No act is too distasteful for him.

Example: Like many evil warlords, Agrattanath (LE male

hobgoblin Bbn9) kills his foes with impunity. But what

Agrattanath really enjoys is killing the children of his dead

foes slowly and then feasting on their quivering hearts.

When he goes into battle, he leads troops into combat with

what appears to be bravery but is actually blood lust. Even

Agrattanaths own tribe is afraid of him, for it is clear that he

would just as willingly kill them and devour their childrens

hearts if he did not have enemies to kill.

Agrattanath wields a mace whose head is the petrified

head of an elflord named Yessef. It is treated as a +3 mace of

life-drinking (as the life-drinker greataxe described in Chapter

8 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

THE UNEXPECTED VILLAIN

Sometimes, evil doesnt show up where your players expect

it. A trusted servant can abuse his position to steal and

gather secrets for blackmail. A cleric of Pelor might actually

be a werewolf. The drug-addicted farmers wife will do any-

thing to feed her addictioneven kill. The respected healer

in town is in the pay of the local slavers ring. The unex-

pected villain usually also belongs to one of the other vil-

lainous categories.

Sometimes the villain is obviously evil, but there is more

to him than first appears. A mind flayer might be possessed

by a devil, for example, or an evil wizard could really be a

polymorphed dragon.

Example: Once every six hundred years, an elf child is

born with supernatural talent and intelligence. Known as

the shadowchild, this being has the mind of a dispassionate

killer and many special powers. To all outward appearances,

however, the shadowchild is a normal elf child.

In the elf village of Daerthane, young Taetra Featherfall

(CE female elf half-fiend) seems like all the other children

scampering about the village and the surrounding woods.

She is not. She is the shadowchild, and the disappearances

near Daerthane of late are because of her, not the nearby

clutch of owlbears currently being tracked by the villages

rangers. Taetra is extremely careful when she abducts and

sacrifices other children. She has no desire to expose herself

before she is old enough to reveal her true nature.

EXAMPLE VILLAINS

The following villains can be easily adapted for most D&D

campaigns. They utilize many of the feats, prestige classes,

spells, magic items, and new rules found in this book.

THE DREAD EMPEROR

One of the most arresting figures anywhere is the Dread

Emperor. This striking human male stands 6 1/2 feet tall. He

wears golden plate armor and a long red cloak, and he car-

ries a mirrored shield, although he bears no weapons. What

is most shocking is that he walks about with four children

in tow, each wearing an iron collar chained to his armor. The

children  shuffle  behind  the  Dread  Emperor  as  if  in  a

stuporthey do not appear to be treated well.

No one knows this mans real name. The Dread Emperor

claims to be the Emperor of the World. Although this claim

isnt true, the Dread Emperor is extremely powerful. Anyone

who tells him that he doesnt rule all he surveys is likely to

be dead soon.

Aside from the four children (and its not always the same

four children) chained to his armor, the Dread Emperor

keeps to himself. His lonely (but well-warded) fortress is

located on the Ethereal Plane, accessible via a hidden portal

in a high mountain cave. Occasionally the Dread Emperor

comes to a city to sell a magic item he has created, but he

keeps to the shadier parts of town because only the most

depraved are willing to deal with him. Upstanding, moral

people often attempt to rescue the children, so the Dread

Emperor has to kill the do-gooders and usually destroy a few

city blocks in the process.

The Dread Emperor sometimes bargains for some bit of

information, a magic item, or a spell. Those who study him

claim that his sole motivation is to gather more personal

magical power for himself, at any cost. He has been particu-

larly interested in defensive items lately.

The Dread Emperor is clearly insane, but his isnt the cack-

ling, madcap sort of insanity. He is delusional, paranoid, and

psychotic. He does not delight in the suffering of others, but

he has not an ounce of compassion or empathy. If left alone,

the Dread Emperor is content to keep to himself and remain

unobtrusive. However, the children he keeps in tow often

tempt would-be heroes to attack him, so he sometimes finds

himself in battle when he moves among other people. When

that happens, he does not hesitate to kill hundreds in the

process of slaying a single target. One of his favorite tactics is

to cast haste on himself and follow that with meteor swarm, a

corrupted maximized fireball, and a corrupted quickened fire-

ball all in a single round. Another favorite tactic is to use mass

charm to get any and all bystanders on his side while some

hero or constable attempts to accost him. He sometimes

charms his assailants as well, although they are usually found

dead later even if they were charmed into submission.

SIDDAL AND GAUDERIS

Siddal, a medusa cancer mage, and Gauderis, a half-orc

vermin lord, have formed a strange alliance. They live in an

isolated cave complex teeming with insects, worms, and all

manner of other vermin, as well as an otyugh. These two,

working together, are attempting to develop new, more vir-

ulent strains of existing diseases, in the hope of spreading

them throughout civilization. Although originally they

sought to spread disease in order to drive back encroaching

farm communities, their work is now for pure psychopathic

pleasure. A visitor must make an appropriate saving throw

to avoid infection with a random disease for every round

spent in their caves.

Siddal felt the Calling (see the Calling section in Chap-

ter 2) and returned with a flesheater rod, the knowledge she

needed to become a cancer mage, and a taste for maso-

chism and self-mutilation. Driven away by her four sisters,

who found her repulsive even by their standards, Siddal

eventually found a kindred soul in Gauderis. She keeps her

gaze attack from harming him or the vermin and rat ser-

vants in the caves by wearing a veil. Even so, Siddal does

not hesitate to put her allies at risk if it might save her from

some threat.

Gauderis is secretly in love with Siddal in all her diseased

glory. He believes that there is a secret ecstasy in being pet-

rified by her gaze, and he longs for it. For now, Gauderis tries

to win her pleasure by continuing his experiments with

new diseases. If that doesnt gain Siddals favor, Gauderis

plans to drug her to bring her guard down, then to stand

exultantly in full view of her petrifying gaze.

Spew Vermin (Sp): Once per day, Gauderis can spray a

swarm of vermin from his mouth in a 30-foot cone. Anyone

animal companions.

Chitin (Ex): Gauderis has a +3 natural armor bonus to AC

from his chitinous plates (already included in the above

statistics).

(their species and special traits) with perfect accuracy. He

can determine whether water is safe to drink or dangerous.

Resist Natures Lure: Gauderis gains a +4 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as

dryads, nymphs, and sprites).

Swarm Armor (Su): When he prepares spells each day,

covers his flesh. These insects absorb up to 10 points of

damage from any single attack that deals hit point damage.

The swarm armor disappears when it has absorbed 35 points

of damage.

Trackless Step: Gauderis leaves no trail in natural sur-

roundings and cannot be tracked.

ical beasts with Int 9, 34 hp, improved evasion, and an

empathic link with Gauderis. Gauderis can speak with them,

share spells with them, and use them to deliver touch spells.

The creatures can speak with others of their kind. The cen-

tipede has Atk +7 melee (1d61 plus poison, bite); SV Fort

+7, Ref +6, Will +10. The praying mantis has Atk +12 melee

(1d8+4, claws) and +7 melee (1d6+2, bite), and SV Fort +9,

Ref +3, Will +12; Listen +10. Both are AC 20.

Wild Shape (Sp): Gauderis can assume animal forms as

noted above, but he may assume only one form per use of

the ability. He regains hit points as if he had rested for a day

and is never disoriented while in wild shape. He gains all the

creatures natural and extraordinary abilities when he adopts

its form.

Wings of the Vermin (Su): Once per day as a standard

action, buzzing insectoid wings grow from Gauderiss back

for up to 1 hour. With these wings, Gauderis has a fly speed

of 30 ft. (average).

Woodland Stride: Gauderis may move through natural

thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain at his

pqs

ENESSTRERE,

THE DEMON-POSSESSED DRAGON

Enesstrere was a typical blue dragon. He lived an ordinary

blue dragon life from beginning to end. He gathered a typi-

cal hoard and found himself a nice desert lair in a dry, cool

cave. He mated, and eventually his mate left. He approached

the end of his life with dignity and power.

Then Ykkandri came, and everything changed.

Ykkandri is a demon. He was a glabrezu, but he shed his

physical form so that he could travel throughout the Mate-

rial Plane as a possessor demon. Eventually, Ykkandri found

Enesstrere, and after a titanic battle of wills he took control

of the dragon. The first thing Ykkandri did was force Enes-

strere to ingest the drug luhix and succumb to its addictive

effects. From within Enesstreres mind, Ykkandri cackled

with glee, overjoyed that a nasty trick he had learned while

dwelling among (and possessing) humans was so useful.

A quasit brings Enesstrere one dose of luhix each day. If

Enesstrere should ever manage to rid himself of Ykkandri,

he would be stuck out in the middle of the desert with no

way of getting the drug.

Ykkandri, so far, is biding his time. As an experiment to

test  the  dragons  abilities,  Ykkandri  flew  to  a  nearby

monastery and sacked it, killing all the monks inside. Since

then, the monastery has become a secret base for a number

of demons. Rumors of a demonic invasion are now circulat-

ing among the tribes of the desert. If they prove to be true, it

is likely that the demonic army will have an ancient blue

dragon as its spearhead.

Breath Weapon (Su):

Line of lightning, 120 ft.

long, every 1d4 rounds;

damage 20d8, Reflex DC

34 half.

Crush: When flying

or jumping, Enesstrere

can  land  on  Medium-

size  or  smaller  oppo-

nents as a standard ac-

tion,  using  his  whole

body to crush them. A

crush  attack  affects  as

many creatures as can fit

under the dragons body.

Each  creature  in  the  af-

fected area must succeed

at a Reflex save (DC 34) or

be pinned. If Enesstrere

chooses to maintain the

pin,  treat  it  as  a  normal

grapple  attack

(grapple

bonus +58). The opponent

automatically takes 4d6+19

points of bludgeoning damage

each round that it remains pinned.

Create/Destroy Water (Sp): Three times per day, Enesstrere

can produce an effect that functions like the create water

spell except that he can decide to destroy water instead of

creating it, which automatically spoils liquids containing

water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in creatures

possessions must succeed at a Will save (DC 29) or be

ruined.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Enesstrere can unsettle foes

with his mere presence. This ability takes effect automati-

cally (300-foot radius) whenever the dragon attacks, charges,

or flies overhead. A potentially affected creature (one with

less than 33 HD) that succeeds at a Will save (DC 29)

remains immune to Enesstreres frightful presence for 24

hours. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomes

panicked for 4d6 rounds, and one with more than 5 HD

becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds.

Sound Imitation (Ex): This dragon can mimic any voice

or sound it has heard anytime it likes. Listeners must suc-

ceed at a Will save (DC 29) to detect the ruse.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayventriloquism; 1/day

hallucinatory terrain, veil. Caster level 13th; save DC 13 +

spell level.

Tail Sweep: Enesstrere can sweep with his tail as a stan-

dard action. The sweep affects a half circle with a diameter of

30 feet, centered on his rear. Each Small or smaller character

within the swept area takes 2d6+19 points of damage (Reflex

DC 34 half ).

Blindsight (Ex): Dragons can ascertain creatures by non-

visual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing

vibrations and other environmental clues).

Immunities (Ex): Immune to sleep, electricity, and

paralysis.

Keen Senses (Ex): Dragons can see four

times as well humans in low-light conditions

and twice as well in

normal  light.  Enes-

strere has darkvision

with  a  range  of  1,000

feet.

Feats: A creature that

is  flung  by Enesstrere

after  being  snatched

travels  100  feet  and

takes  10d6  points  of

damage. If Enesstrere is

flying, the creature takes

this damage or the appro-

priate  falling  damage,

whichever is greater.

MALIGN SITES

Below are two examples of terrible places that you can use in

your campaign.

THE AZURE VALE

When the warlord-wizard Lahm the Obsessor sacked Faen-

ish-Kul, he captured all the citizens of the city and gave one

to each of his orc and ogre servants. He commanded each

warrior to kill his prisoner on his signal. On that day, nine

thousand people all died at once, at the whim of one man.

Lahm committed this vile act simply because he could.

Lahms armies moved on and eventually met defeat, but

the area around Faenish-Kul, known as the Azure Vale, has

never been the same. This place of lasting evil has since

been home to strange, extremely pale plants, and the whole

area has an unnatural chill that lasts even through the hot

summer months.

Anyone who spends the night in the mist-shrouded

valley hears faint whispers and sometimes even moans. His

or her dreams are filled with nightmares of murder and

hate. But the visitors who come to the vale and encounter

only whispers and bad dreams are the lucky ones, for the

Azure Vale is haunted by the spirits of nine thousand ghosts.

Every person slain by the legions of Lahm remains here

and they all want vengeance upon the living.

Those who make it out of the vale alive have harrowing

tales to tell, but despite the horrible stories, the Azure Vale

attracts adventurers. A powerful minor artifact, the amulet of

Lahm, is said to lie amid the pale trees, lost in the confusion

of that fateful night. Among its other powers, the amulet

grants its possessor the ability to regenerate like a troll as

well as a +6 bonus to Strength.

THE GOBLIN PITS OF IO-RACH

Kezzerug is a goblin chief who rules the large tribe known

as the Io-Rach (which in Goblin means something very

close to bloody eye lying on the ground). When Kezzerugs

warriors met defeat at the hands of a small band of elves, he

decided that something needed to be done. Kezzerug com-

manded the tribes three adepts to begin working on a magi-

cal way to improve the puissance of the Io-Rach tribe. After

years of trial and error, they hit upon a plan.

After filling large pits with alchemical mixtures, the Io-

Rach tribe lowers its warriors on harnesses into the brew for as

long as the goblins can stand it. When a goblin is brought out

of the pit, he spends the next few days undergoing an agoniz-

ing change. One-quarter of such warriors die a howling death.

Each of the others grows to Medium-size and gains a +4 inher-

ent bonus to Strength and Constitution and a 4 inherent

penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These war-

riors become misshapen, lumbering mutants with twisted

limbs, bulbous eyes, and festering sores.

After creating a large number of these twisted goblins, the

adepts began experimenting on other captured creatures.

None of the experiments have been as successful as the

goblin warriors, but the pits have spawned many strange

creaturesand the progeny of those that are capable of

reproduction are even stranger.

In this way, the Io-Rach tribe has amassed great power. Its

underground lair has spread, and the pits are now innumer-

able. Terrible, twisted things roam those caves, and goblin

marauders scour the countryside for the alchemical ingredi-

ents needed for the procedures, including such items as

human brains and blood.

he following are new rules covering particularly

evil topicspossession, sacrifice, curses, and so

on. These rules may or may not be suitable for your

campaign. Consider each carefully.

POSSESSION

Some fiends with at least 4 Hit Dice and a Charisma score

of at least 13 have the spell-like ability to shuck their phys-

ical forms and take on an ethereal form that allows them to

possess another creature or an object.

The creatures new form is ethereal and thus immune to

even the most potent physical attacks and most magical

attacks (except, for example, force attacks) by nonethereal

creatures. When a fiend possesses a creature or object, even

force effects no longer affect the fiend. Only spells such as

dismissal can affect the possessing fiend when cast by

nonethereal creatures. Any sort of attack, magical or other-

wise, directed against the fiend affects the possessed crea-

ture or object, however.

While a fiend is in ethereal form, its corporeal body lies

senseless, as if in a state of suspended animation. The body

does not require food or air, but damage or exposure to an

extreme environment will kill it. A fiend can roam ethereally

as long as it wants, but an ethereal fiend dies if its body is

destroyed, and it instantly returns to its body if dispel magic (or

a similar effect) is successfully cast on the fiends body.

The caster level for the fiends possession ability is

equal to the fiends Hit Dice. Fiends with the posses-

sion ability generally have a Challenge Rating 2

higher than the standard fiends of their kind. For

example, a succubus with the possession ability is

CR 11.

Once a fiend is on the Ethereal Plane, it generally

floats through the world insubstantially, seeking a

target to possess. Making a possession attempt is a

supernatural ability that a fiend can attempt at will

as a standard action.

POSSESSED CREATURES

If a fiend wishes to possess a creature, the fiends

ethereal form must be adjacent to its desired

target. A protection from evil spell (or similar effect)

makes  a  creature  immune  to  possession  at-

tempts. An unprotected target of a possession

attempt must succeed at a Will saving throw

(DC 10 + 1/2 fiends HD + fiends Cha bonus) to

avoid possession. Evil targets of a possession

attempt take a 2 circumstance penalty on this

saving  throw,  and  target  of  a  possession

attempt who is in the middle of committing an

evil act takes a further 2 circumstance penalty.

Once a creature succeeds at a save against

possession, that fiend cannot attempt to pos-

23

AS

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:38 AM  Page 24

sess that creature again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the

victim is possessed.

A fiend in possession of a body becomes a part of the

victim, aware of what is going on around the creature that

they possess. It can see and hear as well as the victim can. A

possessing fiend can, at any time, speak mentally to the crea-

ture that it possesses in a language that the creature can

understand, although if the victim isnt very intelligent, its

understanding may be limited.

A creature possessed by a fiend doesnt always know that it

is possessed. Further, a fiend can attempt to hide its presence

within the possessed creature, allowing it to pass through a

magic circle against evil, enter a forbiddance-warded church, and

escape detection by detect evil. To do so, the fiend must make

a special mental Hide check. This is a Hide check using the

fiends Intelligence modifier rather than its Dexterity modi-

fier, but which otherwise uses the Hide skill. The Difficulty

Class (DC) for the Hide check is 10 + level of the spell + spell-

casters relevant ability modifier (just like the saving throw

for a spell). The fiend gains a +4 circumstance bonus on its

Hide check if it is not currently controlling the victim. The

fiend can also make this Hide check to prevent the possessed

creature from taking damage from alignment-based spells

such as holy smite. The DC for the Hide check is the same as

the saving throw DC for the damaging spell. If the fiends

Hide check fails, the spell affects the possessed creature as if

it had the same alignment as the fiend.

Possessing fiends have immediate access to all of their

victims current thoughts, as the detect thoughts spell,

except that they automatically read surface thoughts. If

desired, a possessing fiend can probe the possessed crea-

tures memories as well, but the victim is allowed a Will

save (DC 10 + 1/2 fiends HD + fiends Cha bonus). If the

save is successful, the victim keeps the fiend out of his or

her thoughts for 24 hours. Whether the save succeeds or

fails, probing memories automatically reveals the fiends

presence to the victim.

Physical harm to the possessed creature does not harm

the fiend. Killing the possessed victim only forces the fiend

back onto the Ethereal Plane, from where it can attempt a

new possession; the fiend is unharmed. Not even ethereal

creatures can harm a possessing fiend.

A fiend possessing a creature can take one of four roles

with respect to its victim: rider, ally, controller, or enemy.

The fiend can choose only one role at a time. If a fiend is

acting as a controller, it cant also grant its victim the

bonuses it could if the fiend were an ally, for example.

Rider: Much of the time, a fiend that possesses a creature

simply rides along with the victim, who is usually unaware

of the fiends presence. The fiend might combine riding

with hiding to get into an area protected by forbiddance or

slip past a magic circle against evil near a target that it could

not otherwise approach. As a free action, the possessing

fiend can become the ally or controller of the possessed

creature. Both of these actions, however, make the fiends

presence known to the victim (although victims with low

Intelligence scores may not understand what is happening

to them).

Ally: If the possessed creature is aware of the possessing

fiend and willing to be its host, the fiend can grant the pos-

sessed creature a +4 profane bonus to any single ability

score. This bonus is generally granted at the conclusion of

some bargaining between the fiend and the possessed crea-

ture. The fiend is in control of this bonus and can take it

away as a free action if the possessed creature behaves con-

trary to the fiends wishes. If the possessed creature doesnt

do what the fiend wants, the fiend can go from ally to con-

troller or from ally to enemy as a free action. Because the

possessor and the possessed can communicate telepathi-

cally, they often form an agreement: The bonus is a reward

for the possessed creature if it does as the fiend wishes.

Controller: In the most feared aspect of possession, a

fiend can take a standard action to attempt direct control

over the actions of the victim, who struggles to maintain

control over his or her own body. The victim must succeed

at a Will saving throw every round (DC 10 + 1/2 fiends HD

+ fiends Cha modifier, + 1 for each previous failed save

against control that day) to avoid losing control. If the

victims save succeeds, the victim has resisted the fiend, but

the fiend can make another control attempt in the next

round. Victims struggling against control are considered

staggered and can take only partial actions.

If the possessed creature makes three consecutive suc-

cessful saving throws, then the possessing fiend cannot

make further attempts to control the victim that day. The

success or failure of the victims saving throws against con-

trol does not affect the overall possession, however, and the

fiend is still possessing the creature.

If the possessed creature fails the Will save against con-

trol, the fiend has access to all of the creatures senses, abili-

ties, skills, feats, and spell knowledge. The fiend now acts as

though it is the creature in all respects, until control is lost

or it relinquishes control. During this time, the possessed

creature can still speak mentally to the fiend and is still

privy to all sensory inputunless the possessor takes a stan-

dard action to block the possessed creatures access to the

senses. If the fiend wishes, the victim blacks out while the

fiend is in charge.

The  fiend  uses  its  own  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  and

Charisma scores, but it adopts all of the creatures physical

ability scores. Fiends of at least 9 HD and 15 Intelligence

that maintain control of a victim for at least 10 rounds a day

for seven consecutive days can also draw upon the possessed

creatures spell-like abilities (at the same caster level as the

possessed creature). The fiend assumes the victims type and

is affected by spells and effects as if it were the possessed

creature. Thus, a cornugon-possessed wolf is subject to

spells affecting animals, even though it is far more intelli-

gent than a normal wolf.

The fiend automatically maintains control for a number

of rounds equal to 1/2 the fiends HD + the fiends Charisma

modifier + 1 for each time the fiend has controlled this spe-

cific victim. When the fiends control lapses, it can attempt

to reassert control if it chooses.

Fiends often choose weak-willed creatures to possess,

such as golems and other constructs. The construct can

make a Will save just as any other creature can to avoid the

possession, but it is likely that the possessing fiend can take

and retain control, because most constructs have poor Will

saves. A fiend possessing a construct can also aid it as

described under the ally role, but it must relinquish direct

control to do so, and the construct reverts to its prior pro-

gramming.

Enemy: The opposite of an ally, this possessing fiend is a

hindrance to a creature it possesses. A possessing fiend usu-

ally takes this tactic when it has failed to control its victim or

when it is angry with a possessed creature that the fiend was

acting as an ally toward. The possessing fiend can grant the

victim a 4 profane penalty to any single ability score. The

fiend is in control of this penalty and can take it away as a

free action, sometimes by working out an agreement with

the possessed creature after some telepathic negotiation.

POSSESSED OBJECTS

A fiend can possess an object of at least Tiny size and no

larger than Huge. An item held, worn, or carried by a char-

acter (including magic items) uses its owners saving throw

to resist possession. Unattended magic items gain a saving

throw as if a spell was being cast upon the item. In each case,

the Will save DC is 10 + 1/2 the fiends HD + the fiends

Charisma modifier. A fiend with the possession ability auto-

matically succeeds when attempting to possess an unat-

tended, nonmagical item.

A fiend possessing an object becomes a part of the object.

A possessing fiend can see and hear up to 60 feet away from

the object, but it cant use darkvision or blindsight while

possessing an object, even if it ordinarily has these abilities.

The possessing fiend remains vulnerable to spells that affect

outsiders, extraplanar creatures, or evil creatures (such as

holy word and holy smite) and mind-affecting spells and

effects. Physical attacks and most spells (such as fireball)

dont affect the fiend, but they might affect the object.

Harming the object does not harm the possessing fiend; if

the object is destroyed, the fiend takes ethereal form and

can choose a new host object (or creature).

A fiend can attempt to hide its presence within a pos-

sessed object, allowing it to pass through a magic circle, enter

a forbiddance-warded church, and escape detection via spells

such as detect evil. Use the same rules as when a fiend hides

in a creature. If the spell ordinarily detects or targets only

creatures, the fiend gains a +8 circumstance bonus on its

Hide check because it is within an object. The fiend can also

attempt this Hide check to avoid taking damage from align-

ment-based damaging spells, such as holy smite. If the fiend

fails its Hide check, the possessed object takes damage as if

it were the fiend.

A fiend can also possess a substance that has no fixed

shape (such as a pool of water or a dust cloud) or is part of a

larger object (such as a section of a wall). When it does so, a

fiend cannot possess an area or a volume larger than 10 feet

on a side.

Some fiends possess an item as a stepping stone for a pos-

session attempt on a character. The possessing fiend gets a

bonus on attempts to possess creatures that carry, hold, or

wear the item. For each day the possessed item was worn,

held, or carried by the target prior to the possession attempt,

the DC for the targets Will save increases by +1, up to a max-

imum of +10.

A fiend possessing an object can take any of the following

roles. Changing roles is a standard action.

Watcher: The fiend possesses an object, usually some-

thing big and stationary. It can see and hear at twice its

normal range (120 feet) as long as the object remains sta-

tionary.

Controller: If the possessed object has moving parts,

such as a wagon, clock, or crossbow, a possessing fiend can

control the movement. A wagon can be made to steer

toward a pedestrian on a street or roll out of a stable with no

horse pulling it. A clock can slow or run backward. A cross-

bow can cock and fire (but not aim or load itself ). Possessed

objects with wheels or legs cannot move faster than the

fiend itself could move in its corporeal form.

More powerful fiends can exert greater control. A fiend

with at least 10 HD and Charisma 17 can force an object to

animate even if the object doesnt have any moving parts

(such as a table or statue). The possessed object functions as

an animated object (see the Monster Manual). However, no

fiend can control an animated object with a higher Chal-

lenge Rating than the fiends.

Corruptor: The  possessed  item  radiates  a  cursed,

befouling presence. Anyone touching the possessed object

must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 fiends HD +

fiends Cha modifier) or fall under the effect of a bestow

curse spell with a caster level equal to the fiends Hit Dice.

Unlike the bestow curse spell, the subject does not necessar-

ily know that the curse is in effect or that it came from the

item. Nothing about the objects appearance suggests that

it is possessed (although there might be residual evil

effects, as described in the Lingering Evil section below).

The curse lasts until removed with break enchantment, lim-

ited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish, even if the fiend

vacates the possessed object.

A particularly crafty fiend might possess a small fountain

as a corruptor, affecting anyone who touches or drinks the

water. Similarly, a fiend could corrupt a patch of ground,

affecting anyone who walks over it.

Enhancer: A fiend can possess a Tiny or larger weapon or

armor and enhance it as if it were a magic item. The fiend

can duplicate magic item powers worth up to 2,000 gp per

Hit Die. For example, a hezrou (9 HD) that enhances a long-

sword could bestow up to 18,000 gp worth of powers on it. It

could duplicate the effect of a +3 longsword, a +1 unholy long-

sword, or another combination. A fiend that possesses magic

armor or a magic weapon can increase its power by the same

amount. Table 83: Armors and Table 810: Weapons in the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide give prices for various enhance-

ments.

The fiend is in control of the powers it bestows upon the

item. It can take them away as a free action at a moments

notice if the creature using the item does not act in a

manner that the fiend wishes. If the fiend leaves the items,

it loses all powers bestowed by the possession.

Despite the fiends duplication of magic item abilities, a

nonmagical possessed item doesnt become actually magical.

Detect magic will not sense an aura; detect evil will, however.

Smart characters might notice that the possessed item

behaves strangely or has an unusual appearance (a magic

weapon that isnt masterwork quality, for example, is a tipoff

that something is awry). A character who succeeds at a

Search  check  (DC  25)  notes  that  there  is  something

strange about the item.

SACRIFICE

Most evil gods and fiends demand sacrifice. When they say

sacrifice, they mean the sacrifice of a living, intelligent crea-

ture. Commonly, the victim is a humanoid, but dark powers

might demand the sacrifice of anything from a medusa to a

giant to a beholder. The main criteria are that the creature be

alive and have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher.

The sacrifice must be made in a ritualized manner. Its

fine for a blackguard to say that he is dedicating every foe he

slays to Vecna. But in truth, Vecna appreciates and rewards

his followers for victims killed in a ceremony and at a place

dedicated to him. This means that the ritual takes time, and

it probably involves extra participants and unholy trappings

(for examples of sacrificial gear, see the executioner tools

and other equipment in Chapter 3).

In a world suffused with magic, evil gods pay attention

when someone makes a living sacrifice to them, and they

often reward their followers for doing so. In some abstract

sense, the sacrifice adds some small mote to the gods over-

whelming power, and in return the evil deity is sometimes

willing to grant a boon or a blessing in return.

SACRIFICE REWARD SYSTEM

The reward a servant of an evil god gets for making a living

sacrifice to the god depends on many factors. The primary

factor is the Knowledge (religion) check result of the char-

acter performing the sacrifice. Each of the other factors is

represented as a modifier to the check.

Each evil deity has his or her own predilections and pref-

erences for sacrifices, and different deities give different

rewards to their followers. The following system of sacrifices

and rewards is just a starting point; give each evil power in

your campaign its own unique sacrifices and rewards.

pqs

WHAT IS A SACRIFICE?

Sacrifice is the offering of the life of a sentient being to an evil

deity or powerful fiend. The victim is trussed, tied, or otherwise

immobilized so that a ceremony may be conducted that culmi-

nates  with  the  murder.  In  many  rituals,  blood  is  a  sacred

symbol of life. When that blood spills during the ritual murder

of  an  innocent  creature,  the  blood  (and  sometimes  even  the

soul of the creature) is dedicated to a nether power of malev-

olence.  Bloodless  forms  of  killing,  such  as  strangulation  and

drowning,  are  possible  during  sacrifices,  but  usually  those

that  are despicable enough to practice this profane art prefer

bloodier deeds.

If a follower performs multiple sacrifices, the bonuses on

the followers Knowledge (religion) check do not stack for

every sacrifice; a separate check is made for each victim.

Most deities give only one reward per day per temple, no

matter how many victims are slain. The leader of the sacri-

fice, called the celebrant, can perform multiple sacrifices

and consequently make multiple Knowledge (religion)

checks, then use the best result to determine what reward

might be granted by the deity.

The actual reward earned by the performance of a living

sacrifice varies from religion to religion. See Table 22,

below, for some typical rewards that might be granted by an

evil deity and the DC of the Knowledge (religion) check to

qualify for each one. Many deities will have their own spe-

cific rewards to offer. The celebrant can choose what reward

is sought and prayed for, but the deity might grant another

reward, especially if the Knowledge (religion) check result

is significantly higher than the DC of the reward sought.

The celebrant cant take 10 or take 20 on this check, and no

one else can help with the check.

SACRIFICE AS A REQUIREMENT

Sometimes a special situation may arise in which rather than

granting  a  boon,  a  deity  demands  a  sacrifice  to  avoid  divine

punishment.  An  evil  god  might  demand  a  sacrifice  from  a

disobedient cleric (or one who has failed to perform a required

duty or quest) before granting him new spells. Periodic sacri-

fices  might  also  be  required  to  power  a  temples  defense

system,  such  as  an  antimagic  field,  prismatic  walls, a  unique

forbiddance or  unhallow effect,  or  something  similar.  Typically,

the Knowledge (religion) check DC for such required sacrifices

is 25, and no other reward is forthcoming for conducting the

evil ritual.

failed check indicates no dark craft experience points gained.

Varies Dark craft gold pieces equal to DC  5 (minimum DC 20).

The celebrant determines the number of dark craft gold

pieces (and thus the DC) sought prior to the check. A failed

check indicates no dark craft gold pieces gained.

Dark Craft Rewards: Experience points and gold pieces

can be granted as rewards after a sacrifice (see the last two

entries in Table 22, below). These so-called dark craft

rewards have no actual physical manifestation, but the cele-

brant senses their presence like a shadow on the soul. Dark

craft gold pieces and dark craft experience points cant be

used to buy goods or attain higher levels, but they can be

used instead of actual gold pieces or experience points when

making a magic item. Only a single application of dark craft

experience points and dark craft gold pieces can be applied

toward a magic items creation process. The time spent creat-

ing the item does not change when the celebrant uses dark

craft resources.

When the celebrant completes a magic item created by

the use of any dark craft resources (as little as 1 gp or 1 XP),

the item is tainted with evil. Others can sense this evil, as

described for an object of lasting evil (see Lingering Effects

of Evil, later in this chapter). Dark craft experience points

and  dark  craft  gold  pieces  can  be  combined  with  the

destruction of souls to make a magic item even easier to

build (see Souls as Power, later in this chapter).

CURSES

Curses are an important type of evil magic. Although good-

or neutral-aligned characters sometimes use curses to strike

at their enemies, curses are usually the domain of spiteful

and malicious creatures.

ALTERNATIVE CURSES

When a spellcaster uses bestow curse (see Chapter 11 of the

Players Handbook), the following curses can be substituted

for those given in the spell description.

Target is rendered sterile.

The next person introduced to the target for the first time

will hate him or her uncontrollably forever. Even if this

curse is removed, the person still hates the victim of the

curse, but the victim can improve the persons attitude

normally after the curse is gone.

Each time the target attempts to help a friend or ally, there

is a 50% chance the attempt fails and causes the ally to fail

at the task.

Target is struck blind and deaf.

Each round in combat, there is a 25% chance that the

target will attack the nearest creature rather than choos-

ing an opponent normally.

Every time the victim makes a d20 roll, a roll of 20 counts

as a 1.

The victim effectively ages, moving him or her to the

beginning of the next age category. See Chapter 6 of the

Players Handbook for the effects of aging.

At some point within the next week (or whenever it is fea-

sible), thieves are able to steal all monetary wealth the

victim has.

A random friend or family member of the target contracts

a disease. If the disease is magically cured or runs its

course (regardless of the outcome), another loved one

contracts a new disease.

The targets most powerful and/or cherished item falls

apart, becoming forever useless.

Valuable metals (such as platinum, gold, silver, and

copper) turn to lead in the targets possession, even if they

are in a bag of holding or stored away from the target. The

targets touch transmutes valuable metals (including

coins) into lead as well.

1d4+1 of the targets loved ones or allies are affected by a

curse chosen from the bestow curse list above.

All of the targets loved ones and allies suddenly despise

him and are considered to have unfriendly attitudes. See

NPC Attitudes in Chapter 5 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide for actions former allies might take.

The target cannot cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or

activate spell completion or spell trigger items.

THE DYING CURSE

When a particularly vile creature dies, she often speaks a

final curse upon those that wronged her (usually, the char-

acters who killed her). The effect of the dying curse depends

on the level or Hit Dice of the creature bestowing the curse.

DMs discretion

Not all evil creatures will deliver a dying curse, because a

creature that speaks a dying curse cannot be raised or resur-

rected thereafter. A true resurrection spell can bring the crea-

ture back, but the curse is immediately lifted if this happens.

The dying creature can target anyone with a dying curse;

the target need not be present when the curse is delivered.

Animals refuse to be within 5 feet of the target and do not

Removing a Dying Curse

respond to the targets commands or requests.

Each time the target meets someone for the first time,

there is a 50% chance that the new person will confuse the

target with a hated enemy, a well-known criminal, or a

raving lunatic.

All creatures of a specific kind (such as orcs, owlbears, or

black dragons) are permanently invisible to the sight of

the victim (invisibility purge does not help, but see invisibil-

ity and true seeing do). The spellcaster chooses the kind of

creature.

The following effects can be substituted for those given in

the bestow greater curse description (see Chapter 6).

Lifting a dying curse requires more than a simple remove

curse spell if the dying creature has more than 10 Hit Dice

or levels. A miracle or wish spell removes the curse, but each

dying curse also must have a single means of removing the

curse with some deed that the DM designates. The deed

must be something that the target can accomplish within

one year, assuming the task is undertaken immediately. For

example, the deed might be Slay the dragon under Castle

Bluecraft, or Climb the tallest mountain in the world.

The target of the dying curse can have help accomplish-

ing the deed. In fact, someone else can accomplish the deed

as long as removing the curse is the expressed purpose of

the deed. Thus, the kings champion can climb the tallest

mountain in the world to remove the curse on the king, for

example. But if someone who doesnt know about the curse

climbs the mountain, the curse remains.

Dying curses are generally the province of evil creatures,

but this isnt always the case. A good creature that was terri-

bly wronged and tricked into its death may also bestow a

dying curse, at the DMs discretion.

FAMILY CURSES

Sometimes curses are passed through the generations of a

single family like a hereditary disease. A family curse can pass

from a parent to all children, or the curse can simply pass to

the oldest child, the youngest child, the oldest child of a par-

ticular gender, a child with a particular trait, and so on.

A family curse can be the result of a particularly powerful

dying curse, a wish spell, the use of an artifact, or the inter-

vention of a god. It can take the form of a regular curse, or it

can seem to force a character toward a particular fate.

Because curses of the latter sort lie in the realm of destiny

and can be vague in their application, they are usually best

left in the hands of the DM, rather than obeying a simple set

of rules.

Family curses can be undone as described in Dying

Curses, above. Some fate-based family curses can be forever

broken if one member of the family can simply resist the

doomed destiny.

Some sample family curses are given below.

Each oldest son is doomed to murder his father.

The youngest daughter in each generation is doomed to

become an evil spellcaster.

The children of the family born with red hair are all terri-

bly unlucky (as described in the bestow curse spell).

One male child of each generation is doomed to be eaten

by a dragon.

items that bestow curses are often prized among fiends.

A curse that causes a debilitating disfigurement gives

misery not only to the target, but to the victims friends,

loved ones, and even strangers of a kind heart who merely

see him. Less kind passersby might mock or shun the target

of the curse. And so the fiends work progresses: The curse

punishes creatures with kind hearts and darkens the souls

of those without them.

Any kind of misery can grow from a curse. A demon

might curse a child so that it has a taste for blood, not only

for the evil the child might spread but also for the sadness

that takes root in those who become aware of such a child.

DISEASES

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide presents some dis-

eases that characters may encounter. Provided here are even

more diseases. While all diseases are terrible, these are par-

ticularly malign and vile, spawned from the corruption and

influence of evil outsiders, gods, or evil emotions.

Characters who come into contact with one of these dis-

eases (through proximity to someone who acts as a carrier,

injury by a contaminated attack, touching an item smeared

with diseased matter, or consuming tainted food or drink)

must make an immediate Fortitude saving throw. On a suc-

cess, the disease has no effect because the immune system

fought off the infection. Characters who fail the save take

the damage given on Table 24 after the diseases incubation

period. Once per day afterward, a diseased character must

succeed at a Fortitude saving throw to avoid repeated

damage. Two successful saving throws in a row indicate that

the character has fought off the disease and recovers, taking

no more damage.

The characteristics of diseases, as expressed on Table 24,

The sixth daughter of a sixth daughter will bring doom to

her entire land.

CURSES OF MISERY

Evil creatures that benefit from an overall increase in

misery, darkness, and evil sometimes spread curses just to

further that end. Fiends, especially devils, are often the

perpetrators of misery curses. Demons are more interested

in destruction than devils, many of whom take particular

pleasure in subtler forms of corruption. Thus, magic

always  a  risky  proposition:  The  cursed  victim  might  get  the

curse removed and seek revenge on the curse-giver.

Dying  curses  and  greater  curses  can  become  wonderful

springboards for D&D scenarios. If something cannot simply

be undone with a spell, the action or remedy required to lift the

curse is something that great adventures are made of.

It is often far more cruel to allow something to live in pain

and disfigurement than to kill it and end the creatures misery.

If a villain is particularly evil, such as a devil or a demon, great

delight comes from causing harm rather than causing death.

Assuming that your villain is confident or powerful enough to

risk a curse, its hard to resist the temptation of showing the

DISEASE DESCRIPTIONS

Acid Fever: When a character takes more than 30 points

of acid damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil

(such as the presence of an evil outsider or a desecrated

area), she risks contracting acid fever. Festering boils cover

the victims flesh, and the skin blackens and withers.

Blue Guts: This disease comes from eating the flesh of

particularly disgusting creatures such as otyughs, gibbering

mouthers, and gray oozes. It results in a bluish complexion,

particularly around the creatures intestines (hence the

name). Many (but not all) predatory magical beasts, aberra-

tions, and other creatures are immune to this disease, but no

humanoids are.

Deathsong: One of the worst diseases known, this terri-

ble plague has laid waste to entire communities in less than

a week. Victims of deathsong can do nothing but shriek and

howl as their bodies wither and blacken. Once the incuba-

tion period expires, the progress of the disease is so fast that

a victim can hear his skin crackle and his bones grow brittle

and break.

30

Faceless Hate: When a victim of this disease takes

enough Strength or Constitution damage to reduce the

ability score to 0, the infection disappears. The characters

ability scores are immediately restored to what they were

before the onset of the disease, but he becomes a monster

with no face. The character loses his ability to see (and

scent, if he has that ability), but gains blindsight with a

range of 60 feet. He loses the ability to speak, but gains the

Silent Spell feat if a spellcaster. The victims alignment

changes to neutral evil, and he becomes intent on killing

all those who were his friends and family. When the

victim has hunted down everyone dear to him, he turns

his ire against all other living things. These changes are

permanent, and remove disease has no effect. A wish or mir-

acle spell restores the character, but nothing else will. If

the victim dies and a remove disease spell is then cast on the

corpse, a resurrection or true resurrection spell restores the

character to life and to his original form. Raise dead wont

work.

Festering Anger: Brought upon by long-term, intense

fury and hatred, this disease manifests as dark boils across

the skin. The incubation periodin this case, the amount of

time during which a character must be angryvaries, but it

usually takes at least a year for festering anger to erupt. Each

day after the onset of this malady, the character takes 1d3

points of  Constitution damage, but she gains a cumulative

+2 enhancement bonus to Strength.

Each day, the victim must succeed at an additional Will

saving throw (DC 22) or attack whatever has made him so

angry. The victim is obsessed with taking action against the

focus of his anger, but isnt completely heedless of danger. If

the focus of the victims anger isnt readily available, the

victim will instead attack allies, minions, or symbols that

remind him of the reason for his hate. For example, a farmer

suffering from festering anger directed at the king wont

necessarily march toward the palace after failing a Will save.

He might instead attack the royal guards in the marketplace,

pick a fight with the local tax collector, or vandalize the

kings statue in the city square.

Fire Taint: When a character takes more than 30 points of

fire damage and is at the same time exposed to great evil (as

with acid fever, above), she risks contracting fire taint. Her

flesh reddens and her insides seem to burn. The victim

vomits bile during the worst of the disease.

Frigid Ravaging: When a character takes more than 30

points of cold damage and is at the same time exposed to

great evil (as with acid fever, above), she risks contracting

frigid ravaging.

Iron Corruption: This disease comes from prolonged

exposure to iron worked in conditions of extreme toil and

misery. Iron corruption often spreads from a stab wound or

an arrowhead lodged in ones flesh for too long. The victim is

gripped with terrible chills. Her skin turns a dull metallic

hue.

Life Blindness: The infected victim loses all ability to

perceive living creatures, even plants. All such beings are

treated as invisible, silent, and odorless. The loneliness and

alienation eventually drive the victim to be completely anti-

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:40 AM  Page 31

social, suffering effects similar to the emotion (despair) and

emotion (hate) spells.

Lightning Curse: When a character takes more than 30

points of electricity damage and is at the same time exposed

to great evil (as with acid fever, above), she risks contracting

lightning curse. As her blood vessels burst, the victim is cov-

ered in blue and black bruises. Her muscles ache and she

cannot think straight.

Melting Fury: Caught by characters who handle undead

flesh, this disease is as horrific to watch as it is to contract.

The victims flesh slowly liquefies and melts off his body

until he is dead.

Miserys Passage: Brought upon by long-term, intense

emotions of sadness and despair, this disease

manifests as dark boils. The incubation period

varies just as for festering anger. In addition

to the damage, the victim must succeed at an additional Will

saving throw (DC 15) every day or be treated as stunned for

that day. Even moving takes too great an effort.

Possession Infection: This malady occurs only after an

evil spirit, outsider, or other dominating force (including

the effect of dominate person cast by an evil caster) has pos-

sessed the victim. The victim slowly becomes despondent

and lethargic, apparently mentally affected by the alien pres-

ence that was within her soul.

Sound Sickness: When a character takes more than 30

points of sonic damage and is at the same time exposed to

great evil (as with acid fever, above), he risks contracting

sound sickness. Given to fits of shouting, the victim of this

disease shows no visible illness, but he staggers about, barely

able to keep to his feet.

Soul Rot: Creatures that eat the flesh of an evil outsider

can contract this horrible malady. Soul rot eats at the victims

mind and soul until she dies a horrible, agonizing death full

of pain and misery.

Vile Rigidity: This infection at first seems a boon. The

victims skin toughens, granting a +1 natural armor bonus to

AC 24 hours after the infection starts. On the second day,

this becomes a +2 bonus. On the third day, the natural armor

bonus improves to +3, but the victim takes a 2 penalty to

Dexterity. Each day thereafter, the victims skin becomes

thicker and thicker, adding a cumulative +1 natural armor

bonus and a 2 penalty to Dexterity. This lasts until the

victims Dexterity reaches 0, indicating that his ever-thick-

ening flesh has entrapped him. At this point, the victim dies

of suffocation.

Warp Touch: One of the worst effects of raw chaos and

dissolution, the malady known as warp touch has a random

set of effects that manifest immediately. Once it takes hold,

no more saving throws are needed: The malady gets neither

better nor worse. A remove disease accomplishes nothing.

When a character falls victim to this disease, roll on the pre-

vious table.

OTHER ASPECTS OF EVIL

The following elements of evil lore can be used as plot

hooks, new game mechanics to further depict evil, or some

of both.

THE CALLING

Once every few years, a creature of pure evila medusa,

troll, lamia, or similar beingfeels something loremasters

have named the Calling. When this occurs, the creature

leaves its lair, following a solitary magical compulsion. No

one knows exactly where the creature goes, but a good guess

is that it is taken away by a powerful fiend or some minor

evil god. It can be gone for as long as several months.

When a creature returns home after it has heard the Call-

ing, it has the ability to use spell completion magic items

even if it is not a spellcaster, and it is armed with some terri-

ble item of evil (a wand of unholy blight or a wand of darkbolt,

for example). The creature has had some spell cast upon it

that was then made permanent (demon wings and see invisi-

bility are common). The creature is proficient with light,

medium, and heavy  armor as well as martial weapons.

Creatures who return from the Calling often become

leaders of their kind, ready to combat the forces of good

with their new weapons and abilities. This lends further cre-

dence to the idea that some evil force is preparing them for

a larger conflict.

DARK CHANT

A few undead learn the secret of the dark chant from forbid-

den scrolls and forgotten books. The dark chant is not a

spell, but a number of particularly foul necromantic words

and phrases strung together into a litany of evil power. If at

least two undead creatures intone the dark chant together,

all undead within 100 feet (including the chanters) gain +1

turn resistance for every 2 HD possessed by the chanters on

average. For example, if a 7-HD vampire and an 11-HD lich

perform the dark chant together, the turn resistance bonus

is +4 (7 HD and 11 HD averages out to 9 HD, which yields 4

after its divided by 2 and rounded down).

Furthermore, if incorporeal undead perform the dark

chant together, the words and phrases take on extradimen-

sional energy, adding +1 turn resistance to the final result.

So if two 7-HD spectres intone the dark chant, the turn

resistance bonus is +4 (7  2 = 3; 3 + 1 = 4).

Undead with no Intelligence scores cannot use the dark

chant. Intoning the dark chant is a supernatural ability.

Some surmise that the dark chant has power because it is

actually uses some words from the Dark Speech (see below),

although the words and phrases may be bastardized, barely-

understood, and mispronounced.

DARK SPEECH

There exists a language so dire, so inherently full of spite,

malice, corruption, and hatred that it is simply called the

Dark Speech. This is the secret language of evil gods, so foul

and so potent that even demons and devils refrain from its

use, lest it consume them.

Not surprisingly, very few mortals know even a few words

of the Dark Speech. But those who do are wise to never

underestimate the power of words. The safest way to use the

Dark Speech is through spells such as dread word (see Chap-

ter 6). Most characters must take the Dark Speech feat to

begin to learn the Dark Speech language.

The Dark Speech is extremely difficult to master. A

special feat is required to speak even a single word of it

correctly, for mortal tongues were not designed to utter

these words of pure evil. Some evil outsiders know smat-

terings (or more) of the Dark Speech and need no feat to

master it.

To actually communicate by means of the Dark Speech

that is, for a knowledgeable speaker to convey some infor-

mation to a knowledgeable listenerthe speaker must take

great care, or both listener and speaker will be harmed.

There are no words in the Dark Speech for good concepts

such as kindness, mercy, and purity. However, evil charac-

ters can speak of misery, anguish, hate, and betrayal with an

accuracy impossible in any other tongue.

The Dark Speech has no written form. It cannot be

transliterated into another languages written form without

losing all of its meaning and power.

Besides communicating in the language of evil itself,

there are four ways that a speaker can use the Dark Speech.

Dread: The words spoken cause fear, loathing, and dread

in all who hear them. Speaking words of dread is draining to

the speaker, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage each

round the Dark Speech is spoken. When dread words of the

Dark Speech are uttered, all within 30 feet of the speaker

must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 speakers level

+ speakers Cha modifier). Listeners who know the Dark

Speech by possessing the Dark Speech feat gain a +4 cir-

cumstance bonus on this saving throw. If a listener fails its

saving throw, it suffers the following effects, depending on

its Hit Dice or level and alignment:

Levels 14, Nonevil: Characters are shaken by the intoned

Dark Speech, and they flee from the source of their fear as

quickly as they can, although they can choose the path of

their flight. Other than that stipulation, once out of sight

and hearing of the source of their fear, characters can act as

they want. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they

are still shaken for 1d10 rounds).

Levels 510, Nonevil: Characters are shaken, taking a

2 morale penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks

for 1d10 rounds.

Levels  11+,  Nonevil:  Characters  are  filled  with

loathing for the speaker and must attack him on their

next action.

Levels 14, Evil: Characters cower and are frozen in

fear. They lose their Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and

can take no actions for 1d10 rounds. Foes gain a +2

bonus to hit cowering characters.

Levels 510, Evil: Characters are mastered by the

Dark Speech, acting as if charmed (as described in the

charm person spell) for 1d10 minutes.

Levels 11+, Evil: Characters are impressed, reacting to

the speaker with more respect and wariness. This adds a +2

competence bonus on subsequent attempts to change their

attitude (see NPC Attitudes in Chapter 5 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide).

Power: The words of the Dark Speech help energize evil

magic items and spells. Again, this is draining to the

speaker, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time

the words of power are uttered. If used in conjunction with

an evil spell that has a verbal component, the Dark Speech

increases the spells effective caster level by +1. If used

when  creating  an  evil  magic  item,  the  Dark  Speech

increases the items caster level by +1 without increasing

the cost.

Both  caster  level  increases  are  considered  profane

bonuses. It is likely that the Dark Speech is a requirement

for many evil artifacts.

Corruption: The words of the Dark Speech, whispered

softly, can weaken physical objects. As a full-round action,

the speaker can whisper vile words of corruption and

destruction at an inanimate object such as a door or wall,

reducing its hardness by half. This minor use of the Dark

Speech is not draining to the speaker. It cannot be used

more than once on a single object.

Dark Unity: The words of the Dark Speech can create a

hivemind. Up to one hundred vermin or animals (none of

which can have more than 1 HD) form an evil hivemind, as

described in the Hivemind section below. The united con-

sciousness of the creatures will take one command from the

Dark Speech speaker, as if from the suggestion spell. Pulling

creatures under the sway of evil is draining to the speaker,

dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage each time words

of dark unity are uttered.

SOULS AS POWER

Souls are the incarnate manifestation of life energy. As such,

they contain a vast amount of power. Their power is so great,

in fact, that they serve as currency on the Lower Planes (see

Chapter 7). Night hags or fiends gather evil souls in the

form of larvae, then sell or trade them for goods, services, or

simply as tribute to more powerful entities. Huge infernal

machines and demonic devices are powered by souls in

those dark realms (see Diabolic Engines and Demonic

Devices in Chapter 6).

Souls can be used as spell components (see Chapter

3), and they can also replace experience point expendi-

tures when creating magic items. Each soul is the

equivalent of 10 experience points needed to create an

item. When the creator finishes making the magic

item, it is tainted with lasting evil as described in Lin-

gering Effects of Evil, later in this chapter. Magic item

creators can use souls in conjunction with dark craft

experience points and dark craft gold pieces.

To use a soul in any way, it must be properly pre-

pared and stored. The best way to do this is in a

proper receptacle, such as the gem involved in a soul

bind or trap the soul spell, or the storage object used

in an imprison soul spell. The dark altar stone magic

item is also useful in this regard. Subdued or cap-

tured larvae, or other extraplanar spirits of the dead (often

called petitioners), can serve as souls if properly prepared.

Even incorporeal undead can be used in this way if they can

be imprisoned somehow.

Using a soul in any way other than simply transferring it

as barter consumes it completely, destroying it forever.

Destroying a soul is an evil act of the blackest sort, even if

the soul was evil itself.

PAIN AS POWER

Some spells and magic items (such as the liquid pain spell

and the pain extractor wondrous item) allow pain to be stored

in special receptacles. The distilled pain, often called agony,

is a thick liquid.

Evil spellcasters can use liquid pain in magic item cre-

ation. Each dose is the equivalent of 3 experience points

needed to create the item. Liquid pain can be used in con-

junction with dark craft experience points and souls used

for experience points.

A dose of pain can also be used as a special evil spell com-

ponent (see Chapter 3). Some infernal magic items are pow-

ered by pain (see Diabolic Engines and Demonic Devices in

Chapter 6).

It takes a full day to distill a dose of liquid pain with the

liquid pain spell or a pain extractor. A victim cannot endure

or produce, to put it another waymore extractions of pain

than it has points of Constitution.

HIVEMIND

As a side effect of some evil spiritual presence or dark bless-

ing, vermin and certain animals can take on a sort of evil

consciousness shared among a large group, though each

individual member retains little or no intellect. When a

hivemind forms, each individual creature becomes just a

tiny part of a much larger, much greater intelligence. But

even the most craven sages do not understand how or why

hiveminds develop.

If at least 50 vermin or animals of the same species are

arranged so that no one individual is more than 10 feet

from another individual, the hivemind may come into

effect. All the creatures operate with an Intelligence of 5,

even if they previously had no Intelligence score (as with

vermin). The creatures Intelligence score increases by +1

for every additional 20 individuals (beyond the first 50) in

the hivemind, up to an Intelligence of 10 for a hivemind of

150 creatures. Beyond the 150-creature threshold, Intelli-

gence increases by +1 for every 50 additional individuals.

Thus, a swarm of 500 rats would have a hivemind Intelli-

gence of 17. For every point of Intelligence bonus pos-

sessed by the hivemind, award each individual creature one

feat and 1 skill point per Hit Die. Intelligence-based skill

bonuses increase accordingly. So the 500 rats in the swarm

(Int 17, +3 bonus) would each have 3 extra skill points and

three feats. In this case, they gain a +3 bonus on Hide

checks and the feats Alertness, Skill Focus (Move Silently),

and Weapon Focus (bite).

The increase to Intelligence gained for every creature in

the hivemind over 50 also applies to Charisma. So, a hive-

mind of 500 rats (normal Charisma score 2) has a Charisma

score of 14.

If the hivemind attains a Charisma score of 18 or higher,

it gains the ability to cast spells as a sorcerer. For every point

of Charisma over 17, the hivemind has one level of sorcerer.

A hivemind of 1,000 rats has a Charisma of 22, so it would

cast spells as a 5th-level sorcerer, for exam-

ple. The hivemind has six cantrips, eight

1st-level spells, and six 2nd-level spells

each day. Any single creature

can cast one of the hiveminds

spells, but those spell slots

are then lost to other crea-

tures in the hivemind.

Creatures in a hive-

mind have no need for somatic or material components, and

their squeaks, screeches, or clicks serve as verbal compo-

nents.

When creatures in a hivemind attack, they all gain a +1

insight bonus on their attack rolls and a +1 insight bonus to

their Armor Class. Each creature knows the actions of every

other member of the hivemind. The entire hivemind is

aware of what every individual is experiencing.

When running a hivemind encounter, play the hive-

mind as a single creature as much as possible. It can be

tedious  to  fight  numerous  creatures,  so  assume  that

weapon blows affect the hivemind as a whole. For example,

if a fighter hits a swarm of hivemind rats for 9 points of

damage, and each rat has 1 hp, assume that he killed nine

rats. If he was fighting a swarm of Small vipers with 4 hp

each, he killed two of them.

A hiveminds Challenge Rating is greater than the Chal-

lenge Rating of one of the individual creatures. If the CR of

an individual creature is less than 1/2, the CR of the hive-

mind is 1/2. If the creature has a CR of 1/2, the hiveminds

CR is 1. If the creature has a CR of 1 or higher, the hive-

minds CR is 1 greater than that of the creature.

VILE DAMAGE

Vile damage, like regular damage, results in the loss of hit

points or ability score points. Unlike regular damage, vile

damage can only be healed by magic cast within the area of

a consecrate or hallow spell. Vile damage represents such an

evil violation to a characters body or soul that only in a holy

place can healing magic repair the damage.

EVIL WEATHER

As a plague sent by an evil god or the byproduct of a greater

evil, various manifestations of evil weather can threaten the

well-being of vast areas and huge numbers of people. Like

mundane weather, evil weather is unpredictable, and it

rarely appears the same way twice.

Violet Rain: Always accompanied by a terrible thunder-

storm filled with lightning, violet rain brings portents of

great evil. Once violet rain begins to fall, all connection

with divine agencies is severed for 24 hours. Divine spell-

casters have no access to spells, divine spell effects are sup-

pressed, and divinely infused magic items cease to func-

tion. When violet rain comes, leaders of temples often hire

extra help to safeguard the temple while they are bereft of

magic. Because violet rain is so disruptive, religious leaders

sometimes use divinations and prophecies to gain as much

warning as they can.

A typical violet rainstorm covers 1d10200 square miles.

Green Fog: Clouds of dark greenish mist roll across the

countryside. The fog perverts any living thing it touches,

twisting and mutating flesh. Any creature touched by the

mist must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 17) or

become polymorphed into a random creature

(use the reincarnate spell to determine which

creature, or select a creature from a relevant

wilderness encounter list in Chapter 4 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide). The fog usually encompasses an area of

1d3 square miles, lasts for 10d6 minutes, and moves at a

speed of 30 feet.

Plague of Nettles: Tiny organic thorns fall from the sky.

Those caught in this brief rainfall take 1d2 points of damage

each round, unless they can get under some sort of shelter.

The nettles that strike soil burrow into the ground and

sprout thick, choking weeds that kill whole crops in a few

minutes. A plague of nettles is violent enough to tear up and

choke a forest in just a day. One week after the nettles fall,

the area is thick with animate, dangerous plants such as

assassin vines, tendriculoses, and shambling mounds. This

malevolent rainfall spreads across 3d6 square miles and lasts

for 3d6 rounds.

Rain of Blood: This horrible event can occur as part of a

regular thunderstorm or all on its own. Blood pours down in

thick drops for 2d10 minutes, coating everything in a dark

red, sticky mess. Any living, nonevil creature in the area of a

rain of blood must succeed at a Will save (DC 20) or take a

1 morale penalty on attack and damage rolls, checks, and

saves for 24 hours. Corporeal undead gain a +1 morale bonus

on attack and damage rolls, checks, and saves for 24 hours if

they are in the area of the rain. A rain of blood covers 5d6

square miles.

Rain of Frogs or Fish: This preternatural rain causes

1d3 points of damage per round to anyone not under shel-

ter. The thousands of animals that fall from the sky usually

die from the impact, but 1 in 20 lives to hop or flop about at

least briefly, adding a further alien strangeness to the event.

The rain lasts 2d6 rounds and covers an area of 2d6 square

miles.

LINGERING EFFECTS OF EVIL

Great acts of evil and towering amounts of sin take a huge

toll on the people involved, and the evil often lingers in

the location where it manifested. Worse, the echoes of

evil remain even when the evil itself is gone. Powerful

evil can change a creatures body and soul, and acts of foul

malevolence can mar a location or an important object

forever.

The lingering effects of evil are based loosely on the level

of evil involved. Creatures, locations, and objects can be

marked with one of four degrees of evil: a bad feeling, a last-

ing evil, a great and powerful malevolence, or darkness like

the world has never seen before.

A BAD FEELING

Even a short act of violence or a minor act of evil can have

lingering effects after the event has passed. This type of evil

can mentally scar a person who experiences or watches a

horrible event. It can leave a sinister mark in a location

where some act of evil once occurred. These events can also

cause undead to rise of their own volition: A ghost might

haunt the place of its murder, or a mohrg could linger in the

spot where it was wronged. Acts that can cause this degree

of lingering evil include the following.

A gruesome, bloodthirsty murder.

The proclamation of a foul edict, such as one that man-

dates the murder of infants to keep a new king from being

born.

A single sacrifice to an evil god or fiend.

The animation of dozens of undead creatures.

Abuse, starvation, and mistreatment of captives.

Casting a permanent or long-lasting spell with the evil

descriptor.

A bad feeling shows its effects in the following ways.

Creatures: People can have nightmares after exposure to

this degree of evil, but there are usually no lasting physical

effects. Certain types of undead can rise after even a single

act of wrongdoing. The spectre of a murder victim might

linger where he was slain, for example.

Locations: Being the site of a grisly murder or sacrifice

gives an area a feeling of slight wrongness. Sometimes,

undead or evil outsiders in such a place gain the effect of a

bless spell.

Objects: This degree of evil usually has no effect on

objects.

Detect Evil: Usually, detect evil does not register an aura of

evil associated with creatures, locations, or objects exposed

to this degree of evil, but people can sometimes sense a cold

chill in tainted locations.

A LASTING EVIL

Evil events so great that they last for a long time are few and

far between. This degree of evil requires true malice and

intentionally committed foul deeds. Some events of lasting

evil include the following.

Building an evil temple.

Multiple sacrifices to an evil god or fiend.

Summoning multiple fiends.

Committing a mass murder or storing the grisly trophies

of such a crime.

Multiple possessions of innocents.

The long-term presence of a lich, nightshade, or other

powerful undead.

The long-term presence of an evil outsider on the Mater-

ial Plane.

A lasting evil shows its effects in the following ways.

Creatures: People exposed to this degree of evil may

have nightmares, neuroses, or more serious psychological

disorders.

Locations: The site of a horrible evil event almost always

has lasting effects. These effects might include the following.

An unnatural chill throughout the area.

The absence of plant life.

The place is full of unnerving sounds: moans, whispers,

and the occasional disembodied scream.

A cold wind blows all the time.

Objects: An object exposed to this degree of evil might

display one or more of the following changes.

Object becomes darker or paler in color.

Object becomes warped in shape.

Object becomes possessed by outsiders.

Detect Evil: Detect evil registers a faint evil aura surrounding

a  location  or  object  involved  in  the  event.  Creatures

involved do not gain an evil aura, but they may have had one

already.

A GREAT AND POWERFUL MALEVOLENCE

Only a few events involving this degree of evil exist in an

entire world, unless your campaign world is a particularly

evil place. These are events of true and terrible evil, which

include the following.

Building a portal to the Lower Planes.

Bringing powerful fiends to an evil temple on the Mater-

S

E

L

U

ial Plane.

Committing daily multiple sacrifices over hundreds of

years at an evil temple or altar.

The presence of an evil god walking the Material Plane.

A great and powerful malevolence shows its effects in the

following ways.

Creatures: Besides suffering

psychological trauma, creatures

exposed to this degree of evil

can be changed physically. Depend-

ing on the circumstances, a creature

may gain the fiendish or half-fiend

template. Other physical

changes dont involve

templates, but are

still dramatic.

They include

the following.

Creatures hair turns white.

Creatures flesh turns pale.

Creatures flesh becomes unnaturally cold.

Creatures eyes turn black or red.

Creature takes on a foul odor.

Neutral creatures become evil.

Creatures are possessed.

Locations: An evil event of this magnitude always leaves

a mark on the landscape, which might manifest in one or

more of the following ways.

Evil weather develops.

Natural healing becomes impossible in the area.

Good-aligned area spells such as hallow, consecrate, and

magic circle against evil are impossible to cast in the location.

Objects: An object exposed to such evil might experience

the following changes.

Object takes on a faint greenish glow.

Object has a foul odor.

Object has strange images burned into or somehow

appearing on its surface: leering demons, ghostly faces, or

other symbols of evil.

Objects structure weakens, with hardness and hit points

Object carries an infection (choose a disease at random).

Detect Evil: Detect evil always indicates an evil aura sur-

rounding a location where an event of this degree of evil

occurred or an object was exposed to it. Creatures involved

might have a slight evil aura clinging to them for 1d1010

hours afterward.

DARKNESS LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER

SEEN BEFORE

Generally unique in all the world, such an event scars the

nature of reality. Such a scar will probably never heal. The

worst of all fell events might include the following.

An act of genocide.

The birth of an evil god.

The murder of a god, demigod, or legendary hero of light.

Darkness like the world has never seen before shows its

effects in the following ways.

Creatures: Severe psychological trauma and physical

changes are likely in the wake of such powerful evil. Pos-

sible changes include the following.

Creature has a faint greenish glow.

Creature is sickened.

Creature takes a 2 inherent penalty to one ability score.

Creatures touch causes minor pain, dealing 1 point of

damage.

Animals avoid the presence of the creature if possible.

Creature gains Evil Brand as a bonus feat, whether desired

or not.

Creature is horribly mutated physically, gaining Willing

Deformity as a bonus feat.

Creatures blood becomes acidic; it is immune to damage

from its own blood.

Creatures body breaks out in boils that ooze poison.

Creature gains the corrupted template (see Chapter 8).

Locations: The site of an evil this horrific is forever

marred. Such a vortex of evil might demonstrate some of the

following properties.

An unhallow spell spreads throughout the area. Dis-

pelling the unhallow effect only suppresses it for 1d4

rounds.

A befoul or despoil spell spreads throughout the area.

The landscape changes significantly, often forming a

huge rift or crater or draining a large body of water.

Weather patterns change forever; overcast skies, cold

winds, and rain dominate.

Objects: An object exposed to such evil may have one of

the following taints.

Touching the object causes pain, dealing 1 point of

damage.

Object becomes an evil artifact.

Detect Evil: Detect evil always indicates a strong evil aura

surrounding a place where a dread event happened or an

object was exposed to it. Creatures involved have a slight

evil aura clinging to them for 1d1010 days afterward.

he equipment described in this chapter. is usually

found in the possession of evil characters. The Dun-

geon Master may want to limit how much of it, if any, is

available on the open market. Items purchased on the

black market may have inflated prices, twice or even

three times the prices given here. Those inflated black

market prices reflect the scarcity of the items; this equip-

ment is too evil to be found in common markets.

TORTURE DEVICES

All manner of devices exist for inflicting pain. Each of the

torture devices described in this section provides a circum-

stance bonus that is added to the Intimidate check made by

a torturer against a victimthe more effective the device,

the greater the modifier.

A torturer seeks to learn something from the victim

through the application of pain, though sometimes tortur-

ers inflict pain for pains own sake. The sick thrill felt by a

torturer as she clips the end off one of her victims fingers,

and the visceral charge the torturer feels as she pushes a

red-hot brand all the way through her clients cheek, are

intangible drugs favored by the depraved.

RULES OF TORTURE

The torturers victim must first be secured, either by

being tied in place, pinned in a grapple, or successfully

restrained in a stationary torture device. A victim in

such a device can attempt to make an Escape Artist

check every round against the DC associated with

the device (see Table 31: Torture Devices, on the

following page). A pinned creature can attempt to

break a grapple. However, the torturer is generally

watching while the victim is being restrained in a

stationary torture device or being grappled by a

third party. If the victim attempts an Escape Artist

check or a grapple check in the knowing presence

of the torturer, whether or not the check suc-

ceeds the torturer can hit the creature with a

coup de grace.

Once the victim is secure, the torturer can

attempt one use of a torture device against a

secured victim (such as thumbscrews on a maid

tied to a chair) in a certain time frame (once per

round unless otherwise noted). Each device has

an  associated  circumstance  bonus  that  is

applied to the torturers Intimidate check when

the torturer attempts to pry desired informa-

tion from the victim. The Intimidate check DC

is 10 + the victims level or HD.

Of course, a victim can choose to reveal the

information before torture is applied. Merely

threatening to use a torture device against a

victim can be effective: If the torturer suc-

ceeds on a Bluff check opposed by the victims Sense Motive

check, the torturer can use half of the devices circumstance

bonus on her subsequent Intimidate check.

When using a torture device, a torturer can attempt mul-

tiple Intimidate checks to attempt to gain the same infor-

mation, unlike the standard use of the Intimidate skill. A

successful Intimidate check indicates the victim yields up

the requisite information.

A victim can attempt to mislead a torturer, pretending

to give up the real information in hopes the torturer will

end the pain. The victims Bluff check is opposed by the

torturers Sense Motive check if the victim lies or mis-

leads the torturer during the interrogation. Because the

torturer is convinced of her methodsthat pain reveals

truth, and that torture cant be withstoodthe torturer is

more likely to believe even the most outlandish lie. The

torturer takes a 3 circumstance penalty on Sense Motive

checks to see through the bluffs of those she tortures.

Even victims who dont really know the information

sought by the torturer can be compelled to lie to make the

hurt go away.

The tendency of victims to say anything to stop the pain

makes torture impractical in some cases. But even when a

torturer feels as if shes extracted the truth, she may con-

tinue the torture anyway.

If a victim is brought to 0 hit points or lower through the

use of torture equipment, then later healed, the subse-

quent use of a torture device against that victim doubles

the devices circumstance bonus on the torturers Intimi-

date checks. This doubling only occurs in the second and

subsequent torture sessions.

Torture Devices as Weapons: Nonstationary items such as

pokers and scalpels make poor melee weapons. In melee,

torture devices deal half the damage given in Table 31, if

the device can be used in melee at all. For example, a

Medium-size torturer couldnt pick up and use an iron

maiden as a weapon.

Masterwork Devices: Masterwork torture devices can be

made, but do not provide higher circumstance bonuses. They

simply exhibit finer craftsmanship and cost twice as much.

DEVICE DESCRIPTIONS

Additional sinister devices and other forms of torture exist

beyond those presented here. Use the devices described

below as a guide to determine the game effects of other

forms of torture.

Branding Iron/Poker: Heated in hot coals, this iron rod

is used to create painful but nonfatal burns. The burn deals

1d3 points of damage and allows one Intimidate check.

Dagger: Any weapon could be used as a device of torture,

though traditional weapons do their jobs too wellthe risk

of killing the victim too quickly becomes a concern. If a

dagger is used as a torture device, each use deals 2d4 points

of damage and allows one Intimidate check.

Hot Lead: The torturer melts lead, then pours it on the

victims skin. Often the palm, the arm, or the belly is the

target, but sometimes torturers drip lead on the eyelids or

other delicate tissues. Each use deals 1d3 points of damage

and allows one Intimidate check.

Iron Maiden: This coffin-shaped iron box is laden with

spikes on the interior surfaces. Anyone placed inside is

pierced dozens of times, and any movement causes more

pain. The iron maiden has several settings that determine

how tightly the two sides come together when the device is

closed. At the low setting, anyone inside takes 1 point of

damage per round. The moderate setting deals 5 points of

damage, the severe setting deals 10 points of damage, and

the terminal setting deals 50 points of damage each round.

Once the iron maiden is closed to any setting, the torturer

can make an Intimidate check every round.

Jaw Breaker: This wood and metal device is like a reverse

thumbscrew. The torturer inserts the jaw breaker into the

victims mouth, then turns a small wheel. As the wheel

turns, two opposing plates force the victims mouth wider

and wider, breaking teeth and eventually the jawbone. The

jaw breaker can also be used on the victim in other places.

Each use deals 2d4 points of damage and allows one Intimi-

date check. The jaw breaker must generally be removed for

the victim to speak coherently.

Needle: Large needles or nails can be inserted into the

flesh of the victim in places that maximize pain and mini-

mize real damage. Each needle deals 1 point of damage. Usu-

ally, three or four of these are used on a victim per Intimi-

date check.

Pillory: This wooden device, consisting of a frame with

holes for the victims head and hands, is not a torture device

in and of itself. A pillory is designed to confine and restrain

a victim. When the pillory is located in a public place, the

the torturer, her minions, and even passing strangers can

taunt, assault, and further humiliate the victim. Those who

linger near the pillory commit acts ranging from simple

degradation of the victim to outright physical harm. Each 8

hours of confinement typically deals 1d6 points of damage

and allows one Intimidate check.

Rack: A long, table-shaped device, the rack is equipped

with chains and winches hooked up to manacles. As a crank

is turned, the rack stretches the victims arms and legs. Each

30 minutes spent on the rack deals 1 point of damage and

allows one Intimidate check.

Scalpel/Flenser: A finely crafted knife with a short,

sharp blade, the scalpel is used by surgeons to cut away dis-

eased flesh. When used by a torturer, the scalpel pares

lengths of skin away, then removes a digit or an earlobe.

Each use of a scalpel deals 1d6 points of damage and allows

one Intimidate check. Flensers are similar knives used to

remove the skin from a body.

Thumb Screws: This small wood and metal device slowly

crushes the thumb or finger of a victim. It causes a lot of

pain, but deals only 1d2 points of damage per use. Each time

the thumbscrews tighten, the torturer can make another

Intimidate check.

Tied Down: Anything used to tie down a victim is not a

torture device. But if the victim sees many ancillary and/or

stationary torture devices nearby (as in a typical torture

chamber), the torturer can make an immediate Intimidate

check using half of the circumstance bonus for the item in

question.

EXECUTION EQUIPMENT

Execution of prisoners, far from light and hope of rescue, is

something all creatures fear when venturing into realms

where vengeance or brute malice holds sway. Despicable

overlords and despotic states alike enjoy particularly cruel

forms of execution, deriding even the idea of lesser penal-

ties. And even an otherwise enlightened society may find

that vengeance is more important to it than reformation of

the convicted. And so the executioners profession never

lacks for work.

The executioner seeks death for the condemned with a

swift stroke. Sometimes, death by torture is the command

given to the executioner, but in such a case he will often

remand the client to a torturer to carry out the sentence.

However, many execution devices are also extraordinarily

painful for those destined to feel their cruel, final embrace.

RULES OF EXECUTION

The condemned must first be secured by being tied in place,

pinned in a grapple, or successfully restrained in a station-

ary execution device. If restrained in an execution device,

the condemned can attempt to make a Escape Artist check

every round against the DC noted in Table 32, unless mag-

ically held or otherwise helpless. If grappled, the con-

demned can attempt to break the grapple normally.

Once the victim is secure, the executioner can attempt

the chosen method of execution. The executioner makes a

Profession (executioner) check against the DC given for the

device on Table 32. If the check is successful, the con-

demned is slain according to the nature of the device. If the

executioner fails, the execution is botched, and the execu-

tioner  can  make  another  check  the  following  round.

Botched attempts deal the damage noted for the device, so

the condemned may be killed even if the executioner

botches  the  attempt.  Prideful  executionerswhich

includes most of themtake it as a personal point of dis-

honor if they kill the condemned on a botched execution.

Execution Devices as Weapons: Some execution devices, such

as headsmans axes, make adequate melee weapons. In

melee, such an item deals normal damage for an item of its

kind (such as a greataxe) and cannot kill instantly. Most

other devices of execution cannot be used in melee.

Masterwork Devices: Masterwork execution devices pro-

vide a +1 circumstance bonus on the executioners Profes-

sion (executioner) check. They cost twice as much as the

versions given in Table 32.

EXECUTION DEVICES

Hundreds, if not thousands, of execution methods are pos-

sible beyond those described here. Table 32 identifies

common techniques from which more exotic forms of exe-

cution can be extrapolated.

Crucified characters lose 10% of their total hit points each hour.

*The Use Rope check of the executioner sets the Difficulty Class.

Crucifixion Cross: This device consists of two lengths

of wood or other strong material, plus several nails. The exe-

cutioner affixes the condemned to the structure by driving

nails through the wrists and the arch of each foot. When

affixed, the condemned is considered crucified. On a suc-

cessful Profession (executioner) check, excruciating pain

slowly kills the condemned over the next several hours: She

loses a number of hit points equal to 10% of her full normal

total hit points each hour. If the executioner botches the

crucifixion, the condemned is not securely fashioned to the

cross and gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks. She

still loses 10% of her total hit points each hour she remains

on the cross.

Draw and Quarter: First, the executioner forcefully

affixes a specially prepared cord to some vital internal

organs of the client, usually the intestines; this procedure

deals 3d4 points of damage. Once the cord is affixed, the exe-

cutioner either draws the cord himself, or attaches the other

end to a horse that subsequently gallops away. The cord

draws taut, pulling the intestines from the torso of the con-

demned. On a successful Profession (executioner) check,

the condemned dies instantly. On a botched attempt, the

cord comes loose prior to disembowelment, but the con-

demned still takes 5d6 points of additional damage.

Hanging Rope: A rope used for this purpose has usually

been boiled and stretched beforehand to eliminate further

stretching and coiling. The knot is lubricated with wax to

ensure a smooth slide as it tightens around the neck of the

condemned. The noose is placed so that the knot is behind

the left ear of the condemned; then a trapdoor opens below

or a stool is knocked away and the condemned plummets.

On a successful Profession (executioner) check, the con-

demned dies instantly. If the execution is botched, the con-

demned is not killed by the fall but instead slowly strangles,

taking 1d3 points of damage per round.

Headsmans Axe: When specially sharpened and held

with the proper technique, a greataxe (or a greatsword) can

serve the executioner as the instrument of execution. The

condemned is restrained, with the neck vulnerable to the

strike readied by the executioner. On a successful Profes-

sion (executioner) check, the condemned dies instantly. If

the executioner fails the attempt, the headsmans axe deliv-

ers a coup de grace against the condemned (automatic criti-

cal hit, and the condemned must succeed on a Fortitude

save or die). The coup de grace simply completes the execu-

tioners task more messily.

ARMOR/EQUIPMENT TRAPS

Vindictive or paranoid creatures sometimes trap their

equipment so that a trap activates if someone else attempts

to use their gear. Perhaps the most common trap of this type

is a contact poison spread across the surface of the itema

poison to which the owner is immune.

Even more devious are tiny, spring-loaded needles and

pop-up clamps, again coated with poison. Such a trap deals

1 point of damage and delivers whatever poison the owner

wishes to use. These traps usually have a Search DC of 30

but a Disable Device DC of only 20: they are made to be dif-

ficult to find but simple enough to deactivate or remove.

Larger items may have many such traps. A blackguard, for

example, might have eight or ten traps on his plate armor.

More complicated still are traps that render equipment

useless to unauthorized users. An armor trap could cause the

armors joints to seize. A weapons blade might come loose in

the middle of combat, and a rope can be rigged so that

unless special precautions are taken, it breaks when used.

EXAMPLE TRAPS

aSpring Needle Trap in Sword Hilt: Unless the user

activates  a  special  latch,  a  needle  pricks  anyone  who

attempts to use this longsword. Trapmakers can build a trap

of this type trap into any weapon, tool, or similar object. CR

2; 1 point of damage plus Medium-size scorpion poison; Fort

save (DC 15); Search (DC 30); Disable Device (DC 20).

Market Price: 225 gp, including one dose of poison.

aPlate Armor Locking Trap: If the user doesnt undo par-

ticular latches and detach some inconspicuous wires, this

suit of armor becomes very difficult to move in; the various

pieces lock together at one or more of the joints. This trap

works with plate armor, half-plate, banded mail, or scale

mail. CR 1; no damage, wearer takes 12 armor check

penalty on appropriate checks; Search (DC 30); Disable

Device (DC 20). Market Price: 100 gp.

aDetaching Axe Blade: Unless two special latches are

secured, the head of this battleaxe flies off during the first

attack made with it. This trap could be placed on virtually

any weapon. CR 1; no damage, weapon unusable; Search

(DC 30); Disable Device (DC 20). Market Price: 40 gp.

aPoison Gas Spray in Coin Purse: If opened without

turning a knob hidden in the latch, poison gas sprays out in

a cloud around the purse, affecting only the opener. A simi-

lar trap would work with any sort of bag or pouch, or even

within armor or a weapon hilt. CR 3; ishentav poison; Fort

save (DC 15); Search (DC 30); Disable Device (DC 20).

Market Price: 625 gp, including one dose of poison.

aAlchemists Fire Spray in Breastplate: Unless the user

dons this breastplate very carefully, a special glass container

shatters, spraying alchemists fire on the character. Once the

wearer straps on the armor, however, a pressure-sensitive

lever secures the glass vial in a padded sheath that renders

the vial unbreakable, until the armor is taken off. Plate

armor and half-plate could accept a similar mechanism. CR

1; 2d6 points of damage; Reflex save (DC 20) half; Search

(DC 30); Disable Device (DC 20). Market Price: 110 gp.

aFire Trap on Potion Vial: Opening the vials stopper

sprays fire at its possessor unless specifically attuned to it

(see the fire trap spell in the Players Handbook) when the stop-

per was made. Neither the vial nor the potion takes damage

from the fire. Similar traps could be placed on any gear that

opens and closes. CR 2; 5-ft.-radius burst of fire (1d4+3

points of damage); Reflex save (DC 13) half; Search (DC 27);

Disable Device (DC 27). Market Price: 60 gp.

aGlyph of Warding on Backpack: Unless the user speaks

the proper phrase before opening this backpack, the pack

explodes with a burst of acid, dealing damage to the unau-

thorized opener and probably destroying the contents of the

pack. Almost any piece of equipment could have a similar

trap. CR 2; 5-ft.-radius burst of acid (2d8 points of damage);

Reflex save (DC 15) half; Search (DC 28); Disable Device

(DC 28). Market Price: 150 gp.

ALCHEMICAL AND

QUASI-MAGICAL ITEMS

Some items have the taint of evil magic about them, though

they arent magic items in the strict sense of the word. And

in sinister laboratories, evil necromancers work on other

surprises for those who would defend good and light.

Feather  Powder: Originally  designed  as  a  weapon

against devas and lammasus, this dark red alchemical

powder comes in a small glass vial thrown as a grenadelike

weapon. Anyone struck or splashed by the powder must

succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15) or take a 1 cir-

cumstance penalty on attack and damage rolls, saving

throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 minute due to

irritation and itching. Creatures with feathers are particu-

larly susceptible, taking a 2 circumstance penalty on the

Fortitude save against feather powder and suffering double

the effect (2 penalty) if they fail the save.

Festering Bomb: This small ceramic sphere is packed

with alchemical explosives, rotting meat, and offal infected

with filth fever. When thrown as a grenadelike weapon, it

spreads disease in its wake. The explosion on impact is not

enough to cause physical harm, but it does spray the rotten

contents and infection in a 20-foot burst. All within the

burst must make saving throws as if exposed to filth fever

(Fort DC 12; see the Disease section in Chapter 3 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide). Unlike normal exposure to filth fever,

the victim need not be injured.

Karras Stone Knife: A quasi-magical item, this simple

knife must be carved from a very rare stone procured from

the gallbladder of an intelligent creature slain during a spe-

cial harvesting ritual. Karras stone is made only into knives

because it has only one special useotherwise, it is normal

stone. When a karras stone knife is used to sacrifice a living

creature, the character using the knife gains a +1 profane

bonus on the Knowledge (religion) check for the sacrifice

(see Sacrifices in Chapter 2).

Violated Horn: Also a quasi-magical item, the violated

horn is a unicorns horn that has been removed from a still-

living unicorn, leaving the creature crippled and in con-

stant, terrible pain. For a violated horn to have special

power, it must physically violate a victim during a perverse

religious ritual conducted atop an altar dedicated to an evil

god. The character performing the ritual must succeed at a

Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 20) to perform the ritual

properly, and no second tries are possible with that particu-

lar horn if the first check fails. Once a violated horn is pow-

ered, its possessor can break the horn at any time thereafter

and be immediately transported to the site of the ritual as if

a word of recall spell had been cast.

Weeping Stone: Created through alchemical processes

that inflict terribleand sometimes lethalpain on a

living being, a weeping stone causes anyone touching it to

his or her face to begin to weep and feel great sorrow. Such a

character is considered shaken for 1d6 rounds.

DRUGS

Drugs function like poisons, allowing the imbiber an initial

and a secondary saving throws to resist their effects. Delay

poison, neutralize poison, and similar effects negate or end a

drugs effects, but they do not restore hit points, ability

scores, or other damage caused by the substance.

A creature that willingly takes a drug automatically fails

both saving throws. It is not possible to intentionally fail the

initial save but attempt to save against the secondary

damage, or vice versa. DCs are provided for situations in

which a character is drugged against his will.

Drugs in Your Campaign: Depending on your cam-

paign, drugs may be difficult or easy to obtainthe deci-

sion is a matter of taste. However, whether drugs are illegal

(as might be the case in a restrictive but good-aligned civi-

lization) or commonplace, pushers will exist.

Pushers are those who directly or indirectly want to see a

drug dispersed into a population. Usually profit motivates

them. A pushers typical tactic is to offer the drug at only

1/10 of its normal price (or even free) to potential new cus-

tomers, in hopes of addicting the customer to the drug.

Once the customer seeks out the pusher for the drug (usu-

ally, once he or she is addicted), then the pusher charges full

price for the drug, or even a premium.

Adding drugs into your campaign is probably most easily

accomplished through a nonplayer character (NPC) pusher.

Player characters (PCs) can expect to run into pushers illic-

itly in a civilization where drugs are outlawed, or in bazaars

in a society where drugs are common. In a society where

magic potions are commonplace, drugs might be legal, too.

Drug addiction functions much like diseases as described

in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. Upon initial exposure (any-

time a character imbibes or applies a drug with an addiction

rating), the character must succeed at a Fortitude save or

become addicted, as shown below. Addiction proceeds like a

diseasewhile addicted, the character takes ability score

damage each day unless he succeeds at a Fortitude save

against the given DC.

Addiction Rating: Drugs are rated according to their addic-

tive potential. For example, many popular stimulant drinks

have a negligible addiction rating, but have addictive quali-

ties all the same. Sometimes, an individuals long-term

addiction increases a drugs addiction rating for that indi-

vidual. Drugs with a negligible rating are not subject to this

change. Stronger drugs increase their rating by one step for

every two full months a character remains addicted to the

drug. A character who recovers from an addiction and later

becomes addicted again does so at the addiction rating the

drug had just prior to his recovery.

Satiation: Each time a user takes a drug to which he is

addicted, he is satiated and staves off withdrawal symptoms

for the given period of time. After the satiation period wears

off, the DC of the Fortitude save to resist the effects of addic-

tion increases by +5. The dose in which a character becomes

addicted counts for satiation. For example, a character unfor-

tunate enough to become addicted to devilweed (low addic-

tion) on his first use of the drug must succeed at a Fortitude

save every day or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage. As long

as he continues to smoke devilweed every 10 days, his saving

throw DC is only 6. If he stops smoking devilweed for more

than 10 days, the DC of the addiction saving throw increases

to 11. If he starts using it again, the DC drops back to 6.

Damage: Addiction deals the listed damage each day

unless the character succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw

or is satiated. Ability score damage is temporary, and char-

acters naturally heal 1 point in each ability score per day.

Recovery: If a character makes two successful saving

throws in a row, he has fought off his addiction and recovers,

taking no more damage. Of course, he can always become

addicted again later by taking another dose of the drug and

failing his Fortitude save to resist addiction.

A lesser restoration or restoration spell may negate some or

all of the ability score damage caused by an addiction, but on

the next day the victim may accrue more ability score

damage if he continues to fail his Fortitude saves. Remove dis-

ease immediately causes the user to recover from the addic-

tion, but it does not restore lost ability score points. Greater

restoration or heal causes recovery and restores all ability

score damage from the addiction.

DRUG CHARACTERISTICS

Some characteristics of drugs are summarized on Table 35:

Drugs.

Other characteristics are spelled out in a text entry for

each drug. After a general description of the drug, the fol-

lowing characteristics are provided.

Initial Effect: The effect of the drug if the initial saving

throw is failed. If multiple effects are given, the result of one

saving throw indicates whether all or none of these effects

occur.

Secondary Effect: The effect of the drug if the secondary

saving throw is failed. If multiple effects are given, the result

of one saving throw indicates whether all or none of these

effects occur.

Side Effects: Side effects, if any. These occur immedi-

ately upon taking the drug.

Overdose: What constitutes an overdose and the effects

of the same.

Agony (Liquid Pain): This thick, reddish liquid is the dis-

tilled essence of pain, captured using special spells or items

(see the Pain as Power section of Chapter 2). It is highly

sought after by outsiders.

Initial Effect: User is stunned for 1d4+1 rounds and can

take only partial actions for 1d6 minutes after that.

Secondary Effect: 1d4+1 enhancement bonus to Charisma

for 1d10+50 minutes.

Side Effects: Feelings of intense pleasure last for 1d4 hours.

Overdose: If more than one dose is taken in a 24-hour

period, the user immediately falls unconscious for 1d4

hours (Fort DC 18 negates).

Baccaran: This pasty substance is dried and kept as a

powder or sometimes left as a paste. The ingredients are

numerous and difficult to obtain.

Initial Effect: 1d4 points of Strength damage.

Secondary Effect: 1d4+1 enhancement bonus to Wisdom for

1d10+15 minutes.

Side Effects: Those under the effect of baccaran take a 4

circumstance penalty on saving throws involving illusions

for 2d4 hours after using this mild hallucinogen.

Overdose: If more than one dose is taken in a 24-hour

period, the user immediately takes 2d6 points of damage

and the side effect is doubled.

Devilweed: Leaves from the wyssin plant are dried and

rolled into a tobaccolike substance and smoked.

Initial Effect: 1 point of Wisdom damage.

Secondary Effect: The smoker gains a +2 alchemical bonus

to Strength for 1d3 hours.

Side Effects: A creature under the effect of devilweed is

easily confused and acts skittish (treat as shaken).

Overdose: None.

Luhix: Powdered stalks of plants that grow only in the

Abyss, luhix is normally sprinkled onto a bleeding, self-

inflicted wound. Then the wound is sealed either with mag-

ical healing or tightly wound bandages.

Initial Effect: 1 point of ability score damage to all ability

scores.

Secondary Effect: The imbiber gains a +2 alchemical bonus

to all ability scores for 1d2 hours.

Side Effects: For the first minute of application, the user

feels intense pain. During the time that the secondary effect

is in effect, the user is immune to pain (including the effects

of spells such as symbol of pain). The character takes damage

as normal, but may not react normally to that damage.

Overdose: Those who take this drug more than once in 24

hours must make a separate save (Fort DC 25 negates) or die

in terrible pain.

Mordayn Vapor (Dreammist): Made of roughly ground

leaves of a rare herb found in deep forests, mordayn is so

potent that it is taken by steeping a small amount in hot water,

and then inhaling the vapors of the resultant tea. Raw mor-

dayn powder and mordayn-tainted water are deadly poison;

taking the powder directly or drinking the water produces an

immediate overdose. Dreammist is renowned for the beautiful

visions it induces and the deadly peril of its sinister embrace.

Initial Effect: Exotic visions of incredible beauty enthrall

the user for the next d20+10 minutes. During this time the

user has a 50% chance to lose any action he attempts, as

described in the bestow curse spell.

Secondary Effect: 1d4 points of Constitution damage and

1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Side Effects: The visions of a dreammist user are incredibly

beautiful and poignant. His normal life seems drab and

futile in comparison, and he aches to experience the tran-

scendent beauty of his drug-induced dreams again. When

the dose wears off, the user must succeed at a Will save (DC

17) or fall under a compulsion to do whatever is necessary to

repeat the dreammist dose (treat this as a compulsion simi-

lar to that of a suggestion spell). This compulsion lasts for 1d4

hours before fading.

Overdose: If two doses are taken within the space of an

hour,  or  if  raw  mordayn  powder  or  mordayn  tea  are

ingested, the drug is a deadly poison (ingested DC 17, 1d10

Con/1d10 Con). Mordayn vapor addicts often throw out the

tea as soon as they inhale and make sure that only one dose

is available at a time in order to make sure they cannot over-

dose on the deadly drug.

Mushroom Powder: Taken from a rare blue mushroom,

this powder must be inhaled. It is popular among arcane

spellcasters.

Initial Effect: +2 alchemical bonus to Intelligence and

Charisma for 1 hour.

Secondary Effect: 1 point of Strength damage.

Side Effects: This is a mild hallucinogen. The user takes a 2

alchemical penalty to Wisdom for 1d4 hours and a 2

alchemical penalty to Strength and Constitution for 2d4

hours.

Overdose: If more than one dose is taken in a 12-hour

period, the user takes 2d6 points of damage. Using it more

than three times in any 24-hour period deals 4d6 points of

damage and paralyzes the user for 2d4 hours.

Redflower Leaves: These crushed leaves of a tiny red bog

flower are known for their ability to improve hand-to-eye

coordination.

Secondary Effect: As a move-equivalent action, the user may

focus his attention upon a particular creature. If he follows

that action with an attack against the creature, he gains a +4

competence bonus on the attack roll. This ability lasts 10

minutes.

Side Effects: None.

Overdose: Taking a second dose before the first has worn

off causes the user to be nauseated for 1d4  10 minutes.

Sannish: A bluish liquid distilled from wolves milk and

a powdered desert plant, this concoction is very popular.

Addicts are easily found by the permanent blue stains on

their lips.

Initial Effect: 1 point of Wisdom damage.

Secondary Effect: The user becomes numbed to pain for 1d4

hours, immune to pain-induced penalties (such as from a

symbol of pain).

Side Effects: Sannish causes euphoria. While the drug is

in effect, the user takes a 2 penalty on all initiative

checks.

Overdose: A second dose taken while the first dose is still

in effect causes a numbing stupor for 2d4 hours. The user

grows only on the graves of those who dedicated their lives

to the worship of Rallaster.

Initial Effect: +2 alchemical bonus on Intimidate checks

and saving throws against fear effects for 1d4 hours.

Secondary Effect: 4 alchemical penalty on Diplomacy and

Bluff checks for 2d4 hours.

Side Effects: Mild euphoria and fierce confidence while the

drug is in effect.

Overdose: If more than one dose is taken in a 4-hour

period, the user becomes catatonic (Fort DC 15 negates).

POISON

When a character takes damage from a poisoned weapon,

touches an item smeared with contact poison, or consumes

poisoned food or drink, he must make a Fortitude saving

throw. A character who fails the saving throw takes the

poisons initial damage, which is usually ability score

damage. Even a character who succeeds at the initial saving

throw faces secondary damage 1 minute later, which can be

avoided by making a separate Fortitude save.

CREATING POISONS

The first rule for refining natural poisons, such as an

animals venom, into a generally useful poison is that simply

killing the creature and wiping your characters blade on its

poison gland doesnt work. Most creatures poisons are a del-

icate mixture of various toxins, and that delicate mix is often

disrupted when the creature dies or the poison is exposed to

the air. Getting the poison to persist on a blade and remain

effective is a trickier task still.

Refining raw materials, such as creature venom, into an

effective poison requires time, determination, and an appli-

cation of craft. Craft (poisonmaking), a subcategory of the

Craft skill, provides the necessary expertise. Table 36 pro-

vides Craft (poisonmaking) DCs for usable poisons made

from centipede, scorpion, and spider venom.

Making poisons with the Craft (poisonmaking) skill fol-

lows the rules in Chapter 4 of the Player s Handbook for

making items with the Craft skill, with the following two

exceptions.

Cost: The cost of raw materials for a poison varies widely

depending on whether the character has access to the active

ingredientthat is, the venom or plant that actually pro-

vides the poison. If a supply is readily available, the raw

materials cost 1/6 of the market price, not 1/3. Otherwise,

the raw materials cost at least 3/4 of the market price

assuming that the substance in question is for sale at all.

Time: To figure out how much poison can be made in a

week, the character makes a Craft (poisonmaking) check at

the end of the week. If the check is successful, multiply the

check result by the DC for the check. That result is how

many gold pieces worth of poison are created that week.

When the total gold pieces worth created equals or exceeds

the market price of one dose of the poison, that poison-

maker has completed that dose. For a skilled poisonmaker,

multiple doses in a week may be possible. If the poison-

maker fails the check, no progress is made that week. If the

poisonmaker fails the check by 5 or more, the raw materials

are ruined and must be reobtained.

Using the Alchemy Skill: Characters with the Alchemy

skill can substitute it for Craft (poisonmaking), but doing so

imposes a 4 circumstance penalty on checks related to poi-

sonmaking.

Harvesting Venom: Because of the refinement process,

raw venom from creatures doesnt command anywhere near

the price of a dose of real poison. There is no open market

for poison raw materials, because the use of poison is often

illegal, or at least rarely admitted to. Characters who hunt

creatures for their venom will have a difficult time finding

buyers for corpses of poisonous creatures. If they can find a

buyer, characters will typically get 1/6 of the cost of one

dose of the refined version of the poison.

NEW POISONS

The poisons on Table 36 augment those described in Chap-

ter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. Some are obviously

derived from poisonous monsters in the Monster Manual,

while others are the creation of evil poisonmakers.

PSYCHIC POISONS

Psychic poisons are a particular sort of intentional curse

bestowed upon a creature, object, or area, almost always the

result of the psychic poison spell. Psychic poisons are used as

traps in the same way that a contact poison might be used on

a chest full of valuables. A psychic poison is a magical toxin

that affects those who cast certain types of spells on the crea-

ture, object, or area.

If a spellcaster casts a mind-affecting or divination spell at

an object or area affected by psychic poison, or at a creature

within a poisoned area, the caster must make an immediate

Will saving throw (DC determined by the psychic poison

spell). Casters who fail their saves are affected by the psychic

poison, taking the initial damage given on Table 37.

Whether the saving throw was successful or not, the caster

must succeed at another saving throw 1 minute later to

avoid secondary damage (much like a mundane poison).

Each psychic poison has a minimum level associated with

it. A caster or item creator must be at least that level to uti-

lize that particular psychic poison when making an item or

casting the psychic poison spell.

Certain special components are required for the casting of

evil spells (see Chapter 6). If a particular component is not

mentioned on Table 38, its price is negligible and the com-

ponent is a part of the casters component pouch.

For an extra 10 gp, any material component can be magi-

cally preserved, retarding normal decay and decomposition

for 24 hours.

OPTIONAL COMPONENTS

Some evil spell components are optional (and not men-

tioned along with the other components in the spells

descriptive text). These components sometimes increase the

potency  of  an  evil  spell;  the  component  is  consumed

whether it helps or not. A spellcaster can use only one

optional component in the casting of an evil spell, so using

two humanoid hearts, or a humanoid heart and a brain,

wont improve the spellcasters chances.

As with any spell component, the caster must be touching

an optional evil spell component and have it displayed

prominently for it to function. These optional components

can only be applied to spells with the evil descriptor.

Descriptions of the optional components on Table 38 are

provided below.

Agony (Liquid Pain): Pain in distilled liquid form (see

Pain as Power in Chapter 2), as extracted by certain spells or

items, automatically increases the effective caster level of a

single spell by +2. This increase doesnt stack with previous

applications of liquid pain or any other such bonuses to

effective caster level.

Chromatic Dragon Heart: If a spell this component is

applied to deals damage, there is a 30% chance that the spell

deals an additional +2d6 points of damage to a good-aligned

target. The heart must be from a dragon of at least 15 HD,

and it must be dried and hardened into a gemlike object.

Demons Heart: A spell that this component is applied to

has  a  25%  chance  to  have  any  damage  the  spell  deals

increased by +10%. The heart must be from a demon of at

least 6 HD, and it must be dried and hardened into a rock-

like object.

Devils Heart: A spell that this component is applied to

has a 10% chance to remain prepared even after being cast.

Casters who do not prepare spells gain no advantage from

this component. The heart must be from a devil of at least 6

HD, and it must be dried and hardened into a rocklike

object.

Humanoid Heart: A spell that this component is applied

to  has  a  25%  chance  to  have  its  effective  caster  level

increased by +2. The heart must be intact and well preserved

(still bloody).

Humanoid Brain: A spell that this component is applied

to has a 50% chance to have its range doubled. The brain

must be intact and fresh (or preserved).

Humanoid Childs Eye: A spell that this component is

applied to has a 20% chance to have its duration doubled.

The eye must be intact and fresh or (or preserved).

Humanoid Finger: If a spell that this component is

applied to requires a touch attack (melee or ranged), there is

a 40% chance to receive a +1 profane bonus on the attack

roll. The finger must be intact and well preserved (still

bloody).

Metallic Dragon Heart: A spell that this component is

applied to has a 30% chance to have its saving throw DC

increased by +1. The heart must be from a dragon of at least

15 HD, and it must be dried and hardened into a gemlike

object.

Soul in Larval Form: A spell that this component is

applied to has its saving throw DC increased by +2. Souls in

larval form are usually found naturally only on one of the

Lower Planes (see Chapter 7).

Soul in Receptacle: A spell that this component is

applied to gains a +10 profane bonus on caster level checks

to overcome spell resistance. Souls in receptacles normally

result from the use of spells such as soul bind and trap the soul.

Yugoloths Brain: A spell that this component is applied

to has a 10% chance to allow no saving throw against its

effect. There is also a 10% chance that the spell affects the

caster as well as the target or area, with no saving throw

allowed.  Make  the  two  checks  independently  of  one

another. The brain must be from a yugoloth (or some other

neutral evil fiend) of at least 10 HD, and it must be dried and

powdered.

his book introduces a new type of feat: the vile feat.

Only intelligent characters of an evil alignment can

use vile feats. Vile feats are granted to characters at the

behest of a powerful evil agencya god, a demon, or

something similar. As such, vile feats are supernatural

abilities rather than extraordinary abilities. Some DMs

may also want to require a character who seeks a vile feat

to perform a special ritual or make an actual bargain with

a powerful creature of evil. The patron creature may even

(at the DMs discretion) have the ability to revoke the feat

should the character displease it.

BOOST SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

One of the creatures spell-like abilities is harder to resist

than it otherwise would be.

Benefit: The saving throw Difficulty Class (DC) of a boosted

spell-like ability is increased by +2. Each of a creatures spell-like

abilities can be boosted three times per day, though the feat

does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for

any ability. Thus, if a succubus chooses to boost its suggestion

ability, it can use a boosted suggestion up to three times that day.

Thereafter, it could use its suggestion ability again normally

(since it can use suggestion at will), or it could boost another of its

spell-like abilities, such as charm monster.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each

time it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-

like abilities three additional times per day.

BOOST SPELL RESISTANCE [GENERAL]

By making a deal with an evil power, the character

makes himself even more resistant to magic.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.

Benefit: If the character already has innate spell

resistance, he gains a +2 profane bonus to his exist-

ing spell resistance score.

CORRUPT SPELL [METAMAGIC]

The character can transform one of her spells

into a thing of evil due to a deal she makes with

an evil power.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.

Benefit: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a

spell. Furthermore, if the spell deals damage,

half of the damage is unholy damage. For exam-

ple, a corrupted fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard

deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of fire

damage and 3d6 points of unholy damage.

Thus, creatures immune to fire still potentially

take 3d6 points of damage. The corrupted spell

uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

Special: A character may take this feat multiple

times, choosing a different spell each time.

CORRUPT SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

One of the creatures spell-like abilities is powered by evil. A

dark pact provides the creature with unholy energy.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.

Benefit: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell-like abil-

ity. Furthermore, if the spell-like ability deals damage, half of

that damage (rounded down) is unholy damage. For example,

if a corrupted fireball from a pit fiend deals a total of 35 points

of damage, half of that amount (18 points) is fire damage and

the other half (17 points) is unholy damage. Nonevil creatures

immune to fire still take the 17 points of unholy damage.

Each of a creatures spell-like abilities can be corrupted

three times per day, though the feat does not allow the crea-

ture to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if

a pit fiend chooses to corrupt its fireball ability, it can use a

corrupted fireball up to three times that day. Thereafter, it

could use its fireball ability again normally (since it can use

fireball at will), or it could corrupt another of its spell-like

abilities, such as meteor swarm.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like

abilities three additional times per day.

Benefit: The character can use the Dark Speech to bring

loathing and fear to others, to help cast evil spells and create

evil magic items, and to weaken physical objects (see Dark

Speech in Chapter 2).

Normal: Attempting to utter a word of the Dark Speech

always ends in immediate death for a speaker who is not

trained in its dark power. Fortunately, it is impossible to

make someone use the Dark Speech if he or she is unwill-

ing, because the languages pronunciation is so exacting.

Special: The character gains a +4 circumstance bonus on

saving throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech

against him or her.

DEFORMITY (CLAWED HANDS) [VILE]

Because of intentional self-mutilation, the character has

deformed arms and hands ending in sharp claws.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: The character has the ability to deal 1d6 points of

damage as an unarmed claw attack. The character is consid-

ered armed even when unarmed.

Special: The character does not draw attacks of opportu-

nity when attacking unarmed, and he threatens areas even

when unarmed.

DEFORMITY (EYES) [VILE]

The character has either drilled a hole in her forehead trying

to add a third eye, or she has supernaturally scarred one of

her regular eyes.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: As a supernatural ability, the character can use

see invisibility for 1 minute per day.

Special: The character takes a 2 deformity penalty on

Spot and Search checks.

DEFORMITY (FACE) [VILE]

Because of intentional self-mutilation, the character has a

hideous face.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: The character gains a +2 circumstance bonus on

Intimidate checks and a +2 deformity bonus on Diplomacy

checks dealing with evil creatures of a different type.

DEFORMITY (GAUNT) [VILE]

Through intentional starvation and macabre operations, the

character is grossly underweight. He has a skeletal appearance,

and his weight is now half normal for creatures of his kind.

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: The character gains a +2 deformity bonus to

Dexterity and a 2 deformity penalty to Constitution. Fur-

thermore, he gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape

Artist checks and Intimidate checks.

Special: A character with this feat may not take the

Deformity (obese) feat.

DARK SPEECH [VILE]

DEFORMITY (OBESE) [VILE]

The character learns a smattering of the language of truly

dark power.

Prerequisite: Base Will save bonus +5, Int 15, Cha 15.

Through intentional gorging and general gluttony, the char-

acter is obese. Grossly overweight, she is now at least triple

the normal weight for creatures of her kind.

48

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:47 AM  Page 49

Prerequisite: Willing Deformity.

Benefit: The character gains a +2 deformity bonus to

Constitution and a 2 deformity penalty to Dexterity. Fur-

thermore, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate

checks and saving throws against poison.

Special: A character with this feat may not take the

Deformity (gaunt) feat.

DISCIPLE OF DARKNESS [VILE]

The character formally supplicates himself to an archdevil.

In return for this obedience, he gains a small measure of

power.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an evil act, the

character may call upon his diabolic patron to add a +1 luck

bonus on any one die roll.

Special: Once a character takes this feat, he may not take

it again; he may not be the disciple of more than one devil.

Nor may he take the Thrall to Demon feat.

EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

The creature can use a spell-like ability with greater effect.

Benefit: All variable, numeric effects of an empowered

spell-like ability are increased by one-half. An empowered

spell-like ability deals half again as much damage as normal,

cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as

many targets, and so on as appropriate. For example, a night

hags empowered magic missile deals one and one-half times

normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply the result by 1.5 for

each missile). Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as the

one made when a character casts dispel magic) are not

affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are

not affected.

Each of a creatures spell-like abilities can be empowered

twice per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to

exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a night

hag chooses to empower its magic missile ability, it can use an

empowered magic missile up to two times that day. There-

after, it could use its magic missile ability again normally

(since it can use magic missile at will), or it could corrupt

another of its spell-like abilities, such as sleep.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like

abilities two additional times per day.

EVIL BRAND [VILE]

The character is physically marked forever as a servant of an

evil power greater than herself or as a villain who does not

care who knows that she seeks only death, destruction, and

misery for others. The symbol is unquestionable in its per-

versity, depicting a depravity so unthinkable that all who see

it know beyond a doubt that the bearer is forever in the sway

of the blackest powers.

Benefit: Evil creatures automatically recognize the

symbol now emblazoned upon the character as a sign of her

utter  depravity  or  discipleship  to  a  powerful  patron,

although the specific identity of the patron is not revealed.

She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and

Intimidate checks made against evil creatures.

LICHLOVED [VILE]

By repeatedly committing perverted sex acts with the

undead, the character gains dread powers.

Prerequisite: Evil Brand.

Benefit: Mindless undead see the character as an undead

creature. Becoming more and more like an actual undead

creature, he gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws

against mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and disease.

MALIGN SPELL FOCUS [GENERAL]

The characters spells that have the evil descriptor are more

potent than normal due to a deal she makes with an evil power.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against

any of the characters spells that have the evil descriptor.

MORTALBANE [GENERAL]

The creature can make a spell-like ability particularly deadly

to mortals.

Benefit: A mortalbane ability is a damaging spell-like abil-

ity that deals 2d6 points of additional damage when used

against living nonoutsiders, but only half damage (rounded

down) against outsiders, undead, and constructs. For example,

if a mortalbane cone of cold from a gelugon would normally deal

45 points of damage, it actually deals 45 + 2d6 points of damage

to a humanoid, but only 22 points of damage to a night hag.

Creatures immune to coldregardless of their typestill

take no damage from a mortalbane cone of cold.

Mortalbane can be applied to each of a creatures spell-like

abilities five times per day, though the feat does not allow

the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability.

Thus, if a gelugon chooses to apply Mortalbane to its cone of

cold ability, it can use a mortalbane cone of cold up to five

times that day. Thereafter, it could use its cone of cold ability

again normally (since it can use cone of cold at will).

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like

abilities five additional times per day.

POISON IMMUNITY [GENERAL]

After prolonged exposure to a poison or toxin, the character

has rendered himself immune to it.

Benefit: The character is immune to one specific poison

(chosen by the DM or the characters player), whether avail-

able as a blade poison, the venom of a specific creature, or

one other toxin. The character also gains a +1 circumstance

bonus on saving throws against other poisons.

Special: A character may take this feat multiple times,

choosing a different poison each time. The +1 bonus against

other poisons doesnt stack with itself, because the circum-

stances of each poison immunity are essentially the same.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

The creature can use a spell-like ability with a moments thought.

Benefit: Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free

action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The

creature can perform another actionincluding the use of

another spell-like abilityin the same round that it uses a

quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one

quickened spell-like ability per round. A spell-like ability

that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full

round cannot be quickened.

Each of a creatures spell-like abilities can be quickened

only once per day, and the feat does not allow the creature to

exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a

demon chooses to quicken its darkness ability, it cannot use

quickened darkness again the same day, though it could use

its darkness ability again normally (since it can use darkness at

will), or it could quicken another of its spell-like abilities,

such as desecrate.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a

standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity

unless noted otherwise.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like

abilities one additional time per day.

SACRIFICIAL MASTERY [VILE]

The character is skilled at offering living sacrifices to evil

gods or fiends.

Prerequisite: Wis 15.

Benefit: The character gains a +4 profane bonus on

Knowledge (religion) checks made when performing a sac-

rifice.

Normal: Without this feat, a character who performs a

sacrifice makes a normal Knowledge (religion) check modi-

fied as described in Chapter 2.

THRALL TO DEMON [VILE]

The character formally supplicates himself to a demon

prince. In return for his obedience, the character gains a

small measure of power.

Benefit: Once per day, while performing an evil act, the

character may call upon his demonic patron to add a +1 luck

bonus on any one roll.

Special: Once a character takes this feat, he may not take

it again; he may not be the thrall of more than one demon.

Nor may he take the Disciple of Darkness feat.

VERMINFRIEND [VILE]

Vermin regard the character better than they would

normally.

Prerequisite: Cha 15.

Benefit: If a vermin is about to attack the character, she

may make a Charisma check (DC 20). If the check succeeds,

that vermin refuses to attack her for 24 hours.

VILE KI STRIKE [VILE]

The character can focus evil power into his unarmed strike.

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Improved Unarmed Strike.

Benefit: Each time the character deals damage with his

unarmed strike, he deals 1 additional point of vile damage.

VILE MARTIAL STRIKE [VILE]

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Weapon Focus with the specified

weapon.

Benefit: Each time the character deals damage with a spe-

cific kind of weapon, she deals 1 additional point of vile damage.

Special: A character may take this feat more than once,

selecting a different weapon each time.

VILE NATURAL ATTACK [VILE]

The character can focus evil power into his natural attacks.

Prerequisite: Natural attack that deals at least 1d8 points

of damage, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit: Each time the character deals damage with his

natural attack, he deals 1 additional point of vile damage.

VIOLATE SPELL [METAMAGIC]

The character can transform one of his spells into an evil

spell, and the wounds the spell inflicts are tainted with the

foulest evil.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment.

Benefit: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell. Fur-

thermore, if the spell deals damage, half of the damage dealt

is vile damage. For example, a violated lightning bolt cast by

an 8th-level wizard deals 8d6 points of damage: 4d6 points of

electricity damage and 4d6 points of vile electricity damage

(but creatures immune to electricity take no damage). A vio-

lated spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

Special: A character may take this feat multiple times,

choosing a different spell each time.

VIOLATE SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

The creatures spell-like abilities are particularly tainted with

evil.

Benefit: This feat adds the evil descriptor to a spell-like

ability. Furthermore, if the spell-like ability deals damage,

half of that damage (rounded down) is vile damage. For

example, if a violated lightning bolt from a cornugon deals a

total of 35 points of damage, half of that amount (18 points)

is electricity damage and the other half (17 points) is vile

damage. Creatures immune to electricity take no damage

from a violated lightning bolt.

Each of a creatures spell-like abilities can be violated twice

per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed

its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a cornugon

chooses to violate its lightning bolt ability, it can use a violated

lightning bolt up to two times that day. Thereafter, it could use

its lightning bolt ability again normally once (since it can use

lightning bolt three times per day), or it could violate another of

its spell-like abilities, such as fireball.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like

abilities two additional times per day.

WILLING DEFORMITY [VILE]

Through scarification, self-mutilation, and supplication to

dark powers, the character intentionally mars her own body.

Benefit: The character gains a +2 deformity bonus on

50

The character can focus evil power into her weapon blows.

Intimidate checks.

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:48 AM  Page 51

hough theyre called prestige classes, many of the

classes that follow appeal to characters who seek raw

power, not prestige. If youre a thrall of Juiblex, for exam-

ple, youre probably not basking in the accolades of soci-

etyyoure performing dark rituals in the sewers under

the palace. In most places, demon and devil cults are repug-

nant to most people if not forbidden outright by law.

Accordingly, the thralls and disciples described here do

much of their work incognito. Theyll often adopt the trap-

pings of another class to hide their true nature. A thrall of

Orcus might wear a holy symbol from another god, while a

disciple of Mephistopheles might carry a staff and adopt a

pet rat he calls my familiar.

In evil societies, things are turned on their head. If the

devotees of a demon prince or archdevil have a position of

power and influence in a particular place, then the various

thralls and disciples in this chapter are free to act openly.

Evil societies are sought-after havens for evil characters,

because they dont have to put up with the rigmarole of pre-

tending to be who theyre not. If the cult of Asmodeus

rules a city, disciples of Asmodeus are the citys day-to-day

rulers, or at the very least they have great influence over

those who rule the city.

High-level thralls and disciples fill an important niche

in campaigns that feature one or more demon princes and

archdevils  as  villains:  a  middle  ground  between

minion and mastermind. Low-level characters will

battle rank-and-file cultists and other pawns in the

archfiends plans. High-level characters might sur-

vive a battle with an archfiend itself. At middle

levels, the characters can contend with mid- to high-

level thralls and disciples, who are capable and well

connected enough to act as lieutenants for the arch-

fiends they serve.

Other prestige classes in this chapter arent tied

to demon princes and archdevils. Demonologists

and diabolists study and bargain (with demons

and devils respectively) more generally, rather

than binding themselves to a particular patron

demon prince or archdevil. Cancer mages use

filth, disease, and decay as sources of power, and

vermin lords curry favor with insects and other

pests. Lifedrinkers are vampires adept at turn-

ing stolen blood to dark purposes, while soul

eaters do the same with stolen life energy.

Mortal hunters are demons that wear the skin

of their victims. Warriors of darkness use black

magic  to  improve  their  combat  prowess.

Finally, ur-priests siphon spells from the gods

themselves.

CANCER MAGE

Scurrying about in sewers, back alleys, and abandoned

buildings, the cancer mage feeds upon the corpse of society.

The cancer mage hides in the darkness where no one wants

to look, digging through trash long forgotten. Cancer mages

are some of the most disgusting individuals a character is

ever likely to meet, for they revel in filth, disease, and decay.

They usually have their own foul goals, sometimes venerat-

ing deities of disease or corruption and other times spread-

ing disease for its own sake.

Cancer mages use their power to equip themselves with a

deadly array of weapons, but these are not the weapons of a

warrior. The cancer mage strikes from darkness. He makes

quick, poisonous attacks and then retreats, allowing his con-

taminated wounds to fester and hopefully kill his victims

slowly.

Rogues, rangers, druids, and clerics are most likely to

become cancer mages. Rats, insects, worms, and diseases are

the cancer mages allies. Cancer mages sometimes work in

horrible, hidden societies of the disease-ridden underclass,

such as beggars and thieves. Sometimes they enjoy the com-

pany of assassins or vermin lords. They hate good-aligned

clerics and paladinsparticularly paladinswith a burn-

ing passion. Occasionally, an intelligent monster such as a

troglodyte or a medusa will become a cancer mage, but these

creatures are ostracized even by their own kind. One might

imagine, however, that an otyugh or vermin such as giant

maggots and cockroaches would not mind the company of a

cancer mage. The most obvious allies of the cancer mage are

undead creatures.

Hit Die: d6.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Cancer mages are pro-

ficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of

armor, and with shields.

Sneak Attack (Ex): If a cancer mage can catch an oppo-

nent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from

his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Basi-

cally, any time the cancer mages target would be denied her

Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity

bonus or not), the cancer mages attack deals +1d6 points of

damage. This extra damage increases by +1d6 points every

four levels (+2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 9th level). Should

the cancer mage score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this

extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a cancer mage can make

a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal

damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage

to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the

usual 4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of his

weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

A cancer mage can only sneak attack a living creature with

a discernible anatomyundead, constructs, oozes, plants,

and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Addition-

ally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune

to sneak attacks. Also, the cancer mage must be able to see

the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be

able to reach a vital spot. A cancer mage cannot sneak attack

while striking at a creature with concealment or by striking

the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

If a cancer mage gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.

Disease Host (Ex): At 1st level, a cancer mage suffers no

ill effects of diseases, except for purely cosmetic ones such

as boils, pockmarks, watery eyes, blackened skin, hair loss,

foul smell, and so on. The cancer mage becomes a carrier of

every disease he encounters, though he remains immune to

most of their effects.

However, the cancer mage takes 1d6 points of damage

per caster level if someone casts a cure disease spell or effect

on him (he can make a Fortitude save to try to resist the

effect). Furthermore, if the cancer mage has a cancerous

companion (see below), he loses all abilities gained from

the companion for 1d10 days after being the subject of a

cure disease spell.

Contagion (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, the touch of a

cancer mage carries a contagion spell once per day per class

level. The DC for the targets saving throw is 13 + the cancer

mages Wisdom modifier.

Cancerous Companion (Ex): At 2nd level, a cancer

grows within the cancer mage, forming a large tumor. This

cancerous growth gains intelligence and a personality dis-

tinct from the cancer mage. The companion and the cancer

mage can communicate telepathically. When needed, the

cancerous companion uses the cancer mages scores for

saves, ability scores other than Intelligence, and so forth.

The cancerous companion gains abilities as the cancer mage

gains levels.

Tatterdemalion (Ex): Gathering scraps of clothing and

old, discarded rags, a 3rd-level cancer mage is able to make

such articles into light armor with a the following stats:

armor bonus +4, maximum Dex bonus +5, armor check

penalty 1, arcane spell failure 15%, speed 30 ft./20 ft.,

weight 20 lb. Only a 3rd-level or higher cancer mage can

wear this armor and gain these benefits; other wearers treat

it as padded armor. This armor is considered masterwork

quality and can be fashioned into magic armor.

Poison (Sp): Once per day per class level beginning at 3rd

level, the touch of a cancer mage carries a poison spell. The

DC for the targets saving throw is 14 + the cancer mages

Wisdom modifier.

Children of the Night (Su): A 4th-level cancer mage

commands the lesser creatures of the world and can call

forth a swarm of 2d6 Small monstrous spiders or a pack of

4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10 bats, once per day, as a stan-

dard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve

the cancer mage (understanding his mental commands) for

up to 10 minutes per class level.

Viral Agent (Su): At 5th level, a cancer mage befriends a

disease or virus that infests his body. He supernaturally

enhances a disease, making it smarter by giving it a point of

his own Intelligence. He establishes a telepathic link with

the disease that functions at a range of one mile per class

level of the cancer mage.

The cancer mage can then attempt to infect a target with

his viral agent, using his contagion ability. If successful, the

viral agent can tell the cancer mage telepathically what its

host experiences. In all other respects, the viral agent is a

normal disease; if the victim fights it off or a cure disease spell

is used, the disease and the viral agent die. The cancer mage

regains his Intelligence point 24 hours after the viral agent

dies. The cancer mage can create as many viral agents as he

is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.

Infected Wound (Ex): Once per day per class level

beginning at 6th level, a cancer mage can infect his foe with

an infectious taint after making a successful melee attack.

The foe takes 1 point of Constitution damage and must

make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + cancer mages class level +

cancer mages Wis modifier) 1 hour later or take a further

1d6 points of Constitution damage.

Insect Plague (Sp): At 7th level, a cancer mage invokes

insect plague once per day as a cleric of his class level.

Insect Armor (Su): By allowing insects and worms to

crawl over his body, a 7th-level cancer mage gains a +4 natu-

ral armor bonus. The cancer mage cannot wear armor heav-

ier than light armor and keep this benefit, however.

USING PRESTIGE CLASSES

Each  of  the  prestige  classes  presented  in  this  chapter  is  a

nonplayer character waiting to plague player characters. Each

is  a  villain  itching  to  be  given  a  scheme,  a  plot,  or  a  sinister

goal.  Although  Chapter  1  has  much  to  say  about  creating

villains and offers a number of examples, you can treat each of

these prestige classes as a villainous plot generator.

pqqqqrs

The  warriors  of  darkness,  for  example,  might  be  an  evil

martial organization in your campaign led by a fallen paladin

who  seeks  the  destruction  of  his  old  church.  Maybe  the

disciple of Grazzt in your campaign is a cultist who plans on

using  charm spells  and  the  Disguise  skill  to  kidnap  six  chil-

drenone for each of his dark lords fingers. At the next new

moon, the children will all be sacrificed.

Viral Ally (Su): In a fashion similar to the viral agent abil-

ity, a cancer mage of 8th level or higher can create a viral ally

by devoting 3 points of Intelligence to a disease or virus in

his system. The cancer mage can then bestow his viral ally

upon a humanoid victim using his contagion ability, and the

viral ally can communicate telepathically with the cancer

mage. The viral ally (and thus the cancer mage) controls its

host as surely as with a dominate person spell, although the

host gets no separate saving throw to avoid the dominate

person effect. The viral ally is a normal disease, however, and

the victim can fight it off with successful Fortitude saves or

a cure disease spell, either of which kills the viral ally. The

cancer mage regains his missing Intelligence points 24

hours later. A cancer mage can create as many viral allies as

he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.

Disease Form (Su): At 10th level, a cancer mage gains

the ability to tranform into a disease once per day. (This abil-

ity also affects up to 100 pounds of gear the cancer mage is

carrying, plus tatterdemalion armor, insect armor, and a can-

cerous companion.) As a disease, the cancer mage is intangi-

ble and invisible to standard methods of observation, even

blindsight. Creatures with the scent ability note a foulness

in the air. The cancer mage cannot move, except with the

wind (if any), or within a host.

The cancer mage may adopt his disease form as a standard

action, attempting to infect a living creature within 100 feet.

A potential victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 20)

to avoid being infected with the cancer mage. Any creature

that comes within 10 feet of a cancer mage in disease form is

subject to the saving throw to resist infection as well. Once

inside an infected host, the cancer mage deals 1d3 points of

Constitution damage per day after a 24-hour incubation

period. The victim has no way of knowing that the cancer

mage is anything other than a normal illness.

The cancer mage travels with the victim, aware of what-

ever the victim is aware of. A number of times per day equal

to the cancer mages Charisma bonus, the cancer mage can

attempt to force the victim to take one rounds worth of

actions of the cancer mages choosing; a successful Will

save (DC 18 + cancer mages Wis modifier) allows the

victim to resist this. While controlling his victim, the

cancer mage has access to all skills, feats, spells, and special

abilities of the host, plus any of his own that he can use in

his disembodied state.

The cancer mage can leave his host at any time, allowing

the victim to recover normally. The victim can also attempt

to force the cancer mage out by making Fortitude saves as if

the cancer mage were a normal disease. Heal checks help

the victim as they would normally. A cure disease spell kills

the cancer mage if he fails a Fortitude save (calculating the

save DC as for spells of the same level). Even if the cancer

mage succeeds at the saving throw, he is forced to reassume

his material form adjacent to the victim.

A cancer mage can remain in disease form as long as he

desires, or he can return to his natural form and be done

with the disease form for that day. While in disease form, the

cancer mage does not need to eat, sleep, or drink, and he

does not age. A cancer mage could remain dormant in a

room for a hundred years, then take his material form or

infect a new victim.

DEMONOLOGIST

A demonologist is a mortal who has devoted his life to the

study of demons. He is practiced in dealing with them,

fighting them, and using them for his own gain. He even

gains some demon abilities due to his studies and devotion

to the fiends of the Abyss. Demonologists are always evil,

although they might not think of themselves as such. No

character can get so close to the mind of utter corruption

and come away unchanged.

Most demonologists were once wizards or sorcerers,

although bards who delve into evil lore also frequently meet

the requirements of the class.

Demonologists see themselves as researchers and keepers

of lore that most people cannot handle. Thus, they often

sequester themselves away in libraries of dark knowledge.

They attempt to deal with demons on an equal footingan

extremely dangerous undertakingand rarely interact

with mortals. When demonologists see the need, they

emerge from their studies and use their dark powers to take

or do what they want; then they return to their books and

summoning circles. PCs might come into conflict with a

demonologist who is after some rare bit of lore or a magic

item that they possess. Or the characters might need the

help of a demonologist if they are planning to fight demons

and need aid or information.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int

modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the demonologist prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Demonologists are proficient with no

weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: Beginning at 1st level, a

demonologist gains the ability to cast

a small number of arcane spells. To cast

a spell, the demonologist must have a

Charisma score of at least 10 + the spells

level, so a demonologist with a Charisma

of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells.

Demonologist bonus spells are based

on  Charisma,  and  saving  throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 +

spell level + Charisma modifier. The demon-

ologists spell list appears below; a demonologist has access

to any spell on the list and need not prepare those spells

ahead of time, just like a sorcerer. A demonologist casts

spells just as a sorcerer does.

Charm Demon (Sp): A 1st-level demonologist can attempt

to charm a chaotic evil outsider, as described in the charm

person spell, once per day. The demon does not get to use its

spell resistance, though it can make a saving throw as

normal (DC 11 + demonologists Cha modifier).

Quasit Familiar (Ex): A 2nd-level demonologist gains a

:

quasit as a familiar, whether he wants it or not. If the demon-

ologist already has a familiar, the quasit devours it and takes

its place, but the character suffers no experience point loss.

The quasit is treated as a normal familiar, using the class

level of the demonologist as the masters level (see the

Familiars section in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook for

familiar abilities).

Summoning Mastery (Su): When a demonologist

of 3rd level or higher casts a summon monster spell, it is

treated as the equivalent

spell of two levels higher

for purposes of summon-

ing chaotic evil creatures.

For example, a demonolo-

gist refers to the summon

monster IV list for chaotic

evil  outsiders  when  casting

summon monster II. At 6th level, the

demonologist refers to the sum-

moning  list  three  levels

higher than the one for the

summon monster spell he is

casting.  At  9th  level,  the

demonologist refers to the list

four levels higher.

Resistances (Su): A de-

monologist who reaches 4th

level gains acid resistance 10,

cold resistance 10, fire resist-

ance 10, and electricity resist-

ance 20.

Poison Immunity (Ex): A 5th-

level demonologist is immune to

poison.

Hold  Demon (Sp): A  7th-level

demonologist can attempt to hold a

chaotic evil outsider, as described in

the hold person spell, once per day. The

demon does not get to use its spell

resistance,  though  it  can  make  a

saving  throw  as  normal  (DC  12  +

demonologists Cha modifier).

Telepathy  (Su): An  8th-level

demonologist can communicate tele-

pathically with any creature within

100 feet that has a language, just as a

tanarri can.

Dominate Demon (Sp): A 10th-level demonologist

can attempt to dominate a chaotic evil outsider, as described

in the dominate person spell, once per day. The demon does

not get its spell resistance, but it can make a saving throw as

normal (DC 15 + demonologists Cha modifier).

Demonologist Spell List

Demonologists choose their spells from the following list.

1st Level: bane, demonflesh, doom, protection from evil, pro-

tection from good, spores of the vrock, summon monster I, unnerv-

ing gaze.

2nd Level: bestow curse, dance of ruin. demoncall, magic circle

against evil, magic circle against good, protection from elements,

stunning screech, summon monster II.

3rd Level: abyssal might, call dretch horde, corrupt summons,

demon wings, dread word, dimensional anchor, lesser planar bind-

ing, summon monster III.

4th Level: bestow greater curse, call nightmare, cloud of the

achaierai, dismissal, impotent possessor, imprison possessor, planar

binding, summon monster IV.

power. When the diabolist dies (permanently), her soul

becomes the possession of a powerful devil. The devil uses

the soul as it sees fit.

CLASS SKILLS

The diabolists class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge

(the planes) (Int), Scry (Int), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

DIABOLIST

The diabolist is one who has thrown in her lot with the

forces of hell. Unlike the disciples of Asmodeus or other

archdevils, the diabolist is not a servant of a specific power-

ful fiend, but instead is usually a mortal being who has seen

the dark path as a means to gaining great power. She does

not serve devilsshe wants to be one.

Diabolists are usually wizards, but sorcerers, clerics, and

sometimes bards seek such devilry. Diabolists usually

develop a particular hatred for paladins and bland contempt

for nonspellcasters.

Diabolists are often loners, but they occasionally work in

sinister cabals. They usually seek political power as well as

magical power. Diabolists often use their dire power to

intimidate and destroy their enemies. Because of their dia-

bolism power, they are particularly skilled at dealing with

good foes, and they focus their power on good-aligned char-

acters when possible. It is common for a diabolist to have

devils working with her, but it is just as likely to find her

with legions of undead, well-paid mercenaries, or fanatical

cultists.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a diabolist, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful evil.

Base Save Bonus: Will +5.

Skills: Bluff 3 ranks, Intimidate 3 ranks, Knowledge (the

planes) 8 ranks.

Feats: Evil Brand, Corrupt Spell.

Special: Must be able to cast shriveling.

essarily her loyaltyto the forces of hell in exchange for

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the diabolist prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Diabolists are profi-

cient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a diabolist attains 1st level, and at every

level after that, the character gains new spells per day as if

she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she

belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of controlling or

rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit

points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so

on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

This essentially means that she adds the new level of dia-

bolist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the

character has, then determines spells per day, spells known,

and caster level accordingly. For example, if Lady Mandrake,

a 9th-level sorcerer, gains a level in diabolist, she gains new

spells as if she had risen to 10th level in sorcerer, but uses the

other diabolist aspects of level progression such as base

attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level of sor-

cerer, making her a 10th-level sorcerer/1st-level diabolist,

she gains spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a sorcerer.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

she became a diabolist, she must decide to which class she

adds the level of diabolist.

Diabolism (Ex): A diabolist can choose to grant one of

her spells greater magical power once per day plus one

additional time for every three class levels. Any spell the

diabolist casts that affects a target or area (one that does not

include herself ) gains the evil descriptor and deals +1d6

points of unholy damage to any good character affected by

the  spell.  For  example,  a  fireball  cast  by  a  6th-level

wizard/1st-level diabolist deals 7d6 points of fire damage

and 1d6 points of unholy damage. A hold person spell cast

by the same diabolist holds a humanoid target motionless

and deals 1d6 points of unholy damage if the target is good.

At 5th level, the unholy damage increases to +2d6 points.

At 10th level, the unholy damage increases to +3d6 points.

Imp Familiar (Ex): A 2nd-level diabolist gains an imp as a

familiar, whether she wants it or not. If the diabolist already

has a familiar, the imp devours it and takes its place. The imp

is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the dia-

bolist as the wizards level (see the Familiars section in Chap-

ter 3 of the Players Handbook for familiar abilities).

Spellcasters (arcane or divine) often make the best dis-

ciples of Asmodeus.

Disciples of Asmodeus are a part of a large but secretive

organization that crisscrosses most of civilized society. Their

hierarchy is rigid, with power-hungry members continually

moving up and down the ranks. The disciples of Asmodeus

seek nothing less than world domination. As such, their

dread master often rewards them with the service of some

minor devils or undead.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a disciple of Asmodeus, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Vile Diabolism (Ex): An 8th-level dia-

bolist can use her diabolism power to deal

half  the  normal  amount  of  extra  unholy

damage as vile damage (see Chapter 2 for an

explanation of vile damage). For example, a

fireball cast by a 6th-level wizard/8th-level

diabolist deals 10d6 points of fire damage

and 2d6 points of unholy damage. If the dia-

bolist then rolls a 7 for the 2d6 points of unholy

damage, she can (if she chooses) convert the

unholy damage into 3 points of vile damage

instead.

DISCIPLE OF

ASMODEUS

Merciless lord of the Ninth Hell, keeper of all

things forbidden and unknown, master of all

you encounter, Asmodeus, I call on your dread

name.

Gilliard DeRosan

The disciple of Asmodeus is a lordly,

domineering sort who craves unlim-

ited power. He is ruthless in his pur-

suits and uncaring of any who might

get in his way. He uses his power and

influence to learn secrets, which in turn gain

him more power, manipulate and

command others, and enhance his

own physical aspect.

Alignment: Lawful evil or neu-

tral evil.

Skills: Bluff 4 ranks, Diplomacy

5  ranks,  Sense  Motive  4  ranks.

Feats:  Disciple  of  Darkness,

Evil Brand, Leadership.

Special: The sect of Asmodeus

initiates its disciples in a horrific

rite that involves the sacrifice of an

intelligent  being. The  sacrifice

must be of someone with royal

blood or of similar political signifi-

cance.

CLASS SKILLS

The disciple of Asmodeuss class

skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentra-

tion (Con), Decipher Script (Int),

Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Informa-

tion (Cha), Hide (Dex), Innuendo

(Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowl-

edge (any) (Int), Listen (Wis), Scry

(Int),  Search  (Int),  Sense

Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int),

and Spot (Wis). See Chapter

4 of the Players Handbook for

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Asmo-

deus prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Asmo-

deus are proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a disciple of Asmodeus attains 1st level, and

at every other level after that, the character gains new spells

per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcast-

ing class he belonged to before he added the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of

that class would have gained (improved chance of control-

ling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats,

hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and

so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

This essentially means that he adds the new level of disciple

of Asmodeus to the level of whatever other spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day, spells

known,  and  caster  level  accordingly.  For  example,  if

Ulthanc, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in disciple of

Asmodeus, he gains new spells as if he had risen to 9th level

in wizard, but uses the other disciple of Asmodeus aspects of

level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus.

If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level

wizard/1st-level disciple of Asmodeus, he gains spells as if

he had risen to 10th level as a wizard.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

he became a disciple of Asmodeus, he must decide to which

class he adds the level of disciple of Asmodeus.

Charm (Sp): Once per day, a disciple of Asmodeus can

produce an effect identical to that of a charm person spell cast

by a spellcaster of his effective caster level.

Learn Secret (Ex): Through trickery, deceit, and some-

times even intimidation, a disciple of Asmodeus can learn

secrets otherwise unattainable. At 1st level, the disciple can

make a Gather Information check once per week with a +10

competency bonus. For every two levels beyond 1st level,

the disciple of Asmodeus can use this ability one more time

per week (twice at 3rd level, three times at 5th level, and so

on) until 9th level, when the disciple of Asmodeus can use

the ability once per day.

Command (Sp): Once per day, a 2nd-level disciple of

Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of a com-

mand spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective caster level.

Summon Hellcat (Sp): A 4th-level disciple of Asmodeus

can summon 1 hellcat once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective

caster level. A 9th-level disciple of Asmodeus gains the abil-

ity to summon 1d4 hellcats once per day.

Evil Authority (Sp): Once per day, at the command of a dis-

ciple of Asmodeus of 6th level or higher, all evil-aligned

creatures within 50 feet that have fewer Hit Dice than the

disciple must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dis-

ciples class level + disciples Cha bonus) or recognize the dis-

ciple as their superior. Affected creatures do not attack the

disciple of Asmodeus and do as he commands as though

affected by a mass suggestion spell. This mind-affecting ability

lasts for 24 hours.

Summon Major Devil (Sp): Once per week, a 8th-level dis-

ciple of Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of

a greater planar ally spell to call a devil and work out a bargain

for aid.

Greater Command (Sp): Once per day, a 9th-level disciple

of Asmodeus can produce an effect identical to that of a

greater command spell cast by a spellcaster of his effective

caster level.

Dread Might (Ex): Drawing some of Asmodeuss power

into himself, the disciple gains a permanent +2 divine bonus

to Armor Class and on saving throws and attack rolls.

DISCIPLE OF BAALZEBUL

Lord of the Flies! Lord of the Lies! Baalzebul, with your sly skill,

your dark poweryou are the master of my soul!

Israkahn the Liar

The disciple of Baalzebul is a liar, a cheat, and a thief. She is

more likely to kill a paladin while he sleeps than face him in

direct combat. She uses deceit and trickery to get what she

wants, betraying even her family or closest friends to

achieve her goals. Her abilities make her an astute prevari-

cator and a sneaky backstabber, but she can wield her lords

powerful influence with everything from devils to flies if

she needs to.

Rogues, assassins, bards, and sometimes rangers become

disciples of Baalzebul. Clerics of evil also adopt the class

occasionally, if they are particularly taken with Baalzebul.

Disciples of Baalzebul rarely have allies. They use and

manipulate others but eventually betray them.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a disciple of Baalzebul, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Bluff 10 ranks, Diplomacy 4 ranks, Gather Infor-

mation 4 ranks.

Feats: Disciple of Darkness.

Special: The sect of Baalzebul initiates new disciples in a

terrible ritual that involves the sacrifice of an intelligent

being. The ritual must take place in the home of the sacrifi-

cial victim.

CLASS SKILLS

The disciple of Baalzebuls class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Appraise (Wis), Balance (Dex), Climb

(Str), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable

Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Gather

Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Innu-

endo (Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion) (Int),

Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Pick

Pocket (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int),

Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Use Magic Device

(Int). See Chapter 4 of the Player s Handbook for skill

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Baalze-

bul prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Baalzebul

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all

light armors, but no shields.

Tongue of the Devil (Ex): A disciple of

Baalzebul can speak with eloquence and

believability, even when telling bold-

faced lies, by using her cunning as

well  as  her  charm. When  making

Bluff checks, a disciple of Baalzebul

adds her Intelligence modifier as

well as her Charisma modifier to

determine her check result.

Sneak Attack: If a disciple of

Baalzebul of 2nd level or higher

can catch an opponent when

he is unable to defend him-

self effectively from her

attack,  she  can  strike  a

vital  spot

for  extra

damage. Basically, any

time

the  disciples

target would be denied

his  Dexterity  bonus  to

AC (whether he actually

has a Dexterity bonus or

not), the disciples attack

deals  +1d6  points  of

damage. This extra

damage increases by

+1d6  points  every

third level afterward

(+2d6  at  5th  level,

+3d6  at  8th  level).

Should the disciple score a critical hit with a sneak attack,

this extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a disciple of Baalzebul

can make a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead

of normal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals

normal damage to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack,

not even with the usual 4 penalty, because she must make

optimal use of her weapon in order to execute the

sneak attack.

creature immune to criti-

cal hits is similarly im-

mune to sneak attacks.

Also,  the  disciple  of

Baalzebul must be able

ciple cannot sneak attack

ture with concealment

gets  a  sneak  attack  bonus

from another source (such as

rogue levels), the bonuses to

damage stack.

Suggestion (Sp): Once

per day, a 3rd-level dis-

ciple of Baalzebul can

produce an effect iden-

tical to that of a sugges-

tion spell. The DC to resist the disciples entreaties is 10 + dis-

ciples class level + disciples Cha bonus.

Summon Osyluth (Sp): A 4th-level disciple of Baalzebul

can summon 1 osyluth once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Insect Plague (Sp): Once per day, a 6th-level disciple of

Baalzebul can produce an effect identical to that of a insect

plague spell cast by a 15th-level spellcaster. The insects sum-

moned are always biting flies.

Beguiling Nature (Sp): Every other day, a 7th-level disciple

of Baalzebul can produce an effect identical to the mass

charm spell, with a Will save DC of 10 + disciples class level

+ disciples Cha bonus.

Summon Cornugon (Sp): A 9th-level disciple of Baalzebul

can summon 1 cornugon once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

King of Lies (Ex): A 10th-level disciple of Baalzebul

gains a +4 inherent bonus to Charisma.

DISCIPLE OF DISPATER

Locked in an iron fortress within an iron city in the festering iron

pit of Dis, Lord Dispater is master of all he surveys!

Ustyhrin-ja

The disciple of Dispater is a warlike general of evil. He is

defensive-minded and eager to have others fight for him.

When he must fight, he does so on his terms and on his

chosen battleground. Disciples of Dispater verge on para-

noia and are thus distrustful of everyone. They have mysti-

cal power over iron that allows them to grant themselves

even greater abilities in battle.

Fighters, rangers, and rogues become disciples of Dispa-

ter, and clerics affiliated with the archdevil also adopt the

class. They are mighty soldiers, dealing terrible damage with

their iron swords or axes.

Disciples of Dispater have few true allies, although they fre-

quently employ mercenaries and other underlings. All dis-

ciples of Dispater have some sort of headquarters that they

make as defensible as they can. High-level disciples of the

archdevil command great fortresses and their own armies.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a disciple of Dispater, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats: Disciple of Darkness, Expertise, Power Attack.

Special: Dispaters sect initiates new disciples in a terrible

ritual that involves the sacrifice of an intelligent being atop

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the disciple of Dispater

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Dispater

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Device Lore (Ex): A disciple of Dispater can find traps

made mostly of metal just as a rogue can. Furthermore, he

gains a +2 competency bonus on Disable Device checks

against devices made mostly of metal.

Iron Hews (Su): Once per day per point of Constitution

bonus, a 2nd-level disciple of Dispater may add a +3 divine

bonus on damage from attacks made that round.

Rusting Grasp (Sp): Once per day, a 3rd-level disciple of

Dispater can produce an effect identical to that of the rusting

grasp spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Iron Power (Ex): When using an iron or steel weapon, a

4th-level disciple of Dispater gains a +1 insight bonus on

attack and damage rolls. Furthermore, his threat range is

doubled as if he were using a keen weapon. At 8th level, the

insight bonus improves to +2, and the threat range triples.

This ability does not stack with the keen weapon quality, but

it does stack with the Improved Critical feat.

Summon Erinyes (Sp): A 5th-level disciple of Dispater can

summon 1 erinyes once per day. This functions as a summon

monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster. A 9th-level disciple

of Dispater can summon 1d4 erinyes once per day.

Greater Iron Hews (Su): Once per day per point of

Constitution bonus, a 6th-level disciple of Dispater may add

a +6 divine bonus on damage from attacks made that round.

While this bonus does not stack with the iron hews abil-

ity, the abilities are separate: A disciple of Dispater with a

Constitution bonus of +3 can use each ability three times

per day.

Ironskin (Sp): Once per day, a 7th-level disciple of Dispa-

ter can produce an effect identical to that of the stoneskin

spell cast by a 15th-level caster upon himself only.

Iron Body (Sp): Once per day, a 10th-level disciple of Dis-

pater can produce an effect identical to that of an iron body

spell cast by an 18th-level caster.

DISCIPLE OF MAMMON

Almighty Mammon, lord of lust and king of covetousness, I call

upon your great might to get what I want. I prostrate myself before

you and your relentless power. Bring me my hearts desire.

Zbavra the Witch-Queen

The disciple of Mammon takes what she wants any way she

can. She is quick to betray her friends and allies to get ahead,

and she will put herself in an embarrassing or awkward posi-

tion if it ultimately leads to what she wants. The disciple of

Mammon has no honor, no shame, and no scruples. Her

abilities help her not only to lie, cheat, and steal, but also to

avoid danger at the expense of others.

Evil rogues and bards sometimes become disciples of

Mammon, particularly those who are more interested in

stealing than killing.

Disciples of Mammon generally operate alone. Although

they might join a guild or operate with allies, disciples of

Mammon betray their companions so quickly that they

soon develop a poor reputation. For this reason, among

others, Mammons disciples are often on the move, one step

ahead of those they have betrayed, cheated, and robbed.

Goblinoid creatures are sometimes drawn to the service of

Mammonas is the occasional evil dragon (usually one

that deals with the outside world, not a remain-in-its-lair

sort of dragon).

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a disciple of Mammon, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Appraise 6 ranks, Open Lock 4 ranks, Pick Pocket

4 ranks.

Feats: Disciple of Darkness.

Special: The character must go through a disgusting and

humiliating sexual ritual and betray her closest friend to an

evil end before she can properly serve her new master.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  disciple  of

Mammon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Mammon

are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but no

type of armor or shields.

Lie (Su): A disciple of Mammon gains a +4 competence

bonus on Bluff checks and spell resistance of 11 + disciple

level against spells that reveal falsehood, such as zone of truth

and discern lies, even when spell resistance is normally not

allowed (such as with discern lies).

Cheat (Sp): Once per day per class level, a disciple of

Mammon can produce an effect identical to that of a cheat

spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Thief (Ex): A 3rd-level disciple of Mammon gains a +4

competence bonus on Pick Pocket and Open Lock checks.

Steal (Sp): A 3rd-level disciple of Mammon can call a

single unattended object weighing no more than 5 pounds

to her as if using telekinesis. This functions as the spell cast by

a 15th-level caster.

Divert Attack (Ex): Three times per day, a 4th-level dis-

ciple of Mammon can maneuver events so that an oppo-

nents melee attack meant for her is actually directed at

another character within the attackers reach. The new

target must also be a foe of the attacker. If there is no such

foe within reach, the maneuver fails.

Summon Osyluth (Sp): A 5th-level disciple of Mammon

can summon 1 osyluth once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Take Object (Ex): A 6th-level disciple of Mammon gains

a +4 competence bonus on attempts to disarm a foe, and she

draws no attacks of opportunity for making an attempt

unarmed.

Enhance Value (Ex): By careful, slight modifications, a

7th-level disciple of Mammon can increase the value of a

nonmagical item of value, such as a gem, an art object, or a

piece of equipment. The disciple spends 1 hour performing

these modifications and then makes an Appraise check,

increasing the value of the object by 1% per point of the

check result. A disciple of Mammon cannot enhance some-

thing with a readily obvious value, such as a coin, and she

cannot enhance the same object twice.

Divert Spell (Ex): Once per day, an 8th-level disciple of

Mammon can maneuver events so that an opponents spell

targeted on her is actually targeted at another instead. The

new target must be within range and must also be a foe of

the attacker. If there is no such foe within reach, the maneu-

ver fails.

Nondetection (Sp): A 9th-level disciple of Mammon can

constantly produce an effect identical to a nondetection spell

cast by an 18th-level caster. This ability cannot be dispelled,

but it can be suppressed.

Summon Gelugon (Sp): A 10th-level disciple of Mammon

can summon 1 gelugon once per day. This functions as a

summon monster spell cast by an 18th-level caster.

DISCIPLE OF

MEPHISTOPHELES

Mephistopheles, Lord of Hellfire and Duke of Brimstone, I call

upon you in your fiery elegance. I pledge myself to you, rightful

King of Hell. One day your dark power will reign supreme.

Nhagruul, hellfire master

The disciple of Mephistopheles wields

hellfire as his weapon, striking down

all who oppose him. He focuses on all

things fire-related, as is fitting with

the preoccupation of the arch-

devil he serves.

Clerics, wizards, and sor-

cerers  are  the  most  fre-

quent converts to Mephis-

topheles, although virtu-

ally any class can learn to

wield the deadly power

of hellfire.

Disciples of Mephis-

topheles are equally com-

fortable alone or in gather-

ings: covens of evil schemers

and destructive megaloma-

niacs. Although the com-

pany of devils is pleasant,

disciples of Mephistophe-

les just as frequently find

themselves  among  hell

hounds, salamanders, and

other evil fire creatures.

Fire giants often attempt

to become disciples of

Mephistopheles.

Flare (Sp): Once per day per class level, a disciple of

Mephistopheles can produce an effect identical to that of a

flare spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

Summon Hamatula (Sp): A 5th-level disciple of Mephis-

topheles can summon 1 hamatula once per day. This

functions as a summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level

caster. A 9th-level disciple can summon 1d4 hamatulas

once per day.

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:54 AM  Page 63

Hellfire Storm (Sp): Twice per day, an 8th-level disciple of

Mephistopheles can produce an effect identical to that of

Body of Flame (Su): A 10th-level disciple of Mephis-

topheles can transform his body into flame for up to 10 min-

utes once per day. He gains fire immunity and damage

rounds (see Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide). A burning creature can take a move-equiva-

lent action to put out the flame.

Creatures hitting a disciple of Mephistopheles with natu-

ral weapons or unarmed attacks take 2d6 points of fire

damage and also catch fire unless they succeed at a Reflex

save (DC 15).

LIFEDRINKER

Amid the ranks of the undead, the vampires are some of the

most feared creatures that stalk the night. Yet even those

cursed with vampirism have those that they respect and

fear. One such secretive group has many names, but most

often they are called lifedrinkers.

Lifedrinkers are vampires who have been undead for a

very long time, honing their evil abilities to the fullest. They

focus on their inherent ability to feed upon the living. Vam-

pire  wizards,  sorcerers,  and  clerics  make  the  best

lifedrinkers, for the primary ability of the lifedrinker is to

turn life energy and blood stolen from another into magical

power.

Like most vampires, lifedrinkers are likely to have a host

of charmed guardians, vampire spawn, and other servants.

They often keep a small number of living beings to feed

upon, referring to the captives as their cattle.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a lifedrinker, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks.

Special: Must be a vampire.

CLASS SKILLS

The lifedrinkers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (arcana) (Int),

Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (any) (Wis),

Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot

(Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Player s Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Lifewell (Ex): A lifedrinker stores the life energy that it

steals in a reservoir within itself called a lifewell. From this

lifewell, the lifedrinker draws the power needed to use

their its abilities. A lifedrinker gains lifewell points by

bestowing negative levels and by dealing Constitution

drain. Each negative level bestowed by the vampires

energy drain ability grants 2 lifewell points. Each point of

Constitution drained grants 1 lifewell point. The lifewell of

a  lifedrinker  can  hold  a  maximum  of  3  points  per

lifedrinker level. Lifewell points gained when the lifewell

is already full are wasted.

A lifedrinker with 0 lifewell points must succeed at a Will

saving throw (DC 20) or go temporarily insane, attacking

any living creature within sight until the lifewell has at least

1 point per lifedrinker level. A successful saving throw

means that the lifedrinker need not make a saving throw

against this temporary insanity until one week has passed

and even then only if the lifewell has remained at 0 points

throughout the week.

Invigorate (Ex): A lifedrinker can spend 1 lifewell point to

gain 1d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last 24 hours,

and while they do not stack with those granted by other

sources of temporary hit points, they do stack with more hit

points gained from the invigorate ability, so a lifedrinker may

spend multiple lifewell points to gain more temporary hit

points. No more lifewell points may be spent on this ability in

any given day than the lifedrinker has levels.

Spell Boost (Empower) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 2nd level

or higher casts spells, it may spend 4 lifewell points to

empower a spell as if using the Empower Spell feat. The

spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Spell Boost (Heighten) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 3rd level

or higher casts spells, it may spend a variable number of

lifewell points to heighten a spell as if using the Heighten

Spell feat. For every 2 lifewell points devoted to the spell

boost, the spells effective level is treated as one higher for

purposes of save DC and other effects. For example, if a

lifedrinker spends 4 lifewell points to boost a fireball spell,

the spell is treated as a 5th-level spell when calculating the

Reflex save DC, and the boosted fireball can penetrate a

minor globe of invulnerability, which a 3rd-level fireball cannot.

The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Special Attack Boost (Empower) (Ex): A 4th-level

lifedrinker can spend 4 lifewell points to empower a special

attack, increasing its variable, numeric effects by a factor of

1.5. The special attack is empowered for one use only. For

example, a lifedrinker empowering its blood drain ability

would drain 1d3 points of Constitution, multiplied by 1.5. A

lifedrinker could also use this ability to summon more crea-

tures using the children of the night ability it gains as a vam-

pire. Some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities

that  they  can  use  with  this  ability;  a  sea  hag  vampire

lifedrinker, for example, could use this to empower her hor-

rific appearance.

Blood Servant (Ex): By spending 10 lifewell points, a

5th-level lifedrinker can call forth a lesser planar ally (evil

only), as per the spell of the same name. The ally automati-

cally serves the lifedrinker for 24 hours.

Boost Defenses (Ex): At 5th level, a lifedrinker can

spend 8 lifewell points to add +2 to its natural armor bonus

and turn resistance, add +10 to its cold resistance and elec-

tricity resistance, and increase its damage reduction to

20/+2. The effects last for 24 hours.

Spell Boost (Maximize) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 6th level

or higher casts spells, it can spend 6 lifewell points to maxi-

mize a spell as if using the Maximize Spell feat. The spell slot

and level of the spell do not change.

Greater Blood Drain (Ex): At 7th level, a lifedrinkers

blood drain ability now deals 1d6 points of Constitution

drain.

Special Attack Boost (Maximize) (Ex): A lifedrinker of

7th level or higher can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize

all variable, numeric effects of a special attack. The special

attack is maximized for one use only. A lifedrinker using this

ability to maximize its greater blood drain ability, for exam-

ple, would deal 6 points of Constitution drain. A lifedrinker

could also use this ability to summon the maximum number

of creatures using the children of the night ability it gains as

a vampire. Some lifedrinkers might have other special abili-

ties that they can boost in a similar fashion.

Spell Boost (Quicken) (Ex): If a lifedrinker of 8th level

or higher casts spells, it can spend 8 lifewell points to

quicken one of its spells, as if using the Quicken Spell feat.

The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.

Greater Invigorate (Ex): Whenever a 9th-level life-

drinker uses its invigorate ability, it gains a +1 enhancement

bonus to Strength for each lifewell point spent. If multiple

lifewell points are spent at the same time, the bonus is cor-

respondingly larger. A lifedrinker that spends 10 lifewell

points all at once on invigorate gains 10d6 temporary hit

points and a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength. But if the

lifedrinker spends 5 lifewell points in one round and 5 more

points in the next, it has 10d6 temporary hit points but only

a +5 enhancement bonus to Strength. The bonus to Strength

lasts for 24 hours.

Blood Revel (Ex): Once a 10th-level lifedrinker drains

any blood from a victim, it can choose to enter a state called

a blood revel as a free action at the beginning of its next turn

and remain in that state for 10 rounds. In this state, the

lifedrinker gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength, its damage

reduction increases to 25/+3, its fast healing increases to 10

points per round, and it may ignore its weakness toward

garlic, mirrors, holy symbols, and running water, as well as

its vulnerability to sunlight.

However, during the blood revel, the lifedrinker cannot

flee from a living foe, and must attack physically every

round. A hasted lifedrinker in a blood revel could use its

extra partial action to cast a spell as long as it also made a

melee attack that round. A blood revel ends when the

lifedrinker chooses it to end, when 10 rounds are over, or

when no living foes can be reached by a full attack, a move

and an attack, or a charge. When the blood revel ends, the

lifedrinker must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be

utterly destroyed, as if it were reduced to 0 hit points. It

must remain in its coffin for as long as it was in its revel, plus

the amount of time it took to reach its coffin.

MORTAL HUNTER

Although fiends prize the souls of mortals tempted to evil,

sometimes a mortal must simply be slain. Such a mortal,

often an obstacle to a powerful fiends evil schemes, finds

herself the target of a mortal hunter.

Mortal hunters are fiends that specialize in killing mor-

tals. For purposes of this prestige class, mortal is a term

meaning any creature not of the outsider, undead, con-

struct, or fey types. To practice their hunting skills, fiends

capture mortals and drag them to their infernal realms

where they are freed, then tracked and killed. A mortal

hunters is not only good at tracking and killing mortals, but

it learns to use mortal skins to form disguises so that it can

infiltrate mortal societies and trick individuals, drawing

them into traps.

If a mortal hunter has a character class, it is often ranger

or fighter. Mortal hunters usually work alone, but some-

times have lesser fiends to use as shock troops or to help

spring ambushes and traps. They occasionally use hounds

howlers, displacer beasts, hell hounds, or similar crea-

turesin their hunts.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a mortal hunter, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Type: Any outsider.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Move  Silently  3  ranks,  Speak  Language

Spells: A mortal hunter gains the ability to cast a small

number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, the mortal hunter

must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spells level,

so a mortal hunter with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot

cast these spells. Mortal hunter bonus spells are based on

Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + Cha modifier. When Table 510 shows 0

spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level,

the mortal hunter gets only bonus spells. A mortal hunter

without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of

that level. The mortal hunters spell list appears below; it has

access to any spell on the list and need not prepare those

spells ahead of time, just as a sorcerer. A mortal hunter casts

spells just as a sorcerer does.

Mortal Hunting (Ex): A mortal hunter gains a bonus

against mortals due to its extensive study of them and train-

ing in the proper combat techniques. The mortal hunter

gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against mortals

and the same bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills against

mortals. The damage bonus applies to ranged weapons only

against targets within 30 feet (the mortal hunter cannot

strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus

does not apply to damage against creatures that are immune

to critical hits. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the mortal hunters

bonus associated with mortals goes up by +1. This bonus

stacks with a rangers favored enemy bonus.

Mortal Skin (Su): By magically grafting bits of mortal

flesh to its own body, a mortal hunter gains the ability at 1st

level to transform (as the polymorph self spell) into any

humanoid mortal form. At 5th level, a mortal hunter can

polymorph into any mortal form except that of a dragon. At

8th level, any mortal form can be adopted. If the flesh used is

from the exact individual being imitated, the duration is per-

manent. If the flesh is from a being of the same type as the

form adopted, the duration is 1 hour. If the flesh is not the

same type as the form adopted, the duration is 10 minutes. In

all cases, the mortal hunter can dismiss the ability as a stan-

dard action. Otherwise, this ability works as the polymorph self

spell, and the mortal hunter can call upon it once per day.

Detect Mortals (Su): A 2nd-level mortal hunter can use

detect mortals at will. This ability duplicates the effect of

detect undead cast by a 15th-level caster, except that mortals

are detected.

Boost Spell-Like Ability: At 2nd level, a mortal hunter

gains this feat as a bonus feat.

Smite Mortals (Su): Once per day, a mortal hunter of

4th level or higher may attempt to smite mortals with one

normal melee attack. It adds its Wisdom modifier (if posi-

tive) to its attack roll and deals 2 extra points of damage per

class level; for example, an 8th-level mortal hunter armed

with a longsword would deal 1d8+16 points of damage,

plus 3 points of damage for its mortal hunting ability, plus

any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical

effects. If the mortal hunter accidentally smites a creature

that is not a mortal, the smite has no effect but is still used

up for that day.

Spurn Mortal Magic (Su): A 5th-level mortal hunter

applies its Wisdom modifier (if positive) as an additional

bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abil-

ities used by mortals. Will saving throws thus add double

the normal Wisdom modifier.

Claws of the Overfiend (Ex): At 7th level, the damage

dealt by all of the mortal hunters natural attacks increases

by one step. Use the table in the Size Increases section in the

introduction of the Monster Manual to determine the proper

die increase. For example, a bite that deals 1d6+2 points of

damage now deals 1d8+2 points of damage.

Mortalbane Shout (Su): An 8th-level mortal hunter can,

once per day, give a shout that stuns for 1 round all mortals

within 50 feet who fail a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma

bonus + class levels).

Slay Mortal (Su): A 10th-level mortal hunter can attempt

to slay a mortal with its touch once per day. If the mortal

hunter succeeds at a melee touch attack, the mortal must

make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + class level + mortal

hunters Cha modifier) or die instantly.

SOUL EATER

Bane of all living creatures, the soul eater is a monstrous

being that feeds on the very essence of life force. Twisted

and evileven by the standards of

creatures such as beholders, la-

mias, and mind flayersthe soul

eater is feared by all creatures that

live. Soul eaters are often confused

with vampires or other undead,

but  they  are  decidedly  alive,

making their actions all the more

heinous.

Evil creatures such as the afore-

mentioned  beholders,  lamias,

and mind flayers become soul

eaters, as do destrachans, yuan-ti,

trolls, harpies, and medusas.

The occasional giant or dragon

finds the path of the soul eater

too tempting to resist. It is even

possible for good-aligned crea-

tures such as lammasus and uni-

corns  to  turn  evil  and  become

soul eaters.

Soul eaters always work alone,

although they may have enthralled

or enslaved servants.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a soul eater, a

character must fulfill all the fol-

lowing criteria.

Type: Any  living  nonhu-

manoid (monstrous human-

oid is acceptable).

Alignment: Any  evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.

Feats: Alertness, Weapon Focus (claw or other natural

weapon).

Special: Soul eaters are usually created against their will.

Sometimes, the emissary of an evil god or a powerful fiend

approaches a monster on the verge of death. In exchange for

continued life, the creature must feed on souls thereafter.

More rarely, a creature desiring the ability to feed on souls

66

undergoes a forbidden, profane ritual that allows it to

become a soul eater.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

Soul eaters are proficient with no

weapons, armor, or shields.

Energy Drain (Su): A soul eater

gains the ability to drain energy, be-

stowing negative levels upon its vic-

tims.  Beginning  at  1st  level,  the

negative level on its target. At 7th

level, the soul eater bestows

two negative levels

with a touch.

S o u l

Strength (Su):

When a 2nd-level soul eater uses its energy drain ability, it

gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for 24 hours.

Soul Blast (Su): When a 3rd-level soul eater uses its energy

drain ability, it may project a 100-foot ray of force that deals 1d6

points of damage per soul eater level against one target. The

target is allowed a Reflex saving throw to avoid the damage (DC

10 + soul eaters class level + soul eaters Cha bonus). This super-

natural ability can be used once per day, and only on a day when

the soul eater has drained levels.

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  10:55 AM  Page 67

Soul Enhancement (Su): When a 4th-level soul eater

uses its energy drain ability, it gains a +2 enhancement

bonus on all saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks

for 24 hours. This bonus stacks with any enhancement

bonuses gained to ability scores that apply to saves or

checks.

Soul Endurance (Su): When a 5th-level soul eater uses

its energy drain ability, it gains a +4 enhancement bonus to

Constitution for 24 hours.

Soul Radiance (Su): If a 6th-level soul eater completely

drains a creature of energy, it may adopt the creatures soul

radiance, taking the victims form, appearance, and abilities

(as the shapechange spell) for 24 hours.

Soul Agility (Su): When an 8th-level soul eater uses its

energy drain ability, it gains a +4 enhancement bonus to

Dexterity for 24 hours.

Soul Slave (Su): If a 9th-level soul eater completely

drains a creature of energy, the victim becomes a wight

under the command of the soul eater.

Soul Power (Su): After a 10th-level soul eater has drained

fane bonus to their saving throw DC for 24 hours. Further,

any and all spell-like or supernatural abilities the soul eater

possesses may be used twice as often as normal during that

24-hour period. For example, if an aboleth soul eater drains

energy, it may use its enslave power six times per day rather

than three times per day.

THRALL OF DEMOGORGON

The dual-lived, dual-willed prince of the Abyss, master of the mys-

terious and king of the deviants, Demogorgon, you are my lord!

Qill

The thrall of Demogorgon is a perversion of his raceand a

madman. He seeks out the morbid and the bizarre, and he

thrives on the chaotic nature of mutation and deformity. In

the service of his terrible master, he attempts to spread dis-

sent, madness, and conflict. He works to topple that which

provides order and pervert that which is true.

Multiclass characters make the best thralls of Demo-

gorgon, because he appreciates their versatility. A thrall of

Demogorgon usually works alone, and his greatest enemies

are often other thralls of Demogorgon, although he hates all

other demon prince thralls as well. Other enemies include

good-aligned characters and creaturesactually, thralls of

Demogorgon despise everyone.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a thrall of Demogorgon, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Chaotic evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks, Knowledge (religion)

2 ranks, Knowledge (any other) 2 ranks.

Feats: Willing Deformity, Thrall to Demon.

Special: Must be able to cast 1st-level spells or make

sneak attacks.

Special: A thrall of Demogorgon is initiated in a horrific

rite that involves the sacrifice of an intelligent being dedi-

cated to Demogorgon. This ceremony must take place on

unhallowed ground, at night, in the presence of a demon.

CLASS SKILLS

The thrall of Demogorgons class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration

(Con), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Intuit Direction (Wis),

Jump (Str), Knowledge (any) (Int), Move Silently (Dex), Pro-

fession (any) (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot

(Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Demogor-

gon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall of Demogor-

gon is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with

all types of armor, and with shields.

Bonus Feat or Spells: When a thrall of Demogorgon

attains 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the character gains new

spells per day as if he had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting class he belonged to before he added the pres-

tige class, or else he gains a bonus feat of his choice. If the

thrall chooses +1 spellcasting level, he does not gain any

other benefit a character of that class would have gained

(improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, meta-

received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an

increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that he adds the new level to the level of whatever

other spellcasting class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he

became a thrall of Demogorgon, he must decide to which class

he adds the level for purposes of determining spells per day.

A thrall of Demogorgon is free to choose the bonus feat at

one opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the

decision arises, or vice versa. Characters who are not spell-

casters must choose the bonus feat.

Scaly Flesh (Ex): A 1st-level thrall of Demogorgon gains

dark scaly flesh, which provides a +1 natural armor bonus. At

every three levels beyond 1st (4th, 7th, and 10th), this bonus

increases by +1. The bonus from scaly flesh stacks with that

of natural armor derived from creature type (if the thrall of

Demogorgon is a lizardfolk or troglodyte, for example), but

not from magical sources such as an amulet of natural armor.

Hypnosis (Sp): Once per day, a thrall of Demogorgon can

produce an effect identical to that of the hypnotism spell,

except that it functions as a gaze attack with a range of 30

feet. The Will save DC to resist the effect is 10 + thralls class

level + thralls Cha modifier.

Touch of Fear (Sp): Three times per day, a thrall of Demo-

gorgon of 2nd level or higher can use an effect identical to

that of the cause fear spell. The Will save DC to negate the

fear is 10 + class level + Cha modifier.

Reaching Touch (Su): Three times per day, a 3rd-level thrall

of Demogorgon can cause his arms to stretch unnaturally like

tentacles, providing him an extra 5 feet of reach for 1 round.

Dual Actions (Su): Twice per day, a 4th-level thrall of

Demogorgon can take two full rounds worth of actions in

the same round.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 5th-level thrall of Demogorgon

can summon a demon of 5 HD or less once per day. This

functions as a summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level

caster. Once per day, a 9th-level thrall of Demogorgon can

summon a demon of 10 HD or less.

Rotting Touch (Sp): Three times per day, a thrall of Demo-

gorgon can deal 1d6 points of Constitution damage as a

touch attack.

Two Personas (Ex): An 8th-level thrall of Demogorgon

goes a little insane, if he is not already mad. The thrall devel-

ops a multiple personality disorder that has the side effect of

allowing the character to multiclass freely with no experi-

ence point penalties.

Death Touch (Sp): At 8th level, a thrall of Demogorgon can

use an effect identical to that of a slay living spell once per

day. The Fortitude save DC to avoid death is 10 + class level +

Cha modifier.

Demogorgons Will (Sp): A 10th-level thrall of Demogorgon

can call upon the power of his master and be granted a lim-

ited wish spell once per day. The use of this ability requires 3

full rounds devoted to entreaties and prayers to Demogor-

gon before the limited wish is granted. The thrall must pay

the experience point cost and provide any needed material

components.

THRALL OF GRAZZT

The dark man, the shadow king, the ebony skinned master of all

things that revel in the night, oh master Grazzt, spare me your

wrath and grant me your favor!

Besmal

The thrall of Grazzt is a sinister, conniving, and thoroughly

evil master of arcane lore and dark secrets. She uses her

charm and guile to learn things that she should never

knowa sort of seductive loremaster who depends on sub-

terfuge, not study. A loremaster spends her days in a library

learning secrets, but a thrall of Grazzt steals, seduces, or

tricks them from others.

Wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and bards make excellent

thralls of Grazzt, although sorcerers are clearly the best of

them all. Grazzt is the dark man that some sorcerers learn

their initial spells from without even knowing it.

Thralls of Grazzt often work in cabals. These sinister,

secretive organizations sometimes work alongside rogues or

assassins to manage the criminal underworld of an entire

community or even an entire kingdom. The lust for power

of a thrall of Grazzt knows no bounds.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a thrall of Grazzt, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Bluff 2 ranks, Diplo-

macy 2 ranks.

Feats: Thrall to Demon, Violate Spell.

Special: Must be able to cast 3rd-level spells with the evil

descriptor.

Special: Grazzts followers initiate new thralls in a hor-

rific rite that involves the sacrifice of an intelligent being.

This rite must be performed within an area of magical dark-

ness under the influence of a desecrate or unhallow spell.

CLASS SKILLS

The thrall of Grazzts class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Decipher Script

(Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Hide

(Dex), Innuendo (Wis), Knowledge (any) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Pick

Pocket (Dex), Scry (Int), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis),

Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Grazzt

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Thralls of Grazzt are

proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: When a thrall of Grazzt gains 1st level, and every

two levels after that (plus 10th level), the character gains

new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in what-

ever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the

prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit

a character of that class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or

item creation feats, hit points

beyond those received from the

prestige class, and so on), except

for an increased effective level

of spellcasting. This essentially

means that she adds the new

level of thrall of Grazzt to the

level of whatever other spell-

casting class the character has,

then determines spells per day,

spells known, and caster level

accordingly.  For  example,  if

Kalleyis, an 8th-level wizard,

gains a level in thrall of Grazzt,

she gains new spells as if she

had risen to 9th level in wizard,

but  uses  the  other  thrall  of

Grazzt aspects of level progres-

sion such as base attack bonus

and  save  bonus.  If  she  next

gains a level of wizard, making

her a 9th-level wizard/1st-level

thrall of Grazzt, she gains spells

as if she had risen to 10th-level

wizard.

If a character had more than

one spellcasting class before

she became a thrall of Grazzt,

she must decide to which class

she adds the level of thrall of

Grazzt.

Charm (Sp): A  thrall  of

Grazzt can produce an effect

identical to that of a charm person

spell cast by a caster of the thrall

of Grazzts class level.

Spell Betrayal (Su): When casting a damage-dealing

spell at a target or targets denied their Dexterity bonus, a

thrall of Grazzt of 2nd level or higher can increase the

amount of damage dealt. A 2nd-level thrall, for example,

adds +1d6 points of damage to a spell cast against flat-

footed targets. Grazzt grants this ability in the hope that

the thrall will convince her enemies that she is their

friend, then betray them with a surprise magical attack.

The damage increase goes up by +1d6

for every two levels beyond 2nd, to

C

L

A

S

S

E

S

+5d6 at 10th level.

Dark Charisma (Ex):

At 3rd level, a thrall of

Grazzt  can  add  an

enhancement bonus

on certain Charisma-

based skill checks.

The  bonus  is  +1  at

3rd  level,  +2  at  5th

level, and +3 at 7th

level. The bonus im-

proves  Animal  Em-

pathy,  Diplomacy,  Bluff,

Gather  Information,  Handle

Animal, and Perform checks when

dealing with evil creatures.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 4th-level

thrall of Grazzt can summon a demon

of 5 HD or less once per day. This func-

tions as a summon monster spell cast by

a 15th-level caster. A 9th-level thrall of

Grazzt can summon a demon of

10 HD or less once per day.

Spellstrike (Su): If a thrall

of  Grazzt  casts  a  damaging

spell upon a target or targets

threatened  in  melee

(and thus distract-

ed), the thrall can

add  half  of  the

s p e l l   b e t r a y a l

b o n u s   ( ro u n d

down) to the damage dealt.

Thus, a 6th-level or 7th-level thrall of

Grazzt deals an additional +1d6 points of damage with a

spell against threatened targets. At 8th level and higher, this

bonus damage increases to +2d6 points.

THRALL OF JUIBLEX

All hail the dark, whispered master, patron of pestilence, and father

of slime, Juiblex the unspeakable!

Duvamil

The thrall of Juiblex is as disgusting an individual as one may

ever encounter. Oozing a horrible slime and surrounded by a

nauseating stench, these thralls have no place in normal

society, although the more powerful ones can disguise their

form to slip among civilized people.

Fighters and barbarians sometimes become thralls of

Juiblex, and clerics who favor the demon prince also take

the prestige class.

A thrall of Juiblex usually operates alone, for no one can

stand to be near it except for undead, oozes, and possibly

cancer mages.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a thrall of Juiblex, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Save Bonus: Fort +6.

Skills: Escape Artist 5 ranks.

Feats: Thrall to Demon, Willing Deformity.

Special: Must have been polymorphed or experienced

some sort of shapechanging experience.

Special: The thrall of Juiblex is initiated in a horrific rite

that involves the sacrifice of an intelligent being. At least

three oozes, slimes, or puddings must be present for the

ritual. The victim of the sacrificial ritual must be dissolved

in acid.

CLASS SKILLS

The thrall of Juiblexs class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex),

Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion) (Int),

Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), and Spot (Wis). See Chap-

ter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of Juiblex

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall of Juiblex is

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all

types of armor, and with shields.

Sickening Slime (Ex): A thrall of Juiblex can secrete a

smelly slime that coats its body in a thin layer. Anyone

within 5 feet must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10

+ the thralls class level + Constitution bonus) or take a 1

circumstance penalty on attack rolls and skill checks, due

to the outrageous odor of the slime layer.

Corrosive Touch (Ex): Three times per day, a thrall of

Juiblex of 2nd level or higher can secrete a caustic slime

on its hand that deals 2d6 points of damage. Once it is

secreted, the thrall can make an attack to get the corrosive

slime to damage a foe, dealing normal unarmed damage as

well as the damage from the slime. Because of the corro-

sive slime, this attack is not considered unarmed and does

not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Summon Ooze (Sp): At 3rd level, a thrall of

Juiblex can summon a patch of green

slime, a gray ooze, an ochre jelly, or a

gelatinous cube as the summon monster

spell  with  his  thrall  level  as  the

caster level.

Contagion (Su): Once per day, a thrall of Juiblex can

spread a disease, as the contagion spell (caster level 10th).

Alter Self (Su): At 4th level, a thrall of Juiblexs form

becomes somewhat transitory and amorphous. It can

change its appearance and form at will, as the alter self spell

cast by a 4th-level caster.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 5th-level thrall of Juiblex can

summon a demon of 5 HD or less once per day. This func-

tions as a summon monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

A 9th-level thrall of Juiblex can summon a demon of 10

HD or less once per day.

Corrosive Spew (Ex): At 6th level, a thrall of Juiblex

can spit a gout of caustic goo in a line 5 feet wide and 30

feet long once per day. The corrosive spew deals 8d6

points of acid damage to anyone in its path, with a Reflex

saving throw (DC 10 + thralls class level + thralls Con

bonus) for half damage.

Summon Pudding (Sp): At 7th level, a thrall of Juiblex

can summon a black pudding as if it had cast a summon

monster spell with its thrall level as the caster level.

Polymorph Self (Su): An 8th-level thrall of Juiblexs

form is more amorphous than ever. It can change its

appearance and form at will, as the polymorph self spell cast

by an 8th-level caster.

No Discernible Anatomy (Ex): At 10th level, a thrall

of Juiblexs form is so amorphous that it no longer need

worry about being affected by critical hits, sneak attacks,

damage from poison, paralysis, or stunning. However,

potions no longer affect the thrall either.

THRALL OF ORCUS

Bloated goat prince of undeath, master of vampires and lord of

specters, Orcus, grant me your crushing might and the deadly

power of your skull-headed wand!

Quah-Nomag the Skull-King

CLASS SKILLS

The thrall of Orcuss class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (any) (Int), Move

Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Scry (Int), and Spot (Wis).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

The thrall of Orcus has devoted herself to the demon

prince of undeath. In his service, she becomes a tool of

misery, murder, and revenge. She revels in the com-

pany of the undead, preferring their decaying

touch to that of living flesh.

Clerics, wizards, and sorcerers make the best

thralls of Orcus, although bards, blackguards,

and various multiclass characters also join

his demonic ranks occasionally.

Thralls of Orcus often work in small

groups. These cabals of necromancers and

necrophiliacs consort with undead crea-

tures and demons to form small cells of

depraved evil hidden amid bustling cities

and quiet villages. Thralls of Orcus hate

and war against the thralls of Demogorgon

and Grazzt.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a thrall

of Orcus, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus:

+4.

Skills: Knowledge

(arcana) 2 ranks, Knowl-

edge (religion) 2 ranks.

Feats: Lichloved,

Thrall to Demon.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the thrall of

Orcus prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thrall

of Orcus is proficient with all simple and mar-

tial weapons, with all types of armor, and

with shields.

Bonus Feat or Spells: When a thrall of

Orcus attains 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the

character gains new spells per day as if she

had also gained a level in whatever spellcast-

ing class she belonged to before she added the

prestige class, or else she gains a bonus feat of

her choice. If the thrall chooses +1 spellcasting

level, she does not gain any other benefit a char-

acter of that class would have gained (improved

chance of controlling or rebuking undead, meta-

magic or item creation feats, hit points beyond

those received from the prestige class, and so

on), except for an increased effective

level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that she adds the new level to

the level of whatever other spellcasting

class  the  character  has,  then  deter-

mines spells per day, spells known,

and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one

spellcasting class before she be-

came a thrall of Orcus, she must decide

to which class she adds the level for pur-

poses of determining spells per day.

Special: The sacrifice of an intelligent being is the center-

piece of the horrific rite that initiates a new thrall of Orcus.

This ritual takes place in complete darkness atop an altar

made of at least thirty skulls.

A thrall of Orcus is free to choose the bonus feat at one

opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the

decision arises, or vice versa. Characters who are not spell-

casters must choose the bonus feat.

Carrion Stench (Ex): A thrall of Orcus, when desired,

emits a terrible smell in a 10-foot radius. Living creatures in

the radius (excluding the thrall) must succeed at a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + thralls class level + thralls Con modifier) or

take a 2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls,

saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round

per class level of the thrall of Orcus. Furthermore, mindless

undead creatures within the radius of the stench believe the

thrall of Orcus to be undead.

Touch of Fear (Sp): Three times per day, a 2nd-level thrall of

Orcus can produce an effect identical to that of the cause fear

spell cast by a 10th-level caster.

Demon Wings (Su): Once per day, a 3rd-level thrall of

Orcus can bring forth massive black wings from his back.

These wings allow the thrall to fly at his normal land speed

with average maneuverability. The demon wings last for up

to 1 hour and are dismissible with a standard action. At 7th

level, the thrall can use his demon wings at will, and they

last as long as needed.

Massive Girth/Skeletal Visage (Su): At 4th level, a

thrall of Orcus must choose to become obese like her dread

master or gaunt like an undead creature. Depending on the

choice, the thrall gains the Deformity (obese) or Deformity

(gaunt) feat as a bonus feat.

Summon Undead (Sp): Once per day, a 5th-level thrall of

Orcus can summon 1d4 ghouls, 1d3 shadows, 1 wight, or 1

wraith as the summon monster spell cast by a caster of her

class level. At 9th level, the thrall can summon 1d3 mum-

mies, 1 spectre, 1 mohrg, 1 vampire, or 1 ghost instead. If she

chooses a vampire or a ghost, its character level is one less

than the thralls class level.

Pallor of Death (Su): A 6th-level thrall of Orcus can

adopt the appearance of a humanoid undead creature of her

choosing as if she had cast the alter self spell. While in this

form, the thrall has an aura of fear (as the fear spell cast by a

6th-level caster) that affects only living nonoutsiders within

25 feet. Pallor of death lasts for 1 minute per class level and

can be used once per day.

Death Touch (Sp): An 8th-level thrall of Orcus can force a

living creature hit with a touch attack to attempt a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + thralls class level + thralls Cha bonus). If the

target fails its save, it dies.

Summon Nightwing (Sp): A 10th-level thrall of Orcus can

summon 1 nightwing once per week, as the summon monster

spell cast by a 15th-level caster.

UR-PRIEST

Ur-priests despise gods. However, a small number of them

have learned to tap into divine power and use it for their

own needs without praying to or worshiping a god. Instead,

each day they go into a trance and mentally steal the power

that gods normally channel to devout clerics. Ur-priests are

canny and cunning, never stealing too much power from

any one god, but instead metaphysically slipping in, draw-

ing out the power they need for their spells, and slipping out

again. They learn to be resilient toward divine power and

creative with the energies that they steal. The greatest ur-

priest commands the level of power of the most powerful

cleric, although she does not have the clerics variety of

spellcasting options.

A member of any class can become an ur-priest, even

and in fact, especiallyan ex-cleric.

Ur-priests frequently work alone, although they occasion-

ally find partnerships with members of other classes useful.

They do not congregate into anything resembling temples,

for they fear that too many of them in one place might draw

unwanted divine attention. And of course they rarely associ-

ate with clerics or any other divine spellcasters, whom they

see as lackeys and who view them as abominations.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an ur-priest, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Save Bonus: Fort +3, Will +3.

Skills: Bluff 6 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Knowl-

edge (religion) 8 ranks, Knowledge (the planes) 5 ranks,

Spellcraft 8 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Malign Spell Focus.

Special: The character must have no ability to cast divine

spells. If that ability was previously possessed (as with an ex-

cleric), the ability must be forever forsaken.

Special: The character must be trained by another

ur-priest.

CLASS SKILLS

The ur-priests class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowl-

edge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge

(the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Scry (Int), and Spell-

craft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the ur-priest prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An ur-priest is profi-

cient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Spells: An ur-priest gains the ability to cast a number of

divine spells. To cast a spell, the ur-priest must have a

Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spells level, so an ur-priest

with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Ur-

priest bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws

against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Wisdom

modifier. When Table 516 indicates 0 spells of a given

level, such as 0 2nd-level spells at 2nd level, the ur-priest

gets only bonus spells. An ur-priest without a bonus spell for

that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level.

The ur-priests spell list is identical to the clerics spell list.

An ur-priest has access to any spell on the list and prepares

those spells as a cleric, except that she does not pray for

spells, she just takes them. An ur-priest casts spells as a cleric

does, except that unlike a cleric, she does not have the abil-

ity to spontaneously cast inflict or cure spells, nor does she

have domain spells or associated domain granted powers.

She does not have restrictions on spells with alignments. To

determine the caster level of an ur-priest, add the characters

ur-priest levels to one-half of her levels in other spellcasting

classes. (Any levels gained in the cleric class by an ex-cleric

dont count.)

Rebuke Undead: Like an evil cleric, an ur-priest of 2nd

level or higher can rebuke undead. She uses her ur-priest

level as the cleric level for determining success and damage

(see Turn and Rebuke Undead in Chapter 8 of the Players

Handbook).

Divine Spell Resistance (Su): At 4th level, an ur-priest

gains spell resistance 15, but only against divine spells and

the spell-like abilities of outsiders. At 8th level, the ur-

priests spell resistance increases to 20.

Siphon Spell Power (Ex): Because they steal whatever

power they can, ur-priests learn to manipulate their energy

in ways that confound other casters. A 6th-level ur-priest

can temporarily sacrifice two (or more) lower-level spell

slots and use those slots to prepare a higher-level spell. The

hnigher-level spell must be of a level the ur-priest can cast.

Only one exchange of this sort can be made each day. The

levels of the lower-level slots are totaled, then reduced to

three-quarters (round down) to determine the level of the

extra higher-level spell slot. For example, an ur-priest who

sacrifices a 3rd-level spell and a 5th-level spell can use that

spell slot to prepare an additional 6th-level spell (3 + 5 = 8,

and 8  3/4 = 6).

Steal Spell-Like Ability (Su): The most powerful ur-

priests can use the same techniques that siphon off the gods

spell power to steal the spell-like abilities of another crea-

ture. Once each day, when a creature with spell-like abilities

is within 50 feet of a 10th-level ur-priest, the ur-priest can

choose one of the spell-like abilities of the creature to steal

for herself. The ur-priest can use the spell-like ability as

often as the creature can, or three times per day, whichever

is less. The ur-priest uses the ability as the creature does with

regard to caster level and save DCs. This ability only lasts 24

hours. The creature with the spell-like ability does not lose

the ability when the ur-priest steals it. If the ur-priest tries to

steal a spell-like ability that the creature doesnt have, or tries

to steal an ability that is supernatural rather than spell-like,

the attempt automatically fails.

For example, if an ur-priest is near a noble salamander,

she can steal fireball and use it three times that day or steal

dispel magic and use it once that day. If she is near a pit

fiend, she could steal teleport without error (self plus 50

pounds of objects only) and use it three times per day,

because the pit fiend can do it at will. She could even steal

the pit fiends wish ability, but because a pit fiend can only

use wish once per year, the ur-priest would be similarly

limited. She could not steal that power again from any

creature for one year.

VERMIN LORD

The skittering of multiple legs across the floor, the droning

of wingsthese phenomena mark the passing of a vermin

lord. This unthinkable entity prefers the caress of the crawl-

ing legs of an insect or the fluttering wings of a fly more

than the touch of another person. The vermin lord offers

itself as a host for all manner of parasitic organisms and

insects that feed on it body. It not only allows the infesta-

tion, it revels in it.

Clerics and druids comprise the majority of the vermin

lord ranks; some cleric/rogues are present as well. Many

monstrous vermin lords, such as drider clerics, exist.

Humanoid vermin lords work with monsters such as

driders, phase spiders, and other creatures associated with

vermin. Otherwise, they operate alone, for most other

humanoids will have nothing to do with them.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a vermin lord, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Hide 3 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 2 ranks, Move

Silently 3 ranks.

Feats: Verminfriend.

Special: Must be able to cast the giant vermin spell.

Special: The vermin lord must be ordained by an intelli-

gent evil creature with a physical resemblance to vermin

a drider, chasme, gelugon, aranea, bebilith, phase spider, evil

formian, or similar creature. The ordaining creature must be

intelligent enough to communicate with the vermin lord-

to-be. Of course, such a creature will demand service or pay-

ment in return.

CLASS SKILLS

The vermin lords class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con),

Hide (Dex), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Perform (Cha), Pick Pocket (Dex), Search

(Int), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the

Player s Handbook for skill descriptions.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before

he became a vermin lord, he must decide to which class he

adds the level of vermin lord.

Chitin (Ex): A vermin lord gains a +1 natural armor

bonus to Armor Class from the chitinous plates that begin

to grow on his flesh. Every three levels beyond 1st, this

bonus increases by +1.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the vermin lord prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Profi-

ciency: A vermin lord is profi-

cient with no weapons, armor, or

shields.

Spells: When a vermin lord at-

tains 1st level and every two levels

after that (plus 10th level), the char-

acter gains new spells per day as if he

had also gained a level in whatever

spellcasting  class  he  belonged  to

before he added the prestige class.

He does not, however, gain any other

benefit  a  character  of  that  class

would have gained (improved chance of

controlling or rebuking undead, meta-

magic  or  item  creation  feats,  hit  points

beyond  those  received  from  the  prestige

class, and so on), except for an increased effec-

tive level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that he adds the new level of vermin

lord to the level of whatever other spellcast-

ing class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster level

accordingly. For example, if Silican, an 8th-level

wizard, gains a level in vermin lord, he gains new spells as if

he had risen to 9th level in wizard, but uses the other

vermin lord aspects of level progression such as attack

bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard,

making him a 9th-level wizard/1st-level vermin lord, he

gains spells as if he had risen to 10th-level wizard.

Vermin Servant: A vermin lord

gains a servant in the form of a

vermin of up to 1 HD. This ser-

vant is treated as a familiar; its

intelligence increases, and it is

considered a magical beast (see

the Familiars section in Chapter

3 of the Player s Handbook). The

vermin servant is in addition to

any familiar the character may

already have.

A vermin lord gains additional

vermin servants at higher levels.

At 5th level, the vermin servant

gained can be of up to 4 HD. At

9th  level,  the  vermin  servant

may be of up to 16 HD.

Blood  Drain  (Su): A  2nd-

level vermin lord can grow insec-

toid mandibles at will. He can use

these  mandibles  to  make  a  bite

attack that deals 1 point of damage.

Furthermore,  the  vermin  lord  can

attempt to start a grapple, provoking

no attack of opportunity. If successful,

the mandibles automatically deal 2d6

points of damage each round as they

suck blood from the victim. The blood

drain ability only works on living creatures.

Spider Hand (Sp): Once per day, a 3rd-level

vermin lord can produce an effect identical to

that of a spider hand spell cast at his effective caster level.

Swarm Armor (Su): Each day, a 4th-level vermin lord

automatically summons a swarm of insects, spiders, or scor-

pions that cover his flesh when he regains his spells. These

insects absorb up to 10 points of damage from any damaging

attack (weapons or spells). The insects die off when they

absorb such attacks, and a total of up to 5 points per vermin

lord level can be absorbed per day. Thus, a 7th-level vermin

lords swarm armor can absorb up to 35 points of damage,

although no more than 10 points from any one attack.

If a vermin lord is already wearing

armor,  the  swarm  armor  has  no

effect.

Wings of the Vermin (Su):

A vermin lord of 5th level or

higher  can  sprout  massive,

buzzing insectoid wings from

his back once per day. With

these wings, he can fly at his

normal land speed with aver-

age  maneuverability  for  1

hour. The  vermin  lord  can

carry  his  normal  carrying

capacity, and greater burdens

affect his speed as they would

affect  his  land  speed.  It  is

impossible  to  move  silently

with these wings.

Spider Legs (Sp): Once per

day, a 6th-level vermin lord

can produce an effect identical

to that of a spider legs spell cast

at his effective caster level.

Spew Vermin (Sp): Once per

day, a 7th-level vermin lord is

able to spray out a swarm of vermin

from his mouth, as a breath weapon

in a 30-foot cone. Anyone in this

area takes 1d6 points of damage

per vermin lord level, with a

successful Reflex save reduc-

ing the damage by half (DC

10 + vermin lords class level

+ vermin lords Con bonus). The vermin then

remain as if a summon swarm spell had been cast at the

vermin lords class level. The vermin are under the com-

mand of the vermin lord.

Poison (Ex): In a vermin lord of 8th level or higher, the

mandibles gained from the blood drain ability now carry a

natural venom that deals 1 point of Strength damage with

each successful bite attack and 1 point of Strength damage 1

minute later. The Fortitude save DC to resist the poison is 10

+ vermin lords class level + vermin lords Con modifier.

Hivemind (Su): A 10th-level vermin lord can form the

impetus to create a hivemind (see Hivemind in Chapter 2).

The hivemind must include the vermin lord, although he

counts as only a single individual and his Intelligence and

Charisma scores are unaffected. However, he controls the

hivemind, gains the insight bonuses, and can take advantage

of the spellcasting abilities of the hivemind if enough indi-

viduals are present. The vermin lords vermin servant can

also join the hivemind if the vermin lord wishes.

WARRIOR OF DARKNESS

The warrior of darkness, sometimes called the dark knight,

is a practitioner of black magic. He studies the dark arts and

learns the terrible secrets involved with evil rituals and

spells. However, he does not cast spells himself. Instead, he

uses his arcane knowledge to make himself a more formi-

dable combatant.

Evil  fighters,  often  those  with  a

f e w   levels  of  wizard  or  sorcerer,

sometimes  become  warriors  of

darkness. Less frequently, war-

riors of darkness come from

the ranks of single-

classed  wizards

or  sorcerers,  or

bards,  rangers,

and even clerics.

Warriors  of

darkness  often

keep  to  them-

selves, although

they  sometimes

ally themselves with

evil  sorcerers  or

wizards.

Other

times,

they employ small

g ro u p s   o f   e v i l   hu-

manoids such as orcs,

gnolls, and bugbears to

aid  them  and  guard  their

dark sanctums. They dream

of  power  and  conquest

through  viol e n c e

and bloodshed.

A  warrior  of

darkness is not

usually subtle,

nor is he barbaric. Instead, he is a chilling compromise of

physical might and intelligent sophistication.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a warrior of darkness, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

types of armor, and with shields.

Black Magic Oil (Su): A warrior of darkness can use his

forbidden arcane arts to create a magic oil that he anoints

himself with. An individual warrior of darkness makes oil

that works only on him, and he can only make one dose of

the oil each time this class feature is gained (at 1st, 4th, 7th,

and 10th level).

it. He then chooses from the above list of supernatural abili-

ties to imbue within himself permanently, picking a choice

available to him based on his class level and Charisma mod-

ifier (the highest-numbered choice possible, or any lower

one). A warrior of darkness cannot choose an ability more

than once.

Darkling Weapon (Su): With 3 rounds of preparation

(involving rituals and alchemical substances that cost 50

gp), a warrior of darkness can imbue any weapon with a +1

enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. If the

weapon already has an enhancement bonus, the warrior of

darkness can instead imbue the weapon with any magical

special quality that is the equivalent of a +1 bonus (see

Chapter 8 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for a list of

weapon qualities). The bonus or special quality only func-

tions when the weapon is in the hands of the warrior of

darkness, and it lasts 1 hour per warrior of darkness level.

The warrior can imbue only one special quality in a weapon

at a time.

ness can use his knowledge of black magic and alchemy to

class feature is gained (at 3rd, 6th, and 9th level).

When  he  creates  an  elixir,  the  warrior  of  darkness

EVIL SPELLS

Only a few spells in the Players Handbook have the evil

descriptor, but almost all the spells in this book have the

evil descriptor. Spells have the evil descriptor because they

do one or more of the following things.

They cause undue suffering or negative emotions.

They call upon evil gods or energies.

They create, summon, or improve undead or other evil

monsters.

They harm souls.

They involve unsavory practices such as cannibalism or

drug use.

WHATS EVIL?

Some would point out that a fireball spell is likely to cause

undue suffering, and it could be used to kill a group of

orphans. Does that make fireball an evil spell?

Fireball, by itself, simply creates a blast of fire. Fire can be

used for evil purposes, but it is not inherently evil. Con-

trasted with a spell such as shriveling, whose only purpose

and only possible use is to wither the flesh of another

living creature in a painful and debilitating fashion, it

becomes easier to see why shriveling is an evil spell.

The judgment cannot be based solely on effect.

Your campaign could, for example, have a spell

called vitality leech that calls upon a demon that

drains Strength points from a target for a short

time. The spells effect is only slightly different

from ray of enfeeblement, but the approach and exe-

cution are very different. Vitality leech is an evil

spell, while ray of enfeeblement is not. Although the

ultimate game effect is the same, the character in

the  game  world  faced  with  the  two  spells

undoubtedly regards them differently. Tapping

into evil power is an evil act in and of itself, no

matter what the effects or the reason for using

the power might be.

By this definition, as a variant rule, the fol-

lowing spells from the Players Handbook should

be considered evil and have the evil descriptor:

contagion, deathwatch, desecrate, doom, and trap

the soul.

CORRUPT MAGIC

Those  who  delve  into  black  magic  have

learned of exceedingly evil spells that, in

exchange for foul power, take a terrible toll on the

caster. These spells are known as corrupt spells.

Their numbers are few, but they are truly hor-

rible applications of magic.

77

AS

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:00 AM  Page 78

Spellcasters prepare corrupt spells just as they do regular

spells, but corrupt spells are available only to spellcasters

who prepare spells. Wizards and clerics, for example, can use

corrupt magic, but sorcerers and bards cannot. A sorcerer or

bard could, however, cast a corrupt spell from a scroll.

A corrupt spell has no material components. Instead, it

draws power away from the mental or physical well-being of

the caster in the form of ability damage or ability drain. The

ability damage or drain occurs when the spells duration

expires. (There are no corrupt spells with a permanent

duration.)

If a corrupt spell is made into a potion, scroll, wand, or

some other magic item, the user of the item takes the ability

damage or ability drain, not the creator. This corruption

cost, mentioned in the spells descriptive text, is paid each

time the item is used.

Corrupt spells are specific to no character class. Further-

more, they arent inherently divine or arcane spells; a divine

caster casting a corrupt spell casts it as a divine spell, and an

arcane caster casts it as an arcane spell.

SPELL LISTS

This section begins with a list of corrupt spells, which are

available to any class that prepares spells, rather than casting

them spontaneously. Following the corrupt spells are lists of

new spells for the assassin, bard, blackguard, cleric, druid,

sorcerer, and wizard classes. Each spells effect is summa-

rized here, with all the details provided in the spell descrip-

tions that follow.

Outcome

Bebilith and demon both

attack caster.

Bebilith ignores demon and

attempts to grab another

random creature (possibly

caster) within 100 feet of

where it appeared. It tries to

grab the creature, then retreat

to the Abyss to feed, never

returning.*

Bebilith flees without taking

action.

Demon flees, and bebilith

attempts to grab another

random creature (possibly

caster) within 100 feet of

where it appeared. It tries to

grab the creature, then retreat

to the Abyss to feed, never

returning.*

Demon flees, and 1 round

later the bebilith starts hunt-

ing for it.

31 or higher Bebilith grabs demon, and the

two disappear.* The demon is

never seen again.

Bebilith attempts to start a grapple with its

target. On a successful grapple check,

bebilith and its victim are both affected by

the bebiliths plane shift ability (this ability

allows the bebilith to take a creature with it,

which it cant otherwise do).

When in the presence of a demon, the

caster conjures a bebilitha demon

that hunts other demonsto kill or

chase off the original demon. This

spell is a risky proposition, however.

To determine the effect of the spell,

subtract the Hit Dice of the demon

from 12 (the HD of the bebilith), add

the result to a caster level check, and

consult the above table.

If this spell is cast while not in the

presence of a demon, the bebilith

acts as if the caster level check result

was a 10.

Material  Component:  A  bit  of  de-

mons flesh and a lump of iron.

Angry Ache

Necromancy

Level: Asn 1, Clr 1, Pain 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster temporarily strains the sub-

jects muscles in a very specific way.

The subject feels a sharp pain when-

ever  she  makes  an  attack.  All  her

attack rolls have a 2 circumstance

penalty for every four caster levels

(maximum penalty 10).

Apocalypse from the Sky

Conjuration (Creation) [Evil]

Level: Corrupt 9

Components: V, S, M, Corrupt

Casting Time: 1 day

Range: Personal

Area: 10-mile radius/level, centered

on caster

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

The  caster  calls  upon  the  darkest

forces  in  all  existence  to  rain  de-

struction down upon the land. All

creatures and objects in the spells area

take 10d6 points of fire, acid, or sonic

damage (casters choice). This damage

typically levels forests, sends moun-

tains tumbling, and wipes out entire

populations of living creatures. The

caster is subject to the damage as well

as the corruption cost.

Material  Component:  An  artifact,

usually one of good perverted to this

corrupt use.

Corruption Cost: 3d6 points of Consti-

tution  damage  and  4d6  points  of

Wisdom drain. Just preparing this spell

deals 1d3 points of Wisdom damage,

with another 1d3 points of Wisdom

damage for each day it remains among

the casters prepared spells.

Befoul

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Clr 8, Corruption 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Area: Water in a volume of 100

ft./level by 100 ft./level by 10

ft./level (S)

Duration: Permanent (see text)

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: No

The  caster  makes  water  (or  other

liquid) foul and mildly poisonous. All

creatures with 1 HD or less that are in

the water at the time of casting die

immediately. Anyone drinking this

water must succeed at a Fortitude

saving throw or take 1d4 points of

Constitution damage. Any creature

immersed in this water must make a

saving throw as if drinking it.

If the caster affects only part of a

larger body of water, the befouled water

mixes with the pure water. If the entire

body of water is no more than four

times the size of the affected area, all

the  water  in  the  body  of  water  is

befouled 24 hours later, but the damage

from drinking or swimming in the

water is only 1d2 points of Constitution

damage. If the body of water is more

than four times the affected area but

less than twenty times the affected area,

after 24 hours all of the water tastes

foul. If the entire body is larger than

twenty times the affected area, the

fouled  water  mixes  with  the  clean

water and loses all effect after 24 hours.

Material Component: A dead fish and

a drop of poison.

Bestow Greater Curse

Transmutation

Level: Brd 6, Clr 7, Demonologist 3,

Sor/Wiz 8

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster places a curse on the crea-

ture touched, choosing one of the fol-

lowing three effects:

One ability score is reduced to 1, or

two ability scores take 6 penalties

(to a minimum score of 1).

8 penalty on attack rolls, saving

throws, ability checks, and skill

checks.

Each turn, the subject has a 25%

chance to act normally; otherwise,

he takes no action.

A player may invent a new curse, but

it should be no more powerful than

those listed above, and the Dungeon

Master  (DM)  has  final  say  on  the

curses effect.

A greater curse cannot be dispelled,

nor can it can be removed with a break

enchantment, limited wish, or remove

curse  spell.  A  miracle or  wish spell

removes the greater curse, and any par-

ticular greater curse can be removed if

the subject performs some deed that

the caster designates. The deed must

be something that the subject can

accomplish within one year (assum-

ing he undertakes it immediately).

For example, the deed might be Slay

the dragon under Castle Bluecraft, or

Climb the tallest mountain in the

world. The cursed victim can have

help accomplishing the task, and in

some cases another character can lift

the curse (see the Curses section of

Chapter 2 for guidelines).

Bestow Wound

If the caster is wounded, she can cast

this spell and touch a living creature.

The creature takes the casters wounds

as damage, either 1 point of damage

per caster level or the amount needed

to bring the caster up to her maxi-

mum hit points, whichever is less. The

caster heals that much damage, as if a

cure spell had been cast on her.

Material  Component:  A  small  eye

agate worth at least 10 gp.

Black Bag

Conjuration (Creation) [Evil]

Level: Asn 1, Sor/Wiz 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Effect: A black leather bag

Duration: 24 hours

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This spell creates a bag full of knives,

scalpels, and other small torture imple-

ments. If the implements are removed

from the bag by anyone other than the

caster, or if they leave the casters pos-

session after he removes them, they

disintegrate after 1 round.

The bag and its magically created

contents weigh only 1 pound. Evil

magic items, including items that deal

unholy damage, and items with an

evil spell as a prerequisite for their

creation can be placed in the bag as if

it had 10 cubic feet of space. These

additional items add no weight to the

bag. Nonevil items added to the black

bag fall through as if the bag had no

bottom, so they cannot be stored in

the bag.

Material Component: A strip of black

leather soaked in the blood of a will-

ing masochist.

Bodak Birth

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Clr 8

Components: V, S, F, Drug

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Target: Caster or one creature

touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: No

The caster transforms one willing

subject (which can be the caster) into

a bodak. Ignore all of the subjects old

characteristics,  using  the  bodak

description in the Monster Manual

instead.

Before casting the spell, the caster

must make a miniature figurine that

represents the subject, then bathe it in

the blood of at least three Small or

larger animals. Once the spell is cast,

anyone that holds the figurine can

attempt to mentally communicate

and control the bodak, but the crea-

ture resists such control with a suc-

cessful Will saving throw. If the bodak

fails, it must obey the holder of the

figurine, but it gains a new saving

throw every day to break the control.

If the figurine is destroyed, the bodak

disintegrates.

Focus: Figurine of subject, bathed in

animal blood.

Drug Component: Agony.

Boneblade

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Blk 2, Clr 3

Components: V, S, F, Undead

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Effect: One bone that becomes a

blade

Duration: 10 minutes/level

The caster changes a bone at least 6

inches long into a longsword, short

sword, or greatsword (casters choice).

This weapon has a +1 enhancement

bonus  on  attacks  and  damage  for

every five caster levels (at least +1,

maximum  +4).  Furthermore,  this

blade deals an extra +1d6 points of

damage to living targets and an addi-

tional +1d6 points of damage to good-

aligned targets.

This spell confers no proficiency

with the blade, but the caster doesnt

need to be the one wielding the blade

for it to be effective.

Focus: A 6-inch-long bone.

Target: One creature that has a skele-

ton

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half or

Fortitude negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster causes some bone within a

touched creature to break or crack.

The caster cannot specify which bone.

Because the damage is general rather

than specific, the target takes 1d3

points of Constitution damage. A For-

titude save reduces the Constitution

damage by half, or negates it if the full

damage would have been 1 point of

Constitution damage.

Material Component: The bone of a

small child that still lives.

Components: V, S, Soul

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: 2d4 dretches

Duration: One year

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The caster calls 2d4 dretches from the

Abyss to where she is, offering them

the  soul  that  she  has  prepared.  In

exchange, they will serve the caster

for one year as guards, slaves, or what-

ever else she needs them for. They are

profoundly  stupid,  so  the  caster

cannot give them more complicated

tasks than can be described in about

ten words.

No  matter  how  many  times  the

caster casts this spell, she can control

no more than 2 HD worth of fiends

per caster level. If she exceeds this

number, all the newly called creatures

fall under the casters control, and any

excess from previous castings become

uncontrolled.  The  caster  chooses

which creatures to release.

Nine Hells to where he is, offering

them the soul that he has prepared. In

Effect: One nightmare

Duration: One week

Saving Throw: None

The caster calls a nightmare from the

Lower Planes to where she is, offering

it the soul that she has prepared. In

exchange, the nightmare serves the

caster for one week as a mount or

guard,  although  if  the  nightmare

moves more than 150 feet away from

her, it immediately returns whence it

the caster completely consumes one

dead body so that absolutely nothing

remains. A creature whose body is

destroyed by a charnel fire spell can

only be brought back to life through a

true resurrection spell. If this spell is cast

upon a corporeal undead, the creature

gets a Will saving throw, and the caster

must overcome its spell resistance (if

any). If the undead creature fails its

save, it is destroyed forever.

At one point during the duration of

this spell, the caster can alter the prob-

ability of a game of chance. This spell

can only affect nonmagical games,

such as those using cards or dice. It

cannot affect a game involving magic,

nor a magic item involved in a game

of  chance  (such  as  a  deck  of  many

things). Whenever a roll is made to

determine the outcome of the game,

the caster may force a reroll of the out-

come and take the better of the two

rolls.

For example, Darkon is playing a

game called dragonscales, which he

has a 1 in 4 chance of winning. The

DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells the

player  that  Darkon  lost.  Darkon,

under the effect of a cheat spell, can

have the DM reroll. The spell alters

probability, so there is no subterfuge

that another character could notice

(except for the casting of the spell

itself ). To even an astute observer, it

appears that the caster is just lucky.

Focus:  A  pair  of  dice  made  from

human bones.

Circle of Nausea

Evocation [Evil]

Level: Clr 3, Drd 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Area: An emanation extending in a

20-ft.-radius around a 2-ft.-radius

circle on the ground with the

caster in the center

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Evil energy bursts in all directions

from the spells origin, filling the area

with pain. Everyone in the spells area

must succeed at a Fortitude saving

throw  or  take  a  2  penalty  on  all

attack rolls, saving throws, and skill

checks. Those  who  succeed  at  the

saving throw must make a new saving

throw each round if they remain in

the area. The pain lasts as long as the

spell does.

The  caster  stands  in  the  circle,

which must be prepared ahead of time

by inscribing a circle on the ground

and putting a stone on the circle at

each of the four cardinal directions.

Creating this circle takes 1 hour, but

once created it may be reused any

number of times.

If  anyone  attempts  to  cross  the

circle during the spells duration, she

must succeed at a Fortitude saving

throw or be nauseated until the spell

ends, unable to take actions other

than a single move or move-equiva-

lent  action.  Nauseated  characters

cannot cross the circle. If someone

breaches the circle without becoming

nauseated, the spell ends.

Duration: 10 minutes/level

The caster gains claws that deal damage

based on her size (see below) and can

catch and tear an opponents armor and

shield. If the opponent has both armor

and a shield, roll 1d6: A result of 14

indicates the armor is affected, and a

result of 56 affects the shield.

The caster makes a grapple check

whenever she hits with a claw attack,

adding  to  the  opponents  roll  any

enhancement bonus from magic pos-

sessed by the opponents armor or

shield. If the caster wins, the armor or

shield is torn away and ruined.

The creature can make attacks with

natural weapons, the subject takes no

penalty for making two claw attacks.

The subject is treated as armed. Fur-

thermore,  these  claws  gain  a  +2

enhancement bonus on attack and

damage rolls.

If the creature already has claws,

those claws gain a +2 enhancement

bonus on attack and damage rolls, and

the claws damage increases as if the

creature  were  two  size  categories

Duration: Concentration (see text)

Saving Throw: Will negates (see

text)

Spell Resistance: No

The caster creates a magical force that

grips the subjects heart (or similar

vital organ) and begins crushing it.

The victim is paralyzed (as if having a

heart attack) and takes 1d3 points of

damage per round.

Each round, the caster must con-

centrate to maintain the spell. In addi-

tion, a conscious victim gains a new

saving throw each round to stop the

spell. If the victim dies as a result of

this  spell,  his  chest  ruptures  and

bursts, and his smoking heart appears

in the casters hand.

Consume Likeness

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Corrupt 6

Components: V, S, F, Corrupt

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: Permanent

The caster can take on the appearance

and formincluding clothing and

equipmentof a corporeal human-

oid that is freshly dead. The caster

assumes the form of the creature as it

looked when it lived. The caster must

eat the flesh of the corpse whose form

is to be assumed as he casts the spell.

Once  the  spell  is  complete,  the

caster can assume the new likeness at

will. By changing to this new form,

the casters body can undergo a lim-

ited physical transmutation, includ-

ing adding or subtracting one or two

limbs, and his weight can be changed

up to one-half. If the form selected

has wings, the caster can fly at a speed

of 30 feet with poor maneuverability.

If the form has gills, he can breathe

underwater. The caster cannot assume

the likeness of something that is a dif-

ferent size than he is.

The casters attack bonuses, natural

armor  bonus,  and  saves  do  not

change. The spell does not confer spe-

cial abilities, attack forms, defenses,

ability scores, or mannerisms of the

chosen  form.  If  the  caster  takes

damage  or  dies,  he  automatically

reverts to his normal form. The caster

can also take a standard action to vol-

untarily  assume  his  normal  form.

If the caster uses this spell to create

a disguise, he gets a +10 bonus on his

Disguise check.

Focus: A fresh or preserved (still

bloody) 1-ounce portion of another

creatures flesh.

Corruption  Cost:  2d6  points  of

Wisdom drain.

Cruel Disappointment

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if

interacted with) and Will negates

(see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

The next time the subject of this spell

attempts an action that requires a die

roll to determine success, the action

fails. However, the spell creates the

phantasmal image in the subjects

mind that the action succeeded. The

subject  behaves  accordingly  for  1

round. During the next round, the

phantasm fades and the subject now

realizes that he was fooled. If the sub-

ject fails a second Will save, he then

takes a 4 morale penalty on attack

rolls,  saves,  and  checks  for  1d6+1

rounds afterward.

ing down with incredible power. All

creatures and objects within the area

take 1d6 points of damage per caster

level (maximum 20d6). A successful

Reflex saving throw reduces damage

by half. Each round, as a free action,

the caster can direct the fist to another

area within range, where it smashes

downward  again.  It  continues  to

attack the same area unless otherwise

directed.

The fist does not need to strike the

ground. It can attack airborne targets

as well. Airborne targets that succeed

at a Reflex save take no damage and

are forcibly ejected from the spells

area.

Material Component: A severed hand

from a good-aligned humanoid cleric.

Disease Component: Festering anger.

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This illusion forces the subject to

believe his flesh is rotting and falling

off  his  body,  and  that  his  internal

organs are spilling out. If the target

fails his saving throw, he is dazed (and

horrified) for 1 round. On the follow-

ing round, he falls unconscious for

1d10 minutes, during which time he

cannot be roused normally.

the darkness spell, the area of darkness is a 20-foot

radius, and the object that serves as the spells target can

be shrouded to block the darkness (and thus the dam-

aging effect).

Damning darkness counters or dispels any light spell

of equal or lower level.

action, making the chains dance or move as she wishes.

In addition, the caster can increase the chains length

by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged

barbs. These chains attack as spiked chains that use the

casters normal ranged attack bonus on attack rolls or

grapple checks (treat each chain as Medium-size when

grappling).

The caster can climb a chain she controls at normal

speed without making a Climb check.

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: One creature or

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The caster makes one crea-

ture or object radiate spe-

cial darkness called dark-

in  a  5-foot-radius

light

sphere. This spell is most

useful in a large, naturally

dark area. Within the dark-

light sphere, creatures that

can  normally  see  in  the

light can see, even though

there is no light. Only crea-

tures  and  objects  in  the

sphere  can  be  seen,  and

only  creatures

the

sphere can see within the

sphere,  unless  other  ob-

servers can naturally see in

the dark. Thus, while two

creatures in the sphere can see each

other, a creature standing  outside

the  sphere can neither see the crea-

tures  in  the  sphere  (assuming  it

doesnt have darkvision), nor can it be

seen by them. A creature with dark-

vision standing outside the sphere

could see those within the sphere, but

those inside could not discern the

creature.

in

The darklight spells sphere is invisi-

ble in normal light and does not func-

tion in magical darkness.

The caster marks a corpse

with  a  particular  magical

signature, thus identifying

himself (truthfully or falsely)

as the murderer. Some assas-

sins use this signature as a

sort of calling card, while

others use it as a way to prove

that they earned their pay.

The signature can take many

forms: a specific expression

on  the  face  of  the  corpse

(hence  the  name  of  the

spell), an actual rune, a word

written on the corpses flesh,

a discoloration of one eye,

and so on.

Demon Wings

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Blk 3, Demonic 3,

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: 10 minutes/

level

The caster causes thorns to sprout

from the insides of the subject crea-

tures, which writhe in agony for 1d4

rounds, incapacitated, before dying. A

wish or miracle spell cast on a subject

during this time can eliminate the

thorns and save that creature. Crea-

tures that succeed at their Fortitude

saving throws are still incapacitated

for  1d4  rounds  in  horrible  agony,

taking  1d6  points  of  damage  per

round. At the end of the agony, how-

ever, the thorns disappear.

Massive, batlike wings grow

from the casters back. With

these wings, the caster can fly at his

normal  land  speed,  with  average

maneuverability. The caster can carry

his  normal  carrying  capacity,  and

greater burdens affect his fly speed as

they would affect his land speed.

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster blights and corrupts a vast

area of land. Plants with 1 HD or less

shrivel  and  die,  and  the  ground

cannot support such plant life ever

again. Plants with more than 1 HD

must succeed at a Fortitude saving

throw or die. Even those successful on

their saves take 5d6 points of damage.

All living creatures in the area other

than plants (and the caster) must suc-

ceed at a Fortitude saving throw or

take 1d4 points of Strength damage.

Unattended  objects,  including

structural features such as walls and

doors, grow brittle and lose 1 point of

hardness (to a minimum of 0), then

Distort Summons

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Demonologist 3, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10

ft./level)

Area: 50-ft.-radius spread

Duration: 1 hour/level

The caster creates an area in which

only evil creatures can be magically

summoned. No matter what a later

caster attempts to summon, he actu-

ally  summons  an  evil  version  (a

fiendish beast rather than a celestial

one, for example) or an evil equivalent

(a devil rather than a formian).

If the summoner was attempting to

summon a good or neutral creature,

the evil creature that appears does not

obey the commands of the summoner

or  attack  his  enemies.  Instead,  it

attacks the summoner, and the spell

that  summoned  the  evil  creature

cannot be dismissed. A distort sum-

mons spell can be dispelled normally,

however.

The caster grows a 3-foot-long tail.

The tail is thin, black or red, and it

ends in a spike. The caster can use this

tail to make melee attacks using his

attack  bonus,  dealing  a  base  1d4

points of damage, plus one-half his

Strength bonus. If the caster takes a

full attack action, he can use both the

tail and his normal melee attacks, but

all attacks have a 2 penalty.

cally confirmed, without a roll. The

weapon can also harm good creatures

that have damage reduction, as if the

weapon had a +1 enhancement bonus.

Individual  arrows  or  bolts  can  be

altered, but altered projectile weapons

(such as bows) dont confer the benefit

to the projectiles they shoot.

This  spell  has  no  effect  on  any

magic weapon that already has a spe-

cial ability related to critical hits, such

as a keen or vorpal weapon.

Dread Word

Evocation [Evil]

Level: Demonologist 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature of good align-

ment

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster speaks a single unique

word of pure malevolencea pow-

erful  utterance  from  the  Dark

Speech (see Chapter 2). The word is

so foul that it harms the very soul of

one that hears it. The utterance of a

dread word causes one subject within

range to take 1d3 points of Charisma

drain. The power of this spell pro-

tects the caster from the damaging

effects of both hearing and knowing

the word.

To attempt to speak this unique

word without using this spell means

instant death (and no effect, because

the caster dies before she gets the

entire word out).

The subjects lungs fill with water if

the subject fails a Fortitude saving

throw. To avoid drowning, the subject

can hold his breath (see The Drown-

ing Rule in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide). The subject gains a

new save (to expel the water) every 2

rounds after the first. While holding

his breath with water-filled lungs, a

character cannot talk or cast spells

with verbal components, and he takes

a 2 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saving throws, ability checks,

and skill checks.

Drug Resistance

Enchantment

Components: V, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The creature touched is immune to

the possibility of addiction to drugs.

He still experiences the negative and

positive effects of drugs during the

spells duration. This spell does not

free the target from the effects of an

addiction  already  incurred.  If  the

spell ends before the effects of a drug

wear off, the normal chance for addic-

tion applies.

Material Component: Three drops of

pure water.

Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Greed 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster enchants a creature so that

it feels suddenly compelled to give

her what it is holding when she casts

the  spell.  On  the  creatures  next

action, it moves as close to the caster

as it can get in a single round and

offers her the object as a standard

action. This spell allows the caster to

act out of turn and accept the gift if

the creature reaches her to hand the

caster the object (assuming she has a

free hand and can carry the object).

The subject defends itself normally

and acts however it wishes on subse-

quent rounds, including attempting

to get the object back if desired. If the

subject is prevented from doing as the

spell compels, the spell is wasted. For

example, if the subject is paralyzed

and cannot move or drop the item,

nothing happens.

Eternity of Torture

Necromancy [Evil]

a true eternity of unimaginable tor-

to each ability score each day until all

scores are reduced to 0 (except Consti-

tution, which stays at 1). The subject

cannot heal or regenerate. Lastly, the

subject is completely unaware of its

surroundings, insensate to anything

but the excruciating pain.

A single Fortitude saving throw is

all that stands between a target and

this horrible spell. However, even if

the saving throw is successful, the

target still feels terrible (but tempo-

rary) pain. The target takes 5d6 points

of damage immediately and takes a 4

circumstance penalty on attack rolls,

saving throws, skill checks, and ability

checks for 1 round per level of the

caster.

through her gaze and curses someone

with bad luck. The subject takes a 4

when the caster takes at least 1 point

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: 10 minutes/level or until

discharged

Prior to casting flesh armor, the caster

flays the skin from a creature of his

size and lays it upon his own flesh,

wearing  it  like  clothing  or  armor.

Once the caster casts flesh armor, his

skin develops resistance to blows,

cuts, stabs, and slashes. The caster

gains damage reduction 10/+1. Once

the spell has prevented a total of 5

points  of  damage  per  caster  level

(maximum  50  points),  it  is  dis-

charged, and the skin slowly rots,

shedding in patches like the skin of a

molting snake.

Material Component: A bit of flesh

torn from the casters body during the

casting (dealing 1 point of damage).

Focus: The entire freshly harvested

skin of another creature of the casters

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster evokes pure evil power in

the form of a black claw that flies at

the target. If a ranged touch attack roll

succeeds, the claw deals 1d8 points of

damage per caster level (maximum

10d8). On a critical hit, in addition to

dealing double damage, the wound

bleeds  for  1  point  of  damage  per

round until it is magically healed.

Forbidden Speech

Level: Corrupt 5

Components: V, S, Corrupt

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Target: 1 living creature

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster makes it impossible for a

single creature to speak about a single

topic. The topic should be as narrow

as possible for the spell to work prop-

erly. An appropriate topic might be

events that occurred while the crea-

ture was in captivity, the whereabouts

and names of tormentors, the secret

location of a hidden treasure, the pass-

word into a guarded compound, the

command word of a magic item, or

the explanation behind some major

occurrence. Invalid topics include

verbal components of spells, a crea-

tures whole life history, or anything

too broad for a reasonable definition

of a single topic. Whether a topic is

too  broad  is  up  the  DM,  who  can

double the corruption cost and have

the  spell  automatically  fail  if  the

caster  persists  in  attempting  an

invalid topic. Thus, this can be a dan-

gerous spell to attempt.

The affected creature cannot com-

municate regarding the topic in any

way. Speech becomes gibberish, writ-

ing is reduced to an indecipherable

scrawl, gestures are impossible, and

even  telepathy  (including  detect

thoughts) is scrambled. The creature

has not forgotten the information,

however, and it can be a maddening

occurrence  for  the  creature  to  be

unable to communicate information

that might be of life-and-death impor-

tance to friends and allies.

Corruption  Cost:  1d6  points  of

Strength damage.

Glimpse of Truth

Divination [Evil]

Level: Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, Drug

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: 1 hour

The caster sees through the veil of

reality to pose a single question to

nameless  malevolent  entities  that

exist beyond normal consciousness.

The question must be posed such that

the answer is a simple yes or no. The

answer given is correct 75% of the

time.  Answers  the  DM  deems  too

obscure are never revealed. The spell,

at best, provides information to aid

character decisions. In cases where a

one-word answer would be mislead-

ing, the DM can give a short answer

instead (five words or less).

Drug Component: Mordayn vapor.

Grazzts Long Grasp

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: 10 minutes/level

The caster causes one of her hands to

detach from her arm. She can control

the hand by thought alone as a free

action. It can fly at a speed of 20 feet

(perfect maneuverability).

On casting the spell, the caster takes

2d4 points of damage, but she is healed

by the same amount when the hand

returns  to  her  arm  (unless  it  is

destroyed or otherwise prevented from

reaching her arm before the end of the

spell). The damage heals normally. As

long as the spell lasts, the floating hand

can deliver any spell with a range of

touch that the caster can cast. The spell

gives  the  caster  a  +2  bonus  on  her

melee touch attack with the disembod-

ied hand, which functions as if it were

attached to her. The hand can flank tar-

gets as a creature can.

The hand can punch opponents (as

a normal unarmed attack with a +2

attack bonus), or it can grasp things

and  move  them  (with  the  casters

normal Strength). The hand can make

grapple attacks, but it is considered

Tiny.

If the hand goes beyond the spells

range, if the caster can no longer see

it, or if she is not directing it, the hand

attempts to return to her on its own,

reattaching to the end of the wrist.

The hand has improved evasion

(half damage on a failed Reflex save

and no damage on a successful save),

the casters save bonuses, and AC 22.

Target: One living humanoid

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The hand of the subject tears itself

away from one of his arms, leaving a

bloody stump. This trauma deals 6d6

points of damage. Then the hand, ani-

mated and floating in the air, begins

to attack the subject. The hand attacks

as if it were a wight (see the Monster

Manual) in terms of its statistics, spe-

cial  attacks,  and  special  qualities,

except that it is considered Tiny and

gains a +4 bonus to AC and a +4 bonus

on  attack  rolls.  The  hand  can  be

turned or rebuked as a wight. If the

hand is defeated, only a regenerate spell

can restore the victim to normal.

regenerate, miracle, or wish spell will

save it during this time. The target is

entitled to a Fortitude saving throw to

survive the attack. If the target suc-

ceeds at the save, it instead takes 3d6

points of damage +1 point per caster

level  from  general  damage  to  the

chest and internal organs. (The target

might die from damage even if it suc-

action the subject can take is to leave

the body it currently inhabits. This

spell, in conjunction with imprison

with a possessing fiend.

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: No

minuscule object, leaving the sub-

jects body lifeless. While trapped, the

tacle require three days. Destroying or

opening the receptacle ends the spell,

releasing the soul.

To  cast  the  spell,  the  receptacle

must be within spell range and the

caster must know where it is. The

caster must also know the name of the

target.

apart

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

The casters finger becomes a danger-

ous projectile that flies from her hand

and unerringly strikes its target. The

dart  deals  1d4  points  of  Dexterity

damage. Creatures without fingers

cannot cast this spell.

The dart strikes unerringly, even if

the target is in melee or has partial

cover  or  concealment.  Inanimate

objects (locks, doors, and so forth)

cannot be damaged by the spell.

For every three caster levels beyond

1st, the caster gains an additional dart

by losing an additional finger: two at

4th level, three at 7th level, four at

10th level, and the maximum of five

darts at 13th level or higher. If the

caster shoots multiple darts, she can

have them strike a single creature or

several creatures. A single dart can

strike only one creature. The caster

must designate targets before check-

ing for spell resistance or damage.

Fingers lost to this spell grow back

when the corruption cost is healed, at

the rate of one finger per point of

Strength damage healed.

damage per dart, plus the loss of one

finger per dart. A hand with one or no

fingers is useless.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10

ft./level)

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster blasts a lancelike projectile

of  greenish-black  energy  from  his

hand, striking a single foe as a ranged

touch  attack. The  energy  does  not

harm the subject. Instead, the subjects

closest friend or dearest loved one is

wracked  with  pain  and  takes  1d6

points of damage for every two caster

levels (maximum 10d6). There is no

limit to the distance between the caster

and the loved one, and the loved one

gets no saving throw or spell resist-

ance. If the loved one is within an

antimagic field, the spell has no effect.

It  may  take  DMs  and  players  a

moment to determine who the sub-

jects dearest loved one is. The DM

determines this for nonplayer charac-

ters (NPCs). It is rare (but possible)

that no individual qualifies. In that

case, the subject takes the damage.

Corruption Cost: 1d6 points of Intel-

ligence damage.

Masochism

Enchantment [Evil]

Level: Asn 3, Blk 3, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: Caster

Duration: 1 round/level

For every 10 points of damage the

caster takes in a given round, he gains

a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, saving

throws, and skill checks made in the

following round. The more damage

the caster takes, the greater the luck

bonus. Its possible to get a luck bonus

in multiple rounds if the caster takes

damage  in  more  than  one  round

during the spells duration.

Material Component: A leather strap

that has been soaked in the casters

blood.

Mindrape

Enchantment [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 9

Components: V, S

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10

ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster enters the mind of a crea-

ture, learning everything that crea-

ture knows. The caster can erase or

add memories as she sees fit and alter

emotions, opinions, and even align-

ment. When the caster is done, she

can  leave  the  creature  insane  (as

described  in  the  insanity  spell)  or

seemingly unaffected, without any

memory of the intrusion.

Severe changes to personality and

changes  to  alignment  can  be  cor-

rected by a break enchantment spell

(although an atonement spell might be

needed as well, depending on circum-

stances). Alterations to memories and

subtler thoughts can be restored only

through use of a miracle or wish.

Mirror Sending

Evocation

Level: Mortal Hunter 3, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: See text

Range: See text

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster sends her image through a

mirror into another mirror or mir-

rored surface that the chosen target

looks into. The caster casts the spell,

then stares into her mirror until the

target sees his reflection in another

mirror, or until the caster tires and

gives up. The caster can see the sub-

ject  and  his  surroundings  in  her

mirror whenever the subject looks at

his mirror. From the subjects perspec-

tive, the caster appears to be staring

out of the mirror, replacing the sub-

jects  own  reflection  or  appearing

right behind him (casters choice).

The caster can have her image say up

to one word per caster level before it

disappears, if she chooses. The image

remains for only 1 round. Subjects not

expecting  a  mirror  sending  can  be

greatly unnerved by this spell.

Focus: A mirror of finely wrought

and highly polished silver costing not

less than 1,000 gp. The mirror must be

at least 2 feet by 4 feet.

Morality Undone

Enchantment [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 5, Clr 5, Corruption 4,

Mortal Hunter 4

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One nonevil creature

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster turns one creature evil. The

chaotic/neutral/lawful component of

the subjects alignment is unchanged.

The subject retains whatever outlook,

allegiances,  and  outlooks  it  had

before, so long as they do not conflict

with the new alignment. Otherwise, it

acts with its new selfish, bloodthirsty,

cruel outlook on all things.

For example, a wizard might not

immediately turn on her fighter com-

panion for no apparent reason, partic-

ularly  in  the  middle  of  a  combat

when theyre fighting on the same

side. But she might try to steal the

fighters  bag  of  gems,  even  using

applicable spells (charm person, sugges-

tion,  and invisibility,  for  instance)

against her friend. She might even

eventually decide to betray or attack

her friend if there is some potential

gain involved.

Using  this  spell  in  conjunction

with a spell such as dominate person or

suggestion  is  particularly  useful,

because  it  changes  what  acts  are

against a subjects nature.

Arcane Material Component: A pow-

dered holy symbol.

Nether Trail

Conjuration (Creation)

The caster creates a handful of invisi-

ble,  nigh-intangible  powder  that

attracts  creatures  from  the  Lower

Planes. The caster can sprinkle this

powder in a trail on the ground. Evil

outsiders who come within 10 feet of

any portion of this trail and fail their

saving throws follow the trail as if

affected by a compulsion effect.

Compelled  fiends  will  follow  a

nether  trail  even  into  danger.  For

example, the trail could lead to a trap,

a holy spell effect, or even a prison

cell. If the danger is obvious, such as a

blade barrier, the compelled creatures

get another saving throw to resist.

A compelled creature only follows

the trail to its end. So, if the trail leads

to the edge of a cliff, the fiend goes to

the edge of the cliff and no farther.

If a creature encounters the trail in

the middle, it instinctively senses

which direction is forward and which

is backward. When the evil outsider

reaches the end of the trail, the com-

pulsion effect ends, and the creature

cannot be affected by this particular

nether trail again.

The  trail  can  be  obscured  and

destroyed  by  anyone  who  can  see

invisible objects. It takes a standard

action to destroy 10 feet of trail, but an

evil outsider must make its saving

throw first.

Material Component: A urine-soaked

holy symbol, which crumbles into the

powder that creates the nether trail.

No Light

Transmutation

Level: Brd 1, Clr 0, Sor/Wiz 0

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The caster creates an area of darkness.

Normal light sources cannot illumi-

nate the area, but darkvision allows a

creature to see within the area. Light

counters no light (and vice versa), leav-

ing whatever light conditions nor-

mally prevail in the overlapping areas

of the spells. Higher-level light spells

counter and dispel no light.

Pestilence

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Clr 8, Drd 7

Components: V, S, Disease

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The subject contracts a particularly

terrible and contagious disease, which

strikes immediately with no incuba-

tion period. The caster infects the sub-

ject with a sickness that deals 1d4

points of Constitution drain each day

until the subject dies. The subject may

attempt a new saving throw each day,

but she must succeed at two saves in a

row to rid herself of the disease (as

with most diseases).

However,  the  disease,  once  un-

leashed, continues to spread. For the

first  day  of  the  sickness,  anyone

touching the subject must succeed at

a Fortitude saving throw or fall victim

to the same malady. That victim in

turn becomes contagious on the first

day of her own affliction.

Disease  Component:  Any  disease.

Phantasmal Thief

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Greed 8, Wiz/Sor 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One object

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

An  invisible  force,  not  unlike  an

unseen  servant,  comes  into  being

where  the  caster  wishes.  On  the

casters turn, this force steals objects

from others as she inaudibly directs it

to (a free action). A phantasmal thief

can  only  steal  from  creatures.  It

cannot break into locked chests or

steal unattended objects. A phantas-

mal  thief  has  a  Hide  bonus  of  +20

(useful  against  those  who  can  see

invisible  creatures)  and  a  Move

Silently bonus of +20.

If  a  phantasmal  thief  goes  unde-

tected, it can steal any object a crea-

ture possesses but is not carrying or

wearing. Even objects in a bag of hold-

ing can be stolen. It can only steal

objects, bring objects to the caster, or

put them back where they came from.

It can take no other actions. A phantas-

mal  thief  takes  1  round  to  steal  an

object and another round to bring it

to the caster.

A phantasmal thief can only hold

one  object  at  a  time;  the  object

becomes invisible in the grasp of the

phantasmal thief.

The phantasmal thief cannot take an

item if the thief is detected by the

creature its trying to steal from (usu-

ally by a Listen or Spot check). How-

ever, the thief, however, can repeat

the attempt next round. It cannot be

harmed in any way, although it can be

dispelled.

A phantasmal thief can also steal an

object from a creatures hand. It does

this as if it had the Improved Disarm

feat and a +20 Strength bonus. If a

phantasmal thief is used in this way, it

disappears after it brings the stolen

object to the caster.

Material  Component: A  spool  of

green thread.

Plague of Nightmares

Enchantment [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Corrupt 8

Components: V, S, F, Corrupt

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The  caster  can  give  the  subject

demon-haunted dreams so vivid and

frightening that sleep provides no rest

and the subject eventually turns to

suicide. The caster must have a chunk

of flesh from the target and succeed at

a touch attack when she casts plague of

nightmares. If the target fails the Forti-

tude save, the spell begins to take

effect. Thereafter,  the  caster  must

chant for 12 hours per week and pay

the  corruption  cost  each  week  to

maintain the spell.

The subject begins to feel the effect

of this spell the next time he sleeps, as

nightmares of evil gods and demons

plague him. These nightmares con-

tinue each night, and each night the

subject takes 1d4 points of Charisma

damage and gains no natural healing

for that day. When the subject reaches

0  Charisma,  he  enters  a  trance  in

which he mentally offers his soul to a

demon to be devoured. That night the

subject dies and is beyond even a true

resurrection spell.

The subject gets a new saving throw

each day to resist the spell, and one

success is enough to end the night-

mares.  If  the  spell  ultimately  suc-

ceeds, the focus disappears, alerting

the caster that the subject is dead.

Focus: A fresh or preserved (still

bloody) 1-ounce portion of another

creatures flesh.

Corruption  Cost:  1d6  points  of

Strength damage, taken all at once at

the end of each week.

ft./level)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster creates a conduit of evil

energy between himself and another

creature. Through the conduit, the

caster  can  leech  off  ability  score

points at the rate of 1 point per round.

The other creature takes 1 point of

drain  from  an  ability  score  of  the

casters choosing, and the caster gains

a +1 enhancement bonus to the same

ability score per point drained during

the  casting  of  this  spell.  In  other

words, all points drained during this

spell stack with each other to deter-

mine the enhancement bonus, but

they dont stack with other castings of

power leech or with other enhance-

ment bonuses.

The enhancement bonus lasts for

10 minutes per caster level.

Corruption Cost: 1 point of Wisdom

drain.

Range: Touch

Effect: One organ

Duration: 24 hours

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

organ from a living creature so that it

does not decay or rot. Evil casters use

preserved organs as material spell

components. There are ritual uses for

The organ is kept in the exact state

it was in when the spell was cast. If a

heart is still beating and bloody, for

example, then it remains that way.

Psychic Poison

Abjuration [Evil]

Level: Clr 4, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

single object or creature that can

fit in that area

Duration: 1 hour/level

The caster taints an area, creature, or

object so that anyone casting a mind-

affecting or divination spell at the

creature or object or within the area is

subject to a psychic poison (see Table

psychic poison for which he meets

the minimum level requirement.

Arcane Material Component: A bit of

humanoid brain tissue.

Rapture of Rupture

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Corrupt 7

Components: V, S, Corrupt

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature touched

per level

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

With  this  spell,  the  casters  touch

deals grievous wounds to multiple tar-

gets. After rapture of rupture is cast, the

caster can touch one target per round

until she has touched a number of tar-

gets equal to her caster level. The same

creature cannot be affected twice by

the same rapture of rupture. A creature

with no discernible anatomy is unaf-

fected by this spell.

When the caster touches a subject,

his flesh bursts open suddenly in

multiple places. Each subject takes

6d6 points of damage and is stunned

for 1 round; a successful Fortitude

save  reduces  damage  by  half  and

negates the stun effect. Subjects who

fail their Fortitude save continue to

take 1d6 points of damage per round

until they receive magical healing,

succeed at a Heal check (DC 20), or

die.  If  a  subject  takes  6  points  of

damage from rapture of rupture in a

single round, he is stunned in the fol-

lowing round.

damage per target touched.

This spell overwhelms the target with

hallucinations,  causing  him  to  be

blinded and stunned if he fails the

save. The subject can attempt a new

saving throw each round to end the

spell.

Even after the subject succeeds at

the save or the caster stops concentrat-

ing, the subject is plagued with night-

mares every night. The nightmares

prevent the subject from benefiting

from natural healing. These night-

mares continue until the caster dies or

the subject succeeds at a Will saving

throw, attempted once per night. This

nightmare effect is treated as a curse

and thus cannot be dispelled. It is sub-

ject to remove curse, however.

The caster absorbs the life force and

physical form from a living subject

and uses it for himself. The victim

must be rendered helpless to cast this

spell upon her. For that day, the caster

heals at twice the normal natural rate

and does not need to eat. The subject,

on the other hand, does not heal natu-

rally that day and takes 1 point of

Constitution damage. As long as the

caster touches the subject once per

day, he gains the benefits and the sub-

ject takes the Constitution damage. If

the caster does not touch the subject

within 24 hours of the last time he

touched her, the spell ends.

Villains often use this spell on pris-

oners, who are sometimes sustained

by lesser restoration spells so they can

serve for years as evil sustenance.

Location Component: An area under

the effect of a desecrate or unhallow

Target: One astral creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell allows the caster to attract

and  capture  an  astral  creature,  as

someone using the astral projection

spell.  If  such  a  creature  is  within

range at the time of casting and fails

its  saving  throw,  it  is  brought

instantly before the caster and held

motionless and visible for the spells

duration.  Spellcasters  generally

follow snare astral traveler with a more

lasting restraint, such as trap the soul.

If more than one astral creature is

within range, the closest creature is

affected. If that creature makes its

saving throw, the next closest creature

must  make  a  save. This  continues

until one creature fails its save or all

have succeeded.

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster draws out the soul of a dead

creature and imprisons it within a

specially made talisman. The subject

must have had the talisman in his pos-

session when he died, or the spell

cannot function.

Henceforth, if the talisman is in the

casters possession, she can call forth

the soul of the subject and question it

about what it knew in life for up to 1

round/level  each  day,  asking  one

question per round. The soul looks as

it did in life, including the clothing

and equipment it had with it on the

day it died. Answers are clear, com-

plete, and precise.

If the subject is hostile, or if the

answer to the question was an impor-

tant secret to it in life, the subject

gains a Will saving throw. A success-

ful saving throw indicates that the

spell ends and the soul departs to the

afterlife.

Focus: The talisman that will be the

receptacle for the soul.

her maximum load. The caster can also

use the extra legs  to  climb  on  verti-

Steal Life

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living humanoid

Duration: Concentration

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The caster taps into the life force of a

subject and drains it away, adding it to

her own. Each round the caster con-

centrates, she deals 1 point of ability

score drain to the subject. Although

the caster can choose which ability

score to drain, she must choose a dif-

ferent ability score to drain in each

round  and  cannot  choose  a  score

already drained until she has drained

all the others equally, at which point

the process starts over. Thus, if the

caster drains 1 point of Strength, she

must choose another ability in the

next  round  and  cannot  choose

Strength again until she has drained 1

point each of Constitution, Dexterity,

Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

Then, the caster can drain a second

point of Strength (or any other abil-

ity),  but  not  a  third  until  she  has

drained a second point from all the

other ability scores.

If the caster casts this spell on the

night of a full moon, she becomes

effectively  one  week  younger  for

every point she drains. (Her age is

reduced, but memories and abilities

acquired during that week are not

lost.) Otherwise, the subject takes the

ability score drain, but the caster gains

nothing.

The subject withers and shrivels as

the caster drains its ability scores.

When  the  subjects  Constitution

score reaches 0, the subject becomes a

horrid, dry husk and cannot be fur-

ther drained. If the caster dies while

concentrating on this spell, all the

subjects lost ability score points are

immediately regained.

Location Component: An area under

points, then 9 hit points at the end of

this round. If someone immediately

more hit points, she stabilizes. Other-

wise, at the end of the next round, the

dies.

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell causes an undead creature

to  explode  in  a  burst  of  powerful

energy when struck for at least 1 point

of damage, or at a set time no longer

than  the  duration  of  the  spell,

whichever comes first. The explosion

is a 10-foot-radius burst that deals 1d6

points of damage for every two caster

levels (maximum 10d6).

While this spell can be an effective

form of attack against an undead crea-

ture, necromancers often use unliving

weapon to create undead capable of

suicide attacks (if such a term can be

applied to something that is already

dead). Skeletons or zombies with this

spell cast upon them can be very dan-

gerous to foes that would normally

disregard them.

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of

woven, spiked chains to spring into

being. This wall can be used to seal off

a passage or close a breach, for the

wall inserts itself into any surround-

ing nonliving material if its area is suf-

ficient to do so. The wall cannot be

conjured so that it occupies the same

space as a creature or another object.

It must always be a flat plane, though

the caster can shape its edges to fit the

available space.

A wall of chains is 1 inch thick per

four  caster  levels.  The  caster  can

double the walls area by halving its

thickness. Each 5-foot square of the

wall  has  20  hit  points  per  inch  of

The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of

living, glistening eyes of all different

sizes and types to spring into being.

This wall can be used to seal off a pas-

sage or close a breach, for the wall

inserts itself into any surrounding

nonliving material if its area is suffi-

cient to do so. The wall cannot be con-

jured so that it occupies the same

space as a creature or another object.

It must always be a flat plane, though

the caster can shape its edges to fit the

A wall of eyes is 1 inch thick

can  double  the  walls  area  by

halving its thickness. Each 5-

foot square of the wall has 10

hit points per inch of thickness

A section of wall brought to 0

hit points is breached. If a crea-

wall,  the  DC  for  the  Strength

check is 15 +2 per inch of thickness.

Any  creature  touching  the  wall

must succeed at a Will saving throw

or be held motionless as if affected by

a hold monster spell. The wall magically

consumes  held  creatures  after  10

rounds,  disintegrating  them  and

adding more eyes to its mass.

At  any  time,  from  any  distance

(even across planes), the caster can

take a standard action to look through

the wall of eyes, seeing in all directions

from the wall as if she were actually

standing there.

The caster causes a flat, vertical wall of

festering, stinking organic ooze to

bubble into being. This wall can be

used to seal off a passage or close a

breach, for the wall inserts itself into

any surrounding nonliving material if

its area is sufficient to do so. The wall

cannot be conjured so that it occupies

the  same  space  as  a  creature  or

another object. It must always be a flat

plane, though the caster can shape its

edges to fit the available space.

A wall of ooze is 1 inch thick per four

caster levels. The caster can double

the walls area by halving its thickness.

Each 5-foot square of the wall

has 50 hit points per inch of

thickness  and  hardness  0.

A section of wall brought to

0 hit points is breached. If

a  creature  tries  to  break

through the wall, the DC

for the Strength check is

15 +2 per inch of thickness.

Any creature touching the

wall takes 2d6 points of acid

damage per round from the

corrosive, burning nature

of the ooze. Only the sur-

rounding material that the

wall initially is conjured to

touchsuch as the floor

or  an  adjoining  wallis  im-

mune to this damage. Further-

more, a creature that touches the wall

must succeed at a Fortitude saving

EVIL MAGIC ITEMS

The forces of darkness are almost always well armed and

fiendishly equipped. The following sections detail magic

items of all varieties, with only their innate malevolence to

tie them together into a cohesive whole.

ARMOR SPECIAL ABILITIES

These armor special abilities are available in addition to the

special abilities given in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide and

other sources.

Darksoul Protection: This wearer of this armor, if of evil

alignment, takes only half damage from spells or effects that

cause greater damage to evil creatures, such as a holy smite

spell, the smite evil ability of a paladin, or the extra damage

dealt by a holy weapon.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, protection from good; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Demonmight Ward: This armor increases the wearers

enhancement bonus to Armor Class by +1 against attacks

from creatures of good alignment, or by +2 against attacks

from good outsiders. Furthermore, it provides a +1 bonus on

all saving throws against spells and spell-like effects from

good creatures, and a +2 bonus on saving throws against

spells with the good descriptor.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, dispel good, unheavened; Market Price: +2 bonus.

Poison Spike: This special ability is identical to mundane

armor spikes except that the spikes retract into hidden com-

partments in the armor. When they come out in response to

a command word, they deal 1d6 points of piercing damage

(just as normal armor spikes), and the spikes are coated with

a dose of a poison that deals 1d3 points of Strength damage

as both initial and secondary damage (Fort DC 16).

Fleshshifter Armor: Made from the skins of human-

oids, this +1 leather armor allows the wearer to produce an

effect identical to that of the alter self spell at will.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, alter self; Market Price: 13,160 gp.

Grim Defender: Once per day, the wearer of this +1

breastplate can transfer the damage dealt to him from a melee

attack to another creature, other than the attacker, within

100 feet. If the other creature succeeds at a Fortitude save

(DC 16), the creature takes no damage and the wearer of the

grim defender armor takes double damage.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, shield other; Market Price: 11,350 gp.

Razor Armor: Made of layers and layers of razor-sharp

scales, this +2 scale armor deals 2d6 points of slashing damage

with a successful grapple check and when the wearer is

grappling. The wearer is considered proficient with the

razors. Once per day, the wearer can spend a standard action

to launch up to six of the razor scales, which fly out from the

armor like +1 shuriken.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, magic weapon; Market Price: 5,600 gp.

WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITIES

These weapon special abilities are available in addition to

the special abilities given in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide and

other sources.

Bloodfeeding: Every time this weapon deals damage to a

creature with blood, it gains 1 blood point. When the

weapon has 5 blood points, it can deal an additional 1 point

of damage at the users behest (spending the blood points).

The weapon can store up to 50 blood points, allowing an

additional 10 points of damage, usable all at once or divided

up over a number of attacks.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, poison; Market Price: +1 bonus.

SPECIFIC ARMORS

The following specific armors and shields are usually pre-

constructed with exactly the qualities described here.

Armor of the Dread Emperor: This suit of +1 full plate

has four 5-foot chains connected to it at the waist. Each

chain has a ring manacle sized to fit around a humanoid

neck. If people are placed in these manacles by either the

armors wearer or his minions, the armor is ready to display

its true power. Whenever the wearer takes damage, the cap-

tives held by the chains take half the damage themselves. If

the chains hold more than one person, divide the half

damage among all of them. Operating in this armor with

chains attached to other people is difficult. The wearer takes

an additional 5 armor check penalty unless the victims are

somehow magically subdued or controlled, such as by stupor

or dominate person. If the captives are children, the additional

armor check penalty is only 2. If the captives are subdued

or controlled children, there is no additional armor check

penalty.

Armor, vampiric touch; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Cursespewing: Every time this weapon deals damage,

the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or be

affected by a curse that confers a 4 morale penalty on

attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, bestow curse; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Fleshgrinding: When this piercing or slashing melee

weapon deals damage to a living creature, the wielder may

command the weapon to grind as a free action. At that time,

the wielder lets go of the weapon and it continues, magically

animated, to grind itself into the foes flesh. Each round, it

deals damage as if the character who had been wielding it

had dealt a successful hit with it. The wielder need not con-

centrate or devote any time or attention to the weapon. The

original wielder can grab it at any time as a standard action.

The foe (or someone else) can attempt to rid herself of the

grinding weapon by making a Strength check (DC 20). If the

foe succeeds at the Strength check and has a free hand, she is

now holding the fleshgrinding weapon. In any event, the

fleshgrinding weapon stops grinding after 5 rounds.

Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, shield other; Market Price: 14,650 gp.

Armor, animate objects; Market Price: +2 bonus.

bard, belt hook, or other holder that is keyed to it in a special

way. At the command of the character wearing the scabbard,

the weapon attacks its current wielder with the scabbard

wearers attack bonus, and the wielder is considered flat-

footed (no sneak attack is possible, even if the scabbard

wearer is a rogue). If it hits, the masterslaying weapon deals

critical hit damage. This weapon is useful against rogues,

foes that enjoy disarming and grabbing weapons, and in

conjunction with the fleshgrinding ability.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, animate objects; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Souldrinking: This melee weapon bestows one negative

level each time it deals damage normally. When the wielder

scores a critical hit with the weapon, it bestows two negative

levels, and the wielder gains +1d8 temporary hit points and

a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. The temporary hit

points and enhancement bonus fade after 1 hour.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, energy drain; Market Price: +4 bonus.

additional 1 point of vile damage. If the weapon scores a crit-

ical hit, it deals 2 additional points of vile damage.

Armor, vile lance; Market Price: +1 bonus.

Armor, charnel fire; Market Price: 108,330 gp; Weight: 15 lb.

normal damage.

Arms and Armor, energy drain, gaseous form,

invisibility; Market Price: 2,560 gp.

Warpsword: This +2 greatsword infects

anyone it strikes with warp touch (see Dis-

eases in Chapter 2) if the target fails a Forti-

tude save (DC 14).

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic

Arms and Armor, contagion, cloak of chaos; Market

Price: 78,350 gp; Weight: 10 lb.

RINGS

Many powerful evil spellcasters manufacture sinister rings

for themselves or their dread minions.

Master Ring: The wearer of this iron ring, emblazoned

with the symbol of a brooding falcon, can deal 3d6 points of

damage per round as a free action to anyone wearing a slave

ring keyed to it. Furthermore, the wearer can exchange mes-

sages with anyone wearing a slave ring (as if using a sending

spell) three times per day. Typically, a master ring has ten

see below).

Ring of Weeping: This dull gray ring allows the wearer

to bestow weeping, crippling sadness by touch. A humanoid

touched by the wearer of a ring of weeping must succeed at a

Will save (DC 11) or be incapacitated for 1 round, then take

a 3 morale penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability

checks, and skill checks for 5 rounds. Each time the ring is

used to affect a creature, its wearer takes a 1 morale penalty

on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill

checks for 5 rounds.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, sorrow; Market

Price: 3,000 gp.

Slave Ring: This iron ring, once put on, cannot be

ing damage by the wearer of the master ring, and she can also

exchange messages with him.

small ruby. When worn, each melee attack made by the

Market Price: 20,000 gp.

Vile Spell Ring: If this ring is worn by a spell-

ball spell), each creature takes the vile damage.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, vile

lance; Market Price: 15,000 gp.

RODS

Among the greatest evil curiosities are

rods, many of whom exhibit their crafters

fiendish creativity.

Celestial Bane Rod: Deep blood red

in color, this metal rod is about 2 feet long

and topped with a curved spike. All celes-

tials within 60 feet of the rod take a 4

profane penalty on attack and damage

rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

There is no saving throw against this

effect,  nor  does  spell  resistance

apply.

Craft Rod, bestow curse, limited

wish, creator must be an evil

outsider;  Market  Price: 56,000  gp;

Weight: 3 lb.

acid arrow; Market Price: 54,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

113

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:14 AM  Page 114

Rod of Possession: This rod allows a willing user to draw

a fiend or malevolent ghost into himself for possession.

When the rod is activated, the wielder is automatically pos-

sessed by the nearest appropriate possessing creature, even

if the creature is unwilling. The identity and attitude of the

nearest spirit are often at the DMs discretion. This rod is fre-

quently used in unspeakable rituals of black magic.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, imprison soul, impo-

tent possessor; Market Price: 20,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Flesheater: This brown scepter is topped with a device

that looks like a tooth-filled mouth. Once per day, the

wielder can summon horrible little creatures of greenish

energy that look like minuscule imps or quasits. These crea-

tures tear at the flesh of one target, eating it as they swarm

around. The flesheaters are not actual creatures, but instead

magical effects. They can be dispelled, but not attacked;

attacks directed against them hit the rods target instead. The

target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) to resist the

flesheaters. If this save is failed, the target takes 3d6 points

of damage per round for 1d6+1 rounds.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Rod, summon monster

III; Market Price: 18,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

STAFFS

Staffs are receptacles for powerful evil magic, including

many of the spells described earlier in this chapter.

Staff of Corruption: This near-artifact level staff is

made of a thin, withered shaft of wood, sickly gray in

color. Worms appear to squirm about its surface, but that

is just an illusion. The staff allows the use of the following

spells.

Befoul (2 charges)

Despoil (2 charges)

Morality undone (1 charge, DC 16)

Shriveling (heightened to 6th level, 10d4 damage, DC 19)

shriveling, morality undone, wither limb; Market Price: 192,000

gp; Weight: 5 lb.

Staff of Darkness: It is said that this staff was first cre-

ated by a drow sorcerer deep in some forsaken Underdark

sanctum. A smooth shaft of surprisingly lightweight black

metal, this rather short staff allows the use of the following

spells.

Damning darkness (2 charges, DC 16)

Darkbolt (3d8 damage, DC 13) (1 charge)

Darkness (1 charge)

Deeper darkness (2 charges)

Pox (2 charges, DC 19)

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Staff, contagion, insect

WONDROUS ITEMS

Powerful evildoers have access to the following items, in

addition to the ones described in the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide and other sources.

Belt of the Dread Emperor: If a willing (or dominated or

helpless) humanoid creature is attached to the wearer of this

belt  by  a  chain  and  a  manacle  (see  armor  of  the  Dread

Emperor), the wearer can draw energy from that creature to

power spells. The belt of the Dread Emperor functions for all

spellcasters who prepare spells (including clerics, druids,

rangers, paladins, and wizards). The belt enables the wearer

to recall a prepared spell, even if the spell has already been

cast, as long as the spell was among those he most recently

prepared. For each spell recalled, the chained creature takes

damage equal to the square of the spells level: A recalled 1st-

level spell deals 1 point of damage, a 2nd-level spell deals 4

points, a 3rd-level spell deals 9 points, and so on, up to a 9th-

level spell that deals 81 points of damage. If the chained

creature does not have enough hit points left to power a

desired spell, the spell fails and the creature dies.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, cre-

ator must be able to cast 9th-level spells; Market Price:

120,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Collar of Venom: A creature wearing this heavy iron

collar gives all of its natural attacks an additional poison

attack (Fort DC 14) that deals 1d10 points of Constitution

damage as its initial and secondary damage.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poison;

Market Price: 50,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Collar of Virulent Venom: As a collar of venom (see

above), except that this collars poison is harder to resist

(Fort DC 20).

Caster Level: 18th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Heighten Spell, poison; Market Price: 138,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Dark Altar Stone: This piece of black granite, if used as

an altar or part of an altar, can be commanded to absorb the

soul of a victim sacrificed upon that altar. The soul is stored

as if in a gem as a part of a trap the soul spell. It can be called

forth and used in the various ways described in the Souls as

Power section of Chapter 2. A dark altar stone can store only

one soul at a time.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, trap

the soul; Market Price: 150,000 gp; Weight: 100 lb.

Elixir of the Dark Speech: This allows the imbiber to

speak and understand the Dark Speech as if he possessed the

feat of the same name. This elixir deals 1 point of Strength

damage when used. The speech effect lasts for 10 minutes.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, dread

word; Market Price: 750 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Fanatics Collar: When worn by a willing creature, this

spiked iron collar allows the wearer to choose another crea-

ture to dominate it, as the spell dominate monster.

Flesh Ring of Scorn: When this ring is pierced into the

flesh of an evil outsider, it allows the outsider to automati-

cally score a critical hit against a nonoutsider whenever the

threat of a critical hit is indicated.

Caster Level: 1st; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, corrupt

weapon; Market Price: 8,000 gp.

Gem of Psychic Poison: This gem, when in the posses-

sion of a creature, poisons that creature so that anyone cast-

ing a mind-affecting or divination spell at the creature is

affected with a psychic poison (see Chapter 3) that deals 1d6

points of Intelligence damage as both initial and secondary

damage.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

summon monster IX; Market Price: 28,500 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Nipple Clamp of Exquisite Pain: The wearer of this

ring is immune to debilitating pain effects such as the circle

of nausea spell. He is also immune to the wrack spell. He is

not immune to actual damage described as pain, such as that

found in eyes of the zombie, however. The clamp converts all

pain into a pleasurable sensation. This item does not change

how or whether the character takes damage, but it does

change how he might react to it.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poison

masochism; Market Price: 8,000 gp.

area; Market Price: 28,000 gp.

Heavens Thorn: Despite its sharp point, this dark green,

dagger-sized thorn makes a poor weapon because it is too

brittle and fragile. However, when it breaks against the flesh

of a good-aligned outsider (requiring a touch attack), it

releases terrible energy that stuns the target for 1d4 rounds

(no save, but spell resistance applies).

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, power

word stun, creator must be evil; Market Price: 4,550 gp; Weight:

1 lb.

Hook of Dissolution: This wicked metal hook is about 9

inches long. If thrust into a helpless opponent, that oppo-

nent slowly disintegrates over a period of 3 rounds (Fort DC

22 negates). This ability works on organic inanimate objects

as well as creatures. It can be used three times per day.

Caster Level: 15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, wall

of chains; Market Price: 14,400 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

Iron Maiden of Preservation: This coffinlike torture

device is filled with spikes that pierce the flesh of anyone

placed inside. It deals 1d6 points of damage per round to the

prisoner within. It also heals 1d6 points of damage per

round, however, but only if that damage was dealt by its own

spikes. Thus, the prisoner inside is not likely to die soon,

despite the constant pain and terrible wounds continually

being inflicted and then healed.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, heal;

Market Price: 7,000 gp; Weight: 550 lb.

Maggot Harvester: This 6-inch Vasharan orb appears to

be made from teeth and bones. When held above a rotting,

maggot-infested corpse for 1 round, it draws the maggots

into itself. The maggots can then be used to allow the

wielder to speak and understand the Dark Speech (see

Chapter 2) for 1 minute.

Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

tongues, creator must be evil; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight:

5 lb.

Necklace of Demons: This necklace has eight small

black spheres attached to it that can be easily removed (a

move-equivalent action). When removed from the necklace

and tossed upon the ground (or any hard surface), the

sphere shatters, summoning a demon that remains for 10

rounds. Different spheres summon different kinds of

Oil of the Lamia: Said to have been created by an evil

lamia wizard, this concoction makes magic items more pow-

erful. When applied to a magic item that produces an effect

requiring a foe to make a saving throw, the oil increases the

DC of the saving throw by +2 if the foe is of good alignment.

The oil lasts for 1 hour. The oil is held in a small flask and

will coat one item, no matter the size.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, dispel

evil; Market Price: 2,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Pain Extractor: This strange device consists of a flat

metal plate about 6 inches square lined with barbed hooks.

A thin, flexible tube extends from the plate to an adjustable

nozzle that could attach to a variety of flasks, bottles, or

other containers. Over the course of one day, this device can

extract pain in liquid form from a creature being tortured or

otherwise suffering terrible physical torment. This physical

manifestation of pain can be used to power magical items or

enhance spells (see Pain as Power in Chapter 2). It can also

be used as a potent drug.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, liquid

pain; Market Price: 64,000 gp; Weight: 3 lb.

Pipe of Grief: This long smoking pipe, when filled with

tobacco and lighted, can create a single 5-foot-radius cloud

that remains for 3d8 minutes, once per day. The cloud stays

in place for the duration unless acted on by a magical force

such as a gust of wind. Anyone within the cloud except the

user must succeed at a Will save (DC 17) or take a 4 morale

penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and abil-

ity checks for 10 rounds.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, wave of

grief; Market Price: 3,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Piercing Needles of Pain: These three needles must be

used together to gain any effect. If all three pierce the flesh

of a creature (each dealing 1 point of damage that cant be

healed until it is removed), the pained creature can give feel-

ings of intense pain to others by touch. The painful touch

produces the effect of a wrack spell (Fort DC 15 negates).

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, wrack;

Market Price: 35,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Psychic Poison Oil: Each type of psychic poison comes

in the form of an oil that can be sprinkled upon the creature,

object, or 25-foot-radius area to be poisoned.

Weight: 2 lb.

Quiver of Lies: This 3-inch-long quiver holds no arrows

or bolts. It fits around the wrist, like a bracelet. If the wearer

holds a bow or crossbow and speaks a lie, an arrow or bolt

(whichever is appropriate) appears in the wearers hand,

ready for use. The arrow or bolt only lasts for 10 rounds.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, minor

creation; Market Price: 12,000 gp. Weight: .

Rack of Irresistible Torture: This torture device, when

used on a victim, provides a +10 bonus on the Intimidate

check made by the torturer.

Caster Level: 1st; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, cause

fear; Market Price: 3,000 gp; Weight: 275 lb.

Skull of Fear: This ebony skull is fashioned so it can be

mounted on armor, a weapon haft, or a staff or pole. It gives

the wearer or wielder an aura of fear, so that anyone coming

within 10 feet is affected as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16

negates). The wearer or wielder can raise or lower the aura

with a command word.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, fear;

Market Price: 70,000 gp; Weight: 2 lb.

Slime Pot: This small black pot has a removable lid and

an iron handle. If the pot is filled with water and some

decaying organic matter (a dead rat, a severed hand, or

something of similar size) within 24 hours a patch of green

slime grows there. By carefully dumping out the contents of

the pot (a standard action), the slime pots owner can place

the patch of slime where she wants it. She has no special

control over or immunity to the slime, however.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

summon monster IV; Market Price: 11,200 gp; Weight: 5 lb.

Spiralburst Bottle: This is a sort of magic weapon con-

tained within a glass bottle until it is used. Opening or shat-

tering the bottle (often by throwing it like a flask of acid or

alchemists fire) unleashes the spiralburst. The spiralburst is

a portal to the Ethereal Plane that is only about 1/2 inch

wide. This portal has an almost limitless amount of pull,

sucking a single creature or object through the gate unless it

succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 30). If the bottle bursts

against something, the object it shatters against is the target.

If the bottle is opened, the opener is the target. The spiral-

burst only pulls up to 10 cubic feet through, so if the object

or creature is larger than that, only a portion of it is pulled

through.

The weapon gets its name because the target drawn

through the portal is sucked through in a spiral pattern. For

most living creatures, this is a blood-red spiral as their body

is liquefied into a spiral-shaped stream, then drawn through

the very small portal in a single round. Objects, unless they

are extraordinarily malleable, are destroyed. Creatures die

instantly unless they are amorphous (such as oozes). Even

objects and creatures that survive are lost on the Ethereal

Plane. The spiralburst disappears after a single use.

Caster Level: 20th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, sym-

pathy, gate; Market Price: 19,000 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

Symbol of Demogorgon: This unholy symbol, dedi-

cated to the Prince of Demons, is worn as an amulet. It pro-

vides a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and allows the

owner to cast rotting curse of Urfestra with no corruption cost.

The caster must still prepare the spell normally; if he does

not prepare spells, this aspect of the symbol cannot be used.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, rotting

curse of Urfestra; Market Price: 10,000 gp; Weight: .

Tongue Studs of Hell Breath: These golden studs,

pierced through the tongue, turn normal breath passing

over them into a 50-foot line of hellfire three times per day.

This hellfire deals 3d6 points of unholy (not fire) damage.

There is no saving throw.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, hellfire;

Market Price: 35,000 gp; Weight: .

Vasharan Offal Bag: This big burlap sack is filled with

dung that always remains fresh and odiferous. If someone

empties the bag, it loses all its power. Otherwise, a nonflying

giant cockroach (see Chapter 8) can be called out of the bag

once per day to serve the bag holder. The giant cockroach

remains for 1 hour or until killed. It obeys all verbal com-

mands of the bag owner, although it will not roam farther

than 100 feet from the bag. If it is forcibly moved farther, it

responds to no commands, although it will still disappear

after its hour is up. Unlike other vermin, a giant cockroach

brought forth from this bag understands Common and has

an Intelligence score of 3.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

summon monster II; Market Price: 3,000 gp. Weight: 10 lb.

Vasharan Worm Pod: This item is a 6-inch-long gray

seed pod. To get the Vasharan worm pod to function, it must

be forcibly inserted into a helpless characters stomach (a

standard action), dealing 3d6 points of damage to the char-

acter. For 2d10 days thereafter, gray-white worms grow

within the pod, feeding on the characters flesh, dealing 1d4

points of damage each day and creating specialized body

parts within the stomach lining. Once the worms are fully

grown, the character can mentally command the worms (a

full-round action) to snake a long, fleshy tube out of his

stomach and up into his nose. Thereafter, until the host of

the worm pod retracts the tube (a standard action), he can

command a worm to travel up the tube, into the nose,

through the nasal passage, and into his mouth. As a standard

action, up to three times per day, the character can spit a

worm up to 30 feet away, hitting a target with a successful

ranged touch attack. If a worm hits a living creature, it bur-

rows into the creatures body and into its vital organs. The

target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or die 1d4

rounds after the worm strikes. Even a target that succeeds at

its saving throw take 2d6 points of damage each round for

1d4 rounds, after which the worm dies. A remove disease or

heal spell kills the burrowing worm, stopping the damage

and the risk of death.

A creature with no discernible anatomy is immune to the

worms and cannot be the host of a Vasharan worm pod.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, slay

living, fabricate, animal growth; Market Price: 35,000 gp. Weight:

5 lb.

ARTIFACTS

The following evil artifactsminor and major, as well as the

special diabolic engines and demonic devicescan add a

definite evil flair to a high-level campaign.

MINOR ARTIFACTS

Though not the most powerful type of artifact, a minor arti-

fact nevertheless far outstrips an ordinary wondrous item.

Angel Blood: This fluid comes in a flask. It is not actually

a magic item (in that no one created it). It is really the blood

of a celestial, gathered and stored during a special ritual. The

liquid deals 5d6 points of acid damage when thrown as a

grenadelike weapon, but only against noncelestial creatures.

Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 1 lb. (including the flask).

Angel Tears: Hardened into tiny crystals, these tears, like

angel blood, were created by no spellcaster. Instead, they are

gathered from places where angels have felt sorrow or pain,

using some long-lost dark process. Evil creatures have

learned to make angel tears into hurled weapons such as

stones (they work well in slings, too). So cursed are such

things that they deal 3d6 points of damage to any creature

they break against, the target is automatically considered

exhausted, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving

throw (DC 18) or take 1d8 points of Strength drain.

Caster Level: 20th. Weight: 1/2 lb.

Demon Blood: When this dark blood, gathered using a

special process and an unholy ritual, is sprinkled over a 100-

foot-radius area, that area is treated as though affected by an

unhallow spell. Furthermore, nothing natural can grow in

the area ever again.

Caster Level: 20th. Weight: 1 lb. (including the flask).

Demonstone: This 2-inch-diameter dark rock is natu-

rally in the shape of a demonic creature with bat wings

folded around its body. It is semitranslucent with a dark

center that sometimes seems to move. Occasionally it seems

to whisper. If one listens closely, the whisper can be under-

stood, but it is a foul and evil entreaty to do some horrible

act. The owner immediately gains a +1 luck bonus on

attacks, damage, skill checks, and saving throws.

After one day of close proximity to the stone (within 5

feet), a character must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15)

or do as the stone compels and become chaotic evil in align-

ment. If the saving throw succeeds, further saves must be

made each day, with the DC increasing by +1 each time.

A character turned chaotic evil by a demonstone is particu-

larly despicable in his sadistic and horrible actions. Once

the character becomes chaotic evil (or if he was evil in the

first place), the stone need not remain in his possession for

him to gain the luck bonus. The bonus lasts until the brittle

stone is destroyed (hardness 4, 10 hp, break DC 24) or until

someone else succumbs to its temptation, failing the Will

save while in close proximity.

When a character who

was  turned  evil  by  a

demonstone loses her con-

nection with it (if it is

destroyed or gains a new

owner), the awareness of

her  evil  deeds  comes

back to her, and she is

usually thrown into deep

despair.

Caster Level: 20th.

Weight: 1/2 lb.

Devil  Blood: When

used  to  coat  a  blade,  this

black ichor acts as a poison

the next thirteen times the

weapon strikes. The poison

(Fort DC 20) deals 1d6 points

of Strength damage as initial

damage  and  2d6  points  of

Strength damage as secondary

damage.

Caster Level: 20th. Weight: 1 lb.

(including the flask).

Kython Armor: This armor looks

like a dead adult kython (see Chapter 8)

with only two arms. If a wearer crawls into

it, the armor fuses to him, although it can be

removed later. The armor is +3 full plate and

allows the wearer to use kython weapons as if he were a

kython. Furthermore, the armor allows the wearer to use its

claws (which deal 1d8 points of damage) as if they were nat-

ural weapons, and it adds a +10 bonus on any attempt to dis-

guise the wearer as an actual adult kython.

Caster Level: 16th; Weight: 50 lb.

Midnight Blade: This +5 bastard sword is unholy, flesh-

grinding and marrowcrushing, but only at night. During the

day it merely has a +5 enhancement bonus. Furthermore,

the Midnight Blade must be used to draw blood from at least

one creature of Medium-size or larger each night, or it loses

all abilities and becomes a 4 cursed bastard sword. Its abilities

can be recovered, but only if it is used to slay a Medium-size

or larger creature, at night, with the 4 penalty.

Caster Level: 15th; Weight: 10 lb.

Rhapsody of Pain: These oddly named earrings allow

the wearer to function as if continually under the effects of

both a sadism and a masochism spell. Furthermore, the

wearer is immune to the debilitating effects of pain, such

as those brought on by a symbol of pain, although she still

feels the pain.

Caster Level: 16th; Weight: .

Ring of the Dread Emperor: This black ring is made

from a single piece of obsidian and bears a gold inlay

design of chains. If a humanoid of at least 10th level is

killed on a given day by the wearer of this ring, the wearer

takes no penalties for wearing armor (no armor check

penalty, no maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, no

spell failure chance, and no reduced movement). The

wearer of the ring gains the

effect of a free action spell for

the next 24 hours.

Caster Level: 16th.

Weight: .

Staff  of  Malice: This

6-foot shaft of hardened black

wood gives off a dull red glow

the color of an old scab that shows

itself only in the light. Each tip of

the  staff  ends  in  a  metal  spear

point, and the staff of malice can be

used either as a +3 unholy quarterstaff

or a +3 unholy shortspear in combat.

Like all staffs, it has 50 charges,

which can be used to power the follow-

ing spells.

Bestow greater curse (1 charge,

DC 21)

Boneblast (1 charge, DC 16)

Destruction (1 charge, DC 21)

Pestilence (2 charges, DC 22)

Stop heart (1 charge, DC 18)

Wrack (1 charge, DC 17)

Wretched blight (15d8 damage,

DC 23) (2 charges)

When  the  charges  are

all  gone,  the  staff  disap-

pears, only to reappear fully

charged  somewhere  else  in  the

multiverse.

QH/JE

Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 5 lb.

Vasharan Crossbow: This +4 heavy crossbow can be loaded

and fired as quickly as a light crossbow can. Any bolt that it

fires is automatically treated as a bolt of slaying humans (as an

arrow of slaying)

Caster Level: 17th; Weight: 4 lb.

DIABOLIC ENGINES AND DEMONIC

DEVICES

This special category of minor artifacts includes any of a

number of machines created on the Lower Planes (see Chap-

ter 7). Pain, souls, or both power these devices (see Souls as

Power and Pain as Power in Chapter 2).

Cauldron of Zombie Spewing: The devils that created this

device wanted to mass-produce undead. This artifact is a mass

of strange tubes, bubbling glass containers, and liquid-filled

troughs all focused around a gigantic black cauldron 13 feet in

diameter. When fifty Medium-size

corpses are thrown into the device

and mixed with strange chemi-

cals and a single dose of liquid

pain, the contents of the caul-

dron stew and boil for 24 hours.

Then, great horizontally pivot-

ing levers spew forth onto the

ground  4d12  Medium-size

zombies. Not every corpse be-

comes a zombie because some

are liquefied and mulched as a

part of the process. The zombies

obey the commands of any devil

present within the first 3 rounds of

their creation.

The cauldron has hardness 10, 250

hp, and a break DC of 35. However, the glass por-

tions and tubing can be destroyed much more

easily (hardness 1, 20 hp, break DC 12).

Caster Level: 16th; Weight: 5,000 lb.

Demonic Graft Machine: This machine is a

mass of metal tubes, gears, arms, and wheels

that turn and move silently. At the front of this

machine, a wide iron plate fashioned into the

form of a hideous face grins with a wide, open

mouth. Through the mouth, the innards of the

device are visible. The device is part machine

and  part  demon,  infused  with  fiendish

essence and powered by evil magic. It is used

to graft demonic additions onto the bodies of

willing or unwilling victims.

Anyone that comes within 5 feet of the

open mouth must succeed at a Reflex save

(DC 15) or be grabbed by a tonguelike

a p p e n d a g e   a n d   d r a g g e d   i nt o   t he

machine.

Within the bowels of the machine,

the  victims  body  is  sliced,

burned,  punctured,  and

torn.  These  operations

deal  6d6  points  of

damage to the victim

in  1  round.  In  the

next  round  (if  the

character  is  still

alive), demonic flesh

and essence is added to

the victims body,

restoring  5d6

points of damage.

On the third round,

the character is spit

out with a new

demonic addi-

tion  in  place

(roll  on  the  fol-

lowing table).

Demonic Addition

Left arm. The arm is long and flexible like a tendril, with a

crude, three-fingered claw at the end. It functions as a natu-

ral weapon dealing 1d4 points of damage plus the charac-

ters Strength bonus. Weapons used in the hand take a 2

penalty on attacks. Once per day, the arm can produce

magic missile as the spell from a 5th-level caster.

Right arm. The arm is muscular and sinewy, with a clawed

hand. The arm confers a +2 inherent bonus to Strength. As

a natural weapon, the arm deals 1d6 points of damage plus

the characters Strength bonus.

Thick and muscular legs. The character gains a +2 bonus to

his Constitution score.

Slim and agile legs. This addition increases the characters

speed by 10 feet when not wearing heavy armor or carrying a

heavy load. The character gains a +5 competence bonus on

Climb and Jump checks.

Familiar. Grafted onto the shoulder, back, stomach or hand,

a demonic familiar is a small face with an evil expression.

This face has Intelligence 12, Wisdom 9, and Charisma 6. If

the character is a wizard, the face can teach him one new

spell for every spell level he knows. If the character is a spell-

caster, the familiar povides a +2 inherent bonus to the ability

score that determines his bonus spells.

Good-aligned characters with a demonic addition must suc-

ceed at a Will save (DC 15) every day or take 1d3 points of

Wisdom damage as the experience slowly drives them mad.

Characters of a nonevil alignment must succeed at a Will

save (DC 15) each day or succumb to temptation and per-

form an evil act chosen by the DM. This may eventually

result in an alignment change.

When characters with demonic additions deal with

nonevil NPCs, they take a 6 circumstance penalty on all

Charisma-based checks, such as Diplomacy and Bluff.

The machine does not take a character more than once.

Removing a demonic addition requires severing the limb

and taking 6d6 points of damage. To regrow the original

limb requires a regenerate spell.

The Demonic Graft Machine has hardness 10, 200 hp, and a

break DC of 35. A victim inside the machine can make an

attack with a light weapon, or he can cast spells if he suc-

ceeds at a Concentration check based on the damage he has

taken. The machine can take two victims at a time, but only

victims of Large or smaller size. Each demonic addition

requires a soul fed into the machine.

Caster Level: 18th; Weight: 2,500 lb.

Pain Pit: A metal cauldron 10 feet across and 20 feet deep

containing several giant leeches, this device is one of biolog-

ical engineering. A creation of the neutral evil fiends known

as yugoloths, the Pain Pit efficiently extracts liquid pain

from its victims. The pit can hold up to five Medium-size or

smaller creatures.

The yugoloths throw victims into the pit, where foot-long

leeches (treat as Tiny monstrous centipedes) attach to them,

inflicting great pain and draining pain from them in liquid

form. A thin umbilical cord connects each leech to a storage

vat along the side of the cylinder. Each leech extracts one

dose of liquid pain from a victim over the course of a day,

then sends it along the tube to the storage vat, which has a

capacity of one hundred doses. Once the liquid pain has

been extracted and delivered, the leeches consume the vic-

tims. Two ladders lead up to the rim of the cauldron, and a 1-

foot-wide walkway surrounds the perimeter at the top. A

single dose of pain must be poured into the pit at the begin-

ning of a day to get the leeches started.

The cylinder itself has hardness 10, 300 hp, and a break

DC of 35. The storage vat can be destroyed more easily

(hardness 1, 30 hp, break DC 15).

Caster Level: 20th; Weight: 8,000 lb.

MAJOR ARTIFACTS

These are the most powerful items of evil anywhere in the

cosmos.

Angelwing Razor: This long, thin blade is not made from

angels wings; rather, it was honed on themon the wings

of dead and captive celestials. This hideous process, con-

ducted by the elf warlord Urgatil before going into battle

against the gold dragon armies, sharpened the blade to an

impossibly fine edge. Angelwing Razor is a +5 vorpal longsword

that ignores damage reduction and hardness of any kind. It

can even cut through a wall of force or similar effect.

Death Rock: This object is said to be the heart of an evil

demon lord or evil demigod, cut from his chest in a terrible

battle with a woman invested with celestial powers who

sought vengeance for the wrongs of the evil being and its

cult. The Death Rock is a crude black stone the size of a fist

that pulses like a beating heart.

Anyone possessing the Death Rock gains the spellcasting

abilities of a sorcerer of a level equal to his own. The charac-

ter knows only spells of the Necromancy school. If the char-

acter is already a sorcerer, the new spells known and extra

spells per day are in addition to his own.

The Death Rock has a drawback. Once per week, the clos-

est companion or dearest loved one of the Death Rocks

owner is automatically slain and turned into a zombie that

serves the owner. The owner may forsake the Death Rock to

prevent this (or he might run out of companions or loved

ones), but then the Death Rock immediately fades away.

Despoiler of Flesh: This short staff is made of human

tongues sewn together end to end. These tongues are slightly

animated, so the staff occasionally bends and curls of its own

volition. Despoiler of Flesh has been in the possession of a par-

ticularly twisted and powerful nalfeshnee named Tapheon

that lives in a place called the Fortress of Indifference. It has

also been in the hands of a mortal despot named Multheasan,

a human in love with his two daughters. Rather than force

himself upon them, he used the Despoiler of Flesh to reshape

captives and slaves into the likenesses of his daughters so

that he might have his way with them instead.

The artifact allows the wielder to reshape the flesh of any

creature, as with a polymorph other spell except that any

shape  that  the  wielder  can  imagine  can  be  bestowed,

whether a creature actually exists in that form or not. If a

form is bestowed that is unwieldy or untenable, or that was

created without careful forethought, the creature simply

dies. For example, the wielder could change the form of a

wolf into that of a human known to him. He could then

(using the Despoiler of Flesh again) give that human purplish

black skin and tentacles for arms. If he attempted to also

give the victim six spider legs and batlike wings large

enough to carry him aloft, the form would simply collapse

under its own weight into a pile of fleshy goo.

Victims may resist the effect of the artifact with a Forti-

tude save (DC 25). The wielder can make one change per

round, with a victim getting a save to resist each change.

Turning a creature into an existing kind of creature (as

described  in  the  polymorph  other spell)  counts  as  one

change. Systematically adding or removing body parts

counts as one change per addition or removal, unless multi-

ple identical changes are made (such as removing both of

an ogres hands or turning all of a dragons teeth into short,

stubby toes).

Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless: Tuerny the Mer-

ciless was a powerful spellcaster who killed the royal

family of an ancient land to gain control of

the kingdom. He enslaved the consider-

able army of the land, then went to war

with  neighboring  lands.  Tuerny

began to summon demons, but he

lacked the ability to control them.

The fiends ravaged the country-

side and threatened his king-

dom, so Tuerny fashioned

a  device that w o u l d

i m prison and con-

trol  t h e m .   H i s

plan  worked,

and with the

device Tuer-

nys  might  grew

even greater, until

one day the demons

within the flask broke free and claimed his soul.

The Iron Flask is very small and plain, although the stop-

per is engraved and embossed with runes of power. It holds

1d4 demons within it when first found. Roll on the follow-

When the Iron Flask is unstoppered, the owner can com-

mand one of the demons to come out for up to 8 hours or

until slain (at which point the demon goes back into the

flask). During its time of freedom, the owner of the flask

controls all actions of the demon. No demon can be called

forth more than once per week.

More demons can be added to the flask. The target

demon must be within 30 feet, and the owner of the flask

must speak a command word (a standard action) to attempt

to imprison it. To overcome the spell resistance of the

demon (if any), the owner can make a check using the

caster level of the flask (30th). Then the demon must suc-

ceed at a Will save (DC 20) or be sucked into the flask. The

Iron Flask holds up to one hundred demons. Whenever a

new demon is imprisoned, the flask must be unstoppered,

and 1d4 other demons attempt to escape from the flask. To

thwart each attempted escape, the flasks owner must suc-

ceed at a Will saving throw (DC 20 +1 per demon in the

flask). If a demon escapes, it turns on the flasks owner and

attempts to slay him.

Each time a demon is called from the flask, the owner

must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 20 +1 per previous

save against the flask +1 per demon in the flask) or become

chaotic evil. Furthermore, each time he must also succeed at

a caster level check using the flasks caster level of 30th

(DC 10  +1  per  previous  save

against  the  flask  +1

per demon in the

flask),  or  the  de-

mon called is freed

and turns upon the

owner  of  the  flask.

If the demons from the

flask  ever  slay  the  owner,

they immediately steal his

soul and take it to the Abyss

to become a larva.

The Ruby Rod of Asmo-

deus:  This  scepter  glistens

with an unimaginable, unearthly

luster. Some claim that in just gem value

alone, the rod is worth more than one million

gold pieces. It is, however, also a formidable

weapon of evil. If used in melee, it is a +6 unholy

greatclub that bestows an inflict critical wounds spell

(cast at 20th level) upon anyone it touches (Will DC 19

half ). Anyone that touches the rod against Asmodeuss will

feels the effect of the inflict critical wounds spell as well.

Weapons with a +6 enhancement bonus are beyond the ken

of most item creators, but they otherwise follow all the rules

for magic weapons.

The Ruby Rod also has a number of supernatural abilities,

which function as the spells cast by a 20th-level caster. The

following abilities are usable at will by Asmodeus, and once

per day by anyone else.

Line of Lightning: 150 feet long, 10 feet wide, deals 20d6

points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 23 half ).

Line of Acid: 300 feet long, 5 feet wide, deals 20d6 points of

acid damage (Reflex DC 23 half ).

Cone of Cold: 75 feet long, deals 20d6 points of cold

damage (Reflex DC 23 half ).

Aura of Might: Anyone attempting to make a melee attack

against the wielder must succeed at a Will save (DC 20) or

instead bow down, helpless for 1 round.

Reverie of Nessus: When this ability is activated, the wielder

is instantly encased in a 5-foot-radius spherical wall of

force, and the area 50 feet around the sphere (but not

within it) becomes an antimagic field. This effect lasts for 3

rounds. In the first round, the wielder is automatically

purged of any unwanted enchantments. In the second

round, the wielder is purged of any diseases, poisons, or

physical maladies (including lost body parts). In the third

round, the wielder is healed to full hit points and feels as

though he just rested a full day, regaining spells and spell-

like abilities accordingly (but even Asmodeus can only

gain the benefit of this magical rest once per day).

The Wand of Orcus: This black obsidian and iron rod is

topped with the skull of a human hero slain by Orcus. If

wielded in melee, it is a +6 unholy chaotic heavy mace. If the

wand touches any nonoutsider, or an outsider with less than

15 HD, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 25)

or die immediately. Anyone that touches the wand against

Orcuss will must save or die as well. Weapons with a +6

enhancement bonus are beyond the ken of most item cre-

ators, but they otherwise follow all the rules for magic

weapons.

The wand also confers a +5 deflection bonus to the Armor

Class of the wielder at all times. Finally, the wielder can call

upon each of the following powers once per day, as the

spells cast by a 20th-level caster: abyssal might, bodak birth, call

nightmare, clutch of Orcus (DC 18), summon monster VII, wrack

(DC 18), and wretched blight (15d8 damage, DC 23).

The Regalia of Evil

These three separate artifacts possess great powerand

even greater power when used together. In eons long past,

before humanity was born and perhaps before the world

was forged, the gods of darkness and corruption worked

together to outfit a champion to pit against the gods of light

and the lords of balance. Since this time, champions of evil

have used the Regalia of Evil whenever a dispute needed to

be settled against a similarly equipped champion of good or

neutrality (each faction having its own regalia).

It may be that today these contests of champions no

longer occur, and the individual items of the regalia have

fallen into mortal hands. Still, the gods of evil occasionally

check on the devices that they created so long ago. It has

been millennia since all three items of the Regalia of Evil

were used by a single being.

The Crown of Evil: This iron crown is crude and rough,

fashioned to look like black flames wreathing the head of

the wearer. When an evil creature puts on the crown, its

head is surrounded by reddish-black fire. These flames con-

ceal the wearers face. The wearer gains fire immunity, a +4

enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 deflection bonus to

Armor Class, and spell resistance 20. It can use unnerving

gaze at will as a spell-like ability, and it can use the following

spell-like abilities three times per day: create undead, hellfire,

and wall of fire. All spell-like abilities are at 20th caster level.

The wearer can speak only lies while wearing the crown, so

usually the wearer of the crown doesnt speak.

The Scepter of Evil: This rod is made of iron and draped

in chains. A dark red flame is always lit at one end, but it

gives off no heat. While in a characters possession, the

scepter confers a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. The

wielder can use each of the following spell-like abilities

three times per day: fear (DC 19), corrupt fireball (DC 18), red

fester (DC 18), and power leech (DC 20). All spell-like abilities

are at 20th caster level. The owner of this device slowly

becomes more and more egotistical.

The Orb of Evil: This 6-inch-diameter orb is made of

pitted and scarred iron. Red sparks fly from the orb at the

slightest touch. The wielder can rebuke and command

undead as a 15th-level cleric can. While in a characters pos-

session,  the  orb  confers  a  +4  enhancement  bonus  to

Wisdom. Furthermore, the orb can absorb spells as a rod of

absorption can. The owner slowly grows greedier over time.

The Regalia of Evil has greater powers, called resonating

effects, if the same creature owns more than one of the

items.

Two Items: When a single creature possesses two items of

the Regalia of Evil, it gains the effects of the Lichloved, Dark

Speech, Evil Brand, and Verminfriend feats. Save DCs on all

evil spells and spell-like abilities of the creature (including

those from the Regalia) are increased by +2.

Three Items: When a single creature possesses all three

items of the Regalia of Evil, it gains a +4 enhancement bonus

to Constitution, Dexterity, and Intelligence. All weapon

damage dealt by the wielder is vile damage.

A nonevil character attempting to use any of the items

that comprise the Regalia of Evil immediately takes 5d6

points of damage. Furthermore, a good-aligned character

attempting to use one of these items must succeed at a Will

saving throw (DC 18) or lose 2,000 XP.

he demons and devils of the evil-aligned Outer

Planes are ruled by singular beings of great power.

Although similarities exist among the demon lords and

archdevils that rule the Abyss and the Nine Hells

respectively, there are also many differences. The arch-

fiends vary greatly in power, although each is terrifyingly

mighty by mortal standards. Some are worshiped as gods

by mortal cults, while others wait in the shadows for an

opportune time to strike, increasing their own power.

Each of these incredibly evil beings is presented along

with sample followers and allies that you can use in your

own adventures. This chapter also includes an overview

of what the archfiends temples and mortal servants are

like.  Now  you  can  pit  your  characters  against  such

dreaded foes as the priests of Demogorgon or the cultists

of Baalzebul. Each archfiends most powerful or unusual

servants are described as well. If player characters even-

tually challenge these powerful fiends, the DM knows

what sort of beings each archdevil or demon lord sur-

rounds itself with. Encounters with these servants can

give characters a taste of the power and corruption that

the demon lords and archdevils wield, rather than forc-

ing the player characters into what may be a very brief

fight with an archfiend. Conversely, if your high-level

characters are itching to take on Orcus, theyll find him a

formidable foe indeed.

ARCHFIENDS AND CLERICS

The demon lords and archdevils described in this

chapter cannot grant spells to clerics. Instead, they

act as patrons for clerics who devote themselves to

abstract sources of divine power, and they assist the

clerics of evil gods. They have worshipers who per-

form sacrifices in their name, but they dont run

organized religions the way gods do.

If you want the demon lords and archdevils to

have organized faiths and grant spells, its easy to

do so. Chapter 6 identifies which domains each

archfiend would be associated with (see the Cleric

Domains section in the spell lists). If you have the

Deities and Demigods book, you can give each

demon lord and archdevil divine rank 1 and

adjust their statistics accordingly. This divine

rank will give them maximum hit points for

each Hit Die; more spell-like abilities; some

extra immunities and sensory abilities; a +1

bonus to Armor Class, attacks, saving throws,

skill checks, and ability checks; and a scatter-

ing of other divine abilities. In practical terms,

the demon lords and archdevils are powerful

enough already that giving them a divine rank

doesnt make a huge difference.

THE LOWER PLANES

The Lower Planes, also known as the evil-aligned Outer

Planes or the Nether Planes, are the extradimensional

realms of evil. This is where the fiendschaotic evil

demons, lawful evil devils, neutral evil yugoloths, and

other horrorsall originate. This is where the souls of the

damned are taken to face torment. These planes are where

the gods of evil dwell.

Fiend Types: Demon is a general term for anything

native to the Abyss, while tanarri is the name of a specific

grouping of demons, including succubi, vrocks, hezrous,

glabrezu, nalfeshnees, mariliths, balors, and others. Simi-

larly, baatezu refers to a specific group of devils, includ-

ing lemures, osyluths, barbazu, erinyes, hamatulas, cornu-

gons, gelugons, and the massively powerful pit fiends.

Devil is a more general term used for any inhabitant of

the Nine Hells. Finally, many neutral evil fiends call them-

selves yugoloths.

In the D&D cosmology, the Lower Planes consist of

Pandemonium, the Abyss, Carceri, Hades, Gehenna, the

Nine Hells, and Acheron. The River Styx joins all of these

dismal planes, as do many magic portals. The inhabitants

frequently travel from one plane to another.

Pandemonium is more chaotic than evil, bordering

Limbo (the plane of ultimate chaos) and the Abyss. Howl-

ing winds blow forever through a maze of caverns, render-

ing virtually everyone on this plane completely mad.

Howlers, tortured spirits, and demons can all be found on

this plane.

The infinitely deep Abyss is the realm of both chaos and

evilthe primary demesne of demons. Each of its infinite

layers holds a different sort of inhospitable environ-

mentswamps of fire, mountains of ice, crushing caverns,

and empty voids. Many demon lords control an entire

layer or even multiple layers. Evil gods also control their

own layers. Aside from the omnipresent tanarri, bodaks,

bebiliths, nightmares, undead, and the occasional night

hag make their homes here.

Carceri is a plane of imprisonment. Thus, most of its

inhabitants are not natives, but creatures that have been

banished to the plane.

Neither lawful nor chaotic, the Gray Waste of Hades is a

dismal place of apathy and despair. The plane itself drains

hope from those that visit it. Night hags and yugoloths are

common here, but so are demons and devils. This is where

the night hags peddle their waresthe larval souls of the

damnedto interested natives of the Lower Planes.

Gehenna is a fiery plane that is now the home of the

yugoloths, although many yugoloths can still be found in

their original home of Hades. There are no level surfaces

here, since the plane is really a series of volcanoes.

The Nine Hells, also called Baator by some, is home to

the devils. Ostensibly run by the archdevils, it is also the

abode of evil gods. The planes nine layers are all danger-

ous, each deeper one more deadly than the last. Hell

hounds, fiendish fire giants, undead, kytons, and other

horrors roam here in well-organized but oppressive cities

of iron and chains. This is where the baatezu rule.

Acheron is a strange plane of cubelike masses that crash

together. It is a place of constant war, inhabited by hordes of

goblinoids as well as devils, achaierais, rakshasas, and worse.

THE BLOOD WAR

The demons and the devils have long engaged in a war for

control of the Lower Planes. This is a battle of law versus

chaos, and it serves as a distraction for the unaging fiends

that live in the Lower Planes. The demons of the Abyss

marshal armies of almost infinite size and throw them-

selves against the well-organized (but smaller) ranks of

the devils. Yugoloths and other creatures serve on either

side as mercenaries.

The Blood War is fought on and near the river Styx,

across the Field of Nettles in Hades, and even into the

heart of the Abyss and the deepest pits of the Nine Hells.

Occasionally, the conflict even spills onto the Material

Plane, endangering mortals and threatening destruction

on a scale virtually unknown on peaceful worlds.

As vast as the scope of this cosmic war is, most fiends

still devote most of their attention to capturing the hearts

and souls of mortal creatures and sowing depravity, destruc-

tion, and all the unspeakable things that enter into the mind

of a fiend. Will the fiends ever annihilate each other? Mortal

creatures will never be so lucky.

pqqqqrs

EVIL PLANE VARIANTS

Of course, you could develop your own cosmology. You could

take out the in between planes and just have the Nine Hells,

the  Abyss,  and  Hades.  Or  perhaps  there  is  only  one  Lower

Plane. Just called Hell, this dismal plane is home to demons

and  devils  and  all  manner  of  fiends.  In  such  a  setup,  there

might not even be a distinction between demons and devils, so

that the words are merely synonyms.

Or perhaps there is a plane of law and a plane of chaos, and

each  of  them  has  a  dark,  bottomless  pit  in  its  lower  reaches

where the fiends livedevils in the plane of law and demons

in the plane of chaos.

Another  possibility  is  that  there  are  an  infinite  number  of

Hells, each more horrible than the last. Each is perhaps home

to  its  own  archduke  or  prince,  some  leaning  toward  law  and

the other chaos. Or perhaps law and chaos do not even matter

to creatures of such unsurpassed evil.

THE DEMON LORDS

Individual demons have, over the course of millennia, risen

from the hordes of their brethren. They gained great power

and authority, then established themselves as demon lords.

Each has an appearance and a set of abilities unique to him

or her. A few demon lords have even risen above the other

demon lords, calling themselves demon princes.

These are all self-proclaimed titles. There are no actual

qualifications; the Abyss is far too chaotic to develop rigid

standards. It is this chaos and lack of organization and hier-

archy that separates the demon lords from the archdevils,

who have a rigid pecking order, each paying fealty to those

in more powerful positions.

Almost every demon lord controls at least one layer of the

Abyss. The lords command palaces and fortresses full of

lesser demons and monsters, often decorated with tortured

prisoners or tormented, damned souls.

The demon lords relish pain and suffering as much as

they lust for power. They savor corruption and destruction,

waging eternal wars with each other to gain dominance. For

many years, Demogorgon has been the most powerful

demon lord, calling himself Prince of Demons. Both Orcus

and Grazzt contest this title, however.

Many demon lords, and all demon princes, have a scatter-

ing of mortal worshipers gathered in secret cults. These

demon cultists may one day, through their sacrifices and

devotion, elevate the lords to true godhood, a title that many

of the lords have claimed at one time or another.

Countless other demon lords exist beyond those described

here, including Fraz Urblu, Kostchtchie, Baphomet, Alzrius,

Eldanoth, Lissaaera, Lupercio, Lynkhab, Verin, and Vucarik.

ARCHFIEND DAMAGE REDUCTION

Many of the demon lords and archdevils have damage reduc-

this  damage  reduction,  but  high-level  characters  wielding  +5

greatswords  can  certainly  deal  more  than  15  or  20  points  of

Because they have such high damage reduction, archfiends

natural weapons can overcome the damage reduction of lesser

Advancement: 

The 88th layer of the Abyss, called the Brine Flats by some

and Gaping Maw by others, is home to the dual entity

known as Demogorgon. It is a realm of salt water and rocky

prominences used as rookeries by flying demons. A swirling

whirlpool drains water from the river Styx into this Abyssal

layer, making it a place of both deep and dark seas as well as

fetid swamps. Aboleths, krakens, and other sea monsters

war in the depths, but all bow before Demogorgons might.

Here, Demogorgon has his terrible palace, called Abysm,

which rises out of the inky depths. He also a maintains a

fortress called Ungorth Reddik in the layers grotesque bogs.

From either of these places of dark power, Demogorgon,

Lord of all that Swims in Darkness, holds the title Prince of

Demons through sheer might alone. In both physical and

magical terms, there are few on any plane that could chal-

lenge Demogorgon and win.

But that does not mean his title is uncontested. Demo-

gorgon continually wars with both Orcus and Grazzt, the

other two mightiest of the demon princes. Their armies of

undead and demons war with Demogorgons forces, made

up mostly of hezrous, aboleths, scrags, skum, and various

ichythoid beasts.

The portion of the palace of Abysm that lies above water

takes the form of two serpentine towers, each crowned by

skull-shaped minarets. There, Demogorgon labors with

arcane skill, attempting to procure secrets ancient even by

his eternal reckoning. The bulk of this palace extends deep

underwater, in chill and darkened caverns that have never

seen a flicker of light. In Ungorth Reddik, Demogorgon

keeps his armies and lieutenants, as well as his fiendish cre-

ations. The fortress is filled with retrievers, golems, and evil

constructs not seen elsewhere on the planes.

Demogorgon is 18 feet tall and bizarre in appearance even

by demonic standards. He has two heads, each like that of a

hyena. His body is long and serpentine, covered in dark,

blue-green scales. His necks are long and snaky. Rather than

arms, Demogorgon has two long, sinuous tendrils not

unlike the tentacles of an octopus. His legs are lean and

muscular, and his long tail is forked.

Demogorgons symbol is a serpentine forked tail, usually

wrapped around something such as a sword or a skull.

Combat

Demogorgon  disdains  direct  confrontation.  He

would rather employ servants or lieutenants,

of which he has many. Powerful balors and

hezrous twice the size seen elsewhere serve

the Prince of Demons as impor-

tant enforcers, bodyguards,

and assassins. If Demo-

gorgon  must  fight,  he

leads with his strength,

using  two  gaze  attacks  in

conjunction with his terrible

rotting tentacles (saving the hypno-

sis gaze for when he fights large numbers of

weak foes). He often goes into combat with

these abilities active: fly, tongues, unholy aura (+4

additional bonus to AC, +4 bonus on

saves), and detect thoughts.

Energy  Drain  (Su): Any

living creature hit by Demo-

gorgons tail slap attack gains

1d4 negative levels. For each

negative  level  bestowed,

Demogorgon heals 5 points

of damage. If the amount of

healing  is  more  than  the

damage he has taken, he gains

any  excess  as  temporary  hit

points. If the negative level has not

been    removed  (with  a  spell

such as restoration) before

24 hours have passed, the

afflicted opponent

must  succeed

at a Fortitude

save (DC 39)

to remove it.

Failure means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced

by one.

Gaze Attacks (Su): Each of Demogorgons heads has its

own gaze attack, and the demon can use a third gaze attack

involving both heads at the same time.

Aameuls Beguiling Gaze: The beguiling gaze attack of

Aameul, Demogorgons left head, is the equivalent of a

charm monster spell (Will DC 39 negates) with a range of 60

feet. If the demon prince chooses not to use his hypnosis

gaze, he may use this attack and his insanity gaze attack at

the same time, or this gaze attack and a spell-like ability.

Either way, Demogorgon can use gaze attacks and make

physical attacks as part of a single action.

Hethradiahs Insanity Gaze: The insanity gaze attack of

Hethradiah, Demogorgons right head, is equivalent to an

insanity spell (Will DC 39 negates) with a range of 30 feet. If

the demon prince chooses not to use his hypnosis gaze abil-

ity, he may use this and his beguiling gaze attack at the same

time, or this gaze attack and a spell-like ability. Either way,

Demogorgon can use gaze attacks and make physical attacks

as part of a single action.

Hypnosis Gaze: If Demogorgon locks the gazes of both

heads upon a single target within 100 feet, that creature

is affected as though by a hypnotism spell. Only a

target with 15 Hit Dice or more is allowed a

Will saving throw (DC 39) to resist the effect.

Demogorgon can make physical attacks while

using this gaze attack, but he cannot activate spell-

like abilities.

Rot (Su): Any living creature touched by Demogor-

gons tentacles must succeed at a Fortitude save

(DC 39), or its flesh and bones begin to rot.

The creature takes 1d6 points of

Constitution damage immedi-

ately and 1 point of Constitution

damage every hour thereafter

until  it  dies  or  a  remove  disease

spell is cast. The spell stops further

damage, but lost points return

only with natural healing and

cannot  be  restored

with magic.

rape, shapechange. Caster level 20th; save DC 20 + spell level.

Dual Actions (Ex): Demogorgon, having two heads with

distinct intelligences and personalities, can take two rounds

worth of actions in any given round, as if he were two crea-

tures. Thus, he can use a full attack action and a double

move; two full attack actions and two 5-foot steps; a full

attack action, a move action and a spell-like ability; two

spell-like abilities and two move actions; and so on.

Fast Healing (Ex): Demogorgon regains lost hit points

at the rate of 10 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow Demogorgon to regrow or reattach lost

body parts.

Item Master (Ex): Although not an actual spellcaster,

Demogorgon can use any magic item, even spell completion

items such as wands and scrolls. He can also create any item

or construct as though he had the necessary feats and pre-

requisite spells or other requirements.

Mage  Armor  (Su):  Demogorgon  is  constantly  sur-

rounded by an aura of force that provides armor protection,

identical to a mage armor spell that cannot be dispelled.

Outsider Traits: Demogorgon has darkvision (60-foot

range). He cannot be raised or resurrected.

See Invisibility (Su): Invisible creatures and objects are

always visible to Demogorgon, as if he always had the see

invisibility spell active.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day Demogorgon can

automatically  summon  1d8  vrocks,  1d6  hezrous,  1d4

glabrezu, 1d3 nalfeshnees, 1 marilith, or 1 balor.

Tanarri Traits: Demogorgon can communicate telepath-

ically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

He is immune to electricity and poison, and he has acid

resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

The Goals of Demogorgon

Inside the Prince of Demons rages a secret war for control of

himself. Demogorgon has two heads and therefore two

minds, and each one seeks domination of the other. Even

those creatures familiar with the demon prince are unaware

of Demogorgons eternal, internal conflict.

Aameul, one of Demogorgons personas, seeks to part

with his sibling persona, called Hethradiah. Aameul and

Hethradiah are each unable to control the other, because

each is in truth an aspect of the other. Nor could one slay the

other without also perishing. Still, Aameul seeks a way to be

free ofand eventually usurphis other half, for selfish-

ness and jealousy in a demon know no bounds. Hethradiah

is too concerned with the effect such a separation would

have on all his dread accomplishments to seriously consider

the notion of living alone.

Demogorgon has kept his two heads together so far. He

does not want to jeopardize the position and power that

hethat theyhave attained. By most definitions, this

internal conflict would be described as insanity, but that

would be applying inappropriate mortal standards to one to

whom such standards can never apply.

Demogorgons war with Orcus and Grazzt has been

epic in scope. Vast armies clash in the Abyssresources

that could have been spent in the Blood War are instead

wasted in a conflict that has no victor. However, Orcus

disappeared for a time, apparently slain. During that

time, Demogorgons power and influence grew in the

vacuum left behind, while Grazzt, who also disappeared

for a time (summoned and captured by the archmage

Zagyg), suffered.

Demogorgon is a creative and innovative creature. He

invented such foul things as the first retrievers, and he has

countless unique creatures at his beck and call.

The Cult of Demogorgon

ignorant of his existence. A slim few have heard his name in

whispers and nothing more. Only scholars, arcanists, and

those with a particular interest in demonkind know who

and what he is.

Demogorgon craves blood and souls. His cultists offer up

sacrifices in his name on black altars before double-headed

idols. His followers often control the societies they live in,

evil theocracies that rule by terror and violence.

The priests of the Prince of Demons are thus often rulers

as well. The clerics allied with Demogorgon are madmen,

masochists, and psychopathscompletely unfit for lead-

ership, but often in charge nonetheless. However, Demo-

gorgons fell priests are not as interested in political power

and conquest as they are in using their resources to serve

their master.

Demogorgons high priests wear writhing, snaky head-

dresses and black robes with hoods. Clerics affiliated with

Demogorgon have access to the Evil, Demonic, and Corrup-

tion domains.

Cultists: Offered here as examples are three cultists.

Erath is a typical priest of Demogorgon who leads a small

cult of worshipers in a human town, harboring a secret

library of forbidden secrets and stolen books. Eraths main

goal is to increase the size of this library, amassing forbidden

knowledge in Demogorgons name.

Sruurr leads a large community of evil lizardfolk who all

pay fealty to Demogorgon, Prince of Demons. Those that

challenge her end up as sacrifices on Demogorgons altar of

skulls and scales.

Qill is a psychopath, a rapist, and a necrophiliac who

roams the streets of civilized communities, finding lone vic-

tims for his attacks. Occasionally, he attempts to subdue his

victims so that they can be sacrificed to Demogorgon. Other

times, he uses his superb archery prowess to kill from a dis-

tance and then flees, laughing maniacally, before anyone

can tell where the fatal arrows came from. His two methods

of killing derive from the two different personalities that

arose from his insanity.

The Servants of Demogorgon

Severik is a balor fighter that commands a cadre of twelve

marilith blackguards in Demogorgons name. Each of these

demons is granted a retriever to use as a mount or compan-

ion.  The  mariliths  are  infamous  for  their  use  of  the

Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat applied to their teleport

without error ability.

everything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 20 half ).

Command Undead (Su): Each of these marilith black-

guards can command or rebuke undead as an 8th-level

cleric.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a mar-

ilith can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 4d6+7 points

of bludgeoning damage. The constricted creature must

succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) or lose consciousness

for at long as it remains in the mariliths coils and for 2d4

rounds thereafter.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a marilith hits a Medium-size

or smaller opponent with a tail slam attack, it deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +28). If it hits with the tail slam, it can also constrict

in the same round. The marilith has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its tail to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the marilith

is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during successive rounds automat-

ically deals tail slam and constrict damage.

Poison Use: A marilith blackguard never risks acciden-

tally poisoning itself when applying poison to a blade.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, each of these mariliths

may attempt to smite a good creature with one normal

Charisma bonus to all saving throws. (This modifier is

already figured into the statistics given above.)

Enhanced Multiweapon Fighting (Ex): This ability

primary and off hands. Combined with the Multidexterity

(60-foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

Organization: Grazzt plus 6 lamias, succubi, or mariliths

Challenge Rating: 24

Treasure: Quadruple standard

Alignment: Chaotic evil

Advancement: 

One of the most powerful demons in all the Abyss, Grazzt is

lord of three layers of that plane. He is a tall, darkly hand-

some demon with shiny black skin and green, glowing eyes.

Grazzt dresses in regal finery, but his slightly pointed ears

and yellow fangs mark him for the demon he is. Most strik-

ing of all are his digits: He has six ebony fingers on each

hand and six toes on each foot.

Tales are told among common folk that a dark-skinned

fiend sometimes visits witches and sorcerers, granting

them both sexual favors and magical powers. Grazzt is the

truth of that legend. A deeply sexual, erotic being, the Dark

Prince never goes anywhere without a retinue of female

monstersusually lamias, succubi, or mariliths. He is dan-

gerously charming and seductive, and he speaks with such

eloquence and grandeur that one might think him a devil,

not a demon.

Grazzt has long been in a state of war with both Demo-

gorgon and Orcus. At one point he had the upper hand in

this conflict, but he was suddenly summoned to the Mater-

ial Plane by Zagyg, the mad archmage. There, he was impris-

oned and subjugated until he was able to win his freedom at

the cost of being imprisoned on his own plane for a time. No

one knows if he is still under the restriction or notand he

is certainly not telling.

Grazzts symbol is a black, six-fingered hand.

Combat

Grazzt has a vast repertoire of spell-like abilitiesso vast

that many assume that he is in fact a sorcerer or a wizard.

He does not hesitate to use his spell-like abilities, and he

consorts with many evil wizards. However, he is just as

deadly in melee with his acidic sword and thus does not

shrink from close combat, either. He often goes into

combat with these abilities active: tongues, unholy aura (+4

additional bonus to AC, +4 bonus on saves), and detect

thoughts.

Fear (Su): With a sneer and a word (free action), Grazzt

can invoke a fear effect (Will DC 42 negates) at will.

The Goals of Grazzt

Grazzt  is  bent  on  the

conquest  of  the  Abyss.  He

despises that Demogorgon is called the

Prince of Demonshe covets that title more

than anything else. Grazzt controls Azzagrat, a realm that

extends over three layers of the Abyss. Spanning all three

layers is the city of Zelatar. Within the city lies the Argent

Palace, Grazzts personal home composed of sixty-six ivory

towers. From his palace, Grazzt schemes, developing intri-

cate plots to defeat his enemies and gain more power.

Grazzt loves seduction and guile. Although he is not

afraid of war, he would rather trick and charm his oppo-

nents than beat them in battle. He enjoys the notion that he

is the most intelligent, cunning creature in the Abyss.

The Dark Prince pays a great deal of attention (through

spies, mostly) to what goes on in the mortal realm. He is

fond of trading favors with mortals, giving aid or informa-

tion now for services to be demanded later.

The Cult of Grazzt

The cult of Grazzt is small, except among certain monstrous

races such as lamias, where his cultists are widespread and

powerful. Most priests of Grazzt, also known as the Chosen,

are female, and the highest-ranking cleric in a temple is

always female.

Grazzt enjoys blood sacrifices made in his name, and

sexual rites are important in services dedicated to him as

well. His temples are dark, secluded places

where orgies are common. Some section of the

temple is often shrouded in magical darkness.

From there, clerics use create undead on sacrifi-

cial victims to bring forth shadows that

guard the temple.

Clerics affiliated with Grazzt

generally have access to the

Demonic, Evil, and Dark-

ness domains. They tend to

wear  black  clothing  and

favor silver jewelry. Most

carry a wavy blade of some sort.

Cultists: Anastasia runs a secret

sect of clerics and wizards that operates

in the cellar of a tavern owned by one

of the wizards. The townsfolk believe

there is a coven of witches in the

area,  but  they  do  not  know  any

more than that. Isha-Denarthun,

on the other hand, is the head of

a  large  temple  in  the  desert

flanked  by  huge  statues  of

Grazzt. More than sixty lamias

serve Grazzt there, guarding and

tending the building, as well as par-

ticipating in the evil rites that occur

there. In the temple, called the

Home of Darkness, Isha-Denar-

thun oversees numerous living

sacrifices, in which the

victims are killed in a

huge vat of acid in an

area of permanent dark-

ness. Besmal serves as a go-

between for Anastasias coven and

the Home of Darkness. Isha-Denarthun is willing to work

with humanoids that serve her dark lord, and she is even

willing to send them some magical aid (in the form of items

created in the temple by the lamias) in exchange for sacrifi-

cial victims.

The Servants of Grazzt

Grazzt is always attended by six lamias with maximum hit

points. Furthermore, Unhath and Reluhantis, two mari-

liths, are never far from the demon prince when he is

within his dark palace. When he is gone, they run the

place with an iron hand, cruelly and chaotically. When

Grazzt returned from his time on the Material Plane, he

had much to do to get his realm back in order. Yattara is in

charge of a small squad of succubi that excel at infiltration

and espionage.

Multidexterity, Multiweapon Fighting, Power Attack,

Quicken Spell-Like Ability, Violate Spell-Like Ability.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, Un-

hath or Reluhantis can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing

4d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage. The constricted

creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 19) or lose

consciousness for at long as it remains in the mariliths

coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Unhath or Reluhantis hits a

Medium-size or smaller opponent with a tail slam attack,

she deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +20). If she hits with the tail slam, she can

also constrict in the same round. Unhath or Reluhantis has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

her tail to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the marilith is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check she makes

during successive rounds automatically deals tail slam and

constrict damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, bestow curse,

chaos hammer, cloudkill, comprehend languages, darkness, dese-

crate, detect good, detect law, detect magic, inflict serious wounds,

magic circle against good (self only), magic weapon, project

image, polymorph self, pyrotechnics, see invisibility, shatter,

telekinesis, teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of

objects only), unholy aura, unholy blight. Caster level 13th;

save DC 15 + spell level.

Enhanced Multiweapon Fighting (Ex): This ability

lessens the penalty for off-hand weapon use by 2 for both

primary and off hands. Combined with the Multidexterity

and Multiweapon Fighting feats, this ability effectively

negates all attack penalites for using one or more light off-

hand weapons.

Outsider Traits: Unhath and Reluhantis have darkvision

(60-foot range). They cannot be raised or resurrected.

Summon Tanar ri (Sp): Once per day a marilith can

attempt to summon 4d10 dretches, 1d4 hezrous, or 1 nal-

feshnee with a 50% chance of success, or 1 glabrezu or

another marilith with a 20% chance of success.

Tanarri Traits: Unhath and Reluhantis can communi-

cate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that

has a language. They are immune to electricity and poison,

and they have acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and

fire resistance 20.

Tumble +10, Use Magic Device +11; Dodge, Mobility,

Spring Attack, Weapon Finesse (short sword).

Energy Drain (Su): Yattara drains energy from a mortal

it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a

kiss on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed,

the succubus must start a grapple (grapple bonus +11),

which provokes an attack of opportunity. Her kiss or

embrace bestows one negative level; the victim must suc-

ceed at a Wisdom check (DC 15) to even notice. For each

negative level bestowed, Yattara heals 5 points of damage.

If the amount of healing is more than the damage she has

taken, she gains any excess as temporary hit points. If the

negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as

restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted oppo-

nent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) to remove it.

Failure means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced

by one.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcharm monster, clairaudi-

ence/clairvoyance, darkness,  desecrate,  detect  good,  detect

thoughts, doom, ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects

only), suggestion, and teleport without error (self plus 50

pounds of objects only); 1/dayunholy blight. Caster level

12th; save DC 15 + spell level.

Alternate Form (Su): Yattara can assume any humanoid

form of Small to Large size as a standard action. This ability

is  similar  to  the  polymorph  self spell  but  allows  only

humanoid forms.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally

allows Yattara to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half

damage (such as a fireball), she takes no damage with a suc-

cessful saving throw.

Outsider Traits: Yattara has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A marilith receives a +8 racial bonus on Listen

She cannot be raised or resurrected.

Juiblex, known as the Faceless Lord, is a loathsome demon

of slime and ooze. Even most demons shun him, and the

demon princes are said to refer to him contemptuously as

the lord of nothing. He is among the weakest demon lords

but is a terrifying foe nonetheless. He embodies many of the

horrible abilities of various slimes, oozes, and puddings, and

he commands impressive magical powers as well.

The domain of Juiblex is his by right of powerhe has

driven everything from the Slime Pits except the various slimes

and oozes that teem there. Nevertheless, a few demons

hezrous, mainlypay him enough fealty that they bring vic-

tims for Juiblex and his slimy brood to hunt and feed on.

134

Juiblex often appears as a 9-foot-tall cone of jelly and

slime striated with black, green, and a disgusting mixture of

brown, yellow, and gray. At other times, Juiblex is nothing

but a seething pool of animate ooze. In any form, pulsating

red eyes that look in all directions cover Juiblex completely.

Juiblexs symbol, hardly ever used, is that of a pseudopod

dripping slime.

Combat

Juiblexs favorite tactic is to engulf a number of foes at once,

invisibly, attacking the first with a contagion spell in addition

to all other attacks.

Acid (Ex): Juiblex secretes acid that dissolves organic

material and metal quickly. Any melee hit

deals acid damage. Juiblexs acidic

touch deals 50 points of damage

per round to wood or metal ob-

jects. The  opponents  armor

and clothing dissolve and be-

come useless immediately

unless  they  succeed  at  a

Reflex save (DC 41). The

acid  can  dissolve  stone,

dealing 20 points of dam-

age per round of contact.

A  metal or wooden weap-

on that strikes Juiblex dis-

solves immediately unless

it succeeds at a Reflex save

(DC 41).

Improved Grab (Ex): If

Juiblex hits a Medium-size

or smaller opponent with a

slam attack, he deals nor-

mal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking

an  attack  of  opportunity

(grapple bonus +44). If he

hits with the slam, he can

also constrict in the same

round. Juiblex has the option

to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use his pseudo-

pod to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but Juiblex is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check he makes during successive

rounds automatically deals slam and acid damage.

Circle of Cold (Sp): If Juiblex wishes it, he exudes frigid cold

so that all within 10 feet of him take 6d6 points of cold

damage each round (Fort DC 41 half ). This area of cold moves

with him. He can raise or lower this effect as a free action.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, Juiblex

can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 3d8+21 points of

damage plus 2d6 points of acid damage. The opponents

clothing and armor take a 4 penalty on Reflex saves against

the acid.

Create Slime (Sp): Once every other round, Juiblex can

spew forth a patch of green slime anywhere within 20 feet

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:23 AM  Page 135

of himself (including at a target, making a ranged touch

attack with a bonus of +28) as a free action.

Drown (Ex): A character who needs air to breathe and

becomes engulfed within Juiblexs horrible, acidic, semiliquid

form must make a Constitution check (DC 10) every round in

order to hold his or her breath. Each round, the DC increases

by 1. Upon failing a check, the character falls unconscious (0

hp). The next round, he or she drops to 1 hp and is dying. The

round after that, the character drowns and dies.

Engulf (Ex): Juiblex can simply bowl over a Large or

smaller creature as a standard action. This attack affects as

many opponents as his body can cover. Each target can make

either an attack of opportunity against Juiblex or a Reflex save

(DC 37) to avoid being engulfed. A successful saving throw

indicates that the target has been pushed back or aside

(targets choice) as Juiblex moves forward. An engulfed crea-

ture is subject to Juiblexs acid and drown attacks and is con-

sidered to be grappled and trapped within his body. Juiblex

cannot make a slam attack during a round in which he

attempts to engulf, but each engulfed creature takes auto-

matic slam damage in that round and every round thereafter

that it remains trapped.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, contagion, deeper

darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts, fear,

greater dispelling, hold monster, invisibility, phase door, read magic,

telekinesis, teleport without error, tongues (self only), touch of

Juiblex (no corruption cost), true seeing, unhallow, unholy aura,

unholy blight, utterdark; 1/daybefoul, blasphemy, despoil,

unholy aura. Caster level 20th; save DC 15 + spell level.

Amorphous (Ex): Blunt weapons and impact damage

deal no damage to Juiblex. He is able to slip through spaces

that otherwise could accommodate a creature no larger than

Tiny because of his jellylike substance.

Circle of Darkness (Sp): Juiblex can create an area around

himself with a 10-foot radius of complete darkness that no

being can see within. This special magical darkness can be

dispelled (as a spell from a 20th-level caster), but no light

spell can counter it. This area moves with Juiblex.

Immunities (Ex): Juiblex is immune to paralysis, stun-

ning, polymorphing, and critical hits because he has no dis-

cernible anatomy.

Summon Oozes (Sp): Once per day, Juiblex can automati-

cally summon 1d6 gray oozes, 1d4 ochre jellies, or 1d2 black

puddings.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day Juiblex can automati-

cally summon 3d10 dretches or 1 hezrou.

Tanarri Traits: Juiblex can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. He is

immune to electricity and poison, and he has acid resistance

20, cold resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

The Goals of Juiblex

Juiblex does not plot and scheme. Juiblex is content to

simply exist, destroying and killing and corroding anything

he can get his tendrils on. He hates everything and revels

only in destruction.

The Cult of Juiblex

Although a few demented souls (and the occasional aboleth)

revere the Faceless Lord, there is no organized cult of

Juiblex. For example, Duvamil is a native of the Material

Plane. She reveres Juiblex, but he is unaware of her. Never-

theless, her devotion to the Faceless Lord grants her disgust-

ing powers with which she terrorizes the land, causing

chaos and woe for its own sake, in the name of the demon

she reveres.

ease as if casting the spell contagion (caster level 10th).

Corrosive Touch (Ex): Three times per day, Duvamil can

secrete a caustic slime on her hand that deals 2d6 points of

damage. Once it is secreted, the thrall of Juiblex can make

an attack to get the corrosive slime to damage a foe, dealing

normal unarmed damage as well as the damage from the

slime.

Sickening Slime (Ex): Duvamil secretes a smelly slime

that coats her body. Anyone within 5 feet must make a For-

titude saving throw (DC 19) or take a 1 circumstance

penalty on attack rolls and skill checks.

Alter Self (Su): Duvamil can change her appearance and

form, as though using the spell alter self (caster level 4th), at

cessful saving throw.

Gnome Traits: Duvamil has low-light vision that lets her

see twice as far as a human in low-light conditions. She also

has a +2 racial bonus on saves against illusions, a +1 racial

bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids, and a

+4 dodge bonus against giants.

Summon Demon (Sp): Duvamil can summon a demon of 5

HD or less once per day. This ability functions in all other

ways as a summon monster spell (caster level 15th).

Summon Ooze (Sp): Duvamil can summon a patch of green

slime, a gray ooze, an ochre jelly, or a gelatinous cube as if

she had cast a summon monster spell (caster level 6th).

Possessions: +3 studded leather armor, +2 mighty composite

shortbow (+1 Str bonus), 20 +1 arrows.

The Servants of Juiblex

Juiblex has many slime, pudding, ooze, and jelly servants,

although none are intelligent enough to serve the demon

lord willinglyexcept for one.

Darkness Given Hunger is the largest black pudding

known. It was possessed by a hezrou demon at Juiblexs

command, and then an imprison possessor spell was cast upon

the fusion, making it permanent. For centuries, the demon

has dwelled within the pudding, and the two have truly

become one in the foul depths of the Abyss. Now, Darkness

Given Hunger is Juiblexs main servant, helping patrol the

Abyssal layer upon which they both dwell, looking for food.

Acid (Ex): Darkness Given Hunger secretes a digestive

acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly. Any

melee hit deals acid damage. The puddings acidic touch

deals 50 points of damage per round to wood or metal

objects. An opponents armor and clothing dissolve and

become useless immediately unless they succeed at a Reflex

save (DC 32). The acid can dissolve stone, dealing 20 points

of damage per round of contact.

A metal or wooden weapon that strikes Darkness Given

Hunger dissolves immediately unless it succeeds at a Reflex

save (DC 32).

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, Dark-

ness Given Hunger can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing

2d8+10 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of

acid damage. The opponents clothing and armor take a 4

penalty on Reflex saves against the acid.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Darkness Given Hunger hits a

Medium-size or smaller opponent with a slam attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +41). If it hits with the slam, it can also constrict in

the same round. Thereafter, Darkness Given Hunger has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

pseudopod to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but it is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals slam, acid, and constrict damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate object, blasphemy,

blink, chaos hammer, deeper darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect

magic, dispel good, magic circle against, good, produce flame,

summon swarm, teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of

objects only), unholy blight; 3/daygaseous form. Caster level

13th; save DC 10 + spell level.

Stench (Ex): Darkness Given Hunger produces a foul-

smelling, toxic slime when it fights. Any creature except a

tanarri with 10 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 32)

or be overwhelmed by nausea. It is rendered helpless from

gagging and vomiting as long as it remains in the affected

area and for 1d4 rounds afterward. A creature that success-

fully saves takes a 2 morale penalty on attack rolls but can-

not be affected by Darkness Given Hungers stench again

for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes

the effect.

Blindsight (Ex): Darkness Given Hunger is blind, but its

entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain

prey by scent and vibration. This ability enables it to discern

objects  and  creatures  within  60  feet.  Darkness  Given

Hunger usually does not need to make Spot or Listen

checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

Immunities: Darkness Given Hunger is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing, and it

is not subject to critical hits.

Skills and Feats: Darkness Given Hunger gains skills

and feats as its demonic component.

Alignment: Chaotic evil

Advancement: 

Orcus is a massive, bloat-

ed demon princebloat-

ed on spite, bile, and con-

tempt.  After  becoming

complacent with his wars

against Demogorgon and

Grazzt  waning,  Orcus

was  murdered  and  de-

posed.  But  then,  Orcus

rose from the deadan

u n d e a d   d e m o n  a n d

took the name Tenebrous

for a time, hiding in the

shadows and waiting to

take his revenge. Now he

has reinstated himself to

his former position and

taken  up  residence  in

Naratyr, his terrible fortress-city in the Abyss on Thanatos,

the layer he rules. Once again Orcus finds himself in a strug-

gle for dominance with many of the other demon lords.

Orcus is no longer content to grow old and fat feeding on

larvae in his castle. He focuses his anger and hate on the

absolute destruction of his enemies and the spread of woe

and havoc among mortals. Truly a demon reborn, Orcus is

more terrible and more dangerous than ever.

Orcus hates both Demogorgon and Grazzt. He resents

them for their power, and he covets their realms. Orcus

commands a host of undead as well as armies of demons that

ravage the fields of the Abyss that they cross.

Probably because he has an identifiable, if loathsome,

portfolio, Orcus is worshiped as a god more often than

most of the other demon princes are. Although Demogor-

gon might actually be more powerful, Orcus may be closer

to ascending to true godhood.

Standing 15 feet tall, Orcus is a massive demon. His head

bears a striking resemblance to that of a ram, and his legs

end in cloven hooves. Batlike wings complete the picture of

the archetypal demon. In fact, when commoners think of

demons, they most likely think of some terrible picture of

Orcus that they once saw somewhere.

Orcus is best known in some circles for his wand, an arti-

fact of malefic might. This wandmore accurately described

as a rodis made of black iron and obsidian and topped with

a skull. It has terrible powers (see the Artifacts section of

Chapter 6) and is a hor-

rific weapon in its own

right.  The  black,  skull-

topped rod also serves as

the princes symbol.

Combat

Orcus relies heavily on

his  wand  in  combat,

much preferring to en-

gage  in  melee  and  kill

foes with the artifact. He

often goes into combat

with unholy aura (grant-

ing a +4 bonus on saves)

active on himself as well

as any servants he might

have with him.

Poison  (Ex):  Orcus

delivers his poison (Fort

DC  44)  with  each  suc-

cessful sting attack. The

initial  damage  is  1d6

points of Strength dam-

age; the secondary dam-

age  is  2d6  points  of

Strength damage.

ing in the Necromancy school. He can also cast spells usu-

ally limited to undead. Naratyr has hundreds of spellbooks,

so Orcus has access to any wizard spell he wishes to prepare,

Outsider Traits: Orcus has darkvision (60-foot range).

He cannot be raised or resurrected.

See Invisibility (Su): Invisible creatures and objects are

always visible to Orcus, as if he constantly had a see invisibil-

ity spell (caster level 20th) active.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day Orcus can automati-

cally summon 1d6 vrocks, 1d4 hezrous, or 1 glabrezu, or he

has an 80% chance to summon 1 nalfeshnee, 1 marilith, or

1 balor.

Summon Undead (Sp): Once per day Orcus can automati-

cally summon 4d10 wights, 1d8 spectres, or 1d3 vampires or

mohrgs.

Tanarri Traits: Orcus can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. He is

immune to electricity and poison, and he has acid resistance

20, cold resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

Possessions: The Wand of Orcus is an artifact that acts as a +6

chaotic unholy greatclub that adds a +5 deflection bonus to the

wielders  Armor  Class  and  forces  any  living  creature

touched by it to make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or die

instantly. It has other powers as well (see its description in

Chapter 6).

The Goals of Orcus

Orcus is in many ways a contradictory figure. He does not

delight in his charges, the undead, and has not taken up the

self-proclaimed mantle Prince of the Undead out of devo-

tion or allegiance. If anything, the demon lord despises

undead. He has little but contempt for them and uses them

without thought or consideration. Of course, Orcus despises

the living as well. He hates all things, and seethes with utter

revulsion and loathing at all times. He craves only personal

power and the spread of misery and destruction for all others.

Occasionally, Orcus allows his wand to be found by a

mortal in order to wreak greater chaos and evil among those

inhabiting the Material Plane. This sort of dalliance lasts only

for a short timeperhaps a year or two at mostbefore the

bloated prince grows bored and reclaims his artifact, usually

along with the soul of whoever currently wields it.

Orcus is in a constant state of war with his rivals Demo-

gorgon and Grazzt. More often than not, actual warfare

occurs between his armies of undead and demons and

Grazzts hordes of monsters and demons. Strife with Demo-

gorgon often takes a more subtle guise, that of assassination

and sabotage. This is usually because both his and Demogor-

gons full armies are simultaneously warring against the

forces of Grazzt. However, sometimes the legions of Orcus

and Demogorgon meet in the course of their struggle

against Grazzt, and then they attack each other as viciously

as they fight the legions of the Dark Prince.

The Cult of Orcus

The cult of Orcus is widespread, with a more significant fol-

lowing among humanoids than most demon princes can

boast. In particular, orcs, half-orcs, ogres, and giants revere

Orcus, as do a large number of corrupt and despicable

humans. His temples are usually hidden, and his worshipers

form secret societies living in otherwise normal communi-

ties. Other of his temples are terrible strongholds full of

undead, where wicked lords commit atrocities and wage

wars in the demon princes name. Sometimes an entire orc

tribe devotes itself to the Prince of the Undead, but such

individuals are shunned even by other orcs.

Orcus demands living sacrifice as a part of his rituals.

Blood and skulls are an important part of the imagery used

in his worship. Idols and altars are often surrounded by or

built upon tall piles of skulls. Intelligent undead never will-

ingly serve Orcus (they are more likely to venerate the

deities Vecna or Erythnul). However, many vampires, liches,

and other undead creatures are forced into his service by

dark pacts or compelling magic.

Priests and particularly influential followers of Orcus are

called Skulls, while high priests are called Skull Lords.

Often, a single Skull Lord gains so much power and influ-

ence among the followers of Orcus that he adopts the

mantle of Skull King or Skull Queen.

It is common for followers of Orcus to carry black, skull-

topped scepters around, not in order to fool anyone into

thinking that they wield the actual Wand of Orcus, but to rep-

resent and remind others of their lords dread might. They

also often wear skull masks and black robes with hoods or

goat-horned headdresses and silver robes.

Clerics affiliated with Orcus typically have access to the

Chaos, Evil, and Death domains.

Cultists: Perhaps one of the most powerful and infa-

mous priests of Orcus alive today is an unusual human

named Quah-Nomag. Because his ancestry includes an

ogre, he is Large and has ability scores different from those

of a normal human. He also has a +3 natural armor bonus.

Not only is Quah-Nomag a despicable creature in virtu-

ally every way, but he was instrumental in restoring Orcus

back to the living. The evil cleric used an obscene ritual on

the Astral Plane that restored Orcus. For his reward, Quah-

Nomag  has  been  given  many  blessings  from  Orcus,

although the Prince of the Undead already tires of Quah-

Nomags self-importance and arrogance since the successful

ritual. While he retains his power and title, Quah-Nomag

may not be able to count on Orcuss gratitude forever.

Carrion Stench (Ex): When desired, Quah-Nomag can

emit a terrible smell in a 10-foot radius. Living creatures in the

radius (excluding Quah-Nomag) must succeed at a Fortitude

save (DC 18) or take a 2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon

The Servants of Orcus

Orcus has many servants, and most of them are undead,

although a number of demons serve him as well. Most of his

servants do not last long enough to gain positions of power.

Kauvra is a vampire who serves as an enforcer for Orcus

on Thanatos. Her rages are infamous, as is the long list of

creatures that she has slain single-handedly. Harthoons

arcane power makes him a perfect vizier for the Prince of

the Undead, and he currently serves in that capacity at

Orcuss right hand.

Blood Drain (Ex): Kauvra can suck blood from a living

victim with her fangs by making a successful grapple check

(grapple bonus +24). If she pins the foe, Kauvra drains

blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round

the pin is maintained.

Domination (Su): Kauvra can crush an opponents will

just by looking into his or her eyes. This ability is similar to

a gaze attack, except that Kauvra must take a standard action

to use it, and those merely looking at her are not affected.

Anyone Kauvra targets must succeed at a Will save (DC 23)

or fall instantly under her influence as though by a dominate

person spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer. The ability has a

range of 30 feet.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by Kauvras

slam attack gains two negative levels. For each negative level

bestowed, Kauvra heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of

healing is more than the damage she has taken, she gains

any excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has

not been removed (with a spell such as restoration) before 24

hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed at a

Fortitude save (DC 23) to remove it. Failure means the oppo-

nents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Alternate Form (Su): Kauvra can assume the shape of a

bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This abil-

ity is similar to a polymorph self spell cast by a 12th-level sor-

cerer, except that she can assume only one of the forms

listed here per use of the ability. Kauvra can remain in that

form until she assumes another or until the next sunrise.

Children of the Night (Su): Once per day Kauvra can

call forth a pack of 4d8 dire rats, a swarm of 10d10 bats, or a

pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. These creatures

arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve Kauvra for up to 1 hour.

Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous human-

oid slain by Kauvras energy drain attack rises as a vampire

spawn (see Vampire Spawn in the Monster Manual) 1d4 days

after burial.

If Kauvra instead brings the victims Constitution to 0 or

lower by means of her blood drain, the victim returns as a

spawn if it had 4 or fewer HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or

more HD. In either case, the new vampire or spawn is

under Kauvras command and remains enslaved until

Kauvras death.

Gaseous Form (Su): As a standard action, Kauvra can

assume gaseous form at will, as the spell cast by a 5th-level

sorcerer, but she can remain gaseous indefinitely and has

a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.

Greater Rage (Ex): The following changes are in effect as

Fast Healing (Ex): Kauvra heals 5 points of damage each

round so long as she has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0

though using a spider climb spell.

Turn Resistance (Ex): Kauvra is treated as an undead

with 20 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke, command,

a 60-foot radius that looks at him must succeed at a Will save

(DC 26) or be affected as though by a fear spell (caster level

Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature Harthoon

touches must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 26) or be

It may be that Yeenoghu was once a mortal gnoll. Or it may

be that, as a bestial and savage demon, he simply saw a kin-

ship with the gnolls. In any event, this demon prince con-

siders himself the patron of gnolls, and indeed many gnolls

do pay him homage.

Yeenoghu is very powerful, but not in the same league as

Demogorgon or Orcus in terms of personal power or in influ-

ence and armies. Yeenoghu does control a layer of the Abyss,

which he creatively calls Yeenoghus Realm. There, he hunts

lesser demons and other creatures while he plots his next

attacks against layers with weak rulers in hopes of conquest.

One success that Yeenoghu achieved long ago was his sub-

jugation of the demonic entity that calls himself the King of

the Ghouls. Once a vassal of Orcus, the King of the Ghouls

controlled his own minor layer of the Abyss. Yeenoghus gnoll

horde invaded and conquered that layer and its ruler. The King

of the Ghouls swore fealty to Yeenoghu and pays homage to

him even to this day. The Abyssal layer, however, was lost to

Yeenoghu because he did not command an army vast enough

to defend both it and the layer he already occupied. The King

of the Ghouls rules there again, but he is a vassal of Yeenoghu

now rather than a minion of Orcus. So far, Orcuss attention

has been elsewhere, and he has not acted against

the Prince of Gnolls.

Yeenoghu appears as a massive, gaunt gnoll 12

feet in height. Yellow fur appears in mangy patches

on his body, with pale gray flesh showing where

the fur is absent. His amber-colored eyes are large

and protruding.

Yeenoghus symbol is a triple-headed flail.

Combat

Bestial and straightforward, Yeenoghu is likely to charge

into melee growling and screaming epithets before doing

anything more

subtle. He usu-

ally  prepares

for battle with

a  bulls  strength

spell as well as

unholy aura.

Thus, his Strength is usually even higher

than that given above (and thus his attack

and damage bonuses are also higher),

and his AC and saving throws all have

a +4 bonus against good characters.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will

blasphemy,  bulls  strength,

deeper darkness, desecrate, detect

good, detect law, detect thoughts,

greater dispelling, greater magic fang, suggestion, telekinesis, tele-

port without error, tongues (self only), unhallow, unholy aura,

unholy blight; 1/dayshapechange, spread of savagery. Caster

level 20th; save DC 17 + spell level.

Fast Healing (Ex): Yeenoghu regains lost hit points at

the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does

not allow Yeenoghu to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Outsider Traits: Yeenoghu has darkvision (60-foot

range). He cannot be raised or resurrected.

Scent (Ex): Yeenoghu can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

See Invisibility (Su): Invisible creatures and objects are

always visible to Yeenoghu, as if he constantly had a see invis-

ibility spell (caster level 20th) active.

Summon Ghouls (Sp): Once per day, Yeenoghu can auto-

matically summon 1d6+6 ghouls. These special ghouls have

maximum hit points and a +5 profane bonus on their turn

resistance, AC, and attack and damage rolls.

Summon Gnolls (Sp): Once per day, Yeenoghu can automat-

ically summon 11d6 gnolls or 3d4 5th-level gnoll

fighters.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per

day Yeenoghu can automati-

summon  1d2+1

cally

vrocks.

Tanarri Traits: Yeenoghu can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

He is immune to electricity and poison, and he has acid

resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

Possessions: Yeenoghu wields a Huge +5 triple flail. This is a

unique exotic weapon. Each time a hit is scored, roll 1d3 to

see how many of the heads hit the target. Each head deals

1d12+24 points of damage. If more than one head hits the

same target, the victim must make a Fortitude save (DC 17) or

be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. If all three hit, the target must

also make a Will save (DC 17) or be confused for 10 rounds.

The Goals of Yeenoghu

Yeenoghu knows that he does not have the power of Demo-

gorgon or Orcus. Thus, for now he is content with the sub-

jugation of lesser demons and entities.

Yeenoghu would like to see his favored people, the gnolls,

prosper. When he can, Yeenoghu acts on their behalf, but his

attention is not steadfast. More generally, Yeenoghu favors

the spread of savagery and barbarism over the spread of civ-

ilization. When he sends his gnoll host to attack and con-

quer foes in the Abyss, it is his intention to always strike at

cities first and cast them down in burning ruin. Even if Yee-

noghu were to subjugate another entire layer, he would not

rebuild the cities.

The Cult of Yeenoghu

The  cult  of  Yeenoghu  is  common  among  gnolls,  but

extremely rare among other races.

Yeenoghu demands that his servants make living sacri-

fices and dedicate them to him in beastly rites. His temples

are always located far from any civilized area, usually in

some rocky, craggy wilderness areapreferably a cave or

underground cavern. The altar is a crude slab of stone,

stained with blood and gristle. Rituals devoted to Yeenoghu

include guttural chanting and (on the rare occasion when

they are held outside) howling at the moon. They always

take place at night.

His priests wear dark brown robes, usually accented with a

mangy yellow color. If the priests are not gnolls, these robes

are often fur-lined. Priests of Yeenoghu never wash their

robes, so the amount of spattered blood (from sacrifices as

well as battle) on the robes is a sign of experience, worn like

an honorific. Clerics affiliated with Yeenoghu usually have

access to the Chaos, Demonic, and Bestial domains.

Rezwal is a typical gnoll cleric who regards Yeenoghu as

his patron. He leads a small cult devoted to Yeenoghu and

serves as a constant companion to the tribes leader. He

wears the skulls of his latest victims around his waist and

dangling from his flail on leather cords.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, the King of Ghouls can

make a normal attack to deal +18 points of additional

damage against a good foe.

Create Spawn (Su): In most cases, the King of Ghouls

devours his victims. From time to time, however, the bodies

of his humanoid victims lie where they fell, to rise as ghouls

in 1d4 days. Casting protection from evil on a body before the

end of that time averts the transformation.

an undead with 24 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke,

command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: The King of Ghouls is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires

a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. He is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. The King

of Ghouls cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if he

is willing. The King of Ghouls has darkvision (60-foot range).

Possessions: +2 breastplate, ring of invisibility.

ARCHDEVILS

Like the demon princes, the archdevils are the greatest of

their kind and wholly unique. Unlike their demonic coun-

terparts, however, the archdevils are organized in a strict

hierarchy. The archdevils rarely make open war against each

other. Instead, they plot and scheme in intricate webs of pol-

itics, duplicity, and betrayal.

The archdevils are also called the Lords of Hell, the

Dukes (or Archdukes) of Hell, and the Lords of the Nine.

Together, they rule all the layers of the Nine Hells. Each

archdevil has his or her own dark palace, legions of devils

and monsters, and schemes to gain more power. The vari-

ous archdevils continually make and break alliances with

each other and other planar powers in their quest for

greater might and control.

The greatest of all archdevils is Asmodeus, who rules over

all of them from the bottom of the Pit itself. He has con-

trolled the Hells for as long as histories have been recorded,

although there are rumors of even older lords of the Pit,

with names such as Satan and Lucifer. These beings, how-

ever, are long gone now.

Not terribly long ago (as things are measured in hell,

anyway), Asmodeus masterminded the Reckoning, when

the face of hell changed fairly dramatically. The archdevils

Baalzebul and Mephistopheles warred with each other for

the rulership of hell. With the help of a lord named Geryon,

Asmodeus convinced the armies of each side to turn against

their masters. All of the other archdevils fell before the

onslaught of their own troops. Asmodeus reinstated most of

themwith the exception of Moloch, who was replaced by

the Hag Countess, and Geryon, whose position was taken by

Levistus. (Leave it to the master of all hell to betray the only

archdevil that remained loyal to him.)

Currently Bel, Mammon, Levistus, and the Hag Countess

have no real allegiances. But that could change. Politics in

hell being what they are, most likely the devils will polarize

again. One thing is for sure: There is more hostility, and

more fear, toward Asmodeus than ever before.

With the exception of Bel, the archdevils do not concern

themselves too much with the Blood War. Hells generals are

a council of pit fiends called the Dark Eight, mighty warriors

that helped Asmodeus win the day during the Reckoning.

Advancement: 

Bel is one of the newer lords of the Nine Hells, currently the

ruler of Avernus, the first layer. He is the only archdevil who

spends more of his time worrying about the Blood War than

hells own politics. Although he rose through the ranks based

on his own skill and power (and victories over the demons),

the former pit fiend enjoys the support of none of the other

lords of hell. Bel is, however, held in high favor among the

Dark Eight, and that is not a bit of influence to be overlooked.

It is thought that Zariel, the former ruler of Avernus, is

still kept within Bels Bronze Citadel, where Bel draws off

her power to extend his own.

Bel resembles a pit fiend with vast bat wings. His fangs drip

with green liquid, and red scales cover his hulking body. His

of Bel is a fanged mouth biting down on a swords blade.

Combat

Bel is an expert tactician and does not fight a battle that is

not on his terms. He loves ambushes and double-crosses,

feints and counterfeints. In personal combat, he

relies on his Huge oddly curved greatsword.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple

check, Bel can crush a grabbed op-

ponent, dealing 2d4+22 points of

bludgeoning damage.

Disease  (Ex):  Even  if  a

creature Bel has bitten saves

against  his  poison,  it  must

succeed at a Fortitude save

(DC 34) or contract devil chills.

The  incubation  period  is  1d4

days,  and  the  disease  deals  1d6

points  of  Strength  damage. The

victim must make three successful

Fortitude saving throws in a row

to recover (see Disease in

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide).

Fear Aura (Su): As a

free action, Bel can create

an aura of fear in a 20-foot

radius. It is otherwise iden-

tical  with  the  fear spell

(caster level 15th; Will DC

30). If the save is successful,

that  creature  cannot  be

affected again by Bels fear aura

for 24 hours. Other baatezu are

immune to the aura.

self, pyrotechnics, suggestion, teleport without error, unholy aura,

unhallow, wall of fire; 1/daymeteor swarm, symbol (any), wish.

Caster level 19th; save DC 17 + spell level.

Baatezu Traits: Bel can communicate telepathically with

any creature within 100 feet that has a

language. In addition, he can see per-

fectly in darkness of any kind, even that

created by a deeper darkness spell. Bel is

immune to fire and poison, and he has

acid resistance 20 and cold resist-

ance 20.

Outsider Traits: Bel cannot

be raised or resurrected.

Regeneration (Ex): Bel

takes normal damage from

holy and blessed weap-

ons of at least +3 enhance-

ment.

Summon Baatezu (Sp):

Twice  per  day  Bel  can

automatically summon

3 lemures, osyluths, or

barbazu,  or  2  erinyes,

cornugons, or gelugons.

Possessions: Bel uses a

Huge +3 flaming great-

sword  that  gains  a  +5

enhancement bonus on

attack and damage rolls

when  used  against  de-

mons. This is a Blood War

legacy, and he has killed

literally  thousands  of

demons with it. He is also

never without a ring of pro-

tection +5.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Bel

hits a Medium-size or smaller

opponent with a tail slap attack,

he  deals  normal  damage  and

attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without pro-

voking an attack of op-

portunity (grapple bo-

nus +45). If he hits with

the tail slap, he can also constrict in the same round. Bel has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

his tail to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but Bel is not considered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check he makes during successive rounds

automatically deals tail slap damage.

The Goals of Bel

Among the archdevils

of  hell,  Bel  is  often

called the Pretender. It is

thought that Asmodeus

allowed  his  coup  only

because  it  meant  one

less scheming lord.

Bel would be so busy fighting the demons, the rumor says,

that he could not scheme against his betters, and most

important, his patron.

Bel simply wants to secure his position. He has made

overtures to ally himself with Baalzebul and Mephis-

topheles, but they have rebuffed him. His acts of treachery

against the old lord of Avernus, Zariel, are too fresh in

their minds.

The Cult of Bel

There are no worshipers of Bel. A few scattered cults of

Zariel once existed, but they did not transfer their devotion

to her usurper.

The Servants of Bel

Bel, a military commander, is always surrounded by other

powerful and warlike devils. In particular, he has two cor-

nugon fighters, Yeddikadir and Nalebranc, who strike fear

even in devils that are supposedly more powerful. Yed-

dikadir is secretly also in the service of Belial, but only to

keep an eye on Bel, not to betray him . . . at least not yet.

can create an aura of fear in a 5-foot radius. This effect is

otherwise identical with a fear spell (caster level 12th; save

DC 17). If the save is successful, that creature cannot be

affected again by that cornugons fear aura for 24 hours.

Nalebrancs tail attack bleeds for an additional 2 points of

damage per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such

attacks result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 4

points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be

stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 10) or the

application of a cure spell or some other healing spell (heal,

healing circle, or the like).

Baatezu Traits: Yeddikadir and Nalebranc can communi-

cate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has

a language. In addition, they can see perfectly in darkness of

Dispater is the Iron Dukethe lord of the Iron City of Dis.

His home is the Iron Tower, an impregnable fortress made

to protect a paranoid archdevil.

Dispater is the picture of caution and careful thought.

He never acts rashly, never leaves his tower (unless com-

manded to do so by Asmodeus), and always has at least

nine different backup plans and escape routes at any

given moment. No matter the situation, however, Dispa-

ter keeps a veneer of calm, gentlemanly manners. He

never shows anger or contempt, making him all the

more charmingand dangerous.

Dispater stands approximately 7 feet tall. He has dark hair

and small horns. His skin is cold to the touch and feels like

dressed in regal finery and carries his rod as a badge of office

as well as a terrible, macelike weapon. He often sports a

magic iron shield as well.

fire and poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and cold resist-

ance 20.

Regeneration (Ex): Dispater takes normal damage from

holy and blessed weapons of at least +5 enhancement.

Dispaters symbol is a black iron tower on a red field.

Outsider Traits: Dispater cannot be raised or resur-

Combat

Dispater is extremely conservative and careful. He always

thinks defensively in battle. He keeps foes at bay using wall

of iron or wall of deadly chains while he summons assistance.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Dispater can create an

aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It otherwise functions as the

fear spell (caster level 15th, save DC 37). If the save is

successful, that creature cannot be affected

again by the aura for 24 hours.

Other baatezu are immune to the

aura.

Flesh to Iron (Su): If Dispater

makes a successful touch attack

with his hand rather than his

mace, he can cause flesh to turn

to iron. The subject touched can

attempt a Fortitude saving throw

(DC 40) to resist the effect. This is

in  every  way  like  petrification,

except  that  the  victim  becomes

iron, not stone.

Rust (Su): If Dispater makes a

successful touch attack with his hand

rather than his mace, he can cause any

metal he touches to corrode, falling

to  pieces  and  becoming  useless

immediately. The size of the object is

immateriala full suit of armor rusts

away as quickly as a sword. Non-

magical metal objects (including

creatures turned to iron by Dispa-

ters flesh to iron ability) get no

saving throw against this effect.

Magic armor, a magic weapon, or any

other magic item made of metal

must succeed at a Reflex save

(DC 40) or be dissolved.

A metal weapon that deals damage

QH/JE

to Dispater also corrodes immediately. Wooden, stone, and

other nonmetallic weapons are unaffected.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day Dispater can auto-

matically summon 5 osyluths or barbazu, 3 erinyes, cornu-

gons, or gelugons, or 1 pit fiend.

Possessions: Dispaters rod is a minor artifact, a +6 heavy

mace that acts as a rod of rulership and can smite good three

times per day (dealing an additional +20 damage to a good

being). Dispater often carries a +5 large iron shield.

The Goals of Dispater

Dispater is ancient even by archdevil stan-

dards and has learned much over his mil-

lennia of rulership and control. He is

cautious and slow to act. Throughout

much of his time as a Lord of the Nine,

he has allied himself with Mephis-

topheles. Like his ally, Dispater despises

Baalzebul and works against him at

every turn.

Dispaters main objective for now

and the foreseeable future is the

downfall of his enemy, Baalzebul.

All  his  schemes  and  actions

center around that goal. Like-

wise, Baalzebul works against

Dispater, so the Iron Duke fre-

quently devotes his time and

attention to defenses against

his foes machinations.

The Cult of Dispater

Many beings venerate Dispater,

particularly hobgoblins, goblins, and

other warlike humanoids. They revere

his unassailable and indestructible

nature.

Temples of Dispater are fortresses

unto themselves. They are easily

defended (and often hidden), with multiple

secret escape routes to allow the defending priests backup

options. The doctrines of Dispater all involve contingencies

and options. While followers of Dispater are defensive-

minded to the point of cloistering themselves, they never

allow themselves to be backed into a corner.

Clerics affiliated with Dispaters goals wear gray clothing

and iron masks. They wield maces of iron and are usually

heavily armored. They usually have access to the Diabolic,

Evil, and War domains.

Cultists: The half-elf Thorolf stands tall and powerful,

with a regal bearing befitting his position as high priest

of Dispater in a temple located outside a small town. Next

to the temple is a mausoleum used by the locals to store

their dead. This place of the dead is controlled by a cult of

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:28 AM  Page 147

Dispater, but no one seems to object because necromancers

and others who might animate the dead consider the place

off limits.

No one realizes that Thorolf is a necrophiliac. He sneaks

away from his domineering role in the church to enter the

mausoleum from time to time for sex. Even the other wor-

shipers of Dispater do not know, and he would be quick to

slay anyone that might find out.

The Servants of Dispater

Within the Iron Tower, Dispater gains a +20 divine bonus to

Armor Class, spell resistance, and all saving throws, making

him all but invulnerable. Thus, he hardly ever leaves the

place, relying on his servantsmostly erinyesto carry

out his bidding or speak for him. The chief of all his erinyes

servants is Ustyhrin-ja, a hideously scarred disciple. She is

fiercely loyal to Dispater and in recent weeks personally

slew three erinyes under her that she discovered were actu-

ally spies for Baalzebul. This event has made her even more

paranoid and distrusting of all except her master.

The Iron Tower has a new guardian as well: Talos. Con-

trary to what some people now say, Dispater did not create

Talos. The legendary iron golem is very old, and how it came

to serve Dispater is a bit of a mystery.

Charm Person (Su): Ustyhrin-ja can charm a humanoid

creature with a look. This is not a gaze attack, and the target

need not meet her eye. The ability has a range of 60 feet; an

affected opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC 18) or

become utterly loyal to Ustyhrin-ja. The victim will do any-

thing to protect Ustyhrin-ja, even if that means slaying his

or her companions or facing certain death. The ability is oth-

erwise similar to a charm person spell (caster level 8th).

Rope Entangle (Ex): Ustyhrin-ja carries a stout rope 50

feet long that entangles opponents of any size as an animate

rope spell (caster level 16th). Ustyhrin-ja can hurl the rope

30 feet with no range penalty.

Rusting Grasp (Sp): Once per day, Ustyhrin-ja can produce

an effect identical to that of a rusting grasp spell (caster level

15th).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, charm mon-

ster, desecrate, invisibility (self only), magic circle against good

Ustyhrin-ja can also use teleport without error (self plus 50

pounds of objects only) at will. Caster level 12th.

Baatezu Traits: Ustyhrin-ja can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

In addition, she can see perfectly in darkness of any kind,

even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Ustyhrin-ja is

immune to fire and poison, and she has acid resistance 20

and cold resistance 20.

Device Lore (Ex): Ustyhrin-ja can find traps made

mostly of metal as a rogue can. Further, she gains a +2 com-

petency bonus when making Disable Device checks for

devices made mostly of metal.

Greater Iron Hews (Ex): Once per day, Ustyhrin-ja may

add a +6 divine bonus to the damage rolls for all successful

attacks she makes that round. This bonus does not stack

with that provided by iron hews; the abilities are separate.

Iron Body (Sp): Once per day, Ustyhrin-ja can gain the

benefits of the iron body spell (caster level 18th).

Iron Hews (Ex): Once per day, Ustyhrin-ja may add a +3

divine bonus to the damage rolls for all successful attacks

she makes that round.

Iron Power (Su): When using an iron or steel weapon,

Ustyhrin-ja gains a +2 insight bonus on attack and damage

rolls. Further, her threat range is tripled as if she were using

a keen weapon. These adjustments are included in the statis-

tics above.

cloud of poisonous gas (Fort DC 37; initial damage 2d4 Con-

stitution, secondary damage death) that fills a 10-foot cube

directly in front of him and lasts 1 round. Once he uses his

breath weapon, he cannot do so again for 1d4+1 rounds.

Construct Traits: Talos is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects. He is not subject to criti-

cal hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy

drain, or death from massive damage. He cannot heal himself

but can be healed through repair. Talos cannot be raised or

resurrected. He has darkvision (60-foot range).

Magic Immunity (Ex): Talos is immune to all spells,

spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as fol-

lows. An electricity effect slows him (as the slow spell) for 3

rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow

effect on Talos and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points

of damage it would otherwise deal. Talos rolls no saving

throw against fire effects.

Rust Vulnerability (Ex): Talos is affected normally by rust

attacks, such as that of Dispater or a rusting grasp spell.

Alignment: Lawful evil

Advancement: 

Mammon, the lord of hells third layer, has long been a

power-hungry schemer. He is the epitome of selfishness,

greed, and lust.

The archdevil lives in a golden, jewel-encrusted palace

that some have claimed looks more like a tomb than a home.

Mammons palace is within the city of Minauros, forever

sinking into an endless, fetid swamp.

Mammons natural form was once that of a bloated pit

fiend. Although he can still adopt that form, Asmodeus has

altered him so that his natural form is now that of a Huge

serpent with a muscular humanoid torso, sporting two large

arms and a massive humanoid head. His mouth has pointed

teeth and two large snake fangs.

Mammons symbol is a pair of red scaled hands open and

looming over a diamond-shaped, black gem.

Combat

Mammon uses his size and power to crush his enemies, over-

whelming and overcoming them in a straightforward manner.

He enjoys charming foes into thinking he is their ally and

then betraying them with a devastating surprise attack.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, Mam-

mon can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 2d6+19 points

of bludgeoning damage.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Mammon can create an

aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise identical with a

fear spell (caster level 15th; Will DC 35 negates). If the save is

successful, that creature cannot be affected again by his fear

aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu are immune to the aura.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Mammon hits a Medium-size or

smaller opponent with a tail slap attack, he deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus

+55). If he hits with the tail slap, he can also constrict in the

same round. Mammon has the option to conduct the grap-

ple normally, or simply use his tail to hold the opponent

(20 penalty on grapple check, but Mammon is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check he makes during successive rounds automatically

deals tail slap damage.

Poison (Ex): Mammon delivers his poison (Fortitude save

DC 39) with each successful bite attack. The initial and sec-

ondary damage is the same (1d6 points of Constitution drain).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, charm mon-

ster, desecrate, detect good, detect magic, discern location, dispel

magic, enthrall, fireball, hellfire storm, hold person, magic circle

tion, teleport without error, unholy aura, unhallow, wall of fire;

1/dayphantasmal thief, symbol (hopelessness), wish. Caster

level 20th; save DC 18 + spell level.

Touch of Greed (Su): Any creature

that Mammon touches with his

hands must make a success-

ful Will save (DC 35) or be

overcome  with  greed.  The

creature attacks another ran-

dom creature within 60 feet (pos-

sibly Mammon) and attempts to

take its valuables as soon as pos-

sible.  This  effect  lasts  for  1d4

rounds, and it is otherwise treated

as a suggestion. Mammon can re-

frain from using this effect when

he desires.

Alternate Form (Su): At will,

Mammon can take the form of a

pit fiend as if using a shapechange

spell. This alternate form lasts

indefinitely.

Baatezu Traits: Mammon

can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature

within 100 feet that has

a language. In addition,

he can see perfectly in dark-

ness of any kind, even that cre-

ated by a deeper darkness spell. Mammon is immune to fire and

poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and cold resistance 20.

Regeneration (Ex): Mammon takes normal damage

from holy and blessed weapons of at least +4 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Three times per day, Mammon can

automatically summon 4 barbazu or hamatulas. Alterna-

tively, he can attempt to summon 3 cornugons, 2 gelugons,

or 1 pit fiend with an 80% chance of success.

Feats: *Mammon is unable to use his Multiattack feat in

his normal form because he lacks the requisite three natural

weapons. He can use it in his pit fiend form.

Possessions: Mammon uses a Gargantuan +4 shortspear.

The Goals of Mammon

Mammon lusts for powerhe craves a station and position

above the one he currently holds, for he has no affection for

Minauros, the layer he currently rules. Once the ally of Dispa-

ter and Mephistopheles, he was quick to betray them both at

the end of the Reckoning, and thus no archdevil trusts him.

To hang onto his current position, it is said that Mammon

had to embarrassingly throw himself at Asmodeuss feet.

Asmodeus changed Mammons form, either to punish him

or as a sign that Mammon had changed his ways and would

not betray Asmodeus again.

Currently, Mammon seeks support in the form of cultists,

servants, and allies. Although most of the major players in

the Nine Hells will not listen to his entreaties, some of the

second-tier beings of influence, such as the witch-queen

Zbavra, have entered into Mammons court.

The Cult of Mammon

Cultists worshiping Mammon look upon him as

a patron of greed and lust. His followers can be

found among the selfish and cruel of most hu-

manoid races, as well as nonhumanoids such

as beholders, mind flayers, and evil dragons.

Temples of Mammon traditionally display

vast wealth and audacious treasuresand

have the appropriate guards, wards, and

traps to defend them. Altars to Mammon

are normally covered in gold and jewels.

When a sacrifice is killed and offered to

Mammon, it is done with a golden or

jeweled blade.

Clerics affiliated with Mammon, called cov-

etors, wear red robes with gold trim and a lot of

gold jewelry. They usually have access to the

Diabolic, Evil, and Greed domains. Most of these

individuals  are  very  wealthy,  having  gained

a  great  deal  of  money  and  power  from  evil

schemes, exploitation, and coercion.

Cultists: Dorban Smokestone lives in a

dwarf community and uses his family

fortune to pay thieves and assassins to

further his own position by eliminat-

ing his enemies. Ruulam, on the other

hand, is an outcast from mind flayer

society  and  lives  among  drow,

teaching them the ways of Mam-

mon and playing upon their greed.

The Servants of Mammon

This archdevil has a diabolic army, made up mostly of osy-

luths and hamatulas, commanded by gelugons. He also com-

mands a small unit of powerful mind flayers that serve as

information-gatherers for him. Mammon owns a nightmare

with maximum hit points and a pack of larger than normal

hell hounds. He takes these creatures with him when he

adopts pit fiend form and hunts within his domain.

Zbavra began as a cleric of Hextor, and eventually came to

the Nine Hells to serve Hextor directly. However, she got

caught up in the politics of hell and soon found that her lust

for power and influence got her far in the hierarchy. In fact,

she soon found herself one of the most influential mortals in

all of hell. Now she has thrown in with Mammon, hoping

that an allegiance with an archdevil will get her even farther.

She lives in Minauros and attends Mammons court regularly.

mable materials within the cone. Hell hounds can use their

breath weapons while biting.

damage but takes double damage from cold unless a saving

throw for half damage is allowed. In that case, the creature

takes half damage on a success and double damage on a

failure.

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A hell hound receives a +5 racial bonus on Hide

Advancement: 

Technically, the Lady Fierna rules the fourth layer of the Pit,

known as Phlegethos. Most devils know, however, that

Belial, her father and the former ruler of the layer, actually

runs things from behind the scenes. Fierna has gained a rep-

utation as an insatiable consumer of males with little care or

discrimination. Her father is really no better, quenching his

dark needs often with captives, slaves, or other devils. Some

say that Fierna and Belials relationship has been consum-

mated in incestuous ways.

Fierna dwells in a flaming palace of rough rock, deep cav-

erns, and pools of magma. At its heart lie elegant halls of

marble and a bejeweled decor. No one except Fierna and

her closest companions are allowed here, for this is where

her father spends all his time.

Both Fierna and her father are tall, dark humanoids with

small horns on their forehead. Both are quite handsome and

sexual, with smoldering red eyes. They dress in regal finery.

Belial always carries his ranseur, but Fierna never wields a

weapon, relying on her flame blade attack.

The symbol that both often use is a pair of red glowing

eyes over a horizontally positioned ranseur, with the whole

thing circled by a red tail ending in a wicked barb.

Combat

The statistics and ability descriptions are for both Belial and

Fierna, except where noted. Fierna typically enters battle

with fire shield and magic circle against good active. Belial

favors his ranseur and goes into a fight with see invisibility,

magic circle against good, and unholy aura active.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Belial and Fierna can

create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise

identical with fear cast by a 15th-level caster (save DC 42). If

the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again

by this fear aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu are immune to

the aura.

can  communicate  telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet

that has a language. In addition,

they can see perfectly in darkness

of any kind, even that created by a

deeper  darkness  spell.  Belial  and

Fierna are immune to fire and poison,

and they each have acid resistance

20 and cold resistance 20.

Regeneration (Ex): Belial and

Fierna take normal damage from

holy and blessed weapons of at least

+4 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Three times

per day, either Belial or Fierna can

automatically summon 5 barbazu or

hamatulas. Alternatively, Belial (but

not Fierna) can summon 1 pit fiend.

Possessions: Belials +4 ranseur is a

minor artifact that causes those

it strikes to feel wracking pains

that drain 2 points of Dexterity. A successful hit

also imposes a 4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and

ability checks (Fort DC 24 negates). The latter effect must be

removed by a heal or break enchantment spell.

The Goals of Belial/Fierna

Fierna has no interest in ruling, gaining power, or taking

part in the complicated politics of hell. Instead, she is much

more interested in taking advantage of her position and

wealth to live an existence of comfort and pleasure. Thus,

152

she is not at all resentful that her father actually does all the

work and she simply says what he wants her to.

Belial was the enemy of Geryon and Moloch, both of

whom  were  deposed  in  the  Reckoning.  He  also  hates

Mammon. However, he currently has his sights set on the

fifth and sixth layers of hell. He feels that if he can overcome

Levistus, the Hag Countess will be easily defeated soon after.

Belial has been an ally of Baalzebul over the centuries and

even through the Reckoning. They keep their relationship

more of a secret nowadays, but Belial would come to Baalze-

buls side if he needed him. Should this ever happen, how-

ever, Mephistopheles would probably attempt to use Fierna

against her fathereither as an ally or, if that is impossible,

a hostage.

The Cult of Belial/Fierna

No  one  worships  Fierna,  but  a  few  mortals  pay

homage to Belial. They see him as patron of domina-

tion, secrets, trickery, and seduc-

tion.  His  symbols  are  a  two-

pronged ranseur and a hand-

some male face with dark

features and small horns.

Clerics affiliated with

Belial usually have access

to the Trickery, Knowledge,

and Evil domains, and they some-

times use his favored weapon, the

ranseur. They  dress  in  red  and

black. Male clerics, which pre-

dominate, favor thin beards.

Temples to Belial are usually in

elegant towers or marble halls,

where the appearance of deco-

rum and elegance can be main-

tained.  Belials  bloodstained

altars  are  circular  and  sur-

rounded  by  black  and  red

candles.

Cultists: Dinbar is a maso-

chist who enjoys kidnapping fe-

male  gnomes  and  then  forcing

them  to  inflict  pain  upon  him  in

deviant  sexual  scenarios. Then  he

murders and dismembers them. He

is a loner and otherwise keeps to

MC

himself.

The Servants of Belial/Fierna

Gazra is Fiernas constant companion and consort. While

she luxuriates in magma-filled pools, he goes about many

of the mundane affairs of state that she ignores. Levistus

through his servantshas attempted to convert Gazra to

his camp on many occasions. Eventually, the pit fiend

might indeed succumb to the temptations offered by Lev-

istus. For now, he is loyal to Fierna. Should she ever turn

her affections from him, however, things could change.

Gazra is jealous and hateful toward Belial, but he keeps

those feelings hidden.

is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by

Gazras fear aura for 24 hours. Other baatezu are immune to

the aura.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Gazra hits a Medium-size or

smaller opponent with a tail slap attack, he deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +45). If he hits with the tail slap, he can also con-

strict. Gazra has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use his tail to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but Gazra is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check he

makes during successive rounds automatically deals tail

slap damage.

Poison (Ex): Gazra delivers his poison (Fortitude save

DC 30) with each successful bite attack. The initial damage

is 1d6 points of Constitution damage; the secondary

damage is death.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, blasphemy,

charm person, create undead, desecrate, detect good, detect magic,

dispel magic, fireball, hold person, improved invisibility, magic

circle against good, major image, produce flame, polymorph self,

pyrotechnics, suggestion, teleport without error (self plus 50

pounds of objects only), unholy aura, unhallow, wall of fire;

1/daymeteor swarm, symbol (any). Caster level 17th; save

DC 13 + spell level.

Once per year Gazra can use wish. Caster level 20th.

Baatezu Traits: Gazra can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. In

addition, he can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even

that created by a deeper darkness spell. Gazra is immune to

fire and poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and cold

resistance 20.

Outsider Traits: Gazra cannot be raised or resurrected.

Regeneration (Ex): Gazra takes normal damage from

holy and blessed weapons of at least +3 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day, Gazra can automat-

ically  summon  2  lemures,  osyluths,  or  barbazu,  or  1

erinyes, cornugon, or gelugon.

Advancement: 

Prince Levistus (as he calls himself ) is an ancient being. He

ruled the fifth layer of hell, Stygia, for eons. He was known

throughout many planes as a swordsman of great prowess.

He ended many conflicts with a personal duel, always result-

ing in the death of his opponent. Levistus was a schemer and

betrayer as wellthe rogue archdevil, as he was sometimes

called, had no allies. Yet still his power was great.

In the dim recesses of the past, Levistus attempted to turn

the consort of Asmodeus, a devil named Bensozia, against

her lover. When she refused, Levistus slew her.

Not surprisingly, when Asmodeus discovered what Levis-

tus had done, he was enraged. He imprisoned Levistus in

the ice of Stygia. Most thought that they would never see

the prince again. A devil named Geryon took his place in

Stygia and ruled there for centuries.

Eventually, Geryon was deposed during the Reckoning

and Asmodeus put Levistus back in control of Stygia. He did

not, however, free Levistus from his icy prison. Now Levis-

tus rules from within the ice, held motionless, an ironic end

for one who prided himself on his dexterity and grace.

Though he is not visible beneath the massive glacier that

imprisons him, Levistus appears as a 6-foot-tall humanoid

with extremely pale skin, dark hair, and a goatee. He could

almost pass for a human except for his all-black eyes and

pointed teeth. Back in his day, Levistus wore loose, silky

finery and carried a glistening rapier.

Though it was different once, today Levistuss symbol is a

thin sword thrust into a block of ice.

Combat

To fight Levistus, at least in the standard way, foes must

somehow get to him. Presumably, this would mean freeing

him from his imprisonment. While he is trapped in the ice,

the only abilities that Levistus can use are summon baatezu,

clairvoyance/clairaudience, demand, major image, scrying, unholy

aura, and wish. He cannot move or make physical attacks of

any kind while trapped in the ice. He effectively has no

Strength or Dexterity score while trapped.

Amnesia Touch (Su): If Levistus makes a successful

touch attack against a foe, the foe must make a Will save (DC

35) or forget all details of her past (skills are not lost, just

memories). Furthermore, the target is stunned for 1d4+1

rounds. If the save succeeds, only the last years worth of

memories are erased and the target is stunned for 1 round. A

greater restoration spell will restore memories lost in this way.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, charm monster,

clairvoyance/clairaudience, demand, desecrate, detect good, detect

magic, dispel magic, enthrall, ice storm, hold person, locate creature,

locate object, magic circle against good, major image, scrying, see

invisibility, suggestion, teleport without error, unholy aura, unhal-

low, wall of ice; 1/daysymbol (pain), wish. Caster level 20th;

save DC 19 + spell level.

Acrobatic Attack (Ex): If Levistus attacks by jumping at

least 5 feet into his opponent, jumps down at least 5 feet onto

his opponent, or swings on a rope or similar object into his

opponent, he gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Baatezu Traits: Levistus can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language. In

addition, he can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even

that created by a deeper darkness spell. Levistus is immune to

fire and poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and cold resist-

ance 20.

Elaborate Parry (Ex): If Levistus chooses to fight defen-

sively or take a full defense action in combat, he gains a +8

dodge  bonus  to  his  Armor  Class  beyond  the  bonuses

granted by those actions.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally

allows Levistus to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half

damage (such as a fireball), he takes no damage with a suc-

cessful saving throw.

Precise Strike (Ex): Levistus has the ability to strike pre-

cisely with a light, one-handed piercing weapon, adding +2d6

to his normal damage roll. When making a precise strike, Lev-

istus cannot attack with a weapon in his other hand.

Regeneration (Ex): Levistus takes normal damage from

holy and blessed weapons of at least +4 enhancement.

Spell Parry (Su): This ability functions as the spell turning

spell (caster level 10th). Levistus can use this ability once

per day.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day Levistus can automati-

cally summon 2 gelugons, or he can attempt to summon 1 pit

fiend with an 85% chance of success. Levistus can force the

summoned devils to appear anywhere he can see, including

places he sees through scrying or clairvoyance.

Possessions: Levistus had a +4 rapier when he was imprisoned.

If he escapes, hell undoubtedly seek a more potent blade.

The Goals of Levistus

Levistus wants more than anything else to be free of his

frozen prison. The mountain of ice that he is trapped within

is almost a half-mile across. From the outside, he is simply a

black spot within the ice. The ice trapping Levistus cannot

be affected by a wish or miracle. Levistus cannot teleport or

be summoned out of the ice in any way. The ice must be

destroyed, either by physically

chipping and smashing at it

or by melting it with fire

(including  magical  fire).

Levistus  hates  all  the

other lords of hell, and they

hate him. Were he ever to

gain his freedom, Levistus

would  most  likely  work

toward  some  scheme  that

would  be  detrimental  to

allparticularly Asmodeus.

Levistus is not particularly

grateful  to  Asmodeus  for

giving him back control of

Stygia. He cannot see beyond

his  need  for  revenge  over

being imprisoned in the first

place.

The Cult of Levistus

Levistuss  cult  of  thugs  and

rogues has always been fairly

small.  He  is  a  patron  of  ven-

geance and betrayal. His fol-

lowers rarely gather together,

and thus there are few temples.

Most clerics actually carry mate-

rials  with  them  to  serve  as  a

portable shrine. These materials

always include a small iron cauldron

in which they boil water and drop

chunks of ice as part of the ceremony.

Clerics who favor Levistus, also called bladeravers, rarely

look like priests. They wear flamboyant, silky garb and carry

the archdevils favored weapon, a rapier. They look more like

swashbucklers than religious zealots. The Evil, Diabolic, and

Trickery domains are common among clerics who have Lev-

istus as their patron.

The Servants of Levistus

Erridon Alaka is a gelugon sorcerer. He and Zanth, a half-fiend

rogue, along with a hellcat named Trinity, serve as Levistuss

hands and voice beyond the solid ice he is trapped within.

Through an arcane ritual, Erridon and Levistus are linked tele-

pathically at all times. Erridon tells Zanth what Levistus

wants, and they interact with others on the archdevils behalf.

Zanth eats only the flesh of good-aligned children, a rare

commodity in hell. Thus, his one weakness is the minor

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground

Organization: Solitary or mounted on nightmare

Challenge Rating: 22

Treasure: Standard

Alignment: Lawful evil

Advancement: 

The Hag Countess is different from every other archdevil in

at least two ways. First, she is not a baatezu but a night hag.

Second, she is aloof and unpredictable, less lawful than the

other archdevils but just as evil.

The Hag Countess was the lover of the previous

ruler of the sixth layer, Moloch. When he was

cast down by Asmodeus, she took his place.

Most  believe  that  the  Hag  Countess  set

Moloch up, and it is possible that he will

return for revenge someday.

Like the lesser night hags she considers

sisters, the Hag Countess rides a nightmare.

The Hag Countesss citadel is known as

one of the surest (and most expensive)

places to get a large amount of souls

in all the Nine Hells.

The Hag Countess looks like a

hideously  ugly  female  human

with  flesh  the  color  of  a  deep

bruise, covered with warts, blis-

ters,  and  open  sores.  Unlike

normal night hags, she has ratty,

tattered, black-feathered wings

on her back, making her look

like some terrible reverse-image

of an angel. Her eyes shine with a

hellish red light, and her fetid

breath stinks of rotten meat.

Her symbol is a pair of black-

feathered  wings  on  a  white

background.

Combat

In battle, the Hag Countess relies

heavily on her greatsword. She does not

have the ability to haunt the dreams of mortals as

normal night hags do, but she does have a far greater range

of spell-like abilities, gained from dark lore learned while

inhabiting the Hells for so long. Unlike other night hags,

the Hag Countess does not have a heartstone.

JE

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by the Hag Countesss bite

attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 33) or contract

demon fever. The incubation period is 1 day, and the disease

deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Each day thereafter,

on a failed save, the creature must immediately succeed at

another Fortitude save or take 1 point of Constitution drain

(see Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, blasphemy, des-

ecrate, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic,

devils ego, evil eye, fireball, greater dispelling, insanity, magic missile,

meteor swarm, polymorph self, ray of enfeeblement, see invisibility,

sleep, teleport without error, unholy aura, unhallow; 1/day

symbol (any). Caster level 20th; save DC 19 + spell level.

Immunities (Ex): The Hag Countess is immune to fire

and cold, and to charm, sleep, and fear effects.

Outsider Traits: The Hag Countess has darkvision (60-

foot range). She cannot be raised or resurrected.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day the Hag Countess

can automatically summon 3d4 lemures, 1d2 erinyes or

hamatulas, or 1 cornugon, gelugon, or pit fiend.

Possessions: The Hag Countess uses a +5 bloodfeeding flaming

greatsword with great skill.

The Goals of the Hag Countess

The Hag Countess may be the physically

weakest of the archdevils. Many of the

other archdevils worked their way up

through the ranks. Unlike them, the

Hag Countess did not achieve her posi-

tion through strength, but purely

through guile. Her power is signif-

icant, but it does not approach

that of her peers.

:

She does, however, possess a

significant amount of military

might.  Moloch  left  the  Hag

Countess in command of a vast

army  of  devils  and  hell

hounds that never ceases

moving about the sixth layer.

Right now, her major goal is

solidifying her own power

base.

The Cult of the

Hag Countess

There is no cult of the Hag

Countess. No one reveres her

as a god, seeks patronage from

her, or makes sacrifices in her

name . . . yet.

The Servants of the Hag Countess

The Hag Countess lives in a stronghold within a

gigantic boulder that rolls down the endless slopes

of her layer of hell. She keeps a coven of three night hags, all

with maximum hit points, in her strange palace at all times,

as well as a number of annises, green hags, and medusas.

She has a stable full of nightmares. Her favorite, Blood-

curdle, is one of great might and power.

One of the mightiest of the archdevils, Baalzebul is known as

the Lord of the Flies, Lord of Lies, the Fallen One, and, more

158

recently, the Slug Archduke. Originally an archon named

Triel who dwelt in the good-aligned planes, Baalzebul suc-

cumbed to temptation, craving more power and authority

than Heaven would grant him. His quest for perfection took

him too far, and he was blinded by ambition. Soon he found

himself in hell in a new form: a tall, powerful, dark-skinned

humanoid with the compound eyes of a fly.

Baalzebul, as he started to call himself, quickly gathered a

great deal of support and power, as well as the blessing of

Asmodeus. He set himself up as an archdevil and ruled Mal-

adomini, the seventh layer. He quickly became a rival of

Mephistopheles, and thus Dispater as well. He also gained

some allies, notably Belial.

After the Reckoning, Baalzebul fell from Asmodeuss

favor and was cursed with a different formthat of a giant

slug with tiny, malformed arms, flies buzzing and crawling

around him continuously. The stench around Baalzebul is

infamous; the curse causes stinking piles of rotting garbage

and feces to accumulate wherever he spends time. So now

the Slug Archduke lives in his Palace of Filth under the

blue-black skies of Maladomini, plotting revenge.

Baalzebul has many symbols, including a flys head, a web

with flies caught in it, and a black slug sitting atop a throne.

Combat

Baalzebuls arms are inadequate for grasping objects, let

alone wielding weapons. He must have servants feed

him and carry out tasks such as turning the pages of

books and opening doors. In combat he uses his gnarled

limbs and his supernatural abilities (withering touch, insect

gorge, and his gaze attack) before resorting to spells.

Fear and Weakness Gaze (Su): Baalzebul may use a gaze

attack with a range of 50 feet. Anyone subject to the gaze must

make two Will saving throws (DC 42). The first is to resist

the fear effect, and the other is to resist a ray of enfeeble-

ment effect (both as the spells; caster level 20th). Baalzebuls

gaze attack cannot function in the cloud of insects created

by his insect gorge ability.

Insect Gorge (Su): Once every 1d6 rounds, Baalzebul can

disgorge a cloud of biting flies as a breath weapon. These

insects cover a 60-foot cone and deal 20d6 points of damage

(Reflex DC 42 half ). After 1 round, the insects disperse

unless Baalzebul wishes otherwise. In such a case, the

insects form a cloud in a 25-foot radius around Baalzebul for

up to 10 rounds. Concealment within the cloud is total, and

any living creature (other than Baalzebul) takes 10d6 points

of damage in each round spent in the cloud (no save).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, blasphemy,

charm monster, create greater undead, desecrate, detect good, detect

magic, devils ego, fireball, fiendish quickening, geas/quest, greater

dispelling, greater scrying, hold monster, insect plague, magic circle

against good, major image, restoration, resurrection, suggestion,

summon swarm, teleport without error, tongue of Baalzebul, true

seeing,  unholy  blight,  unhallow,  unholy  aura,  wall  of  eyes;

1/daycrushing fist of spite, symbol (pain or insanity), wish.

Caster level 20th; save DC 23 + spell level.

Withering Touch (Su): Baalzebuls touch forces a target

to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 42) or be affected

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:32 AM  Page 159

as if by a wither limb spell from a 20th-level caster. Baalzebul

chooses which limb to wither.

Baatezu Traits: Baalzebul can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

In addition, he can see perfectly in darkness of any kind,

even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Baalzebul is

immune to fire and poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and

cold resistance 20.

Outsider Traits: Baalzebul cannot be raised or resur-

rected.

Regeneration (Ex): Baalzebul takes normal damage from

holy and blessed weapons of at least +4 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per day Baalzebul can auto-

matically summon 1d6+2 cornugons, 1d4+1 gelugons, or

1d3 pit fiends.

Skills: As Lord of Lies, Baalzebul (even with his disgust-

ing appearance) gains a +10 inherent bonus on Bluff, Diplo-

macy, and Sense Motive checks.

The Goals

of Baalzebul

Baalzebul has

many  desires.

He opposes Meph-

istopheles in all things

and would love to see him

fall. With the Lord of the Eighth out

of the way, Baalzebul would be the

greatest of the dukes of hell, second only to Asmodeus

himself. Belial still calls himself an ally of Baalzebul,

andalthough that archdevil has concerns and schemes

of his ownBaalzebul could call upon Belial should he

ever be in need. If the reverse is true, then Baalzebul

would be sure to help Belial, assuming that Baalzebul

could figure out some way to make the situation work to

his advantage.

LGW

Baalzebul would like to return to his normal form. But

more than that, he would like to avenge himself against

Asmodeus himself for his defeat and humiliation during

the Reckoning. Currently, he attempts to place more and

more of his spies and servants into the court of the Lord of

the Ninth.

The Cult of Baalzebul

Baalzebul has a more sizable following than most other arch-

devils. Mortals are attracted to his doctrine of lies and charm

backed up with deadly force. The most numerous of the

races represented among his cult are bugbears, who appreci-

ate the dual nature of Baalzebul as someone who represents

both guile and violence.

Temples of Baalzebul are dark shrines filled with statu-

ary. Lintels, altars, and tapestries display an insect motif,

and braziers burn foul-smelling incense (or sometimes

just offal) to represent his new form. Like most archdevils,

Baalzebul demands living sacrifices from his cultists in

bloody ceremonies that must take place at night in dim

candlelight.

Clerics affiliated with Baalzebul wear blue and black and

favor gold jewelry and body piercings. They often shave

their heads, except for bugbear adherents to the faith, who

grow their hair particularly long. Such clerics typically have

access to the Diabolic, Trickery, and War domains. Baalze-

buls favored weapon is the morningstar.

Cultists: Agni-nyahl is a typical bugbear cleric, operating

out of a crude cave that serves his bloodthirsty, evil tribe. He

attempts to leave curious signs around the cave entrance to

lure potential sacrifices inside: a few coins, a torn bit of

bloody cloth, or something else that piques curiosity.

Israkahn, a female tiefling, is a con artist, gambler, and

thief. She has no temple or flock, but she serves Baalzebul on

her own by killing men that she seduces with

promises of passion. She never

calls herself the Liar, obvi-

ously, but in places where

she spends time, she gains

the reputation of being able to

convince a dragon it cant fly.

Sammael, a male human, leads

a cult of Baalzebul that controls an

entire city. This dark place of ziggurat temples

and charnel pits teems with drugs, debauchery,

and bloody murder. He has a reputation as a rapist

who cares not whether his victims are living or

dead and an abuser of children and animals.

A terrible sadist and drug abuser, he is

addicted to mushroom powder.

dSammael: Male human Clr 13; CR 13; Medium-size

Baalzebul has a number of otyughs wandering about his

palace that he tolerates because they eat the feces that other-

wise threatens to consume the place due to Asmodeuss

curse. A large number of ghargatulas (see Chapter 8) roam

the premises as well, acting as personal guards to the Lord of

the Flies. Baalzebul also has three pit fiend bodyguards

Teurn, Wysturak, and Yaghoqall of whom have maximum

hit points and wear rings of protection +4.

The Nyashk is the heart of Baalzebuls army. It consists of

sixteen female fiendish bugbear sorcerers, each wielding a

harrow rod. Each of the Nyashk wears a special helmet

designed to look like the head of a giant fly. These warriors

move as a wedge of unbelievable might on the battlefield,

spewing acid from their rods and casting devastating spells

such as cone of cold and disintegrate.

Vashaak Ratoth Bruu is the offspring of one of the Hag

Countesss most powerful medusa servants. She presented

Baalzebul with Vashaak as a gift in an attempt to forge an

alliance. The alliance is not yet formed, but Baalzebul has

become  somewhat  enchanted  with  the  male  medusa.

Vashaak is now the chief handservant of the archdevil, serv-

ing as his hands in all sorts of tasks, many of them unsavory

even by Vashaaks standards. Vashaak wears an iron mask to

hide his petrifying gaze and keeps his snakes wrapped in a

single iron chain atop his head. The mask and the chains can

be shed very quickly (as a free action) if Vashaak needs to

enter battle.

Mephistopheles is an archdevil who has long held a great

deal of power in hell. He is allied with Dispater and a bitter

rival of Baalzebul. Mephistopheles rules over the frozen

wastes of Cania, the eighth layer of hell. As such, he has

become immune to cold by ruthlessly expos-

ing himself to the most frigid temperatures

on Cania.

Mephistopheles displays a faade of charm,

civility, and understated wit. Secretly, he has a

terrible temper and flies into fre-

quent rages while in his palace in

Caniaa citadel called Mephistar,

built on a massive glacier on the

frigid layer. From there Mephis-

topheles commands legions of

gelugons, including the vast army

that  does  nothing  but  guard  the

entrance to Nessus, the bottom of

the pit where Asmodeus dwells.

Of late, Mephistar has become a

place of scorching flame at the heart

of the icy plain, however, and the gelu-

gons have slowly relocated elsewhere,

replaced by pit fiends, cornugons, and

barbazu. Mephistopheles has developed

an extremely hot, corrupt type of energy

known as hellfire, tapped from the sub-

stance  of  the  plane  itself.  Its  use  has

spread through many of the archdevils

and their servants. None are as adept with

hellfire as Mephistopheles, however. To

further his mastery of fire, he has

taken  up  the  study  of  wizardry,

specifically evocation. Mephistoph-

eles is quickly gaining a reputation as

an archdevil of contradictions.

Nine feet tall, with hell-red skin,

bat wings, white eyes, horns jut-

ting  from  his  forehead,  and

straight, black hair, Mephistophe-

les plays up his appearance to be

as consummately diabolical as possible. He swathes himself

in flowing black capes and wields a three-pronged ranseur.

Mephistopheles constantly adopts new symbols. His cur-

rent one is a red hand with black fingernails shrouded in

dark flames.

Combat

Mephistopheles prefers to use his spells and spell-like abili-

ties rather than engage in melee. Calling upon other devils

to fight for him, he usually takes a position in the rear and

rains fire and destruction upon his enemies. He is quick to

teleport away if faced with any real threat.

Flames of Hell: Mephistopheles is continually swathed

in dark flames. As such, his touch deals 2d6 points of unholy

damage. Furthermore, anyone within 5 feet of the archdevil

takes damage from the flames if Mephistopheles desires it.

Spells: Mephistopheles casts spells as a 15th-level wizard

tional +1d6 points of damage.

The Goals of Mephistopheles

Mephistopheles wants now what he has always wanted: to

rule the Nine Hells. Of all the schemers in helland there

are manyhe is the most open about his goals. Mephis-

topheles has said to Asmodeuss face that he will one day

rule in his stead. Because he is more openly antagonistic

toward Baalzebul, Asmodeus has usually tolerated Mephis-

topheless obvious coveting of his dark throne.

Mephistopheless schemes are always extreme and dra-

matic, rather than subtle and sly like those of some of the

other archdevils. For example, before the Reckoning, he cre-

ated a new persona for himself, Molikroth, then deposed

Mephistopheles and ruled in Molikroths name. Many specu-

lated that the reason for the deception was to ferret out trai-

tors in his midst. Those that helped Molikroth overthrow

Mephistopheles have all been eliminated now.

Mephistopheles adores being worshiped as a god and at

the moment is striving to increase his base of cultists on the

Material Plane.

The Cult of Mephistopheles

The cult of Mephistopheles is small, probably because many

mortals do not realize that Asmodeus and Mephistopheles are

different beings. Nevertheless, the archdevil has some fol-

lowers, particularly from a new religion his cultists are

trying to promotethe worship of a god of hellfire. This

religion attracts both disaffected devil-worshipers and those

who revere fire.

Mephistopheless temples are filled with fire pits, usually

rigged so that they flare up suddenly at appropriate times.

The altar is a large slab of stone, blackened because the sac-

rifices made upon it are burned alive.

Clerics affiliated with Mephistopheles, called hellfire

stewards or hellfire masters, wear black and red and wield

ranseurs. They generally do not speak, and when they must

speak, they shout. They generally have access to the Dia-

bolic, Evil, and Fire domains.

Cultists: Nhagruul is the leader of a group of giants that

revere Mephistopheles. Her temple is guarded by hell

hounds and a pair of Large fire elementals brought to the

temple with the lesser planar ally spell. She plans to lead her

people out of the hills where they live to destroy the nearby

human and elf settlements. But first she has to overthrow the

local fire giant king, who neither worships her god nor

shares her vision. Until she is ready to take over, she leads

prayers for a small cabal of giant disciples of Mephistopheles.

attack rolls when throwing rocks (already included in the

above statistics). She can throw rocks weighing 40 to 50

pounds each (Small objects) up to five range increments

(range increment 120 feet).

Fire Subtype (Ex): Nhagruul is immune to fire damage

but takes double damage from cold unless a saving throw for

half damage is allowed. In that case, she takes half damage

on a success and double damage on a failure.

Rock Catching (Ex): Nhagruul can catch Small, Medium-

size, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per

round, she can make a Reflex save to catch a rock or similar

projectile that would normally hit her. The DC for the save is

15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium-size rock, or 25 for a

Large rock. If the projectile has a bonus on attack rolls

because of magic, the DC increases by that amount. Nhagruul

must be ready for and aware of the attack.

The Servants of Mephistopheles

Songs of praise always fill the throne room of Mephistophe-

les. The voice behind them is that of Antilia, a darkly beauti-

ful half-fiend elf bard with red bat wings and red skin like

her master. Antilia is Mephistopheless daughter, but no one

in the court knows that. She has led Baalzebul to believe that

she works for him as a spy in Mephistar, but in fact she is

double-crossing him and feeding him incorrect information.

Testaron is a new arrival at the court of Mephistopheles.

Bribed with vast amounts of treasure, this dragon has come

from the Material Plane to make Mephistopheless throne

room seem more forbidding. His job is to lounge about the

vast hall and look fearsome. So far, its working.

Mephistopheles also commands a vast number of ex-

tremely powerful devils, including, of course, the 9,999 gel-

ugons that reportedly guard the gates to Nessus.

Breath Weapon (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, Testaron can

breathe a 60-ft. cone of fire that deals 16d10 points of fire

damage (Reflex DC 31 half ).

Crush (Ex): When flying, Testaron can land on Medium-

size or smaller opponents as a standard action, using his

whole body to crush them. A crush attack affects as many

creatures as can fit under Testarons body. Each creature in

the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC 31) or be

pinned, automatically taking 4d6+25 points of bludgeoning

damage. Thereafter, if Testaron chooses to maintain the pin,

treat it as a normal grapple attack. While pinned, the oppo-

nent takes crush damage each round.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Testaron can unsettle foes with

his mere presence. This ability takes effect automatically

within a 240-foot radius whenever Testaron attacks, charges,

or flies overhead. A potentially affected creature (one with

less than 28 HD) that succeeds at a Will save (DC 30)

remains immune to Testarons frightful presence for 24

hours.  On  a  failure,  any  creature  with  4  or  fewer  HD

becomes panicked for 4d6 rounds, and any with more than

5 HD becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. Testaron is immune

to the frightful presence ability of other dragons.

Spell-Like Abilities: 8/daylocate object; 3/daysugges-

tion. Caster level 11th; save DC 16 + spell level.

Tail Sweep: Testaron can sweep with his tail as a standard

action. The sweep affects Small or smaller creatures within a

20-foot-radius half-circle centered on his rear. Each affected

creature that fails a Reflex save (DC 31) takes 2d6+25 points

of damage; a successful save halves the damage.

Blindsight (Ex): Testaron can ascertain creatures by non-

visual means (mostly hearing and scent, but also by noticing

vibrations and other environmental clues) at a range of 240 feet.

Fire Subtype (Ex): Testaron is immune to fire damage

the other hand, some reports claim that he is indeed the

original, primal force of evil in the multiverse.

The actions of Asmodeus are often mysterious to outside

observers, but that is due to the short-sighted and dim-witted

view most beings have. Asmodeuss manipulations are

labyrinthine and insidious. They work on a grand scale,

although when it suits his needs he is willing to focus his

attention even on the status of a lowly mortal soul.

During the Reckoning, Asmodeus showed that he could

take on virtually all the other archdevils in hell and arise tri-

umphant when the smoke clears. His will alone dictates

who rules the various layers of hell. Once a year, he gathers

the archdevils together in his home in Nessus, a fortress

called Malsheem. None has ever refused this call. Even Lev-

istus is briefly freed from his imprisonment to attend (and

sulk through) this gathering.

Asmodeus stands just over 13 feet tall, with lustrous dark

skin and dark hair. He is handsome in the same way that a

thunderstorm is beautiful. His red eyes shine with the power

of hell, and his head is crowned with a pair of small, dark red

horns. He dresses in finery of red and black; a single garment

of his might cost what an entire nation spends in a year. Of

course, he is never without his Ruby Rod, an ornate piece of

unparalleled jeweled finery and vast magical power.

Alignment: Lawful evil

Advancement: 

Asmodeus the Archfiend, the overlord of all the dukes of hell,

commands all devilkind and reigns as the undisputed master

of the Nine Hells. Even the deities that call that plane home

pay Asmodeus a great deal of respect.

Asmodeus  is  certainly  older  than  any  devil  in  hell,

although some say that he was not the planes first ruler. On

Asmodeus relies on the awesome might of his Ruby Rod

should he ever find himself engaged in combat (which would

be a rare event indeed). It is more likely that he simply forces

his foes to submit or flee with his powers. If that does not

work, he relocates to allow his servants to deal with the foes.

Chill Gaze (Su): This gaze attack (Will DC 37 negates) has

a range of 30 feet and acts as a slow spell (caster level 20th) that

also imposes a 5 penalty on all attack and damage rolls, saving

throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 24 hours.

Fear and Weakness Gaze (Su): This gaze attack (Will DC

37 negates) has a range of 60 feet and acts as a fear spell

(caster level 20th) that also deals 1d4 points of Strength

damage to creatures that fail their save. Asmodeus can use

this or his chill gaze in a given round (but not both).

Demand Submission (Su): Once per round as a standard

action, Asmodeus can force any single creature who can hear

and understand his voice to attempt a Will saving throw (DC

37). If the creature fails, it submits to the ruler of hell for

10d10 days, doing whatever Asmodeus asks as if every request

of his was a suggestion against which the target cannot resist

with a saving throw. Once a creature succeeds at a saving

throw against this ability, it is forever immune to the effect.

The Goals of Asmodeus

First and foremost, Asmodeus is interested in preserving the

status quo in which he is the supreme ruler of hell. Beyond

that, he focuses most of his attention on the general spread of

evil in the multiverse. He opposes the actions of powerful

celestials and good-aligned deities. He also loathes and

opposes the demonic forces of the Abysstheir existence is a

challenge to his mastery of evil.

The Cult of Asmodeus

Someone known as a devil-worshiper is almost always a

follower of Asmodeus. The ruler of hell commands a

far larger body of cultists than any other arch-

devilprobably more than all the others com-

bined. Many humanoids and evil creatures

revere Asmodeus as a paragon of might and

oppression.  They  see  following  him  as  a

means to great and otherwise unat-

tainable power.

Clerics who have Asmodeus as a

patron are imperious, powerful

figures with great personal mag-

netism and political influence.

Asmodeuss symbol is that of a

clawed fist gripping a skull

or the more subtle ruby-

tipped rod. Sometimes a

simple  inverted  penta-

gram  suffices.  His  tem-

ples,  usually  located  in

secret within or under a

city, are full of these sym-

bols. They are always well

appointed and well guard-

ed,  because  Asmodeus

favors his followers with

financial success.

Asmodeuss

favored

weapon is the mace. His

clerics usually have access

to the Diabolic, Evil, and

Law domains.

Baatezu Traits: Asmodeus can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

In addition, he can see perfectly in darkness of any kind,

even that created by a deeper darkness spell. Asmodeus is

immune to fire and poison, and he has acid resistance 20 and

cold resistance 20.

Outsider Traits: Asmodeus cannot be raised or resurrected.

Regeneration (Ex): Asmodeus takes normal damage

from holy and blessed weapons of at least +4 enhancement.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): At will, Asmodeus can automati-

cally summon 1 pit fiend or 2 of any other type of devil.

Possessions: Asmodeus wields the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus,

which acts as a +6 unholy greatclub that bestows an inflict crit-

ical wounds spell (caster level 20th) upon anyone it touches.

See the artifacts section of Chapter 6 for a description of the

Ruby Rods other powers.

Cultists: The male human Gilliard DeRosan exemplifies

what all clerics in Asmodeuss cult aspire to: wealth, power,

and prestige. He controls a large cult made up of wealthy

nobles and merchants who serve their dread lord at night

while pretending to be upstanding members of society by day.

The Servants of Asmodeus

Technically, all devils are the servants of Asmodeus. Never-

theless, he has some elite creatures that he utilizes. Six pow-

erful hamatula mortal hunters called the Spark Hunters

serve as his elite agents on the Material Plane.

Glasya is the daughter of Asmodeus and Bensozia, who was

killed by Levistus (hence his icy imprisonment). For a long

while, Glasya spent her days as the consort of Mammon, but

that was mostly just to stir up trouble for various archdevils,

including her father, when it struck her fancy. Now she serves

in her fathers court, but she is dissatisfied and bored with her

fate. She is about 9 feet tall, appearing to be a beautiful human

woman with bat wings and long black hair. She has coppery-

colored skin, tiny horns on her head, and a forked tail.

Martinet serves as the constable of Asmodeus, managing

many of his affairs, particularly interaction with other

devils. As such, when two powerful denizens of hell go to

war, it is up to Martinet to put a stop to it if hells master does

not wish the war to continue. While Martinet is not as pow-

erful as most archdevils, the fact that he is the mouth, eyes,

and ears of Asmodeus earns him far more respect than he

would otherwise be due. The threats and tirades of others

never impress him, and he always has a cutting retort.

Fear (Su): A creature hit by a spark hunter must succeed

at a Will save (DC 23) or be affected as the fear spell (caster

level 9th). Whether or not the save is successful, that crea-

ture cannot be affected again by that spark hunters fear abil-

ity for 24 hours.

Impale (Ex): A spark hunter deals 3d8+10 points of damage

to a grabbed opponent with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a spark hunter hits a Medium-

size or smaller opponent with a claw attack, it deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +32).

If it hits with the claw, it can also impale in the same round.

The spark hunter has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the spark hunter is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals claw damage.

Mortalbane Shout (Su): A spark hunter can, once per

day, loose a shout that stuns all mortals within 50 feet for 1

round (Fort DC 23 negates).

Slay Mortal (Su): Once per day, by touch, a spark hunter

can force a mortal to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw

(DC 23) or die instantly.

Smite Mortals (Su): Once a day, a spark hunter may

attempt to smite mortals with one normal melee attack, adding

a +2 bonus on its attack roll and deals +20 points of damage. If

the spark hunter accidentally smites a creature that is not a

mortal, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, charm person,

desecrate, doom, hold person, major image, produce flame, pyrotech-

nics, suggestion, teleport without error; 1/dayorders wrath or

unholy blight. Caster level 9th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Baatezu Traits: A spark hunter can communicate tele-

pathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a lan-

guage. In addition, it can see perfectly in darkness of any

kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell. A spark

hunter is immune to fire and poison, and it has acid resist-

ance 20 and cold resistance 20.

Claws of the Overfiend (Ex): A spark hunters claw

attack deals 2d8+7 points of damage.

Detect Mortals (Su): At will, a spark hunter can use detect

mortals. This ability duplicates the effect of the spell detect

undead, except that mortals are detected.

Favored Enemy/Mortal Hunting (Ex): These spark

hunters gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot,

and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills

against mortals and +5 when using them against humans

specifically. Likewise, they get the same bonus on weapon

damage rolls against creatures of these  types.  A  spark

hunter also gets the damage bonus with ranged weapons,

but only  against  targets  within 30 feet (the spark hunter

cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The

bonus doesnt apply to damage against creatures that are

immune to critical hits.

Mortal Skin (Su): By magically grafting bits of mortal

flesh to its own body, a spark hunter gains the ability to adopt

any mortal form as though using polymorph self. If the flesh

used is from the exact individual being imitated, the duration

is permanent. If the flesh is from a being of the same type as

the form adopted, the duration is 1 hour. If the flesh is not the

same type as the form adopted, the duration is 10 minutes.

Otherwise, this ability works as the polymorph self spell, and a

spark hunter can call upon it once per day. A spark hunter can

return to its normal form with a standard action.

Outsider Traits: A spark hunter cannot be raised or res-

urrected.

Spurn Mortal Magic (Su): A spark hunter gains a +2 bonus

on all saving throws against effects and spells used by mortals.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a spark hunter can

attempt to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of suc-

cess or 1 hamatula with a 35% chance of success.

his chapter presents a mixture of various evil mon-

sters: Demons and devils, to be sure, but undead

and other creatures as well. They should be suitable

for any campaign.

At the end of the chapter are three new templates

bone, corpse, and corruptedthat allow you to create spe-

cial evil versions of ordinary creatures.

DEMON

Demons are native to the Abyss, a realm of unmitigated

chaos and evil. They are the most violent, greedy, fickle,

and perverse of the fiends.

Some demons, not satisfied with their own iniquity, take

pleasure in tempting mortals to become as depraved as

they are. Of those presented here, the shadow demon is

most interested in such activities.

The largest and most diverse group of demons is the

tanarri, unchallenged masters of the Abyss. But demons

come in an overwhelming variety of forms, and no one has

ever cataloged them all.

Except where otherwise noted, demons speak Abyssal,

Celestial, and Draconic.

COMBAT

Demons are ferocity personified. They are willing to attack

any creatureseven other demonsjust for the sheer fun

AS

of it. Demons enjoy terrifying their victims before

slaying them, and they often devour the slain. Many

demons can create darkness, so they frequently blan-

ket their enemies with it before joining battle.

All  demons  have  the  following  abilities  in

common.

Outsider Traits: A demon has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected.

In addition, all tanarri have the following abili-

ties in common.

Tanarri Traits: Tanarri can communicate tele-

pathically with any creature within 100 feet that

has a language. Except as noted in the specific

descriptions, a tanarri is immune to electricity

and poison, and it has acid resistance 20, cold

resistance 20, and fire resistance 20.

Summon  Tanar ri

(Sp): All  tanarri  can

summon other tanarri to their aid. This ability

functions like a summon monster spell of the

appropriate level, except that it has only a lim-

ited chance of success. Roll d% and compare

the result with the creatures indicated chance

of success. On a failure, no tanarri answer the

summons.  Summoned  tanarri  automatically

return whence they came after 1 hour. A tanarri

that has just been summoned cannot use its

own summon ability for 1 hour. Most tanarri 169

do not use their summon ability lightly, since it leaves them

beholden to the summoned creatures. In general, they use it

only when necessary to save their own lives.

MANE

Formed directly from the souls of evil creatures sent to the

Abyss for eternity, manes are the lowest of the demons, even

lower than the dretches. They have no magical abilities at all

and are almost mindless. They act more like wild beasts than

anything else.

Manes are 3-foot-tall humanoids with pale, bloated flesh rid-

dled with maggots. Their white eyes show no sign of sentience,

but their claws and jagged teeth betray their feral nature.

Manes cannot speak but can understand simple concepts

spoken in any language (as a side effect of their limited use

of tanarri telepathy).

Combat

Manes are largely mindless but devoted to savagery and

fury. They obey their masters and throw themselves into

battle heedless of danger, but they are slow, stupid, and

largely ineffective combatants. As weak as they are, they can

overcome foes by their numbers.

Acidic Cloud (Ex): When a mane dies, it dissolves into a

cloud of noxious vapor. Anyone within 10 feet of a slain

mane who fails a Reflex save (DC 20) takes 1d6 points of

acid damage.

RUTTERKIN

Rough, crude, and bestial, rutterkins understand nothing

but brute force. These bullying demons are mean and cruel,

trapped in a life of never-ending pain, unhappy unless they

are inflicting violence. They roam the Abyss in gangs, avoid-

ing those more powerful and hunting those weaker (or even

a solitary powerful creature if they can gang up on it). These

demons are outcasts even in the Abyss. Of all other demons,

only the chasmes treat them as allies, and that is only

because they find rutterkins easy to master and dominate.

Rutterkin are the misshapen results of the foul and

chaotic energies that course through the Abyss, formed in a

170

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:37 AM  Page 171

process not unlike the disease known as warp touch. As

such, they are always in pain and frequently howl and gri-

mace, writhing and contorting as their corrupted bodies

mutate with no rhyme or reason. The forms the rutterkins

are cursed with are not always the most efficient, and about

10% of the time, a rutterkin encountered is so malformed

that one of its arms does not work, or its limp actually slows

its speed by 10 feet.

Standing 5 to 7 feet tall, these twisted, malformed crea-

tures usually are hunched over, walking with a stagger or

limp. Their skulls are pointed, their eyes small and vicious,

and their features asymmetrical and deformed. Their mot-

tled green and blue-violet skin is nearly hairless. No two

look exactly alike.

Combat

Rutterkins prefer the use of weapons, and a few even wear

armor. They mainly use double axes with crescent-shaped

blades, but occasionally one wields  a longsword with a ser-

rated edge (usually with a shield) or one of the weapons

described below. As demons go, rutterkins have

few spell-like or supernatu-

ral  abilities,  and  they

rarely think of valu-

able or interesting

ways of using the

abilities they

do have.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdarkness, cause fear, telekine-

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day a rutterkin can attempt

to summon 1 rutterkin with a 35% chance of success or 1

chasme with a 10% chance of success.

Rutterkin Weapons

A rutterkins double axe has the same weapon statistics as an

orc double axe. In addition, a rutterkin can use a snap-tong

or a three-armed blade.

Snap-Tong: Many rutterkins carry this Large exotic

weapon rather than a double axe. A snap-tong deals 2d6

points of piercing damage, threatens a critical hit on a 20, and

deals double damage on a critical hit. A wielder that hits an

opponent of Small to Large size may attempt to start a grapple

as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If

the wielder gets a hold, the snap-tong grabs the opponent and

deals 2d6 points of damage each round the hold is main-

tained. All rutterkins are proficient in the use of this weapon.

Three-Armed Blade: This exotic ranged weapon is a 1-foot

wide, three-bladed wedge that is launched from

a slinglike device. It has a range increment

of 20 feet and deals 1d10 points of slashing

damage. It threatens a critical hit on a 20 and

deals double damage on a critical hit. All rut-

terkins are proficient in its use.

BAR-LGURA

Also known as leaping demons, bar-

lguras appear like lumbering apes.

This  appearance  is

misleading, for although

they  look  and  move  like

orangutans, they are intelli-

gent and use their magical

abilities craftily.

:

They make excellent

scouts and skirmishers.

The sight of a dozen of

these  bestial  mon-

sters loping forward

at  high  speed  can

crush the morale of

the  stoutest  war-

rior. They prefer to

operate  in  small

packs. Unlike many

demons, bar-lguras

do  not  want  to  be

around lesser demons.

They do not enjoy bul-

lying  dretches  and

manes the way rut-

terkins do. Instead,

they feel that

the lesser demons

just get in their way.

Standing 5 to 6 feet tall, a bar-lgura is covered in reddish-

brown hair, although it can change color. Its face is apelike,

and its forelimbs are long and powerful while its rear limbs

are shortand powerful. Bar-lguras frequently walk on all

fours, but they are capable of standing upright. A few wield

weapons and wear humanoid clothing or armor.

Combat

Bar-lguras enjoy setting ambushes and attacking foes with

surprise. They leap into combat and throttle opponents with

their powerful limbs. If they outnumber their foes, some of

these demons grapple and hold the enemy while the others

tear at them with powerful claws.

Many of their supernatural and spell-like abilities help

them surprise their foes. Unlike that of most other demons,

bar-lguras teleport ability is not limited to just themselves,

so bar-lguras use this ability to grab foes and teleport them

to prisons or sealed caverns, leaving them there for as long

as they wish.

Pounce (Ex): If a bar-lgura charges, it can make a full

attack even though it has moved.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdarkness, cause fear, dispel

magic, see invisibility, telekinesis; 2/daychange self, invisibility,

major image. Caster level 6th; save DC 11 + spell level.

Teleport without Error (Su): A bar-lgura can use this

ability at will, as the spell, carrying up to 200 pounds with it.

Bar-lguras can even use this ability while grappling (grapple

bonus +10), but the foe must be pinned first.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day a bar-lgura can attempt

to summon another bar-lgura with a 35% chance of success.

Skills: The skin of a bar-lgura changes color, allowing it

to blend it with surroundings like a chameleon and confer-

ring a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks. A bar-lgura also

receives a +10 racial bonus on Jump checks.

BABAU

SHADOW DEMON

Babaus are powerful assassins that strike with a sudden

ferocity. They are devious and careful, forming careful plans

before going into battlealways making sure that they do

not have to engage in a fair fight. Almost every demon lord

has a number of babaus that he or she employs as spies and

killers. They occasionally work with succubi.

Babaus are tall and gaunt, looking like elongated skele-

tons covered in black leathery skin. The back of their skull

sports a singular, curved horn. Their rough flesh is covered

in a thick, reddish paste that they secrete from smelly pores.

They have pointed ears and a mouth full of jagged teeth.

Combat

Babaus are sneaky and sly. They attack the most powerful foe

first, hoping to eliminate the true threats quickly and then

toy with the rest. Although they can use their claws in

combat, babaus prefer to use weapons, usually those requir-

ing two hands to wield.

Sneak Attack (Ex): A babau can make a sneak attack like

a rogue, inflicting +2d6 points of damage whenever a foe is

denied his or her Dexterity bonus, or when the babau is

flanking.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdarkness, desecrate, cause

fear, dispel magic, fly, see invisibility, telekinesis, teleport without

error (self plus 50 pounds of gear only); 1/daypoly-

morph self, wrack. Caster level 7th; save

DC 13 + spell level

Shadow demons are denizens of the Abyss without corpo-

real forms, formed from the very essence of evil on that

plane. They skitter and flit about with great speed and a

supernatural nimbleness, often mistaken for undead shad-

ows. They resemble gaunt, angular, shadowy humanoids

with batlike wings.

Shadow demons, like night hags and a few other creatures

that inhabit the Lower Planes, trade in souls. They use their

magic jar ability to trap souls and sell or trade them to more

powerful fiends. On the Material Plane, shadow demons

sometimes work as advisors or assistants to evil creatures of

great power: a dragon, an evil king, a powerful demonolo-

gist, or a similar villain. Shadow demons generally serve

their chosen master well, especially if they are able to gain a

great many souls while doing so. If the souls are evil, all the

better. Shadow demons are also interested in tempting and

corrupting mortals. And if, when its master finally dies, the

shadow demon is able to snatch its soul too, all the better.

Shadow demons sometimes serve demon lords directly,

but they rarely interact with tanarri or other demons.

Combat

Shadow demons employ a straightforward strategy in

combat:

Weakness Gaze (Su): A

babau  has  a  gaze  attack

that deals 1d3 points of

Strength damage to any

creature that fails its For-

titude  save  (DC  16).

Protective

Slime (Ex): Because of the slippery,

slimy jelly that  coats  its  skin,

a babau takes half damage from

slashing and piercing weapons.

Further, any weapon that

strikes  it  is  corroded

and ruined by a touch

of  the  goo.  A  magic

weapon must succeed

at a Reflex save (DC 17)

or be corroded and ruined.

Bare  flesh  exposed  to  the

slime  (through  unarmed

attacks or grappling) auto-

matically takes 1d6 points of acid

damage per round or per strike.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day a babau

can attempt to summon 1 babau with a 40% chance

of success.

Skills: Babaus receive a +8 racial bonus on Hide,

Listen, Move Silently, and Search checks.

immerse the battlefield in darkness, then tear foes to shreds

with their inky claws.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a shadow demon hits a Medium-

size or smaller opponent with both claw attacks, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +17). If it hits with both claws, it can also rake in the

same round. The shadow demon has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its claws to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the shadow

demon is not considered grappled). In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals damage from both claws.

Pounce (Ex): If a shadow demon dives or leaps upon a

foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full

attack (including a rake attempt, see below) even though it

has moved.

Rake (Ex): On any round that a shadow demon has a hold

on an opponent (see Improved Grab, above), it can make

two rake attacks (+17 melee touch) with its hind legs for 1d6

points of damage each. The shadow demon can also attempt

to rake when it pounces on an opponent.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will: darkness; 1/daydeeper

darkness, damning darkness; 1/weekmagic jar. Caster level

10th; save DC 15 + spell level.

Darkness Enhancement (Ex): Shadow demons gain

power from being within total darkness. They gain a +4

enhancement bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, saves,

and skill and ability checks in such conditions.

Flesh-Ripping Claws (Su): When a shadow demons

claws touch flesh, they become corporeal, allowing the

creature to claw, rake, and even grapple with opponents,

yet still ignore their armor. The shadow demons claw and

rake attacks are thus made as touch attacks. Fleshless crea-

tures, such as certain constructs, are immune to the attacks

of a shadow demon. Corporeal foes attempting to grapple

the shadow demon can only attempt to escape; they cant

deal damage or pin in a grapple. All damage a shadow

demons claws deal is vile damage (see Vile Damage in

Chapter 2).

Immunities (Su): A shadow demon is immune to fire,

cold, and electricity as well as mind-affecting effects, poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is not subject to

critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain,

or death from massive damage.

Incorporeal Subtype: A shadow demon can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. A shadow demon can pass

through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its

attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflec-

tion bonuses and force effects work normally against them.

A shadow demon always moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Light Powerlessness (Ex): A shadow demon is drained

in bright light (such as sunlight) and flees from it. Within

such light, it takes a 4 penalty to AC, attack rolls, damage

rolls, saves, and skill and ability checks.

Skills: A shadow demons receives a +10 racial bonus on

Hide checks.

CHASME

Chasmes are disgusting, flylike demons. Experts in punish-

ment and torture, they sometimes gain positions of power

and influence in the Abyss. If in the service of a demon lord,

chasmes are the taskmasters that keep other demons serv-

ing that lord in line and doing the jobs assigned to them (a

feat that can only be accomplished through pain and intim-

idation). Other times, however, chasmes carve out a little

niche for themselves and act as very minor demon lords,

ruling over a number of lesser demons such as rutterkins

and dretches. Traditionally, chasmes hate succubi and kill

them when they can. They also do not like vrocks, whom

they see as rivals. They fear and obey more powerful demons

such as hezrous and glabrezu.

Like giant flies with tufts of hair sprouting about their

thick, insectoid flesh, chasmes have large buzzing wings

and six limbs, two of which resemble long, thin human

arms. Their heads are vaguely humanlike, although exagger-

ated and ugly, with a hard, hooked horn where a humans

nose would be.

Combat

Chasmes like to torment their foes before slaying them.

Thus, they often besiege enemies with contagion, wave of

grief, or insect plague before going in for the kill.

Drone (Su): As a full-round action, a chasme can beat its

wings to create a droning buzz in a 60-foot spread. Each crea-

ture in the area must make a Will save (DC 16) or fall asleep

for 2d10 rounds. There is no Hit Dice limit for this effect.

This ability otherwise functions like the sleep spell. Demons

and creatures immune to sleep effects (such as elves) are

immune to this effect.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a chasme can create an

aura of fear in a 5-foot radius. The effect is otherwise identi-

cal with a fear spell (caster level 10th; Will DC 16 negates). If

the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again

by that chasmes fear aura for 24 hours.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcontagion, darkness, dese-

crate, detect good, dispel magic, fly, insect plague, ray of enfeeble-

ment, protection from good, see invisibility, telekinesis, teleport

without error (self plus 50 pounds of gear only), wave of grief;

1/daycircle of nausea, unholy aura. Caster level 10th; save

DC 12 + spell level.

Wounding (Ex): A wound resulting from a chasmes attack

bleeds for an additional 1 points of damage per round there-

after. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in cumulative

bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per round,

and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a successful

Heal check (DC 10) or the application of a cure spell or some

other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

Summon  Tanar ri (Sp): Once  per  day  a  chasme  can

attempt to summon 1d4 rutterkins or 1 chasme with a 40%

chance of success.

DEVIL

Devils are fiends native to the Nine Hells. The most numer-

ous are the baatezu, who are infamous for their strength, evil

temperament, and ruthlessly efficient organization.

Baatezu have a rigid caste system, in which authority

derives not only from power but also from station. They

occupy themselves mainly with extending their influence

throughout the planes by corrupting mortals. Baatezu that

further this goal are usually rewarded with improved stations.

COMBAT

Devils enjoy bullying those weaker than themselves and

often attack good creatures just to gain a trophy or three.

Most devils are surrounded by an aura of fear, which they

use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents

piecemeal. The baatezu also use their illusion abilities to

delude and confuse foes. A favorite trick is to create illusory

reinforcements; enemies can never be sure if a threat is only

a figment or if real summoned devils are joining the fray.

All devils share the following traits.

Outsider Traits: A devil has darkvision (60-foot range). It

cannot be raised or resurrected.

In addition, all baatezu have the following abilities in

common unless otherwise stated.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Most baatezu can summon other

baatezu to their aid. This ability functions like a summon

monster spell of the appropriate level, except that it has only

a limited chance of success. Roll d% and compare the result

with the creatures indicated chance of success. On a failure,

no baatezu answer the summons. Summoned creatures

automatically return whence they came after 1 hour. A

baatezu that has just been summoned cannot use its own

summon ability for 1 hour. Most baatezu do not use their

summon ability lightly, since it leaves them beholden to the

summoned creatures. In general, they use it only when nec-

essary to gain victory or to save their own lives.

Baatezu Traits: Unless otherwise noted, a baatezu can

communicate telepathically with any creature within 100

feet that has a language. In addition, it can see perfectly in

darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness

spell. A baatezu is immune to fire and poison, and it has acid

resistance 20 and cold resistance 20.

KOCRACHON

Kocrachons are diabolic torturers. When the damned are

sent to hell to face torment, it is often the insectoid kocra-

chons that perform the sick and terrible dutiesand they

relish the task. These devils are likely to be found in terrible

hellish citadels, working for some greater baatezu. Dispater

alone employs more than a thousand kocrachons in Dis.

They have a dark bluish-purple carapace like an insects,

with long, serrated proboscises. Their heads are small; their

legs are long and thin, ending in claws that are quite adept at

Combat

Kocrachons hate straightforward combat, but they like to

inflict pain on helpless victims, slowly and precisely. If they

must fight, kocrachons use their spell-like abilities as long

as they can.

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by the kochracons bite

attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14) or contract

devil chills. The incubation period is 1d4 days, and the disease

deals 1d6 points of Strength damage. The victim must make

three successful Fortitude saving throws in a row to recover

(see Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

addition, it can see perfectly in

A kocrachon is immune to fire and

poison, and it has acid resistance 20

and cold resistance 20.

Sadism: For every 10 points of

damage a kochrachon deals in a

round, it gains a +1 luck bonus on

attack rolls, saving throws, and

skill  checks  during  the  next

round.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Twice per

day  a  kocrachon  can  attempt  to

summon 1 kocrachon, with a 40%

chance of success.

GHARGATULA

These terrors, likely to be mistaken for fiendish dinosaurs,

either wander about the warmer layers of hell, killing any-

thing  that  they  find  (even  other  devils),  or  they  are

employed as guardians in important palaces and cathedrals

on that dark plane.

A ghargatula stands 25 feet tall and has a tail 15 feet long. It

has terrible claws, and its tail ends in a wicked stinger black

with venombut the ghargatulas massive mouths is its most

striking feature. Filled with many rows of teeth the size of

daggers and short swords, a ghargatulas maw could engulf a

human in a single bite. Its flesh is jagged and dark, almost

176

Combat

Ghargatulas do not possess the magical abilities of other

baatezu, other than a weak attempt at summoning. Instead,

they are straightforward, extremely ferocious combatants

that use their terrible natural weapons to great effect.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a ghargatula hits a Large or

smaller opponent with a bite attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +46). If it

successfully grabs a creature that it can also swallow whole

(see below), it can attempt to do so in the next round. The

ghargatula has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use its jaws to hold the

opponent  (20  penalty  on

grapple  check,  but  the

ghargatula  is  not  consid-

ered grappled). In either case,

each  successful  grapple

check it makes during suc-

cessive  rounds  automati-

cally deals bite damage.

swallowed  creature

Swallow Whole (Ex): A

ghargatula can try to swal-

low a Medium-size or smaller

opponent that is already in

its mouth by making a suc-

cessful  grapple  check

(grapple  bonus  +46). The

takes

2d8+8  points  of  crushing

damage  per  round  and  8

points of acid damage from

the ghargatulas innards. A

swallowed creature can cut

its way out by using claws or

a  Small  or  Tiny  slashing

weapon to deal 25 points of

damage to the innards (AC

20). Once the creature exits,

muscular action closes the

hole; another swallowed

opponent must again cut

its  own  way  out.  The

ghargatulas innards can

hold 2 Medium-size, 8 Small, 32 Tiny, or 128 Diminutive or

smaller opponents.

Poison (Ex): Each successful tail stinger attack delivers a

gharagatulas poison (Fort DC 34). The initial and secondary

damage is the same (2d6 points of Dexterity damage).

Baatezu Traits: A ghargatula can communicate telepath-

ically with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

In addition, it can see perfectly in darkness of any kind,

even that created by a deeper darkness spell. A ghargatula is

immune to fire and poison, and it has acid resistance 20 and

cold resistance 20.

Regeneration (Ex): A ghargatula takes normal damage

from holy and blessed weapons of at least +2 enhancement.

Scent (Ex): A ghargatula can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a ghargatula can

attempt to summon 1 cornugon with a 25% chance of success.

magical qualities once the eye of fear and flame is destroyed.

When it is first encountered, a hood obscures the creatures

face. When it utilizes an eye power, it moves the hood away

with a bony hand to reveal the eye.

COMBAT

An eye of fear and flame so rarely relies on its claw attacks

that most people never even realize it has them. Instead, it

uses its spell-like abilities and flees if they are insuffi-

cient to destroy its enemies.

The eye of fear and flame is an undead creature created by the

gods of chaos and evil to spread destruction and darkness.

Through their malevolent divine power, they take the dead

soul of a chaotic evil madman and give him an animated skele-

tal form with which to roam and do their will. Let loose among

mortals, the eye of fear and flame commands all that it encoun-

ters to commit evil acts or be destroyed. For example, an eye of

fear and flame might approach a lone couple in the woods and

threaten that if the woman does not kill the man she is with

immediately, it will kill them both. If she does kill him, the eye

leaves her to her shock and misery. If she does not, the eye of

fear and flame does its best to make good on its threat.

Draped in a ragged, hooded cloak, an eye of fear and flame

is a skeletal figure with a gem set into each eye socketone

Immunities (Ex): An eye

of fear and flame is immune

to cold. Because it lacks flesh

or internal organs, it takes

only half damage from pierc-

ing and slashing weapons.

Spell Deflection (Su): If any sort of vision-affecting

spell such as blindness or power word, blind is cast on an eye of

fear and flame, it is reflected back upon the caster (as the

spell turning spell), who must save against the effect of her

own spell.

Turn Resistance (Ex): An eye of fear and flame is treated

as an undead with 16 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn,

rebuke, command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: An eye of fear and flame is immune to

mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning,

disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect

that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects.

It is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. An eye of fear and flame cannot be raised, and res-

urrection works only if it is willing. The creature has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

KYTHON

When a group of powerful fiends were trapped on the

Material Plane, they attempted to create more of their kind

through magical means. The result was a swarm of little,

eyeless, reptilian creatures that displayed some insectoid

traits as well. As these creatures matured, they took on

varied forms. None of them were loyal to the fiends that cre-

ated them, but they were wholly evil nonetheless. Their cre-

ators called them kythons. Because of their origin, they have

been called earth-bound demons as well.

Kythons have spread throughout the world, breeding rap-

idly. Their eggs look like wet, mucus-covered stones. They

seem  interested  only  in  eating  and  propagating  their

species; they are entirely without mercy, pity, or compassion

for any other creature. As they mature, each answers only to

those more powerful than themselves, so slaughterkings are

the highest kython authorityat least so far. Given time,

the kythons may grow into new forms that are even more

specialized and powerful.

Kythons speak a strange smattering of both Infernal and

Abyssal, but only to each other, never to others. Broodlings do

not speak, but understand the commands of other kythons.

COMBAT

Kythons enjoy tearing their prey to shreds, though they are

intelligent enough to make good use of weapons. Most

kythons have a chance to possess a special weapon.

Kython Traits: All kythons are eyeless but have blindsight

to a range of 60 feet. They are all immune to acid and cold and

possess fire resistance 20 and electricity resistance 20.

Kython Weaponry (Ex): The kythons grow their weapons

and devices from eggs similar to those that spawn their young.

When a kython lays an egg, it can choose whether the egg will

hatch into a broodling or an organic weapon. A kython using

any of these weapons substitutes the weapons attack for one of

its claw attacks (in the case of a ranged weapon, using the

kythons Dexterity bonus rather than its Strength bonus). In

all  other  ways,  these  weapons  are  considered  natural

weapons. Nonkythons cannot make these weapons function.

Each kython with a claw attack has a percentage chance (spe-

cified  in  the  crea-

tures descrip-

tive text) to

possess one

or  more  ky-

thon weapons or

devices. To determine which weapon a kython has, roll on

the following table.

Acid Spitter: This handheld weapon makes ranged touch

attacks with a range increment of 10 feet and a maximum

range of 50 feet. Those struck by the glob of acid take 3d6

points of damage. It bears a vague resemblance to a repeating

crossbow, although it has a bulbous green membrane attached

to its top. The acid spitter can be used 10 times per hour.

Bone Shard Crossbow: This weapon resembles a repeating

crossbow made of carapace and cartilage. It fires a single

bone spike with a range increment of 20 feet. It deals only 1

point of damage, but it carries the same venom that the

kython using it produces.

Boneblade: This Medium-size slashing melee weapon is

considered masterwork (adds +1 to attack roll) and deals

1d10 points of damage. It is bone-white with thin red and

blue veins covering its sides.

Extra Armor: Extra chitinous plates are fitted to the

kythons body, adding +2 to its existing natural armor bonus.

Mouth Launcher: This weapon, which attaches to the back

of a kythons mouth, looks like a worm with a sphincterlike

mouth. As an additional attack made at the kythons highest

attack bonus, the mouth launcher can shoot out at a foe,

making an improved grab attack

that deals 1d4 points

of damage (plus the

kythons Strength bo-

nus). If it gets a hold,

the foe is pulled into

the kythons mouth for

an  automatically  suc-

cessful  bite  attack  on

that same round. The

mouth launcher con-

tinues to hold the foe,

allowing automatic

bite  attacks  each

round until the foe

Mucus Pod: This gray and red membrane sac, filled with

yellow fluid, attaches to a kythons arm. When the kython

makes a successful claw attack with that arm, the attack also

sprays mucus out of a tube that runs from the sac to the claw. A

creature hit by the claw must succeed at a Reflex saving throw

(DC 18) or be entangled in the mucus for 1d6+4 rounds. Alco-

hol will wash the substance off a victim. Otherwise, there is no

means of disentangling before the duration is up.

Phase Organ: This small fleshy pod fits upon the forehead

of the kython, grafting into place permanently. It allows the

kython to become incorporeal (or corporeal again) as a free

action. It cannot use this supernatural ability more than

once per round. Add +1 to the Challenge Rating of a kython

with this device.

Skills and Feats: All kythons have extra Hit Dice as

though they were Small creatures.

BROODLING

Newly hatched kythons, or broodlings, have no functional

arms. Instead, they look like massive, tooth-filled mouths in

eyeless, carapace-covered heads on two short legs, with a

long, whiplike tail. Coloration varies wildly, from dark

green to black to orange-white.

Combat

Both the bite and the tail sting of the broodling are poisonous.

Poison (Ex): A broodling delivers its poison (Fort DC 12)

with each successful sting or bite attack. The initial and second-

ary damage is the same (1d6 points of Constitution damage).

JUVENILE

As kythons mature into juveniles, they grow larger and

develop an exoskeleton. They also gain the use of two clawed

arms. In other ways, juvenile kythons look like broodlings.

Combat

The juvenile kython is as poison-filled as the broodling.

Kython Weaponry (Ex): Each juvenile has a 10% chance

to possess a kython weapon.

Poison (Ex): Sting and bite, Fort DC 15; initial and sec-

ondary damage 1d6 Constitution.

ADULT

When kythons mature fully, their torso grows so that they

become a little more like upright humanoids (although they

still usually hunch over). Their tail drops away as they pass

into this stage, but they gain another set of clawed arms. The

exoskeleton is now either green, dark blue, or black. Adult

kythons bodily fluids become less poisonous, but they

develop poison sacs in their mouth with a new type of venom.

Adults guard the nests and carry out most of the work that

needs doing for kython society as a whole. Most kythons

remain in this stage forever. A few mature into more spe-

cialized  stages,  most of these becoming impalers, a few

transforming into slaymasters, and very rare individuals be-

coming slaughterkings.

The adult kython still has a poison bite, although it has a dif-

ferent effect from that of the younger kythons venom.

Kython Weaponry (Ex): Each adult has a 30% chance to

possess a kython weapon.

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fort DC 18; initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Strength.

IMPALER

Impalers do not look all that different from regular

adults, except that their form is more slender and sleek.

In the palm of each claw is a retractable spike made of

hardened bone.

Impalers are kython assassins. They are fast, sneaky, and

cunning. Unless assigned to eliminate a foe (one that has

penetrated a kython nest or been decreed an enemy by a

slaymaster or slaughterking), these creatures are usually at

rest. Impalers are never found as guards.

The impaler has a poison bite, but its favored tactic is to

charge with its bone spikes extended and ready to impale.

Charge (Ex): When an impaler charges with its bone spikes

out and pointed forward, it deals 6d6+8 points of damage.

Kython Weaponry (Ex): Each impaler has a 50% chance

to possess a kython weapon.

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fort DC 19; initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Strength.

Skills: Impalers  gain  a  racial  bonus  of  +8  on  Move

Silently and Hide checks.

SLAYMASTER

Slaymasters take on a form quite unlike that of regular adult

kythons. In some ways, they seem to regress toward brood-

ling form. Slaymasters have no legs and regain the long

stinger-tipped tail, only this time it forms the bulk of the

creatures body, which resembles that of a snake.

Slaymasters were the rulers of most kython nests until

the appearance of the slaughterkings. They are brutal and

180

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:41 AM  Page 181

savage, and they seem to take more enjoyment in killing

than their relatively unemotional lessers do.

Combat

A slaymaster has a virulent poison in its bite and tail, and it

also commands strange supernatural abilities.

Constrict  (Ex):  With  a

successful grapple check, a

slaymaster can crush a grabbed

opponent, dealing 2d8+10 points

of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a

slaymaster hits a Medium-

size  or  smaller  opponent

with a tail slap attack, it deals

normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity (grapple bonus +22). If it hits with

the tail slap, it can also constrict

in the same round. The slay-

master  has  the  option  to

conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its tail

to  hold  the  opponent

(20 penalty on grap-

ple check, but the

slaymaster is not

considered grappled).

In either case, each suc-

cessful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds auto-

matically deals tail slap and

constrict damage.

Kython Weaponry (Ex):

Each slaymaster has a 90%

chance to possess a kython

weapon. If it does possess

a weapon, it has a 10% chance to

possess a second one.

Poison  (Ex):

Bite, Fort DC 21;

initial  and  sec-

ondary  damage

2d6 Strength.

LGW

Disruption Field (Su):  If  a  slaymaster chooses to

reduce the range  of  its  blindsight to 30 feet, nonkythons

within this smaller area take a 2 morale penalty on attacks,

saves, ability checks, and skill checks. Any spell cast in this

area has a 10% chance of being disrupted and failing (check

for normal arcane spell failure chance separately). The dis-

ruption field can operate at the same time as the defensive

field, or the slaymaster can activate them independently.

Enhanced Defense (Su): If a slaymaster chooses to reduce

the range of its blindsight to 30 feet, it gains a +2 deflection

bonus to Armor Class and spell resistance 20. Enhanced

defense can operate at the same time as the disruption field,

or the slaymaster can activate them independently.

SLAUGHTERKING

Slaughterkings look like adult kythons, but they are much

larger and more muscular, standing about 12 feet tall. Their

mouths can open very wide like a snakes. They have an

almost regalbut still feralbearing.

The newest kython variation, the slaughterking rules

over all lesser kython. Slaughterkings are ill-tempered crea-

tures that crave battle. Occasionally, a slaughterking goes off

on its own to kill nonkythons, but usually it is found in a

nest, surrounded by guards and attendants.

Hailing from the evil plane known as Carceri, the vaath is a

creature of pure sadism that delights in both physical and

emotional pain. Unlike some outsiders, it does not feed

upon painit simply relishes inflicting it. If it can, a

vaath gives its prey time to realize that it is going to

die. Mental anguish is far more grati-

fying than simple physical agony.

Natural hunters, vaaths are built

for speed and are excellent trackers.

They possess sinister cunning and a

deviously twisted sense of tac-

tics,  setting  ambushes  and

traps for prey ahead of time.

A  horrible  amalgamation  of

insect and reptile, the vaath has a long body covered in dark

scales. A hard, thorny brown carapace protects its head.

Long, white teeth drip venomous saliva. Narrow, slitted eyes

peek out from its spike-covered head-shell. A long, snaky

tendril extends from a small cavity above its mouth, ending

in a small, sphincterlike mouth of its own.

A vaath speaks Infernal and Abyssal. Vaaths are occa-

sionally used as entertainment in the courts of powerful

fiends or even sometimes as hunting creatures. But even

the most powerful demon or devil is wary of a vaath pack

turning on it.

COMBAT

A vaath attempts to either grapple or paralyze a foe and then

use its burrowing mouth-tendril. Killing a foe quickly is

wasteful, so the vaath avoids doing so at all costs. Its desire to

hunt and kill supersedes its own survival instinct.

182

Burrow into Flesh (Ex): If the vaath has reduced its

preys Dexterity to 0 or established a hold on it, the vaaths

mouth-ended tendril burrows into the creatures flesh. The

tiny mouth chews its way through the victim, dealing 1d6

points of damage per round. After 1d4+1 rounds of burrow-

ing, the tendril reaches a vital organ. Unless the vaath is

killed or the victim receives healing, death comes 1d6+4

minutes later. Most victims survive long enough to watch

their own intestines and organs disappear into the vaaths

hungry maw.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a vaath hits a Medium-size or

smaller opponent with a claw attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +13). If it

hits with a claw, it can also burrow into flesh. The vaath has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the vaath is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals claw damage.

Poison (Ex): The bite of the vaath carries a poison (Fort

DC 15) meant to incapacitate foes so that the vaath can tor-

ment the creature before it perishes. The initial and second-

ary damage is the same (2d6 points of Dexterity damage).

Telepathic Sensory Conduit (Su): The vaaths only

supernatural ability comes into play when its mouth-ten-

dril has burrowed deep within its prey. When the vaath

begins savoring the meat and organs of the creature, it tele-

pathically transmits the sensation of taste (and its own

enjoyment of it) to all within 20

feetincluding the victim. All creatures are allowed a

Will saving throw (DC 14) against this mind-affecting

effect.  Creatures  that  fail  their  saves  take  1  point  of

Wisdom drain due to the horrific effect the devouring has

on ones sanity. Victims that fail the Will save take 1d6

points of Wisdom drain, but that only matters if the victim

survives. Creatures that regularly feed on the type of crea-

ture being devoured are immune to this effect. But no crea-

ture, not even another vaath, is immune to the horror of

experiencing what its own entrails taste like.

Scent (Ex): Vaaths can detect approaching enemies, sniff

out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

and leathery, desiccated flesh.

The torso of a vilewight tears

open  when  it  rises  from  the

dead, exposing dried, rubbery

intestines. These guts function

as  limbs,  snaking  out  of  the

wound  as  multiple  tendrils.

Each tendril ends in a vicious

mouth dripping bile.

These undead creatures haunt grave-

yards and necropolises, but they also can be found in ancient

libraries and in hidden cellars beneath wizards guilds.

Vilewights retain none of the abilities they had in life.

COMBAT

A vilewight relies on its dark channel spell-like ability, resort-

ing to melee only when it must. If it kills a humanoid that

become a spawn, it attempts to retreat until the spawn is fully

formed. Then it charges back into the fray with its new ally.

Dark Channel (Sp): Once every other round, a vilewight

can channel the negative energy infusing it into a line of

cold, black energy 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Everyone in

the area takes 8d8 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ).

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by the vilewights intestinal

tendrils must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 16) or contract

life blindness. The incubation period is 1 days, and the disease

causes the victim to be unable to see living creatures (see Dis-

ease in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by any of a vile-

wights natural attacks attack gains two negative levels. For

each negative level bestowed, the vilewight heals 5 points of

damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage it

has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. If the

negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as

restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent

must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) to remove it. Failure

means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a vilewight hits a Medium-size

or smaller opponent with a claw attack,

it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as

a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportu-

nity (grapple bonus +10).

If it hits with a claw, it

automatically hits with

its  tendril  bites  in  the

next  round.  The  vile-

wight has the option to

conduct  the  grapple

normally, or simply use

its claw to hold the

opponent (20 penal-

ty on grapple check,

but the vilewight is

not considered grap-

pled). In either case,

each successful grap-

ple check it makes during

successive rounds automati-

cally deals claw and tendril

bites damage.

Create Spawn (Su): Any

humanoid slain by a vilewight be-

comes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Such

wights are under the command of

the vilewight that created them and

remain enslaved until its destruction.

They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Undead Traits: A vilewight is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A vile-

wight cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is

willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A vilewight receives a +8 racial bonus on Move

Silently checks.

BONE CREATURE

Sometimes creatures that rise as undead skeletons retain

their intellect and abilities. Bone fighters wield deadly

weapons and clank about in ancient armor. Bone sorcerers

cast dreadful spells and are often confused with liches.

Bone wyverns darken the skies and threaten with their

poisoned, skeletal tails.

Bone creatures cannot be the result of a simple animate

dead spell, but could arise from a create undead or create greater

undead spell, as undead of their equivalent Hit Dice.

CREATING A BONE CREATURE

Bone is a template that can be added to any nonundead, cor-

poreal creature that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). The creatures type changes to undead. It

retains all type modifiers and subtypes, if applicable.

The bone creature uses all the base creatures statistics and

special abilities except as noted here.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Speed: Winged bone creatures retain the ability to fly.

Now, however, the flight is magical, as the fly spell, but it still

uses the creatures original fly speed.

AC: Natural armor bonus changes to a number based on

the bone creatures size.

and weapon proficiencies of the base creature, except for

attacks that cant work without flesh, such as a mind flayers

tentacle attacks. A creature with hands gains one claw attack

per hand; a bone creature can strike with all of them at its

full attack bonus. If the creature already had claw attacks

with its hands, use the bone creature attack format and

damage, if theyre better. The base creatures base attack

bonus does not change.

Damage: Natural  and  manufactured  weapons  deal

normal damage. A claw attack deals damage depending on

the bone creatures size.

Not all corpses risen as undead are shambling, slow-moving

zombies. Some retain their intellect and abilities. Sur-

CORRUPTED CREATURE

Powerful evil, unchecked and rampant, can horribly alter

any aspect of the physical world, and creatures are no

exception. Twisted by malevolence, corrupted creatures

take on a hideous appearance and gain evil powers and

dire intent.

Corrupted creatures have unique countenances, each

reacting to the source of malevolence in a different way.

Most have twisted, misshapen (often asymmetrical) forms;

mottled, discolored flesh; and reddish eyes. Although one

might be tempted to confuse a corrupted creature with a

fiendish or half-fiend creature, the corrupted creature usu-

ally has a more mutated and ungainly appearance.

CREATING A CORRUPTED CREATURE

Corrupted is a template that can be added to any corpo-

real creature that is not an outsider (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). Creatures that gain this template

change their type to aberration. A corrupted creature uses

all the base creatures statistics and special abilities except

as noted here.

AC: The flesh of corrupted creatures becomes tougher

and more resilient. Add +4 to the natural armor bonus of

the base creature if it is Large or smaller. If it is Huge or

larger, add +8.

Damage: The corrupted creatures claws lengthen, teeth

multiply, and muscles harden. The damage die used when

the creature deals damage with natural attacks increases by

one die type, so that 1d6 becomes 1d8, 1d8 becomes 2d6,

and so on, as if the creature were one size larger.

Special Attacks: A corrupted creature retains all the spe-

cial attacks of the base creature.

Special Qualities: A corrupted creature retains all the

special qualities of the base creature and also gains dark-

vision with a range of 60 feet plus acid immunity. It also

gains the special qualities described below.

damage dealt is equal to half of the creatures Hit Dice (max-

imum 20 points of damage). For example, a 14-HD cor-

rupted frost worm deals an additional 7 points of vile

damage with its bite attack.

Enhanced Power (Su): The save DCs of any and all of the

corrupt creatures special attacks increase by +4.

Fast Healing (Ex): Each round, a corrupted creature heals

A packs favorite tactic is to send a few wolves against a

foes front while the rest of the pack attacks from the

flanks or rear.

Disruptive Attack (Su): A corrupted wolf deals an addi-

tional 1 point of vile damage when it touches uncorrupted,

living, corporeal nonoutsiders.

Trip (Ex): A corrupted wolf that hits with a bite attack

can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without

making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportu-

nity. If the attempt fails, the foe cannot react to trip the cor-

rupted wolf.

Fast Healing (Ex): A corrupted wolf regains lost hit

points at the rate of 1 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow a corrupted wolf to regrow or reattach

lost body parts.

Scent (Ex): A corrupted wolf can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A corrupted wolf receives a +4 racial bonus on

Wilderness Lore checks when tracking by scent.

Appendix: Evil PCs

Sometimes players are going to want to run evil player char-

acters. A single player might want to take on the role of the

evil spy or the antihero. A whole group might want a brief

change of pace or an entirely new campaign choice. A Dun-

geon Master should not allow these choices lightlyat least

not without considering the implications.

A SINGLE EVIL PC

Go into this territory with your eyes open. The potential for

player-versus-player conflict when PCs have opposed align-

ments becomes very high. This might not be a bad thing.

Sometimes, in fact, its fun to have a PC in on it, working as

a spy or agent for the bad guys.

For example, suppose the PCs are heroes determined to

stop a blackguard who is intent on creating an evil school

for pupils in the dark arts. The blackguard assigns one of his

students to join the heroes, pretending to be their ally, so

that he can spy on and eventually betray them. The DM and

player work out this ahead of time, and the DM tells the

player that its quite possible that the character will fail. The

other characters might find him out or succeed despite his

efforts, but that thats all part of the fun.

Or suppose a doppelganger replaces a PC. The DM works

with the player to continue playing the character, who is

really now a monster with an agenda of its own. The other

characters will probably catch on eventually, and perhaps

theyll even locate and rescue the original character.

Conversely, a single player may wish to play an evil char-

acter with goals similar to, rather than opposing, those of

the rest of the group. Now the conflicts between characters

are more likely to be philosophical rather than physical. The

evil PC will probably have different methods than the rest of

the characters. If the DM feels that the players will enjoy

this sort of conflict, rather than be distracted and annoyed

by it, this can be a solid choice for a long-term campaign.

The player of the evil character may even plan for her char-

acter to find redemption in the company of heroes, eventu-

ally changing her alignment. Such a tale can make for great

gaming stories long remembered by all.

pqs

DETECTING EVIL

A new character joins the group, and the paladin says I detect

evil. This can completely ruin a players character concept, or

the DMs plans to plant a ringer in the group. There are ways

around the problem, however.

Not  all  evil  characters  have  an  evil  aura  that  registers  with

the  detect  evil  spell  (or  similar  spell-like  abilities).  See  the

spell description in Chapter 11 of the Players Handbook for

more information.

Undetectable  alignment  is  a  simple  2nd-level  spell  that

throws off detect evil.

Misdirection and  nondetection are  arcane  spells  that  also

work.

pqs

AN EVIL PARTY

The Dark Lords of the Prophecy rode into town on jet-black coursers.

One sat atop a hellish steed whose breath was sulfurous, and its hooves

and eyes burned with dark fire. Everyone knew who they wereand

knew the doom that the ancient seers warned they could bring. Shut-

ters slammed shut, and shop doors locked. The dark lords dismounted

and strode toward the tavern; woe to the barkeep if he locked the door.

While nonstandard, it is not uncommon for a group of play-

ers to want to turn the tables for a time and play evil charac-

ters. It does not make them bad people, nor does it make

them childish. The DM plays evil nonplayer characters

(NPCs) all the time, and the DM is generally as mature as

the rest of the players. For most players, the choice simply

provides a change of pace.

NONHERO CHARACTERS

Most of the time, players who want to play evil characters

reject the traditional notion of the hero. They grow weary of

the sameness of always being the stalwart adventurers who

save the town, rescue the prince, and defeat the evil goblins

that threaten the merchant routes through the mountains.

They see playing an evil character a way to say no to the sim-

pering mayor asking for help and do as they like instead.

Such a group of nonheroes can still partake in most of the

adventures that the DM creates. It is merely the motivation

for the adventure that has to change. Monetary rewards,

revenge, and other personal goals interest nonheroes. They

have no interest in altruism, find no motivation in pity, and

feel no sympathy for the less fortunate.

ANTIHERO CHARACTERS

A good example of the antihero in fantasy literature is

Michael Moorcocks Elric. This tragic figure is evil, but

mostly because of the evil culture from which he comes.

Motivated by sympathy for others, and by love, but also by

terrible rage and hate, Elric is a complex character. He does

good deeds, but he uses evil methodsnot to mention the

terribly evil artifact sword he wields.

An antihero is not terribly different from a traditional

player character. The antihero enjoys the good life and often

rails against injustice. But the antihero usually puts himself

before others. He freely acts on feelings of vengeance, and

he possesses a different moral code from that of a traditional

heroor no code at all. The antihero kills those that get in

his way or threaten him. He has no interest in redeeming

wrongdoers and seeks no redemption for himself.

Players attracted to playing antihero characters want to do

the things that other PCs do, but they imagine their charac-

ter having a real dark side. Some enjoy the unpredictability

of the antihero: Will he save the kingdom or destroy it?

VILLAIN CHARACTERS

Some players want to really see what the other side is like.

They want to play the characters who instigate the evil plans

rather the heroes who react to them. There are two ways to

play real villains.

187

620_88161_Vile Darkness.qxd  8/13/02  11:44 AM  Page 188

The first is to play them over the top. The player charac-

ters are villains who want to conquer the world. They may

be evil monsters, even fiends or undead. The players have

irony-tinged fun when their characters battle against pal-

adins and good-aligned clerics. Perhaps they even fight

NPCs similar to the good characters that they played in pre-

vious adventures. Villain characters lie, cheat, and steal to

get what they want. Rarely is morality questioned in such a

campaign, except for one simple rule: Everything turns

upside down. What was once considered good is now hated,

and everything evil is embraced.

Player characters may take part in acts that are awful or

grotesque, but ultimately its not taken too seriously. Actual

depravity or vile actions are glossed over or occur offstage.

For example, a villain PC might have an NPC thrown into

the dungeons and turned over to a torturer, but the actual

torture acts are not part of the game. Often, players in such a

game feel oddly satisfied when the campaign comes to an

end and the villains they have been playing get whats

coming to them.

The second way to manage a villainous campaign could

be called the dark-hearted villain method. These player char-

acters use the rules and suggestions found in this book. Its

not terribly different from the over-the-top method, except

that things are taken more seriously. The characters worship

demons, destroy souls, take slaves, and face some of the

same depraved addictions and fetishes that a NPC villain

might face. Many players feel uncomfortable in campaigns

like this, obviously. The DM should not use this approach if

not all the players want it.

THE EVIL CAMPAIGN

So how does a DM provide interesting adventures for evil

player characters? Is running an evil campaign completely

different from a normal campaign?

Not really. Theres no reason why evil PCs would not go

down into dungeons, explore the ruins of the evil necro-

mancers fortress, or fight against the mind flayers attempt-

ing to take over the city. The DM can prepare many of the

same kinds of adventures for evil characters, but must pay

attention to four key differences between an evil campaign

and a traditional D&D campaign.

As mentioned above, the largest difference is motiva-

tion. Clearly, evil PCs are not going to want to help others.

The characters do nothing out of the goodness of their

hearts, because their hearts have none.

Greed is the primary motivator for evil PCs. A monetary

reward gets a group of evil characters going as quickly as any

other motivator. In fact, evil PCs are sometimes easier to

motivate than good characters because they rarely question

whether the patron paying them has sinister motives of her

own. Evil PCs simply do not care.

Revenge is also a strong motivator for evil characters. If

the DM wants the evil PCs to fight against raiders and brig-

ands, he does not show the terrible wrongs that the raids

have wrought against the local communities. Instead, the

DM has the brigands attack the evil PCs themselves. Evil

PCs are quick to mobilize against an opponent that has

wronged them in some way.

Perhaps the best way to motivate evil PCs is to have the

players determine what their evil characters actually want.

An evil character might want to take over a city, become the

most powerful wizard in the land, start an assassins guild, or

eradicate every lizardfolk in the world. She might have

short-term goals as well: decorate her new keep with dragon

skulls, obtain a copy of the book of vile darkness, enslave a

powerful devil to do her bidding. Evil characters are moti-

vated by desire. Find out what those desires are, and you can

design adventures that feed into them.

Another difference between evil campaigns and tradi-

tional ones is expectations. If you design a temple in which

the evil PCs struggle against troglodyte slavers, do not

expect the PCs to treat the troglodytes slaves in the same

way that good characters would. Evil characters might not

give a moments thought to the slaves, leaving them to their

own fate. Villains might take the slaves for their own or

ransom them back to their families.

The third difference is implications. Evil characters

commit acts that have consequences. It is far more likely

that a group of evil characters will incur the wrath of the

local king, the city constabulary, or a nearby order of knight-

hood that will hunt them down for their crimes. Soon, the

places normally considered safe by PCsnamely, towns

and citiesare anything but safe. This means that over the

long term, evil characters must become self-sufficient. They

have to be able to provide their own places to live outside

normal, civilized society. They must learn to work outside

standard circles, obtain their needed supplies in a different

way, and gain information through new channels. Even if

the evil PCs work hard to avoid these implications (using

disguises, covering up their evil acts, and so on), the very act

of disguising their evil is still a point of departure from a

traditional campaign.

The last major difference is interactions. Both with NPCs

and in particular with each other, evil characters tend to

interact poorly in social situations. Players playing evil PCs

sometimes overstress their characters arrogance or brash-

ness. Such attitudes can get the characters killed rather

quickly if they insult the wrong person.

Evil characters often need to learn when arrogance is bad.

They can benefit from genteel style and grace now and

again. An evil character does not have to be a brute. Villains

can of course be sophisticated and politewhen they need

to be. Much of this has to do with the role-playing choices

the player makes, but all players of evil characters should

know that they have a gamut of choices to choose from:

sophisticated and suave evil scoundrel, brash and boorish

brute, arrogant mastermind, scheming weasel, quiet and

ominous killer, and so on.

What brings many evil campaigns to a crashing halt is evil

PCs interacting with the other evil PCs in the group. The

characters often turn against one another, and the whole

campaign ends in a big fight. That can be fun, but a short

campaign might not be what the DM or the players really

had in mind. The DM should try to set up situations that

encourage the player charactersno matter how evil they

areto work together. And if, at the end of the campaign, it

all comes down to PC against PC, well, that might be fun.

And it is, after all, an evil campaign.

EVIL VERSUS EVIL

Just because the PCs are evil does not mean that theyre

friends with all the villains in the campaign. In fact, the

opposite is likely. Rarely is evil a monolithic force that

unites all the disparate evil factions and groups. More

likely, evil characters find that their goals work at cross

purposes with other evil NPCs plans. Every time a das-

tardly malefactors plans reach fruition (and, as a result, the

forces of good move to oppose him), the evil character

probably had to face off against one or more other villains

to get there.

You could fill a whole campaign with battles between vil-

lainous PCs and equally dastardly foes. An evil setting

such as the dark caverns of the drowcould make this very

simple. The PCs know that they cannot really trust anyone,

nor can anyone really expect better from them. The evil of

the NPCs can overshadow the evil of the PCs, which is good

if the players are interested in being antiheroes rather than

actual villains.

For some players, fighting against malevolent foes might

take some of the squeamishness away from playing an evil

character. If the characters do terrible things to despicable

beings, it might be more palatable to some players. Of

course, the players to whom it makes no difference arent

bothered either way.

pqs

EVIL PCS GETTING ALONG

Two evil PCs do not have to come to blows just because they

are both evil. Evil characters with similar goals or common foes

can certainly work together. And theres no reason to think that

evil characters cannot respect something like friendship.

Intelligent evil characters realize, just as nonevil characters

do, that they can accomplish more by working together rather

than working at cross purposes. An evil cleric is better off with

an evil fighter companion than alone in the dungeon. An assas-

sin can use the firepower and spells of an evil wizard backing

him up.

pqs

EVIL VERSUS GOOD

Sometimes, its fun to have a character try to destroy some-

thing thats obviously good. Waging war against lammasus,

unicorns, celestials, and paladins is an ironic turnabout.

Bringing ruin to the places and people that normal charac-

ters defend makes for unusual adventures. The tables are

turned when evil characters face their good counterparts.

The DM runs the heroes and reacts to the actions taken by

the villains (the PCs). The players are probably familiar

with the habitats, tactics, and outlooks of the foes they face.

Only now their characters can use that information to

make sinister plans.

In this sort of situation, all that is good is bad. All that is

holy is distasteful. That which is wholesome and life -

affirming is dangerousthese things can threaten and kill

an evil character. The light blinds and drives characters

away. They find their solace in darkness. The holy smite of

the paladin and the holy sword wielded by the planetar are

a real danger to the PCs. They are vulnerable to the same

things that saved the lives of the good-aligned characters in

the last campaign.

As nonevil characters gain levels, they become protectors

of those weaker than they are. As evil characters, they can

exploit the weak instead as they grow in power. When the

PCs become more powerful than anyone in town, they can

lord it over the citizens, terrorizing them or conquering them

if they choose. Characters and creatures that aid the less for-

tunate are fools, and their altruism is a weakness to exploit.

Finally, the DM can get more use out of monsters such as

treants, couatls, lillends, and titans. He or she can take a

break from running necromancers and blackguards and

instead play woodland-protecting druids, stalwart dwarven

defenders, and of course avenging paladins. The DM can

even create unusual combinations such as the rare celestial

medusa, a cluster of altruistic beholders, or a half-celestial

umber hulk (all exceptions to the rules, but nevertheless

possible).

Its been said before, but it bears repeating.

CONCLUSION

This book is not an attempt to glorify evil, but to define it

and quantify itand in so doing to open up new opportu-

nities in D&D campaigns of all sorts. Whether the PCs pre-

pare for battle against a demon lord or they join ranks with

that demon is a decision for the players and DM of each

campaign to make for themselves. No matter what that

decision is, the material in Book of Vile Darkness will inject

added depth and realism into the adventures that spring

from the decision.

Its unlikely that any single campaign could make use of

all the equipment, feats, prestige classes, spells, magic

items, and creatures in this bookand thats okay. Choose

the parts that enhance and contribute to the tone of your

campaign, while keeping in mind that the fundamental

goal of any D&D campaign is the enjoyment of those who

take part in it.

Yet More Archfiends

A Book of Vile Darkness Web Enhancement

The Book of Vile Darkness details all aspects of evil as

they might apply to your campaign. This includes, but

is not limited to, the statistics and descriptions of those

most evil beings, the archfiendsthe Lords of Hell

and Demon Princes. They each come with their own

details plus descriptions of their followers and cultists.

Yes, although the archfiends are not true deities, cults

of mortals revere them all the same. (The Book of Vile

Darkness describes how this works and suggests rele-

vant variant rules.)

Presented here for you are three more archfiends

that didnt make it into the book: a deposed archdevil

and two demon princeswell, one demon prince and

one princess.

1

Treasure: Quadruple standard

Alignment: Lawful evil

Advancement: 

Geryon was once Lord of Hells Fifth Layer. During a

period called the Reckoning, Asmodeus himself ousted

him. This turn of events seems strange to those who

know the facts, since the Reckoning came about when

the  lords  of  Hell  all  turned  on  their  master,

Asmodeusall but Geryon, that is. The only loyal lord

was deposed, while most of the mutinous lords went

unpunished. Some speculate that this move repre-

sented some sort of strange reward from Asmodeus

Geryon certainly did not see it that wayand others

assume the former archdevils loss of rank is only tem-

porary. If Geryon has his way, the latter estimation will

prove correct.

Although  some  call  him  the  Serpentine  Lord,

Geryons enemies also name him Lord of the Filth. This

label obviously plays off his former Lord of the Fifth

title, much like Baalzebubs Lord of the Flies/Lord of

the Lies moniker. However, such a reference is ironic

in Geryons case, for the archdevil despises uncleanli-

ness and dirt, demanding that servants keep himself

and his surroundings immaculate. This need seems at

odds with the devils otherwise bestial appearance and

nature; some think him a little mad.

The archdevil dwells in a secret iceberg fortress

called Citadel Coldsteel that floats in a frigid sea. Its

dangers combined with its sterile appearance encour-

age the few who have seen it to compare the place to a

surgeons scalpel.

In appearance Geryon resembles Mammons current

form: that of a huge serpent with a muscular humanoid

torso sporting two large arms and a massive humanoid

head. For all his bizarre appearance, Geryons face and

features seem strangely attractive and handsome in a

raw, animal sort of way.

Geryons  symbol  is  a  menacing  bulls  head  sur-

rounded by a serpentine border.

Combat

Geryon thrusts himself into physical combat at a

moments notice with lust and ferocity. He prefers to

destroy foes with his bare hands, but sometimes he

resorts to using weapons and even a shield.

Fear Gaze (Su): Geryon has a gaze attack that pro-

duces fear, similar to the fear spell (caster level 15th; Will

DC 31 negates). Other baatezu are immune to the aura.

Abilities: Str 36, Dex 19, Con 35, Int 26, Wis 24, Cha 23

tion +42, Diplomacy +36, Hide +26, Innuendo +34,

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground

Organization: Solitary

Challenge Rating: 22

Improved Grab (Ex): If Geryon hits a Large or

smaller opponent with a claw attack, he deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +51). If he

hits with the claw, he also automatically hits with his

tail slap attack in the same round. Geryon has the option

to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use his claw

to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but

Geryon is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check he makes during successive

rounds automatically deals claw and tail slap damage.

Poison (Ex): Geryon delivers his poison (Fort DC 37)

via each successful tail slap attack, from the vicious stinger

embedded in his tail. The initial and secondary damage

are the same (2d6 points of Constitution damage).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, charm mon-

ster, desecrate, detect good, detect magic, discern location, dispel

magic, enthrall, fireball, hellfire storm, hold person, magic

circle against good, major image, produce flame, see invisibil-

ity, suggestion, teleport without error, unholy aura, unhallow,

wall of fire; 1/dayspread of savagery, symbol (any), wish.

Caster level 20th; save DC 16 + spell level.

Baatezu Traits: Geryon can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a lan-

guage. In addition, he can see perfectly in darkness of

any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell.

Geryon is immune to fire and poison, and he has acid

resistance 20 and cold resistance 20.

Outsider Traits: Geryon cannot be raised or resur-

rected.

Regeneration (Ex): Geryon takes normal damage

from holy and blessed weapons of at least +4 enhance-

ment.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Three times per day, Geryon can

summon four barbazu or hamatulas automatically. Alter-

natively, he can attempt to summon three cornugons, two

gelugons, or one pit fiend with an 80% chance of success.

Possessions: Geryon possesses the horn of the bull.

The Goals of Geryon

Geryons single-minded goal is to regain his former

position. Although he hates Asmodeus for taking away

his authority and power, he does not openly oppose his

old master. Instead, he still works for him, hoping his

performance will result in his reinstatement. In fact,

Asmodeus likely deposed Geryon in the first place

because he knew the archfiends coveting of his former

position would make him more easily to manipulate

and use for some great task at a later date.

Most of the time Geryon plots and schemes against

Levistus, current ruler of Hells fifth layer. Slowly and

secretly the resentful ex-lord raises an army of disaf-

fected or mercenary devils. Geryons secret army is vast

and powerful, but not yet ready to begin a revolt

against Levistus.

If Geryon ever regains his former position, his per-

sonal power likely will increase quickly (more Hit

Dice, greater spell-like abilities, and so on).

The Cult of Geryon

Cultists who worship Geryon see him as a patron of

controlled  rage  and  revenge.  His  followers,  often

rangers and barbarians,

can  be  found  among

gnolls, bugbears, hob-

goblins, and minotaurs,

as well as more standard

races.  These  driven,

greedy

individuals

allow nothing to get in

their way.

HHoorrnn  ooff  tthhee  BBuullll

This lesser artifact summons 1d10+10

minotaurs with maximum hit points.

They serve the summoner until they

die. The horn can be used three times

per week, but when a user blows it, all

summoned minotaurs remaining from

its previous use (if any) disappear. In all

other ways, treat the horns effect as a

summon monster spell.

Caster Level: 18th.

The very few temples

of  Geryon  are  found

deep in the wilderness.

These  underground

labyrinths incorporate cold, bluish steel where possible

and always look extremely clean and stark.

Clerics associated with Geryon wear red or dark

green clothing and serpentine jewelry. They usually

have access to the Diabolic, Evil, and Bestial domains.

Cultists

Daglum Shiverstone lives alone in the wilderness,

maintaining a small underground temple to his patron.

His current goals include winning over some of the

local bugbears to Geryons service and using them as

temple guards. Eventually he hopes to lead an army of

Geryons worshippers back to his dwarven home and

raze it in revenge for past wrongs done him. A dire

badger companion currently serves Daglum.

variety of devilsthe rogue lord will take whomever

he  can  get.  His  most  powerful  servant  and  most

trusted ally is the duke Amon, a unique creature also

deposed at Geryons ousting. Amon looks like a huge

humanoid  figure  covered  in  fur  with  a  massive

wolfish head. His mouth is full of jagged teeth, and

his eyes glisten like ice. Normally accompanying him

is a Huge 18-HD winter wolf.

Alignment: Chaotic evil

Advancement: 

Pazuzu, known to some as Pazrael or Pazuzeus, is a

unique demon lord in that he does not rule a layer of

the Abyss. Instead he oversees a portion of almost every

layer: the sky above. Also unlike his fellow princes, he

does not war with other demon lords. All treat him

with roughly equal amounts of resentment and grudg-

ing respect.

One cannot dispute Pazuzus power, but he is not in

the  same  league  physically  as  the  most  powerful

princes, Demogorgon and Orcus. He maintains no per-

manent lair, although he occasionally resides in the

highest Abyssal mountain peaks or rocky crags, or in

the floating palaces of the evil cloud giants that pay

him homage.

Known as the Demon Prince of the Lower Aerial

Kingdoms or Demon Prince of the Air, Pazuzu con-

cerns himself mainly with the Material Plane. He goes

there more often than most demon princes. And, more

than any other prince, he enjoys tempting or tricking

those of good alignment to fall to evil.

Pazuzu is a 7-foot-tall humanoid with four dark,

feathered wings. His large head also bears a bit of

plumage, as well as massive red eyes and a sharp, tooth-

filled, beaklike mouth.

The Demon Prince of the Air uses a swooping bird of

prey as his symbol.

5

Combat

Pazuzu uses his breath weapon as liberally as possible

as his main offensive tactic. In battle, he sticks to the

air, swooping down to attack, then flying back up again.

Even if he achieves a grapple attack against a foe with

his improved grab ability, he is unlikely to hang on for

long, unless the foe is in the air. He usually prepares for

battle with unholy aura and improved invisibility, giving

his Armor Class and saving throws a +4 bonus against

good characters.

Breath Weapon (Su): Pazuzu can breathe a 30-foot

cone of acidic gas and insects that deals 14d6 points of

damage (Reflex DC 36 half ) and also has the effects of a

creeping doom spell. (The insects are immune to the

effects  of  the  acidic  gas.)  Once  he  uses  his  breath

weapon, he must wait 1d4 rounds before doing so again.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Pazuzu hits a Medium-size

or smaller opponent with a bite attack, he deals normal

damage and attempts to start a grapple without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +47). If he

gets a hold, he can also rake in the same round. There-

after, Pazuzu has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use his jaws to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but Pazuzu is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check

he makes during successive rounds automatically deals

bite damage.

Pounce (Ex): Should Pazuzu attack a foe from the air

during the first round of combat, he can make a full

attack, even though he has moved.

Rake (Ex): If attacking from the air, Pazuzu can

make two rake attacks with his legs (+41 melee) for

2d8+5 points of damage each. If he pounces on an

opponent or gets a hold with his improved grab ability,

he can also rake.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, call light-

ning,  control  weather,  control  winds,  deeper  darkness,

desecrate, detect good, detect law, detect thoughts, greater

dispelling, greater magic fang, improved invisibility, shape-

change, suggestion, telekinesis, teleport without error, tongues

(self only), unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, wind

wall; 1/daymeteor swarm. Caster level 20th; save

DC 20 + spell level.

Blindsight (Su): By detecting subtle movements in

the air, Pazuzu is aware of all things around him in a

100-foot radius. Invisibility and darkness are irrele-

vant, though he still cant discern ethereal beings.

Pazuzu usually does not need to make Spot or Listen

checks to notice creatures within range of his blind-

sight ability.

Fast Healing (Ex): Pazuzu regains hit points at the

rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow him to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Greater Magic Fang: Pazuzu carries this permanent

spell effect (caster level 20th) on each of his two front

claws and on his jaws. The effect adds a +5 bonus to

attack and damage rolls (already figured into the statis-

tics above). Should someone dispel it, he can use his

own spell-like ability to replace the effect.

Outsider Traits: Pazuzu has darkvision (60-foot

range). He cannot be raised or resurrected.

Summon Aerial Monster (Sp): Once per day Pazuzu

can summon 2d6+3 gargoyles, 1d6+3 harpies, 1d4 man-

ticores, or 1 wyvern automatically. These particularly

strong creatures enjoy maximum hit points and a +1

bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Summon Tanar ri (Sp): Once per day Pazuzu can

summon 1d4+1 succubi, 1d2+1 vrocks, or 1 balor auto-

matically.

Tanarri Traits: Pazuzu is immune to poision and

electricity. He has acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20,

and fire resistance 20. Pazuzu can communicate tele-

pathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a

language (except dretches).

Skills: Pazuzu gains a +10 bonus to Spot checks

made while in the air, and a +10 bonus to Animal

Empathy and Handle Animal skill checks used with

any winged creature.

The Goals of Pazuzu

Uninterested in conquest, Pazuzu does not see the

other demon princes as rivals. This attitude is partially

due to arrogance (he considers himself above them and

assumes he already controls anything of worth in the

Abyss) and partially due to the fact that his goals have

nothing to do with those of most other demon lords.

Pazuzu loves to tempt mortals. He personally offers his

aid to any good creature that calls upon himan act

that automatically causes the good creature to turn to

evil. Calling upon him usually involves intoning his

name three times in succession.

The Cult of Pazuzu

The cult of Pazuzu is an uncommon one. Rarely do

societies  devote  themselves  to  this  demon  lord.

Instead, the occasional individual swears allegiance to

him. Even this conduct occurs most often among

harpies, gargoyles, manticores, wyverns, and (rarely)

evil fey or dragons.

6

Pazuzu encourages his priests to use their powers to

corrupt the souls of good creatures. He enjoys it when

they sacrifice good creatures that prove beyond tempta-

tion on altars dedicated to him. His temples usually lie

deep in the wilderness, atop high cliffs or rugged

mountain peaks unreachable except by those capable of

flight or similar means of travel.

His priests wear multicolored robes, often with

feathers stitched into the fabric, or they wear nothing.

They sometimes refer to themselves as the Talons of

Pazuzu.

Clerics affiliated with Pazuzu usually have access to

the Evil, Demonic, and Air domains.

Cultists

Agribrulix, an exceptional harpy cleric that reveres

Pazuzu, dwells with a small clutch of other harpies high

in the wilderness. Agribrulix seeks to lead them out of

their lair to steal a magic item that would alter her

appearance enough to pass in a human city. In such a

guise, she hopes to use her captivating song to cause

good mortals to commit evil acts. By using her magic

voice to bring them to her, she can more easily get

them to listen to the temptations she offers in her lords

name. Corrupting these souls should encourage Pazuzu

to grant her the power to establish her own temple, she

hopes, with her own Pazunite soldiers to command.

Captivating Song (Su): When Agribrulix sings,

every creature within 300 feet must succeed at a Will

save (DC 19) or become utterly captivated. This charm

effect follows the rules for a spread. If the save suc-

ceeds, Agribrulixs song cannot affect that creature

again for one day. A captivated victim walks toward

Agribrulix, taking the most direct route available. If the

path leads into a dangerous area (through flame, off a

cliff, etc.), the creature gets a second saving throw. Cap-

tivated creatures can take no other actions other than to

defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of Agribrulix

stands there and offers no resistance to her attacks. The

effect continues for as long as she sings.

The Servants of Pazuzu

Pazuzu commands six balors, each an elite individ-

ual with special fighter training (5th-level fighters)

and magical plate armor. Called the Six Wings of

Pazuzu, they act as his bodyguards and assassins. In

turn, each of these balors commands a unit of hun-

dreds of vrocks.

Body Flames (Su): A wing of Pazuzu can wreathe its

body in roaring flames as a free action. It suffers no

harm, but anyone grappling with it takes 4d6 points of

fire damage each round.

Entangle (Ex): A wing of Pazuzus whip entangles foes

much like an attack with a net. The whip has a maxi-

mum range of 40 feet, with a range increment of 10

feet, and 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it

hits, the target and the wing of Pazuzu immediately

make opposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it

drags the target against its flaming body (see Body

Flames). The target remains anchored against the wing

of Pazuzus body until it escapes the whip.

Fear (Su): Any creature hit by a wing of Pazuzus slam

attack must succeed at a Will save (DC 20) or flee in

terror for 1d6 rounds.

Death Throes (Ex): When killed, a wing of Pazuzu

explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 50

points of damage to everything within 100 feet (Reflex

DC 22 half ).

Detect Magic (Su): A wing of Pazuzu continuously

detects magic as the spell (caster level 20th).

Outsider Traits: A wing of Pazuzu has darkvision

(60-foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

See Invisibility (Su): A wing of Pazuzu can continu-

ously use a see invisibility effect as the spell (caster

level 20th).

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day, a wing of Pazuzu

can automatically summon 1d4 dretches, 1d4 hezrous,

or one nalfeshnee, glabrezu, marilith, or balor.

Tanarri Traits: A wing of Pazuzu is immune to poi-

sion and electricity. It has acid resistance 20, cold resist-

Alignment: Chaotic evil

Advancement: 

Rhyxali is a female demon lord who rules the shadow

demons. Unlike such princes as Demogorgon, Orcus,

and Grazzt, she maintains a low profile. Her servants

run a brisk trade in both souls and information as they

flit amid the infinite Abyss. She controls an entire layer,

the home of the shadow demons, and does not covet a

larger realm. Rhyxali seems content to gain more per-

sonal power by trafficking in secrets and souls. She

delights in killing and deceit.

Rhyxalis layer of the Abyss, called Shaddonon, is a

8

place of darkness. Within its dim twilight, nestled

among forests of shadows, lie hidden cities full of out-

cast demons and rogue beings of all sorts. The main

inhabitants, however, are shadow demons.

Few have seen Rhyxalis true form and lived to tell

the tale. She is a tall, humanoid woman with jet-black

skin. The color of her flesh, and the fact that she has six

fingers on each hand, lends credence to the idea that

she is related to Grazztperhaps his sister. Neither

speaks of the issue; they seem to have no special like or

dislike for each other.

Rhyxalis symbol is a jet-black dagger.

Combat

Rhyxali detests straightforward combat. She likes to

stalk her prey unseen, striking with surprise when con-

ditions suit her. She fights with two longswords; both

blades usually bear poison such as bebilith venom,

devils eye, or vilestar, depending on whom she

might encounter.

Sneak Attack: Rhyxali can make sneak attacks as a

20th-level rogue.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, blur,

damning darkness, darkbolt, deeper darkness, desecrate,

detect good, detect law, detect thoughts, dream, greater dis-

pelling, improved invisibility, major image, mirage arcana,

mirror image, phantasmal killer, suggestion, telekinesis,

teleport without error, tongues (self only), unhallow,

unholy aura, unholy blight, wretched blight; 1/day

disintegrate, shapechange, veil. Caster level 20th; save

DC 19 + spell level.

Fast Healing: Rhyxali regains hit points at the

rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and

it does not allow her to regrow or reattach lost body

parts.

Incorporeality: As a standard action, Rhyxali can

become incorporeal for as long as she desires. While

incorporeal,  Rhyxali  appears  as  a  large  humanoid

shadow. During this time, she receives the incorporeal

subtype, and the following changes to her statistics are

in effect for as long as she remains incorporeal: Large

outsider (chaotic, evil, incorporeal); AC 35, touch 35,

flat-footed  24;  Atk  +49/+44/+39/+34  melee

(1d85/1720, +5 longsword); SQ incorporeal subtype;

Str ; Climb +18, Jump +4; Cleave and Power Attack

unavailable. She requires a standard action to return to

her natural state.

Outsider Traits: Rhyxali has darkvision (60-foot

range). She cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Summon Tanar ri (Sp): Once per day, Rhyxali can

summon 1d2+1 glabrezu or 1d2 marliliths automati-

cally.

Summon Shadow Demons (Sp): Three times per day,

Rhyxali can summon 1d6+1 shadow demons automati-

cally.

Tanarri Traits: Rhyxali is immune to poision and

electricity. She has acid resistance 20, cold resistance

20, and fire resistance 20. Rhyxali can communicate

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that

has a language (except dretches).

Possessions: Rhyxali wields two +5 longswords.

The Goals of Rhyxali

Shadow  demons  travel  throughout  the  Lower

Planes virtually unnoticed. As they do, they see

everything and report it back to their mistress. Rhyx-

ali sells some of this information to wealthy buyers

(who pay in magic or souls) but keeps the best tidbits

to exploit herself.

Like night hags, shadow demons also trade in souls.

Shaddonons reputation as the Abysss main soul-trad-

ing center draws many visitors willing to pay vast

sums. Even other demon princes send emissaries to

Rhyxali make deals. Virtually all powerful demons call

Rhyxali their ally even though many fear her ability to

strike unseen, slay, and leave again unnoticed. None of

them trust her completely, but she knows enough not

to trust them either.

Rhyxali has slight regard for the Material Plane or

its mortal inhabitants. Mortals have souls and souls

are a commodity; she thinks of them as little more

than livestock.

The Cult of Rhyxali

Very few mortals worship Rhyxali. She neither seeks

their adoration nor notices its absence. Although a few

ruined temples located in isolated locales hold services

in her name, she really has no cultjust scattered

undead shadows whispering foul rites dedicated to her,

The Servants of Rhyxali

Rhyxalis second in command is a marilith sorcerer

named Viractuth. As the shadow demons return, she

organizes the secrets and knowledge theyve gathered.

She dwells in a huge, shadowy library filled with hand-

9

written tomes only she can read. The books organiza-

tion seems so chaotic that no one but Viractuth can

find anything of relevance in the collection, let alone

decipher it.

More often than not, a Large shadow demon named

Kadasha serves at Rhyxalis side. This creature backs up

the demon princess while she stalks foes. It not only

provides an adequate pair of eyes on her back but acts

as an excellent flanking ally as well.

Constrict (Ex): Viractuth deals 4d6+6 points of

bludgeoning damage against a held Medium-size or

smaller opponent with each successful grapple check.

The constricted creature must succeed at a Fortitude

save (DC 19) or lose consciousness for as long as it

remains in the coils and for 2d4 rounds thereafter.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Viractuth hits a Medium-

size or smaller opponent with her tail slam attack, she

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple

without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +17). If she hits with the tail slam, she can also

constrict in the same round. Viractuth has the option

to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use her

claw to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but Viractuth is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check she makes

during successive rounds automatically deals tail slam

and constrict damage.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Monte Cook started working professionally in the

game industry in 1988. In the employ of Iron Crown

Enterprises, he worked with the Rolemaster and Cham-

pions games as an editor, developer, and designer.

In  1994  Monte  came  to  work  at TSR  as  a  game

designer. As a senior game designer with Wizards of

the  Coast,  he  codesigned  the  new  edition  of

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and authored the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide. His recent Wizards releases include

the Book of Vile Darkness and the Call of Cthulhu d20

Roleplaying Game.

A graduate of the Clarion West writers workshop,

Monte has also published short stories and two novels.

In his spare time, he runs anywhere from one to three

games per week, holds a yearly game convention at his

house, builds vast dioramas out of LEGO building

bricks, and reads a lot of comics.

Monte  designed  the  May  through  August  2001

adventures and the April and July 2002 adventures for

the Official D&D Website. To read more of his recent

tain constructs, are immune to the attacks of a shadow

demon.  Corporeal  foes  attempting  to  grapple  the

shadow demon can only attempt to escape; they cant

deal damage or pin in a grapple.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Kadasha hits a Medium-

size or smaller opponent with both claw attacks, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportu-

nity (grapple bonus +31). If it hits with both claws, it

can also rake. Kadasha has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its claws to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

shadow demon is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals damage from

both claws.

Pounce (Ex): If Kadasha dives or leaps upon a foe

during the first round of combat, it can make a full

attack (including a rake attempt, see below) even

though it has moved.

Rake (Ex): On any round that Kadasha has a hold on

an opponent (see Improved Grab, above), it can make

two rake attacks (+26 melee touch) with its hind legs for

1d6 points of vile damage each. The shadow demon can

also attempt to rake when it pounces on an opponent.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will: darkness; 1/daydeeper

darkness, damning darkness; 1/weekmagic jar. Caster

level 10th; save DC 17 + spell level.

Darkness  Enhancement  (Ex):  Kadasha  gains

power from being within total darkness. It gains a +4

enhancement bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls,

saves, and skill and ability checks in such conditions.

Immunities (Su): Kadasha is immune to fire, cold,

and electricity as well as mind-affecting effects, poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is not subject

to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy

drain, or death from massive damage.

Incorporeal Subtype: Kadasha can be harmed only

by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weap-

ons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities.

It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corpo-

real source, except for force effects or attacks made with

ghost touch weapons. Kadasha can pass through solid

objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore

natural  armor,  armor,  and  shields,  but  deflection

bonuses and force effects work normally against them.

Kadasha always moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

LeafletsofTriel

By Seraph of Babel

2. Variant Rules

According to some records, the archdevil Baal-

zebul kept the book [of vile darkness] in his per-

sonal  library  for  a  time,  adding  a  few  pages  of

his own

Book of Vile Darkness, p.14

The Leaflets of Triel is an unofficial

v3.5 edition update for Book of Vile

Darkness,  a  Dungeons  &  Dragons

mature  product.  This  update  is  de-

rived  from  vile  materials  printed

in  new  source  books,  queries  ad-

dressed  by  the  author  Monte  Cook

in  his  website  forum,  and  personal

interpretations and adjustments.

Sample  NPCs,  such  as  the  ser-

vants and cultists of the archfiends,

are not included in this update. Many

of them are probably best built from

skretch,  instead  of  updating  them,

since  some  monsters  (e.g.  balor)  underwent  signifi-

cant changes in v3.5.

1. The Nature of Evil

The Book of Vile Darkness

Errata,  p.14,  sidebar  paragraph  4:  Change  demon

lord Baalzebul to archdevil Baalzebul.

Vile Gods: The Patient One

His favored weapon is light flail. Updated in Lords of

Madness, pp.177-178.

The Dread Emperor

Replace p.17, paragraph 5: One of his favorite tactics

is  to  cast  a  corrupted  maximized  fireball  and  a  cor-

rupted quickened fireball in the first round, followed

by meteor swarm in the second round.

Assume  the  captive  children  to  be  1st-level  com-

moners with 1d6 hit points (1d4 plus random Consti-

tution modifier).

Possession As Prestige Class

If  you  have  Fiend  Folio,  you  may  use  fiend  of  pos-

session prestige class (pp.204-207) instead of the pos-

session  rules  in  Book  of  Vile  Darkness.  In  addition,

there are 2 other prestige classes for making a better

fiend: fiend of corruption (tempter type)

and  fiend  of  blasphemy  (devil  worship

type).

Possessed Objects: Enhancer

Once  granted,  the  fiend  cannot  change

the  enhancements  of  the  possessed

weapon  or  armor.  The  fiend  may  still

take the ability away or restore the same

ability as a free action.

The Calling

Creatures  affected  by  the  Calling  may

warrant  an  increase  in  Challenge  Rat-

ing. Since the effect of the Calling var-

ies from creature to creature, there is no fixed CR ad-

justment.

Dark Chant & Dark Speech

Using Dark Chant is a free action. Using Dark Speech

is a standard action. Dark Speech is an extraordinary

effect.

Souls As Power

If you have Complete Warrior (pp.136-137), there is

a  special  material  called  thinaun. A  thinaun  weapon

that touches a creature at his death will trap the dying

creatures soul. This would be an effective receptacle

for soul collectors everywhere.

Munchkin Alert!: Pain As Power

A leader may try to attract followers among masoch-

ists  (p.10)  or  simply  cast  masochism  spell  on  them.

Keep them happy by using a pain extractor (p.115) or

casting liquid pain spell on them. This makes your fol-

lowers happy and provides lots of liquid pain (worth

200 gp per dose).

Hivemind

Errata,  p.34,  paragraph  4: A  hivemind  of  1,000  rats



3. Evil Equipment

Drugs In Your Campaign

Errata, p.42, Satiation, column 1, line 9: Replace 1d2

points of Wisdom damage with 1d3 points of Dex-

terity damage.

The addiction effects are expanded (revised) rules,

superceding those found in Lords of Darkness, p.185.

Mordayn Vapor (Dreammist)

Errata, p.42, column 2, Initial Effect: Replace d20+10

minutes with 1d20+10 minutes.

Lingering Effects of Evil

Whether  these  effects  affect  Player  Characters  or  not

is up to the DM. If the lingering evil affects them, they

should be allowed a Will save (for mental effects) or

Fort save (for physical effects) against DC 5 per stage

of  lingering  evil  (DC  20  for  darkness  the  world  has

never seen before).

If you have Heroes of Horror, you can use tainted

locations (p.68) as a lingering effect of evil.

has a Charisma of 24 (not 22), so it would cast spells

as  a  7th-level  sorcerer  (not  5th-level).  The  hivemind

has six cantrips, eight 1st-level spells, eight 2nd-level

spells, eight 3rd-level spells and five 4th-level spells.

Munchkin Alert!: Hivemind Overgod

Hivemind rules are developed before the swarm sub-

type,  so  you  might  want  to  rule  that  hivemind  is  not

applicable to creatures with swarm subtype.

Sacremon  noted  that  a  swarm  of  fine  creatures

would  make  a  hivemind  capable  of  killing  a  small

pantheon of deities (Int 207, Cha 202, casts spells as a

level 185 sorcerer).

To  make  hivemind  works  with  swarm  subtypes,  I

have designed a hivemind swarm template below.

Vile Damage

Regeneration and fast healing is thwarted by vile dam-

age even if the creature is on consecrated or hallowed

ground; magical healing is still required. Vile damage

remains if a slain character is not resurrected on con-

secrated or hallowed ground. Thus, a character killed

100%  by  vile  damage  could  only  be  resurrected  on

consecrated  or  hallowed  ground.  Undead  and  objects

treat vile damage normally, i.e. needs magical healing.

If a creature resists a violated spell (e.g. fire resis-

tance  vs.  violated  fireball),  half  of  the  damage  that

actually gets through is vile. All the damage inflicted

by  an  energy  admixtured  spell  would  be  affected  by

Violate Spell feat.

Ability damage can be vile as seen in Dungeon #95

(p.97) on the orlath, but note that ray of enfeeblement

does not do real damage, it is merely a temporary ef-

fect, i.e. it cannot be made vile. Ability drain and nega-

tive levels cannot be vile as they are not damage.

Vile damage dealt as physical damage from weap-

ons should bypass all damage reduction.

1 The following clarification on vile damage is taken from Monte Cooks

forum. Steven Synder however received an e-mail reply from WOTC Cust

Serv saying that evil creatures treat vile damage as normal damage.

4. Feats

Boost Spell-like Ability

This  feat  is  redundant.  According  to  Sage  Advice

(Dragon #340), Ability Focus can be taken for each

spell-like ability, granting a permanent +2 to save DC

(instead of only 3/day).

Alternatively,  Heighten  Spell-like  Ability  feat

(Complete  Arcane,  p.80)  grants  +2  to  save  DC  and

spell level, usable 3/day.

Corrupt Spell

Remove Special text paragraph. You cannot take a

metamagic feat multiple times. Reprinted in Complete

Divine.

Corrupt Spell-like Ability

This  feat  applies  only  to  one  chosen  spell-like  abil-

ity, which can be corrupted 3/day. There is a required

minimum caster level which is based on the level of

the spell-like ability selected.

Special:  Each  time  this  feat  is  taken,  the  creature

can apply it to a different spell-like ability.

Disciple of Darkness

Prerequisites: Lawful evil alignment.

The bonus can now only be applied to one attack roll,

saving throw, ability check, skill check, or level check.

This  feat  also  functions  as  a  pact,  allowing  a  cleric

to draw spells from his patron archdevil. Updated in

Champions of Ruin, pp.23-24.

Empower Spell-like Ability

See Monster Manual, pp.303-304.

Evil Brand

No change. Reprinted in Champions of Ruin, p.23.

Poison Immunity

No change. Reprinted in Champions of Ruin, p.21.

Quicken Spell-like Ability

See Monster Manual, pp.303-304.

Malign Spell Focus

This feat has been replaced by Spell Focus (evil) feat

from Complete Divine, p.84. Save DC increases by +1

instead  of  +2.  This  effect  does  not  stack  with  Spell

Focus (school) feat.

Mortalbane

The chosen spell-like ability can be made mortalbane

3/day. There is a required minimum caster level which

is based on the level of the spell-like ability selected.

See table for Corrupt Spell-like Ability feat.

Thrall To Demon

Prerequisites: Chaotic evil alignment.

The bonus can now only be applied to one attack roll,

saving throw, ability check, skill check, or level check.

This feat also functions as a pact, allowing a cleric to

draw  spells  from  his  patron  demon  lord.  Updated  in

Champions of Ruin, pp.23-24.

Vile Martial Strike

A  critical  hit  applies  the  multiplier  to  the  additional

vile damage.

Vile Natural Attack

A  critical  hit  applies  the  multiplier  to  the  additional

vile damage.

Deconstructing Metamagic Spell-like Abilities

Metamagic spell-like ability feats (Empower  and  Quicken)  are always usable 3/day and requires a minimum

caster level. To convert a metamagic feat to a metamagic spell-like ability feat, multiply the metamagic spell slot

level adjustment by 2 to get the minimum caster level for 0th-level spell and +2 for each spell level thereafter.

For example, Widen Spell feat uses a spell slot 3 levels higher than normal. So, Widen Spell-like Ability has a

minimum caster level of 6 for 0th-level spell, 8 for 1st-level spell, 10 for 2nd-level spell, etc.

However, consecrate spell-like ability feat in Book of Exalted Deeds (v3.5), p.42, is still in the same format as

Book of Vile Darkness. This is probably an oversight, which can be corrected using the same method above.



Violate Spell

Remove  Special  text  paragraph. You  cannot  take  a

metamagic feat multiple times.

Violate Spell-like Ability

The  chosen  spell-like  ability  can  be  violated  3/day.

There  is  a  required  minimum  caster  level  which  is

based on the level of the spell-like ability selected. See

table for Corrupt Spell-like Ability feat.

5. Prestige Classes

Skills  and  feats  are  updated.  Certain  summon  fiend

abilities  are  changed  to  reflect  the  new  upgrades  to

fiends Challenge Ratings.

Cancer Mage

Class Skills: Remove Alchemy and Intuit Direction.

Add Survival.

Contagion (Sp): Save DC should be 14 + Charisma

modifier. Caster level is twice the class level, up to

the cancer mages total HD.

Poison (Sp): Save DC should be 14 + Charisma

modifier. Caster level is twice the class level, up to

the cancer mages total HD.

Demonologist

Requirements: Replace Malign Spell Focus feat with

Spell Focus (evil).

Class Skills: Remove Alchemy and Scry. Add Craft

(alchemy).

Quasit Familiar (Ex): Demonologist class levels

stack with wizard/sorcerer levels for the purpose of

determining familiar ability.

Summoning Mastery (Su): This also applies to

summon monster spells from another class. So if a

wizard 17/demonologist 6 casts a summon monster

IX spell, he can summon 1d4+1 bebiliths.

Diabolist

Requirements: Remove special requirement to cast

shriveling. Add Must be able to cast 4 spells with

evil descriptor.2

Class Skills: Remove Scry.

Imp Familiar (Ex): When the imp devours the

familiar, the diabolist does not suffer XP loss.

Diabolist class levels stack with wizard/sorcerer

levels for the purpose of determining familiar

ability.

Disciple of Asmodeus

Class Skills: Remove Innuendo and Scry.

2 Monte Cook said on his website, The ability to cast shriveling

merely requires it to be on your spell list. This merely means you

must  be  a  sorcerer  or  wizard. A  diabolist  works  with  devils  and

there is nothing particularly devilish about the shriveling spell. If

it is a matter of having soul rot disease, then it should be Special:

Must have soul rot disease. In which case, Cook suggested using

suspend disease spell to ward it off.



Disciple of Baalzebul

Class Skills: Remove Innuendo and Pick Pocket. Add

Bluff and Sleight of Hand.

Summon Devil (Sp): Replace summon cornugon

(v3.0, CR10) with summon hamatula (v3.5,

modifier).

class level instead of at will.

Body of Flame (Su): This provides damage reduction

10/magic or good instead of 30/+1.

Lifedrinker

Boost Defenses (Ex): A lifedrinker increases his

damage reduction by 5 points instead of gaining

20/+2. For example, a vampire with damage

reduction 10/silver and magic would increase it to

15/silver and magic with this ability.

Blood Revel (Ex): A lifedrinker increases his normal

damage reduction by 10 points instead of gaining

25/+3. He also gains damage reduction 10/good.

Mortal Hunter

Requirements: Replace Wilderness Lore skill with

Wilderness Lore with Survival.

Soul Eater

3 The Disciples of Baalzebul and Mammon are purposely designed

you can allow a thrall of Juiblex to summon an alikith

(pp.46-47),  even  though  it  has  1  more  HD  than  nor-

mally allowed by the thralls summon ability.

Thrall of Orcus

Class Skills: Remove Scry.

Carrion Stench (Ex): Remove Furthermore, mindless

undead creatures within the radius of the stench

functions as a slay living spell.5

Ur-Priest

Requirements: Replace Malign Spell Focus feat with

Spell Focus (evil) feat.

Class Skills: Remove Scry.

Updated in Complete Divine, pp.70-72.

Vermin Lord

Class Skills: Replace Pick Pocket with Sleight of

Hand.

Errata, p.74, Table 5-17: Remove pincer claws

from 8th-level class feature. This ability does not

exist.

Warrior of Darkness

Requirements: Replace Alchemy skill with Craft

(alchemy).

4 Monte Cook said in his forum, 1/day per class level. However,

if  you  refer  to  the  sample  thrall  on  p.132,  it  says  1/day,  despite

Besmal being a 6th-level thrall.

5 Monte Cook said, 1/day per class level. However, it might be

more balancing to use the same mechanics as Thrall of Demogor-

gons death touch class feature.



Class Skills: Remove Scry. Replace Alchemy with

6. Magic

Craft (alchemy).

Black Magic Elixir (Su): Remove Ambidexterity,

5/magic.

Corrupt Magic

Any spellcaster, including rangers, paladins, etc., can

cast corrupt spells from scrolls, wands, or like magic

items as if the spells are on his spell list.

Errata, p.78: Replace (There are no corrupt spells

with a permanent duration.) with Corrupt spells with

a permanent duration deal damage at the beginning of

the casting. This is due to consume likeness spell.

st-Level Bard Spells

Errata, p.79: Remove corrupt weapon.

st-Level Blackguard Spells

Corruption Domain

Replace the granted power with the following. Updated

in Lords of Madness, p.207.

Granted Power: Once per day as a standard action,

you  can  make  a  melee  touch  attack  against  a  living

creature to deal 1d6 damage per 2 levels and sicken the

target for 1 round.

Darkness Domain

Renamed as Vile Darkness domain in Lords of Mad-

The  1d6  damage  dealt  to  unattended  objects  bypass

any remaining hardness. Updated in Lords of Madness,

p.210.

Bestow Greater Curse

Change Transmutation to Necromancy, as with bestow

curse spell. However, the reprinted spell (bestow curse,

Vile Darkness.)

Clutch of Orcus

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Updated in Libris Mortis, p.63.

Consume Likeness

Any equipment duplicated by this spell should be mere

cosmetic. They do not possess any unusual or magical

properties. The equipment vanishes when the caster re-

verts back to his normal form.

This  update  is  necessary,  as  noted  by  Besnode  in

Monte Cooks forum: Otherwise youd just have eat

the  possessor  of  an  artifact  to  duplicate  that  artifact,

and that would just be silly.

Distort Weapon

With respect to bypassing damage reduction, the weap-

on is considered to be evil-aligned, instead of +1.

7. Lords of Evil

Some people may prefer to have more powerful arch-

fiends than those found in the book. Even if one takes

this approach, the original statistic blocks can still be

used as some sort of avatars or greater aspects for the

archfiends.  (See  Miniatures  Handbook  for  details  on

aspects.)

Physical damages have been changed to match the

guidelines  in  Monster  Manual,  p.296. All  energy  re-

sistance listed under Baatezu Traits and Tanarri Traits

should be reduced from 20 to 10.

Epic Damage Reduction?

For  some  unknown  reasons,  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds

does  not  give  the  celestial  paragons  epic  damage  re-

duction. To balance with it, the archfiends here would

not have it as well. If desired, you can add and epic

to the end of the archfiends damage reduction. If you

do so, remember to do the same for celestial paragons.

When  you  apply  the  bone  creature  template  from  the

Book  of  Vile  Darkness,  what  happens  to  the  creatures

Challenge Rating?

The CR is the same as the base creature, +1.

There is an Alchemy DC (25) listed for liquid pain

in  the  Book  of  Vile  Darkness.  Is  an  Alchemy  check

required when using a pain extractor or casting the

liquid  pain  spell?  Is  the  check  needed  to  change

what comes from the magic item or spell to turn it

into  the  drug?  If  so,  is  the  process  also  needed  to

change  liquid  pain  into  whatever  form  is  needed

when  using  it  for  experience  (for  example,  pain  as

power)?

Both  the  pain  extractor  item  and  the  liquid  pain  spell

produce  the  agony  (liquid  pain)  drug.  Agony  drug  produced

by  either  method  is  ready  to  use  and  does  not  require  an

Alchemy check.

An  alchemist  also  can  make  agony  according  to  the  rules

for  creating  any  other  alchemical  item.  Creating  pain

alchemically is usually slower and more expensive than using

the spell or the item.

No Alchemy check is required to use pain as power.

The description of the  Dark  Speech mentions that you

can  hold  conversations  in  it  if  you  are  knowledgeable  in

the  language.  Does  that  mean  you  need  to  take  the  feat

and also spend skill points (on the Speak Language skill)

to  speak  in  the  Dark  Speech?  Or  is  taking  the  feat

enough?

You  cannot  learn  the  Dark  Speech  simply  by  taking  the

Speak  Language  skill.  You  have  to  take  the  feat  instead.

Taking the feat is enoughwhen you take the feat you learn

the Dark Speech without spending any skill points.

The discussion of corrupt spells on page 78 in the Book

of  Vile  Darkness  says  corrupt  spells  have  no  material

components.  However,  the  apocalypse  from  the  sky  and

evil  weather  spells  are  corrupt  spells  with  material

components (an artifact and amethysts, respectively). Are

they supposed to be focuses?

A  focus  is  a  material  component  (just  not  a  material

component that is consumed in the casting of the spell). The

two spell descriptions are correct, page 78 is wrong; however,

the artifact needed for the apocalypse from the sky spell is a

focus and is not consumed when the spell is cast.

Page  78  of  the  Book  of  Vile  Darkness  says  that  the

corruption cost for casting a corrupt spell occurs after the

spell  ends,  and  thus  there  are  no  corrupt  spells  with  a

permanent duration. The consume likeness and forbidden

speech  spells  are  both  corrupt  spells  and  are  permanent.

When are the corruption costs for these spells paid?

The spell descriptions are correct. In each case, the caster

pays  the  corruption  cost  upon  completing  the  spell  (rather

than when the spell ends).

If  a  spellcaster  is  immune  to  ability  drain  (such  as  by

being  undead),  can  he  still  cast  corrupt  spells?  I  seem  to

recall  that  there  is  a  spell  somewhere  that  can  protect

in

the  D&D  game

someone  from  ability  damage  as  well,  so  how  about  in

that case? Can you heal corruption costs?

The  negative  energy  protection  spell  prevents  the  loss  of

ability  scores  and  levels  to  attacks  that  employ  negative

energy. A corruption cost is not a negative energy effect, and

negative energy protection wont prevent it. While defensive

special  qualities

are  usually

insurmountable, the corruption cost for the spell represents a

direct  assault  on  the  physical  and  mental  well-being  of  the

caster,  and  anyone  who  casts  a  corrupt  spell  has  to  pay  the

cost,  even  if  normally  immune  to  ability  damage,  ability

drain,  or  energy  drain.  The  act  of  casting  a  corrupt  spell

makes  the  caster  briefly  vulnerable  to  the  corruption  cost  of

the spell.

When  an  undead  creature  uses  a  corrupt  spell  with  an

ability  damage  or  ability  drain  corruption  cost,  the  undead

creature  takes  the  damage  or  the  drain  against  its  Charisma

score,  no  matter  what  ability  the  spell  normally  damages  or

drains. If the damage or drain reduces the undead creatures

Charisma to 0, the creature becomes helpless until the loss of

Charisma  is  somehow  restored  or  repaired.  Any  ability

damage from a corruption cost heals at the rate of 1 point per

day,  just like any  other  ability  damage.  Ability drain  can  be

healed by the appropriate spells.

Note  that  undead  creatures  with  Intelligence  scores  can

heal  normal  ability  damage  just  as  living  creatures  can.  For

example, a lich casts Lahms finger darts and suffers 1 point

of  Charisma  damage  per  dart  (the  spell  normally  damages

Strength,  but  a  lich  is  an  undead  creature,  so  it  suffers

Charisma  damage  instead).  The  Charisma  damage  the  lich

suffers  heals  at  the  rate  of  1  point  per  day,  and  the  lichs

fingers are replaced as the Charisma damage heals.

When a spell requires both Undead and Fiend (such as

flesh  ripper),  does  the  creature  have  to  be  an  undead

fiend, or is it an either/or type of thing?

While  most  spells  require  all  the  material  components

listed  for  them,  the  demon,  devil,  fiend,  and  undead

components  from  the  Book  of  Vile  Darkness  are  special.  If

more than one of these are listed, the caster need satisfy only

one of them.

If  a  character  with  the  Dark  Speech  feat  and  a

Charisma  score  of  15  used  the  Dark  Speech  to  inspire

dread,  suffering  1d4  points  of  Charisma  damage  in  the

process, it is my understanding that the character would

then  be  unable  to  use  the  Dark  Speech  again  until  the

Charisma damage is healed, since she no longer meets the

feat prerequisites. Is this correct?

Yes,  that  is  correct.  If  you  have  a  feat  that  has  a

prerequisite, you cannot use the feat if you no longer meet the

prerequisite. Ability drain or ability damage can often render

you unable to use your feats.

The  prerequisites  for  the  Dark  Speech  feat  include  a

Charisma of 15 or higher and an Intelligence of 15 or higher.

Anything  that  reduces  Charisma  or  Intelligence  to  less  than

15  renders  the  Dark  Speech  feat  unusable  until  the  loss  is

restored, and that includes Charisma damage from using the

feat.

In any case, the villains in your campaign would do well to

employ some undetectable alignment and misdirection spells,

both of which last a fairly long time and were meant to foil

the  profligate  use  of  the  various  detect  spells.  A  creature  or

object  that  has  received  an  undetectable  alignment  spell  has

no  aura  of  chaos,  evil,  good,  or  law  no  matter  what  its

alignment  really  is.  The  misdirection  spell  usually  doesnt

last as long as undetectable alignment, but it allows the user

to literally switch auras with some object. A clever villain can

usually  assume  whatever  aura  he  wants  with  this  spell,  just

by casting the spell when a suitable object is at hand.

Lingering auras occur when the original source of the aura

is  gone.  For  example,  an  evil  creature  has  an  evil  aura.  If  it

dies, the inert body left behind has no alignment, but an aura

of  evil  lingers  in  and  on  the  body  for  a  time.  The  length  of

time the aura lingers depends on the original strength of the

aura, as noted in the detect evil spell description. A creature

or objects aura does not rub off or attach itself to anything

else. For example, you cannot track an evil creature by using

detect evil to detect lingering auras of evil it leaves behind as

it movesbecause it doesnt leave behind any lingering aura.

Likewise,  if  you  obtain  a  suspect  creatures  equipment,  you

cant  learn  anything  about  that  creatures  alignment  by

studying  it  with  a  detect  evil  spell  (but  you  could  learn

something from a piece of the creature itself).

he have to meet the prerequisites for the Dark Speech to

actually use the Dark Speech?

No. Consuming the elixir allows a creature to use the Dark

Speech  for  10  minutes.  The  imbiber  must  have  enough

Intelligence to actually use language (Intelligence of at least

3),  but  does  not  have  to  have  the  Dark  Speech  feat  or  meet

the feats prerequisites.

At 5th level, monks gain immunity from diseases except

for  magical  ones  such  as  mummy  rot  or  lycanthropy.

However, diseases arent listed in the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide as magical. Rather, theyre listed as being either

normal  or  supernatural.  Should  one  assume  that  monks

are  immune  to  all  normal  diseases,  but  not  supernatural

ones?  Or  is  it  that  a  monk  is  resistant  to  all  diseases

except those that require magical cures, which is the case

for  both  the  example  diseases  listed?  This  issue  becomes

especially  important  considering  that  all  the  diseases

listed in the Book of Vile Darkness are supernatural, and

there are a lot of them to catch.

The contagion spell produces a magical disease. A monk

is subject to the effects of this spell, no matter what diseases

the  caster  chooses  to  inflict.  Monks  also  are  susceptible  to

supernatural  disease  such  as  mummy  rot.  When  the  monk

description  says  magical  disease  it  means  magical  or

supernatural disease.

Theres  a  sidebar  on  page  187  of  the  Book  of  Vile

Darkness  that  deals  with  detecting  evil.  The  sidebar  says

not all evil characters have an evil aura that registers with

the detect evil spell or similar spell-like abilities. Does this

mean  your  average  evil  fighter  isnt  detected?  The

description  of  the  detect  evil  spell  seems  to  indicate  that

any  evil  creature  has  at  least  a  faint  evil  aura.  For

example,  an  evil  creature  has  an  aura  strength  of  HD/5,

and an aura strength of 1 or less is faint, so an evil fighter

of 1st level has a faint evil aura, right? If that isnt true,

what  exactly  does  a  detect  evil  spell  detect?  Is  it

alignment?  Is  it  just  certain  monsters?  Ive  always  had

difficulty hiding my villains from the PCs. They just walk

around casting detect evil on everything until they find the

villain.

Also, what is a lingering aura and how does a creature

or area get one? Does an evil creature leave a trail of evil

wherever it goes?

The  detect  evil  spell  detects  evil  auras.  As  you  point  out,

any evil creature (that is, any creature with an evil alignment)

has at least a faint evil aura. So, the sidebar is wrong. Note,

however,  that  it  can  be  pretty  difficult  to  pin  down  exactly

where an evil aura is or which creature it belongs to.

When  one  first  studies  an  area  with  detect  evil,  the  spell

reveals  only  the  presence  or  absence  of  evil  somewhere

within  the  fairly  large  area  the  spell  covers  (and  remember

that the spell can penetrate barriers and detect auras that are

in range but out of sight, inaccessible, or both). Only after 3

consecutive  rounds  of  scanning  the  same  area  does  a  detect

evil spell reveal the locations of any evil auras in that area. If

the  caster  should  scan  a  different  area,  she  has  to  start  the

whole process all over again. Thus, an evil villain who moves

around a little bit may rouse the PCs suspicion, but the PCs

cant  be  sure  who  or  what  actually  goes  with  any  particular

evil aura theyve detected, especially if the villain is part of a
