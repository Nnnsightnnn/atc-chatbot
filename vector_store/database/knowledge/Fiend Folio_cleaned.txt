INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Fiend Folio! This book contains more than

250 creatures for use in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adven-

tures. This introduction explains how to read a monsters

write-up,  including  summaries  of  the  most  common

attacks and abilities.

The monster entries are arranged alphabetically by name.

Monsters of the same kind are grouped under their major

entry; for instance, the piscoloth and skeroloth are both

described in the yugoloth entry.

Appendix 1 details three prestige classes suited for

monstersthe fiend of blasphemy, fiend of corruption,

and fiend of possession. Appendix 2 describes grafts, which

are body parts that can be applied to a creatures usual phys-

iology, and symbionts, a class of creatures that are most

commonly found living in or on another creature. Finally, a

list of monsters organized by Challenge Rating may be

found in Appendix 3.

NAME

The first line of a monster entry gives the name by which

the creature is generally known. The descriptive text may

mention alternate names.

SIZE AND TYPE

This line begins with the creatures size (Huge, for example).

The eight size categories are briefly described in the table

below. A size modifier applies to the creatures Armor Class

(AC) and attack bonus, as well as to modifiers for certain

skill checks. A creatures size also determines how far it can

reach to make a melee attack and how much space it occu-

pies in a fight (see Face/Reach, below).

The size and type line continues with the creatures type

(Giant, for example). Type determines how magic affects a

creature; for example, the hold animal spell affects only crea-

tures of the animal type. Type determines certain features,

such as Hit Dice size, base attack, base saving throws, and

skill points. Refer to the Monster Manual for details on dif-

ferent types and subtypes.

The Fiend Folio introduces or revises the following sub-

READING THE ENTRIES

Each monster entry is organized in the same general

format. An entry is composed of a statistics block, providing

basic game information about the creature in condensed

form, and a section of descriptive text where the creatures

types.

THE PLANES OF EXISTENCE

Manual of the Planes describes the planes of the standard D&D cosmol-

ogy  in  great  depth.  These  planes  fall  into  five  categories:  the  Material

Plane or Planes, Transitive Planes (Astral, Ethereal, and Shadow), Inner

Planes  (Air,  Earth,  Fire,  Water,  Positive  Energy,  and  Negative  Energy),

Outer  Planes,  and  Demiplanes.  Most  of  the  extraplanar  creatures

described  in  this  book  come  from  the  Outer  Planes,  though  some

elementals  originate  on  the  Inner  Planes  and  there  are  a  handful  of

Ethereal creatures here as well. The Outer Planes in the D&D cosmol-

ogy correspond to alignments, with shading between (the plane of

Acheron,  for  example,  lies  between  the  lawful  evil  plane  of  the  Nine

Hells and the lawful neutral plane of Mechanus).

The table below shows the short names for the planes that appear

in  climate/terrain  entries  in  this  book  and  the  full  names  used  in

Manual of the Planes.

In addition to the planes that appear in the standard D&D cosmology,

variant planes and cosmologies appear in the appendix to Manual of

the Planes, including the Region of Dreams, the Far Realm, and the

Plane of Mirrors. A few extraplanar monsters in this book originate

on these planes.

planes of the D&D cosmology or the variant planes referenced in this

book,  you  can  assign  new  home  planes  to  monsters  as  you  see  fit.

Realm,  might  instead  come  from  Limbo  or  a  similar  plane  in  your

applies to any creature when it appears on a plane that is not

its home plane. Every extraplanar creature in this book has

a home plane mentioned in its description. These home

planes are taken from the cosmology of the D&D game, as

set forth in Manual of the Planes. (If your campaign uses a dif-

ferent cosmology, you will need to assign different home

planes to extraplanar creatures.)

Creatures that originate from a plane of existence other

than the Material Plane are marked with the extraplanar

subtype, under the assumption that the campaign takes

place on the Material Plane. When characters travel to

Acheron, however, a bonespear encountered

there is no longer an extraplanar creature

on the contrary, the characters themselves

now have the extraplanar subtype. The

Climate/Terrain entry for each extra-

planar  monster  in  this  book

gives its home plane.

An extraplanar creature

can be targeted with a

dismissal or banishment

spell, suffers the full

effects of a blasphemy,

dictum, holy word, or

word  of  chaos spell

(based on its align-

ment), and can be

called or summoned

by various spells including gate, the planar ally

and planar binding spells, and possibly summon

monster spells.

Elementals and outsiders encountered on the

Material Plane always have this subtype. Mon-

sters from the Monster Manual with this subtype,

besides all elementals and outsiders (except plane-

touched), include the bodak (native to the Abyss), the

ethereal marauder (native to the Ethereal Plane),

the retriever (native to the Abyss), and any creature

with the celestial or fiendish template (native to the

Upper and Lower Outer Planes, respectively).

On certain planes, known as transitive planes, no crea-

tures have the extraplanar subtype. The transitive planes

in the D&D cosmology are the Astral Plane, the Ethereal

Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.

Fire Subtype: (Ex) A creature with the fire subtype is

immune to fire damage. It takes half again as much (+50%)

damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving

throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

Shapechanger Subtype: A shapechanger has the

supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate

forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape

shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes is

a shapechanger.

Swarm Type or Subtype: A swarm is a collection of

Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures (usually creatures

of the vermin type) that acts as a single creature. A

swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted

here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit

points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a

single Armor Class. The swarm makes saving throws as a

single creature.

A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of

nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 5 feet

on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component crea-

tures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponents

space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can

occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it

crawls all over its prey. A swarm

can move through squares

occupied by enemies

and vice versa without imped-

iment, although the swarm

provokes an attack of opportunity

if it does so. A swarm can move

through cracks or holes large enough for its com-

ponent creatures.

A swarm of Diminutive creatures con-

sists of 150 nonflying creatures or 625

flying creatures. A swarm of Fine crea-

tures consists of 10,000 creatures,

whether they are flying or not.

Swarms  of  nonflying  creatures

include many more creatures than

could normally fit in a 5-foot square

based on their normal face, because creatures in a

swarm are packed tightly together and generally

crawl  over  each  other  and  their  prey  when

moving or attacking. Larger swarms are rep-

resented by multiple swarms, or multiple

five-foot squares. A swarm of 200,000 plague

ants is 20 plague ant swarms, each swarm

occupying a 5-foot square. A large swarm is

completely shapeable, though it usually

remains contiguous.

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no

clear front or back and no dis-

cernible anatomy, so it is not subject to

critical hits or flanking. A swarm made

up of Tiny creatures takes half damage

from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm com-

posed of Fine or Diminutive creatures are immune to all

weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the

swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point

does not diminish its ability to attack or resist attack.

Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by

damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull

rushed, and they cannot grapple another.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a

specific number of creatures (including single-target

spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-

affecting effects if the swarm has an intelligence score and

a hive mind. A swarm has a 10 penalty on saving throws

against spells or effects that affect an area, such as many

evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area effect

attack does not allow a saving throw, the swarm takes

double damage instead.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are

susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of

wind spell. For purposes of determining the effect of wind

on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size

as its constituent creatures. For example, a swarm of

abyssal ants (Diminutive creatures) can be blown away by

a severe wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual

damage to the swarm per spell level (or Hit Die of the orig-

inating creature, in the case of effects such as an air ele-

mentals whirlwind). A swarm rendered unconscious by

means of subdual damage becomes disorganized and dis-

persed, and does not re-form until its hit points exceed its

subdual damage.

Swarm Attack: Creatures with the swarm subtype dont

make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic

damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end

of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are

not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A

swarms statistics block has Swarm on the Attacks line,

with no attack bonus. The Damage entry has Swarm, fol-

lowed by a damage range. A swarms damage is based on its

Hit Dice, as shown below:

A swarms attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarms

description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient

to reduce a swarm attacks damage to 0, being incorporeal,

and other special abilities usually make a creature immune

(or at least resistant) to damage from the swarm. Some

swarms also have acid, poison, blood drain, or other special

attacks in addition to normal damage.

Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do

not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack.

However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as

described below.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to the

swarms damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its

square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save negates the

effect (DC is 10 + 1/2 the creatures HD + Con modifier).

Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a

swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).

Using a skill that involves patience and concentration

requires a Concentration check (DC 20). Each swarm

described in this book has its distraction save DC given in

its statistics block.

HIT DICE

This line gives the number and type of Hit Dice the crea-

ture has, and any bonus hit points. A parenthetical entry

gives the creatures average hit points.

A creatures Hit Dice total is also its level for determining

how spells affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and

its maximum ranks in a skill.

INITIATIVE

This line gives the creatures modifier on initiative checks.

SPEED

This line gives the creatures speed on land (the amount

of distance it can cover in one move). If the creature

wears armor that reduces its speed, the creatures base

speed is noted.

If the creature has other modes of movement, these are

given after the land speed entry. If a creature does not have

a land speed, it almost always has some other mode of

movement. Unless noted otherwise, these other modes

of movement are natural (not magical).

Burrow: The creature can tunnel through dirt, but

not through rock unless the descriptive text says other-

wise. Creatures cannot use the run action while burrow-

ing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind tun-

nels other creatures can use (either because the material

they tunnel through fills in behind them or because

they do not actually move or dislocate any material

when burrowing), see the individual creature descrip-

tions for details.

Climb: A creature with a climb speed gains a +8 racial

bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a

Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more

than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed

or threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the

listed speed while climbing. If it chooses an accelerated

climb, it moves at double the given climb speed (or its

normal land speed, whichever is less) and makes a single

Climb check at a 5 penalty. Creatures cannot use the run

action while climbing. The creature retains its Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and oppo-

nents get no special bonus to their attacks against the

climbing creature.

Fly: The creature can fly at the given speed if carrying no

more than a light load. All fly speeds include a parenthetical

note indicating maneuverability.

Swim: A creature with a swim speed can move through

water at the given speed without making Swim checks. It

has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some

special action or avoid a hazard. The creature always can

choose to take 10, even if distracted or endangered when

swimming. Creatures can use the run action while swim-

ming, provided they swim in a straight line.

ARMOR CLASS

FULL ATTACK

The Armor Class line gives the creatures AC for normal com-

bat and includes a parenthetical mention of the modifiers

contributing to it (usually size, Dexterity, and natural

armor). The creatures touch and flat-footed ACs follow the

main entry.

A creatures armor proficiencies (if it has any at all)

depend on its type (see the Monster Manual), but in general

a  creature  is  proficient  with  any  kind  of  armor  it  is

described as wearing, as well as all lighter types of armor.

BASE ATTACK/GRAPPLE

The number before the slash in this entry is the crea-

tures base attack bonus, which is its attack bonus before

any modifiers are applied. A creatures base attack bonus

depends on its type, Hit Dice, and class level (if any).

You usually will not need this number, but it can be

handy to have sometimes, especially if the creature has

the Power Attack or Expertise feat. The number after the

slash is the creatures grapple bonus, which is used when

the creature makes

a grapple attack or

when someone tries

to grapple the crea-

ture. The grapple

bonus  includes  all

modifiers that apply

to  the  creatures  grapple

checks (base attack bonus,

Strength modifier, special

size modifier, and any other

applicable modifier, such

as  a  racial  bonus  on

grapple checks).

ATTACK

This line provides the

single physical attack

the creature uses with an attack

action (in most cases, this is also the

attack the creature uses during an attack of opportunity

as well). The entry shows the weapon, attack bonus, and

form  of  attack  (melee  or  ranged).  The  attack  bonus

includes modifications for size and Strength (for melee

attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with

the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on

melee attacks.

This line gives all the physical attacks the creature can

make when it uses the full attack action. It provides the

number of attacks along with the weapon, attack bonus,

and form of attack (melee or ranged). The first listing is

for the creatures primary weapon, with an attack bonus

including modifications for size and Strength (for melee

attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with

the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on

melee attacks.

The remaining weapons are secondary and have a 5

penalty to their attack bonus, no matter how many there

are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat (see Feats, below)

take only a 2 penalty on secondary attacks.

DAMAGE

This line gives the damage each of the creatures attacks

deals. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point,

even if a subtraction from a die roll brings the

result to 0 or lower.

Natural Weapons: The damage a creature

deals with its primary attack includes its full

Strength modifier (1 1/2 times its

Strength  bonus  if  the  primary

attack is the creatures sole natu-

ral weapon). Secondary attacks

add  only  1/2  the  creatures

Strength bonus.

If any attacks also cause some

special effect other than damage

(poison, disease, and so

forth),  that  informa-

tion is given here.

Unless  noted  other-

wise, creatures using natural

weapons deal double damage on

critical hits.

Natural weapons have types just as

other weapons do. The most common

are summarized below.

Bite: The creature attacks with its

mouth, dealing piercing, slashing,

and bludgeoning damage.

Claw or Talon: The creature rips

with a sharp appendage, dealing

piercing and slashing damage.

Gore: The creature spears the opponent with an antler,

Manufactured Weapons: Creatures that use swords,

bows, spears, and the like follow the same rules as char-

acters  do.  The  bonus  for  attacks  with  two -handed

weapons is 1 1/2 times the creatures Strength modifier

(if it is a bonus), while off-hand weapons add only 1/2 the

Strength bonus.

FACE/REACH

This line describes how much space the creature needs to

fight effectively and how close it has to be to an opponent

to threaten that opponent.

The number before the slash is the creatures face,

which tells how wide a space the creature occupies. The

number after the slash is the creatures natural reach. If

the creature has exceptional reach due to a weapon, tenta-

cle, or the like, the extended reach and its source are

noted in parentheses.

A creatures face entry is based on its size category, not its

actual dimensions. In many cases, creatures have bodies

longer than their face entries. A creatures overall length

helps account for its reach. Also, very long creatures are

assumed to rear up or coil their bodies during a fight to

facilitate maneuvering, attack, and defense.

The following table summarizes face and reach statistics

for creatures of various sizes.

1 Tall creatures are those that are taller than they are long or wide.

Long creatures are as long or longer, or as wide or wider, than they

are tall.

2 Big, long creatures may be in any of several shapes. A Huge spider

fills a 15-foot-square area, while a Huge snake fills a space 30 feet

long and 5 feet wide (unless it coils itself into a circle, in which case it

would take up a 15-foot-square area).

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Many creatures have unusual abilities, which can include

special attack forms, resistance or vulnerability to certain

types of damage, and enhanced senses, among others. A

monster entry breaks these abilities into Special Attacks

and Special Qualities. The latter category includes defenses,

vulnerabilities, and other special abilities that are not

modes of attack.

When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of

save and the DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most

saving throws against special abilities have DCs calculated

as follows: 10 + 1/2 the attackers non-class HD + the rele-

vant ability modifier). The save DC is listed in the descrip-

tive text along with the ability used to calculate it.

A special ability is either extraordinary (Ex), spell-like

(Sp), or supernatural (Su).

Extraordinary: Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical,

dont go away in an antimagic field, and are not subject to

anything that disrupts magic. Using an extraordinary abil-

ity is a free action unless noted otherwise.

Spell-Like: Spell-like abilities are magical and work just

like spells (though they are not spells and so have no verbal,

somatic, material, focus, or XP components). They go away

in an antimagic field and are subject to spell resistance.

Spell-like abilities often have a limit on the number of

times they can be used. A spell-like ability that can be used

at will has no use limit. Using a spell-like ability is a stan-

dard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while

threatened provokes an attack of opportunity. It is possible

to make a Concentration check to use a spell-like ability

defensively an avoid provoking an attack of opportunity,

just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can be dis-

rupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be

used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.

For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster

level defines how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like

effects and to define any level-dependent variable (such as

range and duration) the abilities might have. The creatures

caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the crea-

ture has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the

level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell

of the same name. If no caster level is specified, the caster

level is equal to the creatures Hit Dice.

The Dc of a saving throw (if any) against a spell-like abil-

ity is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or

duplicates + the creatures Charisma modifier.

Supernatural: Supernatural abilities are magical and go

away in an antimagic field but are not subject to spell

resistance. Using a supernatural ability is a standard

action unless noted otherwise. Supernatural abilities

may have a use limit or be usable at will, just like spell-

like abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not pro-

voke attacks of opportunity and never require Concen-

tration checks. Unless otherwise noted, a supernatural

ability has an effective caster level equal to the creatures

Hit Dice.

descriptive text.

Special Qualities

This  line  gives  all  the  creatures  special  qualities.

Details of the most common special qualities are pro-

vided in the Monster Manual. One new special quality is

described below.

Energy Vulnerability (Ex): A creature with a vulner-

ability to one of the five energy types (acid, cold, elec-

tricity,  fire,  sonic)  takes  half  again  as  much  (+50%)

damage as normal from that energy type, regardless of

whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a suc-

cess or a failure.

SAVES

This line gives the creatures Fortitude, Reflex, and Will

save modifiers, which take into account its type, ability

score modifiers, and any special qualities.

ABILITIES

This line provides the creatures six ability scores in the

order Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where noted

otherwise, each creature is assumed to have the following

array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 11, 11, 11,

10, 10, 10. To determine any creatures racial ability adjust-

ments, subtract 10 from any even-numbered ability score

and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered score. For exam-

ple, a selkie has the following ability scores: Str 9, Dex 13,

Con 11, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 12. That means a selikes racial

ability adjustments are Str 2, Dex +2, Con +0, Int +2, Wis

+0, and Cha +2.

Nonabilities: Some creatures lack certain ability scores.

These creatures do not have an ability score of 0they lack

the ability altogether. The modifier for a nonability is +0.

Other effects of nonabilities discussed below.

Strength: Any creature that can physically manipulate

other objects has at least 1 point of Strength.

A creature with no Strength score cant exert force, usu-

ally because it has no physical body (a living holocaust, for

example). The creature automatically fails Strength checks.

If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier to

its base attack instead of a Strength modifier.

Dexterity: Any creature that can move has at least 1 point

of Dexterity.

A creature with no Dexterity score cant move. If it can act

(such as by casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modi-

fier to initiative checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The

creature fails all Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.

Constitution: Any living creature has at least 1 point of

Constitution.

is unaffected by any type of poison but is susceptible to a

disintegrate spell. The creature is immune to ability damage,

ability drain, and energy drain, and always fails Constitu-

tion checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot use

the run action.

Intelligence: Any  creature  that  can  think,  learn,  or

remember has at least 1 point of Intelligence. A creature

can speak all the languages mentioned in its descriptive

text, plus one additional language per point of Intelligence

bonus. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or

higher understands at least one language (Common unless

noted otherwise).

A creature with no Intelligence score is an automaton,

operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions.

It is immune to all mind-influencing effects (charms, com-

pulsions, phantasms, patterns and morale effects) and auto-

matically fails Intelligence checks.

Wisdom: Any creature that can perceive its environment

in any fashion has at least 1 point of Wisdom.

Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a crea-

ture. Anything without a Wisdom score also has no

Charisma score, and vice versa.

Charisma: Any creature capable of telling the difference

between itself and things that are not itself has at least 1

point of Charisma.

Anything with no Charisma score is an object, not a crea-

ture. Anything without a Charisma score also has no

Wisdom score, and vice versa.

SKILLS

This line lists all the creatures skills alphabetically along

with each skills modifier, which includes adjustments for

ability scores and any bonuses from feats or racial traits.

All listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a

character class (noted in the entry). A creatures type and

Intelligence score determine the number of skill points it

has. If it lacks an Intelligence score, it doesnt have any

skill points.

are not accounted for in the statistics block.

Skill Synergy: Certain skills provide a bonus to the use

of related skills when a character has 5 or more ranks in that

skill. For instance, having 5 or more ranks in Escape Artist

provides a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks to escape from

bindings. This is expressed in a creatures statistics block

by a parenthetical note following the base skill modifier,

such as Use Rope +2 (+4 bindings).

FEATS

The line lists the creatures feats

alphabetically.  The  crea-

tures  descriptive  text

may contain additional

information  if  a  feat

works differently from how it

is  described  in  this  section,  in

Chapter 5 of the Players Handbook,

or in the Monster Manual.

Most creatures use the same feats

that are available to characters, but some have

access to one or more unique feats. See the accompanying

sidebar for descriptions of these feats. Creatures with an

Intelligence score gain feats at the same rate as characters,

regardless of type.

Sometimes, a creature has one or more bonus feats, indi-

cated by (B) following the name. It is not necessary for a

creature to meet the feats prerequisites in order to have and

use a bonus feat. If you wish to customize the creature with

new feats, you can replace its regular feats, but not its bonus

feats. The creature cannot have a regular feat unless it meets

all the feats prerequisites.

many combat-ready adults are in each type of group. Many

groups also have a number of noncombatants, expressed as

a percentage of the fighting population. Noncombatants

can include young, the infirm, slaves, or other individuals

who are not inclined to fight.

CHALLENGE RATING

The number on this line of the statistics block repre-

sents the average level of a party of adventurers

for which one creature would make an

encounter of moderate difficulty. Assume

a party of four fresh characters (full hit

points, full spells, and equipment

appropriate to their levels).

Given reasonable luck, the

party should be able to

win the encounter with

some damage but no casual-

ties. For more information about

Challenge  Ratings,  see  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide.

TREASURE

This entry tells how much wealth the creature owns and

relates to the treasure tables in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

In most cases, a creature keeps valuables in its home or lair

and has no treasure with it when it travels. Intelligent crea-

tures that own useful, portable treasure (such as magic

items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at

home. For more details, see the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide and

the Monster Manual.

ALIGNMENT

CLIMATE/TERRAIN

This entry describes the locales where the creature is most

often found.

This entry gives the alignment that the creature is most

likely to have. Every entry includes a qualifier that indicates

how broadly that alignment applies to the species as a whole.

Always: The creature is born with the indicated align-

ment. The creature may have a hereditary predisposition to

the alignment or come from a plane that predetermines it. It

is possible for individuals to change alignment, but such

individuals are either unique or one-in-a-million exceptions.

Usually: More than 50% of these creatures have the

indicated alignment. This may be due to strong cultural

example, most elves inherited their chaotic good alignment

from their creator, the deity Corellon Larethian.

Often: The creature tends toward the indicated align-

ment, either by nature or nurture, but not strongly. A plu-

rality (40% to 50%) of individuals have the indicated

alignment, but exceptions are common.

ADVANCEMENT

This book describes only the weakest and most common

version of each creature. The Advancement line shows

how tough a creature can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice.

(This  is  not  an  absolute  limit,  but  exceptions  are

extremely rare.)

LEVEL ADJUSTMENT

Creatures suitable for use as player characters (usually

creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 3 and oppos-

able thumbs) include this entry as the last line of the sta-

tistics block. Add this number to the creatures total hit

lent Character Level (ECL). A characters ECL affects the

experience the character earns, the amount of experience

the character must have before gaining a new level, and the

characters starting equipment. See the Dungeon Masters

CREATURE FEATS

Some  of  the  creatures  in  this  book  possess  feats  that  are  not

mentioned  in  the  Players  Handbook.  These  creature  feats  are

described below.

FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]

The creature can attack on the wing.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: When flying, the creature can take a move action (including

a  dive)  and  another  single  action  at  any  point  during  the  move.  The

creature  cannot  take  a  second  move  action  during  a  round  when  it

makes a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, the creature takes a single action either

before or after its move.

HOVER [GENERAL]

The creature can halt its forward motion while flying, regardless of its

maneuverability.

Prerequisite: Fly speed.

Benefit: While hovering, the creature can attack with all its natural

weapons, except for wing attacks. Some creatures may be able to make

additional attacks while hovering, as noted in the creatures descriptive

text. If the creature has a breath weapon, it can use the breath weapon

instead of making physical attacks.

If a creature hovers close to the ground in an area with lots of loose

debris, the draft from its wings creates a hemispherical cloud with a

radius specified in the creatures descriptive text. The winds so gener-

ated can snuff torches, small campfires, exposed lanterns, and other

small, open flames of nonmagical origin. The cloud obscures vision,

and creatures caught within it are blinded while inside and for 1 round

after emerging. Each creature caught in the cloud must succeed on a

Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 creatures HD) to cast a spell.

Normal: A creature without this feat cannot halt its forward motion

without  falling.  A  creature  with  average,  poor,  or  clumsy  maneuver-

ability can slow its flying movement to only half of its fly speed. (See

Tactical Aerial Movement in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.)

MULTIATTACK [GENERAL]

The creature is adept at using all its natural weapons at once.

Prerequisite: Three or more natural weapons.

Benefit: The creatures secondary attacks with natural weapons have

only a 2 penalty.

Normal: Without this feat, the creatures secondary natural attacks

have a 5 penalty.

MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING [GENERAL]

A creature with three or more hands can fight with a weapon in each

hand.  The  creature  can  make  one  extra  attack  each  round  with  each

extra weapon.

Prerequisite: Dex 13, three or more hands.

Benefit: Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by

2 with the primary hand and reduced by 6 with off hands.

Normal: A creature without this feat takes a 6 penalty on attacks

made with its primary hand and a 10 penalty on attacks made with its

off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.)

See Two-Weapon Fighting in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook.

Special: This  feat  replaces  the  Two-Weapon  Fighting  feat  for  crea-

tures with more than two arms.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

The creature can employ a spell-like ability with a moments thought.

Benefit: Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that does

not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another

actionincluding  the  use  of  another  spell-like  abilityin  the  same

round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use

only one quickened spell-like ability per round. A spell-like ability that

duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot

be quickened.

Each  of  a  creatures  spell-like  abilities  can  be  quickened  only

once per day. Thus, if a demon chooses to quicken its darkness abil-

ity, it cannot use quickened darkness again the same day, though it

could  use  its  darkness ability  again  normally  (since  darkness  is  an

at-will ability), or it could quicken another of its spell-like abilities,

such as desecrate.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires a standard

action and provokes an attack of opportunity unless noted otherwise.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken,

the creature can apply it to each of its spell-like abilities one additional

time per day.

The abrian is a human-sized

flightless birdlike creature

found in desolate reaches

of the Outer Planes, par-

ticularly the Abyss. Abri-

ans travel in large flocks

and are far more intelli-

gent than they look. Abrian

flocks sometimes engage in

trade with nomads and travel-

ing merchants.

An abrian looks vaguely like an

ostrich, except that its black and red feathers

are short and spiny. In place of wings, it has a pair of

scaly, atrophied humanoid arms (use 1/2 its Strength

score to determine an abrians carrying capacity). Its beak

is hooked and razor-sharp.

Abrians speak Abyssal.

COMBAT

Abrians fight together in hunting

flocks. Typically, the members of

a flock spread out to surround

a target and then dart up in

pairs to flank the target.

Abrian

Augmented Critical (Ex): An abrians beak threatens a

critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920. On a successful

critical hit with a beak attack, it deals triple damage.

Shriek (Su): The shriek of a lone abrian is supernaturally

loud and distressing. An abrian can shriek as a standard

action. Anyone within 20 feet of a shrieking abrian must

make a Fortitude save (DC 12) or be dazed for 1 round. If at

least four abrians are shrieking within 20 feet of a target, the

target is also deafened for 1d6 minutes if it fails the save. If

eight or more abrians are shrieking within 20 feet of a

target, the target takes 1d10 points of sonic damage as well

if it fails the save. An abrian is immune to its own shriek, as

well as the shrieks of other abrians.

Skills: Abrians have a +4 racial bonus on Spot checks.

Abyssal ghouls are twisted undead creatures with fiendish

characteristics. Their abyssal connections make them far

more formidable opponents than common ghouls.

An abyssal ghoul looks similar to a common ghoul in that

it is a warped humanoid figure with bestial features. Its skin

is scaly and tough, and its fingers and toes end in fearsome

claws several inches in length. Its teeth are equally fear-

some, and a foot-long tongue dangles from its mouth, trail-

ing into smoky incorporeality at its tip. Though an abyssal

ghoul is blind, its other senses allow it to perceive prey

around it.

Abyssal ghouls speak Abyssal.

COMBAT

An abyssal ghoul enters combat slashing with its

claws. Its strange tongue allows it to suck

mental energy from prey it has pinned.

Despite their apparent bestial nature,

abyssal ghouls are quite intelligent,

and they show considerable cun-

ning  in  battle.  In  groups  they

always try to flank opponents

and take advantage of sneak at-

tack opportunities.

Disease (Ex): Any creature

hit by an abyssal ghouls front

claw or rear claws attack must

succeed  on  a  Fortitude  save

(DC  18)  or  contract  demon

fever. After an incubation period

of 1 day, the disease deals 1d6

points of Constitution damage.

Each day after contracting demon

fever, the creature must succeed on

another Fortitude save (DC 18) or take

the same damage. Each time it is dam-

aged by the disease, the creature must

immediately succeed on another Fortitude save (DC 18)

or 1 point of the Constitution damage taken becomes

Constitution drain instead. After making a successful For-

titude save against the Constitution damage on each of

two consecutive days, the creature recovers.

Abyssal ghoul

Improved Grab (Ex): If an abyssal ghoul hits an oppo-

nent its own size or smaller with both front claws, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +15). If it gets a hold, it can attempt to pin

and use its Wisdom drain ability on its next grapple

check. Alternatively, the abyssal ghoul has the option to

conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its front

claws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the ghoul is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals damage from both

front claws.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime an abyssal ghouls target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by an

abyssal ghoul, the ghoul deals an additional 5d6 points of

damage on a successful melee attack.

Wisdom Drain (Su): If an abyssal ghoul successfully

pins a living opponent, it can drain 1d6 points of Wisdom

with its smoky tongue on the same action. Each round

thereafter that the pin is maintained, the ghoul automati-

cally drains an additional 1d6 points of Wisdom. A creature

reduced to 0 Wisdom by an abyssal ghoul becomes uncon-

scious until at least 1 point of Wisdom is restored.

Blindsight (Ex): An abyssal ghoul is blind, but it

maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature by

using scent and vibration to ascertain its surroundings.

This ability enables it to discern objects and creatures

within 90 feet. An abyssal ghoul usually does

not need to make Spot or Listen checks to

notice  creatures  within  range  of  its

blindsight.

Deathwatch (Sp): This ability func-

tions  like  the  deathwatch spell,

except that it is always active and

an abyssal ghoul always knows

how near death all creatures with-

in 90 feet of it are. Because of

this knowledge, it often pauses

to  kill  creatures  near  death

(those with 3 or fewer hit points

remaining) before moving on to

attack healthier foes.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): An abyssal

ghoul retains its Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class even when flat-footed or

struck by an invisible attacker. In addition,

it cannot be flanked except by a rogue of 20th

SF

level or higher.

Undead Traits: An abyssal ghoul is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. An abyssal ghoul cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. An abyssal ghoul

has darkvision (60-foot range).

An ahuizotl is a sinister

creature that lurks

underwater  and

snatches its vic-

tims from hiding

so that it can feast

on its favorite body

parts: eyes, teeth,

and  fingernails.

Although fairly large,

an ahuizotl is quite squat and can lurk in

water as shallow as 3 feet deep. The creature resembles a

monkey in form, but it has a head and hind legs similar to

a dogs. It keeps its body flat and low to the ground while

on land. The most unusual feature of this creature is its long,

prehensile tail, which is tipped with a muscular hand.

An ahuizotl can speak Common.

COMBAT

An ahuizotl prefers to lurk in the shallows of its lake among

the plants, keeping the tip of its snout above water so it can

entice victims with cries for help. If a victim comes near

enough, the ahuizotl quickly snatches the victim with its tail

hand and retreats to the depths of the lake to feed. Ahuizotls

also use the same tactics on people in boats.

Blinding Strike (Ex): If an ahuizotl scores a successful

critical hit with its tail hand or its bite, the victim becomes

blinded permanently.

Drowning (Ex): If an ahuizotl pins a grappled victim

while in water of any depth, the ahuizotl holds its victim

underwater. The victim can hold its breath for a number of

rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. When this time

limit is reached, it must make a Constitution check (DC 10)

each round to continue holding its breath; each round the

DC increases by 1. When the victim fails one of these Con-

stitution checks, it begins to drown. In the first round, it

falls unconscious (0 hp). In the following round, it drops to

1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, it drowns.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an ahuizotl hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with its

tail hand attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity  (grapple  bonus  +14).  It  can  immediately

attempt to drown its victim if it is in water. Thereafter, the

ahuizotl has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

it can simply use its tail hand to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the ahuizotl is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds automatically deals tail

hand damage.

Voice Mimicry (Su): An ahuizotl can mimic spoken

voices with unnatural ease. With a successful Bluff check, it

can mimic a specific persons voice perfectly.

Ahuizotl

Skills: Ahuizotls have a +8

racial  bonus  on  any  Swim

check to perform some spe-

cial action or avoid a hazard

and can always choose to

take 10 on Swim checks,

even if distracted or

endangered.

AOA

Born from the friction at rare instances when the Positive

energy Plane and the Negative Energy Plane graze each

other, aoa are curious creatures that are attracted to magic

auras  and  spellcasting.  They  naturally  reflect  most

attacks, and are dangerous to spellcasters. It is theorized

that they might be a neutral counterpart to the ener-

gons, xag-yas and xeg-yisreflecting energy while they

produce it.

Aoa are found floating around the Astral Plane and Ethe-

real Plane, seeking out large amounts of magic. They are

most common at the borders of two or more planes, where

the clashing of two magical energies create maelstroms.

Aoa resemble huge blobs of quicksilver that float above

the surface of whatever environment that are found in. Tiny

orbs that separate and reabsorb at random surround them.

The surface of an aoa is mirrorlike and reflects all light,

making it very easy to spot in daylight.

affected by dispel magic as if cast by a 15th level

wizard.

Reflective Spell Resistance (Sp): An aoa has a

special type of spell resistance that causes any

targeted spell it successfully resists to bounce

off and reflect back at the caster. The caster

becomes either the spells target or the point

of origin for the spells effect, as appropriate.

In addition, aoa are immune to gaze attacks,

and such an effect is reflected back to

its origin.

Outsider Traits: An aoa has

darkvision (60-foot range). It can-

not be raised or resurrected (though a wish or

miracle spell can restore life).

Resistances (Ex): An aoa has fire, cold, elec-

tricity, and sonic resistance 20.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic.

Caster level 15th; save DC 15 + spell level.

Skills: Aoa have a 6 racial bonus on Hide

checks.

Droplets are smaller and weaker aoa that are created when

a full-sized sphere reflects a large amount of magical

energy. Droplets look like aoa spheres (see below), but are

much smaller.

Once they are created, droplets will stay around long

enough to finish combat (and gather magical energy),

A

15

Aoa move slowly, bobbing lazy in the air. They become

agitated and excited when they sense magic. Once they

sense magic being cast, aoa will fly about crazily, trying to

get in the way of magical blasts and touch magic items.

They would be considered little more than annoying

pests, if it was not for their erratic behavior and danger

toward magic items.

Aoa can be summoned and are often used as guardians,

appeased by low amounts of magic that keeps them content.

Aoa do not speak and do not seem to understand any

languages.

COMBAT

Aoa are always attracted to the character or creature in a

group that radiates the most magic. To determine which

character or creature that is, add up the following numbers:

total number of magic items on the individual, total number

of bonuses each item provides, and total number of active

spells on each individual.

An aoa will immediately try to slam into the target indi-

vidual, discharging its dispelling touch ability, then feeding

off the energy that it creates. The aoa tries to get in the way

of any active spellcasting and is drawn toward spellcasters

that cast targeted spells.

Dispelling Touch (Sp): If an aoa successfully damages an

opponent  with  its  slam  attack,  the  opponent  is  also

before taking off on their own. Over time, a droplet grows to

become a full-sized sphere.

Combat

An aoa droplet relies heavily on its reflective spell resistance

and uses its dispelling touch frequently in combat.

Droplets can be summoned using a summon monster IV

spell.

Dispelling Touch (Sp): If a droplet successfully damages an

opponent with its slam attack, the opponent is also affected

by dispel magic as if cast by a 7th-level wizard.

AQUATIC OOZE

Although the various aquatic oozes normally live in the

waters of the ocean, they can also lurk in deep, dank under-

ground areas with stagnant pools of water. They are mind-

less, generally content to float with the current and eat

whatever happens to pass within striking distance.

COMBAT

Aquatic oozes attack any creatures they encounter with little

regard to their own safety.

Blindsight (Ex): An ooze is blind, but blindsight allows

it to maneuver and fight as well as a sighted creature.

Through this ability, it can discern objects and creatures

within 60 feet. An ooze usually does not need to make

Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight.

Ooze Traits: Aquatic oozes are immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

They are not subject to critical hits or flanking.

Skills: Aquatic oozes have a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard and can always take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered.

If an aoa sphere is struck by any physical attack, it will

release its reflective pulse and attack the offender.

Reflective Pulse (Sp): Three times per day, an aoa can release

a pulse that reflects magical energy back onto itself, creating

harmonics that can destroy magical auras and shatter magic

items. This effect is similar to a greater dispelling spell as if

cast by a 15th-level wizard. Magic items that have all their

abilities dispelled in this way are destroyed.

Split (Ex): If an aoa sphere reflects 50 points or more of

damage through targeted spells in a single attack, it splits off

a small blob of matter, creating a new, smaller aoa called a

droplet (described above).

Special Qualities: Amphibious, blindsight 60 ft., ooze

Saves: Fort +5, Ref +0, Will 5

Combat

A  bloodbloater  swarm  simply

swims  around  or  slithers

over its target and begins

to drain blood at a shock-

ing rate. Bloodbloaters

have no  concept  of

satiation; upon be-

coming engorged

on blood (and turn-

ing milky red in

color), they con-

tinue  to  feed

as excess blood

is forced out of

their bodies and

into  the  sur-

rounding water.

Blood Drain

(Ex):  On  each

round  that  a

b l o o d b l o a t e r

swarm deals at least

1 point of damage

to  a  victim,  it  also

drains blood and causes 1

point of Strength damage.

Distraction (Ex): Any nonmindless creature vulnerable

to the swarms damage that begins its turn with a swarm in

its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10)

negates the effect. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells

within the area of a bloodbloater swarm requires a Con-

centration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills involv-

ing patience and concentration requires a Concentration

check (DC 20).

Swarm Traits (Ex): Not subject to critical hits or flank-

ing. Immune to mind-affecting spells. Immune to damage

from all weapons. Immune to single-target spells. Vulnera-

ble to area effects. Does not threaten nearby squares.

A flotsam ooze is a

transparent mass of

sticky protoplasm that

quickly becomes encrusted

with bits of floating debris and possible

treasure. Over the course of several days, it

Bloodbloater

slowly digests any organic matter stuck to it.

Combat

A flotsam ooze floats unseen at the heart of its mass of debris

and strikes with sudden ease.

Adhesive (Ex): A flotsam ooze exudes a sticky slime that

holds fast any creature or item touching it. It automatically

grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents

so grappled cannot get free while the ooze is alive. The ooze

makes one additional slam attack each round against any

creature stuck to it.

A weapon that strikes a flotsam ooze sticks fast unless the

wielder makes a Reflex save (DC 12). A successful Strength

check (DC 16) is needed to pry it off.

The adhesive can be weakened by soap or lye, but even in

such a case the ooze gets a +4 bonus on grapple checks (for a

total bonus of +7). The substance breaks down 5 rounds after

the ooze dies.

Transparent (Ex): A flotsam ooze is transparent in water,

and it gains the benefit of nine-tenths concealment (40%

miss chance) when it is in water.

Skills: A flotsam oozes transparency gives it a +8 racial

bonus on Hide checks.

points of damage each round that it is exposed to natural

sunlight. Spells that create sunlight (such as sunbeam and

sunburst) have the most devastating possible effect on reek-

murks, affecting them as if they were vampires.

Combat

Only sunlight can drive off a hungry reekmurk. Unfortu-

hungry.

Acid (Ex): A reekmurk secretes a potent acid that dis-

solves organic matter. Any hit by a tentacle deals 1d6 addi-

tional points of acid damage. If the object hit is wood, it

takes 30 points of damage per round. A wooden weapon that

strikes a reekmurk dissolves immediately unless it succeeds

on a Reflex save (DC 15).

Poison (Ex): A reekmurk delivers its poison (Fort DC 15

negates) each time it deals acid damage to a target. Initial

and secondary damage are the same (1d4 Dex).

Stench (Ex): The reekmurk gets its name from the

unbearable stench that surrounds it. This stink affects any

creature within 30 feet of the ooze that can smell. Affected

creatures must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) upon first

being exposed to a reekmurks stink or become nauseated

for 1d4 rounds.

tendrils out to the limits of its reach at all times. Any crea-

ture within reach of a reekmurk must make a Reflex save

Bacchae are entities infused with the spirit of a Bacchana-

lian revel. They are debauched creatures that roam the

planes, luring others into their frenzied dance. They are

erratic beings that can go from friendly revelers to danger-

ous combatants in a moment. Most bacchae look like nor-

mal humans, but with a feral gleam in their eye. Although

they are attractive beings, bacchae of human appearance are

typically dirty and disheveled. Others are satyrlike in

appearance. Their tunics and laurel crowns are stained with

dirt, wine, and blood. They carry large tankards of beer, jugs

of wine, and a variety of musical instruments.

Most people encounter bacchae out in the wilderness.

They never stay in one spot for long, descending upon a

location like the wind and leaving destruction and chaos in

their wake. From time to time, a band of bacchae shows up

in a civilized area, bringing revelry and discord. Common-

ers usually delight in the chance to let loose, but authority

figures fear and despise bacchae, seeing them as forces of

anarchy and revolution.

Anyone who revels with the bacchae risks becoming one

as well. Over the course of a long evening of dancing, drink-

ing, and carousing, the spirit of Dionysus may take over the

beguiled individual and transform him or her into a new

member of the band.

Bacchae speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Bacchae rarely attack strangers outright, first seeking to

lure newcomers with offers of wine and song. The revel-

ers do not hesitate to use charm person or emotion to magi-

cally compel revelry from anyone who does not wish to

join their debauchery. Only when people resist their

magical abilities or seek to interfere with the revel do the

bacchae turn ugly and fall on their hapless victims with

physical attacks.

Bacchae fight literally tooth and nail, tearing and gouging

their opponents with utter abandon. They disdain weapons

for their bare hands. Those that are not involved in melee

combat hurl rocks, tankards, bottles and other loose items

that happen to be nearby.

Bacchae can be summoned using a summon monster III

spell.

Debauch (Su): Bacchae try to draw strangers into their

perpetual revel, eventually converting them into bacchae

themselves. Anyone who joins a band of bacchae in their

debauchery, whether voluntarily or through the beguilement

of the bacchaes spell-like abilities, must make a Will save

(DC 10 + 1 per 3 bacchae engaged in the revel, to a maximum

DC of 20 for a band of 30 bacchae) or lose all track of time

and  start  carousing  alongside  the  bacchae.  A  victim

ensnared by the bacchaes debauchery will not willingly

leave the mob. At the next sunrise, the victim must make a

second Will save. If successful, the debauched character

recovers his or her senses and may leave if he so chooses,

although the bacchae are likely to begin the whole process

all over again. If the debauched character fails the save, the

character becomes a bacchae.

A transformed character abandons her previous lifestyle,

gains all the statistics and abilities of a bacchae, and fights

against former allies as part of her bacchae mob. The charac-

ter can be restored by heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish.

Immunity to Polymorph: Bacchae are immune to poly-

morphing.

Rage (Ex): Twice per day a bacchae can fly into a drunken

frenzy, raging like a barbarian. For 7 rounds, the bacchae

A bacchae can fly into a rage once per encounter. At the end

of the rage, the creature is fatigued (2 Str, 2 Dex, cant

charge or run) for the duration of the encounter.

Rend (Ex): If a bacchae hits with both claws, it latches

onto the opponents body and tears the flesh. This attack

automatically deals an additional 2d4+3 points of damage

(2d4+6 points if the bacchae is raging).

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daycharm person, Tashas

Outsider Traits: Bacchae  have  darkvision  (60-foot

range). They cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish

or miracle spell can restore life).

BACCHAE SOCIETY

Bacchae travel in groups and are never found singly. A bac-

chae band can see no purpose or need beyond its own rev-

elry. While bacchae are rarely cruel or malevolent, they can

be exceedingly careless of other peoples property and lives.

Bhut

Bacchae are on good terms with

all  sorts  of  fey,

such as dryads,

satyrs,  and

sprites. Cen-

taurs  and  hardier

elves (usually wild elves) are also

common  members  of  bacchae

revels. Most other beings are

considered  fair  game  for

the  bacchae  to  taunt,  chal-

lenge, drink with, or kill out-

right. Musicians, brewers, and

vintners are usually spared their

wrath, however.

Bacchae take a dim view of any

authority figure or group that tries

to  impose any sort of rules on their

debauched  lifestyle.  They  are  staunch

opponents of lawful beings of all kind and,

as a result, are hunted by such organiza-

tions wherever they go.

The  bhut  is  a  foul

undead creature that

lurks in remote areas and masquer-

ades  as  the  living  in  a  most  unusual

manner. A bhut spends much of its time

possessing a humanoid corpse. When

forced from its host, the ghostly

bhut is a terrifying sight that con-

sists of a humanoid head with red,

feral eyes, a mouth full of dagger-

like teeth, and a roiling, half-formed

body of sickening black smoke and

dank red mist.

A bhut comes into being when a

humanoid dies a sudden, violent

death  in  a  remote  region.  Bhuts

harbor a festering hatred of the living,

and they wander the wilderness prey-

ing on travelers and pilgrims.

A bhut speaks all languages it knew

in life.

The bacchaes revelry forms their sole, all-consuming activ-

ity. They simply dont give it up for any reason or cause.

Thus, they lack the ambition or discipline to pursue any

character class. In most campaigns, bacchae are unsuitable

as player characters.

JJ

COMBAT

A bhut avoids combat if it does not have a body, and

when it has a body it prefers to slay its enemies through sub-

terfuge and surprise. Nevertheless, a bhut is a terrible and

accomplished menace in combat.

T

U

H

B

20

Augmented Critical (Ex): An bhuts bite attack threat-

ens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920. On a suc-

cessful critical hit with a bite, the bhut deals triple damage.

Dreadful Appearance (Su): Anyone within 30 feet of a

bhut must make a Fortitude save (DC 19) or take 1d6 points

of Strength damage. A victim can be affected only once by a

specific bhuts dreadful appearance, but the effects of failing

to save against multiple bhuts are cumulative.

Poison (Su): A bhut delivers its poison (Fort DC 14

negates) with each successful bite attack. Initial and second-

ary damage are the same (2d6 Wis). Anyone reduced to 0

Wisdom by bhut poison lapses into a coma and dies in 1d4

hours unless the poison is neutralized. A humanoid creature

slain in this manner rises as a bhut with the next sunset.

Corpsetheft (Su): As a full-round action, a bhut can pos-

sess a dead humanoid body of any size. The body animates

immediately and is under the bhuts full control; treat it as a

zombie of the appropriate size with several exceptions: First

of all, the animated body retains the bhuts Intelligence,

Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as the bhuts align-

ment, base attack bonus, hit points, base saving throws, and

level and class (if any). Additionally, the animated body is

not limited to single actions. Also, the animated bodys bite

attack can deliver the bhuts poison, but the bite is not itself

a natural attack (4 penalty on attack rolls). It deals only 1d3

points of damage, and it provokes an attack of opportunity.

As long as the bhut inhabits the body, it is not affected by

its earth vulnerability, nor does it gain the benefits of its aug-

mented critical or dreadful appearance abilities. Bhuts make

excellent use of their Bluff and Disguise skills in this state to

make the animated body appear to be alive. If the animated

body is reduced to 0 hit points, the bhut must exit the body

and return to its incorporeal form; any damage done to the ani-

mated body is not transferred to the bhuts incorporeal form.

Earth Vulnerability (Su): A bhut cannot abide contact

with earth or stone when in its incorporeal state, and it

cannot pass through such matter without taking 3d6 points

of damage per round. Stone and earth weapons deal an addi-

tional 1d6 points of damage when they strike an incorporeal

bhut, and they do not have a miss chance.

Incorporeal Subtype: A bhut can be harmed only by

other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The crea-

ture has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal

source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons. A bhut can pass through solid objects, but not

force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor,

and shields, but deflection bonuses and force effects work

cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Undead Traits: A bhut is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically affect

undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless

it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical hits, sub-

dual damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or

death from massive damage. A bhut cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. A bhut has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

A blackstone gigant is an enormous construct created by a

powerful cleric to be either a bodyguard or a guardian of

a sacred site. Possessed of a limited intelligence, a black-

stone gigant can serve as an assassin or retrieve an object

or creature.

Most blackstone gigants look like fierce, eight-armed

women. Evil creators sometimes carve blackstone gigants to

look like mariliths or other demonic creatures.

Blackstone gigants have the power to petrify foes, and

they often take grisly trophies from creatures defeated in

such a manner and craft them into a belt of petrified arms or

a necklace of petrified heads.

A blackstone gigant speaks the language

of its creator.

COMBAT

A blackstone gigant en-

ters  melee  fearlessly,

wading in among smaller

opponents  with

its

trample  ability  and

then flailing about it

with  its  many  arms,

hoping  to  petrify  as

many foes as it can. It

then animates any statues

it created and orders them to

attack. Should the animated

statues be too weak to aid in

the fight, the blackstone gigant

often destroys any foes it petri-

fies,  preventing  them  from

being returned to flesh

during the battle.

Petrification (Su): When-

ever  a  blackstone  gigant

damages an opponent with

a slam attack, that creature

must make a Fortitude save

(DC 26) or be turned into a

statue as per the spell flesh to stone

cast by a 20th-level caster.

Blackstone gigant

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a blackstone gigant

can trample opponents at least one size category smaller

than itself. This attack deals 8d8+25 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack

of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 43) for

half damage.

Animate Statue (Su): A blackstone gigant can use one or

more of its attacks to touch and animate any creatures it

turned to stone with its petrification power. This ability

works like an animate objects spell cast by a 20th-level caster,

except that the petrified creature can be of any size. The ani-

mated stone statue has the statistics of an animated object of

its size and composition, with a hardness of 8. Typical petri-

fied creatures have the improved speed ability (bonus of 10

feet for two legs or 20 feet for more legs). All such animated

objects are under the mental control of the blackstone

gigant or its creator (giving orders to a statue is a free action).

Such statues remain animated for 20 rounds. A blackstone

gigant cannot animate a petrified creature more than once,

and it often destroys statues after the duration of its animate

statue ability expires.

Construct Traits: A blackstone gigant is immune to

mind-affecting effects, and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any

effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on

objects. The creature is not subject to criti-

cal hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death

from massive damage.

It cannot heal itself but

can  be  healed  through

repair. It cannot be raised

or resurrected. A blackstone gigant

has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: Blackstone gigants have a

+8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take

10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

CONSTRUCTION

A blackstone gigants body is

carved  from  a  single  block  of

hard, black stone weighing at least

50,000 pounds.

A blackstone gigant costs 200,000

gp to create, which includes 5,000 gp

for the body. Assembling the body

requires a successful Craft (sculpting)

or Craft (stonemasonry) check (DC 25).

The creator must be 20th level and

be able to cast divine spells. Completing the

ritual drains 8,000 XP from the creator and

requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat, animate objects,

flesh to stone, geas/quest, and miracle.

Blood hawks are fierce, carnivorous predators. They pose a

danger to any creature that wanders into the territory they

claim as their own. They take joy in the hunt, and often a

murder of blood hawks attacks even if all its members have

fed well and recently.

A blood hawk measures about 3 feet from the tip of its

cruelly hooked beak to the end of its tail feathers, and an

adult has a wingspan of roughly 7 feet. Its feathers are a dull

gray color, and its eyes are the same bright red as the fresh

blood the creature craves.

Some experts believe that blood hawks are related to other

birds of prey. However, their hunger for fresh flesh and

blood is distinctly unlike more mundane aerial carnivores.

COMBAT

Blood hawks are nearly always encountered in

large groups of hunting adults,

although young adults are

sometimes  encoun-

tered alone if they

have  recently

left the murder

into which they

were born. They

attack almost anything living

until slain themselves; once

under the influence of blood

lust, a blood hawk does not

flee. The birds prefer the taste

of human flesh to all others

and tend to single out humans

if  confronted  with  a  racially

diverse group.

Wounding  (Ex): A  wound

resulting from a blood hawks

claw or bite attack bleeds for an

additional 1 point of damage per

round thereafter. Multiple wounds

from such attacks result in cumulative

bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of

damage per round, and so on). The bleeding

can be stopped only by a Heal check (DC 15) or

the application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal,

healing circle, or the like).

Skills: *Blood hawks have a +8 racial bonus on Spot

checks during daylight.

ADVANCEMENT FOR BLOOD HAWKS

Some blood hawks have an extremely strong desire to gain victory over

their  foes.  When  a  blood  hawk  advances  to  become  a  creature  with

more than 1 Hit Die, it gains the special quality called ferocity.

Ferocity  (Ex): A  blood  hawk  is  such  a  tenacious  combatant  that  it

continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying.

The bloodthorn is a tough,

thick, briarlike patches out

in the barren wastelands

of the Outlands, Carceri,

the  Abyss,  and  Pan-

demonium. The plant sub-

sists entirely on the blood of

living creatures by draining it

out  through  3-inch-long,  hollow,

needle-sharp spikes on its tendrils.

Bloodthorns appear as black, desiccated vines with

small-bladed leaves. Bright red, succulent berries grow

The berries produce a fragrant odor that appeals to most

species, especially in the deserts where bloodthorns grow. If

a creature survives a bloodthorns attack and steals away a

few berries, it discovers its efforts were in vainthe berries

On rare occasions, a bloodthorn is transplanted onto the

Blood Drain (Ex): If a bloodthorn grabs an opponent, it

begins draining blood. It deals 1d4 points of Constitution

damage with each successful grapple check. If the opponent

wins a grapple check, one of the bloodthorns tentacles

comes loose from the opponents body. The resulting wound

continues to lose blood for 1 additional round.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a bloodthorn hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with at

least two tendril attacks, it deals normal damage for each ten-

dril and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +11). If it

gets a hold, it can use its blood drain ability. Thereafter, the

bloodthorn has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use two tendrils to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the bloodthorn is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check

it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals ten-

Bonespears are patient predators that live on many different

planes. Named for the two long, wickedly barbed horns that

grow from their heads, they are a menace to any creature

they might perceive as fooda category that includes most

anything that moves. Their home plane is Acheron, but

bonespears have spread throughout the planes and can be

found in even the most inhospitable climates due to their

natural hardiness.

Bonespears resemble large grasshoppers in shape.

Their dark, carapaced bodies are 8 feet long, and they

stand nearly 5 feet tall at the shoulder. Their heads are

capped by a pair of 3-foot-long barbed horns. Only

when the creature begins to hunt does it become appar-

ent that the horns are not firmly attached to the crea-

tures headlong sinews connecting the head and the

horns enable the bonespear to launch its horns at prey

and reel them in to be consumed.

Bonespears can sit for days on end, waiting for suit-

able prey to wander by. They typically choose barren,

rocky places to conduct their hunts, and many bone-

COMBAT

When a bonespear spots food, it reacts quickly. As soon as a

target comes with 60 feet, the bonespear launches both

horns at it and then attempts to reel it in by retract-

ing the tough sinews that connect the horns to the

creatures head.

secondary damage for the first horn is 2d4 Dex. Initial

and secondary damage for the second horn is 2d4 Str.

Fast Healing (Ex): A bonespear regains lost hit

points at the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing

does not restore hit points lost from starva-

tion, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not

allow a bonespear to regrow or reattach lost

body parts.

Attach  (Ex): If  a

bonespear  hits  with  a

horn attack, the horn buries

itself in its target, held in

place by numerous barbs

on  the  horns  surface.  Each

round thereafter that a creature

remains impaled by a horn, it

takes additional horn damage

automatically and incurs a cumu-

lative 1 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saves, and skill checks. On

the bonespears turn in subse-

quent rounds, it attempts to drag its

prey closer (see below).

A  single  attack  with  a  slashing

weapon against a tendon (made as an attempt to sunder a

weapon) that deals at least 15 points of damage severs a horn

from its tendon. A creature impaled by a severed horn takes

1d6 points of damage per round automatically until the horn

is removed. Removing a horn (a full-round action) deals 2d8

points of damage to the victim, but if the character removing

the horn makes a successful Heal check (DC 20), this damage

is reduced to 1d4 points.

Drag: After spearing a victim, a bonespear attempts to

drag the victim closer on the bonespears turn in each sub-

sequent round. This activity resembles the bull rush maneu-

ver, except that the bonespear drags its victim 10 feet closer

+1 foot for each point by which its Strength check exceeds

the victims. The bonespear gains a +4 bonus on its drag

check if it is set in its immobile stance. Against a Medium-

size victim, the bonespears Strength modifier is +10, or +14

if it is set in its stance.

A bonespear can draw in a creature from a distance of 10

feet or less and bite with a +4 bonus on its attack roll in the

same round.

Horns (Ex): Most encounters with a bonespear begin

when it fires its two horns. If a horn misses its intended

target, it is quickly reeled in. Reeling in a horn is a full-

round action. Each horn has a range of 60 feet (no range

increment). A bonespear will always try to hit a single target

with both horns, but is capable of attaching to two different

targets at the same time.

Poison (Ex): A bonespear delivers its poison (Fort DC

25 negates) with each successful horn attack. Initial and

Immobile Stance (Ex): At will, a bone-

spear can make itself virtually immo-

bile by anchoring itself to the sur-

rounding terrain with its six large,

strong feet. In this stance, the bone-

spear receives a +20 stability bo-

nus on opposed Strength checks

to resist a bull rush or to other-

wise be moved, and it cannot be

overrun. (This bonus overlaps

[does not stack] with the +4

stability bonus for having more

than two legs.) This ability can

be activated or deactivated as a

free action.

Bonespear

Vermin Traits: A bonespear

is immune to all mind-affecting

effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns and morale effects). It also has darkvision

(60-foot range).

CANOMORPH

Those who dont understand the true nature of cano-

morphs often incorrectly identify them as fiendish

lycanthropes. The canomorph is not a true lycanthrope; it

is a fiendish hound (either a hell hound, vorr, or shadow

mastiff ) that has learned to assume humanoid form. Cre-

ated by devil and demon lords to serve as intelligent

trackers and guardians, canomorphs often journey to the

Material Plane to undertake diabolical missions for their

infernal masters.

An intense rivalry among the three subraces divides

canomorphs from each other. All three fill similar roles in

the Lower Planes, so there is intense competition for domi-

nance. The haraknins are the physically weakest of the

three, but they are also the most numerous and tenacious.

The shadurakuls are the strongest and most dangerous

canomorphs, but they are few in number. Between the two

are the shadowy vultivors, who are for now content to

remain in hiding and let their more aggressive kin tear at

each other.

COMBAT

Canomorphs have all the abilities and characteristics of

their hound form (hell hound for haraknins, shadow mastiff

for shadurakuls, or vorr for vultivors), plus class levels

25

learned in their humanoid form. Canomorphs can change

form at will from their hound form to a humanoid form

usually human, although other races are possible. They infil-

trate humanoid settlements in this guise, but often revert to

their natural forms to attack.

Change  Shape  (Su): A  canomorph  can  assume  the

form of any Small, Medium or Large humanoid. It retains

the extraordinary attacks of its original form regardless of its

new form. Changing shape to or from its original form

requires a move action.

Command Fiendish Hound (Sp): All canomorphs can use

greater command at will against fiendish hounds of their

associated kind (hell hounds for haraknins, shadow mas-

tiffs for shadurakuls, and vorrs for vultivors). These crea-

tures will never voluntarily attack a canomorph of the

associated kind.

Outsider Traits: Canomorphs have darkvision (60-foot

range), and they cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Scent (Ex): A canomorph can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

A haraknin can assume a variety of appearances with its

alternate form, but it strongly favors humans or half-orcs

with hair the color of flame, smoldering red eyes, and wiry

rust-colored hair all over its body. A faint smell of brimstone

clings to its humanoid form, and it tends to be ill-tempered

and violent.

Haraknins speak Common and Infernal.

Combat

The haraknin described here is based on an exceptional

2nd-level hell hound barbarian. The haraknin is an aggres-

sive combatant and favors sudden charges out of ambush

in either form. It prefers to hunt in its hell hound form in

order to cover ground faster, assuming its humanoid form

to close in when its prey seeks shelter in places where the

canomorphs hound form would not be welcomed.

Breath Weapon (Su): Cone of fire, 30 feet every 2d4

rounds, damage 1d4+1, Reflex half DC 14 (16 when raging).

within the cone. The creature can use its breath weapon

while biting and in either form.

Rage (Ex): Once per day this haraknin can fly into a

frenzy, raging like a barbarian. For 7 rounds, the haraknin

gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution,

and  a  +2  morale  bonus  on Will  saves,  but  takes  a  2

penalty to Armor Class. For the haraknin in humanoid

form, the following changes are in effect as long as the

rage lasts: HD 4d8+16 plus 2d12+8 (55 hp); AC 19, touch

terwork scimitar 1d8+6; SV Fort +8, Will +7; Str 20, Con

For the haraknin in hell hound form, the following

Attack/Grapple +6/+11; Full Attack bite +11 melee; Damage

bite 1d8+6; SV Fort +8, Will +7; Str 20, Con 19; Jump +12.

The creature is fatigued at the end of the rage (2 to

Strength, 2 to Dexterity, cant charge or run) for the dura-

tion of that encounter.

Fast Movement (Ex): A barbarian has a speed faster than

the norm for his race by +10 feet.

Haraknin

Fire  Subtype  (Ex): A  haraknin  is  immune  to  fire

damage. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as

normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is

allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): This haraknin retains its Dexter-

ity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed.

Skills: Haraknins have a +5 racial bonus on Hide and

Move Silently checks. They also have a +8 racial bonus on

Survival checks when tracking by scent, due to their keen

sense of smell.

Haraknin Characters

A haraknins favored classes are barbarian and ranger. A

haraknin character begins with 4 Hit Dice for being a hell

hound (refer to the Monster Manual for ability scores, feats,

and skills), and its level adjustment is +3. A haraknin PCs

effective character level (ECL) is equal to its class level +7.

Because canomorphs are exceptional examples of fiendish

hounds, the haraknin described above applies the hell

hounds ability score modifiers to the standard array of abil-

ity scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8).

In its humanoid form, a shadurakul often appears as a

barrel-chested human with inky, blue-black skin, no hair,

and cold white eyes. Contemptuous of the weak and

defenseless, a shadurakul rarely bothers to conceal its true

nature, counting on its strength and ruthlessness to over-

whelm its foes.

A shadurakul speaks Common, Infernal, and Abyssal.

Combat

The shadurakul described here is based on an exceptional

6th-level shadow mastiff fighter. A powerful and intimidat-

ing combatant, the shadurakul is a remorseless and deter-

mined tracker who prefers to wear down its prey with

relentless and unforgiving pursuit. Strong and skillful in

combat, the shadurakul uses its Spring Attack and Combat

Reflexes feats to excellent advantage, wielding a magic

spiked chain.

Bay (Su): When a shadurakul howls, all creatures except

evil outsiders in a 300-foot spread must succeed on a Will

save (DC 16) or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a

sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is suc-

cessful, an affected creature is immune to that shadurakuls

bay for one day.

Trip (Ex): A shadurakul that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without making

a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the

attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the shadu-

rakul. The shadurakul can only attempt to trip in this

manner while in its shadow mastiff form.

Shadow Blend (Su): During any conditions other than

full daylight, a shadurakul can disappear into the shadows,

giving it nine-tenths concealment (40% miss chance). Artifi-

cial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does

not negate this ability; however, a daylight spell will.

Skills: *A shadurakul has a +4 racial bonus on Survival

checks when tracking by scent.

Shadurakul Characters

A shadurakuls favored class is fighter. A shadurakul charac-

ter begins with 4 Hit Dice for being a shadow mastiff (refer

to the Monster Manual for ability scores, feats, and skills), and

its level adjustment is +4. A shadurakul PCs effective char-

acter level (ECL) is equal to its class level +8. Because

canomorphs  are  exceptional  examples  of  extraplanar

hounds, the shadurakul described above applies the shadow

mastiff s ability score modifiers to the standard array of abil-

ity scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8).

Like other canomorphs, a vultivor can appear as any

humanoid. Grayish skin, black and hungry eyes, and a

long, lupine face often mark its humanoid guises. It tends

to be cruel and subtle, taking great pleasure in the misfor-

tunes of others.

Trip (Ex): A vultivor that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without

making a touch attack or provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react

to trip the vultivor. The vultivor can only attempt to

trip in this manner while in its vorr form.

Shadow Form (Su): Once per day, a vul-

tivor can assume the form of a living shadow

for up to 10 minutes. While in shadow form, the

vultivor can move at normal speed on any sur-

face, including walls and ceilings, and even

across liquids. The vultivor gains

a +15 circumstance bonus on

Hide  checks.  Effects  that

detect thoughts, life, or pres-

ences (including true seeing)

can detect it.

While  in  shadow  form,  a

vultivor gains damage reduction

50/+5 and is immune to blind-

ness, critical hits, damage to

ability scores from non-

magical attacks, deaf-

ness, disease, drowning,

poison, and stunning. It takes

half damage from fire and acid.

Shadow Jump (Su): As a standard

action, a vultivor can travel between shad-

ows as if by a dimension door spell. The starting

and ending points of the jump must be in shadow,

and these points must be at least 10 feet apart. A vultivor

can make several shadow jumps in one day, as long as the

total distance traveled in this fashion per day does not

exceed 160 feet.

Trap Sense (Ex): A vultivor rogue gains a +1 bonus on

Reflex saves made to avoid traps, and a +1 dodge bonus to

Armor Class against attacks by traps.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): This vultivor retains its Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or struck by an

invisible attacker.

checks when tracking by scent.

Combat

Vultivor Characters

The vultivor described here is based on an exceptional 5th-

level vorr rogue. Vultivors are stealthy and patient murder-

ers, stalking their victims until they see an opportunity to

make a sneak attack. A vultivor often shifts to its vorr form

to speed its escape from the scene of a crime.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex): Anytime  a  vultivors  target  is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a

vultivor, the vultivor deals an additional 5d6 points of

damage on a successful melee attack.

A vultivors favored class is rogue. A vultivor character

begins with 3 Hit Dice for being a vorr (refer to the vorr

entry in this book for ability scores, feats, and skills), and

its level adjustment is +4. A vultivor PCs effective charac-

ter level (ECL) is equal to its class level + 7. Because

canomorphs are exceptional examples of fiendish hounds,

the vultivor described above applies the vorrs ability score

modifiers to the standard array of ability scores (15, 14, 13,

12, 10, 8).

A caryatid column looks like a simple

stone pillar until an unwary creature vio-

lates the strictures given to the construct

by its creator. In the blink of an eye,

the caryatid column becomes a silk-

draped, beautiful female figure that

wields  a  deadly  magic  weapon.

Caryatid columns are relentless

opponents, and they are surpris-

ingly agile despite their stone composi-

tion. They dance fearlessly into combat and

expect feeble weapons to shatter against their

Caryatid

column

30

marble skin. With martial skill uncommon in constructs,

they attack and break their foes weapons.

Caryatid columns are incapable of speech.

COMBAT

Caryatid columns are typically assigned to

guard a particular doorway or room against

intrusion. Sometimes these instruc-

tions are as simple as Kill anyone

but me who enters this room, but a

caryatid column can understand

more  complicated  instructions,

such as an order to Eject anyone

who does not perform the proper

ritual observances upon entering

this room.

Caryatid columns are often

placed so that they take fighting

form  when  a  target  is  within

reach, allowing the caryatid col-

umn  to  attack  with  surprise.

Upon taking its normal fighting

form, a caryatid column fights

tirelessly to fulfill the wording of

its command to the letter.

Break Weapon (Su): A caryatid

column is imbued with a super-

natural defense against weapon

attacks.  Whenever  a  creature

strikes a caryatid column with a

melee weapon, the weapon must

succeed on a Fortitude save (DC

13) or break and become useless,

dealing no damage to the caryatid

column. As usual, a magic weap-

on uses either the wielders save

bonus or its own save bonus, which-

ever is better.

Nonmagic ranged weapons auto-

matically shatter upon hitting the cary-

atid column, dealing no damage. Magic ranged

weapons receive a Fortitude save (DC 13) to resist

this effect.

Column Form (Ex): When at rest (not com-

manded, or waiting to fulfill a command), a caryatid

column takes the form of a simple column of

stone. This column is about 2 feet in diam-

eter, and it extends up to the ceiling of the

chamber or to a height of 25 feet, whichever

is less. Unless commanded otherwise, a cary-

atid  column  remains  in  this  form  until

attacked, and it even allows creatures to climb

it (Climb check DC 15).

A caryatid column in column form looks like a pillar in

most respects. It does not radiate magic, and true seeing

does not reveal its humanoid form. Careful examination

of the column (Search check DC 25) reveals very faint and

distorted lines that make the pillar resemble a woman

with a sword. Anyone who successfully makes a Knowl-

edge (architecture and engineering) check (DC 12) notes

that the column serves no structural purpose since it

bears none of the ceilings weight. A close examination of

the top of the column (Search check DC 15) or a keen eye

(Spot check DC 20) shows that the column is not cemented

or joined to the ceiling. Dwarves and other creatures with

stonecunning receive a free Search check as though

actively looking when they pass within 10 feet of a cary-

atid column.

Special Qualities: Acid resistance 20, tremorsense 120 ft.,

Construct Traits: A caryatid column is immune to mind-

affecting effects, and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, dis-

ease, death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The

creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, abil-

ity damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A caryatid column

has darkvision (60-foot range).

Hardness (Ex): Like an animated object made of stone, a

caryatid column has a hardness of 8.

Magic Weapon: A magic weapon is incorporated into a

caryatid column at the time of its creation. This weapon,

usually a +2 bastard sword, functions in all respects like a

normal magic weapon of its type, with one exception:

Whenever it is out of the caryatid columns hands, it reverts

to stone and becomes a nonmagical sculpture. Should the

caryatid column then pick up the weapon, it regains its

normal form and magical qualities.

If a caryatid column needs both hands free, it can stow its

weapon by simply pressing it against its side; the weapon

then merges with the caryatid columns body and can be

retrieved by the caryatid column as any character would

draw a weapon.

CREATING A CARYATID COLUMN

Originally devised by clerics to serve as temple guardians,

caryatid columns have come to be created and used by many

spellcasters to guard all manner of places and objects.

A caryatid columns body is carved from a single block of

stone weighing at least 1,000 pounds. A caryatid column

costs 20,000 gp to create, not including the cost of the magic

weapon incorporated into it (8,335 gp for a +2 bastard sword).

Assembling the body requires a successful Craft (sculpting)

or Craft (stonemasonry) check (DC 15).

The creator must be 10th level and be able to cast arcane

or divine spells. Completing the ritual drains 800 XP from

the creator and requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat, lesser

geas, meld into stone, statue, and stone shape.

Some believe that nature is a chaotic, destructive force

that cares little for the concepts of morality or fair play.

Such devotees of wild destruction and entropy often

point to the dreaded century worm as evidence of their

philosophy and single out the repulsive, voracious crea-

ture as the living embodiment of the uncaring wrath of

the natural world.

A century worm is composed of seven translucent seg-

ments of pulpy flesh topped by a menacing head partially

covered by a hood of rough, dark brown skin. Its round,

tooth-lined mouth easily accommodates an ogre. Hundreds

of squirming larvae about the size of a humans arm line the

worms stomach, which doubles as a womb. These little crea-

tures sometimes spill out of the worms mouth, though they

die within an hour for want of their parents life-giving

nutrient bile.

Century worm larvae are far from harmless to creatures

that find themselves trapped within the parent. Once the

litter has sapped the life out of a victim, one larva takes up

residence in the victims body, where it gestates for a period

of 100 years.

COMBAT

From the moment of its birth, a century worm exists only to

destroy. It mindlessly attempts to swallow any living crea-

ture it encounters by lunging in with a forceful attack and

finishing off enemies with a satisfying gulp.

check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the

stomach and return to the century worms maw,

where  another  successful  grapple  check  is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed

creature can try to cut its way out with either

claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon.

Dealing a total of at least 40 points of damage

to the stomach (AC 22) in this way

creates an opening large enough to

permit escape. Once a single swal-

lowed  creature  exits,  muscular

action closes the hole; thus, another

swallowed  opponent  must  cut  its

own way out. A century worms

maw can hold 2 Large, 8 Medium-

size,  32  Small,  or  128  Tiny  or

smaller opponents.

Wriggling Progeny (Ex): Charac-

ters trapped within a century worms

stomach  must  make  a  successful

Fortitude save (DC 38) every

round or take 1d8 points of

Constitution damage as cen-

tury  worm  larvae  burrow

through the victims skin

and make their way toward its heart.

A successful save staves off Constitution damage

for that round only.

When a victims Constitution reaches 0, the victim dies

and a single century worm larva digs into its flesh and

attaches  itself  to  the  corpses  spine. The  larva  can  be

destroyed by a remove disease spell. If it is not destroyed, a

new century worm begins to grow inside the body. This

larval form begins as a Tiny creature with 20 hit points and

grows one size category every 20 years (gaining another 80

hit points for every size change). When its size is the same as

the size of its host body, the worm bursts forth from within

the body. It continues to feed on the remains of the body

until,  after  100  years,  it  reaches  Gargantuan  size  and

becomes a fully formed century worm.

Bodies currently serving as incubators for century worm

larvae cannot be returned to life by any means.

Tremorsense (Ex): A century worm can automatically

sense the location of anything within 120 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

Vermin Traits: A century worm is immune to all

mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-

foot range).

Skills: A century worm has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard and can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks,

even if distracted or endangered.

Improved Grab

(Ex): If a century worm

hits an opponent that is at least one size category smaller

than itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +54). If it gets a

hold, it automatically deals bite damage and can attempt to

swallow the foe. Thereafter, the century worm has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

bite to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the century worm is not considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple check it makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals bite damage.

Keening (Ex): Once per round as a free action, a cen-

tury worm can emit a terrible keening sound. All living

creatures within 50 feet of the worm must make success-

ful Fortitude saves (DC 38) to avoid being deafened by

the sound.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A century worm can swallow a

single creature that is at least one size category smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +54), provided it already has that opponent in its

maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the century

worm, the opponent takes 2d6+9 points of acid damage

per round from the worms stomach. A successful grapple

Chronotyryns believe them-

selves to be the masters of

time. Although this claim

is likely not true, those who

encounter the creatures and

survive often come away believ-

ers due to the bird-creatures

unique set of abilities.

A  chronotyryn  resembles  a

large bird and is roughly 12 feet

long from beak to tail, with a set of

wiry,  scaly-skinned  arms  that

sprout from just under its wings.

Those who have seen a chrono-

tyryn liken its body shape to that of a

gargoyle,  only  with  feathers.  These

feathers are the dark, dusky color of adamantine, of which

they are composed. A chronotyryn has piercing, dark eyes

and the large, hooked beak of a bird of prey, and it typically

wears a sort of harness that enables it to carry miscella-

neous  magic  equipment  that  it  has  constructed. The

chronotyryns dual brain and dual voice boxes make it

especially eerie: Its two voices often carry on simultaneous

conversations, and at other times, it seems to provide an

echo for its own voice.

Chronotyryns are believed to be native to Acheron,

although the creatures have scattered across the planes of

existence. Hoarders of knowledge, most chronotyryns do

not willingly share any information. Their nests are built in

secret, out-of-the-way places, and they usually consist of a

jumble  of  magic  paraphernalia  the  creatures  have  ac-

cumulated from their victims.

Chronotyryns speak Abyssal, Infernal, Celestial, Dra-

conic,  and  three  additional  languages  (often  Under-

common, Giant, and Orc).

COMBAT

A chronotyryn is highly magical and capable of unleashing

tremendous forces on its foes. It is also quite arrogant. A

chronotyryn usually begins combat from a distance by

blasting at foes with its spells and perhaps a feather flurry.

If an opponent is particularly tough, it doesnt hesitate to

use its time stop ability to plant a multitude of devastating

spells and spell-like abilities on its opponent.

Dual Actions (Su): A chronotyryn has two distinct brains

and two separate voice boxes. It can take 2 rounds worth of

actions in any given round, as if it were two creatures. Thus, it

can use a full attack action and a double move; two full attack

actions and two

5-foot steps;

a full attack

action,

Chronotyryn

33

a move action, and a spell-like ability; two spell-like abilities

and two move actions; and so on. If it is casting spells defen-

sively, the chronotyryn must make separate Concentration

checks for each spell.

Feather Flurry (Ex): Three times per day, a chronotyryn

can launch a barrage of feathers at its opponents as a ranged

attack action. This attack has a maximum range of 60 feet

with no range increment.

Sonic Screech (Su): Once per day, a chronotyryn can

propel a 20-foot burst of incredible sound against its oppo-

nents. This attack deals 8d6 points of sonic damage, or half

damage on a successful Reflex save (DC 26). The burst is

centered on the chronotyryn.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblink,

feeblemind, teleport without error; 3/day

Adamantine  Feathers  (Ex): A

chronotyryns feathers are composed of an

adamantine alloy. This provides the creature with the ability

to damage foes with its feathers (see feather flurry, above).

Detect Magic (Su): A chronotyryn can produce a detect

magic effect (caster level 20th) at will.

Knowledgeable (Ex): A chronotyryn makes Knowledge

checks for any Knowledge skills as if it had a minimum of

10 ranks in that skill. To surpass the 10-rank minimum,

the chronotyryn must assign more than 10 ranks to the skill

as normal.

Skills: A chronotyryn has a +10 racial bonus on Spot

checks.

Chwidenchas  (commonly  called

spider  leg  horrors  by  surface

dwellers) are created when drow

fail one of the many tests set by

their deity Lolth, the Spider Queen.

Chwidenchas lurk in caverns deep

beneath  the  earth;  they  are  nearly

mindless beasts that search out prey

to strangle and devour.

Chwidencha

A  chwidencha  appears  to  be  a

writhing  mass  of  flexible,  hairy

spider legs. Each leg ends in a sharp tip,

and one side is covered in thornlike hair, which allows

the limb to rip through flesh and bone with ease. The

creature does have a central body buried deep under its

dozens of limbs, though the body is usually seen only

after the creature has been killed. A chwidencha moves

in a skittering undulation and can crawl up walls or

burrow through earth with ease.

Chwidenchas hunt down any living creature, but they

particularly despise drow, who have cast them out of soci-

ety just as the drow have done with driders. Some evil

races capture groups of chwidenchas and place them in

metal-lined pits, using them to dispose of waste, carcasses,

and the occasional prisoner or criminal.

Chwidenchas are very sensitive to sound and particularly

vulnerable to sonic attacks. They flee from loud, high-

pitched noises. They understand Undercommon, but they

do not speak it.

COMBAT

A chwidencha lurks in the darkness and uses its tremor-

sense to notify it of approaching prey. It usually hides

beneath a layer of earth, then crawls out and grapples an

opponent. It takes several hours for a chwidencha to devour

its victim, so it usually drags the body off to some safe place

to consume it.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a

chwidencha can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 3d6+9

points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a chwidencha hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with at

least two leg rake attacks, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +19). If it gets a

hold, it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the

chwidencha has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its legs to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the chwidencha is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals rake and constrict damage.

Leg Regeneration (Ex): Foes can attack a chwiden-

chas legs, but only when those appendages are actually

holding an opponent. A leg has an AC of 19 (touch 12)

and can withstand 20 points of damage. The loss of a leg

does not harm the creature (that is, the damage does not

apply against its hit point total), and the

chwidencha regrows the limb within

a day.

Tremorsense (Ex): A

chwidencha  can  auto-

matically sense the loca-

tion  of  anything

within 60 feet that

is in contact with

the ground.

The crawling head is a horrifying undead monstrosity

spawned from the severed head of a giant.

A crawling heads body is a huge,

bloated giants head that has grown

to  enormous  size.  Its  jaws  are

overdeveloped and filled with

multiple rows of sharklike

teeth. A seething nest of

animated intestines, ar-

teries, and veins spreads

out  from  the  heads

neck, allowing the crea-

ture to slither across any

surface  (even vertical

ones) with surprising

and  disturbing

grace. The crea-

tures  body  is

that it has swallowed, each one trapped in a sac just beneath

the surface of the creatures translucent skin.

An overconfident necromancer who was quickly slain by

his own creation created the original crawling head ages

ago. Since then, crawling heads have been slowly increasing

in number in areas frequented by giants and their ilk.

A crawling head can speak Common and Giant.

COMBAT

A crawling head uses its spells to soften up enemies before

wading in to finish the job with its vicious bite and its tenta-

cles. Most crawling heads take the time to establish intricate

lairs populated with magic traps and undead guardians.

Cacophony (Su): When a crawling head attacks, the heads

stored in its body screech, howl, and cry out in pain. If a

crawling head has at least ten stored heads, the horrendous

noise it makes strikes fear into nearby creatures. All creatures

within 60 feet of the crawling head must make a Will save

each round (DC 24) or cower in fear. Cowering creatures lose

their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) and can take

no actions. Foes gain a +2 bonus on their attack rolls to hit

cowering creatures. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a crawl-

ing head can crush a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d8+5

points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a crawling head hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with  a  tentacle  attack,  it  deals  normal  damage  and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +32). If it gets

a hold, it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the

crawling head has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its tentacles to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the crawling head is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals tentacle and constrict damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, control

undead, death knell, inflict serious wounds, fear, gentle repose,

shield, speak with dead; 3/daycreate undead, create greater

undead, finger of death, wail of the banshee. Caster level 20th;

save DC 17 + spell level. As a free action once per round, a

crawling head can quicken one of its spell-like abilities by

absorbing one of the heads it currently stores (see the

Quicken Spell-Like Ability feat in the introduction).

Vorpal Bite (Ex): On a successful critical hit, a crawling

heads bite attack severs the opponents head (if it has one)

from its body. Some creatures, such as golems and undead

other than vampires, are not affected by the loss of their

heads, but most creatures die when their heads are cut off.

Absorb Head (Su): As a free action, a crawling head can

swallow the head of a Large or smaller creature that it has

beheaded with its vorpal bite attack. On the following

round, the victims head becomes one of the heads stored in

the creatures body. A crawling head can store a number of

heads equal to its Hit Dice. It can absorb one of these heads

as a free action (maximum one head per round) to quicken a

spell-like ability, to heal itself as if it had been targeted with

a harm spell, or to grant itself a +6 enhancement bonus for 1

hour to one of its ability scores. A randomly encountered

crawling head has 1d4+10 heads stored.

True Seeing (Su): A crawling head can see as if under the

effect of a true seeing spell at all times.

Undead Traits: A crawling head is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. A crawling head cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. The creature has

darkvision (60-foot range).

Water Vulnerability (Ex): Water affects a crawling head

in the same manner that acid affects most creatures. Water

deals 1d6 points of damage to the creature per round of

exposure except in the case of total immersion (such as in a

deep pool of water), which deals 10d6 points of damage per

round. An attack with water, such as from a hurled vial or

the create water spell, counts as 1 round of exposure.

Skills: A crawling head has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

A crypt thing is a kind of undead guardian that is built to

watch over a particular site or object and deal with intruders

in a nonlethal manner.

The creature appears as nothing more unusual than a

skeletal figure in tattered robes. When active, its eyes glow

with a fierce red light. A crypt thing exists only to guard,

and it typically watches over a religious treasure, tomb, or

holy site. It normally waits in an alcove or on a chair pro-

vided for it. It speaks Common and is willing to converse

with those that do not threaten it while it tries to scare away

creatures it thinks are easily cowed.

A cleric of 14th level or higher can use the create undead

spell to create a crypt thing.

Turn Resistance (Ex): While within 50 feet of the loca-

tion or object it guards, a crypt thing is treated as an undead

with 4 more Hit Dice than it actually has for the purpose of

turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A crypt thing is immune to mind-affect-

ing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically affect

undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. A crypt thing cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. A crypt thing has

darkvision (60-foot range).

COMBAT

A crypt thing attacks only if assaulted or if it believes it can-

not drive away those that enter the place it guards. Its first

act is to use its scatter defilers ability, and then it attacks

with its claws until all its enemies are dead or fleeing. If

approached by creatures it has dispersed by its scatter

defilers ability, it attacks immediately.

Scatter Defilers (Su): Once per day a crypt thing can

target its enemies with a teleportation effect, which causes

them to be transported 10d1010 feet in a random direc-

tion (Will DC 14 negates). Targets that fail their saves arrive

safely in the closest open space to the destination (includ-

ing shifting up or down if necessary) if a solid body occu-

pies that location. This ability affects a number of enemies

equal to the crypt things Hit Dice, and all targets must be

within a 30-foot burst centered on the crypt thing. The

transported targets cannot

take any actions until

their next turn.

Crypt thing

DARK ONES

Dark ones are a mysterious race of beings that inhabit the

Underdark. Their only contact with other races occurs when

they defend their homes and steal trinkets from enemies

under the cover of darkness.

Dark ones despise illumination of all kind and attack

anyone that uses a torch, a lantern, or a spell that creates

light. Dark ones do not molest a party of characters traveling

without the use of artificial light sources, such as through

the use of darkvision.

Dark ones speak their own language and appear to under-

stand Undercommon, although they have never been heard

to speak it.

COMBAT

Dark ones are extremely stealthy, but cowardly. They prefer

to fight under the cover of complete darkness and flee

when the odds turn against them. They are masters

of ambush and often pick off individuals from

the shadows.

Shadow  Cloak  (Su):  Three

times per day, a dark one can wrap

itself in a cloak of shadows that

grants it concealment from its

foes. In shadows or darkness,

the shadow cloak gives the crea-

ture nine -tenths concealment

(40% miss chance for attackers).

In  bright  light,  the  shadow

cloak  provides  only  one -half

concealment (20% miss chance).

Darkvision does not negate the

dark ones concealment, since

the  shadow  cloak  is  formed

from magical darkness. Crea-

tures that can see in magical darkness,

such as devils, do not have a miss chance when

striking a dark one.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a dark ones target is denied

a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a dark

37

one, the dark one deals additional damage on a successful

melee attack. Dark creepers deal an additional 2d6 points of

damage, and dark stalkers deal an additional 3d6 points

of damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A dark one maneuvers and fights not

only by sight, but also by using

hearing and smell to ascertain its

surroundings. This ability enables

it to discern objects and creatures

within 60 feet. A dark one usually

does  not  need  to  make  Spot  or

Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): When

exposed to sunlight, or to light

equivalent to a daylight spell, a dark

one takes a 2 morale penalty on

all attacks, saves, checks, and dam-

age rolls.

Skills: When in shadowy areas, a

dark one has a +8 racial bonus on

Hide checks and a +4 racial bonus

on Move Silently checks.

Dark creepers are stunted human-

oids that lurk in the shadows and

blackness of the Underdark.

They are small and slightly built,

with pallid skin, large noses, and

sinister eyes beneath hairy brows.

Instead of feet, dark creepers have

small  black  hooves,  though  the

hooves are soft and do not make

noise  on  stone. They  wear  only

black and cover themselves com-

pletely with dark wraps, cloaks,

and turbans.

Combat

Dark  creepers  hide  in  shadows

before attacking the exposed flank

and rear of their opponent.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any

effect  that  normally  allows  a

Reflex save for half damage,

a  dark  creeper  takes  no

Dark stalkers are the enigmatic leaders of the dark ones,

although it is difficult to tell whether they actually belong to

the same race as dark creepers.

Dark stalkers appear human in almost every way, and they

stand head and shoulders above their dark creeper kin.

They have dusky skin and lack the hooves of dark creepers.

Dark stalkers cover themselves head to toe in black, somber

clothing and never willingly reveal their faces.

Combat

Dark stalkers lead dark creepers into battle, and they place

poison on their short swords to deal terrible wounds. They

use fog cloud to escape from powerful opponents.

Fog Cloud (Sp): Twice per day, a dark stalker can use fog

(Large)

cloud as the spell cast by a 5th-level sorcerer.

Poison Use (Ex): Dark stalkers never risk accidentally

poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.

They typically use shadow essence poison (Fort DC 17, ini-

tial damage 1 point of Strength drain, secondary damage

2d6 points of Strength damage) on both their swords and

their javelins. A dark stalker usually enters combat with its

blade and four javelins coated with poison.

Dark Stalker Characters

A dark stalkers favored class is rogue. A dark stalker PCs

effective character level (ECL) is equal to its class level + 5.

Thus, a 1st-level dark stalker rogue has an ECL of 6 and is

the equivalent of a 6th-level character.

Darkweavers are sinister and alien beings from the Plane

of Shadow that have found that the Material Plane offers

far more plentiful hunting grounds than their home. Rela-

tively new arrivals to the Material Plane, the darkweavers

seek to learn more about the Material Plane and the power

of the creatures that reside there so that they can make a

bid for control.

Few creatures that have seen a darkweaver truly under-

stand what it looks like. Every darkweaver resides in a

thicket of writhing, supernatural shadows, and a creature

must delve into the benighted depths of this darkness to

find it. At the center of this area, a curious explorer might

catch a glimpse of a spiderlike form that is wreathed in pro-

tective shifting darkness.

The true form of a darkweaver resembles a spider in only

in the vaguest fashion. Its fleshy, gray-skinned body is

divided into two segments, each with four tentacles. Clus-

ters of spiderlike eyes cover all sides of its front section,

and the underside contains a mouth with deadly fangs. A

darkweaver usually walks on all eight tentacles, but it can

rear its front section up and move about, which frees its

front tentacles to attack foes or manipulate objects.

Darkweavers speak Abyssal, Common, and Infernal.

another creature would have one-half concealment, and a

creature in the shadow strands 20 feet away would

have total concealment. A creature in the

shadow strands has no concealment from

creatures within 5 feet. Creatures with

darkvision suffer these effects, and the

shadow strands even baffle blindsight,

but true seeing allows a creature to see

normally through them.

Any creature that enters this area

can  freely  move  toward  the  dark-

weaver, but any attempt to move in any

other direction is resisted by the semi-

solid shadow strands. A creature attempt-

ing to move in such a fashion must

make a Strength check or an Escape

Artist  check;  the  creature  can

move away from the darkweaver 5

feet for each full 5 points by which

the check result exceeds 10. If a

creature is adjacent to the darkweaver

(within 5 feet), it can move freely so long

as it remains adjacent to the darkweaver. A

creature protected by a freedom of movement

spell is immune to the constraining effects of the

shadow strands.

The darkweaver can move about as it wishes and bring

the area of shadow strands with it. Creatures are not

affected by the darkweavers moving the strands, but the

direction toward the darkweaver will likely change.

Creatures within the strands do not need to guess in

which direction the darkweaver lies; it becomes immedi-

ately  obvious  when  they  try  to  move  away  and  the

shadow strands snarl and twist to block all other routes.

When a creature without freedom of movement attempts to

move against the strands, the darkweaver is immediately

aware of its location even if it cannot see the creature due

to invisibility.

Darkweavers are immune to other darkweavers shadow

strands and can see through them.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayconfusion, darkness, sugges-

tion, tongues, web; 1/dayshadow walk. Caster level 13th; save

DC 13 + spell level.

Strength Damage (Su): Any creature bitten by a dark-

weaver takes 2d4 points of Strength damage (or 4d4 points

on a critical hit). Darkweavers eat by sapping a victims

strength.

All-Around Vision (Ex): A darkweaver can see in all

directions at once. Because of this, it has a +4 racial bonus on

Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked.

Fast Healing (Ex): As long as it has at least 1 hit point, a

darkweaver regains lost hit points at the rate of 3 per round.

Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a darkweaver to

regrow or reattach lost body parts.

COMBAT

Darkweaver

A darkweaver relies heavily on its ability to

shroud the battlefield in a web of shadow. Capable of

seeing through the shadows it creates, a darkweaver

prefers to hide in the effect and lure prey in with sugges-

tion. If prey refuses to enter the shadow strands, a dark-

weaver relies on darkness and confusion to make the creature

hesitate while it moves the area of shadow strands over it.

When a creature is close to the center of the effect, the dark-

weaver rears up and lashes out with its front four tentacles,

hoping to ensnare the foe and sap its strength.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a darkweaver hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

tentacle rake attack, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +9). If it gets a hold, it

automatically hits with its bite, dealing 1d6+3 points of

damage and 2d4 points of Strength damage. Thereafter, the

darkweaver has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its tentacle to grapple the opponent

(20 penalty on grapple check, but the darkweaver is not

considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Shadow Strands (Su): At will, a darkweaver can create

an aura of weblike, supernatural, semisolid shadow that

emanates outward from it in a 60-foot spread. A dark-

weaver can see normally through the shadow strands, but

other creatures have great difficulty doing so. Each full 5

feet of shadow strands grants one-quarter concealment.

Thus, a creature in the shadow strands 10 feet away from

Shadow Jump (Su): A darkweaver can travel between

shadows as if by means of a dimension door. The limitation is

that the magical transport must begin and end in an area

with at least some shadow. The darkweaver can shadow

jump up to a total of 320 feet per day; this amount can be

split up among many jumps in 10-foot increments. Thus, a

darkweaver that shadow jumps 35 feet would use up 40 feet

of its shadow jump limit for the day.

A darkweaver in its shadow strands always has enough

shadow to jump from unless a light source as bright as a day-

light spell is brought within 5 feet of it.

Shadowstuff Armor (Su): A darkweaver is shrouded in

a semisolid armor of shadowstuff that grants it a +4 deflec-

tion bonus to Armor Class and a +10 circumstance bonus

on Hide checks (included in the statistics above). The

shadowstuff armor does not provide concealment, nor

does it provide the requisite shadows to make a shadow

jump. This armor disappears in an antimagic field, but it

returns as soon as the darkweaver is out of the field.

Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex): When exposed to sunlight

or to light equivalent to a daylight spell, a darkweaver takes a

2 morale penalty on all attacks, saves, checks, and damage

rolls. In addition, it does not regain hit points from its fast

healing ability.

A darkweavers shadow strands provide the creature

with total concealment from light that is outside the

shadow strands area. Any magical light source within

the shadow strands must be within 5 feet of the dark-

weaver  to  affect  it  because  of  the  concealment  the

shadow strands provide.

Tentacle Regeneration (Ex): Foes can attack a dark-

weavers tentacles, but only when those appendages are

actually holding an opponent. A tentacle has an AC of 27

(touch 19) and can withstand 20 points of damage. The loss

of a tentacle does not harm the creature

(that is, the damage does not apply

against its hit point total),

and it regrows

the limb

within

a day.

Skills: A darkweaver has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

Darkweaver Society

Darkweavers are loners by nature, but they often keep dan-

gerous predators as pets. When a darkweaver saps all of a

creatures strength (reducing its Strength score to 0 and ren-

dering it helpless), it often carries the creature away and

locates a large carnivore or a tribe of evil creatures willing to

eat its catch. The darkweaver then ensnares the predator in

its shadow strands, forcing the predator to move toward it.

When it comes close, the darkweaver drops its still-living

prey as a reward and steps back, allowing the creature to feed

on the weakened foe. The darkweaver repeats this activity

several times until the predator comes to rely on it for food

and views it as an ally. The darkweavers tongues and sugges-

tion abilities often help to cement this relationship. Dark-

weavers lairs are often guarded by such predators, and it

isnt unknown for a tribe of predatory creatures, such as

trolls, to come to worship a darkweaver and aid it as it pur-

sues its dreams of dominance over others.

Thought by some to be descendants of the mythical three-

headed dog Cerberus, death dogs certainly dont take well to

guard duty. The dogs recognize the disconcerting effect

their two heads have on would-be prey and use that fear to

their advantage. Nighttime or underground hunters, death

dogs are roughly the size of large wolves, covered in thick

black or dark gray fur that enables them to blend into the

dark. Death dogs are ruthless predators. Those who travel in

their territory learn to listen for the double bark that heralds

a packs approach.

COMBAT

Death dogs prefer to attack with overwhelming numbers.

They tend to pick a single opponent to harry, attempting to

trip that foe so the rest of the pack can leap in and finish the

fallen victim. Even when theyre not hungry, death dogs can

strike briefly to infect a victim with the disease they carry,

which is characterized by a yellowing of the victims skin

and swelling around the eyes and throat. The dogs then

withdraw  and  follow  from  a  distance  until  they  grow

hungry enough to finish the victim off.

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by a death dogs bite attack

must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 13) or contract a dis-

ease. The incubation period is 1 day, and the disease deals

1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d3 points of Constitu-

tion damage. (See Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide

for more about diseases.)

Trip (Ex): A death dog that hits with a bite attack can

attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without

making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportu-

nity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip

the death dog.

Scent (Ex): A death dog can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: Death dogs have a +4 racial bonus on Listen and

Spot checks.

DEMODAND

The prison plane of Carceri is home to many sorts of crea-

tures. Its petitioners plot endlessly to find an escape from

their hellish existence, but watchful eyes see to it that

such plots never succeed. The demodands are the self-

appointed keepers of the Carcerian population. They are the

jailers and wardens, although they themselves are mostly

prisoners of the plane as surely as the petitioners they try

to watch.

Of course, the number of petitioners on Carceri makes

the demodands task an impossible one, but this doesnt

trouble them. After their exile from some other plane

many millennia ago, for a reason long forgotten (although

the kelubars and shators both agree it was the fault of the

farastus), the demodands were exiled to the Tarterian

Depths  of Carceri to serve a penance. Once there, they

took it upon themselves to set up an order, of sorts. Other

subraces of demodands live on Carceri, and perhaps on

other planes as well, but the farastus, kelubars, and shators

are the most common.

The demodands dont restrict their activities exclusively

to Carceri. They are sometimes encountered on other planes

acting as bounty hunters in pursuit of those who have

escaped the Tarterian Depths. Such demodands still know

their fate is to return to Carceri.

COMBAT

Demodands dont seek trouble with visitors to Carceri. The

problem, however, is that they do not distinguish between

visitors and regular petitioners. If a creature is on Carceri,

the demodands think it belongs there, and thus they see

that keeping it there is their duty.

Summon Demodand (Sp): Demodands can summon others

of their kind as though casting a summon monster spell, but

they have only a limited chance of success. Roll d% and

compare the result to the die range given in the demodands

specific description: On a failure, no demodands answer

the summons. Summoned creatures remain for 1 hour,

then return to their home on Carceri. A demodand that is

itself summoned cannot use its own summon demodand

ability for 1 hour.

Demodand Traits

Freedom of Movement (Su): All demodands gain the

benefit of continuous freedom of movement, as the spell cast

by a 10th-level spellcaster.

Poison Immunity (Ex): All demodands are immune to

poison.

Outsider Traits: A demodand has darkvision (60-foot

range, or 120-foot range for shators). It cannot be raised

or resurrected.

The farastus are the most common type of demodand. They

draw the most menial tasks under orders from the kelubars

and shators. Blamed for their races long-forgotten trans-

gression, which resulted in their banishment to Carceri, the

farastus are barely tolerated by other demodands.

Farastus stand roughly 7 feet high and weigh about 220

pounds. They have long arms and legs, and large, oblong

heads. Their bodies continually ooze a thick, black, tarlike

substance that slowly trickles down the creatures emaci-

ated frames.

Farastus are arrogant and cruel when not around kelubars

or shators. As occupants of the lowest rung of demodand

society, they enjoy flexing their muscles with weaker crea-

tures they know they can push around.

Farastus speak the language of demodands and Abyssal.

Combat

Farastus enjoy it when a petitioner in their care tries to

escape because it allows them to vent

their copious frustrations on the unfortunate soul. They

typically fly into a rage in the first round of combat and

then try to disarm an opponent of any weapons before

wading in with their sharp claws and large, tooth-filled

mouths. If they manage to disarm an opponent of a power-

ful weapon, they dont hesitate to wield it themselves.

Farastus can be summoned using a summon monster IX

spell.

Adhesive Slime (Ex): The thick, tarlike slime that faras-

tus secrete acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast creatures

or items that touch it. Farastus have a +8 racial bonus on

grapple checks and disarm checks due to their adhesive

slime. A farastu frequently chooses to grapple its foes and

then maul its enemies with natural attacks.

A weapon that strikes a farastu is stuck fast unless the

wielder succeeds on a Reflex save (DC 17). Prying off a stuck

weapon requires a Strength check (DC 17).

Lantern  oil  or  some  other  flammable  oil  (such  as

alchemists fire) dissolves the farastus adhesive slime; the

creature requires 10 minutes to renew its adhesive coating

if doused with oil. A farastu can dissolve its adhesive slime

at will, and the substance breaks down 1 minute after the

creature dies.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a farastu hits an opponent with

a claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +23, or

+25 when raging,

including  the

bonus for adhesive slime). Farastu do not have any special

ability to damage grappled opponents other than their

natural attacks, but their adhesive slime makes them very

dangerous in a grapple.

Rage (Ex): Three times per day a farastu can fly into a

frenzy, raging like a barbarian. The farastu gains a +4

bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2

morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a 2 penalty to

Armor Class. The following changes are in effect as long

as the rage lasts: HD 11d8+44 (93 hp); AC 23, touch 9, flat-

footed 22; Base Attack/Grapple +13/+25; Full Attack 2

claws +17 melee and bite +12 melee; Damage claw 1d4+6,

bite 1d6+4; SV Fort +11, Will +10; Str 23, Con 18; Climb

+24. The rage lasts for 7 rounds, but the farastu can end it

earlier if desired. The creature is not fatigued at the end of

its rage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic, clairaudience/

clairvoyance, fear, invisibility, tongues; 3/dayfog cloud, ray of

enfeeblement; 2/daydispel magic. Caster level 11th; save DC

13 + spell level.

Summon Demodand (Sp): Once per day, a farastu can

attempt to summon 1d4 farastus with a 30% chance of suc-

cess (result of 71100 on d%).

Scent (Ex): A farastu can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A farastus adhesive slime gives it a +8 racial bonus

on Climb checks.

Kelubars are the bureaucrats of demodand society. They act

as intermediaries between the shators and the farastus, as

well as supervisors of farastu squads. The slime that coats

their skin is a perfect match for their odorous personalities.

Kelubars are obese, partly because of the fairly sedentary

lives they lead. They weigh close to 500 pounds, stand about

8 feet tall, and have batlike wings with a span of almost 18

feet. Their skin is knobbed, rough, and leathery, and coated

completely by a pale green slime that gives their dark skin a

grotesque hue.

Like all demodands, kelubars revel in the subservience

of others. While they prefer exchanging words to fight-

ing, they wont hesitate to engage in battle should the

need arise.

Kelubars speak the language of demodands, as well as

Abyssal and Common.

Combat

If caught by surprise, kelubars try to negotiate their way

into a superior position, at the very least delaying opponents

with the appearance of diplomacy while they look for weak-

nesses in potential foes. In a fight, they first try to summon

reinforcements before resorting to spell-like abilities and

then melee, in that order.

Acidic Slime (Ex): The slime secreted by a kelubar adds

+1d6 points of acid damage to each of its melee attacks. On a

successful critical hit, this burst of acid deals +1d10 points of

acid damage.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a kelubars target is denied a

Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a kelubar,

the kelubar deals an additional 4d6 points of damage on a

successful melee attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect magic, clairaudience/

clairvoyance, fear, invisibility, Melf s acid arrow, spider climb,

tongues; 3/dayfog cloud, ray of enfeeblement; 2/dayacid fog,

dispel magic. Caster level 13th; save DC 14 + spell level.

Stench (Ex): A kelubars slime reeks of filth and decay.

All creatures (except other demodands) within 30 feet of a

kelubar must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 19) or be

overcome with nausea. This condition lasts as long as the

creature remains within the area, and for 10 rounds after

the creature leaves. A successful save means the creature is

immune to that kelubars stench for 1 day (but not the

stench of other kelubars).

Summon Demodand (Sp): Once per day, a kelubar can

attempt to summon 1d2 kelubars with a 40% chance of suc-

cess (result of 61100 on d%) or 1d4 farastu with a 60%

chance of success (result of 41100 on d%).

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A kelubar retains its Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or struck by an

Shators make all the decisions about whether to pursue

Carcerian fugitives, using their innate planeshifting abil-

ity to send demodands out as bounty hunters to bring

escapees back. They constantly plot against other Carcer-

ian factions, hoping to extend the demodands influence.

Shators rarely trust one another, preferring to work

through their lackey contingents of farastus and kelubars,

but several will band together if a common obstacle pres-

ents itself.

Shators speak the language of demodands, as well as

Abyssal, Infernal, and Common.

The shators reside at the top of demodand society. If the

farastus are the prison guards of Carceri, the shators are

the wardens. Unusually cruel, shators secretly hope those

that are bound to the plane will attempt to escape, just so

they can hunt the escapees down.

Shators are obese and disgusting. They stand 10 feet tall

and weigh nearly 700 pounds. Large, batlike wings sprout

from their backs, and pale slime drips from the corners of

their froglike, fanged mouths, as well as from their skin.

Shators are usually accompanied by groups of farastu and

kelubar toadies. This retinue often enables a shator to stay

out of combat if it desires. Shators prefer to use their spells

and spell-like abilities from a distance, and can spit their

paralyzing slime as a ranged attack. If forced into melee, a

shator uses its Huge +2 guisarme to trip an opponent from

10 feet away, before following up with a free attack thanks

to its Improved Trip feat. A shator may use this tactic on

several opponents in the same round due to its Combat

Reflexes feat.

Paralyzing Slime (Ex): A shators slime acts as a nerve

toxin. Creatures struck in melee by a shators claw or bite

attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be paralyzed

for 3d6 rounds. The shator can choose to spit a globule of

slime as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, with

the same effect.

DEMON

The Abyss holds an incredible diversity of demons. These

evil denizens come in many forms with varied abilities.

These creatures fight and manipulate each other, each striv-

ing for personal autonomy even as they seek to subjugate

others. When not in conflict among themselves, demons

battle various forces of good as well as the lawful evil inhab-

itants of the Nine Hells.

The largest and most diverse group of demons is the

tanarri, unchallenged masters of the Abyss.

COMBAT

Demons enjoy combat. Those with spell-like abilities often

use them from a distance. Many demons can create dark-

ness, so they frequently do so before joining melee.

Outsider Traits: A demon has darkvision (60-foot range).

It cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or miracle

spell can restore life).

In addition, all tanarri have the following abilities in

common.

Tanarri Traits: Tanarri can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a lan-

guage. A tanarri is immune to electricity and poison, and

it has acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20, and fire resist-

ance 20.

Even among demons there are those that disgust and ter-

rify; the alkilith is one of these. A shapeless horror used

by demon lords for missions in regions most demons

would hesitate to venture into, the alkilith is despised

and feared by most other demons. Alkiliths thrive in the

foulest and most inhospitable places in the Abyss. They

are pollution and corruption made sentient and hate-

fully alive.

An alkilith appears as a shivering blob of phosphores-

cent green corruption surrounded by a cracked, leath-

ery coating that constantly oozes, secretes,

hardens, and splits open. Dark, swollen eye-

globules dot the surface of its body. Though

alkiliths are at least as large as a human,

they can shape their amorphous

bodies to fit through cracks as

small as 1 inch wide.

Combat

Despite their gelatinous

shape, alkiliths can move

at a respectable speed.

They  can  attack  up  to

four times a round with

pseudopods  of  acidic

slime. These hideous

creatures  take  great

pleasure in corrupting

and polluting their envi-

rons, and they have been

known to ignore attackers

for a chance to corrupt a

pool of fresh water. There

seems  to  be  no  upper

limit to an alkiliths size;

planar travelers tell sto-

ries of alkiliths the size

of lakes in the deepest

reaches  of  the  Abyss.

Acid (Su): Anyone struck by an alkiliths pseudopod

must make a Fortitude save (DC 18) or take an additional

1d6 points of acid damage in the current round and each

of the next 1d6 rounds. Additionally, each time a character

fails a Fortitude save against

this attack, one of his items

is put at danger as if he had

rolled  a  natural  1  on  his

saving  throw  (see  Items

Surviving after a Saving

Throw  in  Chapter  10  of

the Players Handbook).

Cloudkill Form (Su):

As a full-round action, an

alkilith  can  assume  the

form of a cloud of noxious

green vapor. The alkilith is

gaseous (as if it were the

target  of  a  gaseous  form

spell)  in  this  form,  and

anyone inside the cloud

suffers as if from a cloudkill

spell. Returning to its solid

form is a full-round action.

cold, unholy blight. Caster level 11th; save DC 17 + spell level.

Amorphous (Ex): An alkilith is not subject to flanking or

critical hits. It is immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun-

ning, and polymorphing.

Blood fiend

Command Ooze (Sp): An alkilith can control the actions of

any ooze within 60 feet as a free action. The ooze is allowed

a Will save (DC 17) to resist.

Immunities (Ex): Alkiliths are immune to harmful gases

such as the effect of a stinking cloud spell and the stench abil-

ity of a monster. They only take half damage from bludg-

eoning weapons.

Blood  fiends  create  more  blood  fiends  from  other

demons in a manner similar to the way vampires create

more vampires from humanoids. Their gaze can sap the

will of mortals.

A blood fiend is an ogre-sized demonic creature that

stands about 9 feet tall. Its thick, scaly hide is a deep

purple color, almost black. Each of its four strong arms

ends in a humanlike hand, each finger of which is tipped

D

E

M

O

N

with a claw. A blood fiend has glowing red eyes and a

wolflike muzzle lined with sharp teeth that seem too large

to fit in its mouth.

Blood fiends speak Abyssal.

Combat

A blood fiend lacks the subtlety of an ordinary vampire. It

does not hesitate to wade into melee with its four claws and

vicious bite.

Blood Drain (Su): A blood fiend sucks blood from living

victims when it hits with its bite attack. Each successful bite

attack deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain.

Domination (Su): Like a vampire, a blood fiend can

crush an opponents will by looking into its eyes. This attack

functions like a gaze attack, except that it is a standard

action, and creatures merely looking at the blood fiend are

not affected. Any creature within 30 feet that the blood

fiend targets for the attack falls instantly under its influence

as though by a dominate monster spell (caster level 18th; Will

save DC 21).

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a blood

fiends claw attack must succeed on a Fortitude saving

throw (DC 21) or gain one negative level. For each nega-

tive level bestowed, the blood fiend heals 5 points of

damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage

the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit

points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a

spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the

afflicted opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC

21) to remove it. Failure means the opponents level (or Hit

Dice) is reduced by one.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect good, detect magic,

teleport without error (self plus maximum load of objects

only);  3/daychaos  hammer,  darkness,  unholy  blight;

1/dayblasphemy, desecrate. Caster level 18th; save DC 15 +

spell level.

Alternate Form (Su): A blood fiend can assume the

shape of a regular or fiendish dire bat, a dire wolf, a

howler, or a nightmare as a standard action. The creature

can remain in the assumed form indefinitely.

Create Spawn (Su): An outsider of the evil subtype slain

by a blood fiends energy drain attack (negative levels equal

to current Hit Dice, or drained below 1st level) rises as a

blood fiend 1d4 days after death. The new blood fiend does

not have any of the abilities it had in life.

Fast Healing (Ex): A blood fiend heals 5 points of

damage per round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. Fast

healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a blood fiend to

regrow or reattach lost body parts. If reduced to 0 hit

points or lower, a blood fiend automatically assumes

gaseous form and attempts to escape. Its fast healing

begins as soon as it has rested anywhere (it is not limited

to a coffin) for 1 hour. A dismissal, dispel evil, banishment,

dictum, or holy word spell cast on it while its current hit

points are below 1 destroys it utterly.

Gaseous Form (Su): At will, a blood fiend can assume

gaseous form as a standard action. This ability functions

like the gaseous form spell (caster level 5th), except that the

blood fiend can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly

speed of 20 feet (perfect).

Turn Resistance (Ex): A blood fiend is treated as an

undead with 6 more Hit Dice than it actually has for the pur-

pose of turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A blood fiend is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. A blood fiend cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. A blood fiend has

darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A blood fiend has a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,

Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive, and

Spot checks.

Klurichir

with the klurichirs movements, while the drool-

ing mouth in the creatures abdomen slavers, smacks,

and occasionally howls.

Klurichirs usually only appear when an Abyssal

lord has developed a personal interest in some task

and wants to ensure its completion. Totally secure in

their power, klurichirs do not hesitate to boss weaker

demons aroundeven balors that moved too slowly have

been known to experience the bite of a klurichirs axe.

Klurichir speak Abyssal, Common, Celestial, Draconic,

Ignan, and Undercommon.

Combat

Klurichirs are brilliant tacticians. They prefer to let the

demons  accompanying  them  enter  melee  while  they

remain at the rear casting defensive spells and using their

more powerful spell-like abilities. If pressed into melee,

they wade into combat with their magic battleaxes, occa-

sionally launching a volley of spines. If one manages to grab

a foe in its lower, nonaxe-wielding hands, it holds the victim

close to its chest, so its vorpal pincers can hack at the victims

head. If a klurichir succeeds in lopping the head from an

opponent with its pincers, it stuffs the head and body into

the grinding mouth below without missing a beat in the

flow of battle.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a klurichir can pro-

duce a fear effect. This ability functions like a fear spell

(caster level 20th; save DC 24), except that it affects all

creatures within a 30-foot radius around the klurichir.

Any creature that makes a saving throw against the effect

cannot be affected again by that klurichirs fear aura for

one day.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a klurichir hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

pincer attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +37). If it gets a hold, it draws

the grappled character toward its vorpal pincers and its

It takes something truly horrifying to frighten the greater

demons of the Abyss. If balors do have nightmares, they can

probably be attributed to the klurichirs. Some demons say

these creatures serve as generals under the greatest Abyssal

lords. Whether that is true or not, the sight of a klurichir

sends most demons scurrying for cover.

A klurichir stands 30 feet tall. Its broadly muscled body

is covered in skin of the blackened color normally associ-

ated with a corpse that dies due to extreme cold. Mon-

strous, red batlike wings flare from its back, and its four

arms constantly twitch and flex as if seeking fresh prey to

crush and destroy. Its face resembles a cross between a

mule and a snarling orc, and spines cover its face, neck,

and upper shoulders.

The creatures most hideous feature is located in the

middle of its abdomen: a large, gaping mouth filled with

a slobbering tongue and rows of blunt, powerful, grind-

ing teeth. Just above this obscene maw sits a pair of mas-

sive, sharp pincers the size of large scythe blades. At rest,

the pincers slowly open and close, while the mouth rests

partially open, a slow trickle of drool leaking from its

slack lips. In battle, the pincers twitch and snap in time

mouth, where it can immediately attempt to attack the

opponent with its vorpal pincers attack (at a +25 attack

bonus). Thereafter, the klurichir can simply use its pincer

to hold the opponent, taking no penalty on its grapple

checks and not considered grappled itself (see Improvd

Grapple, below).  Each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically deals pincer

damage and allows it to make a vorpal pincers attack and a

bite attack on the victim.

Improved Grapple (Ex): Normally, a creature engaged in

a grapple that does not want to be considered grappled must

take a 20 penalty on its grapple check. But the klurichir,

while grappling with its pincers, is never considered grap-

pled. It can conduct grapple attacks with its pincers nor-

mally without taking any penalties on other attacks, and it

need not take the 20 penalty on grapple checks to be con-

sidered not grappling.

Poison (Ex): A klurichir delivers its poison (Fort DC 26

negates) with each successful spine attack. Initial and sec-

ondary damage are the same (2d4 Str).

Rend (Ex): If a klurichir hits a single target with both

pincers, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the

flesh. This attack deals 2d6+13 points of damage. It typically

uses this ability only against Huge and larger creatures,

which it cannot grab.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day a klurichir can auto-

matically summon 4d10 quasits, 1d6 hezrous, 2 nalfeshnees,

2 glabrezus, 2 mariliths, or 2 balors (klurichirs choice).

Vorpal Pincers (Su): A klurichir can make a vorpal

pincers attack against an opponent grappled in its pin-

cers, once each round, if it makes a successful grapple

check. Its vorpal pincers have an attack bonus of +25 and

deal 2d6+13 points of damage with a successful attack.

The pincers threaten a critical hit on a natural attack roll

of 1820 (including both their natural sharpness and the

demons Improved Critical feat). On a successful critical

hit, the pincers sever the opponents head from its body.

Some creatures, such as many aberrations and most

oozes, have no heads. Others, such as golems and undead

creatures other than vampires, are not affected by the loss

of their heads, but most creatures die when their heads are

cut off.

See Invisibility (Su): This ability functions like a see

invisibility spell, except that it is always active and its range

extends to the limit of the klurichirs vision.

Skills: Klurichirs have a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate

and Sense Motive checks and a +4 racial bonus on Move

Silently checks.

Maurezhis are hideous demons that feed on corpses. Unlike

common ghouls, they can assume the forms of humanoid

creatures they consume.

In its natural form, a maurezhi strongly resembles an

ordinary ghoul. Its hunched and gaunt body has the pallor

of death. Its ears are long and pointed, and its mouth is

full of serrated teeth for rending flesh. Its elongated fin-

gers end in wicked claws, and its muscular legs, which

resemble those of a big cat, allows it to run quickly and

pounce on its prey.

Maurezhis speak Abyssal. When a maurezhi assumes

another creatures form, it can speak any language that crea-

ture could speak. Like other tanarri, maurezhis can also

communicate telepathically.

Combat

In its natural form, a maurezhi pounces on its prey and tears

the flesh with its claws and teeth. It fights in a consumed

creatures guise only if it wishes to maintain that disguise or

if it can gain some clear advantage by doing so.

Consume (Ex): When a maurezhi slays a sentient living

creature (Int 3 or higher) and consumes the body, it gains

additional power from this grisly food. It must begin eating

the corpse within 10 minutes of its death and requires 30

minutes to complete the consumption. If the maurezhi is

interrupted during this process, it cant completely consume

the corpse or gain the benefits.

A creature that has been consumed by a maurezhi

cannot be restored to life through any form

of raising or resurrection that requires

part of the corpse. A wish,

miracle, or true resurrection

spell can restore a con-

sumed victim to life, but

there is a 50% chance that

even such powerful mag-

ic will fail.

There is no limit

to  the  number  of

corpses a maurezhi

can consume in this

fashion, but it only

advances (see below)

by  devouring  the

corpses of human-

oids whose Hit Dice

or levels are at least

half its current Hit

Dice. For example, a

maurezhi of 13 Hit

Dice can only advance

by devouring the corpse

of a character of at least 7th level.

Maurezhi

RM

For each suitable humanoid corpse a maurezhi con-

sumes, its Hit Dice, natural armor bonus, Strength, Intel-

ligence, and base attack bonus each increase by +1. Its

base saving throw bonuses improve according to its new

Hit Dice. It gains additional skill points equal to 8 + its

Intelligence modifier, and it spends these additional

points on skills possessed by its victim (all of which are

treated as class skills for the maurezhi). If the added Hit

Die brings the maurezhis total HD to a multiple of four, it

gains a new feat as well, which it can choose from among

the feats its previous victims had, assuming that it meets

the prerequisites. In addition, the maurezhi gains access

to the memories of the creature it has consumed, can

speak any language that creature knew, and can assume

that creatures form (see below).

The maurezhi can reach a maximum of 20 Hit Dice

through advancement. Its damage reduction, spell resist-

ance, and Challenge Rating improve based on its Hit Dice,

as shown on the table below.

or bite attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

rezhis Con modifier)

or  be  paralyzed  for

can make a full attack

even  though  it  has

moved.

Assume Shape (Su):

A maurezhi can take on

the  appearance  of  any

humanoid creature whose

corpse it has consumed. This ability

function like the disguise self spell (DC 15, caster level 10th),

except that the maurezhi can remain in the chosen form

indefinitely. It can assume a new form or return to its own

as a standard action.

Summon Creatures (Sp): This ability functions like a

summon monster spell of the appropriate level, except that it

has only a limited chance of success. Once per day, a mau-

rezhi can summon 1d4 ghouls with a 100% chance of suc-

cess, or 2d4 dretches with a 60% chance of success (result of

41100 on d%). This works like the summon tanarri ability of

other demons.

Skills: A maurezhi has a +8 racial bonus on Jump checks.

When using its assume shape ability, a maurezhi receives

an additional +12 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks

(reflecting its access to the consumed forms memories as

well as its physical alteration).

The devastating and terrible myrmyxicuses are among the

most powerful of the tanarri. They are feared and respected

by most anything they encounter.

A myrmyxicus is a truly terrifying sight. Its greasy green

body is eellike, measuring nearly 25 feet in length. A tall

row of spines runs down its back, and the tip of its tail is

adorned with a slavering lamprey mouth. The myrmyxicus

has a powerfully muscled humanoid torso with four arms

arranged symmetrically around the chest. Six octopoid

tentacles are arranged in a similar manner around the crea-

tures waist, where its torso turns into its long eel-like tail.

The head of a myrmyxicus resembles that of a prehistoric

sea reptile, with a fanged snout and tiny black eyes, but

with the addition of three pairs of curling horns like those

of a ram.

The myrmyxicuses rule vast regions of the Abyssal

oceans from floating citadels made of millions of tons of

fish skeletons and razor-sharp shells and coral. They are

their own masters, and they never serve any other creature

for long. Many myrmyxicuses spend ages looking for ways

to transport their floating citadels into the seas of other

Abyssal  layers  or  even  other  planes  to  expand  their

enslaved empires.

Combat

Unlike most powerful tanarri, the myrmyxicus does not

have a huge array of spell-like powers to rely upon. Not that

it needs such powers; in combat, few creatures can match

the horrible fury of an enraged myrmyxicus. It spreads its

attacks out among any creatures it can affect, only focusing

its attacks on a single target in the rare case when it meets a

creature that poses a challenge.

Breath Weapon (Su): Once per minute, a myrmyxicus

can exhale a 40-foot cone of unholy black vapor. All crea-

tures in this area must make a Reflex save (DC 26) or

become nauseated. Good-aligned creatures take 10d6

points of unholy damage as well (this damage is halved if

the Reflex save is successful). Each round beyond the first

that a good-aligned victim remains in contact with the

vapor,  he  automatically  takes  5d6  points  of  unholy

damage. The vapor remains in the area for 1d6 rounds

before it dissipates.

Charisma  Drain  (Su): An  individual  struck  by  a

myrmyxicuss tail attack must make a Will save (DC 24) or

permanently  lose  1d6  points  of  Charisma  (twice  that

amount on a critical hit). The myrmyxicus heals 5 points of

damage (10 on a critical hit) whenever it drains Charisma,

gaining any excess as temporary hit points.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a myr-

myxicus can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d6+5

points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a myrmyxicus hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with  a  tentacle  attack,  it  deals  normal  damage  and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provok-

ing an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +37). If it gets

a hold, it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the

myrmyxicus has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its tentacle to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the myrmyxicus is not con-

sidered grappled).

Infuse  Scythe  (Su): A  myr-

contact  with  the  scythe.  A  myr-

myxicus may infuse up to four

scythes at a time in

this  manner;  most

carry four huge mas-

terwork scythes with

them for this purpose.

The  act  of  infusing a

scythe is a full-round ac-

may only infuse one scythe

at a time.

The skulvyn is a bestial demon that haunts the reeking seas

of the Abyss, constantly on the hunt for prey to torment

and eat.

A skulvyn looks like a streamlined lizard with broad

clawed feet that are almost flippers. Its head is snakelike in

shape, with a wide jaw and bulging black eyes. It has four

long tails that can propel it through the water at great speed;

the razor-sharp spines on the tails make them terrible

weapons as well.

The most disturbing aspect of a skulvyn may be its

strange aura of magical energy that causes other creatures to

move and react with agonizing slowness. Skulvyns use this

aura to great advantage, remaining just out of reach of a

slowed victim while he gradually bleeds to death.

Skulvyns speak Abyssal.

Combat

Skulvyns usually hunt in schools and concentrate all of

their attacks on one target. They often swarm in to attack for

a round, and then swim away to watch in glee as their victim

bleeds to death from the numerous wounds.

Slow Aura (Su): Living creatures that come within 30

feet  of  a  skulvyn  must  make  a Will  save  (DC  12)  or

become slowed for 4 rounds. Skulvyns are immune to

this aura. A creature that makes a successful saving

throw is immune to that particular skulvyns slow aura

for one day. Creatures that come within range of a pack of

skulvyns must make one saving throw for each skulvyn

in the pack.

Wounding (Ex): Wounds resulting from a skulvyns tail

lash attacks bleed for an additional 1 point of damage per

round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result

in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of

damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped

only by a Heal check (DC 15) or the application of any cure

spell or other healing spell.

Skills: Skulvyns have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered. *They also have a +8 racial bonus on

Hide checks when in water.

Wastriliths are the terrible lords of the watery parts of the

Lower Planes. Standoffish and isolated creatures, they rule

their domain with an iron fist.

A wastrilith has the appearance of a leering eel with a

humanoid torso. Its long, segmented body ends in a power-

ful tail. Its huge, bulging eyes never blink, and its mouth is

full of needle-sharp teeth.

Bullying and arrogant, wastriliths enjoy intimidating

other creatures into fealty. On the Material Plane, they

build magnificent underwater palaces as bases of opera-

tion to terrorize shipping lanes and other aquatic races.

They do not need to eat, but nevertheless relish in devour-

ing the flesh of aquatic elves, merfolk, and other intelli-

gent aquatic creatures. In addition to their murderous

habits, they encourage evil beings to become pirates and

marauders, providing what assistance they can.

Wastriliths speak Common, Abyssal, and Aquan.

Combat

Wastriliths prefer to send minions to do their fighting for

them. They typically summon a host of water-based creatures

to attack, and hurl their formidable spell-like abilities into

the fray.

Wastriliths can be summoned using a summon monster

IX spell.

Breath Weapon (Su): Cone of boiling water, 3d10 points

of damage, 60 feet, every 1d4 rounds; Reflex DC 21 half.

Break Summoning (Ex): If summoned via a summon

monster spell, a wastrilith can make an opposed Wisdom

check to break free of the summoning. If it succeeds, it then

goes on a rampage, attacking the summoner.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, control water,

deeper darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect law, fear, greater

dispelling, read magic, suggestion, telekinesis, teleport without

error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), tongues (self

only), unhallow, unholy blight, wall of ice; 3/daysymbol

(any), unholy aura. Caster level 15th; save DC 14 + spell

level.

Three times per day, a wastrilith can cast summon monster

IX as a 17th-level wizard. It can only summon aquatic and

water-based creatures, such as fiendish sharks or squids and

water elementals.

DEVA

Devas are the rank-and-file soldiers in the never-ending

war of good against evil. Proactive messengers of the

gods of weal, devas prefer to deliver their missives at

swordpoint, and they take their battles to all corners of

the multiverse. Devas most often descend from the

planes of good at the behest of their powerful sponsors.

Agents of good frequently summon them using spells

such as gate or planar ally. Rarely, devas act independ-

ently, spreading the cause with fervent application of

righteous violence.

A deva appears as a handsome human. Two beautiful

feathered wings grow from its back. Devas reluctantly

clothe themselves in simple loincloths or coverings when

traveling to the Material Plane, in deference to mortal cus-

toms. All remnants of a devas body, clothing, and items

vanish upon the creatures death.

Every deva belongs to one of three orders: astral, movanic,

or monadic (astral devas appear in the Monster Manual).

Each order is the political equal of the others, and while

squabbles of personality occasionally occur, the groups

themselves cooperate unfailingly. Devas never knowingly

negotiate with evil creatures, though nonlawful devas occa-

sionally treat with nonevil neutrals.

Devas speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic.

COMBAT

Devas have a number of common qualities that enable them

to act more effectively in battle.

Outsider Traits: A deva has darkvision (60-foot range). It

cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or miracle

spell can restore life).

In addition, all devas have the following abilities in

common.

Celestial Traits: A celestial can speak with any creature

that has a language as though using a tongues spell (caster

level 14th, always active). It is immune to petrification

attacks, and it has low-light vision, darkvision (60 feet), and

a +4 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against poison. As an

outsider, it cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or

miracle spell can restore life).

Immunities (Ex): Devas are immune to acid, cold, and

Immunity to Water (Ex): Wastriliths are immune to

electricity. Monadic devas also have fire immunity.

attacks that are based on water.

Telepathy (Su): Wastriliths can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Water Mastery (Ex): A wastrilith gains a +1 bonus on

its attack and damage rolls if its opponent is touching

water.

Skills: Wastriliths have a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate

checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard and can

always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered.

Protective Aura (Su): As a free action, a deva can sur-

round itself with a nimbus of light that has a radius of 20

feet. This aura acts as a double-strength magic circle against

evil and as a minor globe of invulnerability, both as cast by a sor-

cerer whose level is equal to the devas Hit Dice. The aura can

be dispelled, but the deva can create it again as a free action

on its next turn.

By far the most stoic of their kind, monadic devas keep

an eye on the Ethereal Plane and the Elemental Planes at

the request of their heavenly masters. This assignment

has granted them heroic patience and a greater apprecia-

tion for balance than found among their counterparts.

Elemental Ease (Ex):

Monadic devas are immune

to the deleterious effects

of  elemental  traits  of  air-

dominant, earth-dominant,

fire-dominant, and water-dominant

planes (see Chapter 1 of Manual of

the Planes). They can breathe in any

environment as if wearing a necklace of adaptation.

Change Shape (Su): A monadic deva can assume the

form of any Small or Medium humanoid.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Devas retain their Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or struck by an

invisible attacker, and they cannot be flanked except by a

rogue of at least 14th level.

As the most numerous and weakest of their kind, movanic

devas serve proudly as infantry against the hordes of evil.

Tasked with serving the needs of the Positive Energy Plane,

the Negative Energy Plane, and the Material Plane, some

movanic devas consider themselves more worldly than

their astral and monadic counterparts, since their travels

grant them a better grasp of mortal affairs.

Slender and exceedingly agile, movanic devas have

milky white skin and silvery hair and eyes. When at peace

among mortals, they prefer to take the form of a human-

oid or animal.

Combat

Movanic devas enjoy combat and prefer to wade into melee

with a firm grip on their +1 flaming greatswords.

Movanic devas can be summoned using a summon monster

VII spell.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willaid, consecrate, continual flame,

create food and water, death ward, detect evil, discern lies, prayer,

protection from arrows; 3/dayatonement, bless weapon, cure serious

wounds, daylight, divination, ethereal jaunt, hallow, holy smite, neutra-

lize poison, plane shift, remove curse, remove disease, remove fear;

1/daycommune, raise dead. Caster level 9th; save DC 14 +

spell level.

Divine Equilibrium (Ex): Movanic devas are im-

mune to the effects of negative-dominant or positive-

dominant planar energy traits (see Chapter 1 in Manual

of the Planes).

Heavenly Deflection (Su): Once per round as a free

action, a movanic deva can deflect ranged attacks and cer-

tain spells by batting them away with its +1 flaming great-

sword. When a ranged attack, ray, or single-target spell

would ordinarily hit or affect the deva, the deva can make

a Reflex saving throw against a base DC of 20. If the

ranged  weapon  has  an  enhancement  bonus,  the  DC

increases by that amount. If the attack is from a spell, the

spell level is added to the base DC. If the deva succeeds, it

deflects the attack. Deflected spells are negated as if

counterspelled.

The deva must be aware of an attack in order to have a

chance to deflect it.

Change Shape: A movanic deva can assume the form of

any Small or Medium humanoid.

Soothing Presence of Nature (Ex): Movanic devas have

a calm spirit that is pleasing to inhabitants of the natural

world. Unless magically compelled to do so, no plant or

animal will attack a movanic deva.

DEVIL

The Nine Hells of Baator are home to many fiendishly evil

beings. The most numerous of the devils are the baatezu,

who are infamous for their strength, evil temperament, and

ruthlessly efficient organization. Among the baatezu are the

paeliryon and xerfilstyx. Though these two kinds of devils

wield terrible powers, they have different characteristics

and appearances.

COMBAT

Both the paeliryon and xerfilstyx begin battle by using

their spell-like abilities. After that, they use some of their

more specialized attacks to destroy their foes.

Baatezu Traits (Su): A baatezu sees perfectly in dark-

ness of any kind, even that created by deeper darkness

spells. It can communicate telepathically with any crea-

ture within 100 feet that has a language. A baatezu is

immune to fire and poison, and it has acid resistance 20.

A paeliryon has cold resistance 20, and a xerfilstyx has

cold immunity.

Outsider Traits: Outsiders have darkvision (60-foot

range), and they cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, a paeliryon can auto-

matically summon 4 lemures, 4 osyluths, 4 barbazu, 2

erinyes, 2 cornugons, or 2 gelugons (paeliryons choice).

Twice per day a xerfilstyx can automatically summon 4

lemures, 4 osyluths, 4 kytons, 4 hellcats, 2 erinyes, 2 gelu-

gons, or 2 pit fiends (xerfilstyxs choice).

back, and it stinks of unwashed bodies and brimstone. The

devils body combines elements of both male and female

anatomy. The most disturbing feature about a paeliryon,

though, is its face. The devils hideous visage sports an

overly wide mouth full of sharp teeth. Warts and boils

erupt all over its face, which is painted in a mockery of a

courtesans. Rouge is applied thickly to the paeliryons

cheeks, its lips shine with a waxy red sheen, and its wide,

reptilian eyes are surrounded by blue makeup. To top it all

off, a paeliryons long fingernails are always stained a bril-

liant red that never fades.

Rarely do denizens of the Material Plane meet a paeliryon

face to face, since these devils prefer to work from behind

the scenes, where they orchestrate tyrannical takeovers

and manipulate events through their many lackeys. Few

have successfully dealt with the vile devils. Fewer still have

survived such an encounter. When a paeliryon deems it

necessary to become involved in some scheme itself, its

usually because some plan has gone awry, and the creature

is on the warpath.

Paeliryons speak Infernal, Celestial, Common, Under-

common, and Draconic.

Combat

A paeliryon nearly always begins a battle with one of its

many spell-like abilities. It targets ranged attackers and

spellcasters first, then hovers over landbound melee fight-

ers and uses its fingernails to deadly effect, wounding and

deforming the hardiest opponents.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A paeliryons fingernails

threaten a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1720 due to

the creatures augmented critical ability and its Improved

Critical feat. On a successful critical hit with its fingernails,

the paeliryon deals triple damage.

Belittle (Ex): As a stan-

dard action, a paeliryon

Paeliryon

Paeliryons believe that information

is the key to power. Frequently

found running extensive spy

rings on nearly every plane,

they have minions gathering

secrets wherever such informa-

tion could translate into further-

ing a paeliryons goals.

A paeliryons skin color is a

mix of sickly green and pink.

It stands nearly 20 feet high,

but its height is overshadowed

by its massive obesity. Heavy,

batlike wings sprout from its

can belittle creatures by hurling insults and epithets that

seem to strike at the heart of its foes insecurities. This is a

mind-affecting effect that originates from the paeliryon

and extends outward in a 60-foot cone. All opponents

within the cone must make a Will save (DC 24) or be

stunned for 1 round. Those who succeed on their saves

but remain within the cone must continue to save each

round that the paeliryon continues to belittle them. After

being stunned, opponents become shaken for 3d4 rounds,

though they cannot be stunned again by that paerliyon for

one day.

Deform (Su): A paeliryon can twist and deform victims

struck by its fingernails. Those struck by the fingernails

must make a Fortitude save (DC 24). Success indicates the

victim takes only normal fingernail damage. Failure indi-

cates the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in

addition to normal damage.

Fingernails (Ex): A paeliryons fingernails are its dead-

liest weapon. It can extend them from its hands, which

enables it to attack foes up to 30 feet away with them as if it

had 30-foot reach. Those struck by a paeliryons fingernails

may fall prey to its deform special attack, as well as take

normal damage. A paeliryon can extend or retract its finger-

nails at will (a free action).

Intoxicating Scent (Su): Any creature that comes within

30 feet of a paeliryon must make a Will save (DC 24) or be

intoxicated by the monsters pernicious aura. This ability

works like a mind fog spell cast by a 20th-level caster; its

effects persist as long as the victim remains within 30 feet of

the devil, plus an additional 2d6 rounds. A creature that

succeeds on its Will save against the devils intoxicating

scent remains immune to that paeliryons intoxicating scent

for one day.

PAELIRYONS AND ORIENTAL ADVENTURES

If you are using Oriental Adventures in your campaign, the paeliryon

works well as a Shadowlands oni. It gains the Shadowlands subtype

while  losing  the  Lawful  subtype.  Its  Taint  score  is  12.  It  loses  its

baatezu traits (including its fire and poison immunity and resistance to

acid) while gaining oni qualities including cold, fire, and acid resistance

10 and an alternate form ability. It also gains regeneration 3, and it

takes  normal  damage  from  jade  or  Kuni  crystal  weapons  and  from

Tongues (Su): A paeliryon can speak with any creature

that has a language, as though using a tongues spell cast by a

20th-level sorcerer. This ability is always active.

Xerfilstyxes are the stealers of memories and the keepers

of thoughts. Lairing mostly on the banks of the River Styx

in Avernus, the first layer of Baator, they keep guard over

its shores.

Xerfilstyxes resemble classic devils from the waist up.

They have a muscular, humanoid torso and arms, and their

D

V

I

L

59

heads feature both a large, toothy maw and two massive

black horns that sprout from their foreheads. Their hands

have large, hooked claws, and giant blue bat wings

grow from a xerfilstyxs back.

From the waist down, these devils look like

giant slugs. Their lower bodies drag behind

them on the ground, leaving a thick, slippery

trail of slime wherever they go. Their skin is

a near-translucent, sickly blue.

Running all over their bodies,

and vividly visible beneath

their  skin,  are  massive

veins  that  pulse  red  the

color of blood.

Xerfilstyxes are totally mad.

They  swim  frequently  in  the

River Styx, and the constant bom-

bardment of the memories of the

lost souls that come to Baator has long

since driven each member of the race to insanity.

They take umbrage with any creature that tries to

gain access to the river, often observing such indi-

viduals from a distance to gauge their strength

before attacking with a furious vengeance.

Even other devils tend to

avoid xerfilstyxes, since the

xerfilstyxes insanity makes

them very unpredictable, espe-

cially for the lawful denizens

of Baator.

Xerfilstyxes know a smat-

tering of all languages and often

switch between a long-forgotten tongue and a current lan-

guage in the middle of a sentence.

Combat

A xerfilstyx nearly always begins a battle with a barrage of

offensive spell-like abilities. It enjoys the carnage of melee,

however, and closes quickly. A xerfilstyx on Baator always

tries to draw its opponent near the River Styx so it can use its

toss ability to throw the foe into the rivers waters. Otherwise,

it brings its foul tail to bear by trying to attach it to an oppo-

nent and drain the opponent of both blood and memories.

Attach (Ex): If a xerfilstyx hits with a tail attack, the tail,

in addition to dealing normal damage, attaches to the oppo-

nents body. Then it draws the stuck opponent into the xer-

filstyxs square (no attack of opportunity) unless that crea-

ture breaks free, which requires a successful Escape Artist

check (DC 30) or Strength check (DC 26). A xerfilstyx that

has attached itself to an opponent for 1 round can begin to

drain the victims blood and memories through a plethora of

small suckers covering its tail.

Blood Drain (Su): A xerfilstyx can suck the blood from a

living victim with tiny suckers in its tail, dealing 1d4 points

of Constitution drain each round it remains attached.

Breath Weapon (Su): A xerfilstyx can spew forth a 50-

foot cone of scalding blood mixed with water from the River

Styx as a standard action. To use this attack, the xer-

filstyx must have drained blood from a victim

within the past day. The amount of damage

dealt depends on how many points of

Constitution it has drained within

that period of time. For each point

drained, its breath weapon deals

1d8 points of damage (maxi-

mum 20d8 on a single use). A

xerfilstyx typically has 1d6+9

points of drained Constitu-

tion  available  for  use  as  a

breath  weapon  when  ini-

tially encountered. A suc-

cessful Reflex save (DC 24)

halves the damage. Any crea-

ture caught in the breath

weapons  area  must  also

make a Will save (DC 22)

or suffer the effects of a

modify memory spell (caster

level 20th) that erases all

recollection of the en-

counter with the xerfil-

styx up until the point

just after its breath weap-

on was used. A xerfilstyx uses this

ability not only to deal damage but also to pos-

sibly end a combat that has turned against it.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a xerfilstyx can produce

a fear effect. This ability functions like a fear spell (caster

level 20th; Will save DC 22), except that it affects all crea-

tures in a 30-foot radius around the xerfilstyx. Any creature

that makes a successful saving throw against the effect

cannot be affected again by that xerfilstyxs fear aura for one

day. All baatezu are immune to the xerfilstyxs fear aura.

Memory Theft (Su): A creature attached to a xerfilstyxs tail

must make a Will save (DC 22) or be subject to a modify

memory spell (caster level 20th)(. This effect is identical to the

memory-altering effects of the xerfilstyxs breath weapon.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblasphemy, charm person,

cone of cold, confusion, desecrate, detect good, detect magic, dispel

good, dispel magic, hold person, ice storm, improved invisibility,

legend lore, magic circle against good, major image, suggestion,

telekinesis,  teleport  without  error  (self  plus  maximum

load  of  objects  only),  unhallow,  unholy  aura,  wall  of  ice;

2/daymeteor swarm, insanity, power word blind, symbol (any);

1/dayenergy drain, foresight. Caster level 20th; save DC 14 +

spell level.

Xerfilstyx

Toss (Ex): After a successful charge attack, a xerfilstyx

gets a free trip attempt. If the xerfilstyx wins the opposed

Strength check during the trip attempt, instead of simply

knocking the opponent prone, it tosses the opponent into

60

The dire rhinoceros is a massive, woolly creature with a

single nasal horn that often grows up to 10 feet in length.

A typical dire rhinoceros grows up to 30 feet long (exclud-

ing the horn) and can weigh up to 10,000 pounds.

COMBAT

A dire rhinoceros always initiates combat with a charge

attack if it can, so that it can wade into the midst of its

enemy with its horn.

Dire rhinoceroses can be summoned using a summon

natures ally VII spell.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A dire rhinoceross gore

attack threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1720

because of the creatures augmented critical ability and its

Improved Critical feat. On a successful critical hit with a

gore attack, a dire rhinoceros deals triple damage.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a dire rhinoceros can

trample opponents at least one size category smaller than

itself. This attack deals 2d12+15 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack

of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 28) for

half damage.

Scent (Ex): A dire rhinoceros can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes,

and track by sense of smell.

Dire rhinoceros

the air with its horns, dropping the opponent prone into any

square it threatens. This toss deals 1d6 points of falling

damage in addition to the damage that was done with the

initial charge attack. Characters with ranks in the Tumble

skill who are not flat-footed can make a Tumble check (DC

15) to avoid this damage and land on their feet.

Fast Healing (Ex): A xerfilstyx regains lost hit points at

the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does

not allow a xerfilstyx to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Immunities (Ex): A xerfilstyx is immune to piercing

damage, cold, mind-affecting effects, and all harmful effects

of the River Styx.

Knowledgeable (Ex): Swimming for so long in the River

Styx has made xerfilstyxes some of the most knowledgeable

beings in Baator. A xerfilstyx makes Knowledge checks for

any Knowledge skills as if it had a minimum of 10 ranks in

that skill. To surpass the 10-rank minimum, the xerfilstyx

must assign more than 10 ranks to the skill as normal.

Skills: Xerfilstyxes have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered. *A xerfilstyx has a +10 racial bonus

on Hide checks while submerged in water due to its natu-

ral coloring.

Disenchanters are the result of

experimentation by a group of

desperate generals who needed

a beast of war capable of reduc-

ing the magical strength of their

enemies. The experiment went a

bit too well, and numerous disen-

chanters escaped their creators

and now roam the wilds, searching

for magic to consume.

A disenchanter is a powerfully built

quadruped with an elongated neck

and head. It has a sturdy tail that ends

in a knotty ball the size of a mans head.

Its hide is covered in silvery scales that

glint in the sunlight. Its most impressive

feature is its tongue, which can extend

15 feet from its mouth. This tongue

is extremely tough and

flexible and is split at

the end.

62

A disenchanter is ferocious in combat, drawn to opponents

that are loaded down with magic items. It chooses the

character with the most powerful items first, grappling

with its tongue and trying to increase its strength. It some-

times tries to disarm an opponent, then runs away with a

particularly powerful item until it has been drained of all

magic before returning for more.

While draining magic, a disenchanter can still attack with

its hooves and powerful tail, and it thrashes about wildly

while feeding. The creature often uses its tongue to grapple

and constrict an opponent.

Adhesive (Ex): A disenchanters tongue is coated with a

powerful adhesive that allows it to hold creatures or items

fast in order to feed. This adhesive gives the disenchanter a

+8 bonus on grapple checks and disarm attempts.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a disen-

chanter  can  constrict  a  grabbed  opponent  held  by  its

tongue, dealing 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage.

Detect Magic (Su): A disenchanter is always aware of any

magical auras within 60 feet, and it can instantly determine

the number, strength, and location of each aura. This ability is

otherwise similar to the detect magic spell.

Disenchant (Su): Magic weapons

that successfully hit the disenchanter

deal normal damage, but must make

a successful Fortitude save (DC 20) or

be reduced in power. On a failed save,

the weapon permanently loses one ran-

domly determined special ability. If the

magic weapon has no more special abil-

ities (or never had any), then the dis-

enchanter  permanently  drains  1

point of its enhancement bonus.

Magic  items  that  are  disen-

chanted in this way do not give

the disenchanter temporary hit

points the way its drain magic

ability does (see below).

Drain Magic (Su): If a disen-

chanter hits an opponent with its

tongue attack, it can choose to drain

any magic items that the opponent

might have. It affects magic items in

the following order: shield, armor,

helmet, item in hand, cloak, stowed or

sheathed weapon, bracers,

clothing, jewelry (including

rings), and anything remaining.

Disenchanter

The disenchanter can choose to keep its tongue stuck to

the item until it is completely drained. Each full round

that the tongue is attached to an item, the disenchanter

drains a special ability or 1 point of enhancement bonus,

or 10 to 40 percent (1d410%) of any remaining charges

for charged items such as wands. For every special ability

or point of enhancement bonus that the disenchanter

drains, it gains 10 temporary hit points.

For every charge it drains, it gains 1

temporary hit point.

An  opponent  can  attempt  a

Strength check (DC 23) to pry

an item away from the disen-

chanters  adhesive  tongue.  A

disenchanter can still attack with

its  hooves  and  tail  slam  while

attached to an item.

Improved  Grab  (Ex): If  a  disen-

chanter hits an opponent that is at least

one size category smaller than itself with a

tongue attack, it attempts to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +37, including

the bonus from its adhesive). If it gets a hold, it also con-

stricts on the same round. Thereafter, the disenchanter

usually simply uses its tongue to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the disenchanter is not

considered grappled).

Ethereal  oozes  are  creatures

native to the Ethereal Plane that hunt and feed off material

beings. Their terrifying, seemingly unstoppable attacks have

given rise to countless myths about the wrath of gods and

stories of mysterious disappearances.

A typical ethereal ooze has a shape similar to that of a

gelatinous cube. It is filled with a turgid swirl of fleshy color

and the remains of its previous meals.

Combat

Much like a ghost, an ethereal ooze lurks in material form

on the Ethereal Plane until it detects a creature on the Mate-

rial Plane large enough to attract its interest (at least Small

in size). The ethereal ooze then manifests and moves toward

the creature, hoping to move over it incorporeally and

become ethereal before it can run away.

Acid (Ex): An ethereal ooze secretes a digestive acid that

dissolves flesh. Any melee hit against a creature on the Ethe-

real Plane deals acid damage.

Blindsight (Ex): An ethereal oozes entire body is a primi-

tive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent, vibration,

and sound within 60 feet. An ethereal ooze usually does not

need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures within

range of its blindsight. An ethereal ooze on the Ethereal Plane

can ascertain creatures and objects on the Material Plane

within 60 feet. Material objects still block sounds from the

Material Plane, and a silence spell blocks the ethereal oozes

perception of creatures and object on the Material Plane.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +24), an ethereal ooze can constrict a grabbed oppo-

nent, dealing automatic slam and acid damage.

63

Engulf (Ex): Although it moves slowly, an ethereal ooze

can simply mow down Large or smaller prey on the Ethereal

Plane as a standard action. It cannot make a slam attack on

the round it engulfs prey. The ethereal ooze merely has to

move over the opponents, affecting as many as it can cover.

Opponents can make opportunity attacks against the ethe-

real ooze, but if they do, they are not entitled to a saving

throw. Those who do not attempt opportunity attacks must

succeed on a Reflex save (DC 20) or be engulfed; on a suc-

cess they are pushed back or aside (opponents choice) as the

ethereal ooze moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject

to the oozes constrict damage and are considered grappled

and trapped within its body. A creature so trapped cannot

breathe and must hold its breath or suffocate.

Etherealize (Su): After manifesting on the Material

Plane, an ethereal ooze can attempt to etherealize material

targets. To do so, it moves over them, covering as many tar-

gets of Large size or smaller as it can.These targets can make

attacks of opportunity against the ethereal ooze, but it is

incorporeal. The ethereal ooze can then make use of its ethe-

realize ability as a standard action. Creatures covered by its

body must make a Will saving throw (DC 20) or be drawn

into the Ethereal Plane inside the ethereal ooze. Such a crea-

ture is then considered engulfed.

Should a victim manage to win its way free of the ethereal

ooze on the Ethereal Plane, the ooze continues to attack. Crea-

tures freed of the ooze while ethereal remain in that state, and

they must find their own way back to the Material Plane.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an ethereal ooze hits an opponent

on the Ethereal Plane that is at least one size category smaller

than itself with a slam attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold,

it constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the ethereal ooze

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use

its pseudopod to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the ethereal ooze is not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple check it makes during

successive rounds automatically deals slam and acid damage.

Incorporeal Subtype: An ethereal ooze can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. It can pass through solid

objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natu-

ral armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and

force effects work normally against them. An ethereal ooze

always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen

checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Manifestation (Su): An ethereal ooze dwells on the Ethe-

real Plane. As an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be

affected by anything in the material world (except that it can

be targeted by force effects and abjurations that originate on

the Material Plane). When an ethereal ooze manifests, it

partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but

incorporeal on the Material Plane. A manifested ooze

cannot harm material opponents except by using its ethere-

alize ability. A manifested ooze remains partially on the

Ethereal Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested

ooze can be attacked by opponents on either the Material

Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ethereal oozes incorporeal-

ity helps protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not

foes on the Ethereal Plane.

Ooze Traits: An ethereal ooze is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and poly-

morphing. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

ETHERGAUNT

Travelers to the Ethereal Plane report vast fields of noth-

ingness, roiling fog cloaking a barren landscape. Some-

times, however, they come upon fantastic stone pyramids

or cyclopean menhirs topped with flashing magical flames,

relics of an ancient race. Knowledgeable scholars refer to

the fearsome creators of these structures as ethergaunts,

after their emaciated, delicate frames. An advanced culture

that abandoned the Material Plane more than 10,000 years

ago, the ethergaunts are finally coming back.

Adult ethergaunts stand 8 feet tall and resemble extraor-

dinarily thin humanoids. An ethergaunts long, thin arms

reach to mid-calf; each hand has three agile fingers and a

thumb. An inhuman face caps a short neck that protrudes

from the center of the creatures chest, giving the ethergaunt

a somewhat stooped appearance. Because few creatures can

gaze upon an ethergaunts face without taking severe

damage to their psyches, the creatures have developed

bisected masks that serve to give them a somewhat human-

like appearance. Dozens of colorful, prehensile tendrils

emerge from behind the mask like a mane of thick, fleshy

hair. The faceplate resembles a featureless porcelain visage,

and the masks color reveals the ethergaunts role in the crea-

tures pragmatic society. Red ethergaunts serve the race as

scientists and explorers. White ethergaunts manage the

reds affairs and form the primary government of the race.

The dreaded black ethergaunts control the entire society of

ethergaunts; fewer than one hundred blacks are thought to

exist. Other colors and roles may exist.

Ethergaunts have a great disdain for the creatures that

have inhabited their world since their ancient departure.

They have progressed technologically and philosophically

to a point where they consider most inhabitants of the

Material Plane no more relevant than insects. While they

see themselves as beyond good and evil in the classic sense,

they are not pleased at the current infestation of their old

home, and have set upon the most devastating extermina-

tion in history.

Ethergaunts communicate with each other by wriggling

their head tendrils, which transmits a psychic soundprint

identifiable as language to other ethergaunts within normal

hearing range. They occasionally communicate with mem-

bers of Material Plane races by revealing their true faces to

one of the creatures cohorts and using that dominated ally

as a psychic puppet-envoy. In such communications, the

ethergaunts refer to themselves as the khen-zai. Ethergaunts

can hear normally, despite the fact that they cannot speak.

Ethergaunts communicate with each other using their

own language, Khen-Zai, which cannot be learned by those

who lack their unique anatomy. Most know a smattering of

other languagesusually tongues plucked from the minds

of enslaved envoys. Common additional languages include

Common, Draconic, Dwarven, and Elven.

COMBAT

Though members of each ethergaunt caste have unique

individual spells and abilities, the race as a whole shares a

number of characteristics.

Enslave (Su): Three times per day, an ethergaunt can

attempt to enslave any one living creature within 30 feet.

This ability functions similarly to a dominate monster spell

(caster level 16th; Will save DC 13 for red, DC 16 for white,

and DC 20 for black ethergaunts). An enslaved creature

obeys the ethergaunts telepathic commands to the letter.

The subject can attempt a new Will save every day to break

free. Otherwise, the ethergaunts control is broken only by

the death of either the ethergaunt or the enslaved creature,

or by a remove curse or dispel magic effect, or if the ethergaunt

travels more than 1 mile from the enslaved creature or trav-

els to a different plane from the one its thrall is on.

At any given time, an ethergaunt may have one slave per

point of Charisma bonus (normally one slave for a red or

white ethergaunt or two for a black, although exceptional

individuals may be able to command more slaves).

Stupefying Gaze (Su): An ethergaunt can open and close

its vertically bisected mask as a free action, revealing a hor-

rifically alien morass of facial organs and orifices. On its

turn, the creature decides if it wants its mask open or closed.

Anyone within 30 feet of an ethergaunt with an open mask

who meets the creatures gaze must succeed on a Will saving

throw (DC 13 for red, DC 16 for white, and DC 20 for black

ethergaunts) or immediately take 1d4 points of Intelligence,

Wisdom, and Charisma damage. A creature that successfully

saves against this effect cannot be affected by the same

ethergaunts stupefying gaze for one day.

Ethergaunts are immune to their own gaze attacks and to

those of others of their kind.

Immunity to Spells (Su): Ethergaunts may choose to

ignore the effects of arcane spells, just as if the spellcaster

had failed to overcome spell resistance. They have no

power over divine spells, having long ago rationalized

divinity out of their racial philosophy. Though powerful,

this ability is somewhat limited. It applies only to arcane

spells of 2nd level or lower for red ethergaunts, 4th level

or lower for white ethergaunts, and 6th level or lower for

black ethergaunts.

Material Jaunt (Su): Ethergaunts dwell on the Ethereal

Plane. While in their natural state of etherealness, they can

perceive but not affect creatures and objects on the Material

Plane. However, an ethergaunt can transport itself from the

Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane as a standard action. It

can remain on the Material Plane for up to 1 round per Hit

Die it possesses. At the end of this time, or when the ether-

gaunt chooses, it becomes ethereal again. An ethergaunt

must remain on the Ethereal Plane for at least 1 hour after a

material jaunt before it can use the ability again.

Ethergaunts who wish to remain on the Material Plane

for a longer time must use plane shift or similar magic. Most

white and black ethergaunts know the plane shift spell and

use it for this purpose.

Total Vision (Ex): An ethergaunts superdeveloped brain

and countless facial sensory organs allow it to discern all

objects within 40 feet, even through the mask that hides its

face. An ethergaunt usually does not need to make Spot or

Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its total

vision. A silence spell has no bearing upon an ethergaunts

total vision.

Black ethergaunts stand at the pin-

nacle of khen-zai society. Honored as

near-divine philosopher-scientists,

the black caste is credited with

advancing  ethergaunt

society  to  its  present

state of perfection. No

lesser khen-zai ques-

tions the will of

a  black  ether-

gaunt, for to

do so is to

question

the  pro-

gress  of  the

Black

ethergaunt

entire race.

By far the thin-

nest and most emaci-

ated  of  the  ethergaunts,

blacks  lack  the  physical

power of their underlings

a  deficiency  balanced  by  a

brain  that  allows  them  to

outthink  even  the  most

intelligent opponent. Their

black faceplates represent a

complete void of emotion

the khen-zai believe that

the  blacks  have  rid

themselves of all

emotion,  thus  al-

lowing them to command

the race without being clouded by weaknesses such as

regret, compassion, and mercy. Despite pretensions to the

contrary, however, most black ethergaunts possess an

abundance of selfish emotions such as greed, ambition,

and hubris.

P

Combat

Black ethergaunts are rarely found without a handful of

powerful slaves that serve as bodyguards. If necessary,

they sacrifice their thralls to protect themselves. Though

they are able to use etherblades, black ethergaunts con-

sider engaging in physical combat to be a sign of failure,

preferring to rely on spells or technological items such

as doubt bombs (see Ethergaunt Items, later in this

entry). They particularly hate clerics, viewing divine

spellcasters as a threat to the khen-zais atheist philoso-

phy. Rather than change that philosophy, the black

ethergaunts have decided to simply eliminate the divine

spellcasters.

Spells: A black ethergaunt can cast arcane spells as a

17th-level wizard (4/7/7/6/6/6/6/3/3/2; save DC 20 + spell

level). A typical spell list: 0daze, disrupt undead, mage hand,

resistance; 1stendurance, expeditious retreat, hypnotism, mage

By far the most frequently encountered caste of ether-

gaunts, reds serve the race as scouts, trackers, and low-

level diplomats (particularly when diplomacy in

fact means exterminating natives to send a

political message). Though they hold an arro-

gant opinion of their own importance in relation

to the current residents of the Material Plane,

reds fully understand their role as the rank-and-

file of the ether legions. The fact that ether-

gaunt grunts generally are more brilliant

than the brightest human mages reveals

much regarding khen-

zai perspective.

White

ethergaunt

Slightly shorter and

bulkier than their supe-

riors, red ethergaunts sport a

crimson  faceplate  that  marks

them as creatures who have yet to

purge the fires of passion from their rational

minds. Accordingly, many of the more power-

ful reds view the struggle against the Mater-

ial Plane races as a battle of the cultured

against ravenous barbarians.

Combat

Red ethergaunts are adept at the use

of the etherblade, a scientific weapon

invented by the khen-zai during

their sojourn to far planes. Most

ethergaunts prefer to take potshots

with the weapon from a

safe  distance  instead  of

engaging in melee.

Spells: A red ethergaunt can cast

arcane  spells  as  a  9th-level  wizard

(4/6/6/4/3/2; save DC 16 + spell level). A typical spell list:

0daze, disrupt undead, mage hand, resistance; 1stexpeditious

placement,  tongues,  vampiric  touch;  4thcharm  monster,

White ethergaunts, who serve the race as scholars, philoso-

phers, diplomats, and bureaucrats, occasionally parley

with the Material Plane races in order to serve the greater

goal of planar domination. Cunning schemers, whites

attempt to purge all emotion from their deal-

ings, instead dedicating them-

selves to an objective (in their

view) pragmatism. Whites seldom give an inch, and negoti-

ations generally boil down to suggestions that fighting off

inevitable genocide will only result in unnecessary struggle

and needless destruction of material resources.

White ethergaunts are the tallest of their race. They often

clothe themselves in robes and skirts of an organic material

resembling rubber. They care nothing for red ethergaunts,

viewing them as worthless pawns (but still a thousand times

more valuable than a hundred Material Plane creatures

lives). Most white ethergaunts respect their black over-

lords, but a few of the most ambitious secretly plan to

usurp their authority and take over ethergaunt society.

Such irrationality, when discovered by the highest caste, is

eradicated immediately.

Combat

Though skilled at the use of the etherblade, most white

ethergaunts avoid melee, preferring to rely upon spells or

the fantastic technological weapons developed by the black

ethergaunt caste (see Ethergaunt Items, below).

Spells: A white ethergaunt can cast arcane spells as a

13th-level wizard (4/6/6/6/6/4/3/2; save DC 18 + spell

level). A typical spell list: 0daze, disrupt undead, mage hand,

resistance; 1stexpeditious retreat, hypnotism, mage armor,

magic missile, shield, true strike; 2nddetect thoughts, glitter-

dust, Melf s acid arrow, mirror image, protection from arrows, see

invisibility; 3rddispel magic, displacement, fireball, haste,

tongues, vampiric touch; 4thcharm monster, improved invisi-

bility, Otilukes resilient sphere, phantasmal killer, rainbow pat-

tern, scrying; 5thcone of cold, dismissal, mind fog (2); 6th

disintegrate, mass suggestion, project image; 7thplane shift,

power word stun.

Ethergaunt Society

Ethergaunt society serves the dual goals of philosophical

progress and self-preservation. The khen-zai define prog-

ress as the culling of emotion in order to approach per-

fect rationality. They define self-preservation as the

removal of any threat to their carefully developed objec-

tive philosophy. The inhabitants of the Material Plane

threaten both philosophy and preservation, and hence

must be destroyed.

Rigidly stratified through an immutable caste system, an

ethergaunts role in society is largely defined by the actions

(or lack thereof ) of its predecessors. The khen-zai long ago

eliminated irrational ambition by ensuring that no ether-

gaunt can ever achieve a greater status. Once during its life-

time, however, an ethergaunt can produce a young khen-zai

through asexual reproduction. The childs caste, and hence

the color it will bear upon its faceplate for its entire life, is

decided before it is born by a cadre of black ethergaunts who

weigh the achievements of the childs ancestors before

assigning the childs caste.

Ethergaunts gather in small communities known as

enclaves, usually situated around a large central pyramid

that serves as a center of learning for the entire community.

The largest such settlements boast as many as ten black

ethergaunts, fifty white ethergaunts, and as many as five

hundred reds.

Ethergaunt Items

Ethergaunts have developed a number of technological

marvels. Because the race shuns art or pleasure, most such

devices facilitate one of two activities: genocide or the

eradication of religious devotion. Though the features of

these objects resemble those of magic items, the objects are

in fact technological and are not affected by spells such as

antimagic field. Only ethergaunts have the knowledge and

skill to build or maintain these devices.

Etherblade: Resembling a short glaive topped with a

hollow barrel, this favored weapon of the ethergaunts can

fire a ray of force as a ranged touch attack for 1d6 points of

damage. The etherblade ray has a range increment of 40 feet.

The weapon can fire 50 times before it is exhausted. It

cannot be recharged.

An etherblade can be used as a two-handed weapon in

melee combat to deal 1d10 points of slashing damage. A

fully charged etherblade has a market price of 800 gp.

Doubt Bomb: This small ceramic sphere contains a

chemical mixture intended to overstimulate the doubt

centers in the brain. The bomb can be thrown as a grenade-

like weapon. A thrown bomb shatters on impact, creating a

cloud of poisonous gas in a 10-foot spread (initial and sec-

ondary damage 1d6 Wisdom, Fort DC 15 negates). Ether-

gaunts are immune to the effects of doubt bombs.

A doubt bomb has a market price of 500 gp.

Ethergaunt Characters

Ethergaunts sometimes become rogues or fighters, but

their favored class is wizard. Ethergaunts who add levels of

wizard add their natural spellcasting ability (9th level, 13th

level, or 17th level) to their class levels in wizard and deter-

mine their spellcasting ability accordingly. For example, a

3rd-level red ethergaunt wizard has the spellcasting ability

of a 12th-level wizard.

Clerics, druids, paladins, and members of any other class

or prestige class that involves channeling devotional energy

or divine magic are not only unknown among ethergaunt

society, but are severely persecuted as contrary to the khen-

Because of its many special abilities, an ethergaunt PCs

effective character level (ECL) is equal to its class level + 12

(red), + 16 (white), or + 20 (black). Such characters would

be considered traitors to their race, especially if they asso-

ciated with Material Plane creatures.

FENSIR

Among the inhabitants of the Plane of Ysgard, fensirs are

commonly called trolls, despite the fact that the two

kinds of creatures are completely unrelated. Fensirs are

giantsalbeit cultured and intelligent ones that desire

only to be left alone. The two different kinds of fensirs are

normal ones (males and females) and the dreaded rakkas

female fensirs that undergo a hideous transformation

that turns them into gigantic brutes that rampage around

the countryside.

Sunlight is anathema to fensirs; they turn to stone the

moment their body is fully exposed to it. Because of this

vulnerability, they are only encountered outside their sod-

covered homes well after dusk.

COMBAT

Like other giants, fensirs hurl rocks with great efficiency

and usually have a few on hand.

Rock Throwing (Ex): An adult fensir has a +1 racial

bonus on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A normal fensir

can hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small

objects) up to five range increments. A rakka can hurl rocks

weighing 60 to 80 pounds (Medium-size objects). The rocks

have a range increment of 120 feet.

Rock Catching (Ex): A normal fensir can catch Small,

Medium-size, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar

shape). A rakka can catch rocks of up to Huge size. Once per

round, a fensir that would normally be hit by a rock can

make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC to

catch a rock is based on the rocks size (see the table below).

If the projectile has a bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases

by that amount. The fensir must be aware of and ready for

the attack.

Sunlight Vulnerability (Ex): If a fensir is caught out in

sunlight, it turns into stone as if by a flesh to stone spell with-

out a saving throw. If in the area of a sunbeam or sunburst

spell, a fensir must make a Fortitude save or be turned to

stone, in addition to the normal effects of the spell. Fensirs

can sense automatically when the sun is about to set or rise

up to 1 hour ahead of the event.

Fensir

69

Fensirs range in size from nearly human stature to that of a

hill giant. They are unattractive beings with huge heads and

enormous noses. Most fensirs have warty skin and deep

black eyes that are often misaligned. Fensirs typically wear

fine leather armor, vests, and big black rabbit-fur hats of

varying styles.

Fensirs are not social creatures, preferring to build their

villages in remote locations such as rocky sea cliffs, high

mountains, and secluded swamps. The vast majority of

fensir births result in fraternal twins, and the two offspring

remain close. These twins have an almost psychic connec-

tion; each knows the location and status of his or her sibling

at all times. The death of one causes the other to do every-

thing in his or her power to avenge the deatheven cross-

ing into the Material Plane to seek vengeance.

Almost all fensirs have the ability to cast spells. Those that

do not show any talent are exiled from the family and are

forced to wander Ysgard. Fensirs are potent diviners and

have the ability to brew almost any kind of magic potion. All

fensirs know how to manufacture a special potion that can

revert fensirs that have been turned to stone back to normal.

This potions effect is like a stone to flesh spell, but it works

only on fensirs.

Fensirs speak Giant and Common.

Combat

Because of their shy nature, fensirs usually remain at a dis-

tance and chase off interlopers with rocks and a variety of

spells. All fensirs have the ability to transmute mud to rock,

which they use to keep a steady supply of rocks on hand to

hurl at opponents. They also use transmute rock to mud to bog

down the enemy.

Fensirs prefer to attack creatures that use spells such as

sunbeam or sunburst.

Spells: A fensir can cast arcane spells as a 5th-level wizard

(4/4/2/1; save DC 11 + spell level). A fensir has the normal

arcane spell failure chance for the armor it wears (10% in the

case of leather armor). A typical spell list: 0detect magic,

ghost sound, ray of frost, read magic; 1stcolor spray, magic mis-

sile, obscuring mist, protection from law; 2ndbulls strength,

darkness; 3rdlightning bolt.

Sense Twin (Ex): A fensir knows the location and health

of his or her twin as if by the status spell with no range limit.

If the death of the twin happened through malicious intent

by another being or beings, the surviving fensir can track

those individuals as if by locate person with no range limit.

After a female fensir gives birth to a pair of young, she may

undergo a transformation into a rakka. If she does so, she

begins to grow until she reaches a height of 20 feet and a

weight of 6,000 pounds. Her intellect dwindles during this

period, and the rest of her family must strip the surrounding

landscape to find enough food to keep the rakka alive and

appeased. The family often gets wild, causing all sorts of

destruction in the rakkas wake. However, the family con-

tinues to support and defend the rakka until she dies,

which is usually a year or so after the transformation.

When a rakka dies, the family that supported her picks

up stakes and wanders the wilds of Ysgard in an activity

known as The Long Walk. These exiled fensirs become a

menace as they pillage the countryside out of anger, spite,

or simple confusion.

Fensir Characters

Combat

Wizard is the favored class of fensir. A fensir that gains

levels of wizard adds its natural spellcasting ability (5th-

level wizard) to its wizard class levels and determines its

spells per day accordingly. For example, a 3rd-level fensir

wizard has the spellcasting ability of an 8th-level wizard. The

effective character level (ECL) of a fensir is equal to its class

level + 9.

Lacking much of the intelligence she once had, a rakka

simply lashes out with her two enormous fists or hurls rocks

at anything that displeases her.

A rakka loses the ability to cast spells, but she still retains

the spell-like abilities of a fensir.

Dying Curse (Su): Just before a rakka is killed, she places

a dying curse on those responsible. This works as a geas/quest

spell cast by an 11th-level caster (DC 20) and usually

involves forcing the afflicted opponent to pay back or serve

the rakkas family.

Rakka Characters

Barbarian is the favored class of rakkas. The effective charac-

ter level (ECL) of a rakka is equal to its class level + 16. Thus,

a 1st-level rakka barbarian has an ECL of 17 and is the equiv-

alent of a 17th-level character.

The fey are known for their curiosity (some would say

obsession) with humanoids and giants, and sometimes a fey

falls in love with one of these creatures. The creatures known

as feytouched have a half-fey and a humanoid or a giant as

ancestors. (Half-fey are described later in this book.)

Feytouched are a widely varied group of beingssome

are wispy and beautiful, while others are ugly and brutish.

Some resemble elves, with pointed ears and almond shaped

eyes. Others look more like trolls, with warty skin and dis-

proportioned limbs. Regardless, all feytouched have at least

one feature or characteristic that is out of the norm

vibrantly colored hair, feathered eyebrows, or a propensity

for speaking in rhyme, for example. Despite their actual

appearance, all feytouched are highly charismatic beings

that draw attention wherever they go.

Feytouched have no cohesive culture;

either they become isolated loners, or

they immerse themselves in cosmo-

politan society, sampling everything

life has to offer. They are also drawn to

the same natural settings that other fey

called home. Most fey respond favor-

ably to feytouched and consider them

distant cousins.

COMBAT

Feytouched  rarely  think  of

combat as something serious.

They enjoy toying with their oppo-

nent, but can become truly enraged

when  things  turn  against  them.

They are usually baffling and erratic

in combat.

Most  fey  first  try  to  avoid

combat by using their charm

person ability. If that fails, they

will fend off attacks until they can

safely flee.

Charm Person (Sp): Once per

day, a feytouched can use charm

person as the spell. Caster level

equals Hit Dice, save DC 11.

Immunity to Mind-Affecting

Effects (Ex): A feytouched is im-

mune to all spells and effects with

the mind-affecting descriptor.

Skills: Feytouched  have  a  +2

racial  bonus  on  Hide  and  Move

Silently checks.

Feytouched

FEYTOUCHED CHARACTERS

A feytoucheds favored class is bard or rogue, although those

that seclude themselves in nature are usually druids or

rangers. Feytouched clerics are rare, since most fey have a

strong aversion to the worship of gods.

The fhorge is a fierce hunter of the Outlands. A cousin to the

dire boars of the Material Plane, the fhorge is tougher,

meaner, and deadlier. Fhorges claim no territory as their

own; instead they roam the land and follow whatever source

of food is most plentiful at the time.

An adult fhorge stands 5 feet tall at the shoulder, and

its  muscular  body  slopes  down  toward  its  smaller

hindquarters like its boar cousins. It has a coat of brown,

black, or gray fur and small, beady eyes. The fhorges most

distinguishing trait is its head, or more specifically its

mouth. Like a crocodiles, the mouth of a fhorge domi-

nates its gnarled face. Large enough to engulf a human,

the mouth bristles with large, razor-sharp teeth and a set

of four tusks.

The bizarre musculature of a fhorges jaw fascinates those

with an interest in the animal worldbut those who have

survived a fhorge encounter have less flattering things to

say about it.

COMBAT

A fhorges strategy in a fight is simple: Shake it until its

dead. The creature charges into battle initially, grabs hold of

its prey in its cavernous mouth, and shakes it until either

the creature dies or the fhorge is slain by another foe.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a fhorge hits an opponent that

is at least one size category smaller than itself with a bite

72

Fhorge

attack, it deals normal

damage  and  attempts  to

start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +22). If it gets a hold, it also

worries on the same round. Thereafter, the fhorge has the

option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

bite to hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check,

but the fhorge is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals worry damage.

Rage (Ex): A fhorge that takes damage in combat flies

into a berserk rage on its next turn and bites madly until

either it or its opponent is dead. The fhorge gains a +4 bonus

to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale

bonus on Will saves, but takes a 2 penalty to Armor Class.

The following changes are in effect as long as the rage lasts:

HD 12d8+87 (136 hp); AC 15, touch 7, flat-footed 15; Base

Attack/Grapple  +11/+24;  Full  Attack  bite  +21  melee;

Damage bite 1d8+15; SV Fort +15, Will +8; Str 33, Con 25. A

fhorge cannot end its rage voluntarily.

Worry (Ex): A fhorge that successfully gets a hold on an

opponent with its improved grab ability shakes the victim

violently back and forth. This attack deals bite damage each

round until the victim breaks free, the fhorge is slain, or the

victim dies.

Ferocity (Ex): A fhorge is such a tenacious combatant

that it continues to fight without penalty even while dis-

abled or dying.

Scent (Ex): A fhorge can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

FLAME SNAKE

Brutish creatures of scales and fire, flame snakes are often

coerced or bribed into serving as guards for royal families.

Mercenaries to the core, even the smallest of these snakes

make effective watchdogs. In the wild, they prefer to lair

in volcanoes (dormant or active) or near hot springs or

steam vents.

All flame snakesminor, lesser, and greaterare

adorned in a mix of red and orange scales. Down the ser-

pents backs run an intricate series of black scales that

form a repeating pattern of ankhs. Their dull eyes never

seem to blink, and, like many reptiles, they spend long

periods of time coiled up and drowsing in the warmth of

their lairs.

All flame snakes understand Ignan, but only the greater

flame snake is capable of speech.

COMBAT

All three species of flame snake use similar tactics in

battle. They prefer to bite their opponents and then allow

their venom to run its course. The smaller, less intelli-

gent flame snakes repeat this tactic until their opponents

are brought down; the more intelligent varieties have

other abilities at their disposal. The flame snakes fiery

venom is one of its most feared weapons. The fierce,

burning agony the toxin causes sometimes drops would-

be intruders even after they have attempted to flee from

the burning creatures.

All flame snakes have some abilities in common.

Heat (Ex): A flame snake generates so much heat that its

mere touch deals additional fire damage. This damage varies

by subrace.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A flame snake is immune to fire dam-

age. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal

from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed,

or if the save is a success or a failure.

Scent (Ex): A flame snake can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: Flame snakes have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

Minor flame snakes are the runts of the species. In clutches

of mixed snakes (which usually consist of 48 minor, 35

lesser, and 12 greater snakes), they are totally subservient

to their more powerful cousins.

Minor flame snakes are typically 4 feet long and about 2

inches in diameter. They seem to glow with heat, and from

certain angles, heat waves appear to radiate off them.

Minor flame snakes enjoy collecting shiny objects, particu-

larly ones made of gold. Unfortunately for the small serpents,

they rarely get to keep such trinkets, for their bigger

brethren like them as well. Even when a minor flame snake

on its own accumulates some sort of hoard, it often forgets

where it left its treasure, so small caches of coins or small

golden objects are often scattered about its territory.

Combat

A minor flame snake tries to begin battle with its burning

hands ability. It then rushes into combat and uses its bite lib-

erally. Minor flame snakes, while not brilliant by any

stretch, know that their venom is particularly toxic and

often engage in hit-and-run tactics against larger groups or

foes that obviously outmatch them.

Burning Hands (Sp): Once per day, a minor flame snake

can use a burning hands ability that functions as the spell of

the same name (caster level 3rd; Ref DC 11).

Fiery Poison (Ex): A minor flame snake delivers its

poison (Fort DC 10 negates) with each successful bite

attack. Initial and secondary damage are the same (1d4 Str).

In addition, if the save fails, the minor flame snakes poison

burns its victim from the inside as it courses through the

opponents body. Each round the poison remains in a

victims bloodstream (maximum 10 rounds), it deals 1 point

snakesor any other creature that wanders nearby.

Lesser flame snakes appear nearly identical to minor

flame snakes, with the exception of being quite a bit larger.

Measuring 7 feet long and 34 inches in diameter, they are

intimidating specimens. The only other significant differ-

ence is the spike of hardened bone that grows from the

creatures tails.

Of  all  three  varieties  of  flame

snake, the lesser ones are

Greater flame snakes look like much larger versions of

their lesser kin; they measure up to 30 feet long and 6 feet in

other flame snakes. Their mostly red scales occasionally are

interspersed with one of the deepest black.

There is more to these great serpents than most suspect.

Greater flame snakes claim, among themselves only, to

once have been powerful fiends. Banished from the Nine

Hells for a long-forgotten transgression, many strive to

regain the levels of power they supposedly once had.

Those who have faced a greater flame snake could give

credence to these claims, since the creatures mere pres-

ence radiates the sort of evil usually associated only with

the dark denizens of Baator and the Abyss.

Greater flame snakes speak Infernal in addition to Ignan.

Greater flame snakes are massive creatures that radiate

evil almost as strongly as they radiate heat. Malicious and

vile, they rule small clutches of flame snakes through fear

and intimidation. Used by only the wealthiest rulers,

greater flame snakes are typically unpredictable. In some

Greater flame snakes use their breath weapons early and

often. They are also constantly hungry and make frequent

use of their swallow whole ability while waiting for their

breath weapon to recharge. Against particularly challeng-

ing foes, they dont hesitate to employ their spell-like abili-

ties, but they know that their best tactic is to stay close to

their opponents and allow their fiery aura to wear their

foes down.

Breath Weapon (Su): Every 1d4 rounds, a greater flame

snake can unleash a 50-foot cone of dark fire. A Reflex save

(DC 23) halves the damage. The breath weapon deals 12d6

points of damage, half of which is fire damage and the

other half of which is negative energy damage.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a

greater flame snake can constrict a grabbed opponent, deal-

ing 4d6+12 points of bludgeoning damage, 1d6 points of fire

damage, and 1d6 points of negative energy damage.

Death Throes (Ex): When slain, a greater flame snake

explodes in a blinding flash of fiery light that deals 30 points

of damage (15 points fire, 15 points negative energy) to

everything within 50 feet. A Reflex save (DC 23) halves the

damage.

Fiery Aura (Ex): Merely being in the presence of a

greater flame snake is damaging. Any creature within 5 feet

of a greater flame snake automatically takes 1d6 points of

fire damage.

Fiery Poison (Ex): A greater flame snake delivers its

poison (Fort DC 26 negates) with each successful bite

attack. Initial and secondary damage are the same (1d4 Str).

In addition, if the save fails, the greater flame snakes poison

burns its victim from the inside as it courses through the

opponents body. Each round the poison remains in a

victims bloodstream (maximum 10 rounds), it deals 4 points

of fire damage (no save). This includes the round in which

the victim was bitten.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a greater flame snake hits an

opponent that is at least one size category smaller than

itself with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +33). If it

gets a hold, it can swallow the opponent on its next suc-

cessful grapple check. Alternatively, the greater flame

snake has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its bite to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but the greater flame snake is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Negative Energy (Su): A greater flame snakes dark

origins  provide  it  with  the  ability  to  deal  negative

energy damage with most of its attacks. See the descrip-

tions of individual special attacks and special qualities

for details.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A greater flame snake can swal-

low a single creature that is at least two size categories

smaller than itself by making a successful grapple check

(grapple bonus +33), provided it already has that opponent

in its maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the

greater flame snake, the opponent takes 2d6+13 points of

crushing damage, 1d4 points of fire damage, and 1d4

points of negative energy damage per round from the

flame snakes stomach. A successful grapple check allows

the swallowed creature to climb out of the stomach and

return to the greater flame snakes maw, where another

successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alterna-

tively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with

either claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Deal-

ing a total of at least 20 points of

damage to the stomach (AC 19)

in this way creates an opening

large enough to permit escape.

Once a single swallowed

creature exits, muscular

action closes the hole;

thus,  another  swal-

lowed opponent must

cut its own way out.

A  greater  flame

snakes stomach can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium-size, or 16

Small or smaller opponents.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayfireball, fire shield (warm

shield only); 1/dayfirestorm, flame strike, maximized fire-

ball. Caster level 16th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Fast Healing (Ex): A greater flame snake regains lost

hit points at the rate of 5 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffoca-

tion, and it does not allow a greater flame snake to regrow

or reattach lost body parts.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A greater flame snake retains its

Dexterity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or

struck by an invisible attacker, and it cannot be flanked

except by a rogue of at least 21st level.

FORMIAN

The highly regimented race of antlike creatures known

as formians have a number of specialized subraces, and

each subrace devotes itself to particular aspects that ben-

efit the welfare of the hive. No single individual matters

except the queen, which other formians protect with

their lives.

The three subraces of formian described below are in

addition to those covered in the Monster Manual (the worker,

warrior, taskmaster, myrmarch, and queen)

COMBAT

Most formians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue

all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest

threat to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to

the  death.  Any  formian  also  attacks  immediately  if

ordered to do so by a superior.

Hive Mind (Ex): All

formians within 50 miles of

their queen are in con-

stant communi-

cation. If one

is aware of a

p a r t i c u l a r

danger, they all

are. If one in a group is not

flat-footed, none of them

are. No formian in a group

is  considered  flanked

unless all of them are.

Immunities (Ex):

Formians have cold,

petrification, and poi-

Armadon

LGW

Outsider Traits: Formians have darkvision (60-foot

range), and they cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Resistances (Ex): All formians have fire, electricity, and

sonic resistance 20.

Armadons are shock troops that

lead the charge into battle and

tear apart anything that gets

in their way. They are utterly

merciless and are sent into the most dangerous situations.

Bulky and well armored, armadons look more like

giant fleas than their antlike formian kin. Their mandibles

are huge, and they have elongated arms that end in pow-

erful claws.

LGW

Armadons do not speak.

Combat

Armadons rush into the thick of battle where they can do

the most damage. They typically release a gout of acid prior

to engaging in melee. Because they are immune to acid, they

use their acid spray in areas with other armadons even if

they are in combat.

Armadons can be summoned using a summon monster

VII spell.

Acid Spray (Ex): An armadon can spray a 20-foot burst of

acid from glands in its tail, dealing 3d8 points of acid

damage to everything in the area. Once an armadon uses

this ability, it cant use it again for 1d4 rounds. A successful

Reflex save (DC 17) halves the damage.

Augmented Critical (Ex): An armadons bite attack

threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1720

because of the creatures augmented critical ability and its

Improved Critical feat. On a successful critical hit with a

bite, an armadon deals triple damage.

Poison (Ex): An armadon

delivers its poison (Fort DC 18

negates) with each success-

ful sting attack. Initial and

secondary damage are the same (1d6 Str).

granting it all-around vision. Its antennae are larger than

those of other subraces, and its arms end in small, delicate

hands used for manipulation, not combat.

Like taskmasters, observers lack mouths and communi-

cate only through telepathy. Observers know Formian and

Common.

Combat

Observers do their best to avoid getting into melee. They

remain in the background so that they can deduce the behav-

ior and tactics of the intruders for the benefit of the other

formians to exploit. In addition to using their evaluation

ability, observers try to determine how many and what kind

of magic the intruders might possess.

(Ex): Observ-

ers  are  ex-

ceptionally

alert and cir-

them a +4 racial bonus on

Spot and Search checks, and

they cant be flanked.

Evaluation (Ex): The in-

credible minds of observers

evaluate and break down the strengths

and weaknesses of enemies in mere moments.

For each full round of combat that an observer

can visually see a single opponent (magical

means, including clairvoyance, do not

work), each formian in contact with the hive mind

gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls against that

opponent. This effect is cumulative for each round of

combat and does not have a limit.

The effect lasts until the observer is killed, knocked

unconscious, blinded, or cannot see the target for 1 full

round. This bonus begins again as soon as the observer sees

them again, starting at +1 per round.

The bonus does not imporve if multiple observers are

watching the same target. Other formians can process the

information from any number of observers watching mul-

tiple targets.

Telepathy (Su): An observer can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 250 feet that has a language.

Winged warrior

LGW

The winged war-

rior is a specialized

version of the standard

formian  warrior.  Teams  and

troops of winged warriors take to the

air to scout ahead of advancing forces

and also lead strike forces to soften up the

enemy for the standard warriors to mop up.

Winged warriors are slightly smaller

than normal warriors. Much of

their mass is centered in their

wings, which have a span of about 10

feet. Instead of a normal stinger, a winged

warrior has a slender tail tipped with sharp

spikes, which it can launch at an opponent.

Winged warriors are much slower on land than their

ground-based counterparts, so they spend the major-

ity of their time in the air. They can remain aloft

for hours at a time before needing rest.

Winged warriors can communicate

effectively through the hive mind, but they do so only to

relay battle plans and tactics. They cannot speak otherwise.

Combat

Winged warriors prefer to launch spikes before swooping in

and fighting in melee. They target anyone using ranged

78

weapons against them first, and then attack the most physi-

cally daunting opponents.

Winged warriors can be summoned using a summon mon-

ster VI spell.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A winged warriors spikes

threaten a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920. On a

successful critical hit with its spikes, a winged warrior deals

triple damage.

Poison (Ex): A winged warrior delivers its poison (Fort

DC 15 negates) with each successful spike attack. Initial and

secondary damage are the same (1d6 Str).

Spikes (Ex): Twice per day, with a snap of its tail, a

winged warrior can release two spikes as a standard action.

This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment.

Fossergrims are reclusive fey that are mystically tied to

waterfalls in the same way that dryads are bound to oak

trees. A fossergrim does not bother anyone who uses its

waterfall for bathing or drinking, but it is merciless

toward anyone who pollutes or dams the river that feeds

the waterfall. Fossergrims have been known to give assis-

tance or information to those in need, as long as those

receiving the information act politely and dont do any-

thing to harm the water.

Legends are told of fossergrims that seduce young maidens

who come to bathe or wash clothing at the banks of their

rivers. This mating produces more fossergrims, who appear

as normal humans until maturity, at which point they seek

out a waterfall of their own.

Fossergrims look like handsome and rugged human

males with flowing white hair and beards tinged with

blue. They have piercing eyes that shimmer like pools of

water. Fossergrims wear beautiful shining

chainmail and carry weapons of fine

quality. They also wear attrac-

tive clothing and exquisite

silver jewelry that glints

in the sunlight.

Although mystically

bound to its water-

fall, a fossergrim

can leave its river,

but it never strays

far. The creature

can swim up its

waterfall as easily

as it walks across

Fossergrim

79

solid ground. Although they do not need shelter, most fos-

sergrims create comfortable and well-furnished lairs in the

caves that are found behind their waterfalls.

When  its  waterfall  freezes  during  the  cold  winter

months, a fossergrim falls into a deep torpor inside the

frozen cascade of ice. It is still aware of its surroundings,

however, and emerges from the ice to protect its river

from harm.

Fossergrims speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

A fossergrim prefers to fight from within the cascading

sheet of its waterfall (providing at least one-half conceal-

ment) and attack with its longspear or longbow. If attacked

while caught away from its waterfall, a fossergrim retreats to

it as quickly as possible.

Many of its special abilities work only when a fossergrim

is standing in splashing water. This includes the waterfall

itself, plus an area that extends out 2d105 feet downstream

(or farther for bigger waterfalls).

A fossergrim can be summoned using a summon natures

ally V spell.

True Strike (Sp): As long as both a fossergrim and its

opponent are standing in the fossergrims river, the fosser-

grim gains a +20 insight bonus on

attack  rolls  as  if  affected  by  the

spell true strike. The distance be-

tween the fossergrim and target does

not matter, although range incre-

ments still apply.

Fast Healing (Ex): When

in splashing water, a fos-

sergrim regains lost hit

points at the rate of 5

per round. Fast heal-

ing does not restore

hit points lost from star-

vation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow a fossergrim to regrow

or reattach lost body parts.

Waterfall Dependency (Su):

Each  fossergrim  is  mystically

bound to a large waterfall and must

never stray more than 1,000 feet

from it. Any who do become ill and

die  within  4d6  hours.  A  fosser-

grims waterfall does not radi-

ate magic.

Skills: A fossergrim has a

+8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some spe-

cial action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on

Swim checks, even if distracted

or endangered.

Gathras are powerful and dangerous

animals that wander the scorched

plains of Avernus, one of the

layers of the Nine Hells.

Although they look like

herd animals, gathras are

actually predators that hunt

down and devour any animal unlucky

enough to be caught in the open.

A gathra looks like a horrid blend

of  boar  and  bull.  It  is  heavily

muscled, with stubby legs that

can propel it at great speed.

Two enormous tusks jut from

its fang-filled mouth, and it

constantly  drools  a  foul-

smelling spittle. The eyes of

a gathra glow with a dim red

light that becomes brighter

COMBAT

Gathras are unsubtle beasts that charge into battle at the

first opportunity. They typically bellow before charging, and

then trample over their cowering opponent. Gathras that are

used as mounts usually have thick armor to improve their

already impressive defenses.

Bellow (Sp): Three times per day, a gathra can let out a ter-

rifying bellow. Everyone within 30 feet must make a Will

save (DC 15) or be affected as if by fear as cast by a 9th-

level wizard.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a gathra can trample

opponents at least one size category smaller than itself.

This attack deals 2d6+8 points of bludgeoning damage. A

trampled  opponent  can  attempt  either  an  attack  of

opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 20) for

half damage.

GIANT

Giants are humanoid-shaped beings of great size who pos-

sess even greater strength. They accomplish much simply

through sheer determination and brute force. Most rely on

their might to solve their problems, and any difficulty that

cant be overcome with their muscles is normally not worth

bothering over. Giants can deal tremendous damage to

those who anger or oppose them, but they can also put their

strength to good use in aiding their allies.

Many giants subsist by hunting or taking what they want

from smaller, weaker beings. A few giants are not so cruel

and raise what crops and livestock they need to survive.

All giants speak Giant. Those with an Intelligence score of

at least 10 also speak Common.

COMBAT

Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive weapons,

especially two-handed ones, and wield them with impres-

sive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe

with ranged attacks before closing, if they can. A giants

favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.

Rock Throwing (Ex): An adult giant is an accomplished

rock thrower, so he or she has a +1 racial bonus on attack

rolls when throwing rocks. A giant of at least Large size can

hurl rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up

to five range increments. (The range increment is 120 feet.)

A Huge giant can hurl rocks weighing 60 to 80 pounds

(Medium-size objects).

Rock Catching (Ex): A giant of at least Large size can

catch Small, Medium-size, or Large rocks (or projectiles of

similar shape). A Huge giant can catch rocks of up to Huge

size. Once per round, a giant that would normally be hit by

a rock can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The

DC to catch a rock is based on the rocks size (see the table

below). If the projectile has a bonus on attack rolls, the DC

increases by that amount. The giant must be aware of and

ready for the attack.

Bog giants are shy and reclusive beings who prowl swamps

and marshlands to hunt dangerous predators such as

black dragons.

Among the smallest of giants, they stand around 10 feet

tall and weigh up to 600 pounds. They are ugly, disgusting

creatures, with mottled froglike skin and long, stringy black

hair. Bog giants have webbed fingers and toes, which allows

them to swim faster than they can walk on land. The typical

clothing for either gender is hide armor made from the skin

of crocodiles.

A bog giants bag contains 2d4 rocks, 1d4+2 mundane

items, and the giants personal possessions. These posses-

sions tend to be well worn, filthy, and waterlogged items

that it got from something it killed for food, and they often

include scraps of fur and hide, bones, and teeth.

Bog giants with sufficient intelligence typically learn

Draconic in addition to Common.

They take advantage of their natural camouflage in swamp

areas to ambush their prey. Some bog giants emulate croco-

diles by grappling an opponent and dragging it under the

water to drown.

Skills: Bog giants have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered. A bog giant has a +4 racial bonus on

Hide checks. *In swamp areas, a bog giants racial bonus

on Hide checks rises to +8.

Bog Giant Society

Bog giants are found exclusively in swamps and marshes.

They spend most of their time hunting, gathering, and scav-

enging rotting meat. They build crude, temporary shelters

in the fallen logs and vines.

Bog giants both venerate and hunt crocodiles, alligators,

and other large reptiles. Most tribes keep pet crocodiles

on tethers around their encampments. Bog giants are on

friendly terms with lizardfolk, although sometimes the two

races come into conflict when food resources are low. Bog

giants despise trolls and attack them on sight.

Bog Giant Characters

A bog giants favored class is ranger. Many groups of bog

giants include both druids and rangers.

Among the crude and simple-

minded  giant  races,  shadow

giants possess a unique aspect:

subtlety. They are feared and

hated even by other giants,

since they have a reputation

for being murderers, thieves,

and assassins against their

own kind. They dwell in par-

ticularly  dark  areas,  in-

cluding  those  that  are

known  to  border  the

Plane of Shadow.

A  shadow  giant

stands  around

20 feet tall and

weighs  around

4,000 pounds. It

is thin and wiry,

with gaunt fea-

tures. However,

despite

Shadow

giant

Bog giant

its emaciated appearance, it is very strong and fit. Males

always have pure white hair, while females tresses are

always pitch black. The eyes of a shadow giant are the color

of a starless void. Shadow giants dress in elegant, if grim,

clothing that is predominately black and blood red.

A shadow giants bag contains 1d2 rocks, 1d6+4 mun-

dane items, and the giants personal possessions. Personal

possessions usually include exquisite sculptures, gem-

stones, and artwork.

Combat

Shadow giants are nimble and elusive. They strike from

darkness before retreating back into it. They rarely attack

directly and prefer ranged attacks to melee.

Shadow giants attack anyone who uses a daylight spell

first, and then they go after anyone else using alternate light

sources. They use their deeper darkness ability before moving

into close combat.

Death Attack (Ex): If a shadow giant studies its victim

for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee

weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack

has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or

killing the target (giants choice). While studying the

victim, the shadow giant can undertake other actions so

long as its attention stays focused on the target and the

target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin

as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails its Forti-

tude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 shadow giants HD +

shadow giants Int modifier) against the death effect, it

dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect,

the victim becomes helpless and unable to act for 1d6

rounds plus 1 round for each 2 HD of the shadow giant. If

the victims saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a

normal sneak attack. Once the shadow giant has com-

pleted the 3 rounds of study, it must make the death attack

within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and

fails (the target makes its save) or if the shadow giant does

not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the

study, 3 new rounds of study are required before the giant

can attempt another death attack.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a shadow giants target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a

shadow giant, the shadow giant deals an additional 4d6

points of damage on a successful melee attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblur, deeper darkness, shades,

shadow evocation, shadow walk. Caster level 18th; save DC 14 +

spell level.

Blindsight (Ex): A shadow giant maneuvers and fights

not only by sight, but also by using hearing and smell to

ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 60 feet. A shadow giant usually

does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice crea-

tures within range of its blindsight.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): As long as a shadow giant is

within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, it can hide itself from

view in the open without anything to actually hide behind.

It cannot, however, hide in its own shadow.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): When exposed to sunlight, or to

light equivalent to a daylight spell, shadow giants take a 2

morale penalty on all attack rolls, saves, checks and

damage rolls.

Skills: A shadow giant has a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks. *In shadowy areas, this bonus rises to +8.

Shadow Giant Society

Even among the normally xenophobic giant race, shadow

giants are incredibly reclusive and distrusting. They prefer a

solitary existence, though some band together out of neces-

sity. The rare shadow giant that settles down typically makes

its lair underground.

Shadow giants are more cerebral and inquisitive than

other giants, and they seek out knowledge as much as

they  do  wealth.  They  have  no  compunctions  about

murder, and they have been known to contract out their

services to kill other giants. Because of this reputation,

most giants attack shadow giants on sightstorm giants

in particular despise them.

Shadow Giant Characters

A shadow giants favored class is rogue. Most groups of

shadow giants include both rogues and sorcerers.

GOLEM

Golems are magically created automatons of great power.

The golems described here supplement the golems in the

Monster Manual and Monster Manual II.

COMBAT

Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong

as well. They are emotionless and cannot be provoked, but

those described here are inherently cruel and love to tor-

ment their foes.

A golems creator can command it if the golem is within

60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If not under a com-

mand, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best

of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The

creator can give a golem a simple program to govern its

actions in his or her absence, such as Remain in an area

and attack all creatures that enter (or only a specific type of

creature), Ring a gong and attack, or the like.

Construct Traits: Golems are immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. A golem is

not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

It cannot heal itself but can be healed through repair. It

cannot be raised or resurrected. All golems have dark-

vision (60-foot range).

CONSTRUCTION

The cost given for each golem includes the price of the

physical body, plus all the materials and spell components

that are consumed during the process or that become a per-

manent part of the golem.

The first task in the construction of a golem is assembling

the golems physical body. The creator can assemble the body

personally or hire someone else to do the job. The builder

must have the appropriate skill, which varies with the kind

of golem being constructed.

The real work of creating a golem involves extended magical

rituals that take two months to complete. Understanding the

rituals requires a character of the specified level who has the

Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats.

The creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in a spe-

cially prepared laboratory or workroom. The chamber is simi-

lar to an alchemists laboratory and costs 500 gp to establish.

When not working on the rituals, the creator must rest

and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or

talking. If personally constructing the golems body, the cre-

ator can perform the building and the rituals together. Miss-

ing a day of rituals means the process fails and must be started

again. Any money spent is lost, but XP are not. The golems

body can be reused, as can the laboratory.

Completing the ritual drains the appropriate XP from the

creator and requires casting any needed spells on the final

day. The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can

come from outside sources, such as scrolls.

The blood golems of Hextor are foul constructs made of the

coagulated blood of sacrificial victims. Girded in magic

armor and bearing masterwork weapons, they bring death

to the enemies of the faith.

Without its armor, a blood golem looks like a vaguely

humanoid shape made out of thickened red and black

blood. It constantly leaks blood wherever it goes and is often

surrounded by swarms of flies and other flying vermin that

dine on its leavings. Although the church of Hextor once

was satisfied with this raw form, recently the creators of

these golems have added a final step in which they seal the

golem in a custom-made suit of +1 full plate with masterwork

heavy flails fused to each of its arms. This suit of armor

includes two spherical reservoirs on the shoulders that store

more blood to fuel the creature. Metal pipes and valves

convey the creatures blood within the armor, but the seals

are imperfect and it still leaks fluid.

Because it is a construct, a blood golem can remain motion-

less in one place for days, although it requires fresh blood on

a regular basis. This requirement makes it a poor guardian

for remote places that do not have many visitors.

Combat

A blood golem is straightforward in combat: It simply

lashes out at its foes with its heavy flails, which are actually

parts of its body. It is a cruel and malicious combatant, in

that it apparently derives satisfaction from slaying enemies

despite its lack of true intelligence.

Blood Siphon (Su): A blood golem can suck the blood out

of a helpless creature or a body that has died within the past

hour, dealing Constitution damage at the rate of 1 point per full

round. Every Constitution point lost in this fashion heals the

golem 5 hit points.  (The golem usually restores its hit points to

maximum before filling its reservoirs so that it can remain at

full strength.) Both the golem and the victim must remain

motionless. Priests of Hextor often provide blood golems with

bound or unconscious victims for this very purpose.

Whirlwind of Death (Ex): A blood golem can spin its

upper body and cause its flails to rotate at high speed. This abil-

ity allows it to attack all creatures within its reach as if it had the

Whirlwind Attack feat. In the round after the golem performs

this maneuver, it can take only a single attack or move action.

Blood Dependency: Because a blood golem constantly

leaks its own vital fluid, it must absorb blood from other

creatures to continue functioning. The golem loses 5 hit

points per day, regardless whether it is engaged in physical

activity or merely stands motionless for the entire day. If the

golems armor is removed or destroyed, this loss increases to

10 hit points per day. If the golem reaches 0 hit points from

blood leakage, it is destroyed, leaving only its armor.

Blood Reservoir

(Ex): The reservoirs

in the golems armor

hold blood equivalent to 20 points of Constitution, which is

about as much as the capacity of two average human bodies.

The golem normally draws 1 point of Constitution from the

reservoir every day to sate its blood dependency. It can draw

blood from its reservoirs as a free action, and it often does so

during combat.

Magic Armor: A blood golem is encased in a suit of full

plate armor with an enhancement bonus of at least +1. If the

golem is destroyed, the armor can be reused for another

blood golem, but it does not resize to fit other creatures.

Magic Immunity: A blood golem is immune to all

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except

BLOOD GOLEMS AND BOOK OF VILE DARKNESS

If you are using the sacrifice rules from Book of Vile Darkness in your

game,  replace  the  Heal  check  to  extract  the  blood  with  a  Knowledge

(religion) check to make a successful sacrifice. The DC is 40, and the

creator need not meet the other prerequisites (minimum level, XP cost,

and spells known) to create the golem if the check is successful.

pqs

as follows. A gentle repose spell acts as a slow spell for 3

rounds with no saving throw. Regenerate restores 1 hit

point of damage per caster level. Horrid wilting does half or

one-quarter damage if the golem fails or succeeds on its

saving throw, respectively.

Rust Vulnerability: A blood golems armor is vulnerable

to rust attacks, such as from a rust monster or the rusting

grasp spell. If its armor is destroyed in this manner, the

golems AC drops and it makes slam attacks instead of flail

attacks. Once its armor is gone, the golem loses its blood

reservoir, and it loses hit points to blood leakage at the rate

of 10 hit points per day instead of 5 per day.

Construction

A blood golems semisolid body is created from the blood of

16 Medium-size humanoids sacrificed to Hextor. The golem

costs 50,000 gp to create. Extracting the blood from the sac-

rificial victims requires a Heal check (DC 15). The creator

must be 14th level and able to cast divine spells. Completing

the creation drains 1,000 XP from the creator and requires

animate objects, bulls strength, gentle repose, and heal.

The magic armor of the golem costs the standard amount

for its kind, except that the materials cost for the master-

work full plate costs more than the normal amount because

of the larger size and special requirements of the golems

physiology (total cost for the armor is 4,150 gp). The master-

work flails cost 315 gp each. Blood golems can be built with

more powerful armors or weapons.

A creation of the mind flayers, a brain golem exists purely to

fulfill their desires.

A brain golem appears as a burly humanoid, about 8 feet

tall and 5 feet wide, with an oversized brain serving as its

entire head. In fact, the whole body is made up of brain

tissue that is covered with a thin film of slimy skin.

Brain golems do not speak or understand any language,

despite their intelligence, but they respond to telepathic

commands from any mind flayer.

Combat

Brain golems enter combat with a mind blast and then focus

their physical attacks on weak-looking opponents. They

never attack mind flayers under any circumstances.

Mind Blast (Su): This attack is a 60-foot cone. Anyone

caught in this area must succeed on a Will save (DC 15) or

be stunned for 3d4 rounds. A brain golem can use this abil-

ity once per minute.

Inertial Armor (Su): A brain golems body is surrounded

by a tangible field of force similar to that created by the mage

armor spell, granting it a +4 armor bonus to Armor Class.

Unlike mundane armor, inertial armor carries no armor

check penalty, speed reduction, or arcane spell failure

chance. Because it is composed of force, incorporeal crea-

tures cant bypass it the way they do normal armor.

Construction

A brain golems body is formed from the brains of intelligent

creatures and topped off with a bud from a mind flayer com-

munitys elder brain to form the creatures head. Its skin is

a membrane secreted by the elder brain bud.

The golem costs 55,000 gp to create, which includes 1,000

gp for the construction of the body. Assembling the body

requires a Heal check (DC 15).

The creator must be 16th level and able to cast arcane

spells. Completing the ritual drains 1,200 XP from the creator

and requires bulls strength, feeblemind, geas/quest, limited wish,

and mage armor.

The ultimate example of fiendish grafting (see Appendix 2),

the demonflesh golem is a collection of demonic body parts

assembled into a truly vile whole.

A demonflesh golem bears a superficial resemblance to a

flesh golem. Its overall form is humanoid, with the addition

of a pair of membranous wings and a long, thin tail. Its left

arm is muscular and sinewy, with a large, clawed hand,

while its right arm is more slender and ends in a heavy, bony

hand. Its right leg is long and agile, while its left is thicker

and heavier. Despite having a pronounced limp, the creature

moves quickly and can climb and jump with remarkable

ease. One eye is bright red and has a black iris, while the

other is yellow with no visible iris, but it has a pupil shaped

like a cats.

Unlike most golems, a demonflesh golem is reasonably

intelligent, and it speaks and understands Abyssal.

Combat

A demonflesh golem attacks in a whirling fury. Its left,

clawed arm seems to attack of its own volition, and its tail

lashes wildly from side to side during combat.

Claw Graft (Ex): A demonflesh golems left arm can

attack independently of the golems control. This allows a

golem to make a second attack each round. This means the

golem can attack with its slam, then move, and then attack

with its claw, all in a single round (but it cannot attack twice

with its claw). The clawed arm has a Strength score of 35,

attacks at the golems full base attack bonus (plus its higher

Strength bonus), and gains its full Strength bonus on

damage rolls.

Fear Gaze (Su): Anyone within 30 feet of a demonflesh

golem who meets its eyes must succeed on a Will saving

throw (DC 19) or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds.

Demonflesh golems are immune to their own gaze at-

tacks and to those of others of

their kind.

tail burn fiercely, causing the

creature struck to be dazed

Fortitude save (DC 11).

tor (such as chaos hammer or

its construct traits make it im-

mune to the spells effects (it

cannot be blinded by a holy

aura, for example, because that

effect allows a Fortitude save).

As an extraplanar creature,

a demonflesh golem on the

Material Plane can be driven

back  to  its  home  plane  by  a

(as well as by holy word or

Construction

A demonflesh golem can be constructed only in the Abyss

or on another chaotic infernal plane (in the D&D cosmol-

ogy, this would include Pandemonium and Carceri; see

Manual of the Planes). Assembly requires access to a variety

of demon bodies and fiendish grafts (see Appendix 3),

specifically including a claw fiendish arm, a fast fiendish

leg, a fear fiendish eye, membranous fiendish wings, and a

whip fiendish tail.

The golem costs 130,000 gp to create, which includes 1,000

gp for the construction of the body. Assembling the body

requires a Heal check (DC 15) and a Knowledge (the planes)

check (DC 20).

The creator must be 18th level and able to cast both

arcane and divine spells. Completing the ritual drains 3,000

XP  from  the  creator  and  requires  darkness,  destruction,

geas/quest, horrid wilting, planar binding, poison, unholy aura,

and unholy blight.

A hellfire golem is a construct from the infernal planes that

is crafted by devils for sheer destructive and pyromaniac

delight. It appears as a towering humanoid creature that seems

to be formed of brilliant lava covered with a crumbling black

crust. Flames leap out from the cracks in its crusty skin and

wreathe its body in infernal fire.

Unlike most golems, a hellfire golem is reasonably intelli-

gent, and it speaks and understands Infernal.

Combat

Hellfire golems are not mindless, but neither are they

subtle. Their magical abilities involve burning things up,

and their physical abilities lend themselves well to the

same approach.

Hellfire (Ex): A hellfire golem burns with unearthly fire.

Those hit by a hellfire golems slam attack take 2d6 points of

hellfire damage. Half of this damage is fire damage, while

the other half results directly from unholy power and is

therefore not lessened by protection against fire.

Creatures hitting a hellfire golem with natural weapons

or unarmed attacks take hellfire damage as though hit by

the golems slam attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willburning hands, fireball, flare,

produce flame; 3/dayflame strike. Caster level 20th; save DC

12 + spell level.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): A hellfire golem is immune

to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects,

except as follows. A quench spell seems to extinguish the

flames, suffusing the golems frame for 2d4 rounds, but it

actually only halves the damage from its hellfire (negating

the fire damage). A cold effect that deals more than 20

points of damage (after overcoming its cold resistance)

slows it (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving

throw. A spell with the lawful or evil descriptor (such as

orders wrath or unholy blight) breaks any slow effect on the

golem and cures 1 point of damage for each 3 points of

damage  it  would  otherwise  deal. The  golem  is  fully

affected by spells with the chaotic or good descriptor,

unless its construct traits make it immune to the spells

effects (it cannot be blinded by a holy aura, for example,

because that effect allows a Fortitude save).

As an extraplanar creature, a hellfire golem on the Mater-

ial Plane can be driven back to its home plane by a dispel evil

or dispel law spell (as well as by holy word or word of chaos), but

it is not affected by banishment or dismissal since they are not

A hellfire golem can be constructed only on the Nine Hells

of Baator or another lawful infernal plane (in the D&D cos-

mology, this would include Acheron and Gehenna; see

Manual of the Planes). The body is formed from special clays

found only on such planes, and it is suffused with unholy

energy from its plane of creation.

The golem costs 125,000 gp to create, which includes

2,000 gp for the construction of the body. Assembling the

body requires a Craft (sculpting) check (DC 20).

The magical nature of fey allows

them to crossbreed with virtu-

ally any other creature. The off-

spring of the resulting unions,

half-fey, are enigmatic and free-

spirited beings.

Fey are deeply curious about other

creatures, spending a great deal

of time watching their behavior.

Sometimes they have dalliances with a

nonfey, often forgetting that there are

consequences for their actions. The progeny from these

moments of passion are either completely ignored by the

fey parent or utterly embraced, with the parent teaching it

secrets that only the fey can know.

Half-fey centaur

Half-fey vary wildly in their appearance, and no two are

exactly alike. Half-fey can either be beautiful and comely,

with exaggerated and chiseled features, or misshapen and

troll-like. Sometimes it is apparent from birth that a child is

not normal, but other times it takes several years for odd

features to emerge.

Regardless of what form they take, half-fey are always

charismatic and intriguing to gaze upon. They always have

at least one or more distinctive attribute, such as wings,

jeweled or knotty skin, or hair made of flowers.

Half-fey never truly fit into any mortal society, being con-

sidered alien and strange beyond compare. Because of their

ability to charm and lay curses, some half-fey are persecuted

by superstitious populations. However, half-fey are usually

accepted to some degree among fey, who look past superfi-

cial aspects such as appearance.

Good half-fey are usually devoted, if capricious, defenders

of the wilderness and do their best to keep it unspoiled. Evil

half-fey are malicious, petty, vindictive, and sadistic, delight-

ing in the chaos and mayhem that they can cause.

The sample half-fey described here uses a centaur as the

base creature. Half-fey centaurs often lead other groups

of fey or centaurs against incursions by evil beings into

forested areas.

THE HALF-FEY

TEMPLATE

Half-fey is an inherited tem-

plate that can be added to any

corporeal living creature (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). The creatures type changes to

fey. It uses all the base creatures statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Hit Dice: Change to d6.

Speed: All half-fey have butterflylike wings unless the

base creature has wings already. A half-fey that did not

89

already have wings gains a fly speed equal to twice the

base creatures fastest mode of movement, with good

maneuverability.

Special Attacks: A half-fey with Wisdom or Charisma of

8 or higher (after the ability score adjustments noted below)

gains spell-like abilities, using its Hit Dice as its caster level.

The table below lists the abilities available. These abilities

are cumulative; a half-fey with 3 HD can use the abilities on

the 12 HD row on the table as well as those on the 34 HD

row. When a half-fey gets a choice between two abilities

(such as faerie fire or glitterdust at 12 HD), it can choose

anew between these abilities each day.

Half-illithid lizardfolk, called tzakandi in the illithid lan-

guage, are used as slave laborers and personal guards in

some illithid communities. Their appearance contains

aspects of both the illithid and the host; no two of them look

exactly the same.

HALF-FEY CHARACTERS

Half-fey characters often have a character class, favoring

rogues, bard, druids, rangers, and sorcerers. Half-fey clerics

are exceedingly rare.

Half-illithid lizardfolk are prized among their illithid

masters for their vicious ferocity. Intelligent enough to

put their psionic powers to best use, tzakandi generally

work in pairs, one member using its mind blast on enemy

pqqqqrs

COMBAT

morphological transformations complete the maturation process of

an adult illithid.

HOW ILLITHIDS MAKE MORE

The  mind  flayer  life  cycle  is  a  closely  guarded  secret  that  few  non-

illithids  have  become  privy  to.  Illithids  begin  their  lives  as  tiny

tadpoles in a briny pool. To reach maturity, the tadpole undergoes a

transformative  process  called  ceremorphosis.  The  process  begins

when  a  tadpole  is  inserted  into  the  brain  case  of  a  host  human

(usually  via  the  ear  canal).  The  tadpole  burrows  into  its  victims

brain, quickly consuming much of the gray matter and replacing the

consumed  brain  with  its  own  squalid  tissue.  In  effect,  the  tadpole

melds with the uneaten lower brain stem of the victim, wiping out all

remnants of the personality and spirit of the host, while leaving the

physical body alive and ready for habitation. Within days, additional

pqqqqrs

Humans are almost always used as hosts for tadpole implanta-

tion, because they are the only race that produces true illithids. The

process  also  works  on  other  kinds  of  humanoids,  but  it  yields  a

half-illithid rather than an actual mind flayer. As in the case of the

half-illithid lizardfolk described here, these creatures are all formi-

dable in combat because they gain many of the parent mind flayers

special attacks.

Ceremorphosis completely replaces the original tissue of the victim

with illithid tissue; when the transformation is complete, the original

victim is dead, and no spell or power can reverse the process.

Extract (Ex): A half-illithid that successfully maintains

its hold with all four tentacles for 1 full round automatically

extracts that opponents brain at the beginning of its next

turn, instantly killing the creature.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a half-illithid hits an opponent

that is its own size or smaller with a tentacle attack, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple (grapple

bonus +2) as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If it gets a hold, it attaches the tentacle to the

opponents head. After a successful grab, the half-illithid can

try to attach its remaining tentacles with a single grapple

check. The opponent can escape with a single successful

grapple check or Escape Artist check, but the half-illithid

gets a +2 circumstance bonus for every tentacle that was

attached at the beginning of the opponents turn.

Mind Blast (Sp): This attack, usable once per day, is a 40-

foot cone. Anyone caught in this cone must succeed on a

Will save (DC 13 + half-illithid lizardfolks Int modifier) or

be stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Psionics (Sp): 3/daydetect thoughts (Will save DC 15).

Hold Breath (Ex): A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a

Skills:  Thanks  to  their  tails,  half-

illithid lizardfolk have a +4 racial bonus

on Jump, Swim, and Balance checks.

stance bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the

beginning of the opponents turn.

Extract (Ex): A half-illithid that successfully maintains its

hold with all four tentacles for 1 full round automatically

extracts the opponents brain at the beginning of its next

turn, instantly killing that creature.

Psionics (Sp): A half-illithid with Intelligence or Wis-

dom of 8 or higher (after the ability score adjustments

Trolls, as a rule, breed only with those of their own kind. But

from time to time, a troll in rut finds itself without a mate.

At such times, many trolls wander into the territories of

other creatures in a nearly blind state of lust. Such trolls are

often less particular about their choice of mates, willing to

make an attempt with whatever creature they encounter.

At other times, trolls might breed with polymorphed or

otherwise magically altered spellcasters or other creatures

in disguise, hoping to cause just the sort of crossbreed such

a union inevitably produces. Some less scrupulous practi-

tioners of the arcane mysteries have, at times, taken captive

trolls and bred them forcibly with other creatures, hoping to

produce a new breed of powerful, resilient, yet easily con-

trolled minion.

A half-troll is typically much tougher than a member of

its nontroll parent race. It gains much of the trolls natural

ability to shrug off damage; its superior strength, quickness,

and hardiness; and some of the natural weaponry that makes

trolls so fearsome. Half-trolls also inevitably find that they

adopt some of their troll parents less desirable qualities as

well. Greenish skin, an elongated snout, knobby dermal

growths, and an in satiable hunger for raw flesh are only a

few of these. Half-trolls typically have longer limbs than

their  nontroll  parentsa  trait  especially  obvious  in

humanoid, giant, and monstrous humanoid half-trolls.

The sample half-troll described here uses a barbazu devil

as the base creature.

COMBAT

Half-troll barbazus are feral, unfettered by excessive reason-

ing. They simply love to tear things apart, and focus all their

abilities to that end.

Beard (Ex): If a half-troll barbazu hits a single opponent

with both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard.

The affected creature must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC

17) or be infected with the disease called devil chills (incu-

bation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Strength). Once it takes

hold, the disease deals damage each day until the victim suc-

ceeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is

cured magically, or the victim dies.

Rage (Ex): Twice per day a half-troll barbazu can fly into a

frenzy, raging like a barbarian. For 9 rounds, the half-troll bar-

bazu gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution,

and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a 2 penalty to

Armor Class. The following changes are in effect as long as

the rage lasts: HD 6d8+36 (63 hp); AC 20, touch 9, flat-footed

19; Base Attack/Grapple +6/+11; Full Attack glaive +12 melee,

or 2 claws +11 melee and bite +9 melee; Damage glaive

1d10+9 plus wounding, claw 1d4+7, bite 1d6+4, beard 1d8+7

plus disease; SV Fort +11, Will +7; Str 25, Con 23. At the end

of its rage, the half-troll barbazu is not fatigued.

Rend (Ex): If a half-troll barbazu hits with both claw

attacks, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the

flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d4+7

points of damage (2d4+9 when raging).

THE HALF-TROLL TEMPLATE

Half-troll is an inherited template that can be added to

any animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast,

monstrous humanoid, or outsider (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). The creatures type becomes giant,

and a half-troll with an outsider as the base creature also

gains the extraplanar subtype. The half-troll uses all the

base creatures statistics and special abilities except as

noted here.

AC: Natural armor improves by +4.

Damage: Half-trolls have bite and claw attacks. If the base

creature does not have these attack forms, use the appropri-

ate damage values based on the half-trolls size (see the table

below). Otherwise, use the values from the table or the base

creatures damage, whichever is greater.

Special Attacks: A half-troll retains all the special

attacks (or the base creatures number of claw attacks,

whichever is higher) and the special ability to rend.

Rend (Ex): If a half-troll hits with two or more claw attacks

against the same opponent, it latches onto the opponents

body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an

additional amount of damage based on the half-trolls size

(see the table below). A half-troll adds 1 1/2 times its

Strength modifier to this base rend damage.

Special Qualities: A half-troll has all the special qualities

fast healing 5, and scent.

Fast Healing (Ex): A half-troll heals 5 points of damage each

round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. Fast healing does

not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffoca-

tion, and it does not allow a half-troll to regrow or reattach

lost body parts.

Half-troll barbazu

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, charm person,

command, desecrate, magic weapon, major image, produce flame,

suggestion. A half-troll barbazu can induce fear by touch, as

the spell, except it affects only the creature touched. Caster

level 8th; save DC 9 + spell level. A half-troll barbazu can use

teleport without error (self plus maximum load of objects only)

at will. Caster level 12th.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, a half-troll barbazu

can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures with a 50% chance of

success (result of 51100 on d%), or 1 barbazu with a 35%

chance of success (result of 66100 on d%).

Wound (Su): A hit from a half-troll barbazus glaive

causes a bleeding wound. The injured creature loses 2

additional hit points each round until the wound is bound

(requiring a Heal check against DC 10) or the creature

dies. This is an innate ability of barbazu, not a feature of

the weapon.

Fast Healing (Ex): A half-troll barbazu regains lost hit

points at the rate of 5 per round so long as it has at least 1 hit

point. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from star-

vation, thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow a half-troll

barbazu to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

See in Darkness (Su): A half-troll barbazu sees per-

fectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by deeper

darkness spells.

Scent (Ex): A half-troll can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Abilities: Adjust from the base creature as follows: Str +6,

Dex +2, Con +6, Int 2, Cha 2.

Skills: A half-troll has skill points equal to (2 + its Int

modifier, minimum 1)  (its Hit Dice + 3). Treat skills pos-

sessed by the base creature as class skills and other skills as

cross-class. If the creature has a class, it gains skill points for

class levels normally.

Feats: Half-trolls gain feats normally. They tend to favor

feats that take advantage of their strength, such as Power

Attack and Cleave, or feats that offset their natural weak-

nesses, such as Iron Will.

Climate/Terrain: Same as base creature or any land,

aquatic, and underground.

Organization: Same as base creature or solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Alignment: Usually chaotic neutral or chaotic evil.

Level Adjustment: +4.

HALF-SCRAG

Scrags, or aquatic trolls, often suffer the same urges or are the

subject of the same experiments as their landbound relatives.

Half-scrags have the same adjustments as those detailed above

for half-trolls, but with the following additional changes:

A half-scrags land speed is reduced by 5 feet, and it has a

swim speed of 20 feet. Its fast healing ability works only if it

is immersed in water.

COMBAT

A huecuva attacks with the savagery of a beast that has been

consumed with loathing of the living.

Huecuva Blight (Su): Victims hit by a huecuvas slam

attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or fall prey

to the disease called huecuva blight. The incubation period

is 1 day; at the end of that time, the disease deals 1d2 points

of Strength and Constitution damage. An infected victim

must make a saving throw each day thereafter or take

another 1d2 points of Strength and Constitution damage.

The effects of huecuva blight are cumulative each day until

the victim reaches 0 Constitution (and dies), makes two con-

secutive successful saves, or receives magical treatment

(such as a remove disease spell).

Rebuke Undead (Su): This huecuva (formerly a cleric)

can make undead cower by channeling negative energy.

Spells: This huecuva can cast divine spells as a 5th-level

cleric (5/5/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level). A typical spell list:

0cure minor wounds, detect magic, guidance, resistance, virtue;

1stbane, bless, cause fear*, random action, sanctuary; 2nd

bulls strength, desecrate*, hold person, spiritual weapon; 3rd

animate dead*, bestow curse, invisibility purge.

Domain spell. Domains: Death (death touch 1/day), Evil

(cast evil spells at +1 caster level).

Turn Resistance (Ex): A huecuva is treated as an undead

with 2 more Hit Dice than it actually has for the purposes of

turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A huecuva is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically affect

undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless

it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical hits, sub-

dual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death from

massive damage. A huecuva cannot be raised, and resurrec-

tion works only if it is willing. A huecuva has darkvision (60-

foot range).

Possessions: Full plate armor, large steel shield, masterwork

morningstar, light crossbow and 10 bolts, 5 scrolls of inflict

light wounds, potion of blur, potion of levitate, potion of fly, cloak

of resistance +1.

THE HUECUVA TEMPLATE

Huecuvas are undead creatures created from clerics,

druids, paladins, or monks who have failed in their vows.

As punishment for their heresies, they are doomed to

undeath. Huecuvas are sometimes created when a good or

A

H

neutral cleric changes his alignment to evil and dies with-

out seeking atonement for his wrongs, or when an evil

priest is subjected to a particularly powerful curse by her

patron deity.

Huecuvas retain dim memories of their old lives and

often dwell in desecrated shrines and broken temples that

mock their former orders. They hate all living things, but

they especially loathe good-aligned priests.

Huecuvas appear as humanoid skeletons

wrapped in tarnished, corroded, or tat-

tered vestments.

CREATING A HUECUVA

Huecuva is an acquired template that

can be added to any humanoid (here-

after referred to

as the base crea-

ture) with at least

one  level  in  the

cleric, druid, pal-

adin, or monk class. The creatures

type changes to undead. Unlike lich-

dom, which preserves the intellect and

powers of the base creature, the trans-

formation to a huecuva exacts a terrible

toll on the victims mind, reduc-

ing its Intelligence to barely

sentient levels.  The hue-

cuva uses all the base creatures statistics

and special abilities except as noted here.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

AC: The base creatures natural armor increases by +4.

Huecuvas often wear the armor they wore in lifeespe-

cially armor intended for ceremonial purposes.

Attacks and Damage: A huecuva retains all the attacks

of the base creature and also gains a slam attack if the base

creature does not have one. If the base creature does not

have a slam attack, use the appropriate value based on the

huecuvas size (see the table below) but only humanoids

are eligible. A base creature with natural attacks uses the

value from the table below or the base creatures damage,

whichever is greater.

Special Attacks: A huecuva retains all the special

attacks of the base creature. In addition, huecuvas expose

any victims hit with a natural attack to a deadly disease

known as huecuva blight.

Huecuva Blight (Su): Victims hit by a huecuvas slam

attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or fall

prey to the disease called huecuva blight. The incubation

period is 1 day; at the end of that time, the disease deals

1d2 points of Strength and Constitution damage. An

infected victim must make a saving throw each day there-

after or take another 1d2 points of Strength and Consti-

tution damage. The effects of huecuva blight

are cumulative each day until the victim

reaches 0 Constitution (and dies), makes

two consecutive successful

saves, or receives magical

treatment (such as a re-

move disease spell).

Special Qualities:

Huecuvas  retain  all

the special qualities of

the  base  creature  and

gain the following ad-

ditional qualities.

Turn Resistance

(Ex): A huecuva is

treated as an un-

dead  with  2

more Hit Dice

than it actually has for

the purposes of turn, rebuke, com-

mand, or bolster attempts.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A huecuva has damage

BS

Huecuva

reduction 15/silver.

Divine Conversion: A cleric who becomes a huecuva

loses access to the domains he had in life and replaces

them with the Death and Evil domains. A cleric who pre-

viously was able to turn undead loses that ability and

gains the ability to rebuke or command undead, like

other evil clerics.

A paladin who becomes a huecuva gains special abilities

much like a fallen paladin who becomes a blackguard. See

the information on fallen paladin blackguard abilities in

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide to determine the huecuvas spe-

cial abilities.

Abilities: Change from the base creature as follows: Str

+2, Int 6, Wis +2, Cha +2. As undead creatures, huecuvas

have no Constitution score.

Feats: Huecuvas gain Toughness as a bonus feat.

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary or gang (212).

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

Treasure: Standard.

Alignment: Always evil (any).

With a distinctive preference for the dark places of the

land, the hullathoin is most commonly encountered

underground. Remote mountain passes, dark bogs, and

ancient  forests  also  serve  as  suitable  homes  for  this

undead monstrosity.

Standing 20 feet high at the shoulder, a hullathoin walks

on four long, powerful legs. It has a skeletal head with a

massive maw. The most distinctive aspect of a hullathoin is

that its mottled gray and black body seems to carry some

sort of wasting illness. Angry, red, pus-filled sores that pulse

and weep cover its flesh. Buzzing insects surround the crea-

ture at all times and feast off its rotting body.

A hullathoin is nearly always accompanied by a ragtag

mob of assorted undead creatures. Since the swarm it car-

ries in its body is capable of creating fresh vampire spawn,

these are the most common kind of undead in its retinue,

but because it can command undead, mummies, ghasts,

ghouls, zombies, or even mohrgs or spectres might be

found in its company.

Hullathoins speak Common and, curiously, Draconic.

COMBAT

A hullathoin has an impressive level of control over its

body. By contracting the muscles around its many weep-

ing sores, a hullathoin irritates the bloodfiend locusts

inside its body, causing a swarm to rush forth and attack

any living thing within range. A hullathoin

also likes to snag opponents with the two tentacles that

sprout from its shoulders and twist their flesh into obscene,

fantastic shapes. Nothing pleases the creature more than

totally deforming some victim, then leaving it to the swarm

to finish so that the grotesque creature rises later as a

fiendish vampire spawn under the hullathoins control.

Deform (Su): A hullathoin can twist and deform vic-

tims grappled by its tentacles. When a hullathoin has an

opponent pinned, it can deal normal damage and attempt

to deform the creature. On a successful Fortitude save

(DC 18), the victim takes only normal grapple damage. If

the save fails, the victim also takes 1d6 points of Cha-

risma damage.

Exude Bloodfiend Swarm (Su): As a standard action, a

hullathoin can send forth a swarm of bloodfiend locusts to

attack its foes (see the description of the bloodfiend locust

swarm later in this book). Swarms of these creatures live in

the hullathoins pus-filled sores. They do not attack the hul-

lathoin or its undead minions.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a hullathoin hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +26). Thereafter, the hullathoin

has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply

use its tentacle to hold the foe (see improved grapple,

below). In either case, each successful grapple check it

makes during successive rounds automatically deals tenta-

cle damage. It can also attempt to pin its opponent. An

opponent pinned by a hullathoins tentacle can be subjected

to a hullathoins deform special attack.

Improved Grapple (Ex): Normally, a creature engaged

in a grapple that does not want to be considered grappled

must take a 20 penalty on its grapple check. But the hul-

lathoin, while grappling with its tentacles, is never con-

sidered grappled. It can conduct grapple attacks with its

tentacles normally without taking any penalties on other

attacks, and it need not take the 20 penalty on grapple

checks to be considered not grappling.

Poison (Ex): A hullathoin delivers its poison (Fort DC 19

negates) with each successful bite or tentacle attack. Initial

and secondary damage are the same (1d10 Str).

Rebuke Undead (Su): A hullathoin can rebuke or com-

mand undead as a 20th-level cleric. Any fiendish vampire

spawn created by the bloodfiend locusts it carries are auto-

matically considered commanded on rising, although

they count against the total number of Hit Dice of undead

the hullathoin can command. If newly risen undead cre-

ated by the locusts would exceed the hullathoins limit, it

can opt to leave them uncontrolled or add them to its

contingent of undead by dropping other undead followers

to compensate.

Ring of Pus (Ex): Once per day, a hullathoin can spew

forth the pus from its many sores. This ring of pus extends

30 feet in all directions from the hullathoin. Anyone

caught in the burst must make a Reflex save (DC 18) or take

5d6 points of acid damage and 1d6 points of Strength dam-

age. Success on the saving throw negates the Strength

damage and half the acid damage. Victims who fail the save

are also nauseated for 10 rounds.

Blindsight (Ex): A hullathoin maneuvers and fights not

only by sight, but also by using hearing and smell to ascer-

tain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 60 feet. A hullathoin usually

does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice crea-

tures within range of its blindsight.

Fast Healing (Ex): A hullathoin regains lost hit points

at the rate of 8 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow a hullathoin to regrow or reattach lost

body parts.

Scent (Ex): A hullathoin can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Undead Traits: A hullathoin is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. A hullathoin cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. A hullathoin has

darkvision (60-foot range).

IMP

Devils come in all shapes and sizes. Some of the smallest are

impsmischievous, diabolical miscreants that often serve

as assistants, spies, and confidants for evil spellcasters.

Most members of the race resemble the standard imp

described in the Monster Manual. Every imp has batlike

wings and twisted horns, and most have a prehensile tail

ending in a sharp point that is often tipped with a deadly

stinger. Several varieties of specialized imps exist; three of

these are described here.

COMBAT

Imps have a few traits in common, though their tactics in

combat can differ dramatically due to those abilities they

dont share.

Outsider Traits: Imps cannot be raised or resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Alternate Form (Su): An imp can assume another form

at will as a standard action. Each imp can assume one or two

forms from the following list: Small or Medium monstrous

spider, raven, rat, and boar.

Regeneration (Ex): Imps take normal damage from

acid and from holy and blessed weapons (if silver or

enchanted). Attack forms that dont deal hit point damage

Because most inhabitants of the Nine Hells cannot cast cure

spells, the devils have created other means to restore

strength in the middle of battle. Bloodbag imps, which are

preening creatures composed of little more than delicate

skin and gallons of blood, serve the Hells as an informal

nurse corps.

Corpulent human-shaped creatures with short limbs

and stubby fingers, bloodbag imps stand only 2 feet tall,

but they are almost as wide. A bloodbag imp has two pow-

erful wings, but its heavy weight for its size makes the

creature an inexpert flier. Its internal organs float inside its

98

torso, surrounded by a sea of blood contained by a weak,

semitranslucent pink epidermis.

Bloodbag imps speak Common and Infernal, though a

mouth of long, crooked teeth sometimes makes them diffi-

cult to understand.

Combat

Bloodbag imps prefer to stay out of direct hand-to-hand

combat and instead harm opponents with their wounding

curse from as safe a distance as possible.

Bloodbag imps can be summoned using a summon monster

IV spell.

Wounding Curse (Su): Three times per day, a bloodbag

imp can point at a foe within 30 feet and force that oppo-

nent to make a Fortitude save (DC 13) or suffer the effects

of its wounding curse. A creature that succeeds on its

saving throw is immune to that imps wounding curse abil-

ity for one day.

Those afflicted treat every melee injury taken within the

next hour as if that injury had been caused by a weapon

with the wounding special ability. Such wounds bleed for 1

point of damage per round thereafter (in addition to the

normal damage dealt by the melee attack). Multiple

wounds result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds

for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding

can be stopped only by a Heal check (DC 15) or the appli-

cation of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, healing

circle, and so on).

Poison (Ex): A bloodbag imp delivers its poison (Fort DC

16 negates) with each successful bite attack. Initial and sec-

ondary damage are the same (1d4 Str).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect good, detect magic,

invisibility (self only); 1/dayvampiric touch. Caster level

6th; save DC 11 + spell level.

Transfusion (Su): Any creature that drinks a bloodbag

imps blood regains 1 hit point per full round of transfu-

sion. The imp must be willing, and both the imp and the

creature receiving the transfusion can take no other

actions in that round. The imp takes 2 points of damage

during each round of transfusion, but its regeneration

ability reduces this to subdual damage, which it quickly

recovers. A bloodbag imp rendered unconscious cannot

use its transfusion ability until its hit points again exceed

its subdual damage total.

The Nine Hells are known throughout the multiverse as

a place of suffering and torment, but they are not with-

out their own corrupt delights. Shifty and feckless,

euphoric imps dispense hallucinogenic slime from their

feeble stingers.

Euphoric imps stand 2 feet tall and weigh a paltry 10

pounds. Deep circles line their bloodshot eyes, and the crea-

tures walk with an uneven, stumbling gait. The imprints of

thin bones jut out from the creatures rib cages, recalling

images of starving children. Numerous healed (and not so

healed) puncture marks mar the body of a euphoric imp, evi-

dence of the creatures preference for its own hallucinogenic

slime. The creatures serve as private alchemists and wander-

ing dealers for some of the most influential beings of the

planes of evil.

Euphoric imps speak Common, Celestial, and Infernal.

Combat

Euphoric imps love to fight, but their taste for their own hal-

lucinogenic slime makes them undependable combatants.

They prefer to cloak themselves in invisibility. Thereafter,

they sneak up to spellcasters and attempt to sting them.

Filth imps (sometimes called stinkers) hail from the Nine

Hells, but they are often found serving thieves guilds in

human cities of the Material Plane. Hated by the baatezu of

their home plane, stinkers find refuge among criminals who

respect their uncanny knack for forgery. Those who cooper-

ate with the rambunctious creatures often do so at great dis-

tance, however, because filth demons reek of the foulest

privies of the worst part of town.

Covered from head to toe in the dried ordure in which

they sleep, stinkers resemble potbellied common imps with

yellowish brown, saggy skin. A clump of stringy hair, slick

with natural oil, tops their slightly pointed, horned heads.

They lack the tails common to other imps. Filth imps stand

1 1/2 feet tall and weigh about 10 pounds.

Filth imps have a talent for codes, ciphers, and musty old

texts, and consequently make themselves useful as forgers

and translators. They have been known to intentionally mis-

translate important phrases in hopes of furthering an

agenda built upon taking pleasure in the suffering of the

cleanly races.

All filth imps speak Abyssal, Common, Draconic, and

Infernal. Individual imps often speak additional languages.

Filth imps prefer harassment and heckling to open battle.

When threatened, however, they generally turn invisible

so that they can position themselves nearest the majority

of their enemies and make liberal use of their diabolical

stench.

Filth imps can be summoned using a summon monster

IV spell.

Diabolical Stench (Su): Three times per day, a filth

imp can emit an invisible cloud of sickening gas in a 20-

foot spread. Any creatures caught within the cloud must

make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or become nauseated for

1d6 rounds. The cloud dissipates at the end of the round

in which it was released, though an unpleasant odor

lingers for as long as 1 hour thereafter. Creatures who save

successfully are immune to that imps diabolical stench

for one day.

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by a filth imps claw attack

must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or contract filth

fever. The incubation period is 1d3 days, and the disease

deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage and 1d3 points of Con-

stitution damage.

also uses its feet as potent weapons by stamp-

ing and trampling foes into jelly.

Giants that use indricotheres as mounts

employ  an  effective  variant  tactic

forcing the mount within reach of a foe,

whereupon the indricothere uses its head

butt  and  possibly  follows  up  with  a  a

knock back attempt (see below). If the

knock back is successful, both the giant

and the indricothere take advantage of the

attacks of opportunity generated as the foe

leaves both creatures threatened areas.

Knock Back (Ex): A creature hit by an

indricotheres head butt attack must succeed

on a Fortitude save (DC 29) or be knocked

back 10 feet. If the target cant be knocked

back 10 feet, it instead falls to the ground. If

the first save fails, the target must succeed on

another Fortitude save (DC 29) or be stunned for

1 round.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, an indri-

cothere can trample opponents at least one size cate-

gory smaller than itself. This attack deals 2d8+16

points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent

can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4

penalty or a Reflex save (DC 29) for half damage.

Scent (Ex): An indricothere can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

INEVITABLE

Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the

natural laws of the universe. They hunt down those that

violate certain laws that the inevitables deem inviolate.

There are several types of inevitables, each tailor-made to

handle specific missions.

Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the

native language of their first target.

COMBAT

Unless their very existence is threatened, inevitables

focus completely on the transgressor they have been

assigned to, ignoring other combatants completely. An

inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress,

but it wont tarry beyond the time when it can reengage

its quarry.

Construct Traits: An inevitable is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects.

The creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from

massive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed

through repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. An

inevitable has darkvision (60-foot range).

Indricothere

Indricotheres, although strict herbivores, are

dangerous and unpredictable creatures. Their sheer size

makes them a menace to anything else that shares their

habitat, and their ability to defoliate large stretches of green-

ery at a rapid pace can permanently alter the ecology of the

surrounding terrain.

An indricothere has twice the body mass of an elephant,

and the height of its long neck rivals that of a giraffe. An

adult indricothere stands approximately 15 feet tall at the

shoulder and 23 feet tall at the top of its head. Its thick,

gray hide resemble that of its pachyderm cousins, as do its

massive feet.

When enraged, either due to the onset of the mating

season, the desire to protect its offspring, or its war training,

an indricothere can cause great amounts of damage. Some

hill giant, ogre, and even troll tribes have been known to

domesticate the creatures and train them as mounts. The

sight of a dozen giants mounted on these imposing beasts

has caused more than one opposing army to turn tail and

flee before combat is joined.

COMBAT

A wild indricothere simply desires to stay alive in a fight.

This doesnt mean that indricotheres act in a purely

defensive manner, however. If fleeing is not an option, an

indricothere lashes out with its head and tries to knock

opponents away. Its long neck enables the creature to

pack quite a punch with its head butt. The indricothere

each round as long as it has at least 1 hit point. Fast healing

does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or

suffocation, and it does not allow the inevitable to regrow

chaotic weapons heals at the normal rate.

Quaruts are among the most powerful of

inevitables in existence. They protect

two of the most precious and

tenuous things of all: time

and space. They use their un-

canny sense of both tempo-

ral and spatial awareness to

102

know when transgressions that disrupt the timespace

continuum are taking place, and then they hunt down the

perpetrators.

A quarut appears humanoid in form, though that is

where the resemblance ends. Typical of most inevitables,

a quarut has a clockwork body, complete with gears and

pistons. Numerous small timepieces and hourglasses

function within its body. A quarut wears extremely fine

half-plate armor that is etched with various symbols

involving time. In place of a head, it has a continually

flowing hourglass. Sometimes the sand inside the hour-

glass seems to be flowing up; no quarut has ever explained

why this is so.

Quaruts are concerned about spellcasters who use such

powerful magic as limited wish, miracle, temporal stasis, time

stop, and wish. In the eyes of a quarut, the use of these spells

plays havoc with the universe and risks all beings. How-

ever, despite their displeasure with spellcasters that use

these spells and abilities, quaruts employ most of these

spells with impunity.

Varakhuts are defenders of the gods. While inevitables

themselves do not worship any entity, they understand

the necessity of these beings and know that their demise

would bring nothing but chaos to the universe. They hunt

down those that attempt to usurp the power of the gods

for themselves.

Varakhuts are abstract-looking beings roughly human-

oid in form. Their bodies are blocky and made up of intri-

cate clockwork. Small spheres resembling planets and

galaxies can sometimes be glimpsed inside their metal

framework.

Varakhuta do not act on behalf of any particular deity and

have defended the entire spectrum of pantheons, moralities,

and ethical outlooks.

Combat

Varakhut typically release their dispelling blast multiple

times to soften up a target before pummeling them with

other spells and finally their fists.

Dispelling Blast (Sp): Three times per day, as a standard

action, a varakhut can release a blast of negative energy that

acts like a greater dispelling, but it affects everything in a 30-

foot burst. Caster level 19th.

The iron cobra is a tenacious construct capable of tracking

down its victims over nearly any terrain.

An iron cobra is typically 3 feet long and weighs about

100 pounds. It looks like a cobra made out of dozens of cir-

cular iron bands, fitted together to form a snakelike body.

It is rumored that the first eight iron cobras, created ages

ago by a powerful cleric/wizard, were nearly indestructible.

Since that time, other spellcasters have taken to copying the

design, but with universally poorer results.

COMBAT

An iron cobra has no intelligence of its own, but it can be

commanded to undertake any number of actions by its cre-

ator. If its creator is not present, the cobra can undertake

simple commands (such as Guard this treasure or Seek

out and attack the king); it follows these commands to the

letter. In combat, a cobras tactics are straightforwardbite

until its victim dies.

Poison (Ex): An iron cobra delivers its poison after a

successful bite attack. An iron cobras internal poison

reservoir holds three doses of poison; refilling the reser-

voir takes 1 minute. The effect of the poison depends on

what kind of poison the cobras creator filled its poison

reservoir with; usually an iron cobra contains Medium-

size monstrous spider venom (Fort DC 14 negates, initial

and secondary damage 1d4 Str), although any injury

poison can be used.

Construct Traits: An iron cobra is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects.

The creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage,

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from

massive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed

through repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. An iron

cobra has darkvision (60-foot range).

Stalk Victim (Su): An iron cobra can be ordered by its

creator to stalk down and attack any creature whose name

is known to the creator. The iron cobra can detect this

creatures location, as if by the locate creature spell at 12th

caster level.

Construction

An  iron  cobras  body  is  con-

structed  from  100  pounds  of

iron. The creator must be at least

12th level and able to cast both

arcane and divine spells. Con-

structing an iron cobra drains

1,000 XP from the caster and

requires the spells animate object,

freedom of movement, geas/quest,

and locate creature.

An iron cobra costs 20,000 gp to

create, including 1,000

gp  for  the  body.  As-

sembling  the  body

requires a successful

Craft (armorsmithing)

An ironmaws territory is easily spotted

by a trained observer. No other wildlife

goes near its home, and the ground

is often littered with the remains of

the creatures past victims. But most

creatures never know theyre near an

ironmaw until it strikes.

An ironmaw stands 20 to 30 feet

high. It closely resembles an oak

tree, although its green leaves are cov-

ered with tiny splotches the color of

fresh blood. Its tendrils are kept wrapped

around its upper trunks when not in use,

and its mouth remains closed until it attacks.

An ironmaw tends to stay in one place for an

extended period of time. It attacks anything that comes within

range of its tendrils, even if it has recently fed. Ironmaws usu-

ally relocate only when a stand grows large enough that there

isnt enough food to support them all, at which point one or

more  of  the  creatures  will  move  to

greener pastures.

Ironmaws speak Abyssal.

COMBAT

An ironmaw attacks with its ten-

drils as soon as prey comes within

Illness (Ex): An ironmaws tendrils can sap an

opponents health. Anyone caught by a tendril

must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 22) or take 1d6

points of Constitution damage.

Tendrils (Ex): An ironmaw can attack with its four

tendrils from up to 60 feet away. Anyone struck by a ten-

dril takes damage, loses blood, may suffer illness, and risks

being drawn toward the ironmaws trunk.

Wounding (Ex): A wound resulting from an

ironmaws tendril attack bleeds for an additional 3

points of damage per round thereafter. Multiple

wounds from such attacks result in cumulative

bleeding loss (two wounds for 6 points of damage

per round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only

by a Heal check (DC 10) or the application of any cure

spell or other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

Plant Traits (Ex): An ironmaw is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

It is not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting

effects. An ironmaw also has low-light vision.

Skills: Ironmaws receive skills as though they

were fey. An ironmaw has a +8 racial bonus on

Listen and Spot checks. *In wooded areas, an ironmaw has

a +15 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Ironmaw

reach (60 feet). An ironmaw, too slow to flee

in almost any circumstance, always fights until it is slain.

Attach (Ex): If an ironmaw hits with a tendril attack, the

tendril, in addition to dealing normal damage, attaches to

the opponents body. A tendril draws a stuck opponent 10

feet closer in each subsequent round (no attack of opportu-

nity) unless the opponent breaks free, which requires an

Escape Artist check (DC 25) or a Strength check (DC 26). An

ironmaw can draw in a creature within 15 feet of itself and

bite with a +4 attack bonus in that round. An ironmaw can

draw a creature into its space and attempt to engulf it as well.

A tendril can be severed by a single attack with a slashing

weapon (made as an attempt to sunder a weapon) dealing at

least 13 points of damage.

Engulf (Ex): As a standard action, an ironmaw can attempt

to engulf a Large or smaller creature that enters its space. The

victim of the attack can make an attack of opportunity, but if

it does, it is not entitled to a saving throw. A victim that does

not attempt an attack of opportunity must make a Reflex save

(DC 15) or be engulfed; on a success, the victim is pushed

back or aside (but not freed from attached tendrils). An

engulfed creature takes 2d6+10 points of bludgeoning

damage within an ironmaws trunk each round and must

hold its breath or begin to suffocate.

Jackal lords are mysterious creatures that serve dark and

sinister gods. They are notorious for undermining legiti-

mate  organizations,  governments,  and  religious

groups and replacing them with their own pup-

pets. They are masters of subterfuge, terrorism,

blackmail and bribery.

Vain and gluttonous, jackal lords

surround themselves with rich fur-

nishings, slaves, and the finest foods.

They crave to possess what others

have and are cruel in the extreme

toward those that displease them.

A jackal lord is an attractive

if  sinister-looking  creature,

resembling a slender and wiry

humanoid with the black head

of  a  jackal.  Jackal  lords  com-

monly wear fine clothing, armor,

and  jewelry,  styling  themselves  as

regal beings that deserve worship.

Preferring to work in the shadows,

jackal lords use intimidation, bribes,

and boons to gather followers to wor-

ship their gods and do their bidding.

Most start out in isolated and backwa-

ter  communities,  where  they  can

flaunt their power with impunity,

sponsoring bandits and highway-

men to finance their organization. Some

jackal lords set up bases in large cities, where

they either pose as respected elders and busi-

nessmen of the community or live underground

and pull strings through a maze of fronts.

MC

Jackal lords speak Common and Infernal. They can also

converse with any sort of canine, including jackals, dogs,

and wolves.

COMBAT

Most jackal lords are cowards, and prefer to have their min-

ions and jackals do the fighting for them. They will typically

summon a large pack of jackals to protect them in case an

opponent gets too close.

A jackal lord will use its alternate form ability either to

attack or to blend in with a pack of jackals and slip away

from danger. Barring that, jackal lords use their scimitars,

teeth, and claws to eliminate and opponent.

Jackal lords reserve their curse of the jackal ability for

only the most powerful opponents or those they want to

make an example of. Because they can dominate jackals,

they usually try to dominate an opponent after it has been

transformed.

Alternate Form (Su): A jackal lord can assume the

form of a jackal of Medium size (use the statistics for the

wolf in the Monster Manual).

Curse of the Jackal (Su): Once per day, a jackal lord can

make a gaze attack against a single opponent within 30 feet.

If the target fails a Will save (DC 20), it is trans-

formed into a jackal (use the statistics for the dog

in the Monster Manual). The effect is as poly-

morph other, but with a permanent duration.

A jackal lord can reverse this

effect by gazing upon an indi-

vidual that was cursed by itself

or by some other jackal lord, but

doing so counts as its use of the

ability for that day. Otherwise, only

a limited wish, miracle, or wish can

restore the victim.

Dominate Animal (Su): Jackal

lords can use dominate animal (canines

only) at will as if they were 16th-

level clerics.

Spell-Like Abilities: At will

cat s grace, change self, detect magic,

detect good, suggestion; 3/dayshadow

walk. Caster level 15th; save DC 13 +

spell level.

Jackal lord

Spells: A jackal lord can cast divine

spells as an 8th-level cleric (6/6/5/5/4;

save DC 14 + spell level), from the cleric

list and from the Animal and Evil domains.

A typical spell list: 0calm animals*, cure

minor wounds (3), guidance, resistance, virtue; 1stbless, cure

light wounds, obscuring mist, random action, shield of faith;

2ndbulls  strength,  hold  animal*,  hold  person,  spiritual

weapon; 3rdblindness/deafness, invisibility purge, magic vest-

ment, magic circle against good*; 4thspell immunity, summon

monster IV, unholy blight*.

Domain spell. Domains: Animal (animal friendship

1/day), Evil (cast evil spells at +1 caster level).

Summon Jackals (Sp): Three times per day, a jackal lord

can summon up to 8 HD of jackals (use the statistics for

the dog in the Monster Manual).

JACKAL LORD SOCIETY

There is a fierce and wicked rivalry between jackal lords;

each considers the others to be the biggest threats to its exis-

tence. Many of a jackal lords Machiavellian schemes are

designed to bring down a rival lord and absorb its territory.

pqs

JACKAL LORDS AND DEITIES AND DEMIGODS

If you are using Deities and Demigods, jackal lords worship Anubis,

representing a more sinister aspect of that god. Jackal lord clerics have

access  to  the  Law,  Magic,  and  Repose  domains.  Alternatively,  jackal

lords  could  be  worshipers  of  Set,  in  which  case,  their  alignment  is

chaotic  evil.  Jackal  lord  clerics  that  worship  Set  have  access  to  the

Darkness, Evil, and Strength domains.

On extremely rare occasions, two or more jackal lords

will reconcile their differences and work together for a

common goal. Usually this goal involves establishing a

powerful temple dedicated to their deity or banding

together for an attack on a good-aligned group. These

coalitions rarely last for longer than necessary, breaking

down into backstabbing and betrayal as soon as the task

is complete.

JACKAL LORD CHARACTERS

Jackal lords favored class is cleric. Levels of cleric add to

a jackal lords ability to cast spells, so a 5th-level cleric

jackal lord casts spells as a 13th-level cleric. Many jackal

lords multiclass as rogue/clerics.

The jackalwere is a savage creature that assumes a pleas-

ing guise, lulls foes into sleep, and feasts on their freshly

killed corpses. In its natural form, a jackalwere is indis-

tinguishable from a normal jackal, though it is far bolder.

It can also take the form of a Medium-size humanoid of

any kind or a hybrid that stands erect but retains the

jackals head and fur. Jackalweres are often found in a

pack with ordinary jackals (use the statistics for the dog

in the Monster Manual).

Jackalweres speak Common and can communicate with

jackals in any form.

JACKALWERE

COMBAT

In jackal form, a jackalwere uses its bite. In hybrid form, it

uses weapons and its bite. In humanoid form, it can attack

only with weapons.

Sleep Gaze (Su): Anyone within 30 feet of a jackalwere

(in any of its forms) that meets the creatures gaze must

succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 13) or fall asleep for 5

minutes.  Jackalweres  are  immune  to  their  own  gaze

attacks and to those of others of their kind. Creatures

engaged in combat receive a +4 bonus on their

saving throws.

Alternate Form (Su): A jackalwere has

two primary forms that it can shift between at

will. One of these appears as a Small jackal,

while the other is a Medium hybrid form. The

cstatistics for these forms appear above. In

addition, a jackalwere can take the form of

any Medium humanoid.

Ages ago, a group of curious wizards sought to pierce the

boundaries of known existence and penetrate to a distant

dimension on the other side of reality. This region, known

to scholars as the Far Realm, is a realm of madness and

nightmare. The explorers felt confident of their abilities

and only intended to stay for a few hours. Unfortunately,

their confidence was misplaced. Not moments after their

arrival in the Far Realm, they were absorbed by a nameless

entity. The explorers transformed into terrible natives of

the Far Realm, becoming the first kaortis.

The explorers went mad and forgot all they knew of the

Material Plane. The gateway between the Far Realm and

the Material Plane disturbed them. The newly formed

kaortis acted without thought, traveling back through

the portal to destroy it. Doing so removed the source of

pain in the Far Realm, but it stranded the kaortis on the

Material Planea realm now deadly to the very fabric of

their being. Many of the new kaortis succumbed before

they  succeeded  in  encysting  themselves  within  the

secluded wizards school from which they had set out.

From  that  first  cyst,  the  kaortis  have  spread  out  to

menace the world.

Humanoid in shape, a kaorti must dress in form-fitting

armor made of thick resins and tissues grown and culti-

vated by kaorti alchemists whenever one ventures from its

cyst. A kaorti in a resin suit looks like an emaciated human

with elongated arms and legs. It has three long fingers and

a long thumb on each hand, and its motions are slithery

and undulant. Its bulbous head is affixed to its body by a

long neck. A kaortis face almost always remains hidden

behind windings of resin.

Outside its resin suit, a kaorti is decidedly nonhuman in

appearance. Its skin, brownish green in color swirled with

livid pinks and reds and purples, seems to be almost trans-

parent and liquid as it slithers and runs over the creatures

visible entrails. A kaortis fingers are little more than bone-

less tendrils. Its face looks like that of a melted spider. Its

palms constantly secrete a thick, green resin that can be

crafted by kaorti smiths into weapons or armor or rein-

forcements for their lairs. The average kaorti is 7 feet tall and

weighs 100 pounds.

Kaortis speak their own guttural language and have

picked up smatterings of many other languages during the

interrogation of prisoners. Most kaortis can speak Common

and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Kaortis prefer to use magic against their enemies, while

their transformed minions and thugs engage in melee.

When  magic  fails,  a  kaorti  tries  to  fight  with  ranged

weapons if it can; kaorti are proficient with all simple

ranged weapons as well as with shuriken. A kaorti caught in

melee combat usually flees in an attempt to regain the

needed distance for its spells and ranged attacks.

Kaorti can be summoned using a summon monster II spell.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayadisguise  self,  color  spray,

feather fall, ray of enfeeblement, reduce, spider climb. Caster level

2nd; save DC 14 + spell level.

Vile Transformation (Su): A kaorti can infuse any

living creature with otherworldly essence from the Far

Realm, permanently transforming the target into a mock-

ery of its previous form. This process takes 8 hours, during

KAORTIS AND MANUAL OF THE PLANES

If  you  are  using  Manual  of  the  Planes  in  your  campaign  and  have

adopted the Far Realm into your campaigns cosmology, kaorti thralls

should make use of the pseudonatural creature template instead of the

fiendish template. Many kaorti arcane spellcasters choose the alienist

prestige class described in Tome and Blood; since a kaorti is already an

outsider, a kaorti alienist who reaches 10th level transcends by gaining

the pseudonatural creature template.

which time the kaortis jaws must be locked onto the victim,

who must be either willing or helpless for the duration.

After 8 hours, the victim must make a Fortitude save (DC

11). Failure indicates that the victim transforms into a

kaorti (if the victim was a humanoid), or into a kaorti thrall.

If the victim succeeds at the save, the kaorti can attempt the

transformation again; each additional attempt to transform

a victim increases the save DC by +1.

Creatures transformed into kaortis retain any class abil-

ities and modify their ability scores as follows: Str 4, Dex

+4, Int +4, Cha +6. They become neutral evil and embrace

the racial ethos of the kaortis. They gain all of the other

abilities and disadvantages of a standard kaorti. This

transformation is the only way the kaorti can propagate

their kind.

A  victim  transformed  into  a  kaorti  thrall  gains  the

fiendish creature template, except that instead of gaining

the smite good special attack, it gains the ability to cast true

strike on itself once per day.

Material Vulnerability (Ex): The Material Plane is

painful to an unprotected kaorti. An unprotected kaorti

must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per pre-

vious check) or take 1d6 points of subdual damage and

become fatigued. The fatigued condition persists until the

kaorti recovers all the subdual damage it took from its

exposure to the Material Plane. If a kaorti is rendered

unconscious through the accumulation of subdual damage

(from this ability or from any other source), the Material

Plane environs begin to deal normal damage at the same

rate (Fort save negates; save DC continues to increase per

check as stated above). A kaorti wearing a resin suit, or a

kaorti inside a cyst, is protected from the effects of the

Material Plane.

Outsider Traits: Kaortis have darkvision (60-foot range),

and they cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or

miracle spell can restore life).

Skills: Kaortis have a +8 racial bonus on Heal checks.

KAORTI SOCIETY

Kaortis live in remote regions, dwelling in captured forts,

monasteries, or mines. They quickly coat the entirety of

their lairs with the same resin they build their weapons and

armor from, protecting themselves from the deleterious

influence of the Material Plane. These lairs are known as

kaorti cysts.

Kaortis have little interest in idle pastimes. They are

consumed with one overriding goal: to pervert the natural

world and feed it into the Far Realm. The kaortis under-

stand that realization of this goal is likely centuries away,

and may well be impossible. Nevertheless, they are dedi-

cated to this goal, transforming one creature at a time if

thats what it takes.

Kaorti greatly respect and admire arcane magic. Sorcer-

ers and wizards are often found as leaders in kaorti cysts.

These leaders are charged with expanding the races terri-

tories and making sure the cyst is well defended. This

leaves the bulk of a kaorti cysts population free to work

on the transformation of creatures into kaorti or thralls.

Nonhumanoid victims that are transformed into thralls

make up the bulk of a kaorti cysts defenses.

When a cysts population reaches about five dozen kaor-

tis, approximately two dozen of them strike out into the

world to seek a place to build a new cyst. A few old cysts

have ceased to calve off pilgrimages; the kaortis of these

cysts work to perfect new thrall races designed to function

on the Material Plane without danger. The skybleeder and

the rukanyr (both described later in this book) are perhaps

the most successful of these creations so far.

Prisoners taken by kaortis are fed and made comfort-

able by their captors, but only as long as the kaortis think

that their captives have vital information about the outer

world to impart. Once a prisoner is deemed to have

divulged all pertinent information, he is quickly sched-

uled for transformation.

Kaortis encountered outside a cyst are either pilgrims

looking for a new cyst site, spies gathering

information about the neighboring lands, or a

small band charged with seeking out new vic-

tims for transformation. Kaortis make full

use of their alter self ability to infiltrate villages

and cities.

KAORTI ITEMS

Kaorti devices are made from resins

secreted by the creatures palms.

The resin is shaped while fresh,

and then (if appropriate) alchem-

ically treated to maintain its

flexibility.

The  principal  use  for

kaorti resin is to create a

cyst, a space enclosed by

walls of resin. Within such

a space, kaortis are protected

from the harmful effects of

the Material Plane. A kaorti

can produce roughly 1 cubic

foot of resin each day, enough

to coat 10 square feet of surface to a

depth of 1 inch. It takes a kaorti about 1 hour to

produce and apply this much resin. The sub-

stance dries to a rigid covering 1 hour after

being applied. Walls and doors encrusted

with this resin have their hardness increased

by 2.

Untreated kaorti resin lasts for only

about 500 days before crumbling to shards, so

kaortis constantly maintain the walls of their cysts. A

single kaorti can keep a 40-foot-square room 10 feet high

110

covered in resin by spending 1 hour a day maintaining

its cyst.

Resin Suit: A kaorti resin suit consists of thin straps of

alchemically treated resin that are wrapped around the

body fully, similar to a mummys bandages. A resin suit is

light armor with the following properties: +4 armor bonus,

+3 maximum Dex bonus, 4 armor check penalty, 25%

arcane spell failure chance. Creatures other than kaortis

can wear resin suits, but the resin causes most humanoids

to break out in hives. In addition to its armor qualities, a

kaorti resin suit protects a creature on the Material Plane

from the effects of the environment.

Resin suits are costly and time-consuming to make; ordi-

nary kaorti (those with 1 HD) are only rarely allowed to use

them as a result.

Cost: 250 gp. Weight: 20 lb.

Ribbon Dagger: A ribbon dagger is a Small exotic

weapon crafted from alchemically treated kaorti resin. It

consists of a resin handle to which is affixed a 1-foot-long

flexible strip of resin. This ribbon of resin is razor-sharp and

deals 1d4 points of damage on a hit with a critical

multiplier of 4. The ribbon can wrap around

objects with ease; disarm attacks made with a

ribbon dagger gain a +2 bonus.

Cost: 50 gp. Weight: 1 lb.

KAORTI CHARACTERS

A small number of kaortis turn rogue and aban-

don their native cysts. These characters have

resisted the psychological transformation

into kaorti, and struggle to survive in a

hostile world.

Kaortis have a natural predisposi-

tion to become sorcerers. Kaorti sor-

cerers generally become the leaders

of a kaorti cyst. Kaorti wizards do

not keep ordinary spellbooks;

they record their spells on long

strips of resin that are hung from

the ceiling in the kaortis lair.

Kaorti  wizards  or  sorcerers

never summon animal famil-

iars. Most nonspellcasting kaor-

tis are rogues, although fighter

kaortis are not unheard of. Kaor-

tis only rarely become bar-

barians, and no instance of a

divine spellcaster kaorti has

been recorded.

Sorcerer is a kaortis favored class.

Because of its special abilities, a kaorti

PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal

to its class level + 4. Thus, a 1st-level kaorti

sorcerer has an ECL of 5 and is the equiva-

lent of a 5th-level character.

Most sages believe that keepers

were someones attempt to create a race of constructs that

would act as spies or guardians of some secret knowledge.

At some point the process went awry, and keepers began

to be born as free-willed living beings. Now they roam the

planes, driven to discover the secrets of others and make

certain that no one else can learn them.

A keeper looks human or half-elven at first glance, but a

close  examination  reveals  that  its  bald,  pale-skinned,

humanoid form moves oddly; all its joints are capable of

bending in any direction. Adding to their alien appearance,

keepers all look remarkably similar; each wears a dark

leather coat that serves as armor and black goggles to dis-

guise the fact that the creatures have no eyes.

Keepers are driven to discover things that others do

not want known. They are insatiably curious, but prefer

to observe the knowledge they seek rather than interact

with the creatures that have it. Once they have learned

what they think they can from a creature, keepers often

attempt to silence that creature so that others cannot

learn what it knows. Despite these draconian tactics,

keepers can be bargained with and will hold to the letter

of any deal made. Such bargains usually involve simply

buying off the keepers with knowledge rather than an

exchange of information: No keeper willingly parts with

its secrets.

Keepers have a disturbing and abrupt manner, find-

ing the subtleties of the cultures of other creatures

chaotic and difficult to understand. Keepers seem too

intense and driven to most creatures and are often

unsettling to others even when they are trying to

be diplomatic.

Keepers rarely speak, since they can commu-

nicate with each other telepathically, but

they can converse in Common, Celestial,

COMBAT

Although highly intelligent, keep-

ers  tend  to  be  poor  innovators.

When  they  discover  a  tactic

that works, they often rely on

it  slavishly  until  it  proves

ineffective on multiple occa-

sions. Thus, keeper attacks

often come in waves. Keepers

often test a strategy by send-

ing a single keeper or a small

team to attack. Other keepers

remain  hidden  nearby,  ob-

serving through their breth-

ren  the  tactics  and  weak-

nesses of the foe. If the foe

proves too strong for the test-

ing team to overcome, fresh

keepers use their body switch

ability to teleport in and attempt to further wear down

the foe. If this tactic fails to defeat the enemy, more fresh

keepers take their place and then flee to formulate a new

plan of attack.

Mimic Weapon (Ex): A keeper can form the malleable

flesh and bone of its arms into any melee weapon (even an

exotic weapon) it has witnessed in use and then wield the

weapon with proficiency. It can form either arm into any

melee weapon of up to Medium-size. It must fuse and form

both its arms to mimic a weapon of Large size or a double

weapon. A keeper cannot use its arms to create melee

weapons of a size larger than it could normally wield. A

mimicked weapon has all the properties of a standard

weapon of that type.

A keeper s attacks with its mimicked weapons are

treated as natural attacks; thus, keepers do not incur the

normal penalties for fighting with two weapons, cannot

be disarmed, and do not gain iterative attacks with their

mimicked weapons. Keepers are capable of wielding

normal weapons, even ranged weapons, but they rarely

do so.

Poison Spit (Ex): Once every 1d4 rounds, a keeper can

spit a nauseating contact poison in a 20-foot cone (see the

sidebar for statistics).

Blindsight (Ex): A keeper is blind, but it maneu-

vers and fights as well as a sighted creature by

using sonar, like that of a bat. This ability

enables it to discern objects and creatures

within 200 feet. A keeper usually does

not need to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight. A silence spell

negates this ability.

Body Switch (Su): A keepers

hive mind and its unique mental

link to other keepers grants it a

supernatural ability to exchange

places with any other living

keeper within 500 feet. As a

standard action, a keeper

can  use  teleport  without

error to reach the exact

location of another keeper,

instantaneously teleporting the

other  keeper  away  and  effectively

switching positions with that keeper. A keeper may use

this ability to switch places with an unconscious, dying, or

otherwise helpless keeper. Keepers often use this ability to

surprise opponents or to harry foes that have sealed them-

selves off from the attacks of the other keepers.

Dissolution (Ex): When a keeper is captured, pinned, or

held helpless, it has 10 rounds to free itself or be freed by

another creature. If it is not freed before that time, it dis-

solves into a 5-foot-wide puddle of the same contact poison

the keepers spit. The puddle and any poison taken from it

evaporate in 4 roundsexcept that a Craft (poisonmaking)

check (DC 20) made during that time will preserve enough

poison from the puddle for one dose of keeper poison (see

the sidebar for statistics).

A keeper that dies also dissolves into a puddle of poison.

Any creature that touches the keeper as it dissolves (such as

with a natural attack that dealt the death blow) or that

touches a puddle of poison before it evaporates must make

Fortitude saving throws to avoid the poisons effects.

Hive Mind (Ex): All keepers within 500 feet of each

other are in constant communication. If one is aware of a

particular danger, they all are. If one in the group is not

flat-footed, none of them are. No keeper within range is

considered flanked unless all are.

Immunities (Ex): Keepers have an alien physiology and

incomprehensible minds that make them more like con-

structs than living creatures. A keeper is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects.

They are not subject to critical hits, sneak attacks, subdual

damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death

from massive damage.

Outsider Traits: Keepers  have  darkvision  (60-foot

range), and they cannot be raised or resur-

rected (though a wish or miracle spell can

restore life).

Resistances (Ex): A keeper has acid,

cold, fire, electricity, and sonic resist-

ance 10.

Scent (Ex): A keeper can detect

approaching  enemies,  sniff  out

hidden foes, and track by sense of

smell.

Skills: Keepers have a +8 racial

bonus on Climb checks and can

always  choose  to  take  10  on

Climb checks, even if rushed or

threatened. In addition, their strange

and malleable physiology grants keepers a +8 racial bonus

on Jump and Escape Artist checks. *Keepers are not lim-

ited by their height when determining the distance they

can jump.

KEEPER CHARACTERS

A keepers favored class is rogue. A keeper PCs effective

character level (ECL) is its class level + 7. For example, a 1st-

level keeper rogue has an ECL of 8 and is the equivalent of

an 8th-level character.

Kelp anglers are reef assassins. They

lurk in shadowy shoals, coral growths, and

kelp beds, waiting for fresh prey to wander

their way. With a knack for finding shipping

lanes and commonly used coastal waters, they

quickly become a menace to any other creatures

in the vicinity of an anglers territory.

A kelp angler resembles a large tangle of kelp shaped

roughly like a jellyfish, 9 feet long and 4 to 5 feet in diam-

eter. Its coloration varies depending on the natural colors

of its surroundings.

A kelp angler stakes out an area for days at a time and

patiently waits for large prey to present itself. By staying

in one area, the creature can remain near a large kelp

patch or a reef without driving away smaller denizens,

which preserves the illusion of safety in the area.

COMBAT

A kelp anglers natural appearance ensures that one is

rarely spotted until it attacks. It often begins a fight by

using its confusion ability on one opponent before moving

in to grapple others. Kelp anglers know something of

magic and have evolved the ability to dispel spells with

some proficiency. Once a target is grappled, a kelp angler

typically triggers its dispel magic effect to remove magical

protection  (such  as  water  breathing) from  the  victim,

thereby subjecting it to the effects of being underwater

and possibly the threat of drowning.

Kelp anglers can be summoned using a summon natures

ally VII spell.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a kelp angler hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

tendril attack, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +16).

Thereafter, the kelp angler has the option to con-

duct the grapple normally, or simply

use its tendril to hold the op-

ponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the kelp angler is

not considered grappled). In

either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals

Kelp angler

tendril damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A

kelp angler is not blind,

but it maneuvers and fights

as well as a sighted creature by using

sonar, like that of a bat. This abil-

ity enables it to discern objects

and creatures within 100 feet. A

kelp angler usually does not

need to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range of

its blindsight. A silence spell negates

this ability and forces the kelp angler to rely

on its vision (which is as good as a humans).

Camouflage (Ex): A kelp angler can change its coloring

to match its environment, gaining a +10 competence bonus

on Hide checks.

Immunities (Ex): A kelp angler is immune to cold

damage and bludgeoning damage.

Plant Traits (Ex): A kelp angler is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature

also has low-light vision.

Regeneration (Ex): Acid attacks deal normal damage

to a kelp angler. Attack forms that dont deal hit point

damage ignore regeneration, and a kelp angler does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffoca-

tion.

Skills: Due to their stealthy nature, kelp anglers have a +6

racial bonus on Move Silently checks. Kelp anglers have a

+8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard and can always choose to take 10 on

Swim checks, even if distracted or endangered.

Not all fey are shy and reclusive nature spirits. Kelpies are

bloodthirsty and evil fey that thrive on mayhem and

murder. They live in rivers, lakes, pools, and other bodies

of water where they can drown their prey before devour-

ing the corpses.

In its natural form, a kelpie looks like a large warhorse

with coal-black eyes. Its body constantly drips water and

is covered in bits of rotted vegetation. A kelpie exudes an

odor of death and decay. Horses get agitated and nervous

when they are within a kelpies territory.

A kelpie can assume the form of a human. Even in this

form, a kelpie retains a feral and disturbing aura about it,

with long stringy hair, darting eyes, and a gruff voice. The

creatures dress in tattered clothing that smells of rotting

fish and dampness.

While in this guise, a kelpie often feigns being a fisher,

hunter, or lost traveler. A common tactic is for one to act as

if it is drowning in the middle of a lake, so that it can lure a

victim to dive in to assist.

Kelpies make their lair

in ponds, lakes, rivers, and other

inland bodies of water. If someone

makes a careful search of such an area,

great amounts of bones and carcasses will be found littering

the muddy floor.

Kelpies speak Common and Sylvan.

COMBAT

A kelpie usually takes on human form and tries to woo or

convince individuals to approach its watery lair. Alterna-

tively, a kelpie remains just under the surface of the water

and waits for a victim to get close. It uses charm person to

draw victims in and then emotion to either fill victims with

fear or root them in place for an easy kill.

Once a victim is close to or in the water, the kelpie reverts

to its natural form and attacks. It is adept at tripping oppo-

nents in the water so that they are in danger of drowning.

Kelpies can be summoned using a summon natures ally

IX spell.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect thoughts. 3/day

charm person, emotion. Caster level 7th; save DC 12 + spell level.

Trip (Ex): A kelpie that hits with a hoof attack can

attempt to trip its opponent as a free action without

making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportu-

nity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip

the kelpie.

Skills: Kelpies have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and can

Khaastas are dangerous reptilian humanoids that roam

the wastelands of the Outlands and the chaotic planes.

They are infamous for being raiders, plunderers, slavers,

and mercenaries.

Khaastas superficially resemble lizardfolk, and they may

have descended from them long ago. However, khaastas

are considerably larger, tougher, and more aggressive than

normal lizardfolk. Khaastas have tough, small scales and

flaring crests that are colored in intricate, wild patterns

unique to each individual. They have long, powerful tails

that are used for balance rather than combat.

Most khaastas travel in nomadic bands in the Outer

Planes, where they look for loot, slaves, and combat. They

hire themselves out to anyone that seems powerful (and in

their  eyes,  worthy)  enough  to

command them, but they back-

stab their patron at the first sign

of weakness.

Khaasta

Khaastas  speak  Draconic

and Common.

COMBAT

Khaastas look for ways

to  dive  into  combat.

Some begin by pepper-

ing their opponents with

arrows, while other khaastas

charge into melee with their

halberds. A khaasta can make

a bite attack while wielding

a weapon, and it relishes tast-

ing blood during a fight. The

creatures make use of giant

lizards as mounts.

Khaastas  plan  and  exe-

cute ambushes that focus on

hindering dangerous foes un-

til they can be brought down

in melee combat. However,

khaastas have a strong cow-

ardly streak and run when the combat

turns against them.

Challenge Rating: 3

KHAASTA SOCIETY

Among the roving bands of khaastas, might makes right. The

pecking order of any band is in constant flux, and challenges

are common. Khaastas once determined status by having

duels to the death, until they almost drove themselves to

extinction. Since then, disputes and challenges have been

resolved through a nonlethal form of ritual combat.

Khaastas have a convoluted sense of honor that is impos-

sible for outsiders to understand. Treachery, betrayal, theft,

and murder are all acceptable methods of advancement in

khaasta society.

Females are just as strong and tough as males and are just

as likely to be found in marauder bands. Some foes have

seen a female khaasta wading into battle with a young one

strapped to her back. Despite this seeming disregard for

the safety of their children, khaastas defend their young

with incredible ferocity.

KHAASTA CHARACTERS

A khaastas favored class is fighter; most khaasta

leaders are fighters or clerics. Khaasta clerics

can choose any two of the following domains:

Chaos, Strength, Trickery, or War. A khaasta

PCs effective character level (ECL) is its class

level  +  3.  For  example,  a  1st-level  khaasta

fighter has an ECL of 4 and is the equivalent of

a 4th-level character.

The hulking kuldurath is commonly seen serving as a

mount for ferrumach rilmani (described later in this book).

A kuldurath measures nearly 14 feet long, is 8 feet high

at the shoulder, and weighs as much as 7,500 pounds. It is

similar in shape to a rhinoceros, except its legs are longer

and more muscular and it lacks the rhinos horn; in place of

this is a pair of huge, razor-sharp tusks. The hind legs of a

kuldurath are much more muscular and limber than its

front legs, allowing it to jump and kick with great power. A

running kuldurath looks similar to a running rabbit,

although it is much more menacing. The creatures are

covered with iron-gray scales, and most kul-

duraths also wear +2 full plate barding.

Kulduraths understand Sylvan but do not

speak any languages.

COMBAT

Kulduraths  fiercely  protect  their  herds

against attacks, but they are not territorial

and do not mind friendly or ambiva-

lent creatures in their midst. When

mounted, a kuldurath can be a formida-

ble opponent. A kuldurath being ridden

by a ferrumach rilmani uses its Intimi-

date skill modifier to aid the ferrumachs

Intimidate checks, as needed.

Charge (Ex): A kuldurath typically

begins a battle by charging at its opponent. In

addition to the normal benefits and hazards

of a charge, this tactic allows the kuldurath

to deal double damage with a successful

gore attack.

Electricity  Aura  (Su): Three

times per day as a free action, a kuldu-

rath can emit a powerful aura of elec-

tricity. All creatures within 30 feet must

make a Reflex save (DC 18) each

round or take 2d6 points of elec-

tricity damage.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action, a

kuldurath can trample opponents at least one

size category smaller than itself. This

attack deals 2d6+5 points of bludgeon-

ing damage. A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty

or a Reflex save (DC 19) for half damage.

Share Defenses (Su): A kuldurath automat-

ically gains the benefits of its riders damage

reduction and energy resistances, as well as any

spell effects with a range of personal.

Immunities (Ex): A kuldurath is immune to electricity

damage and mind-affecting effects.

Skills: Kulduraths have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

Living holocausts burn every creature they encounter.

They are the enemies of all living things; even fire and air

elementals despise and fear them.

Despite its gaseous form, a living holocaust can speak

Abyssal, Auran, and Ignan.

COMBAT

Living holocausts always use the wind to their advantage,

sending foes sprawling and burning them to ash if possible.

They love setting the winds in motion with their holocaust

winds ability and then taking whirlflame form to deal fur-

ther damage to foes. Though protected by their gaseous

form, they prefer to escape melee and flee through small

spaces when confronted by capable enemies.

Air Mastery (Ex): A living holocaust gains a +1 bonus on

its attack and damage rolls if its opponent is airborne.

Burn (Ex): Any creature that is hit by the living holo-

causts fiery windspike attack, or that hits the living holo-

caust with a natural weapon or an unarmed attack, must

succeed on a Reflex save (DC 20) or catch on fire. The fire

burns for 1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire in the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Equal  parts  air,  fire,  and  evil,

living holocausts are elemental

creatures with demonic spirits.

Filled with malice and greed for

power, they feed by burning the

life out of other creatures. Living

holocausts on the Material Plane

seek to dominate creatures in the

area,  forcing  them  to  offer

living tributes to its hunger.

A  living  holocaust  looks

like a red, upright flame that

constantly flickers and waves.

It has no obvious face or other

recognizable features. In its

whirlflame form, a living holo-

caust shows it is truly worthy of

its name, becoming a veritable

cyclone of fiery death and tearing winds.

Living holocaust

Elemental Traits

(Ex): A living holo-

caust is immune to

poison, sleep, paral-

ysis, and stun-

ning. It is not

subject to critical

117

hits or flanking, and it cannot be raised or resurrected. The

creature also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within 30 feet of a living

holocaust must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 18) or

take 1d6 points of fire damage from the intense heat.

Treat this effect as a burst that continually radiates from

the creature.

Fiery Windspike (Ex): Although gaseous, a living holo-

caust can whirl its form into a spike of superheated air and fire

dealing 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage. A

living holocaust can also make a melee touch attack to deal

1d6 points of fire damage.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A living holocaust is immune to fire

damage. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as

normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is

allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

Gaseous (Ex): The body of a living holocaust is naturally

gaseous as though by a gaseous form spell. Despite its gaseous

nature, it can speak, cast spells that have only a verbal com-

ponent, and use its supernatural abilities. A living holocaust

can pass through small holes or narrow openings. However,

it cant run.

Holocaust Winds (Su): A living holocaust can com-

mand the winds in an area at will, filling them with fire. This

works like a control winds spell as cast by a 10th-level sor-

cerer, except that creatures and objects in the area of the

holocaust winds effect also take 3d6 points of fire damage

each round (Reflex DC 18 half ). A living holocaust can use

this ability or dismiss its use at will as a standard action, but

it can have only one holocaust winds effect in operation at

one time.

Regeneration (Ex): A living holocaust takes normal

damage from cold, and also from holy weapons and blessed

weapons of at least +2 enhancement. Attack forms that dont

deal hit point damage ignore regeneration, and a living

holocaust does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Whirlflame (Su): A living holocaust can transform itself

into a whirlwind of flame once every 10 minutes and

remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has.

In this form, the creature can move through the air or just

above a solid or liquid surface at a fly speed of 60 feet (per-

fect). The whirlflame is 5 feet wide at its base, 10 to 20 feet

tall, and 10 to 30 feet wide at the top. The living holocaust

controls its dimensions within these parameters.

Creatures caught in the whirlflame take 3d6 points of

fire damage each round. In addition, Large or smaller crea-

tures can take damage from the wind and be lifted into the

air by its powerful force. A Large or smaller creature

caught in the whirlflames area must succeed on a Reflex

save (DC 18) or take 2d6 points of damage due to the force

of the winds. In must also make a second Reflex saving

throw (DC 18) or be picked up bodily and held suspended

in the powerful winds and burning flames. A creature that

can fly is allowed a Reflex save (DC 18) each round to

escape the whirlflame. The creature still takes damage but

can leave the whirlflame if the save is successful.

A living holocaust can eject any carried creature when-

ever it wishes, depositing it wherever the whirlflame hap-

pens to be.

Skills: The heat and light a living holocaust emits

cause it to take a 10 penalty on Hide checks. *With the

heat  and  light  it  involuntarily  generates,  its  nearly

impossible for a living holocaust to hide, but in areas of

other flames and fire (such as a burning building) or in

any substantial blaze, living holocausts have a +10 racial

bonus on Hide checks.

Those who encounter a lucent worm often do so before they

know the creature is near. Although massive in size, a lucent

worm is adept at hiding itself. This, combined with its versa-

tile means of locomotion, ensures that the lucent worm

rarely goes hungry.

An adult lucent worm measures 5 feet in diameter and

almost 100 feet long, weighing in at 55,000 to 60,000

pounds. A worms skin is almost completely translucent

enabling observers to see its internal organs and whatever

the creature had as a recent mealand covered with mil-

lions of tiny hairlike cilia that provide the worm with a

means of movement. Its mouth bristles with dozens of

sharp teeth.

A lucent worm requires a massive amount of food to

maintain its weight, so it is always on the lookout for more

sustenance.  Its  digestive  system  can

assimilate only organic matter, however,

so small objects often get trapped in its

gizzard, while larger indigestible materi-

als are left behind as waste.

Lucent worm

COMBAT

When confronted with prey, which is

any living creature, a lucent worm at-

tacks with its bite. If confronted with

multiple foes, it typically attempts

a crush attack before engaging re-

maining opponents with its bite.

Crush (Ex): A lucent worm can

move over opponents three or more

size categories smaller than itself as a

standard action, using its whole body

to crush them. A crush attack affects as

many  creatures  as  can  fit  under  the

lucent worms body. Each creature in

the  affected  area  must  succeed  on  a

Reflex save (DC 33) or be pinned, auto-

matically taking 4d6+13 points of bludg-

eoning damage. Thereafter, if the lucent

worm chooses to maintain the pin, treat

it as a normal grapple attack (grapple

bonus +46). While pinned, the opponent

takes crush damage each round.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a lucent worm hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +46). If it gets a hold, it can

swallow the opponent on its next successful grapple check.

Thereafter, the lucent worm has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its bite to hold the opponent

(20 penalty on grapple check, but the lucent worm is not

considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Paralysis (Ex): Any creature hit by a lucent worms bite or

crush attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 28) or be para-

lyzed for 4 rounds.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A lucent worm can swallow a

single creature that is at least two size categories smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +46), provided it already has that opponent in its

maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the lucent

worm, the opponent takes 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning

JE

damage and 2d4 points of acid damage per round

from the lucent worms stomach. A successful grapple

check allows the swallowed creature to climb out of the

stomach and return to the lucent worms maw, from where

another successful grapple check is needed to get free.

Alternatively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way

out with either claws or a light piercing or slashing

weapon. Dealing a total of at least 30 points of damage to

the stomach (AC 19) in this way creates an opening large

enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed crea-

ture exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. A lucent

worms maw can hold 2 Large, 4 Medium-size, or 16 Small

or smaller opponents.

Tremorsense (Ex): A lucent worm can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

Skills: Lucent worms have a +15 racial bonus on Hide

checks. Lucent worms have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered.

Maelephant

The maelephant is a powerful guardian fiend used to protect

and defend the treasuries of fiends and wizards.

The creature is humanoid in basic shape, standing 9 feet

tall and weighing 800 pounds. A maelephants hands appear

oversized for its body and are tipped with claws. Its head is

similar to a small-eared elephants head, having a small

mouth filled with tiny teeth, small rheumy red eyes, and a

long, coiling trunk tipped with a long, thin spike.

Originally created by powerful baatezu lords to serve

as guardians, many maelephants escaped their servitude

when their lords were deposed. Now each one travels

the Lower Planes alone, driven by an overwhelming urge

to protect and guard, though it has nothing of its own to

120

protect. If a powerful individual can provide a maele-

phant with the great amount of living flesh it needs for

sustenance, it readily agrees to serve as a guardian for

that individual.

Maelephants speak Common and Infernal.

COMBAT

A maelephant fights to the death to protect its territory

or its charge, and it never pursues intruders or

thieves to a distance out of sight of whatever it

is guarding. A maelephant is equally effective

at holding the line and preventing passage

into an area as it is at forcing intruders to

retreat. A maelephant never leaves its

post, and it immediately breaks off any

attack to protect a new threat to its

charge. It usually spends the first

few rounds of combat using spell-

like abilities to erect a defensive

screen around its charge.

Maelephants  can  be  sum-

moned using a summon monster

VIII spell.

Breath Weapon (Su): Three

times per day, a maelephant can

breathe out a cloud of noxious

vapor  10  feet  wide  and  30  feet

long. Victims within the area of

the cloud must make a Fortitude

save (DC 17) or suffer complete

memory loss. Memory loss sup-

presses all of a creatures ranks in

its skills and its feats, and it pre-

vents the use of any class abilities

(including spellcasting). Currently

prepared spells are not lost; they are

simply  not  accessible  to  be  cast.

Racial abilities are retained. Addi-

tionally, the victim no longer knows

who  its  friends  and  enemies  are,

doesnt remember its past, and cant even remember its

name. The victim can create new memories, but each

time it sleeps or rests, any new memories it has created

vanish. This condition can be cured by any effect that

cures poison (a heal or neutralize poison spell, for example);

otherwise, it is permanent.

Frenzied Charge (Ex): Once per minute, a maele-

phant can make a frenzied charge. During the round in

which this occurs, the maelephants speed increases to

45 feet and it gains a +2 bonus on all attack rolls. This

bonus stacks with any bonuses gained from making a

charge attack.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a maelephant hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +18). If it gets a hold,

it automatically hits with its trunk-spike. Thereafter, the

maelephant has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the maelephant is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals claw damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willalarm, entangle, gust of

wind, light, true seeing, warp wood; 3/dayblade barrier, baleful

polymorph. Caster level 8th; save DC 12 + spell level.

Defensive Stance (Ex): Once per encounter, a maele-

phant can adopt a defensive stance as a free action on its

turn. In this defensive stance, the maelephant gains +2

Strength, +4 Constitution, a +2 resistance bonus on all

saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class. The follow-

ing changes are in effect as long as the defensive stance

lasts: HD 8d8+40 (76 hp); AC 24, touch 13, flat-footed 20;

Base Attack/Grapple +9/+19; Full Attack 2 claws +14

melee and trunk-spike +9 melee; Damage claw 1d6+7,

trunk-spike 2d6+4; SV Fort +11, Ref +8, Will +14; Str 24,

Con 20; Concentration +16, Jump +17. These benefits per-

sist for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the maelephants

newly improved Constitution modifier, or until the

maelephant moves. While in a defensive stance, a maele-

phant cannot use skills or abilities that require it to shift

its position. A maelephant can end its defensive stance at

will. At the end of the defensive stance, the maelephant

takes a 2 penalty to Strength for the duration of the cur-

rent encounter.

Keen Senses (Ex): A maelephants sight is four times as

good as a humans. It has low-light vision and darkvision to

a range of 240 feet.

Outsider Traits: Maelephants cannot be raised or resur-

rected (though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Fast Healing (Ex): A maelephant regains lost hit points

at the rate of 2 per round. Fast healing does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow a maelephant to regrow or reattach lost

body parts.

Scent (Ex): A maelephant can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Maugs are tireless soldiers in search of battle. These con-

structs from Acheron are used on battlefields across the

planes as perfect mercenaries, since they remain unflinch-

ingly loyal to their employer and are fearless in battle.

Maugs serve any master willing to meet their price, and

they do not trouble themselves with questions of right

Maugs are hulking constructs of stone standing more

than 9 feet tall and weighing almost 1,500 pounds. Their

MAUGS AND TOME AND BLOOD

Tome  and  Blood  introduces  several  sorcerer/wizard  spells  that

maugs should make use of: repair minor damage, repair light damage,

repair  moderate  damage,  repair  serious  damage,  and repair  critical

damage. These spells work like the corresponding cure spells, except

pqqqqrs

that  they  are  arcane  spells  that  repair  damage  only  to  a  construct

that has at least 1 hit point remaining. If you use Tome and Blood in

your campaign, there is no reason that maug spellcasters shouldnt

create potions or wands with repair spells to facilitate their recovery

from damage.

steel-gray bodies are cut from the pitiless stone of

Acheron into massive, humanoid forms. Most

maugs carry Huge two-bladed swords forged in

the harsh foundries of their home plane and wear heavy

iron breastplates of the same origin. A number of

maugs are modified with grafts of stone and metal.

Scholars of planar matters suspect that maugs

first served as shock troops in an ancient war

between two long-lost empires. In the end, one

empire or both discovered some means of

transporting the maugs to Thuldanin,

the second layer of Acheron and a

junkyard of debris from all wars.

Initially transported to Thuldanin

as prisoners, the maugs ended up

changing  the  layer  into  their

fortress. The first maugs ban-

ished there used knowledge

stolen from their cre-

ators  to  craft  more

maugs. These ancient

maugs  are  known  by

their fellows as the Thul-

karr, and they rule the maugs to this

day. The Thulkarr and other maug

spellcasters have the ability to

travel to other planes, and they

sometimes use plane shift or gate

to call up squads and platoons

of maugs to fight in con-

flicts across the multiverse.

Since maugs are nonliving constructs and do not die unless

destroyed in combat, many of these mercenaries remain on

the Material Plane for centuries, seeking out wars to give

meaning to their existence.

Maugs speak Common, Draconic, and Giant.

COMBAT

Whether thundering across the battlefield on crushing

rollers or whirling through the ranks of their enemies with

their deadly two-bladed swords, maugs are juggernauts of

destruction. Maugs view every confrontation as a battle in a

war, so they always fight with a plan formulated for the

battleground. If they have advance knowledge of the site of

the conflict, they build traps, dig trenches, and try to control

the flow of battle to their best advantage.

Pulverize (Su): Three times per day as a standard action,

a maug can touch an object and negate its hardness for 1d4

rounds (Fortitude DC 18 negates). This power can affect an

object of up to 1,000 cubic feet in volume (a 10-foot cube); if

the object is larger, only a 10-foot cube of it is affected.

Unattended nonmagical objects do not receive a saving

throw. If a creature holds, wears, or carries the object, the

maug must succeed on a melee touch attack. This attack

does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Many maug

fighters learn the Improved Sunder feat to use

this power against dangerous foes.

Construct Traits: Maugs are immune

to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects. They are not subject to critical hits,

subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain,

or death from massive damage. A maug cannot heal itself

but can be healed through repair. It cannot be raised or res-

urrected. A maug has darkvision (60-foot range).

Rapid Repair (Ex): A maug that rests for

1 full hour repairs 1 point of damage, so

long as it has at least 1 hit point. Rapid

repair does not allow a maug to regrow

or reattach lost body parts.

A character can assist a maugs

self-repair with a Craft (stone-

masonry) check (DC 15). If the

check is successful, the maug

repairs 2 hit points per hour of

rest. Providing assistance to

the maug counts as light

activity for the assisting

character, and a character

can assist only one maug

at a time. A maug cannot

assist its own repair.

Grafts (Ex): When maugs are created

on  the  plane  of  Acheron,  they  are  fre-

quently equipped with special grafts. These

grafts are described in the Maug Grafts

section in Appendix 2. A maug without class

levels can have up to 2,000 gp worth of maug grafts. A

maug with class levels can purchase additional grafts with

treasure it amasses.

Maug

Skills: Maugs receive skills as though they were out-

siders. *Due to their innate understanding of machinery

and engineering, maugs have a +4 racial bonus on Craft

(stonemasonry) and Knowledge (architecture and engineer-

ing) checks.

MAUG SOCIETY

Although created for war, maugs dont fight each other.

By accident rather than design, maugs sometimes end up

on different sides of a conflict. Such wars have an atro-

cious number of casualties, since the maugs lead their

armies to clash again and again until one side or both is

ground down to nothing. The maugs may then band

together to fight a new war as though they had never

opposed one another.

The Thulkarr rule the maugs because they created most

of them, and they are the oldest and most powerful of their

kind. Maugs give the Thulkarr the deference soldiers give

generals, but the Thulkarr, for all their power, have few

G

U

A

M

122

orders to give. In their minds, their race exists to serve

others in battle, and the Thulkarr simply try to obtain the

best terms possible for the use of their fellows. Hiring a

maug mercenary generally costs about 5 gp per day, plus 2

gp per class level of the maug; the maugs prefer rare ores and

magic items, paid in advance.

MAUG CHARACTERS

Maugs excel in nearly every class, but their favored class is

fighter. Maug clerics and druids are rare, since they are

soulless creations and not part of the natural world.

Because of its many special abilities, a maug player charac-

ters effective character level (ECL) is equal to its class level

+ 5. Thus, a 1st-level maug fighter has an ECL of 6 and is the

equivalent of a 6th-level character. A maug characters spell

resistance is equal to its class level + 14.

CONSTRUCTION

Only the Thulkarr understand the secrets of a maugs cre-

ation, but rumors persist that old ruins might conceal

ancient tablets describing that process and the rites by

which a whole race can be banished to Acheron. In addition

to knowledge of the secret rites, it requires 10,000 gp and

500 XP to create a maug; the Thulkarr sell the services of

maug mercenaries for the

express purpose of gar-

nering the funds nec-

essary to build more

of their kind.

Among the most dangerous terrors of the Underdark,

maulgoths are solitary masters of stone. They move quickly

over or through any stone substance. This great mobility

enables a maulgoth to flee through solid stone in the rare

instances when it finds itself overmatched.

Maulgoths look like horrid amalgamations of flesh and

stone. The central body of a maulgoth is shaped like a large,

malformed rhinoceros, with four powerful legs and four

tentacles. Its greenish-gray body is covered with rocklike

spikes and protrusions, and its hide feels like stone to all

but the most experienced hand.

Although maulgoths exhibit a power over the natural

world akin to that of a druid, they have none of the love

for the environment that most druids share. They cal-

lously use the natural world as their first line of defense,

controlling animals and plants to serve their needs.

Maulgoths speak Undercommon and Terran.

COMBAT

Fierce, inventive combatants, maulgoths hunt large

stretches of caverns, answering to nothing but their own

whims. Maulgoths love fighting from ambush, and their

ability to move in and out of solid stone at will allows

them  to  fight  successful  hit-and-run  battles  even

against groups of powerful foes.

A maulgoth often begins battle against a dangerous

group by using its Spring Attack feat and its ethereal jolt

ability to force some of its foes onto the Ethereal Plane.

Once it has whittled the opposition down in this manner, a

maulgoth emerges in the center of the main combat area,

attempting to keep all the remaining combatants in reach

of its powerful tentacles.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a maul-

goth can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 3d6+3

points of bludgeoning damage.

Ethereal Jolt (Ex): As a standard action, a maulgoth can

attempt to force an opponent onto the Ethereal Plane. The

maulgoth makes a touch attack with one of its tentacles,

and if the attack hits, the creature struck must make a For-

titude saving throw (DC 29) to avoid being forced onto the

Ethereal Plane.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a maulgoth hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +32). If it gets a

hold, it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the

maulgoth has the option to conduct the grapple normally,

or simply use its tentacle to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the maulgoth is not consid-

ered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals tentacle damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcalm animals, control

plants, cure light wounds, dominate animal, soften earth and

stone, stone tell, transmute mud to rock,

transmute rock to mud; 5/daycure

serious wounds, true seeing, wall of

stone. These abilities are as spells

cast by a 13th-level druid (save DC

14 + spell level).

Perfect Climbing (Ex): A maulgoth

moves with perfect ease while climb-

ing. It can move at full speed across

ceilings, overhangs, and other slanted

or  vertical  surfaces  without  making

Climb checks, and it does not have to

make a Climb check to avoid losing its

grip when it takes damage.

Tremorsense (Ex): A maulgoth can auto-

matically sense the location of anything

within 60 feet that is in contact with the

ground.

Xorn Movement (Ex): A maul-

goth can glide through stone, dirt, or

almost any other sort of earth except

metal as easily as a fish swims through

water. Its burrowing leaves behind no

tunnel or hole, nor does it create any

ripple or other sign of its presence. A

Megatheriums, also called giant land sloths, dominate the

landscape wherever they reside. Few natural predators

risk taking one on, since the tough hide of a

megatherium makes it a difficult catch.

A megatherium measures almost

20 feet long and stands as tall as

a  human  at  the  shoulder.

Megatherium

LGW

However, the creature only rarely walks on all fours, since it

prefers to walk upright on its hind legs. An adult, when

standing up in this fashion, is around 15 feet tall. Covered in

shaggy fur that efficiently protects them from the environ-

ment, the megatherium also has a display of teeth that befits

its omnivorous diet.

Although they keep mostly to themselves, when megath-

eriums decide they need meat to supplement their prima-

rily herbivorous diet, few other creatures stand in their

way. Like most mammals, megatheriums are known to be

quite aggressive in the mating season or when protecting

their young.

COMBAT

A megatherium tries to trample its nearest opponent before

attempting to bring its claws to bear. It uses its reach and

improved grab ability to establish a grapple; then it holds

the victim down while fighting other foes off with its other

claw and bite.

Mongrelfolk

Improved Grab (Ex): If a mega-

therium hits an opponent that is at

least one size category smaller than

itself with a claw attack, it deals

normal damage and attempts to start

a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity

(grapple bonus +25). If it gets a

hold, it can pin down the oppo-

nent on its next successful grapple

check. Thereafter, the megatherium

has the option to conduct the grapple

normally, or simply use its claw to hold

the opponent (20 penalty on grapple

check, but the megatherium is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automati-

cally deals claw damage.

Pin Down (Ex): A megatherium can make a

grapple check against an already grappled

opponent in an attempt to pin it down. If

successful, the opponent is pinned down

beneath the megatheriums claw. Pinned

opponents take trample damage in each round

they are pinned, including the round in which

the pin is established.

Mongrelfolk, hideous creatures descended

from generations of crossbreeding among

the  worst  examples  of  many  species,

exhibit few redeeming qualities.

Like canine mongrels, mongrelfolk vary

widely in appearance, but they tend toward

a generic humanoid form and display the

most terrible features of their many ances-

tral races. Their ears are long, wide, and

sharply pointed, their noses flat and broad,

their foreheads sharply sloped, and their

eyes large and bright. Their hides are typi-

cally covered in hair ranging from thick

patches on their shoulders and bellies to

very light covering on the arms

and legs. Their teeth are invari-

ably sharp, crooked, and rotten.

Mongrelfolk speak Common

and their own pidgin language.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action,

a  megatherium  can  trample  oppo-

nents at least one size category smaller than

itself. This attack deals 2d8+12 points of bludgeoning

damage. A trampled opponent can attempt either an attack

of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex save (DC 24) for

half damage.

Scent (Ex): A megatherium can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

COMBAT

Mongrelfolk are extremely cowardly, and they avoid

direct conflict as much as possible. They construct traps

around their lairs rather than relying on combat to keep

intruders away.

Emulate Race (Ex): Because of their radically mixed

heritage, mongrelfolk can use magic items that only func-

tion for a user of a certain race. This ability works like the

COMBAT

The creatures normal method of attack is to hide, and then

stealthily approach and sneak attack an unwary target. If

confronted by multiple foes or by a creature aware of its

presence, it uses its dance of death ability to allow it to

approach its enemies and bite.

Dance of Death (Su): A necrophidius can sway in a hyp-

notic manner, riveting the attention of any creature within

30 feet that can see it. Creatures that fail a Will saving throw

(DC 12) are dazed (can take no actions but can defend them-

selves) for as long as the necrophidius continues its dance.

Creatures that make their saving throws can avert their

eyes from the necrophidius as if they were avoiding a gaze

attack (50% chance per round of not having to make a

saving throw, 20% miss chance on attacks against the

necrophidius). A necrophidius can move up to its normal

speed as a move action even if performing its dance of death.

This is a mind-affecting effect.

Paralysis (Su): A creature bitten by a necrophidius must

succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 12) or be paralyzed and

unconscious for 10 minutes.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a necrophidiuss target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a

necrophidius, the necrophidius deals an additional 2d6

points of damage on a successful melee attack.

Construct Traits: A necrophidius is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The

creature is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, abil-

ity damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A necrophidius has

darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A necrophidius has a +8 racial bonus on Hide

and Move Silently checks. It also has a +8 racial bonus on

Climb checks and can always choose to

emulate race function of the Use Magic Device skill. A mon-

grelfolk can automatically emulate any humanoid race, with

no need for a skill check. Mongrelfolk that have the Use

Magic Device skill have a +4 racial bonus on attempts to

emulate nonhumanoid races using that skill.

Sound Imitation (Ex): A mongrelfolk can mimic any

voice or sound it has heard. Listeners must succeed on a

Will save (DC 16) to detect the ruse.

Skills: Mongrelfolk have a +8 racial bonus on Hide and

Sleight of Hand checks.

MONGRELFOLK CHARACTERS

A mongrelfolks favored class is rogue. Most mongrelfolk

spellcasters are adepts, but a few clerics exist and serve their

reclusive deity, Meriadar. Mongrelfolk clerics have access

to the domains of Law, Protection, and Trickery. A mon-

grelfolk PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level. Thus, a 1st-level mongrelfolk rogue has an ECL

of 1 and is an ordinary 1st-level character.

The necrophidius is a stealthy construct often mistaken for

an undead creature. It is created to assassinate a target or guard

an object or location.

A necrophidius looks like a skeletal snake with a fanged

humanoid skull. It normally remains in hiding and stays

absolutely still unless its orders require it to follow a crea-

ture or patrol an area. It slithers silently and can climb well.

It understands Common and obeys the orders of its creator,

but it cannot speak.

CONSTRUCTION

To construct a necrophidius,

the creator needs the Craft

Wondrous Item feat and

must expend 5,000 gp in

materials and 100 XP. The

cost includes the need for

a skeleton of a Medium-

size snake, the skull of a

humanoid creature, and

all other mundane ingre-

dients. Assembling the

body requires a successful

Craft (sculpting) check (DC

13). If the creator is a sor-

cerer or wizard, the construc-

tion process requires geas/quest,

hold  person, hypnotism,  and

Mordenkainens faithful hound.

If the creator is a cleric, it re-

quires animate objects, command, geas/quest, and

hold person. The process takes five days.

Nerras are accomplished and sneaky fighters that use

ambush and cover to bring down their opponents.

They prefer to lurk on the Plane of Mirrors

When killed, a nerra shatters

utes, these shards turn into

pools of quicksilver before

fading away into nothing.

Mirror  Jump  (Su):

Nerras can move through

mirrored  and  reflective

surfaces at will. This effect

is similar to shadow walk, but

the  nerra  travels  along  the

Plane of Mirrors. As a standard

action,  the  nerra  must  touch  a

mirror or other highly reflective sur-

face. The nerra then exits from another

Larger examples of this creature can be created, with each

additional Hit Die increasing the cost by 2,500 gp and 50 XP.

NERRA

Some scholars maintain that the common belief that mir-

rors simply reflect light is wrongin truth, they allow the

viewer to gaze into a reality that exists alongside the one

they know. That reality is known as the Plane of Mirrors.

The rulers of the Plane of Mirrors are the creatures known

as nerras. Enigmatic and contrary by nature, nerras lurk the

eternal hallways of the Plane of Mirrors, observing activities

on the Material Plane by looking through any of the count-

less mirrors that serve as conduits between the two planes.

All nerras look like normal humanoids, but they have

skin with a perfectly mirrorlike smooth surface.

Nerra occasionally cross the border between the planes to

kidnap individuals on the Material Plane. It has been theo-

rized that they are planning an invasion of the Material Plane.

Sometimes nerras wander the Planes, gathering infor-

mation and infiltrating a variety of organizations. They

monitor the activity of a wide range of people. These are

usually, but not always, individuals in positions of power.

After a while, they try to capture the individual and bring

him or her onto the Plane of Mirrors.

Nerras speak Common plus their own language. Their

language is not particularly pleasant since it sounds like

glass being scored by a rock. Over time, most nerras learn

the language of the particular race that they spend the most

time observing.

mirror that is no farther than 1 mile away.

If a nerra touches a regular mirror, the mirror jump hap-

pens automatically. A nerra can also touch a highly reflec-

tive surface, such as a polished metal shield or armor. This

surface must be clear glass, a still pool of water, or shiny

metal. There is a 30% chance that the surface is reflective

enough for the nerra to make the mirror jump. However, a

nerra can only enter a nonmirrored surfaceit can return

only through a normal mirror.

If another mirror is not within the range of the mirror

jump, the nerra must wander the Plane of Mirrors and exit

through another random mirror portal.

Outsider  Traits: Nerras  have  darkvision  (60-foot

range). They cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish

or miracle spell can restore life).

Reflective Spell Resistance (Sp): A nerra has a special type

of spell resistance that causes any targeted spell it success-

fully resists to bounce off and reflect back at the caster. The

caster becomes either the spells target or the point of

origin for the spells effect, as appropriate. In addition,

nerras are immune to gaze attacks, and such an effect is

reflected back to its origin.

Shard Weapon Specialty: All nerra receive a bonus

Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat with at least one shard

weapon. Many also gain a bonus Weapon Focus feat for one

or more types of shard weapon.

Sonic Vulnerability (Ex): All nerras take half again as

much (+50%) damage as normal from an attack involving

sonic  energy,  regardless  of  whether  a  saving  throw  is

allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure.

127

SHARD WEAPONS

Nerras employ swords and daggers that are made out of the

substance of the Plane of Mirrors. They resemble shards of a

broken mirror that have been set into a shiny hilt. Despite

their fragile appearance, shard weapons are incredibly

tough, deadly, and razor-sharp. Shard weapons leave terrible

wounds that bleed incessantly.

Shard weapons are +2 wounding weapons. In the hands of

someone without the appropriate Exotic Weapon Profi-

ciency feat, the weapon is awkward (4 penalty wielders on

attack rolls) and contributes only its enhancement bonus,

not the wounding ability, on any attacks made with it.

NERRA SOCIETY

Nerras are contrary by nature, and they balance on a knifes

edge of different morality and ethics. They strive to main-

tain a neutral outlook, but see themselves as inherently

superior beings to those that gaze into their mirror portals.

Sillits are the leaders of the nerras, but they rule through

necessity more than for the sake of power. Individual

varoots and kalareems can wield considerable power and

even eclipse a sillit over time. Most, however, defer to the

rule of the sillits with no qualms.

NERRA CHARACTERS

The favored class of varoots is rogue. Kalareems favored

class is fighter, and sillits are wizards. A nerra PCs effective

character level (ECL) is its class level plus the appropriate

modifier: kalareem +6, sillit +18, varoot +3. Thus, a 1st-level

varoot rogue has an ECL of 4 and is the equivalent of a 4th-

level character. A nerra characters spell resistance is equal to

its class level + 12.

While nerras are usually stealthy in combat, there are times

when brute force is necessary. This special breed of warriors

is called the kalareems, and they are ferocious warriors that

fight with two shard swords. They are the chosen defenders

of the Plane of Mirrors.

Kalareems  look  like  bulky  and  muscular  nerras.

Instead of the smooth, naked form of varoots, they seem

to wear mirrored armor that blends in with their natural

form. They are quiet and taciturn, and they fight with

fluid grace.

Kalareems lack the ability to use change self as other nerras,

but they still reflect spells.

A kalareem can be summoned using a summon monster

IV spell.

Combat

Kalareems move and fight with deadly accuracy, and they

seem to flow more than walk. Kalareems prefer to soften up

a target from a distance with their shard spray and will usu-

ally exhaust this option before moving into melee. Once in

combat, they spin and twist in an acrobatic display, wielding

their shard swords with deadly accuracy.

NERRA AND MANUAL OF THE PLANES

Creating  devious  schemes,  Nerra  replace  kidnapped  individuals  with

mirror replicas. The mirror twins are the first wave and act as sleeper

agents for the moment when the nerras can launch a massive force of

their own. Regardless of their alignment, mirror twins defer to the rule

of nerras.

pqqqqrs

Certain nerras observe a particular grouping of mirror portals, called

constellations.  Constellations  are  mirrors  that  have  something  in

commoncreated by the same owner, made from the same source, or

created  in  the  same  place.  Because  time  is  static  in  the  Plane  of

kalareem, up to a maximum of 5d4.

In addition, a wound resulting from a kalareems shard spray

attack bleeds for an additional 2 points of damage per round

thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in cumu-

lative bleeding loss (two wounds for 4 points of damage per

round, and so on). The bleeding can be stopped only by a suc-

cessful Heal check (DC 10) or the application of any cure spell

or other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or the like).

Sillits are the leaders, planners, and schemers of the nerras.

Unless urgent business takes them to the Material Plane,

sillits rarely leave the safety of the Plane of Mirrors.

Physically, sillits look like other nerras. They have a

humanoid shape covered with mirrorlike skin, and their

faces are completely smooth. Unlike varoots or kalareems,

sillits prefer to wear clothing such as fine silk robes of shiny

Combat

Sillits do not like melee combat and engage opponents only

if absolutely necessary. They make extensive use of their

spell-like abilities and mirror jump ability to get out of situ-

ations that can be avoided, but they wield their shard swords

with deadly accuracy if called upon.

A sillit can be summoned using a summon monster VI

Varoots are the most common nerras to be found both on

the Plane of Mirrors and the Material Plane. They are

experts at spying, infiltration, and subterfuge.

In their natural form, varoots have a basic humanoid

shape that is covered with a mirrorlike sheen that reflects

everything around them. Their facial features are smooth

and rather indistinct. Varoots wear clothing only when they

are mimicking a target.

When wandering the Material Plane on one of their mis-

sions, varoots move about while under a change self effect,

and they typically take the form of their target or someone

close to them.

Combat

Varoots dislike getting into combat since they see it as a fail-

ure to be stealthy or deceptive enough. When they do have

to fight, they prefer to create a mirror image to confuse their

opponent or use change self to mimic an opponents ally.

Varoots wield razor-sharp shard weapons. A typical tactic

involves striking with a shard weapon, then retreating for a

few rounds while the opponent bleeds.

A varoot can be summoned using a summon monster II spell.

Sailors sometimes tell stories of strange and terrible forests

of trees in the middle of the ocean; most of these forests most

likely had their genesis at the bottom of a mug of grog, but a

few certainly come from close encounters with

octopus trees.

An octopus tree is a rubbery, black-barked

tree  that  roots  near  shore  and  stands

upright or floats with the currents on the

surface of the sea. Many long and numer-

ous broad black roots spread out around

its base like a thick mat of seaweed; these

roots are mobile and can propel the tree

with great speed across the surface of

the water. The trees branches are long,

thick  tentacles  covered  with  tiny,

sharp, dark green leaves. Hidden in

the base of the trees trunk just

below the water is a large maw

filled with teeth.

Octopus trees are rightfully

feared by sailors, for these ter-

rible plants command powerful

magical abilities that allow them

to wreak havoc on wooden ships.

Many large groves of octopus

trees  have  the  skeletons  of

ships lodged among their

roots, and many explorers

and  treasure  seekers

have been lured to their

doom in these danger-

ous groves.

Octopus  trees  under-

stand Common, but they

lack the body parts necessary

for speech.

COMBAT

Octopus trees gain a fair amount of nourishment from

photosynthesis, but without flesh, a tree ceases to grow in

size. These plants often dwell near the fringes of busy ship-

ping lanes; upon sighting a ship, they move quickly to inter-

cept it, using magic if necessary. They use their tentacles to

pluck food (passengers or crew) from the deck, eating one

or two morsels quickly and holding anyone else they grab

underwater so the victims drown. Octopus trees usually

occupy areas with heavy seaweed growth so they can use

their spell-like abilities to their full extent.

An  octopus  tree  can  be  summoned  using  a  summon

natures ally IX spell.

Frightful Presence (Ex): An octopus tree inspires

terror in all creatures within 30 feet that have fewer Hit

Dice or levels than it has. Each potentially affected oppo-

nent must succeed on a Will save (DC 19) or become

shaken, a condition that lasts until the opponent is out of

range. A successful save leaves that opponent immune to

that octopus trees frightful presence for one day.

Octopus tree

Improved Grab (Ex): If an octopus tree hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than

itself with a tentacle attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +28). If it gets a hold, it can trans-

fer the opponent to its maw with

another successful grapple check,

dealing automatic bite damage.

Alternatively, the octopus tree

has  the  option  to  conduct  the

grapple normally, or simply use its

tentacle to hold the opponent

(20 penalty on grapple check,

but  the  octopus  tree  is  not

considered grappled). In either

case, each successful grapple

check it makes during suc-

cessive rounds automati-

cally deals bite damage.

Spell-Like Abilities:

At willdiminish plants,

entangle, obscuring mist,

plant growth, warp wood;

3/daycall lightning,

turn  wood,  wall  of

thorns. Caster level

14th; save DC 12 +

spell level.

Swallow  Whole

(Ex): An octopus tree can

swallow  a  single  creature

that is at least two size cate-

gories smaller than itself by making a

successful grapple check (grapple bonus +28), provided it

already has that opponent in its maw (see Improved Grab,

above). Once inside the octopus tree, the opponent takes

2d6+9 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d4 points of acid

damage per round from the plants internal cavity. A suc-

cessful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to

climb out of the internal cavity and return to the octopus

trees maw, where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can

try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 20 points of

damage to the internal cavity (AC 22) in this way creates an

opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swal-

lowed creature exits, rapid growth closes the hole; thus,

another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. An

octopus trees cavity can hold 1 Large, 4 Medium-size, or 16

Small or smaller opponents.

Plant Traits (Ex): An octopus tree is immune to poison,

sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject

to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The creature also

has low-light vision.

Regeneration (Ex): An octopus tree takes normal

damage from fire and cold. Attack forms that dont deal

hit point damage ignore regeneration, and an octopus

tree does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Skills: Octopus trees have a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard and can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks,

even if distracted or endangered.

Ocularon

P

132

The ocularon is a paranoid, bizarre creature that steals the

sight of its foes. After claiming a territory as its own, it

drives all the other denizens out, no matter how small. Its

territory might only encompass a few rooms in an aban-

doned keep, but to the ocularon, this area is its sacred

stomping ground.

An ocularons body appears much like a sickly green

floating man-of-war jellyfish. It pulses and ripples due to

the tremendous amount of gas carried within it; some-

times a pocket of the gas just under the creatures skin

develops a leak, causing the gas to whistle as it slowly

escapes. Dangling from the floating body are a number of

barbed tendrils, upon which are skewered the eyes of the

ocularons former prey.

An ocularon can animate eyeballs it has captured and

send them out to keep tabs on its territory. Those who ven-

ture near an ocularon lair may first become aware of that fact

when they spot one of these floating eyeballs. By that time,

the ocularon has probably spotted the intruders as well, and

it immediately takes steps to attack, either to kill them or

drive them away.

Ocularons speak Common and Undercommon.

Combat

An ocularon usually begins an en-

counter at a great distance by

sending animated eyeballs at

its opponents. The eyes race

toward  the  creatures

foes  and  attempt  to

strike them, releas-

ing  a  cloud  of  the

foul gas carried with-

in the ocularon. If it

begins  to  run  low  on

eyes, it steals more from its

prey, grabbing opponents and

ripping their eyes out with its

barbed tendrils.

Animate Eyeballs (Su): An

ocularon  can  control  up  to  six

captured eyeballs at one time, as if

they were levitating eyes like those

created by a prying eyes spell. These

eyes are filled with the ocularons

toxic gas while skewered on the crea-

tures barbed tendrils, and the ocularon

can  also  use  them  as  weapons.  It  can

make a ranged touch attack against any

opponent within 80 feet. Success indicates the eye

impacts on the victim and explodes. Such characters take

3d6 points of damage and are exposed to the ocularons

poison (see below).

Death Throes (Ex): When killed, an ocularon explodes

in a cloud of toxic gas that deals 3d6 points of damage to

everything within 20 feet and exposes those victims to its

poison (see below).

Improved Grab (Ex): If an ocularon hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

tendril attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +17). If it gets a hold, it can

attempt to remove the opponents eyes on the following

round. Thereafter, the ocularon has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its tendril to hold the

opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the ocularon

is not considered grappled). In either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during successive rounds automat-

ically deals tendril damage.

Poison (Ex): An ocularon delivers its poison (Fort DC 19

negates) on each successful attack with an arcane eye or in

its death throes.Initial and secondary damage are the same

(1d4 Str plus 1d4 Con).

Spell-Like Abilities: At willarcane eye*; 3/day

darkness, invisibility, passwall, true seeing*. Caster level 12th;

save DC 13 + spell level.

The ocularon can only use its arcane eye and true seeing

spell-like abilities if it has eyes on its tendrils available to be

used as arcane eyes.

Steal Eyes (Ex): Once an opponent has been grappled

for 1 round, an ocularon can attempt to forcibly remove its

eyes. It must make an opposed grapple check to do so. If it

is successful, the victim must make a Fortitude save (DC

20) or be permanently blinded, its eyeballs removed from

its sockets. The eyeballs are now impaled on the ocularons

barbed tendrils and will fill with gas in 3 rounds, ready to

be used as weapons.

All-Around Vision (Ex): An ocularon can see in all

directions at once. Because of this, it has a +4 racial bonus

on Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked. An

ocularon only benefits from this ability when it has eyes

attached to its tendrils.

Blindsight (Ex): An ocularon is effectively blind, but it

maneuvers and fights as well as a sighted creature by using

its other senses (mostly hearing and scent, but also by

noticing vibration and other environmental clues). This

ability enables it to discern objects and creatures within 80

feet. The ocularon usually does not need to make Spot or

Listen checks to notice creatures within range of its blind-

sight. The ocularon relies on its blindsight only if it runs

out of eyes attached to its tendrils, which negates its all-

around vision.

Regeneration (Ex): An ocularon takes normal damage

from silver and keen weapons. Attack forms that dont

deal hit point damage ignore regeneration, and an ocu-

laron does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Malicious but servile, ophidians are a reptilian race most

commonly found as slaves of the yuan-ti. They look like large

snakes with humanoid arms and hands, and they have tails

that are short and stunted in proportion to their bodies. Their

scales are typically mottled green and yellow, with brown,

black, and red sometimes appearing in certain individuals.

Their scales naturally change color to help the creatures

blend into wooded or subterranean surroundings.

OPHIDIANS IN A FORGOTTEN REALMS

CAMPAIGN

Ophidians  originated  in  the  Forest  of  Wyrms,  though  they  do  not

live that close to human civilization anymore. According to yuan-ti

history, the ophidians descend from a human tribe from the Shining

Plains  that  devoted  itself  to  a  snake  cult.  Believing  in  the  ultimate

superiority  of  serpentkind,  these  humans  entered  the  Forest  of

pqqqqrs

Wyrms in search of relics from the yuan-ti kingdom that flourished

there in ancient times. Unleashing a powerful artifact, these humans

were transformed into serpent people and passed the curse onnot

only  to  their  children,  but  also  to  the  unfortunate  victims  of  their

bites.  They  are  now  found  primarily  in  the  Serpent  Hills,  but  they

occasionally  appear  anywhere  snakes  are  foundwhich  is  to  say

almost anywhere.

133

Ophidians speak Common and Yuan-Ti, and some learn

Draconic as well.

COMBAT

Ophidians are not bright, but they often fight under the

leadership of more intelligent creatures (such as nagas or

yuan-ti). They make good use of their natural camouflage to

attack with surprise, though their distaste for ranged

weapons makes that advantage less effective than it might

otherwise be. They can wield weapons comfortably in their

humanoid hands, but nevertheless ophidians love to bite

their victims, and they particularly delight in infecting

opponents with their serpentine curse. If it desires, an

ophidian can make its bite attack its primary attack and use

a weapon for its secondary attack.

Serpentine Curse (Su): Any humanoid hit by an ophid-

ians bite attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 11) or

contract a curse that will turn the victim into an ophidian.

Starting 1d4+1 days after infection, the victim slowly

becomes more snakelike: Its skin grows scaly, its legs begin

to shrink and fuse together, and its tongue becomes forked.

After two weeks, the victim is fully transformed into an

ophidian, with no memory of its previous existence. To stop

the transformation, the victim must receive a remove disease

or remove curse spell before the process is complete, although

these spells do not undo any transformation that has

already begun. A heal, regeneration, limited wish,

wish, or miracle spell is required to reverse the

transformation. Once the transformation is

complete, nothing short of a wish or miracle can

return the victim to its previous state.

Skills: Ophidians have a +8 racial bonus

on Climb checks and can always choose to

take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or

threatened. Ophidians have a +8 racial bonus

on any Swim check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard and can always choose

to take 10 on Swim checks, even if distracted

or endangered. *Ophidians also have a

+10 bonus on Hide checks in forests

or underground areas due to their

chameleonlike ability to alter their

skin tones.

Ophidian

OPHIDIAN CHARACTERS

An  ophidians  favored  class  is

fighter, and most high-level ophidians are

fighters. Ophidian clerics are almost un-

known, since ophidians rarely revere true

deities. Some ophidians worship nagas,

dragons, or giant snakes, and gain the

powers of the adept class

from  the  strength  of

their own faith in these

powerful reptiles.

Burrow (Ex): An oread can glide through stone, dirt, or

almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish

swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no

tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs

of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing

a burrowing oread flings the oread back 30 feet, stunning

the creature for 1 round unless she succeeds on a Fortitude

save (DC 19).

Earth Mastery (Ex): An oread gains a +1 bonus on attack

and damage rolls if her foe is touching the ground.

Mountain Dependency (Su): Each oread is mystically

bound to a mountain. If an oread strays farther than 1 mile

from her mountain, she dies within 4d6 hours.

Believed to be the insubstantial spirits of slain elementals,

phiuhls haunt the desolate cliffs of Gehennas first layer like

sentient columns of living steam.

Formed from an unholy amalgamation of misery, pain,

hunger, sweltering heat, and poisonous vapors, a phiuhl

resembles a swirling, churning miasma of green and violet

vapors. With concentration, an onlooker can make out a

roughly humanoid shape amid the chaos, with a suggestion

of long, spindly arms or a hint of a leering, elongated face

wracked with suffering.

Phiuhls normally travel in pairs, though that is the only

hint of any sort of racial identity among them. Whether or

Oread

her spells to bring disaster upon those

who would despoil it. Such mountains gain the reputation

of being cursed or evil, and that sometimes attracts the

attention of a tribe of evil humanoids or giants seeking a

refuge. Being a lawful creature, an oread will often strike a

bargain of mutual protection with such a tribe.

Oreads speak Dwarven, Sylvan, and Terran.

COMBAT

An oread uses its knowledge of stone and its skill with engi-

neering to create many deadly deadfalls and avalanche

points on its mountain. When confronted with foes, an oread

often charms one to lure the rest to a place where its traps can

have their greatest effect. The oread then triggers them from

hiding, hoping to kill, maim, or frighten its foes enough to

cause them to flee. More troublesome and determined foes

feel the full brunt of the oreads spellcasting powers.

An oread can be summoned using a summon natures ally

VI spell.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willstone tell, teleport (from

any point on its mountain to any other point on its moun-

tain); 3/daycharm monster, soften earth and stone, spike

stones, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to

mud; 1/dayearthquake, move earth. Caster level 14th; save

not they draw sustenance from their predations upon

mortals is a subject of much debate among scholars,

who occasionally manage to trap one or two on the

Material Plane for bizarre and twisted experi-

ments. Phiuhls serve no master, however; their

only goal seems to be to destroy any other kind

of creature they encounter.

Phiuhls speak no audible language, but

they appear to communicate with one

another.

PLANETOUCHED

Creatures that can trace their bloodlines back to an out-

sider are called planetouched. Because of their out-

sider heritage, planetouched have some unusual char-

acteristics, and these qualities appear in descendants

of the original planetouched creature for several

generations. Though the maeluth, mechana-

trix, shyft, and wispling presented below

share characteristics among themselves,

they tend to adopt the cultural beliefs

that they are born into.

COMBAT

A phiuhl knows it cant do much

damage  with  its  heat  touch,  so

instead it prefers to fly above its ene-

mies so that it can subject as many of

them as possible to its death gas

without risking melee. Thereafter,

it  swoops  in  for  desiccating

attacks until all its enemies

have been destroyed.

Death Gas (Ex): Any crea-

tures susceptible to poison with-

in 50 feet of a phiuhl must suc-

ceed on a Fortitude save (DC 18) or

take  1d10  points  of  Constitution

damage immediately and another

1d10 points of Constitution damage 1

minute later (unless another DC 18 Forti-

tude save is made). Those who save against

a phiuhls death gas are immune to that

phiuhls gas for one day.

COMBAT

Each of the planetouched described

in this section has a different set of

combat tactics. However, all have

one set of traits in common.

Outsider Traits: Planetouched

have darkvision (60-foot range),

and they cannot be raised or resur-

rected (though a wish or miracle spell

can restore life).

PLANETOUCHED

CHARACTERS

A maeluths favored class is cleric. A me-

chanatrixs favored class is fighter. Mechan-

atrixes that dont adventure are more likely

to be experts than commoners. A shyfts

favored class is rogue. A wisplings favored

class is rogue.

Phiuhl

Desiccate (Ex): Any character in a

square occupied by a phiuhl at the end of

the phiuhls turn must make a Fortitude save (DC 18)

or gain two negative levels. The saving throw to

remove one of these negative levels also has a DC of 18.

Heat Aura (Ex): Anyone within 30 feet of a phiuhl must

make a successful Fortitude save (DC 18) or take 1d6 points

of fire damage. Treat this effect as a burst that continually

radiates from the creature.

Gaseous Form (Ex): A phiuhls insubstantial form grants

it immunity to critical hits. A phiuhl cannot run, but it can

fly (slowly), and it is subject to winds. It cannot wear armor,

manipulate solid objects, or enter water or other liquids. It

can pass through small holes or narrow openingseven

mere cracks. It also can occupy squares occupied by enemies

(see Desiccate, above).

Inscrutable Mind (Ex): Any creature attempting to

establish a telepathic link to a phiuhls mind (via detect

thoughts, a psionic ability, dominate monster, and so on) must

make a Will save (DC 14) or suffer the effects of feeblemind

as cast by a 9th-level sorcerer.

Maeluths are planetouched descended from dwarves and

devils.

Maeluths look like sturdy dwarves with fiendish features

that hint at their devil-tainted ancestry. Common maeluth

features include red eyes, weirdly elongated fingers, and

nearly hairless bodies. Maeluths favor dark colors and often

wear spiked armor.

Although similar in many ways to their dwarf ancestors,

maeluths are more adept at social interaction because of

their fiendish blood. They often use their innate social skills

to attain powerful positions within dwarf society.

Maeluths speak Common, Dwarven, and Undercommon.

Combat

Maeluths are straightforward and orderly in combat. When

encountered in numbers, they employ sophisticated forma-

tions and strategies.

Dwarf Traits (Ex): A maeluth has a +1 racial bonus on

attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids, a +2 racial bonus on

saves against spells and spell-like abilities, a +2 racial bonus

on Fortitude saves against all poisons, and a +4 dodge bonus

against giants. It also has darkvision to a range of 60 feet,

stonecunning (+2 racial bonus on checks to notice unusual

stonework; can make a check for unusual stonework as

though actively searching when within 10 feet and can use

the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can; intuit

depth), and a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks and Craft

or Profession checks related to stone or metal.

Fiend Hammer (Su): Once per day, a maeluth can grant

a melee weapon the unholy special ability. This effect lasts

for 1 minute.

Mechanatrixes are planetouched who can trace their ances-

try to one of the bizarre clockwork beings that reside on the

plane of Mechanus.

Mechanatrixes are mostly human in appearance, but they

have one or more mechanical or inorganic features. Most

mechanatrixes have smooth skin with a faint metallic sheen.

They behave with cold rationality and have a no-nonsense

attitude toward life.

As befitting their nature, mechanatrixes have an affinity

for mechanical objects of all kinds. They have an innate

understanding of engineering and all sorts of crafts. The

more martial-minded mechanatrixes become excellent

siege engineers.

Like other planetouched beings, mechanatrixes never

quite fit into any society. Most human societies shun them,

while those from the plane of Mechanus believe them to be

tainted and impure. As a result, they are often loners, but

they are rarely bothered by this lack of social contact.

Most mechanatrixes are firm believers in law and do

whatever they can to fight chaos and bring order to tumul-

tuous areas.

Combat

Despite their prowess, mechanatrixes prefer to avoid

combat since they see it as destructive and wasteful. How-

ever, when they are forced to fight, they attack with

shrewd tactics.

Mechanatrixes are not only immune to electricity, but

they are actually healed by it. Because of this, they actively

goad an opponent that uses any electricity attack.

Shocking Grasp (Sp): A mechanatrix can use shocking grasp

once per day as cast by a sorcerer of 1st level or the mechana-

trixs character level, whichever is higher.

Electricity Healing (Ex): Because of a mechanatrixs

electricity affinity, any electricity attack directed at it cures 1

point of damage for each 3 points of damage it would other-

wise deal. The mechanatrix gets no saving throw against

electricity effects.

Skills: Mechanatrixes have a +2 racial bonus on Spot

checks and a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (architecture

and engineering) checks.

Shyfts are planetouched beings descended from one of the

native races of the Ethereal Plane. Belonging fully to neither

the Ethereal Plane nor the Material Plane, they have the

ability to move back and forth between both planes.

Shyfts appear as regular, unassuming humans. In fact,

almost everything about them is forgettable and easy to

overlook. They prefer to wear dark, simple clothing that

does not draw any attention. Shyfts do not seem to mind

that they are so inconspicuous and use it to their advantage.

They are excellent spies, since they can listen in on conver-

sations from the safety of the Ethereal Plane and sell any

information they hear to the highest bidder. Shyfts are also

known to specialize in assassination, thievery, and other

criminal pursuits.

Shyfts speak Common.

Combat

Shyfts rarely attack an opponent directly, since they prefer

to use stealth, ambush, and traps to win battles. They use

their ethereal jaunt ability to either lurk on the Ethereal

Plane, scouting for just the right moment to attack, or to flee

from a threat on the Material Plane.

Ethereal Jaunt (Sp): Once per day, a shyft can make an ethe-

real jaunt as if by a cleric of 9th level or its character level,

whichever is higher.

Skills: Shyfts have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move

Wisplings are planetouched descended from halflings

and demons.

With a heritage touched by demonic fire and chaos, this

offshoot of the halfling race embodies everything that is

small, quick, and deceptive. Wisplings rarely sit still, and

their pranks and jokes range from cruel to murderous.

A wisplings light brown skin, bright red hair, and angular

features set it apart from other Small humanoids. Although

their demonic heritage grants them abilities of stealth

beyond those of many other races, wisplings have a taste for

bright clothing that marks them in any crowd.

Wisplings speak Common.

Combat

Speed, instinct, and cruelty make wisplings far deadlier

than their size and slight frame would suggest. Wisplings

almost always strike from ambush and attempt to fade from

battle before being cornered by larger foes.

Change Self (Su): Wisplings can use change self once

per day, as the spell cast by a 1st-level sorcerer.

Halfling Traits (Ex): Wisplings have a +2 morale bonus

on saving throws against fear, a +1 racial bonus on all saving

throws, a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with a thrown

weapon, and a +2 racial bonus on Climb, Jump, Listen, and

Move Silently checks.

A quth-maren is a revolting undead creature created by

clerics of Kiaransalee. These clerics are fond of flaying

their enemiesremoving every scrap of skinand then

animating them in this hideous form.

A quth-maren appears in the overall form it had in life, but

it has no skin or exposed fatjust muscles over its skeleton.

Caustic blood constantly oozes from its body. Unlike zom-

bies, to which they bear a certain resemblance, quth-marens

are neither mindless nor prone to decomposition.

COMBAT

A quth-maren fights fiercely but cleverly, making the best

use of its spit blood attack and horrifying gaze attack before

closing with an opponent. In groups, quth-marens gang up

on a single enemy at a time, rather than distributing their

attacks among a group of opponents.

Caustic Blood (Ex): Any target hit by a quth-marens

slam attack takes 1d6 points of additional acid damage from

the creatures caustic blood. Creatures that hit a quth-maren

with natural weapons or unarmed attacks also take 1d6

points of acid damage.

Command Undead (Su): A quth-maren commands

undead as a 5th-level evil cleric. It cannot rebuke undead,

but it can dispel turning or bolster other undead.

Horrifying Gaze (Su): A living creature within 30 feet

that meets a quth-marens deathless gaze must succeed on a

rounds, as a standard action, a quth-

maren can spit a glob of its acidic

blood  as  a  grenadelike  weapon

attack. The quth-maren must

make a ranged touch attack to

hit its target. This attack

has a range increment of

10  feet,  with  a  maximum

range  of  five  range  incre-

ments. The glob deals 2d6

points  of  acid  damage  on  a

direct hit, and 2 points of acid

damage to all creatures within 5

feet of where it lands.

Fast Healing (Ex): A quth-

maren regains lost hit points at

the rate of 4 per round as long

as it has at least 1 hit point. Fast

healing does not restore hit points

lost from starvation, thirst, or suffo-

cation, and it does not allow a quth-

maren to regrow or reattach

lost body parts.

Turn  Resistance  (Ex): A

Quth-maren

quth-maren is treated as an undead with 2 more

Undead Traits: A  quth-maren  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or death

from massive damage. A quth-maren cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. A quth-maren has

darkvision (60-foot range).

COMBAT

Rilmani prefer not to involve

themselves in any kind of conflict

until the ramifications of that con-

flict can be ascertained. If aiding or hin-

dering one side will preserve the balance of

power and the existence of a middle ground,

rilmani are quick to act or to advise.

Rilmani use their polymorph self ability

to disguise themselves while they deter-

mine the alignments and motivations of

those  around  them.  If  an  imbalance  is

detected, rilmani often insert themselves

into the conflict in the guise of some

type of creature already involved.

Outsider Traits: Rilmani have darkvision (60-

foot range), and they cannot be raised or resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Rilmani Traits: Rilmani are immune to electricity and

poison, and they have acid and sonic resistance 20.

RILMANI

Some say the universe is composed of opposing forces,

elements, and ideas: good and evil, light and darkness,

heat and cold. Supposedly, the interaction between these

forces and concepts defines everything.

The rilmani would be quick to disagree with that contention.

Between all these forces and ideas, they say, exists a

middle groundneutrality, shrouding shadow, comfort.

The rilmani argue that these phenomena and concepts

are at the heart of the nature of existence, and conflict

Summon Rilmani (Sp): Rilmani can summon other ril-

mani as though casting a summon monster spell, but they

have varying degrees of success. Roll d% and compare the

result to the die range given in the rilmanis specific

description (if the summoning is not automatic): On a fail-

ure, no rilmani answer the summons. Summoned crea-

tures automatically return whence they came after 1 hour.

A summoned rilmani cannot use its own summon ability

for 1 hour.

Rilmani Characters

Most rilmani advance by increasing their Hit Dice, but

some choose to advance as characters. The favored class of

an aurumach is cleric. A cuprilachs favored class is rogue. A

ferrumachs favored class is fighter. A rilmani PCs effective

Aurumachs are the most powerful rilmani and the de facto

leaders of the race. Some cuprilachs and ferrumachs chafe

under this rule since the aurumachs sometimes use the

lesser rilmani as expendable pawns in their larger plans,

and their ability to block thought reading foils the lesser

rilmanis means of divining their ultimate purpose.

When aurumachs appear in their natural forms, they

resemble powerfully muscled, golden-skinned humanoids

the size of ogres. Unlike those foul creatures, aurumachs are

hairless and smooth-skinned. Their immaculate beauty and

calming presence puts most creatures at ease.

Aurumachs are the diplomats and strategists of the ril-

mani. When they become personally involved in an affair

of balance, it is because all covert means at their disposal

have failed. They appear unarmed and unarmored, openly

welcoming individuals to speak about the issues at hand

and resolve a way to find a middle ground. Should such

Combat

An aurumach rarely initiates combat, since it prefers to use

physical confrontation as a last resort. When it does enter

melee, it is a formidable foe that is capable of dealing great

damage with each deadly swing of its halberd. An aurumach

often flies above a foe and makes trip attempts, and it with-

holds the use of its antithesis ability and the full fury of its

attacks until it becomes clear the foe wont relent.

Antithesis (Su): Any creature that is hit by the auru-

machs  melee  attack  or  that  touches  it  with  a  natural

weapon or unarmed attack takes a certain kind of damage

depending on how its alignment varies from neutral.

Chaotic creatures take 2d6 points of lawful damage. Lawful

creatures take 2d6 points of chaotic damage. Evil creatures

take 2d6 points of holy damage. Good creatures take 2d6

points of unholy damage. Thus, a creature of chaotic good

alignment would take an extra 4d6 points of damage (2d6

lawful, 2d6 unholy) each time it was struck by the auru-

mach. An aurumach can suppress or resume the use of this

ability as a free action.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcharm monster, cone of cold,

greater dispelling, magic circle against chaos, magic circle against

evil, magic circle against good, magic circle against law, magic mis-

sile, mass suggestion, teleport without error (self plus maximum

load of objects only); 3/daydismissal, fly, forbiddance, heal,

mind blank, prismatic spray, true seeing. Caster level 17th; save

DC 18 + spell level.

Summon Rilmani (Sp): Once per day, an aurumach can

automatically summon 2d4 ferrumachs or 1d2 cuprilachs

(aurumachs choice).

Fast Healing (Ex): An aurumach regains lost hit points at

the rate of 5 per round as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation, and it does not allow an aurumach to

regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Summon Armor (Su): An aurumach rilmani wears no

armor, but when threatened by any attack, a semitranslu-

cent suit of golden +4 full plate appears on its body just in

time to help defend against the attack and then vanishes

immediately after. The appearance of this armor cannot be

prevented, but it can be suppressed in an antimagic field.

The armor never affects an aurumachs speed, weight car-

ried, or skill checks.

Summon Weapon (Su): An aurumach can be armed in

an instant by magically summoning a golden Huge +3 hal-

berd. When separated from the aurumach, the weapon

vanishes. An aurumach can summon or dispel its own

weapon as a free action.

Cuprilachs are the spies and assassins of the rilmani. When an

imbalance can be corrected by the removal of a specific indi-

vidual or small group, cuprilachs are sent in to take care of it.

Hairless like an aurumach, a cuprilach in its natural form

looks like a lithe and somewhat gaunt person with copper

skin, but few creatures ever get to see this form. A cuprilach

rarely travels without wearing layers of disguises.

Cuprilachs spin webs of lies and deceit like master bards

improvising great music. Confident and charismatic,

cuprilachs use their skills to infiltrate foes forces and

impersonate enemies. Individuals of unbalancing power are

sometimes  shocked  to  discover

that their most trusted confidant

or  cherished  loved  one  was

replaced by a cuprilach years

before the rilmani was given

the order to strike.

In  addition  to  Rilmani,

Common, and Undercommon,

cuprilachs speak Abyssal, Celes-

tial, and Infernal.

Combat

Cuprilach

Cuprilachs vary what tac-

tics  they  use  depending

upon  the  nature  and

urgency of their mission.

Most  cuprilachs  prefer

simple seek and destroy

missions  that  allow

them to use their magic

to locate a target and

get  close  before  unleashing  a

deadly hail of arrows. At other

times cuprilachs use their skills

to infiltrate an organization or an

individuals life, and then they ply

their victims with lies to lure the

rilmanis foes into a dangerous sit-

uation that eliminates them.

A cuprilach can be summoned using

a summon monster IX spell.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a

cuprilachs target is denied a Dexter-

ity bonus, or when a target is flanked

by a cuprilach, the cuprilach deals an

additional 3d6 points of damage on a

successful melee attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect thoughts, knock, locate

creature, Melf s acid arrow, misdirection, see invisibility; 3/day

dimension door, enervation, mislead, poison. Caster level 12th;

save DC 16 + spell level.

Summon Rilmani (Sp): Once per day, a cuprilach can

summon 1d3 ferrumachs with a 75% chance of success

(result of 26100 on d%).

Swift Strikes (Ex): A cuprilach can use a standard action

to make a full attack, firing all its arrows for the round

before the first hits its mark or stabbing several times with

its rapier before a foe has time to recognize it has been

struck. This ability makes the cuprilach fiendishly effective

in a surprise situation or when it strikes first in a combat,

since it can reveal itself and execute a full attack, dealing

sneak attack damage with each hit.

A cuprilach is fatigued for 1d4 rounds after using the

swift strikes ability, and it cannot use the swift strikes ability

while fatigued.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): As long as a cuprilach is within

10 feet of some sort of shadow, it can hide itself from view in

the open without anything to actually hide behind. It

cannot, however, hide in its own shadow.

Trap Sense (Ex): A cuprilach gains a +2 bonus on Reflex

saves made to avoid traps, and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor

Class against attacks by traps.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A cuprilach retains its Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or struck by an

insivible attacker, and it cannot be flanked except by a rogue

of 16th level or higher.

Skills: Cuprilachs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

Ferrumachs are the countless minions of the rilmani. They

serve as the foot soldiers in the never-ending battle to pro-

tect neutrality, the balance, and creatures rights not to

choose a side.

Ferrumachs look like powerfully muscled men made of

iron. They wear heavy full plate armor of a color similar to

their skin and wield shields and deadly lances. A ferru-

mach is almost never encountered on foot. Each rides a

kuldurath or a phantom steed conjured by magic. They

charge into battle astride these terrible creatures and

strike fear into their foes.

Ferrumachs appear on great battlefields, sometimes in the

guise of participants already involved in the conflict. Sent

there by aurumachs with an interest in the battles outcome,

the ferrumachs form a phalanx of their own and make cer-

tain the war ends the way the rilmani want or that it contin-

ues for as long as the aurumachs wish.

In addition to Rilmani, Common, and Undercommon,

ferrumachs speak Sylvan.

Combat

Although the most martial and aggressive of the rilmani,

ferrumachs would rather have creatures obey their com-

mands and observe rilmani ideals than fight them. Fer-

rumachs often attempt to intimidate and frighten away

foes before resorting to violence. Even so, ferrumachs

are well equipped to use force to carry out the auru-

machs orders.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a ferrumach can produce

a fear effect. This ability functions like a fear spell (caster

level 10th; save DC 19), except that it affects all creatures

within a 15-foot radius around the ferrumach. Any creature

that makes a successful saving throw against the effect

cannot be affected again by that ferrumachs fear aura for

one  day.  All  rilmani  and  any  creatures  the  ferrumach

chooses are immune to its fear aura.

The rukanyr is a heavily armored monster created by kaorti

wizards for the express purpose of laying waste to regions

the kaortis fear to enter. (The kaorti is described earlier in

this book.)

A rukanyr resembles an armor-plated, 15-foot-tall, leafless

tree, with one thick branch emerg-

ing from the top that ends in a ball

of spikes and jagged spines. The numerous smaller branches

end in grasping claws. Three large, stalked maws filled with

teeth are arrayed at the things base, amid a tangled mess of

thick insectoid legs. One large, lidless black eye stares out

from the things front side.

It is thought that the kaortis created the first rukanyrs

by exposing monstrous scorpions to energy from the Far

Realm. In fact, the kaortis were a bit too successful with

the rukanyr; the creatures are so destructive that the kaorti

do not allow them in their enclaves. A rukanyrs ability to

exist in natural settings makes it an ideal guard for the

regions surrounding a kaorti enclave, though; a concentra-

tion of rukanyrs almost always means that just such an

enclave is nearby.

Rukanyrs can speak Common.

COMBAT

A rukanyr starts any combat with a sundering roar directed

at the best-equipped of its enemies, then quickly wades into

the midst of melee and lashes out at any target within reach

of its attacks.

Poison (Ex): A rukanyr delivers its poison (Fort DC 20

negates) with each successful bite attack. Initial and second-

ary damage are the same (2d6 Dex).

Stunning Strike (Ex): Anyone hit by a rukanyrs slam

attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 18) or be

stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Sundering  Roar  (Su): Once  every  1d4  rounds,  a

rukanyr  can  emit  a  devastating  roar  from  one  of  its

mouths. All creatures within 60 feet of a rukanyr must

make Fortitude saves (DC 20) or be deafened for 2d6

rounds. Additionally, a rukanyr can target one creature or

object within this range to be the focal point of this

destructive attack. This creature or object takes 12d6

points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 20 half ). If

a creature is targeted, this damage also

applies to the armor worn and weapons

carried by a creature.

Fast Healing (Ex): A rukanyr re-

gains lost hit points at the rate of 5 per round.

Fast healing does not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, and it

does not allow a rukanyr to regrow or reat-

tach lost body parts.

Reflexive Sunder (Ex):

The armor plates that cover a

rukanyr shift and rub against

each other in combat, creating a

jarring sound like that of trees

rubbing together in a high wind.

Anyone who strikes a rukanyr with

a slashing or piercing melee attack

must make a Reflex save (DC

11) or the armor plates shift

and crush the weapon, dealing

the victims grasp. The weapon lands at the attackers feet if it

is not broken by the damage.

Stability (Ex): A rukanyr is incredibly stable and cannot

be tripped. It gains a +20 stability bonus on its Strength

check to avoid being bull rushed.

Skills: Rukanyrs have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if

rushed or threatened.

SARKRITH

The sarkrith wage a war that few understand. Beings of logic

and cold calculation, sarkriths cannot abide the unpre-

dictable although undeniably powerful forces of magic. To

the sarkrith, peace means control, and magic in the hands of

anyone is a symbol that the sarkrith do not have control.

The regimented society of the sarkriths has room for

other races aside from those tractable enough to be obedient

citizen-slaves.  Patient  and  deliberate,  the  long-lived

sarkriths never send soldiers into battle without planning

and forethought.

On most worlds, the sarkriths have yet to come into

real power. Their hidden subterranean city-states, while

powerful, do not yet hold the numbers of sarkriths neces-

sary to put the magic-wielding races surrounding them to

the sword.

COMBAT

Thanes and spelleaters have dramatically different

combat tactics. However, both have the following

abilities.

Mask Scent (Ex): Once per day, a sarkrith can

mask  its  scent,  which  prevents  it  from  being

detected with the scent ability. This ability lasts for

1 hour.

Scent (Ex): A sarkrith can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense

of smell.

9 feet tall. Spelleaters have light blue skin that dulls almost

to gray as they age.

Other creatures find it almost impossible to negotiate

with spelleaters. Spelleaters expect obedience from other

creatures, and they have a difficult time even grasping the

concept of an exchange of equals. One is simply stronger or

weaker than another, and thus the chain of command is

established. Since spelleaters are so obsessed with individ-

ual might, powerful creatures such as dragons sometimes

attempt to establish dominion over groups of them, but

spelleaters are never loyal to other racesin their eyes, all

nonsarkriths are tainted by magics foul touch.

Spelleaters speak Common, Draconic, and Infernal.

Combat

Spelleaters are as cold and calm about battle as they are

about everything else. Never seeming hurried and never

making decisions based on emotion, spelleaters always

direct thanes and their own attacks against spellcasters or

other individuals obviously using magic.

When fighting in groups, spelleaters coordinate their

attacks: Half their number strip their foes of magic with

their dispelling rays, while the others attack with their

bows.

Dispelling Ray (Su): Spelleaters can generate a ray that

cancels magical effects on anything it touches at will. The

spelleater must make a ranged touch attack against the

target. If the ray hits, it affects the target as a targeted greater

dispelling spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer.

Spell Absorption (Ex): Anytime a spell fails to beat a

spelleater s spell resistance, the spelleater gains hit

points equal to the level of the spell. These hit points first

heal damage that the spelleater has taken. Extra hit

points are treated as temporary hit points, and expire

after 1 minute.

Thanes are tasked with guarding the sarkrith protectorates

from physical attack. Like all sarkriths, thanes hate magic.

Fierce, loyal, and cruel, thanes understand nothing but

orders. When confronting those they deem less powerful,

they speak only in the imperative, and when dealing with

spelleaters and others that they have been bred to obey,

thanes respond with instant obedience.

Scaled humanoids with heavy, reptilian heads, sarkrith

thanes stand 9 feet tall and weigh close to 800 pounds.

Sarkrith thanes speak Common and Infernal.

Combat

Brutal and efficient in combat, sarkrith thanes use size and

numbers to crush smaller foes. Unless an adept orders oth-

erwise, thanes pick one foe (usually the closest) and concen-

trate their attacks until that foe is down; then they move to

the next foe. This simple tactic makes them predictable, if

dangerous, adversaries.

Adaptive Resistance (Ex): Any time a thane takes

damage from a spell or effect that deals energy damage, the

thane gains resistance 10 against subsequent attacks involv-

ing the same energy type. This resistance lasts for one day.

Adrenaline Boost (Ex): A thane can take an extra move

or attack action once during a round. A thane can use this

ability a number of times per day equal to its Constitution

bonus (9 for an average thane).

Antimagic Field (Su): Once per day as a free action, a

thane can create an antimagic field around itself. The field is

always centered on the thane and has a 5-foot radius. The

field lasts for a number of rounds equal to the thanes Con-

stitution bonus (9 for an average thane).

Sea drake

A sea drake is a solitary, intelligent, enigmatic creature. It

resembles the classical sea monster: serpentine body,

webbed flippers, dragonlike head. Belying its ferocious

appearance, it is quite intelligent and enjoys engaging the

crew members of passing ships in conversation. It is, how-

ever, fiercely territorial, and every ship that passes through

a sea drakes water must pay a toll. Those who pay buy the

creatures goodwill and protection; those who refuse incur

its wrath and invite destruction.

The toll is steep4d6100 gpbut paying it is the only

way to pass through a sea drakes territory unmolested.

And the toll doesnt merely buy protection against the sea

drake. These creatures consider it a point of honor to keep

their waters free of pirates, raiders, and other dangerous

sea monsters. Many sea captains consider the toll a bargain

compared to losing everything to pirates or slavers.

No one knows for sure what a sea drake does with its

treasure, but some presume that it hides the swag in secret

caves and grottoes on the sea floor. This treasure, com-

bined with the booty from pirate ships and merchant

ships sunk by the sea drake, makes a sea drakes territory

rich pickings for adventurers with the wherewithal to go

after the prize.

COMBAT

Against enemies in the water,

a sea drake can bite or slap

with its tail.

Constrict Ship (Ex):

Instead of crushing a ship

with its tail, a sea drake

can wrap its serpentine

body around all but the

largest ships and crush

them or drag them below

the waves automatically.

This  can  be  done  to  a

rowboat (1 round), keel-

boats  (3  rounds),  long-

ships (5 rounds), and sail-

ing  ships  (10  rounds).

Warships and galleys are

too large for a sea drake to

affect in this way.

Crushing Blow (Ex):

A sea drake can use its tail

flukes to smash a boat to

splinters. The ship is hit

automatically once every

10 rounds, taking tail smash

damage (between attacks the

sea drake is submerged). The ships

pilot must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20) after each

hit to keep the vessel from being breached and sinking in

1d10 minutes. Apply a modifier to the DC based on the

type of ship: rowboat +4, keelboat +2, sailing ship or long-

ship +0, warship 3, galley 5. Regardless of the ships

saving throw result, characters aboard the ship must make

Reflex saving throws (DC 20); a successful save means the

character takes 1d4 points of damage; on a failed save, a

character on deck is hurled overboard and a character

belowdecks takes 2d4 points of damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): A sea drake can swallow whole

any creature at least one size category smaller than itself

that it successfully attacks with its bite while in the

water. First the sea drake must hold the creature in its

mouth with a successful grapple check (grapple bonus

+36). A second successful grapple check on the following

round means the creature is swallowed whole. Once

inside the sea drake, the creature must make Swim checks

(DC 15) every round as if it was in turbulent water. Suc-

cess means it takes 1d3 points of subdual damage but can

attack the sea drakes insides; failure means it takes 1d6

points of subdual damage and it must make another

Swim check immediately to avoid drowning. (The crea-

ture cannot attack when avoiding drowning.) A success-

ful grapple check allows the swallowed creature to climb

out of the stomach and return to the sea drakes

maw, where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swal-

lowed creature can try to cut its way

out with either claws or a light

piercing or slashing weapon.

Dealing a total of at least 35

points of damage to the stom-

ach  (AC  20)  in  this  way

causes the sea drake to dis-

gorge the entire contents

of  its  stomach.  A  sea

drakes stomach can hold

2 Large, 4 Medium-size,

or 16 Small or smaller

opponents.

Dragon  Traits: Sea

drakes  are  immune  to

sleep and paralysis effects.

They have darkvision (60-

foot range) and low-

light vision.

Ink Cloud (Ex): If

the  sea  drake  feels  it

needs to escape, it can

cloud the water around

it with ink. This

acts just like a

darkness spell

under water with

a 50-foot radius and

a duration of 5 minutes.

Level Adjustment: +1

Regeneration (Ex): A sea drake takes normal

damage while out of water. Attack forms that dont deal

hit point damage ignore regeneration, and the sea drake

does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or

suffocation. If a sea drake loses a limb or body part, the

lost portion regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can

reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to

the stump. Severed parts that are not reattached wither

and die normally.

Skills: Sea drakes have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and

can always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if dis-

tracted or endangered.

Appearing as humanoids when on land and seals in the

sea, selkies are shapechangers with purported fey ances-

try whose dealings with nonfey are often tinged with

tragedy.

In seal form, a selkie looks just like a normal seal,

though its eyes usually betray a hint of its intelligence. In

humanoid form, selkies resemble very attractive humans,

usually with gray hair and eyes and very pale skin.

Selkies feel a deep curiosity about land dwellers that

often leads to marriage. The union of a human and a selkie

rarely ends happily, however, since the selkie partner is

eventually overcome with longing to return to the sea,

abandoning the human partner and any children of the

148

union. Half-selkies are human in every significant respect,

but may have slightly webbed hands and feet.

Selkies speak Common and Aquan.

COMBAT

Selkies in their natural form attack by biting their oppo-

nents, but they are not strong and do not prefer melee. In

human form, they wield weapons forged of mithral and

wear mithral armor.

Alternate Form (Su): A selkie has only limited control

over its shapechanging abilities. When in the ocean, it is in

seal form; when on land, it is in humanoid form. Only at

the in-between placesshallow waters at the coast, a

narrow strip of beachcan a selkie choose which form to

use. Changing form is a free action. Equipment a selkie in

humanoid  form  is  wearing  or  carrying  transforms  to

become part of its seal form, and magic items cease func-

tioning while it remains in this form.

Skills: Selkies have a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard and can

always choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if distracted

or endangered.

SELKIE CHARACTERS

A selkies favored class is bard. Selkie clerics often do not

choose to worship a particular deity, but have access

to the domains of Healing, Protection, and Water.

If the cleric chooses to worship a specific

deity, the character has access to the

deitys domains instead.

A selkie PCs effective character

level (ECL) is equal to its class

level +4. Thus, a 1st-level selkie

bard has an ECL of 5 and is the

equivalent of a 5th-level character.

Senmurvs are intelligent creatures that are ferocious

defenders of good. They commonly act as mounts, scouts,

and  guardians  for  nonevil  humanoids  such  as  elves,

dwarves, and gnomes.

Senmurvs have the head, body, and clawed back paws of

a dog, with two feathery wings in place of the dogs front

paws. They are vibrantly colored, and no two have the

same pattern. The eyes of a senmurv are gem-colored, usu-

ally sapphire blue, ruby red, or emerald green, and do not

have pupils.

Senmurvs have been known to provide aid to human-

oids in distress, especially those under attack by evil crea-

tures. Able to sense both good and evil, senmurvs are very

particular about whom they assist, and they become

enraged if they discover duplicity or betrayal among those

they are assisting.

Senmurvs speak Sylvan and can understand, but not

speak, Common.

COMBAT

Senmurv

Senmurvs are experts at diving into combat for deadly strikes

before retreating to safety. They typically strafe an opponent a

few times before closing into melee. When they do, they latch

on with both claws and rend, dealing terrible damage.

A senmurv can carry a rider and gear weighing no more

than 200 pounds. Senmurvs do not tolerate saddles well, so

the rider must learn to do without.

149

Rend (Ex): If a senmurv hits a single target with both

claws, it latches onto the opponents body and tears the

flesh. This attack deals 2d6+6 points of damage.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day a senmurv can make a

normal attack to deal additional damage equal to its HD

total (maximum of +20 additional damage) against an

evil foe.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect good, detect evil.

Scent (Ex): A senmurv can detect approaching enemies,

sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Long ago, the shadar-kai thought to preserve the world

from the rising humanoid races. Skilled in shadow magic,

the shadar-kai made a pact with a dark power of the Plane of

Shadow to cast the world into an endless twilight in which

the shadow fey would rule supreme. But the experiment

went awry, and the shadar-kai were left bound to the Plane

of Shadow, cursed to lose their souls in its dark depths. This

shadow curse affects shadar-kai to this day, and every

member of the race is engaged in a lifelong struggle to stave

off inevitable doom.

The continuous pull of the Plane of Shadow has left the

shadar-kai grim and embattled. Few races understand the

plight of the shadow fey. Even the temporary solutions the

shadar-kai have found leave them struggling with con-

stant pain, making them vicious. Their willingness to

commit acts of cruelty and violence has increased with

each generation.

Shadar-kai speak Common, Elven, and Sylvan.

COMBAT

Cursed and blessed with a great affinity for the Plane of

Shadow, the shadar-kai are subtle and deceptive. They

steal without being detected when they can, striking

from ambush when necessary. Spellcasters among the

shadar-kai favor shadow and illusion magic, and few

groups of the shadow fey are without a powerful spell-

casting leader. Skilled at stealth and gifted with visual

acuity greater than that of most other creatures, the

shadar-kai have little trouble making sure that combat

occurs on their terms.

The shadar-kai described in the statistics block wears a +1

Spot +8, Survival +6 (+8 following tracks)

gal-ralan (see Shadar-Kai Items, below).

Feats: Alertness, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked

chain) (B), Weapon Finesse

Climate/Terrain: Any forest and underground (Plane

of Shadow)

Organization: Solitary, patrol (36), or raid (712)

Challenge Rating: 1

Treasure: +1 gal-ralan plus standard

Alignment: Usually neutral evil

Advancement: By character class

Level Adjustment: +1

The shadar-kai, or shadow fey, are a race of bitter, deter-

mined folk whose souls are poisoned by shadow. Gray-

skinned and dark-eyed, the slender shadar-kai stand

slightly taller than average humans, and their soft move-

ments exude grace and uncanny stealth. Shadow follows

the shadar-kai wherever they go. Shadows cast by the folds

of their clothing seem deeper than those on humanoids,

and a shadar-kai can seemingly fade out of sight by simply

stepping into any common shadow.

The shadar-kai prefer light weapons suited for grace and

agility, especially spiked chains. Many shadar-kai favor a

variety of piercings and tattoos.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a shadar-kais target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a

shadar-kai, the shadar-kai deals an additional 1d6 points of

damage on a successful melee attack. This damage stacks

with sneak attack damage from other sources, such as

rogue levels.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): Shadar-kai can use the Hide

skill even while being observed. As long as they are not

illuminated by natural daylight, the daylight spell, or a

similar magical light, shadar-kai can hide themselves

from view in the open without having anything to actu-

ally hide behind.

Shadow Curse (Su): The Plane of Shadow exerts a

tremendous pull on shadar-kais soul, which is only tenu-

ously connected to its mortal body. Any time a shadar-kai

is stunned, dazed, staggered, or unconscious (other than

from natural sleep), the shadow fey must make a Will save

(DC 15) or lose a portion of her soul to the Plane of

Shadow. The shadar-kai must also attempt a save any time

she removes a gal-ralan, if she has one (see Shadar-Kai

Items, below).

A shadar-kai with a damaged soul gains one negative

level that cannot be removed until she restores her soul

completely. If exposed to another event that requires a

save against the shadow curse, a shadar-kai may gain addi-

tional negative levels. A shadar-kai on the Plane of Shadow

can transfix her soul to her body again with a greater restora-

tion spell. A shadar-kai on the Material Plane (or else-

where) must use a wish or miracle spell to

restore her soul.

A  shadar-kai  afflicted

with the shadow curse can-

not be raised from the dead or resur-

rected, and cannot gain experience.

The touch of the shadow curse galls a

shadar-kai, filling her heart with an icy

emptiness that eventually drives all but

the most determined individuals to

capitulate  and  leave  the  Material

Plane altogether.

A shadar-kai who goes to the

Plane of Shadow and remains

there ameliorates the effects

of the shadow curse and suf-

fers no ill effects. However, if she

leaves the Plane of Shadow with-

out restoring her soul, she suf-

fers the effects of the shadow

curse until she returns to the

Plane of Shadow or restores

her soul.

Superior  Low-Light

Vision (Ex): Shadar-kai

have extraordinary vision

in  low-light  conditions.

They can see four times as

far as a human in low-light

conditions.

Skills: *Shadar-kai have a

kill those fey unlucky enough to cross their path. Occasion-

ally shadar-kai make alliances with other evil fey, usually to

deceive or infiltrate a population of good humanoids.

SHADAR-KAI ITEMS

The shadow curse haunts every aspect of shadar-kai cul-

ture, and remaining on the Material Plane is a

constant struggle for these creatures. Most

shadar-kai use a gal-ralan (described below)

to fix their souls to their bodies and stave off

the shadow curse.

Gal-Ralan: When this cold-forged iron arm-

band is donned (taking up the spot where a

bracer would be worn), it pierces the wearers

forearm with long needles of the same metal.

The device fixes its wearers

soul to her body but also causes

never-ending pain. As long as a

character wears a gal-ralan, she takes

1  point  of  Constitution  damage  that

cannot be healed until after the gal-

ralan is removed.

Shadar-kai

A gal-ralan provides its wearer

with a +1 to +5 resistance bo-

nus  on  her  saving  throws.

This bonus increases by an

additional +2 against death

effects,  energy  drains,  and

effects that affect the wearers

soul (such as the shadow curse).

For example, a +2 gal-ralan pro-

vides a +4 resistance bonus

against these effects, a +3 gal-

ralan provides a +5 resistance

bonus against these effects,

and so on.

+10 racial bonus on Hide checks made in dark or shadowy

conditions (anything other than daylight or the area of a

daylight spell).

SHADAR-KAI SOCIETY

The shadar-kai have developed a predatory society. They

have few permanent cities of their own but can often be

found in other settlements. The cities built by humans and

other intelligent races have little chance of keeping out a

determined group of shadar-kai infiltrators because such

cities are full of shadows.

The few shadar-kai cities that remain on the Material

Plane are concealed by illusions and shadow magic, and

well guarded by bands of shadar-kai scouts leading shadow

mastiffs. Many shadar-kai have been subsumed into the

Plane of Shadow, and even the greatest cities of the shadar-

kai are desolate, sparsely populated places.

Most shadar-kai realms are magocracies, ruled by power-

ful illusionists. Shadar-kai hate other fey, and they hunt and

Blackstone Rune: Shadar-kai overcome by the shadow

curse often make use of the blackstone rune. The rune is a

complex sigil drawn on a small, glossy stone. On command,

a blackstone rune allows its bearer to plane shift between the

Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane (in either direc-

tion), along with up to 50 pounds of objects. A blackstone

rune can be used three times before its magic fades.

ment (40% miss chance) against creatures without low-

light vision, one -half concealment (20% miss chance)

SHADAR-KAI CHARACTERS

A shadar-kais favored class is rogue. Although rogues are

by far the most common characters among the shadow fey,

many other shadar-kai become wizards or clerics. Few

shadar-kai are strong in melee combat, so they rarely do

well as fighters, rangers, monks, or barbarians.

Due to their starting Hit Dice and unique powers, a

shadar-kais effective character level (ECL) is +4. Thus, a 1st-

level shadar-kai rogue has an ECL of 5 and is the equivalent

of a 5th-level character.

Shadow asps are dark versions of their more common reptil-

ian cousins. They often guard the tombs of kings and other

important members of royal families. Naturally observant,

quiet, and capable of creating even more guards, they are

perfectly suited to this task.

The average shadow asp measures 4 feet long. Its dark,

scaled body often seems nearly translucent due to the

potential the creature has to become incorporeal. No pattern

adorns its scales, making the creature nearly invisible in the

gloomy surroundings it favors.

Thought to have originated on the Plane of Shadow,

shadow asps quickly found a niche on the Material Plane

as watchdogs at the tombs of pharaohs and other great

leaders, which is where theyre most often encountered.

Clutches might also be found near portals to the Plane of

Shadow or in out-of-the-way Underdark locales.

COMBAT

Shadow asps are smarter than normal snakes, and anyone

observing their tactics can easily see this. They use their

ability to become incorporeal to mob intruders in the

tombs theyre set to guard, emerging to bite from the walls,

floors, and even ceilings. They prefer to bite and

then flee, instinctively aware that their venom

takes time to work, then returning to strike

and flee again. They are often accompanied

in  battle  by  the  shadows  of  slain

intruders of the past.

Create  Spawn  (Su): A

creature slain by a shadow

asps poison rises as a shadow

in 1d2 days. Such a shadow is

considered uncontrolled,

but  it  is  bound  to  the

area, usually a tomb or

crypt, as a guardian,

unable to stray more

than  100  feet  from

the spot where it was

first spawned.

Poison  (Ex): A

shadow asp delivers

its poison (Fort

DC  12  negates)

with each success-

ful bite attack. Initial and

secondary damage are the same (1d6 Str).

Incorporeal Form (Su): A shadow asp can become

incorporeal for up to 1 hour per day. It can activate this

ability at will (a free action), and

the time of use need not be con-

tinuous.  While  incorporeal,  a

shadow asps Armor Class is 17

(+2 size, +5 Dex). The shadow asp

cannot deal damage to corporeal

opponents.  The  creature  has  a

50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except

for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch

weapons. An incorpo-

real shadow asp can

pass through solid ob-

jects,  but  not  force

effects, at will. Its attacks

ignore  natural  armor,

armor, and shields, but

deflection bonuses and force

effects work normally against

them. A shadow asp always moves

silently while incorporeal and can-

not be heard with Listen checks if

it doesnt wish to be.

Skills: A shadow asp has a +10

racial bonus on Hide checks

due to its natural cam-

ouflage, and a +5

racial  bonus  on

Listen and Spot checks due

to its natural vigilance. Shadow

asps also have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can

always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed

or threatened.

Shedu

A close cousin to the lammasu (see

the Monster Manual), the shedu

travel throughout the Material,

Ethereal, and Astral Planes ex-

tolling the virtues of law

and goodness and help-

ing those in need of in-

struction  or  protection.

From the neck down, shedim

(the  plural  form)  resemble  immense

winged bulls with well-developed muscles and a fifth leg

between and behind the two forelegs. The stoic creatures

have human heads with elaborately braided beards and

long, bristly black hair worn in tight curls. Shedim bear a

regal, somewhat detached mien, as if the gilded crown

each wears marks them as kings. If the creatures once

held terrestrial kingdoms, those lands have most likely

faded into history; the shedim do not speak of their

crowns to anyone.

Lawful good clerics sometimes call to the shedim, asking

for council on matters of planar import or to guard their

temples during important events such as the selection of a

new leader or the delivery of a messianic child. Shedim

have detail-oriented brains of superior construction

their immunity to mind control and their ability to focus

on specific tasks without distraction make them excellent

advisors and guards.

Shedim speak Common, Draconic, and Celestial. They

prefer to communicate telepathically.

COMBAT

Despite their ability to trample opponents under powerful

hooves, shedim make poor physical combatants against

skilled foes. In such cases, they prefer to take to the air,

153

from where they attempt to control enemies using dominate

person. Should things get chancy, they jump to the Ethereal

Plane or depart to the Astral Plane.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willclairaudience/clairvoyance,

see invisibility, telekinesis; 3/daydominate person. Caster level

9th; save DC 13 + spell level.

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a shedu can run over opponents at least one size cat-

egory smaller than itself. This attack deals 2d6+4 points of

bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 18) for half damage.

Depart (Su): Once per week, a shedu may cast astral

projection as an 18th-level sorcerer. The ability affects only

the shedu.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su): A shedu can shift from the Ethereal

Plane to the Material Plane as a free action, and shift back

again as a move action. This ability is otherwise identical

with ethereal jaunt cast by a 15th-level sorcerer.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): A shedu radiates a con-

tinuous magic circle against evil that affects a 20-foot radius.

The aura can be dispelled, but the shedu can create it again

as a free action on its next turn.

Rational Mind (Ex): A shedus superior brain renders it

immune to mind-affecting effects.

Uncanny Stability (Ex): A shedus five legs grant it

increased stability, rendering it immune to being pushed

back as the result of a bull rush. The ability also prevents

pushes from spells such as Bigbys forceful hand.

Skills: Shedim have a +8 racial bonus on Balance, Listen,

Knowledge (the planes), and Spot checks.

Once members of the underprivileged caste of an ancient

empire, the humans who would become skulks withdrew

from the world through a magical ceremony that solidified

their untouchable status. The ritual granted them natural

camouflage, allowing the skulks to blend in perfectly with

their surroundings.

Skulks stand 5 to 6 feet tall and are devoid of hair. They

wear clothing only when forced to. It is difficult to deter-

mine, at first glance, whether a given skulk is male or

female. A skulks gray skin feels like soft leather, and it can

change color at the creatures whim, from the most sub-

dued brows to the most lurid reds and yellows. Sometimes

a skulk assumes a natural human flesh tone and wears

clothing to better blend in with human society. Their deep

blue eyes lack pupils, and remain an identifying feature no

matter what coloration a skulk assumes.

Many skulks are prone to outlandish acts of violence, and

those skulks best able to prove their proficiency in the ways

of silent murder generally lead skulk communities. Those

few who somehow manage to resist their innate vio-

lent tendencies attempt to survive by haunting the

outskirts of human encampments, scrounging

food  and  supplies  whenever  possible.

Hated by skulks and humans alike, the

pathetic creatures usually die at the

hands of an angry mob.

Skulks speak a bastardized ver-

sion of Common, rife with words

and concepts from long-dead

human cultures.

SKULK CHARACTERS

Skulks prefer to hide from opponents, waiting for a group of

enemies to split up before picking off the weakest of the

bunch. They dont hesitate to use a coup de grace on fallen or

helpless victims. Skulks never attack when outnumbered.

Innate Nondetection (Su): Skulks are difficult to detect

by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate

creature, detection spells, and items such as a crystal ball. If a

divination is attempted upon a skulk, the caster of the div-

ination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster

level) against DC 20.

Peerless Camouflage (Ex): Skulks can move at full

speed (and can even run) while hiding, taking no penalties

on Hide checks due to movement.

Trackless Path (Ex): The DC of any Survival check to

Though common skulks doubtless provide a nuisance to

adventurers, members of the race really come into their own

with levels of rogue, their favored class. Skulk leaders tend

to be rogue/assassins or rogue/shadowdancers, and fre-

quently offer the services of their coterie to unscrupulous

clients eager to have someone killed.

SKULK SOCIETY

Skulks gather in small bands known as coteries. Led by the

most ruthless and calculating of the members (usually an

assassin or shadowdancer), coteries generally live within

stalking distance of a human town or city, either in a

nearby cave or below the streets in sewers or forgotten

basements. Skulks hide by day, but emerge at night to steal

food and other necessities.

Such raids often result in fantastic violence, because

skulks revel in bloodletting. Skulks seem to prefer killing

individuals of wealth and status, as if in retribution

against those who ostracized their ancestors so many

years ago.

Most humans who view a skulk murder scene jump to

conclusions about ghost cults, for the creatures seldom

leave any trace of their coming or leaving. Skulks who allow

prey to track them to the lair of their coterie face swift, fatal

discipline from the bands ruthless leader.

Skulks have managed to survive as parasites in human

civilization due to a strong self-preservation instinct that

other races often misidentify as cowardice. A skulk values

its own life above and beyond anything else; cases of skulk

mothers abandoning their young to escape a dangerous sit-

uation are not uncommon. Such abandoned children fetch

enormous prices from slavers, who sell them to unscrupu-

lous folk who then raise the children as the perfect unde-

tectable thieves and silent killers.

The skybleeder is a terrible nightmare created by kaorti

wizards to serve as mounts. (The kaorti is described earlier

in this book.) When not serving as mounts, they drift

lazily in the sky, miles above ground. They descend only

to feed or to amuse themselves by tormenting ground-

based victims.

Those attacked by a skybleeder rarely get a good look at

the creature, since it constantly surrounds itself with yel-

lowish white mist that rains a torrent of burning red acid.

Pale yellow tentacles and long chitinous claws that extend

from the mist provide a hint as to what lurks within the

cloud. If this cloud cover is pierced, a skybleeder is

revealed to be a horrifying tangle of hair and eyes and

wormlike tendrils. Its three claws are arrayed around its

equator, while its eight yellow tentacles trail below like a

jellyfishs tendrils. The creature is naturally buoyant in air,

155

and it can maneuver with great ease in the sky by venting

blasts of air out numerous openings in its body.

When a kaorti uses a skybleeder as a mount, it first lashes

a 5-foot-diameter platform (usually made of wood) to the top

of the skybleeders body. The kaorti then sits upon this plat-

form, strapping itself in place with a large number of ropes

and cords. A kaorti guides its skybleeder through voice

commands and gestures. Skybleeders are quite intelligent

and must be treated with respect by anyone who wishes to

use one as a mount, lest the rider suddenly find himself

attacked miles above the ground.

Skybleeders almost always prefer to communicate in

Kaorti, although they understand Common and Sylvan

as well

COMBAT

A skybleeder doesnt always initiate combat to

slay or find food. Often, it simply attacks ground-

based targets simply for the joy of causing pain and panic.

These idle attacks usually involve the unleashing of acid

rain or the use of spell-like abilities from afar. A skybleeder

only resorts to physical attacks in matters of self defense, to

secure food (it particularly relishes the flesh of fey), or at the

behest of its rider. Its claws can inflict deep, bloody wounds,

and its tentacles are coated with acid.

Acid Rain (Su): The tentacles of a skybleeder con-

stantly weep a slimy red acid. The sight of this acid

raining from the mist that surrounds the creature is

what prompted its name. This acid does 2d4 points of

acid damage per round to any living creatures the skybleeder

hovers above or flies over (Reflex DC 19 half ); the acid

becomes inert right after it deals damage, so a target is only

affected for as long as the skybleeder remains overhead.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check with a

tentacle, a skybleeder can constrict a grabbed opponent,

dealing 1d4+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacle

deals an additional 1d4 points of acid damage each round to

a creature it constricts.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a skybleeder hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a ten-

tacle attack, it deals normal damage plus acid damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +25). If it gets a hold,

it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the sky-

bleeder has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or

simply use its tentacle to hold the opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but the skybleeder is not considered

grappled). In either case, each successful grapple check it

No Discernible Anatomy (Ex): A skybleeder is immune

to critical hits and cannot be sneak attacked or flanked.

Regeneration (Ex): A skybleeder takes normal dam-

age from fire and force effects. Attack forms that dont

deal hit point damage ignore regeneration, and a sky-

bleeder does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Unnatural Mist (Su): A skybleeder constantly sur-

rounds itself with an unnatural white mist to a radius of 60

feet. This mist grants a skybleeder a +10 circumstance

bonus on Hide checks and affords it three-quarters con-

cealment (30% miss chance) against attacks against it from

foes outside the mist.

Those inside the mist find that they can see through it

clearly.

Those within the unnatural mist gain spell resistance 22

against druid magic. The mist can be dissipated by strong

winds, but it reforms naturally in 2d6 rounds after the winds

die down.

Though  the  red  slaad  is

thought by many to be

the weakest member

of the race, this is

not true. The mud

slaad is an even lower

creature. Derided by

some of its more pow-

erful relatives, the mud

slaad is still a challeng-

ing opponent for many groups

of adventurers.

Mud slaad

Mud  slaadi  stand

about 5 feet tall and

weigh  around  170

pounds.  Their  skin

varies  in  tone  through

shades of brown to a sickly

brownish green. They have

a slaads characteristic wide

mouth full of sharp teeth, and strong, sharp talons on the

ends of long, spindly arms.

AS

Mud slaadi are insecure and cowardly creatures. They

have a strong survival instinct, though, and often find ways

to stay alive even in the face of overwhelming odds.

Mud slaadi speak the language of slaadi.

Mud slaadi usually begin combat with their sonic screech or

with an attempt to summon more slaadi. If faced with odds

they find overwhelming, they try to cower or feign death.

A mud slaad can be summoned using a summon monster

VI spell.

Cringe (Su): As a standard action, a mud slaad can cower

in fear. This is a mind-affecting effect. Any opponent

attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the cring-

ing creature, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will

save (DC 12). If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack

normally and is immune to the effect of that mud slaads

cringing for 24 hours. If the save fails, the opponent cant

follow through with the attack, that part of the attackers

action is lost, and the attacker cant directly attack the mud

slaadi for as long as it continues to cringe. If the mud slaad

stops cringing and then cringes again, the opponent may

attempt a new Will save to attack it.

Disease (Ex): Any creature hit by a mud slaads bite

attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be

infected with a disease that transforms the victim over the

next week into a mud slaad. The infected creature

can attempt a new save each day (DC 15) to

throw off the infection.

Sonic Screech (Su): Once per day,

a mud slaad can emit a tremendous

screech. Every creature within 30

feet must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 15) or take 5d6 points of

sonic damage.

Summon Slaad (Sp): Once

per day a mud

slaad  can  at-

tempt to sum-

mon 1 mud slaad

with a 40% chance

of success (result

of 61100 on d%) or

1  red  slaad  with  a  20%

chance of success (result of

81100 on d%).

Fast Healing (Ex): A mud slaad

regains lost hit points at the rate of 3

per round. Fast healing does

not restore hit points lost

from starvation, thirst,

or suffocation, and it

does  not  allow  a  mud

slaad to regrow or reattach lost body parts.

Feign Death (Ex): If an opponent strikes a mud slaad

and reduces it to 10 or fewer hit points, it can immediately

attempt to feign death. This ability comes into use on the

opponents turn. Any creature that witnesses a mud slaad

that is feigning death, including those creatures that

watch it fall, can make a Sense Motive check (DC 22) to

157

determine if the slaads death is genuine. A Spot check will

not reveal that the slaads

death  is  feigned,  and

even a Heal or Search

check  isnt  guaran-

teed to discover the

deception, so adroit

is the mud slaad

at  stilling  its

breathing

and  re-

ducing its heart rate.

A  successful  check  using

either skill (DC 22) is required to reveal that the mud slaad

still lives.

Slasrath

Outsider Traits: A mud slaad has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish

or miracle spell can restore life).

Resistances (Ex): All slaadi have acid, cold,

electricty, and fire resistance 5.

The slasrath was originally a nearly mindless wormlike

predator until a nameless sorcerer discovered how to trans-

form them into the flying horrors that they are today.

Most slasraths are black, but gray and green varieties

arent uncommon. They have wormlike bodies with large,

razor-edged wings that run nearly their entire length, giving

them the appearance of a manta ray. The creatures lamprey-

like mouth is located on its underside. The slasraths tail is

long and whiplike with a barb at its tip.

Created by magic, most

slasraths  now  serve  as

mounts  for  yugoloths.

These mounts are magi-

cally controlled and are

outfitted with special har-

nesses to allow their mas-

ters to ride them with ease.

Nevertheless, one some-

times bucks its

e n c h a nt -

ment and

e s c a p e s

into the wild.

COMBAT

A slasrath has little interest

in tactics, apart from using its

razor-edged wings to tear through

the armor of its prey. The creature

usually fights to the death.

Poison (Ex): A slasrath delivers its

poison (Fort DC 18 negates) with each suc-

cessful sting attack. Initial damage is 1d4 Str

plus 1d4 Dex; secondary damage is 2d6 Con.

Wing Slash (Ex): If a slasrath charges, it can end the

charge with a wing slash attack. The slasrath makes a +9

melee attack against each creature it threatens at the end

of its charge. Each creature hit takes 3d6+10 points of

damage. Additionally, if an armor wearing creature takes

damage  from  this  attack,  the  creature  must  make  a

Reflex saving throw (DC 19) or the armor is shredded

away instantly.

A spectral lurker waits in the dark places where only the

brave and foolhardy go. Drawn to a dungeon, an abandoned

keep, or a cavernous space, a lurker bides its time, hoping for

a meal to pass by.

A lurkers body is roughly ovoid in shape. From it sprout

two long tentacles and two eyes on long, prehensile stalks.

Below these four appendages sits a large mouth

filled with sharp teeth. The col-

oration of a lurkers hide is

nearly always the faded gray

of stone, but its tentacles

and  mouth  give  off  a

faint, white glow.

A  spectral  lurker  is

often  mistaken  for  an

unusual-looking  ghost

when  spotted  at  a  dis-

tance. Those who seek to

put the ghost to rest are

one of the most common

sources of food for the

creature.

Spectral lurkers speak

Undercommon.

COMBAT

A spectral lurker hides

in walls, floors, and ceil-

ings of enclosed spaces

dungeons, caverns, and

so onwaiting for a tasty

morsel  to  pass  nearby.

When likely prey makes

an  appearance,  it  strikes

with its tentacles, wrapping a

victim up, turning it incorporeal, then dragging it inside a

solid surface before releasing it. It repeats these tactics until

its prey is dead.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, a spec-

tral lurker can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 2d6

points of bludgeoning damage.

Dexterity Drain (Su): A creature grappled by a spectral

lurker must make a Fortitude save (DC 22) or be drained of

1d6 points of Dexterity. This saving throw must be made

each round the opponent remains grappled.

Ghost Touch Attacks (Su): A spectral lurkers tentacle

and bite attacks deal normal damage to corporeal creatures.

Essentially, the lurker can consider its mouth and tentacles

as corporeal or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is

more beneficial to the creature.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a spectral lurker hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself with

a tentacle attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold, it can

pull the opponent into a solid surface and also constrict in

the same round. Thereafter, the lurker has the option to con-

duct the grapple normally, or simply use its tentacle to hold

the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the spec-

tral lurker is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals tentacle damage and subjects the oppo-

nent to the possibility of Dex-

terity drain.

Incorporealize (Su): A

creature grappled and pinned

by a spectral lurkers tenta-

cles must make a Fortitude

save  (DC  22)  or  become

incorporeal itself. This ef-

fect temporarily grants the

creature the incorporeal

subtype (as long as it re-

mains  grappled  by  the

spectral lurker), but doesnt

automatically allow it to

escape the lurkers grapple

due to the lurkers ability

to make ghost touch at-

tacks. If a victim becomes

corporeal while inside a

material object (such as a

solid wall), it is shunted of

to the nearest open space

and takes 1d6 points of

damage per 5 feet that it

so travels.

Spectral lurker

All-Around Vision (Ex):

A spectral lurker can see in

all directions at once. Because

of this ability, it has a +4 racial bonus on

Search and Spot checks, and it cannot be flanked.

Blindsight (Ex): A spectral lurker can ascertain creatures

by nonvisual means (mostly hearing, but also by vibration

and other environmental clues). This ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and creatures within 60 feet. A spectral lurker

usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to

notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

Immunities (Ex): A spectral lurker is immune to cold,

electricity, and sonic damage.

159

Incorporeal Subtype: A spectral lurker can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. A spectral lurker can pass

through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its

attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflec-

tion bonuses and force effects work normally against it. A

spectral lurker always moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Skills: *A spectral lurker has a +8 racial bonus on Hide

checks when it is hiding in a solid object.

Spirits of the air are whimsical creatures that serve deities

of the wind and sky, or even nondeific powers that deal in

the same areas. They travel the upper parts of the atmos-

phere near windy mountaintops as well as the windswept

plains of the lowlands. Wherever there is wind, you can

find sprits of the air catching updrafts and soaring through

the clouds.

A spirit of the air resembles a monkey, roughly 10 feet

tall, with elongated fingers that form the ribs of its fanlike

wings. The coloration of their furred bodies ranges from

dark brown to blond, and their tusked mouths have a

mirthful set, even when the spirits are engaged in battle.

A spirit of the airs mouth sports two tusks that curl up

toward the creatures nose,

then out toward its cheeks.

In its long, prehensile tail

is  typically  clutched  a

heavy mace.

Spirit of the air

Spirits of the air claim

windy areas as their terri-

tories. Due to their remark-

able mobility, these terri-

tories sometimes stretch

for  hundreds  of  miles.

Creatures that pass within

are generally unmolested,

but  the  sprits  sometimes

take  offense  at  unseen

slights and rush to attack

interlopers.

Spirits of the air speak

Auran, Draconic, and Giant.

COMBAT

Spirits of the air fight while

hovering whenever possible.

They use their spell-like abil-

ities  from  a  distance,  then

close to melee. If their maces

are not particularly success-

ful, they resort to their whirl-

wind attack.

Whirlwind (Su): A spirit of the air can transform itself

into a whirlwind once per day and remain in that form for

up to 10 rounds. In this form, a spirit of the air can move

through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.

The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at its base, 20 feet wide at

the top, and 30 feet tall. The spirit of the air controls the

whirlwinds exact height (using a standard action to get

taller or shorter), but it must be at least 10 feet tall.

Creatures one or more sizes smaller than that spirit of

the air might take damage when caught in the whirlwind

and may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must

succeed on a Reflex save (DC 20) when it comes into con-

tact with the whirlwind or take 2d6 points of damage. It

must also succeed on a second Reflex (DC 20) save or be

picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful

winds, automatically taking 2d6 points of dam-

age each round. A creature that can fly is

allowed a Reflex save each round to

escape the whirlwind. The creature

still takes damage but can leave if

the save is successful.

A spirit of the air can eject any

carried  creatures  whenever  it

wishes, depositing them wherever

the whirlwind

happens to be.

If the whirlwinds

base touches the ground, it

creates a swirling cloud of debris.

This cloud is centered on the spirit of the air

and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwinds

height. The cloud obscures vision, including darkvision,

beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have one-half conceal-

ment (20% miss chance), while those farther away have

total concealment (50% miss chance). Those caught in the

cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20) to

cast a spell.

Immunity to Air Effects (Ex): A spirit of the air is

immune to strong winds or any air-related effects.

Scent (Ex): A spirit of the air can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: Spirits of the air have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

The fungoid predators known as sporebats soar

silently through night skies in search of warm-

blooded creatures to feast upon. They are

strict carnivores with a preference for mammals

and birds.

A sporebat appears as a dark gray bat

made up of a spongy material. A

large, lidless orange eye

gazes  out  from  the

center  of  the  crea-

tures body. The crea-

ture is 3 feet high

with a wingspan

of nearly 8 feet. Its two legs

and  tail  end  in  viciously

Sporebat

hooked claws, which it uses to rip apart prey.

Sporebats speak their own language, which is unintelli-

gible to all other listeners.

COMBAT

Sporebats use their silent and camouflage abilities to fly

over prey unnoticed. These fungus creatures then rain

down enervation rays on their unsuspecting opponents.

When their prey has been sufficiently and obviously weak-

ened, the sporebats swoop down to attack with their claws

and tail. Sporebats work together when hunting, focusing

their efforts on clearly dangerous threats. An extremely rav-

enous sporebat ignores its own safety to claw foes between

ray attacks.

A sporebat can be summoned using a summon natures ally

VIII spell.

Enervation Ray (Su): A sporebat can fire a brown ener-

vation ray every other round at any target within 150 feet.

Its effect is as an enervation spell cast by a 12th-level sorcerer.

Camouflage (Ex): During any condition of illumination

other than daylight, a sporebat can disappear into shadows,

giving it nine-tenths concealment (40% miss chance). Artifi-

cial illumination, or any light spell, negates this ability.

Plant Traits (Ex): A sporebat is immune to poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is not subject to

critical hits or mind-affecting effects. A sporebat also has

low-light vision.

Silent (Ex): Sporebats move in absolute silence and make

no noise.

SPRIGGAN

Spriggans are evil, nomadic gnomekin with the strange abil-

ity to grow to a large size at will. They wander in packs

through woodland areas, sometimes venturing into towns

and villages. Spriggans live to rob and pillage as they jour-

ney. They are a numerous people, but pose little threat to civ-

ilized races because of their inability to organize.

Spriggans resemble ugly, mean gnomes with greasy,

reddish-brown hair and dull, yellow skin. They grow their

hair to ridiculous proportions, proudly sporting bushy

mustaches, sideburns and ponytails. They are disgustingly

unclean things, exuding an almost nauseating smell of

rancid flesh.

Spriggans speak Gnome and Common. A few spriggans

take the trouble to learn Sylvan and Kobold.

COMBAT

Spriggans employ tactics intended to startle or unnerve

their foes. They swarm around opponents when small,

only to enlarge at the last minute. This allows spriggans to

use their greater reach for attacks of opportunity on

advancing enemies. More dexterous spriggans serve as

back-up to their kin in melee, remaining in the shadows

to thwart foes by sneak attacks, stealthy thieving, or cast-

ing their shatter ability.

A spriggan can be summoned using a summon natures ally

IV spell.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a spriggans target is

denied a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a

spriggan, the spriggan deals an additional 3d6 points of

damage on a successful melee attack. This damage stacks

with sneak attack damage from other sources, such as

rogue levels.

Size Change (Su): At will, spriggans can change their

size in a fashion similar to the effect of an enlarge spell.

The size change from Small to Large gains +8 Strength, 4

Dexterity, +6 Constitution and 2 to attack bonus and

Armor class. A spriggans short sword has the same attrib-

utes as a Large short sword when enlarged. An enlarged

spriggan is unable to make a sneak attack or use its spell-

like abilities.

Skills: Spriggans have a +4 racial bonus on Climb, Dis-

able Device, Move Silently, Open Lock, and Sleight of

Hand checks.

SPRIGGAN SOCIETY

Raucous and nasty fey, spriggans only linger in an area for

short periods of time before being driven out by nearby

inhabitants. They usually settle underground in woodland

areas in dismal burrows or in long forgotten ruins. Sprig-

gans live by thievery and murder, robbing and terrorizing

all who pass near their lair. During particularly desperate

times, spriggan packs disband and individual spriggans

disguise themselves as gnomes to gain entry into towns

and cities. Spriggans are extremely fond of weapons and

armor, which they usually acquire unlawfully.

SPRIGGAN

CHARACTERS

A spriggans favored

class  is  rogue.  Be-

cause of its special

abilities, a spriggan

PCs effective char-

acter level (ECL) is

equal  to  its  class

level + 7. Thus, a 1st-

level spriggan rogue

has  an  ECL  of  8

and is the equiva-

lent  of  an  8th-

level character.

The steel predator wanders the scarred metallic cubes

of Acheron in search of fresh metal to consume.

Resembling an iron-muscled great cat, this creature

shares many characteristics with its terrestrial equiva-

lents, including incredible strength and agility. Despite

its deafness, its powers of scent are so great as to allow it

to detect nearby creatures with ease.

Steel predators speak a harsh, growling dialect of Terran.

COMBAT

If a steel predator gains surprise, it opens combat with a roar

attack in the surprise round, followed by a pounce and full

attack. It attempts to sunder its opponents weapons when-

ever possible.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a steel predator hits an oppo-

nent at least one size category smaller than itself with its

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus + 23). If it gets a hold, it can

attempt to rake on its next grapple check. Alternatively, the

steel predator has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its bite to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the steel predator is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Pounce (Ex): If a steel predator leaps upon a foe during

the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it

has already taken a move action.

Rake (Ex): A steel predator that gets a hold can make two

rake attacks (+17 melee) with its hind legs for 1d6+3 points

of damage each. If a steel predator pounces on an opponent,

it can also rake.

Roar (Su): A steel predator can emit a titanic roar every

1d4 rounds. All creatures within a 30-foot cone take 12d6

points of sonic damage and are deafened for 2d6 rounds

(Fort DC 20 half; success negates the deafness). Any exposed

brittle or crystalline creature takes twice the indicated

damage;  creatures  holding  fragile  objects  can  negate

damage to them with successful Reflex saves (DC 20).

Sundering Bite (Ex): When it uses its bite to attack a

weapon, shield, or other held item, the steel predator gains a

+4 bonus on the opposed attack roll and deals double

normal damage.

Blindsight (Ex): A steel predators sense of smell is so

powerful that it grants the blindsight ability out to a range of

30 feet.

Deaf (Ex): A steel predator is incapable of perceiving

sound, and is thus immune to language-dependent effects

and sonic effects dependent on hearing. The creature has

adapted to this limitation and thus takes no penalty on ini-

tiative checks because of its deafness.

Outsider Traits: A steel predator has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or

miracle spell can restore life).

Resistances (Ex): A steel predator has cold and fire

resistance 20.

Skills: A steel predator has a +4 racial bonus on Balance,

Hide, and Move Silently checks.

The  sunwyrm  is  a  dangerous  draconic

beast that lurks in the skies above swelter-

ing regions such as deserts and savan-

nahs. It can transform part or

all of its body into pure

energy to lay waste to

TL

its victims.

A sunwyrm looks like a radiant dragon with shining

scales that radiate visible waves of heat. It has batlike

wings that emit brilliant light. A fanged mouth and horns

dominate the creatures draconic head, and almost-liquid

light seems to seep from its

eyes. A sunwyrm has

eight  legs,  and  it

can use the front

four, which are

more  limber,

to devastating

effect in com-

bat. Finally, the

creatures  tail

is long and sin-

uous  with  a

glowing ball of

pulsating energy

at the tip. A sun-

wyrm is nearly 15

feet long, and it has a

wingspan of well over 30 feet.

A sunwyrm spends the majority of its life in the air soar-

ing on powerful thermals and scouring the lands below for

creatures to swoop down on and eat. Sunwyrms are carni-

vores, but their digestion processes transform consumed

flesh into pure energy and light that is then emitted from

their tail, eyes, and wing membranes. Like many dragons,

sunwyrms have an almost maniacal obsession with pre-

cious metals and treasure, but they particularly love to col-

lect gold and gemstones.

Sunwyrms can transform their bodies into burning

energy, and in this form they can pass through nonliving

matter. They prefer to make their lairs inside sand dunes,

where they rest in brilliant energy form. Most sunwyrm

lairs have at least a few open air caves nearby for the storage

of the creatures loot.

Sunwyrms speak Common, Auran, Ignan, and Draconic.

COMBAT

The sunwyrm has a unique method of hiding in plain sight.

Since it emits light constantly, it positions itself in the sky

directly between its prey and the sun, casting no shadows

and waiting for the perfect opportunity to swoop down and

strike. Against powerful foes, a sunwyrm prefers to remain

in  its  hidden  position  and  blast  them  with  its  breath

weapon. In melee combat, the creature makes full use of its

brilliant energy attacks by using the Power Attack feat

against armored foes.

Breath Weapon (Su): A sunwyrm breathes a 90-foot line

of burning yellow energy every 1d4 rounds that deals 15d8

points of damage (Ref DC 19 half ). This beam of energy

passes through nonliving matter (including constructs and

undead) without harming it, but it affects all living creatures

in its path. The breath weapon deals purely physical damage,

and it can be defeated by damage reduction but not by

energy resistance.

Brilliant Aura (Su): A sunwyrm constantly

emits light, which provides illumina-

tion to a range of 240 feet. A

sunwyrm takes a 20

penalty on all Hide

checks when it can-

not overwhelm

its brilliance

with  an

equal  or  brighter

light (such as sun-

light).  Any  creature

that looks at a sunwyrm

must  make  a  Fortitude

save (DC 19) each round it

continues to look or it becomes

Sunwyrm

blinded for 3d6 minutes.

Brilliant Energy (Su): At will as a

free action, a sunwyrm can transform its front

four claws or its teeth into brilliant energy weapons, allow-

ing those attacks to ignore nonliving matter (including

constructs and undead).

Blindsight (Ex): A sunwyrm maneuvers and fights not

only by sight, but also by using hearing and smell to ascer-

tain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 120 feet. A sunwyrm usually

does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice crea-

tures within range of its blindsight.

Dragon Traits: Sunwyrms are immune to sleep and paral-

ysis effects. They have darkvision (60-foot range) and low-

light vision.

Energy Form (Su): As a move action, a sunwyrm can

transform its entire body into energy. In this form, the

sunwyrm gains the incorporeal subtype. It can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abili-

ties. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks

made with ghost touch weapons. A sunwyrm in energy form

can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will.

It can use its breath weapon in this form, but not its

normal attacks; physical contact with a sunwyrm in energy

form does no damage to living creatures. A sunwyrm

always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen

checks if it doesnt wish to be while in this form.

Immunity to Blindness (Ex): A sunwyrm cannot be

blinded through either magical or mundane means.

Keen Senses (Ex): A sunwyrm sees four times as well as

a human in low-light conditions and eight times as well in

normal light.

SWARM

A large variety of creatures can form swarms, but all swarms

have one thing in common: When that many creatures

work together, they often prove to be deadlier than if work-

ing separately. Animals, magical beasts, vermin, and other

types of creatures join together to defend their homes,

gather food, and more.

COMBAT

Each type of swarm has some basic abilities it can bring

to bear on those who seek to harm it or those who serve

as prey.

Distraction (Ex): Any nonmindless creature vulnerable

to a swarms damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its

square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 swarms HD + swarms Con modifier) negates the effect.

Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a

swarm requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell

level). Using skills requiring patience and concentration

requires a Concentration check (DC 20).

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and

no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits

or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half

damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm

composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all

weapon damage.

Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or fewer causes the

swarm to break up, though damage taken until that point

does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms

are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage.

Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and

they cannot grapple another.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a

specific number of creatures (including single -target

spells such as disintegrate), with the exception of mind-

affecting effects if the swarm has an Intelligence score

and a hive mind. A swarm takes a 10 penalty on saving

throws against spells or effects that affect an area, such as

many evocation spells or grenadelike weapons. If the area

attack does not allow a saving throw, a swarm takes double

damage instead.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are

susceptible to high winds such as that created by a gust of

wind spell. To determine the effect of wind on a swarm,

treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its con-

stituent creatures. For example, a swarm of Abyss ants

(Diminutive creatures) can be blown away by a severe

wind. Wind effects deal 1d6 points of subdual damage to

the swarm per spell level (or Hit Die of the originating

creature, in the case of effects such as an air elementals

whirlwind). A swarm that takes subdual damage sufficient

to exceed its current hit points becomes disorganized and

dispersed, and does not re-form until its current hit points

exceed its subdual damage.

Abyssal ants are the infernal version of army ants: 8-inch-

long bodies of red and black chitin, glowing blue multi-

faceted eyes, and purple mandibles dripping with acidic

slime. They swarm over the Lower Planes and, when sum-

moned forth by an evil wizard or demon, can infest the

Material Plane as well, leaving half-dissolved wreckage in

their wake.

Abyssal ants do not speak, but they understand Abyssal.

Combat

Like plague ants, abyssal ants exhibit little interest in tactics.

As a swarm, they do possess a modicum of intelligence and

have been known to retreat from unsuccessful attacks.

Acid (Ex): The swarm attack of an abyssal ant swarm

deals acid damage in addition to the normal damage of the

creatures bites and stings. Also, a swarm of abyssal ants

can produce a shower of acidic spittle that works as a

grenadelike weapon, dealing 2d8 points of damage on a

direct hit and 1d4 points of splash damage to creatures

within 5 feet of the target. Creatures directly hit by the

acid take an additional 1d8 points of damage 1 round after

being hit.

Penetration (Su): The swarm attack of an abyssal ant

swarm penetrates damage reduction as if it were a +5

weapon.

everything in their path. They operate based on sophisti-

cated instinct, with ants in the forefront of the swarms

approach carrying large chunks of food (preferably bloody

meat) back to the queen, who is protected in the swarms

bivouac by a shelter formed from living ants.

Disease (Ex): Any creature that takes damage from a

plague ant swarm must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17)

or contract red ache. The incubation period is 1d3 days, and

the disease deals 1d6 points of Strength damage.

Wounding (Ex): A wound resulting from a plague ant

swarm attack bleeds for an additional 1 point of damage

per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks

result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2

A lesser pack of cranium rats consists of about 75 rats.

Combat

While more limited than the larger packs in what they can

do, lesser packs still set up effective ambushes and utilize

their mind blast ability to great advantage.

Mind Blast (Su): This attack is a 60-foot

cone. Anyone caught in this cone

must succeed on a Will save (DC 14)

or be stunned for 3d4 rounds. A lesser

cranium rat pack can use this

power every 2 rounds.

Like ten thousand eyes and ears dispatched to gather secrets

for some dark deity of knowledge, cranium rats are every-

whereseeing, hearing, and sharing what they learn in a

bizarre hive mind.

An individual cranium rat is almost indistinguishable

from a normal rodent, except that a portion of its large

brain is exposed and pulses with a soft glow. Singly, the

creatures are also virtually identical to normal rats, but

they are never encountered singly. A pack of cranium rats

has a group mindand the more rats, the more intelli-

gent the group mind.

Cranium rats

An average pack of cra-

nium rats consists of about 150 rats.

Cranium rats do not speak, but average and greater packs

can communicate telepathically.

Combat

While dangerous and unpleasant, cranium rats are not

aggressive creatures. They avoid open attacks in favor of

flight or ambushes. Cranium rats use their spells and mind

blast ability to soften or incapacitate victims before swarm-

ing over them, then they drain their victims blood through

a hundred tiny wounds.

Normally harmless, locusts occasionally rise in devastating

forms. A locust swarm contains approximately 10,000 indi-

vidual creatures, although the swarm fights and reacts as

one creature during combat. Seen from a distance, the

swarm  looks  like  a  dark  black  cloud,  although  most

onlookers quickly note the roiling motion of the insects

that make up the swarm.

The greatest threat that locust swarms pose is their

sheer size. Often covering hundreds of acres, locust swarms

are usually encountered in great numbers, and even pow-

erful creatures can succumb to wave after wave of swarm-

ing locusts.

Combat

Multihued wings and scintillating exoskeletons make

these deceptively beautiful creatures as fascinating as

they are dangerous. Whereas many vermin swarms are

easy to avoid, even the most mobile creatures often fall

pray to the hypnotic colors produced by a swarm of rap-

ture locusts. Victims stand motionless as they are over-

come by euphoria while the voracious locusts feast on

their bodies.

Advancement: 

Whereas the common locust poses a menace only to plants

and crops, deadlier strains, influenced by magic or fiendish

will,  attempt  to  tear  the  flesh  from  any  creature  they

encounter. These creatures, although too small individually

to pose a threat to most creatures, can quickly engulf and

devour unprepared victims.

Combat

Created to carry the horrors of the Abyss to other planes,

bloodfiend locusts feast not only on the flesh of their vic-

tims, but on their very life force as well. As a swarm of

bloodfiend locusts moves through a region, those who fall

prey to the creatures rise again in twisted undead forms and

are tainted not only by the forces of undeath, but also by the

evil of the Abyss itself.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a bloodfiend

locust swarm gain one negative level. If the negative level

has not been removed (with a spell such as restoration) before

one day has passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed on

a Fortitude save (DC 19) to remove it.

Reanimate (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid

killed by the energy drain attack of a bloodfiend locust

swarm rises 2d6 hours later as a fiendish vampire spawn. See

the vampire spawn and the fiendish template description in

the Monster Manual.

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns,

and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot range).

Hypnotic Pattern (Su): Any-

ture locusts is affected as if by

a hypnotic pattern spell cast by a

6th-level sorcerer. Creatures can

make a Will saving throw (DC 15)

to resist this affect. This is a mind-

affecting ability.

Rapture (Su): Any nonmindless crea-

ture that takes damage from a rapture

locust swarm must succeed on a Will save (DC

18) or take no action for 1 full round. Creatures

so affected stand motionless. This is a mind-

affecting ability. Enraptured creatures are not

distracted by the swarms attack, since they do not

even realize they are being harmed, but creatures

that succeed on a save against the swarms rapture

are distracted (see Distraction, above, in the gen-

eral discussion on swarms).

Alignment: Always neutral

Advancement: 

Usually found in the depths of

underground crypts, scarab

beetles exist in huge numbers.

They consume flesh and or-

ganic material with blinding

speed,  making  them  ideal

guardians  of  tombs,  mauso-

leums, temples, and treasuries.

Unless it is sealed in an airtight

sarcophagus, scarab beetles will

consume the body that they were

meant to protect.

Scarab beetles are beautiful to look

at,  with  shiny  black  carapaces  high-

lighted  in  turquoise,  red,  and  yellow.

Scarab beetles have keen, powerful pincers

that can slice through flesh and bone with ease.

Scarab beetles dig holes and tunnels near piles

of offal and decomposing organic material. Through their

consumption of carrion and the like, scarab

beetles speed the reintroduction of decaying

organic material into the environment.

Rapture locusts

Fortunately, scarab beetles are not very fond of sunlight

or intense heat, and they do not venture out onto the

sweeping sands for long. At most, they attack any animal

unfortunate to stumble across their lair before retreat-

ing back into the cool shadows.

Combat

Scarab beetles are usually passive, and they

generally remain dormant or crawl slowly

about in search of food. However, they

become extremely agitated in the

presence of a living creature and

devour anything that gets be-

tween them and that creature.

Watching  a  huge  swarm  of

scarab beetles run down and

devour a victim without stop-

ping is a terrifying sight.

Because they can burrow

through  sand  and  dirt  as

quickly as they can move on

the  surface,  scarab  beetles

commonly hide in the walls

or flooring of tombs and spill

out onto unsuspecting victims.

Desiccate (Ex): Scarab

beetles can reduce a victim to

nothing in mere seconds. Any

living opponent damaged by a

scarab beetle swarm must make a

Fortitude save (DC 21) or take 1d6

points of Constitution damage. A

tionally dangerous and deal more swarm damage than their

Hit Dice would otherwise indicate.

A single snake no more than a foot long is rarely a threat to

seasoned adventurers, no matter how virulent its venom.

More than a hundred such snakes writhing together in a

single mass, however, is a waking nightmare.

The individual snakes that make up a viper swarm are 8 to

12 inches long, with black scales marked by red, orange, or

yellow bands, lines, or arrowlike markings. As a swarm, they

form a living carpet of wriggling snakes and crawl over one

another and anything in their path, biting and injecting

their deadly poison.

A viper swarm can be summoned using a summon

natures ally VI spell.

Poison (Ex): A viper swarm delivers its poison (Fort

DC 13 negates) with each swarm attack. Initial and

secondary damage are the same (1d4 Con).

Hive Mind (Ex): A viper swarm has a hive

mind, making it susceptible to mind-affecting

spells. For purposes of such spells, the swarm is

a single creature of the animal type.

Scent (Ex): A viper swarm

can  detect  approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and

track by sense of smell.

Skills: Viper swarms have

Some mercenaries are so dedicated to a life of war that they

rise from death to continue the battle, prowling the site of

their deaths or the places of their burial, looking for foes to

put to the sword.

Swordwraiths appear similar to how they did in life,

although their equipment is more battered and their flesh

appears insubstantial. In dim light or darkness, their eyes

can be seen to glow dimly. As most in a particular band

come from the same mercenary company, they usually bear

the same insignia.

Swordwraiths speak any languages they knew in life.

Some have been willing to parlay with those they consider

their military equal.

The sample swordwraith uses a 5th-level human fighter as

are rather surly and irritable insects, swarms of wasps can

be extremely dangerous.

Despite their maligned reputation, wasps are valuable

parts of the ecosystem, since they eat an enormous amount

of otherwise harmful insects.

Combat

Wasp swarms are often passive unless roused by loud

noises or violent motion. A character can move through a

passive swarm safely if he makes a Move Silently check

(DC 20). This works only if the character does not attack

the swarm, moves at half speed, and does not make any

sudden movements (such as spellcasting).

When roused, wasps have an extremely painful bite as

well as a poisonous barb.

Poison (Ex): A wasp swarm delivers poison equivalent to

that of a Medium-size giant wasp (Fort DC 18 negates) with

each swarm attack. Initial and secondary damage are the

same (1d6 Dex).

Vermin Traits: A wasp swarm is immune to all mind-

affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, pat-

terns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot

174

maws, and, like those of sharks, their deadly teeth continue

to grow throughout their lives. Terlens have excellent natu-

ral camouflage: Their gray hides fade into their environs

with ease.

Although vicious predators, terlens have enough survival

instinct to stay away from the large and powerful beings that

they sometimes encounter on the Outer Planes.

each round until the victim breaks free, the terlen is slain,

or the victim dies.

Skills: Terlens have a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks

because of their natural camouflage. Terlens have a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard and can always choose to take 10 on Swim

checks, even if distracted or endangered.

COMBAT

Voracious eaters, terlens never pass up a chance for a meal.

They cover great distances by day, though they stay low to

the ground compared to other large flying predators and use

foliage as cover to surprise prey. In combat they instinc-

tively try to strike from ambush, and once their powerful

jaws lock on, they crush and worry opponents unlucky

enough to be caught.

Terlens often use hit-and-run

tactics, and as natural hunters they

know that their best chance for a

kill is a quick strike.

Ambush (Ex): Anytime a

terlen  makes  a  successful

charge attack against a flat-

footed opponent, it deals

double damage with its

bite.

Improved  Grab

(Ex): If a terlen hits

an opponent that

is at least one size

category smaller

than itself with

a  bite  attack,  it

deals normal dam-

age and attempts

to start a grapple

as  a  free  action

without provok-

ing an attack of

o p p o r t u n i t y

(grapple  bonus

+7).  If  it  gets  a

hold, it also wor-

ries on the same

round. Thereafter,

the terlen has the

option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its bite to hold the oppo-

nent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the fhorge is not

considered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals worry damage.

Worry (Ex): A terlen that successfully gets a hold on an

opponent with its improved grab ability shakes the victim

violently back and forth. This attack deals bite damage

Terror birds are cunning scavengers and predators. They

reside at or near the top of the food chain in their territory

unless another, more fearsome predator lives there. In such

an instance, the terror birds scavenging instincts become

more prominent, since the birds no longer have to hunt for

food to survive.

Standing 8 to 9 feet tall, terror birds are flightless. Their

large, hooked beaks are perfect for tearing meat, and

175

although their claws look wicked

and sharp, the birds do not use

them  to  attack.  The  foliage  of

terror birds varies depending on

a packs claimed territory. If the

birds are primarily predators, their

foliage  matches  the  terrain  in

which they hunt. If they act more

as scavengers, their foliage might

be brighter.

Terror birds are rarely encoun-

tered singly. They are efficient and

cunning pack hunters. They never

attack an obviously more powerful

force, since they prefer to hunt

prey they can carry away easily.

COMBAT

Terror bird packs try to encircle

their chosen victims. When their prey

seems least aware, flanking terror birds run in to distract the

creature or creatures, while the leader runs in and attempts

to grab a Small or smaller creature before running off to the

packs nesting ground. The others then cover for the fleeing,

burdened leader. They know that if one returns with food,

the rest of the pack will receive a share.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a terror bird hits an opponent

that is at least two size categories smaller than itself with a

bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +13). If it gets a hold, it auto-

matically deals bite damage with a successful grapple check.

A terror bird can move while maintaining the hold.

Thunder worms are sometimes called living storms, for they

float about in clouds, and their bodies course with electric-

ity and sonic energy.

Some sages and adventurers compare thunder worms to

purple worms, but the similarity ends in the wormlike

shape shared by both monsters. Thunder worms are incor-

poreal, with cloudlike bodies that resist material attacks.

They look like long clouds of mist that range from wispy

white to threatening black in color, with many shades of

gray in between. Lightninglike discharges dance constantly

through their forms, and they make a soft rumbling sound

when agitated.

Thunder  worms  do  not  speak,  but  they  understand

Common, Auran, and Giant.

COMBAT

A thunder worm tends to initiate combat with its thunder-

clap attack; then it closes on its foes to touch and engulf

them.

Engulf (Ex): As an incorporeal creature, a thunder worm

can position itself so that it occupies the same spaces as its

enemiesa fate potentially far worse than being swallowed

176

by a purple worm. This attack affects as many creatures as

will fit within the cloud worms facing (a 40-foot cube).

Target creatures must make a successful Reflex save (DC 43)

or take electricity and sonic damage as if hit by the cloud

worms incorporeal touch attack. Creatures that fail their

saving throws take damage each round that they remain

within the cloud worms body, with no further opportunities

for saving throws. Creatures that make a successful saving

throw must continue to save each round that they remain

within the worms body, taking damage if they fail (and

thereafter receiving no additional saving throws until they

move out of its body).

Thunderclap (Ex): A thunder worm can produce a

thunderous boom as a standard action. Creatures within

30 feet of the worm must make a Reflex save (DC 43) or

take 24d8 points of sonic damage. After producing a

thunderclap, a thunder worm must wait 1d4 rounds

before doing it again.

Blindsight (Ex): A thunder worm maneuvers and fights

not only by sight, but also by using hearing and smell to

ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to discern

objects and creatures within 90 feet. A thunder worm usu-

ally does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice

creatures within range of its blindsight.

Defensive Shock (Ex): An opponent that uses a metal

melee weapon or a natural weapon to deal damage to a

thunder worm must make a Reflex save (DC 34) or take 2d6

points of electricity damage from the creatures body.

Incorporeal Subtype: A thunder worm can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural

abilities. The creature has a 50% chance to

ignore  any  damage  from  a  corporeal

source, except for force effects or

attacks made with ghost touch

weapons. A thunder

worm can pass

through solid

objects,  but

not force ef-

fects, at will. Its

attacks ignore nat-

ural  armor,  armor,

and shields, but

A  twisted  result  of  yuan-ti  experi-

mentation and cross-breeding,

a  ti-khana  creature  is  a

psionic hybrid of reptil-

ian animal or magical beast

and yuan-ti qualities.

A  ti-khana  deinony-

chus resembles its ances-

tors:  It  is  a  lizardlike

reptile that walks on its

hind  legs.  Its  body  is

slightly  longer  than

that  of  a  normal  dei-

nonychus, reaching about

14 feet in length, while it

stands about 8 feet tall

and weighs around 900

pounds. Its skin is cov-

ered with thick, col-

orful  scales,  and

two long fangs jut

out from among its

tearing teeth.

COMBAT

A ti-khana deinonychus leaps at prey,

tearing with its talons (counting as a single

177

attack), grasping with its foreclaws, and biting with its ter-

rible jawsadding a toxic venom to the deinonychuss

already fearsome attack routine.

Poison (Ex): A ti-khana deinonychus delivers its poison

(Fort DC 16 negates) with each successful bite attack. Initial

and secondary damage are the same (1d6 Con).

Psionics (Sp): A ti-khana deinonychus can produce the

following effects at will.

Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.

Alternate Form: A ti-khana deinonychus can assume the

form of a Tiny to Large viper (see the Monster Manual).

The ti-khana deinonychus uses its own or the vipers

poison, whichever it prefers.

Aversion: A ti-khana deinonychus creates a compulsion

effect targeting one creature within 30 feet. The subject

must succeed on a Will save (DC 17) or gain an aversion to

snakes for 10 minutes. Affected subjects must stay at least

20 feet from any snake, yuan-ti, or ti-khana, alive or dead;

if  already  within  20  feet,  they  move away. A subject can

overcome the compulsion by making another

Will save (DC 17), but still suffers from deep

anxiety. This anxiety causes a 4 penalty to

Dexterity  until  the  effect

wears off or the subject is no

longer within 20 feet of a

snake, yuan-ti, or ti-khana. This

ability is otherwise similar to

antipathy as cast by a 16th-level

sorcerer.

Scent (Ex): A ti-khana dein-

onychus can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes,

and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A deinonychus has a +8

racial bonus on Hide, Jump, Listen,

Spot,  and  Survival  checks.  *The

bonus on Survival checks increases

to +12 when tracking by scent.

THE TI-KHANA TEMPLATE

Ti-khana is a template that can be applied to

any lizard, dinosaur, snake, or any animal or

magical beast that is reptilian. The creatures type

becomes magical beast. It uses all the base creature's statistics

and abilities except as noted here.

AC: Natural armor improves by +4.

Attacks: As a magical beast, a ti-khana creature has a base

attack bonus equal to its Hit Dice. If the base creature does

not have a bite attack, the ti-khana creature gains one.

Damage: A ti-khana creatures bite attack deals damage

as shown on the table below, or as the base creature, which-

ever is better. In addition to the damage, a ti-khanas bite

injects poison.

each successful bite attack. Initial and secondary damage are

the same (1d6 Con).

Psionics (Sp): A ti-khana creature can produce the following

effects at will.

Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.

Alternate Form: A ti-khana creature can

assume the form of a Tiny to Large viper (see

the Monster Manual). This ability is similar to a

shapechange spell cast by a 19th-level sorcerer

but allows only viper forms. The ti-khana creature uses its

own or the vipers poison, whichever it prefers.

Aversion: A ti-khanacreature cre-

ates a compulsion effect targeting one

creature within 30 feet. The subject

must succeed on a Will save (DC

17) or gain an aversion to snakes

for 10 minutes. Affected sub-

jects must stay at least 20 feet

from any snake, yuan-ti, or ti-

khana, alive or dead; if already

within 20 feet, they move away. A

subject can overcome the compul-

sion by making another Will save (DC

This anxiety causes a 4 penalty

to Dexterity until the effect wears off or

the subject is no longer within 20 feet of a

snake, yuan-ti, or ti-khana. This ability is otherwise similar

to antipathy as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

When a yuan-ti uses this ability, the aversion applies to

ti-khana creatures as well as snakes and yuan-ti.

Special Qualities: A ti-khana has spell resistance equal

to 13 + the base creatures Challenge Rating.

Abilities: A ti-khana creatures Dexterity and Intelligence

both increase by +2.

In  the  depths  of  the

earth,  tunnel  terrors

(also known as rock-

worms)  carve  out

treacherous  mazes

and pitfalls that mis-

direct unsuspecting

wanderers into their

great  maws.  These

bizarre  predators

are distantly related

to delvers.

A tunnel terror

looks like a gigan-

tic stony worm that

has been hollowed out,

leaving only a thick, tubular

hide. It has two flat tentacles, each

positioned at one end of its body. When at rest, these ten-

tacles are outstretched and blend in with a tunnel ceiling

or wall. Tunnel terrors have no mouth, eyes, or ears. They

use psionic abilities and tremorsense to interact with their

environment.

Tunnel terrors keep their lairs under constant surveillance

with their divination abilities. When prey is near, they use

psionics to strengthen their combat abilities, and then they

lie in wait for the perfect moment to strike.

Creatures stepping into a tunnel terrors space suddenly

find themselves engulfed as the beast contracts to wrap

around its prey. Wrapped creatures are ground into paste

from the violent constriction and then absorbed into the

terrors wall lining. While digesting a meal, a tunnel terror

keeps other foes at bay with tentacle attacks, usually trigger-

ing traps that bury or seal off its enemies.

Engulf (Ex): A tunnel terror can engulf one Large or

smaller foe that has stepped into its body by making a suc-

cessful grapple attempt against its foe. This move does not

provoke an attack of opportunity. Engulfed victims are

entangled and automatically take damage from suffocat-

ing constriction (see below). If the tunnel terror gets a

hold, it is free to use its tentacles to strike at other targets

while it constricts. Attacks made on an engulfing tunnel

terror deal half their damage to the monster and half to the

trapped victim.

Camouflage (Su):

Since a tunnel terror

looks like a part of the

tunnel when at rest,

it takes a successful

The first ulgurstasta

was created ages ago by

Kyuss,  a  powerful  evil

cleric turned demigod.

An ulgurstasta is a nauseating

creature that looks like a massive,

pale-yellow maggot. Twin rows of dozens of

pulpy, rudimentary legs tipped with bony spurs provide it

with a surprisingly effective means of locomotion. Its head

is studded with dozens of humanoid eyes, below which

drools a maw filled with hooked teeth. Millions of dis-

tended pores that continually weep a foul-smelling mucus

cover its body. The horror radiates a cloying stink of rotting

flowers and sour milk.

Ulgurstasta

Vague notes surviving from Kyusss time indicate that

the process of creating an ulgurstasta is long and dangerous.

180

The newly formed beast has an Intelligence of 1 and can

immediately create new skeletons. It obeys the vocal com-

mands of its creator and can think for itself only upon

reaching an Intelligence score of 10.

The one thing that Kyuss didnt count on was the fact

that an ulgurstasta retains some of the memories of those

it consumes. Thus, the more it ate, the more intelligent it

grew. By the time Kyuss vanished, most of his ulgurstastas

had become at least as intelligent as ghouls. Knowing that

they would be hunted down and destroyed by Kyusss

remaining enemies, the ulgurstastas retreated deep into

the wilderness. Despite their attempt at self-preservation,

most of them were hunted down and slain in the coming

years, until only a handful survived deep in the Worm-

crawl Fissure. Recently, one or two ulgurstastas have sup-

posedly surfaced in isolated areas far from the

Wormcrawl (such as in the Pomarj or the Bone

March), where the local denizens worship

them as gods.

The ulgurstasta is a solitary being and

has  no  desire  or  need  to  be  around

others of its kind. Should two beasts of

Kyuss meet, they give each other a

wide berth.

Since they were created through

powerful necromantic magic, these

creatures  cannot  reproduce,  nor  do

they  need  to  breathe  or  eat.  Their

orders once drove them to con-

vert living beings into skeletons,

but as time wore on, this drive

has been replaced by a need to

become more intelligent. As a

general rule, every thousand

skeletons created by an ulgur-

stasta allow it to retain enough

thoughts and memories to gain

a point of Intelligence. It is not

unlikely that in some forgotten

corner of the Wormcrawl, there

might  lurk  an  ulgurstasta  of

genius  level  or  higher;  these

ulgurstastas  might  even  have

mastered the school of Necro-

mancy themselves.

Ulgurstastas understand Common, though they cannot

speak it.

COMBAT

Ulgurstastas have grown much more intelligent over the

centuries and behave accordingly. An ulgurstasta attacks

with its jaws. These jaws are mounted on a flexible stalk

and have a reach of 20 feet.

Breath Weapon (Su): In an emergency, an ulgurstasta

can regurgitate the contents of its stomach. This results in

a cone of necromantic acid 60 feet long. Anyone in the

cones path must make a Reflex saving throw (DC 18) or

take 3d6 points of Constitution drain. Those who succeed

take only 1d6 points of Constitution damage. Creatures

killed in this manner animate in the next round as skele-

tons under the ulgurstastas control. Any dormant skeletons

in the ulgurstastas gut (see below) are vomited up as well.

These undead animate at once and attack everything in

sight except the ulgurstasta. Once the ulgurstasta has vom-

ited, it cannot do so again for one day. Creatures swallowed

during this period do not take Constitution drain. An

ulgurstasta unable to use its breath weapon often tries to

flee until it can replenish its supply of acid.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an ulgurstasta hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +29). Thereafter, the

ulgurstasta has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its bite to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the ulgurstasta is not con-

sidered grappled). In either case, each successful grapple

check it makes during successive rounds automatically

deals bite damage.

Necromantic Acid (Su): Someone swallowed by an

ulgurstasta is in deep troublethe creature feeds on raw

life and transforms its victims into animated skeletons

that the ulgurstasta can later regurgitate. A swallowed

victim takes 1d8 points of Constitution drain each round

from the necromantic acid inside the creature. Upon

death, the victims remains are infused with the acid and

transformed  into  an  animated  skeleton.  Skeletons

remain dormant in the ulgurstastas gut until it vomits

them up.

Spawn Skeletons (Su): As a full-round action, an

ulgurstasta can regurgitate dormant skeletons. At any

one time, an ulgurstasta has 2d4 skeletons of various

sizes in its gut. These undead obey the ulgurstastas

mental commands without fail and can function in the

round after regurgitation. For 1d6 rounds after being

vomited up, these skeletons are covered with necroman-

tic acid. They deal 1 point of Constitution drain with

each successful attack in addition to other damage dealt.

Ulgurstastas are always followed by a band of previously

spawned skeletons.

Swallow Whole (Ex): An ulgurstasta can swallow a

single creature that is at least one size category smaller

than itself by making a successful grapple check (grapple

bonus +29), provided it already has that opponent in its

maw (see Improved Grab, above). Once inside the ulgur-

stasta, the opponent is bathed in necromantic acid (see

above). A successful grapple check allows the swallowed

creature to climb out of the stomach and return to the ulgur-

stastas maw, where another successful grapple check is

needed to get free. Alternatively, a swallowed creature can

try to cut its way out with either claws or a light piercing or

slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at least 25 points of

damage to the stomach (AC 14) in this way creates an open-

ing large enough to permit escape. Once a single swallowed

creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. An ulgur-

stastas maw can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium-size, or

128 Small or smaller opponents.

Tendrils (Ex): The millions of pores on an ulgurstastas

body provide it with a deadly defense; each pore contains a

coiled, 40-foot-long, hair-thin tendril. When the creature

is angered, the tendrils extend to their full range and whip

about in a frenzy. This storm of tendrils renders an ulgur-

stasta immune to Small nonmagical ranged weapons such

as arrows and deals 1d12 points of slashing damage per

round to any creature within 40 feet of the ulgurstasta.

Anyone in this area also takes a 2 circumstance penalty

on attack rolls.

Undead Traits: An ulgurstasta is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, dis-

ease, death effects, necromantic effects (unless they

specifically affect undead), and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not

subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive dam-

age. An ulgurstasta cannot be raised, and resurrection

works only if it is willing. An ulgurstasta has darkvision

(60-foot range).

VARRANGOIN

Varrangoins  are  foul  denizens  of  the  Abyss.  Crafty,

malevolent, and fiercely territorial, these batlike crea-

tures form communities in dark caves away from any

source of light.

Varrangoins resemble human-sized bats with emaciated

bodies and skull-like, demonic faces. They have ragged

wings and long tails; each tail sports a wicked barb on its

end. Their skin tone is universally dark gray or black, and

their bodies are hairless.

Their communities often serve as mercenaries for

other denizens of the Abyss or even other planes. Varran-

goin  flocks  can  grow  unchecked  if  unopposed  by

another predator. If left alone, they often number more

than a hundred strong and claim up to several square

miles of territory.

Varrangoins have their own language and are capable of

knowing other languages as well.

COMBAT

All varrangoins choose their battles carefully and prefer to

attack creatures obviously weaker than themselves. In a

battle, arcanist varrangoins try to assume command of the

anarchic flocks, but usually have little success. Lesser var-

rangoins are herded forward in battle, little more than

chaff the superior varrangoins use to prolong their own

survival. Ragers love the thrill of ripping into an opponent

with their claws, though, and follow their lesser kin

quickly into combat with spell support from arcanists.

Usually, no individual leads a flock or community for long

due to the innate chaos of varrangoin society.

One tactic preferred by the arcanists is to use their profi-

ciency with illusion magic to make a flock appear twice or

three times as big as it actually is, plunging the ranks of

their opponents into chaos as they try to discern which var-

rangoin is real and which is not.

Varrangoin Traits (Ex): Exposure to bright light (such

as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds varrangoins for 1

round. Even after recovering from being blinded, they take

a 1 circumstance penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill

checks while operating in bright light. Varrangoins have

acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10.

If the chaotic varrangoin flocks have leaders, they are typi-

cally members of the arcanist subrace. Arcanist varrangoins

are just as cruel as their fellows; they simply rely more on

magic than brute force.

Arcanist varrangoins have thick, dark skin, narrow, glow-

ing white eyes, and long, lanky limbs. They stand roughly 6

feet tall and have a wingspan of nearly 12 feet. Their long,

pointed ears have a close similarity to those of a large bat,

and their claws and sharp teeth are minute in comparison to

their more physical cousins.

Arcanist varrangoins study powerful arcane mysteries

much as wizards do. They guard their lore jealously, and

arcanist varrangoin spellbooks are passed only to a few

select members of the species who show promise in the

arcane artsas well as the appropriate level of groveling

subservience toward their elders.

poison

Combat

Arcanist varrangoins are rarely encountered alone. When

they venture out of their caves, they are nearly always

accompanied by several lesser varrangoins and a few rager

varrangoins. In a fight, they send their minions forward to

engage opponents in melee while unleashing their spells

from a safe distance. Arcanist varrangoins favor evocation

and illusion spells over other sorts, since they tend to have

a direct impact on a battle. They rarely prepare spells that

increase the fighting effectiveness of others. Arcanists also

typically keep an escape spell prepared, such as expeditious

retreat or dimension door.

Poison (Ex): An arcanist varrangoin delivers its poison

(Fort DC 16 negates) with each successful tail sting attack.

Initial and secondary damage are the same (1d6 Dex).

Spell-Like Abilities: 2/daydispel magic; 1/dayarcane

eye, flesh to stone, mirror image, baleful polymorph, polymorph self.

Caster level 8th; save DC 11 + spell level.

Spells: An arcanist varrangoin can cast arcane spells as

a 9th-level wizard (4/5/5/4/2/1; save DC 13 + spell level or

15 + spell level for Evocation and Illusion spells). A typical

spell list: 0detect magic (2), flare, ghost sound; 1stcolor

spray, magic missile (2), shield, shocking grasp; 2ndblur,

darkness, flaming sphere (2), minor image; 3rdfireball (2),

major image, vampiric touch; 4thdimension door, ice storm;

5thcone of cold.

Immunity to Spells (Su): Arcanist varrangoins ignore

the effects of spells and spell-like abilities of 3rd level or

lower, just as if the spellcaster had failed to overcome spell

resistance. Arcanist varrangoins can deactivate or activate

this ability as a free action.

Arcanist Varrangoin Characters

An arcanist varrangoins favored class is wizard. If given

wizard levels, assume the arcanist varrangoin already has the

abilities of a 9th-level wizard. So, an arcanist varrangoin who

takes one wizard level would gain the abilities of a 10th-level

wizard. Its saves, spells per day, and spells in its spellbook

would increase according to the difference in bonuses

between a 9th-level and a 10th-level wizard, as would its

base attack bonus.

Lesser varrangoins are the most common variety of varran-

goin. While not stupid, they are the lowest members of var-

rangoin society. They live in a nearly constant state of fear,

despite their numbers, due to the constant barrage of heck-

ling they receive from the rager and arcanist varrangoins.

Treated as little better than slaves by their stronger kin,

lesser varrangoins have little sense of their own self-

worth. They love battle, though, and attack any creature

they think is weaker than themselves, even if unprovoked

or if doing so proves detrimental to the flock or the var-

rangoin community.

Lesser varrangoins have long, pointed, batlike ears on

the sides of their heads, and their eyes glow red, white,

blue, or green depending on the individuals breath weapon

(cone of fire, cone of cold, line of lightning, or line of acid,

respectively).This breath weapon is part of their makeup

at birth and never changes. When they use their breath

weapons, their skulls seem to glow from within as their

bodies struggle to control the fierce energy. Lesser varran-

goins are typically about 5 feet tall with a wingspan near

10 feet.

Lesser varrangoins speak their own language and Abyssal

Combat

A lesser varrangoin nearly always begins a fight by attempt-

ing to use its tail sting in a flyby attack. It knows that if its

poison takes hold, an opponent cant easily avoid its breath

weapon, which it uses at the next available opportunity.

Lesser varrangoins always attack an opponent from the air.

Lesser varrangoin flocks rarely engage in complex tactics

since they prefer to mob opponents at random and then

break off singly to attack individual creatures.

Breath Weapon (Ex): Each lesser varrangoin has one

of four breath weapon types: a 30-foot cone of fire, a 30-

foot cone of cold, a 50-foot line of acid, or a 50-foot line of

electricity. A lesser varrangoins breath weapon deals 3d6

points of damage (Reflex DC 13 half ) of the appropriate

energy type.

Death Throes (Ex): When slain (reduced to 10 hit

points), a lesser varrangoin explodes in a 20-foot burst of

energy. This explosion deals 3d6 points of damage (Reflex

DC 13 half ) of the same energy type as the varrangoins

breath weapon.

Poison (Ex): A lesser varrangoin delivers its poison (Fort

DC 13 negates) with each successful tail sting attack. Initial

and secondary damage are the same (1d6 Dex).

Immunities (Ex): A lesser varrangoin is immune to

damage of the same energy type as its breath weapon.

Lesser Varrangoin Characters

A lesser varrangoins favored class is fighter. If given fighter

levels, assume the lesser varrangoin already has the abilities

of a 9th-level fighter. So, a lesser varrangoin who takes one

fighter level gains the abilities of a 10th-level fighter. Its

base save bonuses would increase according to the differ-

ence between a 9th-level and a 10th-level fighter, as would

its base attack bonus.

Rager varrangoins are the equivalent of shock troops.

Volatile in personality and in combat, rager varrangoins are

arrogant and cruel. The joy they get out of tormenting their

lesser brethren is surpassed only by the thrill of combat.

Slightly larger than lesser varrangoins, ragers are also

significantly more muscular. Their rough, black skin

covers thick layers of ropy muscle. Ragers measure 6 to 7

feet in length with a wingspan of 12 to 14 feet. Their ears

are pointed, but smaller and set more on top of their gaunt

heads than those of other varrangoins. In addition, their

claws are much larger than those of either of the other vari-

eties of varrangoin.

Rager varrangoins thoroughly enjoy sinking their large,

heavy claws into an opponents body and ripping it limb

from limb before dropping it to splatter on the ground from

a great height. Their cruelty knows no limits, and they revel

in the fear inspired by their presence.

Rager  varrangoins  speak  their  own  language  and

Abyssal. Some have been known to speak Undercommon

or even Common.

Combat

A rager varrangoin typically begins a battle with its dispel

magic spell-like ability. Ragers then begin to rage and

charge from the air with their tail stings in the hopes of

catching an enemy flat-footed. In the following rounds,

they trigger their fear ability, then attack opponents with

their claws and teeth.

Rage (Ex): Three times per day a rager varrangoin can

fly into a frenzy, raging like a barbarian. For 7 rounds, the

rager varrangoin gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus

to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but

takes a 2 penalty to Armor Class. The following changes

are in effect as long as the rage lasts: HD 8d10+32 (76 hp);

AC  18,  touch  10,  flat-footed  18;  Base  Attack/Grapple

+10/+14; Full Attack 2 claws +15 melee and bite +12 melee

and tail sting +12 melee; Damage claw 1d6+6, bite 1d6+3,

tail sting 1d4+3; SV Fort +10, Will +4; Str 22, Con 18. After

its rage ends, a rager varrangoin is fatigued (2 Str, 2 Dex,

cant charge or run) until the end of the encounter. A rager

varrangoin can choose to end its rage prematurely.

Poison (Ex): A rager varrangoin delivers its poison (Fort

DC 16 negates) with each successful tail sting attack. Initial

and secondary damage are the same (1d6 Dex).

Rend (Ex): If a rager varrangoin hits a single target

with both claws, it latches onto the opponents body and

tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals 2d4+6 points

of damage.

Spell-Like Abilities: 2/daydispel magic, fear. Caster

Extra Action (Su): A rager varrangoin can take an extra

Immunity to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex): A rager var-

rangoin is immune to mind-affecting spells and effects.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A rager varrangoin retains its Dex-

terity bonus to AC even when flat-footed or struck by an

invisible attacker, and it cannot be flanked except by a rogue

of at least 12th level.

Rager Varrangoin Characters

A rager varrangoins favored class is barbarian. If given bar-

barian levels, assume the rager varrangoin already has the

abilities of a 9th-level barbarian. So, a rager varrangoin who

takes one barbarian level gains the abilities of a 10th-level

barbarian. Its base save bonuses would increase according

to the difference between a 9th-level and a 10th-level bar-

barian, as would its base attack bonus.

Primitive, cruel, and elusive, vine horrors are sentient

colonies of algae with the ability to assume a roughly

humanoid form. They stalk swamps and similar areas, and

they attack by surprise whenever possible.

Vine  horrors  are  often  mistaken  for  green-skinned

humanoids with coarse, rough features. A vine horrors fea-

tures appear smooth and somewhat unformed, and when it

speaks, its voice often changes pitch in unusual and seem-

ingly random patterns.

Guided by their own malicious instincts, vine horrors

seek to harm and slay any who enter their territory. Com-

munities located too close to swamps or other vine horror

lairs often suffer nocturnal attacks by animated trees.

Vine horrors speak Sylvan.

COMBAT

Vine horrors often attempt to hide in shallow, algae-filled

water, where they then animate trees to attack foes one at a

time. Unlike treants and similar creatures, vine horrors

care nothing for the trees they animate or the swamps

fights as an assassin vine in all

respects (see the Monster Manual). An

animated vine loses its ability

to fight if the vine horror that

Malleability (Ex): Because

of a vine horrors unusual body

structure, it can compress its body

The vorr is a hateful canine of the Abyss that lurks in the

shadows, waiting for its chance to lunge out and attack.

A vorr stands about 4 feet tall at the shoulder and looks

similar to a black hyena but with a much more intelligent-

looking face. Vorrs are covered with bristly black and gray

fur and have long, ratlike tails.

Vorrs are quite intelligent, and they are capable of hunt-

ing and tracking prey over great distances. Vorrs speak

Abyssal.

COMBAT

Vorrs are rarely encountered alone; they prefer to travel

and hunt in packs. They usually stalk their prey for some

time, so they can observe and learn about any weaknesses.

When they do attack, they flank their opponents to make

full use of their sneak attack ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a vorrs target is denied a

Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a vorr, the

vorr deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a success-

ful melee attack.

Trip (Ex): A vorr that hits with a bite attack can attempt

to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt

fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the vorr.

Outsider Traits: A vorr has darkvision (60-foot range). It

cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or miracle

spell can restore life).

Scent (Ex): A vorr can detect approaching enemies, sniff

out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Shadow Form (Su): Once per day, a vorr can assume

the form of a living shadow for up to 10 min-

utes. While in shadow form, the vorr

can move at normal speed on any sur-

face, including walls and ceilings,

and even across liquids. It can be

detected by effects that detect

thoughts,  life,  or  presences

(including true seeing); other-

wise a vorr gains a +15 cir-

cumstance bonus on Hide

checks.  While  in

shadow  form,  a

vorr gains dam-

age  reduction

50/+5 and is im-

mune to blindness, critical hits,

damage to ability scores from nonmagical attacks, deafness,

disease, drowning, poison, and stunning. It takes half

60 feet per day.

A wendigo is a terrible and hungry nature spirit

that haunts the frozen tundra and forest. Many

believe wendigos to be undead

spirits or evil outsiders, but

in  truth,  they  are  wholly

products of the natural world.

They  are  the  dark  side  of

nature, eternal and hungry

and cruel, forces of canni-

balism,  loneliness,  and

madness made flesh.

A wendigo spends most of

its existence wind walking,

turning solid only to feed on

its victims. At this time, it ap-

pears as a feral, wild-eyed, and

supernaturally quick mockery

of what it once was. A wendigos

eyes sometimes shine with hate-

ful  cold  light,  and  its  mouth  is

often full of sharp, tangled teeth.

Some wendigos are covered with

matted hair, while others are bald.

All wendigos have one thing in

common, though; their legs end

in charred, bloody stumps. As

spirits of the air, they have no

need for feet.

Wendigos speak Sylvan; they

forget any other languages they

knew in their previous life.

Combat

Wendigo

The sample wendigo presented here uses a 4th-level human

sorcerer as the base creature.

Disease (Su): For this wendigo, the Fortitude save DC to

resist the infection is 16, and the Will save DC to avoid the

insatiable hunger is 17. See the template description, below,

for more information.

Maddening Whispers (Su): For this wendigo, the Will

save DC to resist this special attack is 17. See the template

description, below, for more information.

Ravenous Bite (Ex): A wendigo threatens a critical hit

on a natural roll of 1820 when attacking with its bite, and

deals triple damage on a successful critical hit. A wound

resulting from a critical hit bleeds for an additional 3 points

of damage per round thereafter. See the template descrip-

tion, below, for more information.

Spells: This wendigo is a 4th-level sorcerer (spells/day

6/8/4, save DC 15 + spell level). Spells known: 0dancing

lights, daze, detect magic, ray of frost, read magic, resistance; 1st

chill touch, magic missile, shield; 2ndinvisibility.

Cold Subtype (Ex): A wendigo is immune to cold dam-

age. It takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal

from fire, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed,

or if the save is a success or a failure.

Corner of the Eye (Su): A wendigo that

stalks a victim while wind walking always

seems to lurk just at the corner of its

chosen victims field of vision.

This victim takes a 2 penalty on

all Wisdom-based skill checks as

long as the wendigo stalks him.

Regeneration (Ex): Fire deals

normal  damage  to  a  wendigo.

Attack forms that dont deal hit

point damage ignore regeneration,

and a wendigo does not restore hit

points lost from starvation, thirst,

or suffocation.

Wind Walk (Su): A wendigo

can wind walk at will, transform-

ing from physical form to incor-

poreal form or back again as a

move action.

THE WENDIGO

TEMPLATE

Wendigo is an acquired template

that can be added to any animal,

giant, humanoid, magical beast,

or monstrous humanoid (referred

to hereafter as the base creature),

although  the  vast  majority  of

wendigo were once animals or

humanoids. A wendigos type changes

to fey, and it gains the cold subtype. It otherwise

uses all of the base creatures statistics and special abilities

except as noted below.

Hit Dice: Change to d6.

Speed: A wendigo gains a fly speed of 120 feet (perfect),

unless its previous fly speed was better, in which case the

base creatures fly speed is retained. The wendigo loses all

Special Attacks: A wendigo retains all the special attacks

of the base creature and gains the following special attacks.

Disease (Su): Any creature hit by a wendigos bite attack

must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 wendigos

HD + wendigos Con modifier) or become infected with

the wendigos hunger. The incubation period is 1d3 days,

and the disease deals 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Addi-

tionally, each day that a victim takes Wisdom damage from

the disease, he must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2

wendigos HD + wendigos Cha modifier) or become over-

whelmed with an insatiable hunger for the flesh of its own

race. The victim stalks and tries to kill the closest member

of its own race; if it does so, it feeds on the victims body

and then returns home with no memory of the tragic

event. If a victim of this hunger is reduced to a Wisdom

score of 0, he transforms into a wendigo immediately and

races off into the night sky at such speed that his feet burn

away into bloody, charred stumps.

Maddening Whispers (Su): A wendigo may use its madden-

ing whispers on any one target within 120 feet once per day.

The wendigo may use this ability while wind walking. Only

the chosen victim can hear the insane whispers and invita-

tions of the wendigo. The victim must make a successful

Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 wendigos HD + wendigos Cha mod-

ifier) or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage. Typically, a

wendigo stalks a chosen victim for days, wearing down the

victims Wisdom score until it attacks and attempts to bring

down its disease upon the poor soul. A wendigo will stop

stalking a target that resists the maddening whispers for

more than three days and fly off to seek easier prey.

Ravenous Bite (Ex): A wendigo threatens a critical hit on a

natural roll of 1820 when attacking with its bite, and deals

triple damage on a successful critical hit. A wound resulting

from a critical hit bleeds for an additional 3 points of

damage per round thereafter. Multiple wounds from such

attacks result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 6

points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can be

stopped only by a successful Heal check (DC 10) or the

application of any cure spell or other healing spell (heal, heal-

ing circle, or the like).

Special Qualities: A wendigo retains all the special qual-

ities of the base creature and gains the following special

qualities as well.

Cold Subtype (Ex): A wendigo is immune to cold damage. It

takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire,

regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the

save is a success or a failure.

Corner of the Eye (Su): A wendigo that stalks a victim while

wind walking always seems to lurk just at the corner of its

chosen victims field of vision. This victim takes a 2 penalty

on all Wisdom-based skill checks as long as the wendigo

stalks him.

Regeneration 5 (Ex): Fire deals normal damage to a wendigo.

Wind Walk (Su): A wendigo can wind walk at will, trans-

forming from physical form to incorporeal form or back

again as a move action.

Abilities: Increase from base creature as follows: Str +4,

Dex +8, Con +4, Wis +2, Cha +4.

Skills: Same as the base creature, except that the wendigo

gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Move Silently, and Survival

checks.

Feats: Same as the base creature, except that the wendigo

gains Track.

Climate/Terrain: Cold forests.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.

A wicker man is a huge, hollow structure of branches and

vines crudely woven into the form of a human. A tall

crown of twigs juts up from its featureless head, and its

arms end in massive bundles of sharp branches that it uses

to snatch up creatures and to toss them through the cage

door in its chest.

A wicker man is usually created for a festival by a druid

or cleric in a community that reveres a deity such as

Nerull. During these festivals, criminals and other

undesirables are locked within the wicker man,

and it is set aflame. If no such person is avail-

able, the people of the village sometimes

seek to entice a foreigner to the site of the

sacrifice. On those rare occasions

when a sacrificial victim escapes, a

druid can sometimes find the power

to animate a wicker man after a suit-

able  sacrifice  of  innocents. The

druid then sends out the wicker

man to retrieve the escapee.

COMBAT

A wicker man follows the commands of

its creator, killing or capturing as in-

structed. The  wicker  mans  creator  can

command the construct if it is within 60 feet

and it can see and hear its creator. When not

being given an order, a wicker man generally

follows the last order it received to the best

of its ability, though if attacked it returns

the attack. Its creator can give a wicker

man a simple program to follow in her

absence, such as Capture four people and

return, or Remain here and attack all

who come near.

Wicker man

Encage: A wicker man can attempt to

encage  foes  of  Large  or  smaller  size  by

making a successful grapple check. Victims

of this attack are tossed inside the wicker

mans chest cavity. The wicker man deals

no damage to foes thus encaged unless

it has been set aflame (see Flammable Body, below). An

encaged foe can force its way out with a successful opposed

grapple check (grapple bonus +26). An encaged victim can

also cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing

weapon to deal 20 points of damage (AC 14), or with a suc-

cessful Escape Artist check (DC 20). If a creature cuts its

way out, the wicker reknits; another encaged opponent

must cut its own way out. A wicker mans interior can hold

3 Large, 6 Medium-size, 12 Small, 24 Tiny, 48 Diminutive,

or 96 Fine opponents.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a wicker man hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

slam attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +26). If it gets a hold, it can

encage the foe with another successful grapple check.

Alternatively, the wicker man has the option to conduct

the grapple normally, or simply use its

arm to hold the opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but the wicker man is

not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check it makes

during successive rounds automatically

deals slam damage.

Construct Traits: A wicker man is im-

mune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also

works on objects. The creature is not

subject to critical hits, subdual dam-

age, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from mas-

sive damage. It cannot heal dam-

age  to  itself  but  can  be  healed

through repair. It cannot be raised or

resurrected. A wicker man has darkvision

(60-foot range).

Flaming Body (Ex): When exposed to fire, a

wicker man becomes sheathed in flames. (The

construct is not damaged by these flames because of its

fire immunity.) Anyone within 30 feet of a flaming

wicker man must make a successful Fortitude save

(DC 16) or take 1d6 points of fire damage from the

intense heat. Treat this effect as a burst that continu-

ally radiates from the creature. Anyone touched by a

flaming wicker man must succeed on a Reflex save (DC

16) or take 2d6 points of fire damage. Foes grappling

with a flaming wicker man take 4d6 points of fire

damage, and foes encaged within a wicker man while

it is flaming take 6d6 points of fire damage each

round. (Thus, a foe encaged within a flaming

wicker man that attempts escape by grappling

would  take  6d6  points  of  fire  damage  on  the

wicker  mans  initiative  count  and  another  4d6

points of fire damage when the foe makes a grapple

attempt to escape on its initiative count.) A wicker man

set afire flames for 10 minutes. After it has finished flam-

ing, it cannot be relit by fire or fire-based effects until 5

rounds have passed.

Hardness (Ex): A wicker man has hardness 5. Subtract

5 points from all damage the wicker man would take.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): Wicker men are immune to

all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except

as follows. A warp wood or wood shape spell opens its cage

door for 1 round. Being in the area of an entangle spell when

it is cast heals a wicker man of 2d8 points of damage. Fire

and fire-based effects engage the wicker mans flammable

body ability.

Immunity to Piercing (Ex): Piercing weapons, even

magic ones, deal no damage to a wicker man.

WICKER MAN CONSTRUCTION

A wicker man is made from green vines and branches cut

from ancient oak and darkwood trees; the total weight of

these materials must be at least 800 pounds.

A wicker man costs 70,000 gp to create, which includes

3,000 gp for the wood and 20,000 gp for special alchemical

herbs and oils that must be used to treat the wood. Assem-

bling the body requires a successful Craft (woodworking)

check (DC 17) and a successful Craft (alchemy) check

(DC 15).

The creator must be 16th level and able to cast divine

spells. Completing the ritual drains 2,800 XP from the cre-

ator and requires entangle, liveoak, and protection from energy.

A yellow musk creeper is an immense climbing plant with

long, grasping green tendrils and large, vibrant leaves. Beau-

tiful yellow and purple orchidlike flowers positioned

throughout the creatures body emit a heady, entrancing

odor. The plants musk draws victims to the heart of the

creeper, where hungry, naturally sharp vines probe at its

head, extracting brain matter in gluttonous gulps. Drained

victims become yellow musk zombies, mindless servants

who care for the insidious plant.

Despite their bulk, yellow musk creepers react swiftly to

potential prey and maneuver their flowers within spraying

distance. The plants grow from a single bulbous root that is

submerged beneath the creature alongside the buried trap-

pings of previous victims.

Yellow musk creepers usually grow in underground

regions that have some amount of loose soil, and they

shrink from direct sunlight. Occasionally the plants thrive

under the canopy of deep woods or forests. They make

excellent guards, and some have been deliberately planted

in a given location to protect nearby treasure. Particularly

paranoid hoarders sometimes bury their treasure several

feet below the base of the plant.

COMBAT

A yellow musk creeper has a symbiotic relationship with

the yellow musk zombies it creates. The zombies attempt

to protect the yellow musk creeper to the best of their abil-

ity. The creeper attempts to ensnare any living creature

that approaches within range of its musk, and it defends

itself with its vines only if it comes under attack.

A yellow musk creeper can be summoned using a summon

natures ally IV spell.

Consume Intelligence (Ex): As a free action, a yellow

musk creeper can extend dozens of probing, sharp-edged

tendrils into the head of any helpless or unresisting crea-

ture that also occupies its space. These tendrils begin to

devour the victims brain, dealing 1d4 points of Intelli-

gence  damage  each  round.  If  the  damage  reduces  a

victims Intelligence to 0, the victim must make a Forti-

tude save (DC 18). Those who fail die, and their bodies

grant sustenance to the hungry plant. Those who succeed

are implanted with a seed and become yellow musk zom-

bies (see the next entry).

The only way to stop a yellow musk creeper from con-

suming a victims Intelligence is to kill either the victim or

the creeper.

Musk Puff (Ex): Yellow musk creepers attack by puff-

ing a spray of potent-smelling dust upon a nearby target.

The musk has a range of 30 feet and can target one creature

per round.

Creatures struck by a yellow musk creepers musk puff

must make a Fortitude save (DC 18) or fall under a mind-

affecting compulsion to get closer to the entrancing source

of the musk. The duration of the effect is 2d8 rounds,

although creatures within the plant remain under the com-

pulsion until removed from the creeper.

Creatures under the yellow musk creepers compulsion

can take no actions other than moving to enter the plants

space. (The creeper does not oppose these attempts, of

course.) Affected creatures do anything they can to comply

with the compulsion and even attack companions who seek

to restrain them. Once within the plant, the affected crea-

ture drops anything in hand and stands motionless. The

creature is dazed and does not resist the creepers attacks as

long as it remains within the plant.

Blindsight (Ex): A yellow musk creeper maneuvers and

fights not only by sight, but also by using hearing and smell

to ascertain its surroundings. This ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and creatures within 30 feet. The yellow musk

creeper usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range of its blindsight.

Plant Traits (Ex): A yellow musk creeper is immune to

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is

not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects.

Regeneration (Ex): Fire and acid deal normal damage

to a yellow musk creeper. Attack forms that dont deal hit

point damage ignore regeneration, and a yellow musk

creeper does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Yellow musk zombies are not zombies at all, though their low

groans, sickly yellow skin, and vacant stares lead many to

believe they are undead. Rather, the wretched creatures are

all that remains of victims of the deadly yellow musk creeper.

During their thankfully brief lives, yellow musk zombies do

everything within their power to protect and support the

plant that spawned them.

Outwardly, a yellow musk zombie orc resembles a

normal member of its species except for its hollow, dead

eyes and pallid, jaundiced skin. It has another important

distinction that cannot be seen with the naked eye: When

the yellow musk creeper responsible for its transforma-

tion devours a creatures brain, it leaves a fleshy seed

within the creatures head that slowly germinates over a

period of two months.

The mindless zombies are not truly evil, though their

unswerving loyalty to their progenitor makes them deter-

mined and deadly opponents. A yellow musk zombie retains

a vestige of intelligence, although it is incapable of using

abilities or skills requiring special training or knowledge

(including most class abilities or any tool or device more

complicated than a weapon).

COMBAT

Yellow musk zombies fight on behalf of their patron and

attempt to find new victims for it by dragging them into

the yellow musk creepers presence. They instinctively try

to avoid killing potential victims, preferring to grapple or

subdue intruders in order to bring living prey to their

plant master. If their parent plant comes under attack,

they quickly turn to lethal attacks to defend the yellow

musk creeper.

The sample yellow musk zombie presented here uses a

1st-level orc warrior as the base creature.

Creeper Loyalty (Ex): A yellow musk zombie orc

always  acts  to  protect  and  nurture  the  yellow  musk

creeper that created it. It can range no farther than 100

feet from its progenitor for the first two months of its exis-

tence. Thereafter, it wanders freely for 1d4 days before

dropping dead. Unless cured (see below), a yellow musk

zombie orc automatically dies two days after the death of

its patron creeper.

Deadened Mind (Ex): A yellow musk zombie orc recalls

nothing of its previous life, and it exists only to serve its

parent plant. It cannot make use of class abilities, skills, or

feats it previously knew. It also cannot use magic devices,

although it can still wield weapons and use armor.

Light Sensitivity (Ex): Orcs take a 1 penalty on

attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of a day-

light spell.

Plant Traits (Ex): A yellow musk zombie orc is immune

to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and polymorphing. It is

not subject to critical hits or mind-affecting effects. The

creature also has low-light vision.

Seeded (Ex): If a yellow musk zombie orc dies, the grow-

ing seed inside its head takes root and grows into a yellow

musk creeper within 1 hour.

Organization: Solitary or gang (28).

Treasure: Same as the base creature

(although the zombie retains only

whatever it was wearing or carry-

ing when transformed).

Alignment: Always neutral.

Curing a Yellow Musk Zombie

A yellow musk zombies patron plant must be killed before

the zombie can be cured of its affliction. Thereafter, a cleric

of at least 12th level must cast regenerate or heal upon the

character before the implanted seed germinates.

Revered as divine incarnations of their unspeakable deity,

these creatures are the most loathsome form of the vile

yuan-ti race. They represent such a perversion of their origi-

nal human nature that their very existence is heresy against

all the deities of humanity, no matter how evilthus, they

proudly call themselves anathema.

An anathemas basic shape is that of an enormous ser-

pent, some 25 feet long. A pair of arms and the vague shape

of a humanoid torso are the last vestiges of its original

humanity. The arms end in clawed hands with only three

fingers. In place of a head, six long serpents project from

the top of the torso, allowing the creature to see in all

directions and attack as many as eight different opponents

at once. The creatures scales range in shade from deep

maroon to midnight blue or violet black, usually lighter on

the torso and underbelly. Its twelve eyes glitter yellow

with malice and intelligence. It has a musky odor about it

that most mammals find unsettling.

Like other yuan-ti, anathemas speak their own language,

plus Common, Draconic, and Abyssal

COMBAT

When found with other yuan-ti, an anathema prefers to let

its minions handle the mundane work of melee combat

while it uses its psionics and spell-like abilities to weaken

the enemy ranks. Alone, or when forced into melee, an

anathema grapples opponents, using its dissolving touch

psionic power to melt foes in its grasp, and blasting ene-

mies who are hanging back from combat (archers and spell-

casters) with its spell-like abilities.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check, an

anathema can constrict a grabbed opponent, dealing 1d8+8

points of bludgeoning damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If an anathema hits an oppo-

nent that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with a bite attack, it deals normal damage and attempts

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an

attack of opportunity (grapple bonus +32). If it gets a

hold, it also constricts on the same round. Thereafter, the

anathema has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use one of its six serpent-heads to hold

the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the

anathema is not considered grappled). It usually chooses

the latter option.

Poison (Ex): An anathema delivers its poison (Fort DC

30 negates) with each successful bite attack. Initial and

secondary damage are the same (1d4 Con).

Psionics (Sp): An anathema can produce the following

effects at will.

Alternate Form: An anathema can assume the form of a

Tiny to Huge viper (see the Monster Manual). In viper form,

the anathemas poison deals 1d6 points of Constitution dam-

age instead of 1d4.

In addition, an anathema can assume the form of a viper

swarm (described earlier in this book).

Chameleon Power: An anathema can change the coloration

of itself and its equipment to match its surroundings. *An

anathema using chameleon power receives a +10 circumstance

bonus on Hide checks.

Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 20th-level sorcerer.

Dissolving Touch: An anathema can exude acid from its

body, dealing 7d6 points of acid damage to anything it

touches. If it uses this power when grappling or constrict-

ing an opponent, the acid deals 10d6 points of damage

instead. The acid is effective only on the round when this

power is used, and it becomes inert when it leaves the

anathemas body.

Mass Aversion: An anathema creates a compulsion effect

targeting all enemies within 30 feet. The targets must suc-

ceed on a Will save (DC 27) or gain an aversion to snakes

for 10 minutes. Affected subjects must stay at least 20 feet

from any snake, yuan-ti, or ti-khana creature (described

earlier in this book), whether alive or dead; if already

within 20 feet, they move away. A subject can overcome

the compulsion by succeeding on another Will save (DC

27), but still suffers from deep anxiety. This causes a 4

reduction to Dexterity until the effect wears off or the

subject is no longer within 20 feet of a snake, yuan-ti, or ti-

khana creature. This ability is otherwise similar to antipathy

as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/dayanimal trance, cause fear,

deeper darkness, entangle, haste, neutralize poison, suggestion, bale-

ful polymorph, unholy blight; 1/dayblasphemy, unholy aura.

Caster level 20th; save DC 16 + spell level.

All-Around Vision (Ex): An anathemas six heads allow

it to see in all directions at once. Because of this ability, it

has a +4 racial bonus on Search and Spot checks, and it

cannot be flanked.

Attach Grafts (Su): An anathema has the ability to

transform humanoid and monstrous humanoid creatures,

making them more like yuan-ti. Each day, an anathema

can attach eight yuan-ti grafts (described later in this

book) to one or more creatures. This requires 1 hour of

uninterrupted work per graft, during which the anathema

can do nothing else. Between grafts, the anathema can rest

or engage in light activity such as talking or walking, but

cannot  fight,  cast  spells,  use  magic  items,  conduct

research, or perform any other physically or mentally

demanding task.

In  addition,  anathemas  can  create  the  mixture  of

venom, roots, and herbs required to create either a tainted

one or a broodguard (described in Savage Species and Monster

Compendium: Monsters of Faern).

Regeneration (Ex): An anathema takes normal damage

from force effects and adamantine weapons. Attack forms

that dont deal hit point damage ignore regeneration, and an

anathema does not restore hit points lost from starvation,

thirst, or suffocation.

Scent (Ex): An anathema can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: Anathemas have a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened. Anathemas have a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action

or avoid a hazard and can always choose to take 10 on

Swim checks, even if distracted or endangered. Anathemas

have a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking

by scent.

ANATHEMA SOCIETY

Anathemas are extremely rare among the yuan-ti, and

yuan-ti society as a whole seems not quite sure what to do

with them. They are never found in yuan-ti cities, for the

power they represent is such a destabilizing force that

order and structure collapse around them. Many live as

solitary outcasts in the wilds near larger collections of

yuan-ti.

Most anathemas, however, quickly gather cults of other

yuan-ti around them, sometimes involuntarily. The most

warped and unstable yuan-ti of that whole warped and

unstable species are irresistibly drawn to the unspeakable

evil that the anathemas exude, and a violent cult is the

natural result.

A cult centered around an anathema is always a plague on

the surrounding lands. No race or kind of creature can live

in peace with such a cult nearby, for the yuan-ti will not rest

until they have obliterated any other civilization within a

weeks travel of their lair. An anathemas only creed is anni-

hilation in service to the great serpent who, the yuan-ti

believe, will one day devour the world.

ANATHEMA ITEMS

Anathemas are known for a number of unique items, both

magical and mundane. Finding these items in the hands of

lesser yuan-ti is an almost certain sign that they are mem-

bers of an anathema cult.

Blasphemous Weapons: Weapons with this property

are a blight upon the world, and a paladin or good cleric

who learns of ones existence is duty-bound to work

unceasingly toward its destruction. A blasphemous weapon

is evilly aligned due to the fiendish spirit bound within it.

Like an unholy weapon, it deals 2d6 points of bonus

unholy (evil) damage against all of good alignment; on a

critical hit this damage is increased to 2d10 and the

weapon unleashes a limited blasphemy effect that targets

only the creature hit.

A blasphemous weapon bestows two negative levels on

any good creature attempting to wield it. The negative levels

remain as long as the weapon is in hand and disappear when

the weapon is no longer wielded. These negative levels

never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be over-

come in any way (including restoration spells) while the

weapon is wielded. Blasphemous bows, crossbows, and

slings bestow the property upon their ammunition.

Anathemas often equip their most powerful cultists

with blasphemous scimitars and falchions.

Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, blasphemy, unholy blight, creator must be evil; Market

Price: +4 bonus.

Serpent Symbol: This silver disk represents the world

with a snake coiled around it, mouth gaping wide as if to

consume it. This is a holy symbol used by anathema cults,

symbolizing their devotion to destruction and giving

them some concrete magical abilities to back it up. Once

per day, a serpent symbol can generate either a disintegrate

spell or a destruction spell, according to the command of the

wearer. The save DC for both effects is 20. The device func-

tions only in the hands of a yuan-ti. (However, a character

with the Use Magic Device skill can emulate the yuan-ti

race to make the serpent symbol function.)

Caster Level: 13th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

Heighten Spell, destruction, disintegrate, creator must be a

yuan-ti; Market Price: 50,000 gp.

Sickening Weapon: A sickening weapon functions as

an unholy weapon that releases extra unholy power upon

striking a successful critical hit against a good creature. The

struck creature hit must make a successful Fortitude save

(DC 16) or take a 2 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage

rolls, saves, skill checks, and

ability checks for

1d4 rounds.

Yuan-ti anathema

Lower-level yuan-ti cultists often wield sickening weapons.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, unholy blight, creator must be evil; Market Price: +3

bonus.

Venomous Fire: This alchemical creation is an insidious

method of delivering toxic venom. In essence, venomous

fire is similar to alchemists fireit is a viscous substance

that burns when exposed to air. However, it is also mixed

with yuan-ti venom, so that, in the round after taking any

damage from the fire itself, a character must make a Forti-

tude saving throw (DC 17) against the poison that entered

the body through the wounds from the fire. Initial and sec-

ondary damage from the poison are the same (1d6 Con). If

the fire is allowed to burn for another round (thus causing

the character to take damage on successive rounds), the

character is exposed to two doses of poison.

A flask of venomous fire is a grenadelike weapon with a

range increment of 10 feet. It deals 1d6 points of fire damage

on a direct hit, plus 1d6 points of fire damage in the next

round if it is not extinguished (requiring a full-round action

and a Reflex save against DC 15). A splash deals 1 point of

fire damage, and a target hit by the splash has +4 circum-

stance bonus on the Fortitude save against the poison.

Cost: 220 gp; Weight: 1 lb.

ANATHEMA CHARACTERS

An anathemas favored class is cleric. Like other yuan-ti

clerics, anathemas worship Merrshaulk and can choose

any two of the following domains: Chaos, Evil, Destruc-

tion, and Plant.

Because of its numerous special

abilities, an anathema PCs effective

character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level + 28. Thus, a 1st-level

anathema cleric has an ECL

of 29 and is the equivalent

of a 29th-level character.

YUGOLOTH

Called the greediest, most selfish beings in the Outer

Planes, yugoloths foul the word mercenary by offering

their combat prowess to the highest bidder. Yugoloths

take joy in inflicting pain on others, and they often serve

powerful demons or devils as torturers, messengers, or

bodyguards.

Yugoloths speak Abyssal, Draconic, and Infernal.

COMBAT

In general, yugoloths are focused combatants. They choose

one opponent out of a group and attack until it falls, then

move on to the next foe. Vigorous fighters, they start with

their best attacks and spell-like abilities.

All yugoloths have the following special abilities in

common.

Outsider Traits: A yugoloth has darkvision (60-foot

range). It cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish or

miracle spell can restore life).

Summon Yugoloth (Sp): Most yugoloths can summon

others of their kind as though casting a summon monster

spell, but they have only a limited chance of success. Roll d%

and compare the result to the die range given in the yugo-

loths specific description: On a failure, no yugoloths answer

the summons. Summoned creatures remain for 1 hour, then

return whence they came. A yugoloth that is itself sum-

moned cannot use its own summon ability for 1 hour.

Yugoloth Traits: A yugoloth is immune to poison and

acid. It has cold, fire, and electricity resistance 10. Yugoloths

can communicate telepathically with any creature within

100 feet that has a language.

Sergeants and overseers of the yugoloth armies, pis-

coloths hold dictatorial sway over companies of lesser

yugoloths.

The fish-tailed, walleyed piscoloth has the red, chitinous

body of a lobster, the talons of a bird, and the head of a car-

rion crawler. The piscoloths arms, though humanoid, end in

a set of crablike pincers.

Cruel, hateful bullies, piscoloths keep order in the

yugoloth armiesa task well suited to their petty and

tyrannical demeanor.

Combat

Piscoloths drive the direct tactics of the yugoloth armies.

They wade into battle, using their stinking cloud ability

and their incredibly sharp pincers to great effect. Typi-

cally in charge of lesser yugoloths, piscoloths usually

order their subordinates into combat before entering the

fray themselves.

A piscoloth can be summoned using a summon monster

VII spell.

Augmented Critical (Ex): A piscoloths pincer attack

threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 1920. On

a successful critical hit with a pincer attack, it deals triple

damage.

Paralysis (Ex): Those hit by a piscoloths tentacle attack

must make a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be paralyzed for

2d6 minutes.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblink, fear, detect good, detect

magic, protection from good, scare, see invisibility; 3/daymeld

into stone, phantasmal killer, stinking cloud. Caster level 9th;

save DC 12 + spell level.

Twice per day, a piscoloth can use greater teleport (self plus

maximum load of objects only) as the spell cast by a 9th-

level sorcerer.

Summon Yugoloth (Sp): Three times per day, a piscoloth

can attempt to summon 4 skeroloths with a 60% chance of

success (result of 41100 on d%).

pqs

PISCOLOTHS AND MANUAL OF THE PLANES

If  you  have  incorporated  Manual  of  the  Planes into  your  campaign,

piscoloths should have access to more summoning options. Instead

of attempting to summon 4 skeroloths, a piscoloth can attempt to

summon  1d3  mezzoloths  with  a  30%  chance  of  success  (result  of

71100 on d%).

Spies, thieves,

i n f i l t r a t o r s ,

and  wretched

scum, the skero-

loths are the dregs

of the yugoloth

armies. They serve

because they must,

fawning  over  the

nearest powerful yu-

goloth and betraying

former masters when-

ever given a glimpse

of  richer  rewards.

Skeroloths are quick

to attack those they

think weak, and even

quicker to cry out for

mercy when threat-

ened by more pow-

erful foes.

Skeroloth

JE

The insectoid skeroloth has six legs and moves about

equally well on two, four, or all six of its limbs. The pale red-

gray skin of a skeroloth fades to a milky white whenever the

creature is frightened, which is nearly all the time.

Other yugoloths regard skeroloths as weak and worthless.

Although they are driven into battle ahead of more formi-

dable fighting units, no one really thinks of the wretches

as a real fighting force. Skeroloths are at their most useful as

spies, and they are often sent on scouting missions.

A skeroloth can be summoned using a summon monster

IV spell.

Combat

Hiding and ambushing is about all skeroloths know of fight-

ing. Often herded into battle by more powerful yugoloths,

skeroloths are unreliable combatants unless it appears they

have the upper hand. When they encounter creatures

weaker than themselves, groups of skeroloths swarm over

them, dragging down larger foes with sheer numbers.

hazard and can always choose to take 10 on Swim

The yurian is a bizarre hybrid of crustacean and humanoid

features found in coastal caves. Though not generally

aggressive, yurians sometimes launch raids against other

creatures in times of food shortage.

A yurian stands erect like a biped, usually walking on two

of its six limbs. The middle two limbs are tipped with small

pincers that the creature uses for fine manipulation. The

upper two are thicker and stronger, and end in heavy

clawst. A yurians back is covered with a heavy shell, while

smaller, more flexible plates protect its belly and limbs.

Two eyestalks emerge from the top of the shell, bobbing

above a complex mouth. Its coloration ranges from bright

red or orange to more muted tones of reddish-brown, green,

or black. Most yurians stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, but

they continue to grow throughout their lives, and an older

specimen can reach a height of 10 feet or more.

Yurians are simple hunter-gatherers, subsisting primarily

on carrion and aquatic plants. Their crafts are simple though

often beautiful: seaweed weavings, driftwood carvings, and

seashell constructions.

Yurian speak Aquan. They can breathe air or water.

COMBAT

Yurians use their large claws in combat. The males of certain

yurian tribes have one en-

larged claw that deals 1d8

points of damage plus the

creatures Strength

b o n u s .

Yurian

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a skeroloths target is denied

a Dexterity bonus, or when a target is flanked by a skeroloth,

the skeroloth deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a

successful melee attack.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdaze, detect good, jump;

3/dayburning hands, expeditious retreat. Caster level 4th;

save DC 10 + spell level.

Summon Yugoloth (Sp): Once per day, a skeroloth can

attempt to summon 1 skeroloth with a 40% chance of suc-

cess (result of 61100 on d%).

Cringe (Su): As a standard action, a skeroloth can

cower in fear. This is a mind-affecting effect. Any oppo-

nent attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack a

cringing skeroloth, even with a targeted spell, must

attempt a Will save (DC 12). If the save succeeds, the

opponent can attack normally and is immune to the

effect of that skeroloths cringing for one day. If the save

fails, the opponent cant follow through with the attack,

that part of the attackers action is lost, and the attacker

cant directly attack that skeroloth for as long as it contin-

ues to cringe. If the skeroloth stops cringing and then

cringes again, the opponent may attempt a new Will save

to attack it.

Skills: Skeroloths have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and

Move Silently checks. Skeroloths also have a +8 racial bonus

on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb

checks, even if rushed or threatened.

body parts as part of their natural healing ability. If a yurian

loses a limb or eyestalk, the lost part regrows as soon as the

They have a +8 racial bonus on any

YURIAN CHARACTERS

A yurians favored class is barbar-

ian. Yurian spellcasters are usually

adepts or druids. Their few clerics

revere ancestral spirits, and can

choose from the domains of Heal-

ing, Luck, Protection, and Water.

A yurian PCs effective charac-

Incredibly powerful, enigmatic constructs of unknown

origin, zodars resemble animated suits of polished black

plate armor. Some are beautifully ornate, while others are

plain and simply functional. They are made not of metal,

but some sort of ceramic substance surrounding a solid

mass of muscle capable of producing tremendous bursts

of strength.

Zodars seldom, if ever, talk. A zodar never speaks more

than  one  sentence  during  a  typical

human lifetime. Even then, the utter-

ance may be no more than a sentence

fragment, but whatever the zodar says is

certain to be important. Every character

within hearing understands the state-

ment, regardless of what languages it

knows (treat such characters as though

affected by a tongues spell of instanta-

neous duration).

A

R

Occasionally,  a  zodar  attaches

itself  to  group  of  adventurers  and

accompanies them on their travels.

It may participate in their adven-

tures or it may simply tag along,

silently observing.

COMBAT

Zodars never initiate an attack but fight in self-

defense. Most often they rely on their bare hands,

but some zodars (10%) favor magic weapons.

Constrict (Ex): When fight-

ing barehanded, a zodar seldom

punches. Instead it attempts to

grapple normally (grapple bonus

+19). If the grapple attempt succeeds, then

the zodar constricts its foe, dealing 1d6+7

points of damage each round the hold

is maintained.

Burst of Strength (Ex): Three times per day, a zodar can

double its Strength to 50 for 1 round (Str bonus +20).

Construct Traits: A zodar is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. The creature

is not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. It cannot heal itself but can be healed through

repair. It cannot be raised or resurrected. A zodar has dark-

vision (60-foot range).

Invulnerability (Ex): A zodar is impervious to all attacks

except those from bludgeoning weapons, and the enhance-

ment bonus (if any) of such a weapon is disregarded when

determining the result of the attack.

Wish (Su): Once per year, a zodar can alter reality as if it

had just cast a wish spell as a sorcerer of the same level as its

Hit Dice. None has ever been known to actually use this

ability more than once in a century. Even when the effect of

the wish is of great importance, it is likely to be subtle and

largely unrecognized as the work of the zodar.

APPENDIX 1:

PRESTIGE CLASSES

This appendix showcases a variety of fiend-focused prestige

classes. They present interesting and diverse opportunities

for outsiders with the evil subtype.

CLASS SKILLS

The fiend of blasphemys class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy

(Cha), Disguise (Cha), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen

(Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and

Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

FIEND OF BLASPHEMY

Mortal creatures seem to have an innate drive to offer wor-

ship to deities and form associations of a religious nature.

The fiend of blasphemy is a master of the infernal art of per-

verting this natural desire and turning it toward the corrupt

veneration of fiendish masters. Adept at exploiting mortal

weaknesses, a fiend of blasphemy forms a diabolical cult

whose members are hopelessly bound to the fiend, to the

eventual damnation of their souls.

As the name suggests, only fiends can acquire and

advance in the fiend of blasphemy prestige class. Some can

qualify without any levels in other classes at all, while others

gain levels, usually as clerics, before joining the prestige

class. Some fiendish sorcerers and bards, and occasionally

wizards as well, use powers of illusion and enchantment to

help them deceive mortals and lure them into blasphemous

cults. Martial-minded fiends, with levels as fighters, rangers,

or barbarians, occasionally form cults made up of brigands,

pirates, or mercenaries.

Fiends of blasphemy almost always work alone. Their ulti-

mate purpose is to drive mortals away from the worship of

true deities, especially good deities, and win their souls to

the Lower Planes.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a fiend of blasphemy, a character must

fulfill the following criteria.

Race: Outsider with the evil subtype.

Base Save Bonus: Will +7.

Skills: Bluff 10 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 10 ranks.

Feats: Leadership.

Special: Must have at least one spell-like ability that

duplicates a spell effect of 4th level or higher.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the fiend of blasphemy

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fiends of blasphemy

gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spells: Beginning at 1st level, a fiend of blasphemy

gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To

cast a spell, the fiend of blasphemy must have a Wisdom

score of at least 10 + the spells level, so a fiend of blas-

phemy with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these

spells. Fiend of blasphemy bonus spells are based on

Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + the fiends Wisdom modifier (if any).

When the fiend gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-

level spells at 1st level, the fiend of blasphemy gets only

bonus spells (in addition to a domain spell slot, which it

receives at every spell level). A fiend of blasphemy without

a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that

level except for its domain spell. The fiend of blasphemys

spell list appears below. A fiend of blasphemy prepares and

casts spells just as a cleric does.

A fiend of blasphemy gains access to two of its patron

deitys domains. A fiend of blasphemy can choose prestige

domains (described in Defenders of the Faith) offered by its

deity. As with a cleric, each domain gives the fiend access to

a domain spell at each spell level as well as a granted power.

The fiend prepares one or the other of the available domain

spells at each spell level each day.

Blood Oath (Su): A fiend of blasphemy has the ability to

perform a ritual of initiation that binds cult members to the

fiends service. The ritual forges a magical, mental bond

between the fiend and those mortals who participate. It

requires one day of preparation, during which time the

fiend must meditate and ready a room in which the ritual

will take place. The ritual itself lasts for 2 hours, plus an addi-

tional 10 minutes per mortal initiate. If either the prepara-

tion or the ritual is interrupted, the process is ruined and the

fiend must start again.

All creatures in the room (and no more than 60 feet away

from the fiend of blasphemy) when the ritual begins or

that enter that area during the ritual must make a Will save

(DC 10 + fiends class level + fiends Cha modifier) or be

affected as if by an enthrall spell. Willing participants in the

ritual receive a 4 penalty on this saving throw, while hos-

tile onlookers receive a +4 bonus.

After the first 2 hours of the

ritual,  each  initiate  is  sub-

jected to the fiends indi-

vidual  attention  for  10

minutes, during which

time the bond between

the two is formed. If

an initiate wishes to

resist the bond, she

can  attempt  a  Will

saving throw (DC 15

+ fiends class level +

fiends  Cha  modi-

fier). Willing partic-

ipants may volun-

tarily  fail  their

saving  throws.  If

an initiate makes a

successful saving

throw, the fiend of

blasphemy is aware

that the bond was

not properly formed,

but this does not

interrupt the rit-

ual.  Fiends  often

allow  mortals  to

believe their resis-

tance went unde-

tected until after the

ritual is complete.

Locate  Cultist

(Su): One effect of

the blood oath is a

sort  of  telepathic

bond  between  the

fiend  of  blasphemy

and its cultists. At will,

a fiend of blasphemy can

use a supernatural power identical

to locate creature to sense the location of any creature that

has sworn a blood oath with the fiend.

Undetectable Alignment (Su): A fiend of blasphemys

alignment is constantly concealed from all forms of divina-

tion, as the undetectable alignment spell.

Transfer Spell-Like Ability (Sp): At 2nd level, a fiend of

blasphemy can use a power similar to the cleric spell

imbue with spell ability to grant its cult members access to

its spell-like abilities. A fiend can give one creature that

has sworn it a blood oath access to as many of its own

spell-like abilities as it desires. The cultist can use the abil-

ity once per day, with all variable characteristics (includ-

ing caster level and save DC) determined as if the fiend

were using the ability.

When it transfers a spell-like abil-

ity, the fiend cannot use the

ability as often as usual: It

can use abilities normally

available  at  will  only  4

times per day, and loses

one  use  per  day  from

other abilities. A fiend

can  bestow  the  same

ability on multiple wor-

shipers, or allow wor-

shipers to use the abil-

ity  more  than  once

per day, but in doing

so  loses  more  of  its

own daily uses of the

ability.

For example, a gla-

brezu  fiend  of  blas-

phemy can grant two

of its cultists the abil-

ity to use dispel magic

once per day, or grant

a  single  cultist  the

ability to dispel magic

twice per day, but the

glabrezu  itself  can

only dispel magic three

times per day as long

as the cultists retain

their ability.

The  fiend  of  blas-

phemy can revoke the

transfer at any time as

a  free  action.  If  the

cultist had already used

the ability during the

current day, it counts as

if the fiend had used it

that day as well.

Sponsor Worshiper (Su): A

fiend of blasphemy that has reached at least 3rd level can

channel spellcasting ability from its own fiendish master to

mortals with levels in the cleric class. A fiend can sponsor a

cleric whose level is no higher than twice the fiends class

level. Thus, a 3rd-level fiend of blasphemy can sponsor a

cleric of up to 6th level, who receives access to the full com-

plement of cleric spells as well as any two domains selected

from those offered by the fiends master.

Scry on Cultist (Sp): At 4th level, a fiend of blasphemy can

scry on any creature that has sworn it a blood oath, as if

using the scrying spell. The fiend cannot scry on cultists on

other planes. The fiend can use this ability on any given

cultist once per day, but there is no limit to how many

cultists it can scry on in a day.

Torture Cultist (Su): At 4th level, a fiend of blasphemy

gains the ability to inflict pain on those who have sworn it

a blood oath. Distance is not a factor, but the fiend cannot

torture a cultist who is on a different plane. When the

fiend uses this power, the target cultist suffers excruciat-

ing pain. The affected creature takes a 4 penalty on attack

rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round per class

level of the fiend. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 +

fiends class level + fiends Cha modifier) lessens the

penalty to 2.

Mind Shielding (Su): At 5th level, a fiend of blasphemy

gains immunity to detect thoughts and discern lies spells.

Kill Cultist (Su): At 6th level, a fiend of blasphemy

gains the ability to kill those who have sworn it a blood

oath if they displease it. Distance is not a factor, but the

fiend cannot kill a cultist who is on a different plane. The

affected creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

fiends class level + fiends Cha modifier) or die. If the save

is successful, the creature takes 3d6+6 points of damage.

This is a death effect.

FIEND OF CORRUPTION

For a variety of reasonsto win more fodder for an unend-

ing Blood War, to gain currency in an infernal economy, or

to hold stakes in a cosmic conflict between good and evil

some fiends are preoccupied with corrupting mortals to

ensure that their souls end up on the Lower Planes after

death. These fiends delight in finding souls pure and

untouched by evil, and leading them astray until they are

utterly and irredeemably corrupt. What they cannot cor-

rupt, they nevertheless hope to claim by virtue of an invio-

lable bargain that the fiend can inevitably twist toward its

own purposes. Such fiends thrive in the fiend of corruption

prestige class.

As the name suggests, only fiends can enter the fiend of

corruption prestige class. Some can qualify without any levels

in other classes at all, while others gain levels in any charac-

ter class before joining the prestige class.

A fiend of corruption works best by establishing a one-

on-one relationship with an individual mortal, so it gener-

ally does its diabolical work independent of other fiends.

On rare occasions, succubus or erinyes fiends of corruption

have been known to work in pairs.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a fiend of corruption, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Outsider with the evil subtype.

Base Save Bonus: Will +7.

Skills: Bluff 10 ranks, Disguise 10 ranks, Sense

Motive 10 ranks.

Special: Must be able to use charm person or charm mon-

ster as a spell or spell-like ability.

CLASS SKILLS

The fiend of corruptions class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha),

Disguise (Cha), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Lis-

ten (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and

Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the fiend of corruption

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fiends of

corruption gain no proficiency with any

weapons, armor, or shields.

Alternate Form (Su): A fiend of

corruption  has  the  ability  to

assume any humanoid form

of Small to Large size as a

standard action. While using

this ability, the fiend gains a +10

circumstance bonus on Dis-

guise checks.

Fiends of corruption typi-

cally use this ability to make them-

selves appear pleasing or even

desirable to their intended targets.

It is hard, after all, to manipulate a

person who is running away,

howling in terror.

Fiends often use sexual temp-

tation as a tool for corruption, but

the seduction is simply a means to

the eventual end of the mortals

damnation, not an end in itself.

Once  drawn  into  an  intimate

relationship with a fiend (particu-

larly if this relationship is considered

illicit), mortals are more susceptible

to further temptations and blackmail.

a simple task. The next day, when the affected creature is

suffering from the penalty, the price for restoring the

favor gets slightly higher, and

so onuntil a power-hungry

character is willing to do just

about anything in return.

Suggestion (Sp): At 2nd level,

a fiend of corruption gains the

ability  to  use  suggestion three

times per day. The saving throw

DC is 15 + the fiends Charisma

modifier (as though the fiend

had Spell Focus [Enchantment]).

The fiend of corruptions class

level  is  its  caster  level.  If  the

target of this ability is currently

under  the  influence  of  a  charm

person cast by the fiend, she takes a

2 penalty on her saving throw.

A fiend of corruption is generally

interested in corrupting mortals and

seducing them toward evil. A mortal

who commits an evil act because of a

magical compulsion is not fully cor-

rupted, and the taint of evil can easily

be removed with an atonement spell.

Even  so,  using  this  power  can  be  a

useful first step toward the mortals ulti-

mate damnation. Once the deed is done,

the fiend has a stronger foothold for later

temptation or even blackmail.

AS

Fiends Favor (Su): Once per day, a fiend of cor-

ruption can grant a touched creature a +3 bonus to

one of the creatures ability scores. This bonus stacks with

any other bonus the creature may already have, and lasts for

one day. When the effect expires, the creature takes a 3

penalty to the same ability score for the next day. Another

application of fiends favor not only negates the penalty, but

restores the full bonus.

Fiends of corruption are quite free with this abilityat

least at first. They often approach people who are in need

of a short-term ability boost for a specific situation, offer-

ing them the favor for free or in exchange for performing

Fiend of corruption

Mind Shielding (Su): At 2nd level,

a fiend of blasphemy gains complete

immunity to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to

magically discern its alignment.

This ability solidifies a fiends disguise, cloaking its

thoughts as well as its flesh.

Mark of Justice (Sp): At 3rd level, a fiend of corruption

can use mark of justice once per day, though the ability

might better be termed mark of iniquity when used in

this manner.

A fiend of corruption uses this ability to cement a good

persons descent into evil. Once its victim is living an

immoral life, the fiend uses mark of justice to ensure that

the victim does not return to her old ways or seek atone-

ment. While good clerics typically place a mark of justice in

a visible place on the subject, fiends generally hide their

marks in locations that are not obvious.

Fiendish Graft (Su): Once per month, a fiend of corrup-

tion of 4th level or higher can bestow a

fiendish graft or symbiont (see Appendix 3)

on a willing mortal.

Fiendish grafts are offered as rewards to

characters who are already well along the path

of corruption.

Major Creation (Sp): A 4th-level fiend of cor-

ruption gains the ability to use major creation

three times per day. The fiend of corruptions

class level is its caster level.

Fiends of corruption use this ability to offer

concrete temptation to mortals whose tastes run

to material wealth and finery.

Geas (Sp): Also at 5th level, a fiend of corruption

can use geas/quest once per day.

As with suggestion, magical compulsion is not an ideal

way to accomplish the fiend of corruptions goals, but

works admirably as a step along the way.

Temptation (Su): At 5th level, a fiend of corruption

gains the ability to offer good creatures the opportunity

to change their alignment to evil. This works like the

redemption or temptation function of the atonement

spell, and the fiend can use this ability whenever the

opportunity arises.

Grant Wish (Sp): A 6th-level fiend of corruption can grant

a wish to a mortal (not an elemental, outsider, or nonliving

creature) once per day. Using this ability costs the fiend

experience points as if it were casting a wish spell, so fiends

never use this ability lightly.

A fiend of corruption typically uses this ability as part of a

soul bargain (see below), allowing it to grant its mortal

targets every desire in exchange for ownership of the

mortals soul.

Soul Bargain (Su): At 6th level, a fiend of corruption

gains the ability to enter a binding agreement with a mortal,

at the cost of the mortals soul. The mortal victim must enter

into the soul bargain willingly.

Upon the mortals death (by any means), her soul is trans-

ferred to a gem (prepared as with the soul bind spell when the

bargain is forged), even if the gem and the mortal are not on

the same plane at the time.

The bargain requires 1 hour to complete, and is utterly

inviolable once forged. The only way to escape a soul bar-

gain is to recover the gem after the mortals death and break

it, freeing her soul and allowing her to be restored to life

through the normal means.

It is quite common for fiends of corruption, as soon as a

soul bargain is complete, to return to their native plane and

await the mortals death, or at least deposit the gem in a safe

place before returning to the Material Plane to hasten the

victims demise.

FIEND OF POSSESSION

A fiend that rends with claws or smites with a blazing sword

is a fearsome foe indeed, but a fiend of possession is har-

rowing on a far deeper level. Able to abandon its physical

form and inhabit or even control a mortal body, a fiend of

possession is an invasive presence that taints the very

soul, corrupting from within.

As the name suggests, only fiends can enter the fiend

of possession prestige class. Some can qualify without

any levels in other classes at all, while others gain levels,

often as sorcerers or bards, before joining the prestige

class. Many fiend clerics approach the fiend of possession

prestige class as part of their spiritual agenda, viewing the

possession of mortals as something of a religious obliga-

tion. Fiends with fighter levels tend to prefer a more direct

approach to conflict on the Material Plane, and rarely show

interest in becoming fiends of possession.

Fiends of possession generally work alone. Some use their

power simply to wreak as much chaos and destruction as they

can, experiencing the carnage and debauchery much more

intensely because of the nature of mortal flesh. Others use their

mortal hosts as part of a much more insidious plot of corrup-

tion. In any case, their victims never feel clean or safe again.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a fiend of possession, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any outsider with the Evil subtype.

Base Save Bonuses: Will +5.

Skills: Hide 6 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks

CLASS SKILLS

The fiend of possessions class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha),

Hide (Dex or Int; see below), Listen (Wis), Search (Int),

Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the fiend of possession

prestige class. Saving throws against a fiend of possessions

supernatural abilities have a DC of 10 + the fiend of posses-

sions class level + its Charisma modifier, unless noted other-

wise in the ability description.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fiends of possession

gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Ethereal Form (Su): At will, a fiend of possession can

become ethereal, as though using etherealness as cast by a

sorcerer of the fiends total Hit Dice or its sorcerer caster

level (when using its spell-like abilities) plus its fiend of

possession level, whichever is higher. Possessing an object

or creature effectively ends a use of this ability, so time

spent in another body or object does not count against the

duration of this ability.

Fiend of possession

Hide Presence (Ex): A fiend in possession of an object

or creature can attempt to hide its presence by making a

special Hide check. This mental Hide check uses the

fiends Intelligence modifier instead of its Dexterity modi-

fier. A successful check allows a fiend of possession to

avoid virtually anything that would betray

its presence in the possessed creature

or object: it can pass through a magic

circle  against  evil, enter  a  temple

warded  by  forbiddance, or  escape

detection via detect evil. The DC for

this Hide check is the same as the

saving throw DC for the spell the

fiend  is  trying  to  avoid. The

fiend gains a +4 circum-

stance  bonus  on  this

check if it is not con-

trolling the possessed

creature or object at

the time of the check.

When possessing a

creature, a fiend of pos-

session can make this

Hide check to protect

the  possessed  crea-

ture from the full ef-

fects of alignment-

based spells such

as holy smite. If the

fiend makes a suc-

cessful Hide check

(against  the  save

DC of the spell), the

possessed  creature

takes damage appro-

priate  to  its  actual  align-

ment, but if the fiend fails the Hide check, the possessed

creature is affected as if it were the fiend.

Making this check is not an action; the fiend can do it

in response to another creatures action (such as casting

detect evil).

Possess Object (Su): A fiend of possession in ethereal

form can possess an object on the Material Plane. The object

must be at least Tiny and no larger than Huge. Magic items

and attended items receive Will saving throws. Unattended

nonmagical items are automatically possessed.

A fiend of possession becomes part of the object it pos-

sesses, so it is no longer ethereal. The fiend is aware of

what is going on around the object: It can see and hear up

to 60 feet away as if using its normal senses (it does not

gain blindsight). In any round in which

it  takes  no  other  action  (such  as

using  a  spell-like  ability),  it

extends its senses to twice its

normal range (120 feet).

The fiend is vulnerable to

spells that specifically affect

outsiders or creatures of

the fiends alignment (such

as holy word and holy smite,

as well as chaos hammer or

order s  wrath)  and  mind-

affecting spells or effects,

but  it  is  unaffected  by

physical  attacks  or

standard magical ef-

fects  (such  as  fire-

ball). Harming the

object does not harm

the fiend, although if the

object is destroyed, the

fiend  is  forced  back

into its ethereal form.

While possessing an

object, a fiend of posses-

sion can use any ability it

has that requires no physical

action, such as using a spell-

like ability or telepathy. It

cannot cast spells (since it

can neither speak nor move),

attack physically, or perform any other

physical action, until it reaches a high enough level to

make the possessed object perform these tasks for it.

Curse (Su): At 2nd level, a fiend of possession gains

the ability to make a possessed item radiate a corrupt and

befouling nature. Anyone touching the object must

make a Will save or fall under the effect of a bestow curse

spell. The affected creature does not know that the curse

came from the item, and in fact might not know right

away that he or she is affected by the curse. Nothing about

the objects appearance suggests that it is possessed. The

A

P

P

E

D

X

205

curse lasts until it is removed, even if the fiend vacates the

object it possessed.

Magic Item (Su): Also at 2nd level, a fiend of posses-

sion gains the ability to make a possessed weapon or

armor function as a magic item. The fiend can bestow

powers on the item with a value as an enhancement bonus

of up to its class level, so a 3rd-level fiend of possession

could make a sword a +3 weapon, a +2 keen weapon, or a +1

wounding weapon, for example. If the possessed item is

already magical, the fiend can increase the powers on the

item by the same amountso a 5th-level fiend of posses-

sion could turn a +1 sword into a +1 vorpal

sword, for example. When a fiend

uses  this  power  on  a  nonmagical

item, the possessed item does not actually

become magical. Detect magic does not

reveal an aura on the item, though

detect evil does.

If a fiend possessing an item attempts to possess

a creature that uses the item or keeps it on its

person, the targets save DC increases by 1 for

each day the possessed item has been on its

person or in its use, to a maximum of +10.

A character who makes a Search check

(DC 25) while examining the possessed

item can tell that there is something

strange about it.

Control Object (Su): When pos-

sessing an object with some inherent mobility, a fiend of

possession of at least 3rd level can control the objects

movement. The fiend can cause a vehicle or similar

object to move at a speed up to the fiends own land

speed in its corporeal form. Other moving partssuch

as a clocks hands or a crossbows firing mechanismare

under the fiends control. Thus, a fiend could make a

wagon steer toward a pedestrian, or roll out of a stable

without a horse to pull it. It could make a crossbow cock

and fire (but not aim or load itself ). Exerting control is

itself a free action, though actually moving an object

requires a move action.

Animate Object (Su): At 4th level, a fiend of possession

gains the ability to force an object with no inherent moving

parts to animate, effectively animating it as with the ani-

mate objects spell. See the description of animated objects in

the Monster Manual. At this level, a fiend of possession can

also possess (and animate) Gargantuan objects.

Possess Creature (Su): At 4th level, a fiend of posses-

sion  gains  the  ability  to  possess  creatures  as  well  as

objects. The fiend must be in ethereal form and adjacent

to its target, and must use a standard action to attempt pos-

session. A protection from evil spell or similar magic wards a

creature against being possessed in this manner. An

unprotected target must make a Will saving throw. Evil

creatures take a 2 penalty on this saving throw, as do

creatures that are engaged in an evil act at the time the

possession attempt occurs (at the DMs discretion). If the

saving throw is successful, that creature is immune to that

fiends possession attempts for one day. If the saving

throw is failed, the creature is possessed, though it is not

necessarily aware of this fact.

A fiend possessing a creature becomes a part of the victim,

so it is no longer ethereal. It cannot be targeted by spells or

attacks separately from the victim, including attacks from

ethereal creatures. Damage taken by the possessed creature

has no effect on the fiend. If the

victim dies, the fiend is forced

back into its ethereal form.

The fiend can sense anything

the victim can, even including

the  benefits  of  blindsight  or

other exceptional senses the victim

may have. At any time, the fiend of

possession can communicate with

the victim telepathically, pro-

jecting words in any language the

victim understands directly into the victims

thoughts. The fiend is constantly aware of the

victims current thoughts. It can also choose to

probe the creatures memories as well, but

the victim is allowed a Will save. If

this saving throw is successful, the

fiend cannot probe that creatures

thoughts for one day.

Ally or Enemy (Su): At 5th level, a fiend of possession

gains the ability to reward or punish a creature it is pos-

sessing. If the possessed creature is aware of the fiends

presence and willing to host the fiend, the fiend can

bestow a +4 profane bonus on any of the creatures ability

scores. This bonus lasts as long as the fiend wants it to: The

fiend can retract it as a free action at any time, particularly

if the possessed creature starts acting contrary to the

fiends wishes.

Similarly, a fiend of possession can bestow a 4 profane

penalty on any of the possessed creatures ability scores,

usually when attempts to control the creature have failed

or the creature contradicts the fiends wishes. As with the

bonus, the fiend can remove this penalty at any time, as a

free action.

Bestowing either a bonus or a penalty is a free action for

the possessing fiend.

Possess Noncontinuous Object (Su): At 5th level, a

fiend of possession can use its possess object ability to

take control of an object more loosely defined: a pool of

water, a cloud of dust, or a section of wall or floor. At this

level, a fiend of possession can also possess (and animate)

Colossal objects.

Control Creature (Su): At 6th level, a fiend of posses-

sion gains the ability to exert direct control over a creature

it is possessing. Attempting to establish control is a stan-

dard action for the fiend. The victim must make a Will

1

D

P

A

206

saving throw each round until the fiend abandons the

attempt, or the victim fails a saving throw and the fiend

gains control, or the victim makes three consecutive suc-

cessful saves, indicating that the fiend cannot control the

victim that day (though it remains in possession of the

victim). Each round of struggle, the victim can take only a

single move or attack action. Once the fiend gains control,

it automatically maintains it for a number of rounds equal

to its class level (6) + its Charisma modifier, + 1 for each

previous occasion on which it has controlled this host.

When this time elapses, the fiend can attempt to reassert

control or not, as it chooses.

While in control of a victim, the fiend of possession has

access to all the creatures abilities, skills, feats, and spell

knowledge. The fiend now acts as though it is the creature

in all respects, until it loses or relinquishes control. The

fiend uses its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

scores, but adopts all of the possessed creatures physical

ability scores. It can make use of its own spell-like abilities

as  well. The  fiend  retains  the  creatures  type,  and  is

affected by spells and other effects as if it were the pos-

sessed creature except in regard to its alignment. For

instance, a cornugon possessing the body of a wolf is sub-

ject to spells that affect animals, even though it is far more

intelligent than a normal wolf. A balor possessing the

body of a paladin is not subject to unholy blight, however,

but is fully affected by holy smite.

The fiend can choose whether the possessed creature

retains awareness of its bodys senses and actions, in which

case it can mentally communicate with the fiend, or simply

blacks out for the duration of the control.

Faith) can force a fiend of possession out of a victim and

back into its ethereal form.

APPENDIX 2: GRAFTS

AND SYMBIONTS

Grafts and symbionts are not complete monsters in them-

selves. Rather, they are monstrous body parts or even sen-

tient beings (in the case of symbionts) that merge with

existing creatures to enhance them. Grafts are nonsentient

body partsarms, legs, wings, and the likewhile sym-

bionts have minds of their own and attach to their hosts in

a variety of ways.

GRAFTS

Grafts have no statistics of their own. A graft might enhance

some ability or characteristic of the creature its attached to,

or grant the creature some new ability. For example, a

fiendish arm might grant the creature longer reach or an

improved natural attack. Some grafts are capable of inde-

pendent actionthis usually means that the creature with

the graft gains an extra single move or attack action each

round, usually of a specific kind (a natural attack with a

fiendish clawed arm, for example).

Grafts are not magic items, but in game terms they func-

tion very much like magic items. A character with the Graft

Flesh feat (see the sidebar) can create and apply grafts. The

creator must be in a quiet and comfortable setting, usually

an alchemical laboratory but in some cases an evil temple or

similar locale. He needs a supply of materials, which usually

involve flesh taken from another creature of the appropriate

type. The cost for the materials is subsumed in the cost for

creating the graft. Creating a graft costs half the given

market price.

Ending Possession: Spells such as dismissal and banish-

ment are among the only effects that can target a fiend of

possession separately from the object or creature it inhab-

its. When these spells are directed against a fiend of posses-

sion, the spell effect is resolved as if the fiend were in its

normal, corporeal form, using its own Hit Dice, saving

throws, ability scores, and so on. If successful, these spells

drive the fiend out of the victim and back to its home plane.

Holy word and similar spells can also drive out a possessing

fiend and send it back to its home plane, but a fiend can

hide its presence to escape the effects of such spells. Cer-

tain other special abilities (such as the granted power of the

Exorcism prestige domain described in Defenders of the

If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the

graft, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast,

must know the spells (in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or

must have access to spell-like abilities that duplicate the

spells. The creator need not provide any material compo-

nents or focuses the spells require, nor are any XP costs

inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation of

the graft. The act of working on the graft expends the spells

from the creators currently prepared spells, just as if they

had been cast.

A graft is not a magic item: It does not radiate magic once

completed, it does not count against a creatures limit for

magic items worn, it does not have a caster level, and it is

very hard, if not impossible, to salvage as treasure. It does,

however, count against the treasure value of the creature

with the graft, which means that creatures with grafts are

still appropriate challenges for their normal Challenge

Rating, but have reduced treasure.

ABOLETH GRAFTS

Creations of the vile aboleths, these are extra body

parts that can be attached to the body of another

corporeal creature.

Acquiring an Aboleth Graft

Aboleths frequently apply these grafts

to skum or other enslaved crea-

tures. The process involves psi-

onic transformation of the sub-

ject,  which  few  aboleths  know

how to perform. In general, abo-

leth grafts can be added only to

skum  or  to  creatures  that  have

already undergone transforma-

tion as a result of being hit by

an aboleths tentacles.

If a transformed crea-

ture with aboleth grafts

later receives a heal spell

to reverse the transfor-

mation, the grafts dry up and

wither over the course of 1d4+1 days,

falling off at the end of this period. If the

graft replaced one of the creatures own limbs or other

organs, a regenerate spell is required to restore the original

body part.

Aboleth Tentacle: An aboleth tentacle typically replaces

an arm or forelimb on the grafted creature, though some-

times it is attached just above a forelimb or below an arm.

The creature gains a +4 bonus to Strength when using the

tentacle for any purpose, including attacking. A successful

natural  attack  with  the  tentacle  deals  1d6  points  of

damage plus the grafted creatures adjusted Strength

bonus, and can cause the struck creature to transform.

Affected creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10

+ 1/2 grafted creatures HD + grafted creatures Con modi-

fier) or begin to transform as if struck by an aboleths ten-

tacle (see the Monster Manual).

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, creator must be an aboleth; Market

Price: 50,000 gp.

Mucus Sheath: A mucus sheath actually involves

extensive skin grafts, resulting in the subject being con-

stantly coated in a thin layer of mucus. This sheath adds 10

208

feet to the creatures swim speed and gives it a +10 circum-

stance bonus on Escape Artist checks. It also serves as a

focus for certain psionic abilities to better affect the sub-

ject: The grafted creature takes a 4 penalty on Will saves

against mind-affecting effects. The mucus also doubles

the range at which an aboleth can effectively control a

slave, to 2 miles.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, creator must be an aboleth; Market

Price: 5,000 gp.

Skum Eyes: Skum eyes are bulbous and fishlike. This

graft cannot be added to skum, since they already have its

abilities. The grafted creature gains a +2

racial bonus on Spot checks, increasing

to +4 while it is underwater.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, creator

must be an aboleth; Market Price:

600 gp.

Skum Tail: This graft can-

not be added to skum, since

they already have an identi-

cal appendage. A skum tail

is slender and muscular, and

it gives the creature a natu-

ral swim speed of 40 feet.

Like  any  creature  with  a

natural  swim  speed,  the

grafted  creature  need  not

make Swim checks to move at

its swim speed underwater, and gains a +8 racial bonus

on Swim checks made to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. The grafted creature can always choose to

take 10 on a Swim check, even if rushed or threatened

when swimming, and can use the run action while swim-

ming, if it swims in a straight line.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, creator must be an aboleth; Market

Price: 6,000 gp.

BEHOLDER GRAFTS

To a beholder, every kind of creatureincluding other

beholders who vary even slightly from itselfis an abom-

ination fit only to be destroyed. Any attempt to transfer the

perfection of the beholder form to another creature is

abhorrent to beholdersand that is exactly what beholder

grafts are. These are created and implanted by deranged

cultists who worship beholders (usually human but some-

times goblinoid) in an attempt to become more like the

creatures they idolize.

Acquiring a Beholder Graft

Beholder grafts are created by bizarre beholder cults, and

are generally applied only to their members. These cults

are usually made up of subterranean creatures such as

kobolds, troglodytes, or derro.

Crown of Eyes: A crown of eyes consists of six small eyes

that are set into a creatures skull all around its circumference.

Their vision is poor (half normal range), but they have dark-

vision with a range of 60 feet and confer all-around vision

on the grafted creature. This gives the grafted creature a +4

racial bonus on Search and Spot checks and pre-

vents it from being flanked.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh; Market Price: 60,000 gp.

Eye Stalk: An eye stalk is grafted onto a

creatures head and connected to its

nervous system. The creature can

use it to produce an eye ray as a

standard action three times

per day; the effect exactly

duplicates  one  of  a  be-

holders smaller eye rays.

An individual eye stalk

can produce only one

kind of ray. The grafted

creature uses its own

attack bonus to deter-

mine whether the ray hits

its target, but the effects save DC is always 18. The

ray has a range of 150 feet.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh plus one of the follow-

ing spells: charm monster, charm person, disinte-

grate, fear, finger of death, flesh to stone, inflict moder-

ate  wounds,  sleep,  slow,  or telekinesis; Market  Price:

195,000 gp.

Gazing Eye: This graft replaces one of the crea-

tures own eyes and gives it a gaze attack. This attack

can charm monster, cause sleep, petrify, or cause fear. It

has a range of 30 feet and a save DC of 16 (including a +2

bonus because only one of the grafted creatures eyes can

make the attack), but otherwise functions like a beholders

eye rays.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh plus one of the following spells:

cause fear, charm monster, flesh to stone, or sleep; Market Price:

195,000 gp.

Plated Skin: A plated skin graft covers the creatures

vulnerable body parts with bony plates like those that pro-

tect  a  beholder.  The  creatures  natural  armor  bonus

increases by +4.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, barkskin; Market Price: 64,000 gp.

Replacement Eye: A replacement eye is grafted into the

creatures skull in place of one of its own eyes. The grafted

creature can use it to produce an eye ray as a standard

action three times per day; the effect exactly duplicates

one of a beholders smaller eye rays. An individual replace-

ment eye can produce only one kind of ray. The grafted

creature uses its own attack bonus to determine whether

the ray hits its target, but the save DC is always 18. The ray

has a range of 50 feet.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh plus one of the following spells:

charm monster, charm person, disintegrate, fear, finger of death,

flesh to stone, inflict moderate wounds, sleep, slow, or telekinesis;

Market Price: 195,000 gp.

Third Eye: Implanted in the forehead above the crea-

tures normal eyes, a third eye duplicates the effects of a

beholders large central eye, producing an antimagic cone

similar to an antimagic field cast by a 13th-level sorcerer.

This small eye only affects a 50-foot

cone, however. It functions

three times per day.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh,

antimagic  field; Market  Price:

165,000 gp.

FIENDISH GRAFTS

Fiendish grafts are body parts of a fiendish nature

that can be attached to the body of another

corporeal creature.

Acquiring a Fiendish Graft

There are a number of ways to ac-

quire a fiendish graft. Certain magical

devices  have  been  discovered  that

enfold a creature, remove one of its limbs,

dealing 6d6 points of damage, and replace the limb

with a fiendish graft (or sometimes a fiendish

familiar; see Fiendish Symbionts, below), restor-

ing 5d6 points of damage in the process.

Certain prestige classes also entail the addi-

tion of a fiendish graft to a character. The acolyte

of the skin (detailed in Tome and Blood) gains a

fiendish skin at 1st level, and with increasing

levels becomes more closely attuned

to the graft. Other prestige classes are

likely to exist that bestow different

kinds of fiendish grafts.

Even when a character gains a fiendish

graft as a prestige class benefit, however, a fiendish entity

typically bestows the graft at the climax of a dark ritual.

Characters without such specific prestige classes can per-

form similar rituals in order to gain the benefits of a

fiendish graft. Such a ritual requires 10 rounds and deals

1d4 points of damage to the character per round.

Finally, demons or devils with at least four levels in the

fiend of corruption prestige class (see Appendix 1) may

grant fiendish grafts as a special ability. They grant these

gifts as rewards to characters who are progressing well

along the path of corruption, often in exchange for the

mortal creatures soul.

Drawbacks of Fiendish Grafts

Creatures of good alignment with a fiendish graft must

make a successful Will save (DC 15) every day or take 1d3

points of Wisdom damage as the experience drives them

slowly mad.

Creatures of a nonevil alignment must make a Will save

(DC 15) each day or succumb to temptation to perform an

evil act. This may result in an alignment change, eventually.

When characters with fiendish grafts interact with

nonevil NPCs, a 6 circumstance penalty is applied on all

Charisma-based checks (Diplomacy, Bluff, and so on).

This penalty applies even if the NPC is unaware of the

grafts presence, since it reflects the subtle twisting of

the hosts personality.

Charming Eye: This eye has a golden iris and an hour-

glass-shaped pupil like a goats. The grafted creature gains

the ability to see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even

magical darkness. In addition, the grafted creature gains a

charming  gaze  attack.  Anyone  within  30  feet  of  the

grafted creature that meets its eyes must make a Will

saving throw (DC 14) or be charmed for one day per total

Hit Dice of the grafted creature.

The save DC against this effect

reflects a +2 bonus because only

one of the grafted creatures eyes

can make the attack. The grafted

creature is immune to its own

gaze attack.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, charm

monster, true seeing, creator must be

a fiend; Market Price: 120,000 gp.

Clawed Arm: A clawed arm is

muscular  and  sinewy,  with  a

large, clawed hand. The grafted

creature  gains  a  +4  bonus  to

Strength when using the arm for

any purpose, including attacking.

If it is not holding anything or

being used to perform another

action, the grafted creature can

direct the clawed arm to make

one  natural  attack  per  round,

using the creatures base attack

bonus and adjusted Strength

modifier.  This  attack  is  in

addition to the creatures nor-

mal actions in a round. A suc-

cessful attack deals damage

based on the creatures size (see

Table A21) plus the creatures adjusted Strength bonus.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, bulls strength, haste, creator must

be a fiend; Market Price: 50,000 gp.

Fast Leg: Long and agile, a fast leg increases the creatures

speed by 10 feet when not wearing heavy armor or carrying

a heavy load. Further, the creature gains a +5 competence

bonus on Climb and Jump checks.

its eyes must make a Will saving throw (DC 14) or be para-

lyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. The save DC against this

effect reflects a +2 bonus because only one of the grafted

creatures eyes can make the attack. The grafted creature is

immune to its own gaze attack.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, fear, see invisibility, creator must be

a fiend; Market Price: 120,000 gp.

Feathered Wings: Feathered wings resemble those of a

vrock or erinyes: large and birdlike, though often bearing

claws at the top joint. The grafted creature can fly at a

speed equal to twice its normal land speed, with average

maneuverability. When not flying, the grafted creature can

use the wings to buffet and disorient its opponents. Each

round, in addition to its normal

attacks, it can make a Bluff check

(opposed by its opponents Sense

Motive check). If this check is

successful, the grafted creatures

attacks in that round gain a +2 cir-

cumstance bonus.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, fly, cre-

ator must be a fiend; Market Price:

10,000 gp.

Fiendish Ear: A fiendish ear

is  large  and  fan-shaped,  with

sharp spikes connected by thick

membranous skin. A creature

with a fiendish ear receives a +4

racial bonus on Listen checks and

gains the benefit of the Blind-

Fight feat.

Any time the grafted creature

rolls a natural 1 on a Listen check,

the ear transmits sound from the

Windswept Depths of Pandemo-

nium. The grafted creature is deaf-

ened for 1d4+1 rounds and suffers

the effects of a confusion spell for

the same duration. While deaf-

ened, it loses the benefit of the Blind-Fight feat.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a fiend;

Market Price: 2,500 gp.

Fiendish Jaw: This is a large, heavy jawbone covered in

thick, scaly skin. Two large tusks protrude from a row of

sharp, crooked teeth. These tusks allow the grafted creature

to make a gore natural attack, dealing damage based on the

grafted creatures size (see Table A21).

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a fiend; Market

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, expeditious retreat, jump, creator

Fearsome Eye: This eye is bright red in color and has a

uously see invisibility as the spell from a 20th-level caster.

In addition, the grafted creature gains a fear gaze attack.

Anyone within 30 feet of the grafted creature that meets

Fiendish Skin: Fiendish skin improves the grafted crea-

tures natural armor bonus by +1 and grants it a +2 inherent

bonus to Dexterity. In addition, the grafted creature gains

darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Once per day, the grafted

creature can use poison as the spell from a 16th-level caster

(Fort save DC 18 + grafted creatures Cha modifier).

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, barkskin, cats grace, poison, creator

Flexible Arm: A flexible arm is long and flexible like a

tentacle, with a crude, three-fingered claw at the end. If it is

not holding anything or being used to perform another

action, the grafted creature can direct the arm to make one

natural attack per round, using the grafted creatures base

attack bonus and Strength modifier. This attack is in addi-

tion to the grafted creatures normal actions in a round. A

successful attack deals damage based on the grafted crea-

tures size (see Table A21) plus its Strength bonus.

If the grafted creature uses the flexible arm to wield a

weapon, all attacks with that weapon take a 2 penalty. Once

per day, as a standard action, the grafted creature can direct

the arm to cast magic missile as a 5th-level caster.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, haste, magic missile, creator must

be a fiend; Market Price: 27,000 gp.

Grappling Tentacle: A grappling tentacle strongly

resembles a flexible armit is a long tentacle with barbed

hooks instead of fingers or claws at the end. It cannot use

a weapon effectively, though it can perform gross manipu-

lation such as pulling a large lever or lifting a portcullis.

The grafted creature gains a +4 bonus to Strength when

using the tentacle for any purpose. When the grafted crea-

ture grapples, it uses its adjusted Strength score (with the

tentacles bonus) and gains an additional +4 bonus on its

grapple checks made to hold, pin, or damage an opponent.

It does not gain this special bonus when trying to break

free of a grapple.

The grappling tentacle can be used to make natural

attacks, dealing damage based on the grafted creatures size

(see Table A21) plus its adjusted Strength bonus. It does

not confer the benefits of the improved grab special attack.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, bulls strength, creator must be a

fiend; Market Price: 20,000 gp.

Long Arm: A long arm is thin and wiry, and unusually

long for the grafted creatures size. The grafted creatures

natural reach for attacks made with the arm or weapons

held in the arm increases by 5 feet. Though it cannot take

independent action, the arm can be used to make natural

attacks, dealing damage based on the grafted creatures size

(see Table A21).

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a fiend; Market

Price: 5,000 gp.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, fly, protection from energy, creator

must be a fiend; Market Price: 50,000 gp.

Springing Leg: This extremely long leg is bent, either

forward (like a frogs) or backward (like a grasshoppers).

The creature gains a +30 competence bonus on Jump

checks. The creatures normal land speed is reduced by

10 feet, however, because of the discrepancy between its

two legs.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, jump, creator must be a fiend;

Market Price: 35,000 gp.

Sting Tail: A sting tail is long and thick, with a seg-

mented, chitinous appearance and a stinger like that of a

scorpion at the end. The grafted creature can direct the

sting tail to make one natural attack per round, using the

grafted creatures base attack bonus and Strength modi-

fier. This attack is in addition to the grafted creatures

normal actions in a round. A successful attack deals 2d4

points of damage (regardless of the grafted creatures size)

plus the grafted creatures Strength bonus. In addition, the

stinging tail delivers a poison (Fort DC 14 negates) with

each successful attack. Initial and secondary damage are

the same (1d6 Str).

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, haste, poison, creator must be a

fiend; Market Price: 50,000 gp.

Strong Leg: A strong leg is thick and muscular. A crea-

ture with this leg gains a +2 inherent bonus to its Constitu-

tion score.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, endurance, creator must be a

fiend; Market Price: 8,000 gp.

Trampling Leg: A trampling leg is short and thick,

ending in a stumplike foot similar to an elephants. As a

standard action during its turn each round, the grafted

creature can move up to its speed and literally run over

opponents at least one size category smaller than itself.

This attack deals bludgeoning damage based on the grafted

creatures size (see Table A21). A trampled opponent can

attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a

Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the grafted creatures HD + grafted

creatures Str modifier) for half damage.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, bulls strength, baleful polymorph,

creator must be a fiend; Market Price: 5,000 gp.

Whip Tail: A whip tail is long and thin, and lashes

around behind the grafted creature as if of its own volition.

As a full-round action, the grafted creature can direct the

tail to attack one creature within a radius equal to the crea-

tures natural reach plus 10 feet. The tail uses the grafted

creatures base attack and size modifier and adds a Strength

modifier of +2, dealing 1d6+3 points of damage on a suc-

cessful hit (regardless of the grafted creatures size and

Strength). Wounds from the whip tail burn fiercely, causing

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

ILLITHID GRAFTS

Price: 8,000 gp.

Some say that the mind flayers were the first creatures to

experiment with grafts and develop the techniques of

attaching flesh from one creature to another. Others say

fiends hold that dubious honor, and a fiend of corruption

taught the process to an illithid. Whatever the case, it is

undeniably true that many experienced illithids have mas-

tered the Graft Flesh feat and used it to bestow a wide vari-

ety  of  grafts  upon  their

thralls. These grafts often

make the thralls more useful

in combat against the mind

flayers enemies, but they

also weaken the thralls will.

A creature with an illithid graft of

any kind takes a 4 penalty on Will

saves against mind-affecting spells,

psionic powers, and effects.

Acquiring an Illithid Graft

Mind flayers commonly add

grafts to their thralls. An il-

lithid needs only the Graft

Flesh feat to bestow these grafts, so

horribly transformed thralls are quite

common in illithid settlements.

The process of creating a ceremorph (see the half-illithid

template, earlier in this book) is a much more radical trans-

formation of the host creature than an illithid graft.

Antennae Graft: A pair of long antennae sprout from

the grafted creatures head, and hundreds of inch-long

hairs are embedded into its shoulders and arms. The com-

bined effect of these complex sensory organs is to give

the grafted creature tremorsense, allowing it to sense the

location of anything within 60 feet that is in contact with

the ground.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

Price: 20,000 gp.

Climbing Legs: Climbing legs jut out from the creatures

body. Each has a knee that bends to the creatures side, and

ends in a splayed foot with large, sticky pads on the four

toes. The overall effect strongly resembles the legs and feet

of a gecko. The creature can walk up walls and even upside

down on ceilings at a speed of 15 feet, as if wearing slippers of

spider climbing.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

Price: 4,000 gp.

Goring Horn: This graft alters the entire facial structure

of the creature, lengthening its face into a bestial muzzle

and attaching a long, sharp horn. The grafted creature can

Grasping Mandibles: These are a huge pair of chiti-

nous mandibles strongly resembling those of an umber

hulk, grafted onto either side of the creatures mouth (with

accompanying enlargement of the jaw and its muscles).

The grafted creature deals slashing damage with its bite

attack based on the grafted creatures size (see Table

A22). If the grafted creature hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself

with its bite attack, it deals normal damage

and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack

of  opportunity.  Each  successful

grapple check it makes during suc-

cessive rounds automatically deals

bite damage.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh,

creator must be an illithid;

Market Price: 15,000 gp.

Hauling  Back: This  graft

contorts and strengthens the crea-

tures spine and back muscles, while

forcing it to stoop low enough to use its

hands while walking. A hauling back

applied to a bipedal creature turns it into

a quadruped for the purposes of deter-

mining carrying capacity. Illithids

typically apply this graft to Large or

larger creatures, since the benefit is

minimal for Medium-size creatures

and  nonexistent  for  smaller  ones.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

Price: 2,000 gp.

Raking Tentacle: This is a long, flexible tentacle with

sharp, bony protrusions at the end. It replaces an arm or

forelimb, allowing the grafted creature to make a natural

attack with the raking tentacle. The tentacle deals slashing

damage based on the grafted creatures size (see Table

A22). It extends the grafted creatures natural reach by 5

feet but cannot be used to wield a weapon or perform any

fine manipulation. The grafted creature takes a 2 penalty

on all skill checks requiring the use of hands.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid;

Market Price: 5,000 gp.

Rending Claw: A rending claw is actually an entire

armoverlong for the grafted creatures height (typically

reaching all the way to the floor) and powerfully muscled.

The hand boasts long, sharp claws resembling knife blades.

The grafted creature can make a natural attack with the

rending claw, dealing slashing damage based on the grafted

creatures size (see Table A22). The rending claw deals 3

damage on a critical hit. The grafted creature takes a 4

penalty on skill checks that require precision or fine manip-

ulation with the rending claw.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

Price: 5,000 gp.

Weapon Graft: While most grafts are living tissue

attached to another living body, a weapon graft is exactly

what the name suggests: a normal, masterwork, or magic

melee weapon grafted onto the hand of a thrall so it is never

unarmed. The weapon actually becomes a natural weapon,

though its other properties are unchanged. The grafted

creature receives a +1 bonus on all attack and damage rolls

with the weapon, as long as it is proficient with the weapon.

However, it cannot use the hand with the graft for anything

but combat, and it takes a 2 penalty on all skill checks

requiring the use of hands.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be an illithid; Market

Price: weapon price + 1,000 gp.

MAUG GRAFTS

Maug spellcasters apply special grafts onto maugs when they

create more of their race on the plane of Acheron. All maug

grafts are construct grafts, usually made from the stone of

Thuldanin, the second layer of Acheron. Only maugs under-

stand the secrets of their creation, but spellcasting maugs

often transform their followers with such grafts.

Locking Hand: This stone hand is designed so that its

fingers can clasp and lock together. It replaces a creatures

normal hand. When used to make unarmed attacks, it deals

normal damage unless the attacker chooses to take a 4

penalty to deal subdual damage. A locking hand does not

change the amount of damage a creature deals with its

unarmed or natural attacks.

The main purpose of a locking hand is to strengthen a

creatures grip, making it more difficult to disarm the crea-

ture or dislodge an item from its grasp. The grafted creature

gets a +5 bonus on any roll to avoid being disarmed, to

oppose attempts to escape a grapple, to catch itself while

falling, and to hold onto a surface when damaged while

climbing. A creature with more than one locking hand

stacks the bonuses of each hand involved in the activity.

Locking hands can be locked and unlocked as easily as a

creature can make a fist; they do not inhibit spellcasting or

skill use. The bonus from a locking hand stacks with that

provided by a locked gauntlet.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, bulls strength, creator must be a

maug; Market Price: 2,000 gp.

Rollers: Six great stone cylinders beneath a pyramid of

rock, rollers replace the creatures legs and feet. Rollers

add 20 feet to the grafted creatures land speed and give it

the ability to trample foes, but the grafted creature takes a

8 penalty on Climb, Ride, and Swim skill checks. The

grafted creature cannot run.

As a standard action during its turn each round, the

grafted creature can move up to its speed and run over oppo-

nents at least one size category smaller than itself. This

attack deals bludgeoning damage based on the creatures

size (see Table A23). A trampled opponent can attempt

either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty or a Reflex

save (DC 10 + 1/2 grafted creatures HD + grafted creatures

Str modifier) for half damage.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, expeditious retreat, baleful polymorph,

creator must be a maug; Market Price: 10,000 gp.

Shoving Arm: A shoving arm is a pistonlike stone

appendage that ends in an upright, flattened stone hand. It

is attached a creatures torso along with a stone belt to

secure it in place. The arm is useless for most activities, but

once per round as an attack action it can be used to make a

special shoving attack against any opponent within 5 feet of

the grafted creature. The grafted creature makes a melee

touch attack that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

If it hits with its shoving arm, it and the struck opponent

make opposed Strength checks as though the grafted crea-

ture had made a bull rush attack. In addition to the normal

bonuses, the grafted creature adds a special +5 bonus on this

roll. If the grafted creature wins, the defender is pushed

back 5 feet plus an additional 1 foot per point by which the

grafted creature exceeded the defenders result. The grafted

creature does not move with the shoved defender.

For purposes of shoving unattended objects, the shoving

arm has a Strength equal to 10 + the Strength of the grafted

creature. The shoving arm can push creatures and objects in

straight lines only.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, bulls strength, creator must be a

maug; Market Price: 2,000 gp.

Shudder Plate: Usually placed in the chest of a crea-

ture, a shudder plate looks like a thin square of shale set in

213

a stone frame. Specially designed and enhanced, a shudder

plate quietly shakes and vibrates in its case, giving the

grafted creature a supernatural understanding of the area

surrounding it. If the grafted creature is in contact with

the ground, it can sense the location of anything within

15 feet that is also in contact with the ground. In addition,

the grafted creature takes a 4 penalty on Move

Silently skill checks.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, see invisibility, creator

must be a maug; Market Price: 8,000 gp.

Spike Stones: These small round stones are

inserted into the surface of the flesh of a crea-

ture, all over its body. The grafted creature can

cause them to grow as a standard action that does

not provoke an attack of opportunity. The stones

suddenly lengthen into sharp spikes, capable of

piecing flesh and armor alike. In a grapple, the

spikes deal 2d4 points of piercing damage in addi-

tion to normal grapple damage when the grafted

creature  makes  a  successful  grapple  check.  A

grafted creature can also use the spikes as a light

weapon that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage; in

conjunction with an unarmed or natural attack, the

spike stones deal an additional 1d4 points of piercing

damage with each hit.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, spike stones, creator must be a

maug; Market Price: 4,000 gp.

Stone Spitter: A stone spitter is a boxlike or binlike

device, usually affixed to the shoulder of a creature. At

the weapons base is a tube from which stones can be

fired with amazing accuracy and deadly effect. A crea-

ture grafted with a stone spitter can use it to fire a stone

or sling bullet by making a ranged attack. Such attacks

have a range increment of 50 feet, dealing damage

according to the grafted creatures size (see Table A23).

Six times per day, the stone spitter can fire its ammunition

at a supernaturally high velocity and power. Such attacks

deal damage one die type higher than normal (use the

Increased column on Table A23) and have a +1 enhance-

ment bonus on attack and damage rolls. A stone spitter can

be loaded with up to 50 stones or sling bullets.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, magic stone, creator must be a

maug; Market Price: 2,000 gp.

UNDEAD GRAFTS

The results of vile experimentation by living necro-

mancers and death priests seeking to become more like

what they revere while remaining on this side of death,

undead grafts are formed of nonliving flesh attached to a

still-living body.

receive certain grafts for free as they advance in levels, and

become more adept in the use of their grafts as well.

Bonemail: Bonemail resembles armor crafted from

interlocking bones and shards of bone, but is actually part

of the grafted creatures body. Bonemail grants a +2 natural

armor bonus to the grafted creatures AC.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, gentle repose; Market Price:

16,000 gp.

Enervating Arm: An enervating arm is a gaunt

limb of desiccated, leathery flesh. It grants a +4

inherent bonus to the grafted creatures Strength.

Twice per day, the grafted creature can use an ener-

vating touch to bestow one negative level on a living

creature. The Fortitude save to remove the negative

level has a DC of 14. A touch that misses does not

count against the daily limit.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, enervation; Market Price:

40,000 gp.

Mummified Eye: This hard, round orb looks

much like a normal eye at first glance, but it has a

distinctly dry appearance and does not move in the

socket. Often a pale light seems to shine inside it.

The grafted creature can use the eyebite spell as a

12th-level caster once per day.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, eyebite; Market Price:

50,000 gp.

Paralyzing  Arm: A  paralyzing  arm  is  a

hardy limb of preserved undead flesh. It grants a

+4  inherent  bonus  to  the  grafted  creatures

Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can

use a paralyzing touch: A living creature touched

must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be paralyzed

for 1d6+2 minutes. Elves are immune to this paralyz-

ing touch. A touch that misses does not count against

the daily limit.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, gentle repose, ghoul touch; Market

Price: 40,000 gp.

Weakening Arm: A weakening arm is a skeletal forelimb

that grants a +4 inherent bonus to the grafted creatures

Strength. Twice per day, the grafted creature can use a weak-

ening touch: A living creature touched takes 1d6 points of

Strength damage. A touch that misses does not count

against the daily limit.

Prerequisite: Graft Flesh, ray of enfeeblement; Market Price:

40,000 gp.

YUAN-TI GRAFTS

Yuan-ti grafts are serpentine body parts that can be attached

to the body of another corporeal creature.

Acquiring an Undead Graft

Any spellcaster with the Graft Flesh feat and the proper pre-

requisites can create and apply an undead graft. Members of

the pale master prestige class (detailed in Tome and Blood)

The monstrously powerful yuan-ti anathemas (described

earlier in this book) are the primary creators of yuan-ti

grafts, since they can create them quickly. Other yuan-ti

learn the Graft Flesh feat and enhance their minions with

these grafts.

Added Tail: Extending from the creatures tailbone

rather than replacing its legs, an added tail gives the grafted

creature a natural swim speed equal to half its land speed.

Like any creature with a natural swim speed, the grafted

creature need not make Swim checks to move at its swim

speed underwater, and gains a +8 racial bonus on Swim

checks made to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. The grafted creature can always choose to take 10

on a Swim check, even if rushed or threatened when swim-

ming, and can use the run action while swimming, if it

swims in a straight line. The grafted creature also gains a +4

racial bonus on Balance checks, and can constrict Small or

smaller creatures: With a successful grapple check, it deals

1d4 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1 1/2 times its

Strength modifier to the grappled foe.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a yuan-ti; Market

Price: 6,000 gp.

Poison Fangs: These long, sharp fangs allow the grafted

creature to deliver poison (Fort DC 17 negates) with its bite.

Initial and secondary damage are the same (1d6 Con). If the

grafted creature did not previously have a natural bite

attack, it can bite only a grappled foe (delivering the poison

with a successful grapple check to pin the creature) or a

helpless opponent.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a yuan-ti; Market

Price: 8,000 gp.

Replacement Tail: This tail replaces the grafted creatures

legs or rear limbs. The grafted creatures base land speed is

reduced by 10 feet, but it can climb and swim at half its orig-

inal land speed. The creature can constrict Medium-size or

smaller creatures: With a successful grapple check, it deals

1d4 points of bludgeoning damage plus 1 1/2 times its

Strength modifier to the grappled foe.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a yuan-ti; Market

Price: 12,000 gp.

Scaly Skin: This yuan-ti skin improves the grafted crea-

tures natural armor bonus by +3.

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a yuan-ti; Market

Price: 36,000 gp.

Serpent Arm: This is a long, flexible arm ending in a

snake head. The grafted creature can make one bite attack

with the arm, dealing 1d4 points of damage plus poison

(Fort DC 17 negates). Initial and secondary damage are the

same (1d6 Con).

Prerequisites: Graft Flesh, creator must be a yuan-ti; Market

Price: 12,000 gp.

SYMBIONTS

Symbionts are complete creatures, generally capable of

surviving apart from a host creature for at least some

length of time. They are generally Tiny or smaller, and

physically very weak on their own. They survive by join-

ing with a host creature, usually granting the host certain

benefits in exchange for the protection afforded by a

larger body. This symbiotic relationship usually benefits

both parties (though in some cases the symbiont might

better be described as a parasite).

A symbiont occupies part of the host creatures body

sometimes, but not always, limiting the number of magic

items the host can use in the same way as a magic item does.

Like intelligent magic items, symbionts have Ego scores,

which reflect their strength of will and drive for power.

Symbionts with high Ego scores, like such magic items, can

sometimes take control of their host creatures.

The Ego score of a symbiont is determined in the same

way as that of an intelligent magic item, and listed with

each symbionts entry in this appendix. Add the sym-

bionts Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma bonuses (if

any) to determine its base Ego score. Add 1 for each spe-

cial quality and 2 for each special attack. Add 4 if the sym-

biont is an outsider. For example, a fiendish familiar has a

base Ego score of 1 (from its 12 Intelligence), plus 1 for its

arcane education special quality, 1 for its enhance spell-

caster special quality, 1 for its telepathic ability, and 4 for

being an outsider, for a total Ego of 8. Evil and malevolent

as a fiendish familiar may be, few characters stand any risk

of having it subvert their will. On the other hand, a mind

leech has a base Ego score of 8 (Int 16, Wis 14, Cha 16),

plus 2 for its mind blast special attack, 4 for its psionic

abilities of charm monster and suggestion, 1 for its detect

thoughts psionic ability, and 1 for its telepathy, for a total

Ego of 16.

If the host creature does not share the symbionts align-

ment and goals, a conflict results between the symbiont and

the host creature. Similarly, a symbiont with an Ego score of

20 or higher always considers itself superior to its host, and

a personality conflict results if the host does not always

agree with the symbiont.

When a personality conflict occurs, the host must make

a Will saving throw (DC = symbionts Ego). If the host

creature succeeds, it is dominant. If the host fails, the sym-

biont is dominant. Dominance lasts for one day or until a

critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious

threat to either the symbiont or the host, and so on

DMs discretion). Should a symbiont gain dominance, it

directly controls the host creatures actions until the host

regains dominance.

Symbiont Traits: When joined with a host, a symbiont

gains a number of benefits. It acts on its hosts turn each

round, regardless of its own initiative modifier. It is not flat-

footed unless its host is, and it is aware of any danger its host

is aware of.

215

If a symbiont is grafted onto a visible part of the host crea-

tures body (as opposed to the mind leech, for example,

which coils around the hosts brain stem), opponents can

attack the symbiont itself instead of its host creature. This

works the same way as attacking an object: The symbiont

gains the benefit of the hosts Dexterity modifier to AC

instead of its own, and gains any deflection bonus to AC the

host has as well. Its own size modifier and natural armor

bonus, if any, apply. Attacking a symbiont instead of its host

provokes an attack of opportunity from the host.

A symbiont never takes damage from attacks directed at

the host. Like a worn magic item, a symbiont is usually unaf-

fected by spells that damage the host, but if the host rolls a 1

on its saving throw, the symbiont is one of the items that

can be affected by the spell (see Items Surviving after a

Saving Throw in Chapter 10 of the Players Handbook). A sym-

biont uses its hosts base saving throw bonuses if they are

better than its own.

Share Spells (Su): Any spell the host creature casts on

itself automatically also affects the symbiont. Additionally,

the host may cast a spell with a target of You on the sym-

biont instead of on itself. Likewise, a symbiont can choose

to have any spell or spell-like ability it uses on itself also

affect the host creature, and may cast a spell with a target of

You on its host instead of on itself. The host and symbiont

can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect

creatures of the host or symbionts type. Spells targeted on

the host by another spellcaster do not affect the symbiont,

and vice versa.

CEREBRAL SYMBIONT

Cerebral symbionts have in common some assortment of

psionic powers and, at least in theory, some connection to

the mind flayers, who are presumed to have created them.

Combat

Cerebral symbionts are not generally powerful combatants

on their own merits. The cerebral hood is an exception,

because its method of attachment requires overpowering

its host.

The cerebral hood resembles a small cloaker, though it has

no eyes or mouth. It is a black, somewhat amorphous, leath-

ery creature that flies slowly by undulating its body through

the air. A long tail dangles from its mass, thick and heavy but

also wet and tubular. Numerous spiny protrusions extend

from the tail.

Cerebral hoods do not speak any language, but they

understand Undercommon.

Combat

A cerebral hood attaches itself to a host by engulfing the

creatures head and extending its tail into the creatures

mouth and down its throat. In the throat, the tails spiny

tendrils extend to make key connections to the host bodys

nervous, digestive, and circulatory systems. Because it is so

weak, it prefers to attack stunned or helpless beings, so it

often initiates combat with its mind blast or lingers near

mind flayer lairs and waits for a victim of the illithids

mind blast.

Engulf (Ex): A cerebral hood can try to wrap the head of

a Medium-size or smaller creature in its body as a standard

action. The hood attempts a grapple that does not provoke

an attack of opportunity. If it gets a hold (grapple bonus

11), the target is effectively blinded and cannot breathe.

The cerebral hood immediately begins trying to insert its

tail into the victims throat, which requires another suc-

cessful grapple check.

Because its grapple bonus is so poor, a cerebral hood gen-

erally attacks only stunned opponents in this manner.

Mind Blast (Su): This attack is a 60-foot cone. Anyone

caught in this cone must succeed on a Will save (DC 17)

or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Each time the cerebral hood

uses this ability, it deals 1 point of Intelligence damage to

the host.

A cerebral hood without a host has a weaker mind blast.

The cone is only 15 feet long, the save DC is only 13, and tar-

gets who fail their saves are stunned for only 1 round.

Mind Feeding (Su): A cerebral hood survives by con-

suming its hosts mental energy. This deals 1 point of

Intelligence damage each day the hood remains attached.

Ordinarily, the host regains 1 lost point of Intelligence

each night, just before the cerebral hood drains a new

point,  keeping  the  host  at  an

equilibrium point of 1 to its

base Intelligence. When

the cerebral hood uses its

mind blast, however, it

deals extra Intelligence

damage, so overuse of

that special attack can

eventually destroy the

hosts mind.

Blindsight (Ex): A

cerebral hood is blind,

but its entire body is a

primitive sensory organ

that can ascertain prey

by scent and vibration.

This ability enables it to

discern objects and

creatures  within

60 feet. The cerebral

hood usually does not need

to make Spot or Listen checks

to notice creatures within range

of its blindsight. A cerebral hood

attached to a host shares its sen-

sory input with the host, confer-

ring blindsight on the host.

Mouth Tube (Ex): A cerebral hood

joins its host by extending its tail through the crea-

tures mouth and down its throat. The host no longer needs

to eat or breathe, since the cerebral hood supplies it with

oxygen and nutrients through a tube in its tail. The host is

immune to gases, including inhaled diseases and poisons,

and is not at risk from starvation or dehydration as long as it

has Intelligence for the cerebral hood to feed upon.

Telepathy (Su): A cerebral hood can communicate

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a

language.

Skills: A cerebral hood has a +4 racial bonus on Move

Silently checks.

A mind leech is a small, slimy creature that coils itself

around the brain stem of the creature carrying it. A mind

leechs host creature can gain no benefit from a magic

amulet, brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab.

A mind leech does not speak any language, but it under-

stands Undercommon.

Combat

A mind leech is almost totally helpless when not attached

to a host. It hides in wet areas and attacks creatures that

pass through its space, using surprise to avoid attacks of

opportunity.

Attach (Ex): If a mind leech hits with its bite attack, it

burrows into the targets flesh and makes its way to the brain

stem. Since the bite deals no damage and the leech secretes

an anesthetic, the host is often unaware it has been bitten

until the mind leech has established itself at the seat of the

hosts central nervous system.

Mind Blast (Su): This attack is a 60-foot cone. Anyone

caught in this cone must make a Will save (DC 17) or be

stunned for 1d4 rounds. Each time the mind leech uses this

ability, it deals 1 point of Intelligence damage to the host. A

mind leech without a host cannot use this ability.

Psionics (Sp): At willcharm monster, detect thoughts,

dominate person, and suggestion. These abilities are as the

spells cast by a 10th-level sorcerer (save DC 13 + spell level).

Each time the mind leech uses its charm monster or sugges-

tion powers, it deals 1 point of Intelligence damage to the

host. Using its dominate person ability deals 2 points of Intel-

ligence damage. A mind leech without a host cannot use

these abilities (though it can detect thoughts).

Telepathy (Su): A mind leech can communicate telepath-

ically with its host, if its host has a language.

Skills: A mind leech has a +4 racial bonus on Move

A psionic sinew is a revolting, wormlike length of muscle

endowed with sentience and psionic power.

A psionic sinew does not speak any language, but it

understands Undercommon.

218

Combat

A psionic sinew has no way to attach itself to an unwilling

host. In general, creatures seek out a psionic sinew to gain

its benefits (much like a graft), or encounter a psionic sinew

and voluntarily attach it to their own bodies.

Claws of the Bear (Sp): At will (and usually at the host

creatures command), a psionic sinew can use the claws of

the bear psionic power on the host. The hosts forearms

lengthen  and  its  hands  (or  equivalent  appendages)

broaden into wide paws with sicklelike bear claws. This

power gives the host natural weapons that deal 1d12 points

of slashing damage (plus the hosts Strength modifier) on a

successful attack. The claws remain for 3 hours. Each time

the psionic sinew uses this ability, it deals 1 point of Dex-

terity damage to the host. A psionic sinew without a host

cannot use this ability.

Blindsight (Ex): A psionic sinew is blind, but its entire

body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by

scent and vibration. This ability enables it to discern objects

and creatures within 60 feet. A psionic sinew usually does

not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice creatures

within range of its blindsight.

Enhance Strength (Su): A psionic sinew grants its

host a +4 enhancement bonus to its Strength score. This

bonus remains in effect as long as the psionic sinew is

attached.

Inertial Armor (Su): A psionic sinew is surrounded by a

tangible field of psychokinetic force that grants it a +4

armor bonus to AC. When attached to a host, the psionic

sinew extends this field of force to cover the host creature

as well. Inertial armor entails no armor check penalty,

speed reduction, or arcane spell failure chance. Because it is

composed of force, incorporeal creatures cant bypass it the

way they do normal armor.

Vigor (Sp): Once per hour, a psionic sinew can give itself

or its host 3 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute. Each

time the psionic sinew uses this ability, it deals 1 point of

Dexterity damage to the host. A psionic sinew without a

host cannot use this ability.

FIENDISH SYMBIONTS

Fiendish symbionts are among the most loathsome crea-

tures in all existencetiny spawn of the Lower Planes that

survive only by attaching themselves to larger creatures.

Combat

As a rule, fiendish symbionts have no attack forms worth

noting; only the soul tick is an exception.

Outsider Traits: A fiendish symbiont has darkvision (60-

foot range). It cannot be raised or resurrected (though a wish

or miracle spell can restore life).

Telepathy (Su): A fiendish symbiont can communicate

telepathically with its host creature, if the host has a language.

Acquiring a Fiendish Symbiont

As with fiendish grafts, fiendish

symbionts can be acquired by a

variety of means. The same mag-

ical devices that attach fiendish

grafts have also been known to

attach fiendish familiars. Any

kind of fiendish symbiont can be

given to a charac-

ter as part of a ritual

or a reward from a

fiend of corruption.

Fiendish

familiar

The  gutworm  and  the  soul

tick also attach themselves to

hosts in the same ways as more

mundane parasites. The larval

form of the gutworm often

infests impure water, while

the  soul  tick  attaches

itself  to  a  host  after

making  a  successful

melee attack.

15) every day or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage

as the experience drives them slowly mad.

Gutworm

Creatures of a nonevil alignment must make a Will

save (DC 15) each day or succumb to temptation to per-

form an evil act. This may result in an alignment change,

eventually.

When characters with fiendish symbionts interact

with nonevil NPCs, a 6 circumstance penalty is applied

on all Charisma-based checks (Diplomacy, Bluff, and so

on). This penalty applies even if the NPC is unaware of

the symbionts presence, since it reflects the subtle twist-

ing of the hosts personality.

Fiendish symbionts tend slightly toward parasitism,

siphoning some of their hosts physical or spiritual strength.

A fiendish familiar is a small face

with an evil expression that is grafted

onto the shoulder, back, stomach, or

hand of a character. It gives the most benefit

to hosts who are arcane spellcasters.

Fiendish familiars speak Common and Abyssal,

and can communicate telepathically.

Combat

Fiendish familiars do not engage in combat, nor do they

specifically aid their hosts in combatalthough the en-

hancements they offer to spellcasting hosts can be signifi-

cant in such situations.

Arcane Education (Ex): When grafted to a wizard, a

fiendish familiar can teach the character one new spell of

each spell level the character can cast. Each time the char-

acter gains access to a new spell level, the familiar teaches

the character one new spell in addition to the two spells

the character automatically gains for advancing a level.

When grafted to a sorcerer or bard, a fiendish familiar can

serve as a source of spell knowledge as described in the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Enhance Spellcaster (Ex): When grafted onto the

body of any spellcaster, a fiendish familiar increases the

characters effective spellcasting-related ability score by 2

for purposes of determining bonus spells. If the character

has more than one spellcasting class, each relevant ability

score is improved in this way.

An Abyssal relative of the tapeworm, the gutworm is a vile

fiend that lives in its hosts digestive system. It appears as a

1-to-2-foot long segmented worm of deep purple color,

dripping with thick yellowish slime. It has bulbous red

eyes and a toothy maw. Unlike a tapeworm, it does not

attach itself to the intestinal wall, but swims freely around

within the digestive tract, creating an uncomfortable sen-

sation in the host.

Gutworms do not speak, but they understand Abyssal.

Combat

Gutworms do not engage in combat.

Enhance Constitution (Ex): A creature with a gutworm

symbiont gains a +2 inherent bonus to its Constitution score.

Incite Rage (Ex): At will, a gutworm can cause its host

creature to enter a frenzied state identical to a barbarians

rage (+4 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will

saves, 2 AC penalty). The rage lasts 4 rounds, and the host

is not fatigued afterward.

220

Infect (Ex): Gutworm eggs are often found

in the polluted water of the Abyss and infect

creatures that drink the water. A purify water

spell does not remove the eggs from the water,

although they die if left in pure water for one day.

Once inside a host, the eggs hatch in 1d4 hours,

and the spawn set about devouring one another

until only one remains.

A remove disease spell cast on the host

kills a gutworm, but the host takes 4d6

points of damage from the creatures

death throes.

A creature with a gutworm must

eat twice as much food as it normally

requires each day, and must start

making daily Constitution checks

after only one day without food

(instead  of  the  normal  three

days). In addition, the host crea-

ture is fatigued after 8 hours of

activity and takes a 4 penalty

on the following checks and

saves:  Swim  checks  to  resist

subdual damage; Constitution

checks to continue running, to

avoid subdual damage from

a forced march, to hold its

breath, or to avoid subdual

damage from starvation or thirst; and

Fortitude saves to avoid subdual dam-

age from hot or cold environments, or to

resist damage from oxygen deprivation.

Neutralize Poison (Su): Once per day, a

gutworm can negate any poison introduced

into its hosts body (not just ingested poisons), protecting its

host from any ill effects.

Impede Magic (Ex): Any spells with the chaos or good

descriptor, as well as spells that use positive energy in any

way, are impeded when cast by the soul ticks

host. The host must make a Spellcraft check

(DC 15 + spell level) when trying to cast

such a spell. If this check fails, the spell

does not function and is lost. If the check

succeeds, the spell functions normally.

lawful evil

Advancement: 

The soul tick is an infernal

arachnid that attaches itself to

a hosts skin and feeds on its

blood. Its body is about 1 inch in

diameter, swelling to 2 inches

when full of blood (or up to about

4 inches when it overfeeds). It is

covered with a thin chitinous shell

of a dark reddish-brown color, shad-

ing to bright red at the ends of its

legs and its complex mouth. When

attached to its host, its legs and

head burrow into the hosts flesh,

leaving just its body visible.

Soul ticks do not speak, but they

understand Infernal.

Protective Aura (Su): A protection from good or pro-

tection from chaos effect constantly wards a

soul tick and its host, as the appro-

priate spell cast by a 12th-level

sorcerer.  The  soul  tick  can

change the aura at will as a

free action. The aura can be

dispelled, but the soul tick

can create it again during

its next turn as a free action.

(The defensive benefits from

the aura are not included in

the creatures statistics.)

Vulnerable to Holy Power

(Ex): A soul ticks host is affected by

holy power (such as holy smite spells

and  weapons  with  the  holy

property) as if the creature were

evil, regardless of its actual alignment.

Combat

Unlike other fiendish symbionts, soul ticks

can make melee attacks. The creatures pre-

ferred method of attack, however, is to hide in whatever ter-

rain is available and attack creatures that pass through its

space, using surprise to avoid attacks of opportunity. Once

attached, it uses telepathy to communicate with its new host,

trying to persuade it not to remove the tick and explaining

its powers.

Attach (Ex): If a soul tick hits with its bite attack, it uses

its mouth and eight legs to burrow into the targets flesh,

latching firmly onto the opponents body. An attached soul

tick loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, making its AC 18.

Blood Drain (Ex): A soul tick drains blood, dealing 1

point of Constitution damage each day it remains attached.

Ordinarily, the host regains 1 lost Constitution point each

night, just before the soul tick drains 1 new point, keeping

the host at an equilibrium point of 1 to its normal Consti-

tution. However, once per day as a full-round action the soul

tick can overfeed, draining enough blood to deal 1d4 points

of Constitution damage to its host, usually as punishment

for displeasing it.

Enhance Magic (Ex): Any spells with the death or evil

descriptor, as well as spells that use negative energy in any

way, are enhanced when cast by the soul ticks host. Such

spells are automatically empowered without changing the

A minor undead spirit similar to a ghost, a ghostly visage

inhabits corporeal bodies. Its name comes from its ability to

manifest a transparent face on its hosts body.

When not attached to a host, a ghostly visage looks like

little more than a puff of smoke about 1 foot in diameter.

Only by looking carefully can a character discern its eyes,

which appear simply as dark spots within the smoke.

When attached to a host, the visage normally lurks inside

the hosts body. It can, however, manifest a face on the

hosts body, including covering the hosts own face. This

face has a horrible appearance, contorted in the agony

of undeath.

Ghostly visages speak Common and

any one additional language.

Combat

Ghostly visages avoid open con-

flict, instead trying to incorpo-

rate  themselves  into  a  host

through stealth.

Because a ghostly vis-

age  is  automatically

affected  by  spells  its

host casts on itself, it

rarely chooses to join

a character capable of

casting healing spells

or similar spells that

would damage it while

benefiting the host.

Gaze  of  Terror  (Su):

Anyone within 30 feet of a

ghostly visage who

meets the eyes of

its manifested face

(see visage below)

must make a Will

saving throw (DC

13) or be paralyzed with fear

for 1d4 rounds. Ghostly vis-

ages are immune to their own gaze attacks and to those of

others of their kind.

Ghostly visage

Meld (Su): Once per round, a ghostly visage can merge

its body with a corporeal creature. If it makes a successful

incorporeal touch attack, the ghostly visages body disap-

pears into the opponents body. The target can resist the

attack with a successful Will save (DC 13). A creature that

successfully saves is immune to that ghostly visages meld

for one day.

Visage (Ex): At will, a ghostly visage can manifest a face

anywhere on its hosts body, including over the hosts own

face (the hosts vision is unaffected). This face looks corpo-

real and fleshy, but it is actually the visages incorporeal

form. When manifesting a visage, the ghostly visage is sus-

ceptible to attacks separate from its host. Attacks that miss

the visage because of its incorporeal nature (including

attacks from nonmagic weapons as well as attacks that are

foiled by the 50% chance to ignore damage) target the host

instead. For attacks that require attack rolls, if the attack roll

exceeds the AC of the host, the host takes damage instead of

the visage.

Incorporeal Subtype: A ghostly visage can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and super-

natural abilities. The creature has a 50%

chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, ex-

cept  for  force  effects  or

attacks  made  with

ghost  touch  weap-

ons. A ghostly visage

can pass through solid

objects,  but  not  force

effects, at will. Its attacks

ignore  natural  armor,

armor,  and  shields,  but

deflection  bonuses  and

force effects work nor-

mally  against  them.  A

ghostly  visage  always

moves silently and can-

not be heard with Lis-

ten checks if it doesnt

wish to be.

Mind Shielding

(Ex): When attached to

a host, a ghostly visage

protects  the  host  from

mind-affecting spells and

effects. This ability is similar

to a mind blank spell, but does

not protect the creature from divina-

tion spells that are not mind-affecting.

In essence, the ghostly visage confers its undead immu-

nity to mind-affecting spells upon the host.

Undead Traits: A ghostly visage is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically

affect undead), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to critical

hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy

drain, or death from massive damage. A ghostly visage

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A ghostly visage has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff

and Intimidate checks.

INTRODUCTION

The new Fiend Folio book has an emphasis on, logically

enough, fiends: outsiders with the evil subtype. So

great is this emphasis that the book even offers new

ways to enhance the powers and abilities of such crea-

tures, particularly as they pertain to their interactions

with mortals.

The Fiend Folio offers three new prestige classes

designed especially for fiendsthe fiend of blas-

phemy, the fiend of corruption, and the fiend of posses-

sion. This article explores the application of those pres-

tige classes by offering detailed statistics and brief

histories for several fiends that have adopted them.

Each prestige class is illustrated with two fiends, one

from the Monster Manual and one from the Fiend Folio.

These creatures are ready-to-use NPCs that you can

drop into your campaign world wherever you need a

real challenge for your players!

PREPARATION

You, the Dungeon Master (DM), need a copy of the

Players Handbook, the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, and the

Monster Manual to use this material. You may also want

to have a copy of the Fiend Folio handy.

FIENDS OF BLASPHEMY

Fiends who belong to the fiend of blasphemy prestige

class specialize in building cults of followers to spread

their evil and gain new adherents for their patron

deities. Those who swear a blood oath with such a fiend

become its pawns for life.

GNEETHU: GLABREZU

FIEND OF BLASPHEMY

Because she spent considerable time in the service of

the evil god Erythnul, Gneethu eventually chose to

become a cleric of that foul deity. As a reward for her

faithful service, Erythnul sent Gneethu to the Material

Plane to gather cults in his name.

Gneethu delights in murder and wanton destruc-

tion  the more violent the better  and she has built

several cults of Erythnul over the years. Her usual tech-

nique for acquiring new cultists is to disguise herself as

a less threatening being and befriend a single individ-

ual, either by promising to rid the person of a trouble-

some enemy or through her charm ability. She then

uses that person as a shill to identify especially angry

and violent people in the community, whom she can

1

then encourage in their destructive tendencies. She

promises her cultists power and wealth, and she usually

succeeds in fulfilling those promises merely by direct-

ing the murderous tendencies of her cultists toward

profitable targets.

Gneethu moves from place to place frequently, leav-

ing her cultists in the hands of mortal clerics she has

sponsored. She hopes to build a worldwide network of

hidden cults of Erythnul that can one day be mobilized

in a mass uprising.

At present, she is based in a series of natural caves

near a large city. Her cultists there now number twelve,

including one 10th-level human cleric. Gneethu plans

to have her cultists kidnap the son of the leader of the

merchants guild and force him to swear the blood oath.

If she succeeds, she will have access to all the financing

her cult needs, as well as subtle leverage within the

guild structure.

bonus +33). If she gets a hold, she has the option to con-

duct the grapple normally or simply use her pincers to

hold the opponent (20 penalty on grapple check, but

Gneethu is not considered grappled). In either case,

each successful grapple check she makes during succes-

sive rounds automatically deals pincer damage.

Kill Cultist (Su): Gneethu can kill those who have

sworn her a blood oath if they displease her. Distance is

not a factor, but Gneethu cannot kill a cultist who is on a

different plane. The affected creature must make a Forti-

tude save (DC 19) or die. If the save is successful, the

creature takes 3d6+6 points of damage. Kill cultist is a

death effect.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willburning hands,

chaos hammer, charm person, confusion, death knell, deeper

darkness, desecrate, detect good, dispel magic, enlarge, mirror

image, reverse gravity, shatter, unholy blight. Caster level

10th; save DC 13 + spell level. At willteleport without

error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level

12th. 7/daypower word, stun. Caster level 15th.

Torture Cultist (Su): Gneethu can inflict pain

on those who have sworn her a blood oath. Distance is

not a factor, but she cannot torture a cultist who is on a

different plane. When she uses this ability, the target

cultist suffers excruciating pain. The affected creature

takes a 4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and abil-

ity checks for 6 rounds. A successful Fortitude save

(DC 19) lessens the penalty to 2.

Blood Oath (Su): Gneethu can perform a ritual

of initiation that binds cult members to his service.

The ritual forges a magical, mental bond between

Gneethu  and  those  mortals  who  participate.  It

requires one day of preparation, during which time

Gneethu must meditate and ready a room in which

the ritual will take place. The ritual itself lasts for 2

hours, plus an additional 10 minutes per mortal initi-

ate. If either the preparation or the ritual is inter-

rupted, the process is ruined and Gneethu must start

again. Every creature in the room (and no more than

60 feet away from Gneethu) when the ritual begins

or that enters that area during the ritual must make a

Will save (DC 19) or be affected as if by an enthrall

spell. A willing participant in the ritual takes a 4

penalty  on  this  saving  throw,  while  a  hostile

onlooker receives a +4 bonus. After the first 2 hours

of the ritual, each initiate receives Gneethus individ-

ual attention for 10 minutes, during which time the

bond between the two is formed, and the creature

becomes one of Gneethus cultists. An initiate who

wishes to resist the bond can attempt a Will saving

throw (DC 24). Willing participants may voluntarily

fail their saving throws. If an initiate makes a suc-

cessful saving throw, Gneethu is aware that the bond

was not properly formed, but this does not interrupt

the ritual.

Detect Magic (Su): Gneethu continuously has a

detect magic effect in operation (caster level 12th).

planes. Gneethu can use this ability on any

given cultist once per day, but there is no

limit to how many cultists she can scry

on in a day.

Sponsor  Worshiper  (Su):

Gneethu can channel spellcasting

ability  from  Erythnul  to  mortals

with levels in the cleric class. She

can sponsor a cleric of up to 12th

level, who receives access to the full

complement of cleric spells as well

as any two domains selected from

those offered by Erythnul.

Summon TTanarri (Sp): Once

per day, Gneethu can attempt to

summon  4d10  dretches  or  1d2

vrocks with a 50% chance of suc-

cess, or another glabrezu with a

20% chance of success.

Telepathy (Su): Gneethu can

communicate telepathically with

any creature within 100 feet that

has a language (except dretches).

Transfer  SSpell-Like  AAbility

(Sp): Gneethu  can  grant  her

cultists  access  to  her  spell-like

abilities as though using the imbue

with spell-like ability spell. She can

give one creature that has sworn

her a blood oath access to as many

of her own spell-like abilities as she

desires. The cultist can use each

such ability once per day, with all

variable characteristics (including

caster  level  and  save  DC)  deter-

mined as if Gneethu herself were

using the ability. When she transfers a

spell-like ability, Gneethu cannot use that

ability as often as usual. She can use an ability nor-

mally available at will only 4 times per day, and she

loses one use per day from more limited abilities.

Gneethu can bestow the same ability on multiple

cultists or allow cultists to use the ability more than

once per day, but in doing so she loses more of his own

daily uses of the ability. For example, Gneethu can

grant two of her cultists the ability to use dispel magic

once per day, or grant a single cultist the ability to

dispel magic twice per day, but she herself can then use

dispel magic only three times per day (instead of at will)

as long as the cultists retain their ability. Gneethu can

revoke the transfer at any time as a free action. If the

Locate Cultist (Su): Gneethu has a telepathic

bond with each of her cultists. At will, she can generate

an effect identical to that of a locate creature spell to

sense the location of any creature that has sworn a

blood oath with her.

Mind Shielding (Su): Gneethu is immune to

the detect thoughts and discern lies spells.

Outsider Traits: Gneethu has darkvision (60-

foot  range).  She  cannot  be  raised  or  resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Scry oon CCultist (Sp): Gneethu can scry on any

creature that has sworn her a blood oath, as if using

the scrying spell. She cannot scry on cultists on other

cultist had already used the ability during the current

day, it counts as if Gneethu had used it that day as well.

True Seeing (Su): Gneethu continuously has a

true seeing effect active, as the divine version of the spell

(caster level 12th).

Undetectable  Alignment  (Su): Gneethus

alignment is constantly concealed from all forms of div-

ination as though with the undetectable alignment spell.

AGELLUS: WASTRILITH

FIEND OF BLASPHEMY

Agellus also worships Erythnul, but his cults are made

up of seafarerspirates, for the most part. He hand-

picks pirate crews from among his cultists and provides

them with ships purchased with the income from past

expeditions. All his ships fly the flag of the famous (and

fictional) Jovar, but in reality there is no such person.

Agellus has carefully nurtured the legend of Jovar and

ensured that he received the credit (or blame) for the

most vicious pirate attacks in all the seas. In Jovars name,

he and his cultists burn and wreck ships of every nation,

just for the fun of it. Though Agellus travels with his

ships occasionally, he never reveals his presence except

to the captains and other trusted members of the crew.

Agellus is a canny operator; he plans to control the

seas through his cults, bringing terror to the shipping

lanes and extorting money not only from human cities,

but also from undersea dwellers who fear his cultists.

He prefers to collect his protection money and treasure

in the form of statues and jewelry that he gleefully

melts down to misshapen lumps of metal for the sheer

joy of destroying a beautiful object.

Agellus is presently based on an island in a chain

just off the coast of a large continent. Several coastal

cities provide him with more than enough shipping to

raid. He has been careful thus far not to raid any one

merchants shipping so much that the merchant goes

out of business; that would be detrimental to his plans.

(Reflex DC 21 half ).

wastrilith can use summon monster IX. Caster level 17th.

It can only summon aquatic and water-based creatures,

such as fiendish sharks or squids and water elementals.

Blood Oath (Su): Agellus can perform a ritual of

initiation that binds cult members to his service. The

ritual forges a magical, mental bond between Agellus

and those mortals who participate. It requires one day

of preparation, during which time Agellus must medi-

tate and ready a room in which the ritual will take

place.  The  ritual  itself  lasts  for  2  hours,  plus  an

4

additional 10 minutes per mortal initiate. If either the

preparation or the ritual is interrupted, the process is

ruined and Agellus must start again. Every creature in

the room (and no more than 60 feet away from Agellus)

when the ritual begins or that enters that area during

the ritual must make a Will save (DC 21) or be affected

as if by an enthrall spell. A willing participant in the

ritual takes a 4 penalty on this saving throw, while a

hostile onlooker receives a +4 bonus. After the first 2

hours of the ritual, each initiate receives Agelluss indi-

vidual attention for 10 minutes, during which time the

bond between the two is formed, and the creature

becomes one of Agelluss cultists. An initiate who

wishes to resist the bond can attempt a Will saving

throw (DC 21). Willing participants may voluntarily

fail their saving throws. If an initiate makes a successful

saving throw, Agellus is aware that the bond was not

properly formed, but this does not interrupt the ritual.

Break Summoning (Ex): If summoned via a

summon  monster spell,  a  wastrilith  can  make  an

opposed Wisdom check to break free of the summon-

ing. If it succeeds, it then goes on a rampage, attacking

the summoner.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving

throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a suc-

cessful saving throw.

Locate Cultist (Su): Agellus has a telepathic

bond with each of his cultists. At will, he can generate

an effect identical to that of a locate creature spell to

sense the location of any creature that has sworn a

blood oath with him.

Outsider Traits: Agellus has darkvision (60-foot

range). He cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Telepathy (Su): Wastriliths can communicate

telepathically with any creature within 100 feet that

has a language.

Transfer SSpell-Like AAbility (Sp): Agellus can grant

his cultists access to his spell-like abilities as though

using the imbue with spell-like ability spell. He can give

one creature that has sworn him a blood oath access to

as many of his own spell-like abilities as he desires. The

cultist can use each such ability once per day, with all

variable characteristics (including caster level and save

DC) determined as if Agellus himself were using the

ability. When he transfers a spell-like ability, Agellus

cannot use that ability as often as usual. He can use an

ability normally available at will only 4 times per day,

and he loses one use per day from more limited abili-

ties. Agellus can bestow the same ability on multiple

cultists or allow cultists to use the ability more than

once per day, but in doing so he loses more of his own

daily uses of the ability. For example, Agellus can grant

two of his cultists the ability to use dispel magic once per

day, or grant a single cultist the ability to dispel magic

twice per day, but he himself can then use dispel magic

only three times per day (instead of at will) as long as

the cultists retain their ability. Agellus can revoke the

transfer at any time as a free action. If the cultist had

already used the ability during the current day, it

counts as if Agellus had used it that day as well.

Undetectable Alignment (Su): Agelluss align-

ment is constantly concealed from all forms of divina-

tion as though with the undetectable alignment spell.

Water Mastery (Ex): A wastrilith gains a +1

bonus on its attack and damage rolls if its opponent is

touching water.

Fiend of Blasphemy Spells Prepared (3/2;

save DC 12 + spell level): 1stbane, cause fear, protection

FIENDS OF CORRUPTION

Fiends of corruption specialize in tempting mortals to

evil. They use their powers to grant favors to mortals to

create a dependence, then twist and corrupt their vic-

tims and lead them to evil.

DELORATH: ERINYES

FIEND OF CORRUPTION

Delorath has been plying her fiendish trade on the

Material Plane for several decades. Her specialty is the

corruption of young male aristocrats and the occasional

adventurer. She often poses as a young noble or widow

in search of excitement to create an illicit and danger-

ous atmosphere for her seductions.

Once her victims are involved with her, she subtly

encourages them to take risks and commit crimes on

her behalf. When they do so, she acts surprised and

begins hinting that she might tell on them. This lever-

age allows her to steer her victims toward even more

outrageous acts to keep her favor and avoid discovery.

Delorath has also been known to take the role of a

taciturn adventurer, most often a rogue or fighter, who

resists advances from men. By playing hard to get, she

5

gains the attention of male adventurers who like a

challenge. She often uses her geas power to send them

on quests that will take them further into the path of

temptation. In particularly difficult cases, she even

impersonates the wives of important men and leads

them down the path of iniquity.

Dominate Person (Su): Delorath can dominate

a humanoid creature with a look. This is not a gaze

attack, and the target need not meet her eye. This abil-

ity has a range of 60 feet; an affected opponent must

succeed at a Will save (DC 19) or become utterly loyal

to Delorath. The victim will do anything to protect

Delorath, even if that means slaying his or her compan-

ions or facing certain death. The ability is otherwise

similar to a dominate person spell (caster level 8th).

Geas(Sp): Delorath can use geas/quest once per day.

Mark oof JJustice(Sp): Delorath can use mark of justice

once per day to cement a good persons descent into

evil. Once her victim is living an immoral life, she uses

mark of justice to ensure that he does not return to his

old ways or seek atonement. She generally hides her

mark in a location that is not obvious.

Rope Entangle (Ex): Delorath carries a stout

rope some 50 feet long that entangles opponents of any

size as an animate rope spell (caster level 16th). She can

hurl the rope 30 feet with no range penalty.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead,

charm monster, desecrate, invisibility (self only), magic circle

against good (self only), major image, polymorph self, pro-

duce flame, see invisibility, suggestion, unholy blight. Caster

level 8th; save DC 16 + spell level. At willteleport with-

out error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster

level 12th.

Suggestion (Sp): Delorath can use suggestion (caster

level 6th; save DC 21) three times per day. A target that

is currently under the influence of Deloraths charm

monster or dominate person takes a 2 penalty on the

saving throw.

Temptation (Su): Delorath can offer good crea-

tures the opportunity to change their alignment to evil.

This works like the redemption or temptation function

of the atonement spell, and she can use this ability

whenever the opportunity arises.

Alternate Form (Su): Delorath can assume any

humanoid form of Small to Large size as a standard

action. This ability is similar to the polymorph self spell

but allows only humanoid forms. While using this abil-

ity, she gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise

checks.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that nor-

mally allows a character to attempt a Reflex saving

throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a suc-

cessful saving throw.

Fiends Favor (Su): Once per day, Delorath can

grant a touched creature a +3 bonus to one of the crea-

tures ability scores. This bonus stacks with any other

bonus the creature may already have and lasts for one

day. When the effect expires, the creature takes a 3

penalty to the same ability score for the next day.

Another application of fiends favor not only negates

the penalty, but restores the full bonus.

Fiendish Graft (Su): Once per month, Delorath

can bestow a fiendish graft or symbiont on a willing

mortal.

Grant WWish (Sp): Delorath can grant a wish to a

mortal (not an elemental, outsider, or nonliving crea-

ture) once per day. Using this ability costs her experi-

ence points as if she were casting a wish spell.

Major CCreation(Sp): Delorath can use major creation

three times per day (caster level 6th).

Mind Shielding (Su): Delorath is completely

immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to

magically discern her alignment.

Outsider Traits: Delorath has darkvision (60-

foot  range).  She  cannot  be  raised  or  resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

See in Darkness (Su): Delorath can see perfectly

in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper

darkness spell.

6

Soul Bargain (Su): Delorath can enter a binding

agreement with a mortal, at the cost of the mortals soul.

The mortal victim must enter into the soul bargain will-

ingly. Upon the mortals death (by any means), his soul

is transferred to a gem (prepared as with the soul bind

spell when the bargain is forged), even if the gem and

the mortal are not on the same plane at the time. The

bargain requires 1 hour to complete, and it is utterly

inviolable once forged. The only way to escape a soul

bargain is to recover the gem after the mortals death

and break it, freeing his soul and allowing him to be

restored to life through the normal means.

Summon BBaatezu (Sp): Once per

day,  Delorath  can  attempt  to

summon 2d10 lemures with a

50% chances of success, or

1d4 barbezu with a 35%

chance  of  success.

Telepathy (Su):

Delorath can communi-

cate telepathically with

any  other  creature

within 100 feet that

has a language.

Tongues (Su): Delorath

has a permanent tongues abil-

ity as the spell (caster level

12th).

Possessions: +2 silent

ler, dagger of venom, +1 wound-

SHAANYRA: PAELIRYON

FIEND OF CORRUPTION

Like others of her kind, Shaanyra prefers to run her evil

operations from behind the scenes. When a key mortal

targeted for corruption resists the efforts of her agents,

however, she sometimes takes a personal hand in the

matter. Shaanyra usually poses as a courtesan or a pam-

pered young woman, but her air of control occasionally

makes her seem out of place with her disguises. Accus-

tomed to being in charge, Shaanyra has to concentrate

to appear simpering and helpless. Still, some men take

her preoccupied air as a challenge.

Shaanyra doesnt enjoy the things that most mortals

find pleasant. In particular, she hates sunshine and finds

sentiments such as love, courage, and self-sacrifice dis-

gusting. She thus does her best to persuade those under

her influence to turn their backs on such feelings and

embrace the darker side of themselves. Where there is

love, she works to turn it into hate; where there is

courage, she tries to convert it to self-interest.

Presently, Shaanyra is personally handling the cor-

ruption of the new ruler of a small region that recently

won  its  freedom  from

overlords  who  had

enslaved its people. The

downfall  of  this  small

nation  will  inhibit  the

cause  of  freedom  in  the

land for years to come.

Belittle (Ex): As a standard action, Shaanyra can

belittle creatures by hurling insults and epithets that

7

seem to strike at the heart of her foes insecurities. This

is a mind-affecting effect that originates from Shaanyra

and extends outward in a 60-foot cone. Each opponent

within the cone must make a successful Will save (DC

24) or be stunned for 1 round. Anyone who succeeds

on the save but remains within the cone must continue

to save each round that Shaanyra continues to belittle.

After being stunned, an opponent becomes shaken for

3d4 rounds, though he or she cannot be stunned again

by Shaanyra for one day.

Deform (Su): Shaanyra can twist and deform

victims struck by her fingernails. Anyone so struck

must make a Fortitude save (DC 24). Success indi-

cates that the victim takes only normal fingernail

damage. Failure indicates that the victim takes 1d4

points of temporary Charisma damage in addition to

normal damage.

Fingernails (Ex): Shaanyras fingernails are her

deadliest  weapon.  She  can  extend  them  from  her

hands, which enables her to attack foes up to 30 feet

away with them as if she had 30-foot reach. Those

struck by Shaanyras fingernails may fall prey to her

deform special attack, as well as take normal damage.

Shaanyra can extend or retract her fingernails at will as

a free action.

Intoxicating Scent (Su): Any creature that

comes within 30 feet of Shaanyra must make a success-

ful Will save (DC 24) or be intoxicated by her pernicious

aura. This ability works like a mind fog spell (caster level

20th); its effects persist as long as the victim remains

within  30  feet  of  Shaanyra,  plus  an  additional  2d6

rounds. A creature that succeeds on its Will save remains

immune to Shaanyras intoxicating scent for one day.

Suggestion(Sp): Shaanyra can use suggestion (caster

level 2nd; save DC 20) three times per day. A target that

is currently under the influence of Shaanyras charm

person takes a 2 penalty on the saving throw.

Alternate Form (Su): Shaanyra can assume any

humanoid form of Small to Large size as a standard

action. This ability is similar to the polymorph self spell

but allows only humanoid forms. While using this abil-

ity, she gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise

checks.

Augmented Critical (Ex): Shaanyras finger-

nails threaten a critical hit on a natural attack roll of

1720 because of her augmented critical ability and her

Improved Critical feat. On a successful critical hit with

her fingernails, Shaanyra deals triple damage.

Fiends Favor (Su): Once per day, Shaanyra can

grant a touched creature a +3 bonus to one of its ability

scores. This bonus stacks with any other bonus the

creature may already have and lasts for one day. When

the effect expires, the creature takes a 3 penalty to the

same ability score for the next day. Another application

of  fiends  favor  not  only  negates  the  penalty,  but

restores the full bonus.

Mind Shielding (Su): Shaanyra is completely

immune to detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to

magically discern her alignment.

Outsider Traits: Shaanyra has darkvision (60-

foot  range).  She  cannot  be  raised  or  resurrected

(though a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Scent (Ex): A paeliryon can detect approaching

enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of

smell.

See in Darkness: Shaanyra sees perfectly in

darkness of any kind, even that created by deeper dark-

ness spells.

See Invisibility (Su): Shaanyra continually uses

see invisibility as the spell (caster level 20th).

Summon BBaatezu(Sp): Once per day, Shaanyra can

automatically summon 4 lemures, 4 osyluths, 4 bar-

bazu,  2  erinyes,  2  cornugons,  or  2  gelugons  (her

choice).

Telepathy: Shaanyra can communicate telepathi-

cally with any creature within 100 feet that has a lan-

guage.

Tongues (Su): Shaanyra can speak with any crea-

ture that has a language, as though using a tongues spell

(caster level 20th). This ability is always active.

Possessions: Cloak of displacement (major), belt of

giant strength +4, eyes of charming, crystal ball with true

seeing, portable hole, Keoghtoms ointment.

FIENDS OF POSSESSION

Fiends of possession do their best work incognito. They

possess creatures or objects and use them to wreak

havoc, then depart. Often no one is the wiser once the

damage is done.

DKEB: ALKILITH

FIEND OF POSSESSION

Though most of his kind work their evil directly, Dkeb

was gifted with a supremely subtle nature. Realizing

that he could do the most damage by convincing others

to carry out destruction, he learned to possess objects

and then creatures and bend them to his will. Curious

by nature, he enjoys sizing up every potential victim

and assessing exactly how much evil he could do in

that particular guise. Dkeb finds his greatest joy in per-

petrating the maximum possible evil through each

guise he takes.

Like other alkiliths, Dkeb is especially fond of foul-

ing waterways. To that end, his missions usually involve

poisoning or otherwise fouling lakes, rivers, or wells

that serve humanoid communities. Often he achieves

this end by possessing the water itself. Once he pos-

sessed a small lake and caused it to attack those who

ventured too close. Their corpses rotted undiscovered

until the water had become vile and scummya home

for all manner of vermin and scavengers. His goals can

also be achieved by possessing objects that come in con-

tact with water or people who control the waterways.

Presently, he has taken control of a druid and is

working in that guise to ruin the river that provides

water for a large city and that also serves as the main

source of commercial trade.

Acid (Su): Anyone struck by Dkebs pseudopod

must  make  a  Fortitude  save  (DC  18)  or  take  an

additional 1d6 points of acid damage in the current

round and each of the next 1d6 rounds. Additionally,

each time a creature fails a Fortitude save against this

attack, one of its items is put at danger as if it had rolled

a natural 1 on its saving throw (see Items Surviving

after a Saving Throw in Chapter 10 of the Players Hand-

book).

Animate Object (Su): Dkeb can force an object

with no inherent moving parts to animate, effectively

animating it as though with the animate objects spell.

See the description of animated objects in the Monster

Manual. He can also possess (and animate) Colossal

objects.

Cloudkill Form (Su): As a full-round action,

Dkeb can assume the form of a cloud of noxious green

vapor. He is gaseous (as if he were the target of a gaseous

form spell) in this form, and anyone inside the cloud

suffers as if from a cloudkill spell (caster level 11th; save

DC 18; also see cloudkill spell description). Returning to

his solid form is a full-round action.

Control Creature (Su): Dkeb can exert direct

control over a creature he is possessing. Attempting to

establish control is a standard action. The victim must

make a Will saving throw (DC 19) each round until

Dkeb abandons the attempt, or the victim fails a saving

throw and Dkeb gains control, or the victim makes

three consecutive successful saves, indicating that Dkeb

cannot control the victim that day (though he remains in

possession of the victim). Each round of struggle, the

victim can take only a single move or attack action. Once

Dkeb gains control, he automatically maintains it for a

number of rounds equal to 9 + 1 for each previous occa-

sion on which he has controlled this host. When this

time elapses, Dkeb can attempt to reassert control or

not, as he chooses. While in control of a victim, Dkeb

has access to all the creatures abilities, skills, feats, and

spell knowledge. He now acts as though he is the crea-

ture in all respects, until he loses or relinquishes control.

Dkeb uses his own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

scores but adopts all of the possessed creatures physical

ability scores. He can make use of his own spell-like abil-

ities as well. Dkeb retains the creatures type and is

affected by spells and other effects as if he were the pos-

sessed creature except in regard to his alignment. Dkeb

can choose whether the possessed creature retains

awareness of its bodys senses and actions, in which case

it can mentally communicate with Dkeb, or whether it

simply blacks out for the duration of the control. Spells

such as dismissal and banishment are among the only

effects that can target Dkeb separately from the object or

creature he inhabits. When these spells are directed

9

against Dkeb, the spell effect is resolved as if he were in

his normal, corporeal form, using his own Hit Dice,

saving throws, ability scores, and so on. If successful,

these spells drive Dkeb out of the victim and back to his

home plane. Holy word and similar spells can also drive

Dkeb out and send him back to his home plane, but he

can hide his presence to escape the effects of such spells.

Certain other special abilities (such as the granted power

of the Exorcism prestige domain described in Defenders of

the Faith) can force Dkeb out of a victim and back into

his ethereal form.

Control Object (Su): When

possessing an object with some

inherent mobility, Dkeb can

control the objects movement.

He can cause a vehicle or simi-

lar object to move at a speed

up to 40 feet. Other moving

partssuch as a clocks

hands  or  a  cross-

bows firing mecha-

nismare under

his control. Exert-

ing control is itself

a free action, though

actually moving an

object requires

a move action.

Curse

(Su): Dkeb

can  make  a

possessed

item radiate

a  corrupt

and befoul-

ing  nature.

Anyone touch-

ing  the  object

must  make  a

Will save (DC 19)

or fall under the effect of a bestow curse spell. The

affected creature does not know that the curse came

from the item, and in fact might not know right away

that it is affected by a curse. Nothing about the objects

appearance suggests that it is possessed. The curse lasts

until it is removed, even if Dkeb vacates the object he

had possessed.

Possess Creature (Su): Dkeb can possess crea-

tures as well as objects. He must be in ethereal form and

adjacent to his target, and he must use a standard action

to attempt possession. A protection from evil spell or simi-

lar magic wards a creature against being possessed in this

manner. An unprotected target must make a Will saving

throw (DC 19). An evil creature takes a 2 penalty on

this saving throw, as does any creature that is engaged in

an evil act at the time the possession attempt occurs (at

the DMs discretion). If the saving throw is successful,

that creature is immune to Dkebs possession attempts

for one day. If the saving throw is failed, the creature is

possessed, though it is not necessarily aware of this fact.

Dkeb becomes a part of the possessed victim, so he is no

longer ethereal. He cannot be targeted by spells or

attacks separately from the victim, including attacks

from ethereal creatures. Damage taken by the possessed

creature has no effect on Dkeb. If

the victim dies, Dkeb is forced

back into his ethereal form.

He can sense anything

the victim can, even

including the ben-

efits of blindsight

or  other  excep-

tional  senses  the

victim may have. At

any time, Dkeb can

communicate  with

the victim tele-

p a t h i c a l l y,

p r o j e c t i n g

words in any

language the

victim  under-

stands  directly

into its thoughts.

Dkeb

is  con-

stantly  aware  of

the victims current

thoughts. He can also

choose to probe the crea-

tures  memories  as

well, but the victim

is allowed a Will save

(DC  19).  If  this  saving

throw is successful, Dkeb cannot probe that creatures

thoughts for one day.

Possess Noncontinuous Object (Su): Dkeb

can use his possess object ability to take control of a

loosely defined object, such as a pool of water, a cloud

of dust, or a section of wall or floor.

Possess Object (Su): While in ethereal form,

Dkeb can possess an object on the Material Plane. The

object must be at least Tiny and no larger than Huge.

Magic items and attended items receive Will saving

throws (DC 19). Unattended nonmagic items are auto-

matically possessed. Dkeb becomes part of the object he

possesses, so he is no longer ethereal. He is aware of

10

what is going on around the objecthe can see and hear

up to 60 feet away as if using his normal senses (he does

not gain blindsight). In any round in which he takes no

other  action  (such  as  using  a  spell-like  ability),  he

extends his senses to twice their normal range (120 feet).

Dkeb is vulnerable to spells that specifically affect out-

siders or creatures of his alignment (such as holy word

and holy smite, as well as chaos hammer or orders wrath)

and mind-affecting spells or effects, but he is unaffected

by physical attacks or standard magical effects (such as

fireball). Harming the object does not harm Dkeb,

although if the object is destroyed, he is forced back into

his ethereal form. While possessing an object, Dkeb can

use any ability he has that requires no physical action,

such as using a spell-like ability or telepathy.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willcontagion, dese-

crate, detect magic, dispel magic, enervation, hold monster,

magic circle against good, stinking cloud, teleport without

error (self plus maximum load of objects only), wall of

ice; 3/daycone of cold, unholy blight. Caster level 11th;

save DC 17 + spell level.

Ally or Enemy (Su): Dkeb can reward or punish a

creature he is possessing. If the possessed creature is

aware of his presence and willing to host him, Dkeb can

bestow a +4 profane bonus on any of the creatures ability

scores. This bonus lasts as long as Dkeb wants it to; he can

retract it as a free action at any time, particularly if the pos-

sessed creature starts acting contrary to his wishes. Simi-

larly, Dkeb can bestow a 4 profane penalty on any of the

possessed creatures ability scores, usually when attempts

to control the creature have failed or the creature contra-

dicts Dkebs wishes. As with the bonus, Dkeb can remove

this penalty at any time, as a free action. Bestowing either

a bonus or a penalty is a free action for Dkeb.

Amorphous (Ex): Dkeb is not subject to flank-

ing or critical hits. He is immune to poison, sleep, paral-

ysis, stunning, and polymorphing.

Command OOoze(Sp): Dkeb can control the actions

of any ooze within 60 feet as a free action. The ooze is

allowed a Will save (DC 18) to resist.

Ethereal Form (Su): At will, Dkeb can become

ethereal, as though using etherealness (caster level

19th). Possessing an object or creature effectively ends a

use of this ability, so time spent in another body or

object does not count against the duration of this ability.

Hide Presence (Ex): When Dkeb is in possession

of an object or creature, he can attempt to hide his pres-

ence by making a special Hide check. This mental Hide

check uses his Intelligence modifier instead of his Dex-

terity modifier. A successful check allows Dkeb to avoid

virtually anything that would betray his presence in the

possessed creature or object. The creature can pass

through a magic circle against evil, enter a temple warded

by forbiddance, or escape detection via detect evil. The DC

for this Hide check is the same as the saving throw DC

for the spell Dkeb is trying to avoid. He gains a +4 cir-

cumstance bonus on this check if he is not controlling

the possessed creature or object at the time of the check.

When possessing a creature, Dkeb can make this Hide

check to protect the possessed creature from the full

effects of alignment-based spells such as holy smite. If he

makes a successful Hide check against the save DC of the

spell, the possessed creature takes damage appropriate to

its actual alignment, but if he fails the Hide check, the

possessed creature is affected as if it were Dkeb. Making

this check is not an action; Dkeb can do it in response to

another creatures action (such as casting detect evil).

Magic Item (Su): Dkeb can make a possessed

weapon or armor function as a magic item. He can

bestow powers on the item with a value equivalent to an

enhancement bonus of up to +6. If the possessed item is

already magical, Dkeb can increase the powers on it by

the same amount. When he uses this power on a non-

magic item, the possessed item does not actually become

magical. Detect magic does not reveal an aura on the item,

though detect evil does. If while possessing an item Dkeb

attempts to possess a creature that uses the item or keeps

it on its person, the targets save DC increases by 1 for

each day the possessed item has been on its person or in

its use, to a maximum of +10. A character who makes a

Search check (DC 25) while examining the possessed

item can tell that there is something strange about it.

Outsider Traits: Dkeb has darkvision (60-foot

range). He cannot be raised or resurrected (though a

wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Summon TTanarri (Sp): Once per day, Dkeb may

attempt to summon 1 hezrou with a 50% chance of success.

Telepathy (Su): Dkeb can communicate tele-

pathically with any creature within 100 feet that has a

language.

Sorcerer Spells Known (6/5; save DC 13 + spell

level): 0detect magic, mage hand, ray of frost, read magic,

resistance; 1stchange self, true strike.

Possessions: Wand of fireball (caster level 8th),

dimensional shackles, amulet of the planes, helm of underwater

action, ioun stone (pale lavender ellipsoid), bead of force.

BELSHAZAR: PIT FIEND

FIEND OF POSSESSION

Belshazar is far more subtle than most of his fellow pit

fiends, but he is an expert when it comes to causing

trouble on the Material Plane. His ability to possess and

11

control objects allows him to sow mistrust and confu-

sion among good people, particularly when objects of

value disappear or turn up where they dont belong.

People begin to suspect one another of wrongdoing

and take revenge for imagined slights. All this gladdens

the fiends black heart. He takes particular delight in

dismantling any kind of order or guild based on trust,

duty, or loyalty and replacing it with one based on con-

formity and the use of force and intimidation.

Sometimes Belshazar takes a more active role by pos-

sessing the weapon of a down-and-out adventurer and

making it function as if magical. He has often posed as

an intelligent sword, talking his owner into taking

risks and engaging in behavior that he or she normally

would not consider. If they prove difficult, he cooper-

ates for a while, building up the owners reputation,

then abandoning the character at a crucial moment. The

price for the return of his favors is, of course, the crimi-

nal behavior that was previously resisted.

In addition, Belshazar can gain a great deal of infor-

mation by eavesdropping in object form. Finally, his

ability to possess objects has occasionally enabled him

to bring about the death of an inconvenient person as

an accident.

tiative,  Power  Attack,  Quicken  Spell-Like  Ability,

Sunder.

Constrict (Ex): With a successful grapple check,

Belshazar  can  crush  a  grabbed  opponent,  dealing

2d4+13 points of bludgeoning damage.

Control Object (Su): When possessing an object

with some inherent mobility, Belshazar can control the

objects movement. He can cause a vehicle or similar

object to move at a speed up to 40 feet. Other moving

partssuch as a clocks hands or a crossbows firing

mechanismare under his control. Exerting control is

itself a free action, though actually moving an object

requires a move action.

Curse (Su): Belshazar can make a possessed item

radiate a corrupt and befouling nature. Anyone touching

the object must make a Will save (DC 16) or fall under

the effect of a bestow curse spell. The affected creature

does not know that the curse came from the item, and in

fact might not know right away that it is affected by a

curse. Nothing about the objects appearance suggests

that it is possessed. The curse lasts until it is removed,

even if Belshazar vacates the object he had possessed.

Disease (Su): Even if an affected creature saves

against the poison, it must succeed at a Fortitude save

(DC 21) or be infected with a vile disease called devil

chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 points

of Strength damage).

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Belshazar can

create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is otherwise

identical with a fear spell (caster level 15th; save DC 19).

If  the  save  is  successful,  that  creature  cannot  be

affected again by Belshazars fear aura for 24 hours.

Other baatezu are immune to the aura.

Improved  Grab  (Ex): If  Belshazar  hits  a

Medium-size or smaller opponent with a tail slap

attack, he deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity (grapple bonus +27). If he gets a hold, he

can also constrict in the same round. Alternatively, he

has the option to conduct the grapple normally or

simply use his tail to hold the opponent (20 penalty

on grapple check, but Belshazar is not considered grap-

pled). In either case, each successful grapple check he

makes during successive rounds automatically deals

tail slap damage.

Poison (Ex): Belshazar delivers his poison (Forti-

tude DC 21) with each successful bite attack. The initial

damage is 1d6 points of Constitution damage; the sec-

ondary damage is death.

Possess Object (Su): While in ethereal form,

Belshazar can possess an object on the Material Plane.

The object must be at least Tiny and no larger than

Huge. A magic item or attended item receives a Will

saving throw (DC 16). Unattended nonmagic items are

automatically possessed. Belshazar becomes part of the

object he possesses, so he is no longer ethereal. He is

12

aware of what is going on around the objecthe can

see and hear up to 60 feet away as if using his normal

senses (he does not gain blindsight). In any round in

which he takes no other action (such as using a spell-

like ability), he extends his senses to twice their normal

range (120 feet). Belshazar is vulnerable to spells that

specifically affect outsiders or creatures of his align-

ment (such as holy word and holy smite, as well as chaos

hammer or orders wrath) and mind-affecting spells or

effects, but he is unaffected by physical attacks or stan-

dard magical effects (such as fireball). Harming the

object does not harm Belshazar, although if the object

is destroyed, he is forced back into his ethereal form.

While possessing an object, Belshazar can use any abil-

ity he has that requires no physical action, such as using

a spell-like ability or telepathy.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimate dead, blas-

phemy, charm person, create undead, desecrate, detect good,

detect magic, fireball, greater dispelling, hold person, improved

invisibility, magic circle against good, major image, produce

flame, polymorph self, power word blind, power word kill,

power word stun, pyrotechnics, suggestion, teleport without

error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), unholy aura,

unhallow, wall of fire; 1/daymeteor swarm. Caster level

17th; save DC 13 + spell level. 1/yearwish. Caster

level 20th.

Ethereal  Form  (Su): At  will,  Belshazar  can

become ethereal, as though using etherealness (caster

level 16th). Possessing an object or creature effectively

ends a use of this ability, so time spent in another body

or object does not count against the duration of this

ability.

Hide Presence (Ex): When Belshazar is in posses-

sion of an object or creature, he can attempt to hide his

presence by making a special Hide check. This mental

Hide check uses his Intelligence modifier instead of his

Dexterity modifier. A successful check allows Belshazar

to avoid virtually anything that would betray his pres-

ence in the possessed creature or object. The creature

can pass through a magic circle against evil, enter a temple

warded by forbiddance, or escape detection via detect evil.

The DC for this Hide check is the same as the saving

throw DC for the spell Belshazar is trying to avoid. He

gains a +4 circumstance bonus on this check if he is not

controlling the possessed creature or object at the time

of the check. When possessing a creature, Belshazar can

make this Hide check to protect the possessed creature

from the full effects of alignment-based spells such as

holy smite. If he makes a successful Hide check against

the save DC of the spell, the possessed creature takes

damage appropriate to its actual alignment, but if he

fails the Hide check, the possessed creature is affected

as if it were Belshazar. Making this check is not an

action; Belshazar can do it in response to another crea-

tures action (such as casting detect evil).

Magic Item (Su): Belshazar can make a possessed

weapon or armor function as a magic item. He can

bestow powers on the item with a value equivalent to

an enhancement bonus of up to +6. If the possessed

item is already magical, Belshazar can increase the

powers on it by the same amount. When he uses this

power on a nonmagic item, the possessed item does not

actually become magical. Detect magic does not reveal an

aura on the item, though detect evil does. A character

who makes a Search check (DC 25) while examining

the possessed item can tell that there is something

strange about it.

Outsider Traits: Belshazar has darkvision (60-

foot range). He cannot be raised or resurrected (though

a wish or miracle spell can restore life).

Regeneration (Ex): Belshazar takes normal

damage from holy and blessed weapons of at least +3

magical enhancement, and from attacks that deal holy

damage.

See in Darkness (Su): Belshazar can see per-

fectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a

deeper darkness spell.

Summon BBaatezu(Sp): Twice per day, Belshazar can

automatically summon 2 lemures, osyluths, or barbezu,

or 1 erinyes, cornugon, or gelugon.

Telepathy (Su): Belshazar can communicate tele-

pathically with any other creature within 100 feet that

has a language.

Possessions: Bracers  of  armor  +5,  belt  of  giant

strength +4, maul of the titans, cloak of resistance +3, ring of

protection +1.
