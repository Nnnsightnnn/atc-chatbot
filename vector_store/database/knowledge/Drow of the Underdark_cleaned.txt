Introduction

To survive in the wilds of the Underdark, one must not delay when

the Spider Queen bestows her gifts. For with even the slightest hesi-

tation, the briefest moment of doubt, the Flesh-Carver will snatch

back her blessing, depriving her chosen of the wonders of her favor.

This was a fact not lost on Vorn.

He spent an entire century of his life looking for such chances, waiting

for the moment that would propel him toward his destiny, to advance his

status and free him from the drudgery of being a lowly common soldier.

Thus far, Lolth had been silentto him at least. He

had watched others rise to take their place as fangs

or consorts, while he languished as a foot

soldier, little better than a thug.

Now, of course, was not the time

for  such  idle  thoughts,  but

it  was  hard  to  rein  in  the

mind after spending eight

hours crouched in a dank

cavern. He and a dozen

other  drow  soldiers  hid

in positions throughout a

large gallery in the depths

of  the  shadows,  behind

draperies and stalagmites,

waiting and watching for

the  rst sign of their prey.

And  then  it  came.  Light

shone forth from the mouth

of  the  cavern,  piercing  the

perfect  blackness  and  plung-

ing Vorns vision into swollen,

shifting  spots.  Vorn  had  known

it would happen, had tried to ready

himself, but he was not prepared for its inten-

sity.  He  shook  his  head,  rubbing  the  palms

of his hands into his eyes to clear his sight,

but  even  when  the  blindness  abated  he

found it hard to focus. Through the

painful  glow,  he  looked  for  his

commander,  waiting  for  the

gesture  to  attack.  Soon.  It

would be very soon.

The  intruders  fear  was

obvious, naked on their pale

faces. They were of all shapes

and sizes: a dwarf, some small

 gure that resembled a hal-

 ing, what Vorn guessed

was a human, and an elf

maiden.  The  interlop-

ers  fanned  out  from  the

entrance,  their  weapons

drawn,  casting  about  for

the  signs  of  the  enemies

they  had  to  suspect  were

near.

A tense moment passed. And then, like fools, they relaxed. The

dwarf  uttered  something.  The  intruders  laughed,  their  vigilance

dropping.

Vorns  commander  made  a  sharp  movement  with  his  hands

accompanied by a quick lift of his shoulders. The signal. The time

was now.

Globes of darkness quenched the light. Ghostly  ames of  ickering

reds and violets limned the forms of the surface dwellers. Crossbow

bolts, laden with potent toxins, slashed through the air, and the cries

of pain revealed the accuracy of the drow archers. Vorn aimed his

hand crossbow, when he realized that his chance, his one opportu-

nity, stood before him.

His  commander

had  his  back  to

him,  watching

the combat unfold.

Always careless, this

commander.

To  survive  in  the

Underdark, one must not

delay. . . . Vorn  red the bolt, know-

ing  that  the  poison  would  make

short  work  of  the  of cer.  With  one

smooth  motion,  he  crossed  the

gap, pulling his sword from its

sheath, to  nish the job.

Such are the ways of

the drow.

Bards  sing  of  bold

heroes  who  brave  the

depths of the earth, who plun-

der  the  vaults  of  ancient

peoples, exploring and map-

ping  the  endless  passages

and  corridors  that  hon-

eycomb  the  Underdark.

Although much of this light-

less world is empty and devoid

of life, it contains terrifying mon-

sters, sprawling alien civilizations,

swathes of molds, oozes, slimes, and

countless  other  hazards.

But no threat the Under-

dark  conjures  compares

to the drow. Their name

is  a  curse,  their  pres-

ence  a  cancer.  They  are

the despised, the exiled,

the  shunnedand  yet

they  are  powerful,  and

conquer  nearly  all  who

come  before  them.  They

are the dark elves, cursed

by  Corellon  Larethian,

condemned  to  spend  their

days languishing in their own

corruption.

use,  since  it  reveal  important  details  about  the  drowhow

they think, what they do, why they do it, and so forth. More

important, it portrays the Spider Queen as an active force for

evil, and her priestesses as a terrible threat to the world. This

book  positively  brims  with  adventure  possibilitiessparks

of inspiration that will provide all you need to tell your own

tales of the Underdark.

SWIFT AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

Miniatures Handbook introduced the concept of a new action

type:  the  swift  action.  Likewise,  Expanded  Psionics  Handbook

introduced  another  new  action  type:  the  immediate  action.

Some of the class features, feats, and spells described in Drow

of the Underdark use these concepts. A description of how they

work follows.

Swift Actions: A swift action consumes a very small amount

of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn

without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that

regard,  a  swift  action  is  like  a  free  action.  However,  you  can

perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what

other actions you take.

You  can  take  a  swift  action  any  time  you  would  normally

be  allowed  to  take  a  free  action.  Since  swift  actions  usually

involve magic or psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic

items, many characters (especially those who dont use magic

or  psionics)  will  never  have  the  opportunity  to  take  a  swift

action.

Casting a quickened spell, or manifesting a quickened psionic

power, is a swift action. In addition, casting any spell or mani-

festing any power with a casting time or manifesting time of

1 swift action is a swift action. Casting a spell or manifesting a

power with a casting time or manifesting time of 1 swift action

does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Immediate Actions: Much like a swift action, an immediate

action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a

larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. Unlike

a swift action, an immediate action can be performed ay any

timeeven if its not your turn.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a

swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. If you

do use an immediate action in this way, you cannot use another

immediate action until your next turn (effectively, using an im-

mediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift

action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate

action if you are currently flat-footed.

Under these rules, casting a feather fall spell is an immediate

action (not a free action, as stated in the spell description in

the Players Handbook).

Magic Items and Potions: Activating a spell completion item,

activating a spell trigger item, or drinking a potion is a standard

action, even if the spell with which the scroll, potion, or item is

made can be cast as a swift action.

FOR PLAYERS

The drow might be an evil raceand one that is permanently

at odds with other racesbut many players are nonetheless

attracted to playing drow characters. Drow of the Underdark

discusses  the  underpinnings  of  drow  societies  and  beliefs,

their Lolth-dominated religion, and an example of an arche-

typal drow cityall of which is vital information to players

of drow characters. This material enables a player to  esh out

his characters history, as well as providing guidance for con-

ceptualizing personalities, goals, and mannerisms.

For  players  of  other  races,  Drow  of  the  Underdark  can  be

equally  effective  as  a  reference  for  enemies  of  the  drow.

The  study  of  drow  society  included  in  this  book  not  only

tells you how the drow operate, but why they do what they

doand  the  best  way  to  defeat  a  foe  is  to  understand  that

foes motivations.

New uses for skills, guidelines for creating new poisons and

magical poisons, an expanded description of Drow Sign Lan-

guage, and rules for training vermin all support the cultural

considerations.  Over  50  new  feats  help  de ne  the   ghting

techniques of this unusual race: Several new style feats are

included, as well as a number of general and metamagic feats

that  improve  drow  racial  talents  but  are  equally  useful  for

characters of any race.

As with any new game element, you should always consult

your DM before you start using this material. The viability

of these gameplay options depends on the role the drow will

play in your DMs campaign, and by discussing your choices

ahead of time, you give your DM the chance to help  t the

character into her game.

he drow are a paradox among the races of the DUN-

GEONS & DRAGONS game. They are elves, but dark and

cruel.  They  are  infamous,  known  far  and  wide  by

players and characters alike, yet they are mysterious

and subtle beings. Because everyone knows of the

drow, they assume they understand the drow.

They could not be more wrong.

For all their infamy, for all their prominence as the most

insidious of D&D villains, the drow remain largely unknown.

Those who would claim to understand them and their ways

have  been  misled  by  the  foolish  myths  and  deliberate  pro-

paganda of surface elves, by incomplete tales brought back

by delving adventurers, or by cultural treatises speci c to a

particular world or setting, but not to the drow nation as a

whole. Come, now, and see for the  rst time who the drow

are, how they truly liveand why the surface-dwellers, grown

complacent in their false and incomplete knowledge, would

do well to fear them once more.

A DAY IN THE LIFE

The great stone bells chime from atop the enormous temple of

the Spider Queen, signaling the start of yet another rite. Drawn

from  her  trance  by  the  reverberating  sound,  Velthura  Vae

stretches once, luxuriating in the feel of the spidersilk sheets.

Then she rises, padding barefoot to her windowactually

a crystalline mirror, enchanted to provide her a clear view of

Yvoth-Leneds market without allowing prying eyes to spy

upon her in return. Her lip curls in disdain as she gazes upon

the bustle of the darkened streets below, the echoing sounds

of shopkeepers and slave traders both cheating and being

cheated by their clients. It is a scene of controlled chaos,

and it disgusts her even as it calls her to rule it with blooded

teeth and an iron  st. They are  ies, she muses, not for the

 rst time. They are  ies, when they should be spiders.

She turns away, to face instead the shrine carved into

the far wall. With lifelike precisionand possibly life-

like color, though she has never allowed any light within

the room to make surea stone image of a great spider

returns her gaze, its front legs extended from the wall,

its face that of a beautiful drow. She kneels before the

icon of Lolth, the stone  oor cold and painful on her

bare knees. Head bowed, she raises her hands, inter-

twining her  ngers with the spiders legs. Queen of

Spiders, Weaver of Webs, she intones in a rite she has

performed every morning, without fail, for more years

than a human lifetime. I offer to you all my efforts

and all my triumphs of the day to come. She does

not ask for Lolths blessing, or the goddesss aid; she

knows better.

Her chamber door opens, revealing a bevy of servants

led by Ashirza, her personal maid. She has no need to

summon them; they all know the time their mistress

rises, and they know too the penalties for tardiness.

7

95726720_Ch01.indd   7

2/22/07   3:01:17 PM

With  the  door  guarded  by  loyal  bugbear  sentinel-slaves

and several male drow servants making the bed, she allows

her maid to approach. At this very moment, she is at her most

vulnerable, for she turns her attention inward, suppressing

her bodys innate resistance to the outside energies that other

races call magic. She and the rest of the drow know better:

She understands that those mystical energies are just another

element of the gods will in the world of mortals. Watching

from the corner of her eye, alert for any sign of betrayal, she

shivers once as Ashirzas cantrips ripple across her skin, cleans-

ing her of nighttime sweat and dirt, untangling her ivory-white

hair. She nods once, satis ed with the result, and raises her

arms for her servants to clothe her in the black leathers and

gossamer silks of her rank and station.

She swiftly descends the many stairs of her tall and narrow

home,  nding a table already laid out with a breakfast of mush-

rooms and lizard eggs. Under the respectful and nervous gaze

of the cook, she whispers a brief spell in Lolths name. The

drow are connoisseurs of poison, and though they rarely use

poison against one anotherprecisely because such efforts

are often anticipatedone can never afford to become com-

placent. That was, after all, how she earned her current station,

and her current home, from their former owner.

The food proves poison-free, and the cook retreats in relief.

He knows full well that had the food been tainted, or simply

not to his mistresss pleasure, being  ayed alive would be the

best he might hope for.

Normally she would sit back and relax, eating slowly and

indulging in the excellent fare, but today promises to be full

indeed. She eats swiftly, snatches up a decanter of lichen wine

to sip throughout the day, and departs.

Her  rst errand is to the bustling bazaar at the center of the

city, with the temple of Lolth looming above. On any other day,

her servants would handle such menial tasks for her, keeping

the larder stocked. Tomorrow, however, she hosts the elders

of  her  house,  traveled  all  the  way  from  Erelhei-Cinlu,  and

that is far too vital a gathering to leave in the hands of mere

servants. She must go herself, select only the freshest fungi,

the choicest cuts of roth, andof coursethe spider-meats

for the ceremonial joining of the meal.

She pushes her way through the crowded market, her maid

and bugbear guards in tow. Most of the drow recognize her

status, by her garb and posture if not her face, and clear a path.

The members of other races, slaves of the drow, or the rare

foreign  traders  are  less  cooperative.  She  and  her  entourage

literally run down a kobold slave who fails to step aside swiftly

enough, and once she is forced to order her guards to subdue

a hobgoblin who refuses to yield the way. Irritated by these

interruptions, she  ows through the market like a wind, sip-

ping from her lichen wine, pointing out this item or that to be

delivered back to her home or carried by her servants.

The attack, when it comes, is almost too simplistic to be

believed.  A  ragged  drow  with   lthy  hair  lunges  from  the

crowd,  st clenched tight around a wicked dagger. With con-

temptuous ease, she swats aside the attack and utters a spell.

The air thunders and the drow falls writhing to the ground,

blood spilling from his ears, his innate resistance crumpled

like paper before her power.

She waves off her bodyguards, reminding herself to have

them maimed for their failure to act, and kneels beside the

would-be  assassin.  She  wonders  brie y  which  of  her  many

enemies could have sent him. That they would try to kill her

is no surprise, but that any would do so in such a pathetic

manner is shocking. No chance to question him now, for her

spell has deafened him. She decides to have him sent back to

her home, where he can be interrogated at leisure. She rises,

and continues through a crowd that has not reacted at all to

the sudden violence in its midst.

The incident, feeble as it was, has thrown off her schedule.

Angrily threateningand even, once or twice, whipping

shopkeepers  who  move  too  slowly,  she  rushes  through  the

remainder  of  her  purchases.  By  the  time  she  reaches  the

Amphitheater, the opening ceremonies have already concluded

with the sacri ce of a captured surface elf upon the altar of

Lolth. As the  rst of the games beginsgiant lizard races,

on which she herself has two hefty wagersshe slips into a

private booth, leaving Ashirza and her bodyguards outside.

You are late, the rooms other occupant remarks, reclining

on a silk-covered divan.

She swallows her bile and hatred of the other female. I

am here now, Reverend Mother Dultha, she replies, hoping

the use of the full honori c will smooth over any irritation

without the humiliation of apology or excuse.

So you are. And how go your preparations for the feast?

Well enough. They would go better, of course, if I knew

how many of my family would be in attendance.

The  Reverend  Mother  of  Lolth,  and  Matron  of  House

Inlindl, smiles an ugly, tooth- lled smile. My servants in the

passage to Erelhei-Cinlu tell me you should expect one fewer

than you were told.

She  cannot  help  but  smile  in  return.  After  her  cousins

accidental death on the long journey, none of her relatives

has the power to challenge her claim to the title of matron of

the houses families here in Yvoth-Lened.

The Reverend Mothers expression darkens. And your end

of our agreement?

She nods. I have Shenthrals wretched half-breed in the care

of my guards. At the moment of the wedding, I will reveal the

child for all to see. Shenthral will be shamed, and her alliance

with House Eilservs will fail before it begins.

For a time they drink together, watching the games through the

shuttered window, watching each other through narrowed eyes.

Finally, her triumphant mood only lightly dampened by her loss

of both slaves on the lizard-race wagers, she rises, nods politely to

her drinking companion, and sweeps through the door. Already

she is plotting the death of the Reverend Mother, who is far too

cunning and knows too much. But this, alas, must wait until she

has consolidated her own power in Yvoth-Lened.

She has hours yet before the rejuvenating comfort of trance

will call to her once more, and in that time she must oversee the

bustling scurry of dozens of servants throughout her house.

The  days  purchases  must  be  delivered,  checked,  prepared,

and stored; the doors and windows checked time and again

for both mystical and mundane security; the errant bugbear

bodyguards branded and blinded for their poor performance;

and a dozen other niggling details made utterly perfect before

the family arrives the following day. She

barely takes a moment to eat, though

even  in  the  chaos  she  does  not

forget  to  check  the  food  once

more  for  poison.  She  has

already survived one attack

today,  incompetent  as  it

was; it would be humiliat-

ing to fall to another.

It  is  only  when  she

has  shed  her  clothes,

cleansed herself of the

dust  and  sweat  of  the

day, and lain down for a

nights trance, that she

feels  the   rst  burning

in  her  stomach,  the   rst

swelling  of  her  throat,

the   rst  tightening  of

muscles  that  signify

the  onset  of  a  poison.

For  even  with  all  her

paranoia,  all  her  safe-

guards, she has indeed

become  complacent.

She checked her break-

fast  when  she  awoke,

the drink served by the Rev-

erend  Mother,  her  dinner

before she retired . . . but she

never  thought  to  consider  that

the decanter of lichen wine from

which she had sipped all day had been tainted by her own maid

Ashirza, who slipped poison into the  beverageand also a

potion that postponed the onset of the poisonduring the dis-

traction of the staged assassination attempt in the market.

Tomorrow,  when  the  powerful  members  of  the  family

arrive, it will be Ashirza who greets them. Velthura Vae will

not rise again.

SOCIETY AND CULTURE

It is one of the aforementioned paradoxes of the drow that their

culture, while encouraging sel sh ambition and advancement

through  deception  and  murder,  is  still  one  that  focuses

almost in spite of itselfon the good of the community over

the good of the individual. Drow society, as a whole, lacks any

concept of personal worth. An individuals abilities or accom-

plishments are not, in and of themselves, of any importance

whatsoever. The culture does not reward skill for skills sake,

or celebrate individual success or ability. Its not that the drow

choose to downplay these factors; rather, they literally have

no notion that they should matter. It is as foreign an idea to

them as judging a persons worth based on shoe size would be

to most surface-dwelling races.

The only true measure of importance in drow society is

how  thoroughly  and  effectively  an  individual  can  direct,

shape, and change that societyin other words, by how much

authority an individual has over other

drow and the communitys needed

resources.  Although  personal

ability and accomplishment,

or  birth  into  a  powerful

bloodline,  often  leads

to such control, it is

the in uence itself

that  determines  a

drows  station  and

status.

Like  many  other

sentient  beings,  the

drow  think  in  terms

of  dichotomies:  If

something is not good,

it  must  be  bad;  if  it  is

not  strong,  it  must

be  weak.  Thus,  if  a

drow  with  authority

over  others  is  worth-

while,  a  drow  with

little  or  no  authority

is  worthless.  When

nothing  but  status

and  in uence  deter-

mine individual value,

and  life  itself  is  of  no

intrinsic  worth,  a  weak

drow is nothing but a commod-

ity  to  be  traded,  abused,  and

eventually exhausted by those

more powerful. Enslavement, torture, and even murder are

not crimes, when the perpetrator is a drow of high stature and

the victim is not. Drow do avoid randomly slaughtering others

who offend them, but this is due to a concern that they might

accidentally slay the relative, servant, or slave of someone more

powerful, not out of any sense of the value of life.

This core belief in power has developed the drow culture

as it exists today: a society in which every interaction is deter-

mined by a dominant/submissive hierarchy. A drow divides

everyonedrow or otherwiseinto only three categories:

someone with more power, who must be appeased and pla-

cated (at least until she can be replaced); someone who is a

useful tool to ones own advancement, who must be exploited

in all possible ways; and the weak, who are worthless except

as labor or disposable troops. From a general giving orders

to her soldiers to a shopkeeper bargaining with a customer,

everything is about who holds the most power. Haggling, for

instance, is all but unheard of. If a client is of higher station

than a vendor, she pays what she chooses; if she is lower, she

pays  what  the  vendor  demands  or  receives  no  goods.  Only

when it comes to trade with non-drow is bargaining an option,

and even then vendors must take care, for fear of accidentally

offending the slave of a powerful drow. A drow who refuses

the orders of one with more power has earned whatever tor-

tures that act brings down upon her, and can expect no pity

or aid from by others.

Poisoning is a popular means of advancement among the drow

The  drow  are  experts  in  the  application  of  pain  and

death;  they  are  considered  cruel  by  other  races.  This,  too,

is  an  outward  sign  of  the  beliefs  at  the  heart  of  their  cul-

tural development. Pain caused to a superior or a rival is a

necessary means to an end; pain caused to a subordinate is

unimportant because the subordinate is unimportant. The

drow are cruel, in part, because they literally see no differ-

ence  between  torturing  an  underling,  whipping  a  horse,

or even repairing an old garden tool. It cannot be stressed

enough that societal authority is the only measure of worth

the drow understand.

These  philosophical  underpinnings  result  in  a  culture

of  constant  scheming,  in  which  every  member  of  a  com-

munity is perpetually conspiring to gain greater power over

her neighbors while struggling to keep others from gaining

power over her. Paranoia is rampant, with every word and

deed carefully examined to ensure that it does not contain

a hidden danger. Although visitors certainly expect to  nd

back-room  deals  and  constant  betrayals  among  the  ruling

castes of the drow, such as the priestesses of Lolth and the

matriarchs of the great houses, they are often surprised to

 nd them equally as prevalent among less powerful drow. A

shopkeeper conspires to destroy a rivals supply of goods, or

frame him for some offense against Lolth. A soldier weakens

another soldiers armor with carefully applied acid, hoping

that  her  death  in  battle  will  open  a  path  to  promotion.  A

favored servant conspires with slaves to poison the mistress

of the house so that she can take over, only to later poison the

slaves as well rather than provide the freedom she had prom-

ised. When every interaction is a challenge for dominance,

no drow can afford to drop her guard or cease her constant

plotting to get ahead.

Roleplaying Application: React to others based primarily

on their perceived value to you. Your adventuring companions

are vital to your survival, so you wont want to alienate them.

In other cases, though, react with anger when someone you

perceive as inferior disagrees with or disobeys you. Judge all

individuals by how much power they wield, and offer them

respect accordingly. You do not revere life for its own sake,

and are puzzled by those who speak about the inherent value

or dignity of living beings. This doesnt make you a wanton

murderer; it simply means that you have no compunctions

about killing if doing so is the most expedient or convenient

means of handling a situation (and you feel you can get away

with it with minimal repercussions).

LAW, TRADITION, AND

GOVERNMENT

Perhaps one of the strangest dichotomies of drow culture is that

they are both heavily tradition-bound and highly innovative, a

bizarre combination found rarely among the other races.

Drow innovation is, as with so much else in their lives, driven

by the constant drive to achieve dominance over other drow.

A creative battle plan, a brand-new spell, a shorter method of

production for manufactured goodsnone of these have any

value to the drow in and of themselves. Creation for creations

sake  is  yet  another  virtue  foreign  to  their  way  of  thinking.

When such innovations are put to use to increase the creators

station, however, then they have proven their worth.

Thus, the very same traditions that keep the drow at one

anothers throats also encourage innovative thinking. The most

powerful drow have lived for centuries, and as a race they have

been competing with one another for millennia. They are far

too wary, and too well prepared, for traditional schemes to work

against them. A drow who seeks to get ahead must be creative

in her approachand they all seek to get ahead.

These traditions, although binding, are rarely codi ed into

law. The drow are an innately chaotic people, both in terms

of individual temperament and religious doctrine. They bow

to tradition due to social pressure and the efforts of those in

power, but they react poorly to formalization of those tradi-

tions. Most of these conventions, as they apply to governance,

religion, gender roles, and other cultural mores, are discussed

in the following sections.

The lack of formal codes of law in drow society also equates

to a lack of formal law enforcement. A drow community has no

watch or police force per se. Rather, each aspect or segment of

the community is responsible for enforcing its own power as

far as its authority extends. An offense against a major house

is answered by members of that house. The Church of Lolth

punishes those who transgress against the Queen of Spiders

and her faith. Individual drow react to slights and offenses

as their own abilities and status permit. If a lone drow or an

institution lacks the capacity to strike back against someone

who has wronged her or it, then that individual or institu-

tion is clearly not entitled to retributionand that failure to

retaliate might mark the wronged party as weak enough to

be overthrown by rivals.

On rare occasions, a drow institution might request the aid

of another organization in seeking justice or vengeance against

an adversary. A priestess might ask that one of the houses send

soldiers to deal with a troublemaker, rather than making use

DROW ALIGNMENT

The drow are a highly chaotic, individualistic people, a fact ad-

dressed multiple times throughout this chapter. They worship

a deity who dwells in the Abyss and is a paragon of chaotic evil.

Yet for all that, the Monster Manual gives drow alignment as

usually neutral evil.

The truth is, the drow are at least somewhat cooperative with

one another, almost in spite of their own nature. Their ambitions

and desires require that their society remain at least somewhat

stable. They employ few true laws, but they are tightly bound

by traditions and codes, and even if they follow them primarily

out of fear, they follow them nonetheless. It is ironic that a lone

drow is likely to drift toward chaos, but that despite their rivalry

with one another, the presence of multiple drow in a given com-

munity literally forces them into a level of cooperation beyond

what truly chaotic individuals would maintain.

wherein a powerful drow in a community requests that the

priesthood punish a wrongdoer. Such temporary agreements

normally occur when an individual wishes to keep her own

faction out of direct involvement in a con ict. For instance,

if a member of House Eilservs insults or attacks a member of

House Inlindl, and Inlindl responds in kind, the result could

be a feud that envelops both houses in protracted con ict. If

Inlindl wishes to avoid that resultlikely, since it holds far

less power than Eilservsit might instead request that the

Church of Lolth punish the transgressor. Doing so, of course,

puts the house in debt to the priestesses, so it would take such

an action only if the offense was dire.

Drow punishment, regardless of whose hands deliver the

sentence, is brutal and ef cient. In some instances, the punish-

ing force simply strips the transgressor of power and property.

More frequently, the individual becomes a bound slave to the

house or church. Torture and execution are common as well.

Priestesses and house matriarchs hold great power over other drow

just so long as they have the might to enforce it

The drow do not believe in imprisonment as a punishment in

and of itself, nor do they believe in second chances.

Roleplaying Application: You  nd the notion of a com-

munitywide police force or city guard a foreign one, as well

as the notion that certain activities are illegal. You think in

terms of whether a particular individual has the power to seek

vengeance if you wrong him, and you often forget (at least at

 rst) that a community itself might seek to punish you for

transgressions against a speci c person.

Drow Government and Rule

To say that the drow are governed by a matriarchal theocracy

is both accurate and misleading. It is certainly true that the

ruling members of drow society are the priestesses of Lolth

and the matrons (and other matriarchs of the great houses),

but calling them a government is a misnomer. Just as the

drow are guided by tradition but have no formal law, they are

overseen by these in uential personages but have no formal

government. A drow city has no duchess, reeve, or mayor; a

drow nation has no empress or queen.

A drow community is governed, so to speak, through the

unsteady cooperation of its three most powerful institutions.

The Church of Lolth is the most in uential faction among the

drow. The priestesses of this church interpret and dissemi-

nate the will of Lolth, conduct rites and rituals to honor the

dark goddess, and technically have the authority to demand

anything in her name. If the drow were to have a formal

government, it would be made up of these individuals.

On a practical level, however, although the priestesses

are indeed the social leaders of the drow, the church

often  lacks  the  power  to  take  drastic  action  without

the support of the great houses. Powerful matriarchs

frequently  hold  power  in  both  the  church  and  a

housethus, what is self-interest for one must often

be  self-interest  for  the  other.  It  is  also  important  to

understand that the church is not a monolithic entity,

guided by a single voice or a single goal. It is made up of

individual priestesses, all of whom are loyal to Lolth, but

all of whom have the same drive to dominate the weak and

advance their own cause as any other drow. Thus, although a

drow priestess can bring substantial might to bear against a

lone individual or small family who offends her, she cannot

muster the resources of the church against an entire house,

unless  the  house  has  blatantly  and  conspicuously  turned

against Lolth as a whole.

The houses of the drow hold the bulk of the communitys

economic and military power in their hands. In some commu-

nities, a speci c house might be a greater power even than the

priestesses of Lolth, directing the activities of religious leaders

with behind-the-scenes threats or open shows of force. The

high priestess of a community might also be a highly ranked

matriarch of a great house, using one to advance the schemes

of the other. No single house has ever managed to rise to domi-

nance across multiple drow cities, however, and few maintain

a permanent position of authority even in individual com-

munities. Each house is tied to the other houses in a complex

web of treaties and con icts, alliances and betrayals. Should

one house become too powerful, others ally to bring it down

(even while appearing, on the surface, to support them, playing

both sides against the middle). Further, although the church

usually lacks the power to single-handedly destroy a house,

neither can a house afford to make an enemy of the church.

Too  much  of  the  power  in  a  community  is  held  by  Lolths

priestesses, and a house that fails to work with those priest-

esses loses access to those channels of in uence. Although

such an occurrence is rare, the church can decree that a house

has earned the disfavor of Lolth, essentially giving all other

houses blanket permission and encouragement to openly turn

against it. Some houses are strong enough to withstand even

this sort of assault, which invariably leads to a dilution of the

churchs position in the community. But more often, such a

decree results in the house being weakened suf ciently for

another to rise and take its place. When one adds to this already

volatile mix the constant scheming of house members against

one another, in the hope of gaining higher status within the

house, its quite understandable that no single house has ever

managed to hold widespread power for long.

The military is the  nal drow institution that, in some com-

munities, could be a governing body. Drow communities do not

have standing armies, since this would require a formal gov-

ernment. Multiple smaller forces make up the larger soldiery

of a drow city. These consist primarily of house-loyal militias,

church soldiers, and independent mercenary companies. For

the most part, then, the military is simply the enforcement

arm of a house or the church. In some rare instances, how-

everparticularly in communities engaged in a constant war

with a hostile powerthe military takes on an authority of its

own. Its generals, under the guise of protecting the commu-

nity, usurp authority from the matriarchs who normally hold

it. The house soldiers become the dominant members of the

house, or at least carry suf cient authority that the matriarchs

and matrons cannot ignore their input. The army might even

come to guide the Church of Lolth, directing priestesses in the

defense of the city and in attacks on the enemy. The generals

of differing factions, such as rival houses or a house and the

church,  have  been  known  to  cooperate  behind  the  scenes,

arti cially extending or even creating military crises to wrest

supremacy from the houses and the priesthood.

It is worth noting that rank in a military unit is the only

pathway male drow have to any position of authority, so they

are  the  military  of cers  most  likely  to  attempt  this  sort  of

power grab.

For more information on the priestesses of Lolth, see the

Religion section; for more on the great houses, see Houses of

the Drow; and for more on the military, see the War header

under Drow Life, all below.

Roleplaying  Application:  You  assume  that,  with  the

exception of military rank, females hold all true positions of

authority. When addressing a mixed group of nobles, priests,

or similar powerful individuals, you instinctively direct your

words and attention to any females present, and you are always

startled when a social or political leader turns out to be male.

You normally assume that any military force is, if not indepen-

dent, loyal to a church or a bloodline; youre certainly aware

that other cultures have armies devoted to cities or nations,

but it still strikes you as odd when you encounter it.

Gender Roles

The  supremacy  of  the  female  is  deeply  ingrained  in  drow

culture. Females are seen as stronger, smarter, and more emo-

tionally controlled than males, andabove allholier and

more devoted to Lolth. Males, on the other hand, are viewed

as  spiritually,  intellectually,  and  physically  inferior,  useful

primarily for physical and skilled labor and breeding purposes.

A male drow is seen as superior to a member of any other race,

but inferior even to female drow of lower status.

This attitude comes from a variety of separate but related

sources. The  rst and most obvious is Lolth herself. The god-

dess  has,  over  the  course  of  drow  mythology  and  history,

taken multiple consorts, all of whom have been eventually

discarded.  Whether  this  is  the  cause  of  Lolths  opinion  of

males or a symptom of it, Lolth believes that only females are

worthwhile servants.

Much like the spiders they revere, drow females also hold

power due to biological reasons. In many spider species, the

females are far larger and stronger, and males often do not

survive the mating process. Drow childbirth is a physically

strenuous occasion (see the Pregnancy, Birth, and Childhood

sidebar, page 24), and though the drow feel little if any affection

for their young, they understand the importance of continu-

ing the family and house lines. Thus, the females, who are

both essential to reproduction and capable of withstanding

it, are clearly both stronger and more blessed than the males.

Whether the drow think as they do because of their emulation

of spiders is unclear and ultimately unimportant.

Finally and perhaps most important, females are already

ascendant  within  drow  society.  Matriarchs  and  priestesses

have enough trouble clinging to power in the face of other

ambitious females; the last thing they want is to double the

pool of potential rivals. Thus, the tradition of female domi-

nance continues, in large part, at the behest of the females

who are already dominant.

Male drow hold little if any power, but not all of them are

mere property, even if many females see them as such. Some

of the most skilled crafters, warriors, and arcane casters among

the drow are male. In fact, the submissive status of males in

drow society actually inspires many of them to excel. Male

drow can lay claim to little authority, and they are constantly

at risk of being discarded by their female leaders, so only those

with skills and abilities that are not easily replaceable can be

relatively con dent of their positions.

Denied the right to formally in uence society, male drow

have  become  masters  of   nding  subtle  and  nontraditional

roads  to  power.  Many  become  teachers  of  arcane  magic  or

military strategy, attempting to form strong bonds with their

studentsparticularly  the  females  who  might  well  hold

power in the next generation. Others join the soldiers of a

powerful house or the priestesses of Lolth, working their way

up in the ranks. At the very least, these positions grant them

some measure of authority, and if they are fortunate enough

to be of cers during wartime (or devious enough to start a

well-timed war), that authority can grow to rival that of some

matriarchs. And of course, some drow males attempt to seduce

powerful females, using lustand even the rare emotion of

loveto in uence drow leaders behind the scenes.

In the lower echelons of drow society, away from the movers

and shakers, males and females hold similar roles. A member

of either gender might be a household servant, a shopkeeper, a

soldier, or an artist. The males tend more toward physical labor

and the females toward skilled craftsnot because females

are weaker, but because they often have more opportunities

to choose their own path than males dobut this is only a

tendency, not a societal constant.

DROW PSYCHOLOGY

The drow are, to the last, a motivated and driven race. The

perception that a drows individual worth is determined only

by the in uence she wields over society isnt simply a cultural

attitude; its a psychological one as well. A drow who holds no

power is a failure in her own eyes, and this more than anything

else drives her behavior. It is thus not merely external pres-

sures that cause the drow to plot and scheme; it is an ingrained

need that borders on instinct.

For the most part, drow are driven by a trinity of emotions

that exist, to varying degrees, in every member of the race.

Pride: So far as each drow is concerned, she is a superior

Long-Term Planning

Drow have a shorter average life span than surface elves

due primarily to violence, rather than any innate biological

causebut they still live far longer than most other humanoid

races. Thus, the drow often take a longer view of the world

than humans or others. This attitude is manifested in drow

plots and schemes, which often take decades or even centu-

ries to unfold.

Whereas this long-term view of life manifests in surface

elves as a seeming unwillingness to make decisions quickly

or to understand urgency, the drow are just as busy and active

as anyone else. Rather than acting slowly

because  they  have  more  time,  drow

prefer  to  squeeze  as  much

out of their extra years as

possible. Where a sur-

face  elf  might  take

ten  times  as  long

as  a  human  on

a given task,

specimen of a superior raceor at least she should be.

Drow who obtain power do so because they are worthy

of it; those who lack authority  nd themselves resent-

fully  cha ng  under  the  rule  of  others,  their  pride

demanding that they blame everyone else for their fail-

ure. A drow never forgets either a victory or a slight.

Anger: Closely intertwined with their pride is a cur-

rent of rage that runs through the entire drow

population. They are a primal and instinctive

people, quick to lash out at those who offend

them.  A  drow  grows  wroth  at  a  subordinate

who fails or de es her, a superior for holding the

power she herself craves, a foreigner for failing

to offer unquestioned submission to the drow,

an ally for imagined future betrayal, and even

herself for not having accomplished more than

she already has. Drow are quick to resort to

violence, and revenge is one of their most

potent motivators.

Fear: They are not often aware of it, and

would be insulted if someone else were to

suggest  it,  but  the  drow  live  every  day  of

their lives in mortal terror. They fear their

masters and priestesses, they fear the treachery

of underlings, they fear displeasing their deity,

they fear losing power and falling into disgrace.

This fear engenders the paranoia and distrust that

keep the drow from growing close, and the secrecy in

which they orchestrate their schemes. For all their cru-

elty, all their power, the drow are bitterly fearful creatures,

always afraid to lose what they have, yet driven to risk it all

for just a little bit more.

Everything  the  drow  do  stems  from  the  interactions

between these three emotions, bolstered by societal pressures.

Even their fanatical devotion to Lolth is based on fear: fear of

invoking the goddesss anger should they abandon her, and fear

of being cast adrift in the world without divine guidance.

Despite their chaotic nature, the drow are

to ensure he gets it right, a drow instead works at a feverish

pace, but might undertake ten tasks at once. This hurry up

and wait mentalityrushing through numerous plans that

might not come to fruition for years or longeronly adds to

the highly emotional and easily frustrated nature of the drow

psyche, but it also ensures that if one plan collapses, a wise

drow has half a dozen more to  ll in the gap.

All  drow  are  schemers,  but  not  all  drow  are  effective

schemers. Laying out a multiyear plot, having the foresight to

anticipate  relevant

changes in the polit-

ical landscape, and

remaining  patient

that  many  drow

sorely  lack.  If  a

drow  bursts  into  a

rage at an inoppor-

tune  moment,  or

fails  to  anticipate

the  machinations

of  her  rivals,  years

of planning can be

swept  aside  in  an

instant.

They have no ability to treat another person as an equal. Every

communication between two or more people, regardless of its

purpose, falls into a dominant and submissive pattern.

Unless a drow has reason to believe otherwise, she always

assumes that she is the dominant individual in a discussion,

and grows irritated if others do not behave accordingly. If she

is speaking to someone who clearly holds higher status, she

accepts the fact that she is, instead, in a submissive position,

but instantly begins considering ways to eventually gain the

upper hand.

This  is  not  some-

thing  drow  choose

to  do;  its  simply

how they think. The

notion  of  a  society

of  equals  is  a  for-

THE BEST LAID SCHEMES

Its easy enough to characterize the drow as long-term plotters,

but what exactly does that mean? Presented here are a few brief

examples of the sorts of forward-looking plans in which some

drow engage.

A  young  member  of  a  powerful  house  appears  helpful

and supportive of her elder siblings over the years, slowly

building  up  a  web  of  debt  and  favor  that  binds  almost

every member of her family to her. Decades later, when the

matron of her house has grown old, she calls in those debts

for seemingly minor favors that involve travel, ensuring that

her siblings are absent when the matron dies (likely due to

poison or some other effort of the schemer herself). By the

time her siblings have returned, she has already established

herself as the new ruling power of the house.

other connections, she subtly encourages overuse of that

resource, or even arranges to have quantities of it destroyed

in an accident or an attack of some sort. Suddenly, she is

the only supplier to the community, granting her substantial

political and economic influence over even the houses and

the Church of Lolth.

Through a combination of bribes, sabotage, and intermar-

riages,  one  particular  family  slowly  intertwines  itself  with

many of the individual bloodlines of a great house. This likely

grants the family no direct access to the houses matriarchs

or other leaders, because these wary individuals would never

trust strangers. But if the family members choose carefully,

they not only have a direct line of intelligence on the houses

activities,  which  they  can  trade  to  others  for  wealth  and

favors, but they might be able to gain a stranglehold over

the houses economic and military aspects. If the house is

no longer receiving income from its various mercantile en-

deavors, and if many of its soldiers are of divided loyalties, it

is ripe for outside takeover or destruction.

For years, a drow stockpiles a particular resourceperhaps

something as simple as foodstuffs, or material necessary

for the building of magic items and weapons of war. Using

their subordinates beyond how useful those individuals are.

Similarly, the concept of privacy is ludicrous in their eyes.

A drow who is not strong enough to keep her affairs secret

deserves to be exposed and exploited.

Arachnid Veneration and Emulation

One  of  the  greatest  and  strangest  in uences  on  drow  psy-

chology and culture stems from their religious beliefs. Most

humanoid races have humanoid-form deities. When they seek

to emulate the behavior and attitudes of their gods, either to

gain the deitys blessings or simply because they see it as the

right way to act, they are not acting counter to their own

physiological and biological natures.

Not so with the drow. They are a humanoid, mammalian

race with all the associated needs, urges, and instincts, yet

they revere the spider, a creature of mindless predation. They

are a community that seeks to become a swarm. They are an

innately emotional people who revere a creature of no emo-

tion at all. (And all this doesnt even touch on the fact that

they  worship  a  deity  whose  physical  likeness  they  cannot

begin to emulate.)

This con ict of desires shapes much of the drow psyche. It

is at least partly responsible for the cultures sole measure of

self-worth through power and authority, and is responsible

too for much of the societys inherent violence. Their fear of

their goddess, their shame at being unable to fully live up to

her demands, their anger at the world around themall of

it can, at least in part, be traced to their deep-seated venera-

tion of a deity they cannot emulate and cannot truly please.

It  is  not  too  much  of  a  stretch  to  suggest  that,  due  to  the

con ict  of  their  religious  beliefs  with  their  own  physical

and mental nature, every member of drow society is at least

a little insane.

Instinctive or Cultural?

One question of drow psychology that never occurs to the

drow themselves, but is of great interest to outside scholars,

is whether all these attitudes are ingrained and instinctual, or

whether they are a product of culture and upbringing. Many

believe that, due to the in uence of Lolth and countless gen-

erations of violence and scheming, drow attitudes are now

entirely innate. Take a drow infant to the surface and raise

her among kind humans or elves, they say, and she would still

grow into a calculating, violent manipulator.

Others  contend,  however,  that  the  drow  are  not  unlike

abused children. They perpetuate a cycle of viciousness and

cruelty  because  it  is  all  they  know,  because  they  are  both

learning from example and lashing out at an unkind world

in anger and resentment. If that cycle could be broken, they

argue, if a population of drow could be raised away from the

in uence of Lolth and the culture as it currently exists, they

could grow to be very different individuals.

This  is,  perhaps  understandably,  the  minority  opinion

among those who study the drow, and in any event it seems

unlikely to be tested anytime soon.

RELIGION

If drow life and culture are driven by a single force, it must be

their faith. The drow are pantheistic in only the loosest sense

of the word. Humans worship a variety of deities equally. Elves

revere Corellon Larethian above all others, but their religion

is replete with other deities that are nearly as important. But

for the drow, there is only Lolth.

This comes as a surprise to many scholars, who believe the

drow pantheon to consist of multiple deities. This is particu-

larly true in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, where entities

such as Ghaunadaur and Vhaeraun appear in drow religious

practice. But these deities, no matter how strongly an indi-

vidual drow might revere them, are secondary at best, barely

visible in the shadow of the Spider Queen. The drow honor

them, but they do not consider them true gods and do not

worship any of them with the same devotionor fear them

half as deeplyas they do Lolth. It is she, and she alone, who

stands as the heart of drow religion.

Religious  practice  is  not  a  voluntary  activity  among  the

drow. Because the priestesses rule drow society (to the extent

that any one institution can be said to do so), they ruthlessly

enforce the worship of Lolth, demanding participation in her

rites and often punishing failure to take part by making the

transgressor their next sacri ce. The priestesses rarely  nd

themselves  forced  to  take  such  steps,  however.  Worship  of

Lolth is so heavily ingrained in the culture that most drow

participate willingly, out of a mixture of reverence and terror

for their goddess.

RITES AND RITUALS OF LOLTH

As should be expected from so violent a society and so rapa-

cious  a  deity,  the  holy  rites  of  Lolth  are  brutal  and  bloody

affairs. Living sacri ce is a central tenet of all but the most

minor of rituals. The drow worship not out of love, but out of

fear, and their faith demands that their fear be spread to others.

Lolth watches, Lolth testsand above all, Lolth consumes.

Prayers

Prayers to Lolth are always uttered in Elven. Undercommon is

 ne for normal conversation, but devotions to the goddess are

not to be sullied with words adopted from other races.

The drow frequently pray before entering into a dangerous

situation, beginning an endeavor, or simply preparing for a

days work. They do not, however, ask Lolths aid in the coming

trials, or seek her blessing on a task. Requesting help is a sign

of weakness, insulting to the goddess, and just begging to be

stricken with some horri c malady or misfortune. Instead,

prayers to Lolth are requests to be tested, so that the petitioner

can display her strength and skill, or promises that the days

successes will be achieved in Lolths name and devoted to her

glory. Elliya Lolthu, Elven for Test me, Lolth, is among the

most common phrases uttered in drow prayer.

Minor Rites

An individual drow might perform a minor rite when she is

celebrating a personal victory, and seeks to offer Lolth her due.

More than a simple prayer, these rites usually involve some

form of symbolic sacri ce, such as poured wine, burnt riches,

Lolths temples dominate almost every drow community

or a small amount of the petitioners own spilled blood. Such

rites require an icon, idol, or symbol of Lolth, before which

they are performed. They include the recitation of long prayers

asking Lolth to accept the offered gifts and to provide even

greater challenges in the days to come.

Unlike  prayers,  which  are  often  uttered  in  public,  and

major rites, which are large affairs, minor rites are personal

activities. They rarely involve more than one drow, and never

more than a handful.

Major Rites

The drow conduct two types of major rites to Lolth, both of

which involve the participation of multiple individuals and

blood sacri ce to the goddess.

The  rst is a religious ceremony, in which drow gather to

pay homage to their dark queen. Priestesses lead the ceremony

with prayers and chants, normally within a temple of Lolth or

before a great altar or idol. At least one sacri cenormally of

a captive or slave, but occasionally of a drow citizenoccurs

at this time, blood spilled to feed the Spider Queen.

The second is a contest between priestesses or, more rarely,

other  powerful  drow,  designed  to  prove  worthiness  in  the

eyes  of  Lolth.  Most  of  these  events  include  direct  combat

and competition, either in melee or spellcasting, but others

involve tests of knowledge and ritual, or even the acquisition

of speci c goals. The winner proves her worth and gains addi-

tional magic, higher position in the priesthood, and similar

prizes. The losers, assuming they survive, are often demoted,

maimed, or transformed by Lolths anger into driders or other

horri c creatures.

The drow conduct major rites to celebrate communitywide

events and victories, whenever a priestess seeks advancement

to a high of ce, and at regular intervals for no purpose other

than the veneration of Lolth.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SACRIFICES TO THE SPIDER QUEEN

Lolths tastes in sacrifices are very specific. She prefers sentient

creatures over nonsentient ones, humanoids over nonhuman-

oids,  elves  over  other  humanoids,  and  drow  over  elves.  She

prefers more powerful (higher level) sacrifices to weaker ones,

and  her  own  priestesses  over  all  others.  Obviously,  this  last

type  of  sacrifice  occurs  only  rarely.  To  keep  the  church  from

falling  apart,  the  priestesses  seldom  initiate  violence  among

themselves, and if one priestess does come to blows against

another, the lot of them likely come to the aid of the victim, if

only  to  preserve  the  status  quo.  They  do  sacrifice  their  own

as punishment, however, or if one makes too many enemies

among the others. This factor keeps all the priestesses wary of

one another and constantly scrabbling for sufficient power to

ward off sudden attacksexactly the way Lolth wants it.

SERVANTS OF LOLTH

Becoming a Priestess

The drows priesthood is unusualperhaps even unique

because it is not inherently any more faithful or zealous in

its worship than the rest of the population. Almost all drow

venerate Lolth, for they understand the consequences of fail-

ing  to  do  so.  The

Church  of  Lolth

is  less  a  haven  for

the societys devout

and  more  a  reli-

able path to power.

Short  of  work-

ing  ones  way  up

through the ranks

of a powerful house,

the  priesthood  is

the  surest  means

of  advancement

in  drow  society.

And  although  the

priesthood  rarely

accepts  drow  of

low station, it does

so  with  more  fre-

quency  than  the

houses do.

That  said,  the

drow  understand

that  the  life  of  a

priestess is not one

of ease. The church

not  only  conducts

Lolths  rites  and

rituals, it serves as

the  glue  that  holds

together  a  society  of  scheming  and  bickering  houses.  Its

members must be strong and merciless, andperhaps hard-

est  of  allmust  moderate  their  own  schemes  to  consider

the needs of the church as a whole. This doesnt mean that

drow priestesses do not plan to achieve their own ambitions

at the expense of others; in fact, the priesthood is  lled with

more political in ghting and secret deals than in any three

houses put together. The priestesses understand, however, that

although Lolth favors drow who advance their own power,

she also wishes the race as a whole to thrive, and a priestess

whose personal schemes threaten to weaken the community

swiftly  nds herself falling out of favor with both the goddess

and her church.

To become a priestess of Lolth, a female drow must meet two

speci c requirements. (Male drow are never accepted into the

priesthood, and can at best hope to be a favored servant of a

priestess.) First, she must show an aptitude for divine magic.

Among  the  drow,

every priest must

be a cleric or other

divine caster, such

as a favored soulCD,

even  if  she  has

only  a  few  levels

in the appropriate

class.

a

S e c o n d ,

would-be-priest-

ess  must  subject

herself to the  rst

of  many  Tests  of

Lolth.  Many  lay

drow  face  these

trials  at  various

points, but priest-

esses endure them

on a relatively reg-

ular basis. Strictly

speaking,  these

tests are between

the

individual

and  Lolth,  and

outside  interfer-

ence is forbidden.

On  a  practical

level,  however,

drow priestesses are

rarely accepting of new competition (unless the newcomer

is somehow indebted or subservient to them, of course) and

might  provide  new  initiates  with  a  bit  of  extra  challenge.

Poisoning and sabotage are not uncommon, and as long as

the priestesses meddling goes undetected, Lolth seems not

to object. Of course, a priestess who is caught sabotaging a

newcomer, or whose efforts fail to prevent the new initiate

from succeeding, often suffers her own trials and punishment

at  Lolths  handsor  the  hands  of  rival  priestesses  looking

to tear down an experienced enemy as a younger one takes

her place.

Once  one  has  become  a  priestess,  the  hard  work  is  far

from  over.  Advancement  requires  constant  effort  to  prove

loyalty  to  Lolth,  to  exercise  control  over  other  drow,  and

to take advantage of the other priestesses weaknesses. The

Lolth loves nothing so much as the taste of a sacri ces agony

DAUGHTERS OF DEMONS

One exception exists to the rule that all drow priestesses must

be divine spellcasters. Lolth resides in the Abyss, and many of

her favored servants and minions are demons. If the powers of

a drow warlockCAr stem from bargains with (or descent from)

Lolth-associated  demons,  she  is  considered  blessed  by  the

Spider Queen. If these individuals meet all the other priesthood

requirements, can hold status even though they are technically

arcane spellcasters.

her  goddess,  and

even have levels as a

cleric, without for-

mally  joining  the

to cast divine spells

indicates  that  a

drow  has  Lolths

favor, but it doesnt

inherently  grant

her  any  authority

beyond  what  she

can take for herself.

She does not speak

among the priesthood

is  to  open  up  a  posi-

tion  by  discrediting  or

assassinating  someone  of  higher

rank.  Combined  with  the  require-

Lolth,  this  climate  of  backstabbing

makes the life span of a priest-

of  Lolth  remains

One very impor-

exists  among  the

drow, one that visi-

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

TESTS OF LOLTH

Only  the  strong  can  be  allowed  to  thrive;  the  weak  must  be

culled. This is a central tenet of drow culture and a primary law

of Lolth. To better ensure that only the strongest of her subjects

obtain power, Lolth occasionally subjects them to tests of their

abilities. Many drow, usually those who live unremarkable lives,

never receive such a test. Those who hold power must endure

at least one or two in their lifetimes, and priestesses and power-

ful matriarchs are tested on a regular basis.

In most instances, failing a Test of Lolth results in death. A

significant minority of the time, however, the failed subject is

instead transformed into a drider (or, more rarely, some other

hybrid  horror).  Until  recently,  the  drow  shunned  and  hated

the driders, seeing them as nothing but failures and signs of

Lolths displeasure. Recently, however, that attitude has begun

to change; see page 41 for details.

The two most common trials are described below.

The Test of Loyalty: A relative or ally of the drow to be tested is

granted a vision by Lolth, claiming that the subject of the test has

turned against her and must be slain in ambush. As the attack

begins, the subject hears Lolths voice telling her that she is being

tested; she must prove willing to slay an ally at Lolths command.

The Test of Strength:  This is simple combat against a rival

drow or a monster of power equal to or greater than the sub-

ject of the test. Defeat, or showing mercy to the foe, results in

failure of the test.

Although these are the most common Tests of Lolth, they are

also the least important. Other tests that drow must occasion-

ally endure include, but are not limited to, the following:

The Test of Lies: The subject must manipulate certain indi-

vidualsrevealed to her by the voice of Lolthinto believing

specific falsehoods. Even under threat and torture, she must

continue to make these lies fully believable.

The Test of Mettle: The drow, in a confined space, is abruptly

covered with swarms of venomous spiders. She must extricate

herself without harming any of the arachnids, and survive their

poisonous bites in the process.

The Test of Doubt: The drow is stripped of many, or even all,

of  her  powers,  including  her  racial  abilities  and  spellcasting

(both  arcane  and  divine).  This  degradation  can  even  include

the sudden acquisition of negative levels. In a few instances,

the drow is turned into a drider or other creature, as though

she had already failed a test. The drow must not only survive,

but  thrive  in  her  weakened  stateoften  for  days,  weeks,  or

longerwithout losing faith in Lolth. Only the most powerful

and  highly  placed  drow  suffer  this  test,  and  those  who  pass

are the stronger for it. (Any levels a drow gains to make up for

her newfound vulnerabilitiesfor instance, a cleric stripped of

her magic who gains several levels of rogue before her powers

returndo  not  count  against  her  for  the  purpose  of  multi-

classing penalties.)

community. Three titles are common among the drow, though

even these are far from universal.

An elder, experienced, or powerful priestess is often called

Reverend Mother.

A priestess of moderate age, experience, or power is often

titled Reverend Daughter.

All  others  are  simply  called  Priestess,  or  sometimes

addressed with the honori c Revered, as in Revered Thezil-

dra, I seek an audience.

In most cases, when the drow speak of rank in the Church

of Lolth, or a priestess talks about promotion, what theyre

referring to is a simple measurement of authority and senior-

ity. An underling doesnt assassinate her superior to obtain

a particular title; she does so to ascend one step higher

on the ladder of power. In this regard, the church

is no different from the rest of drow societya

priestesss  power  is  as  potent  as  her  ability  to

force others to acknowledge that power.

Duties of the Clergy

Anyone who has read this far and still

expects drow priestesses to counsel

the faithful in times of emotional tur-

moil or crises of faith has clearly not

been paying attention. Lolths church

is not a sanctuary for other drow in

times of trouble, but a home for her

primary minions and enforcers.

The  duties  of  Lolths  priestesses

are  twofold.  One,  they  are  respon-

sible for leading the drow in the rituals

demanded by the Queen of the Demon-

web  Pits.  Although  any  cleric  of  Lolth

can  lead  others  in  prayer  or  minor  rites,

only a true priestess can lead a community

as a whole, or conduct the formal sacri ces

Lolth demands.

Their  second  purpose,  closely  related  to

the  rst, is enforcing the worship of Lolth and

Lolths dictates. Priestesses have the authority

to demand attendance at Lolths rites and to levy

punishment on those who fail to participate or

otherwise act against the Spider Queens inter-

ests.  The  drow  rarely  sacri ce  one  of  their  own,  normally

choosing slaves or prisoners instead, but Lolth prefers the taste

of drow to all others, and when the church  nds an excuse to

offer up a drow as punishment, it is quick to jump on it.

Beyond this, Lolths priestesses have no strict duties. Some

perform various social ceremonies such as marriages, but this

is usually done as a favor (eventually requiring repayment, of

course) to another powerful drow. They often serve as lead-

ers in times of con ict, crisis, or war, but such roles are  lled

equally often by house matrons. Priestesses, when not con-

ducting rites to their Queen, are engaged in the same sorts of

schemes as all other drowthey simply have the advantage

of divine mandate, or at least of powerful allies and resources,

when doing so.

Lolth is the single true deity of the drow; she is their

guide and ruling power. The elves and other

surface races believe that she was Corel-

lon  Larethians  original  consort,  cast

out of the pantheon when she turned

to evil. The drow, and Lolth herself,

teach a much different version; see

History  and  Folklore,  below.  In

either case, it was Lolth who  rst

spread  evil  among  the  elves,  and

who  led  the  drow  away  from  the

rest of the elves thousands of years

ago. Now she focuses on breeding

and  con ict  among  the  drow  to

make the race ever more powerful,

and on using them to conquer the vast

cavern-realms beneath the surface of

the  earth.  Lolth  relishes  the  chance

to  test  her  followers  by  pitting  them

against  each  other,  culling  the  weak

from the strong.

Lolth appears as either a tall, beautiful

female drow, or a massive black spider with a

female drows head.

Cleric Training

Beyond  the  requirements  and  Tests  of  Lolth

discussed above, clerics and priestesses of Lolth

undergo  no  formal  training.  Lolth  requires

these tests of her priestesses frequently.

Quests

Lolth  has  set  her  worshipers  to  the  task  of  conquering  the

vast network of caverns in the underground realm, as well as

killing surface elves. Typical quests include attacking a rival

drow community, raiding a mind  ayer lair for its magic, and

building  an  artifact  that  turns  surface-dwelling  elves  into

spiders.

Prayers

The  precise  nature  of  prayers  to  Lolth  is  discussed  above.

Clerics and priestesses often pray before undertaking even

mundane daily activities, dedicating everything they do to

their queen.

Temples

Lolths  temples  dominate  (in  every  sense  of  the  word)  the

communities  that  surround  them.  They  are  large,  impos-

ing edi ces, intended to make all who enter feel small and

humbleda sensation that truly strong drow are expected

to resist. These temples are defended by clever and capable

priestesses, soldiers, and minions of Lolth, and frequently by

hordes of arachnids as well. They often serve as storehouses of

dark lore and powerful magic as well as places of ritual.

Lolth, which bears little resemblance to what surface-dwellers

normally consider a church, the houses appear synonymous

with the various dynasties and noble bloodlines of human,

elf, and dwarf culture.

This assessment is accurate only to a point. The houses are

indeed extended families, but that extension goes far beyond

anything  even  the  most  intricate  of  human  genealogies

would recognize, and the familial bonds are often purely

symbolic.

Rites

STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION

The speci c details of rites and rituals to Lolth are discussed

above. Although any cleric can conduct these rites for small

or family groups, only a formal priestess has the authority to

demand attendance of a community. (Or at least, only a priest-

ess of cially has such authority. As with all else among the

drow, if a single individual has the power to force participation,

then she has the right to force participation.)

Heralds and Allies

Lolths most common herald is a bebilith demon with 18 Hit

Dice. Her allies are succubus demons, bebilith demons, and

marilith demons. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, this group

also includes the hideous yochlols.

Lolth manifests an aspect of herself (essentially an avatar

representing only a tiny portion of her true power) with rela-

tive frequency, often attending major rites or rituals directly

and feeding upon the sacri ces.

To fully understand the drow houses, one must  rst under-

stand how they are structured. With very few exceptions, each

house is ruled by a single powerful drow. Always a female, she

is normally referred to as the Matron Motheror simply the

matronof the house. A great many matrons are also priest-

esses of Lolth, leading to a blurring of the distinctions between

church power and house power.

As stated above, not all clerics of Lolth are of cially members

of her priesthood. This fact becomes important when study-

ing the nature of the drow houses. Although only a fraction of

matrons are priestesses of Lolth, nearly all of them are clerics

of Lolth. (Those few who are not are invariably other divine

casters  or  warlocks  with  strong  connections  to  the  Spider

Queen.) These matronsalong with their close female rela-

tives, who are also often clerics of Lolthlead the members

of their house in religious observance, just as the priestesses

do for the community as a whole.

At the center of a house is a single-family unit, made up of

blood relations to the matron. It is from this family that the

houses authority  gurespriestesses, spellcasters, teachers,

military leaders, merchants, and the likedescend. It is quite

probable, in fact, that in the early days of drow history, these

powerful families made up the entirety of the houses.

This is no longer the case. Assuming they have not been

exiled, or have not chosen to secede, everyone with the slight-

est of blood ties to a houses central family is now considered a

part of the house proper. Anyone who marries into the house is

considered part of the house. Most confusing for others study-

ing the drow, an individualor even an entire familycan

also be annexed as part of the house, if the matron agrees to

HOUSES OF THE DROW

The Church of Lolth might be the primary driving force in

drow culture, but it is certainly not the only one. Standing

beside  the  priesthood  as  equals  on  the  political  and  soci-

etal  playing   elds  are  the  great  houses.  These  monolithic

institutions are the closest things the drow have to a formal

government. In some respects, it could even be said that the

houses, and not the actual physical communities, are the true

form and representation of the drow nation.

Other races studying drow culture are often taken in by the

outward appearance of the houses. Unlike the priesthood of

THE CULT OF THE

ELDER ELEMENTAL EYE

For all Lolths influence over drow society, and the infiltration

of her priesthood into all aspects of life, other religious cults do

spring up among the drow from time to time. Most such sects

are discovered and crushed in short order, but a few are secre-

tive  and  widespread  enough  that,  by  the  time  the  Church  of

Lolth becomes aware of them, they are not easily destroyed.

The  greatest  of  these  organizations,  at  least  until  recently,

was the cult of the Elder Elemental Eye. The Eye is a chaotic,

destructive adherent of entropy and the most primal aspects of

the four elements. It never communes directly with its clerics,

but instead seems to speak through the great elemental princes:

Imix of Fire, Ogrmoch of Earth, Olhydra of Water, and Yan-C-

Bin of Air. Drow followers of the Elemental Eye seek one day to

supplant Lolths priesthood as the primary religious force in so-

ciety. These cultists are among the races greatest schemers, for

secrecy is not only vital to their success, but their very survival.

For a time, their greatest bastion was the infamous Temple of

Elemental Evil, and its recent destruction at the hands of adven-

turers has reduced the cult to its weakest state yet. It survives in

the darkest reaches of drow society, however, and slowly works

at  rebuilding  itself.  A  drow  discovered  to  be  a  member  of  the

cult can expect immediate torture and execution, unless she has

something of substantial worth to offer in exchange for silence.

Some of the few sages that are intimately familiar with the

Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye suggest that the Eye itself might

be an aspect of the mad deity known to the surface-dwelling

races as Tharizdun (CD 123).

this. No tie of blood, or even of marriage, is necessary, though

those relationships certainly make such connections stronger.

If a house sees political advantage in claiming someone as one

of its own, and if that individual wishes to join the house, then

she is part of the house, pure and simple. These adoptions

involve rituals and ceremony of some sort, to show the com-

munity that the house has accepted a new member, but even

these displays are not essential.

Many  houses  wield  in uence  in  multiple  communities.

For example, House Eilservs, at the height of its power,

had member families dwell-

ing in almost every major

drow  city.  Even  today,

though its star shines

more dimly, the house

is  represented  in  the

vast  majority  of  com-

munities.  Dozens  or

even hundreds of sep-

arate families, related

tangentially if at all,

can make up a single

house.  Some  of  the

greatest houses pos-

sess  thousands  of

members and have

larger populations

than  most  drow

cities.

In some cases, a

house  might  have

more than one drow

who  claims  the  title

of  matron.  If  House

Inlindl  has  powerful

branches  in  the  city

of  Erelhei-Cinlu  and

the city of Yvoth-Lened,

and both branches are led

by a powerful priestess of

Lolth,  which  priestess  is

the  true  Matron  of  Inlindl?

If  the  two  rarely  interact,  or

do so only through couriers and the

occasional  emissary,  both  might  claim

the title without negative repercussions.

In many cases, though, having more than one claimant to the

title of Matron Mother leads to civil war within a house; see

below for details.

HOUSE AUTHORITY

Why do houses hold so much power? The drow have no formal

or organized government, so its not the dictate of law that

allows them to govern industries, districts, and even entire

communities. Rather, the political and social power of a house

is largely self-perpetuating. The family at the heart of a house

consisted of powerful drow to begin with. Some were priest-

esses, with all the authority that title implies. Others were

military  leaders,  with  numerous  troops  at  their  beck  and

call. Still others were powerful merchants, whose slaves and

servants had  nal say over what products entered or left a com-

munity, or who controlled a valuable trade route. As always,

this authority belonged to those powerful enough to take it

and keep it, and these drow were powerful indeed.

As others  ocked to it and the house expanded, so too did

its  power.  Even  more  merchants  fell  under  its  sway,  grant-

ing the house that much more in uence over a communitys

economic life. The house gained more soldiers, more priest-

esses, and more drow powerful enough to call in favors

or  make  demands  of  others.  It  is  a  simple  and

irrefutable syllogism: The mem-

bers  of  a  house  have  power,

and the members of a house

cooperate under the sway of

a  single  matron;  therefore,

the house and the matron

have all the power of their

underlings  at  their  beck

and call.

A  moderately  pow-

erful  house  can  sway

the  behavior  of  an

entire  community.  A

truly  mighty  one  can

challenge  all  other

houses, and even the

priesthood, for what

amounts  to  dictato-

rial  control  over  a

given  region.  If  it

succeeds,  its  mem-

bers  can  enforce

whatever  control

they  wishdespite

the  chaotic  nature

of  those  they  domi-

natefor the simple

reason  that  no  avail-

able force has the power

to refuse them.

Even other priestesses lack the power

wielded by a houses Matron Mother

This opportunity, of course, is

why a drow would wish to be a member

of a house, even though it means a life

of constant politicking, treachery, back-

stabbing, secrecy, and paranoia. With the power of a house to

back up ones own authority, and its resources to draw on for

ones own schemes, a clever and patient drow can accomplish

almost anything.

HOUSE INTERACTION

The power of the drow houses, like the power of speci c drow,

waxes and wanes over the course of years. How well a house

manages  to  hold  onto  its  in uence  depends  in  part  on  the

personal successes of its members, but also on how it handles

its interactions with the rest of society.

21

2/22/07   3:01:50 PM

Other Houses

Internal Interactions

Houses  interact  with  one  another  almost  exactly  as  drow

individuals interact with one another; they are very literally

a re ection in macrocosm of drow society. One great house

might ally with another; engage in economic con ict with a

third (perhaps by using its own merchants to undercut the

others pro ts); conspire to weaken a fourth by revealing that

its matron was brie y a member of the Cult of the Elder Ele-

mental Eye (possibly using manufactured evidence to frame

her); order the assassination of a powerful priestess who favors

a rival  fth house; and slowly amass troops for a sudden and

overwhelming strike on yet a sixth enemy house. This dizzying

assortment of plots wouldnt even represent an especially busy

period in the houses history, since these sorts of machinations

and manipulations occur regularly and constantly. Just as an

individual drow cannot hope to advance in society without

establishing authority over other drow, so too must the houses

constantly work to keep on top of their competition.

Alliances between the great houses are usually matters of

political, economic, or military convenience. Most are short-

term,  lasting  only  until  the  involved  parties  have  attained

a particular goal. The drow are more than willing to betray

their closest allies if doing so nets them a worthwhile advan-

tage. Such betrayals of one house by another have sometimes

resulted in civil war. (See War, page 30.) If two or more houses

 nd a political partnership more pro table than working alone,

however, such alliances can last generations, or even result in

the merging of two houses into a single entity.

The Priesthood

The attitudes of a given house toward the Church of Lolth

depend largely on who holds the power in that house. Where

the matron is also a formal priestess, the house might act as

little  more  than  a  political  arm  of  the  priesthood.  Or  the

matron might play both sides of the  eld, using her church

authority  to  quash  enemies  both  inside  and  outside  the

house,  and  wielding  the  power  of  her  house  to  best  rivals

within the church.

In most cases, however, a solid demarcation between house

and church does existeven if the lines are faint. Although

houses  might  have  an  open  rivalry  with  one  another,  any

con ict with the priesthood is subtle and secretive. In some

communities,  a  house  might  be  so  powerful  that  even  the

church cannot move against it; in others, the priesthood holds

so much political authority that no house can challenge it. In

most cases, the balance of power is the result of a give-and-take

between the two institutions. A house cannot blatantly refuse

to acknowledge the priesthood for fear that the church might

declare it traitorous against Lolth and turn the other houses

against it. On the other hand, the church relies on goods over

which the houses have economic in uence, and might require

the aid of some houses in enforcing the dictates of Lolth, so it

will not turn on most houses without extreme cause. Further, if

the priesthood should attempt to turn the community against

a house and fail (perhaps because the house holds so much

power that the other houses are unwilling to move against it),

the priesthood loses all credibility in the eyes of the community

and can never attempt such a show of force again.

Drow will be drow, and the monolithic, unbreakable face that

houses present to the world is a thin faade, barely suf cient

to  cover  the  writhing  cauldron  of  scheming  and  betrayal

beneath.  Houses  represent  the  pinnacle  of  power  for  the

drow, and every house member wants to be the one in control

of that power. Various matriarchsparticularly relatives of

the core familylie, cheat, and murder to become the next

matron, and those farther from the heart of power do the same

simply to bring themselves to the matrons attention. They

hope perhaps to receive a plum assignment or even simple

acknowledgment, which they can then pass off to others as

favor from above.

To maintain their in uence, both over the community as a

whole and over their own members, houses have established

traditions  and  codes  of  behavior.  A  house  might  follow  a

relatively  precise  hierarchy  of  ranking  and  seniority,  or  its

members might have to assemble for house rituals at speci c

times. The house might determine a regimen of training and

education  for  its  young,  using  them  to  bolster  the  familys

needs. It might even have particular laws forbidding members

from  engaging  in  certain  activities:  assassinations  during

wartime, for instance, or cooperation with other houses on

personal projects. If a house has almost total control over a

community, it might even enforce these laws on others out-

side the house itself. These are drow houses, of course, and

the chaotic and ambitious nature of the race means that many

house members will not follow these strictures. Nonetheless,

the regulations remain in place, and the punishments for vio-

lating them are heartless and draconian. Torture is a common

penalty, and exile and execution are both viable options. In

this regard, house dictates are often the closest thing a drow

community has to a government or code of laws.

DUTIES AND BENEFITS

In  simplest  terms,  a  drow  who  belongs  to  a  great  house  is

obligated to do whatever the matron, or another high-ranking

member of the house, requires of her. Depending on the situ-

ation, she might be ordered to undertake a journey, deliver a

message, construct an item, or even marry a political ally. Of

course, the individual can refuse, at which point the question

becomes whether the one giving the orders truly has the ability

to enforce obedience. If that authority  gure is the matron of

the house, she almost always does, and the disobedient drow

is punished. Other cases might not be so clear-cut, and some

members of a house have been overthrown and replaced simply

because they lacked enough minions and personal might to

enforce their own edicts.

Drow  houses  have  suf cient  structure  that  they  do  not

assign random tasks to random individuals. A house member

has speci c duties required of her by her position. A blademas-

ter, for instance, is responsible for teaching the art of combat to

younger members in times of peace, and leading house soldiers

into combat in times of war. A cleric must lead, or aid others in

leading, house rituals to Lolth, and ensure that all members of

the house are faithful in their devotion to the Spider Queen.

A wizard must study new spells, create items for house use, or

cast spells against house enemies, depending on her areas of

specialization and the current political climate. Even hunters

and adventurers, though they certainly seek to advance their

own standing, also quest to aid the houses endeavors.

More mundane drow also work for the good of the house.

Shopkeepers and vendors sell goods brought into the com-

munity by house mercantile interests, and funnel the income

back  into  house  coffers.  Soldiers  practice  and  train  for  the

day they are ordered to move against enemies of their house.

Drow houses are pragmatic, and they assign their members

responsibilities based primarily on their capabilities, putting

them where they will do the most good.

Where the houses vary is less in what they require of their

members, but how much. In some houses, a drow must merely

devote  a  bit  of  her  time  to  the  house  when  requested,  and

is otherwise left entirely to her own devices. Other houses

require that their members work for them at all times; the

only  personal  objectives  and  tasks  they  can  undertake  are

those that also further the houses own needs, allowing them

to achieve both at once. The most powerful houses lean toward

the latter option, making full use of their available resources,

but those houses also see the most political in ghting and

deal-making  as  their  members  realign  their  personal  goals

along house lines. After all, if one must spend all her time

working for the house, one might as well also gain as much

from that house as possible.

HOUSE AFFILIATION

The following table makes use of the affiliation system (PH2, Chapter 7). If you are not using this system in your campaign, ignore

the numeric values below, and simply judge advancement through the ranks by means of age, accomplishments, level, or whatever

method you think best.

When a character gains access to spells and equipment, it means the house provides that material for the duration of a single

endeavor. Although no formal limit exists for how often a member can do this, the DM should watch for abuse. A house grants its

favors to those who prove effective. If a character constantly achieves great wealth and power for a house, it assists her in further

endeavors far more frequently than it does a member who focuses primarily on her own objectives, or who regularly fails in her

tasks. On average, assume that this advantage is available at most three times per year.

Although the obligations of house membership are substan-

tial, the bene ts are equally so. The speci cs vary from house

to house, just as do the duties, but certain advantages are, if not

universal, at least quite common. All drow respect and fear the

power of the houses, so house membership offers advantages

to social interaction in the form of skill bonuses. Rivals who

might not think twice about sabotaging or assassinating a par-

ticular drow might hesitate to do so if that individual is part of

a great house, for fear of reprisal. (The drow in a given house

might constantly  ght each other, but they frequently band

together in the face of outside aggression, and a house rarely

lets an insult or attack go unanswered.) Although the house

demands a portion of its members income, it also provides sup-

plies and equipment for house-mandated activities and even

for some personal endeavors. Most important, the house can

provide other resources, such as ancient lore, intelligence, and

even (in some cases) soldiers or other assistants. Precisely how

thoroughly an individual can draw on these resources depends

on her status within the house, but even the lowest-ranked

members can often beg some small amount of help.

For  an  example  of  how  a  speci c  house  might  view  the

duties and bene ts of its members, see the House Af liation

sidebar on page 23.

Roleplaying  Application:  Consider  every  quest  or

endeavor you undertake not merely in terms of how it bene ts

you, but how it advances the house. This attitude doesnt stem

from feelings of loyaltythat term is practically meaningless

to drowbut because you understand that the stronger your

house grows, the stronger you grow, and that the more you

provide for it, the more you can ask of it in exchange. You think

in terms of houses and families when considering even non-

drow politics, and are often surprised at the relatively small

sizes of other races noble families. You think less of those who

would claim authority without a house or similar institution

to back them up, and you might even fail to recognize their

authority at all until forced.

turn to the unbreakable bonds of family. The drow have a saying

about family, too. Roughly translated, it states, In a females

own home, she knows where the knives are hidden.

It would be easy to assume that the drow do not value family

ties at all, and that they treat their own relatives as viciously

and cavalierly as they do others of their race. This conclusion

is not entirely accurate. Its true that most drow feel, at best,

only  slightly  more  affection  for  relatives  than  they  do  for

others, and that members of a given family might hate and

scheme against each other as thoroughly as they do anyone

else. Sibling rivalry among drow, for example, often results in

actual bloodshed. Most drow, however, do not betray family

members without good reason, and when they seek allies in an

endeavor or protection from outside threats, they often turn

to their relatives  rst. This tendency stems not from any true

sense of endearment so much as from simple logic. A drow

knows members of her family better than she does others,

and so has at least a somewhat better understanding of their

goals and secrets. Further, since families focus on a particular

arena of in uencecommerce and trade, magic, soldiering,

stonemasonry, blacksmithing, or what have youthe odds are

good that what advances one member of a family advances the

family as a whole. For instance, if a family is well known for

producing military leaders, then advancing one of its members

to the head of a houses guards raises the esteem of that family

in the eyes of both the house and the community at large.

Most drow families consists of everyone in a direct line

of descent from a single individual and relatives removed by

only  a  single  step.  That  group  would  include  grandparents

and parents, children and grandchildren, nieces and neph-

ews, brothers and sisters, aunts and great-aunts, uncles and

great-uncles, and  rst cousins. Some families go farther a eld,

claiming  more  distant  cousins,  aunts  several  generations

removed, and the like. A family that is part of a house is more

likely to extend itselfat least for the sake of skilled or impor-

tant distant membersthan one that is not. In some cases,

an appropriate marriage can bring two families together into

one larger unit, but in most cases the male is simply subsumed

into the females family line. The head of a familys household

is usually the eldest matriarch.

Most humans are familiar with the saying Blood is thicker than

water, representing that races philosophy that one can always

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

PREGNANCY, BIRTH,

AND CHILDHOOD

The drow are notably more fertile than are their surface-dwell-

ing  cousins.  They  become  pregnant  more  easily  and  have  a

slightly shorter gestation period.

The  drow  do  not  believe  in  using  magic  or  anything  more

than basic herbal medicines to aid a mother through the pain

and danger of childbirth. Should she die in the process, she is

clearly too weak to contribute further to the race anyway.

Once  drow  children  are  born,  they  are  raised  by  servants

(drow parents rarely spend much time with their offspring) in

communal living areas used by families or even entire houses.

Drow children are no less temperamental than drow adults, and

are in fact encouraged to resolve their difficulties through vio-

lence. If a child is not strong enough to survive and thrive in this

environment, well, better that it not live to an equally violent

adulthood. Perhaps spurred on by these hostile circumstances,

drow children develop much faster than other elvesalmost as

swiftly as humans, in factoften beginning schooling as early

as age eight or ten.

Drow  schooling  is  heavily  focused.  Although  the  children

receive a sufficient grounding in all the basics of learning, they

are trained primarily in the drow faith, as well as in one or two

other areas for which they show both an aptitude and an inter-

est. Once they have reached adolescence (at about age 20, by

which time over a third of them have been murdered or sacri-

ficed), their training shifts from a group endeavor to appren-

ticeship with a single mentor. Assuming their mentor doesnt

slay them for some minor infraction, they eventually become

skilled enough to adopt their trade on their ownwhich often

involves competing with other apprentices to take the mentors

place when she dies.

that de ne House Inlindl

95726720_Ch01.indd   25

2/22/07   3:01:57 PM

Within a house, families rise and fall in stature just as spe-

ci c individuals do. The matriarchs and other family elders

might work together to topple or discredit another family,

hoping to rise in the Matron Mothers esteem. The action

of a speci c individual can impact the station of a family as

a whole. A drow who obtains a position of great authority

within a house lifts her family up by association, and one

who is punished or exiled leaves an indelible stain upon the

reputation  of  her  bloodline.  In  extremely  rare  cases,  one

family might take the place of the houses central family, an

event that can alter the entire political identity of the house

in question. (Such an event has occurred once in recent his-

tory,  when  the  central  family  of  House  Eilservssecretly

worshipers of the Elder Elemental Eyewere removed from

power by a bloodline loyal to Lolth.) In some of these cases,

the house changes its name, adopting the appellation of the

new central family, but most of the time (including House

Eilservs) it keeps the old name simply for the sake of com-

munity recognition.

Although house families seek to advance both their own

agenda and that of the house proper, the two do sometimes

come into con ict. One house family might decide to move

against  another  family  during  a  time  of  crisis,  an  act  that

would weaken the houses ability to face the external threat.

Similarly, a family might conspire with members of an outside

house or the priesthood to weaken a houses central family, in

the hope of taking its place, though this step would leave the

new house in debt to an external power.

Obviously,  drow  are  expected  to  report  such  disruptive

ambitions to the house, allowing the matron or her proxies to

deal with the problem. Whether a drow chooses to inform, of

course, is a matter of whether they believe they can personally

bene t from the act. If a member of the family thinks it is to

her advantage to collaborate with the schemes, she does so;

if she thinks there is more bene t to turning in her relatives,

well, power really is more important than family.

Individual drow who threaten or betray a house can be tor-

tured, exiled, or slain, but its a bit harder to punish an entire

family tree (or family web, as the drow think of genealogi-

cal diagrams). If a family makes a power grab and fails, their

resultant loss of respect, in uence, and economic advantage

is often penalty enough. In other cases, however, the house

might actually expel the family from its ranks, or evenin a

few rare casesslaughter the bulk of them in a sudden over-

whelming offensive and make the survivors into slaves.

A FINAL WORD ON DROW SOCIETY

By this point, some of you might be wondering how drow

society has survived at all. How can a culture this sadistic,

this prone to betrayal and in ghting, this bereft of any legal

or moral code, possibly last for more than a few generations

without obliterating itself?

The truth is, it cant. Drow society is absolutely and utterly

nonviable. By all rights, it should have murdered itself into

oblivion eons ago.

It is only the will of the goddess Lolth that prevents this

circumstance  from  coming  about.  The  Spider  Queen  likes

her drow just as they areviolent, vicious, murderous, and

treacherous. It suits her for their society to continue in this

manner, and so continue it does.

Lolth works her will partly through her church. If a single

house, a single family, or even a single drow grows so violent

and dangerous that it threatens to tear down the community

as a whole, Lolth sends signs of her displeasure to her priest-

esses. They, in turn, move to squash the troublemaker, often

recruiting the aid of other houses and families (who are usually

all too happy to gain the favor of the priesthood and eliminate

a dangerous rival in one fell swoop).

The Queen of Spiders is not a subtle or patient goddess,

however,  and  if  she  feels  that  her  priestesses  are  unable  to

take effective steps in such a matter, she steps in directly. As

much as she encourages in ghting and bloodshed, she grows

wroth indeed at drow who threaten to collapse their entire

precarious social system. These drow often begin receiving

divine visions ordering them to cease their destructive actions.

Should they refuseor should Lolth just not be in the mood

to offer a warningthey might be abruptly stripped of their

powers,  attacked  by  endless  swarms  of  arachnid  monsters,

diseased, physically deformed, transformed into driders, or

simply and inexplicably dead.

DROW LIFE

Drow  life  consists  of  more  than  plotting  to  step  on  ones

neighbors and competitors. In fact, the common drow allots

a relatively small amount of time to scheming, leaving the

political and religious elite to spend almost every waking hour

in such matters. Like other races, the drow seek to excel in

personal pursuits, from obtaining enough wealth to live com-

fortably to mastering a favored form of art. Granted, all these

efforts must be undertaken with at least one eye perpetually

open  (lower-caste  drow  plot,  scheme,  and  assassinate  less,

but less isnt not at all). Nonetheless, this vigilance still

leaves suf cient time for the development of a rich culture

and lifestyle.

A few aspects of drow life strongly differentiate it from sur-

face cultures. First and foremost is the drow sense of timeput

shortly,  they  dont  have  much  of  one.  True,  drow  are  quite

precise when it comes to coordinating a military strike, arrang-

ing a clandestine meeting, or performing a religious or magic

ritual. In a larger sense, however, they tend not to divide the

day into formal intervals, and even the concept of day itself

varies from drow to drow. Dark elf culture is unconstrained

by the rising and setting of the sun. A drow shop is open for

business at whatever hours its proprietor chooses to operate

it; drow rise whenever they choose, or whenever their duties

and masters require them to do so.

Obviously, a group must have some means of coordinating

events to function as a community. A few drow cities use magic

timekeeperspillars that glow in set patterns or intervals,

precisely timed chimes, or the likebut most simply rely on

the Church of Lolth. The priesthood holds regular rituals to

the Spider Queen, and they use various signalsoften horns,

bells, or sacri cial shrieksto indicate when a rite is begin-

ning. Most drow choose to begin their day at one of these

times, purely for convenience.

Similarly,  the  drow  have  no  innate  concept  of  seasons.

Thus,  their  daily  routine  does  not  change  over  the  course

of the year. Farmers grow various fungi and deep-dwelling

vegetation  constantly,  and  ranchers  never  cease  herding

roth  (cattlelike  creatures  bred  to  thrive  underground;  see

page 157), giant lizards, monstrous spiders, and other beasts

used for food and/or labor.

One  constant  in  the  life  of  any  drow  is  the  ubiquity  of

spiders and other arachnids. This is not merely an aspect of

art and architecture, but an actual fact: Swarms of real arach-

nids, both normal-sized and monstrous, dwell within every

drow community. They hang from roofs, scuttle across roads,

build webs in common rooms, and adorn walls like decora-

tions. Though this situation would highly disturb most other

individuals, the drow are absolutely comfortable with it and

dont give this state of affairs much thought. It is as natural to

them as grass is to surface elves. The drow suffer surprisingly

few bitesperhaps through the grace of Loltheven though

many of these arachnids are venomous and irritable. A drow

who is bitten usually assumes she is either being punished

for some minor infraction or being tested. The drow have no

particular taboo against killing spiders, but they dont make

a habit of doing so for no apparent reason.

In fact, despite (or perhaps because of) their reverence for

these  arachnids,  spiders  make  up  a  regular  portion  of  the

drow diet. They are rarely the main course, but are instead

consumed as a symbolic portion of the meal, usually at the

beginningalmost  the  equivalent  of  asking  Lolths  grace.

Beyond this, the drow diet consists of numerous fungi and

lichen; meats from roth, lizard, and other subterranean crea-

tures; and, on occasion, the  esh of humanoid slaves. Drow do

not eat other drow, but beyond that, they do not consider the

consumption of humanoids to be cannibalism. A surface elf,

a human, a goblin, or a grimlock is an inferior creature, useful

only as a slave or other beast of burden; if such a creature is best

used as a supply of meat, why would the drow even hesitate

to utilize them as such? They do not frequently feed on other

humanoids, not out of any moral objection, but because it is

easier to breed other animals for food and because humanoids

are usually more useful in other capacities.

LEISURE

Drow do spend time in relaxation and leisure. For the upper

classes, much of this free time is spent in debauched pursuits

that feed their lust for violence, while others engage in sports

and games not dissimilar from those of the surface races.

Despite  their  innate  distrust  for  one  another,  high-caste

drow enjoy throwing and attending the occasional feast or ball.

Such events are usually held under the guise of a celebration

for a particular event or victory, or even on a religious occa-

sion, but quite often it is the gathering itself that is the true

purpose.  At  these  festivities,  drow  reaf rm  both  alliances

and enmities, take the opportunity to size up the (apparent)

success and wealth of their rivals, and attempt to eavesdrop

on conversations and solicit useful rumors. Overt violence is

frowned upon at such events, but the occasional back-room

murder or poisoning is not unheard of. These parties, though

popular, are rare, since putting that many powerful and com-

peting drow in one place is a recipe for disaster. Most drow are

too paranoid to attend more than one every few years.

Potent wines, brewed from underground fruits, mushrooms,

and fungus, are quite popular among the drow. Almost as well

loved are various herbs and incenses that, when consumed or

burned and inhaled, cause euphoria, hallucinations, or trance

states. Some drow consider these sensations akin to a religious

experience; others simply enjoy them for their own sake or

because they allow for a temporary loss of control and inhibi-

tions. (Not that drow are terribly inhibited to begin with.)

When they go out on the town, as it were, richer and more

powerful drow often enjoy observing a wide variety of events at

the communitys arena. These events include such (relatively)

innocuous spectacles as giant lizard or spider races, though

these often involve the capture of humanoid prey at the end

of  the  course.  Gladiatorial  duels,  though  not  as  popular  as

they  are  in  some  surface  communities,  arise  from  time  to

time. The drow watch plays that reenact famous triumphs,

often with slaves or prisoners forced to act out the parts of

all the characters who dieand who are actually slain in the

course of the performance. They might even gather to watch

a famous torturer practice her art, or the priestesses conduct

a  particularly  creative  sacri ce.  These  events  often  involve

brand-new contraptions with features such as slicing blades

or  dripping  acid.  Or  the  event  might  showcase  a  magical

enhancement that allows the drow to partake of the victims

thoughts  and  memories  as  he  suffers.  All  these  gatherings

attract  traveling  bards,  jugglers,  vendors,  and  anyone  else

seeking to make some coin by amusing the audience. (Those

who fail to amuse their clients sometimes  nd themselves a

part of the next performance.)

The drow have a strong literary tradition, mostly involv-

ing the  ctionalized retelling of historical events or religious

myths. Reading is a popular pastime among drow of all social

statuses,  and  many  seek  to  learn  how  to  succeed  in  life  by

studying their historical and  ctional forebears.

Finally, the drow have several sports and board games in

which  they  compete  against  one  another.  The  sports  often

involve stealth and physical prowess, like a strange combina-

tion of capture the  ag and hide-and-seek. Their most popular

board game is a tactical game called Shelza Ir. It super cially

resembles chess, though the board is far larger. The two oppos-

ing sides do not have an equal number of pieces, but they do

have an equal point value. The more valuable a piece is, the

farther it can move in a turn, and the more unusual maneu-

verssuch as moving diagonally, or jumping other piecesit

can make. When a piece captures an enemy piece, it not only

removes it from the board, it gains a portion of the enemys

value, raising its status to a more powerful piece. Under cer-

tain circumstances, a player can actually capture one of his

own pieces, removing it from the board but granting some

of its points to the victorious piecethus teaching even the

youngest of drow tacticians the bene ts of sacri cing a por-

tion of ones own forces for a larger gain.

ARTS AND CRAFTS

Most drow art incorporates some degree of religious symbol-

ism. It might represent Lolth or some sort of arachnid, or it

might depict a powerful ancestor of the artist. The drow are

fond of abstract weblike patterns, and rarely create landscapes

or still-life images. Even when the images are not abstract, they

are relatively simplistic.

The overwhelming majority of drow art has some three-

dimensional  or  tactile  component;  sculpture,  statues,

embossing, and engraving are all popular. Simple painting

is considered a far lesser art form, a mere intermediary step

toward true artistic ability. Sculptures and paintings both

tend toward black, white, and shades of gray. Color is rare in

drow artwork, for the simple reason that the art is often cre-

ated and/or displayed in the darkness, visible by darkvision

only. When a drow does include color in a piece of art, it is

frequently intended to alter the meaning of the image. For

instance, one famous artist was best known for an image of

drow priestesses sacri cing surface elf maidens clad in grasses,

 owers, and everything else the drow associate with surface

weakness. When viewed in the light, however, what appeared

to be the shadows of the priestesses over the victims turned

out to be the victims skin, as dark as any drows. This suggests

that the artist was equating some drowperhaps a political

rivalwith the elves of the surface.

When they create jewelry, the drow do so to show off wealth

(and power, by extension), not to be attractive. Dark elf baubles

are quite gaudy by surface standards, made of precious metals

and containing far more gemstones than a human or even a

dwarf would feel comfortable with.

Drow architecture is functional  rst, with aesthetics consid-

ered a distant second priority. The primary exception to this

rule is, as might be expected, imagery of spiders and Lolth. All

temples, most public buildings, and many private residences

are  replete  with  such  images,  because  nobody  wants  to  be

accused of being insuf ciently faithful.

Perhaps the strangest of drow art forms is their music. The

children of Lolth enjoy strange, prolonged, wavering sounds that

other races consider unappealing or even uncomfortable. These

often seem atonal at  rst, but when

combined  through  the

proper techniques they produce a symphony of alien, haunting

appeal. The dark elves possess a variety of unique instruments,

including the vazhan-do, a complex lute with sixty-four strings

that can be plucked swiftly for a torrent of notes, or bent slowly,

producing a ghostly wail; and the ezhirkiri, a wind instrument

that transforms the air blowing through it into the sound of

agonized, yet strangely melodic, shrieks.

TECHNOLOGY AND MAGIC

Even though the drow consider magic a normal part of every-

day life, they are also a remarkably high-tech society when it

comes to mundane arts and sciences. These cunning people

know far better than to rely entirely on magic; not all of them

are skilled in that  eld, after all, and as magic-resistant crea-

tures  themselves,  they  know  that  even  the  most  powerful

spellcaster cannot always attain a desired goal.

Much of drow technology is focused on stealth, secrecy, and

miniaturization. It is believed that the drow developed the  rst

hand crossbows, and their arsenal also includes spring-loaded

dagger  sheaths  and  telescoping  blades.  Their  arms,  armor,

and forti cation are based on the same techniques used by

the surface elves (including their penchant for mithral), but

they have evolved to make use of more stonework and heavy

metals  after  generations  underground.  Although  the  drow

appreciate  an  attractive  tool  or  weapon,  they  are  far  more

concerned with functionality and, when appropriate, ease of

concealment, than they are with appearance.

The drow are masters not only of metallurgy, but of stonema-

sonry, engineering, and alchemy as well. They are particularly

skilled at the art of brewing poisons, and a single drow com-

munity might include a wider variety of toxin samples than

an entire nation of surface-dwellers. Many of these poisons

utilize spider venom as their primary ingredient, but venom

extracted from animals, fungi, plants, or any other source is

also a common baseline. As might be expected, the drow are

almost as skilled with antidotes as they are with poisons, and

sometimes the winner of an interhouse con ict is the one

who   rst  comes  up  with  an  obscure  poison  for  which  the

other lacks an antidote.

Many drow throughout the years have been truly

inspired  alchemists  and  inventors.  One  or  more

drow have possessed the secret of spring-and-cog-

driven clocks, tinderless lighters, moveable type,

black powder, and even (brie y) very primitive

steam-powered  pistons.  The  individualist

nature of the drow, combined with their con-

stant  exposure  to  con ict,  inspires  creation

and discovery at almost the rate of the human

racesometimes even faster. Those same fac-

tors prevent drow from sharing their discoveries

with others, and such wonders are frequently lost

when  the  inventors  enemies  learn  of  her  new

innovation  and  strike  before  it  can  be  turned

against them. Every one of the above examples,

and more besides, have been invented over and

over throughout drow history, only to be lost and for-

The drow attitude toward magic is blas, at least as other

races might see it. To the drow, magic is just another science

or art: a part of the world no less natural than any other, albeit

one that follows different rules. The drow make frequent use

of magic in everyday life, putting it to such utilitarian pur-

poses as lighting, transportation, and security, or using it to

their advantage in politics and in war. Other races might use

magic equally as often, but they do not view it as natural the

way the drow do. This idiosyncratic attitude among the drow

likely springs from their innate magical abilities. After all, if

even an untrained and unskilled drow has access to magic, it

must be an ordinary part of the world.

Of course, the fact that the drow are both naturally magi-

cal  and  naturally  resistant  to  magic  causes  them  to  think

that  they  are,  by  de nition,  the  worlds  greatest  magical

practitioners.  This  attitude  leads  to  an  urgency  and  com-

petitiveness  among  their  magical  researchers  that  dwarfs

the machinations of their mundane scientists. Drow are con-

stantly seeking to create (or steal from other races) the next

great spell, one to use against current rivals and intimidate

potential  enemies.  As  borne  out  by  their  technology  and

architecture, the drow are great believers in function over

form. A minor spell thats pretty to look at is valuable only to

entertainers, but a new spell that allows a spy to see through

the eyes of a spider, or rips the kidneys from an enemy, is

truly  worthwhile.  Even  when  researching  and  creating

new spells, however, the drow dont see what theyre doing

as particularly special. They are simply creating new tools,

like any other inventor.

The  drow  appreciate  magic  that  plays  upon  their  racial

strengths and bolster their weaknesses. Spells that increase

their immunities or broaden them to cover effects not nor-

mally subject to spell resistance are popular topics for research.

Similarly, spells that enhance their racial spell-like abilities,

increasing their power and range or transforming them into

other effects, are also frequently subjects of experimentation.

To date, however, the drow have had more success in develop-

ing new techniques of training and concentration along these

paths than they have had in creating new spells. See the New

Feats section, page 47.

The drow see little distinctioncertainly less than other

racesbetween  the  arcane  and  the  divine.  They  acknowl-

edge  that  the  two  forms  of  magic  function  differently,  but

they believe that they ultimately  ow from the same source.

Magic represents the ongoing in uence of the gods (especially

Lolth) in the natural world. Mortals might learn various ways

of manipulating that in uence and harnessing those energies,

but they are, at their core, the same energies. The only reason

the drow favor the divine over the arcane is that the former

requires the grace of Lolth, and thus indicates that its practi-

tioner holds some favor with the goddess.

The drow are enormous believers in the ef cacy of magic

items and weapons, and a large fraction of their casters spe-

cialize in the creation of such goods. Minor magic items are

bought and traded with little fanfare in drow bazaars, treated

like  any  other  commodity.  More  potent  items  are  eagerly

sought by matriarchs, priestesses, and adventurers alike. For

generations,  the  drow  utilized  a  process  that  caused  their

magic  items  to  disintegrate  when  exposed  to  sunlight,  in

the hope of making them less attractive to potential thieves

and  invaders.  This  practice  has  all  but  died  out  in  modern

times, partially because it didnt function as a deterrent, and

also because many drow found their campaigns against the

surface races hampered by the time limits such items placed

on their activities.

A few male arcanists have obtained such a potent mastery

of the mystic arts that they are accorded great respect, and

even  some  true  political  power,  in  drow  society.  Although

the female elite resent such individuals, not even the priest-

hood or the houses are willing to ignore the value a mighty

wizard or sorcerer can offer as an allyor the devastation he

can cause as an enemy.

LOVE

Most of the trappings of love in drow society are better de ned

as either lust or politics. Drow seek to sate physical desires

with whatever partners arouse their attentions; the culture

does not, in any real way, associate sex or reproduction with

love, or even necessarily with marriage. Drow seek to slake

their lust with partners of lower statusso as not to imply

that  they  have  given  in  to  a  drow  of  higher  stationand

rarely with members of an enemy house or family, for fear

of  compromising  their  position.  Beyond  these  limitations,

however, anything goes.

Marriage  is  primarily  a  political  or   nancial  arrange-

ment. Drow marry to formalize alliances, to combine family

resources, orin some casesto cement their dominance

over  a  weaker  ally  or  companion.  No  stigma  is  attached  to

children born out of wedlock, but a child born of a marriage

has a stronger claim to her parents wealth and power if some-

thing happens to the parents. Thus, some drow marry before

procreating,  to  ensure  that  everything  they  have  achieved

remains in the family line.

Most drow marriages are monogamous, not due to moral or

religious doctrine, but because few drow are willing to allow

more than one other individual that close to them on a regu-

lar basis. A few drow marriages do involve multiple partners,

however. These arrangements usually involve a single drow

female taking numerous male partners, but other combina-

tions are not unheard of.

Although such an occurrence is rare indeed, some drow do

fall in love with other drowor, although it happens so rarely

that its practically a myth, members of some other race. For

the drow, who are accustomed to thinking only of their own

good, the sudden urge to consider someone elses well-being is a

strange and frightening experience. Many drow react violently

to love, seeking to destroy the object of their affections before

they are further corrupted by the odd sensations.

Those who dont become violent usually make every effort

to either impress or dominate the object of their affections,

depending on their relative social standing. A drow in love

with someone of a higher status seeks to increase her own

authority, hoping her desired paramour will notice her and

consider  her  worthy  of  an  alliance,  or  at  least  of  increased

socialization. If the smitten drow is of higher status, she often

seeks to acquire the object of her affection as a servant or slave,

for even the most loving drow sees little difference between

intimacy and possession.

The rarest event in drow culture is when two drow share

affection for one another equally. The number of loving part-

nerships throughout drow history can probably be counted on a

single drows  ngers, but they often become an almost unstop-

pable force in society. Two drow willing to combine efforts

and resources to that great a degree, particularly if they have

in uence in different but synergistic areas of society, are potent

indeed. However, because even the most loving drow can never

fully trust one anotherit just isnt in their naturethese rare

couples often fall apart under the weight of betrayal, or even

suspicions of a betrayal that never actually occurred.

WAR

The drow have a saying regarding the waging of war. If you

allow the enemy to strike back, the  rst battle is already lost.

The drow do not believe in large, overt confrontations, with

soldier meeting soldier on the  eld of battle, arrows and spells

 ashing by overhead as spear meets shield and sword meets

sword. Theyll  ght that way if they must, but they greatly

prefer  tactics  that  involve  stealth,  surprise,  multipronged

assaults,  or  sabotageanything  that  allows  them  to  win  a

battle before the foe has an opportunity to retaliate.

Almost  all  drow  learn  the  basics  of  combat  during  their

schoolingthe better to survive in their violent societybut

only  a  few  of  them  study  warfare,  strategy,  and  tactics  to  a

professional  degree.  The  drow  instinct  for  self-preservation

discourages them from becoming career soldiers, so those who

do are valuable commodities: Many obtain surprising amounts

of in uence with a house or the church, or make a good living

as mercenaries. Military of cers train not only in standard tac-

tics of siege and battle eld confrontation, but in techniques of

covert troop movement, counterintelligence, and diversionary

tactics (up to and including the sacri ce of ones own person-

nel).  Drow  tactics  involve  mundane  weapons  and  magic  in

equal measure. If given the resources, they are as likely to use

teleportation as a means of in ltration as anything else. Their

strategies usually involve small, carefully placed strike teams.

These highly skilled units carry out assassination or sabotage,

and often reduce or eliminate the need for a larger force.

When drow do wage war, they focus their might primarily on

the oppositions of cers and rulers, making every effort to behead

the opposing leadership and thus render the army ineffectual.

Barring that, they target supply lines or poison food stores, resort-

ing to direct confrontation only when all else has failed.

Drow  prefer  to  be  the  aggressors  in  any  military  action,

and their strategies are designed with offense in mind. When

faced with an attacking force, they still attempt to make use of

smaller groups as described above, but they are far more likely

to  eld a large force of troopsif only to delay the advance

while their operatives work, or while the drow leaders retreat

to safer, better-hidden locations. Some drow fortresses have

no  viable  mundane  entrance  and  require  magic  to  access.

Although this method of construction makes supplying the

fortress dif cult, many drow have found the effort worthwhile

when an enemy proved incapable of breaking in.

The greatest problem the drow have with  ghting a defen-

sive battle, as opposed to an offensive one, is determining who

is in command of the war effort. Drow do not have standing

armies that answer to the community itself; all military forces

belong to a house, the priesthood, or other private factions. Most

drow attacks are launched by a speci c house, or at the instiga-

tion of the church, and thus have a clear chain of command.

Conversely, more than one drow city has fallen to aggressors

because local houses could not cooperate suf ciently to coor-

dinate their soldiers, even in the face of outside invasion. The

best-defended drow cities have a house (or two) potent enough

to  force  the  others  into  obedience,  or  a  priesthood  strong

enough to assume citywide command for the duration of the

assault. A few forward-thinking communities even have treaties

in effect between the church and the major houses, dictating

who controls what in the event of outside attack.

The majority of drow warfare consists of battle against other

citiesbe they drow or other races. Sometimes, however, the

constant  spying,  sabotage,  and  assassinations  between  rival

houses erupts into civil war within a city. This sort of con ict

can easily destroy an entire community if it is allowed to drag

on; thus, the drow have very strict customs for dealing with civil

wars. If one house can destroy another in a single overwhelming

attack, the community assumes that the victim was weak and

ripe for takeover. In this case, the victorious house is entitled

to the spoils of war, including the resources of the fallen house

and the right to take its surviving members as slaves. Should

a houses offensive fail to destroy another house immediately,

however, the other local houses and the priesthood of Lolth

collaborate to aid the target house in destroying the aggressor.

This action ensures that no civil war lasts longer than a few days

in any drow community, and that no house launches an open

attack on a rival unless it is certain it can win.

The  vast  majority  of  drow  soldiers  (and,  for  that  matter,

hunters and adventurers as well) are males. Female drow have

THE FIGHTING SOCIETIES

Among the fiercest, best trained, and deadliest of drow warriors

are the members of the fighting societies. These forces, divided

into male and female battalions, are the primary military arm of

the Church of Lolth. Each fighting society is made up of units

contributed by the great houses, for use by the priesthood as

it sees fit. This system allows each house to maintain a pres-

ence in the churchs power base, while allowing the church to

maintain an equal balance of power between houses. Officially,

the fighting societies are loyal to the priesthood of Lolth above

all other considerations. In practice, fighting society soldiers

are  rarely  asked  to  participate  in  actions  against  their  native

house, for fear of which way they might turn in such a conflict

of interest. Instead, the fighting societies defend the commu-

nity or enforce church dictates against independent families,

individuals, rogue religious sects, and houses too small to have

contributed soldiers.

other avenues to power that are quicker and relatively safer.

Military rank is one of the few positions of real power available

to male drow, making it a favored goal of the gender. That said,

many drow soldiers, hunters, and adventurers dont necessar-

ily seek authority, but simply relish the opportunity to thrive

away from their domineering female relatives.

For more on how drow conduct themselves in combat, and

on speci c battle tactics, see Drow Tactics, page 42.

Drow who die in disgrace are often hung from the walls of their

homes, dishonoring their families as well

DEATH

Death is not a glorious end to a life of accomplishment. It is

not the doorway to some idyllic paradise in Lolths domain. It

is not a reward of rest earned after centuries of travail. Rather,

death is the ultimate defeat that strips a drow of her hard-earned

position and possessions, granting them to others who are far

less worthy. Death is the fate of prey, not predator; it is the  nal

and eternal declaration of weakness.

The drow instinct for self-preservation is a powerful one.

It  drives  them  to  survive  at  all  costs,  yet  advancement  in

drow society requires riskincluding, at times, the risk of

life itself. Much drow scheming is a careful balancing act, a

measure of risk versus reward. If a schemes failure threatens

death, most drow undertake it only if the bene ts are truly

substantial.  Drow  do  not,  under  any  circumstance,  believe

in self-sacri cebetter to sacri ce a dozen allies than to die

oneself. It can be satisfying to watch an enemy suffer, but true

victory is attained only with that enemys death. Anything less

is transitory. Drow frequently not only slay their rivals but

utterly destroy the bodies, to make any form of resurrection

dif cult if not impossible.

Drow almost never die of old age, and they do not bury or

entomb their dead. Those who do not fall in battle or at the

hands of other scheming drow are often selected as sacri ces

to Lolth. After all, if a high-level drow is growing old, what

greater purpose has she left to serve? Drow who die of old age

or natural causes are considered shamed for their failure to die

in Lolths service. Their bodies are left to rot, or hung from their

familys home with webbing as a sign of disgrace. Many

drow cremate relatives who die in this fashionnot out

of respect, but to hide the evidence.

Undeath

Drow  do  not  inherently  shun  the  undead  as  many

other races do, though they do not particularly enjoy

their company either. They consider undeath a poor

state of existence, since it strips drow of their inher-

ent racial superiority, but they do respect the power

and will of one who is capable of remaining beyond

deaths call.

DROW HISTORY

AND FOLKLORE

Although the drow are nearly as ancient as the surface

elvesor even older, according to one of their various

origin  mythstheir  ancient  history  and  folklore  is

rather sparse. This stems from the fact that drow arent

especially  concerned  with  their  peoples  past,  except

when it in uences their present and future. They study

ancient victories to replicate them, defeats to avoid them,

and famously successful drow to emulate them, but thats

essentially it.

For  all  that,  the  drow  do  have  a  body  of  legend  and

folklore they study and repeat to one another, even if its

smaller than one might expect from so old a race. Many of

their myths are similar to those of the surface elvesalbeit

with  a  different  perspective  attached  to  themand  others

are unique to the drow.

Roleplaying Application: Youre not much interested in

whats gone before, unless you can learn or somehow bene t

from it. When you feel you can gain an advantage by studying

the past, you do so fervently, determined to unearth details

missed by others. You scoff at elves myths and tales, for you

know the truth about such matters.

DROW MYTHIC ORIGINS

It  is  perhaps  unsurprising  that  a  race  as  chaotic  and  wide-

spread  as  the  drow  cannot  agree  on  a  creation  myth.  No

fewer than three such myths vie for dominance throughout

their society. Two of them are somewhat familiar to surface

sages who study the drow, and the third is largely unknown

outside the drow except to a very rare fewsome of whom

believe that the surface elves might themselves have helped

to keep the secret.

All three myths agree on some basic points. In an age before

recorded history, the elves and the drow were one people who

worshiped a pantheon of deities called the Seldarine. Some-

thing happened to sunder the elf nation: an event that tore

both the mortals and their pantheon apart, setting the elves

to dwell in the forests and other natural regions above, while

the drow made their homes in the darkened caverns below.

The elves, of course, have their own version of this tale (which

can be found, among other places, in Races of the Wild). The

drow, depending on their community, family, and individual

preference, believe one of the following.

Expulsion of the Drow

true leadership or guidance among them. One day Lolth (see

sidebar, note 1), strongest and wisest of the elf gods, approached

Corellon Larethian, for he was the most charismatic and con-

vincing of the Seldarine. The other races have not the life span

of our children, she told him, but they grow far, far more

numerous. They are quick to learn and adapt, where our elves

are slow and set in their ways. They are swift to battle, where

our elves seek only the best and most beautiful in life. They are

strong, where our elves are weak. Let us, then, spread wisdom

and skill among the elves. Let us teach them to hold what we

have given them, to not only survive the coming of these new

races but to dominate them, since we always intended them

to be the masters of the world we provided.

But Corellon Larethian was a vain and foolish deity. It was

he  who  had  convinced  the  Seldarine  to  create  the  elves  as

they were, in an image that he preferred, and he was loath to

allow any changes to his creations. He deceived Lolth (see

sidebar, note 2), agreeing to speak to the assembled elf gods,

but when he did so, he launched into an eloquent argument

that the elves should remain exactly as they were. We have

created perfection, he argued, playing upon the vanity of the

other gods just as he puffed up his own. As we are gods to our

children, so far are our children above these other, lesser races.

Let us not allow fear and worry to cloud our judgment. Let us

not sully the perfection we have created by changing our elves,

reducing them to the level of these new beasts.

Lolth raged in fury at the deception, and at the shortsighted-

ness of her fellow gods, but the Seldarine were in agreement,

taken in by Corellons honeyed words, and they would not

heed her warnings.

So Lolth visited her children in secret. Choosing only the

strongest and most skilled among the elves, she taught them

great wisdom behind the backs of the other gods. To them she

granted the gift of skill with bow and blade, that they might

meet  the  orcs  on  the   eld  of  battle;  the  gift  of  deception,

that they might not be at a disadvantage against the  exible

humans;  and  above  all,  the  gift  of  magic,  both  arcane  and

divine, that they might prove dominant over all other races.

She instructed them, too, in the value of survival, in the need

to  ght to keep what was theirs, and in the doctrine of strength

over all. She came in the night to deliver her teachings, and

her followers named themselves duaral (see sidebar, note 3),

In the  rst primeval days of the world, the elves were already

old. They dwelt in the  rst cities, and they watched with curi-

ous and unaging eyes as other races appeared and began to

walk the  elds, climb the mountains, and hunt the great and

endless woods. Among these races were the humans, capable

of  changing  and  adapting  to  almost  any  environment,  and

the orcs, who though bestial were warriors of great strength

and savage cunning.

The gods, too, watched the growth of these other races, and

some grew concerned. They took no action, however, for even

then the elf deities were chaotic and individualistic, with no

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

3  Quite obviously, duaral was the source of the eventual term

drow, though the exact point at which the later evolution of

the word came into common usage is unknown.

SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY ON THE EXPULSION OF THE DROW

1  Note here that in drow mythology, Lolth was always Lolth. The

elves name her Araushnee, and claim she was Correlons

consort before turning to evil, only taking the name Lolth

after the elf/drow schism. The drow, of course, believe none

of that. Lolth was always the strongest and most dominant

of the pantheon, and she was, ever and always, Lolth.

2  Its interesting that Lolth is deceived here, since although the

drow do not consider their goddess infallible, their surviving

mythology  rarely  speaks  of  any  of  her  faults  or  blunders.

Scholars believe that the priesthood (and Lolth herself) has

allowed this event to remain a part of drow legend not to sug-

gest a weakness in the deity, but to always remind the drow

how convincing and conniving Corellon Larethian can be.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

4  This seems to be the biggest logical hole in the drow creation

myth. If the Seldarine had the power to transform the race

physically like this, why did they not simply destroy the drow

utterly? The drow themselves maintain that the gods were too

weak to do so, thatthanks to Lolths grace in those early

daysit  was  all  the  combined  elf  gods  could  do  simply  to

mark their flesh. The elves, of course, would claim that Corel-

lon and the others were too kindhearted to perform such a

vile act, that they hoped even then that the drow would repent

and turn away from their evil goddess.

or Hunters of the Crescent, for the martial skills she offered

and the moon that heralded her coming.

But some among Lolths new followers grew frightened of

the coming war, and ran to the elves still taken in by Corellon

and the Seldarine. What they learned, the gods learned, and

they  grew  angry  at  Lolth  for  her  disobedience,  and  fright-

ened that her duaral might come to dominate elf culture. In

a twist of sheerest irony and arrogance, Corellonwho had

prevented the gods from teaching the elves the arts of war

when the elves were faced with outside threatswas the  rst

to show his children the bow and the blade when the threat

came from one of his own.

But, great Corellon, the elf leaders asked their deity, as they

lifted their swords for war, how are we to know our enemy from

our brothers and sisters? For we all look alike, and you have said

that the traitor Lolth has taught her followers to lie.

This worried the Seldarine greatly, until the goddess Hanali

Celanil,  weakest  and  most  pathetic  of  the  pantheon,  arose.

We shall solve this problem, she said, by marking all those

who are not loyal. For while Lolth is the mightiest among us,

she cannot stop us if we work together. As day is to night, so

shall you be to those who follow the traitor. And the Seldarine

worked their will and wrought great change upon the duaral,

turning their skin from the pale of the elves to black as pitch

(see sidebar, note 4).

The elves of the Seldarine marched against Lolths duaral,

and though the duaral were stronger and more skilled, they

could not stand up to the elves greater numbers. Led by their

goddess, the survivors retreated deep into the caverns beneath

the earth, where the nature-loving elves were too frightened

to follow. And there did they begin to thrive.

The Drow Exodus

This second version of the drow creation myth parallels the

 rst, up until the point where Lolth decides to teach the duaral

behind the backs of the other gods. This narrative picks up

at that point.

Drow  historians  debate  Lolths  motivation  for  what  hap-

pened next. Was she concerned that the other elves would

unite under the banner of the Seldarine and obliterate her

duaral? Or did she simply view those weaker elves as un t to

receive her teaching, and indeed un t for survival? Whatever

the case, before the other elves and the other gods learned of

her actions, Lolth led the duaral away in the middle of the

SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY ON

THE DROW EXODUS

1   It  should  come  as  no  surprise  that  although  surface-

dwellers believe the Expulsion of the Drow is the primary

drow creation myth, drow prefer the Exodus version. It satis-

fies both their own pride, and their faith and fear in Lolth, to

maintain that it was she who chose to lead them from those

who were unworthy, rather than that they were driven out by

the elves.

2   On  a  similar  basis,  the  drow  prefer  to  believe  that  their

physical  appearance  was  a  gift  from  their  own  goddess,

rather than a curse laid upon them by another.

night. They crept from the elf villages and cities, summoned

by a call only they could hear. A trickle became a stream, a

stream became a river, and eventually thousands of Lolths elves

joined one another on the journey to a new home, away from

those who would weaken them (see sidebar, note 1).

To facilitate their ability to hunt in the shadows of night,

and to differentiate them from the feeble elves of the Seldarine,

Lolth wrought a physical change in her followers, transforming

their skin to a light-absorbing ebony (see sidebar, note 2). She

separated the massed duaral into smaller groups, the better to

hide from any elf pursuers, and she chose for them great king-

doms under the earth, where they could grow strong and learn

to rule without the interference of their weaker cousins.

First among Elves

This is the rarest of the drow creation myths, but one that is

catching on swiftly with the younger generations. It mirrors

the Drow Exodus tale, with one fundamental difference.

According to this version of the myth, the elves were ini-

tially an underground race, and when Lolth chose only the

strongest  and  most  skilled  as  her  followers,  they  banished

the weak elves to the surface. Those who espouse this version

claim that all elves originally shared the dark skin of the drow,

and that it was Lolth who cursed the surface elves to appear

as feeble and weak without as they were within.

LEGENDS AND TALES

The majority of drow tales fall into two categories: They either

speak of a great drow who proved victorious through a com-

bination of strength, skill, and devotion to Lolth; of or a drow

who suffered horribly for showing insuf cient strength, skill,

or devotion to Lolth. These are all very much of the If youve

heard one, youve heard them all variety, for though the details

change, the underlying concepts do not.

Still, the drow do retain a few truly mythic tales, stories

that explain aspects of drow physiology or culture, and stories

that speak of great events in the races history. One of the most

commonly told tales of this sort is presented below.

SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY ON

FIRST AMONG ELVES

It seems remarkable that a myth that places the drow in the

dominant position, historically and militarily, hasnt become

the standard for the race, and yet this is by far the least wide-

spread of the drow creation myths. The only theory as to why

this might beor at least the only one that makes sense

suggests  that  the  Church  of  Lolth  deliberately  repressed  it

to maintain the drows resentment of the surface elves. Its

much easier to ignore an enemy youve already defeated, after

all. Eventually, after so many years of suppression, the myth

was all but forgotten, but it has recently been unearthed and

latched onto by a few among the current generation.

It is also worth mentioning that some conspiracy-minded

scholars  believe  that  the  elves  are  aware  of  this  myth,  and

that they too have made efforts to keep its existence secret

from the other surface races. Those scholars cannot help but

wonder: If the elves want such a ridiculous myth kept silent,

perhaps its not quite so ridiculous at all. . . .

The Capture of Zinzerena

One of the greatest heroes of the drow, her deeds still spoken

of and emulated in their cities around the world, was the mys-

terious Zinzerena. An illusionist and assassin of unmatched

skill, she slew at will both personal rivals and those whom

she was hired to dispatch. Her trickery is legendary, and it is

said that her illusions were so realistic and her lies so subtly

woven that she could convince anyone of anything. To this

day, Zinzerena is spoken of almost as a divinity, and indeed

some drow do worship her as a demigod.

There  came  a  day,  however,  when  Zinzerena  was  many

hundreds of years oldaged even for a surface elf, let alone

a drowthat the assassin was hired by a priestess of Lolth

named Acalantra. Acalantra had long coveted the position held

by her older sister, who had obtained higher authority in both

the Church of Lolth and the ranks of their house, whose name

remains untold in any of these tales. Zinzerena knew that a

priestess of Lolth and matriarch of a great house would prove a

challenging target, yet she did not hesitate, for Zinzerena had

never been caught and never been thwarted.

For days, Zinzerena watched

from  afar,  her  senses  aug-

mented  by  her  magics,  and

observed  her  target.  She

learned where the matriarch

went, and when. She saw, as

though they glowed in the

dark, the mystical defenses

that surrounded the house, and

knew that she could stride between

them as easily as a spider navigating its

own web.

When  the  night  came,  and

the matriarch had but recently

returned  from  a  tiring  day

of  rituals,  Zinzerena  swept

through the property. Cloaked

in illusion, wearing the

shadows like a second

skin,  she  passed  the

guards and was not seen.

As though it were  at earth,

she  scaled  the  walls  of  the

great  stone  structure,  and

did  not  slow.  Wires  and

magic both reached out for

the  locks  of  the  window,

from  which  the  matriarch

watched over her property;

she opened it, and was not

heard.

But Zinzerena had been

betrayed, the only way such

a skillful assassin could ever

have been caught. The priestess

who had hired her, and the

matriarch  who  was  her

target,  sought  together

to form a new guild of assassins, and they could not abide so

skilled a competitor for their services. Convincing the priest-

hood that Zinzerena was a threatfor followers of her exploits

had begun to worship herthey drew upon all the resources

the community had to offer in springing their trap.

Created by the church and kept hidden from Zinzerenas

scrying by layers of powerful magics, golems lumbered from

the  shadows  of  the  chambergolems  crafted  of  immense

masses  of  webbing.  Against  such  beings,  all  the  assassins

illusions, all her poisons, all her skills could not help her. By

the betrayal of one whom Zinzerena had no cause to suspect,

the great assassin was  nally laid low.

Wrapped in thick layers of webbing, she was brought by the

golems before the assembled priesthood, including the one who

had hired her. No more will you  out Lolths rule, they told

her, convinced that it was her own intention to set herself up

as rival to the Spider Queen. Soon the name of Zinzerena will

vanish from the lips and the ears of the drow.

But Zinzerena only laughed. You are cowards,

and you are fools, she told them.

It  is  only  your  fear,  and  your

lack  of  faith,  that  makes  you

think that a few awestruck souls who

worship  me  could  ever  threaten

the  Weaver  of  Webs.  And  you

are  a  fool  to  think  that  you

can  truly  slay  Zinzerena.

For  I  am  a  scream  on  the

wind,  a   icker  of  shadow

in the corner of the eye. For

centuries  I  have  come

and  gone,  and  none

have stopped me, nor

even  seen  me  unless

I  wished  it,  for  I  am

illusion.  Try  though  you

might, you can never slay

what you cannot touch.

We can touch you now,

they  replied,  and  we  can

slay you. Then the priest-

esses moved in toward the

assassin, held helpless by

the golems, and tore her

limb from limb.

Yet when the webs set-

tled to the earth, nothing

remained but a few wisps of

black cloth and leather, with

no trace of a body at all.

Zinzerena never appeared

again,  but  neither  did  the

church ever  nd her body.

And  who  knowsper-

haps  she  was  truly  the

insubstantial  illusion

she claimed, now freed

of  physical  form  to

Zinzerena attempts to defend herself while a web golem

approaches from behind

roam the world unhindered. For it was the day after Zinzere-

nas death that the drow  rst discovered the abilities they all

share today: the ability to manipulate darkness and light, the

fundamental basis of all secrecy and all illusion.

DROW SETTLEMENTS

Although a few small drow settlements can be found sporadi-

cally throughout the Underdark, the drow primarily live in

great cities of many thousands of citizens (and thats not even

counting the hundreds of thousands of non-drow slaves). This

tendency might seem to run counter to drow attitudes, given

their  utter  inability  to  trust  one  another,  but  it  is  the  only

arrangement that allows them to seek the power and in uence

they crave. It also allows them to work together against other

denizens of the Underdark, most of whom are either prey or

rivals to the children of Lolth.

Unlike their surface cousins, the dark elves do not pay atten-

tion to the size of their citys population, or declare that a set

number of them must leave if said population grows too large

for available resources. As with all else they do, population

control comes down to survival of the  ttest. If a community

runs low on the necessities of life, the strong take what they

need and the weak are left to starve. Occasionally, con ict over

resources causes stronger houses to drive out weaker ones,

which either die in the lightless depths of the Underdark or

survive to found their own communities.

The drow look for three features when seeking a site for a

new community. First, the region must have adequate natural

resources.  Although  theyre  willing  to   ght  and  struggle  for

survival, the drow arent stupid enough to found a new town in

a region incapable of sustaining them. Fresh water, edible fungi

(or at least the appropriate environment to grow it), and room for

grazing herd animals are all essential. Almost as vital is the pres-

ence of orein accessible veinsfor the forging of weapons and

armor. Mithral is preferred, but the drow settle for usable iron.

Second, the position must be defensible. Enclosed caverns

are optimal in this respect, since they can contain a complex

of streets and passages that is only approachable from a few

select vantage points. In other situations, the drow select areas

suf ciently enormous and open that they can build walls and

forti cations around the city. In either case, only workable

stone (which must be hard and sturdy enough to form a viable

barrier)  suf ces.  The  drow  have  ignored  otherwise  perfect

locations because the local rock was too brittle.

For a time, the drow preferred to make use of natural cham-

bers, modifying them only as much as necessary to produce

viable work and living spaces. For hundreds of years now, how-

ever, they have tended more toward open areas that allow them

to construct their own buildings. This allows them to shape the

structures exactly as needed, and serves as yet another symbol

of their dominance over their own environment.

Finally, the area must allow room for expansion. Whether

through procreation or the acquisition of slaves and captives,

the drow know that any given community must grow, lest it

fall stagnant and perish. This last is the most variable of the

three requirements, since a community of only a few hun-

dred can safely assume that it will never expand as far as the

greatest drow cities.

The drow are still quite happy, however, to inhabit a con-

quered city built by another race. Although the buildings of

(for instance) the duergar or the illithids are rarely built to

drow speci cations, the drow enjoy the symbolism inherent

in  occupying  someone  elses  territory.  Over  the  course  of

time, they tear down existing structures and use the material

to rebuild to their liking, slowly transforming someone elses

domain into their own.

Although  they  can  vary  dramatically,  drow  communi-

ties  have  certain  features  in  common.  First  and  foremost,

each contains a temple of Lolth. This is the largest and most

intimidating building in the community, as well as one of the

most defensible. Drow communities also include an arena,

amphitheater, or some other platform on which they can stage

sporting events, performances, and sacri ceswhich are, at

times, one and the same. Beyond these two landmarks, the

details of homes, the estates of the great houses, forti cations

for the training and housing of soldiers, and stores for vendors

are all community-speci c.

The drow dont bother lighting some sections of their cities

at all. Their 120-foot darkvision is, given the cramped con nes

and limited lines of sight in these underground communities,

more than suf cient for them to function normally. In fact, it

gives the drow a distinct advantage over other races in their

cities, since the slaves and merchants of many surface races

have no darkvision at all, and most underground races cannot

see as far in the dark as the drow can. In those areas that other

races  frequent,  such  as  markets,  or  in  those  rare  locations

where line of sight extends beyond 120 feet, the drow make

use primarily of magical light sources. Torches and lanterns

see use on an occasional basis, but they are not viable in regular

practice, because the smoke and soot accumulate dangerously

fast in all but the largest caverns.

For a sample drow community, see Chapter 7, which details

the infamous city of Erelhei-Cinlu.

ECONOMY

The drow economy consists of three separate yet inextricably

intertwined  systems  of  exchange,  each  of  which  is  largely

speci c to a particular social and political caste.

When dealing with drow of a lower station, such as when

a matriarch or priestess purchases goods from a vendor, the

race makes use of coinagejust as do most surface dwellers.

Gold, silver, and other precious metals have roughly the same

buying  power  in  drow  communities  as  they  do  elsewhere,

though the rate of exchange varies somewhat based on avail-

able metals, scarcity of resources, and the mood of the drow

doing the shopping. The drow rarely mint their own coins,

preferring to make use of foreign monies brought in by outside

traders or taken in raids on other races. On those rare occa-

sions when they do mint coins, the results are exceptionally

plain, either totally unadorned or stamped with the signs of

Lolth and/or the house who produced them. The drow also

use coins when trading with others, unless the foreigner has

something of particular interest to sell.

2/22/07   3:02:19 PM

Although one low-ranking drow might use coins to pur-

chase goods or services from another low-ranking drow, the

standard form of exchange between relative equals is a system

of barter. A swordsmith might offer the neighboring baker a

new blade in exchange for a few weeks worth of bread. A cleric

might heal a wounded soldier, if the soldier in turn agrees to

kill someone to whom the cleric owes a debt. A priestess might

perform a marriage ceremony in exchange for several barrels

of   ne  lichen  wine  and  a  potion  of  invisibility.  At  the  upper

levels of society, drow might trade slaves, individually or by

the dozens, in exchange for exotic animals, valuable works of

art, or access to a fertile mushroom farm.

The third practice, common only among the drow elite, is

the exchange of favors. This system creates a web of debts and

obligations that often stretches across the entirety of the house

and church leadership, frequently binding drow to complete

strangers by only one or two steps. A typical agreement of this

sort might resemble the following: If you ally with me to pre-

vent the Matron of House Inlindl from gaining control of the

northern trade route, I will owe you a great favor in exchange.

The interesting thing about this system of boons is that drow

actually prefer to pay off their debts as soon as possible. For a

drow, having too many obligations hanging over ones head is

tantamount to political and social suicide. She cannot afford

to directly challenge anyone to whom she owes a great favor,

for fear of that favor being called in and ruining one of her

ongoing schemes. Additionally, high-caste drow often trade

favors to third parties, meaning that a matriarch might  nd

herself suddenly obligated to someone with whom she would

never willingly have cooperated, or even someone she doesnt

know. One might imagine that the drow would simply ignore

these commitments, but despite their sel sh nature, very few

actually do so. They know that if they refuse to acknowledge

a legitimate debt, word will spread swiftly and nobody will

deal with them in the future. They might even  nd the other

houses turning against them, seeking to eliminate the threat

to the system and the status quo.

Not even enlightened self-interest is always enough to keep

the drow honest, so a wise dark elf making one of these deals

often demands the exchange of promise tokens. These are small

baubles or pendants, often made of silver, that are engraved with

the symbol of the drows family or house. They are often also

marked invisibly, such as with the arcane mark spell. If a drow

refuses to honor a debt, the creditor might present the promise

token as evidence of the arrangement when besmirching her

name and seeking redress. Of course, its not impossible to fake

a promise token, but their frequent usage does make reneging

on a debtor making one upsomewhat dif cult.

APPEARANCE

The drow closely resemble surface elves in terms of physical

build, though they are often even slimmer. Some appear wiry,

muscled like a gymnast, and others are truly slender, some-

times to the point of gauntness. They boast the same pointed

ears  and  almond-shaped  eyes  as  other  elves,  though  their

features are slightly more re ned and attractive than those of

their surface cousins. Additionally, the drows constant pursuit

of physical perfection has bred a lot of the  awsbut also a

lot of varietyout of the race.

All drow have black skin. This is not the dark hue common

to  some  humans,  but  true  black,  the  color  of  onyx  or  pure

darkness. Skin tone varies only slightly from individual to

individual, perhaps appearing a shade lighter on one, or faintly

violet-tinged  on  another  when  viewed  under  very  bright

light; in any case, these distinctions are both subtle and rare.

The drow show a little more variety in their hair color. Stark

white is most common by far, but other pale shades such as

light gray, silver, platinum blonde, and even the occasional

faint golden blonde exist as well. Some male drow (roughly

one in ten) are capable of growing facial hair, and often wear

elaborate  mustaches  and/or  goatees.  Most  drow  wear  their

hair  long,  though  many  soldiers  choose  to  crop  itor,  in

rare cases, to shave baldto avoid providing easy handholds

for the enemy.

Eye color varies about as much as hair: Red, white, purple,

green, and gold all appear with roughly equal frequency (red

being, perhaps, slightly more common than the others).

Adult drow range from 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh

between 85 and 130 pounds. Females are usually slightly taller

and heavier than males, though the differences are minuscule

enough, on the average, to be hardly noticeable.

CLOTHING

If the drow are known for anything as much as their cruelty,

cunning, and sel shness, it is their penchant for dressing in

ways that other races would  nd revealing at best and positively

scandalous at worst. In point of fact, only a portion of drow dress

in such a provocative manner, and it has less to do with sensual-

ity than it does with yet another show of social dominance.

Drow notions of modesty are, essentially, defensive. Cloth-

ing is a protection, not merely against temperature and the

environment,  or  (in

the  case  of  armor)

against attack, but also

against  a  perception

of  weakness.  A  drow

who is not physically

perfect  dresses  to

hide her  aws, lest her

rivals humiliate her or

even take advantage of

her  shortcomings  in

combat.

Thus,  drow  who

feel they have more to

hide  dress  in  greater

amounts  of  clothing.

Those  who  are  con -

dent in their physical

appearance,  or  who

are  powerful  enough

personally and politi-

cally that they do not

fear  public  mockery,

dress in far less. Even

though its not always

accurate  to  say  that

the  skimpiness  of  a

drows clothing corre-

lates directly with that

drows social standing,

such does frequently prove to be the case. On the other hand, a

drow slave might dress scantily because that is what his master

demands, so it is never safe to make assumptions.

Of course, though drow fashion does not have its roots

in sexuality, that doesnt mean the drow ignore its sexual

repercussions. Powerful drow females are well aware of the

effect they have on malesboth drow and othersand are

more than willing to use sensuality and seduction to their

advantage. To the drow, physical attraction and even intimacy

are  more  tools  in  their  arsenal.  The  drow  are  attracted  to

physical perfection and to strengthas well as to political

and social powermeaning that those drow who feel safe

dressing provocatively are the ones more likely to attract an

interested mate anyway. This combination of scanty dress

and drow aesthetics often leads others to believe that the race

as a whole is wanton and sexually indiscriminate, when in

fact most drow are particular about those with whom they

choose to become intimate.

The speci c nature of drow garb is based primarily on what

resources the Underdark makes available. Fabrics like those

used  by  surface  races  are  largely  unknown  in  the  lightless

depths below. Most drow garments consist of gossamerlike

materials made of webbing, fabrics composed of mushroom

 bers or animal hair, metal or bone buttons and buckles, and

most  commonlyleather.  Leather  is  the  favored  material

because it is the most readily available, and because it provides

the  greatest  degree  of  protection  and  strength.  Web-based

garments  are  re-

stricted primarily

to the wealthy, and

are  often  partly

t r a n s p a r e n t 

these  prov ide

little  protection

or  modesty,  but

rather serve exclu-

sively as a surface

on which to hang

jewels  and  other

adornments.

All  but

the

most   imsy  and

transparent  of

drow  clothing

contains  at  least

one  small  con-

cealed  pocket  or

compartment,  in

which the wearer

can hide a weapon,

emergency funds,

poison, spell com-

ponents,  or  some

other secret item.

Since  many  pow-

erful  drow  wear

little  at  all,  they

have become quite creative in positioning these secret pockets,

often sliding items between layers of leather or positioning

them high on the back, beneath the hair.

Roleplaying Application: Moderate how you dress based

on your physical abilitiesor at least your perception of your

physical abilities. This attitude doesnt in any way make you

foolish. You dress functionally,  rst and foremost, protecting

yourself as needed against weather, the environment, or inju-

ries in combat. When no such defenses are necessary, however,

your sense of fashion might well shock your companions, and

might even stir social trouble in other communities until you

learn local mores and customs of modesty.

GROOMING

Drow are scrupulous groomersyet another symptom of their

obsession with strength, perfection, and dominance. Those

capable of doing so make use of cantrips and other magical

means to keep themselves clean and blemish-free. Those with-

out access to such tools use strong soaps made from mildly

Like other races, drow dress differently as a mark of status

acidic fungi, scrubbing themselves with  stfuls of webbing,

coarse animal hair brushes, or even pumice.

Combs made of bone, precious metals, or the mandibles of large

spiders are commonly used for hair maintenance. Most drow wear

their hair straight or held back by a simple tiara or hairpins, but

some prefer elaborate braids. (It is not uncommon for drow to use

hairpins sharp and strong enough to double as stilettos, or even to

make use of small wands as hairpins.) The wealthy use alchemical

liquids to clean their teeth, swishing them about as food particles

and dead skin are dissolved away, while the poor use picks and

brushes made of tiny lengths of bristly spider hair.

Because they are often at their most vulnerable when bath-

ing, the drow often bathe with groups of family members, or

have (relatively) trusted servants assist them.

LANGUAGE

It surprises many foreigners to learn that the drow do not have

their own language. Rather, they speak Undercommon and

various dialects of Elven that (though clearly the same lan-

guage) are different in accent, tone, and nuance from surface

Elven. There are many theories as to why the drow havent

developed their own unique language. One hypothesis is that,

due to their long life span, they havent been separate from

other elves long enough for their language to more thoroughly

evolve. Alternatively, the drow inability to cooperate reliably

in large groups might have prevented them from developing

their own terminology.

Despite  this  fact,  drow  communication  is  often  initially

forth in the middle of a conversationor even the middle of

a sentenceif they feel that one language conveys the proper

nuance or emphasis better than the other. Additionally, when

creating new terms for objects, creatures, or other items not

covered by either existing language, they often combine the

grammatical  and  phonetic  rules  of  both.  The  result  is  that

the drow frequently speak a pidgin combination of the two

tongues that might, generations in the future, form the basis

of an actual drow language.

On  those  rare  occasions  when  they  speak  with  surface

elves,  the  drow  customarily  refuse  to  speak  Elven,  despite

their    uency  in  the  language.  They  prefer  forcing  the  sur-

face-dwellers to learn and understand Undercommonyet

another small sign of dominance.

DROW PHRASEBOOK

The  following  phrases  and  idioms,  common  to  drow  cul-

ture, make use of both Elven and Undercommon. Drow PCs

might wish to use these where appropriate, using either the

actual  Elven/Undercommon  or  the  English  translation,  as

they prefer.

Inorum loathi, uvrastes. In darkness, there is opportunity.

This, one of the greatest of drow axioms, admonishes them

to always be on the lookout for the advantage.

Su lidos verith. This phrase literally translates as Only the

strong survive, but it has a different connotation from that

phrase  as  used  by  humans.  When  used  by  the  drow,  this

expression reverses cause and effect: It might more accurately

be translated as Those who survive are strong.

Resilsh  nielquosthos  nilt  resilsh. Help  unasked  for  is  never

help.  (Alternative  translation:  Help  freely  offered  is  not

free.) This is a simple admonishment to watch for ulterior

motives.

Alrenas Lolthu, nilos dulhar. Before Lolth, all are weak. A

common religious invocation, but also a maxim that essen-

tially means Nobody is perfect. Often used as an excuse for

ones own failure, or as a backhanded way of mocking another

drow for failing.

Nilodi  orhastho  shiorell  e  farul.  Literally,  Weakness  is  the

spawn of contentment and affection. This is a common drow

admonishment against growing too happy with ones station,

or too fond of the people who share it.

Artolth nilat unelte nilt peralath. A spider without a web is no

hunter. One who goes unprepared into any endeavor cannot

expect, and does not deserve, success.

DROW NAMES

Although a drows own name is of vital importance to her,

parents  are  often  relatively  careless  in  assigning  names  to

their  offspring.  Thus,  many  drow  choose  to  take  on  a  new

name upon reaching adulthood.

The random name generator presented here is intended to

demonstrate a range of potential name choices. Feel free to

invent your own names using from the table entries.

Each drow name consists of a pre x and one or more suf-

 xes. If a suf xs use differs based on the gender of the drow,

the standard form is considered the feminine, and the mas-

culine is given in parentheses.

DROW SIGN LANGUAGE

Initially developed as a series of quick signals and commands

for use by military bands sneaking through enemy territory,

the drow system of signs has developed into a complex lan-

guage all its own. Though it is not as varied or expressive as

most spoken languages, it is capable of conveying a surprising

array of complex concepts in a relatively short time.

The meaning of a word is indicated by the patterns formed by

the hands and  ngers. Tense and subject/object links are con-

veyed through the precise angle of the hands from the speaker,

and emphasis and emotion are conveyed through facial expres-

sion  and  body  language.  This  makes  Drow  Sign  Language

dif cult to interpret if one is not the intended recipient.

Interestingly enough, many of the hand and  nger motions

of Drow Sign Language are exceedingly close to those that

make up the fundamental basis of arcane somatic components.

It is unclear whether this was a deliberate choice back when

the language was  rst being developed, or was simply a natural

outgrowth of the fact that many drow are arcanists and were

most comfortable with those motions.

The drow have a written version of Drow Sign Language

that consists of simple dot-and-line arrangements that vaguely

imitate  the  positions  of  the  hands  and   ngers.  This  picto-

graphic script is less detailed and comprehensive than the sign

language on which it is based, but it is more than suf cient to

convey essential information, such as a warning about a hazard

or directions for a following column of soldiers.

DROW AND OTHER RACES

No other sentient race considers the drow to be friends. They

stand  alone  in  the  world,  and  would  have  it  no  other  way.

Some hate the drow as bitter foes, some fear them as mad-

dened slavers and conquerors, and some simply resent them

for being . . . different.

The  drow,  in  turn,  feel  a  racewide  disdain  for  all  non-

drow, seeing them as inferior beings good only as slaves or

sacri ces.

Although they look down on other races, the drow arent

idiots. Their disdain and hatred is, where appropriate, moder-

ated by an understanding of the abilities of the race in question.

The drow might view the illithids as an inferior race, but that

doesnt mean they dont acknowledge the dangers a commu-

nity of mind  ayers can pose. The drow are even willing to

work with other races when necessary, if doing so brings them

closer to a goal or if open con ict would be too devastating

for the drow community to survive.

ABOLETHS

The drow arent entirely sure what to make of the aboleth.

When  it  comes  to  other  humanoid  or  arachnoid  races,  the

dark elves can, at least to an extent, envision what it is they

want, and what they can offer the drow as slaves or victims.

The  aboleths,  however,  have  alien  patterns  of  thought  and

rule an aquatic environment in which the drow have neither

the interest nor the ability to function. If circumstances were

different,  the  drow  would  be  content  to  simply  ignore  the

presence of aboleth entirely.

Unfortunately for the drow, the aboleths take their slaves

and minions from the same races the drow seek to conquer, and

even from the drow themselves. Accustomed to their power to

intimidate their foes, the drow are disconcerted when faced

with aboleth minions, who are often so thoroughly magically

dominated  that  they  feel  no  fear  of  anything.  Further,  the

notion of becoming a slave to such a horri c being, of having

their  free  will  stripped  and  their  opportunities  to  advance

stolen,  lls the drow with intense dread. Thus, they avoid the

aboleths when they can, negotiate agreements to stay out of

each others way where possible, andwhen con ict becomes

inevitablestrike fast, strike hard, and then run like hell.

ARANEAS

The drow see the araneas as betrayers of Lolth. Some believe

the araneas are like dridersa race of beings that were for-

merly drow, until they were hideously transformed for failing

the  Spider  Queen.  Others  maintain  that  the  araneas  were

Lolths  rst attempt at creating life, before she hit upon the

perfect design that became the drow. Whatever a given drow

believes,  however,  she  knows  that  the  araneas  do  not  now

worship  the  Weaver  of  Webs,  making  them  weak-minded

fools as well as traitors.

Still, the drow make use of aranea abilities when they can.

Powerful drow constantly seek aranea slaves, and offer prime

treasures or even political favors to those who provide them.

Others are willing to swallow their bile and hire or cooperate

with an aranea to achieve a particular goal, frequently plan-

ning to betray the creature afterward.

2/22/07   3:02:26 PM

For their part, the araneas hate the drow with a blazing fury

uncommon  to  these  relatively  passionless  creatures.  They

resent the drows innate assumption of superiority, as well as

their tendency to make slaves of the araneas when they can

and to slaughter them when they cannot. Still, the araneas are

sel sh beings, and if the offer is good enough, they will work

with the drow as readily as they will with others.

DRIDERS

The  ultimate  symbols

of Lolths whim, these

hybrid  horrors  long

shared  a  mutual

loat hi ng  w it h

their  drow  rela-

tives.  The  drow

viewed  them  as

worthless beings,

failures  in  the  eyes

of Lolth and reminders

of the drows own falli-

bility. The driders, in

turn, despised those

who drove them from

their  former  homes,

stripping  them  of

any  possibility  of

advancement  in  the

society  from  which

they came. The best a

drider could hope for,

if  it  was  unfortunate

enough  to  encoun-

ter the drow after its

transformation, was a

quick death. More often,

enslavement or torture was the result.

In recent years, however, this attitude has begun to shift,

particularly within the current generation of up-and-coming

drow. Breaking free of the shackles of tradition, and seeking

advantages their forebears would never consider, these drow

have  taken  stock  of  drider  abilities.  Their  transformation

might have been a punishment from Lolth, but it also grants

them substantial physical and mystical power. Is it possible

that while Lolth was castigating an individual, she was also

granting a favor to the community as a whole? That a drow

who proved too weak on his own could be a workable tool for

other drow strong enough to seize and wield it?

These drow have made overtures to the exiled driders, offer-

ing them an opportunity to belong once again. Obviously, they

cannot regain their prior status and can never be considered

the equal of true drow, but they can  ll the roles of favored

servants and agents, with powers and privileges greater than

other non-drow in the community. The driders, of course, are

greatly suspicious of this sudden shift in attitude, but a few

have taken the drow up on the offerand found it, in many

cases, preferable to eking out a lone and savage existence in the

wilds of the Underdark. Should this pattern continue, mem-

bers of the younger generation of drow might  nd themselves

at the head of sizable bands of driders, eagerly champing at

the bit for a chance at revenge against the entrenched drow

power structure that drove them out.

DUERGAR

The drow consider the duergar slow, weak-willed, and unimagi-

native, while the duergar think of the drow as undisciplined,

temperamental,  and

intrusive.  Moreover,

the dark elves and

the  gray  dwarves

frequently  com-

pete for territory,

making  con icts

bet ween

t he

two

relatively

common.  A l-

though  the  drow

emerge victorious

from a majority of

these  encounters,

it is a majority only

by  the  slimmest

of  margins.  They

have been forced,

almost  despite

to

themselves,

recognize the mil-

itary  abilities  of

the duergar. Their

rigid thought pat-

terns,  combined

with their stamina, make

them favored slaves of the

drow.  For  their  own  part,

however, the duergar rarely take drow slaves, seeing them as

uncontrollable and preferring instead to kill them outright.

ELVES

Utter loathing. Absolute, searing, indomitable hatred. The

drow  despise  other  elves  with  a  passion  almost  unimagi-

nable  by  other  (saner?)  races.  Some  drow  raids  on  surface

communities have no other purpose than to slay elves, and

a drow will go out of her waysometimes even endanger-

ing an ongoing agendato harm an elf. Drow rarely take

elf slaves, preferring to kill them on sight or offer them as

sacri ces to Lolth, and on the rare occasions they do take an

elf as a slave, it is often for no greater purpose than regular

abuse and torment.

The elves, of course, return this hatred in equal measure.

Being more inclined to good, they rarely make a deliberate

effort to  nd drow to  ght. When the drow make themselves

available, however, the normally peaceful elves are more than

happy to nock their arrows and unsheathe their blades. The

elves antipathy for orcs, or the dwarves hatred for goblins, is

as nothing compared to the burning abhorrence these cousins

feel for one another.

95726720_Ch01.indd   41

2/22/07   3:02:28 PM

HUMANS

The drow dont have a uni ed opinion on humanity. This is

the only species the dark elves  nd as unpredictable as them-

selves. The short human life span and lack of innate mystical

abilities inclines the drow to think them weak, but they also

recognize that humans are more adaptable to environments

and  circumstances  than  any  other  humanoids.  Perhaps

because of that life span, many of them are truly dedicated to

a cause or a deityequals of the drows most fervent Lolth-

worshipers. But others are easily swayed by promises of wealth

and power. (The drow, naturally, prefer to deal with the latter

type.) Humans make some of the best slaves, but they are also

among the most dif cult to control and frequently require

execution before they can be worked to death.

The drow consider humanity a young race, and some worry

what humans might accomplish if they are allowed to grow

into the wisdom and experience currently possessed by some

of the longer-lived species. Their solution, of course, is to either

destroy or enslave the race before that happens.

ILLITHIDS

If  the  drow  fear  any  race  as  thoroughly  as  the  aboleths,  it

must be the mind  ayers. The illithids are almost as alien,

and  they  too  threaten  the  drow  with  the  most  horri c  of

fates: the complete loss of personal identity and control. Even

a drow who is a slave to another drow has, if she is clever, the

potential to advance her position. A drow mentally bound to

a mind  ayer, however, is nothing but a husk, and possibly an

eventual meal. As strong as their self-preservation instinct is,

most drow prefer death to such a fate.

That said, the drow do more frequently come into contact

with the illithids, because the two races sometimes compete

for territory. This rivalry often results in raids and skirmishes,

but on various occasions these races have found reason and

methods for cooperating with each other. The mind  ayers

sometimes  advise  the  drow,  and  use  their  powers  to  keep

otherwise unruly drow slaves docile and under control. In

exchange, the drow offer the illithids crafted items and slaves

the drow no longer need, on whom the illithid can feed. These

arrangements  are  often  shaky,  each  side  viewing  the  other

with intense distrust. Neither race wants all-out war, however.

The drow fear their fates at the hands (and tentacles) of the

illithids, while the mind  ayers recognize that the drow are

heavily resistant to many of their mental abilities.

The illithids, it should be noted, do not view the drow as

much more valuable than any other nonillithid race. So far

as they are concerned, the drow must and will eventually be

enslaved and consumed, just like everyone else. Theyre simply

prepared to leave the drow for last.

OTHER SUBTERRANEAN RACES

So far as the drow are concerned, every other underground

race is a nuisance: a competitor for space and resources. The

only difference is whether or not a race can prove useful. Sev-

eral drow communities have, at times, worked hand-in-claw

with the kuo-toa, so the drow avoid taking too many of that

strange race as slavesat least for the time being. They  nd

nonduergar dwarves intractable, and though they make slaves

of them when they can, they often prefer simply to exterminate

them. The same holds true for svirfneblin (deep gnomes) and

kobolds, who are too physically frail to make good workers,

though drow do sometimes take them alive for entertainers

or messenger slaves. The dark elves favor the use of orcs and

grimlocks as slaves, when this is possible. Accustomed to life

underground, quite strong, and not overly intelligent, they

make the perfect soldiers and manual laborers.

Again, the drow arent idiots: They know better than to  ght

a war on multiple fronts, or to take on an obviously superior

opponent. They refrain from bothering plenty of non-drow

communities  (or  at  best  make  only  the  occasional  stealthy

raid), and are even willing to engage in trade and commerce

with gnomes, kobolds, and the like, if such is the best way

for their community to thrive. Inevitably, however, they seek

ways  to  turn  these  situations  to  their  advantage,  and  grow

strong for the day when conquering their neighbor becomes

a viable possibility.

OTHER SURFACE RACES

When the drow think of other surface races at all, they dismiss

them as worthless nuisances. They consider gnomes to be  ighty

dabblers in powers far beyond their control, goblins to be foolish

brutes (albeit valuable as slave labor), and hal ings to be pests

of the highest order who should be slaughtered on sight. Even

though the drow are willing to take slaves from anywhere, they

do not go out of their way to take prisoners from these surface

races, as they do from those who dwell in the depths. If some

are foolish enough to wander below, or if they get in the way

of a drow surface raid, then yes, theyll  nd themselves spitted

on a drow blade, strapped to an altar of Lolth, or wearing the

brand of a drow ownerbut for the most part, the drow have

more important concerns than what these foolish creatures are

doing hundreds and thousands of feet above them.

Roleplaying Application: Whether or not you hold the

racial attitudes common to your people is a major aspect of your

personality. If you do, these beliefs certainly drive your behav-

ior when dealing with members of other races. If you do not,

why? Have you seen or experienced something that convinced

you of the error of drow racial opinions? And if so, do you hide

your beliefs from other drow, or have you taken the (dangerous)

step of trying to convince others of their mistakes?

DROW TACTICS

As mentioned above, drow avoid direct confrontation when

they can. They prefer lightning raids, ambushes, sabotage, and

assassination to battle eld combat. In their eyes, the best battle

is not merely one in which they were victorious, but in which

the enemy never had a chance to strike back. Two primary fac-

tors drive this philosophy, which is common to almost all drow

military minds despite the races individualistic nature.

First, these techniques allow the drow a far greater chance

of  victory.  Like  all  elves,  drow  lack  the  physical  hardiness

and  Constitution  of  other  races.  They  tire  more  swiftly,

and they can be slain more easily. Assuming equal skill and

equal numbers, the drow are at a disadvantage in a drawn-

out, straightforward melee. In addition, their darkness ability

allows them to sow chaos and confusion, opening up the per-

fect opportunity to launch a surprise assault, and their high

range of darkvision combined with their heightened Dexterity

makes sniping a most attractive option.

The second and more in uential factor is the drow instinct

for self-preservation. Every enemy that is cut down without

the chance to strike back means one less blade, bow, or spell

that might take the life of a drow. The drow are not necessarily

cowards, but they are absolutely and ruthlessly pragmatic. The

notion of honorable combat or a fair  ght is alien to most of

them, and those who have been introduced to the concept  nd

it both repellent and foolish. Any tactic that offers the drow a

chance at victory with minimal danger to themselves is worth

considering, no matter how brutal, horri c, or convoluted it

might be. And, as always, although a commander would rather

sacri ce her non-drow minions than other drow, she happily

sacri ces other drow to protect her own life.

Although  the  speci cs  vary  by  community  and  circum-

stance, traditional drow tactics frequently involve one or more

of the following elements.

Minions: The drow prefer to let others do their  ghting for

them, and the average drow army consists of only a few actual

drow in of cer and special operative positions. The remainder

is composed of minions, hired soldiers, and slaves, from orcs

to troglodytes, goblins to humans. The drow make use of these

minions primarily as foot soldiers to overwhelm the enemy,

and as disposable fodder to absorb spells and attacks that might

otherwise threaten the drow themselves. The drow respect a

military mind skilled enough to return with the bulk of her

army intact, but no particular stigma is attached to losing many

or even most of ones non-drow soldiers. Throwing them away

unnecessarily  is  considered  wasteful,  but  no  more  so  than

disposing of ammunition or other supplies.

When possible, the drow prefer to make use of their min-

ions racial advantages. Orcs and bugbears, for instance, are

used as shock troops in situations when their great strength

can come into play. Duergar and other dwarves are used as the

vanguard after long marches, or as protection for other forces,

taking full advantage of their resilience. Goblins and kobolds

make  excellent  scouts,  while  hobgoblins  are  frequently

assigned to special operations or even made subcommanders

beneath drow of cers.

Whatever the case, these creatures can all be certain of one

thing: Where a dangerous enemy lurks, it is they, and not their

of cers, who will feel the brunt of its attacks.

Beasts: Although less popular than humanoid slaves, other

beasts of burden and war make frequent appearances in drow

battle tactics. The most common of these are, unsurprisingly,

monstrous spiders. The drow train them to ambush speci c

targets, or even to serve as mounts, in the case of some larger

specimens. Entire orders of drow knights train in techniques

of mounted warfare that take full advantage of the spiders abil-

ity to walk on any surface at a consistently high speed.

Other  techniques  gaining  popularity  include  the  use  of

roth  or  giant  lizard  stampedeswith  mounted  drow  on

strategically placed beasts throughout the herdand, in a few

instances, the use of elite squads mounted on Large (advanced)

basilisks. These specially bred creatures are  tted with leather

head coverings that include red crystal lenses over the eyes.

These lenses are not, in and of themselves, suf cient to blot

out their petrifying vision. The drow who ride them, however,

wear full-head helms with green lenses in the visors. The color

combination creates an opaque brown that blocks line of sight,

and thus renders the riders safe from the gaze attacks of their

mounts. The drow either shatter their petri ed opponents, or

carry them back home where they can be restored by priest-

esses or wizards and then put to work as slaves.

Blitz Attacks and Swift Retreats: Whether its a light-

ning raid on a surface community, a group assassination, or an

unavoidable direct battle, the drow prefer to strike hard, strike

fast, and then vanish. Prolonged confrontation is the worst

possible military situation for them. When possible, they have

speci c goals laid out in advanceoften assigning objectives

to individual operatives and groupsand they remain on the

 eld only as long as they must to accomplish those goals, or

until it becomes clear that they cannot.

At  least,  this  is  the  theory.  In  practice,  the  pride  and

arrogance  of  many  drow  prevents  them  from  declaring  an

operation a failure and aborting when they should, leading

to precisely the sort of prolonged battle they wished to avoid.

Wise and experienced drow, however, know that their best bet

is to attempt to crush the opposition with a single overwhelm-

ing or strategically placed strike, and then withdraw whether

or not they succeeded.

It  is  during  these  retreats,  either  when  an  objective  has

been achieved or the drow commander has decided an attack

has failed, that many of the non-drow soldiers are sacri ced.

Drow frequently order units to remain behind and continue

 ghting, as if they were still working toward a particular goal.

This tactic not only covers the escape of the of cers, it often

prevents the enemy from realizing that the battle, so far as the

drow are concerned, has ended.

As the drow see it, military and political assassination is

just another form of this quick strike philosophy. Remove an

enemys command structure, and youve removed his ability to

mount a coordinated war effort. The drow make every attempt

to identify enemy leaders, and they deliberately target them

both in combat and for assassination off the battle eld.

Poison: The drow are known far and wide for their use of

poisons, and it is a skill they have elevated to a cultural art form.

The drow rarely, if ever, poison the weapons of their non-drow

soldiers, reserving such advantages for themselves.

Among  adventurers,  the  drow  are  most  well  known  for

their sleep poisons, which they use to coat the bolts of their

hand crossbows. This is a favored tactic of sentinels; however,

the drow rarely employ it in full-scale war, preferring more

reliable and deadly techniques. Only if an objective speci -

cally involves taking a target alive do they bother with sleep

poisons in military operations.

Spells: Every drow  ghting force worth its salt contains at

least a few wizards, clerics, or other casters. Although the precise

nature of the spells used varies, the drow would no sooner con-

sider going to war without spells than they would without swords

or armor. Drow war-casters rarely bother with spells whose func-

tion is to take out a single foe, unless they expect to face a lone

champion. They prefer spells to hide, protect, or strengthen their

own troops (thus making them more effective), or area spells to

obliterate many of the enemy at once. A favored drow tactic is to

drop Will-based area effects onto crowds that include both the

enemy and other drow, counting on the drow combination of

spell resistance and superior Will saves to protect them.

Contingency Plans: All good drow soldiers, particularly

of cers and spellcasters, head into battle with a contingency

plan already in mind. In some cases, this might be an alternate

scheme of attack, but at the very least it involves an escape

route of some sort. Even if the main strategy involves force,

these contingencies usually rely on deception or misdirection.

A drow might disguise herself as a member of another race,

the better to blend in with her non-drow soldiers. She might

order her soldiers to continue  ghting to cover her own get-

away even when an objective has been obtained or a mission

has failed. The most favored drow methods for escape involve

magics, from the simple teleport or contingency to elaborate ruses

that involve leaving dead clones behind.

STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES

The drow are partial to tactics that take advantage of their racial

traits and abilities, while minimizing exposure of those areas

where they are weakest. As mentioned above, this approach

inclines them to make full use of ranged attacks while avoid-

ing melee, but their tactics are certainly more speci c and

sophisticated than this simple predilection.

The majority of drow warriors specialize in combat styles

that accentuate their heightened Dexterity, rather than rely-

ing on brute force. Two-weapon  ghting and related feats are

quite  common,  as  is  the  use  of  Weapon  Finesse.  For  extra

versatility, drow employ weapons that can be used either in

melee or at range. When melee combat is unavoidable, drow

prefer to focus their own attacks on spellcasters (particularly

arcanists), leaving the heavy  ghters for their subordinates

and minions. The drow know that sorcerers and wizards die

faster and are ineffective with melee weapons (minimizing the

physical resistance they can mount), while their spells are at

least potentially countered by the drows own resistances.

Even  though  none  of  their  racial  spell-like  abilities  are

innately offensive in and of themselves, the drow have devel-

oped multiple tactics for taking advantage of them.

Dancing Lights: The dark elves favorite use of dancing lights

is to confuse enemy sentinels attempts to calculate the size of

a drow force. When cast at random intervals during camping

or troop movement, the torchlike effects make it dif cult for

observers to determine exactly how many camp res or lan-

ternsand thus how many soldiersa unit contains.

A less common but far more valuable use of dancing lights

is  to  send  coded  messages  over  great  distances.  By  causing

the balls of light created by the spell to move up and down or

blink out in particular patterns, the drow can create signals

written in the scripted form of their sign language. This is a

particularly effective means for of cers to pass messages and

coordinate efforts in combat.

Of course, should all else fail, the drow can use their dancing

lights to provide illumination for soldiers and slaves who lack

their masters ability to see far in the darkness.

Darkness: If the drow have suf cient time to prepare for

an attack, they often set up pitfalls, caltrops, green slime, and

other impediments along the enemys most likely route. They

further  cloak  these  areas  through  the  use  of  their  darkness

ability. At the very least, the foe must slow down or expend

precious spells to safely traverse those areas, and sometimes the

extra darkness causes the foe to stumble directly into danger.

When these hazard-strewn areas of darkness are interspersed

with darkened but perfectly safe regions, the enemy cannot

afford to ignore any of them.

Drow also make a practice of using darkness on crossbow

bolts or other ammunition, and then launching the projectiles

into the ranks of enemy archers or spellcasters. Although the

drow  ring the weapon at an opponent within the radius of

the effect has her normal miss chance, this is hardly a problem

when the objective is simply to place the missile somewhere

amid a group of foes. The enemy, on the other hand, then suf-

fers the miss chance when attempting to strike back against

the drow.

Faerie Fire: In addition to the obvious uses of this spell

negating invisibility and outlining targets for soldiers with

weaker darkvisionthe drow have developed several other

tactical purposes. Drow scouts and spies are often assigned to

identify and locate enemy commanders and spellcasters. Then,

as the bulk of the drow-led forces approach, these scouts use

faerie  re to paint the target. This technique not only gives the

soldiers an easy and obvious target, it permits them to begin

a bombardment of missiles and spells earlier than their own

darkvision or the ambient lighting might normally allow.

One additional tactic, which only functions against foes not

especially familiar with magic, involves combining the use of

dancing lights and faerie  re. First, the drow use the humanoid-

shape  option  of  dancing  lights  to  make  sentries  believe  that

someone or something is approaching, drawing them away

from their posts and possibly allowing drow operatives to slip

by. After several instances, the guards likely become aware that

the glowing  gures are simple illusions and begin ignoring

them. At this point, a drow cloaked in a faerie  re spelland

thus, from a distance, appearing to be just another of the danc-

ing lights effects, if of a different huecan potentially draw

near enough to deliver a sudden attack before the guards real-

ize whats happening.

The drow, for the most part, loathe the fact that their race has

innate weaknesses that counterbalance some of their advan-

tages. One of the main reasons they employ non-drow shock

troops is because they know that they are usually less hardy

than  their  opponents.  They  do  not  worry  overmuch  about

mind-affecting spellseven if the magic penetrates their spell

resistance, they are incredibly strong-willed creaturesbut

they fear the results should damaging or transformative magics

break through their resistance. Thus, most drow spellcasters,

and those who can afford powerful magic, make at least some

attempt at using magic to counter these particular weaknesses.

Constitution-boosting and saving throw-boosting items are

relatively common among those who engage in battle on a

regular basis. So, too, are items that provide for the possibility

of a sudden escape when the situation turns bad. (See Contin-

gency Plans, above.)

he Underdark is home to alien creatures, depraved

cultures,  and  hazards  that  can  snuff  out  the  lives

of  any  creatures  unfortunate  enough  to  stumble

across them. The drow have developed techniques to

respond to these many threats. This chapter explores

the options available to drow characters, presenting new uses

for skills, new feats, alternative class features, and new spells

and invocations.

SKILLS

Innovation  allows  dark  elves  to  make  do  with  the  scarce

resources of the Underdark,  nding new ways to manufac-

ture common goods and to deal with the day-to-day needs in

their civilization.

BLUFF (CHA)

Given the unique form of Drow Sign Language, some dark

elves learn to incorporate elements of the complex language

into normal body movements.

Delivering  a  Secret  Message:  You  can  substitute  Dex-

terity for Charisma when making Bluff checks to deliver a

secret  message,  if  you  and  the  recipient  are  both   uent  in

Drow Sign Language.

CRAFT (INT)

Drow artisans make do with what they have. Many materi-

als that the surface races take for granted are rare in the

Underdark, if they are present at all. Drow raiders do steal

much from the surface world, but transporting signi cant

quantities of wood, grains, and other  nished materials is

simply not practical. The scarcity of resources means that

drow  must  turn  to  nontraditional  materials  to  provide

themselves with lifes necessities. Vegetable  bers such

as cotton and  ax are all but unknown in drow society;

 ber extracted from woody fungi or leather is more com-

monly used. Thus, drow can substitute other materials

they have on hand when attempting Craft checks.

The  most  well-known  examples  of  drow-created

items are the poisons and alchemical substances that

are  found  only  in  their  society.  Chapter  4  provides

extensive information about these special substances.

Included here are DCs and costs for creating alchemi-

cal items and drow poisons.

Craft  (Poisonmaking):  The  amount  of  raw  materials

needed to manufacture poison depends on the general avail-

ability of the active ingredient. If a supply is readily available,

the raw materials cost one-sixth of the poisons market price.

Otherwise, the raw materials cost at least three-quarters of

the  market  price  (though  only  if  the  substance  is  for  sale).

Multiply your check result by the poisons DC to determine

the value in gp of poison you create. When the total equals

or exceeds the market price of one dose, that dose is  nished.

(Depending on the check result, you might be able to create

more than one dose at a time). If you fail the check by 4 or less,

you make no progress, and if you fail by 5 or more, you ruin

half the raw materials and have to buy them again.

HANDLE ANIMAL (CHA)

Vermin are vital to the drow. On one hand, they are creatures

sacred to Lolth, expressions of her perfect divine form. On

the other, they are abundant, and with the proper training,

they can serve as guardians, soldiers, and even steeds.

Since vermin are mindless creatures, they dont learn as

other animals do. Instead, they must be programmed by a

trainer, who encodes a desired pattern of behavior that the

creature reproduces under a speci c set of circumstances.

This  technique  is  beyond  the  capabilities  of  most  animal

handlers,  and  only  characters  with  the  Vermin  Trainer

feat (see page 53) or with access to a similar abilitysuch

as that granted by the vermin keeperUnd prestige class can

train vermin.

Even with the required feat, handling and training mind-

less  creatures  has  associated  challenges.  The  larger  the

vermin, for example, the harder it is to controlthus, when

making a Handle Animal check to handle or train a vermin,

apply the creatures special size modi er to the check DC.

Vermin can learn up to three tricks or one general purpose

that encompasses no more than three tricks. Some vermin

have a special quality that enables them to learn more than

others of their type ordinarily could. It is impossible to push a

vermin. Additionally, vermin are never deemed wild animals

and thus cannot be reared.

In addition to the tricks described in the Players Handbook

and elsewhere, drow commonly teach the following tricks to

their vermin servants.

Ambush (DC 20): The vermin makes a Hide check and

waits  for  a  creature  to  come  near  it.  When  a  target  passes

beneath it or comes within 10 feet, the vermin attacks.

Bestow Venom (DC 15): By succeeding on a DC 15 Handle

Animal check to handle a vermin that has a poison special

attack,  you  can  compel  the  vermin  to  give  up  some  of  its

venom. The creature deposits its poison into a container you

indicate, providing a single dose. A Handle Animal check to

extract venom takes 1 minute. You can then attempt a DC 15

Craft (poisonmaking) check to re ne this venom into a poison

you can use.

Web (DC 15): On command, a web-spinning vermin shoots

a web at the closest hostile creature.

SPEAK LANGUAGE

Drow Sign Language is unlike any other language. A complex

harmony of gestures, facial expressions, and body language,

it is all but impossible to comprehend by those not  uent in

the tongue. Though it lacks a vocal component, Drow Sign

Language is otherwise like any other language, with a robust

vocabulary  and  even  a  written  form.  This  script,  however,

is as unusual as the spoken form of the language. Consist-

ing of symbols that illustrate the proper hand motions with

emphasis marks to indicate other physical gestures, it might

be overlooked by those unfamiliar with the tongue, and inter-

preted as just more of the whorls and patterns that decorate

drow settlements.

Spellcasting: Drow Sign Language cannot be used as part

of a spells verbal component.

However,  as  pointed  out  in  Chapter  1,  Drow  Sign  Lan-

guage  is  quite  similar  to  the  somatic  gestures  used  to  cast

arcane  spells.  An  arcane  spellcaster  who  is   uent  in  Drow

Sign Language gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks made to

identify a spell being cast (if it has a somatic component), and

increases by 2 the Spellcraft DC to identify any of her spells

as she casts them (whether or not those spells have somatic

components).

Dancing Lights: Drow Sign Language relies on sight to trans-

mit messagesand is usually used when undergroundso it

is largely ineffectual when directed at those out of darkvision

range.  To  compensate  for  the  challenges  imposed  by  their

native  environment,  the  drow  have  learned  to  manipulate

their innate ability to use dancing lights to communicate over

longer distances.

To use this ability, a drow must use dancing lights and make

a successful DC 15 Spellcraft check (or DC 20 for complex

messages). As with Bluff, if the Spellcraft check fails by 4 or

less, the drow cant get the message across. Failure by 5 or more

indicates that false information is communicated.

NEW FEATS

The  drow  use  special  tactics

in  combat,  favoring  techniques

that incapacitate their foes rather

than kill them. The reason is simple:

They harvest slaves from the ranks of

their fallen enemies. The drow do kill,

certainly, but indiscriminate slaughter

is a waste of a good labor source.

AT HOME IN

THE DEEP

Your  innate  power  over  the

darkness  extends  to  your

senses.

Prerequisite: Darkness as a

spell-like ability, darkvision.

Bene  t: You can see through

the  shadowy  illumination  cre-

ated  by  a darkness  spell  as  if  the

spell werent there.

This  ability  doesnt  apply  to

other  spells  that  have  the  dark-

ness descriptor.

BLEND INTO

SHADOWS

You  can  draw  from  nearby  magical

shadow to cloak yourself in darkness.

Prerequisite: Darkness as a spell-like

ability.

Bene  t:  As  a  swift  action,  you  can

spend  a  use  of  your  darkness  spell-like

ability to make a Hide check, even while being observed and

without cover or concealment. You must be within 10 feet of

an area of magical darkness.

You  also  gain  one  additional  daily  use  of  your  darkness

spell-like ability.

CAUTIOUS ATTACK

When you take your time in combat, you quickly assess the

 ow of battle to respond rapidly to threats.

Prerequisite: Wis 13, Dodge.

Bene  t: Whenever you ready a standard action to attack,

you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus lasts until you

take the readied action, or until the start of your next turn,

whichever comes  rst.

CHOSEN FOE

At the expense of attention to other distractions, you focus

on a single opponent to give you a decided advantage while

 ghting against him.

Bene  t: Once during your turn as a free action, you can

designate a single opponent. You gain a +1 insight bonus on

attack rolls made against that opponent and a +1 insight bonus

to AC against attacks made by that opponent.

In  exchange,  you  take  a

2  penalty  on  attack  rolls

against other creatures and

a  2  penalty  to  AC  against

attacks  made  by  other

creatures.

The  bonus  and  penalty

last until the start of your next

turn.

Special:  A   ghter  can  select

Chosen Foe as a  ghter bonus feat.

CLEVER

OPPORTUNIST

When  an  unwary  opponent

gives you an opportunity, you

use  it  to  change  positions

with your foe.

Prerequisite:  Combat

Re exes.

Bene  t: If you hit a creature

of your size or smaller with an

attack of opportunity, you can

spend an immediate action to

exchange  places  with  that

creature.

Both you and the target

must  be  able  to  move  into

and  legally  occupy  the  new

space  in  order  for  this  feat

to  function.  For  example,  an

incorporeal character inside a solid

object  couldnt  exchange  places

with  a  corporeal  character,  nor  could  a  non ying  creature

exchange places with an airborne  ying creature.

Special: A  ghter can select Clever Opportunist as a  ghter

bonus feat.

COERCIVE SPELL [METAMAGIC]

Living foes damaged by your spell become more pliable and

vulnerable to your commands.

Bene  t: You can alter a spell that deals damage to foes so

that any living creature dealt damage by the spell takes a 2

penalty on Will saves for 3 rounds.

Penalties  from  multiple  coercive  spells  do  not  stack.  A

coercive spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

CONSTANT GUARDIAN

By paying careful attention to nearby allies and reducing the

accuracy of your attacks, you help protect your companions.

Bene  t: Once during your turn as a free action, you can take

a 2 penalty on your attack rolls to grant a single ally within

10 feet a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. This effect lasts until

the start of your next turn or until you are more than 10 feet

from the chosen ally, whichever comes  rst.

Special: A  ghter can select Constant Guardian as a  ghter

bonus feat.

spells actual level.

DECEPTIVE ILLUMINATION

Your innate power to create mobile light is far more precise

than others.

Prerequisite: Dancing lights as a spell-like ability.

Bene  t: You can spend a daily use of your dancing lights

spell-like ability to cast silent image instead. The illusion lasts

for  3  rounds  after  you  cease  concentration,  but  otherwise

functions exactly as the spell. Your caster level equals your

class level.

You  gain  one  extra  daily  use  of  your  dancing  lights  spell-

like ability.

DUTIFUL GUARDIAN

You put yourself into harms way to protect your allies.

Prerequisite: Constant Guardian.

Bene  t:  Whenever  the  bene ciary  of  your  Constant

Guardian feat is attacked, you can take an immediate action

to instantly exchange places with that character.

Both you and the ally must be able to move into and legally

occupy  the  new  space  in  order  for  this  feat  to  function.

For  example,  an  incorporeal  character  inside  a  solid  object

couldnt  exchange  places  with  a  corporeal  character,  nor

could a non ying creature exchange places with an airborne

 ying creature.

FADE INTO DARKNESS

By precisely controlling the shadows around you, you render

yourself unseen.

Prerequisite: Darkness as a spell-like ability.

Bene  t: You can spend a daily use of your darkness spell-like

ability as a standard action to gain a +5 competence bonus on

Hide checks for 10 minutes per caster level.

This  ability  does  not  function  in  areas  of  bright

illumination.

You also gain one extra daily use of your darkness spell-like

ability.

FASCINATING ILLUMINATION

The lights you create have the power to hypnotize others.

Prerequisite: Dancing lights as a spell-like ability.

Bene  t: You can spend a daily use of your dancing lights

spell-like ability to cast hypnotic pattern instead. Your caster

level equals your class level.

You  also  gain  one  extra  daily  use  of  your  dancing  lights

spell-like ability.

GIFT OF THE SPIDER QUEEN

You can combine your racial spell-like abilities in new and

potent ways.

Prerequisite: Drow.

Bene  t: As an immediate action, you can activate any of

the following spell-like abilities (using your class level as your

caster level). You spend one daily use of each spell-like ability

used in this combination.

Curtain of Darkness: You can expend one daily use of dancing

lights and darkness to extinguish all nonmagical light sources

within 100 feet. This is not a magical darkness effect; the  res

(or other sources, such as sunrods) simply go out. This ability

does not function on any  ame larger than that of a torch or

lantern, so it cannot be used to extinguish a burning build-

ing or as a defense against  re used as a weapon. This is the

equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

Mirror Image: You can expend one daily use of dancing lights

and faerie  re to use mirror image (as the spell, except you gain

only 1d4 images).

See Invisibility: You can expend one daily use of darkness and

faerie  re to use see invisibility (as the spell, except the duration

is only 1 round per caster level).

Blinding Vanish: You can expend one daily use of dancing

lights, darkness, and faerie  re to disappear in a blinding  ash of

light. All creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst are blinded

for  1 round;  a  successful  Fortitude  save  (DC 14 +  your  Cha

modi er) reduces the effect to dazzled for 1 round. In addi-

tion, you become invisible (as the invisibility spell, except the

duration is 1 round per caster level).

HAND CROSSBOW FOCUS

Your hand crossbow attacks gain accuracy and speed.

Prerequisite: Pro ciency with hand crossbow, base attack

bonus +1.

Bene  t: You can reload a hand crossbow as a free action.

You also gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a hand cross-

bow. This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon

Focus, but it is the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purpose

of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that

requires the feat.

Special: A  ghter can select Hand Crossbow Focus as a

 ghter bonus feat.

IMPERIOUS COMMAND

You strike deep and abiding terror in your foes.

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Intimidate 8 ranks.

Bene  t: If you successfully demoralize a foe in combat,

the foe cowers in fear for 1 round and is shaken in the fol-

lowing round.

INSTINCTIVE DARKNESS

After extensive training, you can negate light instinctively.

Prerequisite: Darkness as a spell-like ability.

Bene  t:  You  can  use  your  darkness  spell-like  ability

as  an  immediate  action.  This  does  not  provoke  attacks  of

opportunity.

You also gain one extra daily use of your darkness spell-like

ability.

Normal:  Using  darkness  requires  1 standard  action  and

provokes attacks of opportunity.

INTENSIFY DARKNESS

By  extending  your  effort,  you  can  expand  the  area  of  your

darkness spell-like ability.

Prerequisite: Darkness as a spell-like ability.

Bene  t: If you spend a full-round action to use your darkness

spell-like ability, you create deeper darkness instead.

You also gain one extra daily use of your darkness spell-like

ability.

MASTER OF SHADOW

You  gain  extra  uses  of  your  drow  powers  of  light  and

darkness.

Prerequisite: Drow.

Bene  t:  You  gain  one  extra  daily  use  of  each  of  your

drow  spell-like  abilities  (dancing  lights,  darkness,

and faerie  re).

In  addition,  you  gain  a +2  bonus  to

your  caster  level  with  these  spell-like

abilities.

PARALYZING

FISTS

You  can  make  multiple

unarmed attacks to paralyze

an opponent in a single round.

Prerequisite: Wis 15, Improved Unarmed

Strike, Stunning Fist.

Bene  t:  When  two  or  more  of  your  Stunning  Fist

attacks succeed in stunning a single foe in the same round,

that  creature  must  make  another  Fortitude  saving  throw

(DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modi er +1 for

each successful Stunning Fist attack). On a failure, that crea-

ture is paralyzed for 1d2 rounds instead of being stunned for

1 round. Creatures that are not subject to extra damage from

critical hits and creatures that are immune to stunning cannot

be paralyzed in this manner.

Special: A  ghter can select Paralyzing Fists as a  ghter

bonus feat.

POISON SPELL

You  can  mystically  transfer  a  poison  to  the  target  of  your

spells.

Bene  t: You can add a contact or injury poison as a mate-

rial component to a melee touch spell you are casting. Doing

this entails the same risk of poisoning yourself as applying

poison to a weapon (DMG 296).

The target of the spell, in addition to being subject to the

normal effects of the spell, is also exposed to the poison. (A

melee touch spell must deal damage to deliver the effect of

an injury poison.)

The  dose  of  poison  used  as  the  component  is  expended

when you cast the spell, whether or not the spell or poison

successfully affects the target.

The Knight of Lolth feat makea a spider-rider

more than the equal of any surface-dwelling mounted warrior

KNIGHT OF LOLTH

You have mastered techniques of waging war when mounted

on a monstrous spider (or similar vermin).

Prerequisite:  Ride  1 rank,  Mounted  Combat,  Vermin

Trainer.

Bene  t: When riding monstrous vermin, you do not need

to make any rolls or checks to remain mounted if your mount

travels  across  walls  or  ceilings  (though  if  you  take  damage

when  on  a  wall  or  ceiling,  the  DC of  the  check  to  remain

mounted is 10 rather than 5).

When your monstrous vermin mount makes a charge attack,

you can spend a standard action to grant it a bonus on the attack

roll and damage roll equal to 1/2 your base attack bonus.

Normal:  Riding  a  creature  clinging  to  a  wall  or  ceiling

would require various checks depending on circumstances.

MASTER OF POISONS

PSYCHIC REFUSAL

You  are  highly  trained  and  adept  in  the  use  of  toxic

substances.

Spells that target your mind have dif culty penetrating your

defenses.

Bene  t: You can apply poison or oil to a weapon as a swift

action, without provoking attacks of opportunity. In addition,

you never risk accidentally poisoning yourself when applying

poison to a weapon.

Normal: Applying poison or oil to a weapon is a standard

action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When applying

poison  to  a  weapon,  you  have  a  5%  chance  of  accidentally

poisoning yourself.

Prerequisite: Spell resistance, Iron Will.

Bene  t:  You  gain  a +4  bonus  to  spell  resistance  against

mind-affecting spells and abilities.

RADIANT FLICKER

You cloak yourself or another with a nimbus of  ickering,

bewildering light.

Prerequisite:  Dazzling  Fire,  faerie   re  as  a  spell-like

ability.

51

95726720_Ch02.indd   51

2/22/07   3:00:05 PM

Bene  t: You can spend a daily use of your faerie

 re spell-like ability as a standard action to grant the

target concealment from all melee attacks instead.

This effect lasts for 1 round per caster level.

You also gain one extra daily use of your faerie  re

spell-like ability.

REACTIVE RESISTANCE

Through  extensive  practice  and  meditation,  you  can

lower your spell resistance quickly.

Prerequisite: Spell resistance.

Bene  t: You can lower your spell resistance as an

immediate action. It returns to normal at the start of

your next turn.

Normal: Lowering spell resistance for 1 round is a

standard action.

SADISTIC REWARD

Your  mind  and  body  are  forti ed  by  harming

others.

Prerequisite: Evil.

Bene  t: If you deal damage to a living creature, you

SHADOWBORN WARRIOR

You are adept at  ghting in darkness.

Prerequisite: Blind-Fight, Dodge.

Bene  t:  Whenever  you  begin  combat  within  an  area  of

darkness or shadowy illumination, you gain a +2 insight bonus

on initiative checks.

When in concealment granted by darkness or shadow, you

gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC.

Special:  A   ghter  can  select  Shadowborn  Warrior  as  a

 ghter bonus feat.

SPIDER COMPANION

Instead of an animal, you bond with a monstrous spider.

Prerequisite: Vermin Trainer, animal companion.

Bene  t: You can select a monstrous spider as your animal

companion. This spider gains all the bene ts normally granted

to animal companions.

At 1st level, you can select a Tiny, Small, or Medium mon-

strous spider as your spider companion. A druid of suf ciently

high level can select a more powerful creature as her spider

companion, applying the indicated adjustment to the druids

level (in parentheses) for the purpose of determining the spider

companions characteristics and special abilities.

Spider

Huge

Minimum Level (Adjustment)

4th (3)

A drow warrior bestride his Huge spider companion

As a swift action, you can suppress the effect of this feat

for 1 round.

STAGGERING CRITICAL

Your critical hits leave your opponents reeling.

Prerequisite: Improved Critical, base attack bonus +12.

Bene  t: When you con rm a critical hit with a weapon

for which you have the Improved Critical feat, the target is

also slowed for 1 round.

Special: A  ghter can select Staggering Critical as a  ghter

bonus feat.

SURPRISING RIPOSTE

Through  deft  maneuvering,  you  unravel  your  opponents

defenses.

Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Improved Feint.

Bene  t: If you deal damage to an opponent in the same

round that you successfully feinted against it, it becomes  at-

footed. This effect lasts 1 round or until the opponents next

turn, whichever comes  rst.

Opponents that cant be caught  at-footed, such as charac-

ters who have uncanny dodge, cannot be affected by Surprising

Riposte.

Special: A  ghter can select Surprising Riposte as a  ghter

bonus feat.

Normal: Spiders are not available as animal companions.

UMBRAL SPELL [METAMAGIC]

SPIDERFRIEND MAGIC

Your spells cannot harm your vermin allies.

Bene  t: Your spells have no effect against vermin allies

(but affect vermin enemies normally).

You add the darkness descriptor to a spell you cast.

Bene  t: You can alter a burst-, emanation-, or spread-shaped

spell so that it gains the darkness descriptor. The altered spell

automatically dispels any spells with the light descriptor of

the spells level or lower whose effects overlap or are within

the altered spells area.

95726720_Ch02.indd   52

2/22/07   3:00:08 PM

For  example,  an  umbral  lightning  bolt  would  dispel  any

ongoing light spell of 3rd level or lower in the area of the line.

An umbral spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the

spells actual level.

VERMIN TRAINER

Your service to the Spider Queen gives you insight into train-

ing vermin.

VERMINFRIEND

Thanks to your racial connection to their kind, vermin regard

you as one of their own.

Prerequisite: Drow.

Bene  t: Whenever a vermin is about to attack you, you can

attempt a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/4 the vermins HD) as an

immediate action. If you succeed, the vermin cannot attack

you for 24 hours.

Prerequisite: Drow, Handle Animal 4 ranks, Knowledge

If you attack a vermin that has been affected by this feat,

(religion) 4 ranks.

Bene  t: You can use the Handle Animal skill to handle

and train vermin as if they were animals with Intelligence

scores of 1.

Normal: Without this feat, only animals and magical beasts

with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 can be handled and trained

with the Handle Animal skill, and using Handle Animal on

a magical beast is done with a 4 penalty on the check.

Special: The size of vermin directly affects the ability of

the trainer to instruct them (see page 46).

VERSATILE COMBATANT

You have learned to combine attacks with the favored weap-

ons of the drow.

Prerequisite:  Dex  15,  pro ciency  with  rapier  and  hand

crossbow.

Bene  t: Whenever you are armed with a rapier in your

primary hand and a hand crossbow in your off hand, you are

treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for the pur-

pose of calculating attack penalties.

In  addition,  you  do  not  provoke  attacks  of  opportunity

from adjacent opponents when you make ranged attacks with

a hand crossbow.

Special: A  ghter can select Versatile Combat as a  ghter

bonus feat.

AMBUSH FEATS

Ambush feats, introduced in Dragon Magazine and expanded

upon  in  Complete  Scoundrel,  allow  you  to  use  your  sneak

attack  ability  to  deal  an  additional  harmful  or  hindering

effect upon an opponent, at the cost of one or more of the

extra damage dice you normally deal with a successful hit.

You must declare your intent to use an ambush feats ability

before making your attack roll and you must always deal at

least one extra die of sneak attack damage with the attack

(that is, you cant reduce the number of sneak attack bonus

damage dice to 0). You can apply multiple ambush feats to

the same attack as long as you still deal at least one extra

die of damage with the attack.

Creatures  immune  to  sneak  attacks  are

immune to the secondary effects created by

ambush feats. Even if a creature is vulner-

able to sneak attacks, if your attack deals no

damage to the creature (for example, if

it is negated by the creatures damage

reduction), the secondary effect doesnt

occur.

As noted in Complete Adventurer, the sudden strike class fea-

ture can be used in place of sneak attack in qualifying for feats.

Furthermore, whenever an ambush feat mentions sneak attack,

you can substitute sudden strike. The skirmish ability

of a scoutCAd doesnt count as a sneak attack for

the purpose of qualifying for feats, nor may a

scout sacri ce skirmish extra damage to gain

the bene t of an ambush feat.

Using Versatile Combatant, a drow  ghter dispatches a goblin

2/22/07   3:00:11 PM

GLOOM STRIKE [AMBUSH]

Your  sneak  attacks  leave  a  residue  of  darkness  that  clouds

your enemys vision.

Prerequisite:  Sneak  attack +3d6,  darkness  as  a  spell-like

ability.

Bene  t: Your sneak attack creates an aura of magical dark-

ness that impedes your targets vision for 3 rounds. The target

takes a 4 penalty on Spot checks and treats all other creatures

as  having  concealment.  Neither  darkvision  nor  low-light

vision pierces this effect, though the ability to see through

magical darkness does. Any spell with the light descriptor

suppresses the effect.

Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 2d6.

SICKENING STRIKE [AMBUSH]

Your sneak attacks leave enemies reeling in pain.

Prerequisite: Sneak attack +2d6.

Bene  t:  The  target  of  your  sneak  attack,  if  it  is  a  living

creature, is sickened for 1 round.

Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 1d6.

TERRIFYING STRIKE [AMBUSH]

Your sneak attacks inspire fear.

Prerequisite: Intimidate 4 ranks, sneak attack +2d6.

Bene  t:  The  target  of  your  sneak  attack  is  shaken  for

1 round. This effect doesnt stack with any other fear effects,

including itself. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 1d6.

VENOMOUS STRIKE [AMBUSH]

You know where to place your sneak attacks to deliver a highly

effective poisoned strike.

Prerequisite: Poison use, sneak attack +2d6.

Bene  t: If you are wielding a poisoned weapon as part of

your sneak attack, the poisons save DC increases by 2.

Using this feat reduces your sneak attack damage by 1d6.

DIVINE FEATS

The feats in this category share a number of characteristics that

restrict them to certain classes or class combinations. First,

they all have as a prerequisite the ability to turn or rebuke

undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level

or higher, and members of any prestige class or any creatures

with that ability.

Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the ability to

channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke undead.

Each use of a divine feat costs a character a minimum of one

turning or rebuking attempt from her number of attempts

each day. If you dont have any turn or rebuke attempts left,

you cant use a divine feat. Turning or rebuking undead is a

standard  action  (unless  you  have  a  special  ability  that  says

otherwise).  These  feats  normally  take  a  standard  action  to

activate, but might require other actions as speci ed. Regard-

less, you can activate only one divine feat per round, though

overlapping durations might allow you the bene ts of more

than one divine feat at a time.

Third, turning or rebuking undead is a supernatural abil-

ity and a standard action that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity and counts as an attack. Activating a divine feat

is also a supernatural ability and does not provoke attacks

of opportunity unless otherwise noted in the feat descrip-

tion. However, activating a divine feat is not considered an

attack unless the feats activation could be the direct cause

of damage to a target. Lolths Caress, for example, expedites

the  secondary  effect  of  poison,  but  does  not  directly  deal

damage to an opponent upon its activation. It is not itself

an attack.

DIVINE INTERCESSION [DIVINE]

You  can  channel  divine  energy  to  remove  yourself  from  a

dangerous situation.

Prerequisite: Turn or rebuke undead, Travel or Trickery

domain.

Bene  t:  You  can  spend  three  turn  or  rebuke  undead

attempts to teleport to any point up to 30 feet away within

line of sight. This effect functions as dimension door, except

that you cant bring along other creatures.

LOLTHS BOON [DIVINE]

You can channel negative energy to empower vermin.

Prerequisite:  Rebuke  undead,  drow  or  Lolth  as  patron

deity.

Bene  t:  You  can  spend  two  rebuke  undead  attempts  as

a standard action to unleash a 60-foot-radius burst of divine

energy. Each vermin in the area gains temporary hit points

equal to its HD, as well as a +2 profane bonus on melee damage

rolls. These effects last for 5 rounds.

LOLTHS CARESS [DIVINE]

You  can  channel  negative  energy  to  accelerate  poisonous

effects.

Prerequisite:  Rebuke  undead,  drow  or  Lolth  as  patron

deity.

Benefit:  You  can  spend  a  rebuke  undead  attempt  to

speed up the effects of poison, affecting all creatures within

20 feet of you. Any poisoned creature in the area that has

not  yet  attempted  its  saving  throw  against  the  poisons

secondary effect must do so immediately. (This takes the

place of the saving throw at the end of the normal poison

duration.)

PROFANE AGONY [DIVINE]

You can channel negative energy to deal terrible pain.

Prerequisite:  Rebuke  undead,  Death  or  Destruction

domain.

Bene  t:  You  can  spend  a  rebuke  undead  attempt  as  a

full-round  action  to  channel  your  deitys  displeasure  at  a

single  living  creature  within  30  feet.  That  creature  takes

3d6 points of nonlethal damage and is sickened for 1 round.

A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your level +

your Cha modi er) negates the damage, but not the sicken-

ing effect.

VILE FEATS

Introduced  in  Book  of  Vile  Darkness,  feats  with  the  vile

descriptor are available only to intelligent creatures of evil

alignment.

UNSPEAKABLE VOW [VILE]

You willingly give yourself to the service of an evil deity or

cause, denying yourself an ordinary life to serve your unspeak-

able ends.

Bene  t:  You  gain  a +2  profane  bonus  on  Intimidate

checks.

VOW OF

DECADENCE

[VILE]

You  have  taken  an

unspeakable vow to

indulge  your  every

desire,  even  at  the

expense  of  others

around you.

Prerequisite:

Unspeakable Vow.

Benefit:  You

cannot  overdose

when  using  drugs.

If  the  drug  deals

variable  damage,

you always take the

minimum  amount.

If  the  drug  has  a

penalty that lasts for

a variable amount of

time, it is always for

the minimum time

described.  In  addi-

tion,  you  gain  a +4

competence  bonus

on  saving  throws

ingested

against

poisons.

Lolth gives special protection to her daughters who have the Profane Agony feat

Special: To ful ll your vow, you must consume an intoxi-

cating, stimulating, depressing, or hallucinogenic substance

at least once per day. If you intentionally abstain, you imme-

diately and irrevocably lose the bene t of this feat. You may

not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as a

result of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally,

you lose the bene t of this feat until you perform a suitable

penance and receive an atonement spell.

VOW OF THE SPIDER QUEEN [VILE]

You have taken an unspeakable vow to further the interests

of the Spider Queen at all costs.

Prerequisite: Caster level 6th, rebuke undead, Unspeak-

able Vow, Verminfriend.

Bene  t: This unspeakable vow grants a variety of super-

natural bene ts, but at a terrible price.

You gain immunity to poison.

When using the Verminfriend feat, you gain a +5 insight

bonus on the Charisma check, and you can prevent any single

vermin within 30 feet from attacking you. If you succeed, the

affected vermin cannot attack you for 24 hours.

Also, you can expend a rebuke undead attempt to rebuke or

command vermin. This ability functions like rebuke undead,

except that it affects vermin.

Finally, you develop horrid glands in your mouth that allow

you to spit a wad of toxic  uid. Your glands produce enough

poison to spit a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Con

bonus (if any). Treat

this  as  a  ranged

touch  attack  with

a  range  increment

of 10 feet. A direct

hit deals 1d6 points

of acid damage and

forces the target to

succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 10 +

1/2  your  level +

your Con modi er)

or take 1d4 points of

Strength  damage.

Ten  rounds  later,

the target must suc-

ceed  on  a  second

save  against  the

same  DC or  take

an  additional  1d4

points  of  Strength

damage.  Ever y

creature  within  5

feet  of  the  target

takes 1 point of acid

damage  from  the

splash.

Special:  To  ful-

 ll  your  vow,  you

must  not  cause

harm to any vermin. You may not deal lethal damage or ability

damage to such creatures through spells or weapons, though

you can deal nonlethal damage. You may not target them with

death effects, disintegrate, or other spells that have the immedi-

ate potential to cause death or great harm. You also may not

use nondamaging spells to incapacitate or weaken vermin so

your allies can kill them.

In addition, once per week, you must perform a horrid ritual

that involves opening yourself to the maddening presence of

the Spider Queen. The ritual takes 8 hours, and at the end of

this time you take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage. Wisdom

damage can be healed normally.

If you intentionally break this vow or fail to perform the

profane  ritual,  Lolth   nds  you  wanting.  If  you  have  11 or

fewer  HD,  you  immediately  transform  into  a  chwidencha

(see page 108), becoming a scuttling thing with no memory

of your former self. If you have 12 or more HD, you immedi-

55

ately become a drider. In both cases, you automatically lose

the bene t of this feat and may not select a new one to replace

it. If you break your vow because of magical compulsion, or

otherwise  unintentionally,  you  lose  the  bene t  of  this  feat

until you perform a suitable penance and receive an atone-

ment spell.

VOW OF VENGEANCE [VILE]

Filled with hate, you have made an unspeakable vow to visit

vengeance on those whom you believe wronged you and your

people. Whether the affront is real or imagined, you settle for

nothing less than the extermination of your enemy.

Prerequisite: Unspeakable Vow.

Bene  t: Choose one creature type or subtype from those

given on Table 314: Ranger Favored Enemies, PH 47. You gain

a +2 profane bonus on damage rolls against these creatures, as

well as a +4 profane bonus on rolls to con rm critical threats

against them.

Special:  To  ful ll  your  vow,  you  must  kill  at  least  one

creature of the selected type each month. When facing these

creatures, you cannot retreat and you must  ght until you or

all the creatures of your chosen foe are killed. You can take

prisoners, but they must die within 1 week of capture.

If  you  intentionally  break  any  portion  of  this  vow,  you

immediately and irrevocably lose the bene t of this feat. You

may not take another feat to replace it. If you break your vow as

a result of magical compulsion, or otherwise unintentionally,

you lose the bene t of this feat until you perform a suitable

penance and receive an atonement spell.

WEAPON STYLE FEATS

Complete  Warrior  introduced  a  new  category  of  feats  called

weapon  style  feats.  They  provide  a  particular  bene t  that

draws upon a number of speci c feats and often requires the

use of speci c weapons.

ALEVAL SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned House Alevals  ghting techniques, allow-

ing you to deal damage that weakens your enemys physical

or mental state.

Prerequisite:  Spellcraft  2  ranks,  Weapon  Finesse,  base

attack bonus +4, sneak attack +2d6 or sudden strike +2d6.

Bene  t:  When  you  deal  sneak  attack  or  sudden  strike

damage, you can sacri ce 1d6 points of this extra damage to

bestow a 2 penalty on one of the targets three saving throws

(your choice) for 1 round.

You can use this feat once per round.

DESPANA SCHOOL [STYLE]

You  have  learned  House  Despanas   ghting  techniques,

which involve teaming up against an enemy with summoned

creatures.

Prerequisite: Power Attack, Weapon Focus (light mace,

heavy mace, or warmace), base attack bonus +5, ability to cast

any summon monster spell.

Bene  t:  As  long  as  you  and  a  monster  you  summoned

threaten the same foe, you are considered to be  anking that

foe even if you dont have an ally on the foes opposite side.

In addition, once per round you can declare that a melee

attack  you  make  with  a  mace,  heavy  mace,  or  warmaceCW

against  a   anked  enemy  is  intended  to  open  the  enemys

defenses. You must declare this attempt before you roll your

attack, and the attempt is wasted for the round if the attack

misses. If the attack hits, your summoned creatures gain a +2

morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against that

enemy until the start of your next turn.

EILSERVS SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned the  ghting techniques of House Eilservs,

which utilize magic staffs in combat.

Prerequisite:  Spellcraft  2  ranks,  Two-Weapon  Fighting,

Weapon Focus (quarterstaff), base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t:  When  you  strike  a  creature  with  a  magic  staff,

you gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to +1 per 10 charges

remaining in the staff (rounded up).

If you strike a foe with both ends of a magic staff in the same

round, you can immediately activate one of the spells from

the staff as a swift action. The spell must target or be centered

either on you or the target struck (or on any corner of your or

your targets space, in the case of an area spell).

This  feat  doesnt  let  you  activate  a  magic  staff  that  you

wouldnt otherwise be able to activate. Staffs without charges

(such  as  a  simple +1 quarterstaff)  gain  no  bene t  from  this

feat.

Normal: Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action.

INLINDL SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned House Inlindls  ghting techniques, which

focus on using light weapons and shields.

Prerequisite: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Shield Pro ciency,

Weapon Finesse.

Bene  t: At the start of your turn, you can choose to sacri-

 ce your shield bonus to AC in exchange for a bonus on melee

attack rolls equal to one-half that bonus. This bonus applies

only on attacks made with light weapons (or other weapons

to which Weapon Finesse applies). This effect lasts until the

start of your next turn.

SHIQUOS SCHOOL [STYLE]

You  have  learned  the  mobile  fighting  style  of  House

ShiQuos.

Prerequisite:  Dex  13,  Dodge,  Mobility,  Spring  Attack,

base attack bonus +6.

Bene  ts: If you deal damage with a charge attack or Spring

Attack  against  an  opponent  at  a  lower  elevation  than  you,

the target also falls prone unless it succeeds on a Re ex save

(DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Dex modi er).

STEAL AND STRIKE [STYLE]

You are a master of the style of  ghting that involves using

a rapier and a kukri at the same time. With it, you can rob

an  opponent  of  its  weapon  and  strike  swiftly  when  it  is

vulnerable.

Prerequisite: Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, Two-

Weapon  Fighting,  Weapon  Focus  (kukri),  Weapon  Focus

(rapier).

2/22/07   3:00:18 PM

Bene  t: If you successfully disarm an opponent with your

rapier,  you  can  make  a  free  attack  with  your  kukri  at  your

highest base attack bonus.

You can use this feat once per round.

TORMTOR SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned House Tormtors  ghting technique from

its weapon masters.

Prerequisite: Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (javelin),

base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: If you deal damage on a melee attack with a javelin,

you can then throw that javelin at any other target within 30

feet as a swift action (using your highest base ranged attack

bonus).

You take no penalty when making a melee attack with a

javelin.

You gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls with javelins.

VAE SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned House Vaes  ghting style.

Prerequisite: Int  13, Combat Expertise,  Improved  Trip,

Weapon Focus (spiked chain or whip), base attack bonus +7.

Bene  t: Once per round, when you deal damage to a  at-

footed foe (or a foe you  ank) with a whip or a spiked chain,

you can also initiate a trip attack (as if you had hit with a touch

attack). If you fail to trip when using this special attack, your

opponent cannot attempt to trip you in turn.

You must declare this attempt before you roll your attack,

and the attempt is wasted for the round if the attack misses.

You  must  have  Weapon  Focus  with  the  weapon  you  are

using  for  this  feat.  In  other  words,  having  Weapon  Focus

(whip) does not allow you to use the Vae School feat with a

spiked chain, or vice versa.

Normal:  You  must  make  a  trip  attack  separately  from  a

normal attack. If you fail to trip the foe, he can attempt to

trip you in turn.

XANIQOS SCHOOL [STYLE]

You have learned the  ghting style of House Xaniqos, which

favors aggressive crossbow maneuvers.

Prerequisite: Dex 13, Dodge, Mobility, Point Blank Shot,

Shot on the Run, base attack bonus +6.

Bene  t: If you have moved at least 10 feet toward your target

since the start of your turn, your crossbow attacks deal an extra

1d6 points of damage against that target in this round. This

feats bene t doesnt apply when you are mounted.

In  addition,  reloading  your  crossbow  does  not  provoke

attacks of opportunity.

ALTERNATIVE CLASS

FEATURES

Alternative  class  features  are  ways  to  customize  a  class  by

selecting abilities that best re ect a racial choice and character

concept. Similar to substitution levels, they offer an option to

the class features granted at a particular level. Alternative class

features have no prerequisites; you simply select them at the

proper levels in lieu of selecting the standard class features. If

you already have reached or passed the level at which you are

eligible to take the feature, with your DMs permission, you

can swap one ability for an existing one. Alternatively, if you

have Players Handbook II, you can use the retraining option.

The  format  for  alternative  class  features  is  summarized

below.

Alternative Class Feature Name

The abilitys description and why you might want to consider

it are given in the  rst paragraph.

Level: You can select the alternative class feature only at

this level.

Replaces:  This  line  identi es  the  ability  that  you  must

sacri ce to gain the alternative class feature.

Bene  t: This section describes the mechanical effects of

the new ability. Unless otherwise mentioned, the class feature

is an extraordinary ability.

DROW BARD

When adventurers think of drow arcanists, they picture the

horri cally deadly drow wizards or the demonically imbued

warlocks. The bard would almost certainly be at the bottom of

the list of arcane classes associated with the drow. What surface-

dwellers fail to realize, however, is that the drow have an ancient

bardic traditionone that transforms the traveling entertainer,

trickster, and storyteller of the surface into one of the most

horri c taskmasters and assassins of the Underdark.

Deadly Knowledge

Drow bards do not travel the world, and thus do not gain the

broad range of understanding other bards have. Instead, they

study  a  means  of  death-dealing  normally  associated  with

other classes.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the standard bards bardic knowledge ability. In addition, you

can use your bardic music one fewer time per day than other

bards (minimum 1).

Bene  t: You are trained in the use of poison. You never risk

poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

DROW CLERIC

Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and

soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark,

and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among

the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all,

than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself

can direct her minions?

Master of Spiders

Spidersthe favored of Lolth and the totems of your race

respond to your call, bowing before you as they do before the

divine mistress you both serve.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the standard clerics ability to turn or rebuke undead.

2/22/07   3:00:20 PM

Bene  t: You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil

cleric  rebukes  or  commands  undead.  When  commanding

spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level.

This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You

can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the

purpose of qualifying for divine feats.

DROW DRUID

Druids are rare among drow communities. Most drow spell-

casters pursue either the faith of Lolth or one of a variety of

arcane paths. However, a rare few exist who seek a different,

more natural connection between themselves and their sub-

terranean environment.

Drow druids forgo the ability to assume animal forms, pre-

ferring the shape of their revered totem: the spider.

Spider Shape

After extensive indoctrination by drow priestesses, you use

wild shape to assume the form of vermin.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the ability to wild shape into an animal at 5th level.

Bene  t: Beginning at 5th level, you can turn yourself into

any Small or Medium monstrous spider. You are not mind-

less, and thus do not gain immunity to mind-affecting spells

and abilities.

You can take the shape of a Large monstrous spider at 8th

level, a Tiny monstrous spider at 11th level, and a Huge mon-

strous spider at 15th level.

This class feature otherwise functions as the normal wild

shape ability.

It doesnt affect your ability to wild shape into plant creatures

or elementals (gained at 12th and 16th level, as normal).

Special: Because they have a stronger connection to scor-

pions than to spiders, drow in the EBERRON campaign setting

who select this alternative class feature instead gain the ability

to wild shape into monstrous scorpions.

FAVORED SOUL

Viewed with a combination of awe and jealous hatred by other

drow, the favored soulsCD of Lolth hold substantial power in

their society, but also occupy a truly precarious position. As

Lolths  elite,  favored  souls  are  expected,  even  more  than

others, to be able to defend themselves and their positions

from  other  drow  who  seek  to  take  them.  Otherwise,  they

clearly  werent  worthy  after  all,  were  they?  Favored  souls

often  compete  with  clerics  for  positions  in  the  priesthood

and other high of ces.

Sense Prey

The Weaver of Webs has graced you with the predatory senses

of her favored minions. Although you are no longer as resistant

to damage as other favored souls, it is almost impossible for

the enemy to hide from you.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the standard favored souls energy resistance at 5th, 10th, and

15th level.

Bene  t: Three times per day, you can use a standard action

to gain tremorsense (MM 316) out to of 5 feet for 1 round per

class level. This is a supernatural ability.

At 10th level your tremorsense extends to 20 feet, and at

15th level to 30 feet.

DROW FIGHTER

Drow  ghters strike fast and melt away before their opponents

have a chance to mount a counterattack. Rather than using

heavy armor or picking feats that emphasize direct assaults,

drow   ghters  employ  techniques  that  exploit  their  natural

advantages.

In exchange for a  ghters access to heavy armor, a drow

 ghter gains strong  rst-strike capability.

Hit-and-Run Tactics

The drow specialize in guerrilla warfare, picking off their foes

with poisoned bolts and slipping away into the darkness. Each

attack wears their opponents down, until their numbers are

so reduced that the drow can sweep in and capture them. If

you select the hit-and-run tactics class feature, you sacri ce

some AC, but make up for the loss with improved re exes and

accuracy when attacking unsuspecting foes.

Level: 1st.

Replaces:  By  selecting  the  hit-and-run  alternative  class

feature, you give up pro ciency with heavy armor and tower

shields,  even  if  you  already  have  those  pro ciencies  from

another class. You cant gain either of these pro ciencies by

multiclassing later, but you can gain them by selecting the

appropriate feats.

Bene  t:  At  1st  level,  you  gain  a +2  bonus  on  initiative

checks.

In addition, when attacking a  at-footed opponent within

30 feet, you can add your Dexterity bonus (if any) as a compe-

tence bonus on weapon damage rolls.

DROW ROGUE

Rogues are common in drow society, fewer in number only

than  clerics  and  wizards.  They  are  silent  killers,  spies,  and

informants. It falls to them to gather intelligence about rival

houses  and  to  eliminate  challengers  within  the  hierarchy.

For  these  tasks,  drow  rogues  cultivate  the  ability  to  safely

utilize poison.

Poison Use

Poison is used widely in drow society. For the dark elves, it is a

vital tool in the race for survival. From the popular drow sleep

poison to the bevy of spider venoms extracted from Lolths

favored creatures, drow have mastered a variety of toxins that

wreak havoc with their opponents bodies.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the trap nding ability gained at 1st level.

Bene  t: You are trained in the use of poison. You are never

at  risk  of  accidentally  poisoning  yourself  when  applying

poison to a weapon.

DROW SWASHBUCKLER

The drow swashbucklerCW  lls an interesting niche in dark elf

society. Their culture of treachery and betrayal offers oppor-

tunities for those with wit and skill to rise far. For drow, the

swashbuckler class is usually a male pursuit, and well-born

sons of the great houses are the most likely to cultivate the

abilities this class offers. A rare few drow swashbucklers are

renegades: outcasts from drow society, bucking the traditions

and loyalties to the matriarchs to seek their own fortunes.

Drow swashbucklers give up some of their mobility across

dif cult  terrain  to  gain  a  more  tactical  understanding  of

movement.

Swift and Deadly

A drow swashbuckler who wields two weapons gains the abil-

ity to better maneuver around his opponents.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

Acrobatic Charge at 7th level.

Bene  t: When wielding two weapons, if you hit at least

once with each weapon in the same round, you can take a 5-

foot step as a swift action.

This doesnt count against your normal limit of one 5-foot

step  per  round,  and  you  can  use  this  ability  even  if  youve

already moved in the round.

WARLOCK

WarlocksCAr among the drow occupy an oddly dichotomous

position. They have strong links to the Abyss and to Lolth, but

those ties more directly bind them to Lolths servantsher

demonsthan to the Spider Queen herself. Thus, although

warlocks  can  occupy  positions  of  power  and  even  become

priestesses, drow expect them to be serving the church and

the great houses rather than running them.

Venomous Blood

The  uids within your body become like the venom of the

spiders themselves. Those who would feast upon your  esh

have  cause  to  be  sorry,  and  the  poison  within  renders  you

resistant to poisons from without.

Level: 8th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain

the  standard  warlocks   endish  resilience  at  8th,  13th,  and

18th level.

Bene  t: At 8th level, you gain a +5 bonus on saves against

poison.

At 13th level, your blood becomes poisonous. Any creature

that damages you with a bite attack, or that swallows you whole,

is exposed to this poison (contact; Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your war-

lock level + Cha modi er; 1d3 Str/1d3 Str). You are immune

to your own poisonous blood.

At 18th level, you can bring the poison of your blood to the

surface of your hand and apply it to a held weapon or to your

next eldritch blast. It requires a move action to manifest and

apply the poison, and you can do so three times per day. In

this more concentrated form, initial and secondary damage

are 1d6 Strength each. The poison lasts until you make an

attack with the weapon or eldritch blast or until the start of

your next turn, whichever comes  rst. Applying the poison to

your eldritch blast doesnt prevent you from applying eldritch

essence or blast shape invocations as normal.

DROW WIZARD

Wizards are among the most feared and admired nondivine

members of drow society. Despite their innate resistance to

magic,  the  drow  have  great  respect  for  both  the  spells  and

the knowledge available to these masters of the arcane arts.

Although they are not directly tied to Lolth in the way divine

casters and warlocks are, their devotion to the Spider Queen

THE POLYMORPH SUBSCHOOL

Introduced in Players Handbook II, the polymorph subschool is

a category of spells that change a targets form from one shape

to another. Unless stated otherwise in the spells description,

the target of a polymorph spell takes on all the statistics and

special abilities of an average member of the new form in place

of its own, except as follows:

The target retains its own alignment (and personality, within

the limits of the new forms ability scores).

The target retains its own hit points.

The target is treated as having its normal Hit Dice for the

purpose of adjudicating effects based on Hit Dice, such as

the  sleep  spell,  though  it  uses  the  new  forms  base  attack

bonus,  base  save  bonuses,  and  all  other  statistics  derived

from Hit Dice.

In all other ways, the targets normal statistics are effectively

replaced by those of the new form. The target loses all the spe-

cial abilities it has in its normal form, including its class features

(even if the new form would normally be able to use these class

features).

If the new forms size is different from the targets normal

size, its new space must share as much of the original forms

space as possible, squeezing into the available space (PH 148)

if necessary. If insufficient space exists for the new form, the

spell fails.

Any  gear  worn  or  carried  by  the  target  melds  into  the  new

form and becomes nonfunctional. When the target reverts to

its true form, any objects previous melded into the new form

reappear in the same location on its body they previously oc-

cupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in

the assumed form fall off and land at the targets feet.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to polymorph

spells,  as  are  creatures  of  the  plant  type.  A  creature  of  the

shapechanger subtype (such as a lycanthrope or doppelganger)

that is the target of a polymorph spell can revert to its natural

form as a standard action.

For  more  information  on  the  polymorph  subschool,  see

PH2 95.

The target retains the ability to understand the languages it

understands in its normal form. If the new form is normally

capable of speech, the target retains the ability to speak these

languages  as  well.  It  can  write  in  the  languages  it  under-

stands, but only if the new form is capable of writing in some

manner (even a primitive manner, such as drawing in the dirt

with a paw).

and indeed, their very upbringing within societyhas led to

the development of race-speci c wizard traits.

Abyssal Specialist

Most  wizards  who  choose  to  specialize  do  so  in  a  speci c

school. Many drow wizards instead focus on a variety of spells

closely linked to the powers and objectives of the Weaver of

Webs. The basic mechanic for specialization is the same, but

the speci cs differ.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you cannot special-

ize in a school of magic, and you lose the ability to cast spells

from a prohibited school.

You must select one school of magic to serve as your prohib-

ited school, and you can never cast spells from it or use spell

completion and spell trigger devices connected to it, as per

normal specialist rules. You may not select divination as your

prohibited school.

Bene  t: You are considered specialized, but not in a spe-

ci c school. Rather, you gain all the bene ts of specialization

with a group of spells that includes all those of the following

subschools and/or descriptors: chaotic, compulsion, darkness,

evil, and fear. You gain all the standard bene ts of specializa-

tion as applied to this group of spells, as though it were a school

unto itself.

NEW SPELLS

Magic is a cornerstone of the values and beliefs of all elves,

including the drow. Between their spell-like abilities and their

magical  gear,  drow  wizards  are  among  the  most  formidable

spellcasters known. Though they make extensive use of spells

that are available to other casters, they have forms of magic in

their arsenals that are unknown beyond the shadowy realm

of the Underdark.

The vermin you select pause for a moment

as  their  exoskeletons  take  on  a  metallic

sheen.

COMBAT READINESS

Divination

Level: Assassin 1, bard 1, sorcerer/

You  cause  the  exoskeletons  of  up  to

three vermin to harden to the strength

of steel. The spell increases the vermins

natural armor bonus by 2. This bonus

increases  by  1 for  every  three  caster

levels above 7th, to a maximum of +6 at

caster level 19th.

The enhancement bonus provided by

armored vermin stacks with the targets

natural armor bonus, but not with other

enhancement bonuses to natural armor.

A vermin with no natural armor has an

effective natural armor bonus of +0.

BEBILITH BLESSING

Transmutation [Chaos, Evil]

Level: Cleric 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less); see text

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

A halo of blue  re  ares around the targets

head, which transforms into the head of an

arachnid. As the light fades, two oversized

claws explode from the targets torso, snap-

ping and clawing at the air.

You  infuse  a  target  with  the  essence

of  a  bebilith  (MM  42),  causing  it  to

gain  the  mandibles  and  claws  of  this

demon.  The  target  gains  two  primary

claw attacks (in addition to its normal

claw attacks, if any) and a secondary bite

attack (replacing its normal bite attack).

The  claws  deal  1d6  points  of  damage,

and the bite deals 1d8 points (assuming

Medium size). If it is wielding a weapon,

the target can attack with either a single

claw or a bite as a secondary attack.

The  target  can  sunder  objects  with

its claw attacks as if it had the Improved

Sunder feat.

The  targets  bite  attack  carries  a

poison  (injury;  Fort  save  equal  to  the

spells save DC; 1d6 Con/2d6 Con).

The target of this spell is also treated

as an outsider of the evil subtype in addi-

tion to its normal type and subtypes.

wizard 1

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The  targets  eyes  widen,  and  shine  brie y

with a white light.

The touched creature gains a +1 insight

bonus  on  initiative  checks  for  every

three  caster  levels  you  have  (mini-

mum +1, maximum +6).

In addition, if the target is  anked,

its opponents gain no bonus on attack

rolls (but still gain any other bene ts

derived  from   anking,  such  as  extra

sneak attack damage).

DOMINATE VERMIN

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 3, druid 3

Components: V, S, DF; Drow

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One vermin

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

The  creatures  eyes  change  color  to  match

your  own.  It  trembles  for  a  moment  as  it

adjusts to your psychic presence.

You  invest  your  psyche  into  a  single

vermin creature, granting it your Intel-

ligence. While it is so affected, you can

direct it with simple commands such as

Attack, Run, and Fetch. Since you

are in absolute control of the creature, it

even follows suicidal commands.

You can continue to direct the vermin

as long as it remains within range. You

need not see it to control it. Changing

your instructions or giving a new com-

mand is the equivalent of redirecting a

spell, so it is a move action.

If the vermin is slain, your mind is

forced out of the creature violently. The

experience deals 1d4 points of Wisdom

damage to you.

DRIDERSHAPE

Transmutation (Polymorph)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S; Drow

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Your  lower  extremities  transform,  sprout-

ing arachnid legs, as a large, pulsing thorax

swells from your back.

You take on the form and abilities of a

drider (MM 89). You gain 20 temporary

hit points, which disappear at the end

of  the  spells  duration.  You  dont  gain

the  driders  spellcasting  ability,  but

you  retain  your  own.  (Spellcasting  is

subject to the driders ability scores; for

instance,  you  cant  cast  wizard  spells

above  5th  level,  since  your  new  Intel-

ligence  is  only  15).  Any  held  objects

remain held in the new form (other gear

melds into the new form as normal).

See  page 59  for  details  of  the  poly-

morph subschool.

ENGULFING TERROR

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One gelatinous cube

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The air wavers and shimmers,  nally coalesc-

ing into a large cube of glistening ooze.

Engul ng terror creates a gelatinous cube

(MM 201) in a space you designate. The

space must be large enough to accom-

modate  the  creature.  If  not,  the  spell

automatically fails.

Upon  appearing,  the  cube  acts  on

your turn, attacking the nearest living

creature each round. You have no con-

trol  over  it  and  cannot  direct  it.  The

gelatinous  cube  remains  until  it  is

destroyed or has no remaining targets

to attack, at which point it moves away

in a random direction.

MAGICAL BACKLASH

Abjuration

Level: Bard 2, hexblade 2, sorcerer/

wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

With a word and a gesture, the target  ares

with crackling, violet-colored energy.

Magical backlash causes any spells affect-

ing the target to resonate painfully. For

each  spell  currently  in  effect  on  the

target  (not  counting  magical  backlash

itself), magical backlash deals 2 points of

damage per level of that spell.

For example, a creature targeted by

magical backlash that is under the effects

of  bulls  strength,  blur,  and  mage  armor

spells  would  take  4  points  of  damage

for bulls strength, 4 for blur, and 2 more

for mage armor for a total of 10 points

of damage.

SHADOW DOUBLE

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Assassin 1, hexblade 2, sorcer-

er/wizard 2

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One shadowy duplicate

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will disbelief

Spell Resistance: No

You  complete  the  incantation  and  nearby

shadows  gather  together,  assuming  your

approximate size and shape.

You create a shadowy duplicate of yourself

at a place you indicate within range. The

shadow double attacks any adjacent target

(regardless  of  the  weapon  it  appears  to

wield), as you desire, starting in the round

when you cast the spell. It attacks on your

turn once each round, striking with an

attack  bonus  equal  to  your  base  attack

bonus + the modi er for your spell save

DCs. Each hit deals 1 point of Strength

damage  to  the  target.  The   rst  time  a

target  is  hit,  it  can  attempt  a  Will  save

to disbelieve the effect; this negates the

damage and renders it immune to further

attacks by the shadow double.

The  shadow  double  occupies  a  space

identical to yours. It is not incorporeal,

and thus cant share a space with another

creature or object. It can provide a  ank-

ing  bonus  against  any  creature  that

hasnt yet saved successfully against it.

The shadow double can strike incorporeal

creatures, but not ethereal creatures.

Each round after the  rst, you can use

a standard action to direct the shadow

double  to  attack  any  other  target.  To

attack this new target, the shadow double

can move to any new legal space within

30 feet (it moves by instantaneous tele-

portation).  If  it  is  not  commanded  to

switch  targets,  it  continues  to  attack

the same target.

A  shadow  double  can  be  attacked.  It

has an Armor Class equal to 10 + your

size modi er + a de ection bonus equal

to the modi er for your spell save DCs,

and has one- fth of your full normal hit

points. If the shadow double is reduced

to 0 hit points, or if you create a second

shadow double when the  rst still exists,

the spell ends.

SHADOW SHROUD

Evocation [Darkness]

Level: Cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 immediate action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

A  thin  membrane  of  darkness  coats  your

body.

This spell negates any penalties or other

harmful effects imposed by your light

blindness or light vulnerability.

This invocation is a polymorph effect

(see page 59 for details of the polymorph

equal to your caster level, or until you

choose to end it.

SUDDEN SWARM

Lesser; 4th

When you kill a living creature with

one  of  your  invocations  (including

eldritch blast), a swarm of spiders bursts

from  the  corpse.  This  swarm  has  the

same statistics as a normal spider swarm

(MM 239), except that you add your war-

lock level to its hit points and the save

DC for its poison.

The  swarm  is  entirely  under  your

mental control, and  ghts as you direct

it.  Commanding  the  swarm  is  a  free

action. The swarm remains for a number

of rounds equal to your caster level or

until  it  is  destroyed.  The  swarm  can

take only a standard action in the round

when it emerges.

At any given time, you can control only

one of these swarms. If you slay a second

creature when a previous swarm is still

active, you can choose either to create a

second  swarm  (in  which  case  the   rst

disappears)  or  to  leave  the   rst  swarm

active and not create a second one.

Sudden  swarm  lasts  for  24  hours  or

until its effect is triggered.

he  prestige  classes  presented  in  this  chap-

ter  represent  various  pursuits  drow  might

undertake in their quests for power. Though

designed for drow characters, these classes

might be suitable for other races with some

modi cations to the requirements. In addition to the new

classes included here, the prestige classes mentioned below

are also well suited for dark elf characters.

Arachne (Faiths and Pantheons 182): Many drow priestesses

become arachnes after passing a deadly Test of Lolth.

Archmage (DMG 178): Male drow wizards who live

through the perils of their training seek the higher arts

of magical study.

Assassin (DMG 180): Assassins are an important part of

drow society and are never short of work in drow cities.

Blackguard (DMG 181): Drow blackguards serve as

generals and personal guards to the matriarchs.

Darkmask (Lords of Darkness 33): In the FORGOTTEN REALMS

setting, the darkmask prestige class is an interesting choice

for drow who worship deities other than Lolth, combining

stealth and subterfuge with devotion to Vhaerun.

Drow Judicator (Underdark 33): These unholy warriors

declare  themselves  the  champions  of  Lolth  and  rival  the

blackguards wickedness and cruelty.

Eldritch Knight (DMG 195): This class is an ideal blend

of martial talent and magical power. Many drow consorts

become eldritch knights to enhance their value to the high

priestesses.

Scorpion Wraith (Secrets of Xendrik 130): The scorpion

wraiths of Eberron are the de nitive dark elf hunters who

haunt the jungles of far- ung Xendrik.

Shadowdancer (DMG 187): At home in the darkness, drow

spies and assassins often have levels in the shadowdancer

prestige class.

Sword Dancer (Faiths and Pantheons 205): Another excellent

choice for drow who worship gods other than Lolth, the sword

dancer follows the edicts of Eilistraee the Dark Maiden and

works to lead the dark elves back to the surface.

Vermin Keeper (Underdark 44): The drow regard vermin

keepers as beings favored by Lolth for the ease with which

they handle spiders.

PICKING A

PRESTIGE CLASS

A quick glance at the prestige classes presented in this chap-

ter  reveals  that  they  all  have  a  villainous  bent.  Since  they

are  designed  for  the  drow,  few  of  these  classes  are  suitable

for player characters. Of course, in campaigns in which the

players take the roles of drow characters, these classes are all

valid choices for PCs.

Players interested in one or more of these prestige classes

should pay close attention to their entry requirements. Many

of these classes have dif cult requirements, and gaining access

to them requires careful planning. Dungeon Masters can relax

the drow requirement to accommodate the wishes of players,

but they should use caution: Many elements of these classes

are evil-themed or otherwise destructive to party unity.

Melee: Characters belonging to one of these prestige classes

are  skilled  at   ghting  in  close  quarters,  whether  through

direct and brutal combat techniques or subtle  ghting skills

incorporating ambush and surprise.

Nature: These characters are in their element when out in

the wild, whether in the dim forests of the surface world or

the inhospitable depths of the Underdark. They have a good

selection of wilderness-oriented class skills.

Stealth:  These  prestige  classes  emphasize  hiding  and

moving quietly and focus on moving past enemies unseen,

in ltrating groups of opponents, and setting ambushes.

Teamwork:  This  category  includes  prestige  classes  that

augment the abilities of those around them. Members of these

classes work particularly well in groups.

Transformational: These characters are distinguished by

the transformation from their current form into something

else.  This  change  usually  results  in  an  expensive  trade-off

of power, though the speci cs depend on the nature of the

transformation itself.

Unique Capability: This is a catchall designation for those

prestige classes that dont easily  t into another category. These

classes typically offer potent abilities tied to a particular theme,

but that arent available anywhere else.

ARACHNOMANCER

There are many paths to understanding the Spider Queen. Some

worship her, others fear her, but few fully comprehend her glory. The

road I walk, however, offers the most thorough knowledge of Lolths

generous blessings.

Derzen Vrinn, arachnomancer

By discarding the religious traditions dominating drow cul-

ture,  the  arachnomancer   nds  a  different  way  to  serve  the

Weaver of Webs. Through careful study, the arachnomancer

comes to understand spiders in a unique and disturbing way,

developing a rapport with the vermin. It doesnt take long for

the arachnomancer to shape his magical studies to awaken

the Spider Queens blessings within himself, allowing him

to assume the form of a monstrous spider.

BECOMING AN ARACHNOMANCER

To many, arachnomancers are expressions of the Flesh-Carvers

in uence on the mortal world, but the fact is that only masters

of arcane magic, not divine, can learn the techniques neces-

sary to enter this class. Still, many drow clerics compromise

their religious studies to dabble in arcane magic so that they

too can know the power of the Spider Queen.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Climb 4 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 4 ranks,

Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.

Feat: Verminfriend (see page 53).

Spells: Ability to cast spider climb, summon swarm, or web

as an arcane spell.

CLASS FEATURES

Arachnomancers slowly absorb the characteristics of vermin

as  they  advance  until  they  transcend  their  ordinary  form,

in the process discovering the power to assume the form of

a  monstrous  spider.  Their  studies  awaken  certain  vermin-

like qualities within them, leaving these characters forever

changed.

Spellcasting: At 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th level, you gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the

prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other ben-

e t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an

arachnomancer, you must decide to which class to add each

level  for  the  purpose  of  determining  spells  per  day,  caster

level, and spells known.

Poison Save Bonus (Ex): You gain a bonus on saving throws

against poison equal to your class level.

Handle Spiders (Ex): You gain a +5 bonus on skill checks

to use the Handle Animal skill with spiders (see page 46).

Spider Domain: You gain access to the SpiderSC domain

and the granted power associated with the domain (rebuke

spiders as an evil cleric rebukes undead, a number of times per

day equal to 3 + your Cha modi er). If you already have access

to one or more domains, you can now choose spells from this

domain as your daily domain spells. If you do not already have

a domain, each day you can prepare one domain spell for each

level you can cast, from 1st on up. See the deity, domains, and

domain spells cleric class feature, PH 32.

Spider  Shape  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  you  can  change  into  a

Small, Medium, or Large monstrous spider (either hunting

or web-spinning) and back again three times per day. At 5th

level, you can also take the form of a Tiny or Huge monstrous

spider, and at 8th level, you can take the form of a Gargantuan

monstrous  spider.  The  effect  lasts  for  1 hour  per  arachno-

mancer level. This ability functions as wild shape, so you can

Webwalking (Su): Start-

ignore  webs  (magical  or

checks.

Climb  Speed  (Ex):  At

land speed. In addition, you

gain  a +8  bonus  on  Climb

checks and you can always

checks,  even  if  rushed  or

PLAYING AN

ARACHNO-

MANCER

dreaded  bebiliths  that  the  priestesses  conjure  for  the  most

profane rituals.

Even when not studying spiders, you  nd ways to bring

them up in conversation, dropping fascinating (to you) tid-

bits and trivia about different

breeds of spiders, their mating

habits,  and  their  hunting

habits,  and  going  to  great

lengths  to  extol  the  virtues

of  vermin.  Although  the

drow  might  tolerate  or  even

appreciate such insights, your

attraction to spiders does little

to endear you to members of

other races.

Combat

The  greatest  strength  you

have  as  an  arachnomancer

is  the  ability  to  assume  the

form  of  a  monstrous  spider.

Although this ability greatly

enhances your combat prow-

ess, you are no more durable

in  your  spider  shape  than

you  were  in  your  original

form. However, you gain the

extraordinary abilities of your

new  form,  including  a  poi-

sonous bite and the ability to

spin webs.

Even if you dont fall back

on  your  spider  shape  abil-

ity,  you  still  have  a  number

of  assets.  The   rst  level  you

take in this class signi cantly

improves  your  spellcasting

options by granting you the bonus spells of the Spider domain.

You sacri ce some of your spellcasting potential, but you still

have  a  large  enough  array  of  spells  to  augment  your  other

arachnomancer features and to eliminate foes.

Derzen Vrinn, an arachnomancer

You are obsessed with spiders. They  ll your dreams and your

waking thoughts. The extent of your preoccupation does not

stop with ordinary spiders: You are fascinated by all spider-

Advancement

Images and icons of spiders have always been a part of your

life. Your society taught you to venerate these creatures, to

exalt them as the children of Lolth. Its no wonder, then, you

became obsessed with them.

What began as idle curiositya preoccupation with the

movements  of  their  graceful  forms,  the  intricate  beauty  of

their magni cent webs, and the trembling of their victims

before they sink poison-bearing fangs into  eshsoon  lled

your  dreams.  You  simply  could  no  longer  bear  to  be  away

from them.

You threw yourself into the study of spiders, interacting

with them and allowing them to pierce your  esh so that you

could experience the ambrosia of their venom. You bent your

magical knowledge to their study and emulation, until one

day you realized that the kinship you felt with these creatures

was no longer yours alone: The spiders seemed to regard you

as one of their own.

You  nd you have more in common with the vermin you

study than with other creatures, and you even prefer the com-

pany of spiders to the mercurial drow. Though you might be

distant and somewhat off-putting, the understanding of spi-

ders that you have accumulated grants you unique status and

freedom. The drow regard you as a favored servant of Lolth

and indulge you in your pursuits.

One of the  rst feats you should take after entering this

class is Natural Spell. This feat allows you to access your spells

even when in spider form. As for skills, investing in Handle

Animal improves your chances of training vermin, who can

then serve you as minions, guardians, or companions.

Resources

Your best resource is the kinship you share with vermin. Spi-

ders are likely abundant in your native environment (since

they  are  drawn  to  dark  elf  communities),  so  you  have  no

shortage of allies. If you are not a drow, you can join a nest

of spiders, exerting your in uence until the creatures accept

you as part of the pack.

Clearly,  drow  veneration  of  all  things  arachnid  grants

some bene ts. Few drow would dare cross such an obviously

blessed individual.

ARACHNOMANCERS IN THE WORLD

As if spiders and drow werent bad enough, there are spiders who

think they are drow, and worse, drow who think they are spiders!

Osson Hjortgar, deepwarden

Where  there  are  drow  and  spiders,  theres  bound  to  be  an

arachnomancer. Given the nature of drow culture, the arach-

nomancer  class  is  a  logical  expression  of  drow  values  and

religious beliefs. As such, theres at least one arachnomancer

in any drow community.

Organization

Each arachnomancer arrives at his understanding of spiders in

a slightly different way, although many study the nature and

capabilities of these creatures for similar reasons. Naturally

sel sh, would-be arachnomancers conceal their knowledge

from others, perhaps out of some misguided belief that they

are  somehow  special  to  the  Spider  Queen  and  gifted  with

unique insight into the vermin. Some simply aim to exploit

Lolths creatures by tapping into the power of these monstrous

arachnids.

Despite  their  guarded,  sel sh  nature,  arachnomancers

enjoy  a  certain  amount  of  reverence  from  Lolths  church.

Few high priestesses dare harm established arachnomancers

directly, regardless of any affront they might present. Instead,

arachnomancers become tools in the priestesses secret power

grabs and intrigues. Most arachnomancers  nd themselves

in the employ of in uential drow matriarchs and showered

with gifts, comforts, and the ful llment of every desire, with

only the occasional mission or appearance to interrupt their

foul studies.

NPC Reactions

Arachnomancers are reclusive individuals. To the common

drow, the arachnomancer is a pure expression of Lolth, the

visible hand of the Spider Queen. Thus, drow of all stations

are friendly or even helpful toward these individuals.

Outside the safety and security of the drow city, however,

arachnomancers  nd a less tolerant world. To those who have

suffered depredations at the hands of the dark elves, arachno-

mancers epitomize the abominable nature of drow civilization.

This revulsion crosses nearly all racial boundaries, leading to

invariably hostile attitudes.

ARACHNOMANCER LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering)

can  research  arachnomancers  to  learn  more  about  them.

When  a  character  makes  a  successful  skill  check,  the  fol-

lowing  lore  is  revealed,  including  the  information  from

lower DCs.

DC 10:  There  is  a  breed  of  Underdark  spellcasters  that

dabble in spider-magic.

DC 15: They call themselves arachnomancers with good

reason. They can transform themselves into spiders.

DC 20:  Arachnomancers  are  specialized  spellcasters,

typically wizards, who invest their magical energy to better

understand  the  characteristics  of  spiders.  Through  their

studies, they learn to assume the form of spiders, imbuing

them with the senses and capabilities of the objects of their

obsession.

Characters  interested  in   nding  an  arachnomancer  will

have little luck unless they are willing to explore the Under-

dark, and even then, they must often enter a drow city. There,

they might  nd a few clues about a local arachnomancer with

a  Gather  Information  check,  but  extensive  questioning  is

almost guaranteed to raise the suspicions of the community.

This activity will bring the arachnomancer to the PCsand

he is not likely to have conversation on his mind.

ARACHNOMANCERS IN THE GAME

The arachnomancer class offers arcane spellcasters a chance to

expand their combat capabilities in new directions. Although

entry into this class does diminish spellcasting capabilities,

it offers a suite of powers to compensate for the loss: Indeed,

arachnomancers retain their usefulness even after their daily

allotment of spells is exhausted.

Players  who  enjoy  tinkering  with  their  characters  and

having a broad range of options available to them might be

attracted to this class. The arachnomancer class requires com-

mitment, so characters branching into this class do so for the

long term, in order to access the greatest transformations at

high levels.

Adaptation

To the drow of Eberron, spiders and their kind are sacred but

ultimately just re ections of the scorpion, a creature blessed

by their strange deity Vulkoor. Arachnomancers hold a place

in society similar to that of driders: They are seen as chosen

servants of the Mockery, of whom its believed Vulkoor is a

part.

With a little work, you can adapt this class so that it re ects

the  traits  of  scorpions  rather  than  spiders.  Replace  handle

spiders with handle scorpions (functioning like the aforemen-

tioned ability, but with scorpions). Additionally, the prestige

class does not offer access to the Spider domain, nor does it

grant the webwalking ability. Instead, it improves spellcast-

ing ability at all eight levels rather than six. Finally, instead of

transforming into a spider, the arachnomancer changes into

a similarly sized monstrous scorpion.

Sample Encounter

Should the characters  nd themselves enemies of the drow,

they can be assured of a visit by an arachnomancer and his

colony of spiders.

EL 11: Derzen Vrinn is an arachnomancer formerly attached

to House Everhate in Erelhei-Cinlu, but he now languishes in

the deplorable House Xaniqos. Desperate to escape his fate, he

secretly courts Eclavdras youngest daughter, who has promised

him a place in House Eilservsprovided that he can arrange

the death of Sareska, matriarch of House Vae. Rather than

implicate himself, Derzen seeks a band of foolhardy adven-

turers, driven by wealth rather than morals, whom he hopes

will do his dirty work for him.

CAVESTALKER

Welcome to my realm. Youll  nd naught for you here but privation,

fear, and deathoh, and my blade.

Gaelimor Zyrshaen, drow cavestalker

The  Underdarks  most  dangerous  predators  are  not  its  hor-

ri c monstrosities, crawling and festering in the darkest of

grottoes.  Rather,  they  are  the  deadly  cavestalkers,  moving

effortlessly through a jungle of living rockand none are as

much at home in these caverns as the drow.

Just as a surface ranger feels at peace in the heart of a virgin

forest, so too is a cavestalker is at home in the wilds of the

Underdark.  Yet  even  in  his  most  familiar  environment,  he

is aware of the ever-present danger that surrounds him. It is

in the task of surviving this endless peril that he  nds peace

away from so-called civilized folk.

BECOMING A CAVESTALKER

Rangers and druids are natural candidates for the cavestalker

class. Underdark races that choose the path of the druid or

ranger  nd little use for the abilities of those classes that are

attuned to the wilderness of the surface. The cavestalker class

augments and hones those abilities, making them more suit-

able for use in the endless night and providing a true advantage

for those that live away from the light.

Rogues occasionally become cavestalkers, since their high

skill point allotment allows them to achieve the requirements

more easily than other classes. Other classes might enjoy the

bene ts of becoming a cavestalker, but would likely  nd meet-

ing the requirements to be prohibitive. Regardless of class,

only  individuals  who  have  natural  darkvision  can  achieve

the af nity with the lightless depths necessary to become a

cavestalker.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (dungeoneering) 4 ranks, Survival 8

ranks.

Feats: Track.

Base Attack Bonus: +2.

Special: The candidate must have natural darkvision to

allow successful navigation of Underdark tunnels.

CLASS FEATURES

As they advance in the class, cavestalkers become more famil-

iar with the Underdarks natural elements. In addition, any

abilities they have from the ranger or druid classes become

attuned to their subterranean environment.

Advanced Spelunker (Ex): As a cavestalker, your familiar-

ity with the environs of the Underdark allows you to move

through it easily, even in the most dif cult conditions. As a

result, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  and  Jump  checks  in  natural  subterranean

surroundings.

Underdark Af  nity (Ex): At 2nd level, your adaptation

to the Underdark allows you to use your nature-themed class

abilities in natural subterranean surroundings as well. These

include the druid and ranger abilities of camou age, hide in

plain sight, trackless step, and woodland stride. If you already

have wild empathy, you can now use it to affect vermin. If you

have the wild shape ability, add vermin to the types of creatures

you can become (subject to all the size and frequency limita-

tions provided by that ability). If you do not already have these

underlying abilities, Underdark af nity does not grant them

to you; it only augments those you already have.

Hide of Stone (Ex): As you gain levels in the cavestalker

class, your body embraces the rigors of the Underdark and

takes on something of its hue and toughness. Your skin hard-

ens and becomes  inty, granting you a natural armor bonus

in addition to a circumstance bonus on Hide checks when in

natural subterranean surroundings. These bonuses increase

as you progress through the cavestalker class, at 6th level and

again at 10th level.

Lesser Cavesense (Ex): At 3rd level, you are gifted with a

mystical connection to the Underdark, giving you darkvision

out to 120 feet. If you already have darkvision out to 120 feet,

your darkvision extends an additional 60 feet. Due to your

familiarity with the acoustic qualities of the Underdark, you

also gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks made in

subterranean surroundings.

Exotic Combat Style (Ex): At 4th level, you gain mastery

of a speci c exotic combat style, either the spiked chain style

or the hand crossbow style.

If you are not a ranger or have not already selected a ranger

combat style, choose one of these two styles. You gain pro -

ciency in that exotic weaponeither the spiked chain or the

hand crossbowif you do not already have it.

If you already have selected two-weapon combat as a ranger

combat style, then the exotic combat style provides you with

the Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (spiked chain) feat and permits

the use of a spiked chain as a one-handed weapon.

If  you  already  have  selected  archery  as  a  ranger  combat

style,  then  the  exotic  combat  style  provides  you  with  the

Exotic Weapon Pro ciency (hand crossbow) feat and grants

you the Rapid Reload feat, even if you do not have the normal

prerequisites for the feat.

If you acquire a ranger combat style after gaining an exotic

combat style, then the two styles must correspond in a similar

fashion: You must select two-weapon combat after choosing

the  spiked  chain  style,  or  archery  after  choosing  the  hand

crossbow style.

The bene ts of your chosen exotic combat style apply only

when you wear light or no armor. You lose all bene ts of your

exotic combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

Expert  Spelunker  (Ex):  Upon  reaching  5th  level,  your

familiarity with the tight con nes of the Underdark allows

you to retain your Dexterity bonus even when climbing or

when in a cramped space. Furthermore, youre better able to

negotiate cramped spaces, lowering Escape Artist DCs, move

penalties, and attack penalties by one category. See Table 61:

Cramped Spaces on page 159.

2/22/07   3:07:18 PM

Gaseous  Form  (Sp):  At  6th  level,  you  gain  the  ability

to  traverse  the  treacherous  and  con ned  terrain  of  the

Underdark  by  assuming  gaseous  form  once  per  day  (caster

level 12th).

Improved Exotic Combat Style (Ex): Your aptitude for

your chosen exotic combat style increases at 7th level. If you do

not already have a combat style from the ranger class, then the

improved exotic combat style grants you one of those ranger

combat styles. If you already have the hand crossbow exotic

combat style, you must select archery; if you already have

the spiked chain exotic combat style, you must choose

two-weapon combat.

If  you  select  archery,  then  you  are  treated  as

having the Rapid Shot feat, even if you do not

have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If  you  select  two-weapon  combat,

then  you  are  treated  as  having  the

Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if

you do not have the normal pre-

requisites for that feat.

If  you  already  have  the

ranger  two-weapon  combat

style  and  the  spiked  chain

exotic  combat  style,  then

the improved exotic combat

style  allows  you  to  treat  a

spiked chain as one size cat-

egory smaller for the purpose

of use in a cramped space (see

Expert Spelunker, above).

If  you  already  have  the  ranger

archery  combat  style  and  the  hand

crossbow exotic combat style, then you

are treated as having the Manyshot feat even

if you do not have the normal prerequisites

for that feat. You are able to use this feat in

conjunction with a hand crossbow.

As  before,  the  bene ts  of  your  chosen

style apply only when you wear light or no

armor.  You  lose  the  bene t  of  your  exotic

combat  style  when  wearing  medium  or

heavy armor.

Greater Cavesense (Ex): When you reach 8th level, your

mystical connection to the Underdark increases, granting you

tremorsense out to 30 feet.

Void in Space (Su): When you reach 9th level, your attun-

ement to the particular atmosphere of the Underdark allows

you to warp the sounds, scents, and vibrations you give off,

making you invisible to creatures that rely on senses other

than sight to detect others. This effectively makes you unde-

tectable to blindsense, blindsight, and tremorsense. You still

make noises and vibrations (though a successful Move Silently

check  can  mask  the  sounds),  but  creatures  that  cannot  see

are incapable of determining your true location and believe

that you are 30 feet in a random direction from where you are

actually located.

In  addition,  this  ability  nulli es  the  effect  of  the  Blind-

Fight feat against you.

Master Spelunker (Su): By the time you reach 10th level,

your af nity for the terrain of the Underdark has become so

great  that  you  can  negotiate  it  without  dif culty  and  even

merge with it at times. This grants you the ability to use spider

climb (as the spell) on any natural stone surface at will. In

addition, you can use meld into stone (as the spell) with any

surface of unworked stone three times per day.

PLAYING A CAVESTALKER

As  a  cavestalker,  you  nurture  a  close,  almost

mystical connection to the deadly terrain of the

Underdark.  To  you,  the  lightless  tunnels  are

not friends, exactly, but perhaps well-respected

adversaries. Danger is always present, yet you

understand it and even  nd a certain succor

in living alongside it.

Combat

Although you are a formidable

warrior,  you  usually  prefer  not

to stand against the sheer might

of the worlds  ghters and barbar-

ians. Your greatest ally is your own

native environment. None dare face

your blades when they are trapped in

a cramped tunnel, and your exhaustive

knowledge of the Underdark allows you to

draw enemies into untenable positions where

you have the advantageand where

you might even be able to dispatch

them without having to  ght at all.

With your excellent mobility, you

might  consider  taking  a  few  levels  of  rogue,

adding a deadly sneak attack to your reper-

toire. And if things get too hot, its easy for

you to disappear into a realm of extreme

peril where few dare to follow.

Advancement

The call of the wild is a very different thing in

the Underdark from what it is on the surface,

but  its  allure  is  no  less  enticing.  Whereas  on

the  surface  a  character  might  enter  the  remote  reaches  of

nature to  nd solitude or peace, in the Underdark he typically

does it for survival. Perhaps the most dangerous location in

the Underdark is on the civilized streets of a drow city: an

environment rife with political intrigue, betrayal, and assas-

sination. To escape these noxious environs, you sought refuge

in the surrounding tunnels where even the foulest elements of

drow society fear to tread. By gaining an intimate knowledge

of this hazardous realm, you buy some breathing room and

security from the knives of your kin without abandoning all

the advantages that drow society has to offer.

as a ranger or druid augments your already impressive abilities

in the Underdarks deepest caverns.

CAVESTALKERS IN THE WORLD

Lolths priestesses rule the cities with unquestioned dominance, but

the tunnelsthe tunnels belong to the cavestalkers.

Pharug Lurimil, drow merchant of the Crescent Clan

For the drow who pursues the life of a ranger or druidnor-

mally  impractical  classes  for  members  of  a  subterranean

racethe existence of the cavestalkers is validation for his

unconventional  choice.  With  the  abilities  of  a  cavestalker,

that drow can exert his mastery of nature in a more acces-

sible environment, one that lies just beyond the far outposts

of a drow city.

Organization

There  is  no  special  organization  for  cavestalkers.  You  are

more likely to be a loneror at best the leader of a group of

fringe brigands or renegadesthan you are to gather with

other cavestalkers.

Sometimes priestesses or noble houses hire cavestalkers as

spies, and merchant clans are eager to employ you as a guide

along the most perilous trade routes. Cavestalkers can  nd

membership in one of the drow  ghting societies or house

garrisons, serving as scouts or leaders for the far patrols that

guard the fringes of a drow citys sphere of in uence. Addi-

tionally, you might be called on to lead an expeditionary force

to attack some distant target or settlement.

NPC Reactions

Within  a  drow  city  proper,  you   nd  that  you  are  either

ignored or regarded with some small amount of curiosity. A

certain mystique surrounds the reputation of the cavestalk-

ers, but it seems distant and irrelevant to the drow cutthroat

or noble who makes his living preying upon the denizens of

the streets. It is only when a drow  nds himself outside the

secure boundaries of his city that he truly appreciates you.

Indeed,  he  holds  you  almost  in  awe,  knowing  that  you  are

all that stands between him and a horrible death in a hostile

environment.

CAVESTALKER LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (Underdark local)

or  Knowledge  (dungeoneering),  or  who  have  the  bardic

knowledge  ability,  can  research  cavestalkers  to  learn  more

about them. When a character makes a successful skill check

or  bardic  knowledge  check,  the  following  lore  is  revealed,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Only those assisted by a cavestalker can hope to

survive in the wilds of the Underdark for long.

DC 15: Cavestalkers move with ease through tunnels and

terrain that others  nd dangerous or impassable. They make

use of this aptitude to set traps and ambushes for those who

dare chase them.

DC 20: As a cavestalker advances in knowledge and skill,

he grows more and more connected to tunnels in which he

CAVESTALKERS IN THE GAME

As  a  player  character,  you  can  put  your  levels  in  ranger  or

druid to good use for adventuring in the Underdark, when

you  would  otherwise   nd  the  abilities  provided  by  those

classes somewhat unproductive. You can serve as a guide for

a party, helping it to avoid the Underdarks hidden dangers

and using your talents to outmaneuver or outwit those foes

that cant be avoided.

An NPC cavestalker might be the leader of a drow patrol

or the head of a band of outlaws living outside drow society

and preying on those foolish enough to venture beyond its

boundaries. He could also be a spy sent to observe some other

community and report its weaknesses to his masters.

condemns the mortal to eternity in the deepest pits of the

Abyss.  However,  the  demonbinder  cares  little  for  her  fate,

being wholly concerned with power in the here and now. It

is from this doom that she is able to invest herself with the

power of  ends, and the farther she travels down the road of

corruption, the more potent are the demons she binds.

BECOMING A DEMONBINDER

Demonbinders  all  have  at  least  four  levels  of  warlock,  but

not all are pure warlocks. Many dabble in other classes, espe-

cially those who seek to augment their combat capabilities.

Class levels in ranger,  ghter, and especially barbarian are all

common choices for demonbinder candidates.

Adaptation

Entry Requirements

Although cavestalkers are most frequently found among the

drow, they are certainly not limited to the race of the dark

elves. A svirfneblin hermit might live as a cavestalker, quietly

protecting the fringes of his community from the incursion

of subterranean beasts. Alternately, a duergar or dwarf caves-

talker could be a prospector seeking new veins of ore for his

clan. The barbaric quaggoths and grimlocks rarely become

cavestalkers, but a truly exceptional individual from one of

these races might choose this classperhaps one born into

slavery and later raised to leadership of his tribe.

A character from a surface-dwelling race can also become

a cavestalker, though he would need to have extensive expo-

sure to an underground environment. He could dwell near an

extensive natural cave system, for example, or in a community

with close ties to a gnome or dwarf clanhold. In this case, the

character  might  start  out  as  a  ranger  or  druid  and  become

more  and  more  acclimated  to  a  subterranean  environment

as his adventures take him deeper into the nearby caverns.

Finally, a member of a surface race adopted by some under-

ground-dwelling people might  nd his way to the cavestalker

class, pushed toward solitude by the awkward sense of never

quite  tting in.

Sample Encounter

Gaelimor Zyrshaen (see page 71) exists on the outskirts of

drow society as something of a dark Robin Hood character.

He fears neither the priestesses of the city nor the dangers

of  the  surrounding  Underdark,  choosing  instead  to  prey

upon  the  former  and  seek  refuge  in  the  latter.  Anyone

seeking to reach Erelhei-Cinlu might  nd himself subject

to extortion or ambush by Gaelimor and his merry gang of

ruthless thugs.

DEMONBINDER

By the eight names of Lolth, I invoke thee. By the eight curses of

the Flesh-Carver, I command thee. By the eight dooms of the Spider

Queen, I summon thee. Fill my empty vessel with your profane might,

your limitless power, and your inexhaustible wisdom. Let us become

one and show the world your true power!

Olarae Quavein, demonbinder

The demonbinder draws the essence of demons into herself

to acquire their power. Such acts are forbidden, and doing so

Race: Drow.

Alignment: Chaotic evil.

Skills: Bluff 4 ranks, Knowledge (the planes) 8 ranks, Sense

Motive 4 ranks.

Language: Abyssal.

Invocations: Baleful utterance plus any two others.

CLASS FEATURES

The  demonbinder  prestige  class  increases  the  number  of

invocations at your disposal, and it also provides access to a

number of supernatural abilities and resistances. From the

start, you gain a pool of points that you use to bind demons

that bestow their powers onto you. In many cases, you can use

these demons to modify your eldritch blast. You also gradually

acquire the immunities enjoyed by demons, as well as their

damage reduction.

Invocations  Known:  At  each  level  above  1st,  you  gain

new invocations as if you had also gained a level in the war-

lock class. You do not gain any other bene ts a warlock would

have otherwise gained.

Damnation Points (Ex): You gain a number of damnation

points equal to your Charisma modi er plus your class level.

You use damnation points to activate your demonbind abili-

ties. You cannot spend damnation points when in the area of

a consecrate, hallow, or magic circle against evil spell. You regain

all spent damnation points after 5 minutes of rest.

Demonbind (Sp): Once per day per class level, you can

spend  damnation  points  to  invoke  the  essence  of  a  demon

and bind it to your soul. This changes your general appearance

(which has no signi cant game effect unless stated otherwise)

and also grants you certain bene ts. Binding a demon in this

way is a full-round action and lasts for 10 rounds.

If you invoke a second demonbind when another is still

active, the new one replaces the old one. Temporary hit points

granted by a demonbind vanish when the demonbind ends

(or is replaced by a new demonbind).

Some demonbinds allow you to spend additional damna-

tion points to gain an extra bene t. You can use this option

only when affected by the demonbind, and the bene t lasts

until the start of your next turn or until the demonbind ends,

whichever comes  rst. Any saving throw allowed has a DC of

10 + class level + Cha modi er.

When under the effect of a demonbind, you gain telepa-

thy out to 100 feet (MM 316) and the evil subtype if you dont

have it already. If you are targeted by a banishment or dismissal

spell, you instantly lose your demonbind. If you enter an area

protected by a hallow or consecrate spell, the demonbind is sup-

pressed for as long as you remain in the area.

Each  demonbind  is  the  equivalent  of  a  spell  whose

level  equals  the  damnation  point  cost  for  invoking  the

demonbind.

Dretch (1 point): Your body becomes  abby and grotesque, and

your limbs become thin and spindly.

You gain 5 temporary hit points and resistance to acid 5,

cold 5, and  re 5.

Babau (2 points): A sheen of red ectoplasm covers your hands.

You gain 10 temporary hit points and sneak attack +1d6 (as

the rogue class feature).

In addition, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift

action to lace your eldritch blast with caustic slime, dealing an

extra 5 points of acid damage.

Succubus (3 points): Small, useless black wings erupt from your

back.

You gain 15 temporary hit points and the bene ts of the

tongues spell.

You can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to gain

a +5 competence bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks.

Yochlol  (4  points):  Your   esh  takes  on  a  slightly  amorphous

appearance, occasionally forming tiny vestigial tendrils that

wave about as if searching for something.

You  gain  20  temporary  hit  points,  and  you  have  a  25%

chance to ignore the extra damage from a critical hit or sneak

attack.

Also, you can spend one damnation point as a swift action

to use gaseous form on yourself.

Bebilith  (4  points):  Your  skin  turns  a  dark  shade  of  blue  and

your eyes redden. Six vestigial limbs that  ap uselessly for

the duration emerge from your ribs.

You gain 20 temporary hit points and the scent ability.

You can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to gain

a climb speed equal to your land speed.

Table 34: The Demonbinder

Hit Die: d4

Vrock (5 points): A down of gray and white feathers covers your

body. Your face twists and contorts, forming a hard beak in

place of your mouth. As you move, puffs of harmless dust rise

from your body.

You gain 25 temporary hit points.

In addition, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift

action  to  augment  your  eldritch  blast  with  screeching  sonic

energy. A target struck by this eldritch blast takes an additional

10 points of sonic damage and becomes deafened for 5 rounds

(Fort negates deafness).

Glabrezu (6 points): Your hands twist into crab-claws.

You  gain  30  temporary  hit  points  and  a +5  competence

bonus on Bluff checks.

In addition, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift

action to gain the bene t of a true seeing spell.

Nalfeshnee  (7  points):  Your  body  swells  with  corruption,  the

skin stretching taut from the profound pressure created by

the possessing  end.

You gain 35 temporary hit points and resistance to acid 5,

cold 5, and  re 5.

Additionally, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift

action to lace your eldritch blast with a nalfeshnees smite. Non-

evil targets with fewer HD than your character level who are

struck by the eldritch blast are dazed for 1 round, overwhelmed

by horrid visions (Will negates).

Marilith (8 points): An extra two sets of arms grow from the

sides of your body, your legs fuse into a green serpents tail,

and your eyes burn with an unholy light.

You gain 40 temporary hit points.

Your original arms (if any) are your primary arms, and the

new limbs are secondary limbs. You can wield extra weapons

with these new limbs, but all such attacks are treated as off-

hand attacks.

Also, you can spend 1 damnation point as a swift action to

use one of your new limbs to  re an eldritch blast at a 5 pen-

alty on the attack roll; you cant apply any eldritch essence or

blast shape invocations (or any other modi cations) to this

eldritch blast.

PLAYING A DEMONBINDER

By becoming a demonbinder, you sacri ce your

immortal soul for the instant power granted by the

Abyss.  You  draw  demonic  agencies  inside  yourself,

triggering a vile transformation that bestows not only

a sampling of a  ends power, but also a resemblance to

that  end. Constant exposure to these creatures leaves

a stain on your soul so foul that no act of restitution

will ever cleanse it.

For obvious reasons, most demonbinders  nd little accep-

tance in most civilized lands and are forced to make do in

remote places: dark lands  lled with goblinoids, giants, and

other creatures that care little for the interests of one depraved

mortal. This, however, is not the case with the drow. Thanks to

Lolths association with the Abyss, particularly with regard to

her personal domain (the Demonweb Pits), female demonbind-

ers are valued members of the Spider Queens clergy. Called

the Daughters of the Demon, they treat regularly with  ends.

Lending special insights into the nature of demons, they aid

priestesses in a particularly terrifying ritualone in which

these otherworldly beings are called up to take part in depraved

couplings, hoping to gain the favor of the Queen of Spiders.

Combat

The demonbinder prestige class offers an incredible selection

of abilities, granting you uncommon versatility. With the infu-

blast as you grow more powerful.

Advancement

The Abyss and the creatures that dwell

within  its  endless  depths  contain

enormous  power  that  you  have

stolen and molded to serve your

purposes.  You  turned  to  the

forbidden  knowledge  of  the

demonologists, scouring tomes

of the most profane knowledge

to unlock the secrets of demon-

binding.  You  learned  how

to  open  yourself  to  these

spirits  and  invite  them  to

reside within you. The depth

of their wickedness shocked

you at  rst, but each time you

bound  one,  you  found  your

reluctance slipping away until the

process felt almost natural.

Unless you are ensconced in a church

of  Lolth,  odds  are  that  you  are  an  exile,

cast out of society for your terrible arts. You

might surround yourself with minions for the

protection they afford. If you are not an exile, and you

are female, then you are a part of the esteemed Daughters

of the Demon, a coven of female drow warlocks who advise

and support the priestesses, helping them to exert their

absolute control over the community. Though most of

your time is spent in these endeavors, you occasionally

use your magical talents to thwart your most ambitious

competitors.

As  you  advance,  you  should  invest  in  feats  that  improve

your eldritch blast ability. Since the demonbinder class does not

improve the amount of damage you deal, feats such as Abil-

ity Focus (eldritch blast) and Weapon Focus (eldritch blast), as

well as Maximize Spell-Like Ability and Heighten Spell-Like

Ability, make it harder for foes to resist this vital component

of your arsenal.

Resources

The  Daughters  of  the  Demon  receive  assistance  from  the

clerics of Lolth, who regard them as valuable tools for main-

taining their status and control. In exchange for your support,

the priestesses provide you with lodging, food, clothing, and

all of lifes necessities. In addition, they also offer free healing,

if it lies within their power, as well as discounted spellcast-

ing services. Though the rewards are considerable, make no

mistake: You are their servant.

DEMONBINDERS IN THE WORLD

Organization

How can you doubt the reasons behind the curse that banished the

drow from the suns light? The demonbinders prove their wickedness.

They earned their fateand the day this world sees the end of the

dark elves cannot come soon enough.

Estrella Montenegro, Knight of the Chalice

Demonbinders  are  a  menace.  They  have  no  restraint.  They

eschew the good sense that keeps sane mortals from treating

with demons. Demonbinders are too arrogant to recognize

that they are the tools of the creatures they supposedly control,

and the fact that they have not yet been bodily snatched into

the Abyss to suffer incomprehensible tortures is only proof

that these twisted individuals are immensely valuable to the

demon princes.

From the very moment young drow exhibit a warlocks unique

powers, they are taken from their houses, stripped of their

familial  loyalties,  and  steeped  in  the  dark  arts  of  warlock

magic. Few survive the arduous training and profoundly evil

rites meant to usher them into their next stage of development.

For most, their education stops when they achieve adulthood,

whereupon they take their place in the priesthood as members

of the church. A few go farther than this position, however.

Warlocks who display a special knack for dealing with  ends

and who exhibit a deeper understanding of those creatures

study under the tutelage of established demonbinders, learn-

ing a different, darker path to power. Again, the casualty rate

from such instruction is high, and many would-be demonbind-

ers simply disappear, with only an echoing scream to suggest

where they went and what took them.

Once past the initial stages of training, the newly ordained

demonbinder  oversees  and  sometimes  participates  in  sum-

moning rituals, cackling as the acolytes shriek with pain and

terror from the caress of a conjured  end.

Although demonbinders have great power, the path is not

without  its  drawbacks.  No  priestess  fully  trusts  a  demon-

binder, and with good reason: These individuals are every bit

as  ckle and dangerous as Lolth herself. When infused with

a  demons  essence,  their  capricious  and  violent  tendencies

become far worse.

NPC Reactions

Demonbinders  are  lumped  together  with  demon  worship-

ers,  detestable  in  almost  every  circle  and  certainly  by  any

civilized  community.  Those  who  learn  of  a  demonbinders

nature, abilities, and allegiance are hostile and attack on sight

if at all possible.

Demonbinders  nd welcome only among evil outsiders and

creatures that venerate demonic gods. To such individuals,

demonbinders are kindred spirits, serving the same powers

for  the  same  ends.  They  are  indifferent,  or  friendly  if  they

happen to serve identical masters.

DEMONBINDER LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

research demonbinders to learn more about them. When a

character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is

revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: There is little difference between demonbinders

and the demons that possess them.

DC 15: Demonbinders, though they have much in common

with other spirit sharers, are wholly in a class of their own.

They transcend the limits of common sense, willingly giving

their bodies to demons.

DC 20: A demonbinder uses his or her own corruption to

open a gate inside himself or herself, allowing a malignant

spirit to occupy his or her body for a brief time. From such

unions, the demonbinder gains a variety of powers and resis-

tances that vary with the demon or demons bound.

Outside drow cities, demonbinders are reclusive. Charac-

ters interested in tracking down a demonbinder have the best

chances of doing so by using Gather Information in frontier

villages at the edges of civilization.

DEMONBINDERS IN THE GAME

Demonbinders lurk at the fringes of society, so you should be

able to incorporate them into an ongoing campaign with little

to no work. Furthermore, demonbinders are blessedly rare,

and unless the characters have been in a drow city for a long

time, theres no reason to assume the PCs have had previous

encounters with these characters.

Best as adversaries, low-level demonbinders make excellent

lieutenants: They are versatile, and the techniques they use

are hard to predict. A higher-level demonbinder might lead a

group of cultists, perhaps acting as a prophet.

Adaptation

Demonbinders  are  vile  warlocks,  utterly  in  thrall  to  the

demons they bind. To make this class more useful to players,

you could downplay some of darker elements to bring it more

in line with other transformative prestige classes such as the

dragon disciple (DMG 183) and the  end-blooded (Heroes of

Horror). Replace the chaotic evil alignment requirement with

any non-good. In addition, apply the following changes to the

damnation ability described above.

Damnation (Su): You gain a number of damnation points

equal to your Charisma modi er plus your class level. You use

damnation  points  to  power  your  demonbind  ability.  Spent

damnation points return at a rate of 1 point per 5 rounds. You

cannot spend damnation points when in the area of a consecrate,

hallow, or magic circle against evil spell.

Damnation comes with a price. Whenever you use damna-

tion points, you must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or gain

one negative level. Negative levels gained in this way last for

1 minute. Evil characters are immune to this side effect.

Sample Encounter

Drow  demonbinders  keep  company  with  Lolths  clerics.

Outside drow circles, demonbinders reside in reclusive and

forlorn  places,  in  the  depths  of  dungeons,  or  in  forgotten

towers. They surround their lairs with guardians to ensure

they are not disturbed.

EL 13: Fearing the growing instability within her, Olarae

Quavein (see page 75) volunteered to lead a strike team of six

dark  snipers  against  a  svirfneblin  outpost.  She  hopes  that

the slaughter will slake the thirst for violence that grips her

soul.

DREAD FANG OF LOLTH

All things are possible with the grace of the Spider Queen. It is a shame

you did not realize this before your treasonous transgression.

Shalzad Raelnan, dread fang of Lolth

The dread fangs of Lolth are elite soldiers who  ght for the

drow matriarchs. They are a visible manifestation of the theo-

cratic power that governs the dark elves, and their appearance

elicits fear in almost all who behold them. Dread fangs of Lolth

answer only to the clergy, but they work alongside the mysteri-

ous eyes of Lolth (see page 80) from time to time.

BECOMING A DREAD FANG

Most  dread  fangs  of  Lolth  are  multiclass   ghter/rogues,

because the combination of these classes offers the quickest

path to meeting the requirements. Some fangs have levels in

ranger or barbarian instead of  ghter, or ninja instead of rogue.

A  rare  few  dabble  in  arcane  magic  as  sorcerers  or  wizards,

and then alternate levels in dread fang of Lolth and eldritch

knight (DMG 186).

CLASS FEATURES

Dread fangs of Lolth are shrewd warriors who specialize in the

element of surprise. From the outset, they are granted blessings

from their goddess that set them apart from other warriors.

As they gain levels, they develop a number of techniques that

help them make swift and deadly attacks.

Lolths Will (Su): Your racial bonus on Will saves against

spells and spell-like abilities increases to +4.

Lolths Whispers (Su): The dread voice of the Spider Queen

 lls your thoughts. You gain a +2 insight bonus on damage

rolls. As a swift action, you can give up this bonus and bestow

it on an ally within 30 feet that you can clearly see. The allys

bonus lasts for 1 round.

Sudden Strike (Ex): You deal extra damage at any time

when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This

extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is

within 30 feet. You cant use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal

damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage

dont deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike.

Otherwise, this ability functions as the sneak attack rogue

class feature (PH 50), and it stacks with sneak attack when-

ever both would apply to the same target. (This ability is the

same as the ninjas sudden strike class feature, described in

Complete Adventurer.)

This extra damage increases by 1d6 at each odd-numbered

level beyond 1st.

Poison Use (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, you never risk acciden-

tally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

Team Maneuverability (Ex): Also at 2nd level, you add

one-half your class level as an insight bonus on Climb and

Jump checks. All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 competence

bonus on these checks if they can see you.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 3rd level, you cannot be caught

 at-footed and react to danger before your senses would nor-

mally allow you to do so. See the uncanny dodge barbarian

class feature, PH 26. If you already have this ability, you gain

improved uncanny dodge instead (see below).

Improved Evasion (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, you can

avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Re ex save

and take only half damage on a failed save. See the improved

evasion monk class feature, PH 42.

Team Defense (Ex): At 4th level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus

to Armor Class. As a swift action, you can give up and bestow

this bonus onto an ally within 30 feet that you can clearly see.

The allys bonus lasts for 1 round.

The dodge bonus increases to +2 at 8th level.

Spider Bite (Ex): By 6th level, you have learned where to

strike your foes to best deliver your poison. When you attack

with a poisoned weapon, the save DC to resist the initial effect

increases by 2.

Opportunist (Ex): At 7th level, once per round, you can

make  an  attack  of  opportunity  against  an  opponent  who

has just been injured in melee by another character. See the

opportunist rogue class feature, PH 51.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): From 9th level on, you

can no longer be  anked. See the improved uncanny dodge

barbarian class feature, PH 26.

Ambush  (Ex):  At  10th  level,  during  a  surprise  round,

you can act normally if aware of your opponents; you are not

restricted  to  just  a  standard  action  and  can  perform  a  full-

round action, standard and move action, and so on. If you are

surprised, you can still take a standard action.

PLAYING A DREAD FANG OF LOLTH

As a dread fang of Lolth, you enforce the will of the priestesses.

The goddess favors you,  lling your mind with her whispers

and mutterings. Most times, it is a constant, almost maddening

noise, but you have learned to pick out some wisdom from her

litanyinsights that make you a better warrior.

You are more than just a soldier, though. You are part of

an elite  ghting force that protects and furthers the Spider

Queens interests. As a group, you and your fellow fangs protect

temples, priestesses, and the city, and occasionally undertake

important  missions  for  the  clerics  of  Lolth.  You  take  your

responsibilities seriously and are loyal to a fault.

Combat

Many of your class features require you to gain surprise. Rather

than improving your sneak attack, you gain sudden strike, which

grants extra damage only against opponents deprived of their

Dexterity bonus. You can certainly hold your own in a  ght, but

youre most dangerous when ambushing your enemies.

At 2nd level, you gain your  rst team ability. Like the eyes

of Lolth, you are most effective when  ghting alongside allies.

2/22/07   3:07:33 PM

When grouped with other fangs or eyes, you and your allies

can  respond  to  changes  in  the  battle eld  and  best  allocate

your resources to win the  ght.

Advancement

Becoming a dread fang of Lolth was no easy task. It involved

endless  hours  of  training,  including  the  extensive  study  of

numerous   ghting  techniques  as  well  as  in-depth  religious

indoctrination. For years, you honed your abilities, improving

upon your already formidable talents. But the priestesses waited

for a sign of greater ability, and then it came: The mark of Lolths

favor began as a faint voice, the slightest whisper, something you

might have imagined. But it soon became far more insistent.

It distracted you and pushed you to the brink of madness, but

somehow you resistedand eventually embraced the whisper-

ing, knowing that it was the voice of the goddess herself. And

thus, you were welcomed into the ranks of the fangs.

Since nearly all your abilities rely on surprise, invest in

feats and skills that help you take advantage of these circum-

stances.  Feats  such  as  Improved  Initiative,  Spring  Attack,

and Great Cleave are good choices, but dont overlook feats

that enhance your sneak attack and sudden strike abilities,

particularly Razing StrikeCAd and Staggering StrikeCAd. When

you gain treasure, spend it on items that improve your stealth.

Cloaks and boots of elvenkind are vital, as are elixirs of hiding

and sneaking.

Resources

You are a chosen servant of Lolth and, by virtue of your status,

few drow dare cross your path. The priestesses supply you

with your basic equipment, as well as housing, clothing,

and the necessary supplies to survive. In addition, you have

an easy time  nding trainers and mentors who can help you

re ne your craft.

DREAD FANGS IN THE WORLD

The dread fangs of Lolth are lackeys at best, but as elite guards, shock

troops, and enforcers, they are useful allies. If they have one  aw, its

their obedience. They never question orders. Ever.

Xune Argith, eye of Lolth

The dread fangs of Lolth are important additions to any cam-

paign in which the drow are featured as principal antagonists.

They use drow tactics and perfect them, and so are extremely

evasive,  unpredictable,  and  mobile.  Even  when  used  along-

side lesser soldiers, the dread fangs drive home the cunning

tactics the drow favor, and instill in the PCs a healthy respect

for their foes.

Organization

The dread fangs of Lolth have a presence in nearly every drow

city. Wherever there are priestesses of the Spider Queen, fangs

are not far. As the enforcement arm of the church, the fangs

ensure that the wishes of the priestesses are ful lled and their

enemies destroyed.

The clerics assign fangs to the eyes of Lolth. Under the com-

mand of these operatives, the fangs provide the muscle

to  ensure  a  successful  mission.  Eyes  and  fangs  work

exceptionally well together, their abilities complement-

ing each other. When so paired, they can be a nearly

unstoppable force.

Candidates are always carefully screened before being

invited to join the fangs, since the priestesses cannot

afford  to  compromise  the  integrity  of  the  organization

with dissent or treasonous thoughts. They pick talented

males (and rarely females) who are unswervingly loyal

to the Spider Queen. Candidates endure a dif cult

period of training to alter their personalities and cor-

rect their con icting loyalties until a single-minded

warrior remains. Of these, only the ones who hear the voice

of Lolth are allowed to become full- edged members.

NPC Reactions

The dread fangs of Lolth are an intimidating presence among

the drow, serving as constant reminders of the priestesses per-

vasive presence in their lives. Drow clerics are always friendly

toward fangs, valuing their support of the theocracy, but the

same attitude doesnt always extend to all levels of drow society.

Ordinary soldiers resent them out of jealousy, since (unlike the

rank and  le) the fangs succeeded in rising above their station.

Likewise, nobles fear the fangs, perpetually worrying that the

priestesses will employ those elite warriors against the houses.

Of course, none would be so foolish as to exhibit anything other

than a friendly face when speaking to a fang, but most nobles

harbor disdain for the class and are secretly unfriendly.

DREAD FANG OF LOLTH

LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (religion)  can

research dread fangs of Lolth to learn more about them. When

a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore

is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Dread fangs of Lolth are elite soldiers.

DC 15: Dread fangs, with their sudden strike ability, are

most powerful when they have the advantage of surprise and

numbers.

79

95726720_Ch03.indd   79

2/26/07   1:56:41 PM

DC 20: When working with allies, dread fangs can lend

their  skills  to  those  allies  to  improve  their  capabilities  in

combat,  making  the  allies  an  extremely  effective   ghting

force.

Dread fangs of Lolth are scarce outside drow cities, though

within  them,  a  character  can  locate  a  dread  fang  with  a

Gather  Information  check.  Such  checks  should  have  low

DCs, since nearly all drow know the location of the dread

fangs barracks.

DREAD FANGS IN THE GAME

Incorporating the dread fangs of Lolth into an ongoing cam-

paign is simple, since they are practically exclusive to drow

cities. If you have been running a long campaign featuring

the drow, you could treat the existence of the dread fangs (and

the eyes of Lolth) as a relatively new development, perhaps as

a response to the actions of the adventurers.

Adaptation

If you run a campaign in a setting where Lolth is not clearly

present, such as in Eberron or in Faern during the period

of Lolths silence, you can adapt this class easily by replacing

Lolth with a campaign-appropriate deity. You can even retool

the concept to make it suitable for surface elves. For example,

instead of spider bite, change the class feature to scorpion

sting and the name of the class to the stinger of Vulkoor.

Sample Encounter

Dread fangs of Lolth respond to threats made against their

church.  Individual  fangs  lead  teams  of  lesser  drow,  and  an

eye of Lolth accompanies groups of fangs.

EL 12: Shalzad Raelnan  (see page 78) and a squad of four

Lolths Stings patrol the edge of a contested cavern that the

drow hope to wrest from an entrenched quaggoth tribe. The

 ghting has been  erce, with terrible casualties on both sides.

Rather than sacri ce more valuable slaves in the confron-

tation, the drow hope to starve their enemies out. Shalzad,

however, believes the quaggoths have a secret route leading

to supplies, which could draw this engagement out inde -

nitely. Hes torn. Part of him feels compelled to eliminate

any quaggoths that come too close, but he must be certain

about his suspicions.

EYE OF LOLTH

We are the watchers. We monitor those who enjoy the enlightened

wisdom and benevolence of the matriarchs.

Xune Argith, eye of Lolth

The eyes of Lolth are stealthy servants and watchers faithful

to  the  Church  of  Lolth.  They  observe  activity  in  the  lands

controlled by the matriarchs and report their  ndings back to

the houses. It falls to the eyes of Lolth to lead forces of dread

fangs of Lolth (see page 76) and other drow to capture enemies

and bring them back to the temples for interrogation. They

are the secret policeand they are everywhere.

80

BECOMING AN EYE OF LOLTH

Multiclass cleric/rogues easily meet the requirements of this

class, since they have the mix of skills and abilities necessary

to take eye of Lolth levels early on. A cleric/scoutCAd can also

advance into this class at a higher level.

Entry Requirements

Race: Drow.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Listen 8

ranks, Spot 8 ranks.

Feats: Cautious Attack (see page 47).

Domain: Trickery.

Special: Evasion.

Special: Sneak attack +2d6 or skirmish +2d6.

CLASS FEATURES

As an eye of Lolth, you improve your powers of observation.

At higher levels, you can bestow this uncanny awareness on

your allies, giving you the edge needed to lead your strike

force and to attack quickly and ef ciently.

Spellcasting:  At  each  even-numbered  level,  you  gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known,  if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a

divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an

eye of Lolth, you must decide to which class to add each level

for  the  purpose  of  determining  spells  per  day,  caster  level,

and spells known.

Aura  of  Truth  (Su):  You  emit  a  20-foot-radius  aura  that

prevents other creatures from speaking falsehoods, as if they

were in the area of a zone of truth spell. Creatures are entitled

to a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your Cha modi er) to

resist this effect. As with the spell, characters that move beyond

the range of your aura are free to speak as they choose.

Blindsense (Su): You gain blindsense (MM 306) out to 10

feet. At 4th, 7th, and 9th level, the extent of your blindsense

increases by an additional 10 feet.

Lolths Vision (Ex): You add your class level to Spot checks.

You can grant this bonus to an ally within 30 feet as a swift

action. This bonus lasts for 1 round.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, you deal an

extra 1d6 points of damage when you are  anking an opponent

or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity

bonus.  This  extra  damage  applies  to  ranged  attacks  only  if

the target is within 30 feet. See the sneak attack rogue class

feature, PH 50. This damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level and

again at 8th level.

Teamwork Observation (Ex): From 3rd level onward, if

you spend 1 minute taking no other action than observing a

single target, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and weapon

damage rolls against that target for 5 rounds. All allies within

30 feet gain the same bonus. (The allies need not be present

while you study the target.)

At 7th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Beginning at 6th level, as long

as you are within 10 feet of some sort of a shadow, you can use

95726720_Ch03.indd   80

2/26/07   1:56:47 PM

the Hide skill even when being observed. See the assassin

class feature, DMG 181.

Team Sense (Ex): At 6th level, you gain a +2 insight bonus

on initiative checks and Listen, Search, and Spot checks. All

allies within 30 feet of you also gain this bonus.

Team  Stealth  (Ex):  Beginning  at  9th  level,  you  take  no

penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving faster

than one-half your normal speed but less than your full speed,

and you take only a 10 penalty on Hide and Move Silently

checks when moving your full speed. As a swift action, you

can grant this bene t to another character within 30 feet for

1 round.

Vanish (Su): At 10th level, as a swift action you can become

invisible for 5 rounds. You can use this ability at will, but you

must wait 1 minute between uses.

PLAYING AN EYE OF LOLTH

You pride yourself on your vigilance and pay attention to every

smallest detail, no matter how inconsequential. It is because

of your observations that you have worth in the eyes of the

matriarchs,  and  as  long  as  you  have  worth,  you  have  some

degree of protection from the awful torments they in ict on

those who have angered them.

The eyes of Lolth are an insidious organization, infesting

every level of drow society. As a member, you live a double

life, posing as a priestess or as a common citizen in one of

the citys ghettos. Its vital that you retain your cover, since

it allows you to keep track of the various undercurrents that

de ne the tumultuous atmosphere of drow culture.

Combat

You  never  allow  yourself  to  be  caught  unaware,  and  your

class  features  make  this  event  unlikely  at  best.  Scout  out

the battle eld before taking any action, using team stealth

to best position yourself and your allies so you can surprise

your adversaries.

Like a rogue or a scout, youre at your best when you support

other characters in combat. You can pepper your enemies with

ranged attacks, but unless you have the advantage of surprise,

you should focus on  anking your enemies to complement

your warrior allies.

Should a battle ever turn against you, though, you have the

means to escape. Hide in plain sight allows you to effectively

vanish, and when you attain the highest level in this class,

you can become invisible. Aside from providing an almost

infallible means of escape, you can also use these abilities to

strike from unseen positions, crippling unsuspecting oppo-

nents with your devastating attacks.

Advancement

The church of Lolth aggressively recruits new eyes of Lolth.

In fact, eyes are always under orders to watch for suitable can-

didates to bring into the organization. In all likelihood, this

was your  rst introduction to the eyes. Of course, it wasnt as

if you had a choice about joining. Refusing an invitation is

tantamount to accepting a death sentence.

As an eye of Lolth, it is your responsibility to gather informa-

tion about your fellow drow, to notice trends and developments

within your culture, and to anticipate upheavals. One might

expect the priestesses to take a more active role in monitoring

their cities, but their important enemies protect their privacy

with a variety of wards. It falls to you to undertake these dan-

gerous missions, to get close to the movers and shakers of the

underworld and learn what you can.

Your most important role is that of a spy, so you would do

well to invest skill points in Gather Information, Listen, and

Spot. Of equal importance is the ability to observe unseen, so

Hide and Move Silently are excellent skills to improve. As for

feats, select those that complement your class features, such

as  Quick  ReconnoiterCAd.  Also  consider  feats  that  improve

your combat capabilities and maneuverability, such as Spring

Attack, Terrifying Strike (page 54), and Shadowborn Warrior

(page 52).

Resources

As members of the secret police, eyes of Lolth have access to

extensive stores of information, compiled by various agents

working in the  eld. Most entries are dossiers on agitators,

important  slaves,  and  the  members  of  the  mighty  house-

holds.  Eyes  of  Lolth  who  use  this  information  gain  a +4

competence bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge

(local) checks.

Eyes are more than just spies. They enforce the matriarchs

will,  acting  as  warriors  and  assassins.  On  dangerous  mis-

sions, eyes team up with dread fangs of Lolth (see page 76),

especially when they must capture particularly troublesome

opponents.

EYES OF LOLTH IN THE WORLD

Never trust a drow, especially a smiling one.

Gorben Stone st, duergar merchant

The eyes of Lolth wait, watch, and listen. They could be anyone,

anywhere. They usually operate in drow cities, but

they can be found anywhereas long as

their priestesses have an interest in

the place. Eyes of Lolth provide an

in-game  reason  for  why  the  drow

are  able  to  anticipate  the  player

characters movements, serving

as foils for the PCs and, ulti-

mately,  as  obstacles  for  the

characters to overcome.

Organization

To  the  common  drow,

the  existence  of  the

eyes  is  only  the  sub-

ject  of  conjecture.

Few drow have ever

knowingly met an

eye of Lolth, even

though most sus-

pect  that  theyve

encountered  at

least  one  during

the course of their

lives.  The  extent

of the eyes power

varies  from  city

to  city.  In  some

places,  they  are  a

force rivaling even

the  Spider  Queens

church and are no longer

subject to the whims of her clerics.

In others, they are small, disorganized, and subjugated by the

subversive elements in the cities. Regardless, those who know

about the eyes invariably fear them.

In most cases, the eyes work directly for the priestesses,

 ling  regular  reports  and  receiving  assignments  from  the

church. Eyes are loners, since too many operatives in one place

can compromise a mission. Certain targets require a greater

investment of resources, however, and in these cases groups

of four or more eyes might monitor the same mark.

The eyes are closely af liated with the dread fangs of Lolth.

Although some rivalry exists between the two groups, they

work together to handle dangerous jobs. Fangs, as the enforc-

ers and elite soldiers, do the majority of the  ghting. The eyes

direct the combat, lending support where needed.

82

NPC Reactions

As drow, eyes of Lolth receive the same kind of reactions that

other drow face, which is usually fear and hostility from nearly

all non-drow and indifference from their own kind. On the

off chance that an eyes af liation is revealed, drow attitudes

improve to helpful, to avoid the wrath of the matriarchs.

EYE OF LOLTH LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (religion)  can

research  eyes  of  Lolth  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a

character makes a successful skill check, the following lore

is  revealed,  including  the  information  from  lower

DCs.

DC 10: The drow secret police are called

the eyes of Lolth.

DC 15: They have preternatu-

ral  awareness:  They  can  hear

the slightest sound and spot

the smallest detail.

DC 20:  Eyes  never

 ght fairly, preferring

the  element  of  sur-

prise.  When  on  an

important  mission,

they  work  alongside

the  dread  fangs  of

Lolth.

You dont  nd the

eyes  of  Lolth;  they

 nd  you.  Any  con-

certed effort made to

track one down soon

comes to an eyes atten-

tion, and one or more

might  be  assigned  to

watch  the  player  char-

acters. If any of the PCs

seem a good candidate

for  the  organization,

an  eye  might  approach

when they are alone, invit-

ing the characters to join. Should a

character refuse, the eye accepts that

decision and returns the next day with a

Xune Argith, an eye of Lolth

group of dread fangs to snatch the unwilling candidate.

EYES OF LOLTH IN THE GAME

The  eyes  favor  secrecy,  so  you  can  incorporate  them  easily

into an ongoing campaign. They can be a constant source of

frustration to adventuring parties. They might approach the

characters under the pretense of friendship, only to funnel

information back to the matriarchs. Such villains might even

help the PCs if it allows them to get closer to their target. More

likely, though, the eyes shadow their steps, watching from a

distance until the proper moment to attack.

95726720_Ch03.indd   82

2/26/07   1:56:50 PM

Adaptation

The  eye  of  Lolth  class  can  be  customized  by  changing  its

focus. Instead of serving the drow matriarchs, the eyes could

be recast as surface elves who make forays into the Underdark

to monitor their estranged kin. Change the drow requirement

to elf or half-elf and the Knowledge (religion) requirement to

Knowledge (dungeoneering). In lieu of gaining Lolths vision,

the class grants characters darkvision out to 60 feet. Finally,

the character loses all team-oriented bene ts, but gains the

ability to use disguise self at 3rd level, alter self at 6th level, and

 nally polymorph at 9th level, each a number of times per day

equal to the characters Charisma bonus (minimum 1/day) and

at a caster level equal to the characters Hit Dice.

Sample Encounter

Eyes of Lolth wait to show themselves until they are ready.

They are patient spies, waiting for the opportune moment to

strike. When they do attack, the results are devastating.

EL 13: Xune Argith is a particularly well-regarded member

of the eyes of Lolth. Through her work, she revealed the plot

and treachery in House Kilsek that culminated in its expul-

sion from the city. When the player characters  rst arrive in

Erelhei-Cinlu, she is curious and follows them. She haunts

their movements to ascertain why they have come to the city.

She slips away only to report her  ndings, but otherwise shes

a constant, if unknown, companion.

INSIDIOUS CORRUPTOR

Friends, listen not to the dire warnings of the dwarves! The Under-

dark, while dangerous, is no worse than any other wilderness . . .

and the treasures! Indeed, the Underdark is a new frontier, ripe with

adventure and replete with plunder thats yours for the taking. The

drow, you ask? What have you heroes to fear of a few elves?

Belgos Xarann, insidious corruptor

The insidious corruptor is a manipulator, a devious and sinister

villain who lures individuals to their dooms. Armed with his

silver tongue and his keen wit, few can resist his suggestions,

and his victims meet dreadful fates either as sacri ces on the

high priestesses bloody altars or as slaves in the endless tun-

nels of the Underdark.

BECOMING AN INSIDIOUS

CORRUPTOR

Nearly all corruptors are arcane spellcasters, since candidates

must master the dominate person spell before taking levels in

the class. Insidious corruptors are unique to the drow, and

most of them are bards or sorcerers who establish a strong

foundation of spellcasting abilities prior to advancing in this

prestige class.

Entry Requirements

Race: Drow.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Bluff 9 ranks, Diplomacy 4 ranks, Sense Motive 4

ranks.

Feats: Persuasive.

Spells: Ability to cast dominate person.

CLASS FEATURES

Although his talents lie in his deceptions, the insidious cor-

ruptor has a powerful will that he can exert upon any creature

he meets. He sinks the claws of his in uence into the hearts

of  claws  of  in uence  to  take  any  of  the  following  speci c

actions on its next turn.

Spellcasting: At each even-numbered level, you gain new

spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known,

if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class

level. You do not, however, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained. If you had more than one

spellcasting class before becoming an insidious corruptor, you

must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of

determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Claws of In  uence (Su): At will, as a standard action, you

can select a single living creature within 30 feet that you can

see and that has an Intelligence score of at least 3. The target

must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + your class level + your

Cha modi er) or become vulnerable to your coercions. You

gain your class level as an insight bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy,

Intimidate,  and  Sense  Motive  checks  made  against  targets

that fail their save against this ability.

At 1st level you can affect one target at a time. At 3rd level

and  every  three  levels  thereafter,  you  gain  an  additional

target.

The claws of in uence remain until you release the subject

(a swift action) or until it is more than 30 feet away from you,

at which point it is instantly freed from your in uence.

Manipulate Senses (Su): As a swift action, you can alter

the senses of a creature affected by claws of in uence. You

can grant an insight bonus or penalty, of any amount up to

your  class  level,  to  its  Listen,  Search,  and  Spot  checks  for

1 minute.

Probe Thoughts (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, as a standard

action you can violate the thoughts of any creature currently

under the effect of claws of in uence. This ability functions

like  the  detect  thoughts  spell,  except  the  target  does  not  get

a saving throw. You gain information as if you had spent 3

rounds in concentration. After you use this ability, the target

becomes confused (as the confusion spell) for 1 round.

Manipulation (Su): At 3rd level, as an immediate action

you can telepathically urge a single creature under the effect

Attack: The target creature uses a standard action to make

a single attack.

Cast: The target creature casts a spell with a casting time of

1 standard action or less.

Move: The target creature spends a move action to move at

a rate equal to his speed.

The target is free to make choices as to the target of its attack

or spell, or where and how it moves. The target is under no

compulsion  to  abide  by  your  instructions.  However,  if  the

target chooses not to obey, it takes a 4 insight penalty on all

attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and checks

for 1 round.

Minion (Su): Beginning at 4th level, as a standard action

you can select a single creature under the effect of claws of

in uence and affect it with a dominate monster spell for 1 round.

As  with  the  spell,  if  you  force  the  target  to  do  something

against its nature, it can immediately make another saving

throw  against  claws  of  in uence  with  a +2  bonus  to  break

free from this effect.

Swift Enchantment (Ex): Starting at 5th level, as an imme-

diate action you can release a subject under the effect of claws

of in uence to cast an enchantment spell as a swift action.

Irresistible Charm (Ex): At 6th level, as a swift action you

can release a subject under the effect of claws of in uence

to  increase  the  save  DC of  the  next  enchantment  (charm)

spell you cast by an amount equal to your Charisma modi er

(minimum +1).

Greater Manipulation (Su): Beginning at 7th level, you

can issue commands to creatures under the sway of claws of

in uence with greater effect.

Attack: The target attacks another creature that you indi-

cate. If it does, it gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage

rolls.

Cast: The target casts a spell at a target you indicate. If it

does, the save DC increases by 2.

Move: The target moves where you indicate. If it does, it gains

a +10 enhancement bonus to its speed for 1 round.

As with manipulation, subjects are not forced to abide by

your directives. However, if they choose some other action,

they do so under penalties prescribed by manipulation.

Greater Minions (Su): Starting at 8th level, as a standard

action you can force any and all creatures under the effect of

claws of in uence to act as if under the in uence of a dominate

monster spell for 1 round. This ability otherwise functions as

the minion ability.

Irresistible  Compulsion  (Ex):  At  9th  level,  as  a  swift

action  you  can  release  a  subject  under  the  effect  of  claws

of  in uence  to  increase  the

save DC of the next enchant-

ment (compulsion) spell you

cast  by  an  amount  equal

you use it as a standard action, the

PLAYING AN

INSIDIOUS

CORRUPTOR

Domination  is  your  trade.  You

derive pleasure from manipulating

others, from bending them to

your will and making them

your  creatures.  To  this

end,  you  have  mag-

nified  your  already

impressive  powers  to

specialize  in  controlling

other beings. The more you in u-

ence  them,  and  the  more  you

instruct them to behave as you desire, the more they become

your slaves.

Belgos Xarann,

an insidious corruptor

Combat

Under no circumstances should you ever  ght on your own

behalf. Its vital to surround yourself with minionswilling

or otherwise. You lack the combat capabilities of other charac-

ters, and advancing in this class diminishes your spellcasting

abilities. Luckily, you have a number of talents that convince

others to protect you, and as you grow more powerful, this

in uence can extend even over your enemies.

Some might see you as a supporting character, a specialized

individual with some skill at enchantment magic. In truth,

you control everything, convincing your allies to perform as

you direct and weakening your opponents so that your com-

rades can do their jobs.

Advancement

You  didnt  choose  to  become  an  insidious  corruptor;  you

were born to it. Your entire life has been spent manipulating,

deceiving, and creating situations that best bene t you. This

ability only grew more pronounced when you studied magic,

for  therein  lay  the  secrets  of  true  mastery.  You  discovered

that you could achieve far more with well-placed spells than

you  ever  could  with  cunning  wit  and  careful  words.  Even

better, you learned to marry those two techniques into one

extremely effective methodthe claws of in uence ability,

which changed your life forever.

Although when directly confronted you are nearly impos-

sible to refuse, your powerful personality loses its force when

you are separated from your subjects. Those who grow

wise to your nature and abilities resent

youand  might  even  hate  you.

Thus, you rarely remain overlong

in your drow city, leaving to seek

your  fortunes  on  the  surface.

There  you  work  carefully  to  serve

the matriarchs, sending expeditions

into traps that allow the dark elves to

harvest  the  would-be  adventurers

as slaves.

The abilities granted by this class

are only a starting point; your selec-

tion  of  skills  and  feats  determines

your  success  as  an  insidious  corrup-

tor. As soon as you can, pick up the

Leadership  feat.  This  feat  gives

you  a  strong  base  of  minions

that  you  can  control

easily  in  combat.  As

well,  invest  in  feats

that  improve  your

spellcasting abilities.

Examples

include

Greater  Spell  Focus

(enchantment),

Spell  Penetra-

tion, and Extra

SpellCAr.  Other  excellent  choices

include Coercive Spell and Imperi-

ous Command (see pages 47 and 50

respectively),  as  well  as  Ability  Focus

(claws of in uence). For skills, never neglect Bluff, Diplomacy,

Disguise, Intimidate, and Sense Motive. These are vital skills

for interaction, and interaction is key to your survival.

Resources

One tangible bene t gained from this class is the network of

minions you establish. Over time, extensive use of the Diplo-

macy skill engenders goodwill and allegiance, allowing you

INSIDIOUS CORRUPTORS

IN THE WORLD

I dont understand it. The map Belgos gave us says theres a secret

door right here! Ive looked for over ten minutes, and nothing. Wait.

Did you hear that? It sounded like movement . . . over there. . . .

Morzul Darkhunter, dungeon delver

An insidious corruptor is the proverbial spider at the center of

the web. Since he rarely confronts his foes directly, he serves

as a hidden enemy, orchestrating elaborate schemes to harass

and impede the PCs on their adventureslikely without them

ever knowing it. Insidious corruptors are evil, conniving vil-

lains who move their minions like pawns.

Organization

At home in a large organization, an insidious corruptor wastes

little time climbing the ranks, forcing his way to the top to

best control the institution. He manages this with a surgical

precision, carefully murdering those who prove too dif cult to

control and bending the rest to his will. It doesnt matter which

organization he joins, as long as he bene ts by doing so.

The most likely target for infestation by an insidious cor-

ruptor  is  a  group  whose  primary  function  is  exploration

and acquisition, such as the Blacklock LoreseekersCAd or the

Order of IlluminationCAd. Posing as a candidate, the insidi-

ous  corruptor  meets  whatever  criteria  are  required  by  the

organizationor he fakes the relevant abilities by the use of

the Disguise skill or other meansuntil he is accepted by

the group and made a full- edged member. Once there, he

is  careful  to  keep  the  organizations  purpose  and  function

in mind, secretly replacing key members with those loyal to

himself. Its just a matter of time before he takes control, at

which point its far too late to stop him.

NPC Reactions

Insidious corruptors cultivate alter egos and disguises to secure

their  positions  with  countless  supporters  and  allies.  They

develop praiseworthy reputations, in uenced in no small part

by their unusual talents. Thanks to their public facade, they

can move freely through communities, spreading their cor-

ruption as they go. Few people can see through an insidious

corruptors disguise, and most are friendly or even helpful to

these charismatic individuals. Should a corruptors identity

and purpose become known, however, hostilityand perhaps

even violencecan be the only result.

Among the drow, the same animosity holds true. Dark elves

with an understanding of the insidious corruptors capabilities

are unfriendly at best, since the mere presence of this shady

character breeds doubt in the minds of those who have previ-

ously crossed his path.

INSIDIOUS CORRUPTOR LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (local) can research

insidious corruptors to learn more about them. When a char-

acter  makes  a  successful  skill  check,  the  following  lore  is

revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

every plot, and every betrayal, theres an insidious corruptor,

a  foul  agent  of  the  drow  who  wants  nothing  other  than  to

steer us wrong.

DC 15: The insidious corruptor is a cunning spy who sows

discord and tragedy. He uses trickery and deception to get

his way, exerting his in uence on you and making you his

slave.

DC 20: Insidious corruptors in ltrate the surface world on

occasion, usually to lure individuals into the Underdark. An

insidious corruptor might fund an expedition, supply a group

with a map, and even offer a few tantalizing treasures to whet

his preys appetites.

Insidious corruptors dont advertise their presence. If they

have any dealings at all with player characters, it is through

intermediaries, orif they mustbehind the safety of a cun-

ningly wrought disguise. In a drow city, however, characters

are likely to be found by an insidious corruptor anxious to

use them for his own purposespurposes that likely involve

slavery, exploitation, or murder.

INSIDIOUS CORRUPTORS

IN THE GAME

The insidious corruptor is an excellent adversary, a hidden

enemy who complicates the lives and the efforts of the PCs.

When the PCs confront an insidious corruptor, they might

have to face friends who have fallen under his sway. The cor-

ruptors most loyal minions gladly give their lives to protect

their master, whether out of fear or adoration. The corruptor is

a powerful, intelligent foe, and as such is best used as the  nal

encounter in a long adventurehis capabilities can stretch

the characters resources to the breaking point.

Adaptation

The insidious corruptor class re ects a very speci c aspect of

drow culturethe ubiquity of manipulation. Such individuals

are born from the self-serving, corrupt environment of their

societies.  Many  of  the  class  features  might  be  attractive  to

players, and with the right adaptation, you can alter the class

in ways that make it considerably less disruptive to the typi-

cal adventuring party.

The  rst and most important change is to alter the align-

ment prerequisite from any evil to any non-good. From there,

you should alter the corruptors class features so that they affect

only opponents, thus preventing player character corruptors

from manipulating other PCs. With these minor changes in

place, the class should be playable as written.

Sample Encounter

Corruptors  act  as  false  allies  or  benefactors  who  claim  to

have the PCs interests in mind. They might set the charac-

ters up with a few lucrative deals, but their ultimate goal is

to  steer  them  toward  a  terrible  end  in  the  slave  pits  of  the

Underdark.

EL  16:  Belgos  Xarann  (see  page  86),  a  corruptor  posing

as an elf antiquities dealer, hears of the characters exploits

and seeks to hire them for a mission or two. After a few easy

foraystests, as he calls themhe offers them a serious job:

a mission that will take them into the Underdark. He dickers

over the price, but hes ultimately willing to pay them what-

ever they ask, since he doesnt anticipate having to pay them

anyway. When the characters agree, he sends word to his drow

allies to prepare the ambush.

KINSLAYER

I will slay them all, each and every one. While I suffer in the depths

of the earth, forced to grub like worms for food and live shoulder to

shoulder with the  lthy  sh-folk, mind  ayers, and countless other

threats, they cavort in the warm sun, free of worries, free of fear. I

say, no more! The  re of my hate will never be quenched as long as

at least one elf breathes the clean air of the world above.

Dak Falshae, kinslayer

Though the ancient con ict that rent the elves and the drow

asunder has long passed into antiquity, neither race has for-

gotten. Each side nurses old grudges and hatreds, refusing

to set aside their differences. The two races exist in a state of

war, with each side launching forays against the other. There

are avengers aplenty on the side of the surface elves, but few

compare to the ferocity of the kinslayer, a hunter whose entire

existence is de ned by his vows.

BECOMING A KINSLAYER

Drow  despise  surface  elves;  thus,  any  drow  who  make  the

solemn vow to destroy their kin can enter this class. But the

life of the kinslayer is hard, and only those with incredible

stamina and dedication can hope to awaken the ancient hate

that drives the class. Drow rangers often take levels in kin-

slayer, and among the more savage groups, drow barbarians

might similarly commit their lives to vengeance. Few others

have the burning desire to make such an unholy pact with

the Queen of Spiders.

Entry Requirements

Race: Drow.

Feats: Endurance, Diehard, Unspeakable Vow*, Vow of

Vengeance*.

Motive, Spot, Survival.

CLASS FEATURES

Your hatred for elves manifests as a violent, bloodthirsty rage.

As you advance, you learn to overcome the obstacles that make

it dif cult to kill your sworn enemies. You adapt to the sunlight

and even shrug off enemy spells. Eventually you can alter your

appearance so that you look just like your hated foes.

Mettle (Ex): Whenever you make a successful Fortitude

or Will saving throw that would normally lessen (rather than

negate) the effect of a spell or other magical ability, it has no

effect on you at all. Any spell that is normally negated by a

successful saving throw is unaffected by this ability.

Rage (Ex): You can  y into a screaming blood frenzy. See

the barbarian rage class feature (PH 25). You gain additional

uses of this ability at 5th and 9th levels. If you already have a

rage or frenzy ability from another source, the uses per day

stack with the rage granted by this class feature.

Surge of Hate (Ex): Whenever you begin a combat in which

you see elves among your enemies, add your class level as a

morale bonus on your initiative check.

Inured  to  Sunlight  (Ex):  Starting  at  2nd  level,  you  no

longer suffer from the detrimental effects of bright light, such

as sunlight or the daylight spell.

Smite Elves (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you can smite

elves once per day. This ability functions like the smite evil

paladin class feature (PH 44), but the smite affects only elves

or  half-elves.  You  gain  additional  uses  of  this  ability  at  5th

and 8th levels.

Elf Bane (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, when using a weapon

to attack an elf, you gain a +1 insight bonus on your attack rolls

and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage.

Shameful Strike (Su): At 4th level, you can make a shame-

ful strike as a full-round action. You make a normal melee

attack, but at a 4 penalty. If you hit, the target becomes sick-

ened for 1 round per class level.

Deny Elf Magic (Su): From 6th level on, whenever you

are targeted by a spell or spell-like ability cast by another elf,

you can make a level check (using your total character level)

as an immediate action. If the result is higher than your spell

resistance, it replaces your spell resistance for the purpose of

negating that spell.

Disguise Heritage (Su): Beginning at 7th level, you can

alter your appearance to that of a surface elf, as if using the dis-

guise self spell. This affects your body but not your possessions.

It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of

your appearance within the limits described for the spell.

Fey Bane (Su): Starting at 8th level, when using a weapon

to attack a creature of the fey type, you gain a +1 insight bonus

on your attack rolls and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage.

Vengeful Strike (Su): At 10th level, whenever an elf deals

damage  to  you,  you  gain  a +4  morale  bonus  on  attack  and

weapon damage rolls on your  rst melee attack against that

individual in the following round.

Lolths Curse (Su): At 10th level, you can bestow a powerful

curse on a single elf as a full-round action. You must sacri ce

two of your daily uses of smite or rage (or a combination of

both)  to  use  this  ability.  When  you  use  Lolths  curse,  any

single elf within 30 feet that you can see clearly must succeed

on a Will save (DC 20 + your Cha modi er) or gain the light

blindness special quality as well as assuming the appearance

of a drow. The target gains no other drow abilities. The effects

are permanent and can only be lifted by a remove curse spell or

more powerful magic.

PLAYING A KINSLAYER

You  hate  themall  of  them.  You  place  the  blame  for  your

peoples fate squarely on the elves shoulders. They are weak,

decadent, and effete, and their existence is an affront to you.

They  are  a  scourge,  an  obstacle  that  prevents  your  peoples

return to the surface. When you spoke the unspeakable vow

to  commit  genocide,  you  set  the  course  for  your  life.  Your

mission is clear: The elves must be destroyed.

Combat

When confronted with your enemies, dont hold back. You feed

off the  res of vengeance that burn within you, and abandon

yourself to the beast within. Using your rage to boost your

 ghting attributes, you  ing yourself at your foes with little

regard for your own safety, interspersing your attacks with

smites and shameful strikes. Should an elf manage to injure

you, you merely become more in amed with hate.

With  experience,  you  learn  that  not  every  elf  you  meet

should  die  immediately.  You  come  to  appreciate  caution.

You can alter your features to match theirs, and so can slip in

among them to more easily destroy them. Armed with this

knowledge, you can return and paint their forests with their

blood, savoring their expressions when they feel  rsthand the

heavy weight of Lolths curse.

Advancement

The only thing you need to become a kinslayer is a deep and

abiding hatred of elves. This contempt could be directed at

those elves on the surface, or possibly toward elves of your

own kind. Your loathing for your kin drives you to speak the

forbidden  words,  making  the  unforgivable  promise  to  the

Spider Queen that you will not rest until every elf is dead.

As  you  gain  levels,  you  develop  terrifying  abilities  that

augment your brutal tactics, but that also tantalize you with

the ability to blend in with your enemies. You do not see this

power as an opportunity to understand them, but as a means

to ruin them.

You should invest in feats that build upon the class features

granted by your chosen path. Feats such as Extend RageCW

and  Extra  RageCW  boost  your  rage  abilities  and  maximize

the carnage you create, while Chosen Foe (see page 47) and

Intimidating StrikePH2 thematically re ect your dedication to

your mission. When purchasing equipment, spend your gold

on weapons  rst, since they increase your damage potential.

Everything else is secondary.

Resources

NPC Reactions

Although you prefer your own company, youre no fool. The

elves are smart, after all, and they protect themselves with a

variety  of  defenses.  Although  youre  not  part  of  an  organi-

zation, you sometimes lead raids onto the surface to gather

much-needed gear and resources to take back the drow cities.

As you advance, you might  nd yourself working with a cadre

of skilled murderers and warriors who share your goals, and

you come to rely on these companions rather than compro-

mising your mission with substandard allies.

KIN-

SLAYERS

IN THE

WORLD

Soulless butchers,

every  one.  These

drow . . . they have

no hearts, no compas-

sion. They are merciless

killers  who  make  no

distinction  between

warriors  and  inno-

cents. Do we descend

into their communi-

ties,  killing  all  we

 nd?  No.  Though,

I  admit,  perhaps

this  has  been  our

error.

Elwyn, lone

survivor of a

life

The  kinslayer

to

gives

the  simmering

hatred the drow

have  for  their

cousins.  They  have  but

one purpose: extermination. Most kinslayers live short, vio-

lent lives, remembered for their savagery and the bodies they

left behind. The bloody evidence of their crimes emphasizes

their role as brutal villains.

Dak Falshae, a kinslayer

Organization

Kinslayers can appear anywhere in drow society, from lowly

commoners and servants to zealous priestesses. Those who are

part of an organization work from within, shifting its purpose

to serve their needs. For instance, an entire drow house under

the control of a particularly charismatic kinslayer matriarch

might abandon the political intrigues of the city to funnel its

resources, slaves, and soldiers into endless raids on the world

above. Not content with the work of their minions, the kin-

slayers  lead  these  expeditions  themselvesspending  their

lives in an impossible pursuit, but spreading fear and death

wherever they go.

Kinslayers disturb even other dark elves. Their single-mind-

edness, their impassioned hatred that borders on obsession,

is a sign of weakness to those not caught up in the kinslayers

fervor. All drow want their surface kin to pay for the dark

elves misfortune, but death is too  nal, too complete a fate.

In a sense, its almost merciful. Drow would rather enslave

surface elvesgenocide produces no opportunity to gloat. As

such, drow are indifferent at best toward kinslayers, and some,

especially those with a vested mission or plan for a particular

surface elf community, are

unfriendly.

Kinslayers  sully  the

dark  elves  already  sul-

lied  reputations.  Drow

are  reviled  already,

but those who reveal

themselves  as  kin-

slayers  are  utterly

despised.  Good  sur-

face-dwellers  react

with

immediate

hostility when faced

with a kinslayer, and

most cannot permit

these  characters  to

live.

KINSLAYER

LORE

Characters who have

ranks  in  Knowl-

edge  (history)  can

research kinslayers to

learn more about them.

When a character makes

a  successful  skill  check,

the  following  lore  is  revealed,

including  the  information  from

lower DCs.

DC 10: All drow are evil, but there are different degrees of

wickedness. Kinslayers are among the worst.

DC 15:  Kinslayers  kill  elves.  Thats  what  they  do.  Why?

Revenge  is  probably  the  best  guess,  though  for  what,  who

knows? History says that the drow earned their fate.

DC 20:  What  makes  these  villains  so  terrifying  is  their

commitment to their purpose. They cant be reasoned with.

They can shrug off spells, slice through defenses, and even

bestow their own curse onto their victims.

Kinslayers  are  easy  to  locate  and  require  little  effort  to

track  down.  These  characters  are  drawn  to  elf  settlements,

and word of their exploits travels fast, usually spurred by the

tendrils of smoke rising from the communities that fall prey

to their attacks.

KINSLAYERS IN THE GAME

As long as there is strife between the drow and other elves,

there  will  always  be  kinslayers.  The  kinslayer  is  a  vicious

opponent, a premier villain who wages a violent campaign of

epic proportions. The sheer evil of his purpose makes him an

outlaw that the player characters will readily hate. If theres any

reluctance to stand against him, a few decimated elf villages

should make PCs realize the danger the kinslayer poses.

Adaptation

The easiest way to adapt this prestige class is to modify its

thematic  elements.  Instead  of  hunting  elves,  the  kinslayer

could  hunt  drow  instead.  This  would  certainly  be  a  viable

choice for drow who recognize the corruption of their cul-

turebut, since they are evil themselves, see no way other

than utter annihilation to end their peoples transgressions.

Kinslayer  characters  could  also  be  surface  elves  who  have

succumbed to blind hatred, risking a precipitous plunge into

corruption themselves. You should modify the class features

to re ect these changes, swapping fey bane for vermin bane

and perhaps granting kinslayers spell resistance rather than

the Lolths curse ability.

Sample Encounter

Kinslayers  dont  concern  themselves  with  non-elves,  but

if anyone stands in their way, they happily carve their way

through opponents to reach their favored enemies. Low-level

kinslayers lead groups of drow on their forays. Higher-level

kinslayers are often members of evil adventuring groups.

EL 14: Born in Erelhei-Cinlu to a minor house long ago

eradicated by the then-powerful House Eilservs, Dak Falshae

 ed his homeland and wandered the Underdark, struggling to

survive in the inhospitable tunnels and warrens. In his isola-

tion, he came to resent his people for what they had become

and blamed both them and the surface elves for what he saw

as the ruination of his race. Dak made a terrible vow to the

dark god Tharizdun, swearing to the lord of madness that he

would purge the world of all elves. Since that fateful moment,

Dak has waged a personal war against his fellows, ambushing

caravans, murdering guards, and inciting slave revolts. When

the  danger  of  retaliation  from  the  drow  houses  grows  too

great, he slips out of the depths to continue the  ght against

the high elves and their ilk.

row employ a wide range of sinister items. From the

insidious poisons with which they coat their weap-

ons  to  the  strange  and  unusual  magic  items  they

create, the dark elves demonstrate their ingenuity

through their crafting skills.

Adventuring Gear

Prompted by the hazardous nature of the Underdark, the drow

have learned to fashion tools and special equipment to help

them survive its perils. Resources are scarce, and crafters com-

monly face shortages of materials that surface dwellers take for

granted. To compensate, the drow have access to rare materials.

Many wield adamantine and mithral weapons, and the dark

elves  have  found  ways  to  extract  workable  materials  from

other strange ores. Additionally, drow have created a variety

of innovative weapons, armor, and tools, all aimed at helping

them to overcome their inhospitable environment.

EQUIPMENT

Although not everyone can afford magical solutions to the

hazards  and  obstacles  of  the  Underdark,  several  practical

and inexpensive items help less af uent drow survive in the

subterranean world.

Breathing Hood: This hood composed of  exible lizard

hide completely covers the head of the wearer and extends

down  to  the  chest  and  upper  back,  creating  a  seal.  Two

glass lenses set into the front of the hood allow for vision;

oftentimes, these lenses are replaced with sundark goggles

(see Races of the Dragon) or cinnabar eye cusps (see below).

Two  long,   exible  breathing  tubes  of  the  same  leathery

material extend down from the neck of the mask, wrap

under  the  wearers  arms,  and  drag  on  the  ground  just

behind the wearer. The last foot of the tubes is  lled with

a  brous  lter.

Though somewhat ungainly, breathing hoods come

in  handy  when  one  must  enter  caverns  or  tunnels

with  questionable  air  quality.  The  tubes   t  along  the

wearers body, draw air up from ground level, and  lter

it several times before it reaches the user. See page 159

of Chapter 6 for the effects of air quality and the use

of a breathing hood. Furthermore, a breathing hood

provides a +8 circumstance bonus on saves against all

inhaled poisons, whether they originate from attacks,

spells, or traps.

Cinnabar Eye Cusps: These are pink lenses of

polarized crystal that  t comfortably over your eyes.

When worn in an area with an intense concentra-

tion of faerzress (in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign; see

page 154) or other magical radiations of the Underdark

(such as in the Vault of the Drow; see page 154), the eye

cusps enhance your vision. If you dont already have  91

95726720_Ch04.indd   91

2/22/07   3:10:01 PM

darkvision or low-light vision, you gain darkvision out to 120

feet. If you have only low-light vision, you gain darkvision out

to 240 feet. If you already have darkvision, you gain vision

over the entire radiation-infused area equal to that of normal

vision on the surface at twilight. The eye cusps grant no special

vision in an area that has only the normal concentrations of

these radiations typically found throughout the Underdark.

The DM will determine which areas qualify for the special

vision granted by these lenses.

Guest Cloak: These mundane-seeming cloaks of an olive

or pale green color are handed out to visitors to Erelhei-Cinlu

by the drow guards at the entrance to the Vault. The fabric of

these cloaks is suffused with darkvision powder (see Alchemi-

cal Items, below) so that they glow brightly when viewed with

darkvision. The drow use these to easily identify foreign guests

within their city. Any non-drow caught in the city and not

wearing one of these cloaks is usually executed.

Mister: This small steel hand-held device can contain a

single dose of poison or a potion. As a standard action that does

not provoke attacks of opportunity, you can use it to deliver

that dose in droplet form to any single target within 5 feet as

a ranged touch attack. The mister is an effective vehicle for

both contact and inhaled poisons. Ingested poisons allow the

victim to attempt a DC 15 Re ex save to avoid contact with

the mist and escape the poisons effect. Mister-borne injury

poisons are effective only if the victim is wounded and hasnt

been treated with a Heal check.

If  the  mister  delivers  a  potion,  that  potion  can  be  used

against an adjacent creature that breathes. You can automati-

cally do this to yourself or to a willing or disabled subject. Oils,

salves, and elixirs cannot be delivered through a mister.

Re lling a mister requires a full-round action and provokes

attacks of opportunity.

Potion Bladder: Crafted from the thin, rubbery organs of

cloakers and lurkersUnd, these items are slung over the shoulder

and worn on the upper back. They are small enough that they

do not interfere with backpacks, can be worn under armor,

and are easily concealable (+5 circumstance bonus on Sleight

of Hand checks to hide). A  exible tube made from the same

material runs from this rubbery bladder under the collar and

ends below the chin of the wearer. A potion bladder can hold

a single dose of one potion. A valve in the bladder prevents

the potion from leaking unless suction is placed at the end of

the strawlike tube. A potion bladder allows you to drink the

potion within as a standard action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. Re lling a potion bladder requires a full-round

action and is done by siphoning the potion through the straw;

this action provokes attacks of opportunity.

Insidious drow have been known to place poisons in the

potion bladders of rivals.

Spider Kit: This kit includes hand, feet, elbow, and knee

pads  set  with  hundreds  of  tiny  hooks  and  smeared  with  a

sticky alchemical substance similar to that in a tanglefoot bag.

These pads provide a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks;

this stacks with the bonuses provided by climbers kits and

spelunkers kitsUnd. The substance on the pads actually becomes

stickier when exposed to moisture, so no penalties apply for

slippery surfaces if the slipperiness is caused by wetness. In

addition to the pads, the kit also includes a harness, to which

are attached four retractable telescoping legs (two on each side

of the back so there is room for a backpack between them).

These legs also end in the same sticky pads. If you have made a

successful Climb check, you can extend these legs and attach

them to the surface you are climbing as a full-round action. You

can use your hands freely once the legs are extended, because

the legs (along with your own feet and knees) adhere you to

the wall. The legs can be detached from the wall with a move

action and refolded with another move action. If you climb

with the legs still extended, you do not gain the +2 bonus on

Climb checks normally provided by the spider kit.

Stoneburners: These are special boot tips and gloves with

reinforced  ngertips that hold small receptacles for stoneburn

acid (see Alchemical Items, below). When pressure is applied

to  these  compartments,  the  acid  is  released  onto  whatever

surface is being pressed. If the surface is stone, the  nger or

boot tips immediately burn a small divot that can be used as

a hand or foothold. Using stoneburners along with stoneburn

acid provides you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks on

stone surfaces. This does not stack with the bonuses provided

by climbers kits, spelunkers kits, or spider kits. Stoneburn-

ers are typically used by drow who are in a hurry and are not

picky about leaving behind a permanent trail.

A single  ask of stoneburn acid provides enough substance

for a wearer of stoneburners to climb up to 200 feet.

ALCHEMICAL ITEMS

The  drow  have  created  several  innovative  alchemical  sub-

stances  to  help  them  negotiate  the  tunnels  and  caverns  of

the Underdark.

Bile Droppings: Distilled from the venomous excreta of

certain breeds of monstrous spiders, this substance is a thick,

viscous   uid.  You  can  throw  a   ask  of  bile  droppings  as  a

ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon

hitting a target, this sticky  uid deals 1d6 points of acid damage

in the  rst round and 1d6 points of acid damage in the second

round. If the target takes a full-round action to scrape it off,

he takes no damage in the second round.

In addition to causing acid damage, a  ask of bile droppings

releases a powerful stench when broken open, forcing anyone

within 5 feet to make a successful DC 13 Fortitude save or be

sickened for 1 round. Anyone actually struck by the vile stuff

takes a 4 penalty on the save.

Bile droppings can be created with a DC 15 Craft (alchemy)

check and the proper raw materials (the spiders that create the

droppings are bred by the dark elves, so these materials are

readily available in a typical drow city).

Darkvision Powder: This plain gray powder clings to sur-

faces and cannot be seen with normal vision from more than

10 feet away. It glows brightly when viewed with darkvision,

and thus is useful for creatures that have darkvision and wish

to write messages that other creatures cant read. Each vial

contains enough powder for a message of up to 25 words. By

adding a mixture of spider silk oil, an ink can be created with

the same properties as the powder.

Darkvision  powder  can  be  created  with  a  DC 20  Craft

(alchemy) check.

Dwarfblind Stone: These small stones are treated with

a substance that gives them a faint purple sheen. When you

throw  a  dwarfblind  stone  as  a  ranged  touch  attack  with  a

range increment of 20 feet, it releases a burst of violet light

upon striking a hard surface. This burst illuminates a 10-foot

radius for an instant and interferes with darkvision. Creatures

within the area of the burst must make a DC 15 Re ex save

or lose their darkvision ability for 10 minutes. A dwarfblind

stone has no effect on normal or low-light vision.

Since it doesnt need to hit a speci c target to be effective,

you can simply aim a dwarfblind stone at a particular 5-foot

square. Treat the target as AC 5; if you miss, see Throw Splash

Weapon, PH 158, to determine where the stone lands.

A  dwarfblind  stone  can  be  created  with  a  DC 25  Craft

(alchemy) check.

Shedden: This gray paste is brewed from the exoskeletons

of monstrous spiders ground with silk-based oils and mixed

with various chemicals and reagents. When spread on your

exposed   esh,  it  temporarily  hardens  your  skin,  granting

you  a +1 bonus  to  natural  armor  for  2  minutes.  This  bonus

stacks with any other natural armor you already have. It takes

1 minute to apply shedden to your entire body and obtain its

bene ts.

Shedden can be created with a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.

Certain master alchemists can create shedden that provides

natural  armor  bonuses  of +2  to +5,  but  doing  so  raises  the

Craft DC by 4 for each additional point of natural armor and

increases  the  price  as  follows:  200 gp  for +2,  500 gp  for +3,

1,000 gp for +4, and 2,000 gp for +5.

Spelunkers  Oil:  This  clear,  slick  substance  is  derived

from  several  types  of  slimes  and  certain  mineral  oils.  As  a

full-round action, you can apply a  ask of it to your body and

gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Escape Artist checks. This oil

is  especially  useful  to  cave  explorers  who  have  to  squeeze

through tight quarters. However, when the oil is effective it

bestows a 5 penalty on Climb checks.

Spelunkers oil can be created with a DC 20 Craft (alchemy)

check.

Stoneburn Acid: This substance is a weaker form of alche-

mists mineral acidUnd. It harms only stone and other minerals.

It is not effective as a splash weapon, because it requires both

contact and pressure to fully dissolve the exposed material.

Otherwise, it just makes small pocks in a surface. When you

apply it with pressure against rock or other minerals, it ignores

hardness  and  deals  2d6  points  of  damage.  This  dissolution

happens almost instantly, after which the acid becomes inert.

Therefore, it is only useful for digging small divots into a stone

surface or small openings in very thin walls. It works best

when used with stoneburners (described above).

Stoneburn acid can be created with a DC 22 Craft (alchemy)

check.

Vilegrip:  This  misty  substance  enhances  the  adhesive

qualities of a web. A single vial contains enough mist to  ll a

10-foot cube in a single round. All webs in this area become

stickier and stronger, increasing the DC to avoid or break free

by 2 for 1 hour. Vilegrip can also be used on the webs created

by a web spell.

Vilegrip  can  be  created  with  a  DC 25  Craft  (alchemy)

check.

POISONS

tures and substances at hand. Below are a few poisons that can

Darklight Brew: Darklight ore (see page 154) is powdered

and cut with a mild acid to create this poison. The radiation

of the ore is diminished greatly in this process, but its effect

becomes acute when it is introduced into the bloodstream.

This  poison  can  be  made  with  a  DC 28  Craft  (poisonmak-

ing) check.

The blindness from the poison lasts for 1 hour.

Fish Glue: The body oil of captured kuo-toas is used to

create this poison, which is named for the rigidity it causes in

the joints of the victim and its characteristic  shy smell. It can

be crafted with a DC 18 Craft (poisonmaking) check.

The sickness from the poison lasts for 1 hour.

Illithid Mindscorch: The brain matter of recently slain

illithids can be distilled, capturing some of its psionic potential

and creating this extremely rare poison. Though it is a liquid

in its basic form, it is ineffective unless reduced to an aerosol

and absorbed through the nasal passages of the victim. It can

be created with a DC 27 (poisonmaking) check, though the

94

DC is  reduced  by  5  if  the  creator  has  ranks  in  Knowledge

(psionics) or Psicraft or has levels in a psionic character class

(see Expanded Psionics Handbook).

Illithids immediately try to devour the brains of anyone

they catch with this substance.

Psychotropic Rot: Distilled violet fungus and other chemi-

cals can be mixed together to create this insidious toxin. It can

be created with a DC 17 Craft (poisonmaking) check.

Roach Paste: This brown paste is made from the crushed

bodies of the carrion-eating giant roaches found in the Under-

dark. It is known for its horrendous smell. It can be created

with a DC 15 Craft (poisonmaking) check.

The nausea from the poison lasts for 1 round.

The disease it transmits is  lth fever (DMG 293).

Underdark Blight: Running a chemical solution over cer-

tain rare ores and minerals found in the Underdark creates this

poison; it is effective at removing spell resistance. Lost spell

resistance returns at the same rate and by the same means as

ability score damage. Underdark blight can be created with a

DC 20 Craft (poisonmaking) check.

MAGIC-INFUSED POISONS

As masters of their craft and natural manipulators of magi-

cal energies, cruel drow alchemists have discovered ways to

infuse spell effects into the venoms they concoct. Immunity

to mundane poisons provides no resistance to these new sub-

stances, nor does spell resistance; however, neutralize poison

and  slow  poison  are  still  effective.  A  successful  dispel  magic

against a caster level equal to 1/2 the poisons Fortitude save

DC likewise removes its effects.

These poisons are created not only with the Craft (poison-

making) skill, but also with an appropriate spell (which must

be cast by the creator).

The Calling: This lumpy black paste is magically infused

with spider eggs and can be hidden in a dish of food, in which

it is detectable only with a successful DC 20 Profession (cook)

check. If it is consumed, and if the victim fails the initial save, a

swarm of spiders hatches within the victims stomach, dealing

the initial damage. The swarm is then digested and destroyed

without further harm, unless the second save is failed. In that

case, it bursts forth from the victims nose and mouth, deal-

ing the secondary damage and coalescing as a spider swarm

(MM  239),  attacking  everyone  in  the  area.  This  poison  can

be created with a DC 28 Craft (poisonmaking) check and a

summon swarm spell.

Creeping Nullscourge: Used during bouts of drow in ght-

ing, on failed save this poison drains 5 points of the targets

spell resistance. The secondary damage also drains 5 points of

spell resistance. Lost spell resistance returns at the same rate

and by the same means as ability score damage. This poison

can be created with a DC 25 Craft (poisonmaking) check and

an assay spell resistanceSC spell.

Slowswarming: Unlike swarming spiderbite below, this

poison is for those drow caught in acts of treachery or blas-

phemy. It is usually administered to a prisoner over several

days; each dose creates a slower and more agonizing biting

sensation similar to that caused by swarming spiderbite,

but also dis gures the body with horri c red boils. It can

be created with a DC 21 Craft (poisonmaking) check and

a poison spell.

Slow Taint: This poison reduces the targets speed by

10 feet on a failed save. The secondary damage reduces

speed  by  another  10  feet.  The  targets  speed  cannot  be

reduced below 5 feet. The poison can be created with a

DC 18 Craft (poisonmaking) check and a slow spell. Its

effect has a duration of 1 hour.

Swarming  Spiderbite:  Usually  taken  to  ensure  an

honorable death (or to avoid torture) by drow defeated in

battle, the effect of this poison is like the biting mouths

of venomous spiders starting from the extremities and

advancing throughout the body. It can be created with a

DC 26 Craft (poisonmaking) check and a poison spell.

A drow traitor suffers the effect of the calling

Magic Items

Magic is a large part of drow life. All

dark  elves  have  some  ability  to  cast

spells, even if its just the three abilities

all drow possess at birth. As a re ection

of  the  magic  infusing  their  culture

and their being, the drow invest time

and  energy  into  magic  item  creation.

Samples  of  these  items  are  described

on the following pages.

WEAPON

PROPERTIES

Like the sleep poison they favor, drow

create magic weapons that re ect their

preference  for  incapacitating  their

opponents  rather  than  killing  them

outright.

ACCURATE

Price:+1 bonus

Property: Weapon

Caster Level: 5th

Aura: Faint; (DC 17) divination

Activation: 

This weapon is  nely balanced and made of

exceptional materials.

An accurate weapon helps its wielder

correct his mistakes. When you miss,

the weapon provides a +2 circumstance

bonus on your next attack roll.

Prerequisite:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, true strike.

Cost to Create: Varies.

LIGHT BURST

Price: +1 bonus

Property: Weapon

Caster Level: 5th

Aura: Faint; (DC 17) evocation

Activation: 

Images of the sun are etched onto the sur-

face  of  this  weapon,  and  it  feels  warm  to

the touch.

A light burst weapon explodes with daz-

zling  light  upon  striking  a  successful

critical hit. The light does not affect you

(in case you have light sensitivity, light

blindness, or some other vulnerability

to light). The target of your critical hit

is dazzled for 5 rounds. If it has a weak-

ness to light, it suffers the effects of its

weakness for 1 round as if it was in the

presence of a daylight spell, and is dazzled

for 5 rounds afterward. For example, if

you wield a light burst weapon and score

a critical hit against a drow, the drow is

blinded for 1 round, and then dazzled for

5 rounds as normal. Projectile weapons

bestow  the  light  burst  property  upon

their ammunition.

The magic items described here use the format introduced in

Magic Item Compendium. Aspects of that format that might not

be self-explanatory are described below.

Price (Item Level): This entry gives the price of the item in gold

pieces and the item level. Item level is a guideline for the DM

to estimate the level at which a character can reasonably attain

the item. It is unrelated to caster level.

Body Slot: This entry identifies the place on the body where

the item is worn. For items not worn in a body slot,  (held)

designates an item held in the hands and  designates items

that need only be carried on your person.

Aura: This entry gives information that can be obtained with

a detect magic spell. It lists the strength of the items aura, the

DC of the Spellcraft check required to determine the school of

magic, and the school of magic associated with the aura.

Activation: The kind of action required to activate the item is

given here, followed by a description of what a character does

during the activation. For example, a swift (command) item

requires a swift action to activate and requires the activator to

speak a command word. An entry of  means the effect is

continuous and requires no activation.

Magic  weapon  and  armor  properties  use  a  similar  format,

but  the  Body  Slot  entry  is  replaced  by  Property.  This  entry

identifies the type of item this property can be applied to.

New  Categories:  In  Magic  Item  Compendium,  items  were

categorized  differently  from  those  in  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guiide, based on their function or the way they are employed.

Items that are worn on the body, including rings, are now classi-

fied as clothing. Items that are held or carried, except for those

designed for use as weapons, are considered tools.

In this book, two artifacts occupy their own section at the end

of this chapter, regardless of whether each would otherwise be

classified as clothing or a tool.

Within a thick black pouch, you see a hand-

ful of tiny ceramic beads. Thin veins of light

shine through cracks in each bead.

This implement was devised by drow for

use against other drow, but it is equally

useful against any light-sensitive crea-

ture. A daylight pellet can be thrown up

to 50 feet; when it lands, it shatters and

creates  illumination  equivalent  to  a

daylight spell, but with a duration of 10

rounds. These small stones are usually

found in pouches containing 3d4 pel-

lets. Using a pellet destroys it.

head of an elf female.

A  rod  of  the  matriarch  functions  as

a +1 light mace. While grasped, it grants

Lore:  As  they   ed  the  surface,  the

dark elves looked to the matriarchs for

guidancefor  although  it  was  their

corruption and obeisance to the Spider

Queen that led to the drows exile from

their  homeland,  any  chance  they  had

of surviving in the Underdark lay with

the  priestesses.  (Knowledge  [history]

DC 20)

But  before  the  drow  would  entrust

their fates to the matriarchs once more,

they demanded a concession: some way

to restore the balance between the males

and  the  females  of  the  species.  The

priestesses  agreed,  and  each  elevated

one male to serve as a companion and

advisor. (Knowledge [history] DC 25)

To secure the pact, the matriarchs spun

cloaks  of   ne  spider  silk  and  imbued

them with their blood and Lolths dark

will. (Knowledge [history] DC 30)

They  crafted  each  cloak  to  protect

their consorts, guarding each privileged

male  against  ambitious  upstarts  who

would usurp their position. (Knowledge

[history] DC 32)

But the matriarchs were clever, and

they  infused  a  small  curse  into  each

cloak. Those who wore the cloaks would

be vulnerable to the magic of the priest-

esses. And so, from the start, the drow

consorts were nothing more than the

puppets and  gureheads they remain to

this day. (Knowledge [history] DC 35)

Adventure  Hook:  Since  the  exile,

the  process  for  constructing  these

cloaks has been lost, enhancing both the

prestige value and the monetary value of

those that remain. When one is discov-

ered, the various houses immediately lay

claim to it, causing no shortage of con-

 ict. A cloak of the consort might change

hands many times: One might be stolen

from one house, only to be stolen back

again within hours. The in ghting ends

only when one house manages to secure

a  cloak  and  bestow  it  onto  a  consort

powerful enough to keep it.

A  matriarch  might  dispatch  drow

raiding parties to recover a cloak from

another house, requiring them to slip

in, murder the consort, and bring the

cloak  back.  And,  until  a  suitable  con-

sort can be found, that party might also

be  required  to  protect  the  cloak  from

countless enemies.

Characters  from  the  surface

might happen upon one of these

cloaks after encountering a par-

ticularly  powerful  group  of  drow  led

by  a  consort.  Soon  after  the  PCs  take

possession of the cloak, word of its loss

spreads  throughout  the  city,  and  the

various houses work to recover it. Some

might use a direct approach, harrying

the PCs throughout the Underdark, and

others might deal peacefully, offering to

exchange it for some other potent (and

likely cursed) item.

The egg of Lolth is a potent artifact with

a long history. Originally nothing more

than a cursed item that compelled its

wielder to  ing himself through a gate

to the Abyss, its long exposure to the

chaotic  energies  of  the  Demonweb

Pits has transformed it into the deadly

device it is today.

Aside from its relatively minor value

(60 gp), the egg appears to have no func-

tion. It cannot be opened, and has no

hinges or seams. It can be dented, but

any blemishes vanish after 1d4 hours.

The only way to activate the item is to

cast a remove curse spell on it, at which

point  the  egg  vanishes;  in  its  place

appears  a  shuddering,  tumescent  bag

of spider silk. On the following round,

the  bag  tears  itself  open,  spilling  out

An egg of Lolth

1d10   endish  spider  swarms  and  one

 endish  Colossal  monstrous  spider.

For  the  next  10  rounds,  1d4   endish

Large  monstrous  spiders  follow,  after

which the bag of spidersilk seals shut

and vanishes, leaving the platinum egg

spinning in its place.

Creatures  called  by  the  egg  appear

in  the  closest  available  space  to  the

artifact and can act immediately, attack-

ing  the  closest  non-drow  creature  as

soon  as  they  appear.  They   ght  until

destroyed, pursuing  eeing characters

relentlessly.

While  the  egg  is  activated,  any

creature  that  touches  the  bag  is  auto-

matically transported to the Demonweb

Pits. In addition, the artifact can serve

as the focus component for  plane shift

spells cast to travel to the Abyss.

Lore:  Ages  ago,  a  group  of  bold

heroeshaving fought through hordes

of giantsuncovered a terrifying plot

to sow war and discord throughout the

world.  Eclavdra,  a  high  priestess  and

an in uential leader in the drow city of

Erelhei-Cinlu, was behind these machi-

nations. (Knowledge [history] DC 20)

The adventurers swept through the

Underdark, battled the kuo-toa in their

profane  warren,  and  took  the   ght  to

the vault of the drow itself. After all this

effort,  their  job  was  not  yet   nished.

They  discovered  a  strange  item  that

enabled them to leave the Material Plane

and take the  ght to the Spider Queen

herself in the Abyss. (Knowledge [his-

tory] DC 25)

Its not clear what happened to these

adventurers,  but  the  egg  eventually

found  its  way  back  to  the  drow,  and

has changed hands many times since.

(Knowledge [history] DC 30)

Adventure Hook: The egg of Lolth

is  an  unholy  relic,  and  one  that  is

closely guarded by the Spider Queens

most  powerful  priestesses.  Given  the

forces that protect it, only a few know

if its existence and fewer still have laid

eyes upon it.

When members of a rival city learn of

the eggs existence and the signi cance

of the object, they are unwilling to let

Erelhei-Cinlu retain the vile thing, and

so the matriarchs send a team of in l-

trators to recover it. The theft plunges

both  cities  into  war,  with  each  side

expending  their  slave-warriors  by  the

hundreds to recover the profane object.

As the con ict escalates, the characters

 nd themselves drawn into the struggle:

perhaps to defend a svirfneblin enclave,

or as mercenaries in service to a drow

noble house. The more the characters

invest themselves in the struggle, the

more  it  becomes  clear  that  the  force

pulling  the  strings  is  Lolth  herself,

and that the only way to restore stabil-

ity between the two cities is to either

destroy  the  artifact  or  send  it  back  to

the Abyss where it belongs.

he drow are not sole masters of the Underdark. Many

terrors  claim  this  realm  as  their  home,  and  some

compete to rule the subterranean expanses. In fact,

the Underdark teems with strange and wonderful

creatures, ancient cultures, and alien civilizations.

The  various  Monster  Manuals  and  other  game  supplements

present  a  variety  of  creatures  that  might  be  found  in  the

Underdark, from horri c aberrations such as aboleth slavers

and the dreaded mind  ayers, to tunneling beasts, foul slimes,

warped  humanoid  tribes,  and  worse.  All  of  the  monsters

described  in  this  chapter  are  somehow  connected  to  the

drow, representing minions and servants, slaves, adversaries,

or simply expressions of Lolths depthless cruelty. Some of

these creatures have appeared in previous supplements but

are presented in greater detail here, including sample char-

acters or advanced individuals, ready to be dropped into

a campaign. Others are legendary creatures from earlier

D&D publications, their statistics updated to the current

edition, and many appear here for the  rst time.

OTHER RESOURCES

In  addition  to  the  creatures  described  in  this  chapter  (and

elsewhere in this book, several supplements feature monsters

relevant to drow and their environs. These include:

Monster Manual II: Desmodu.

Fiend Folio: Abyssal ghoul and quth-maren.

Monster Manual III: Vermin lord.

ADAMANTINE SPIDER

This  mechanical  spider  is  exquisitely  wrought  in  dark,  gleaming

metal. As it moves forward, the delicate legs make a faint clicking

noise. Eight lavender eyes  x on your position, and a thin stream of

smoking  uid spills from razor-sharp fangs.

Adamantine spiders are crafted by the drow to serve as com-

panions, guardians, and assassins. An adamantine spider is

controlled by a magic amulet. Whoever wears the amulet can

issue simple commands to its associated construct.

STRATEGY AND TACTICS

Being mindless constructs, adamantine spiders have limited

tactical sense. When left to their own devices, they attack only

to defend themselves. However, when  ghting at the behest of

its master (the amulets wearer), an adamantine spider follows

that persons commands to the best of its ability, pressing the

attack without regard for itself.

An  adamantine  spider  has  two  typical  uses.  Its  master

can send it to attack, usually to deliver poison with its bite.

Depending on the nature of the command, the construct might

continue its attack or retreat once it has ful lled its orders.

The  more  common  use  is  as  a  bodyguard.  The  amulets

wearer can order the construct to stay nearby and interpose

itself between its master and attackers. Should an attack slip

past and actually injure its master, an adamantine spider can

trap the opponent with a glob of sticky webbing, making the

offender easier prey for retaliation.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Adamantine  spiders,  as  products  of  drow  ingenuity,  are

encountered only among the drow. They might protect unholy

sites, temples, magical locations, or strongholds, or be in the

company of a powerful house leader and her minions. These

constructs are dif cult and expensive to produce, and are only

rarely encountered in numbers.

Companion (EL 3): Most drow spellcasters keep adaman-

tine spider minions close by for additional protection, being

justi ably paranoid in their cutthroat society. Such masters

might employ especially deadly toxins to ensure that any who

dares attack them pays dearly for the insult.

Assassin (EL 3): Their size, speed, and mobility, as well as

their ability to deliver poison, make adamantine spiders excel-

Poison (Ex) A character can fill an adamantine spider with

one dose of injury poison, which it can then deliver as

part of its bite attack. This particular spider is loaded with

drow sleep poison.

Reactive Web (Ex) If an adamantine spider is in a square

adjacent to its master, and that master takes at least

1 point of damage from an attacker in an adjacent square,

the adamantine spider can squirt webbing at the attacker

as an immediate action. The target of this ability must

succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled for

3 rounds. After using this ability, an adamantine spider

must wait 3 rounds before using it again.

Find Master (Su) When crafted, an adamantine spider is

keyed to a particular controlling amulet. Henceforth, it

considers the wearer of that amulet to be its master. As

long as an adamantine spider and its controlling amulet

are on the same plane, the adamantine spider can find

the amulet as if with the discern location spell (CL 12th).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, an adamantine spider moves

swiftly to defend its master, blocking blows and

disrupting foes. All attacks against the amulets wearer

take a 2 penalty when an adamantine spider is adjacent

to the wearer.

Skills Adamantine spiders have a +4 racial bonus on Spot

checks.

An adamantine spider has a +8 racial bonus on Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened. It uses its Dexterity modifier

instead of its Strength modifier for Climb checks.

lent assassins. A master might send an adamantine spider to

eliminate a rival or to incite a coup in an enemy house.

multiple adamantine spiders to protect themselves from foes,

or to negotiate useful arrangements with clients.

within the complex. Unbeknownst to the priestess, Xarpenth

has keyed one of them to a separate amulet that he wears as

insurance should the priestess renege on their arrangement,

providing her with an inert replica. For now, the construct is

ordered to follow the behavior of the other two.

ECOLOGY

As  constructs,  adamantine  spiders  have  no  physical  needs.

They do not need sleep or nourishment. From the moment

they acquire a semblance of life, they exist only to serve their

creators, and follow all orders even if doing so would mean

their annihilation.

Each adamantine spider is keyed to a special amulet that,

while worn, allows the wearer to command it. The amulet is

indistinguishable from a drow house insignia (see page 99). The

wearer of the amulet can speak simple instructions to the ada-

mantine spider. Typical instructions include the following.

Attack: The adamantine spider engages and attempts to bite

the indicated target. Without further instructions, it con-

tinues  to  attack  that  same  target,  even  after  killing  the

creature.

Fetch: The construct retrieves a single designated object. If

it is not strong enough to move the object, it struggles to

complete  the  order  regardless,  until  it  receives  another

command.

Go: The spider makes every effort to move to a designated

spot. Once there, it waits for new orders.

Guard: The adamantine spider stays in a space adjacent to

the amulets wearer and provides defense, as described under

the guard ability.

Return: The construct makes every effort to return to a space

adjacent to the amulets wearer.

ADAMANTINE SPIDER LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (arcana)  can  re-

search adamantine spiders to learn more about them. When

a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore

is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

Environment: Although adamantine spiders can tolerate

any environment, their creators are drow. Thus, these creatures

are found almost exclusively in underground environments,

particularly drow settlements. Occasionally an adventurer or

a rival creature manages to defeat the holder of an amulet, thus

gaining control of the construct. This circumstance can lead

to adamantine spiders appearing in unusual locations.

Typical Physical Characteristics: An adamantine spider

is about 4 feet in diameter, including its legs. It is made entirely

of adamantine. Its abdomen is relatively large, with a diam-

eter of 2 feet; on it is set a small head with two rows of purple

gemstones that serve as eyes. Despite its size, an adamantine

spider is quite heavy, weighing as much as 150 pounds.

Alignment: Adamantine spiders have no concept of ethics

or morality. They are always neutralalthough their control-

lers might set them to wicked ends.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Adamantine spiders do not understand the notion of treasure

or wealth, and thus they do not collect treasure (although they

might be set to guard a treasury). However, because they are

crafted from adamantine, their bodies are valuable. The parts

harvested from an adamantine spider are worth as much as

900 gp, depending on their condition.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

An adamantine spider is assembled from exquisitely wrought

adamantine components. During the construction process,

each  component  is  bathed  in  a  mixture  of  venom,  roper

blood, and the tears of a dozen slaves. The components and

materials cost 450 gp, and constructing the body requires a

DC 18 Craft (metalworking) check. In addition to the cost of

materials, the creator must purchase or craft the poison the

construct uses separately.

An adamantine spider can be constructed with more than 4

Hit Dice. Each additional Hit Die adds 3,000 gp to the cost.

The creation cost also includes the materials for the com-

mand  amulet  attuned  to  that  adamantine  spider.  For  the

purpose of creation, the amulet is considered part of the con-

This creature is an adamantine spider, an automaton

crafted by the drow to serve as a companion and

guardian. This result reveals all construct traits.

18  An adamantine spider ordered to protect its master

interferes with attacks. If its master is injured, the

construct can neutralize opponents by entangling

them with its webbing. Once it uses this ability, it

must wait a short time before using it again.

23  Adamantine spiders can be filled with poison (often

drow sleep poison) that they deliver with their bites.

28  An adamantine spider takes no action independently

but obeys commands issued by its controller. Its

controller wears a special amulet keyed to that

construct.

THE WAR OF THE SPIDER QUEEN

In the War of the Spider Queen novel series, the drow are beset

by an awful crisis: Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, has

fallen silent. Clerics of Lolth across all of Faern stop receiv-

ing spells. For a time, the priestesses conceal their weakness,

but eventually the secret becomes plain for all to see, and the

repercussions of Lolths silence shake the very foundations

of drow society.

Drow of the Underdark presumes that, in Faern, the events

of the War of the Spider Queen have transpired and that Lolth

is still silent. If you wish to feature this crisis, refer to the City

of the Spider Queen adventure, published in September 2002.

If you would prefer not to incorporate those events into your

campaign, you can rule that Lolths silence has ended and that

drow clerics have regained their spellcasting ability.

ADAMANTINE SPIDERS IN EBERRON

The drow of Xendrik revere all arachnids and express their

beliefs and values in their art, magic, and religious practices.

Above all others, though, the drow uphold scorpions as the

purest expression of their patron deity, Vulkoor. Thus, drow

arti cers construct adamantine scorpions instead of spiders.

These creatures have the same statistics as those presented

here,  but  they  look  like  Small  monstrous  scorpions.  They

deliver their poison with a sting rather than a bite, using the

same attack bonus and damage as adamantine spiders.

ADAMANTINE SPIDERS IN FAERN

Up until recently, the priestesses of Menzoberranzan had a

special arrangement with a cabal of drow wizards: The wiz-

ards assembled these constructs, and the priestesses supplied

the spells needed for their creation. This arrangement led to

the construction of over thirty adamantine spiders, situated

throughout the city. However, the advent of Lolths silence

(see the sidebar) caused widespread panic and upheaval in the

city, as Kiaransalees devoted swept through and toppled the

ruling regime of their enemies. Many of the constructs were

destroyed, along with other icons of the dread Spider Queen,

but a few survived in the possession of priestesses who escaped.

Those priestesses work with surviving arcane spellcasters in

a guerrilla war against the usurpers,  lling their adamantine

spiders with deathblade poison (DC 20, 1d6 Con/2d6 Con) to

destroy the living servants of the Revenancer.

CHWIDENCHA

What  seems  to  be  a  writhing  mass  of   exible,  hairy  spider  legs

surges forward, revealing long barbed spikes at the ends of its many

appendages.

A chwidencha is an abomination spawned from a drow who

failed one of Lolths many tests.

STRATEGY AND TACTICS

A chwidencha is a bold combatant, scuttling forward on its

many legs to drive its claws into the soft  esh of its foes. It

relies on the element of surprise, attacking fast and prefer-

ably  rst. It often lies in wait just beneath the earths surface,

waiting for prey to come within range, then pouncing to grab

and impale the creature on its barbed claws. Once it slays its

prey, it retreats into its burrow or another hidden location to

devour its meal at leisure. If a chwidencha is damaged before

it has subdued its prey, it retreats, dragging the victim with it

to  nish off in a safe place.

When  encountered  in  groups,  chwidenchas  attack  en

masse. Emboldened by their numbers, they do not content

themselves  with  single  victims  but  slay  every  living  thing

they can. Only when the group is reduced to half its original

number or fewer do the chwidenchas retreat, dragging away

what prey they can.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The circumstances of chwidenchas creation means they are

fairly rare, usually encountered singly. Areas of large drow

populations might have several small clusters of the creatures,

and clusters often band together into colonies.

Individual (EL 9): A solitary chwidencha lurks near an

Underdark road, awaiting unwary prey.

Cluster (EL 1114): Chwidenchas sometimes collect into

groups of two to  ve for mutual defense and more ef cient

hunting.

EL 11: Two chwidenchas haunt a forgotten grotto, subsisting

on bats, spiders, and the occasional lost traveler.

Colony  (EL  1618):  Drow  priestesses  sometimes  cul-

tivate  larger  colonies,  numbering  from  eleven  to  twenty

chwidenchas.

ECOLOGY

Born from those who fail one of Lolths tests, chwidenchas are

unnatural creatures, their forms re ecting the Spider Queens

cruel humor. Many drow shun them as a reminder of the fate

that awaits those who displease the Flesh-Carver. But a few

priestesses keep stables of these monsters as guardians, which

they keep in pits. The foul creatures also dispose of waste (such

as prisoners that have no other value).

Chwidenchas  have  no  apparent  gender.  They  come  into

existence only through the Spider Queens curse or through

growth  and  division  (see  below),  and  their  wretched  lives

might drag on for centuries.

Environment: Chwidenchas are found only underground.

Though they have no aversion to light, some dim recollection

of their time as drow binds them to the communities of their

birth. They are extremely sensitive to sonic effects and  ee

from loud noises.

CHWIDENCHA LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (dungeoneering)

can research chwidenchas to learn more about them. When

a character makes a successful skill check, the following lore

is revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

This horrid, multilegged abomination is a

chwidencha, an aberration created from a drow who

has displeased the Spider Queen. This result reveals

all aberration traits.

24  Chwidenchas are highly resistant to nonmagical

weapons, but they are affected by sonic energy more

than most other creatures.

29  When a chwidencha charges, it attacks with a flurry

of barbed claws. The mere sight of an attacking

chwidencha terrifies its opponents. If it can, it drives

its thorny appendages into its victims body and

drags it off before devouring it.

Frightful Presence (Su) A chwidencha can inspire terror by

charging or attacking. Affected creatures must succeed

on a DC 16 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that

condition as long as they remain within 30 feet of the

chwidencha. A creature that successfully saves cannot be

affected by the same chwidenchas frightful presence for

24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes

a +4 racial bonus.

Scuttling Charge (Ex) When making a charge, a chwidencha

need not move in a straight line.

Impale (Ex) A chwidencha deals 1d6+9 points of piercing

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a chwidencha must

hit an opponent of any size with a claw attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple

check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent

on its claws.

Pounce (Ex) If a chwidencha charges a foe, it can make a full

attack.

Magic Strike A chwidenchas natural weapons are treated as

magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Chwidenchas do not keep treasure. Anything found in their

lairs is incidental, scattered, and often broken. There is a 10%

chance that a chwidenchas lair contains some coins, goods,

or items left over from its victims. Roll separately for each

type of treasure.

ADVANCED CHWIDENCHAS

Since they are unnatural creatures, chwidenchas do not repro-

duce normally. As they age, they grow larger and larger, until

 nally their scrabbling legs cannot bear the weight of their

corrupted forms.

Chwidencha

Most  chwidenchas  hide  in  piles  of  debris  and  rubble  in

caverns and tunnels near a drow city, waiting for prey. They

prefer tunnels and caverns with sporadic traf c, understand-

ing  that  the  Underdark  is   lled  with  greater  menaces  that

could destroy them with ease. A chwidenchas lair is easy to

spot; a profusion of split and shattered bones litters the broken

terrain around it.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  chwidencha  has  a

radial body that measures about 11 feet in diameter and weighs

as much as half a ton. All of its many legs seem to emerge

from a single point, but if the creature has a mouth or central

body, its impossible to discern beneath the jumble of limbs.

Chwidenchas can live as long as 500 years, but often succumb

sooner to Underdark threats or hunting parties dispatched to

clear an important passage.

Alignment: The transformation into a chwidencha destroys

a  cursed  drows  mind,  erasing  memories  and  higher-order

thinking. Fragments of recollection might remain for a while,

making newly created chwidenchas even more vicious than

normal.  But  as  the  creature  becomes  more  comfortable  in

its new form, it forgets its former existence, devolving into

a near-mindless hunter. As a result, chwidenchas are always

neutral.

95726720_Ch05.indd   109

2/22/07   3:29:22 PM

Soon after a chwidencha reaches Huge size (at least 24 Hit

Dice), it can divide. When it does so, it splits into two Large

chwidenchas  with  12  Hit  Dice  each.  Any  excess  Hit  Dice

are lost.

CHWIDENCHAS IN EBERRON

In Eberron, chwidenchas are native to Xoriat. They are night-

marish products of the daelkyr, bred for battle, and have the

extraplanar subtype. Though common in the Realm of Mad-

ness, these creatures share few traits with one another. Most

have been warped or bred for some other purpose. Chwid-

enchas commonly have the pseudonaturalCAr template, but a

few are trained as warbeastsMM2, serving as terrifying steeds

for the dread kaortisFF.

CHWIDENCHAS IN FAERN

Since Lolth fell into silence, the chwidenchas have become

more  active,  and  now  they  hunt  drow  almost  to  the  exclu-

sion of other creatures. Drow matriarchs who keep stables of

these creatures hear constant reports from handlers of attacks

on them and their assistants. To deal with this problem, the

priestesses have ordered many chwidenchas destroyed, but

affectionate handlers have loosed some into the Underdark,

giving the creatures a chance to survive by preying on other

settlements.

DRAEGLOTH

Draegloths are  ends born from profane unions between drow

high priestesses and powerful demons. Such couplings rarely

produce a child, but when one is born, it is an auspicious sign

of Lolths favor.

DRAEGLOTH

This massive, vaguely humanoid creature has the black skin of a

drow and a mane of yellow-white hair. Its powerfully muscled body

sprouts two pairs of arms: One set ends in powerful claws, while the

other has slender hands equipped with delicate  ngers. It has a bestial

face with an elongated, toothy muzzle.

Draegloths are elite soldiers that serve the houses matriarchs.

They  might  be  advisors,  leaders,  or  just  symbols  of  Lolths

favor. A house usually provides its draegloths with offensive

and defensive equipment to strengthen their already fearsome

combat prowess.

Strategy and Tactics

Draegloths are vicious combatants that delight in wading into

battle. They have little use for weapons, preferring instead to

tear enemies apart with their teeth and claws. A draegloth is no

fool, though, and seizes whatever advantage it can. It typically

opens a  ght with darkness before charging into the thick of

its foes, and it uses Power Attack as much as possible. Should

the battle turn against it, it falls back to use unholy blight and

then retreats to a place of safety to recover, plotting revenge

all the while.

FAVORED ONE

This powerful creature, something like a bestial drow, wears a gleam-

ing breastplate and carries a blood-red scourge in its huge claws. A

second pair of arms ends in slender hands that weave magical ges-

tures. Crimson eyes glitter with the promise of pain as it advances,

its muzzle spreading in an awful, toothy smile.

Favored  ones  personify  drow  values.  These  draegloths  are

especially cruel and cunning, and they enjoy the blessings of

the Spider Queen. Favored ones occupy key places in Lolths

religious hierarchy.

The draegloth favored one presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments, Hit Die ability score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 14, Dex 8, Con 10, Int

12, Wis 15, Cha 13.

Strategy and Tactics

Draegloth favored ones are rarely encountered alone. They

lead groups of drow, or act as companions to house matriarchs.

Since they have at their disposal an arsenal of magical capa-

bilities, they let others  ght in melee, and the favored ones

provide spell supportat least for a while.

If time permits, a favored one  rst casts owls wisdom and

divine power on herself, and nightshield if possible. So long as

she faces no immediate threats, she then turns her attention

to  her  allies,  boosting  them  with hand  of  divinity,  recitation,

and shield of faith.

Overseers are brutes and little more. When a battle begins,

an overseer immediately enters a rage and charges the closest

opponent. He maximizes his Power Attack each round until

he realizes the foes Armor Class is high, at which point he

 ghts with slightly more caution. Only when his rage ends

does he fall back on his spell-like abilities.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Draegloths are not numerous enough to form groups. As well,

these  ends are jealous creatures and bristle in the presence

of their own kind. They are typically encountered singly or

leading groups of drow.

Strike Force (EL 67): A strike force consists of one drae-

gloth soldier and three to six drow warriors (see page 169).

They  patrol  the  grounds  of  their  house,  hunting  for  spies

and intruders.

EL 7: A unit of six drow warriors led by a draegloth patrols

the tunnels just outside a svirfneblin enclave in the hope of

ambushing a small group of miners. The draegloth intends

to take the gnomes alive if it can to bring them back to Erel-

hei-Cinlu as slaves.

Slave  Train  (EL  8+):  Draegloth  overseers  command

scores of slaves to harvest fungus, to excavate new tunnels,

or simply to use for gruesome entertainment. Most over-

seers employ six or more guards to help keep the prisoners

in line.

EL 8: A draegloth overseer and six guards (drow warrior 2)

are chivvying along a group of maltreated slaves to toil in the

mithral mines. Among the slaves are eight bugbears, a dozen

goblins, four svirfneblin, and an ancient troll with a penchant

for devouring goblins. So demoralized are these prisoners

that they do nothing to help would-be rescuers.

Coven (EL 1415): For all the draegloths in uence and

power,  the  drow  forbid  them  from  becoming  matriarchs.

Instead, those draegloths who serve Lolth form covens, each

usually leading a secret society of four to six disaffected drow

priestesses of lower standing.

EL 14: A favored one leads this coven of four drow priestesses

(female drow cleric 8; MM4 57). The clerics conceal their alle-

giance to the coven beneath a faade of subservience to their

houses. They have, for now, set aside their political differences

and plot to overthrow the matriarch of a powerful house, a feat

they hope to accomplish with the favored ones aid.

ECOLOGY

Draegloths would not exist at all if it were not for drow ritu-

als. In special ceremonies, drow matriarchs call a demon from

the  Abyss  for  the  purpose  of  mating.  Such  encounters  are

spectacularly bloody and cruel, and many times the priestess

selected for this honor dies messily. On occasion, a priest-

ess who survives the terrifying experience  nds herself with

child, and eventually gives birth to a draegloth.

Draegloths have no need of nourishment. They can get along

just  ne without food or water, but they enjoy consuming raw

meat and regularly demand victims to devour. They arent fussy

about the nature of the meal, so long as it is screaming.

Environment: Draegloths are most at home deep under-

ground. Few venture far from the comforts of the drow cities.

Unlike their drow parents, draegloths have no special vulner-

ability to light. This enables them to sometimes creep from

the depths to work their wickedness on the surface.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  draegloth  stands

between  7-1/2  and  8  feet  tall  and  weighs  between  300  and

375  pounds.  No  signi cant  differences  exist  between  the

genders.

Alignment:  Draegloths  are  always  chaotic  evil.  They

are cruel, capricious, and full of treachery. They also epito-

mize  the  raw  violence  that  pervades  the  Abyss.  Like  rabid

SPIDERKIND

Introduced in City of the Spider Queen, the spiderkind classi-

fication encompasses a variety of creatures that share certain

features and capabilities. Items, class abilities, and spells that

are intended to affect spiderlike creatures affect all of spider-

kind. Abilities that grant immunity or resistance to the abilities

of spiderlike creatures extend to all spiderkind creatures. The

ability  to  speak  or  communicate  with  spiders  and  the  ability

to navigate their webs also apply to spiderkind creatures and

their webbing.

The  following  creatures  in  the  D&D  game  are  considered

spiderkind.

animals,  draegloths  can

change their demeanor in

an instant with no warning:

one  moment,  sedate  and

content;  the  next,  raging,

ravenous beasts.

SOCIETY

The  appearance  of  a  drae-

gloth  is  a  sign  of  great

favor  to  a  drow  house,

a  boon  from  the  Spider

Queen.  The  house  priest-

esses  pamper  the  whelp,

feeding  it  a  mixture  of

milk  and  slaves  blood  to

encourage its feral nature.

The  draegloth  wants  for

nothing during its lifetime

and enjoys every decadent

diversion  offered  by  the

drows perverse culture.

Draegloths  see  little

point to venturing outside

their home cities. Each one

stays  close  to  the  house  of

its birth, lending its might

to  furthering  the  cause  of

the matriarch. Only when its

house is destroyed or weakened does a draegloth abandon its

patrons. However, draegloths are well known for anticipating

the winds of fortune, changing allegiances before the ultimate

fall and joining houses more advantageous to them. A draegloths

loyalty to its house exists only to indulge its cruel interests.

If draegloths share any belief, it is their certainty they are

the favored of the Queen of Spiders. They see their existence

as  an  example  of  the  perfect  union  of  Lolths  mortals  and

immortal followers.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Most  draegloths  have  standard  treasure  for  NPCs  of  their

Challenge Rating. They do not accumulate wealth but instead

invest in defensive items such as cloaks of resistance and rings

of  protection.  Most  also  direct  a  portion  of  their  wealth  to

acquiring potent weapons and offensive magic, such as their

preferred necklaces of  reballs.

DRAEGLOTHS WITH CLASS LEVELS

NPC draegloths advance by character class, most as clerics

(their favored class) or wizards. Spellcasting draegloths earn

particular favor among their houses. A few of the more brutish

types become barbarians; these are relegated to less important

roles, typically as bodyguards or overseers. Draegloth clerics

always serve Lolth.

Level Adjustment: +4.

Left to right: draegloth, favored one, overseer

DRAEGLOTHS IN EBERRON

Draegloths are found almost exclusively in Xendrik, where

the drow view them as a divine race, dark angels of the Fury

and symbols of strength and power. Because the appearance

of a draegloth is so rare, a drow community that is so favored

lords the creatures existence over its rivals. Many draegloths

serve as overseers, leading expeditions to harvest the coveted

Siberys dragonshards.

DRAEGLOTHS IN FAERN

With Lolths silence, the draegloths have become rebellious

and unwieldy. In times past, they would serve the matriarchs

without question, but now they demand equal statusif they

do not outright abandon or betray their mothers. Some drae-

gloths are leaving their cities, striking out on their own to

restore the Spider Queen or to found new cults to bring more

mortals under the sway of their demonic fathers.

DRAGON, DEEP

This dragon is sinuous and serpentine with a slender neck and limbs

and narrow wings. Its scales gleam with the deep purple luster of

amethysts. Its sleek, narrow head has a streamlined, shielded crest

that reaches to its neck.

The self-proclaimed masters of the material world, dragons

are creatures of awe-inspiring strength, intellect, and power.

The  various  breeds  of  dragonkind  can  be  found  in  almost

any  environment.  Many  varieties  of  chromatic  and  other

evil  dragons  have  allied  with  the  drow  in  the  past:  from

Greyhawks infamous red, Brazzemal, to the insidious master

of the Wailing Cliff, the shadow dragon Glouroth (City of the

Spider  Queen).  However,  none  is  more  at  home  among  the

machinations  of  the  drow  and  their  lightless  environment

than the deep dragon.

Like  other  true  dragons,  deep  dragons  become  more

powerful as they grow older. The accompanying tables sum-

marize their game statistics by age category. For more about

true dragon abilities, such as damage from melee attacks, see

MM 6870.

Detaiols of the abilites that deep dragons gain as they age,

as well as other characteristics, are provided below.

True Seeing (Su): All deep dragons bene t from a continu-

ous true seeing effect (as the spell) at caster level 20th.

Frightful  Presence  (Su):  A  young  adult  or  older  deep

dragon  can  inspire  terror  by  charging,  attacking,  or   ying

overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet  the dragons

age category are subject to the effect if they have fewer Hit

Dice than the dragon.

Affected creatures must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 +

1/2 dragons HD + dragons Cha modi er) or become shaken,

remaining in that condition as long as they remain within

range of the dragon. A creature that successfully saves cannot

be affected by the same deep dragons frightful presence for

24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become

panicked for 4d6 rounds, and those with 5 or more HD become

shaken  for  4d6  rounds.  Deep  dragons  ignore  the  frightful

presence of other dragons.

Breath Weapon (Su): All deep dragons are able to breathe

a cone of acid once every 1d4 rounds. The damage and save

DC vary by age, as indicated on the table. The length of the

cone depends on the size of the dragon; see the Dragon Breath

Weapons table, MM 69. This  esh-corrosive gas does not affect

inorganic material, including most constructs.

Change Shape (Su): As a standard action, a deep dragon

(except for a wyrmling) can assume one or more forms other

than its normal draconic form. The dragon can remain in an

alternate form until it chooses to assume a new one or return

to its natural form.

It can assume a serpentine (legless) form three times per

day at very young age and four times per day at juvenile age or

older. This form is the same size as the dragon, but it is able to

move through narrow tunnels because it has no legs (treat the

creature as one size category smaller for squeezing purposes).

The dragons natural armor bonus worsens by 6 in this form.

It moves at 30 feet,  ies at 10 feet (poor), and swims at 30 feet.

It loses all claw attacks in this form but gains a constrict attack

against grappled opponents, dealing damage depending on its

size: 1d8 points of damage if Small, 2d6 if Medium, 2d8 if Large,

3d6 if Huge, 3d8 if Gargantuan, or 5d6 if Colossal.

A deep dragon can assume a humanoid form of Medium

size or smaller three times per day at young age and four times

per day at juvenile age or older.

Spell-Like Abilities: The caster level for a deep dragons

spell-like abilities is equal to the dragons age category (112)

or its sorcerer caster level (as given on the table), whichever

is higher.

Challenge Rating: Wyrmling 3; very young 5, young 7;

juvenile 9; young adult 12; adult 15; mature adult 17; old 19;

very old 20; ancient 22; wyrm 23; great wyrm 25.

Advancement: Wyrmling 78 HD; very young 1011 HD;

young 1314 HD; juvenile 1617 HD; young adult 1920 HD;

adult 2223 HD; mature adult 2526 HD; old 2829 HD; very

old  3132  HD;  ancient  3435  HD;  wyrm  3738  HD;  great

wyrm 40+ HD.

Skills: A deep dragon has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted

or endangered. It can use the run action when swimming,

provided it swims in a straight line.

PHAZEUROTH

This slender dragon, its body a rich purple color tending to black, has

a particularly narrow pro le. A tawny crystal orbits its head, and its

claws glimmer with arcane power.

Phazeuroth is an adult deep dragon who has recently relocated

his lair near the drow city of Erelhei-Cinlu. His new lair is in

a hidden cavern that once housed his grandfather, who was

allied with the drow centuries ago before a tunnel collapse

injured him badly enough that he was unable to burrow free.

Phazeuroth hopes to renew those ancient ties with the drow

to his own pro t.

Strategy and Tactics

Phazeuroth  is  a  clever  strategist.  He  prefers  to  observe

approaching creatures from a distance and keep them under

observation as long as possible to learn about them, traveling

through hidden tunnels in his serpentine or humanoid form.

If he thinks they might be useful allies or easily led into a trap

(or both), the dragon approaches them in the form of whatever

humanoid race they would be most likely to accept, claiming

to be a fellow traveler, explorer, or the like. He does not reveal

his true form unless forced to do so in combat or if necessary

to intimidate others into doing as he wishes.

If forced into combat, Phazeuroth prefers to retreat down

a narrow tunnel, forcing his opponents to bunch up tightly.

He blasts the group with his breath weapon repeatedly, prefer-

ring not to engage in melee as long as he can continue doing

so. If he must join battle, he tries to prepare by casting spell

 ower on each of his claws, followed by shocking grasp, so he

can hold the charge until he strikes opponents. He prefers

to open with a swift breath weapon (using Quicken Breath)

followed by a devastating barrage of enspelled claws, wings,

bite, and tail slap.

Phazeuroth prefers not to  ght on the wing, since he is not

a particularly good  yer and rarely has the room to do so in

cramped Underdark tunnels and caverns. However, if facing

effective  ranged  weapons  or  spellcasters,  he  typically  casts

resistance and entropic shield on himself while taking cover and

then casts darkness on a rock, which he then hurls up to 100 feet

as a ranged touch attack (range increment 20 feet) to provide

some concealment as he  ies in to make melee attacks.

If  facing  drow,  illithids,  or  aboleths,  Phazeuroth  always

begins combat with protection from evil to prevent any chance

of magical or psionic mind control.

ECOLOGY

Deep dragons are little known on the

surface  world.  They  are  consummate

hunters  of  the  Underdark,  stalking

their  prey  with  cunning  and  patience.

Relentless explorers, they always seek to

penetrate to the deepest places of the earth,

never before trod by a sentient creature, to

reveal  what  wonders  such  undiscovered

caverns  might  hold.  They  are  extremely

avaricious and covet all wealthespecially

magic items.

Legends  speak  of  a  mystical  realm  called

Azarakka  that  was  hidden  deep  beneath  the

surface when Io, creator of all dragons,  rst laid

the foundation of the world. The dragon who  rst

discovers this fabled cavern, so the legend goes,

will be privy to the ancient knowledge of the

Ninefold Dragon and ascend to the ranks of

the dragon deities. Whether the deep dragons

believe this tale is unknown, but scholars spec-

ulate that the allure of this prize  rst drew their

progenitors from the skies of their heritage to

the dark places of the earth.

Deep  dragons  can  eat  almost  anything  but

seem to have a preference for seafood: giant

clams and crabs,  sh, kuo-toas, and even abo-

leths.  (They  are  not  fond  of  skum,  though,

 nding  them  tough  and  bitter.)  Because  of

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Deep dragons love to stalk their prey through the lightless

without warning, and using their spells to bury opponents

upon ittracking the interloper down if necessary. Of late,

however, he has been entertaining overtures of alliance with

a new group in the area.

their  hunting  habits,  they  are  often  at  odds  with  sentient

ichthyoid creatures, and they conceal and heavily trap their

lairs to prevent incursions by vengeance-seeking kuo-toas and

others. However, their greatest enemies, other than the drow

(with whom they have a complex relationship), are cloakers

and illithids.

The relationship of deep dragons to the drow varies with the

dragons whimsthey might ally closely with the dark elves

at one time, and at another maintain a haughty and malevo-

lent distance. They see the drow as useful tools and excellent

sources of trinkets (as the deep dragons refer to magic items).

But they also recognize the power that the dark elves possess,

and they do not like the idea of a drow hegemony throughout

the lightless realm.

Environment:  Deep  dragons  rarely  venture  from  the

Underdark, whose depths they are ideally suited to navigat-

ing, but they have been known to venture to the surface. Such

sojourns are usually undertaken in pursuit of stolen treasure,

to take revenge against a foe, or to seek rare magic.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  A  hatchling  deep

dragon has iridescent maroon scales, darkening to deep rich

purple in adulthood and almost black in the dragons older

age. Its lithe body is designed for maneuvering in the narrow,

twisting corridors of the Underdark. Deep dragons are also

accomplished shapechangers, with the ability to adopt a leg-

less serpentine form that lets them squeeze into tight spaces

or a humanoid shape to blend in with the other races of the

Underdark.

Younger deep dragons might gather in clutches of two to

 ve individuals, but by a relatively young age, their greed and

relentless  curiosity  drive  them  to  strike  out  on  their  own.

As is typical of evil dragons, parents do not care for the eggs

once laid.

Alignment: Deep dragons are sel sh, cruel, and capricious.

They are always chaotic evil.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Like all their kind, deep dragons are avaricious creatures and

hoard their wealth greedily. A deep dragon has triple standard

treasure for its Challenge Rating.

DEEP DRAGONS IN FAERN

Deep dragons are most often encountered near drow cities. The

confusion of the cities during Lolths silence has interrupted

the  steady  supplies  of  food  and  magic,  causing  many  deep

dragons to take independent action. However, the dragons are

generally pleased that the drow are  ghting one another: By

weakening themselves in this way, they pose no immediate

threat of dominating the lower realms.

ELF,

ALBINO DROW (SZARKAI)

The  dark  elves  are  bad  enough,  but  some  legends  speak  of

an even more sinister and deadly foedrow who resemble

surface elves and can walk among them undetected. Called

szarkai  (pronounced  zahrk-eye),  these  enigmatic  drow  are

natural spies.

SZARKAI PROVOCATEUR

The cloaked, pale humanoid before you looks something like a drow,

but her skin is alabaster rather than black, and her red eyes size you

up in a quick calculation.

Szarkai (whose name means ghost spiders) are rare mutants

in  the  deep  con nes  of  drow  cities  who  appear  perfectly

natural in other surroundingsespecially those on the sur-

face. Thus, albino drow receive intense training in espionage

almost from birth.

The szarkai provocateur presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Die ability score

increases: Str 13, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 15.

Strategy and Tactics

A  szarkai  provocateur  never  plans  to  become  involved  in  a

stand-up  ght. Better to manipulate somebody more suited to

the task or to put it off somehow until the potential combat-

ants lose interest in it or forget it altogether.

ALBINO DROW LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) or

Knowledge (history) can research albino drow to learn more

about them. When a character makes a successful skill check,

the following lore is revealed, including the information from

lower DCs.

Knowledge (dungeoneering)

DC  Result

15

This creature is an albino drow, a rare variant of the

drow race, also called a szarkai. This result reveals

all elf traits.

Like other drow, szarkai are highly resistant to magic

but are vulnerable to light. This result reveals all

drow traits (see page 36).

20

Knowledge (history)

DC  Result

20  This creature is an albino drow, a rare variant of the

drow race, also called a szarkai. Drow are generally

evil and subterranean dwellers.

25  The drow trace their lineage back to an elf splinter

group that rejected the surface life.

30  Most drow live underground, but the szarkai can

pass as surface elves. They are trained as spies and

saboteurs, spending centuries among ordinary folk

as they pursue inscrutable and long-term plots.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

118

If a szarkai provocateur is forced to enter battle, her  rst

priority is escape. She rarely engages in a prolonged con ict

but seeks to withdraw after a round or two, and she always has

two or three retreat plans ready. She seeks to eliminate her foe

quickly and quietly and then disappear, leaving no evidence of

her own identity. Unless caught completely by surprise, she

 rst uses her wand of eagles splendor to enhance her spellcasting

ability. Divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, detect

thoughts, and detect magic allow her to prepare for the strengths

and exploit the weaknesses of opponents. If time permits, she

might charm a few minions for added muscle.

The  provocateur  makes  use  of  her  disguise  abilities  and

spells or hides in plain sight to get close enough for an attack.

An envenomed dart, or a quick jab from a poisoned rapier,

is usually enough to remove a combat threat. Spring Attack

allows her to leap in to make melee attacks and then retreat

beyond  the  range  of  counterattacks.  Suggestion  and  charm

person  against  foes  or  their  bodyguards  can  also  provide  a

tactical  advantage.  A  provocateur  commonly  uses  shadow

illusion and her shadow companion to cover her retreat, and

a potion of sanctuary allows further protection. Often she falls

back into a crowded area and uses alter self or lesser disguise to

slip away unnoticed.

Sample Encounters

Szarkai provocateurs usually pass themselves off as surface

elves while pursuing hidden goals that might reach fruition

only after centuries.

Deep Cover Agent (EL 1020): A szarkai provocateur is

expert in the arts of disguise. She blends into society while

furthering the cause of her noble house.

EL 15: The provocateur described above has thoroughly stud-

ied the intrigues of the high elf court, and she has in ltrated

a minor noble house by the simple expedient of replacing a

lesser scion. Having disposed of the body among the chwi-

denchas of her native house, the szarkai now bides her time

in her adopted role. She quietly manipulates court politics in

ways advantageous to the drow, sowing discord and distrac-

tion with innocent-seeming comments.

Ecology

These albinos appear only rarely, representing one-hundredth

of one percent of the drow population. Other drow hold them

in some awe, and the birth of one is considered a blessing to

the family. They are called ghost spiders to signify the boon

of Lolth.

Whether through inbreeding or the intentional dabbling

of the Spider Queen, szarkai tend to appear more frequently

among the noble houses than among the lower castes. Their

existence is hidden from all but the highest-ranking drow who

have a need to know. Szarkai are largely sequestered from drow

life, being are too valuable to risk losing to a casual murder

when out among the riffraff. Although they are physically

safer than other drow, their lot in life is no less harsh and cor-

rupting. Szarkai receive the personal attentions of the cruelest

priestesses and most Machiavellian of nobles.

95726720_Ch05.indd   118

2/22/07   3:29:40 PM

Environment: Although szarkai are born and nurtured

in the underground cities of the drow, they can be found in

any setting as be ts the nature of their missions. Often an

albino drow lives among surface elves or in cities where elves

are common.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Other drow often con-

sider szarkai to be a separate race, but the two kinds of elves

are genetically identical except for the szarkais pale skin and

red eyes. This popular opinion has some basis in fact, though:

Some szarkai have subtle deformities, such as hairlessness,

gnarled, clawlike hands, or small fangs.

Alignment: Like many of their kin, albino drow are often

neutral evil. Szarkai cultivate cold patience, and few drow are

as skilled at subtle and cruel intrigues.

races.  Their  assignments  might  be  simple   information-

gathering  and  relay,  reconnaissance  of  the  physical  and

political  landscape,  forming  a  sleeper  cell  for  some  future

act  of  sabotage  or  violence,  or  quietly  manipulating  those

around them to turn potential allies against one another or

to keep surface communities small and weak. Rarely is one

of these agents dispatched to perform anything so pedestrian

as an assassination; the chance of discovery is too high, and

the  removal  of  any  speci c  individual  among  the  surface

races too insigni cant, to be of any real value to the drow.

Rather, these master spies weave webs of intrigue that are so

thinly stretched across such a span of time as to be virtually

invisible. Szarkai studiously avoid liches, since the undying

spellcasters are adept at piercing their disguises and guess-

ing their plots.

Society

When szarkai have completed their training and have demon-

strated the necessary skills to carry out their missions, they are

deployed to the surface in deep cover assignments. There, they

ingratiate themselves with the surface folk when furthering

the agenda of their drow masters and of Lolth.

These agents provocateur are always long-term visionaries,

since their missions can last for lifetimes among the lesser

Typical Treasure

Unlike typical drow, whose wealth is stored mainly in their

homes, albino drow must carry everything they need with

them on their missions. Such equipment forms standard trea-

sure for NPCs of their Challenge Rating. When undercover,

they do not wear the spider-themed and disturbing jewelry

of their dark-skinned cousins.

Albino Drow as Characters

Szarkai have identical game statistics to ordinary drow. See

MM 103 for information on drow as characters. The albinos

typically choose classes that specialize in misdirection and

intrigue, such as bard, cloaked dancerCS, and spymasterCAd.

Albino Drow in Faern

The  most  infamous  of  szarkai  was  the  Kiaransaleen  high

priestess  Irae  Tsarran,  who  overthrew  the  Lolth  worship-

ers of the city of Maerimydra after their goddess fell silent.

She then transported the Undying Temple of Kiaransalee to

Castle Maerimydra and began a great ritual to animate the

thousands fallen in that battle to claim the Underdark for her

dread deity. These events are further described in the City of

the Spider Queen adventure.

GOBLINOID

Many goblinoid races call the Underdark home, and all have

felt the lash of drow tyranny at one time or other. Some are

more frequently seen in servitude to drow masters. Goblins

and bugbears live within easy access of drow communities,

and the strange vril have been bred by the dark elves for spe-

ci c purposes.

BUGBEAR

Of all the goblinoid races, bugbears are most common among

the drow. Their deep lairs make them easily accessible to drow

raiding parties. Although not as numerous as goblins, bugbears

Bugbear stonejack

are hardier and make better soldiers and enforcers. Often they

are bought off as cheap mercenaries and do not even realize

their near slavery to the dark elves.

Bugbear Overseer

This snarling brute is a hulking, furry goblinoid with a  attened

snout. It expertly aims a polearm at your feet, and, as you attempt to

dodge the swing, raises a clawed hand in an arcane gesture.

Each  drow  community  controls  hundreds  or  thousands  of

slaves, requiring trustees of a sort among the inferior races

they  hold  sway  over.  They  have  bred  bugbear  overseers  to

this end, cultivating sorcerously imbued family groups from

which new recruits are drawn.

The bugbear overseer presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments and Hit Die ability score

increases: Str 14, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 15.

Strategy and Tactics

Bugbear  overseers  are  true  bullies,  easily  intimidating

unarmed and helpless slaves. Their disabling spells and gui-

sarme trip attacks are well suited to overpowering recalcitrant

individuals quickly and with a minimum of damage. However,

they take delight in getting tough with troublemakers who

resist their disabling magic.

When faced with a worthy adversary, however, this bluster

quickly  falters.  If  initial  attacks  fail  to  cow  such  an  oppo-

nent, a bugbear overseer begins looking for opportunities to

withdraw, using spider climb, invisibility, or mirror image, while

blowing his signal whistle to summon help. Only when under

the scrutiny of his drow masters does an overseer stand and

 ght an equal foe. In this case, he still relies on his weapons

reach and trip attacks to remain at a distance, disabling oppo-

nents  with  spells.  The  crossbow  is  a  weapon  of  last  resort

unless he is in a secure position. Bugbear overseers are loath

to use the poison provided by their drow masters for fear of

accidentally poisoning themselves, but if retreat is necessary,

they coat their crossbow bolts with venom.

Bugbear Stonejack

This  muscular  goblinoid  is  clad  in  leather  and  laden  with

assorted  stoneworking  tools.  He  swings  a  heavy  mining

pick.

The fantastic grandeur of drow cities requires massive

excavation that displaces tons of rubble and stone. The drow

are not about to soil their delicate hands with such demeaning

labor, so they usually assign it to bugbear stonejacks. These

pliant goblinoid servants are equipped to handle the rigors

and the dangers of construction.

The bugbear stonejack presented here had the following

ability scores before racial adjustments and Hit Die ability

score increases: Str 13, Dex 10, Con 12, Int 11, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Strategy and Tactics

Bugbear stonejacks are not sophisticated warriors. They have

only the most rudimentary of training, relying on their natural

strength and aggressiveness to see them through in a  ght,

and their inexperience can often be used against them. They

are terri ed of their masters and  ght to the death when so

ordered,  but  if  the  drow  leaders  should  fall,  the  stonejacks

are likely to drop their weapons and  ee into the surround-

ing tunnels.

In battle, lines of stonejacks charge opponents to overpower

them with numbers and sheer fury. The bugbears try to swing

the ends of their battle line around that of their opponents to

surround them and gain  anking positions. The drow who

lead  them  stay  to  the  rear,  using  the  cover  and  distraction

provided  by  the  stonejacks  to  launch  spells  or  implement

clever tactics.

A bugbear stonejack typically keeps a potion of gaseous form

in his potion bladder in case of a cave-in while he works in the

mines. However, if he is on guard duty or has been assigned to

a military force, he replaces this with a potion of bulls strength,

which he imbibes if possible before entering combat.

A goblin  esh-herder

GOBLIN FLESH-HERDER

This somber goblin wears crudely stitched hide armor under rank,

coarse wool robes with tiny bones woven into the fringes, creating

a constant hollow clatter. His head is completely shaven, and his

face is stark white with ash. Kohl around the eyes and nose creates

a skull-like mask.

In evil-aligned communities, hordes of mindless undead often

are used as cheap labor, and a society as depraved as that of

the drow is no exception. Goblin  esh-herders manage these

dangerous and distasteful resources.

The goblin  esh-herder presented here had the following

Strategy and Tactics

Goblin  esh-herders are not primarily combatants, but when

the  drow  community  is  threatened,  they  command  their

undead charges as a front-line defense. In battle they direct

a  mass  of  skeletons  and  zombies  from  the  rear.  One   esh-

necromancers usually command their creations to obey the

goblins orders. In this way, the  esh-herders can reserve their

rebuke and command abilities to combat enemy-commanded

or free-willed undead. However, since the mindless hordes

recognize the  esh-herders by their distinct garb, appropri-

ately  disguised  intruders  can  bypass  or  even  commandeer

some of these troops.

When facing combat, a  esh-herder always tries to send

any undead under his charge into battle  rst. He then casts

summon undead I to create more Medium skeletons or Small

zombies,  followed  by  desecrate  to  strengthen  his  undead

servants. If any opponents or living allies fall in battle, he

might try to maneuver nearby and cast animate dead to create

even  more  troops.  If  forced  to  engage  enemies  directly,  a

 esh-herder  rst tries to soften them up with  esh ripper and

spiritual weapon, then forti es himself with divine favor before

wading into battle with his scythe. He look for opportuni-

ties to use death touch, boneblast, or death knell against likely

opponents.

Goblin  esh-herders have no fear of death and never retreat

unless ordered to by a superior. They know that if they should

fall in battle, their compatriots will animate them, allowing

them to continue their service to the Reaper.

VRIL

This small humanoid has dark violet skin with black tiger stripes on

its back and limbs. Dull yellow eyes peer out of a scrunched, batlike

face with pointed ears and a wide mouth  lled with sharp fangs.

It is somewhat stooped, and its long arms hang down past its knees

Vril  are  the  product  of  dark  elf  wizards  experiments

over  many  generations.  These  goblinoids  are  imbued

with innate sonic ability and can alter the consistency

of their own  esh.

Most vril are brutally trained as warriors by the drow

to  weed  out  the  weakest  specimens.  The  information  in

the statistics block is for one of 3rd level. The vril warrior

presented here had the following ability scores before racial

adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

Strategy and Tactics

Vril were created as shock troops and defenders of drow cities.

From their masters they have acquired an inherent sense of

devious tactics and dirty  ghting.

If given the opportunity before battle, a vril spends some

time observing its enemies to determine what sort of weaponry

most of them wield. It then uses its skinshift ability to offset

the applicable type of damage before closing to melee. It readies

a shriek attack, waiting for enemies to bunch together.

A group of vril tries to space those with Dazing Shriek as

evenly as possible through its forward line to create overlap-

ping  areas  of  effect.  Once  a  signi cant  portion  of  the  foes

have been dazed, a second rank of vril charges into battle to

slaughter as many as possible. Particularly favored vril wield

keen or wounding weapons just for this purpose. If their own

position is disrupted or overrun, they attempt to spread out

and use their shrieks to deal as much damage as they can to

the enemy.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Drow exploit goblinoids to do dirty jobs considered beneath

such cultured individuals as themselves. However, these brut-

ish and cowardly creatures require frequent supervision, and

in battle, they are never without drow commanders.

Slave Drivers (EL 812): Bugbear overseers drive along a

mass of demoralized prisoners with fairly low-ranking drow

of cers bringing up the rear.

EL 10: A bugbear overseer is herding a gang of prisoners to

the arena of Erelhei-Cinlu. Along with the group is a drow ser-

geant (male drow  ghter 7), who doesnt bother to conceal his

disgust and contempt for his assignment and his charges.

Bugbear Irregulars (EL 715): Bugbear stonejacks provide

rough-and-ready troopers that do not require extensive train-

ing and are unlikely to revolt. Many drow nobles or priestesses

augment their own personal guards with a platoon or two of

bugbear stonejacks. Often a bugbear subchief or champion

provides additional tactical support and coordination.

EL  14:  A  drow  matron  (female  drow  cleric  12)  is  ventur-

ing from the safety of her house compound. As she travels

through the city, she is escorted by two arcane guards (see

page 184) and six bugbear stonejacks. The arcane guards  ank

the priestess, while four bugbears take point and a pair cover

the groups rear.

Undead Bastion (EL 610): Groups of undead laborers can

serve as emergency defenses for an embattled city, and goblin

 esh-herders command them as directed by drow superiors.

EL 8: A squad of eight kobold zombies and six elf skeletons,

under the command of two  esh-herders, have formed a wall

of rotting corpses to block a dwarf raid.

Vril Platoon (EL 514): A platoon can contain as many

as  forty  individuals,  coordinated  by  several  sergeants  and

an of cer (often a drow). Groups of vril warriors patrol the

outskirts of drow settlements and are the  rst line of defense

against attack.

EL 8: The Screaming Pack is a small group of particularly

 erce vril who have the honor of protecting a matron mothers

personal grounds. This group of twelve 1st-level warriors also

includes a vril sergeant (male vril warrior 5) and a drow lieu-

tenant (female drow cleric 6).

ECOLOGY

Goblinoids, especially goblins and bugbears, are often cap-

tured or bred by the drow. Less common goblinoid races do

not usually inhabit the Underdark regions frequented by the

dark elves, and the militant hobgoblins are not easily tamed.

Environment: Bugbears and goblins often seek out caves

or burrows, bugbears in mountainous regions, and goblins

wherever they can scrounge a relatively safe hideaway. Those

under the command of drow are rarely far from the dark elves

cities. Vril, being specially bred to serve the drow, never stray

from their masters lands.

Typical Physical Characteristics: See MM 29 and 133 for

basic information about bugbears and goblins, respectively.

Like a goblin, a typical vril stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and

weighs 40 to 45 pounds, but it is more gangly, with longer arms

and a stooped posture. Vril have violet skin with black stripes

on their back and limbs. They typically wear  nely crafted

hide  armor  (provided  by  their  masters)  over  drab,  soiled,

and tattered clothing, and they have little sense of personal

hygiene. Vril have short life spans, achieving maturity at age

10 and rarely reaching 50 years of age.

Alignment:  Bugbears  are  sel sh,  bullying  brutes  and

thus usually chaotic evil. They are easily cowed by the ruth-

less drow, however. Goblins tend toward neutral evil and are

completely at their masters mercy. The vril have been bred

for ferocity, making them typically chaotic evil, but they are

completely loyal to the drow.

SOCIETY

The ghettoes of the drow cities teem with all manner of races

rubbing  shoulders  in  the  various  markets,  dives,  and   op-

houses. The free people plot evil acts, seek greater power, or just

wash away the dust and grit from a day in the mines. In their

wretched compounds, the enslaved suffocate in misery, and

none are more numerous than goblinoids of various kinds.

Bugbears

Each drow communityand sometimes even an individual

housecontrols  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  slaves  who

perform  all  the  menial  labor.  The  drow  consider  not  only

physical chores but actually dealing with slaves to be beneath

themselves, so they created a class of slave overseers among

the  inferior  races.  Goblinoids  are  the  most  easily  manage-

able of the subject races, and bugbears in particular have the

right mix of brute strength and cunning to manage the often

dangerous masses of the slave population. The drow provide

bugbear  overseers  with  magic  items  to  assist  them  against

potential slave uprisings.

Bred for loyalty, strength, and cleverness, bugbear overseers

hold the highest station among the slaves and have adopted

some of the drows derision for those beneath them. Despite

their positions of responsibility and the imagined respect of

their masters, these bugbears mean nothing more to the drow

than other slaves. In fact, only out-of-favor drow or those of

particularly low station are assigned the task of directly deal-

ing with the overseers.

In contrast to the bullying overseers, bugbear stonejacks

are miners and construction workers. They not only build the

fabulous drow structures, but they also discover and tap the

rich veins of ore and precious stones so in demand by their

masters. Stonejacks typically work long shifts in dank, stuffy

tunnels, driving steel and moving stone. They are servants

rather than slaves, and after a grueling days work, they return

to their shabby tenements. Their life is hard but not unbearable,

and they take a grim pride in their simple lot. These bugbears

share a touch of pragmatic optimism that is atypical among the

servants of the drow, and they cherish the meager belongings

they are able to acquire.

Bugbear  stonejacks  serve  a  secondary  role  as  irregular

troops.  The  drow  typically  do  not  allow  their  servants  to

train  in  the  martial  skills  unless  speci cally  for  the  gladi-

atorial  arenasand  these  only  under  careful  guardto

avoid an uprising. Yet they are averse to exposing themselves

to  danger  in  battle.  The  hardy  and  loyal  stonejacks  are  an

excellent solution to this conundrum: They do not require

extensive training and are unlikely to organize any serious

revolt. Stonejacks suffer a high casualty rate in battle against

capable foes, but the bugbear warrens teem with laborers that

can easily replace those losses.

Goblins

Most numerous of the goblinoid slaves are the lowly goblins,

who  are  the  most  expendable  in  the  drows  eyes.  They  are

mere chattel, forced to perform the most onerous or danger-

ous tasks. Their lives are particularly brutal and short, since

they  usually  dont  even  have  the  opportunity  to  improve

their station by serving as soldiers. Exceptional individuals

GOBLINOID LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge

(history), or Knowledge (local) can research goblinoids that

serve the drow to learn more about them. When a character

makes a successful skill check, the following lore is revealed,

including the information from lower DCs.

Knowledge (arcana)

DC  Result

10

This strange-looking goblinoid is a vril, a magically

altered goblin. This result reveals all goblinoid traits.

15  Vril have innate sonic attacks and are resistant to

sonic damage.

20  Although they are calculating and ferocious, vril are

bred to obey drow. They serve as defenders of drow

cities.

25  A few vril have escaped drow servitude and have

established hidden colonies in the Underdark.

Knowledge (history)

DC  Result

10  Drow enslave many races they consider to be

inferior, especially goblinoids that inhabit the same

regions of the Underdark.

15  Although members of some enslaved races have

limited autonomy within drow society, the drow

despise them and think nothing of throwing away

their lives to save their own.

20  Drow forbid all their slaves from worshiping Lolth,

and they strongly discourage worship of other

deities.

Knowledge (local)

DC  Result

10

This is a goblinoid, either a bugbear or a goblin. This

result reveals all goblinoid traits.

15  Goblins serve drow mainly as slaves and breeding

stock. Bugbears often fill enforcement positions,

and some are trained for construction and mining.

20  A few goblins are indoctrinated into the worship of

Nerull and become clerical handlers of undead

laborers and soldiers.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

are occasionally hand-picked from the miserable throngs to

become personal servants or guards. Otherwise, goblins are

useful only as breeding stock to produce vril and the psionic

bluesEPH, which the drow hope to exploit to gain dominance

over the illithids. Rumors speak of secret programs to breed

a  legendary  type  of  goblinoid  known  as  a  nilbog  for  some

nefarious purpose.

Most of these creatures live in utter squalor and must scav-

enge for even the basic necessities of life. Goblins are usually

bullied by stronger races and grow apathetic in the face of

brutality, and they are not known for cleverness or ingenuity.

Thus, they are assigned menial labor, such as tending roth

herds, mucking out cesspools, harvesting fungi, and dredging

subterranean channels. And if some particularly poisonous or

sentient fungus or hitherto unknown sewer-dwelling mon-

ster kills off a few dozen goblins, the drow hardly even pay

attention. The bugbear overseers get the rest back to work as

quickly as possible and replenish the stock at the slave mar-

kets on the morrow.

However,  exceptional  goblins  who  show  promise  early

in  life  are  destined  for  a  special  role.  These  youngsters  are

removed from their warrens and housed in special cloisters

dedicated to Nerull, one of the few deities other than Lolth

whose  worship  is  openly  accepted  among  the  drow.  These

religious communities train the prospective goblin candidates

(those that survive the rigors of indoctrination) to serve as

 esh-herders. The drow create nearly endless ranks of skeletons

and zombies to perform tasks that are beneath even the lowly

goblin slaves. Undead can arise under other circumstances as

well: Slain enemies are animated as guardians of their killers,

and victims of strife and predators rise as slavering ghouls that

wander  the  streets.  The   esh-herders  not  only  marshal  the

undead laborers, but they also control and contain the more

free-willed undead that could otherwise become a hazard to

the city dwellers.

Vril

The drow treat vril little better than animals, yet generations

of specialized breeding have produced unquestioned loyalty.

Vril fear and obey the drow instinctively. They serve as shock

troops  and  city  defenders,  and  they  are  the  only  slave  race

allowed to formally train for combat. Vril are usually quartered

in warrens and barracks separate from the other drow thralls,

though their living conditions are no better. Although they

might grumble about their lot in life, rarely do they think to

do something about it.

Vril share few traits with their goblin kin. The drow wiz-

ards who created them sought to expunge many of the races

characteristic weaknesses. Like their cousins, they are mali-

cious  little  creatures,  but  while  goblins  are  cowardly  and

undisciplined, vril are bold, daring, and organized. Genera-

tions of mistreatment at the hands of the drow have also built

up a  ercely stubborn resolve. The race now breeds true, but

attempts to cross vril with other goblinoid races produce only

stillborn offspring, perhaps as a result of deliberate design. Vril

view ordinary goblins as inferior but have a cautious respect

for  larger  humanoids  such  as  humans,  orcs,  half-orcs,  and

hobgoblins. They avoid bugbears, which dislike the strange

little creatures.

Vril typically form squads of  ve to eight individuals and

platoons of ten to forty (plus one 5th-level sergeant per ten

vril and one lieutenant of 6th8th level). A company of vril

might have as many as 200 members plus the same number

of  noncombatant  young;  it  includes  one  5th-level  sergeant

per ten adults, three to six lieutenants of 6th8th level, and a

captain of 9th10th level.

TYPICAL TREASURE

As servant races, goblinoids living among the drow acquire

virtually no possessions. Those in positions of minor author-

ity, such as bugbear overseers or goblin  esh-herders, receive

mundane and magical equipment from their masters but do not

carry other kinds of treasure. Such equipment has a standard

value for characters of their Challenge Rating.

GOBLINOIDS AS CHARACTERS

See MM 29 and 134 for information about bugbears and gob-

lins as characters.

Vril as Characters

Most vril are warriors or barbarians that serve in the armies

of the drow. Vril are usually agnostic, since the drow crush

any religious inclination and do not permit them to venerate

Lolth. Thus, clerics are rare. Vril clerics sometimes worship

Maglubiyet in secret, but adepts are more common. Clerics

of Maglubiyet have access to two of the following domains:

Chaos, Evil, and Trickery.

Some exceptional individuals have managed to throw off

the yoke of servitude and escape their drow masters. Small,

hidden communities of free vril exist throughout the Under-

dark, and they include members of various character classes.

Clerics are more common in these settlements, and Maglubiyet

is worshiped openly.

Vril characters possess the following racial traits.

 Humanoid (goblinoid) type.

 +2 Constitution, 2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma.

 Small size: +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack

rolls, +4 bonus on Hide checks, 4 penalty on grapple checks,

HUSK VERMIN

Husk vermin are undead creatures formed from the carapaces

of monstrous vermin, animated by evil spirits.

HUGE HUSK SCORPION

Scuttling forward is a massive scorpion. Its dead-black exoskeleton is

pocked with noticeable holes. It raises its stinger, which glows with

an unholy light.

A husk scorpion is a relentless hunter, seeming to delight in

the suffering it causes.

Strategy and Tactics

A husk scorpion is solitary, prowling over rocks and debris,

searching for prey much as its living kin do. When a husk

scorpion  attacks,  it  swiftly  closes,  then  makes  full  attacks

until either it or its opponent is destroyed.

MEDIUM HUSK SPIDER

As this big spider creeps forward to attack, you notice that a few of its

eyes leak a pale  uid, and the stench of decay  lls your nostrils.

Drow  priestesses  sometimes  create  husk  spiders  from  par-

ticularly beloved pets to ensure they are never without their

favored  companion.  Also,  the  drow  are  quick  to  turn  slain

spiders  into  undead  to  prove  their  devotion  to  the  Spider

Queen.

The  above  example  is  based  on  a  hunting  spider  (MM

289).

Strategy and Tactics

Medium husk spiders congregate in groups of two to three,

using pack tactics to bring down their prey. They circle the

opponent, each taking turns biting it until it becomes so weak

that the group can tear it to pieces.

HUSK WIDOWMAKER

This  massive  spider  has  a  swollen  abdomen,  from  which  drips  a

noxious  uid that stinks of death. It  xes you with its ghostly eyes

as it prepares to charge.

Drow necromancers raise widowmakers speci cally to trans-

form into husk vermin. Since they retain their ability to be

easily trained, even as undead creatures, they are ideal mounts

for Lolths high priestesses.

Strategy and Tactics

A husk widowmaker is a violent and destructive monster. It

leaps into battle, charging the closest foe to bite and weaken

its opponent. It has no regard for danger and  ings itself at

its  enemies  with  reckless  abandon.  Only  when  under  the

 rm guidance of a rider does a husk widowmaker  ght with

caution.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Husk  vermin,  like  any  other  undead,  prey  on  the  living.

In  many  ways,  they  behave  like  their  living  counterparts,

although they are far more malevolent.

Individual (EL 114): Solitary husk vermin either have

yet to establish a colony or are soldiers in the service of their

creators.

EL 9: A solitary Huge husk scorpion lurks in the heart of the

desert, haunting an ancient tomb of a forgotten civilization.

It unknowingly protects a far worse evil below.

Colony (EL 220): Many husk vermin haunt their former

territory, transforming their living fellows into husk vermin,

until they establish an entire colony of undead.

EL  7:  Hidden  in  a  grotto  just  outside  Erelhei-Cinlu  is  a

nest of six Medium husk spiders. Having subverted all the

living spiders, they now range out from their lair to trouble

travelersthough theyve learned to avoid the dark elves.

Cavalry  (EL  220):  Some  particularly  loathsome  drow

intentionally create husk vermin to better control them.

EL 11: A Lolth-touched drow ranger (MM4 92) rides a husk

widowmaker on the outskirts of an illithid stronghold. For

weeks, the pair has butchered mind  ayers and their slaves,

causing tremendous trouble for that foul community.

ECOLOGY

As  undead  creatures,  husk  vermin  have  no  more  need  of

food,  sleep,  or  many  of  the  other  things  their  living  kin

require.  They  continue  to  hunt  and  feast,  as  if  driven  by

some unholy urge, even though they have a spark of intel-

ligence. When given the opportunity, a husk vermin preys

on its own kind to create more undead, and some regions

of the Underdark are infested by entire colonies of these

abominations.

Many  drow  see  the  practice  of  creating  husk  vermin

as  a  growing  trend.  Some  priestesses  actually  prefer  the

undead creatures, which are smarter and easier to control

(through channeling negative energy). Husk spiders and

other undead vermin can be guardians, mounts, or even

companions.

Environment:  Husk  vermin  are  found  mostly  under-

ground, in the company of drow, even though they have no

vulnerability to sunlight. A few lurk in the same territories

they did in life, haunting forests in the tatters of their old

webs, or stalking the tunnels of their burrows.

Typical Physical Characteristics: That a husk vermin

is not a normal specimen of its kind is quickly apparent just

by  looking  at  it.  These  creatures  exhibit  varying  states  of

decay, with missing legs or eyes, or gaping holes in their exo-

skeletons. They also have a rancid stink about them, smelling

of the grave.

Alignment: The creation of a husk vermin infuses it with

an evil spirit of dark energy and vicious purpose. Husk vermin

are always chaotic evil.

Typical Treasure

If  the  base  creature  ordinarily  possesses  treasure,  the

husk vermin creature does too, according to its Challenge

Rating.

For Player Characters

A character can create a husk vermin by casting a create greater

undead spell.

Husk Vermin in Eberron

Husk vermin are almost exclusively found in the jungles of

Xendrik,  where  the  drow  transform  monstrous  scorpions

in profane rituals celebrating Vulkoor. The dark elves some-

times use the largest husk scorpions as massive war platforms,

launching barrages of poisoned arrows and spears from the

backs of these deadly creatures.

Husk Vermin in Faern

Husk vermin, speci cally husk spiders, are animated by evil

spirits conjured from the realm of Kiaransalee. They appeared

in appalling numbers during the deitys rise to power. During

the War of the Spider Queen, her priestesses turned the sacred

spiders into undead mockeries and sent them against the hold-

outs who remained loyal to the Spider Queen.

KUO-TOA

These  shlike beings of the Underdark and the deeps inspire

terror  with  their  alien  appearance  and  psyche.  The  cold,

unblinking stare of their bulbous eyes and the horri c reek of

decayed sea life that always hovers around them bring a chill

to the spine of the most stalwart warrior. What goes on inside

the  inhuman  minds  of  these  cold-blooded  creatures  de es

contemplation, and what ancient horrors they consort with in

the deepest chasms of the world are better left unknown.

WHIP

The  scaly  armor  of  this  threatening  creature  only  emphasizes  its

 shlike features. It wields a long staff equipped with a set of toothy

pincers, and electricity crackles around the weapons haft.

Whips are priests of Blibdoolpoolp, the Sea Mother, and devote

their whole being to her worship. They lead kuo-toas in daily

worship, ritual sacri ces, and military actions.

The whip presented here had the following ability scores

before racial adjustments and Hit Die ability score increases:

Str 12, Dex 13, Con 8, Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 14.

Strategy and Tactics

In battle, whips typically lead from the rear, rallying the kuo-

toa soldiers and coordinating their movements. They use their

spells  to  defend  themselves,  to  augment  their  troops,  and

especially to watch for enemy spellcasters. Once they have

identi ed  spellcasting  opponents,  the  whips  immediately

dispatch  troopsusually  led  by  the   ercest  monitorsto

attack them directly, thus providing a distraction that allows

the  whips  to  gain  an  advantageous  position.  Whips  expect

their  followers  to   ght  to  the  death  if  necessary  to  accom-

plish this end.

Once within range, whips coordinate to cast silence on the

entire area containing enemy spellcasters. The sudden quiet

signals the soldiers to disengage. The whips next start pum-

meling  the  enemy  position  with  lightning  bolts.  After  the

initial barrage, they send their underlings back in to mop up

the remaining combatants and close themselves to ensnare any

still-living casters with their pincer staffs. They prefer to take

captives alive if possible for their sacri ces to the Sea Mother.

MONITOR

A scaled,  shlike being leaps at you, its webbed hands and feet thrash-

ing in a blur of deadly motion.

Monitors are special kuo-toas trained as monks from the time

they leave the  ngerling pool. A rigid system of discipline and

privation hardens their bodies and psyches to create emotion-

less guardians of the race.

The monitor presented here had the following ability scores

before  racial  adjustments,  Hit  Die  ability  score  increases,

and equipment bonuses: Str 12, Dex 15, Con 10, Int 8, Wis

14, Cha 13.

ECOLOGY

Once a dominant race in a time before

the  coming  of  the  soft,  warm-blooded

peoples, kuo-toas have been in a millen-

nia-long decline. As their numbers dwindle,

they  retreat  ever  farther  into  the  worlds

roots. There they cultivate temples to Blib-

doolpoolp in sunless, hidden lakes, plotting

a glorious return to power.

Behind  their  bulging,  emotionless  eyes

lurks an ice-cold fury. Dreams of vengeance

against  the  soft  ones   ll  kuo-toas  thoughts,

and a thread of insanity runs deep through the

psyche of the race. Its source could be the kuo-toas

long history of setback and decline, dark dealings in

primordial times with beings of power and madness, or

simply a recessive trait that occasionally surfaces. Whatever

the cause, psychopathic episodes break out from time to time

among kuo-toas, usually in the form of homicidal rages.

For some unknown reason, despite their animosity toward

most humanoid races, the kuo-toas treat the drow as friends

or at least useful allies. Only drow are allowed free access to

kuo-toa temples and settlements, and they are virtually the

only people the kuo-toas dont attack on sight. Likewise,

KUO-TOA LORE

Characters who have ranks in Knowledge (nature) or Knowl-

edge  (religion)  can  research  kuo-toas  to  learn  more  about

them. When a character makes a successful skill check, the

This is a kuo-toa, a fishlike being of deep waters and

Underdark caves. This result reveals all monstrous

humanoid traits.

Kuo-toas have excellent vision and can even notice

the movement of invisible things. They are

unaffected by paralysis and poison, and they are

resistant to electricity.

22  Kuo-toas once controlled a vast empire, but their

power waned as other races outnumbered them.

They retreated into the oceans and the Underdark,

where they now plot revenge.

Knowledge (religion)

DC  Result

15  Kuo-toas worship Blibdoolpoolp, a terrible deity they

call the Sea Mother.

20  The high priests of the Sea Mother completely

dominate kuo-toa society. Clerics called whips

enforce the Sea Mothers will and can produce

lightning bolts by working together.

25  The Sea Mothers rites are unspeakably vile and

cruel. The goddess especially delights in sacrifices of

spellcasters by slow drowning.

A kuo-toa whip

Strategy and Tactics

Monitors are whirlwinds of fury in melee combat. An indi-

vidual monitor attempts to quickly overcome his foes under

an onslaught of attacks, using Paralyzing Fists when feasible.

In battle, monitors serve as the  eld captains who command

the  troops,  coordinating  their  movements  with  the  tactics

of  the  whips.  Groups  of  monitors  lead  kuo-toa  warriors  in

charges and attempt to stun, paralyze, or otherwise distract

enemy commanders and spellcasters in order to soften them

up for the whips spells and lightning bolts.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Patrols of kuo-toas, led by whips and monitors, protect their

hidden  cities.  Larger  groups  mount  attacks  against  other

Underdark dwellers.

EL 812: A typical patrol contains two to four kuo-toa war-

riors led by a whip. A squad might have up to a dozen warriors

under the command of several monitors and whips.

EL 10: The whip described above leads a patrol of four kuo-

toas to defend the precinct of the Sea Mothers temple.

EL 13+: Bands of twenty to  fty kuo-toas and their com-

manders  raid  other  subterranean  communities  for  slaves,

sacri ces, and treasure.

EL 16: Two whips, four monitors, and forty kuo-toa soldiers

(including  ve 3rd-level  ghters acting as sergeants) form a

raiding party.

Pincer Staff (Ex) If this kuo-toa whip hits a Small to Large

opponent with her pincer staff attack, she can attempt to

start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks

of opportunity. If she wins the grapple check, she

establishes a hold and deals 1d10+4 points of damage

Punish the Infidels (Sp) All foes within 30 feet who can see

Lightning Bolt (Su) Two or more kuo-toa whips can generate

a stroke of lightning every 1d4 rounds. The whips must

join hands to launch the bolt but need merely be within

30 feet of one another while it builds. The lightning bolt

deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per whip; a

successful Reflex save (DC 13 + number of whips) halves

the damage.

Skills Kuo-toas have a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist

checks and a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks.

A kuo-toa has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action when

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

kuo-toas are among the few races that the drow do not openly

try to enslave. Despite this cautious peace, animosity does lurk

below the surface between the two races, fueling a low-grade

cold  war  that  has  gone  on  for  centuries.  Each  side  quietly

attempts to undermine the others power, and both lay claim

to ancient Underdark sites. Lone drow or kuo-toas had best

beware when among those of the other race, especially if their

disappearance is unlikely to be noticed.

Environment:  Kuo-toas  prefer  watery  environments,

although  they  can  breathe  air  and  water  with  equal  ease.

They  hate  bright  light,  so  their  settlements  are  at  the  bot-

toms  of  oceans  or  deep  within  the  Underdark.  They  are

cold-blooded, like the  sh they resemble, so they prefer tem-

perate climates.

Rumors persist of tribes of kuo-toas that have in ltrated

humanoid communities by cross-breeding. These offspring

resemble  their  humanoid  forebears  and  blend  into  surface

societies until they reach maturity, when they join the kuo-

toas in the depths.

Typical  Physical  Characteristics:  Kuo-toas  look  like

bizarre  hybrids  of  humanoids  and   sh.  They  have  pallid,

luminous eyes that bulge out at the sides of their heads, giving

them exceptional peripheral vision. A mucous slime keeps

them moist and also makes them extremely slippery, and they

stink of rotting  sh.

Kuo-toas spawn like  sh, rearing their young in commu-

nal pools for the  rst year of life, until the  ngerlings can

breathe air.

A typical kuo-toa stands about 5 feet tall and weighs about

160 pounds. Its normal color is a silvery green, but it  ushes

deep red when angry and becomes very pale when surprised

or frightened.

Alignment: Cold and cruel, kuo-toas would tend toward

lawful  evil  alignment  were  it  not  for  the  taint  of  madness

that infects the race. Like drow, the tension between their

regimented society and individual ferocity leads them to be

usually neutral evil.

SOCIETY

The worship of the Sea Mother permeates kuo-toa society,

and every community has at least one great temple to Blib-

doolpoolp. The high priests of the Sea Mother wield absolute

authority. Just below them are the dreaded whips, who enforce

the will of the priest-nobility. They administer the temples

and  shrines  and  watch  over  pilgrims.  The  whips  are  also

the planners of the race, managing long-term relationships

with  the  drow,  concocting  plots  against  surface  dwellers,

and questing after long-lost, forbidden secrets of the light-

less  depths.  Their  in uence  prevents  all-out  war  with  the

dark elves, fostering the strained alliance for the whips own

sinister purposes.

War is only one strategy of the calculating kuo-toas. After

many centuries of decline, they have learned the lessons of

attrition  and  the  dangers  posed  by  the  more  fecund  races.

Thus,  whips  prefer  to  defend  their  communities  through

stealth,  misdirection,  isolation,  and  secrecy.  Many  kuo-toa

settlements try to exist beyond the knowledge of the races

living  around  them.  However,  when  battle  is  forced  upon

themwhether to further the agenda of the Sea Mother or

defend the holy places from interloperskuo-toas  ght with

a cold-blooded savagery.

monitor for 1 round. In addition, he takes a

The monitors are the police of kuo-toa society. They combat

the destabilizing in uence of the races streak of insanity and

enforce the social mores and practices of their ancient culture.

These  disciplined  kuo-toas  are  generally  not  susceptible  to

the embrace of madness. Their training techniques are not

always successful, though, and some of the most dangerous

kuo-toas  are  monitors  who  have  succumbed  to  insanity  or

teeter at its brink.

A primary duty of monitors is to locate and neutralize kuo-

toas who have gone mad and to do so as quickly as possible.

When they spot a kuo-toa who appears to have gone insane,

they do not pause to ask questions to be sure. A monitor

quickly overtakes a  eeing quarry and then attempts

to paralyze the target by raining blows down on it.

He then performs a coup de grace against the help-

for fear that they might further taint the tribe.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Strategy and Tactics

Kuo-toas have standard treasure for NPCs of their Challenge

Rating. Whips are armed with their signature pincer staffs, usu-

ally magic, and carry potions and other magic items to enhance

their command ability. Monitors favor magic items to protect

them in combat, since they usually lead the assault. A temple

to the Sea Mother is lavishly decorated with pearls and other

gems, as well as with spoils taken from defeated enemies.

KUO-TOA AS CHARACTERS

See MM 164165 for more information on kuo-toa society and

characters, and Underdark 16 for a list of racial traits.

LIZARD, GIANT

Even with the use of the Vermin Trainer feat (see page 53), spiders

are challenging to train. In addition, some clerics of Lolth forbid

using spiders for any purpose other than participating in their

rituals. For these reasons, drow cultivate new breeds of hardy,

Underdark-dwelling lizards to act as mounts and dray animals.

Other giant lizards are formidable hazards of the depths.

FOOTPAD LIZARD

This massive lizard has a scaly blue hide. Its wedge-shaped head is

 lled with teeth as long as daggers. Instead of claws, the lizards feet

end in suckerlike disks.

A footpad lizard is a breed of subterranean reptile sometimes

used as a pack animal by the drow.

A footpad lizard has the intelligence of an animal and  ghts

as such. It initiates combat only if hungry or threatened.

When it does attack, it stretches out its snakelike neck to

bite its foes. Once it catches a creature between its teeth, it

clamps down hard and doesnt let go until the meal stops

wiggling.

QUICKSILVER LIZARD

This big, silvery lizard stands on two hind powerful hind legs, bal-

anced by a short tail. It has a pair of small forearms that end in sharp

claws. A diamond-shaped head  lled with sharp teeth perches atop

a long, slender neck.

Quicksilver lizards are valued for their tremendous bursts of

speed and their willingness to bear riders. Drow scouts use

these mounts to make lightning-quick raids.

Strategy and Tactics

In the wild, quicksilver lizards hunt in packs. They employ

hit-and-run tactics, weakening prey until they can safely bring

it down. But they are also skittish and  ee if faced with any

serious threat.

As a mount, a quicksilver lizard serves primarily to get its

rider safely into and out of combat. Drow scouts use Ride-By

Attack or Mounted Archery to exploit the beasts speed, and

the lizards sometimes add their own bites in melee.

2/22/07   3:30:13 PM

SUBTERRANEAN LIZARD

The hide of this massive lizard is covered in white scales. Its head

is  thick  and   lled  with  powerful  teeth.  It  scrabbles  forward  with

a speed that belies its bulky appearance, its long tail swishing back

and forth in agitation.

The dreaded subterranean lizard is a dangerous predator that

lurks in the deep places of the Underdark. With its surprising

speed and its long, sticky tongue, it is a formidable opponent.

Strategy and Tactics

Though no more intelligent than an animal, a subterranean

lizard is vicious. It prefers to lurk in areas of rubble, waiting

for likely prey. The lizard begins by launching its tongue at a

single opponent up to 20 feet away, then reels in the captured

creature to deliver a powerful bite. Since it heals so quickly,

a subterranean lizard does not recognize pain and typically

 ghts to the death.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

The giant lizards described here are but a few of the many simi-

lar creatures that lurk in the dim caverns of the Underdark.

What sets these apart is the fact that the drow and some other

civilized races domesticate them. In particular, the footpad

lizard serves as a heavy cavalry mount, and rangers ride quick-

silver lizards to scout enemy territory. The subterranean lizard

is the most rarely domesticated, owing to its ferocious nature,

but is a useful guardian or mount when properly trained.

Battle Beast (EL 910): Subterranean lizards are solitary

creatures and resist training. When broken, they sometimes

serve drow priestesses (see page 167) or house captains (see

page 170) as steeds.

Scout Patrol (EL 68): A scout patrol consists of three to

six drow warriors (see page 169) each mounted on quicksilver

lizards. The scouts monitor the outermost caverns under drow

control and, when they encounter intruders, speed back to

raise the alarm and bring reinforcements.

Heavy Cavalry (EL 1113): Heavy cavalry consists of some

of the drows best-trained male warriors. A typical team of

heavy cavalry consists of three to  ve drow arcane guards (see

page 184) mounted on footpad lizards.

ECOLOGY

When  not  domesticated  by  drow,  footpad  and  quicksilver

lizards rarely remain in one place for long, settling only to lay

eggs in well-concealed hollows. After depositing her eggs, the

mother leaves her young to fend for themselves and resumes

wandering the endless tunnels. Quicksilver lizards are social

creatures that gather in packs in the wild, whereas footpads

are more solitary.

A subterranean lizard, however, is a loner that establishes its

territory and doesnt venture far from it. These lizards prefer

the shores of underground lakes, since water is rare and such

locations are bound to attract prey.

Regeneration (Ex) Acid and fire deal normal damage to a

subterranean lizard. If a subterranean lizard loses a limb

or body part, the lost portion regrows in 10 minutes. If a

severed limb is held to the stump, the limb reattaches

instantly.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a subterranean lizard

must hit an opponent of up to one size larger with its

tongue attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold, drags the

target to an adjacent space, and automatically deals bite

damage.

Tongue (Ex) As a full-round action, a subterranean lizard can

extend its long, sticky tongue to make a melee touch

attack.

Skills Subterranean lizards have a +4 racial bonus on

Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. They also have

a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose

to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

In rocky areas, a subterranean lizards Hide bonus

improves to +8.

All giant lizards are carnivores and eat just about anything

that moves, from goblins to quaggoths to even drow. Most make

do with cave-dwelling spiders and other vermin, a fact drow

priestesses dislike but tolerate because of the creatures useful-

ness. So long as a giant lizard has a steady food supply and no

signi cant competition, it can live as long as 300 years.

Environment: The giant lizards described here live exclu-

sively underground. They hunt near water sources and other

places  where  game  is  abundant.  As  cold-blooded  creatures,

they prefer warmer climes, so they are more active in areas

with geothermal vents.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A footpad lizard mea-

sures about 14 feet long. A subterranean lizard is slightly longer,

at 16 feet. Both can weigh as much as half a ton.

A quicksilver lizard stands about 10 feet tall and weighs

around 500 pounds.

Typical Treasure

Giant lizards do not keep treasure, although a drow accompa-

nying a mount or beast of burden might do so.

The  lair  of  a  subterranean  lizard  might  contain  items

dropped by the creatures it devours, but such wealth is meager

and buried under the mounds of its leavings. A subterranean

lizard has 1/10 standard treasure for its Challenge Rating.

For Player Characters

Footpad and quicksilver lizards are both relatively easy to train

as mounts. The ferocity and solitary nature of subterranean

lizards make them trickier to domesticate: Handle Animal

and Ride checks both increase by 5.

Both footpad and quicksilver lizards make suitable animal

companions. Druids of 4th level or higher can select a quick-

silver lizard. Druids of 7th level or higher can select a footpad

lizard.

Giant Lizards in Eberron

Eberrons lizard trainers are dwarves, rather than drow. They

use giant lizards extensively in their underground cities. Of

those described here, dwarves most often employ footpad liz-

ards as mounts while they search new lodes of iron, mithral,

and adamantine. These skilled climbers are best able to nego-

tiate treacherous terrain.

QUAGGOTH

Quaggoths are a race of subterranean monstrous humanoids

that combine the features of humans and albino cave bears.

(Indeed, they are often referred to as deep bears.) Primitive

and simple, they are forced into slavery by other Underdark

racesespecially the drow.

Covered in shaggy white fur, this muscular humanoid has the head

something like that of a bear. It looses a snarl and leaps forward,

lashing out with its claws.

Quaggoths might lack re nement and culture, but they are

cunning and dangerous foes, both brutal and fearless.

Strategy and Tactics

Quaggoths often use simple ambush tactics. A lone quaggoth

goads  and  lures  enemies  toward  where  others  lie  in  wait.

Once they engage their enemy, they  ght in a fury, with no

consideration  for  risk  or  injury  to  themselves.  Their  battle

rage drives them to audacious acts that sane warriors would

consider suicidal.

GREATER QUAGGOTH

This humanoid-shaped creature is covered in matted black fur, though

the  white  roots  tell  you  its  dyed.  Gripping  its  knobby  warclub,  it

charges with a roar.

A greater quaggoth is an elite combatant with even greater

strength and combat prowess than his lesser fellows have.

The greater quaggoth presented here had the following abil-

ity scores before racial adjustments and equipment bonuses:

Str 12, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 14, Wis 13, Cha 8.

Strategy and Tactics

Unlike their common counterparts, greater quaggoths place

a much higher importance on survival. They are smarter than

their kin, too, and therefore more dangerous. Still, they  y

into  a  rage  easily.  Greater  quaggoths  wield  weapons,  albeit

crude, primitive ones. When engaged, they maximize Power

QUAGGOTH WAR LEADER

This  heavyset  humanoid  has  shaggy  fur  dyed  in  black  and  red

stripes.  It  hefts  a  greataxe  from  which  hang  a  number  of  white-

haired scalps.

A quaggoth war leader is a clan chief, if not the supreme leader

of a quaggoth gathering. He commands groups of common

and  greater  quaggoths  in  raids  against  drow,  mind   ayers,

and duergar.

The quaggoth war leader presented here had the following

136

95726720_Ch05.indd   136

2/22/07   3:30:18 PM

Strategy and Tactics

A quaggoth war leader is never encountered without a cadre

of warriors. Having emerged from the ranks of the greater

quaggoths,  he  uses  weapons  to  great  effect  in  combat.  He

leads from the front, raging and charging into the thickest

knot  of  opponents  to  chop  them  up  with  his  greataxe.  He

uses  Power  Attack  as  much  as  possible,  though  hes  smart

enough to adjust his tactics against tougher adversaries. Like

other greater quaggoths, though, a war leader is quick to  ee

if the battle sours.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Quaggoths  have  a  healthy  respect  for  the  dangers  of  the

Underdark and so rarely venture forth alone, instead forming

hunting bands. In times of war, they assemble into warbands,

launching campaigns of carnage and destruction.

Hunting Band (EL 810): A hunting band includes three

to  ve quaggoths along with one or two greater quaggoths.

EL 9: This band of  ve quaggoths and one greater quaggoth

have laid a trap for drow or other travelers. One takes position

in the middle of a tunnel and, when it spots enemies, makes a

commotion to attract their attention. It then retreats to where

the rest of the band have hidden themselves.

Warband  (EL  1213):  A  warband  consists  of  one  war

leader,  six  to  twelve  quaggoths,  and  two  to  four  greater

quaggoths.

EL 12: After a devastating attack by a team of drow slavers,

the remaining quaggoths and greater quaggoths gather under

a war leader to destroy their hated foes or die trying.

ECOLOGY

Quaggoths are unknown outside the Underdark. Born and

raised  in  these  lightless  tunnels,  most  quaggoths  cannot

comprehend a world without a ceiling overhead. They are well

adapted to this harsh environment, being equipped with keen

senses and a natural resilience to toxins.

Though omnivores, quaggoths prefer meat, especially that

of  sentient  beings.  They  readily  devour  humans,  gnomes,

goblinoids, and just about anything else that walks, creeps,

or crawls into their domain. The only exception is dwarves,

which quaggoths eat only if theyre starving, so foul do they

 nd the meat. They have acquired a special taste for the  esh

of drow, perhaps because of the brutal treatment they receive

at the hands of dark elf slavers.

Environment: Quaggoths can be found anywhere under-

ground, but they prefer the deeper places over those near the

surface. A quaggoth community is  lthy, fouled by droppings,

piles of bones, rotting meat, and rubbish heaped against the

walls. Quaggoth lairs are rife with disease, and many clans

are weakened by outbreaks of  lth fever.

though they tend to obesity. Regardless of gender, every quag-

goth has thick white fur over a densely muscular body.

Alignment: Quaggoths are always neutral evil. They are

self-interested beings, with little understanding of or concern

for  the  consequences  of  their  actions,  motivated  purely  to

ful ll their every desire.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Quaggoths do not collect treasure, seeing little use for such

things as gold and gems. Those who follow the beast destroy

weapons and armor stripped from their victims, or at least

bury such things in dungheaps to prevent their bringing bad

luck or raising the ire of the gods.

Those who follow magic are not so cavalier about destroying

or discarding equipment. Such a quaggoth has standard trea-

sure for its Challenge Rating, always in the form of combat gear

such as weapons, minor magic items, and, rarely, armor. Even

such advanced quaggoths see no value in gems or coins.

QUAGGOTHS WITH CLASS LEVELS

Quaggoths favored class is barbarian, re ecting their short

tempers and violent nature. Only the most wise become spirit

shamansCD, and those that do are solitary, left alone to com-

mune with the spirits and the gods that created their race.

Quaggoth clerics are extremely rare and worship a primi-

tive aspect of Nerull. The god of deaths trickery aspect  ts in

well with the quaggoths battle tactics.

Level Adjustment: +2.

QUAGGOTHS IN EBERRON

The  quaggoths  are  a  subject  race  of  the  daelkyr,  who  use

them principally for collecting Khyber dragonshards. Quag-

goths  brave  some  of  the  most  dangerous  places  in  Khyber,

contending  with  aberrations,  undead,  and  worse  as  they

struggle  to  please  their  masters.  Rumors  of  free  quaggoths

in distant subterranean reaches sometimes  nd their way to

slave encampments, but the daelkyr swiftly stamp out such

pernicious talk to ensure their domination.

QUAGGOTHS IN FAERN

The drow long ago enslaved the quaggoths to serve as guards,

spider handlers, and thrall-soldiers. Mind  ayers also employ

quaggoth minions, valuing them mainly for their strength

and service as warriors. Nevertheless, the Underdark holds

many enclaves of free quaggoths. Those who live in the north

beneath  the  Trollmoors  have  become  organized,  forming

alliances with the orcs to destroy the drow slavers. Whispers

circulate that the quaggoths have even begun to breed with the

proli c orcs, producing a new brutish hybrid race of extreme

strength and viciousness.

SOCIETY

Though numerous quaggoths inhabit the Underdark, many

serve the drow as slaves. These poor souls suffer terribly under

pitiless overseers who work them to death or expend them in

large numbers for the interminable contests between houses.

Others languish in captivity to mind  ayers, who treat them

no more kindly. Such abuse breaks quaggoths minds, turn-

ing  them  into  shuddering  hulks  or  ravenous,  unthinking

beasts.

Those that manage to avoid the slavers form clans that can

include up to  fty members. On rare occasions, several clans

might meet in a massive cavern to hold a gathering. Such con-

vocations occur after a series of damaging attacks on quaggoth

holdings or if some other danger threatens them as a whole.

Among these savages are two general outlooks. Most quag-

goths abide by the old customs and follow the beast. They

are extremely violent and reckless, seeing no point in using

weaponry or making any advances to their society. They live

up to the deep bear moniker, being virtually indistinguish-

able in nature and outlook from wild animals.

The  other  quaggoths  follow  magic.  This  expression  is

something of a misnomer, since spellcasting among the quag-

goths is extremely rare. Instead, these individuals improve

upon  their  innate  strengths,  which  they  see  as  a  gift  from

their gods (though still primitive and elemental). They revel

in  the  power  of  the  weapons  they  wield,  treating  them  as

mystical relics, and seek out magic items of all kinds. They

mark their choice by dying their white fur with dung, blood,

and black ichor harvested from mind  ayers gall. Those who

follow magic are the prominent members of their clans. They

are generally more intelligent, usually becoming war leaders,

and dont throw their lives away recklessly. Thus, they might

one  day  outnumber  the  primitives,  much  as  humanity  left

behind the Neanderthals. Such a development would mean

great upheaval in the Underdark.

SHUNNED

What looks like a swollen tumor bristling with a score of spider legs

pulls itself forward with alarming speed. The front of the thing has

the face of a pale elf twisted in terrible pain.

The  hideous  shunned  are  the  accursed  of  Lolth.  Created

from  servants  who  have  failed  the  Spider  Queen,  they  are

condemned to a fate of eternal agony.

STRATEGY AND TACTICS

A shunned hates all creatures and seeks to make them suffer as

much as or more than it does. It lures creatures to battle elds

of its choosing with dancing lights, and uses darkness to best take

advantage of its environment. As its prey draws near, a shunned

vomits forth swarms of spiders; once the battle begins, it lurks

in the shadows while its minions contend with the enemy. The

shunned readies an action to cast dispel magic to counter any

signi cant magic attacks its foes might cast. Once the oppo-

nents have focused their efforts against the spider swarms, the

shunned creeps forward, using suggestion to drive off tougher

prey before it closes to deliver its venomous bite.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

So  foul  are  these  creatures  that  others  cannot  abide  their

presence, not even other shunned. These aberrations are

always encountered alone.

Individual (EL 7): A shunned lives a solitary exis-

tence on the fringes of its former society. It has come

to terms with its new form but blames the drow for its

wretched state. This shunned has managed to in ltrate a

fungus forest where it murders slaves, overseers, and anyone

else who comes too close.

ECOLOGY

The shunned are aptly named: Having so displeased the Spider

Queen, they are rejected by their former people. They are not

permitted within drow cities and are cast out to  nd their own

way in the Underdark. Consigned to a lonely life, the shunned

SHUNNED LORE

Characters  who  have  ranks  in  Knowledge  (dungeoneering)

character makes a successful skill check, the following lore is

revealed, including the information from lower DCs.

This creature is one of the shunneddrow who have

been terribly cursed by Lolth. This result reveals all

aberration traits.

22  Although rejected by the drow, shunned retain many

of the traits of their former form, including the elfs

keen senses and the ability to work magic innately.

27  All shunned are infested with spiders. They can spew

swarms of the tiny arachnids and bend them to their

will.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

140

A shunned

pine for what they have lost, trapped in a hideous form and ever

aware of their goddesss wrath. No creature will ever accept

themmost  ee before their horri c visages.

All shunned cling to the faint hope of being restored and

would do anything, kill anyone, to regain Lolths favor. Few,

if any, ever succeed at this goal. For most, it is but a matter of

time before some other creature destroys them, ending their

pitiful existence.

Though despised by the drow, shunned rarely venture too

far from their former homes. A shunned establishes itself in a

small, out-of-the-way cavern or tunnel, surviving on goblins,

quaggoths, and the occasional drow.

These wretched creatures are relatively free of antagonists.

Animals and vermin do not prey on them, for their meat has

a sense of wrongness about it. The drow defend themselves

against attacks by the shunned but do not actively hunt them,

believing that they should not interfere with Lolths punish-

ments. Shunned must be wary of svirfneblin and duergar, who

destroy them on sight.

Environment: The shunned are found only underground,

and never more than a few miles of a drow settlement. Once a

shunned settles on a home, it decorates the lair in a mockery

of a typical drow dwelling, with rubbish and other cast-off

materials found when hunting.

Magic Strike A shunneds natural weapons are treated as

Disgorge Spiders (Su) As a full-round action that provokes

attacks of opportunity, a shunned can spew a spider

swarm (MM 239) into an adjacent square. Once it has

disgorged spiders, the shunned must wait 1d4 rounds

before using this ability. The shunned controls all such

swarms completely and can instruct each swarm to

attack a particular target. It can redirect a swarm as a

move action.

Wail (Su) Once per round as a standard action, a shunned

can loose a horrid wail. All creatures within 30 feet must

succeed on DC 16 Will saves or become sickened for

1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills A shunned has a +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and

Spot checks.

It also has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can

always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed

or threatened.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A shunned measures

about 6 feet long and weighs just over 200 pounds. Most of its

body is a bulbous sac of pale  esh covered in throbbing black

veins. Foul excretions collect in its folds, emitting a sour stink.

The head of a female drow with translucent skin perches on

the end of its bulky form, and close inspection reveals numer-

ous tiny spiders wriggling just below the surface of the pallid

 esh. Randomly piercing its disgusting body are numerous

glossy spider legs covered in thorns.

Shunned  are  exclusively  female  and  lack  the  ability  to

reproduce.

Alignment:  Shunned  are  always  chaotic  evil.  Many  do

not begin with this alignment, but after a few weeks in their

new form, their minds give way to madness and desperation,

pushing them to random acts of terrifying violence.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Shunned do not typically hoard treasure and do not use magic

items. They are, however, keenly interested in drow goods,

such as furniture, carvings, and even clothing. They decorate

their homes with debris collected from drow cities. Examining

the contents of a shunned lair reveals various items of worth,

amounting to standard treasure for the creatures Challenge

Rating, but no coins.

SHUNNED IN EBERRON

The shunned are native to Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams.

Born from old nightmares experienced by those who suffered

the quori invasion, they exist in a state of eternal torment. They

regard mortals as the cause of their plight and take any chance

to slip onto the Material Plane to get revenge.

SHUNNED IN FAERN

The clerics of Kiaransalee hold up the shunned as examples of

Lolths corruption, seducing these vile creatures with promises

of restoration. Seeing hope in the Revenancers clerics, many

shunned aided them in the War of the Spider Queen. But no

succor was to be had from those who served the White Ban-

shee; most of the shunned were wiped out in Kiaransalees mad

campaign to purge the Underdark of Lolths in uence.

SPIDER, MONSTROUS

Aside from the more common varieties of hunting and web-

spinning monstrous spiders, the drow breed and train several

new strains of spider found exclusively in the Underdark.

SPITTING SPIDER

This enormous spider stands on eight spindly legs and has a surpris-

ingly small body for its size. Its fangs drip a pale yellow  uid as it

lunges forward to attack.

A spitting spider is noted for its speed and its ability to project

venom into the faces of its foes.

Strategy and Tactics

A spitting spider is aggressive when hunting. It spits a stream

of poison at its closest target and then pounces on the following

round, biting its prey. It pounds a poisoned creature with its

front legs to further weaken it before the toxin takes effect.

Drow sometimes use spitting spiders as mounts. Since these

spiders are easier to train than other vermin, as well as being

ferocious in combat, they are in high demand. In combat, a

spitting spider coordinates its attacks with its rider.

attack.

Spit Poison (Ex) A spitting spider can spit its venom up to 30

feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack

with no range increment.

Steed (Ex) Spitting spiders take instruction well and are easy

to train. Treat a spitting spider as a magical beast with

Intelligence 3 for the purpose of Handle Animal checks.

Skills Spitting spiders have a +8 racial bonus on Climb,

Move Silently, and Spot checks, and a +10 racial bonus

on Jump checks. A spitting spider can always choose to

take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

TANGLE TERROR

In the center of a strangely glistening web is a big spider, about the

size of a dog. Its body is dark green slashed with black stripes. As you

watch, it draws a strand of wet webbing from its spinnerets.

Tangle terrors use poisonous webs to ensnare and confound

their prey.

Strategy and Tactics

A  tangle  terror  is  usually  content  to  wait  for  creatures  to

become entangled in its webbing, since the webs poison make

a victim more pliant and easier to overcome and drain. Once

prey  has  been  trapped,  the  tangle  terror  creeps  forward  to

either  nish off its victim or poison it and wrap it in a cocoon

of webbing for later consumption.

WIDOWMAKER

Though massive, this spiders black body is sleek and built for battle,

standing on eight delicate legs. It has a bulbous abdomen sporting a

large red discoloration that resembles an hourglass.

A widowmaker is a deadly hunter in its own right, and it is

the favored steed of drow priestesses.

natural and magical webs.

Maddening Webs (Ex) Webbing created by a tangle terror

drips with a powerful psychotropic toxin. Creatures struck

by a tangle terrors web attack or entangled in its sheet

webs must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or become

confused for 12 rounds as they experience strange

hallucinations that leave them befuddled. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Web (Ex) A tangle terror can throw a web up to eight times

per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a

maximum range of 100 feet, with a range increment of 20

feet, and is effective against targets up to two size

categories larger than the spider. The web anchors the

target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful

DC 22 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a

successful DC 22 Strength check. The check DCs are

Strength-based and include a +4 racial bonus. The web

has 12 hit points and hardness 0, and takes double

damage from fire.

A tangle terror can create sheets of sticky webbing up

to 20 feet square. It usually positions these sheets to trap

flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the

ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20

Spot check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it

and become trapped as though by a successful web

attack (including the maddening webs effect). Each

5-foot section of webbing has 12 hit points and damage

reduction 5/.

A tangle terror can move across its own sheet web at

its climb speed and can determine the exact location of

any creature touching the web.

Skills Tangle terrors have a +8 racial bonus on Climb, Hide,

and Move Silently checks. A tangle terror can always

choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or

threatened.

Spitting spider (top), widowmaker (left), tangle terror (right)

Strategy and Tactics

A widowmaker is a voracious predator that feeds on all living

creatures,  even  its  own  kind.  When  on  the  hunt,  it  creeps

about, moving slowly and under cover of darkness. When it

spots prey, it charges. A creature that survives this powerful

initial attack still has to deal with the devastating effects of

the spiders poison.

Blood Drain (Ex) A widowmaker can suck blood from a living

victim by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the

foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution

damage each round the pin is maintained. This ability

does not affect elementals, plants, or creatures that lack

a Constitution score.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, a widowmaker must

hit an opponent of any size with a bite attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple, it

establishes a hold and can pin the opponent. It can use

its blood drain ability against a pinned creature.

Steed (Ex) Widowmakers take instruction well and are easy

to train. Treat a widowmaker as a magical beast with

Intelligence 3 for the purpose of Handle Animal checks.

Skills Widowmakers have a +8 racial bonus on Climb, Move

Silently, and Spot checks, and a +10 bonus on Jump

checks. A widowmaker can always choose to take 10 on

Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

95726720_Ch05.indd   143

2/22/07   3:30:34 PM

Despite  their  ferocity,  widowmakers  are  easily  trained,

even though they are vermin. Clerics of Lolth regard these

creatures as the truest expressions of the Spider Queen and

prefer them as mounts.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Monstrous spiders are usually solitary hunters, although they

occasionally serve the drow as steeds or guardians.

Individual (EL 510): All the monstrous spiders described

in this chapter are usually encountered when they are hunting

or lurking in their webs.

EL 5: A spitting spider searches through the rubble of an

abandoned gnome enclave. Bodies wrapped in spider silk lie

nestled in the ruins.

EL  8: A  tangle  terror  sits  in  the  center  of  a  massive  web

bisecting  a  huge  crevasse  that  once  served  as  a  swift  route

through  the  mountains.  Traf c  is  much  thinner  now,  and

the spider is quite hungry. It is unlikely to wait for prey to

stumble into its web.

EL 10: A widowmaker has made its lair in a temple in a small

drow settlement. It has been trained not to attack anyone wear-

ing the vestments of Lolths clergy, but it kills anyone else who

comes nearnoticeably depleting the local population.

Spider Sentinel (EL 1012): Drow spider sentinels (see

page 172)  patrol  singly  or  in  pairs.  Occasionally  they  are

mounted  on  spitting  spiders,  particularly  if  they  wish  to

take prisoners.

ECOLOGY

Monstrous spiders come in two varieties: hunters and web-

spinners. Both the spitting spider and the widowmaker are

hunting spiders, and so they do not rely on webs to catch prey.

Instead, they prowl their territory in search of fresh meat. A

tangle terror lurks in its web, lying in wait until some hap-

less creature stumbles into its trap, at which point, it gingerly

descends to paralyze the prey with its bite. Its big advantage

over other web-spinners is its poisonous web, which causes

strange and confusing hallucinations that make prey easier

pqqqqqqqqqrs

POWERFUL CHARGE

The Powerful Charge feat appears in Monster Manual IV and

is reprinted here for convenience.

POWERFUL CHARGE

A creature with this feat can charge with extra force.

Prerequisite: Medium or larger, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: When the creature charges, if its melee attack hits,

it deals an extra 1d8 points of damage (if it is Medium size).

For Large creatures, the extra damage is 2d6 points; for Huge,

3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for Colossal, 6d6.

This feat works only when the creature makes a charge. It

does not work when the creature is mounted. If the creature

has the ability to make multiple attacks after a charge, it can

apply this extra damage to only one of those attacks.

Special: A fighter can select Powerful Charge as one of his

fighter bonus feats.

pqqqqqqqqqrs

to deal with. Tangle terrors dont consume the heads of their

prey and leave them scattered throughout their lairs, leading

to a popular belief that they take trophies.

Generally, these spiders are loners, since food is scarce in the

Underdark. They congregate only for mating. Tangle terrors

and spitting spiders make no lasting nests but simply leave egg

clusters in protected areas; a male tangle terror often returns

to  eat  its  young.  A  female  widowmaker  takes  no  chances,

devouring the male after mating.

Monstrous  spiders  are  often  found  in  the  service  of  the

drow,  who  see  the  creatures  much  as  surface  dwellers  see

horses:  servants,  beasts  of  burden,  and  occasional  compan-

ions. Others believe them to be divinely favored, symbols of

Lolths majesty.

Environment: All three of these monstrous spiders live

exclusively  underground.  They  prefer  damp  places  with

plenty of prey to hunt or ensnare. Domesticated individuals

are stabled in drow settlements or inhabit special areas in or

near temples to Lolth.

This creature is a spitting spider, a particularly

deadly breed of hunting spider that occasionally

serves the drow as a mount. This result reveals all

vermin traits.

20  A spitting spider can deliver its paralytic poison by

bite or by spitting it up to 30 feet.

25  Though it favors softening its foes up first, a spitting

spider can pounce on its enemies, delivering a rapid

barrage of attacks.

Tangle Terror

18

This creature is a tangle terror, a breed of web-

spinning spider. This result reveals all vermin traits.

23  Beware the tangle spiders webs; theyre just as

poisonous as its bite. Though its bite weakens prey,

the venom of its webs leaves them disoriented and

helpless.

28  A tangle spider cannot be hampered by webs of any

kind, not even magical ones.

Widowmaker

20  This creature is a widowmaker, a vicious hunting

spider sometimes used as a steed by the drow. This

result reveals all vermin traits.

25  A widowmaker can make an overpowering charge

attack to drive its venomous fangs deep into its

preys body.

30  Once it bites, a widowmaker hangs on and drinks its

victims blood.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A spitting spider is about

16 feet across but has a relatively small body, no more than 5 feet

in diameter. Spitting spiders weigh about 500 pounds.

A tangle terror is much more compact, being about 6 feet in

diameter and weighing 300 pounds. Neither of these spiders

has discernible physical differences between genders.

Measuring 15 feet across and weighing more than 2,000

pounds,  a  female  widowmaker  carries  much  of  its  bulk  in

its  abdomen.  Males,  though  still  Large,  are  about  half  the

females  size  and  weight,  being  8  feet  across  and  weighing

just over half a ton.

TROLL

Trolls are the great brutes of the Underdark. Natural preda-

tors, dif cult to kill, and typically of low intelligence, they

are  an  excellent  source  of  slave  labor  and  shock  troops  for

the drow.

FILTH-EATER

A thin, green-skinned creature, at least 9 feet tall,  ails at you with

elongated  arms  tipped  with   lth-encrusted  claws.  It  bares  yellow

fangs in a snarl, and a blast of foul air buffets you.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Though monstrous spiders do not keep treasure, their lairs

sometimes contain coins, gems, and other items from previ-

ous victims. Typically, the value of these items is 1/5 standard

treasure for the spiders Challenge Rating.

FOR PLAYER CHARACTERS

Characters with the Spider Companion feat (see page 52) can

use some monstrous spiders as animal companions. Druids

of 7th level or higher can select a spitting spider instead of a

brown bear. Druids of 13th level or higher can select a tangle

terror instead of a dire bear.

Because they can be trained fairly easily, even by characters

without the Vermin Trainer feat, spitting spiders and widow-

makers make good mounts.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for  a  spitting  spider  is

up to 520 pounds, a medium load, 5211,040 pounds, and a

heavy load, 1,0411,560 pounds. A spitting spider can drag

7,800 pounds.

A  light  load  for  a  widowmaker  is  up  to  400  pounds,  a

medium load, 401800 pounds, and a heavy load, 8011,200

pounds. A widowmaker can drag 6,000 pounds.

MONSTROUS SPIDERS IN EBERRON

All three varieties of monstrous spiders are found in the cav-

erns of Khyber that lie beneath Xendrik, though specimens

of these strains can be found throughout the subterranean

realm. Eberrons drow have no special relationship with spi-

ders, so they do not use these creatures as steeds or guardians

(monstrous scorpions  ll a similar role).

Most of these vermin cause few problems and are easily con-

tained. However, of late, tangle terrors have begun slipping from

their caves and are  nding new homes in the cliffs and canyons

so common on Xendrik. This migration has become a problem

for the continents small population of raptorans (Races of the

Wild), who are losing several hatchlings to these predators.

MONSTROUS SPIDERS IN FAERN

Up until recently, monstrous spiders were an important com-

ponent of Lolths worship. But with the Spider Queens silence

(see page 107), clerics of her enemies have mounted raids of

reprisal.  During  the  War  of  the  Spider  Queen,  many  drow

cities were purged of their spider populations, with followers

of Kiaransalee even placing bounties on spider legs.

Living in the most squalid of conditions outside drow enclaves,

troll  lth-eaters are vicious carriers of foul disease.

The   lth-eater  presented  here  had  the  following  ability

scores  before  racial  adjustments  and  Hit  Die  ability  score

increases: Str 15, Dex 10, Con 14, Int 8, Wis 12, Cha 13.

Strategy and Tactics

Harsh living conditions and breeding for aggressiveness and

toughness make  lth-eaters into frenzied combatants. When

they detect a potential living meal, they typically attack in a

raging horde, seeking to tear their prey limb from limb. They

seldom retreat unless faced with acid or with  re attacks that

can manage to penetrate their formidable energy resistance.

In battle, they always use Power Attack and attempt to rend

as often as possible.

Though it is not done consciously, this mad-rush style of

attack also spreads  lth fever with maximum effectiveness.

The few beings that survive the claws and teeth of a  lth-eater

gang often end up weakened and sick not long afterward, at

the mercy of the hazards of the Underdark.

TUNNEL THUG

Strategy and Tactics

Cunning intelligence gleams in the deep-set eyes of this greenish giant

as it leaps from cover. Its ungainly, rubbery arms wield a huge sword

with practiced ease.

Some trolls are bred by the drow for intelligence and agility.

Tunnel thugs are not the run-of-the-mill guards and laborers

common to the outskirts of drow communities, but rather,

cunning trackers and assassins.

The  tunnel  thug  presented  here  had  the  following  abil-

ity  scores  before  racial  adjustments,  Hit  Die  ability  score

increases, and equipment bonuses: Str 8, Dex 15, Con 12, Int

14, Wis 13, Cha 10.

Tunnel thugs differ from normal trolls in that direct melee

is  not  their  preferred  mode  of  combat.  When  they  have

located their quarry, they observe for a while until they have

the opportunity to move in and make death attacks. They

like to quickly and quietly pick off stragglers or rear guards

with sneak attacks and poison, seeking high positions on

cavern walls using their spider kits. Often the only warning

of attack is a poisoned crossbow bolt streaking out the dark.

Tunnel thugs disable their foes one at a time, favoring the

relatively inexpensive roach paste and saving deathblade for

formidable-looking opponents.

hygiene, so usually troll packs are relegated to caverns or pits

that are adjacent to the entrances to their domains.

The presence of troll  lth-eaters is easy to deduce from the

foul stench of their burrows. They squat in pits and caverns

littered with the remnants of past meals, their own refuse,

and the myriad organisms that thrive in such conditions. As

a result,  lth-eaters have an almost unnatural hardiness to go

along with their regenerative properties. The drow prefer not

to enter the disgusting dens of the  lth-eaters, rather sending

in slaves whenever necessary to feed them. Sometimes the

slaves carry foodstuffs for the trolls, but more often than not

they themselves are the meal.

Some trolls are bred by the drow for intelligence and agility.

When some adversary of the drow escapes their clutches or

retreats from battle, and the dark elves do not wish to pursue

themselves, they call out their tunnel thugs. These trolls are

consummate trackers and hit-and-run assassins. Interlopers

 eeing from the drow often listen for sounds of pursuit or set

traps for pursuers. Against tunnel thugs, such measures are

rarely successful. With their impressive skills, magical gear,

and knowledge of the local Underdark terrain, tunnel thugs

Tunnel thugs usually begin pursuit by tracking by scent,

getting  a  good  idea  of  the  numbers  and  types  of  creatures

they  are  hunting.  Once  they  have  determined  the  quarrys

probable destination, they establish cutoff points to trap their

 eeing prey. They are not particularly adept at locating traps

or ambushes but often avoid them simply by not traveling the

route that their quarry expects. Even when they run into an

ambush,  tunnel  thugs  disconcert  their  would-be  attackers,

who usually have prepared for  ghting drow. The trolls eva-

sion and regeneration abilities help them penetrate any such

defenses with minimal harm.

If they are serving as trackers for a drow warband, tunnel

thugs soften their targets up with crossbow  re from one

direction,  while  the  drow  attack  with  surprise  from  an

unexpected quarter. The trolls then move into  anking posi-

tions in order to make full use of their sneak attacks. Before

entering  melee,  tunnel  thugs  smear  their  falchions  with

poison and try to target a spellcaster or war leader among

their opponents.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Troll  lth-eaters lurk in squalid burrows on the outskirts of

drow communities. They typically hunt in packs, killing and

eating any non-drow that happen by their lairs. Tunnel thugs

operate alone or form organized groups.

Filth-Eater Gang (EL 1315): Packs of two to four  lth-

eaters scavenge for food around their lairs. Any living creature

other than drow is a target for their frenzied attacks. A pack

of  lth-eaters in a battle rage usually provides ample alarm to

nearby drow listening posts.

Retributive  Strike  (EL  1418):  Tunnel  thugs  usually

pursue intruders singly or in small squads, though sometimes

they guide drow hunting parties.

EL 14: This solitary tunnel thug is in pursuit of

a  thief  who  managed  to  in ltrate  the  com-

pound of a ranking drow house and steal an

item of value.

EL  17:  Two  tunnel  thugs  lead  a  strike

squad  of  four  Lolths  Stings  (see  page 78)

and two dark snipers (see page 75) under

the command of a house captain (see

page 170).

ECOLOGY

Though trolls can inhabit almost any

environment, terrorizing the nearby

denizens,  those  that  dwell  in  the

Underdark have been the thralls

of the dark elves for countless gen-

erations. Using magic and  re, the

drow have been able to tame these

brutes to some extent, but only the

foolish  or  extraordinarily  power-

ful lower their guard or walk with

impunity among them. Drow dislike

the giants savagery and general lack of

Trolls:  lth-eater, tunnel thug

avoid detection and traps, easily surmount dif cult terrain, and

use tertiary tunnels to head off their quarry. These trolls can

run quickly through tunnels, leaping over debris and obstacles

that might hinder the movement of smaller creatures.

Environment: The trolls that serve the drow inhabit the

middle depths of the Underdark where the dark elves build

their cities. Filth-eaters inhabit burrows and caverns, while the

pens of tunnel thugs are associated with houses or temples.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Filth-eaters are espe-

cially lanky and horrid-looking for their kind, with crooked

fangs and long, jagged claws, encrusted with disgusting matter.

They  are  immune  to  normal  diseases  and  carry  infections

from their lairs on their teeth and claws, which transmit the

illness by successful attacks.

Tunnel thugs wear light armor and carry weapons, provided

by their drow masters. Though as hideous as any troll, they

have an intelligent air and are relatively civilized-looking.

Alignment: Like all trolls, those exploited by the drow are

chaotic evil. Filth-eaters are particularly bestial, but tunnel

thugs exhibit a cruel cunning.

SOCIETY

Filth-eaters are bred for obedience (with stupidity a desirable

side-effect),  and  they  fear  the  wrath  of  the  dark  elves  that

command  them.  Any  such  troll  showing  signs  of  marked

intelligence or leadership capability is culled and destroyed.

In return for their loyal serviceconsisting largely of kill-

ing  and  eating  intrudersthe   lth-eaters  enjoy  a  measure

of protection. The drow provide them with magic rings that

compensate for the trolls natural vulnerability to  re, further

ensuring their continued loyalty.

Nevertheless,  the  drow  do  spare  some  trolls  that  dem-

onstrate  intelligence  and  agility.  When  such  a  promising

specimen is born, it is removed from its parents lair and raised

in the pens of the tunnel thugs. To further augment their skills

and training, the drow give these trolls magic weaponry and

equipment,  making  the  creatures  expensive  to  raise,  train,

and house. As a result, tunnel thugs are usually not numerous

in a drow community, belonging only to the noble houses or

perhaps the church. However, their low numbers are more

than made up for by their deadly effectiveness.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Trolls in the service of the drow do not collect treasure, being

little more than pets. However,  lth-eaters possess the major

rings of  re resistance given them by their masters. A typical troll

tunnel thug has mundane and magical equipment amounting

to standard treasure for its Challenge Rating.

TROLLS AS CHARACTERS

VENOM OOZE

A glistening patch of luminescent yellow slime slides forward, gather-

ing itself to form a sticky pseudopod.

A venom ooze is a protoplasmic creature that excretes deadly

toxins.

STRATEGY AND TACTICS

A venom ooze is mindless but is drawn to disturbances: Any

movement within range of its blindsight triggers its instincts,

causing it to slide toward its prey. When it is within range, the

ooze lashes out with a pseudopod dripping with poisonous

excreta. Once it has struck a foe, it wraps its amorphous body

around that creature and squeezes until it or its prey is dead.

Believed  to  be  offshoots  of

ochre jellies, venom oozes are

particularly dangerous organ-

isms. They are ravenous hunters that scour the tunnels of

their habitat for food. Unlike other oozes, they are not con-

tent to stay in one place, but rather slide across the ground,

relying  on  nonvisual  senses  to  detect  even  the  slightest

movement.  When  a  venom  ooze  detects  prey,  it  pursues

relentlessly.

A venom ooze feeds by absorbing  uids through its skin.

When it attacks, it wraps itself around a creature and tightens,

crushing the prey to release the nourishing juices. Its poison-

ous secretions quickly weaken and suffocate prey.

Venom oozes reproduce by dividing. The more  uids one

ingests, the larger it grows, until it can no longer sustain itself.

The process of division takes several days to conclude. A cleft

appears in the center of the oozes body, gradually widening

as the thrashing halves struggle for independence.

Environment: Venom oozes are most often found in the

Underdark. They lurk near poisonous lakes, toxic gas vents,

and  other  noxious  areas  inhospitable  to  other  life.  Equally

at home in the water as out, they can adapt to just about any

environment,  tough  enough  to  withstand  deep  cold  or  the

deepest places in the earth.

Typical Physical Characteristics: A typical venom ooze

is approximately 12 feet in diameter and weighs about half a

ton. It is a sickly yellow, about the color of bile, which it smells

like as well. Whenever the ooze moves, it leaves a glistening

trail of slime. The poison in its excreta loses potency rapidly,

but it leaves a silvery stain.

Alignment: A mindless hunter, a venom ooze is always

neutral.

TYPICAL TREASURE

Though a venom ooze does not collect treasure, it might leave

behind  a  few  possessions  from  its  previous  victims.  Since

the ooze feeds by crushing its victim, fragile goods (such as

potions) rarely survive. An area inhabited by a venom ooze has

Venom ooze

1/2 standard treasure for its Challenge Rating, consisting of

coins, gems, and nonfragile goods.

VENOM OOZES IN EBERRON

Venom oozes can be found in the fetid waterways and pools

of Xendriks jungles. Such places are said to be holy to the

dark elves, blessed by their foul scorpion god. Among some

tribes, it is a rite of passage to consume waters tainted by the

ooze; those who live through the experience are considered

favored by Vulkoor.

VENOM OOZES IN FAERN

Venom oozes are the product of a deliberate breeding program

led by the now-destroyed House Freth in the infamous drow

city of Menzoberranzan. Subjecting ochre jellies to countless

poison spells, foul transmutation magic, and chemical agents,

these  dark  elves  produced  the   rst  specimen.  Though  the

house was destroyed soon after these experiments, the venom

ooze  survived  and  multiplied,  and  its  progeny  have  spread

throughout the Underdark.

campaign in which all the trees have been

replaced by stalagmites. Creating a campaign

that effectively uses the drowwhether as

direct adversaries or as subtle foils for the player characters

requires some work on your part as the Dungeon Master.

A drow-based campaign has a certain  avor that must be

captured, or the dark elves will be little more than monsters

to be defeated. The PCs should tremble when they encounter

spider swarms in the Underdark or a strange, fungus-shaped

brooch in a giants hoard. This chapter is meant to help you

provide the appropriate feel to your campaign and give you

ideas for integrating drow NPCs as the focus of stand-alone

adventures or as part of a longer campaign.

First,  the  chapter  discusses  the  use  of  dark  elves

in the campaign, from part-time villains to full-time

nemeses. Next, it looks at drow cities, their environs,

the reasons they exist, and the impact they have on

their surroundings. After that, the discussion expands

to include the areas of the Underdark around drow

communitiesthe Borderlands and the Wilds. Next,

you will  nd numerous drow archetypes with full sta-

tistics that are ready to be used in your campaign. The

remainder of the chapter details sample drow encounters,

 fty drow adventure ideas, and magical locations in

the Underdark that pertain to the drow.

DROW CAMPAIGNS

Drow have appeared in many adventures and undoubt-

edly many campaigns throughout the years. From a few

slavers lurking in the cellar of a fortress, to a lone assassin

pursuing a dark agenda, to a noble ranger leaving behind the

cruelty of his heritage, drow can appear just about anywhere

at any time. Presented below are ideas for running campaigns

that include drow characters or that take place in the realms

of the dark elves.

INCORPORATING DROW

INTO A CAMPAIGN

Perhaps you have begun a campaign of dungeon crawls and wil-

derness adventures and now would like to incorporate a drow

element so that you can work toward a climax involving the

dark elves. You will need to do more than simply insert drow

NPCs here and there. Capturing the menace and awe of the

drow requires effort on your part, and it begins with generating

a sense of fear before the  rst drow ever shows its face.

For example, in the Library of Khilbarus, where the PCs

are researching the means to destroy an evil artifact, they

stumble across an adventurers journal that details abandoned

ruins  he  found  in  the  Underdark.  The  journal  describes

glyphs and symbols he discovered there, and it shows images

of a javelin embossed in electrum. The explorer writes that he

took several items that were adorned with that symbol. The

95726720_Ch06.indd   150

2/22/07   3:33:14 PM

 nal entry, written in another hand, states that the original

owner disappeared in the Underdark, but that his journal was

found in a crevice in the rocks near strange ruins. The drow

are never mentioned, and there are no further clues.

Some time later, the adventurers are in the regions capital

city to meet with its ruler about their current mission, and they

notice that one of his advisors wears an electrum ring with a

stylized javelin on it. Unable to learn anything more from the

encounter, they consult a sage who has assisted them in the

past. He says that he will look into the matter and asks them to

return in a day or two. But when the PCs call again, they  nd

that the sage has been murdered and his home ransacked. His

head is missing, preventing communication with his corpse,

but scrawled in his own blood under a desk is the word Tor-

mtor. Once again, there is no direct contact with drow, but

the PCs have now realized that something sinister and deadly

appears to reach to the highest levels of the kingdom.

At this point, divinations might lead a high-level party to the

drow, but preferably the PCs have not advanced so far in their

careers and must rely on more mundane measures. The Gather

Information skill and a few minor divinations lead them to

a gang of street thugs that killed the sage. In the process of

defeating the thugs, the PCs realize that they have weapons and

equipment far beyond that of a typical street gangclearly, the

thugs have af uent patrons. Stranger still, guarding the gangs

small treasure hoard is a trained monstrous spider that obeys

the commands of the leader. If survivors are questioned, the

PCs learn only that the creature was an anonymous gift.

The PCs decide to conduct research on the gang. Perhaps

they  break  an  inmate  out  of  prison  to  question  him,  since

the  government  has  become  strangely  reticent  toward  the

characters,  or  maybe  they  take  down  a  rival  gang  or  a  few

members of the local thieves guild. Regardless, the PCs learn

that the thugs in question work as bodyguards in the citys

soup kitchens and  ophouses, supposedly to maintain secu-

rity and protect the volunteers. The operations are overseen

by the Minister of Alms, who is one of the city leaders chief

advisorsand  the  male  that  the  PCs  saw  wearing  the  odd

ring. The PCs now have evidence to connect the minister to

the thugs who murdered the sage, and they can confront him.

They draw close to the nature of the drow plot but have not

yet uncovered its true masters.

Having  learned  that  adventurers  are  investigating  him,

the Minister of Alms takes a short vacation to his country

villa, hoping that the busybodies will follow so that he can

have them permanently silenced. After heading to the villa,

the PCs  nd more than they bargained forits grounds are

guarded by trained bugbear warriors, and trolls dwell in the

basement.  The  minister  himself  has  several  highly  skilled

goblinoid  bodyguards,  including  one  that  handles  trained

monstrous spiders. If the characters capture or kill the min-

ister, they learn (whether from his confession or by reading

his personal papers) that he receives large sums of money to

supply a local weaver with derelicts, whom he kidnaps from

the  ophouses during the night.

Back in the city, the PCs break into the af uent weavers

manse and discover that it is guarded by more trained gobli-

noids and trolls. In addition, for the  rst time, they encounter

drow warriors that make sniping attacks from key locations in

the house. Defeating these dark elf assailants, the PCs catch

the weaver in the cellar, only to learn that he is an albino drow

provocateur from House Tormtor. He has been wielding his

in uence over city of cials to cover up his slave-taking ring

and to subtly direct the course of the government. Perhaps his

Tormtor masters intend for him to eventually rule the city in

their name. Along with this information, the party discovers

maps that show how the slave caravans take the kidnapped

derelicts through nearby caverns that descend into the drow

realms. The operation has gone on for years, and literally hun-

dreds of victims have been taken away.

At  this  point,  possibly  after  months  of  buildup,  the  PCs

are  nally sure that they are facing the drow. However, they

have confronted only a few dark elves so far and have yet to

journey any deeper than the cellar of a house. They now face

the prospect of descending into the Underdark to confront

the drow on their home ground. Worse, further clues indicate

that other disguised drow live in the city, so even if the slaver

ring has been stopped, a greater threat still looms. Only in the

subterranean realm of the dark elves can the PCs learn the

true identities of the drow agents.

This extended example shows that the key to working the

drow into your campaign is to portray them as cruel masquer-

aders and assassins, with hidden  ngers that reach into many

facets of the PCs lives. The drow should seem like an invisible

threat, always potentially lurking around the next corner. Build

the suspense until it is almost a relief when the party  nally

hears the click of hand crossbows  ring. Of course, once the

PCs learn what the drow are capable of in combat, their relief

will be short lived.

DROW-BASED CAMPAIGNS

You can build a whole campaign around the drow, whether

with PCs of surface-dwelling races or with a party of dark elf

adventurers. It is also possible to start with an all-surface party

and, through attrition and replenishment, gain members that

are drow. Either way, the PCs can be noble and good, evil like

typical drow, or neutral as they try to make their fortune in

a drow world.

The section above provides a sample springboard for build-

ing a surface campaign around the drow. However, you can also

run an Underdark campaign in which the PCs are members

of other subterranean races. In a campaign of this kind, the

drow are an omnipresent threat, but they are part of a neces-

sary trade alliance of mutual bene t to all the Underdark races.

The player characters focus on defending against drow raids,

making their own incursions against the dark elves, conduct-

ing trade missions to deal with the drow, spying on the drow,

and perhaps eventually commanding a small citadel or outpost

intended to serve as a  rst defense against attack.

Another possibility is for players to run drow characters

who are disaffected outcasts. This kind of campaign is simi-

lar to the Underdark campaign described above, except that

the outcasts have no society or establishment of their own to

ask for help or refuge. Instead, the PCs probably survive as

Underdark bandits, preying on their former people and other

subterranean dwellers. The adventurers must deal with all the

threats of the Underdark while fending off attacks by drow

and by members of other races who might be hunting them.

The characters might  nd acceptance among other races or

at least among small groups such as adventuring parties, but

that would depend on why they are outcasts from drow society.

Have they forsaken evil, as did the noble Drizzt DoUrden?

Are  they  lower-caste  drow  seeking  a  better  existence?  Are

they vile drow criminals  eeing from the vendettas of pow-

erful enemies? Regardless, a campaign of outcasts involves a

constant struggle for acceptance and existence.

The  nal type of drow campaign involves dark elf player

characters who are still a part of drow society. Though prob-

ably of low birth, the PCs will need the support of at least a

moderately powerful drow house or individual to survive all

the foes and vendettas that their actions will surely draw. The

PCs might be enforcers for a particular house or spies gathering

information on its enemies and rivals. In the least restrictive

option, the PCs are hired by a drow house as explorers or to

represent their interests abroad by guarding caravans or pro-

curing valuable materials from distant regions. These sorts

of activities shield the characters from most of the everyday

backbiting  and  plotting  of  drow  society,  allowing  them  to

participate in more traditional adventures. Player characters

who  operate  within  a  drow  city  instead  have  just  as  much

opportunity and danger, but their adventures usually involve

more intrigue and less exploration.

Parties should avoid including PCs who are noble or elite

dark elves, mainly because such drow prefer to let subordinates

do their menial work while they focus on their schemes and

decadent lifestyles. Also, noble drow face the near-constant

threat of extermination by rivals, perhaps even a sibling or

other close relative within their house. However, it is possible

for a party to include one disaffected or daring noble, perhaps

a sixth- or seventh-born son who is deemed expendable by

his house and is sent away to see if he can procure any useful

talents or good fortune. Such parties will still be targeted by

drow schemes, but at a more manageable level that does not

interfere too much with normal play.

Despite what has been said above, if you and your players

prefer  a  campaign  of  intrigue,  maneuvering,  and  potential

death at the end of an assassins blade, then ranking members

of drow houses are ideal character choices. The PCs will not

explore many dungeons or  ght hordes of monstersin fact,

entire sessions might pass without anyone drawing a blade.

However, the rich possibilities for roleplaying in a world of

cruel, ruthless nobles can provide hours of entertainment.

THE DROW HOOK

Drawing a party of surface adventurers into the deep realms

of the drow requires some preparation on your part. Although

PCs are often willing to brave a dungeon to face great danger

and escape with great rewards, it is more dif cult to convince

them to descend into the labyrinth of the Underdark, since

they will not climb out to a bright sun and a refreshing breeze

at the end of the day. Instead, you will need a good hook to

lure them into such a hostile and alien environment for pro-

longed periods of time.

First, when the PCs discover that they will soon face an

Underdark expedition and a probable confrontation with the

drow, allow them to prepare accordingly. Nothing reassures

a  group  of  player  characters  more  than  learning  about  the

perils that might lie ahead and preparing countermeasures.

Allow them to consult sages and make Knowledge checks and

Gather Information checks to  nd out more about the hazards

involved. Let them buy specialized equipment (see Chapter

4, or other books such as Underdark and Arms and Equipment

Guide), either in a shop before they leave town or in a conve-

nient Underdark bazaar run by sympathetic traders shortly

after they set out. As they travel farther into the realms of the

drow, allow them to keep gathering intelligence on their foes

from additional sources along the way, or provide them with

access to divination magic that they can put to good use. If you

are running a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, remember that in

portions of the Underdark affected by faerzress (see page 154),

divinations are limited.

In  addition  to  letting  the  PCs  prepare  for  an  extended

Underdark  campaign,  provide  them  with  good  motivation

to  do  so.  No  doubt  they  could   nd  a  closer  dungeon  with

hoards of gold that are defended by lesser guardians, so give

the adventurers a good reason to take on a bigger risk.

One such example was provided earlier in this chapter, in

which the PCs uncover a drow slave trade that kidnaps victims

from the surface. Another motivation stems from the sheer

mystery of the dark elves. They are an ancient, magical race

that has lived away from the light of the sun and has developed

independently from surface cultures. The wondrous lore and

secrets that they might hold is a strong temptation for anyone

who values knowledge. As another example, consider a sce-

nario in which the PCs must obtain crucial information about

an enemy government, and in ltration seems impossible. If

they learn that the subtle drow have already penetrated the

ranks of those of cials, the PCs might be eager to pay a call on

the dark elf spies. Of course, the drow had their own reasons

for worming their way into that particular government, and

they remain hostile to the player characters. But by offering

gold or some other item of value, the PCs might be able to

barter for the information they seek.

On  the  subject  of  money,  it  is  important  to  remember

that although the drow are an inherently evil race, they are

also open traders. They participate in peaceful trade all over

the  Underdark,  and  their  caravans  ply  the  routes  between

all  points  except  the  strongholds  of  their  most  implacable

foes. Nearly anyone who comes to a drow city to trade will

be allowed to do so, unless he has been declared an enemy

of the state. Drow are considered by all to be a wicked race,

but though a dark elf would likely be killed on sight if he

approached a surface elf community, those same surface elves

could visit a drow city to trade with relative impunity. Such

visitors are still in danger from individual drow who prey on

anyone who looks weak, but as long as the PCs follow the local

customs, they should be safe from of cial harassment or arrest

by the houses or the church.

Thus, an open-trade society that is known for its innova-

tive magic items and spells is a strong draw for adventuring

parties. In addition, drow produce poisons and many kinds of

illicit materials that cannot ordinarily be found in civilized

circles but that might be sought by adventurers. The bazaars

and shops of the dark elves are potential pots of gold for those

who need esoteric or illegal items.

Finally, drow often establish their cities near special magical

locations that grant bene ts to those who know the secret. If

the PCs learn of such a location, they might decide that the

bene ts gained are worth a trip into the Underdark and a visit

to the nearest drow city.

Whatever  reasons  the  party  might  have  for  visiting  the

drow in your campaign, the PCs are sure to face intrigue on

many levels and deadly foes at every turn who strike at the

 rst sign of weakness.

DROW CITIES AND

ENVIRONS

The Long Walk, the Night Below, the Forest of Stone, the Sun-

less Desertall these describe the unforgiving terrain that is

the Underdark. Endless tunnels and caverns of lifeless stone

broken here and there by fetid pools of water or clumps of toxic

fungus  ll much of this dark, desolate waste. Survival is always

an issue; residents must compete for water, food, and even air to

breathe just to exist. However, despite these austere conditions,

life not only exists but often thrives in the cold

stone tunnels. Perhaps

the greatest examples

of these oases of life

are the drow cities.

Cosmopolitan

and  decadent,

drow  cities

wou ld  not

look  out  of

place in the

greatest

human

empire, were it not for two features. The  rst is the weird urban

architecture, which blends native stone formations with magi-

cal innovations. The second feature is, of course, the many

depraved Underdark races that roam the city streets, not the

least of which are the dark elves themselves. But stripping

away appearances, drow cities are not unlike those that might

be found in any theocratic, matriarchal society of magically

talented killers and thieves.

Architectural and social oddities are not the only subjects

of curiosity, however. Surface dwellers usually wonder how

drow cities come to be established in the  rst place, and how

they manage to survive over centuries. Chapter 1 of this book

describes the social structure and culture of the drow, and

Chapter 7 provides an overview of Erelhei-Cinlu, one of the

greatest drow cities. This chapter details the hows and whys

of drow cities in general.

In a hostile subterranean environment such as the Under-

dark, the placement of a major population center is not to be

undertaken lightly. A community cannot simply sit in a cave

that has easy access to the surface and the abundant resources

available there. First, such a location would not, by de nition,

be in the Underdark, but rather in a shallow surface cavern that

has little in common with the caves of lower reaches. Second,

such a place is doubly exposed to danger, not just from the

denizens of the surrounding tunnels but also from

intruders from the surface who might come in

search  of  valuable  minerals  and  ores,

hoards  of  loot  and

magic,  or  handy

below. Thus, a city in a shallow cavern must either be extremely

well hiddena dif cult prospect for a population center, and

one that still does not prevent random incursionsor be part

of a support network of nearby realms that provides mutual

defense and warning. Neither option appeals to the drow, or

indeed to most other denizens of the deep caverns.

When  you  are  planning  a  settlement  in  the  Underdark,

many considerations must be taken into account. One of the

advantages is that of limited access. Surface settlements in all

but the most hazardous or remote terrain can be approached

from  nearly  any  direction.  But  in  the  Underdark,  access  is

restricted to the surrounding tunnels, which can be carefully

guarded to provide security for the settlement. Furthermore,

surface communities usually face the threat of approach by

air, which is eliminated entirely in the Underdark except in

the largest caverns, and even those are protected by stalactites,

slimes, and strange creatures.

The advantages of being surrounded by stone are negated

somewhat when dealing with burrowing creatures such as

thoqquas or umber hulks, but the same dangers exist for any

landlocked site on the surface. In fact, the threat is worse above

ground due to the number of beasts that can burrow through

soil and loose earth, whereas fewer creatures can penetrate the

solid rock of the Underdark.

Another  major  consideration  is  the  availability  of  basic

necessities. First and foremost among them is breathable air.

Hazardous gases and depleted air supplies in caverns with no

way to replenish their atmosphere have long posed a risk for

those who delve too deep. These dangers are discussed in more

detail later in this chapter, but suf ce it to say that the drow

always choose sites that have a replenishable air supply.

The presence of potable water is another major factor in

the location of a drow city. Despite its reputation as a series of

moist caverns that constantly drip into plentiful pools, much

of the Underdark consists of dead caverns. Some of these dry

spaces were formed without the use of water; in others, the

water that carved the caverns has long since dispersed and

evaporated. Although small groups can subsist on magically

created or puri ed water, such an existence is precarious. The

best solution is to  nd a living cave in which the formative

liquid processes are still changing the caverns structure and

shape. In such locations, pools of water are common and often

potable due to the  ltering effects of the surrounding layers

of rock. Many living caverns have turbulent Underdark rivers

or genuine lakes deep in the bowels of the earth.

After water, the most important necessity is sustenance.

Once again, barring magical intervention, settlers must have

a  source  of  food  that  can  sustain  them.  Some  races  of  the

UNDERDARK RADIATIONS

The drow often choose locations for their cities based on magi-

cal or natural emanations. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign

setting, a magical radiation called faerzress permeates much if

not all of the Underdark, interfering with divination and tele-

portation  spells.  Anyone  in  an  area  of  faerzress  receives  a +4

bonus on Will saves against divination spells, and casters of

teleportation magic that covers any distance over 1 mile must

make a successful DC 35 Spellcraft check or suffer a mishap.

Casters of infallible forms of this magic, such as word of recall

or greater teleport spells, must make a successful DC 25 Spell-

craft check.

In addition, the emanations of faerzress allow magic items to

be  created  cheaply  and  easily  with  a  special  property  known

as  drowcraft.  Within  an  area  of  faerzress,  drowcraft  weapons

provide  a +2  luck  bonus  on  attack  rolls  and  damage  rolls  in

addition to their normal enhancements, and drowcraft armor

provides a +2 deflection bonus. These additional bonuses do

not apply outside an area of faerzress, and if exposed to sunlight,

drowcraft items lose their additional enhancements.

In the Vault of the Drow, natural radiation is given off by rock

formations  in  the  ceilingsmall  pockets  of  unique  minerals

and a huge mass of tumkeoite, a heavy and unstable magnetic

metal that slowly decays with exposure to air. The formations

transform into lacofcite, a dense, crumbling ore that absorbs

certain wavelengths of light energy and gives off a lurid glow.

The result is an effect almost like a moon and starry sky in the

rocky upper reaches of the Vault, and, like faerzress, it interferes

with teleportation. Drow who live in the Vault prize the fact that

surface raiders cannot teleport directly into their cities and out

again. The game effect is the same difficulty in casting these

spells as within an area of faerzress. Furthermore, all sources

of illumination exposed to the emanations are reduced to one-

quarter of their normal area and give off only a muted pale glow

that is much preferred by the sensitive eyes of the drow.

Drow are mysterious and otherworldly, so feel free to create

different  emanations  and  effects  from  radiations,  strange

growths of spores or fungi, magnetic forces, or perhaps power-

ful curses or artifacts. One example is given below.

DARKLIGHT ORE

Darklight ore is a rare and dangerous substance found in the

Underdark. It occurs only in formations of heavy metal ore. A

darklight lodes inherent properties cause it to give off a milky,

purple glow that is equal to a torch for the purpose of illumina-

tion. However, this radiation is poisonous. Of all the Underdark

races, only the drow have been known to mine the ore and har-

ness its power, using lead-shielded equipment.

Anyone who comes within 60 feet of a darklight lode without

appropriate  armor  or  shielding  (such  as  that  provided  by  a

stone wall) is immediately exposed to darklight poisoning. For

all purposes, darklight poisoning functions as regular poison.

The Fortitude save to resist darklight poisoning is DC 18. The

initial effect is 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The second-

ary effect is a disease that is similar to mummy rot. However,

this disease is not magical, so a paladins divine health and a

monks purity of body allow those characters to resist its effect.

Furthermore, a victim who dies of darklight poisoning does not

shrivel into dust. A caster level check is required for a healing

spell to work on a victim of darklight poisoning, but this limita-

tion is overcome by a neutralize poison spell rather than break

enchantment or remove curse.

Some sages have theorized a connection between darklight

ore  radiation  and  the  existence  of  the  mutated  fungus  com-

monly  known  as  violet  fungus.  No  link  has  been  proven  yet,

but violet fungus appears to be impervious to the effect of the

radiation.

Underdarkincluding  many  breeds  of  vermin  and  some

beast-follower quaggoth tribeshave been known to survive

through cannibalism, but that hardly reaches the level of soci-

ety desired by most communities, and certainly not the urbane

sophistication of a drow city. Although the dark elves feed on

their own metaphorically, they would shudder in disgust at

the thought of doing so literally (in public, at least).

The need for food is often met by the presence of another

requirementwater. Where there is water, many types of edible

fungi and slime molds grow or can be cultivated. Likewise, wet

oases in the Underdark desert attract creatures from all around

that also rely on water for survival. This situation provides excel-

lent hunting opportunities but can lead to problems if dangerous

predators choose to do some hunting of their own near a  edg-

ling community. A wise city planner seeks a protected water

supply with a constant runoff that descends to a more deserted

area. In addition, placing extra water sources at speci c locations

might attract beasts that stray close enough to serve as a food

supply but not close enough to constitute a hazard.

In addition to matters of survival, the drow might have other

reasons to establish a city on a given site. The dark elves are a

vicious and aggressive race of slavers and manipulators, but

they are rarely martial conquerors. So although they might

subjugate nearby communities of lesser races and make raids

on enemy enclaves, they are seldom organized or disciplined

enough to create a true drow empire. Instead, they are prone

to pursue individual achievement and advancement. There-

fore, drow are extremely social, capable of diplomacy with all

but their most hated enemies or anyone who happens to be

disfavored by Lolth.

Likewise,  although  the  drow  command  a  work  force  of

slaves and are capable of impressive feats of arti ce, anything

that cannot be created through raw labor or their own talents

must be imported. The drow do not accept the idea of doing

without, so to satisfy their desire for specialized goods and

luxury items, they rely on trade. It drives their economy, and

the dark elves try to build their cities in sites where they can

command  or  at  least  strongly  in uence  major  Underdark

trade routes. The city of Erelhei-Cinlu (see Chapter 7) is one

such hub. Its residents wield power over a route that extends

through  miles  of  tunnels  before  reaching  the  surface,  and

they also command a major port on a vast Underdark sea that

has access to diverse markets abroad.

Despite their sinister reputation and deadly nature, drow

cities  are  open  to  visitors  from  nearly  any  race,  as  long  as

outlanders come for legitimate trade purposes and abide by

the laws (or, more accurately, the cruel whims of the ruling

elite).  In  the  more  cosmopolitan  drow  cities,  even  surface

elves can walk about safely, provided that they are backed by

a prominent merchant consortium whose amicable relations

are desired by the drow.

Other, more esoteric reasons can account for the positioning

of drow cities as well. The true story behind the founding of a

particular settlement might be based on any factor described

above, or several factors in combination. Once again, Erelhei-

Cinlu is a good exampleit has abundant air, water, and food;

it is defensible; it is an important trade nexus; and it possesses

some of the special characteristics described below.

Sometimes the drow choose the location of a settlement

based on religious or superstitious beliefs that brand it as a

place of power. A city can result from something as mysteri-

ous as drow refugees being led by visions to a promised haven

to something as direct as Lolth ordering a priestess to found

a new community at a speci c location. In any case, outcast

drow or those otherwise excluded from the ruling elite are

drawn  to  places  of  power,  seeing  them  as  opportunities  to

escape their circumstances, build better lives, or simply form

a  new  ruling  elite  and  wield  the  power  that  eluded  them

elsewhere.  Disaffected  drow  adventurers  and  second  and

third  children  of  noble  houses  are  more  likely  to  colonize

such a place and create a community in an image they prefer.

Likewise, drow of lower castes who can make the trip usually

tag along to reinvent themselves and improve their station.

Almost invariably, however, the new settlement falls into the

same ingrained patterns that have dictated drow behavior for

millennia, and it ends up looking much like the community

from which it spawned.

Some places of power have a magical nature. For example,

a blood of the Spider Queen site (see page 187) is a location

infused with the divine essence of Lolth, spilled eons ago when

she was wounded in battle by Corellon Larethian. A drow who

discovers one of these rare sites (and who is quali ed to activate

its inherent magical power) receives a divine mandate from

Lolth that almost always results in the establishment of a new

drow city and the creation of a new aristocracy. Despite their

scarcity, blood of the Spider Queen sites have served as the

foundations of several great drow cities. Indeed, some of the

most powerful drow houses ever known were bene ciaries of

the divine mandate provided by such locations.

Another peculiar factor in establishing a drow settlement

is a sites emanations. As natural practitioners of the magical

arts, the drow have an af nity to the magical and mundane

radiations of the Underdark. Sometimes, these strange ethers

result from natural geological processes in which heavy ore

breaks  down  into  a  new  form,  releasing  different  kinds  of

energy. Sometimes the emanations are the result of magical

conjunctions that occur in the earth itself. In either case, drow

wizards and arti cers can harness the energy to enhance their

creations or augment their spellcasting. As a result, when such

locations are found, they are guarded jealously. Examples of

locations with magical intensity include earth nodes (Under-

dark, page 49), areas that are affected by faerzress (in a FORGOTTEN

REALMS campaign; see the sidebar Underdark Radiations), and

the Vault of the Drow (see the same sidebar).

Once a drow city has been established, the area around it

is rapidly transformed from a wild and dangerous place into a

more civilized wild and dangerous place. Subterranean crea-

tures move their lairs farther from the hustle and bustle of

the city, and drow patrols begin sweeping the tunnels, slowly

bringing them under drow sway and teaching the native inhab-

itants that the dark-skinned elves are best avoided.

The surrounding areas that are heavily in uenced by the

drow but not claimed by them are referred to as the Border-

lands, and the untamed regions that lie beyond the farthest

patrols are called the Wilds. Both environments are described

in detail below.

DROW SETTLEMENTS

Dwarves and duergar chisel out subterranean chambers and

halls. Trolls and troglodytes prefer to lair in endless burrows

and warrens. But drow like to dwell in more open areasas

much as such areas can be found in the Underdark. Rather

than existing as a system of mines or interconnected defensive

chambers, drow settlements are usually found in caverns or

cysts in the earth with relatively wide-open spaces. Perhaps

as a result of their elf heritage, drow prefer to live with a sky

overhead, even if that sky is only tens of feet above and consists

of a dome of solid rock.

The drow are masters of modifying the existing features of

a cavern or tunnel system through magic and delving, thereby

creating a habitation that is defensible and aesthetically pleas-

ing.  Drow  make  frequent  use  of  stone  shape  and  carefully

molded walls of stone.

In  addition  to  magically  created  stone  structures,  drow

love to turn natural features such as massive stalagmites and

stalactites  into  homes  and  defenses.  Through  magic  or,  if

necessary,  brute  labor,  they  create  chambers  and  defensive

positions within these formations.

Drow love towers of all types, perhaps due to the ancient

elf blood that still  ows through their veins. Whether crafted

from  an  existing  rock  formation  or  fashioned  entirely  by

magic,  such  structures  are  slender  and  graceful,  with  an

elegance that seems to defy gravity and an ephemeral beauty

that calls to mind the wonders of faerie. Towers  gure promi-

nently into the defense of drow cities, anchoring the walls that

surround a settlement and serving as defensive points in their

own right. Most noble houses consist of compounds that are

veritable fortresses and make frequent use of towers. The walls

and towers of typical drow cities are further augmented by

devious tricks and traps, such as cultivated patches of slimes

and molds, hidden pits or shifting walls, and magical applica-

tions of spike stones, glyphs, and symbols.

The city of Erelhei-Cinlu blends all the features mentioned

above into a single community. It sits in a massive cavern called

the Vault of the Drow that is over six miles long, nearly as

broad, and several thousand feet high at the apex of its dome.

The only entrance to the Vault, other than by river, is shielded

by a massive tower atop a mesa that controls all ingress. Erel-

hei-Cinlu is surrounded by a stone wall that has many guard

towers and a single huge gate, and it lies at the edge of a river

that runs along the base of a high plateau accessible only by

a lone bridge. Atop this enormous foundation sit the estates

of the noble drow houses, each forti ed and protected by its

own arti ce.

Erelhei-Cinlu and the Vault are iconic examples of drow

architecture, but almost any dark elf settlement of signi cant

size shares some or all of the same features, whether the city

is built atop a plateau, along a chasm cliff, or into the side of a

massive stalagmite. Often the settlement can be entered only

by  crossing  a  particular  bridge  or  by  magically   ying  over

an obstacle, and woe be to foolish invaders who get within

range of the crossbows and spells of the communitys guard-

ians and wizards.

Thanks to its unfriendly architecture, life within a drow

city is fairly safe. Visitors need not fear the usual predators

and dangers of the Underdark, but they still must contend

with the dark elvesnot to mention thralls and slaves that

are  half  again  as  big  and  sometimes  twice  as  numerous  as

their drow masters. Hordes of goblinoids, trolls, undead, kuo-

toas,  duergar,  troglodytes,   ends,  illithids,  and  adventurers

live and work side by side more or less peacefully. Of course,

violence still erupts, and the drow have no real codi ed laws

that must be followed. However, an underlying agreement to

avoid disturbing the local drow masters and bringing down

their wrath keeps everyone in line, limiting altercations to

small-scale engagements and momentary bouts of melee that

enliven the day. The general rule is that you can keep what-

ever you are strong enough to hold, but since the local drow

are undoubtedly the strongest in the area, such nonsense is

limited to the shadows and back alleys.

Crime is especially rampant in drow cities, but most vic-

tims are either members of the lower castes, from whom the

criminals do not fear reprisal, or visitors from afar, who are

just  as  unlikely  to  pursue  a  vendetta.  If  guests  follow  the

customs  of  the  city,  such  as  wearing  identifying  markers

and steering clear of forbidden areas, they are likely to avoid

undue perilat least from the sentient inhabitants. But drow

make pets of dangerous creatures, including giant lizards and

displacer beasts. As long as these creatures are well tended by

their drow masters, they are fairly harmless, but if someone

carelessly ventures within easy clawing or biting distance, he

invites injury or death. In addition, these beasts occasionally

escape their pens or slip their handlers and run loose through

the streets. At such times, it is best to take cover and avoid their

attacks. Killing the favored pet of a drow matriarch, even in

self-defense, can lead to worse trouble than being mauled by

the creature.

To  feed  the  multitudes  of  their  cities,  the  drow  grow

edible fungus, which is often magically enhanced to become

larger and more nutritious. Enormous fungus farms tended

by slaves not only feed the citizens but also provide grazing

 elds for creatures cultivated as food stock. These farms are

well defended by slaves and their overseers, as well as patrols

of drow warriors mounted on riding lizards and using trained

displacer beasts as trackers. Only the most desperate would

dare to invade these fungal orchards, for though the drow are

somewhat picky about their table fare, the half-starved goblin

and bugbear slaves are unlikely to turn down a meal of freshly

caught humanoids.

Many creatures live in and around drow settlements, serv-

ing as guardians, food stock, nuisances, or predators. Some of

these beasts are described in Chapter 5, and others are brie y

described in the Denizens of the Underdark sidebar. Flesh out

any of those creatures that catch your interest and use them

in your drow campaign.

One  nal warning to those who plan to visit a drow city

the  dark  elves  cohabitate  with  large  numbers  of  spiders  of

mundane  and  monstrous  varieties.  Most  drow  settlements

are infested with arachnids of all shapes and sizes. Many are

DENIZENS OF THE UNDERDARK

In addition to the creatures detailed elsewhere in this book (and

in  other  game  supplements),  several  other  creatures  call  the

subterranean realms their home. Brief descriptions of each of

these creatures appear in this sidebar.

ROTH

Roth are herd animals that strongly resemble musk oxen with

curving horns, cloven hooves, and long, shaggy coats of thick

hair. They are docile, but when penned, untrained roth tend to

react violently, biting and goring anyone nearby. Three breeds

exist:  deep  roth,  ghost  roth,  and  surface  roth.  The  latter

two  are  Large  creatures  that  live  on  the  surface.  Deep  roth

are of Medium size and live in the Underdark. Many races that

also live belowground domesticate herds of the beasts as their

major food source.

Deep roth are magical beasts that have adapted to herd

survival in subterranean settings. They have immunity to ill

effects  from  contact  with  mold,  fungus,  and  other  spores,

allowing them to feed on almost any substance that grows in

the tunnels of the Underdark. Further, roth have the innate

ability to create a dancing lights effect that serves as an in-

stinctual signal to the herd, conveying messages of food and

danger.

For  statistics  for  the  various  breeds  of  roth,  see  the  FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, page 313. If you do not have

access to that book, you can substitute a boar (MM 270), as

long as you give it immunity to mold and fungus, cold resis-

tance 10, and the ability to create dancing lights.

CRICKETS AND LIZARDS

Second only to the roth in frequency, giant lizards and giant

cave crickets are used as food stock for drow cities. The giant

herd  lizards  should  not  be  confused  with  the  trained  pack

lizards  and  riding  lizards  described  in  Chapter  5.  Instead,

they  represent  a  more  lethargic  and  docile  species  of  giant

lizard bred for a milder temperament and the ability to attain

greater  girth  and  hold  more  muscle  and  fat  tissue.  They  are

carnivorous but not aggressive, preferring to feed on carrion

or  recently  killed  cave  crickets  or  roth  rather  than  trying  to

hunt for themselves.

Giant  cave  crickets  are  a  common  pest  in  the  Underdark

near settlements and areas of prolific organic growth. They

can be up to 3 feet long and have a carapace of mottled gray

and  white.  They  feed  on  plant  life  and  the  many  harmless

slimes and molds of the Underdark, but unlike the deep roth,

they are not immune to harmful varieties. Cave crickets are

flighty and capable of leaping great distances, usually when

they spot movement or light. Specimens bred in captivity are

much  less  prone  to  being  spooked,  but  to  keep  them  from

scattering if they startle, their handlers cover their enclosures

with large nets, tens of yards across, woven of roth hair or

fibrous fungus.

BLIND CAVE FISH

As  ubiquitous  to  the  deep  caverns  as  gloom  is  the  humble

blind  cave  fish.  These  creatures  have  been  staples  since  the

earliest days of fantasy literature, and they have been part of the

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game at least as far back as the Shallow

Pool (Room 33) in the Caves of Chaos, in the classic adventure

The Keep on the Borderlands.

These  Diminutive  animals  are  a  species  of  fish  related  to

trout. In pools that are especially still and deep, they can grow

to 4 or more feet in length, but most blind cave fish rarely mea-

sure more than 1 foot from end to end. They lost the ability to

see eons ago, when their ancestors first swam down through

tiny cavern streams into the Underdark. Instead, the fish sur-

vive by using blindsight (effective out to 30 feet), though wide,

vestigial eyes still bulge from either side of their head. They are

not aggressive, feeding on the tiny algae and insects that thrive

in their pools of cold, fresh water.

Blind cave fish are pale white, almost transparent, having lost

their  pigmentation  along  with  their  sight.  However,  they  are

easily visible in clear cavern pools, appearing almost luminous.

Drow and other races use the fish as food stock, breeding them

in hatchery pools to protect them from aquatic predators.

Blind cave fish are harmless and have no effective forms of

attack against anything larger than a fly.

THE STALACTOIDS

No Underdark adventure is complete without a journey through

cave mouths and tunnels filled with stalagmites and stalactites,

which suggest massive, fanged maws to even the most obtuse

explorer. However, these ominous locations hold dangers that

are all too realthe stalactoids. That term refers to creatures

that  have  the  ability  to  camouflage  themselves  as  stalactite

formations. The most common examples are darkmantles and

piercers, which are distantly related species on a genetic level.

The  drow  capture  these  creatures  and  train  them  to  pose  a

hazard to anyone passing through a certain portion of a cavern

or tunnel.

Piercers  are  simple  organisms  that  consist  of  a  stony  shell

tapering  to  a  point  that  surrounds  its  internal  organs.  The

exposed  flat  base  holds  its  maw  and  a  ring  of  tiny  muscular

tendrils that allow slow movement and wall climbing. Piercers

hang inverted from cavern ceilings, looking for all the world like

stalactites.  When  they  sense  vibrations  caused  by  a  creature

passing below, they release their grip on the ceiling and attempt

to impale the intruder. If they succeed in killing the victim, they

slowly  feed  on  its  corpse  (though  they  are  virtually  helpless

while doing so). Otherwise, they begin their slow ascent back

up the wall to the ceiling.

The darkmantle (MM 38) is a recent evolutionary improve-

ment  on  the  simple  piercer.  Darkmantles  also  hang  inverted

from  the  ceiling,  appearing  to  be  stalactites,  but  they  can

change  their  color  to  better  match  the  native  stone.  Further

developments include a membranous hide stretched between

small  tentacles  that  allows  gliding,  and  the  inherent  magical

ability to create darkness.

ANGLERS OF THE DEPTHS

One of the strangest types of Underdark vermin is the cave

fisher. This arachnoid creature has six legs and two lobster-

like claws. A long proboscis extending from its head can fire

a  sticky,  weblike  filament  up  to  60  feet.  A  cave  fisher  uses

the filament to reel in prey, which it then dispatches with its

claws.  Typically,  a  cave  fisher  perches  on  a  ledge  near  the

cavern ceiling or clings to a stalactite, trailing its long, adhe-

sive filament below to capture bats or more substantial prey.

Drow occasionally charm these creatures and place them at

strategic  cavern  mouths,  ledges,  or  parapets  around  their

cities and fortresses.

pets or guardians of noble houses and priestesses of Lolth, but

it is dif cult to keep track of such vermin, and they quickly

overbreed. Their spawn runs wild through the cities, scrab-

bling through back alleys and leaping across rooftops. These

spiders are natural predators and will feast on any creature they

can capture and disable. Only the hardiest arachnids lair in

the sewers, however, because those fetid tunnels harbor even

worse horrors that are best left to the imagination.

THE BORDERLANDS

Just beyond the edges of the drow cities and their controlled

areas of farms, strongholds, and slave warrens is an area known

as the Borderlands. It varies in width from only a few hundred

feet where there are no easily accessible tunnels to many miles

where traversable paths exist, and the area can be far larger

where tunnels hug a major trade route.

The Borderlands are unclaimed by the drow but still feel

the effect of their dominion. Drow patrols pass through the

area frequently, mounted on riding lizards or spiders for speed

and maneuverability. These patrols originate at small fortresses

and outposts garrisoned by contingents of drow soldiers and

commanded by a mid-level spellcaster or two. Such outposts

might be nothing more than a gate warding passage through

a tunnel with crude billet chambers chipped out of the stone

of the surrounding walls, or they could be as elaborate as a

self-suf cient fortress with a permanent garrison and sporadic

contact with its mother city. The latter kind of outpost is likely

to have higher-level leaders and a moderate-sized chapel staffed

by priestesses of Lolth.

The Borderlands are fairly free of unintelligent monsters

and predators, which are tracked and hunted by the drow for

sport or as a security precaution. However, the drow might

allow a small enclave of beasts to exist in a limited area, where

they can provide additional security for vulnerable points or

important tunnels.

Intelligent monsters still live in the Borderlands, avoiding

drow patrols and plundering travelers and caravans for food

and treasure. These opportunistic predators play a dangerous

game and must never draw too much attention to themselves.

They  include  drow  outcasts,  bandits  of  various  races,  and

slavers on the hunt for victims who would not be missed. In

addition, illithids establish base camps in the Borderlands,

often unknown to the drow, where they observe their some-

time allies and gather information through mundane or more

gruesome means.

THE WILDS

Beyond the range of regular drow patrols is the region that

comprises most of the Underdark, an area known to the sub-

terranean races as the Wilds. Some of this territory is isolated

and accessible only through magic or digging, and other parts

of the realm are so remote that it seems no creature has ever

set foot there. Despite the lack of drow, the wet, overgrown

Wilds offer unfettered perils in all forms. Only the most expe-

rienced cavestalkers traverse these areas safely, and then only

because they know better than to tread lightly. A typical sur-

face adventurer, or even a shrewd drow explorer, will not last

long without a healthy dose of assistance, luck, or magic.

As mentioned previously, most of the Underdark can be

likened to a lifeless desert, with seemingly endless stretches

of caverns and tunnels that have no light or water. The sheer

monotony can drive a traveler tunnelcrazed (as some of the

dwellers below call it). In addition, the relatively cool tempera-

tures and the lack of sunlight can mask signs of thirst. Like

an  insidious  predator,  dehydration  sneaks  up  on  a  traveler

before he realizes itand perhaps before he can take steps

to alleviate it.

Escaping to the living tunnels of the Wilds, where water still

 ows and food sources are more abundant, is only marginally

better, because here, predators thrive. Spiders, bats, and other

vermin and animals are common, as they are throughout the

Underdark. But explorers might also encounter myconidsMM2,

xorns, violet fungi, umber hulks, elementals, cloakers, lurk-

ersUnd, ropers, oozes, and even soft beds of moss that release

deadly spores at the merest touch. Some of the more danger-

ous monsters include deep dragons (as well as other kinds, on

occasion),  beholders,  aboleths,  purple  worms,  stone  giants,

and  nightshades.  In  addition,  many  kinds  of  undead  roam

the Wilds, bemoaning the fate that drew them to their doom

and looking for others to share their eternal misery. To top it

all off, the near-constant echo of dripping water can mask the

sounds of approaching danger to travelers who are not attuned

to the areas natural rhythms.

Finally, the Wilds hold strange sites and topographic oddi-

ties that can be hazardous by their very nature. Intelligent

creatures  sometimes  settle  in  or  near  such  places,  taking

advantage of the natural defenses they offer, but most such

sites  remain  undiscovered  or  at  least  uninhabited.  Sample

locations include:

Vast lava caverns, washed in extreme heat, where a few  at-

topped stalagmites serve as islands, connected by natural

arches. Creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire cavort

in this burning cauldron and attack trespassers.

Strange  crystalline  tunnels  that  are  actually   aws  in  a

gigantic diamond or other gemstone. Creatures from the

Elemental Plane of Earth make their home in this geode.

A massive, unplumbed abyss  lled with the rumbling thun-

der of a tidal sea far below, or perhaps seismic activity from

an unstable fault. Cloakers, lurkersUnd, and mutated bats  ap

around the upper reaches and roost on the many stalactites,

some of which occasionally break off, pulling any hangers-

on to their doom.

A system of fungal caverns coated in a dull green carpet

that comprises a single organic entity of impossible size.

Spores  and  fungal  parasites  make  this  place  particularly

deadly. Perhaps the entitys massive size and epochal age

has allowed it to gain a dim sentience. For an example of

such  a  creature  on  a  smaller  scale,  see  Gduars  Garden

(Underdark 188).

A complex tangle of lava tubes or worm tunnels that were

burrowed out eons ago and that now serve as a labyrinth

where predators patiently stalk one another.

NATURAL HAZARDS

Whether in the arid dead tunnels or the moisture-laden living

caverns of the Underdark, incautious travelers can easily fall

prey to many natural hazards. These dangers include weak

 oors, collapsing tunnels, treacherous chasms, and getting

lost in the twisting passages. For PCs native to the surface

world, making a successful DC 20 Survival check means they

manage to identify and avoid a natural hazard. For PCs who are

members of races native to the Underdark, this DC is reduced

by 5. As an option, you can allow a surface PC to take ranks in

the specialized skill Survival (Underdark) to reduce the checks

DC to 15, just as if he were a native of the Underdark.

Lack of Air

One of the biggest natural hazards of the Underdark is the

lack of good air. Many caverns and tunnels can be sealed by

rock falls or pools or have poor air circulation, which depletes

their air supply and makes them dangerous to creatures that

must  breathe.  Likewise,  organisms  can  give  off  fumes  or

spores, and tunnels can be saturated with colorless, odorless

natural gases that ruin the air supply. The FORGOTTEN REALMS

campaign accessory Underdark covers this subject in detail;

abbreviated rules appear below.

Air quality can be good, stale, or depleted. Good air quality

means the area has ventilation, oxygen-producing plant life, a

conduit to the Elemental Plane of Air, or some other source.

No game effects apply in areas of good air quality.

Stale air quality is found in isolated areas where the air has

been somewhat depleted but is not immediately deadly. Char-

acters who enter an area of stale air must make a successful

DC 25 Survival check (reduced by 5 for Underdark natives

as noted above) to notice the drop in air quality, unless there

are other clues such as fumes or odors. In stale air, a PC must

succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15 + 1 per previ-

ous  check)  or  become  fatigued.  A  fatigued  character  must

succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15 + 1 per previ-

ous  check)  or  become  exhausted.  An  exhausted  character

takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes until

exposed to good air.

Areas of depleted air no longer have any breathable oxygen

and can be identi ed by a PC who makes a successful DC 15

Survival check (reduced by 5 for Underdark natives as noted

above), unless there are other visual or olfactory clues. For the

effects of lack of air, see Slow Suffocation (DMG 304).

Gases in the air can be visible or invisible, noxious or odor-

less. Some of them can also be explosive. Characters can easily

detect gases that they can see or smell. To detect gases that

are invisible or odorless, PCs must make a successful DC 25

Survival check (reduced by 5 for Underdark natives as noted

above). A gas introduced to an area reduces its air quality by

one categorygood air becomes stale, and stale air becomes

depleted.

To battle the effects of poor air quality, miners and Under-

dark denizens rely on advance warning or protection. Small

caged animals such as birds, bats, or mice are often brought

along and observed on the assumption that they would exhibit

the effects of stale or depleted air sooner as a warning to others.

Various  spells  and  magic  items  also  address  this  problem,

though manyespecially the common ranks of the Under-

dark racescannot afford such luxuries.

Chapter  4  introduces  a  relatively  inexpensive  mundane

device called a breathing hood (see page 91). In areas where the

air quality is poor due to the presence of fumes or gases, the

hood improves the air quality for the wearer by one category

(unless the gases are heavier than air). Stale air is considered

good air for the wearer. Even if the air in an area has been

depleted, the area is considered to have stale air for the  rst

hour of the wearers exposure.

Cramped Spaces

Many areas of the Underdark are a tight  t and hinder both

speed and combat. The FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign acces-

sory Underdark covers this topic in detail; abbreviated rules

appear below.

Five main kinds of cramped spaces exist:

Spaces that are narrow or low (smaller than a creatures space

or height but by no more than half of that dimension).

Spaces  that  are  narrow  and  low  (smaller  than  both  the

creatures space and height but by no more than half of those

dimensions).

Spaces that are crawl-navigable (less than one-half but at

least one-quarter of a creatures height; it can move by remov-

ing  backpacks  and  bulky  equipment,  falling  prone,  and

crawling at a speed of 5 feet).

Spaces that are awkward (narrower than narrow, lower than

low, and smaller than crawl-navigable, but not quite a tight

squeeze).

Spaces that are a tight squeeze (big enough for a creatures

head but too small for its shoulders; see the Escape Artist

skill, PH 73).

The effects of these various kinds of cramped spaces are sum-

marized on Table 61.

ANYBYS VELIFANE

KEVERAS LORAKYTHE

Growing up in a society where females are all but expected to

join the clergy is tough for someone with a talent for arcane

magic. Anybys knew from an early age that her path did not go

through Lolths temple. Because of the ostracism and animosity

she faced, she decided the best way to keep her skin was to ensure

that her enemies never got close enough to be a threat.

Studying magical force effects was the outlet Anybys needed

to achieve her goals. Over the past century, she has developed

quite an arsenal to keep her foes at bay. Her method is to engage

potential enemies at a distance and destroy them before they

get within a bowshot of her lithe form.

Currently, Anybys is one of the premier master wizards in

the city of Erelhei-Cinlu. She is not af liated with any single

house, but many court her favor secretly in the hope of using

her power against their enemies. She occasionally takes on

house wizards as apprentices, but she tires of these students

quickly and either expels them from her tower or destroys

them  for  some  imagined  slight.  The  houses  have  not  yet

avenged the deaths, perhaps because they fear her power, or

perhaps because none of the victims has been of any impor-

tance. In any case, students who survive her tutoring harness

more powerful and devastating magic than they did before,

and the houses are always pleased with the results.

The  priestesses  of  the  Fane  of  Lolth  despise  Anybys  for

being a female who did not embrace the clergy, but they have

yet to move against her directly.

Keveras Lorakythe is the quintessential drow rake, working

the streets of Erelhei-Cinlu for easy marks and avoiding anyone

who smacks of authority. He is af liated with no one (other

than  occasional  part-time  alliances  for  mutual  pro t)  and

counts on no one but himself. He prefers to take his victims by

surprise and incapacitate them with trip or disarming attacks,

and he taunts those he accosts, using his Intimidate skill to

end the battle as quickly as possible. If Keveras is working

with others, he tries to set up  anking attacks. If preparing

for a particularly formidable opponent, he takes the time to

scout out the terrain and augment his weapons with poison

and oil of magic weapon.

LADY THANDYSHA

Lady  Thandysha  is  the  matriarch  of  the  up-and-coming

House Xaniqos, whose fortunes have exploded in Erelhei-

Cinlu  with  a  meteoric  rise.  Ambitious  and  impetuous,

Lady Thandysha is riding the ascendance of her house

to what she believes will be eventual domination of the

Vault of the Drow. She personally oversaw the execution

of the last of the members of House Everhate, and her lust

for power and taste for blood threaten to consume her. She

believes that House Xaniqos rises by the divine mandate of

Lolth. It remains to be seen whether her belief is correct or

the rise is due to a chaotic whim of the Spider Queen, but

Thandyshas personal power cannot be questioned. Even the

savvy Eclavdra of Eilservs (see page 193) has been forced to

take serious notice of this new player in the game.

Mindshard the warlock

MINDSHARD

Hatred  is  the  driving  force  of  the  drow  known  as  Mind-

shardspeci cally,  hatred  of  illithids.  Raised  as  a  slave,

Mindshard suffered much at the tentacles of the mind  ay-

ers. When he was old enough, they grafted a rending clawFF

to  his  body  and  tried  to  use  him  for  their  nefarious  ends.

When it became clear that Mindshard would not cooperate,

his master tried the one thing that could stop the slave from

causing  troubleextracting  his  brain.  But  as  the  illithid

started to bore into Mindshards skull, the drow snapped and

killed his master.

He was not quick enough to prevent himself from suffering

severe physical and mental damage. He still bears horrendous

scars  and  ridges  across  his  partially  bald  pate,  and  he  lost

the  memory  of  his  real  name.  Mindshard  is  a  name  that

he adopted to re ect his new state of being. The half-crazed

drow now harbors only one thoughtkill mind  ayersand

anyone who gets in his way might be surprised to learn that

he is quite formidable. He prefers to use his eldritch powers

to  dispose  of  foes,  but  he  happily  uses  his  illithid  graft  on

opponents who get close enough.

Currently,  Mindshard  is  being  used  as  a  tool  of  destruc-

tion by his adopted family, House Tormtor. It needs only

insinuate that a particular person consorts with illithids, and

Mindshard does the rest.

Xiletha the soulknife

XILETHA DHUVARYL

Xiletha became an outcast on the streets of Erelhei-Cinlu after

displaying powers at an early age that were neither understood

nor accepted by the ruling elite. As a result, she grew embit-

tered (even more than is usual for drow) and fell into the life of

an enforcer for hire. Her rates are low, and she works mainly

for middle- and lower-class employers, not wanting to draw

too much attention from the powers that be.

Xil, as she is usually called, excels in her work because she

likes to in ict pain. She wears dark clothing and keeps her silver

hair (which has a slight blue tint) in a loose ponytail. The mind

blades she manifests are always of a dark burgundy color. She tries

to deal maximum damage when possible with her psychic strike

and psionic weapon abilities in addition to the +2 psychokinetic

burst power of her mind blade. She carries no weapons, but she

is only a free action away from having something in hand.

DROW ASSASSIN

Assassins are some of the highest-paid individuals in drow

cities. Always in great demand, they enjoy lives of plenty and

comfort,  selling  their  services  to  anyone  who  is  willing  to

meet their price. Using poison, bolts, or blades, they get the

job donewhatever it entailswith ruthless ef ciency. Most

well-to-do drow keep an assassin or two on the payroll, even

if they have no current targets, primarily to ensure that the

killers do not betray them.

DROW INQUISITOR

In the tempestuous cities of the dark elves, traitors abound.

It  takes  the  keen  eye  of  a  skilled  torturer  to  ferret  out  the

plotters  and  conspirators,  thus  keeping  a  matriarchs  reign

as secure as possible. Most drow inquisitors are females who

have some training in the priesthood of Lolth. Blessed by the

Spider Queen, they use their profane abilities to extract what

they want to hear from their prisoners.

DROW PRIESTESS

No group or organization wields more power in drow society

than the clerics of Lolth. Drow priestesses are respected, or

at least feared, by nearly all other drow. They act on the will

of the Spider Queen, and occasionally on their own whim,

always vying for more power and the favor of their goddess.

They serve as battle eld commanders, constables, detectives,

and judges, as the situation requires.

DROW SLAVER

The  drow  enslave  other  races  as  laborers.  Raids  supply  the

majority  of  prisoners,  but  more  powerful  captives  have  to

be hunted down by skilled slavers. These tenacious trackers

scour the subterranean tunnels and sometimes the surface

world for marks that seem likely to fetch a high price. They

rarely kill their quarrythat would just add the expense of

a raise dead spell.

DROW WARRIOR

The rank and  le of drow civilization are the warriorsmales

who are out tted with basic weapons and armor to supple-

ment  their  racial  abilities  and  employed  whenever  large

numbers of troops are needed for guard duty or protection.

On rare occasions, a warrior rises in the hierarchy to occupy

a position of prestige. For the vast majority of these individu-

als, life is shortusually sacri ced in battle for the greater

glory of the race.

FAVORED CONSORT

Drow priestesses select consorts as lovers and mates. These

males are breeders, serving to perpetuate the line and little

more. Some priestesses indulge them, listening to their advice

or opinions, but in most cases, a cleric uses a consort until

she tires of him, at which point he is discarded.

Although a consort has the favor of his priestess, it is his

duty to protect her, even at the cost of his own life. He must

be vigilant against assassins and traitors within the household,

going so far as to taste her drinks and meals  rst in case they

have been poisoned.

The  sample  favored  consort  presented  here  possesses  a

cloak of the consort (see page 103), which means he is likely a

member of an important drow house and attached to a sig-

ni cant matriarch.

addition, they take a 1 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saves, and checks when in bright light.

Hunters Dedication (Ex) A drow slaver adds a +2 bonus on

Will saves made to resist the special attacks or spells of

his mark.

Tenacious Pursuit (Ex) A drow slaver gains a +4 bonus on

Constitution checks to resist nonlethal damage from a

forced march. When tracking a mark, his speed increases

by 10 feet up to a maximum of the marks speed.

Bring em Back Alive (Ex) Any attack that would reduce a foe

to 2 or fewer hit points reduces the foe to 1 hit point

instead. A drow slaver must choose to use this ability

upon reducing his foe to 2 hit points or fewer, and

before taking any other action.

Mark (Ex) A drow slaver can mark any humanoid or monstrous

humanoid by focusing on the target or a depiction of the

target for 10 minutes. He then gains a +3 bonus on Gather

Information, Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks

made to determine the marks whereabouts. A drow slaver

can have up to two marks at a time.

Nonlethal Force (Ex) A drow slaver can use a melee

weapon that ordinarily deals lethal damage to deal

nonlethal damage without the customary 4 penalty on

his attack roll.

Ready and Waiting (Ex) At any time in a round, a drow slaver

can ready an action against his mark. If at any time within

10 minutes after readying the action, the mark triggers the

action, the drow slaver can carry out the action as if the

two were already engaged in combat. If the drow slaver is

unable to carry out the action, the readied action is lost.

Move Like the Wind (Ex) A drow slaver does not take a 5

penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving

at any speed up to his normal speed, and takes only a 10

penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when running.

House captain

HOUSE CAPTAIN

House  captains  command  the  slaves  and  dark  elves  that

make up the personal army of the house matriarch. Trained

in strategy and tactics, captains put the combatants to good

use on the battle eld. When not warring with a rival house

or an external threat, they are nominally in charge of their

houses security. Typically, a house captain is the  rst son (or

the favored son) of the matriarch.

HOUSE WIZARD

Though they rank lower than clerics, drow wizards and their

ilk are important to the survival of dark elf society. Their inge-

nuity and magical talent make possible many of the luxuries

found in the cities. It is tradition for a matriarch to send her

second or third son to study magic. The apprentice returns

home only after he has learned enough to lend his power to

the defense of the house and to ful ll his mothers wishes.

Many house wizards, such as the sample NPC below, study

to become warmages. However, the eldest among them are

more  likely  to  be  wizards  or  specialist  wizards,  preferring

versatility  to  the  raw  destruction  wielded  by  the  younger

upstarts.

SPIDER SENTINEL

In times of peace, drow mounted on monstrous spider steeds

protect the tunnels around their cities. These dark elves,

known as spider sentinels, swiftly eliminate spies and out-

landers. When their cities muster for war, spider sentinels

reinforce other units of drow, lending their strength (and

that of their mounts) to defend their people.

Drow Adventures

This section details several drow encounters and adventure

sites. You can use them as individual events in your game or

link them to form the core building blocks of a larger drow

campaign.

DROW AMBUSH (EL 14)

SETUP

This ambush can take place in any of the tunnels that riddle

the Borderlands around the Vault of the Drow. Here in these

half-wild areas, renegade drowoutcasts and rebelswork

as bandits, avoiding the infrequent drow patrols and looking

for easy marks to waylay.

One of the most infamous bandits is a cavestalker named

Gaelimor Zyrshaen. This drow male has long chafed under the

matriarchal leash of Erelhei-Cinlu and has made it his mission

to obtain that power and freedom for himself, preferably at his

matrons expense. To this end, he uses his cavestalker skills

to locate and rob likely victims and then disappear far into

the Wilds, where even the drow fear to follow him. Rumors

of a secret hideout where an army of drow rebels prepares to

invade the Vault have yet to be proven but are rampant in the

back alleys of Erelhei-Cinlu.

In this encounter, you can have Gaelimor try to rob the

PCs of their valuables; he is often merciful, sparing the lives

of non-drow and of drow who are not closely connected with

the houses or the Fane of Lolth. Alternatively, you can have

him approach the PCs from a position of strength to offer an

alliance, an exchange of favors, or perhaps a job for which they

seem especially suited. Whatever the outcome, if Gaelimor

survives the encounter, he can become a long-running foil

or ally for your drow campaign.

Set up the encounter as the PCs move through the tunnels.

Gaelimor  notices  them  and  starts  tracking  them  surrepti-

tiously.  Allow  the  members  of  the  party  to  make  Spot  and

Listen checks opposed by Gaelimors Hide and Move Silently

checks. He does not follow them too closely, so include the

penalties for distance.

Meanwhile, some of his fellow bandits set up the ambush,

for  whatever  reason  you  decideGaelimor  might  want  to

retain the PCs services, form a temporary alliance, or just rob

them blind. His gang includes his erratic lieutenant Keveras

Lorakythe, two arcane guards who stole from their house and

 ed to escape punishment, and three greater quaggoths who

serve Gaelimors ally, the quaggoth warleader Grommtt.

2 Drow Arcane Guards

CR 5

hp 19 each; see page 184; each guard also wears a spider kit

(page 92)

These guards cling to perches 20 feet high on the sides of sta-

lagmites, using spider kits to keep their hands free. They have

poisoned crossbow bolts readied to  re at Gaelimors signal

or at aggressive acts by the PCs. Cloaked in total darkness,

the guards use the Hide skill to remain unseen. Unless the

party makes successful Spot checks for areas at that height,

the  guards  probably  remain  unnoticed  until  they  attack.

Before  descending  to  engage  in  melee,  each  guard  drinks

a potion of haste and a potion of cats grace, and uses his wizard

spells and his faerie  re spell-like ability. The guards prefer to

target spellcasters and rogues with their spells and poisoned

crossbow bolts.

3 Greater Quaggoths

hp 79 each; see page 138

CR 6

These barbarians are meant to bear the brunt of any  ghting

that becomes necessary. They try to hide in the shadows at the

base of a large stalagmite, but they can be spotted with an suc-

cessful Spot check opposed by their Hide checks. The greater

quaggoths stand with their +1 greatclubs drawn, but they do not

attack unless they are attacked by the PCs or unless the drow

attack the party. In either event, the barbarians immediately

rage and charge into battle, targeting the PCs who most look

like formidable  ghters. Sent by their warleader to serve Gae-

limor, they  ght to the death to defend the drow.

The outcome of this ambush is up to you and the PCs. It might

simply serve as an introduction to the dangers of dealing with

drow, or it could establish Gaelimor as a tenuous ally or a bitter

rival who can return in a future adventure.

To trigger this encounter, read:

The tunnel ahead widens momentarily. Standing nonchalantly in

the center of this wide spot is a drow male with his arms folded across

his chest, conspicuously away from the spiked chain and short sword

hanging from his belt. His face betrays a ghost of a smile, as if he knows

something you dont, or perhaps simply because he is supremely con -

dent. You dont  nd either option particularly comforting. However,

his stance suggests that hed rather talk than  ght.

The natural stone in this area is rough and dry, and the walls

and stalagmites can be ascended or descended with a success-

ful DC 20 Climb check. The major stalagmites shown on the

map reach a height of 30 feet. The walls rise upward for 40 feet

before  curving  in  toward  the  stone  ceiling,  which  features

only a few small stalactites.

The northwestern section of the map is a maze of stalag-

mite formations. It is considered a narrow space (see Cramped

Spaces, page 159), so those who move through that section

move at half speed, lose their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class

(if  any),  take  a  2  penalty  on  attack  rolls  made  with  light

weapons,  and  take  a  4  penalty  on  attack  rolls  made  with

one-handed weapons. Two-handed weapons cannot be used

in the stalagmite- lled area.

Gaelimor Zyrshaen

hp 62; see page 71

CR 12

Gaelimors reaction depends on his purpose in tracking the

PCs and on the partys response. When the adventurers reach

the  point  on  the  map  marked  PCs,  Gaelimor  calls  out  in

Undercommon for them to stop, knowing that they are in the

line of sight of his arcane guards. If the PCs notice the guards,

Gaelimor shrugs it off, saying that precautions are necessary

in these parts. He then attempts to parlay.

If the PCs attack the drow or refuse to stop, or if Gaelimor

intended to attack them all along, he quickly retreats into the

tangle  of  stalagmites  to  the  northwest,  drawing  his  spiked

chain as he moves. He  ghts when within that narrow space,

relying on his expert spelunker ability to offset the penalties

imposed. If the battle looks hopeless, Gaelimor retreats.

Keveras Lorakythe

hp 41; see page 161

CR 10

Keveras is Gaelimors principal aide. He sits on a ledge 5 feet

above the  oor, using a large stalagmite for cover and con-

cealment from the party. At Gaelimors signal, or if he sees

Gaelimor retreat, Keveras uses the Tumble skill to leap from

his hiding place and then engages the toughest-looking PCs

with his spiked chain. He uses Tumble and his feats to remain

out of the adventurers reach and to harass them. If Keveras

thinks his life is endangered, he retreats from the battle, aban-

doning his comrades.

MENAGERIE SQUARE

Anyone visiting Erelhei-Cinlu eventually  nds his way (often

against  his  will)  to  Menagerie  Square,  located  in  the  heart

of the Ghetto of Chattel. Not so much a single building as

numerous interconnected galleries, tents, huts, and domes,, the

square takes up an entire city block. It is the site of perhaps the

largest ongoing slave auction above or below ground, run by an

ancient drow known as the Venerable Fleshpeddler. The auc-

tion is also notorious for its exotic variety of merchandise.

This encounter occurs in a covered portico in Menagerie

Square, where the PCs happen to be conducting business of

some kind. At the same time, a delegation of kuo-toas led by

an important whip priestess is being shown a private selection

of slaves for purchase. When the whip spies the party, she tries

to buy one of them instead. The servants of the Fleshpeddler,

eager to please their client and turn a pro t, try to apprehend

the chosen character. When they fail, the servants of the kuo-

toa whip also try to subdue the recalcitrant slave-to-be.

1. AUCTION FLOOR (EL 11 OR 12)

The  encounter  begins  when  the  party  enters  area  1 on  the

map. A private slave auction is currently underway here for

Slroolishdop,  the  visiting  noble  kuo-toa  whip.  She  comes

from the same  ngerling brood as the kuo-toa priest-prince

Va-Guugh,  and  therefore  she  is  treated  as  a  favored  cousin

of the prince. The Venerable Fleshpeddler set up the special

meeting through some of his bugbear overseers, who are run-

ning the auction.

While  the  PCs  complete  their  personal  business  in  area

2, the clerk they are dealing with motions them into area 1,

where he has left an item he needs. Slroolishdop is seated in

the northernmost chair on the southeastern section of the wall,

her four kuo-toa monitors arrayed around her protectively. She

watches as two bugbears tout the merits of six slaves who are

chained to a central dais. When Slroolishdop happens to spy

the PCs, she decides that one of them would make a perfect

slave. When this occurs, the clerk that the PCs are dealing

with quickly sidles out of the way and disappears. The bugbear

overseers move in to capture the marked character.

To trigger this encounter, read:

As you step through the arch into the high-domed chamber, you see

that a slave auction is in progress. It appears to be a private auction

for very important guestsa group of kuo-toas gathered on the far

side of the room. Chained to a marble auction block by wrist and

ankle fetters are six nearly nude slaves: a male drow, two female

drow, a male deep gnome, and two female hobgoblins. Two bugbears

wearing off-white robes and wielding guisarmes display the slaves

for their guests.

As you watch, one of the kuo-toas, seated among the others and

resplendent  in  a  colorful  headdress,  points  your  way  and  croaks

something to those around her.

95726720_Ch06.indd   175

2/22/07   3:34:17 PM

Anyone who knows Undercommon and who makes a success-

ful DC 10 Listen check realizes that the kuo-toa said, Ill take

that one. Any PCs who understand her words have a surprise

round in which to act before the bugbear overseers move in.

The marble dais is 1 foot high and does not cause much

of an impediment, but anyone moving across it must make

a successful DC 8 Balance check to avoid getting tangled in

the chains. Anyone who gets tangled can free himself only

with a move action. Anyone who fails the Balance check by

5 or more is tripped.

The six slaves are unexceptional specimens of their races;

each has one level in the NPC class of your choice. They do

not involve themselves in the melee, but if freed from their

chains, they immediately attempt to  ee Menagerie Square.

Each bugbear overseer has a key to the fetters, which are mas-

terwork manacles secured by bolts to the dais.

Masterwork Manacles: hardness 10; hp 10; break DC 28;

Open Lock DC 25.

2 Bugbear Overseers

hp 37 each; see page 121

CR 8

Once Slroolishdop chooses a PC as her slave, the overseers

split  up  and  approach  the  party  from  opposite  sides  of  the

dais. One blows a signal whistle to summon the stone giant

Gristle from area 3. The other casts ray of enfeeblement at the

PC in question. Then both use their +1 guisarmes to make trip

attacks to subdue that character, though they do not hesitate

to use deadly force on other party members. These overseers

do not retreat, counting on Gristle to back them up.

4 Kuo-Toa Monitors

hp 38 each; see page 132

CR 7

When melee begins, the kuo-toa monitors (all unarmed monks)

stand by silently, giving cover to Slroolishdop and protecting

her from any threats. If she is attacked, or if the PCs are on

the verge of defeating the bugbears and Gristle, the monitors

launch into action. They try to keep the chosen character alive

while incapacitating or killing the rest of the party.

Slroolishdop

Female kuo-toa whip

hp 40; see page 131

CR 9

At  rst, Slroolishdop sits passively and watches the capture

of  her  selected  slave.  However,  if  her  monitors  engage  in

melee, she calls in her native language for aid from another

whip that is currently in area 3, and then uses her punish the

in dels ability to subject the PCs to the effect of a doom spell.

The other kuo-toa whip arrives 1 round after being called, at

which  time  both  whips  begin  assisting  the  monitors  with

spells and lightning bolts. If the opportunity presents itself,

Slroolishdop sends the other whip to capture the selected PC

with her pincer staff.

Slroolishdop carries a large sack made of stitched goblinoid

hide that holds 1,500 pp, which she brought to pay for her

slave purchases.

The overseers and Gristle  ght to the death out of fear of repri-

sal from the Venerable Fleshpeddler. The kuo-toas also  ght

to the death except for Slroolishdop, who quietly surrenders

if all her underlings are defeated.

Shortly after the combat ends, a number of drow arcane

guards (see page 184) arrive to take charge of the situation.

Rather than attack the party, they try to escort Slroolishdop

back to the kuo-toan embassy. Of course, if the PCs choose to

 ght, the arcane guards are happy to oblige them.

2. PURSERS OFFICE

The PCs begin the encounter in this area, where a clerk is

helping them conduct whatever business has brought them

to Menagerie Square. The of ce holds the records of all recent

slave transactions. A secret panel in the  oor (which can be

found with a successful DC 40 Search check) hides a small

compartment that contains 5,600 gp in coins and gems. Noth-

ing else about the of ce is relevant to the overall encounter.

3. HOLDING CELLS (EL 10)

Use this encounter if the PCs enter area 3 on the map. Here, a

number of cells contain slaves who are waiting to be shown at

the auction in area 1. Currently, the cells hold a dozen slaves of

assorted races and genders. When the encounter begins, the

slave tender, Gristle, is preparing the next group of slaves for

display while the second kuo-toa whip observes him. Both are

drawn into the encounter as explained in area 1, above.

4. COCOON STORAGE

Use this encounter if the PCs enter area 4 on the map. This

locked room (accessible with a successful DC 25 Open Lock

check) holds special slaves who have been paralyzed with poi-

sons and wrapped in protective spider silk cocoons for storage.

You can put any slaves you wish in here. Otherwise, the storage

room holds nothing relevant to the overall encounter.

5. PRIVATE CHAMBERS

Use this encounter if the PCs enter area 5 on the map. These

rooms serve as meeting, storage, and private chambers for the

staff of Menagerie Square. They contain nothing relevant to

the overall encounter.

PHAZEUROTHS LAIR

Located  in  an  out-of-the-way  cavern  several  miles  west  of

the Vault of the Drow is the former lair of Vatirian, a reclu-

sive deep dragon who had long been allied with the drow of

Erelhei-Cinlu. A century ago, the creature met his end in a

cave-in. The lair stood abandoned and undiscovered until a

few months ago, when it was found and claimed by Vatirians

grandson, the adult deep dragon Phazeuroth. Ever since, he

has spied on the Vault, plotting how best to pro t from an alli-

ance with the dark elves of Erelhei-Cinlu. However, he was

recently approached by a delegation of strange drow who did

not come from the city, and they told Phazeuroth of the true

treasure contained within his grandsires lair.

To reach the lair, a visitor must climb a perilous rock slide

by  making  a  successful  DC 15  Balance  check.  Those  who

fail the check fall 1d610 feet, taking 1d6 points of damage

per 10 feet fallen. Those who succeed soon come upon the

lairs  small  entrance.  Creatures  of  Large  size  must  squeeze

to  t through the entrance, and bigger creatures cannot pass

through it at all.

The lair is unlit, and all descriptions below assume that the

PCs have a light source or at least darkvision. If they do not,

modify the descriptions as needed.

1. ENTRANCE (EL 11)

This encounter occurs when the party reaches area 1 on the

map. A low crawl tunnel opens into a wider, unlit cavern. Here,

Phazeuroth has repaired a trap left behind by his grandsire to

guard against incursions by kuo-toas and other foes.

Phazeuroth  always  enters  his  lair  in  humanoid  form.  A

successful DC 10 Search check in the dust and muck of the

 oor  reveals  several  sets  of  humanoid  footprints  coming

and going. They exit to the southeast and the southwest, but

where the ground  rms and dries up, they taper off after only

a few feet.

For a long time, this room has been exposed to a small lode of

darklight ore (see page 154). Too weak to harm anyone, the mild

ore is strong enough to have caused the growth of  ve violet

fungi, as depicted by the  ve largest mushrooms on the map. The

smaller mushrooms represent harmless immature fungi.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Scrabbling through the dust and muck at the entrance to this cave,

you are  nally able to stand up in a dark cavern. Tall mushrooms

surmounting  densely  packed  bases  of  rootlike  tendrils  occupy  the

perimeter  of  the  chamber.  Tunnels  exit  to  the  southeast  and  the

southwest.

On the map, the three squares marked T show the location of

a carefully concealed pit trap. The trap drops 50 feet to a pile

of jagged, broken stalagmites that have been coated with violet

fungus poison. The fungi in the entrance area are instinctively

aware of the trap and avoid it.

If the trap is triggered, the noise alerts Phazeuroth, who is

resting in area 2 and taking 10 on his Listen check.

The violet fungi in the lair have grown used to Phazeuroth,

who  has  proven  largely  immune  to  their  attacks,  and  they

ignore the deep dragons presence. If chasing intruders, the

fungi do not pursue beyond this area.

2. DRAGONS DEN (EL 14)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 2 on the map.

This den is where Phazeuroth spends most of his time, and he

prefers to rest in dragon form in the large central area. How-

ever, if he hears intruders in area 1 or area 3, he moves into the

northern portion of the den and readies his breath weapon.

Spaced around his den are  ve violet fungi, as depicted on

the map by the  ve largest mushrooms. The smaller mush-

rooms represent harmless immature fungi.

The openings at the edges of the map to the north, east, and

south end in natural walls of rough stone after only a few feet.

The southern portion of the cave holds Phazeuroths treasure

hoard, which consists of 2,300 pp; 10,800 gp; 22,650 sp; 48,000

cp; assorted gems worth 12,500 gp; three pairs of cinnabar eye

cusps; two dwarfblind stones; two matching +1 virulent dag-

gers; a major cloak of displacement; a chaos diamond; a manual of

bodily health +3; and a demon rod.

To trigger this encounter, read:

The  tunnel  opens  into  an  echoing  cavern  that  has  a  stalactite-

encrusted ceiling at least 60 feet above, supported in places by natural

stone columns. Several clumps of giant fungus grow here and there,

and the entire area has a musty, reptilian odor mixed with an acrid

tang. To the south, gold glints beyond a natural arch.

When attacking intruders, he does not care if violet fungi are

destroyed in the process.

The  violet  fungi  will  not  leave  the  den.  The  southernmost

fungus remains in the shadows by the treasure hoard, feast-

ing  on  cave  lichen,  and  does  not  attack  unless  an  intruder

approaches.

3. EXCAVATED CAVERN (EL 8 OR 11)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 3 on the map.

This cavern was the site of the collapse that killed Vatirian,

the grandsire of Phazeuroth. It has been painstakingly exca-

vated over the last few weeks by the deep dragon and some

of his guests. The crumbling, 10-foot-high ceiling is held up

by a forest of steel poles situated along the walls of the room.

Though  the  ceiling  appears  unstable,  occasionally  raining

down dust and grit, it has been stabilized and is in no danger

of further collapse.

The opening to the south once led to a long, low-ceilinged

cave, but now only the portion visible on the map is open.

The rest is  lled with rubble excavated from the collapse of

this room. Bones among the debris are the crushed remnants

of Vatirian, which Phazeurothwho is not overly sentimen-

taldid not bother to clean up. Moving through the debris is

equal to moving through light rubble, increasing the DC for

Balance and Tumble checks by 2.

Three violet fungi inhabit this cavern, as depicted on the

map by the three largest mushrooms. The smaller mushrooms

represent harmless immature fungi.

One round after the PCs enter this room, three szarkai  ght-

ers enter from area 4. As soon as they see the PCs, they attack,

assuming that the adventurers work for the drow of Erelhei-

Cinlu. The szarkai try to  ank PCs against the caverns violet

fungi and risk straying within reach of the fungi themselves,

trusting in their heavy armor to keep them safe.

If the sounds of battle are magically silenced, the szarkai

druid  in  area  5  hears  the  noise  and  arrives  in  3  rounds  to

investigate.

178

95726720_Ch06.indd   178

2/22/07   3:34:29 PM

To trigger this encounter, read:

The low-fractured ceiling looks ominously unstable, and it clearly

collapsed at some point in the past. The  oor is covered with bits of

rubble and a layer of dust disturbed by the passage of many feet. Steel

poles anchored into the  oor and walls seem to hold the ceiling in

place. Scattered among the rubble on the  oor are a number of large

white bones that seem to have been fractured or crushed. Part of a

large draconic skull rests in one corner.

The szarkai in Phazeuroths lair have recently allied with the

deep dragon. They belong to a tribe of albino drow that lives

several weeks journey from Erelhei-Cinlu. The members of

this  tribe  call  themselves  Ul-Ilendeth,  which  means  drow

of destiny in Elven, and they believe that they are destined

to rule all drow one day. For centuries, they have kept their

existence a secret from other Underdark races by living in the

most hostile environments possible, often near darklight ore

lodes. They take precautions to shield themselves from dark-

light ore poisoning, but generations of mild exposure have

caused the Ul-Ilendeth to mutate. As a result, all Ul-Ilendeth

appear emaciated and frail, despite their  erce strength, and are

sometimes mistaken for undead upon  rst glance. They also

have low Constitution scores, making them prone to the many

diseases and toxins of the Underdark. Due to this in rmity,

the Ul-Ilendeth are fanatical fatalists and fear nothing.

3 Violet Fungi

hp 15 each; see above

CR 3

The violet fungi will not leave the cavern. They usually ignore

the szarkai, having become used to the presence of the albino

drow. However, if combat starts, the fungi grow agitated and

 ail at anything that comes within reach.

4. MINE FACE

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 4 on the map. This

area extends as a 20-foot-wide tunnel for 80 feet off the map to

the west before hitting a dead end. When Vatirian originally

claimed the lair, it included a mine that had been excavated by

drow in search of darklight ore lodes, many generations ago.

The location of the mine was lost to the current residents of

Erelhei-Cinlu, its presence forgotten. Vatirian remembered,

though, and the deep dragon was trying to reopen the mine

and  extend  the  excavations  when  he  triggered  the  cave-in

that killed him.

The dark elves of Erelhei-Cinlu still know nothing about

the ancient mine, but the Ul-Ilendeth somehow learned of its

existence, and that is the reason they now seek an alliance with

Phazeuroth. The szarkai have depleted the stores of darklight

ore in their homeland and followed divinations to the lair,

hoping to reopen the old mine and dig out its ore. They have

bribed Phazeuroth heavily, and because the deep dragon cares

nothing for the metal that lies beyond the collapsed tunnel, he

agreed to let them take as much as they want. The Ul-Ilendeth

have only recently  nished clearing away enough debris to

gain access to the mine.

To trigger this encounter, read:

At the far end of this recently cleared tunnel is a wall of stone, the mine

face where digging ceased. The stone of this wall is different from other

stone in the caves. It has a rough, lumpy texture as if it contained

tumors, and the bulges  icker with a dim purple glow. Three mining

picks lie on the  oor in front of the wall, and a wheeled metal hand

cart holds a chest loaded with chunks of the strange stone.

The darklight lode causes darklight poisoning (Fort DC 18, 1d6

Con/mummy rot) in anyone who comes within 60 feet of the

lode without proper shielding. For more details on darklight

poisoning, see the sidebar Underdark Radiations, page 154.

The chest can hold up to 8 cubic feet of stone and is made

of 2-inch-thick lead. It seals when closed and can be used to

move the darklight ore safely. The chest is extremely heavy,

weighing 300 pounds when empty and 700 pounds when full,

but the wheeled metal hand cart is strong enough to move it.

The cart is just small enough to squeeze through the entrance

to Phazeuroths lair.

5. TEMPORARY QUARTERS (EL 10)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 5 on the map.

This side cavern serves as the campsite for the Ul-Ilendeth

while they visit the lair. It is currently inhabited only by the

Ul-Ilendeth leader, a szarkai druid, and two violet fungi that

he controls through the use of a command plants spell (already

in effect).

Light Blindness (Ex) Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as

addition, they take a 1 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saves, and checks when in bright light.

The north wall that appears to be open on the map actually

ends at a wall of natural stone after only 1 foot.

To trigger this encounter, read:

This side cavern seems to serve as a campsite. Four bedrolls made

of scaly black hide are spread out on the  oor, with backpacks and

various odds and ends strewn among them. Two large fungi stand

over the bedrolls like guardians. A few small pools of water collect

from the drips of stalactites above.

The bedrolls are made of dyed lizard hide. The backpacks hold

barely edible foodstuffs and a few personal effects of crude

drow construction, but one backpack also contains 75 pp and

two vials of darklight brew poison (see page 94).

If the PCs have not already encountered the three szarkai

 ghters,  they  remain  in  area  4,  excavating  stone  from  the

mine. If combat breaks out in the campsite, the  ghters hear

the noise and arrive in 5 rounds to investigate.

When  the  druid  detects  intruders,  he  orders  the  fungi  to

attack and uses levitate to hover near the 20-foot-high ceiling.

From that vantage point, he drinks a potion of blur and casts

stoneskin, barkskin, lesser vigor, and magic stone, in that order.

He then engages the PCs with quill re, sudden stalagmite, arc

of lightning, and blinding spittle. He uses resist energy and warp

wood to protect himself from spellcasters and archers, and if

defeat appears imminent, he tries to escape by using meld into

stone or his wild shape ability.

3 Violet Fungi

hp 15 each; see above

CR 3

The violet fungi follow the commands of the druid.

HOUSE XANIQOS VILLA

The new noble House Xaniqos maintains a villa in the center

of the Ghetto of Outcasts. From here, Lady Thandysha spins

her plans for the ghetto.

1. CHAPEL OF LOLTH (EL 14)

This  encounter  occurs  when  the  PCs  are  visiting  the  villa

of  House  Xaniqos,  meeting  with  Lady  Thandysha  and  her

personal guards for whatever reason has brought them to Erel-

hei-Cinluperhaps the completion of a mission or the sale of

valuable information. During the meeting, opportunistic rivals

move to eliminate the upstart house and its matron, and the

villa comes under attack by the surrounding forces. (You can

establish the identity and motivation of the rivals according

to what best  ts your campaign.) The PCs must  nd a way to

escape from the embattled villa as they get their  rst genuine

taste of drow politics.

The meeting room is situated at the center of the villa and

serves as a chapel to Lolth. A large black marble altar bearing

old bloodstains stands on a dais. At the north end of the room

is an idol depicting the Spider Queen. Across the room to the

south is a font of unholy water (enough to  ll twenty  asks).

The font gives off a moderate aura of conjuration if detect magic

is used. If at least 1 hit point worth of blood is placed in the

font,  it  and  the  entire  southern  wall  become  insubstantial,

forming  a  dimension  door  that  remains  open  for  1 minute.

Anyone stepping through is transported to an alley a block

away, outside the circle of the attacking forces. The font is the

characters most likely escape route if they can uncover the

secret of its use.

If the party successfully escapes from the villa, this encoun-

ter is  nished (unless the PCs willingly engage the attacking

forces, a futile gesture at best). You can decide whether House

Xaniqos survives the attack or falls and is replaced by another

upstart house.

2/22/07   3:34:32 PM

To trigger this encounter, read:

Your audience with the Lady Thandysha, Matron of House Xaniqos,

has come to an end. Her expression remains inscrutable, as if she is

deep in thought. Suddenly, the moment is interrupted by a dull thud

that seems to shake the foundations of the villa. Before anyone can

react, a bugbear with smoldering fur runs into the room, shouting,

Were under attack!

In a  urry, the room begins to empty of the congregated drow and

warriors of other races. Lady Thandysha starts barking orders for

the defense of the villa. As she departs to the south, she issues a  nal

command to two heavily armed drow who remain in the chapel.

These  people  are  obviously  spies.  Kill  them  and  then  join  me  at

the front gate.

The warriors Thandysha has left behind are two dread fangs of

Lolth who serve her fanatically. They block the way between

the party and the matron. Even if the PCs get past the dread

fangs,  they  are  unlikely  to  catch  up  with  Lady  Thandysha

because immediately after leaving the room, she thinks better

of checking on the front gate and instead uses word of recall

to return to her estate. If the party manages to confront her

somehow, her statistics appear on page 162.

2. ART GALLERY

Use this encounter when the PCs reach the area labeled 2 on

the map. This room displays a small collection of artwork. The

west and east alcoves each hold an illusory sculpture, created

by Xaniqos artisans, combining permanent image and persistent

image.  The  two  sculptures  can  be  dispelled  by  a  successful

check  against  caster  level  15th.  Between  them  on  a  stand

is an antique kuo-toan vase over 1,000 years old. The vase is

extremely fragile but is worth 2,500 gp if it can be successfully

transported out of the villa.

The illusory sculpture in the west alcove depicts a beautiful

female drow performing a graceful and exotic dance. Her sil-

very hair, bound in hundreds of braids,  ails about her wildly.

A moment later, the image shifts, and the female transforms

into a drider, mouthing a silent scream of rage and pain as she

disembowels herself with a spider-shaped ritual dagger. After

another minute, the image shifts back to its original form. The

sculpture changes back and forth in an endless loop.

The illusory sculpture in the east alcove depicts a tall drow

female wearing a white toga. Her head has been shaved bald,

and she seems to be giving a speech, gesturing with her arms

and hands while her lips move. She makes no sound, but if a

viewer speaks Elven, he can attempt a DC 15 Spot check to

read the images lips and determine that she is extolling the

blessed vices of Lolth. Anyone who makes a successful DC 25

Spot check notices that the speakers seemingly innocuous

hand  gestures  are  subtly  forming  symbols.  A  viewer  who

notices this and who can understand Drow Sign Language

open portal. This statement is a clue to the use of the dimen-

sion door in area 1.

3. MAIN ENTRANCE (EL 11)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 3 on the map. The

main entrance to the villa is blocked by large mithral gates

held shut with a mithral crossbar. The forces outside the villa

are massed just beyond, hammering away at the gates with

all the spells and brute force at their disposal. As a result, the

gates are starting to dent and buckle. Anyone who removes

the  crossbar  is  immediately  overwhelmed  by  hundreds  of

attackers, including a high priestess of Lolth (see page 167), a

master wizard of Erelhei-Cinlu (use the statistics for Anybys

Velifane,  page 160),  dozens  of  arcane  guards  (see  page 184)

and troll  lth-eaters, three score regular drow warriors (see

page 169), and over a hundred bugbears.

Defending the gates are ten drow warriors who are part of

Lady Thandyshas detachment and a troll  lth-eater recently

recruited from the surrounding ghetto. They have wedged

heavy stone beams against the gates to reinforce them, but

the beams are beginning to crack. It is only a matter of time

until the gates burst open and the villa is lost. However, that

will not happen unless the PCs are foolish enough to open

the gates, or until you decide that enough time has passed.

Just be sure to give the PCs ample time to make their escape

before you allow the gates to fall.

Before the party enters this chamber, any PC who makes

a successful DC 5 Listen check can hear the sounds of ham-

mering on the mithral gates.

To trigger this encounter, read:

The hammering of powerful spells and mighty blows ring against

the silvery metal of the double gates in the rooms south wall. The

gates are warped and bent, riddled with protrusions caused by the

phenomenal concussions. The noise in this chamber is almost over-

powering. Heavy stone beams have been propped against the gates,

but even these reinforcements are beginning to crack.

Damaged Mithral Gates, Barred and Braced: hardness

10 Drow Warriors

hp 4 each; see page 169

CR 1

These warriors were tasked to defend the main gates to the

death, and they fear reprisal from Lady Thandysha more than

they  fear  the  invaders.  The  drow  do  not  realize  that  their

matriarch has already  ed the villa.

Troll Filth-Eater

hp 174; see page 146

CR 11

This troll is not overly bright, but it realizes that it receives a

larger food allotment when it follows the orders of the drow.

It immediately rages when the PCs enter the room and will

pursue them with a mindless fury wherever they go in the

villa (and beyond, if possible).

4. ARMORY (EL 8)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 4 on the map.

The armory still holds a few weapons and suits of armor that

the villas defenders did not have time to don before rushing

to respond to the attack.

The opening in the west wall shown on the map is merely

a shallow alcove holding half-empty weapon racks.

The house wizard in the tower above left his shield guard-

ian to defend the armory.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Armor stands are spaced around the periphery of this chamber. Most

are empty, but four still hold suits of ornate armor of drow make. An

alcove in the west wall contains half-empty weapon racks that offer

a handful of viciously serrated and barbed blades and spears. The

door of iron bars that normally blocks access to these weapons hangs

open, its chains smashed.

Three of the four suits of armor are black masterwork studded

leather. The fourth suit is +2 drowcraft chainmail (see Underdark

Radiations, page 154).

The weapon racks hold four longswords, two spears, and

a hand crossbow, all mundane. However, the PCs also  nd

a +1 light  burst  spear  (see  the  light  burst  weapon  property,

page 95).

Shield Guardian

hp 112; see MM 223

CR 8

The house wizard left the shield guardian with orders to attack

anyone who enters the armory but does not bear the jet cross-

bow bolt insignia of House Xaniqos. However, the guardian

was also ordered to defend the villas gates. Thus, if the main

gates at area 3 are breached, the shield guardian goes to that

location and attacks anyone it  nds there who does not bear

the insignia.

5. TORTURE CHAMBER (EL 14)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 5 on the map. This

room was used to torture prisoners to extract information,

as well as to provide entertainment for the drow. Currently,

the manacles hold no captives, but the room is not empty. A

troll tunnel thug is here, preparing to sneak out of the villa

through the postern gate in area 7 so that it can get behind

the attacking forces and slay their leaders.

The troll is taking 10 on its Listen check. If it hears the PCs

approaching, the creature hides in a dark corner so that it can

make a sneak attack when they enter.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Three pairs of bloody manacles hang from the west wall. They are

currently empty. A small chest sits on a shelf on the south wall, and

The chest is unlocked and contains an assortment of knives,

barbed hooks, and razors. None of the items would make a good

weapon, but they all serve well as torture instruments.

The glowing coals in the iron brazier give off illumination

equal to that of a candle. Anyone touching the coals takes 1d6

points of  re damage per round of contact. The coals can be

thrown as improvised weapons.

The iron pokers can be wielded as clubs. For 3 rounds after

the pokers are removed from the coals, they deal an extra 1d6

points of  re damage per hit. After that time, they cool off

and deal only normal damage. If placed in the coals again,

the pokers reheat in 3 rounds.

Troll Tunnel Thug

hp 111; see page 146

CR 14

The troll tries to use the Tumble skill and its reach to avoid

being cornered and to prevent multiple opponents from get-

ting too close. It maneuvers through the surrounding corridors

and rooms as necessary, trying to hide and make sneak attacks

on the PCs. If allowed time, the troll poisons its weapons and

stalks the party, hoping to make death attacks.

6. BARRACKS (EL 7)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 6 on the map.

This  chamber  serves  as  a  barracks  for  the  guards  that  nor-

mally staff the villa. Currently, the room is inhabited by six

bugbear warriors that were brought from the Xaniqos Estate

with Lady Thandysha. They have guessed correctly that she

has abandoned them, and their morale is broken.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Hammocks woven from strong spider silk are af xed to the walls of

this chamber at various levels, reaching all the way to the ceiling 15

feet above. Numerous footlockers of black stone line the walls.

The footlockers are made of chiseled stone and hold mundane

clothing  and  equipment  belonging  to  the  bugbear  guards.

They are not locked. Hidden inside one footlocker is a large

opal worth 250 gp, but it has been tucked inside a dirty,  ea-

infested sock. A PC can  nd the opal by making a successful

DC 22 Search check.

7. CELLBLOCK AND POSTERN (EL 13)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 7 on the map.

This corridor has two holding cells  anking a larger cell in the

opposite side of the wall to hold prisoners of House Xaniqos

awaiting torture or sacri ce. On the map, the portion of the

west wall at the northernmost end of the corridor that is drawn

as an opening is actually a stone wall with a secret door in

its center. The door is extremely dif cult to detect from the

outside (Search DC 40) and served as an escape route for the

inhabitants of the villa.

The sponsors of the attack on the villa learned of the secret

door. A drow assassin who had just entered through the door

hid in the shadows of the northernmost cell when he heard

the PCs coming. Allow the PCs to make Spot checks opposed

by the assassins Hide check.

To trigger this encounter, read:

This dimly lit corridor travels beside two prison cells. Each cell is

blocked off by a wall of bars with a gate of bars in the center. The gates

to both cells stand open, and the cells appear to be empty.

Iron Bars: hardness 10; 50 hp; break DC 28; Open Lock

DC 20 (currently unlocked; the cells can be locked by pull-

ing the doors shut).

Drow Assassin

hp 53; see page 165

CR 13

The  assassin  has  in ltrated  the  villa  to  assassinate  Lady

Thandysha and any other leaders he can  nd. He assumes that

the PCs are special mercenaries hired by Xaniqos and tries

to observe them long enough to identify the party leader and

make a death attack at the  rst opportunity. If the assassin

succeeds, he does not stick around to engage the rest of the

party, preferring to sneak away and search the villa for more

important targets.

8. KITCHEN

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 8 on the map.

The villas kitchen is currently unoccupied.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Tables and benches cluttered with earthenware and utensils crowd

this room. A stone oven stands against the north wall. A kettle hangs

nearby, coated with fuzzy green paste.

The bugbears are demoralized and want only one thingto

leave  the  villa  alive.  If  the  PCs  attack,  the  guards  defend

themselves  ferociously  until  they  can  break  through  their

opponents  and   ee.  If  this  occurs,  the  PCs  might  face  the

bugbears again later, since the creatures continue to explore

the besieged villa, looking for a way out.

If  the  PCs  do  not  attack  and  instead  use  Diplomacy  or

Intimidate to change the bugbears attitude from unfriendly to

friendly, the guards agree to depart without a  ght and to keep

silent about the partys presence. The bugbears also offer their

collective treasure (totaling 87 gp in small gems and various

coins) as an incentive for the PCs to turn a blind eye.

The bugbear stonejacks use this room to prepare their meals.

All the items and utensils are ordinary. The green substance

in the kettle is nothing more than a fungal stew that was left

out for too long.

9. GUARD TOWER (EL 10)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 9 on the map.

This area is the lower level of a two-story guard tower at the

southeastern  corner  of  the  villa.  The  room  is  occupied  by

two drow arcane guards who came with Lady Thandysha and

three bugbear stonejacks that are part of the villas regular

garrison.

2/22/07   3:34:38 PM

The open area along the southern portion of the east wall

leads to an enclosed staircase that rises 20 feet to the level

above. The upper level is a single room with arrow slits that

face all directions. A dozen embattled drow arcane guards and

a house wizard are  inging spells and crossbow bolts at the

attacking forces massing outside the villa. (The PCs have no

reason to climb the stairs and engage the drow in the upper

level. If they try, feel free to discourage them by describing the

sounds of intense battle issuing from the room above.)

At  the  base  of  the  staircase  lies  the  charred  corpse  of  a

bugbear stonejack, a sentry that was on duty when the attack

began and was blown down the stair by a  reball that traveled

in though an arrow slit.

To trigger this encounter, read:

This dark chamber smells strongly of smoke and burned fur. Screams

of battle echo down a stairway rising in the east wall. The corpse

of a lightly armored goblinoid lies at the base of the stair, charred

to a crisp.

The  arcane  guards  know  that  the  PCs  came  to  the  villa  to

meet with Lady Thandysha, but they also heard her order the

dread fangs to slay them. Thus, the guards assume that the

PCs are spies and try to kill them as quickly as possible. They

use the  rst round of combat to drink their potions of haste

and follow up with their potions of cats grace once the bugbears

have engaged the PCs.

3 Bugbear Stonejacks

hp 39 each; see page 121

CR 5

The  stonejacks  have  not  seen  the  party  before  and  assume

that the PCs are part of the force assaulting the villa. They

follow  the  lead  of  the  drow  arcane  guards  and  attack  the

adventurers.

If the PCs defeat the guards and the bugbears, they  nd them-

selves alone in the lower level of the tower. None of the villas

defenders in the upper level or in nearby rooms respond to the

sounds of battle coming from this chambermainly because

they have their own troubles to worry about.

10. MORGUE (EL 8)

Use this encounter when the PCs reach area 10 on the map.

This  small  storage  chamber  is  used  by  the  masters  of  the

villa  as  a  morgue  for  their  dead.  The  funerary  tradition  of

House Xaniqos is to summon a  endish monstrous spider to

enshroud the dead in webbing, which preserves the bodies

until  they  can  be  transported  back  to  the  caverns  beneath

the Xaniqos estate. There, spiders drain the corpses of  uids

at their leisure, and the husks are animated to serve the house

as zombie slaves.

Currently, the morgue contains the wrapped corpses of  ve

bugbear thralls and a drow assassin from House Vae who failed

in a recent mission to slay Lady Thandysha. The drow corpse

has recently animated as a mohrg. It has been struggling to free

50 ADVENTURE IDEAS

Creating a drow campaign can be a challenge. Half of your job

is coming up with a good reason for the player characters to

interact with the drow at all. Presented below are  fty sample

MAGICAL LOCATIONS

Magical  locations  have  a  rich  history  in  the  fantasy  genre.

The  power  imbued  in  such  special  places  allows  heroes  to

accomplish any number of fantastic deeds, and this tradition

is no less true in the dismal tunnels and deep vaults claimed

by the drow.

Locations  of  power  can  be  used  for  various  purposes  in

a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaign. Some, such as the earth

nodes described in the FORGOTTEN REALMS book Underdark,

might serve as sites for working especially powerful magic.

Others, such as the planar touchstones described in Planar

Handbook, might unlock potential advancement opportuni-

ties or special abilities in characters. Still others, such as the

rune circles described in Races of Stone, could allow PCs to

create permanent magical effects bound to tightly con ned

areas. And  nally, locations such as those found in Dungeon

Masters Guide II are imbued with magical power that is avail-

able for the taking.

PLACING MAGICAL LOCATIONS

As the Dungeon Master, you have the  nal say about where,

when and how magical locations occur in your campaign, just

as you control access to magic items by determining which

ones are for sale in any given city or shop. Because the various

types of magical locations serve different purposes and oper-

ate under different rules, it is perfectly acceptable to feature

more than one kind in the same adventure site. For example,

a drow city could house an earth nodeUnd, a spellward of arcane

mightDMG2, and a blood of the Spider Queen site (described below).

To justify the presence of all three sites, you can decide that

the drow city formed where the earth node and the spilled

blood  already  existed  in  close  proximity,  while  the  spell-

ward  occurred  as  a  result  of  the  many  centuries  of  arcane

activity that have taken place since. You could also separate

the earth node from the blood of the Spider Queen site if you

wish perhaps the earth node hides a colony of svirfneblin

that live near the city.

THE NATURE OF

MAGICAL LOCATIONS

In  general,  a  magical  location  can  be  suppressed  (by  dispel

magic) or disjoined (by Mordenkainens disjunction) as if it were

a magic item containing a spell of caster level 10th with an

object Will save of +15. A magical location is metaphysically

tied to its area, so destroying buildings, walls, or other physi-

cal structures in and around the location does not eliminate

its ability to confer its power.

Unless otherwise noted, no creature can gain the bene t of

a magical locations conferred power more than once. Even if

the power has limited uses or has a  xed duration, a character

cannot regain it by returning to the magical location after the

power expires. Furthermore, once a location has conferred its

ability on a character, it must recharge its power for a speci ed

period of time (generally from one day to one year, depending

on the location) before it can do so again.

However, if the creature on which a magical location has

conferred its ability dies, the location is instantly recharged

and can confer its ability again immediately, no matter how

much recharge time remains. A location that can confer its

ability  on  more  than  one  creature  simultaneously  can  be

renewed early only if all those who currently enjoy the abil-

ity die. If the conferred ability has a duration shorter than the

required recharge period, the creatures death still recharges

the location immediately, even if the creature can no longer

use the ability.

BLOOD OF THE SPIDER QUEEN

Eons ago when Lolth faced Corellon Larethian in open battle,

she was bested and forced to  ee for her life. Wounded and

beaten, she dragged herself through the caverns of the Under-

dark, beyond her enemys sight, until she could reach a portal

to her beloved Demonweb Pits. Trailing her in this exodus

from the world of light were her followers, the drow, who then

established themselves in Underdark caverns to create a new

society below the ground.

During Lolths  ight, she bled her divine essence onto the

stones over which she passed. Locations where this occurred

became known as the blood of the Spider Queen. The dark elves

prize these locations highly, and most ancient drow cities were

founded on or near such sites.

Lore: Characters can gain the following pieces of informa-

tion about a blood of the Spider Queen site by making Knowledge

(dungeoneering),  Knowledge  (history),  or  Knowledge  (reli-

gion) checks at the stated DCs.

DC 10 (religion): The blood of the Spider Queen marks sites

where Lolth dragged her wounded body through the Under-

dark to escape the wrath of Corellon after their epic battle.

DC 15 (dungeoneering, history, or religion): Many of the oldest

drow cities were established around sites where blood of the

Spider Queen was found.

DC 20 (history or religion): A drow priestess who discovers

a blood of the Spider Queen site is considered to be blessed by

Lolth and a leader among drow.

THE GOOD, THE BAD,

AND THE NEUTRAL

In a campaign setting in which the predominant race is not just

evil but actively, purposely, and intrinsically evil, PCs might feel

as if they have only two choices: join the enemy or go down

fighting. But a drow campaign provides many motivations for

different kinds of parties, whether the characters are surface

adventurers, drow, or members of other subterranean races.

The constant infighting among dark elves allows PCs of diverse

backgrounds to infiltrate drow society, and, if they so choose,

to participate regardless of alignment or race.

Of course, a paladin of Heironeous would still be sickened by

the depraved and cruel acts that he witnesses in a drow city, but

he must pick his battles. Single-handedly taking on the whole

city makes for a short and ultimately unfulfilling campaign. For

a  PC  with  a  high  moral  code,  you  must  provide  an  incentive

for holding his tongue and staying his blade. Simple self-pres-

ervation might not be enough for a noble knight prepared to

sacrifice himself for the greater good.

In  general,  good-aligned  PCs,  especially  those  who  have  a

particularly keen moral compass, need a broader picture. An

easy  solution  is  to  present  the  PCs  with  a  bigger  danger  so

fearsome  that  cooperation  with  the  drow  seems  reasonable.

This tactic is a bit heavy-handed, however, and should be used

sparingly.

Instead,  try  offering  the  perspective  of  a  greater  good  that

views  dealing  with  the  drow  as  a  means  to  an  end.  Good-

aligned PCs do not have to take part in drow society, but just as

they do not (or should not) kill every NPC in their town who has

an evil alignment, they will find that trying to clean out a drow

city is a bad idea. Certainly, they can step in when necessary to

prevent a particularly evil act or to defend an innocent victim,

but  that  is  not  the  main  goal  of  their  dealings  with  the  dark

elves. Perhaps they must gain information to complete another

quest, rescue kidnapped loved ones, or simply keep the power

of the drow in check. Savvy PCs can turn one dark elf against

another  to  preventing  them  from  preying  on  anyone  else.  In

any case, good-aligned PCs should feel the tension of battling

their instinct to put an end to the miserable drow, mixed with

the anxiety that the villains might at any moment attack them

in overwhelming numbers. A visit to a drow community should

be  fraught  with  danger  and  moral  dilemmas  but  ultimately

survivable.

Neutral-aligned parties have a much easier time dealing with

drow. The PCs do not necessarily condone the activities of the

dark elves, but as long as those activities do not affect the party

or its interests, they pay little attention. A city full of evil beings

that plot to slaughter one another does not seem like such a

bad  thing.  Races  and  characters  that  conduct  trade  with  the

drow are often neutral. They might not have diplomatic ties with

the dark elves, but they view the drow as a valuable resource

for procuring hard-to-find items, not to mention as a market

for their own wares. A neutral PC sees dealing with the drow as

just business.

On the other hand, neutral PCs are always on their guard for

tricks  and  ambushes.  They  know  that  the  drow  might  try  to

cheat them or simply murder them. Neutral PCs are cautious

and observant around the drow and avoid sticking their noses

where they do not belong for fear that any situation could be a

ruse designed to trap them.

Evil-aligned  PCs  have  the  largest  number  of  possible  mo-

tivations  in  a  drow  campaign.  They  might  be  driven  by  any

motivation stated above, or they might just want to get ahead

in a cutthroat society. Whether enemies or allies of the drow,

evil PCs are not above using the dark elves for their own ends.

A high-level campaign might revolve around a PCs attempt to

gain control of a drow city or just raise his own drow house to

prominence. When scruples are not an issue, the possibilities

for  interaction  with  the  equally  unscrupulous  dark  elves  are

endless.

Evil  PCs  are  typically  in  a  state  of  constant  paranoia.  They

suspect that a thousand possible plots could be afoot mainly

because they have put their own plots in motion. Drow live for

the moment because they know that it might all end in the next

instant on an assassins blade. Evil PCs who deal with the drow

feel much the same way, knowing all too well the perils that

hound their every step.

DC 25 (religion): A drow priestess who discovers a blood of

the Spider Queen site is granted a boon by Lolth and can start

her own noble house as a matriarch.

DC 35 (dungeoneering, history, or religion): A successful check

at this level allows the character to learn or recall a clue to the

location of a speci c blood of the Spider Queen site.

DC 40 (religion): The abilities granted by a blood of the Spider

Queen site work for male and female drow alike, but the priest-

esses carefully guard this secret.

Description: Blood of the Spider Queen is always either a

shallow pool of ichor or a long, sticky smear on a tunnel wall

or  oor. It can be found in any type of Underdark terrain but

is never located on the surface. The ichor is a thick, black,

tarlike substance that gives off a foul odor detectable from

20 feet away. If found in a pool, the ichor is never more than

a few inches deep; if found in a smear, it is never more than

20 feet long. Regardless of the size of the deposit, the ichor

always remains fresh and never dries out.

Unintelligent Underdark creatures instinctively avoid such

sites. Intelligent creatures immediately notice a sinister air

that seems to hang about this foul ef uvia. A drow who has

claimed the power granted by a blood of the Spider Queen site

looks no different, but other dark elves notice that a palpable

aura of Lolths favor surrounds the bene ciary.

Prerequisite: Only a drow follower of Lolth who has at

least  ve cleric levels can gain the power granted by a blood of

the Spider Queen site. The priestesses want everyone to believe

that the recipient must also be female, but it works for males

as wella secret that is extremely well guarded among drow

clergy.

Location Activation: To claim the gift of a blood of the Spider

Queen site, the drow must sacri ce a living, sentient creature

to Lolth at the blessed site and let the blood of the offering

mingle with the divine substance of the deity.

Recharge: Once it has granted its gift to a drow cleric of

Lolth,  a  blood  of  the  Spider  Queen  site  cannot  do  so  again  as

long as that drow lives and remains a faithful follower of the

deity.

Special Ability (Su): A blood of the Spider Queen site grants

the recipient a +5 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Informa-

tion, and Intimidate checks when dealing with other drow.

She also gains a recognizable aura of having been chosen by

Lolth to lead the dark elves. This latter bene t has no game

effect other than to let other drow know that they risk Lolths

wrath by openly defying the recipient. Finally, a blood of the

Spider Queen site grants the recipient the effect of a perma-

nent sanctuary spell against other drow, whether or not they

are followers of Lolth. Any dark elf who wants to attack the

recipient must make a successful DC 22 Will save to follow

through with the attack.

Lolth bestows these particular bene ts to create some sem-

blance of hierarchy for her otherwise chaotic children. The

powers of a blood of the Spider Queen site bring just enough

stability  to  the  drow  to  support  the  noble  houses  and  the

cities. Of course, the gift is a double-edged sword, because

the social structure guarantees constant in ghting among the

dark elves, but Lolth  nds the internecine warfare a source

of great amusement.

Duration:  Any  drow  who  receives  this  blessing  from

Lolth retains it as long as she lives and remains loyal to the

Spider Queen. In rare instances, the gift has endured beyond

death when contingencies were in place to facilitate a quick

transition to an undead state (such as when a drow dies and

becomes a lich).

Aura: Strong transmutation.

Ability Value: 5,000 gp.

CAVESTALKER FORMATION

Many fanciful rock formations add to the mysterious allure of

the caverns of the Underdark. The whimsical shapes seem to

have been carved by a deliberate hand, and these sculptures

of living stone these never fail to inspire awe. In many cases,

they are not natural formations at all, but rather manifesta-

tions of the spirits of intrepid explorers who met their ends

in the environment to which they were so attuned. When an

experienced cavestalker falls prey to one of the many perils

of the Underdark, the site of his death is sometimes imbued

with his knowledge of the stone tunnels, spawning a caves-

talker formation.

Lore:  Characters  can  gain  the  following  pieces  of  infor-

mation about a cavestalker formation by making a Knowledge

(dungeoneering) check against the stated DCs.

DC 10: When a worthy cavestalker dies in the Underdark,

sometimes the earth absorbs his spirit into the stone.

DC 15:  Fanciful  rock  formations  exist  throughout  the

Underdark, but some of them hold the souls of cavestalkers

and can bestow powers when touched.

DC 20: Someone who gains the power of a cavestalker formation

can use it to hide from the senses of Underdark creatures.

Description: A cavestalker formation appears to be a natural

sculpture of stone in an underground setting. Exotic in appear-

ance,  the  formation  is  usually  a  fancifully  shaped  column,

stalagmite, drapery, or  owstone. Often, a discernible image

of a face is seen in the smooth folds and wrinkles of the stone,

or  a  humanoid  outline  is  vaguely  apparent.  In  other  cases,

the image takes the form of a symbol associated with the late

cavestalkerperhaps a broken sword for someone who car-

ried a shield decorated with that emblem, or a swooping bat

for one who was a werebat.

Prerequisite: The power of a cavestalker formation can be

tapped only by a character who has levels in the barbarian,

ranger, or druid classes; or by someone who has levels in the

cavelord, cavestalker, deep diviner, or prime Underdark guide

prestige classes.

Location Activation: A quali ed character can sense the

lingering essence of a cavestalker formation and claim a portion

of its power by spending a full-round action in direct contact

with the stone. This requirement could prove problematic if

the formation grows on the roof of a cavern, behind a thunder-

ing waterfall, or above a river of molten rock.

Recharge: Up to  ve creatures can tap the power of a given

cavestalker formation before it is spent. The formation must then

recharge for one year before it can confer its bene ts again.

Special Ability (Ex): When activated, a cavestalker formation

grants the recipient a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks

made in an underground setting.

Duration: The Hide check bonus lasts for one year.

Aura: Strong illusion (glamer).

Ability Value: 1,500 gp.

FONT OF DELIGHTS AND SORROWS

Legends  tell  of  ancient  altars  dedicated  to  perverse  deities

that  are  tucked  away  in  remote  reaches  of  the  Underdark.

Explorers  who  are  willing  to  give  their  souls  to  whatever

mad  god  watches  over  such  an  altar  can  gain  great  power.

Far too many fools succumb to these seductive evils, selling

their lives cheaply to sample the delights promised by these

profane places.

These  altars,  known  as  fonts  of  delights  and  sorrows,  occur

spontaneously. They can appear anywhere, at any time, but

they rarely remain intact for long before a paladin or some

other do-gooder destroys them. Thus, fonts of delights and sor-

rows are more common in the direst corners of the Underdark,

where only the most courageous or the most reckless would

dare venture.

Lore: Characters can gain the following pieces of informa-

tion about a font of delights and sorrows by making Knowledge

(religion) checks against the stated DCs.

DC 15: A font of delights and sorrows comes into being at the

behest of dark deities.

DC 20: Those who drink from its waters invite unspeakable

evil into their hearts and minds.

DC 25: These locations are often protected by clerics of evil

gods, who usher willing victims onto the path of corruption,

and who murder heroes seeking to destroy the font.

Description: Although fonts of delights and sorrows appear

in a variety of locations, they are identical in form. They are

wide stone basins decorated with horrid images of mortals

capering with lewd demons or performing unspeakable acts

of depravity and cruelty. Within each font is a pool of black

liquid that seems to drink in the light. No noise or tremor can

disturb its obsidian surface. Only when physically touched

does the  uid assume the normal qualities of wateralbeit

unclean water.

Prerequisite: Only a creature that has attained at least  ve

levels is worthy of gaining the evil blessing of a font of delights

and sorrows.

Location  Activation:  Anyone  who  tastes  the  brackish

waters immediately takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

If the drinker meets the prerequisite, he also gains the bene ts

of the font. Each font has enough black water for three people.

Drinking from the same font of delights and sorrows more than

once  does  not  confer  additional  bene ts,  but  each  sip  still

deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

Recharge: Once three people have sampled the waters of

a font of delights and sorrows, regardless of whether they were

quali ed to receive its power, the font is dry. It cannot be used

again until it re lls itself one year later.

Special  Ability  (Ex):  A  font  of  delights  and  sorrows  cor-

rupts the recipient, twisting his nature so that his alignment

changes to evil. In addition, whenever he deals at least 1 point

of damage in a round, he gains a +2 profane bonus on his attack

rolls  in  the  following  round.  If  he  takes  at  least  1 point  of

damage in a round, he gains a +1 profane bonus on his saving

throws for 1 round.

If the recipient regains his original alignment through the

use of an atonement spell, he loses all bene ts gained from the

font of delights and sorrows.

Duration:  The  alignment  change  is  permanent  (unless

reversed  by  magical  means,  as  noted  above),  and  the  other

effects last for 66 days.

Aura: Strong enchantment.

Ability Value: 3,000 gp (1,000 gp per affected creature).

GARDEN OF RESPLENDENT HUES

Long have explorers told of giant subterranean forests of fungi

and caverns  lled with multicolored mushrooms, puffballs,

and  molds.  Certainly,  the  drow  and  other  denizens  of  the

Underdark harvest fungi to supplement their meager diets,

slake their thirst with fermented juice, clothe themselves in

the  bers, concoct unguents and infusions, and more. But not

all such forests are mere gardens. Some simmer with a deep and

abiding hunger for vengeance. Such sites seek out champions

to avenge past misdeeds, and those who accept this solemn

responsibility undergo a profound transformation.

A  garden  of  resplendent  hues  sometimes  grows  where  a

myconid sovereignMM2 and its tribe are butchered. The spores

released from their dying bodies hang in the air, touched and

changed by the suffering of the slain. When the spores  nally

settle onto the rocks, they  nd purchase and grow, becoming

a breathtaking garden of resplendent hues.

Lore: Characters can gain the following pieces of informa-

tion about a garden of resplendent hues by making Knowledge

(nature) checks at the stated DCs.

DC 10:  Gardens  of  resplendent  hues  are  strange  places  of

unusual growth found only in the Underdark.

DC 15: Though harmless, a garden of resplendent hues hums

with  the  promise  of  violence  and  old  anger,  the  power  of

which seems to resonate with the magic used by druids and

rangers.

DC 20: A druid or ranger who spends time in a garden of

resplendent hues can undergo a transformation.

DC 25: A druid or ranger found worthy by a garden of resplen-

dent hues transforms into a plant, crossing his form with that

of a myconid.

Description: A garden of resplendent hues is a strange and

unsettling place. Typically forming in a hidden grotto, its size

varies depending on the cavern. All gardens of resplendent hues

burst with fungi, including large and small mushrooms, molds,

and  puffballs;  assorted  creepers  and  climbers;  and  sweeps

of yeasts, smuts, and rusts glistening on the walls. The air is

humid, warmed by geothermal vents that made the sites ideal

lairs for the myconid tribes that once lived there.

Prerequisite: To be found worthy of a garden of resplendent

hues and bene t from its power, a character must be nonevil,

and she must be a druid of at least 5th level or a ranger of at

least 8th level.

Location Activation: To be chosen by a garden of resplendent

hues, a character must spend at least 1 hour exploring the area

without damaging any of the fungi. She can move through

the area alone or with companions, but if an evil character is

present, the candidate will not be chosen. At the end of the

hour, she must attempt a DC 15 Will save. If she fails the save,

she becomes dazed (as the daze monster spell) for 1 minute, and

nothing else happens. If she succeeds on the save, the garden

of resplendent hues selects her as its champion.

Recharge: Once it has granted its ability to a single druid

or ranger, a garden of resplendent hues cannot do so again for

one year.

Special Ability (Ex): The recipients type changes to plant.

She gains immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and

polymorph. She also gains damage reduction 5/bludgeoning

or slashing. However, unlike other plants, she is still affected

by critical hits, and she gains only a +4 circumstance bonus

on  Will  saves  against  mind-affecting  spells  and  spell-like

abilities. In addition, her skin acquires a dazzling pattern of

colors re ecting the hues found in the garden. In all other

respects, she is unchanged.

Duration: Any druid or ranger who receives the special

Prerequisite: Only a character who has attained at least ten

levels can bene t from the effects of an area of utter dark.

Location  Activation:  An  area  of  utter  dark  devours  life

as greedily as it eats light. A character who enters the utter

dark must immediately succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or

gain one negative level. Each round he remains in the utter

dark, he must succeed on another save or gain an additional

negative level. Only a quali ed candidate who remains in the

utter dark for 5 consecutive rounds can bene t from its power.

The negative levels are not permanent, fading 1 hour after the

character exits the area of utter dark. However, anyone who

is slain by exposure to the life-draining blackness rises as a

shadow 1d4 rounds later.

Recharge: Once an area of utter dark confers its ability on

a single character, it cannot do so again for one year.

Special Ability (Su): Any quali ed character who taps into

the power of the utter dark gains the ability to see perfectly

in darkness, including magical darkness. If the recipient is a

spellcaster, he also gains the ability to cast spells that have the

darkness descriptor at his caster level +2.

Duration: The conferred ability lasts for one year.

Aura: Strong evocation and transmutation.

Ability Value: 5,000 gp.

UTTER DARK

There  are  whispers  of  places  so  deep  in

the  Underdark  that  no  light  has  ever

shone there, areas where darkness reigns

supreme.  Buried  beneath  miles  of  stone,

these realms are known only to a few. Those

who receive the gift of an area of utter dark

are said to be changed forever.

Lore: Characters can gain the following

pieces of information about an area of utter

dark by making Knowledge (dungeoneer-

ing) checks at the stated DCs.

DC 15:  An  area  of  utter  dark  is  a  place

of  magical  darkness  that  is  impervious

to light.

DC 20: To those willing to feed it, an area

of utter dark reveals the secrets of shadow.

DC 25: A character who gives a portion

of his soul gains the ability to peer through

darkness as if it were an area of bright light.

The recipient can also use darkness effects

with greater pro ciency.

Description: Found only in the deepest

regions of the Underdark, areas of utter dark

are supremely resistant to light. Not even

magical  light  can  penetrate  their  murky

borders. When light shines upon an area

of  utter  dark,  it  reveals  an  impenetrable

black wall, similar to the surface of a sphere

of  annihilation.  Creatures  that  have  dark-

vision can still see within an area of utter

dark, though at half the normal distance.

Those who peer inside  nd that everything

within  the  zone  is  covered  in  pale  dust,

with no signs of life.

Welcome to Erelhei-Cinlu, the most prominent and impor-

tant city in the Vault of the Drow. This chapter presents

basic information about the city, its inhabitants, its history,

and its politics; descriptions of major locations; encounters

suitable for adventurers from the surface; and tips for player

characters and Dungeon Masters alike.

This city has been described in previous DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS products and remains one of the games classic

locations. This chapter portrays a city farther along in its

history, emerging from a series of destructive civil con-

 icts that almost shattered drow power in the region. As

the DM, feel free to change, adapt, or ignore any aspects

of Erelhei-Cinlu described below. The city is yours now,

and you can do whatever is necessary to make it a living

and growing part of your campaign.

n the drow imagination, Erelhei-Cinlu is both the darkly

shining star of their subterranean empire and a foul pit of

the rankest offal, teeming with  lthy lesser creatures and

bubbling with a raw sewage of dirty commoners and vulgar

merchants. Erelhei-Cinlu is at once loved and hated, like an obese

and disease-ridden lover who nonetheless provides golden trinkets

to her consorts. It is a treasure to be protected and a festering boil to

be lanced. In typical fashion, the dark elves simply accept their city

as both and go about their foul business.

Erelhei-Cinlu is one of the few places in the drow empire where

outlanders can come and go in relative freedom. As evil, sadistic,

and xenophobic as the drow can be, they tolerate the presence of for-

eigners hereas long as their own interests are not threatened. An

outlander can even live in Erelhei-Cinlu without interference from

drow authorities, as long as she does not draw undue attention to

herself. Of course, many other dangers lurking in the shadows make

life here a constant challenge. The spiders, the thieves and bandits,

the slave-takers, the gangs, the diseases, the undeadthese are only

a few of the hazards facing non-drow in the city.

THE DARK GEM

The city of Erelhei-Cinlu stands like a polished gemstone in

the heart of the dark elf realm. At the center of an elaborate

web  of  alliances,  rivalries,  and  traditions,  it  embodies  the

essence of drow existencea darkly enchanted capital from

which Lolths faithful praise her name as they plot against one

another and the world beyond.

Erelhei-Cinlu is also one of the most cosmopolitan drow

cities,  which  is  to  say  that  outlanders  are  tolerated.  Those

who  interfere  with  the  drow  are  ruthlessly  and  painfully

exterminated, but those who abide by the citys traditions, as

distasteful as those traditions might be, can survive here, at

least for a time.

AN ANCIENT EVIL

Erelhei-Cinlu lies at the core of a subterranean realm known

as the Vault of the Drow. As dangerous as it is immense, the

Vault is the center of drow power in its part of the world, and

Erelhei-Cinlu is its unquestioned seat of authority.

For many years, House Eilservs was the citys leading noble

family. But when a raid by surface adventurers threw the Vault

into chaos, Eilservs and its Matron Mother, Eclavdra, fell from

grace, replaced by the ambitious House Tormtor. This realign-

ment of power sent shock waves through Erelhei-Cinlu society,

and  in  the  aftermath,  House  Kilsek  challenged  Tormtors

authority, going so far as to reject the worship of the Queen of

Spiders. The Priestess Wars began, and they raged for almost

two decades until some semblance of peace was restored to

the city. In the process, several major houses, most notably the

rebellious Kilsek, were destroyed or signi cantly weakened,

while others, such as the nomadic Vae and the upstart Xaniqos,

rose to power and displaced or destroyed their predecessors.

The  massive  changes  wrought  by  the  Priestess  Wars  are

still being sorted out by the Spider Queen and the surviving

drow. Though their wickedness and perversity remain undi-

minished, the drow of Erelhei-Cinlu have gained a certain

amount of perspective from these events, realizing how close

they  came  to  self-destruction.  Accordingly,  their  activities

below  and  above  ground  have  changed,  with  intrigue  and

hidden  plots  replacing  overt  militaristic  schemes.  House

Tormtor and others now place spies in the surface world, pay

agents and unwitting dupes to advance drow causes, and pull

the  strings  in  clandestine  operations  ranging  from  simple

merchant affairs to the corruption and overthrow of entire

kingdoms. These activities occur in secret because most drow

do not wish to draw more attention to themselves than abso-

lutely necessary. Not all dark elves are as cautious, however.

House Vaes slave-raids on the surface world have raised alarms

among other houses that advocate subtlety.

Similar motivations spur drow activities in the Underdark.

Although open con ict, slave raids, and the mindless destruc-

tion of foes always have their place, the drow of Erelhei-Cinlu

have grown more cunning, making peace and sometimes even

allying with traditional rivals, such as the illithids and the

derro. These partnerships are for convenience only, and both

sides know it. For the time being, however, House Tormtor

and its allies seek to weave a web of diplomacy, espionage, and

conquest  that  will  eventually  bring  all  subterranean  races

under drow rule. Tormtor believes that it is doing the work

of  Lolth  in  a  manner  that  the  Spider  Queen  herself  would

 nd most pleasing.

MISTRESSES OF SHADOW

As is the case in other drow cities, the real power in Erelhei-

Cinlu resides in the noble houses and their matriarchs. Due

to the citys importance to drow society at large, the nobles

of  Erelhei-Cinlu  are  especially  powerful  and  exceptionally

ruthless, even for dark elves.

Currently, the city is recovering from a series of convulsive

internal con icts that saw many of the old families displaced

or destroyed. The so-called Priestess Wars were unusual for

a society that favors subtle intrigue over open con ict, but

when such raw clashes occur, Lolth watches with pleasure as

the weak are smashed and the strong rise to take their place.

The Spider Queen sees overt civil war as a means by which her

people remain pure and avoid stagnation. Besides, she and her

consorts  nd it amusing to watch and occasionally meddle.

By tradition, eight noble houses oversee Erelhei-Cinlu, each

responsible for one of the citys neighborhoods, or ghettoes.

At  times  during  the  various  con icts  that  have  racked  the

city, the number of houses fell to as few as four, but new and

upcoming houses always step in to  ll the gap.

Each household is organized along familial lines, with the

high priestess as the unquestioned ruler. Lesser houses culti-

vate relationships with greater houses in the hope of gaining

in uence and eventually displacing them. Of course, mem-

bers of allied houses rarely trust each other, upholding their

arrangements only as long as they have something to gain.

The eight leading houses are described below in order of

their relative status in the city. None of the families actually live

within Erelhei-Cinluthe place is far too vulgar and  lthy for

noble drow. Instead, their vast estates are located to the north,

across the river known as the Pitchy Flow, while high-ranking

administrators oversee house affairs within the city.

The  current  dominant  noble  household  of  Erelhei-Cinlu,

Tormtor prospers under the leadership of Mistress Verdaeth.

Though the house emerged supreme from the chaos of the

Priestess Wars, Verdaeths consort was cursed by Lolth, and

only recently has the matron mother found a replacement.

With  her  position  secured,  Verdaeth  has  begun  to  expand

her  houses  activities  in  the  surface  world,  taking  control

of several mercantile operations and buying in uence with

powerful politicians.

The  vast  majority  of  Tormtors  warriors  are  devoted  to

the vital and prestigious duty of patrolling the city wall and

defending its gates. So demanding is this duty, in fact, that Ver-

daeth has allowed a number of warriors from House Despana

to serve as well, albeit under Tormtor control. She is painfully

aware that this leaves her vulnerable and indebted to Despana,

vates partnerships with surface adventurers, particularly those

of evil alignment, and uses them against the mind  ayers, the

derro, and other subterranean rivals.

to come from this martial house, whose holdings are built

like fortresses, with extensive armories and training facili-

ties. Despana is also known for its diabolists and summoners,

who make liberal use of bound demons and other outsiders.

Lady Shehirae is a remarkable success story, having risen from

the rank of slave to that of matron after participating in the

assassination of the houses previous ruler. Despanas tradition

of military excellence has continued ever since, and today a

disproportionate number of drow warriors owe allegiance to

this household. Despana maintains relatively good relations

with  House  Tormtor  and  periodically  lends  its  warriors  to

assist with wall patrol and guard duties.

Shiquos

Sigil: Amethyst bat

City District: Ghetto of Scholars

Matron: Ytheshana (CE female drow rogue 6/assassin 6,

Hide +19, Move Silently +18)

During the Priestess Wars, House Noquar remained neutral,

but the strategy availed it little because it emerged with few

resources and no allies. The up-and-coming Shiquos family

was  able  to  displace  Noquar  with  a  skillful  and  ruthless

campaign  of  assassination,  extortion,  and  false  accusations

of  treason.  Today,  Matron  Mother  Ytheshana  presides  over

a successful clan that specializes in necromancy and other

dark arcane arts.

Godeep

Sigil: Platinum crossbow

City District: Ghetto of Artisans

Matron: Siadef (CE female drow cleric 10/ ghter 10,

Diplomacy +15)

Like the disgraced Noquar, Godeep chose to maintain neutral-

ity during the Priestess Wars. However, Godeep emerged from

the con ict stronger, without having squandered its resources

on pointless destruction. Siadef is the longest-ruling matron

in Erelhei-Cinlu, but as she grows older, her tenure seems to

be nearing its end. Godeep produces especially potent magic

items and is also well known for its members skill at breed-

ing spiders.

Vae

Sigil: Iron chain

City District: Ghetto of Chattel

Matron: Sereska (CE female drow cleric 9/wizard 9,

Spellcraft +24)

Once a nomadic merchant clan, the Vae family took advantage

of con icts among the nobles to rise to prominence. Granted

the holdings of the destroyed House Kilsek, Vae is a leading

mercantile house and controls the citys slave trade. Recently,

Sereska began sponsoring expeditions to the surface to cap-

ture slaves. Other houses, particularly Tormtor and Aleval,

protest these blatant acts of aggression, arguing that the way

to power on the surface is through stealth and secrecy, not

outright warfare.

Eilservs

Sigil: Bronze staff

City District: Ghetto of the Dead

Matron: Eclavdra (CE female drow cleric 24,

Diplomacy +26, Knowledge [religion] +30; see Epic Level

Handbook page 306)

Once a leading family in Erelhei-Cinlu politics, House Eilservs

lost much of its in uence when a band of surface adventurers

dealt a serious blow to the Vault of the Drowthe intruders

even sacked the holy Fane of Lolth. Mistress Eclavdra disap-

peared for many years, and some thought her dead. Eventually,

she  returned  and  took  command  of  House  Eilservs  once

again, guiding it through the Priestess Wars and emerging

intact,  albeit  with  reduced  status.  But  Eclavdra  appears  to

have regained the favor of the Spider Queen, having recently

assumed control of the Fane of Lolth. Thus, she continues to

advance the fortunes of a family that many once thought to

be on the verge of extinction.

Xaniqos

Sigil: Jet crossbow bolt

City District: Ghetto of Outcasts

Matron: Thandysha (NE female drow cleric 18, Bluff +10,

Diplomacy +9)

The  drow  endlessly  struggle  and  plot  against  one  another,

and the spectacle of betrayal and cruelty gives Lolth no end

of  pleasure.  The  evil  deity  watches  as  the  strongest  of  her

children prosper by strangling the weak. The upstart House

Xaniqos,  the  youngest  and  most  impetuous  of  the  ruling

families, rose to its position by exterminating the remnants

of the old House Everhate, a family whose ineptitude during

the wars cost them everything. Lady Thandysha is a brash and

energetic ruler whose excesses in the worship of Lolth and

the pursuit of personal power are already legendary. Her pri-

mary weakness is her own ambition, because although House

Xaniqos engages in many different activities and schemes, it

excels at none of them.

OUTLANDERS IN ERELHEI-CINLU

As the hub of dark elf activity in the region, Erelhei-Cinlu

is surprisingly cosmopolitan, with all major races present as

residents, visitors, or slaves. Even the despised surface elves

can walk the citys labyrinthine streets and manage to survive

in the face of their cousins venomous hatred.

Being chaotic in general, the drow care little for the align-

ment or character of visitors, as long as they obey the citys

ways and stay out of trouble. Travelers who enter the Vault of

the Drow through normal trade routes are inspected by dark

elf patrols, who demand that each visitor swear on pain of

death to obey all dictates and traditions of the drow houses.

Visitors then receive dark green guest cloaks (see page 92),

which they must wear at all times to signify their status as

outlanders.

Non-drow who live in the city are restricted to the Ghetto

of Foreigners, which falls under the administration of House

Tormtor.  To  be  granted  resident  status,  an  individual  must

live in Erelhei-Cinlu for at least six months and then make a

successful application to Tormtor. Outlanders who become

residents no longer have to wear guest cloaks, but they must

pay a fee of 1 gp per month and carry a residents medalliona

black  metal  item  inscribed  with  a  stylized  spider.  Trade  in

counterfeit medallions is brisk. Fakes cost up to 1,000 gp, even

though the penalty for carrying or selling them ranges from

permanent enslavement to death.

RELATIONS WITH THE

OUTSIDE WORLD

The  drow  are  increasingly  aware  that  they  do  not  live  in  a

vacuum  and  that  a  teeming  surface  world  exists  above,  far

from the isolated security of their realm. Early attempts to

gain in uence in that world ended catastrophically, causing

the downfall of major drow houses. But since the conclusion

of the Priestess Wars, the drow of Erelhei-Cinlu have grown

more realistic and cunning in their dealings with outlanders,

whether they hail from the surface or from below.

Most drow believe it is their destiny to conquer the Under-

dark.  However,  the  other  subterranean  racesincluding

derro,  illithids,  aboleths,  kuo-toas,  duergar,  desmodusMM2,

and myconidsMM2stubbornly refuse to cooperate with drow

schemes for world domination. Some races, in fact, have the

temerity to actively resist.

The dark elves know that they are among the most powerful

of the Underdark races, and they have no intention of aban-

doning the destiny of conquest promised by Lolth. However,

the drow are willing to employ subtlety and forge alliances

to get what they want. Some drow houses, for example, have

established close ties with illithids, using the mind  ayers

to help promote dark elf causes in the Underdark and on the

surface. Such alliances are hazardous, however. House Noquar

suffered for its association with illithids and was eventually

brought down in the Priestess Wars.

20 SIGHTS OF THE CITY

The  gloom  of  Erelhei-Cinlu  hides  many  secrets.  The  casual

traveler might glimpse sights ranging from the curious to the

horrifying, such as those described below.

1  A  female  drow  noble  strolls  by,  walking  her  petsa

number of human, drow, and goblin slaves in collars and

chains.

2  An  imperious  drow  priestess  sweeps  past,  escorted  by

several armored bugbears and a small coterie of hangers-on

and toadies.

3  A derro merchant walks by pushing his cart, which is laden

with fresh-picked mushrooms, smoked lizards and frogs,

and other foodstuffs.

4  A pair of male drow brawl in the street over an imagined

slight, draw rapiers, and  ght to the death.

5  A goblin slave scurries by, loaded down with bottles, jars,

and other items for his mistress.

6  Two humans in dark clothing slip discreetly out of a shad-

owy alleyway, one bearing a small coin purse and the other

clutching a small bottle of purple liquid.

In the distance, an enormous winged creature  aps toward

a towering structure and disappears through a large open

window.

7

8  Minimally clad males and females of various races, includ-

ing drow, lounge enticingly on a balcony, beckoning pass-

ersby to approach.

9  Two female drow soldiers drag a reluctant elf behind them

in chains. The  lthy prisoner has an expression that is at

once terri ed and resigned.

10   A  spider-tender  guides  several  of  her  charges  down  the

street  with  gentle  pressure  from  her  crook.  The  spiders

seem  agitated, clicking their mandibles irritably.

11   A pair of red eyes gleams from a gutter or a dark corner of

the street, then vanishes.

12   A small group of kuo-toas, their scales glistening, stand in

a plaza and point upward excitedly while hissing and grunt-

ing in their native tongue.

13   A priestess in ceremonial robes calls out an invocation at

a shrine to Lolth, and a dozen worshipers abase themselves

before her in response.

14   A  solemn  religious  procession  of  several  lower-ranking

priestesses, preceded by males bearing censers and black

candles, passes by in complete silence.

15   A squad of drow cavalry mounted on riding lizards speeds

down the street, scattering pedestrians and upending carts

and tables.

16   A  gnome  crafter  works  silently  on  an  elaborate  piece  of

furniture in an open-air workshop. Closer inspection reveals

that he is chained to his workbench.

17   A dwarf gladiator, scarred and grim-faced, sits outside a

tavern, describing his latest bout in the arena to a small

crowd of admirers.

In the courtyard outside a school, a drow instructor points

to a diagram of the human body while lecturing to students

on the  ner points of torture.

19.  A drow demonbinder shifts into her  endish form and takes

to the sky on dark, leathery wings.

20  A  drow  chained  to  a  whipping  post  is  being   ogged  by

bugbear slaves while his trainer, a female drow noble, looks

on.  The  chained  drow  orders  the  bugbears  to  strike  him

harder.

Relations with the surface world are complex and often

involve  contradictory  goals.  The  disastrous  assault  on  the

Fane of Lolth, now decades in the past, still lingers in the

drow psyche, and most dark elves wish to maintain a degree

of isolation from surface dwellers. At the same time, the lure

of power and the lust for bloodshed and mayhem (inherited

from their patron deity) compels the drow to expand their

realm  beyond  the  con nes  of  the  Underdark.  The  dark

elves  of  today  hope  to  accomplish  this  goal  with  intrigue

and subtlety.

THE CITY

Erelhei-Cinlu is a wondrous sight, brooding in the dim light of

the Vault, surrounded by a massive wall made of polished black

basalt and studded with guard towers. The city is every bit as

chaotic as its natives, with structures ranging from the ram-

shackle tenements of artisans to the extraordinary buildings

in the Ghetto of Scholars. Day and night are a purely surface

concept, so the city is busy at all hours, teeming with drow,

their slaves and servants, and outlanders of all races.

The dark elves are notorious for their kinship with spiders,

which developed as a result of their self-image and the dictates

of their unforgiving deity. Nowhere is this relationship more

obvious than in the streets of Erelhei-Cinlu. Spiders of all sizes

and varieties lurk in alleys, on rooftops, in basementsjust

about anywhere, stringing webs between buildings to catch

vermin or unwary passersby.

Outlanders are increasingly common in Erelhei-Cinlu, and

despite the wishes of some secretive drow, the citys existence

is known to more and more surface dwellers with each passing

year. Visitors can  nd rewards and opportunities in Erelhei-

Cinlu, but they must remember that they take their lives in

their hands just by sharing the streets with the mercurial and

often sociopathic dark elves.

The city is divided into eight ghettos or districts, each under

the control of a different drow house. The nobles do not live

within the citys enclosing wall, dwelling instead in palatial

WHERE TO GO

Adventurers in Erelhei-Cinlu need all the usual supplies, such

as food, lodging, clothing, weapons, and armor. Discreet con-

tacts  with  locals  (in  the  form  of  Gather  Information  checks)

yields  information  about  suitable  locations.  The  higher  the

check result, the more accurate the informationa low result

when searching for an inn could land the PCs in a grim dive

where they might be knifed in their sleep.

Presented here are some common needs and establishments

that meet those needs. A successful Gather Information check

earns the tip that follows the indicated DC. If the check fails, the

informant either has nothing to say or provides false counsel

instead.

Food and Drink: The drow are masters of poison, so finding

safe food and drink can be a problem. No establishments are

guaranteed, but some are more reliable than others.

P4, The Upturned Jar (DC 10): Take care what you drink, or

youll end up washing dishes.

Sc7, The Old Battleaxe (DC 10): Bugbears onlyothers steer

clear of this place.

O2, The Snake and Weasel (DC 15): A den of thieves, but pleas-

ant enough if youre a rogue.

O3, The Demons Den (DC 10): A favored haunt of rakes, and

a nice spot for a fight.

D4,  The  Black  Chalice  (DC 20):  Deep  in  the  Necropolis,

owned by a vampire. Not for the faint of heart.

Lodging:  Establishments  that  operate  purely  as  lodging

houses are rare. Most serve multiple functions, offering food

and  drink,  gambling,  or  discreet  companionship  in  addition

to room and board. However, the following locations are best

known for their lodging facilities.

F6, The Black Widow (DC 15): Be wary of the owner, especially

if youre lucky at the gaming tables.

F7, Knucklebones Inn (DC 10): The buildings even less safe

than it looksif thats possible.

F8, Teesons Rooming House (DC 10): Keep a close watch on

your valuables.

C6, The Crop and Manacle (DC 15): Pleasant enoughif you

like pain.

run from the authorities.

D5, The Grim Ghost (DC 20): A safe haven in the Necropolis,

owned by a friendly elf who must be insane.

Clothing: The drow love clothing, and numerous shops cater

to  commoners.  The  following  garment  shops  are  two  of  the

most well known.

A3, Tasaelas Raiment (DC 10): The finest in town, but Tasaela

doesnt like foreigners much.

P6, Costumers Guild (DC 15): Almost anything you need, in-

cluding disguises and counterfeit noble clothingif you know

who to ask.

Weapons  and  Armor:  Most  drow  houses  have  their  own

armorers. Foreigners and common drow are allowed to have

weapons and armor, but only if their equipment does not out-

shine that of the citys elite. Otherwise, they will be challenged

to frequent fights as a result of their audacity.

A4, Nyttoriss Arms and Armor (DC 10): Expensive but worth

it.

C3, Beast Trainer (DC 10): Crude but serviceable armor, and

you might find work hunting down escaped slaves.

Magic,  Spells,  and  Spell  Components:  Arcane  forces  swirl

around the magic-obsessed drow. Several establishments are

known to offer reliable goods to commoners.

Sc3, Palace of Scribes (DC 10): Dusty and vast, but useful.

Sc4, The Ebon Libram (DC 10): Many rare spells, but you must

become a member.

A5, Poisons and Potions (DC 15): This spider-lover might be a

lunatic, but his brews are the best.

Healing:  In  Erelhei-Cinlu,  being  healed  by  a  cleric  is  risky.

Only  the  clerics  of  Lolth  are  allowed  to  cast  divine  magic,

though a few exceptions exist. For example, outlander clerics

can cast divine magic within the confines of their temples, but

most of the deities represented in the Ghetto of Foreigners are

evil and care little for cures. Two temples that do provide heal-

ing are mentioned below.

F4, Temple of Boccob (DC 10): The temple accepts labor from

arcane casters in exchange for mending their wounds.

F5, Temple of Olidammara (DC 15): Leave a generous dona-

tion, or the healing spell you receive might not be as helpful as

you thought.

O4, The Hideaway (DC 25): The place to go if youre on the

estates on a plateau to the north that is accessible only by way

of the Flying Bridge.

THE WALL

An enormous wall of black stone surrounds the city, at once

protecting and imprisoning its inhabitants. Crafted of polished

basalt,  it  is  apparently  seamless,  a  continuous  piece  of  stone

describing the perimeter of Erelhei-Cinlu. Like just about every

other crime in the city, scaling the wall is an offense punishable

by death or enslavement. Whichever drow family is the most

powerfulcurrently, House Tormtormaintains security and

provides guards to patrol the wall. There is great competition for

this role, since the house that keeps the wall also controls access

to and from the city, and with it the majority of tariffs, taxes,

bribes,  and  other  income.  Such  an  important  responsibility

requires plenty of guards, so the patrols often include warriors

from House Despana, which (for the moment) maintains good

relations with House Tormtor. This arrangement makes Des-

pana indispensable to Tormtor, for the withdrawal of Despana

support would leave Tormtor all but helpless.

W1. South Wall

This section of the wall surrounds the major portion of the

city and rises to a height of 30 feet. The top is crenellated,

with supplies of crossbow bolts every 50 feet or so. Guards

walk along its length and are encountered every 15 minutes

as they patrol the wall. Although the Great Gate is the major

entry  point  into  Erelhei-Cinlu,  the  South  Wall  is  studded

with numerous small doors and sally ports, which are nor-

mally magically locked and barred. Tampering with them is,

naturally, a capital crime.

W2.The Great Gate

For non-drow and for drow commoners, this massive fortress is

the only way in and out of Erelhei-Cinlu. When survivors and

retainers of the fallen House Noquar tried to  ee the city sev-

eral years ago, the Great Gate was the scene of a ferocious battle.

Yugoloths and bugbear troops killed almost all the Noquars,

but in the process, the structure was badly damaged.

Since then, the Great Gate has been rebuilt, stronger than

before.  Atop  the  entryway  is  a  massive  jet  statue  of  Lolth,

crouching  in  spider-drow  form.  Two  giant  statues  of  drow,

one  male  and  one  female,   ank  the  entrance  at  ground

level.  Heavy  black  iron  gates  and  a  massive  portcullis  can

be closed and secured, allowing troops in the gatehouse to

rain bolts, alchemical substances, and offensive spells down

upon attackers.

The gates are normally open, but squads of drow guards

interrogate  anyone  wishing  to  enter  the  city,  issuing  guest

cloaks to visitors as needed. Taxes, tariffs, and discretionary

fees are imposed as the current watch commander sees  t;

the city has no formal tax code. However, the drow realize

that taking too much from visitors will discourage trade and

reduce House Tormtors prosperity.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

20 SOUNDS OF THE CITY

Many visitors to Erelhei-Cinlu comment on its heavy and almost

oppressive silence. Few raise their voices in the streets or make

loud noises, because no one wants to draw undue attention.

Still,  careful  listeners  might  hear  disquieting  or  inexplicable

sounds  that  emanate  from  shadowy  corners,  shuttered  win-

dows, or hidden chambers.

1  A drawn-out scream of agony echoes from somewhere be-

neath your feet, muf ed by earth and stone.

2  You hear distant and indistinct chanting in an unfamiliar

language. A successful DC 15 Listen check reveals the name

Lolth repeated reverently.

3  The guttural snarl of a demon or other fell beast is fol-

lowed  by  a  cry  of  ecstasy  or  horroryou  cannot  tell

which.

4  Mad, incoherent laughter echoes from somewhere above.

5  A voice calls out the somatic component of a spell (DMs

choice;  a  successful  Spellcraft  check  reveals  the  speci c

spell).

6  A  weak  and  terri ed  voice  begs  for  mercy  and  is  swiftly

silenced.

7  From  the  darkness  overhead,  you  hear  the  high-pitched

chittering of many small  ying creatures, but when you look,

you see nothing.

8  You hear a faint hint of a whispered conversation. One voice

is soft and sweet, like that of a female drow. The other is

deep and brutal, like that of a troll or a demon. Just as you

start listening, the conversation abruptly ceases.

10   The voice of a house herald echoes up and down the street,

calling the faithful to the hour of worship and crying out the

praises of Lolth.

11   An angry argument breaks out, punctuated by the sound

of breaking glass, the clash of steel, and a short, sharp cry

of pain.

12   A harsh voice cries out in accented Common (a successful

DC 10 Knowledge check reveals that the speaker is probably

a bugbear), followed by the crack of a whip.

13   You hear the shouts of drow authorities, the clatter of large

animals,  and  the  hissing  of  riding  lizards  from  several

streets away.

14   A number of voices join together in a drunken song, accom-

panied by the pounding of drums and a cacophony of impro-

vised instruments. None of the voices sounds like a drow.

15   From down the street come the chittering voices of a dozen

or more goblins.

16   A drow voice barks orders, and a guttural, bovine bellow

sounds in response.

17   You brie y hear the sound of a gale-force windand per-

haps demonic howlingfrom somewhere close by (a suc-

cessful DC 20 Spellcraft check reveals it to be the sound of

a planar gateway opening and closing).

18   An angry drow voice shouts over the sound of blows and

the pleas for mercy from a goblin or hal ing.

19   A  squad  of  bugbears  or  trolls  chants  in  unison  as  they

engage in heavy labor.

20  The  voice  of  a  lunatic  echoes  up  from  below,  babbling

W3. Guard Towers

GHETTO OF FOREIGNERS

These square, three-story towers stud the South Wall every

100 to 500 feet. Each tower is 50 feet tall and contains living

quarters for up to thirty drow warriors, though usually only

one squad occupies a tower at any given time. The towers also

hold stores of food, weapons, armor, and clothing.

W4. North Wall

The grim wall rises to 50 feet in height along the northern

perimeter of the city, where it borders the dark waters of the

Pitchy Flow. The wall has no towers here, but its top remains

crenellated, and it can be defended if necessary. However, this

area sees little activity, and guards patrol the distance between

the Noble Gate and the South Wall infrequently.

W5. Noble Gate

At the western end of High Street stands the Noble Gate, a

six-story structure that blocks the road to the estates of the

drow nobles, which lie beyond the Flying Bridge. Extensive

battlements, two heavily reinforced gates, and various guard

forces protect the elite houses. A black stone image of Lolth

in spider form looks down from atop the southernmost gate,

while her image in drow form adorns the northernmost gate,

which opens onto the bridge.

Only  noble  drow  and  their  attendants  can  pass  through

the two gates, and the dark elves maintain many safeguards

to keep undesirables away. First and foremost are one hundred

elite drow guards, who have no compunctions about killing

passersby who merely stray too near the gate. The guards are

supported by a small squad of yugoloths (three nycaloths and

three mezzoloths) and a cohort of drow wizards and sorcerers

who are prepared to apply any level of arcane force necessary

to defend the Noble Gate.

W6. Flying Bridge

This elegant structure spans the black waters of the Pitchy Flow

north of Erelhei-Cinlu. Deceptively slender and seemingly

frail, the bridge is a marvel of engineering, shaped from what

appears to be a single piece of polished stone, just like the city

wall. Its slim supports are carved with drow incantations and

prayers to Lolth, and statues of drow rulers and heroes line

both sides of the bridge. Two squads of drow warriors stand

guard at all times.

W7. Noble Estates

Lost in the gloom that surrounds Erelhei-Cinlu, the estates

of the drow nobles are vast and wondrous compounds, with

elaborate buildings and carefully manicured grounds. Each

of the eight ruling families maintains an estate here, amid

forests  of  phosphorescent  fungi,  stands  of  pale  grass,  and

albino ferns and trees.

Beyond the noble estates lies the fearsome Fane of Lolth,

the  center  of  the  Spider  Queens  power  in  the  area.  Here,

horri c rituals and sacri ces are made in the deitys name.

Often, the Fane is the last destination of unfortunate captives

or slaves of the drow.

This district is the only region of Erelhei-Cinlu where out-

landers are allowed to live. It is a warren of narrow streets and

tottering buildings in varying degrees of disrepair. Humans,

dwarves, illithids, svirfneblin, and others inhabit this deadly

urban maze under the watchful eye of House Tormtor, whose

of cials try to prevent the ghettos mayhem from spilling over

into the rest of Erelhei-Cinlu. Other drow avoid the district,

deigning to visit the ghetto only when they must hire outland-

ers for their schemes.

The  Ghetto  of  Foreigners  is  also  the  only  place  in  the

city (and in the dark elf realm beyond) that allows temples

dedicated to non-drow deities. Needless to say, evil gods pre-

dominate, and all temples exist at the pleasure of Lolth and

her clerics. The temples are heavily taxed, and their priests

and priestesses must be approved by representatives of House

Tormtor. Nonetheless, ghetto residents can practice foreign

religions in relative freedom. The drow look the other way as

long as the worship does not disrupt the city or interfere with

the work of Lolth.

F1. Shrine of Lolth

A black obsidian obelisk rises here, inscribed with images of

Lolth in both of her favored forms. Anyone wishing to visit

the  temples  beyond  the  shrine  must  leave  a  tribute  to  the

Queen of Spiders as a symbolic acknowledgement of Lolths

supremacy. Two clerics maintain the shrine, and a squad of

bugbears enforces the tribute (though few if any visitors dare

refuse to pay Lolth her due). One silver piece per person is

usually suf cient, but visitors who look especially wealthy

are expected to leave at least one gold piece.

F2. Temple of Nerull

Worship of the Lord of Death is quite common in the gloom

of the Underdark. Necromancers, assassins, criminals, ber-

serkers, and others who revere death visit this temple to pay

homage and to receive guidance from high priestess Thavaesa

Narr (NE female half- end drow cleric 11, Knowledge [reli-

gion] +16). Narr is said to be the daughter of a human cleric of

Nerull and a female demon. The temple is an elegant structure

of black stone, constantly polished by slaves and laborers.

F3. Temple of Vecna

In the surface world, the lich-god Vecna is rarely worshiped

overtly, but in Erelhei-Cinlu, the faithful are open and public

about their veneration for the deity. The temple is actually a

collection of smaller buildings, connected by subterranean

passages, that house shrines, vaults, libraries, and chambers

where dark rites are performed. The Temple of Vecna includes

among its visitors a number of drow who revere Lolth but who

are not above getting help wherever they can.

F4. Temple of Boccob

The neutral deity of magic has a number of non-drow followers

in the city, especially among those who came to Erelhei-Cinlu

in search of forbidden arcane knowledge. Temple clerics per-

form services for mages, scholars, and others with an interest in

magic. The priests offer healing and other services to outland-

ers, but they often ask for assistance from arcane spellcasters

in exchange. Boccobs priests maintain good relations with

House Tormtor and assist the drow of that house with magi-

cal research. As a result, this temple is less heavily taxed than

others in the ghetto.

F5. Temple of Olidammara

The clerics of Olidammara, deity of thieves and pranksters,

make  their  home  in  this  blocky,  nondescript  templethe

closest thing the Ghetto of Foreigners has to a thieves guild.

The Temple of the Laughing Rogue acts as a mutual aid society

where criminals can meet, discuss common issues, and dis-

pose of their ill-gotten gains. Temple priests also help faithful

rogues by granting them healing, blessings, and prayers for

good fortune in their future criminal endeavors. Other visi-

tors to the temple are offered curative services in exchange for

donations. Stingy contributions sometimes result in healing

spells that suddenly lose their effectiveness at inopportune

moments.

F6. The Black Widow

A typical establishment in the Ghetto of Foreigners, the Black

Widow combines inn, brothel, and gaming house into a single

business.  It  is  run  by  Keluvos  Nysin  (NE  male  human  [?],

expert 9/rogue 4, Hide +13), a human-looking proprietor who

is said to have demon blood in his veins and who supposedly

killed (and possibly devoured) the previous owner. Despite

its dire reputation, the Black Widow is popular with visiting

adventurers, particularly those of a chaotic bent, and a handful

of customers have won fortunes at the gaming tables. More

often than not, however, big winners end up losing their last

copper piece when their luck runs out, and those who do walk

away rich often meet with a messy end soon afterward.

The  Widows  rooms  are  nothing  short  of  luxurious,  and

the  brothels  employees  are  among  the  most  attractive  and

talented in the district.

F7. Knucklebones Inn

Another combination gambling den and rooming house, this

ramshackle structure is owned by a one-eyed dwarf known

only as Knucklebone (N male dwarf  ghter 10, Intimidate +13).

The place is a true wonder of the citythat is, its a wonder

the building has not yet fallen down. Over the years, parts

of the roof have caved in, gables have fallen into the street,

walls have collapsed,  oorboards have splintered and spilled

guests into the rooms below, and so on. Knucklebone and his

employees, a small horde of chattering goblins, have made so

many  improvised  and  haphazard  repairs  that  the  building

bears almost no resemblance to its original design. Guests are

sometimes puzzled to  nd that hallways have shifted or that

their rooms have moved, occasionally up or down a full level.

The inn is normally  ve stories tall, but even that measure-

ment is subject to change.

Still, Knucklebone is quite welcoming to outlanders, and

despite its strangeness, his inn is popular with adventurers.

F8. Teesons Rooming House

Architecturally, Teesons Rooming House is far more stable

than Knucklebones shifting wonder. However, it is also far

more dangerous, since its proprietor (CN male half-elf expert

6) welcomes all guests, many of whom seem insane, violent,

and unpredictable. All the same, the price is right. A mere

 ve coppers per night, or one gold piece per month, gets you a

cramped room and one meal a day from whatever Teeson and

his staff can scrounge up. The mushroom-rat stew is especially

popular with the kobold tenants.

GHETTO OF SCHOLARS

House Shiqos recently took control of this district, where the

darkest and most forbidden knowledge is available to anyone

who pays the price. The ghetto is frequented by drow and thus

more cosmopolitan and more crowded than the nearby Ghetto

of Foreigners. The neighborhood was the scene of  erce inter-

necine battles during the Priestess Wars when House Noquar

TOP FIVE WAYS

TO START A FIGHT WITH A DROW

It is said that the best and easiest way to pick a fight with a drow

is  simply  to  be  a  non-drow.  Xenophobia  aside,  Erelhei-Cinlu

teems  with  opportunities  for  misunderstanding  and  casual

violence. Here is a small sample of such potential incidents.

Insulting a Drow: Almost anything you do can be interpreted

as an insult by the drow, but anything less than total politeness

and obsequiousness is likely to trigger a violent response. Of-

fenses can include failing to let a drow order first at a tavern,

walking in front of a drow while crossing the street, or failing to

avert your eyes when a drow looks your way.

Inappropriate  Dress:  All  outlanders  in  Erelhei-Cinlu  must

wear  guest  cloaks  at  all  times.  Non-drow  who  have  gained

resident status can wear black spider medallions instead, but

other  non-drow  caught  without  their  cloaks  are  targeted  for

arrest  and  interrogation.  Any  sign  of  resistance  provokes  an

instant and forceful response from the dark elves.

Failure  to  Show  Proper  Respect  for  Lolth:  As  with  insults,

this offense covers a wide range of actions. Simply acknowl-

edging the divinity of another god might send a faithful drow

into  a  murderous  rage.  However,  displaying  the  holy  symbol

of  another  faith  or  (worse  still)  casting  divine  magic  almost

guarantees a hostile reaction.

Speaking a Foreign Tongue: The drow are a suspicious race,

and  foreigners  who  seem  to  whisper  and  conspire  in  their

barbaric babble will attract unwanted attention. If outlanders

wish the privilege of spending time in Erelhei-Cinlu, the drow

expect them to speak the language of the dark elves. Besides,

using a foreign tongue only means that they have something

to hide.

Not Being a Drow: The simple offense of having been born

to a race other than the drow is sufficient provocation for many

dark elves. Young thugs, bored and ignored by their families,

wander the Ghetto of Foreigners looking for fights, and they

invariably find outlanders who are willing to oblige.

was  forcibly  expelled.  In  fact,  many  of  the

landmarks were destroyed, most notably the

Spire of the Encyclic, a storehouse of dark elf

knowledge.

The  Ghetto  of  Scholars  lacks  the  usual

gamut of inns, taverns, brothels, and similar

establishments. Residents here tend to focus

on their various quests for knowledge. In the

few taverns present, such as the Poison Pen

and the Empty Tome, the ambience is sedate

and intellectual. Quiet study, polite conver-

sation, and the occasional game of skill is the

rule, though the violence and perversity of

drow society is never far beneath the sur-

face. For example, the famous Third Level

Inn was destroyed in a dispute between two

drow  sorcerers  over  whether  one  of  them

had removed his hand from a piece during

a friendly game of dragon chess.

One of the greatest tragedies of the Priest-

ess  Wars  occurred  when  House  Noquar

defenders set  re to the Spire of the Encyc-

lic rather than lose it to the upstart House

Shiqos.  Though  some  of  the  spires  con-

tents  were  savedincluding  the  Libram

Encyclic, a volume said to contain all drow

knowledgemany  priceless  works  were

lost forever.

Today, a council of scholars from all eight houses oversees

the  restoration  of  knowledge  in  the  new  Tower  of  Words.

Though the drow are a fractious and chaotic race, they realize

that the loss of more knowledge might spell their doom, so

they have agreed to cooperate in the maintenance and control

of this structure.

The Tower of Words recreates many of the features of the

former Spire of the Encyclic, but it also encourages the pursuit of

new avenues of learning. Outlanders can visit the tower as long as

they are sponsored by a member of the ruling council, a privilege

that usually requires hefty bribes. Nevertheless, non-drow are

frequent visitors to the tower, where they can  nd knowledge

that is forbidden, banned, or shunned on the surface world.

Sc2. The Antisolar Institute

An elaborate jumble of gray-green stone that sprouts fanciful

towers, bridges, walkways, porticos, and balconies, the Anti-

solar Institute was built by illithids many years ago to help

maintain good relations with the drow and other subterranean

races. Later, derro scholars came to conduct magical research

at the institute, and ever since, the two racesnormally quite

antagonistichave worked together here.

The illithids stated purpose in starting the institute was to

research the illumination and radiations of the Underdark, in

the hope of deriving a means of protection from the painful

daylight  of  the  surface  world.  Research  has  expanded  well

beyond  that  original  purpose.  Currently,  the  mind   ayers

and the derro together study psionic phenomena, alchemy,

200

In the Antisolar Institute,

illithids contemplate the dark energies of the subterranean world

linguistics, sociology, subterranean astronomancy, and other

exotic pursuits. The illithids and derro at the institute have

lived in Erelhei-Cinlu for generations, and they have more

ties to the drow than to their own races.

Outlanders and surface adventurers rarely have any dealings

with the Antisolar Institute, though they are sometimes hired

as guards. From time to time, however, foreigners are brought

here for experimentation and other scholarly research.

Sc3. Palace of Scribes

Scribes and others who are skilled in the crafting of books,

scrolls, and documents are valued in the Ghetto of Scholars,

where learning and knowledge are paramount. In this ornate

three-story  structure,  a  small  army  of  scribes  labors  at  all

hours, copying books, taking dictation, transcribing notes, and

engaging in other arcane pursuits at the behest of their clients.

Most of the palace scribes are slaves of various racesdwarves

and gnomes are especially prized for their steady hands and

painstaking  natureoverseen  by  dark  elf  masters.  Scribes

who continue to provide useful and pro table services are well

treated and live in conditions of relative comfort.

The palace also provides magical services, such as creating

scrolls and copying spells into spellbooks. These endeavors

are normally carried out by the palaces drow employees, who

have arcane skills that the slaves do not.

2/22/07   3:38:02 PM

Sc4. The Ebon Libram

A private library administered by the sorceress Elizarea (LE

female drow sorcerer 9, Knowledge [history] +14) and her slaves

and drow assistants, the Ebon Libram houses one of the most

extensive collections of magic tomes, scrolls, and tablets in the

world. Unsurprisingly, Elizarea focuses on dark and forbidden

lorespells of demonism, torment, interrogation, and painful

death are among her most popular items.

The cost to join the Libram is quite steep. An ordinary mem-

bership is 100 gp, which allows access only to spells found in

the Players Handbook of up to 5th level. A contributing mem-

bership is 1,000 gp, which allows access to all the standard

Players Handbook spells. Transcribing a spell requires 100 gp

per spell level in addition to the normal costs associated with

scribing a spell.

A senior membership, costing 2,000 gp, grants access to all

spells in the Ebon Libram. As the DM, you are free to specify

the precise contents of the collection, which might include

unique drow spells and spells from other game products. Copy-

ing spells that Elizarea considers particularly rare, sensitive,

or desirable might entail a surcharge of up to 1,000 gp.

GHETTO OF ARTISANS

The drow pride themselves on their lavish good taste in fash-

ion, architecture,  ne art, and sculpture. Everything that a

drow uses each day must conform to dark elf aesthetics, even

such mundane items as tools and utensils. Amid the twisted

streets and walled mansions and workshops of the Ghetto of

Artisans, drow crafters labor to outdo one another in every

aspect. The darker side of creation is represented as well, for

the drow consider poisons and implements of torture to be

among the most valued works of art.

Outlanders are forbidden in the ghetto unless given speci c

permission by House Godeep. Slaves are an exception to this

rule, since they carry or are marked with their houses sigil,

signifying that they are mere possessions and unworthy of

undue attention.

Numerous businesses in the ghetto cater to drow, including

the  usual  assortment  of  drinking  establishments,  brothels,

and drug dens. Many drow crafters practice decadence and

perversion as a form of art, offering such disturbing services

as torture,  esh sculpting, slave abuse, and murder. It is all one

to Lolth, who looks upon this sordid district and is pleased.

A1. Studio of Chael Qenos

The paintings of this mad drow are all the rage in Erelhei-

Cinlu, combining surrealistic images of suffering with such

exotic media as demon blood, powdered dragon scales, and the

skin of sacri cial victims. Chael Qenos (CE male drow expert

10/rogue 4, Craft [painting] +20) lives in this studio with a

small staff of assistants and slaves, growing more demented

as  his  popularity  soars.  When  asked  what  he  paints,  Chael

usually answers Fear, Anger, or Darkness.

In reality, many of Chaels paintings come from lifehe

uses the services of drow diabolists to travel to the Outer Planes

and observe  ends in their natural habitat. These expeditions

have grown more hazardous of late as Chael probes deeper

into the secrets of his artistic subjects. He is currently search-

ing for discreet sellswords who can protect him during his

expeditions, and Chael is willing to hire surface-dwellers and

other undesirables. The artist is as evil as he is mad. Anyone

who hires on might  nd herself marooned in the Abyss when

Chael takes a portal home, or she might become the subject

of one of his sadistic paintings.

A2. The House of Abandonment

Familial  love  is  an  alien  concept  to  the  drow,  who  believe

that a childs duty is to obey or overthrow her parents, while

parents  are  obligated  to  test  their  children  and  allow  only

the strong to survive. Drow children who survive the testing

but remain unwantedthe half-breeds, the lowborn, or the

simply rejectedusually end up in the House of Abandon-

ment or a similar institution. Sometimes, parents, relatives,

owners, and anyone else seeking to pro t from the disposal

of drow children sell them to house administrators, though

the price paid is minimal.

The House of Abandonment is a large, rambling structure

that  contains  many  hundreds  of  occupants  and  their  cruel

overseers. Orphaned and unwanted children are given mini-

mal food, shelter, and clothing and put through a merciless

training regimen, forced to obey the most trivial of commands

and  to  compete  with  each  other  for  survival.  Those  who

endure  the  abusive  conditions  and  emerge  from  the  house

are among the coldest and most ruthless drow imaginable.

True children of Lolth, they are greatly prized as  minions,

servants, and warriors.

A3. Tasaelas Raiment

One of the best known-seamstresses in Erelhei-Cinlu, Tasaela

(NE  female  drow  expert  13,  Craft  [sewing] +18)  has  grown

wealthy  selling  her  elaborate  garments  to  powerful  and

in uential drow. She commands a staff of two dozen slaves,

whom she works harshly with the help of her twin bugbear

overseers. Tasaela spends much of her time designing ever

more complex out ts and collecting the exotic and expensive

materials needed to produce them. She has been known to

hire outlanders to obtain spider silk, gemstones, demon hide,

and similar items.

Many  of  Tasaelas  garments  are  enchanted,  providing

Charisma bonuses and skill enhancements to their wearers.

Normally, she sells magic clothing only to drow, but she might

consider commissions for foreigners if they do her a large favor

or offer suf cient payment.

A4. Nyttoriss Arms and Armor

A slender, deceptively frail individual, Nyttoris (NE male drow

expert 10/wizard 6, Craft [armorsmithing] +20, Craft [weap-

onsmithing] +18) designs and creates many types of weapons

and armor in this shop. He maintains a stable of drow artisans

and troglodyte slaves to assist in the production of his items,

which are works of art in addition to being functional.

Like most drow, Nyttoris shuns the brutal, excessive designs

of  surface  races  (he   nds  dwarf  craftsmanship  especially

gauche),  preferring  slender,  elaborate  weapons  and  armor

that provide effects far greater than their appearance would

suggest. His black metal longswords, for example, are more

like rapiers, with delicate silver runes, complex basket hilts,

and inlaid gemstones, but they deal damage as if they were

far heavier weapons. Nyttoris is a skilled spellcaster, and his

items are almost always magical.

Non-drow are sometimes allowed to perform at the amphi-

theater,  though  they  run  the  same  risks.  Bards,  acrobats,

dancers, and the like from surface-dwelling races can seek

fame or infamy here.

A5. Poisons and Potions

P2. The Hall of Shadows

Lhazis Ulvira (CE male drow wizard 7/arachnomancer 6, Craft

[poisonmaking] +20) dwells in this shuttered structure with

many natural and magical spiders. His monstrous spider com-

panion, Xuklyr, is one of his most frightening minions, but the

place also swarms with adamantine spiders (see page 106) and

other vermin. Lhazis also has several potions of spider form (see

page 63) and usually drinks one before facing intruders.

Even other drow  nd the shop disturbing, and customers

never know if they will emerge from the building alive and

free of spiders. However, Lhazis is unquestionably one of the

 nest poisoners and potion-makers in the city. He also sells

spell components and, if he takes a special liking to a visitor,

he might be willing to bring her into the fold as a fellow arach-

nomancer. But Lhazis is chaotic, cruel, and entirely mad, and

no one can say for sure what he might do when approached.

GHETTO OF PERFORMERS

Decadence extends into every aspect of drow life, including

popular entertainment. This district, under the oversight of

House Aleval, is home to most drow actors, singers, dancers,

and other performers. Dark elf tastes are notoriously  ckle,

and a dancer or poet who is the toast of the town one day might

 nd himself the butt of jokes and cruel satire the next.

Unsuccessful performers usually drown their sorrows in

corrupt and debased activities. Indeed, the ghetto is a haven for

every imaginable vice, since drow performers are even more

decadent than typical members of their race. The district has

the highest consumption of narcotics and alcohol in Erelhei-

Cinlu, and House Aleval allows any substance to be bought

and sold here, as long as it receives a percentage. Drug dens,

brothels, taverns, torture parlors, and gladiatorial  ghting pits

exist alongside theaters, dance studios, and public squares.

P1. Performers Amphitheater

Some  scholars  claim  that  drow  society  is  the  fairest  in  the

world because each drow must rely on his or her talents to

succeed or fail, and individual achievement is valued above

all else. Most sane observers dispute this claim, but just such

a system is in place at the Performers Amphitheater.

The  amphitheater  is  a  public  plaza,  with  a  large  round

platform surrounded by sloping rows of seats. Any drow can

perform in any way he or she pleases, earning the approval or

the disdain of the gathered crowd. At almost any hour, drow

take to the stage, and performances range from lone poets and

singers to elaborate plays with large casts and extensive sets.

As might be expected, performing is a hazardous undertak-

ingdisappointed audiences are not shy about taking out their

frustrations on those who fail to provide suitable entertain-

ment. The fatality rate among performers is high. Recently, a

drow wizard spectator summoned a demon to devour an inept

mime, to the delight of the rest of the audience.

The notorious showman Chelos Valdren (NE male drow bard

12, Perform [acting] +18, Perform [comedy] +15, Perform [ora-

tory] +16)  manages  this  lush,  ornate  theater,  which  became

popular after other major establishments were destroyed in

the Priestess Wars. Rumor has it that Chelos himself torched

the Silver Stage, his chief rival, during the riots.

The Hall of Shadows features a cast of noted drow perform-

ers, and Chelos eagerly signs new talent to long-term contracts.

Shows range from concerts, plays, and operas to bloody cel-

ebrations of pain and erotic deviance, some of which draw the

audience into the vile activities. Bugbear custodians clean the

theater between performances.

Chelos  also  keeps  the  illusionist  Daelana  Shiquos  (CE

female  drow  illusionist]6,  Perform  [acting] +5)  as  a  highly

paid retainer (and, many claim, as a lover). One of the younger

members  of  House  Shiquos,  Daelana  has  scandalized  her

family by joining a theatrical troupe and squandering her

valuable magical talent by providing special effects and mood

enhancement during performances.

P3. The Silk Curtain

In Erelhei-Cinlu, bordellos are considered to be prime loca-

tions for artistic performances, and the Silk Curtain, under the

proprietorship of Thandaela Ethyss (CE female drow expert 15,

Diplomacy +11, Perform [acting] +14), is highly regarded in the

ghetto. Employees are trained in a wide range of performing

artsincluding singing, dancing, acting, and acrobaticsthat

feature strongly decadent and amorous qualities. The Curtains

acrobats are especially famous, and their performances fetch

high prices. In traditional drow style, the bordello is lush and

luxuriant, and virtually any intoxicant or illicit substance is

available to enhance and prolong a clients visit. Foreigners can

partake of the Curtains services, too, though sometimes they

are treated poorly. Capable outlanders might  nd employment

as guards or, occasionally, as entertainers.

P4. The Upturned Jar

Baenal Laziz (NE male drow expert 9) oversees a staff of inden-

tured drow and dispirited hal ing slaves in this dark, intimate

tavern, where customers can sample wines and intoxicants

extracted from a wide range of subterranean fungi and other

strange growths. Some expensive and rare potables are highly

addictive or poisonous (often both), but they provide drinkers

with enhanced senses or other temporary bene ts. It is not a

good night at the Jar if at least one patron does not succumb to

the establishments wares, ending up unconscious, paralyzed,

mindless,  or  dead.  In  fact,  customers  are  required  to  hold

Baenal and his staff harmless for any misfortune that might

befall them, and patrons whose minds are destroyed end up

washing dishes or cleaning out slops for the proprietor.

Baenal has few qualms about dealing with outlanders. He

frequently hires surface adventurers to collect exotic materials

or stand guard during especially busy periods.

P5. The Riskallus Agency

In  the  vicious  world  of  drow  performing  arts,  a  theatrical

agent   lls  many  roles.  First  and  foremost,  he  advocates  for

his clients, seeking out employers and negotiating lucrative

contracts. However, a drow agent must also protect his clients

against  the  predations  of  rival  performers,  which  requires

him to be a skilled spy and assassin. Such talents prove handy

whenever he needs to eliminate a competitor or sabotage a

performance.

Riskallus (LE male drow bard 5/expert 8/rogue 3, Bluff +16,

Diplomacy +18, Perform [acting] +11), one of the best-known

agents in the ghetto, maintains a large stable of popular per-

formers and ruthlessly negotiates contracts and performances

on their behalf. He is also a veteran scout and assassin, with

many operatives who keep tabs on nonclients. Riskallus stops

at nothing to recruit a fashionable new performer or sabotage

anyone who stands in his clients way. He uses threats, extor-

tion, and magic to secure good deals for his performers and to

destroy the careers of rivals. Other agents, of course, have little

fondness for Riskallus, and his daily existence is an elaborate

dance with death. Only the strong survive in his world, and

so far he has proven himself one of the strongest.

The Riskallus Agency is a small, tidy black building with

a simple sign and no outward indication of its importance.

Drow  and  mercenary  guards  watch  the  place  at  all  hours,

however, and Riskallus is aware of anyone who so much as

approaches  the  building.  His  enemies  occasionally  mount

assaults to bring down the agency, but so far their efforts have

failed. Fortunately for ghetto residents who live nearby, most

attempts to kill Riskallus are subtle and secretive.

As an agent, Riskallus does not discriminate. He hires drow

and  outlanders  as  performers  or  guards,  and  he  frequently

employs adventurers from the surface, since newcomers would

not be known to his foes.

P6. Costumers Guild

What are performers without costumes? To the vain and deca-

dent drow, costumes are an indispensable part of life, and the

Costumers Guild provides wild and outrageous raiment for

members of society and for the performers who work in the

ghetto. (The establishments name is something of a misno-

mer, because it implies the existence of a single such guild,

whereas others like it exist.)

Chief costumer Themos Eathen (LE male drow expert 18,

Profession  (tailor) +18)  has  designed  and  created  costumes

for nearly two centuries, and what he does not know about

the  trade  would   t  comfortably  in  a  thimble.  His  services,

and those of his costumers, tailors, and slaves, do not come

cheap, but they are worth every copper, so competition for

his work is intense.

Of course, decorative costumes are only part of the busi-

ness. Erelhei-Cinlus thriving criminal class takes advantage

of his expertise as well, and Themos is often hired to provide

disguises or duplicates of costumes, armor, or uniforms to aid

in various acts of deviltry. Because he works with each of the

eight ruling houses and with all major criminal organizations,

Themos is rarely called to answer for his activities, instead

growing richer and more arrogant each year. The only pur-

suit likely to land him in trouble one day is his willingness

to work with foreigners and surface adventurers, though he

tries to keep those dealings secret.

GHETTO OF SAVAGES

An especially rough and dangerous section of the city, the

Ghetto  of  Savages  falls  under  House  Despanas  authority.

The bulk of Erelhei-Cinlus non-drow warriors live here amid

violence and cruelty. Bugbears make up the majority of the

inhabitants, followed by troglodytes and trolls. The effective

rulers,  however,  are  the  yugoloths,  whose  relatively  small

numbers belie their power and in uence.

Most of the ghettos residents are slaves or indentured ser-

vants that are sworn to the drow noble houses. Some have won

their freedom but continue to live here, building new lives as

mercenaries or freelance adventurers.

Sa1. Ceremonial Arena

One of the most popular destinations in the city, this six-story

stone coliseum features bloody combat around the clock. The

arenas  entertainment  includes  traditional   ghts  between

individuals or teams, battles between gladiators and monsters

or wild animals, the torture and execution of prisoners and

escaped slaves, and training brawls between units of bugbears,

troglodytes, or other warrior races.

Once a year, the troglodytes that live in the ghetto use the

arena for their sacri cial rituals, in which captured foes or

slaves donated by the drow are dismembered and consumed.

This ceremony is followed by solemn mating rituals, the stench

and noise of which pollute the entire district.

Sa2. Hiring Hall

A substantial number of the districts savages work as freelance

contractors or mercenaries, and this large, forti ed structure

gives them a place to sell their services. The Hiring Hall has

no real central authority, though House Despana maintains

administrative of ces in the building and takes a cut of every

deal that is made.

Mercenaries  of  all  kinds  use  the  hall  to  negotiate  with

potential employersusually drow, but anyone with cash on

hand is welcome to seek hired muscle here. The hall bustles

with constant activity, and outlanders and surface-dwellers are

commonly encountered as both buyers and sellers. It is said

that if an employer waits long enough, almost any intelligent

creature will become available for hire.

Sa3. Bugbear Warrens

The servant races that dwell in the Ghetto of Savages live in

neighborhoods that resemble their traditional environments.

Most bugbears live here, among ramshackle houses and twist-

ing tunnels. Armed gangs keep order, and the place is a  lthy

labyrinth that reeks of mud and dung. Even young bugbears

are dangerous, and outlanders are advised to avoid the warrens

unless they are well armed or suicidal.

Sa4. Troglodyte Burrows

The  troglodytes  in  the  ghetto  live  entirely  underground.

Technically, that is true of all residents of Erelhei-Cinlu, but

the trogs dwell below the city, in caves that are slightly less

claustrophobic than the bugbear warrens. All trogs gather for

the annual mating rituals that take place in the Ceremonial

Arena. The rest of the time, males dwell in one portion of the

burrows, and females and young keep strictly to the other.

Woe unto a young trog that happens to wander into the males

section, for these creatures have no qualms about infanticide

or cannibalism.

Sa5. Troll Caverns

Erelhei-Cinlus small troll community lives in roomy caves and

stone huts designed to accommodate the creatures impressive

stature. Despite their low numbers, the trolls are second in

in uence only to the yugoloths, and most creatures avoid this

neighborhood altogether. Oddly, outlanders who come here

usually emerge with their lives, which is not the case in the

bugbear and troglodyte neighborhoods. The trolls are willing

to talk with visitors and even negotiate for services, well away

from the chaos of the Hiring Hall.

Sa6. Goblin Slums

By far the most numerous of the drow chattel are the pitiful

goblins, which are so ubiquitous that most of Erelhei-Cinlus

inhabitants learn to ignore them completely. Although many

goblins live in slave quarters provided by their owners, large

numbers dwell in these slums and make the daily trek to and

from their owners home or business. The streets of the slums

are lined with shacks, ruins, and tenements that are teeming

with goblins, packed with refuse, and plagued by vermin and

predators. No sensible being would live here voluntarily, but

the slums are the only home that these downtrodden goblins

know.  Some  of  the  few  free  goblins  in  Erelhei-Cinlu  have

relocated to the Ghetto of Outcasts, but that neighborhood is

not much of an improvement.

A few goblins are brave and resourceful enough to escape

from their owners, but they carry brands, scars, or other iden-

tifying marks, and runaway slaves have but one fate. Some

fugitive goblins are said to have made their way out of the

Vault of the Drow, while others simply wallow like animals

in the gutters and sewers of Erelhei-Cinlu.

Sa7. The Old Battleaxe

Bugbear warriors favor this run-down establishment as a place

to relax, knock back their favorite intoxicants, and gamble on

games of dice and spider  ghts. Tesha Rassilkra (CN female

bugbear   ghter  9,  Intimidate +12)  has  proven  herself  the

equal of males of her race in every endeavor from  ghting to

drinking, and she runs the Battleaxe as something of a benign

dictatorship. Tesha leaves the enforcement of the rules to her

dim-witted twin sons, Hurggaz and Vosh.

The most popular drinks at the Old Battleaxe include elf

blood, chieftains brew, and the dreaded battleaxe black,

which  can  render  nonbugbear  drinkers  unconscious.  Still,

members  of  other  races  who  visit  the  tavern   nd  that  the

regulars offer them a warm welcome.

Sa8. Yugoloth Barracks

Yugoloths occupy an unusual niche in drow society. Though

many yugoloths are summoned and bound into service, others

. . . while the privileged watch from high above

serve the drow willingly,  nding the harshness of Erelhei-

Cinlu preferable to that of their home plane, the Bleak Eternity

of Gehenna. Nycaloths and mezzoloths are the most common

types of yugoloth servants, but more powerful  ends such as

ultraloths can be found as advisors or boon companions to

elite drow, and lesser varieties such as skeroloths and canoloths

sometimes accompany their fellows into battle.

This wide, three-story structure houses most of the citys

nycaloths and mezzoloths, along with a handful of other yugo-

loths. More or less free agents, these  ends serve whomever

they choose, though their primary employers are the drow

noble houses. There are rules to their service, however. Yugo-

loths can take no action against clerics of Lolth, they cannot

 ght each other, and they can battle drow only when in the

employ of other drow. Beyond these restrictions, yugoloths

have free run of the city and are the ghettos most powerful

and respected faction.

Sa9. Fortress Despana

This grim, sprawling structure is the center of House Despanas

power in Erelhei-Cinlu, and the site where most of its warriors

receive their initial training. At any time, several hundred Des-

pana warriors, mages, rangers, and clerics dwell here, studying

famous  battles,  training  in  tactics  and  single  combat,  and

working on arms and armor. Although the surroundings are

distasteful to average drow, who shun the company of chattel,

all aspiring Despana warriors and military folk are expected to

serve here under the most in uential male in the household,

Lord Tymeth Despana (LE male drow  ghter 8/blackguard 8,

Diplomacy +12, Intimidate +20).

A  harsh  disciplinarian,  Tymeth  does  not  blink  when

recruits  perish  during  training.  Like  his  deity,  Tymeth

believes in culling the weak and leaving only the strong. But

he differs from other drow leaders in that he tries to instill

a sense of loyalty and obedience in his warriors. Most dark

elves are out for themselves, an attitude that renders them

ineffective in large-scale combat because they ignore orders

and betray one another. Tymeth knows that sel sh chaos is

no way to win battles, and as long as Despana warriors serve

under him, they are expected to work together, as distasteful

as that might seem.

This  philosophy,  along  with  a  harsh  training  regimen

that kills one out of every four recruits, has given Despana

the most powerful and respected military arm of any noble

house  in  Erelhei-Cinlu.  Tymeth  and  his  matron,  Shehirae,

chafe at House Tormtors dominance and hope to replace the

house one day by sheer force of arms. For now, however, they

cooperate with their rivals, and lend Tormtor troops to aid in

defending the city.

GHETTO OF CHATTEL

The majority of Erelhei-Cinlus slave trading takes place in

the Ghetto of Chattel, where vast pens and holding facilities

house  thousands  of  wretched  souls.  Business  never  closes

for the drow, and the ghetto sees constant activity as dark elf

nobles seek new household slaves, military commanders and

arena managers search for capable warriors, vampire lords pur-

chase breeding stock or fresh meat, wizards buy experimental

subjects, and priests  nd new sacri cial victims. The life of

a slave in Erelhei-Cinlu is short and miserable, and often the

95726720_Ch07.indd   205

2/22/07   3:38:15 PM

best that a captive who is sold here can hope for is a quick and

relatively painless death.

C1. Verdict Hall

This grim stone structure is the seat of drow justice, such as

it is. Of course, this justice is not for the drow themselves

household matriarchs and their subordinates render judgment

on the dark elves. The Verdict Hall is where foreigners who are

accused of crimes in Erelhei-Cinlu are kept and tried before

drow  judges.  (Actually,  many  outlanders  who  break  drow

edicts never see the inside of the building, because they are

slain or enslaved on the spot.)

The city has no real written code of law, only a rule that it

is illegal for a foreigner to interfere with a drow in any way.

Whether an outlanders course of action constitutes interfer-

ence is up to the guards who choose to make the arrest, and

whether the crime merits prosecution is up to the ruling house

of the ghetto where the arrest took place. There are only two

possible punishments for foreigners, death or enslavement,

and judges allow no appeals. Outlanders who are sentenced to

one of these fates should consider themselves lucky, because

among their own kind, the drow impose far more complex

and cruel punishments.

escaped slaves, and they usually leave enough of their victims

for Thog to claim his reward. On occasion, the ogre is also

called  upon  to   nd  outside  intruders,  such  as  troublesome

surface-dwellers.

C4. Slave Buyer

Buyer  is  an  adequate  term  for  Kholar  Nyborix  (NE  male

half-drow  ranger  8/rogue  4,  Hide +16,  Move  Silently +18,

Survival +15). He has risen to the top of a highly competitive

business, using his despised ethnic status to build a reputation

for hard bargaining and quality product. Not only does he buy

and sell slaves in his massive barred and walled compound, but

Kholar also leads slave raids into surrounding caverns. From

time to time, his slave-taking parties venture into the surface

world under the sponsorship of House Vae, expeditions that

have alarmed several of the other drow houses.

Kholar  is  perfect  for  surface  raids,  however,  because  his

mixed heritage helps him blend in with the natives, and his

cunning nature allows him to  nd victims and spirit them

away  with  almost  no  trace.  His  three  assistants,  the  twin

assassins/rogues  Rhela  and  Hylura  Fahm  and  the  sorcerer

Yhorimin, are considered to be the  nest team of slave-takers

in Erelhei-Cinlu, an honor that Kholar will kill to maintain.

C2. Menagerie Square

C5. The Silver Collar

This  public  plazas  name  re ects  the  drow  attitude  toward

slaves. To most dark elves, slaves are mere animalsposses-

sions  just  as  homes,  swords,  pets,  or  cattle  are.  Menagerie

Square abounds with buyers, sellers, guards, and hordes of

slaves. Transactions take place by auction, direct negotiation,

or bargaining, or as part of prearranged sales. Once a slave is

sold, trained branders use hot irons to sear the mark of the

new owner into the creatures  esh. Slaves who have multiple

brands are mistreated even more than usual, because the marks

are  proof  that  previous  owners  were  disappointed  in  their

performance and cast them out.

C3. Beast Trainer

Thog Norghast (N male ogre expert 8, Intimidate +13) is an

exceptionally intelligent ogre. Some claim that he has human

ancestry, a rumor that he denies violently. Once a slave, Thog

won  his  freedom  by  strangling  his  drow  master  with  his

chains, an act of rebellion that would normally earn a linger-

ing death. Fortunately for Thog, his slain master had powerful

enemies who chose to reward the ogre with freedoma highly

unusual step for the merciless drow.

Since that time, Thog has lived in the Ghetto of Chattel as

a slave (or beast) trainer, mimicking and further honing the

cruel techniques that were used on him. There is no trace of

irony or pity in the ogre, who has made a name for himself

as the best trainer in the city, and noble houses eagerly bring

him their chattel. Thog commands a staff of slaves who have

been through his training regimen and who now pass it along

to new captives.

In addition, Thog sells inexpensive arms and armor, and

he  works  as  a  slave  catcher,  hired  to  track  down  runaways

and either bring them back or slay them. His two  endish

spiders, Morax and Grez, are particularly skilled at  nding

The most exclusive brothel in Erelhei-Cinlu, the Silver Collar

counts members of the mightiest drow houses among its cli-

entele. A queens ransom in gems and precious metals changes

hands each night as customers try to outbid one another for

time with famous or exotic courtesans. Owner Jaelana Tryssqa

(CE female drow expert 8/sorcerer 6, Perform [acting] +15)

has managed the place for nearly a century, and she offers the

services of males and females of almost every imaginable race

and temperament. Though she puts slaves to work in many dif-

ferent capacities, Jaelanas brothel is unusual in that her star

performers are professionals under contract, able to negotiate

their prices and leave if they so choose. The brothels clients,

who are used to the attentions of downtrodden or excessively

obedient slaves,  nd this attitude stimulating.

C6. The Crop and Manacle

Another business that combines several functions, the Crop

and Manacle is an inn, a tavern, and a torture parlor, where

patrons  can  practice  the  painful  arts  on  willing  or  unwill-

ing victims. Here, the worst dark elf vices are indulged, so

much so that normal surface-dwellers  nd it hard to stay for

long.  Drinks  are  plentiful  and  cheap,  the  rooms  are  pleas-

antly appointed, and the torment of victims can take place in

secluded private chambers or in more public locations, usually

observed by an enthusiastic audience.

GHETTO OF OUTCASTS

This  lthy district is the last destination for drow undesirables,

including criminals, beggars, half-breeds, and the survivors

of fallen noble houses. House Xaniqos has dominion over the

ghetto, and in typical fashion, Lady Thandysha has ambitious

plans for its use. Her agents have purchased several local tav-

erns and brothels, and she recruits the neighborhoods more

skilled residents as killers, spies, and guards.

The  rest  of  the  drow  in  Erelhei-Cinlu  shun  the  district,

leaving  its  inhabitants  to  their  own  devices.  In  return,  the

residents have created a nightmarish society ruled by criminal

gangs and brutal thugs. From time to time, a talented resident

rises up from the grinding poverty and regains in uence in

the city, but for the most part, the downtrodden drow of the

ghetto remain oppressed, poor, and utterly without hope.

Foreigners sometimes visit the ghetto, and a handful even

live here. Ironically, compared to other districts in the city,

the Ghetto of Outcasts is relatively safe for outlanders because

common drow ignore the district, and residents are too far

gone to care who they rub shoulders with.

O1. Guild of the Poxbearers

The  lth and vermin so prevalent in the Ghetto of Outcasts

sometimes cause outbreaks of terrible diseases, and few sick-

nesses are as dreaded as the suppurating pox (see the sidebar).

Victims of the pox waste away for months or years, prone to

weakness,  fevers,  and  convulsions.  Meanwhile,  their   esh,

cratered  by  boils  and  weeping  sores,  almost  literally  melts

away in long, stringy tendrils.

Magical  cures  by  clerics  of  deities  other  than  Lolth  are

forbidden in Erelhei-Cinlu, so most victims of the pox must

deal with its debilitating effects on their own. These victims,

known as poxbearers, have formed a beggars guild and use

their illness to improve their quality of lifehowever little of

it remains. The guild runs a fairly straightforward protection

racket. Bands of poxbearers wander the streets, demanding

payment from passersby. Since the pox is highly contagious,

the implied (or overt) threat is that those who fail to contribute

will be forcibly infected and consigned to a hideous death.

Almost anyone who has spare coins gladly gives them up in

the hope of avoiding such a fate.

There is a bene t to aiding poxbearers as well, since the dis-

ease is said to grant divine (or possibly profane) prescience to

its victims, allowing them to see the future. Generous donors

are  given  a  brief  and  usually  obscure  prophecy,  and  those

who part with fewer coins receive a bleaker vision of their

futureoften, the revelation that they will become victims

of the suppurating pox and die in agony.

The guildhouse is a surprisingly pleasant-looking villa, kept

in good repair by skilled poxbearers. Residents of the neighbor-

hood give the place a wide berth, out of fear of contagious guild

members and their leader, said to be a victim of the disease who

perished and was raised as an undead creature. Supposedly,

the foul being now uses the pox as a weapon to gain power for

itself and its followers. The rumor has never been con rmed,

but it is plausible enough to keep outlanders away.

O2. The Snake and Weasel

Plenius Greysoul (NE male half-drow rogue 9) has lived in

the Ghetto of Outcasts all his life. A talented thief and fence,

he pulls the strings of many thugs and alley-bashers who call

the district home, and he specializes in returning stolen goods

to their owners. Of course, he is usually responsible for the

thefts in the  rst place, and he charges exorbitant prices for

the items return. Even if Plenius does not have a given stolen

item for sale, odds are that he knows where it is, and he will

part with this information for a price.

Sharing his good fortune with the residents of the ghetto,

Plenius  has  turned  the  Snake  and  Weasel  into  one  of  the

more tolerable eating and drinking establishments around.

It  attracts  a  relatively  nonviolent  clientele  by  discouraging

brawls, crime, and mayhem within its walls. Plenius enforces

the rules through his bugbear and half-ogre bouncers, all of

which are accomplished warriors.

O3. The Demons Den

Brutal thugs lurk in the ghettos alleys, but slightly more prin-

cipled rogues and swashbucklers hold sway in certain parts of

the neighborhood. Known as rakes, they are usually half-drow

or (rarely) full-blooded outcasts from their families, united

by a desire to change their societythough exactly how to

accomplish that change remains a bone of contention.

The  rakes  have  several  favored  watering  holes,  foremost

among  them  the  Demons  Den,  which  attracts  clients  who

are relatively pleasant (and, on rare occasions, non-evil). They

gather to talk, drink, gamble, brawl in good-natured fashion,

and  discuss  the  inequities  of  drow  society.  Their  informal

leader is Zaetha (CE female drow rogue 6/assassin 2, Move

Silently +14), an outcast said to worship fallen drow deities

that were powerful before the rise of Lolth. The Den is also

a favored haunt for the chaotic advocates of Zinzerena (see

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

THE SUPPURATING POX

This terrifying illness, the scourge of the Ghetto of Outcasts,

is widely thought to be incurable. That belief is not true, but it

keeps the districts residents in a constant state of fear, which

House Xaniqos manipulates to its advantage.

Suppurating  Pox:  Contact,  DC 22,  incubation  1 day,  1d4

Con/1d6  Cha.  If  the  victim  makes  two  successful  Fortitude

saves in succession, the disease is arrested but not cured, and

any Constitution and Charisma losses persist until cured. When

the disease is arrested, the victim remains contagious.

A successful remove disease spell eliminates the pox and cures

the  victim.  However,  it  is  a  capital  offense  for  anyone  other

than a cleric of Lolth to cast divine magic, and House Xaniqos

strictly forbids clerics from curing non-drow without express

permission.

Rumor has it that Xaniqos possesses the formula for a mun-

dane cure that can be created from relatively simple materials.

The release of such a cure could trigger open rebellion in the

ghetto and perhaps lead to the fall of House Xaniqos. Naturally,

other drow houses would pay a steep price to learn if the rumor

is true, and the nobles would be grateful (or at least as grateful

as dark elves can be) toward anyone who digs up information

on the supposed cure.

page 34), and casual visitors should be on guard when both

groups are here at the same time.

Although  many  rakes  are  less  hostile  than  full-blooded

dark elves, it would be a mistake to think of them as any less

violent, mercurial, or evil. Exceptions do exist, but most rakes

are just as cruel as drow in other parts of the city.

O4. The Hideaway

Erelhei-Cinlu is full of creatures on the run, whether from

their own kind or from the drow. On the outside, the Hideaway

is an ordinary inn located in an especially tawdry, run-down

section of a tawdry, run-down district, but it also serves as a

refuge for those on the lam.

Proprietor Melash Dvalla (N male half-drow expert 9/rogue

4, Diplomacy +13) is not running a charity. He charges steep

fees  for  his  services,  in  part  because  much  of  his  income

goes  to  drow  of cials  and  soldiers,  whom  he  pays  to  look

the other way. The true purpose of the Hideaway is an open

secret throughout the ghetto, but most residents know not

to discuss it overtly.

The establishment is as pleasant as possible, considering

the neighborhood. The food and drink is bad but not too bad,

the dining room is  lthy but not too  lthy, and the games are

crooked but not too crooked. Melash provides ordinary rooms

for  5  sp  per  night,  but  his  real  business  involves  a  number

of well-hidden chambers that the authorities either cannot

 nd or are paid to ignore. The secret chambers are relatively

comfortable, given that occupants must spend many hours or

days there, and they cost up to 100 gp per day, depending on

the nature of the customers offense and the size of the bribes

Melash must pay to keep him safe.

GHETTO OF THE DEAD

Once widely believed to be dead itself, House Eilservs, whose

schemes on the surface world led to disaster, now controls this

dark and horrifying district of Erelhei-Cinlu. The Ghetto of

the Dead, also called the Necropolis, is a  tting locale for the

fallen house and its still-ambitious leader.

Long ago, the ghetto was a traditional place of the dead,

known for its mausoleums, cemeteries, and tombs. But drow

necromancers  started  coming  here  to  experiment,  raising

corpses of the recently deceased to do their bidding. In the

end, the ghetto became a place of the walking dead, and con-

ventional interment of corpses was  nally abandoned.

Most drow avoid the district, venturing into the ghetto only

when they must dispose of mortal remains. Bodies are depos-

ited according to varying degrees of ceremony, depending on

the importance of the deceased. Once the mourners depart, the

districts permanent residentsthe hungry undeaddescend

to feast upon the corpses.

Ghouls are the most common inhabitants of the ghetto, but

vampires and necromancers are the unof cial rulers. Once a

year, the ghouls are allowed out of the district to terrorize Erel-

hei-Cinlu in a ritual known as the Time of the Hunters. Most

drow barricade themselves in their estates or homes during

this time, but the ravenous horde overcomes many security

measures, and the event results in many deaths.

D1. Necropolis Square

This grim plaza is surrounded by eight unadorned obelisks,

one for each of the citys noble families. The obelisks do not

bear family crests because of the frequency with which the

drow houses fall and are replaced. Recarving the crests would

be a pointless waste of time and effort.

Beyond the plaza sprawl the warrens of the dead, full of

ghouls and other rotting creatures. Here, the dearly departed

receive the closest thing to a funeral that a dark elf ever gets, as

mourners arrive, lay the corpse on a marble slab, intone prayers

and invocations, and leave as quickly as possible.

The end of a drows mortal existence is no more pleasant

than the rest of her life. Once the mourners have departed

the  plaza  and  closed  the  gates  behind  them,  the  ghouls

emerge from their hiding places and swarm each fresh corpse,

viciously  ghting for position. The body is ripped asunder,

the  esh quickly consumed, and the bones cracked open for

marrow  and  scattered  throughout  the  district.  The  ghouls

understand their part in the ritual and restrain themselves

from feasting until the mourners are safely away. The crea-

tures also keep Necropolis Square clear of bones and stray

body parts.

D2. Osseus Tower

Several  ghetto  residents  are  necromancers  who  shun  their

fellow  drow  and  prefer  to  keep  company  with  the  dead.

The  most  notorious  is  Morresus  (CE  male  lich  wizard  16,

Concentration +20, Spellcraft +20), a drow lich whose tower

rises from the ghetto like an enormous bony  nger. In fact,

his undead minions built the structure out of half-chewed

bones that were strewn about the district, and the tower is a

disturbing sight.

Most of the undead that dwell near the tower are under the

lichs control and keep themselves busy on his various inscru-

table errands. They ignore passersby unless Morresus requires

living subjects for his latest experiments or as new members

of his undead horde. Ghetto residents think that Morresus is

biding his time while he gathers power, preparing for the day

when he will try to seize control of the districtand possibly

all of Erelhei-Cinlu.

D3. Sarcoma Keep

This keep was once a massive mausoleum for a wealthy drow

family whose name is now forgotten. Since the undead took

over the ghetto, the mausoleum has housed a succession of

necromancers and autonomous undead, eventually gaining

its current moniker. The keep remains an imposing and for-

bidding structure, its black crenellated walls rising up four

full stories.

The current occupant is Khovad (CE male half-drow vam-

pire  ghter 13, Intimidate +20), a former minion of the vampire

warlord Telagos. Khovad turned against his master and led

other  servants  in  revolt,  destroying  the  older  creature  and

taking over the keep. Khovad has become every bit as ruth-

less and violent as his old master, maintaining a network of

mortal outcasts of various races and a complement of undead

troll bodyguards.

Khovad hopes to establish the  rst undead noble house in

Erelhei-Cinlu. His undead status and his half-breed heritage

are strong handicaps, but so far they have not prevented him

from  becoming  one  of  the  most  powerful  warlords  in  the

ghetto.

D4. The Black Chalice

Mourners are not the only living visitors to the Ghetto of the

Dead. Some bored drow seek exotic relief for their jaded senses

in the districts handful of taverns, inns, and brothels. Most

establishments are run by vampires, liches, or other self-willed

undead, who see the possibility of pro t and the chance to

recruit a few customers to their hordes of followers.

The best-known tavern is the Black Chalice, located near

Necropolis  Square.  It  is  owned  by  a  former  drow  priestess

named Nyvaela (NE female drow vampire cleric 10, Bluff +15),

who  enjoys  her  status  as  a  leading  member  of  the  ghettos

undead community. Her clientele are among the most deca-

dent drow in Erelhei-Cinlu, willing to sample horri c potions,

share the company of undead lovers, and put their lives and

souls on the line in games of chance. Nyvaela has grown rich

catering  to  such  tastes,  and  the  interior  dcor  of  the  Black

Chalice rivals that of the  nest public houses in the Ghetto

of Artisans. Guests are advised to be wary, however, for some

patrons never return from a night at the Chalice.

D5. The Grim Ghost

Ordinarily, only the mad or the powerful try to live in the

Ghetto of the Dead. But a hardy few see it as a place where the

drow have little in uence, and therefore a place where they can

live relatively free from the tyranny of the dark elves. One such

resident is Aenyrra (NG female elf ranger 10, Survival +16),

a surface elf who has chosen to make her home among the

walking dead. While on the run from drow authorities, she

tried to lose herself in the ghetto, only to learn that a small

but  determined  group  of  mortalsadventurers,  explorers,

outcast  drow,  mages,  and  the  likewere  trying  to  survive

there. Gathering a number of odd allies, Aenyrra turned the

former home of an undertaker into the Grim Ghost, an estab-

lishment that caters to the living.

Comfortable and well maintained, the Grim Ghost provides

food, drink, entertainment, and shelter for warm bodies, along

with a measure of protection from the undead. Aenyrra and

her partnersa half-drow rogue named Leixaes, the hal ing

brothers Thad and Emond, and (most unusual of all) the ghost

of the ancient drow warrior Maeletaruswelcome any and

all living customers.

At considerable expense, Aenyrra had the buildings doors

and windows treated with cleric spells and blessings to ward

off the undead. The effects were supposed to last for a decade

or longer, but she periodically pays drow clerics to renew the

protections. Aebyrra also employs a small team of professional

ghoul-hunters who have managed to keep her guests safe from

the shambling creaturesso far.

Encounters in

Erelhei-Cinlu

The  rest  of  this  chapter  presents  encounters  that  visiting

adventurers might have in the grand city of the dark elves.

These  encounters  are  not  tied  to  any  speci c  adventure  or

sequence of events, though you can develop them further and

add subplots as desired. For instance, perhaps the slaver Valma

Pharaen (see Slaver Attack, below) catches sight of the PCs and

wrongly assumes that they will be easy victims, or maybe a

scheming drow noble lures the adventurers into con ict with

the slaver to weaken them or take them out entirely.

The encounters are intended to take place in Erelhei-Cinlu,

but you can adapt the descriptions to suit other drow settle-

ments in your campaign.

SLAVER ATTACK (EL 8)

The drow slaver Valma Pharaen, his sister Jhaelmin, and a

squad of bugbears roam the neighborhood, following up on

a rumor that outlanders are in the vicinity.

The young son of a minor house, Valma hopes to make a

name  for  himself  in  the  female-dominated  city  by  captur-

ing and enslaving surface adventurers. His younger sister is

annoyed that a mere male presumes to hold so much authority

in their small household, but she goes along with his plans,

waiting for him to make a mistake so that she can take his

place.

So far, the siblings and their bugbear slaves have captured a

number of unwary surface merchants and their bodyguards.

These successes have increased Valmas con dence, making

him more likely to underestimate the strength of the player

characters.  However,  both  Valma  and  Jhaelmin   ee  if  the

bugbears  are  defeated  or  slain.  Neither  has  any  particular

familial affection for the other. If one of them is captured, he

or she offers the PCs a reward to chase down and defeat the

other treacherous sibling.

This encounter takes place when the PCs travel through

Erelhei-Cinlu.  Successful  DC 10  Spot  checks  and  Listen

checks allow the characters to notice that all traf c has sud-

denly disappeared from the street as civilians, merchants, and

slaves  ee from the coming  ght.

To trigger this encounter, read:

Just moments ago, this area was bustling with activity. But now you

notice the derro merchants hurriedly pushing their carts down the

street, ordinary drow averting their eyes and quickening their pace,

and goblin slaves scurrying madly into side alleys.

Suddenly, the stern voice of a male drow breaks the tension. Out-

landers! Lay down your weapons and surrender! I declare you to be

slaves, justly claimed by the faithful servants of Lolth!

The  street  is  rough  and  uneven.  Anyone  who  tries  to  run

or  charge  must  make  a  successful  DC 10  Balance  check  or

stumble and fall prone.

Stone buildings line both sides of the street. The PCs can

scale them with successful DC 20 Climb checks. Several build-

ings feature ledges about 20 feet above the ground by windows

that were bricked over long ago. Anyone who climbs to a ledge

can stand on it and  re missile weapons to the street below

by making a successful DC 12 Balance check. A climber who

fails the check must immediately attempt a DC 15 Balance

check. Success on the second check means that the character

maintains her footing but cannot  re a weapon in this round.

Failure indicates that the character loses her balance and falls

off the ledge.

If any PCs are captured by the slavers, Valma con scates

their possessions and has them taken to the Ghetto of Chattel,

where they are imprisoned in the compound run by Kholar

Nyborix (see Slave Buyer, page 206). Party members who avoid

capture must rescue their comrades before they are sold into

slavery and possibly taken out of the city, out of the Underdark,

or even to another plane.

If  all  the  PCs  are  captured  and  sent  to  the  compound,

they  must   gure  out  a  way  to  escape  and  retrieve  their

possessions.

Valma is content to let his sister and their bugbear slaves do

the  ghting. The bugbears are trained to capture foes alive, and

Valma tries to assist them from a distance with his spell-like

he will treat his dagger or rapier with drow sleep poison and

try to stab one of the PCs or deal nonlethal damage.

Jhaelmin  has  been  commanded  to  aid  her  brother  in  his

endeavors,  a  humiliating  position  for  a  female  drow.  Thus,

her assistance is less than enthusiastic, and if the opportu-

nity arises, she will let Valmar perish and take credit for the

capture  herself.  In  the  meantime,  she  hangs  back  during

combat,  letting  her  brother  and  the  bugbears  do  the   ght-

ing, half-heartedly casting a spell or two so she seems like an

active participant.

Of course, since Valmar is also trying to stay out of combat,

the siblings will realize the truth of the situation before long.

At that point, one or both of them will join the battle, if only to

make the other look bad. However, if the PCs gain the upper

hand, both drow try to run awayin opposite directions. If

NECROPOLIS SQUARE (EL 6+)

The adventurers might be in the Ghetto of the Dead to pursue

a foe, meet with an informant, or simply continue their explo-

ration  of  the  city.  Eventually,  they  come  upon  Necropolis

Square and observe a hasty drow funeral. The PCs will pos-

sibly not realize that ghouls lurk in the ruins that surround

the square, waiting to consume the deceased. The swarm of

undead should come as a surprise.

This encounter takes place when the PCs pass by Necropolis

Square in the Ghetto of the Dead. They can see through the

gates that a group of drow is holding a funeral in the middle

of the plaza.

To trigger this encounter, read:

You stand before a vast courtyard ringed with iron gates. In the center

of the plaza, within a circle of towering obelisks, two dozen or more

drow crowd around a huge marble slab. On it lies the motionless form

of a dark elf. At the foot of the slab, a priestess raises her arms and

intones, Now we lay to rest our brother, ever faithful to the Queen

of Spiders, to his matron, and to his house, as loyal in death as he

was in life. Hail Lolth!

Then, with surprising haste, the mourners depart the courtyard,

exiting through a wrought iron gate on the other side. The drow pull

the gate shut behind them; it swings closed with a rusty shriek and

then locks tight with a loud clang.

Suddenly, low moans begin to issue from all around you. Human-

oid shapes stir in the shadowy ruins that surround the courtyard,

shambling toward the marble slab and its lifeless inhabitant.

the bugbears to kill the adventurers instead.

If the PCs try to attack the mourners before they leave the

courtyard, remind the players that there are at least two dozen

drow,  many  of  whom  look  formidable.  If  the  adventurers

attack anyway, let them  ght for a few rounds. Before long,

the drow, who know that the hungry ghouls will not restrain

themselves forever, try to withdraw from battle and leave the

foolish intruders to their fate.

As soon as the gate clangs shut, a dozen ghouls rise out of

rubble at the positions shown on the map and move toward

the altar. If they reach the corpse, they begin feeding on it. If

the ghouls retreat before they  nish consuming the body, the

PCs can inspect it, but they  nd nothing unusual about the

dead drow. He seems to have been a noble, and he departed the

world with nothing but a black burial shroud. The pragmatic

dark elves do not waste valuables on the deceased.

The PCs can try to conceal themselves in the courtyard, but

eventually they are almost certain to be discovered. Since the

ghouls prefer the  esh of the living, they immediately abandon

the drow corpse and move to attack the party.

The altar is 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 4 feet high. A char-

acter  on  top  of  the  altar  gains  the  bene t  of   ghting  from

higher ground (PH 151).

Eight obelisks of polished black stone surround the altar.

Each obelisk is approximately 80 feet tall and can be scaled

with a successful DC 25 Climb check.

The  rubble  that  surrounds  Necropolis  Square  is  all  that

remains of ancient burial sites, stretching into the gloom in

all directions. No longer used by the drow, they are home to

the ghouls. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square

of dense rubble. If the PCs move through the rubble, the DCs

of their Balance checks and Tumble checks increase by 5, and

the DCs of their Move Silently checks increase by 2.

At  rst, a dozen ghouls enter Necropolis Square, but you can

adjust their number based on the partys current strength. Once

the PCs defeat what you consider to be an appropriate number

of ghouls, the others retreat into the ruins, but they continue

to shadow the party throughout the Ghetto of the Dead.

ARENA BATTLE

If the PCs spend much time in Erelhei-Cinlu, they might even-

tually  nd themselves in the Ceremonial Arena (see page 203),

 ghting for gold, notoriety, or their lives. Death in the arena

is a common sentence for foreigners tried before drow judges,

or the PCs might volunteer for gladiatorial combat, hoping

to grow rich and famous by defeating all comers. Either way,

the  arena  has  great  potential  for  player  characters  who  are

oriented toward combat.

This encounter is different from the others in this chapter.

Rather than detailing speci c foes, it describes potential oppo-

nents, hazards, and traps that PCs in the arena might confront.

The overall map of the arena is only one possible con gu-

ration. For each battle, the drow determine a speci c combat

area and place obstacles and traps in cunning locations.

MATCHES AND OPPONENTS

Gladiatorial combat is one of the many ways that the drow

have  turned  death  into  entertainment.  These  battles  occur

for various reasonscondemned criminals are sentenced to

perish in the arena, slaves are bred speci cally for combat, and

foolhardy outlanders or bored drow nobles enter willingly to

 nd wealth, fame, or a spectacular death.

The different scenarios and settings for arena combat are

a  tribute  to  the  ingenuity  of  the  dark  elves.  Some  popular

scenarios are described below, but they represent only a few

of the possibilities.

One on One

The  most  basic  and  popular  arena  confrontation  pits  two

individuals  against  each  other  in  a   ght  to  the  death.  The

battle is not necessarily fair, thoughthe drow have no real

concept of such things. Depending on the mood of the dark

elves, a combatant might  nd himself equally matched, or he

might be expected to slay an inferior opponent to please the

bloodthirsty crowd. Worst of all, the gladiator might be the

one intended as the sacri ce, struggling to overcome a vastly

superior foe.

Dual Team

In this scenario, two teams of two combatants each face off.

Usually, all four gladiators  ght at the same time, but now and

then the drow impose rules that permit only one combatant

at a time from each side. Sometimes, teams are experienced

arena  ghters with their own retinue, assistants, and fans in

the stands. Other times, teams are thrown together at the last

moment, and a bugbear barbarian might be forced to partner

with  a  goblin  rogue.  The  drow  also  enjoy  putting  mortal

enemies  on  the  same  team,  forcing  them  to  work  together

and come to each others aidand then, if they are victorious,

 ghting each other to the death.

Team Battle

Larger teams of up to ten members per side are popular because

of the increased bloodshed. As with dual teams, these larger

groups are often assembled immediately before the combat,

resulting in odd combinations.

The  drow  exploit  the  many  possibilities  of  large  team

battles. For example, a team made up of creatures of the same

race or characters of the same class might face a team of their

opposites. Battles involving three or four teams always draw

an enthusiastic crowd, eager to watch alliances be forged and

broken  from  moment  to  moment,  resulting  in  particularly

enjoyable carnage.

Last Creature Standing

This free-for-all melee pits a dozen or more combatants against

one another. The battle continues until a single victor emerges,

or until all the participants are dead.

Humanoid against Monster

Terrain

A single powerful creature is led into the arena. How many

attackers will it slay before it is  nally brought down? Slaves,

prisoners, and gladiators of steadily increasing skill are sent in to

battle the monster. The drow wager on the results, increasing or

decreasing their bets as the odds change with each new engage-

ment. This scenario usually involves creatures that are exotic,

rare, or dangerous; the dark elves especially enjoy watching a

mighty creature of good alignment meet an ignoble end.

Training

Watching warriors train is a spectator sport in Erelhei-Cinlu.

When the warriors are drow, their training consists of slaying

helpless opponents (to promote ruthlessness) and  ghting well-

armed foes (to promote martial skill and the survival instinct).

Victims in these scenarios are slaves or captives who have been

sentenced to death. Sometimes, for variety, the drow pit squads

of warriors from two noble houses against each other, with the

survivors earning promotions and better living conditions.

The  fact  that  these  battles  might  weaken  the  citys  overall

military strength does not seem to bother the dark elves. On

the contrary, they think that weeding out inferior warriors

can only improve their ability to defend the city.

OBSTACLES AND TRAPS

At  rst glance, the Ceremonial Arena is a smooth expanse of

sand, cleaned and raked by slaves after each battle. However,

hidden beneath the sand are traps and obstacles intended to

make the  ghts more interesting. As the DM, you can choose

and place items carefully before combat begins, or you can roll

randomly during a match to see what might come into play.

Once an item emerges, it might continue to affect the combat-

ants, or it might disappear after one use, only to be replaced

by a different nefarious device.

Walls

The arena is  tted with a series of 5-foot-thick, 20-foot-high

stone walls to create a labyrinth or a channeled battle eld.

The  walls  can  also  move  during  a  match,  abruptly  forcing

combatants to change their tactics and cutting gladiators off

from allies and routes to safety.

Triggered Column

When a combatant steps on a buried trigger, a 5-foot-square

stone column shoots up out of the sand to a height of 20 feet.

The combatant is lifted into the air atop the column and must

make a successful DC 18 Re ex save to keep his footing. If he

falls off, he lands in a random square adjacent to the column,

takes 2d6 points of damage, and is prone.

In a variation on this obstacle, several adjacent 5-foot-square

columns can rise together to form a wall. In addition, the wall

might have gaps to channel subsequent combat.

Triggered Column

CR 2

Mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Reflex DC 18

avoids fall; 20 ft. tall (2d6, fall); Search DC 21 from

adjacent square locates; Disable Device DC 20

deactivates.

Forests, mountains, swamps, and lakes can be recreated in the

con nes of the arena. The terrain is laid out so as to block as

little of the spectators view as possible, but otherwise, any-

thing goes. You can create any layout desired, with each terrain

type occupying one or more 5-foot squares. Try using trees,

undergrowth, sand dunes, bogs, ice, and more (see the terrain

descriptions in Wilderness Adventures, DMG 8792).

In addition, consider placing any of the following obstacles

in the arena.

Rubble: It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square

of  dense  rubble.  The  DCs  of  Balance  checks  and  Tumble

checks increase by 5, and the DCs of Move Silently checks

increase by 2.

Low Wall: These stone walls are 3 to 4 feet high and pro-

vide cover (PH 151).

Low Rise: The drow like to create low hills by packing

sand and debris over the piled corpses of the slain. Combat-

ants who stand on a low rise gain the bene t of  ghting from

higher ground (PH 151).

Monsters

Now and then, it suits the drows sadistic sense of humor to set

monsters loose in the arena during a match. The dark elves can

release anything from nuisance creatures, such as swarms of

rats or bats, to deadlier threats, such as yugoloths, minotaurs,

ropers, slimes, and other subterranean beasts. The creatures

can be magically transported to the battleground or released

through doors hidden around the arena.

Traps

Various traps can be located anywhere in the arena, and they

are rarely in the same place twice. Prior to a battle involving the

PCs, you can place traps on the map at the locations marked T

or anywhere else you desire. Feel free to use any trap described

in Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. However, it is best

to choose traps that have a relatively low Challenge Rating,

since such traps are designed to frustrate and confuse, rather

than to kill outrightthe gladiators are expected to take care

of that. Common choices include pit traps of all varieties (up

to 20 feet deep), fusillades of darts, in ict light wounds traps,

net traps, and hails of needles.

The drow come up with all manner of devious and novel traps,

and so should you. Two unusual traps are described below.

Scythe Trap

CR 2

Mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Atk +8 melee

(1d8/3); Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 20. Four

scythes spring out from a pillar and spin, attacking

anyone in adjacent squares.

Whirling Chain Trap

CR 4

Mechanical; location trigger; automatic reset; Atk +20 melee

(2d4+8/4, scythe); Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 18.

Two spiked chains with heavy clubs spring out and spin

around the trap, attacking anyone in adjacent squares.

Appendix:

For Player Characters

The  drow  make  for  a  frustrating  and  deadly  foe  for  player

characters with their gamut of magical abilities, twisted plots

and manipulations honed and re ned by their own society,

and tricks and traps that have had centuries to be developed

and perfected. In addition, they are typically found in one

of the most hostile environments in a campaign worldthe

Underdark.

The dark elves have been the bogeymen of the DUNGEONS &

DRAGONS game since their  rst appearance in 1978s Dungeon

Module G3: Hall of the Fire Giant King. Since that time they have

consistently both captivated and terrorized players ranging

from the vilest of villains to the noblest of heroes. Unlike the

majority of this books material, this appendix is for the players.

Its purpose is to help players handle encounters with hostile

drow and live to tell of it as well as help them to successfully

roleplay drow as player characters.

DROW AS FOES

The dangers to a party of adventurers in the Underdark come

from all quarters and in every size and shape imaginable, but

never far from the mind is the omnipresent threat of the drow.

Nothing brings forth loathing and fear like the thought of

an encounter with the dark elves in the cold tunnels of the

earth, and it is well known that in their own environment

an unexpected encounter with drow is likely to end badly

for  adventurers.  Nevertheless,  although  most  adventurers

say  a  prayer  to  their  respective  gods  for  avoidance  of  the

drow before plunging into the endless night, those wishing

to trust to more than luck or the whim of a deity have given

long thought and used battle-tested experience to come up

with countermeasures against this implacable foe of all sur-

face dwellers.

From the deep halls of  re giant kings to mountain passes

of dwarf kingdoms to great cities hidden in cysts below the

earth, the drow can be found in just about any setting at any

time  and  always  represent  a  terrible  danger.  However,  it  is

widely known that as formidable as they are if encountered

on the surface, the drow are much more to be feared when in

their natural environment of lightless caverns and constric-

tive stone passages. Therefore, this appendix will primarily

deal with methods for countering the drow in an Underdark

environment  where  they  are  at  their  greatest  advantage.

These methods can largely be transferred for use in surface

encounters as well, where the light of sun or moon and the

great wide-open expanses unknown in the Underdark further

reduce the dark elves effectiveness.

First and foremost in combating the drow is the need for

sight. Unless a party is full of characters who have the Blind-

Fight feat and are ready and willing to miss on a signi cant

portion  of  their  attacks  due  to  concealment,  then  they  are

going to want to be able to see in the dark. That said, Blind-

Fight is an excellent feat to have as a backup in case things

dont go according to plan and a character does  nd himself

 ghting in the dark.

To counter the effects of darkness, the party should come

equipped with darkvision, either naturally or through use of

magic. Low-light vision is useful but probably will not cut it

in the lightless environment of the Underdark. A must for all

adventurers who are or might be facing drow is the daylight

spell. It provides an incomparable advantage against the dark

elves, rendering them blinded for the  rst round and dazzled

every round thereafter that they remain within its area. Every

ambush on drow should begin with a daylight spell, and even

if the party  nds itself on the receiving end of a drow ambush

(a much more likely prospect), the  rst thought even before

taking  cover  should  be  the  use  of  daylight,  because  it  buys

time and reduces the ambushers effectiveness. However, a

single daylight spell is probably not enough, since it can be

countered by deeper darkness or by a single ambusher with a

readied action to disrupt spellcasters. Therefore, preparation

of multiple daylight spells is a must. The inexpensive daylight

pellets (see page 101) are especially useful in this regard.

THE UNPREPARED PARTY

When battle with drow begins, tactics differ depending on

whether the PCs were prepared for the encounter. If they are

in the Underdark, they should be prepared and at the very

least have a daylight spell available. If a party has not prepared,

then  an  organized  retreat  is  usually  the  best  option  unless

the characters are able to quickly discern that they are facing

an inferior force that is easily dealt with. And with drow, if

it looks like youre facing an inferior force that is easily dealt

with, then thats probably just what they want you to think, and

they actually are not. Retreat, preferably covered by a daylight

spell, is probably the best option.

If the party is able tell where the leader of the drow force

is, then some sort of ranged area effect just to keep her busy

might be in order as a parting shot. A spell such as cloudkill

is ideal in that it does not allow spell resistance, it forces the

target(s) to move to get out of its way, and it provides conceal-

ment to retreat under. In conjunction with a daylight spell,

this attack can be particularly effective against a temporarily

blinded drow who is unaware of its approach. Its Constitution

damage might likewise prevent the drow from pursuing while

instead seeking out a restoration spell.

To cover the retreat, spells such as fog cloud and obscuring mist

are good because they are unaffected by spell resistance. In

addition, if the drow have just encountered a cloudkill, they are

much less likely to charge into another roiling cloud of mist.

The retreat is an excellent time to summon any expendable

monsters or allies to send back along the trail and hamper

any pursuit. Once again, spell resistance doesnt help against

a hungry  endish dire wolverine. And it goes without saying

that the versatility of spells such as  y, expeditious retreat, and

pass without trace is valuable in such endeavors.

The party should stay together, however. One heroic soul

who intends to hold the tunnel behind his retreating com-

rades  is  asking  for  trouble.  First,  the  party  should  assume

that character is lost and make plans to defend without him,

since there is a good chance he will never be seen again. To

some this might seem a noble and self-sacri cing end, but to

experienced drow- ghters it just means one less sword arm to

defend the party when the drow  nally catch up. In addition,

this sacri ce might be ineffectual. In the labyrinth that is the

Underdark,  the  drow  probably  know  a  half-dozen  tertiary

tunnels to reach the same place, so guarding one is unlikely

to be particularly helpful. Finally, there is a good chance that

the noble hero might not just be defeated but captured alive

as well. Then it becomes a contest between the captives will

and the captors inventiveness during the torture that is surely

to  follow  to  determine  if  the  character  spills  his  guts  and

reveals sensitive information about the partys plans, location,

strengths, and weaknesses.

During  the  course  of  the  retreat,  the  PCs  should  stay

together until they reach some easily defensible position

scouted in advance for just such an occasion, if possible. If

traps have been prepared in advance, that is even better. Just

retreating beyond the area of the encounter is a bad option,

because  drow  encounters  usually  fall  into  one  of  two  cat-

egories. More than likely such an encounter is either a drow

raiding partyin which case unless the drow have some better

target in mind, they are going to pursue and ambush the party

again. Otherwise, it is likely to be a patrol or guard post for

some drow strongholdin which case the drow are going to

call for reinforcements and then pursue and attack again. If the

characters are entrenched, though, the drow might  nd them

to not be worth the trouble and withdraw. It is imperative in

these defensive positions that the party keeps the approaches

well lighted and has the characters with the highest Spot and

Listen modi ers watching them. From this position, the party

can then either retreat to the surface or prepare itself to face

the drow for a rematch on more equal terms.

THE PREPARED PARTY

A prepared party enters the Underdark wondering not if but

when it will encounter drow. As mentioned, this party always

has plentiful daylight spells and daylight pellets at hand. Wands

of daylight and staffs of illumination also  t the bill nicely. These

items should be distributed among different party members

who are able to use them, in case any certain individual might

become disabled early in the battle.

When going into a battle with drow, battle eld intelligence

is key. Knowing who youre up against, how many, and where

they are located is essential to effectively combating the tacti-

cal skills and martial abilities of the drow. It is always a good

idea  to  identify  leaders  and  spellcasters  (often  one  and  the

same). That brief round when a daylight spell is activated is a

good time to quickly take stock of who is around and where

they are positioned. If the encounter is with a small or poorly

deployed force, an immediate charge might be the thing to do.

However, it is likely that there are troops providing a buffer

between the party and it primary targets and/or the leaders

are in some defensible position. In this case, a quick tactical

withdrawal might be in order.

A withdrawal just a few hundred feet up a corridor, perhaps

with a few of the retreating tactics mentioned above, is prob-

ably suf cient. If the drow are overzealous, the party might be

able to lure them or some of their underlings into an ambush

themselves. If not, at least it gives the party time to prepare

its own buf ng spells and take stock of the situation to decide

if  they  are  up  against  a  force  they  are  capable  of  defeating

or if an alternate route is preferable. The key to this tactical

withdrawal is to not take too longnot more than a minute

or so. During this time the drow, if not foolishly pursuing,

are  either  using  their  own  buf ng  spells,  organizing  their

defenses, or sending for reinforcements. If the party intends

to attack them, it needs to do so before any reinforcements

arrive and possibly while some of the defenders are fetching

those reinforcements.

Enemy Spellcasters

First and foremost in a partys mind when battling drow must

be determining the number and locations of spellcasters. Typi-

cally, raiding parties and small guard posts have only one or

two major spellcasters (perhaps a wizard as well as a cleric of

Lolth). Although any number of the underlingsespecially

other drowmight have some levels as spellcasters, these spells

are typically used for buf ng or for minor attacks or effects.

The principal focus must be on the main drow spellcasters to

offset their more devastating spells that are often used in con-

junction with their underlings tactics to good effect.

To combat these deadly spellcasters, it is a good idea for a

party to have a spellcaster of its own tasked as a dedicated coun-

terspeller. This individual should have plenty of dispel magic

spells on hand or preferably a wand of dispel magic. Once the

primary drow spellcasters have been identi ed, this character

readies an action to counterspell whenever a spellcaster begins

to cast. In some cases, more than one counterspeller might be

a good idea when there are two or more major spellcasters in

the drow group that the party is facing.

It might be argued that devoting a spellcaster to counter-

spell duty is detrimental since it removes a primary offensive

component from the party in the battle. This is largely untrue,

because engaging in a spell duel with a highly spell-resistant

foe is likely to lead to disaster, and drow are on their home turf

when it comes to spell duels. In addition, the other tactics pre-

sented in this section offset the temporary loss of the offensive

powers of the counterspeller by eliminating the threat of drow

spellcasters early and then freeing the counterspeller up for

more deadly use of his power. To further alleviate that loss of

offensive capability, a wand of dispel magic in the hands of the

partys bard or a rogue who has ranks in Use Magic Device

goes  a  long  way  toward  allowing  the  wizard  or  sorcerer  to

make other more versatile attacks.

Finally, if there simply is no spellcaster of suf cient power or

magical resources available to complete this task, then a char-

acter skilled with ranged weapons can serve in a pinch. The

various abilities provided by the Order of the Bow initiateCW

prestige class serve well in this capacity. The key to success

is being able to hit the drows probably high Armor Class and

doing enough damage to overcome the drows probably high

ranks in Concentration. A potential bene t of this tactic is

that doing damage to the drow spellcaster and thwarting his

or her spellcasting attempts has a good chance of breaking

that individuals morale and ending the battle as discussed in

Negotiating a Surrender, below.

Player Character Spellcasting

The great equalizer in battles where the enemies outnumber

the party is typically the varied and deadly spells available

to  the  party  to  even  the  odds.  A  few   reballs  usually  settle

down a horde of orcs pretty quickly. However, with drow this

tactic becomes problematic, since they prove to be resistant

to a signi cant portion of the spells cast at them. Nothing is

more demoralizing then seeing those same  reballs launched,

only to witness the enemy drow soldiers walking through the

carnage unscathed. Worse, for a sorcerer, that spell took up a

slot that could have been used for a different, more effective

spell later.

The obvious solution to this problem, unless the party spell-

casters  are  already  engaged  as  counterspellers  as  discussed

above, is to use spells that are not subject to spell resistance

when  battling  the  drow.  However,  this  is  easier  said  than

done when one peruses the lists of spells favored by player

characters and sees that entry stating Spell Resistance: Yes

again and again. The Spell Penetration feat becomes invalu-

able in this case.

However, many useful spells that do not allow spell resis-

tance can be of great assistance. A prime example is the lowly

glitterdust, which can reveal an entire group of sneaking drow

and render them blinded at the same time. Other low-level

spells useful against drow are acid splash and Melfs acid arrow

to cause damage and disrupt spellcasters and snare, web, stinking

cloud, entangle, animate rope, or grease to disable or otherwise

hinder them.

Spells  such  as  cloud-

kill, acid fog, creeping doom,

incendiary  cloud,  Evards

black  tentacles,  and  insect

plague  can  damage  entire

groups  of  drow  as  well

as  hinder  their  spellcast-

ing.  The  druid  spell  repel

stone or metal can put a group

of  armored  drow  to   ight.

Reverse  gravity  is  effective

against  well-entrenched

drow. In addition, most illu-

sion spells are unaffected by

spell resistance and can be

used to outwit the drow or

to manipulate the  eld of

battle (hallucinatory terrain).

The mislead spell is valuable

for  its  ability  to  escape  or

out ank drow opponents.

Forcecage is an excel-

lent way to contain a

particularly trouble-

some  drow  warrior

or spellcaster.

Most  divination

spells are unaffected

by  spell  resistance,

and  the  use  of  a

simple  clairaudience/clairvoyance  can  greatly  help  in  gather-

ing intelligence on drow adversaries. Even detect poison can

be useful in determining if any drow, known for wielding

poison,  are  concealed  beyond  a  closed  door.  In  addition,  a

simple alarm spell on a campsite can foil attempts at in ltra-

tion by drow assassins.

On  the  battle eld,  other  spells  that  do  not  affect  drow

directly are still of great use in combat against them. Beyond

the buf ng spells that assist characters in combat, a spell such

as blink can put even the greatest drow weaponmaster at a dis-

advantage by reducing his chances to hit by half, and sanctuary

can be useful for moving around the battle eld to aid others.

Also, spells that affect the  eld itself are extremely useful.

Most of the wall spells (wall of stone, wall of force, and so forth)

are unaffected by spell resistance and can be used to restrict

the movement of drow foes and isolate them as necessary. In

the often natural stone surroundings of the Underdark, soften

earth and stone can impede the movements of drow combat-

ants, and a well-placed transmute rock to mud on a cavern wall

or roof can play havoc on drow positions. Even control water

can be used to over ow a nearby stream or pool to  ood out

a drow strongpoint.

Finally, transportative spells can help party members cir-

cumvent the drow front-line  ghters and get directly to the

leaders and spellcasters as described in greater detail below.

The spells of use for this purpose are the obvious choices such

as dimension door and teleport or the less obvious ones such as

spider climb, jump,  y, or passwall.

If PCs have access to sources beyond the core rulebooks,

Spell Compendium is priceless, opening up whole

new  realms  of  options  for  spellcasters.  For

evading and  anking the drow, spells such

as superior invisibility and amorphous

form are invaluable. In addition,

both are great spells to use to

escape  drow  or  withstand

concentrated attacks from

them. Amorphous form

in particular provides

immunity to  anking,

poison,  and  critical

hitsall  favorite

tactics of the drow.

Offsetting the disad-

vantages of  ghting

in  the  Underdark

are  spells  such  as

blacklight, blindsight,

mass  darkvision,

deeper  darkvision,

and scent. Spells that

can turn the Under-

dark  surroundings

and  creatures  with

which  the  drow

are  so  comfort-

able  against  them

include  earthlock,

ooze puppet, and slime wave. Finally, enough cannot be said for

the spell assay spell resistance, which quickly levels the playing

 eld for spellcasters who are engaging drow targets.

In addition to spells from sources outside the core rule-

books, some feats are available in these secondary sources that

serve particularly well when facing drow opponents. Fortify

SpellCAr  increases  spell  penetration,  and  Mage  SlayerCAr  is

extremely effective if a character is able to close with drow

spellcasters, because it provides some resistance to their spells

and  prevents  them  from  casting  defensively  if  threatened.

Races of Stone contains a number of feats that prove advanta-

geous in an Underdark environment. Earth Sense and Steady

Mountaineer provide greater awareness of foes and bonuses

for  movement  in  earthbound  terrain  and  caverns.  Tunnel

Fighting  gives  an  excellent  advantage  when  forcing  battle

in  a  con ned  tunnel  space,  and  Stoneback  provides  extra

protection from any superior maneuverability that the drow

might use in order to obtain  anking positions. Like Earth

Sense, the feats Hear the Unseen, Blindsense, and Scent from

Complete Adventurer provide additional sensory perceptions to

locate and pinpoint the ever-elusive targets presented by drow

in their natural environment.

Cut off the Head

A common tactic that has been used in battle to great effect

is  the  concept  of  decapitation  of  the  enemy  chain  of  com-

mand. Nowhere is this tactic more useful than when  ghting

the drow. Unlike with typical armies where the order of the

run-of-the-mill  troops  breaks  down  when  their  of cers  or

war leaders are killed, the warriors of drow society are usually

extremely well disciplined and capable of executing their own

battle tactics with  nesse and deadly effect. The decapitation

of the drow battle eld command structure often works for a

different reason.

Due  to  the  chaotic  and  inherently  evil  nature  of  drow

society, teamwork is not considered a virtue, and heightened

self-interest rules the day. Many drow warriors follow their

leaders out of fear or greed. Seeing that leader go down can

cause the drow underlings to realize that their opponent is

more to be feared than their leader was, that they no longer

need fear their leader and no longer fear the consequences of

retreat, or have seen that without their leader they no longer

stand to gain from this battle and thus no longer have a stake

in continuing it. This often leads to the withdrawal or outright

 ight of the lower-level drow warriors.

Oftentimes, the front-line  ghters of a drow patrol or guard-

post are not drow at all, but are thralls or slavesbugbears,

trolls, quaggoths, troglodytes, and the likeforced to  ght

for their drow masters through fear or magical compulsion. If

these lesser troops are avoided initially and the drow leadership

of a given group is destroyed, at the very least this approach

can result in demoralized troops. Just as likely will be an all-

out rout or even surrender and potentially the acquisition of

allies against the drow. Even if these lesser troops continue

to   ght  after  the  drow  leaders  and  spellcasters  have  been

eliminated, the party spellcasters are then freed to up to use

their more traditional mass destruction spells to quickly cut

through their ranks.

Negotiating a Surrender

As  mentioned,  greed  and  self-interest  are  two  of  the  most

prevalent  traits  in  drow  society.  Only  the  most  fanatical

drow will throw away his or her life in hopeless combat if an

escape presents itself. If a drow leaders life can be quickly

threatened,  its  underlings  avoided  or  neutralized,  its  peers

dead or incapacitated, then  a surrender might be negotiated.

The  most  important  thing  to  remember  when  negotiating

such a situation with a drow is that it is not simply looking

for escape; it has survived in drow society too long to settle

for simple status quo survival, and it is still looking for the

maximum gain from the situationwhether that is escape to

return for eventual revenge or how best to use the situation

against its enemies.

Keeping this in mind, parties negotiating a surrender should

offer the drow more than simply its life, but a chance for the

drow to pro t as well. The party does not have to keep its word

on any such negotiations unless alignment strictures require

it (the drow certainly will not do so), but in the short term the

characters can end the hostilities and remove that particular

drow or group as an immediate obstacle. But the party had

best beware on any return trips through the area. Any drow

who  were  left  behind  will  more  than  likely  renege  on  any

deals that were made, unless the agreed-to consideration was

just too irresistible, and those same drow will now be much

more familiar with the partys composition, strengths, and

weaknesses.

Some negotiated deals that can hold a drows interest long

enough to ensure cooperation are helping a male drow gain

wealth or power in a matriarchal society, elimination of drow

from a rival house, or an agreement to help in the destruction

of some enemy of the drow that they dare not tackle alone (for

instance, a nearby illithid colony or surface-elf explorers). It

is of note that any agreements entered into with a drow are

likely to be inherently evil in nature or at the very least on

the shady side of things. Paladins beware.

DROW AS CHARACTERS

Not all drow are the quintessential foes of player characters.

Many times drow are used as PCs themselves. These might

be renegade drow do-gooders that wander the surface or the

Underdark  seeking  to  escape  their  heritage  and  right  the

wrongs committed by their race, or these might be renegades

of a more self-interested bent equally outcast but seeking only

to gain their fame and fortune outside the oppressive hierarchy

of drow society. In both of these cases, these characters are

usually males who are disillusioned with the brutal matriar-

chal society they have left behind and sure there is a better

life for them elsewhere.

Finally, drow characters might still be members of drow

society. These characters are usually evil, though sometime

neutral (never good), and they ful ll the same role in drow

society  that  adventurers  serve  on  the  surface.  However,  in

addition  to  seeking  their  fame  and  fortune,  they  navigate

the  pitfalls  and  plotting  of  the  drow  culture  and  seek  to

survive and thrive under the cruel dominance of the house

matrons.  These  characters  experience  equal  parts  intrigue

and political maneuvering along with the more typical fare

of the adventurers life.

Regardless  of  their  outlook,  drow  characters  suit  many

classes very well because of their natural abilities and bonuses

to ability scores.

Fighter Types: Perhaps most numerous among the drow

population are those schooled in the arts of physical combat.

This state of affairs is ironic for a race that has an inherent

disadvantage in its stamina because of a Constitution penalty.

It is best explained by the constant state of turmoil in which

drow society exists and the constant need for warriors to pro-

vide some semblance of security.

Of all the combat-oriented classes (aside from warrior, which

is essentially the default class for ordinary drow),  ghter is

by far the most common, chosen primarily for its quick access

to a multiplicity of bonus feats and its sheer versatility. Most

drow who train as  ghters go on to defend the drow state or

serve  in  the  personal  guard  of  the  noble  houses.  Some  are

promoted into the ranks of the fang of Lolth prestige class

(described in this book) or become blackguard champions of

their houses or the priesthood.

Though they are less common, rangers also appear with

some regularity due in large part to the drowish propensity

to  ght with two weapons. This near obsession is often taken

so far as to cause drow rangers to  ght with two one-handed

weapons at the same time and accept the inherent penalties

involved therein. Rangers also often go on to enter the caves-

talker prestige class (also described herein) and become true

masters of their Underdark environment.

Barbarians are a relative rarity in the more urbane culture

of the drow, though those individuals who show a propensity

for berserk combat are often coached along in anticipation

of introduction to the kinslayer class described in this book.

Some  few  drow  become  monks,  but  the  Lolth  followers

who are lawful enough to pursue such a profession are few

and far between.

Stealthy Types: Second most common to the warriors of

drow society are the rogues, those shifty drow without any

real stake to call their own who therefore must live off of what

they can take from others. Since the powerful in drow society

work very hard to ensure that they remain powerful, the best

way to meet ones needs at the expense of others is through

subterfuge rather than brute force. Furthermore, the natural

agility of the drow race lends itself well to the roguish classes.

The penultimate example of drow stealth taken to the extreme

is the eye of Lolth prestige class (described herein)spies and

secret police who move throughout drow society unseen but

feared by all.

Scouts are frequently employed in the far patrols through

the Underdark, and assassins are far from uncommon in the

endlessly  cutthroat  drow  cities.  Bards  are  less  common  in

drow society, but the superior Charisma of the race allows

exceptional examples of the class to exist such that the sheer

beauty of their artistry is often admired by other Underdark

and surface raceseven those that are sworn enemies of the

drow.

Divine Casters:  The most prestigious of all individuals

in drow society are the clerics, because of their divine con-

nection to the Spider Queen. Yet entry to this class is closely

regulated, controlled almost entirely by the noble houses and

existing priesthood and forbidden to males. Clerics of other

drow deities do exist on the fringes of drow culture, but under

the best circumstances they are seen as lesser stepchildren,

if allied with the Fane of Lolth, and at worst they are seen as

apostates and heretics worthy only of extermination, if they

are unallied.

Druids are not entirely unknown but usually exist outside

established drow communities, existing as near-hermits either

in isolated caverns or even in the wilds of the surface. When

discovered, they are usually actively hunted by the priestesses

of Lolth as heretics.

Arcane  Casters:  Respected  only  slightly  less  than  the

priestesses  of  Lolth  are  the  arcane  casters.  These  are  less

numerous than clerics, but they still wield considerable power

and  are  often  males.  Forbidden  from  pursuing  careers  as

clerics, males with talent often become arcane casters to  nd

a taste of some of the power that has eluded them.

Wizards and sorcerers are found in nearly equal numbers

among the drow, and the races superior Intelligence and Cha-

risma works well for both. There are many magical societies

and schools that tutor and train wizards, and sorcerous talent

runs strong through the chaotic and inherently magical drow.

Warmages are embraced and trained to serve as house wiz-

ards, and the most prestigious universities and noble houses

turn out master wizards, archmages of power that rivals that

of  the  high  priestesses.  Necromancers  are  not  unheard  of,

but  are  always  viewed  somewhat  distastefullywhy  work

to manipulate the dead, when manipulating the living is so

much more in nitely interesting?

Warlocks are not unknown among the drow, but they are

seen as something of an oddity. The races af nity with and

connection to the Lower Planes is too great for them to not

exhibit some sort of taint from beyond, and demonbinders

are among the most common examples found. Many arcane

casters  likewise  become  arachnomancersever  popular

among the drow. (Both of these prestige classes are described

in this book.)

Psionics Users: Finally, in a group by themselves are the

ever-enigmatic  psionics  users.  As  in  just  about  any  society,

the use of psionics is poorly understood and its practitioners

viewed distrustfully, and the drow who are much more steeped

in powers of the arcane and the divine are no exception. How-

ever, as a race that has had extensive dealings with creatures

such as illithids and duergar, the drow are at least familiar with

and somewhat more accepting of psionic power. The heads of

society still view it skeptically and work to ensure it is no threat

to them, but it is often seen as a useful and unexpected tool to

use against ones enemies to gain whatever advantage possible

in the continual dance macabre of drow politics.

Psychic warriors and soulknives are the most frequently

accepted classes, their members often serving to augment a

noble houses guard force or act as assassins. Psions are gen-

erally distrusted, being seen as rivals for the kind of power

enjoyed by the divine and arcane spellcasting classes. They

do make useful agents sometimes when dealing with psioni-

cally  endowed  races,  however,  and  many  envoys  to  illithid

or duergar communities have a powerful psion among their

number.  Wilders  generally  move  invisibly  through  drow

society, concealing their powers and causing no more chaos

than what already exists in the streets. Only after manifesting

a particularly powerful surge do wilders have to watch their

backs, as the local authorities seek to harness or eliminate the

source of the power revealed.

RACIAL CLASS LEVELS

One of the disadvantages of running a drow as a character is

the races +2 level adjustment. A 1st-level drow character has

an effective character level (ECL) of 3rd, which is the sum of

his level adjustment and his Hit Dice. Simply put, a character

cannot be a 1st-level drow. Even if you have only one character

level, youre still considered a 3rd-level character. This becomes

a problem if you want to play a drow character, but your new

campaign requires that you roll up a 1st-level character.

However,  through  the  use  of  the  new  drow  racial  class,

the various abilities of a drow that provide him with his level

adjustment boost are now incorporated into the racial class

levels. Only a drow character can take this racial class. Using

this  variant,  a  drow  character  has  an  effective  level  adjust-

ment of +0 but does not gain all of his natural drow abilities

until he advances in his racial class. These racial class levels

can  be  integrated  with  any  standard  class  levels.  A  racial

class level might or might not grant Hit Dice independent of

the characters class depending on the level attained. When

taking a racial class, you can still take levels in one or more

standard character classes, subject to the normal multiclass-

ing restrictions.

THE DROW RACIAL CLASS

The drow, also known as dark elves, are a depraved and evil

offshoot of the more commonly known surface elves. They

spend their lives continually plotting the downfall of their

hated  light-skinned  kin.  Although  they  share  a  common

enemy, there is certainly no love lost among the drow them-

selves, since every individual only looks out for himself and

sees any weakness in a compatriot as a chance to enhance his

own place in society.

Through the millennia of their subterranean exile, and the

machinations of their foul goddess, the drow have developed

an af nity for arachnids and are typically accompanied by

several of these vermin, from the smallest normal spiders to

the most gargantuan monstrous varieties.

For more details on drow, see MM 103.

RACIAL CLASS FEATURES

The following features are gained by characters who take drow

racial levels that are integrated with a standard class.

Class Level

The Class Level column of the accompanying table indicates

whether a drow gains a standard class level at any given racial

level. Some racial levels provide a standard class level, some

racial levels provide a drow-speci c ability, and some grant

both. Class levels grant all the bene ts normally associated

with level advancement. This includes another Hit Die, other

class abilities, and improvement in base attack bonus, base

saves, and ability scores.

NEW DROW FEAT

This feat is provided for half-elf characters with drow ancestry

that wish to emphasize their dark elf heritage. This feat can be

taken only at 1st level. In a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign, this

should be considered a regional feat and subject to the rules

described on page 33 of Players Guide to Faerun.

DROW LEGACY

The drow blood in your veins runs true and grants you some

abilities from that heritage.

Prerequisite: Half-elf with drow ancestry.

Benefit: You have a +2 racial bonus on Will saves against

spells and spell-like abilities. You have darkvision out to 60

feet. You receive Exotic Weapon Proficiency (hand crossbow),

as well as, Undercommon and the drow dialect of Elven as

automatic languages.

If you have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher, you also

gain  the  following  spell-like  abilities,  each  usable  once  per

day: dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire. Your caster level

equals your class level.

Normal:  A  half-elf  with  drow  ancestry  normally  just  re-

ceives  the  half-elf  racial  traits  as  described  in  the  Players

Handbook.

Special: Taking this feat also causes you to have light sen-

sitivity: You are dazzled (1 circumstance penalty on attack

rolls, saves, and checks) in bright sunlight or within the radius

of a daylight spell.

HALF-DROW PLAYER CHARACTERS

In the core DUNGEINS & DRAGONS game, the offspring of drow

and humans are standard half-elves. The union of a drow and

any  other  creature  does  not  produce  children.  However,  in

the FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign setting, there exists a race of

half-drow as the offspring of humans and drow elves. This rare

race is found primarily in the isolated land of Dambrath on the

southernmost shores of Faern. It is not recommended that

half-drow be used except in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign.

The half-drow race is detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS ac-

cessory Races of Faerun and is updated here. Half-drow have

the  standard  racial  traits  of  half-elves  given  in  the  Players

Handbook, except that their favored class is the class in which

they have the most levels. In addition, rather than elf blood,

they have drow blood. Since drow is a subrace of elf, the net

effect  is  that  they  have  elf  blood  as  well.  The  specification

of drow blood means that for all special abilities and effects

particular to a drow, a half-drow is considered a drow. One

piece of errata from Races of Faerun is that half-drow do not

have  darkvision.  Rather,  they  have  only  the  low-light  vision

typical of half-elves.

Though largely spurned by their arrogant full-blooded kin

of the Underdark, the half-drow of Dambrath do own a dis-

tinct advantage over the drow in that they do not suffer the

light blindness common to their pureblood cousins. To this

end, they make excellent adventurers well suited to both the

Underdark and the surface world.
