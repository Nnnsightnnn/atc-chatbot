Introduction

Savage Species, a comprehensive guide to monster characters,

helps you use monsters as either player characters (PCs) or

nonplayer characters (NPCs) to serve as interesting allies and

opponents for the player characters in your campaign.

You need the Players Handbook, the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide,

and the Monster Manual to use this book. The monster classes

and templates in Savage Species are designed to be compliant

with the revised version of the Monster Manual (see the side-

bar on this page for more information), but this book is still

compatible with the original Monster Manual as well.

WHATS INSIDE?

This book contains many different kinds of information.

Here is a breakdown of its contents.

Chapter 1: Character Creation. Use the instructions in

this chapter to make character sheets for monster charac-

ters. It gives you the procedure for taking a creature from

the Monster Manual and adding class levels to it. This is only

one of the ways to create a monster character; other meth-

ods are discussed in chapters that follow.

Chapter 2: Monster Characters. This chapter explains

how  to  build  monster  characters,  using  the  concepts  of

level  adjustment  and  effective  character  level  (ECL)  to

ensure that monster characters are compatible in power

with standard characters.

Chapter  3:  Monster  Classes. This  chapter  gives  some

options for altering standard monsters other than adding

character  classes  or  using  the  monster  advancement

rules  in  the  introduction  of  the  Monster  Manual.  One

example,  the  minotaur  monster  class,  appears  here;

others are provided in Appendix 1.

Chapter 5: Equipment. From aboleth mucus to a whip

of  webs,  this  chapter  covers  monster  equipment  and

suggestions for adding it to your campaign.

Chapter 6: Spells. Designed for use on monsters or by

monster spellcasters but usable by anyone, the spells in

this chapter have something to offer for every spellcast-

ing class.

Chapter 7: Prestige Classes. This chapter presents new

prestige classes designed specifically for monster charac-

ters, such as the scaled horror and the waverider.

Chapter 8: Campaigns. Whether you are adding mon-

ster  characters  to  an  existing  campaign  or  exploring

campaigns  from  the  monsters  point  of  view,  read  this

chapter for ideas.

Chapter  9:  Advancing  a  Monster.  This  chapter  pro-

vides  rules  and  advice  for  DMs  who  want  to  make  ad-

vanced versions of monsters.

Chapter  10:  Templates. This  chapter  delves  into  the

details of how (and why) to add a template to a monster

and also presents new templates, such as the ghost brute

and the multiheaded creature.

Chapter 11: Becoming a Monster. This chapter covers

the  fine  art  of  transforming  standard  player  characters

into monster characters.

Appendix 1: Sample Monster Classes. These examples

use the rules from Chapter 3:_Monster Classes.

Appendix  2:  Compiled Tables.  This  appendix  collects

the  basic  information  needed  to  build  monster  charac-

ters  for  all  the  appropriate  monsters  in  the  Monster

Manual, including  Hit  Dice,  level  adjustment,  starting

ECL, ability scores, good saves, base attack bonus, saving

throw  bonuses,  natural  armor  bonus,  skill  points,  and

number of feats.

Chapter 4: Feats. If you want some new feats for your

monsters, whether they are characters or not, check out

this chapter.

Appendix  3:  New  Monsters.  Heres  where  youll  find

rules  for  creating  anthropomorphic  animals;  the  half-

ogre described as a new race; and three new creatures: the

desmodu, the loxo, and the thri-kreen.

MONSTERS AS CHARACTERS

Savage Species is all about treating monsters as characters. In

keeping with that approach, this book features several changes

to  the  rules  concerning  monsters.  The  changes  summarized

below are also reflected in the D&D games revised core rule-

books, particularly the revised Monster Manual.

Skills: A  monster  receives  skill  points  based  on  its

Intelligence score and its Hit Dice, just as characters do. See

Table 21 for details. The Wilderness Lore skill is now named

Survival. The Alchemy skill is now named Craft (alchemy).

Feats: Every  monster  receives  at  least  one  feat  and  gains

additional feats at the same rate a character doesone more

at 3 HD, another at 6 HD, and so forth.

Types  and  Subtypes: The  beast  type  is  removed  from  the

game.  All  beasts  have  their  type  changed  to  either  magical

beast or animal, as appropriate. (The gray render and the grif-

fon are the only creatures in this book affected by this change;

both are now magical beasts.)

Shapechanger is changed from a type to a subtype. Creatures

that had the shapechanger type now have a different type, and

they also have the shapechanger subtype. The aranea becomes

a  magical  beast,  the  doppelganger  becomes  a  monstrous

humanoid, the phasm becomes an aberration, and lycanthropes

(not  mentioned  in  this  book)  become  either  humanoids  or

giants.

The effect of the fire and cold subtypes is changed. See the

fire elemental monster class in Appendix 1 for details.

Face/Reach: The  space  a  creature  or  character  occupies  is

always expressed as a square; thus, only one figure rather than

two is given for a creatures face statistic: 10 ft., for instance,

rather than 10 ft. by 10 ft. Rectangular face statistics such as

5 ft. by 10 ft. have been eliminated; Large creatures now have

a face of 10 ft., Huge creatures have a face of 15 ft., Gargantuan

creatures have a face of 20 ft., and Colossal creatures have a

face of 30 ft. (or perhaps more). See Table 103 for details.

The natural reach of Gargantuan (long) creatures is changed

from 10 ft. to 15 ft. (The baleen whale and the cachalot whale

are the only creatures in this book affected by this change.)

haracters from Savage Species use standard DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS character sheets. Open your Players

Handbook to Character Creation Basics and use the

diagrams and numbers presented there to follow

these instructions. If you need help with any of the

terminology used, see Terms. Follow these steps in order

unless a specific step says otherwise. Make sure you follow

all of them to get a complete character sheet.

Below is a summary of game terms and their usage.

TERMS

Base Creature: This term refers to the average version of

that kind of monster, as presented in the Monster Manual,

before any modifications are made for using it as a character.

Character: A creature, of any kind, with one or more

levels in a class.

Character Level: When a creatures description refers to

character level, add any class levels it has to the base crea-

tures Hit Dice to determine the character level. This is not

the same as effective character level (see below),, which

also includes a level adjustment. The creatures base save

and base attack bonuses are based on its character level.

Thus, character level is a good measure of basic effective-

ness in adventuring.

Class Levels: Class levels are levels in one or more char-

acter classes. A 3rd-level fighter has three class levels (all in

fighter). A 3rd-level fighter/4th-level rogue has seven

class levels.

Challenge Rating (CR): Challenge Rating plus

class level is a good measure of the creatures overall

threat to a party. A bugbear with four levels of bar-

barian is CR 6, making it a good encounter for a

party of 4th to 8th level. It is more dangerous to a

party of lower level and less dangerous to one of

higher level.

Effective Character Level_(ECL): A creatures

effective character level is the sum of its level

adjustment, Hit Dice, and class levels. Use charac-

ter level for all game functions except awarding

experience, determining starting equipment, and

determining how much experience the character

needs to gain a new level. All three of those func-

tions use effective character level instead.

Goal Creature: When transforming an exist-

ing character into a new race or creature type

(see Chapter 11: Becoming a Monster), the goal

creature is what the character wishes to be-

come. If a human wants to become an ogre, the

goal creature is ogre.

Hit Dice: A monsters kind is, in many ways,

its character class (see Chapter 3: Classes for more

on this concept); in this sense, its Hit Dice are

equivalent to its monster class levels. If a crea-

ture has 1 Hit Die or a fractional Hit Die, the first Hit Die it

gains in an actual character class replaces its racial Hit Die or

portion thereof, and the character functions as any other

member of its class.

Kind: Each entry in the Monster Manual describes a kind

of monster. Bulette and bugbear are both kinds of mon-

sters.

Level Adjustment: Some monster kinds are far more

powerful than other creatures that have the same Hit Dice.

Such an extra-powerful monster is assigned a level adjust-

menta number that, when added to its Hit Dice and class

levels, determines the level of character to which it would

be equivalent as a PC. A level adjustment provides a nu-

meric comparison with the seven standard races from the

Players Handbook, showing how much better that kind of

monster is than one of the standard races. Level adjustment

takes into account a monsters special abilities, so it does

not adequately reflect the characters effectiveness in

adventuring the way base save and base attack bonuses do.

Instead, it lets the DM know how much more challenging

an encounter must be than a characters character level, in

order to provide an adequate challenge.

Monster Character: A character created using some

kind of creature other than the seven standard races from

the Players Handbook is called a monster character.

Standard Races: The standard races are those given in

the Players Handbook as options for creating player charac-

ters: dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, half-elf, half-orc, and

human.

Starting ECL: A monsters starting ECL is defined as:

Base creatures Hit Dice + level adjustment.

A monster characters starting ECL should be equal to or less

than the partys average character level. In the latter case,

add class levels to  the monster character until its ECL

equals the partys average character level.

a monster character using just this outline and Appendix

2: Compiled Tables when you are comfortable with the

rules in Savage Species. Until then, use the information in

Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters as well.

On the blank character sheet shown here, steps 1 through

12 are keyed to the places on the sheet where the informa-

tion for that step is recorded.

STEP 0. CHECK WITH YOUR DM

If you do not already have permission to play a monster

character, ask your Dungeon Master if such characters are

allowed in the campaign. Because monster characters are so

varied, the DM may choose to allow only those created from

certain kinds of monsters.

1. CHOOSE BASE CREATURE

The instructions in the Players Handbook apply equally here,

with one exception. The DM helps you select a creature

from the level adjustment lists provided in Appendix 2:

Compiled Tables. Your DM knows what complexity of mon-

ster (see Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters) he or she

is willing to allow in the game. Pick a monster with a start-

ing ECL equal to or less than the average character level of

the rest of the party. (In step 3, you will add class levels until

the ECL equals the partys average character level.) Be aware

that creatures with ability scores below 3 may be unplayable.

In particular, any creature with an Intelligence below 3 is

not a playable character, since 3 is the minimum Intelli-

gence score for a player character according to the Players

Handbook. See the Awakened Characters sidebar in Chapter

2: Building Monster Characters for guidelines on playing

awakened animals and plants. Put the name of your base

creature in the space for Race on your character sheet.

2. ABILITY SCORES

The three methods for determining monster ability scores

are described below. Use one of them to generate a set of six

numbers, and make a note of these numbers on a piece of

scratch paper.

BASICS OF

MONSTER CHARACTERS

This section gives an outline of the process for building a

monster character, beginning with a creature from the

Monster Manual and adding class levels to it. You can build

A. Use the Base Creatures Scores: You can copy the

ability scores of the base creature from the Monster Manual if

you wish. This technique sounds simple, but it has one

major drawback. Each of a monsters ability scores, as given

in the Monster Manual, is 10 or 11, adjusted by racial modi-

pqqqqrs

CHALLENGE RATING VERSUS EFFECTIVE

CHARACTER LEVEL

Challenge  Rating  and  effective  character  level  measure  two

different things. CR measures the threat level of a monster, and

ECL measures its relative effectiveness compared to a charac-

ter  of  one  of  the  standard  races,  as  given  in  the  Players

Handbook. The  factors  that  go  into  making  a  good  challenge

and a good character are so different that CR is no help in the

latter case. A monster is only on the scene for a very short

while,  usually  just  a  few  rounds.  A  player  character,  on  the

other hand, is present for almost every scene of the adventure.

For example, it makes little difference to a monsters CR if a

spell-like  ability  is  usable  at  will  or  once  per  day.  It  probably

wont  live  long  enough  for  the  frequency  of  use  to  make  a

difference. But the distinction makes a huge difference to a PC,

who  could  potentially  use  the  ability  in  every  encounter.

Further, if a powerful creature (such as a balor) has access to a

plethora of spell-like abilities, that fact doesnt affect its CR too

heavily, because it only gets to use three or four of them in a

given encounter. Again, however, that kind of flexibility matters

a lot to a PC.

As illustrated by these examples, CR and ECL measure two

different things, so both are necessary. Never assume that CR

and ECL are equivalent, or even related.

fiers. You can do better than that.

B. Use Elite Ability Scores: Take

the ability scores for a particular

kind of monster directly from the

Monster Manual and apply the fol-

lowing modifiers as you see fit: +4,

+4, +2, +2, +0, 2.

C. Randomly Generate Ability

Scores from Scratch: This meth-

od follows the instructions in the

Player s Handbook for  generating

ability scores. Do not roll an ability

score if the base creatures score as

given in the Monster Manual is less

than 6; simply use the score given

there instead. Do not worry about

applying  racial  modifiers  until

Step 4.

3. CHOOSE A CLASS

Add class levels to the starting ECL

until  your  character s  total  ECL

equals the desired character level.

4. ASSIGN AND ADJUST

ABILITY SCORES

If you used method 2A or 2B above,

your characters ability scores are al-

ready assigned and adjusted. Com-

pare the total of the creatures Hit

Dice plus class levels to Table 25:

Experience  and  Level-Dependent

Benefits. If you added enough class

levels to gain one or more ability

score increases, assign them now,

then go on to step 5.

If you used method 2C, assign the

ability scores you rolled now. You also

need to determine the ability score

adjustments for your monster kind.

First, determine the ability score modifiers for that mon-

sters kind from the base creatures statistics. You can derive

ability score modifiers for any kind of creature by subtract-

ing either 10 or 11 (whichever gives an even result) from

each ability score in its Monster Manual entry. For example, a

doppelganger has the following ability scoresStr 12, Dex

13, Con 12, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 13. Subtracting 10 from the

even numbers and 11 from the odd numbers leaves racial

modifiers of +2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +2

Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, and +2 Charisma.

Finally, just as with methods 2A and 2B, compare the total

of the creatures Hit Dice plus class levels to Table 25: Expe-

rience and Level-Dependent Benefits. If you added enough

class levels to gain one or more ability score increases, assign

them now.

5. REVIEW THE STARTING PACKAGE

If you want to deal with equipment now, skip to step 10.

Otherwise, go on to step 6.

6. RECORD RACIAL AND CLASS FEATURES

In addition to the special abilities of your monster kind, you

have class features from the class or classes you added to the

monster. Record all the special abilities and class features

now, using the appropriate spaces on the back side of the

character sheet.

If you are building a spellcaster, remember that ECL has

no effect on caster level. Only class levels change caster

level.

7. SELECT SKILLS

Adding a class level to a monster is a lot like multiclassing.

The monster does not get four times the normal skill points

for its first class level unless it had 1 or fewer monster Hit

Dice. Otherwise, its monster kind counts as its first class.

The maximum rank for a class skill is character level + 4

(level adjustment is not part of this calculation). The maxi-

mum rank for a cross-class skill is half the maximum rank

9. REVIEW DESCRIPTION

Use the base creature entry in the Mon-

ster Manual and Chapter 6: Description

of the Players Handbook to complete the

alignment, deity, age, height, weight,

eyes, hair, and gender blanks of the

character sheet. If you do not want to

use the base creatures alignment, see

Alignment in Chapter 8: Campaigns.

Your monster kind may list starting

languages. If so, record those and any

additional languages gained because of a

high Intelligence bonus or skills. If your

monster kind has no starting languages,

assume your character speaks Common.

10. SELECT EQUIPMENT

Compare the characters ECL with Table

224: Starting Equipment for PCs above

1st Level in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide

to find the starting wealth for your char-

acter. Purchase equipment now. Try to

strike a balance between standard ad-

venturing gear and magic items, or you

may wind up with magic armor and

weapons but no bedroll. Keep a little

cash and record it on your character

sheet so you can buy meals, assuming

that the local tavern serves monsters!

for a class skill. See Appendix 2: Compiled Tables or the

appropriate table in Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters

for the method of determining the base creatures skill

points.

8. SELECT FEATS

As with ability scores and skills, you may choose to keep the

feats of the base creature if you wish. The character always

retains any racial bonus feats. If you wish to exchange any of

the creatures other feats for different ones, choose the same

number as the base creature has, excluding bonus feats (see

Appendix 2: Compiled Tables for the number of feats avail-

able to the base creature). When adding class levels, com-

pare the total of the creatures Hit Dice plus class levels to

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits. If you

added enough class levels to gain one or more additional

feats, select them now.

11. RECORD COMBAT AND

SKILL NUMBERS

See Appendix 2: Compiled Tables for

your base creatures base attack bonus

and base saving throw bonuses, then

add the appropriate bonuses for your

characters class levels. Figure out saving

throws, Armor Class, initiative modifier,

melee attack bonus, ranged attack bo-

nus, weapon statistics, and total skill

bonuses based on the characters monster kind, classes, abil-

ity modifiers, feats, and equipment. You may keep the hit

points of your base creature or roll them from scratch. If you

roll them from scratch, remember to take the maximum

possible die result from the first Hit Die, just as you would

for one of the standard races. In either case, roll Hit Dice

gained from class levels and add them to the hit points from

the monster kind. Multiply the characters Constitution

modifier by the total of its Hit Dice and class levels and add

or subtract the result appropriately.

12. DETAILS GALORE

Add any additional details you wish.

FINISHED

At this point, you should have a completed character sheet. You

are ready for your first adventure with a monster character.

his chapter focuses on the details of building mon-

ster characters.

The Players Handbook recommends, in the Charac-

ter Creation Basics section at the front of the book, to

choose class and race after rolling ability scores. How-

ever, its certainly possible to choose a characters class and

race first, then roll and assign ability scores. Either method

is fine for creating monster characters.

The rules in this chapter assume that you build charac-

ters first and then assign class levels. If you want to build a

character and have it change races after it has some class

levels under its belt, see Chapter 11: Becoming a Monster.

This chapter focuses on monsters from the Monster

Manual, but the rules and guidelines presented here apply

to monsters from any source.

CHOOSING A

BASE CREATURE

The monsters discussed in this chapter are grouped by

complexity, ranging from introductory (least complex)

through novice (moderately complex) to advanced (most

complex). A complete list of monsters from the Monster

Manual that are recommended for use as player characters

appears in Appendix 2: Compiled Tables.

The following general rules apply to building any mon-

ster character.

The base creature must have an Intelligence score

of 3 or higher. A creature with an Intelligence score

lower than 3 cannot have levels in any class. (The

awaken spell can be used to give an animal or plant

an  Intelligence  score  of  3  or  higher.  Also,  an

animal  with  the  celestial  or  fiendish  template

gains an Intelligence score of 3.)

Consider  carefully  before  using  a  base  creature

with any other ability score lower than 3.

The base creature must have a speed. A creature

that cant move, such as a shrieker, cant be used

as a base creature. (The awaken spell can be used

to give a plant the ability to move; see the spell

description in the Players Handbook.)

The base creature should be able to communi-

cate  verbally  with  fellow  party  members.  A

creature  that  is  not  capable  of  speaking  cant

easily be used as a base creature.

Consider carefully before choosing a kind of

monster that usually or always has an align-

ment  opposed  to  that  of  one  or  more  party

members.

Discuss  your  choice  with  your  DM  and

fellow players before making a final decision.

The size, alignment, and abilities of your base

creature  will  influence  which  adventures

your  party  undertakes,  and  your  fellow

players should have a say in that. Likewise, your base crea-

ture may ignore threats and challenges the other charac-

ters fear, or may fear things the other characters ignore.

Your DM may have to alter adventures to consider your

characters kind, and he or she may choose to rule against

certain kinds of creature because of that.

ESTIMATING LEVEL

ADJUSTMENTS

Players should never try to determine level adjustment on

their own. The DM should assign level adjustments to mon-

ster characters, carefully considering what belongs in his or

her game and the impact of monster special abilities. A level

adjustment should usually be equal to or less than the base

creatures Hit Dice. Setting a level adjustment greater than the

base creatures Hit Dice is a way to discourage players from

choosing that kind of monster for a character.

AS LEVELS RISE, ABILITIES FADE

Certain abilities decrease in usefulness as

character level increases. When

estimating level adjust-

ments, take into

account

the

number of Hit Dice the base

creature  already  has  and  consider

whether a particular feature still has value at that

level of play. For instance, a natural armor bonus is a

fixed number; that is, it does not change with level. At

lower character levels, a natural armor bonus is very

helpful, but as character levels increase, the avail-

ability of spells, magic items and increasing

base attack bonuses make it less important.

Similar abilities include (but are not lim-

ited to) the following.

Energy Resistance: If the character is

single attack than its energy resistance can negate, that fea-

ture is no longer as useful as it once was.

Fast Healing and Regeneration: When opponents can

do more than 50 points of damage in a single attack, a char-

acter risks death from massive damage. (Adjust this damage

figure of 50 points by +10 points for each size category larger

than Medium-size, or 10 points for each size category

smaller than Medium-size). If the base creature is subject to

death from massive damage, fast healing and

regeneration do not help unless the char-

acter has a Fortitude saving throw

bonus high enough to virtually

guarantee a successful save.

Spell Resistance: If character

level determines spell resistance

(as with drow), this feature remains valuable

throughout a characters career. If the base

creatures kind determines its spell resist-

ance,  and  class

levels  have  no

further effect, then

its  value  fades  as

the characters level

goes up.

STANDARD RACES

AND LEVEL

ADJUSTMENTS

The seven standard races in

the Players Handbook have no

level adjustments. Some of their

subtypes also have no level

adjustments. In Table 22:

Introductory  Monster

Races, a starting ECL of 1

assumes a creature with 1 Hit Die, as

presented in the Monster Manual.

PHYSIOLOGY AND CHARACTERS

All seven of the standard races (human, dwarf, elf, gnome, half-

elf, half-orc, and halfling) share certain physical characteristics.

Average, healthy members of these races have two eyes posi-

tioned to give binocular vision, two ears to allow binaural hear-

ing,  a  mouth  capable  of  forming  words  understandable  and

replicable by the other races, bilateral symmetry (two arms and

two legs), and an opposable thumb on each hand. Any creature

that lacks one of these features (such as a grimlock, because it

has  no  eyes)  presents  challenges  for  both  players  and  DMs.

Any race that lacks more than one of these features (such as an

awakened animal, a naga, or an arrowhawk) presents serious

challenges for players and DMs.

pick them up. They can push and pull objects, but they cannot

manipulate them. For instance, an awakened deinonychus can,

with some effort, pick up a stick off the ground, but it has no

way to wield that stick effectively as a club.

A  character  without  arms  takes  a  8  penalty  on  all  Climb

checks,  unless  it  has  some  racial  bonus  on  Climb  checks  (a

climb  speed  always  provides  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks).

A character without a mouth cannot speak and cannot cast

spells with verbal components.

Characters  without  eyes  cannot  see,  meaning  they  cannot

perceive light and darkness, color, or (in most cases) individ-

ual facial features. They cannot read, so they cannot use books

(including spellbooks) or scrolls.

The challenges include the following issues. Characters with-

out opposable thumbs can must cup objects in their fingers to

LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS AND

PAST PRODUCTS

Many products provide ECLs for monsters instead of level

adjustments. The conversion is simple. The ECL given in

the product is the starting ECL for that monster. To find

its level adjustment, simply subtract the monsters Hit

Dice. The starting ECL for a 1 HD creature takes into

account its single Hit Die, so subtract that to find its level

adjustment.

LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS AND YOUR GAME

Savage Species contains the best possible estimates for

level adjustments, assuming a generic game or campaign.

In your specific game, you may need to tinker with the

level adjustments given here. For instance, in a campaign

set among floating cities, a fly speed becomes an impor-

tant feature. In a maritime campaign, whether on or

under the waters surface, a swim speed becomes more

important.

MONSTER CHARACTER

SKILL POINTS AND FEATS

Because monsters are characters too, the base creature of a

monster character gains skill points and feats in much the

same way a standard-race character does.

Starting skill points for a monster character are based on

its Intelligence modifier and Hit Dice, as shown in Table

21: Monster Character Starting Skill Points.

Regardless of its Intelligence modifier, any creature starts

with at least 4 skill points and receives at least 1 skill point

per Hit Die thereafter.

Feats: Every monster character starts with one feat. The

character gains another feat when it reaches 3 Hit Dice, and

one additional feat for each additional 3 HD of the base crea-

ture. It gains additional feats for class levels by adding the

levels to the base creatures Hit Dice and checking the total

against Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Bene-

fits (later in this chapter).

INTRODUCTORY

MONSTERS

The monster kinds that are considered introductory include

the seven standard races from the Players Handbook. Gener-

ally speaking, such monsters have few special abilities. Their

level adjustments stem from racial ability modifiers that are

not balanced like those of the standard races, from natural

armor bonuses, and from other features that are more pow-

erful than those of the standard races. Most of the monsters

you or your players will want to use as characters are likely

to be in this section.

Introductory monsters are the ones best suited for copy-

ing directly from the Monster Manual and adding class levels

(see the Quick and Dirty sidebar, below). If the base creature

has 1 Hit Die, the monster characters first Hit Die comes

from a character class, replacing its racial Hit Die, and the

character functions as any other member of its class.

LEVEL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS

Below are the factors used in estimating level adjustments

for monsters in this section and a discussion of each. Each of

the subsequent sections gives any additional factors used in

estimating level adjustments for the monsters it contains.

Unbalanced Ability Scores: Table 27: Ability Score

Equivalencies in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide shows how to

balance ability scores. A monster that does not follow those

rules gains at least a +1 level adjustment. A higher level

adjustment is appropriate if the monsters ability score

bonuses (especially Strength or Constitution modifiers) are

particularly high. Not having a Constitution score is actu-

ally a benefit, since a monster without one can ignore most

effects that require Fortitude saves.

Size: A Large creature gets no level adjustment for size.

Its level adjustment is based on its reach instead.

A Small creature gets a 1 level adjustment. It is some-

what harder to hit than a Medium-size one, but it moves

more slowly and must use smaller weapons. A Small crea-

ture  also  typically  has  a  lower  Strength  score  than  a

Medium-size creature.

Natural Armor Bonus: A natural armor bonus is worth

at least a +1 level adjustment, plus an additional +1 for every

5 points of natural armor bonus beyond the first 5.

Speed: A monsters speed can affect level adjustment in a

variety  of  ways,  depending  on  the  kind  of  movement

involved.

Swim: A monster with a swim speed generally does not

gain a level adjustment. However, if you are running a pirate

campaign, or any other campaign where characters spend

much of their time on or under the water, assign a monster

with a swim speed a +1 level adjustment.

Fly: A monster with a fly speed gets a +1 level adjustment

if its maneuverability is worse than good, or a +2 level

adjustment if its maneuverability is good or better.

Climb and Burrow: A climb or burrow speed is generally

worth a +1 level adjustment.

Natural Weapons: If a monster gains multiple attacks in

a single round before a fighter of equal Hit Dice would do

the same, or if the monsters natural weapons deal more

damage than a simple or martial weapon it could wield in

one hand, the monster gains a +1 level adjustment.

Reach: Beyond 5 feet, every additional 5 feet of reach is

worth an additional +1 level adjustment. A monster with a

10-foot reach gets a +1 level adjustment, and a monster with

a 15-foot reach gets a +2 level adjustment.

Skills and Feats: A base creature with three or more

racial bonuses on skill checks gets a +1 level adjustment.

Likewise, two or more bonus feats because of race gain the

creature a +1 level adjustment.

Special Attacks and Special Qualities: The trickiest

areas of level adjustment, these features require careful

thought. A long list of features does not automatically grant

a large level adjustment, since monsters can generally use

only one special attack per round. A single feature is not

always worth a level adjustment, since characters of the

pqqqqrs

character should last longer than that.

QUICK AND DIRTY

You might want to copy a monster out of the Monster Manual,

give  it  appropriate  class  levels,  and  start  playing.  We  do  not

recommend  that  method,  but  you  can  do  it.  In  some  cases,

such as with fey characters, you can get more skill points that

way. The ability scores are already generated and assigned. Skill

points are already spent and feats are already chosen. All you

really have to do is add class levels and buy equipment.

If  you  do  choose  to  copy  a  monster  out  of  the  Monster

Manual, fill  out  a  character  sheet  as  explained  in  Chapter  1:

Character  Creation  Basics.  Determine  the  total  of  the  crea-

tures  Hit  Dice  plus  class  levels  and  refer  to  Table  25:

Experience  and  Level-Dependent  Benefits.  If  you  added

enough class levels to gain one or more ability score increases,

assign them now. Buy skills for your class levels. Do not multi-

ply the base skill points by 4 for your first class level, because

The  chief  drawback  with  this  method  is  that  all  monsters

standard races can often achieve the same result through

their class features, magic items, or spells. In general, a spe-

cial attack or special quality that a character of a standard

race cannot duplicate is worth a +1 level adjustment. Below

are several specific examples to illustrate how to assign level

adjustments to creatures in the introductory category.

Ability Score Damage: This special attack is worth a +1 level

adjustment unless the affected ability score is Constitution,

in which case the level adjustment rises to +2.

Blindsight: This special quality is worth a +1 level adjust-

ment.

Poison: This special attack is worth a +1 level adjustment

unless the affected ability score is Constitution, in which

case the level adjustment rises to +2.

Scent: This special quality is worth a +1 level adjustment.

Spell-Like Abilities: Since characters of the standard races

generally have access to spells, spell-like abilities are worth a

level adjustment only when those abilities exceed what a

spellcasting character of a level equal to the creatures CR

could do. If the creature can use any spell-like ability at will,

it gains a +1 level adjustment.

Spellcasting Ability: Since characters of the standard races

can generally duplicate this ability, it is worth a level adjust-

ment only when the monsters spellcasting ability exceeds

what a character of a level equal to the creatures CR could

do. If the creature can cast spells at a caster level higher than

its Hit Dice, it gains a +1 level adjustment.

Spell Resistance: This special quality is worth a +1 level

adjustment, regardless of the amount.

Resistance to Energy: This special ability is worth a level

adjustment of +1/2 per energy type (rounded up). Therefore,

electricity resistance 10 by itself is worth a +1 level adjust-

ment; but electricity resistance 10, fire resistance 10, and

sonic resistance 10 together are worth a +2 level adjustment.

Each resistance greater than 20 is worth an additional +1 level

adjustment, so electricity resistance 10, fire resistance 20, and

sonic resistance 10 together are worth a +3 level adjustment.

that benefits most from those scores. Then ask yourself:

Would you rather play a monster character at that ECL, or

a standard character of that level? If you would obviously

rather play the monster character, then your level adjust-

ment is too low. If you would obviously rather play the

standard character, then your level adjustment is too

high.

Level Adjustment Examples

As an example of this process, lets review the level adjust-

ment determination for an ogre (a 4 HD creature) from the

Monster Manual. The table below gives the level adjustments

for each of its applicable abilities.

Ability

Natural armor

10-foot reach

Unbalanced ability score adjustments (+10 Str,

2 Dex, +4 Con, 4 Int, 4 Cha)

Level

Adjustment

+1

An ogres starting ECL calculates as 7 (4 HD +3 level adjust-

ment) using the system above. His highest ability score is

Strength. Would you rather play an ogre with a level of

fighter (ECL 8), or an 8th-level fighter? To play the ogre, you

give up the fighters three (larger) Hit Dice, three bonus

feats, and two ability score increases to gain +10 Strength,

10-foot reach, and natural armor. The fighter seems clearly

better. If you substitute barbarian for fighter, the ogre seems

clearly inferior, since the barbarian has 8d12 (plus Constitu-

tion modifier) for Hit Dice and can rage three times per day,

and the ogre only has 4d8 + 1d12 (plus Constitution modi-

fier) for Hit Dice and can rage only once per day. If you

lower the ogres level adjustment to +2, and compare a 7th-

level fighter to an ECL 7 ogre fighter, the choice is no longer

clearly in favor of either one. Thus, the level adjustment

becomes +2 for the ogre.

THE ACID TEST

Test your level adjustments. To do so, look at the mon-

sters highest ability scores. Assign it one level of the class

Lets review the process again, this time for a kuo-toa (a 2

HD monster). This creatures level adjustment factors are

detailed in the table below.

pqqqqrs

1 HIT DIE CREATURES

A creature with a single Hit Die, like all standard-race charac-

ters, gives up that Hit Die when it gains its first class level. This

makes such a creature somewhat different from other monster

characters. In general, it is most advantageous for a 1 Hit Die

creature with a +0 level adjustment to abandon its monster Hit

Die and take class levels. While this chapter has detailed rules

for  each  step  of  character  creation,  this  sidebar  collects  the

important information for dealing with 1 Hit Die creatures.

points only from class levels, losing any that it had as a result

of its monster Hit Die, but any racial bonuses on skill checks

that the base creature was entitled to are retained. Multiply the

skill points for the characters first class level by 4, just as you

would for any standard-race character. A 1 Hit Die creature may

choose one feat, just like any other 1st-level character, and it

also  gains  any  additional  feats  granted  by  its  class  level.  It

retains any racial bonus feats of the base creature.

When  building  a  monster  character  from  a  1  Hit  Die  crea-

ture,  determine  its  ability  scores  and  the  racial  modifiers  to

those scores normally. Upon taking a level in a class, the crea-

ture  gains  that  classs  base  save  bonuses  and  base  attack

bonus and loses the base save bonuses and base attack bonus

it  had  as  a  monster.  The  new  monster  character  gains  skill

On the other hand, you may wish to keep that one monster

Hit Die. If you do so, the character gets the skill points shown

on  Table  21  or  Table  25  (and  in  Appendix  2:  Compiled

Tables) regardless of its Intelligence score. But in that case, you

do not multiply the skill points gained from the characters first

class level by 4, because it is not a 1st-level character. The char-

acter gets the same number of feats as the base creature.

The lightning bolt special attack is not worth a level adjust-

ment in this case, since it can be used only by multiple kuo-

toa clerics. Adding those factors would raise the Encounter

Level to a point where characters of the standard races

would also have access to the ability as a spell.

Its not easy to make a judgment about the value of the

items grouped under special qualities in the above table,

however. If you go the lowest route and assign a +0 level

adjustment for the whole group, as has been done in the

table, the kuo-toas minimum level adjustment is +4, making

its starting ECL 6. Its highest ability score is Wisdom, so

compare the kuo-toa to a cleric or druid. Clearly, a 7th-level

cleric or druid with 4th-level spells is superior to an ECL 7

kuo-toa cleric with 1st-level spells. Should the level adjust-

ment be +3, then? A 6th-level cleric or druid has consider-

ably more Hit Dice, and therefore more hit points, than an

ECL 6 kuo-toa cleric, plus class abilities, so the standard-race

character is still superior. Thus, despite all it has going for it,

the kuo-toas level adjustment must be +2.

If a player makes a choice for a monster character that the

DM considers suboptimal, such as choosing to play an ettin

wizard rather than an ettin barbarian, the DM may lower the

level adjustment by 1 to represent the monsters reduced

effectiveness.

ABILITY SCORES

Every nonhuman race in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game

has ability score modifiers. For example, a dwarf gets a +2

racial bonus to Constitution and a 2 racial penalty to

Charisma. These are applied to the die rolls you make for

ability scores to determine the final value of each score.

The same principle applies to monster characters. When

you randomly generate ability scores from scratch, you must

determine the ability score modifiers for your base creature

and apply them to your rolls. The ability score modifiers for

the monsters in this chapter can be found in Appendix 2:

Compiled Tables.

Do not roll for any ability score the base creature has that

is less than 6; just use the base creatures score without

applying any further racial modifiers to it. Be aware that

creatures with ability scores below 3 may be unplayable,

and any creature with an Intelligence score below 3 cannot

be a PC, since 3 is the minimum Intelligence score for a

player character.

For a monster not mentioned in this book, subtract either

10 or 11 (whichever leaves an even number) from each abil-

ity score in its Monster Manual entry to determine the

number you add to your ability score roll. For example, a

behir has the following ability scoresStr 26, Dex 13, Con

21, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 12. Subtracting 10 from the even num-

bers and 11 from the odd numbers gives the following racial

ability score modifiers: +16 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +10 Con-

stitution, 4 Intelligence, +4 Wisdom, and +2 Charisma.

ELITE ABILITY SCORES

Alternatively, you may generate character ability scores by

taking the base creatures ability scores and applying the fol-

lowing modifiers to them as you see fit, one per ability score:

+4, +4, +2, +2, +0, 2.

For example, consider the orc. The table below shows the

base ability scores for an orc and demonstrates how a player

or DM could modify them using the elite ability modifiers

to make a usable character with any of five character classes

from the Players Handbook.

Applying the modifers to best advantage for each class

shows that orcs are clearly best suited as fighters. Barbarian

would also seem to be a wise class choice, for the same rea-

sons that the fighter is.

MONSTER FEATURES

A monster character keeps some of the base creatures fea-

tures and loses others. The table below lists what the charac-

ter retains from the base creature.

1 Monster characters retain any racial bonus feats, such as a

mariliths Multidexterity feat.

2 Monster characters retain any racial bonuses to skills and

treat the base creatures skills as class skills.

As shown on the table, a monster character keeps more than

it loses. It loses its monster feats and skills because you are

building a specific character, not the base creature, so you

have the opportunity to make new choices if you wish.

While you may choose the same feats and spend skill points

the same way, you do not have to do so.

Character level or class level never changes a creatures

size  or  its  monster  features  unless  the  base  creatures

description specifies that the feature is based on class level

or character level. Class level in a spellcasting class does

change the caster level for any special ability that has a

caster level. Add class level to the base creatures Hit Dice to

get the new caster level.

Initiative changes if the monsters Dexterity changes or if

it gains or loses a feat such as Improved Initiative. A mon-

sters speed usually changes because it wears heavier or

lighter armor. The creatures land speed does not change,

and the monster does not lose any types of movement. Base

save bonuses change if ability scores or related feats change.

Alignment may change as covered in Chapter 8: Campaigns.

SKILL POINTS AND FEATS

Refer to Monster Character Skill Points and Feats, earlier in

this chapter, for rules about how many skill points and feats

a monster character receives. Table 21: Monster Character

Starting Skill Points gives the number of skill points avail-

able to each monster type.

Using those rules, Tables 22, 26, 27, and 28 provide

the number of skill points available for each base creature

kind covered in this book. Additional skill points granted by

class level follow the rules in the Players Handbook.

A monster character starts with one feat, plus one addi-

tional feat if it has at least 3 Hit Dice, plus an additional feat

for each additional 3 HD it has. It gains additional feats for

class levels by adding the levels to the base creatures Hit

Dice and checking the total against Table 25: Experience

and Level-Dependent Benefits.

LEVEL-DEPENDENT BENEFITS

At this point in building your monster character, treat the

base creatures Hit Dice as its character level and find that

value on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Bene-

fits, below. This table shows any ability score increases or

additional feats that will result from adding class levels to

your monsters Hit Dice.

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits

BASE ATTACK AND BASE SAVES

The base attack bonuses and base saving throw bonuses for

monsters found in this chapter appear in Appendix 2: Com-

piled Tables. Use the Creature Advancement by Type sec-

tion in the introduction of the Monster Manual to calculate

the base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses for

your character if you are using a base creature not found in

this chapter.

Appendix 2: Compiled Tables shows the good saving

throw bonuses for monsters that appear in this chapter, as

well as their base saving throw bonuses. The Creature

Advancement by Type section of the Monster Manual details

the good saving throws by creature type; refer to this section

if you are using a base creature not found in this chapter. A

humanoid gets one good save, but which one that is varies.

For humanoids and similar creatures, subtract the appropri-

ate ability modifiers and modifiers from feats from the base

creatures save bonuses. The highest remaining number is

the good save. In the case of a gnoll, for example, the good

save is Fortitude, which gives a result of +3, after subtracting

the Constitution bonus.

STARTING EQUIPMENT

A monster character gets the starting equipment for a char-

acter of its ECL (see Table 224: Starting Equipment for PCs

above 1st Level in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). It does not,

however, have the treasure noted in its Monster Manual

entry.

LAST DETAILS

A monster character is an individual. It never has addi-

tional base creatures with it unless it has taken the Leader-

ship feat and gained cohorts or followers (see Leadership in

Chapter 2 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide and also the Mon-

ster Cohorts and the Leadership Feat sidebar in Chapter 4

of this book). A monster NPC has a Challenge Rating equal

to the base creatures Challenge Rating plus the characters

class level.

INTERMEDIATE MONSTERS

Intermediate monsters have a few more complications

than those presented in the Introductory Monsters sec-

tion. Not only do intermediate monsters have more factors

in their level adjustment ratings, but some also have level

adjustments greater than their Hit Dicea fact that makes

them particularly challenging to play. See Table 25 for a

list of intermediate monsters covered in this book and

Table 26 for templates that are also at the intermediate

level of complexity.

This section builds on the rules presented in the previous

section, rather than replacing them.

DETERMINING LEVEL ADJUSTMENT

Monsters in this section may have the following additional

features, with the corresponding level adjustments.

Size: Tiny and smaller monsters trade being harder to hit

for lower Strength scores and the need to enter another char-

acters space to engage in melee combat. Such a creature gets

the same 1 level adjustment as a Small creature does.

Breath Weapon: A breath weapon is worth a +1 level

adjustment, at minimum. The greater the blast area and the

higher the damage potential, the higher the level adjust-

ment. See the Breath Weapons and Level Adjustments side-

bar for more information.

pqqqqrs

BREATH WEAPONS AND LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

Any  breath  weapon  is  worth  a  +1  level  adjustment.  Beyond

that, three factors combine to determine how a breath weapon

further affects level adjustment.

The  first  factor  is  the  average  damage  dealt  by  the  breath

weapon.  In  general,  you  can  compare  breath  weapons  with

spells that damage more than one target. If the breath weapon

deals  more  damage  than  a  spell  with  a  similar  effect  that  is

available to casters of the monster characters ECL (calculated

using  the  minimum  +1  level  adjustment  for  the  breath

weapon),  it  should  increase  the  level  adjustment  until  the

breath weapon damage is comparable with that of an appropri-

ate spell. If the breath weapon deals less damage than a compa-

rable spell, it should not modify level adjustment unless it deals

sonic damage or ability damage (see the next paragraph).

level  wizard  could  cast  a  fireball spell  and  deal  6d6  points  of

damage.  Obviously,  the  mephits  breath  weapon  is  not  more

powerful than the fireball, so its level adjustment for the breath

weapon is correctly set at +1.

The second factor is damage type. Generally speaking, sonic

damage  is  worth  a  +1  level  adjustment  because  so  few  crea-

tures have resistance to it. A breath weapon that deals ability

damage  should  increase  the  level  adjustment  by  +1  (or  +2  if

the ability damaged is Constitution), but only if you have not

already  increased  the  level  adjustment  for  the  ability  damage

itself.

Finally, the larger the area that a breath weapon affects, the

higher  its  level  adjustment  should  be.  Again,  comparing  the

extent  of  the  breath  weapons  effect  to  the  area  of  a  similar

spell will help you determine whether a larger than normal level

adjustment is called for. In general, whenever the area of the

breath weapon is twice the size of the area of the comparable

spell, add +1 to the level adjustment.

For example, an air mephit has a breath weapon that deals

1d8  points  of  damage.  The  mephits  ECL  is  6  (assuming  the

minimum  +1  level  adjustment  for  its  breath  weapon).  A  6th-

if it does more damage than standard weapons.

Damage Reduction: This ability is worth at least a +1

level adjustment. Damage reduction that is effective against

weapons with a magical property other than an enhance-

ment bonus is worth a +2 level adjustment.

Fast Healing: Fast healing allows characters to heal with-

out expending spells, potions, or charges of magic items. If

the monster heals 3 or fewer hit points per round, fast heal-

ing is worth a +1 level adjustment. For every additional 3 hit

points (or fraction thereof ) healed, add +1 to the level

adjustment, so that a creature with fast healing 10 has a level

adjustment of +4 from that ability.

Fear: This ability is worth a +1 level adjustment.

Frightful Presence: This ability is worth a +1 level

adjustment.

Gaze: This ability is worth a +1 level adjustment.

Regeneration: This special quality is worth a +2 level

adjustment. Characters with regeneration are, for the most

part, unkillable. They recover from any amount of damage

(except damage of the type to which they are specifically

vulnerable), given enough time.

SPECIAL NOTES

Special considerations apply when using some of the base

creatures on Table 25 to build monster characters. Refer to

the appropriate paragraph below for more information.

Table 26 gives level adjustments for templated creatures

according to the Hit Dice of the base creature. The base crea-

tures Hit Dice, before adding any class levels, determine

what abilities the monster character gets from the template.

See below for more information.

Celestial and Half- Celestial: A DM may rule that a

character who ceases to be of good alignment loses any

supernatural or spell-like abilities granted by its template.

Fiendish and Half-Fiend: A DM may rule that a charac-

ter who ceases to be of evil alignment loses any supernatural

or spell-like abilities granted by its template.

Half-Dragons:  A  half-dragons  level  adjustment  is

derived from the base creatures size, then modified for the

dragon parents type. Determine the base creature, the level

adjustment modifier for the template from the base crea-

tures Hit Dice, and the level adjustment modifier for the

dragon parents color. The total is the level adjustment for

the half-dragon monster character.

Mephits and Summoning

Any mephit has a chance to summon other mephits. How-

ever, any summoned mephit vanishes before it can summon

another mephit (the duration of the summoning is less than

1  hour,  and  a  summoned  mephit  cannot  use  its  own

summon ability for 1 hour after arrival).

pqqqqrs

TEMPLATES AND CLASSES

In most cases, templates have no effect on character classes. The

exceptions are the undead templates. Once a creature becomes

an undead, all its Hit Dice become d12s. Any dice gained after-

ward from class levels are also d12s, regardless of class.

fected  unless  the  template  specifically  indicates  otherwise.

If  the  template  changes  skill  points,  as  the  half-celestial

template  does,  the  change  applies  to  skill  points  gained

from monster Hit Dice and not to skill points gained from

classes.

Adding  Templates  to  Classed  Monsters: If  a  template

changes  the  Hit  Die  type,  this  change  affects  all  previous

Hit  Dice,  including  those  for  class.  Skill  points  are  unaf-

pqqqqrs

Adding Classes to Templated Monsters: With the exception

of undead, as noted above, follow the rules for adding classes

to monsters presented elsewhere in this chapter.

Templated Characters

When building a monster character using a template, apply

the template to the base creature and then derive the start-

ing ECL. If the base creature has 1 Hit Die (like any of the

standard races) or a fractional Hit Die, apply the template to

the creature as if it had 1 class level. Class level does not

affect the Hit Die total when determining the powers

granted by a template. In other words, a celestial elf Ftr 1 has

the same template powers as a celestial elf Ftr 5.

There is one exception to the above rule. When a template

grants spell-like abilities that have a caster level, the total of

the characters Hit Dice plus class level is the caster level.

Some templates change the Hit Die type. For instance,

the base creature Hit Dice of a half-dragon become d12s. See

the Templates and Classes sidebar for the interactions

between templates and classes. For a monster with 1 Hit

Die, this change is likely meaningless, since you will proba-

bly exchange its racial Hit Die for a class Hit Die.

Some templates change the number of skill points avail-

able to the base creature. Use the base creatures standard

Intelligence score (from the Monster Manual), not your char-

acters Intelligence score, to calculate the new skill points

available.

For more information about templates, see Chapter 10:

Templates.

Spellcasting and Monsters

Some monsters have spell-like abilities, which always have

caster levels assigned to them. A few creatures, such as drid-

ers, act as spellcasters with levels equal to their Hit Dice. If

you add caster levels to such a monster, they stack in some

ways and not in others.

Familiars, special mounts, and other special companion

creatures gain abilities according to the masters level in the

appropriate class or classes. Character level, ECL, and total

caster level are irrelevant for familiars and special mounts

for the sake of special abilities gained by either the master or

the companion. However, companion creatures that use the

masters base attack bonus or base save bonuses use the

values accumulated from all the masters levels (including

all class levels and monster Hit Dice).

Monsters that gain cleric levels gain access to domain

spells according to their cleric level.

To determine caster level, spells known, and spells per day

for a monster with a spellcasting class, add its class level to

any monster caster level it has. For example, a young gold

dragon casts spells as a 1st-level sorcerer, and it casts 1st-level

cleric spells and spells from the Law, Luck, and Good

domains as arcane spells. Since the dragon casts as a 1st-level

sorcerer, he can only have 0-level and 1st-level spells in his

repertoire. If he takes levels of sorcerer, he adds those levels

to his monster caster level to determine spells known and

spells per day. He gets bonus spells for Charisma, as a sor-

cerer would. His familiar benefits only from the levels of sor-

cerer in terms of abilities gained, though the familiars effec-

tive Hit Dice, hit points, base attack bonus, and base save

bonuses are all derived from the dragons character level.

A drider is a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard. A drider

character that has chosen to be a 6th-level cleric subse-

quently adds additional levels of cleric to those first 6 levels

to determine spells known and spells per day. It gets bonus

spells for its Wisdom and gains domain spells for all its

cleric levels, including those it gained for being a drider in

the first place.

A nixie has two spell-like abilities at two different caster

levels (water breathing as a 6th-level sorcerer and charm person

as a 4th-level sorcerer). If a nixie character takes levels of

sorcerer, those levels have no effect on its spell-like abilities,

nor do the spell-like abilities have any effect on the charac-

ters spells known, spells per day, or familiar.

ACID TEST: INTERMEDIATE MONSTERS

Lets give the acid test to a few monsters from the interme-

diate list.

As an example of this process, lets review the level adjust-

ment determination for a troll (a 6 HD creature) from the

Monster Manual. The table below gives the level adjustments

for each of its applicable abilities.

Ability

+1 (or +2)

The trolls three natural attacks grant it a +1 level adjustment

because it can make one more attack than a fighter of equal

Hit Dice could. None of these attacks deal exceptional

damage, however. The trolls rend special attack is worth a +1

level adjustment because it deals as much damage as a great-

sword. The creatures unbalanced ability scores are worth at

least a +1 level adjustment, perhaps even a +2, since it gets +12

Strength. It seems reasonable for a trolls level adjustment to

be +7, making its starting ECL 13. But if we add a level of

fighter or barbarian to the troll and compare it with a 14th-

level standard-race fighter or barbarian, the standard-race

character is clearly superior in base attack bonus, skills, feats,

and class abilities. To adjust, look at the trolls abilities. By this

level of play, a +7 natural armor bonus and the scent ability are

not as valuable as they were at earlier levels. Discounting those

gives a +5 level adjustment. While some might feel that a 12th-

level standard-race fighter or barbarian is still better than a

troll with one level of fighter or barbarian (ECL 12), regenera-

tion makes such a character too tough to reduce further.

As a second example, consider a nixie character.

A nixie starts play with a swim speed (+1, or +0 in some cam-

paigns), water breathing, charm person, spell resistance, and

unbalanced ability scores. While water breathing may occa-

sionally be useful, it is not automatically worth a bonus for

the same reasons that a swim speed is not automatically

worth a bonus. In this case, since the campaign contem-

plated does not take place largely underwater, both of these

abilities earn a +0 level adjustment. A nixie uses its spell-like

abilities at levels higher than its Hit Dice, but those caster

levels do not change with added class levels, so the charm

person ability is rated at +1 for level adjustment. A nixies

spell resistance is a fixed number (that is, it does not

improve with class levels), and it earns a +1 level adjustment.

Adding to these a +1 level adjustment for unbalanced ability

scores gives a total level adjustment of +3. A starting ECL of

4 seems right, since nixies use charm person, their most gen-

erally useful ability, as 4th-level sorcerers. In this case, spell

resistance, two spell-like abilities, and above-average ability

scores compensate reasonably well for the characters low

hit points.

The most complex creature among the intermediate mon-

sters is the half-dragon. The easiest way to estimate the level

adjustment for such a character is to apply the template to a

standard race. For example, a character that is a half-orc and

half-dragon gets +10 Strength and +2 Constitution, so it

clearly has unbalanced ability scores. In addition, it has low-

light vision and darkvision, is immune to sleep and paralysis,

gains an additional immunity based on the dragons color,

and gains a +4 natural armor bonus. Its monster Hit Die is

1d12, and since thats the first Hit Die, the character auto-

matically gets 12 + Constitution modifier for hit points from

it. A half-gold dragon character gets a fire breath weapon

(30-foot cone of fire, 6d8 points of fire damage). Such a char-

acters level adjustment is +3. While few people want to play

an ECL 5 character with only 2 Hit Dice, that breath weapon

averages 27 points of damage, compared with an 8th-level

wizards fireball (8d6), which averages 28 points of damage.

ADVANCED MONSTERS

Advanced monsters have more complications than interme-

diate  monsters  do.  Like  the  intermediate  monsters,

advanced monsters might have level adjustments greater

than their Hit Dice, and they are difficult to play. See Table

28 for a list of advanced monsters covered in this book and

Table 29 for templates that are also at the advanced level of

complexity.

As before, this section builds on the rules presented pre-

viously, rather than replacing them.

DETERMINING LEVEL ADJUSTMENT

Monsters in this section may have these additional features,

with the corresponding level adjustments.

Nonabilities: Some creature types have nonabilities, as

explained in the introduction of the Monster Manual. Such

creatures are playable character types, provided that they

still meet the requirements outlined in Choosing a Base

Creature at the start of this chapter. The characters ability

score for a nonability is not 0; your character simply lacks it

altogether. For instance, a vampire player character has no

Constitution score, which gives it a +0 Constitution modi-

fier (see Nonabilities in the introduction of the Monster

Manual). Thus, such a character depends solely on die rolls

for hit points. A check with any Constitution-based skill,

such as Concentration, uses the characters Charisma modi-

fier or its +0 Constitution modifier, whichever is higher.

Fortitude saves are usually unnecessary for a creature with-

out a Constitution score, so feats such as Great Fortitude are

no longer useful. However, a character who already has such

a feat prior to becoming an undead (or otherwise gaining a

nonability) cannot exchange it for a different one.

Type and Subtype: The construct, elemental, or plant

type is automatically worth a +1 level adjustment. The

undead type is usually worth a +2 level adjustment. A crea-

ture with the incorporeal subtype gets an additional +2 level

adjustment.

Energy Drain: This special attack is worth a +2 level

adjustment.

Improved Grab: This special attack is worth a +1 level

adjustment.

Psionics: The ability to use psionics is worth a +2 level

adjustment.

Ray: An attack that functions as a ray is worth a +1 level

adjustment.

Sonic Attack: This special attack is worth a +2 level

adjustment.

Swallow Whole: This special attack is worth a +2 level

adjustment.

Trample: This special attack is worth a +2 level adjust-

ment.

Turn Resistance: Turn resistance of +5 or lower is worth

no level adjustment; turn resistance of +6 or higher is worth

a +1 level adjustment.

Wish: The ability to grant wishes (as the wish spell) is

worth a +3 level adjustment. DMs should strongly consider

forbidding monsters with this ability as characters. Alterna-

tively, a DM may choose to strip such a monster of that

power (and the corresponding +3 level adjustment) before

allowing it in the game as a PC.

pqqqqrs

MAXIMUM LEVELS

Some  monsters  in  this  section  have  very  high  level  adjust-

ments. Monster characters should start play with room for at

least five levels of advancement, so it is recommended that a

monster characters starting ECL be no higher than 15 (though

some  with  higher  starting  ECLs  are  included  for  illustration

pqqqqrs

purposes). As a member of a 15th-level party, a character can

still  adventure  for  five  levels  before  needing  alternative  rules

such as those in the Epic Level Handbook. If you want to adven-

ture longer with your character, then pick a base creature that

gives  you  a  lower  ECL.  DMs  do  not  have  that  concern  when

making NPCs, so they may make characters of any level.

SPECIAL NOTES

Special considerations apply when using some of the base

creatures on Table 28 to build monster characters. Refer to

the appropriate section below.

Constructs

A construct usually has no Intelligence score, which makes

it unsuitable as a character. See the awaken construct spell and

the incarnate construct spell in Chapter 6 for ways of granting

an Intelligence score to a construct.

Demons, Devils, and Summoning

A demon or devil has a chance to summon others of its kind,

or sometimes even fiends of a different kind. However, any

summoned creature vanishes before it can summon another

of its ilk (the duration of the summoning is less than 1 hour,

and a summoned tanarri or baatezu cannot use its own

summon ability for 1 hour after arrival). The DM may rule

that summoning fails when used by a character with an

alignment opposed to the creature it is trying to summon (a

lawful or good demon, for example, or a chaotic or good

devil). A DM may also rule that demons and devils can

choose not to answer a player characters summons if the PC

is engaged in an activity that doesnt aid their side of the

Blood War, or doesnt further their agendas. For instance, a

lawful evil tanarri player character summoning another

tanarri to invade the stronghold of someone allied to the

forces of the Abyss should not get any aid.

Undead

When a cleric tries to turn, rebuke, bolster, or command an

undead character, add any class levels to the characters Hit

Dice and turn resistance to determine the characters effec-

tive Hit Dice for the attempt.

Intelligent undead heal damage normally through rest,

though unintelligent undead do not.

Ghosts, Liches, and Vampires

Because these monsters are so difficult to kill permanently,

their level adjustments are difficult to adjudicate. The DM

should carefully consider the durability of such characters

before allowing them in his or her campaign.

ACID TEST: ADVANCED MONSTERS

Lets continue the acid test examples with a monster from

Table 28. In this table, many of the base creatures have

level  adjustments  greater  than  their  Hit  Dice.  The

homunculus, for instance, only has 2 Hit Dice, but its level

adjustment is +3.

As an example of this process, lets review the level

adjustment determination for an elder stone giant (a 14

HD creature) from the Monster Manual. The table below

gives the level adjustments for each of its applicable

abilities.

levels. Given magic items appropriate for a 20th-level char-

acter, a stone giant elder could be a perfectly viable member

of a 20th-level party.

DRAGONS

Because of the variation available within dragonkind,

these creatures get their own set of level adjustments

(see Table 29). Despite this fact, they are no more diffi-

cult to include in your game than any of the monsters on

Table 28.

DIFFICULT MONSTERS

Any creature not on one of the tables in this chapter falls

into this category. These creatures present tremendous diffi-

culties for both players and DMs when used as characters.

While such a character may be fun for a single session, and

while some players may enjoy the challenges of overcoming

such a characters handicaps, over time these difficult mon-

sters tend to slow the game for the other characters and frus-

trate their own players.

A difficult monster possesses at least one of the following

drawbacks.

pqqqqrs

AWAKENED CHARACTERS

Awaken is  a  5th-level  druid  spell  that  gives  a  tree  or  animal

humanlike  sentience.  Awakened animals  and  trees  treat  the

spellcaster as a friend, but they have no particular bond or empa-

thy  with  the  spellcaster.  An  awakened creature  can  speak  one

language known by the spellcaster, plus one additional language

known by the spellcaster per point of Intelligence bonus (if any).

pqqqqrs

An awakened plant has a score of 3d6 for its Intelligence,

Wisdom,  and  Charisma  (generate  these  normally  by  rolling

4d6  and  discarding  the  lowest  result).  An  awakened animal

has  an  Intelligence  score  of  3d6  (generated  normally  by

rolling  4d6  and  discarding  the

lowest  result),  +1d3

Charisma, and +2 HD.

22

Lack of Life: Constructs and unintelligent undead nor-

mally have no natural healing ability. A construct is  destroyed

when it reaches 0 hit points. An undead can be turned,

destroyed, rebuked, or commanded. In general, living crea-

tures make better player characters than nonliving ones.

Lack of Independence: Many kinds of creatures are sub-

jects of the creature that created them. Vampire spawn,

shadows, and zombies created by mohrgs all fall into this

category. Unlike contracts or oaths of fealty, these bonds

give the master creature complete control over the activities

of its spawn. This control may make the master an interest-

ing character, but it makes for an unfulfilling play experi-

ence when a player character is a spawn.

Lack of Intelligence: Players who want to play some

kind of construct, undead, animal or plant face this obstacle.

An animal or plant can overcome this lack with the awaken

spell (see the Awakened Characters sidebar), The awaken

construct and awaken undead spells, in this book, do the same

for creatures of those types. The incarnate construct spell, in

this book, provides yet another way for constructs to gain

Intelligence scores and other abilities. A creature may also

circumvent its lack of Intelligence with a magic item that

boosts Intelligence, such as a headband of intellect. Items that

raise Intelligence temporarily (such as a potion of Intelligence)

do not remove this obstacle.

When the Intelligence of an animal permanently rises

above 3, the creature becomes a magical beast. When this

occurs, it is no longer vulnerable to spells and effects that

affect its previous type, though its Hit Die size, base attack

bonus, base save bonuses, and other attributes do not change.

DMs may allow awakened animal or plant characters, but

players are advised to consider using anthropomorphic ani-

mals in Appendix 3 of this book instead.

Lack of Anatomy: A creature in this category may have

no thumbs or, like a beholder, have no limbs at all. While it is

possible for such creatures to wear and use some magic items

(a wolf could wear a magic ring in its ear, for instance), they

cannot use many weapons and tools common to adventurers.

DMs may soon tire of asking, How are you holding that?

Lack of Communication: No one wants to sit at a game

session with a strip of duct tape over his mouth and com-

municate solely through gestures. But this is just what may

happen when playing a character who cant talk, doesnt

share a language with the other characters, and doesnt have

telepathy. The DM may choose to rule that the player of

such a character cannot talk during a game session. A grif-

fon is a powerful and intelligent magical beast, but it lacks

the power of speech. Anyone wishing to play a griffon char-

acter is advised to keep this in mind.

MONSTER CHARACTER

BUILDING EXAMPLE

Suppose Peter joins a group of players who all have 5th-level

characters. He gets permission from his DM to create a bug-

bear character (starting ECL 4) named Gnarsht Redeye. Fol-

lowing the Character Creation Basics (see Chapter 1 of this

book), he must first decide how to arrive at Gnarshts ability

scores. The DM reserves elite ability scores for his NPCs,

and Peter is sure he can roll better than the bugbears stan-

dard 11, 10, 11, 10, 10, 11. So he rolls 4d6 and discards the

lowest number for each score. He gets 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and

8. Some quick math and a Monster Manual tell Peter that

Gnarsht has the following racial ability modifiers:_+4

Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, and 2 Charisma.

The next step is choosing a class. Peter decides that Gnarsht

would make a good barbarian. Adding one class level of bar-

barian to a Gnarshts starting ECL of 4 gives him an ECL of 5,

making him the equivalent of a 5th-level character.

He  then  assigns  Gnarshts  ability  scores  as  follows:

Strength 15 (final score 19), Dexterity 10 (final score 12),

Constitution 14 (final score 16), Intelligence 13, Wisdom 8,

and Charisma 12 (final score 10). Then, Peter refers to Table

25. Adding Gnarshts HD (3) to his new barbarian class

level (1), he determines that Gnarshts character level is 4

and at 4th character level, Gnarsht is entitled to an ability

increase. He chooses to add to Gnarshts Strength, giving his

bugbear a total Strength of 20.

BENEATH THE WAVES

Many  adventures  happen  near,  or  on,  bodies  of  water  large

enough  to  submerge  characters.  This  book  allows  players  to

create  aquatic  characters  that  are  more  at  home  under  the

water  than  any  character  aided  by  spells  or  items.  Several

considerations  apply  when  adventuring  underwater;  some

pertain  to  aquatic  creatures,  some  to  nonaquatic  creatures,

and some to both types of creatures.

Holding  Your  Breath  and  Drowning: Covered  under  The

freedom of movement spell or similar effect) take a 2 penalty

on  attack  and  damage  rolls  underwater.  Slashing  weapons,

blunt weapons, claws, and tail attacks deal half damage (after

applying  the  2  penalty,  divide  the  remainder  by  2,  rounding

down), with a minimum of 1 point of damage dealt. The free-

dom  of  movement spell  negates  this  penalty.  Even  creatures

with  a  swim  speed  deal  half  damage  with  slashing  or  blunt

weapons (but not with claws or tail attacks) unless they have a

freedom of movement effect.

Drowning Rule in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Fire: Fire  attacks  are  ineffective  underwater  unless  their

General Hazards: Covered under Water Dangers in Chapter

descriptions specifically say otherwise.

3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Movement: When wading or walking underwater, creatures

move  at  half  speed,  or  at  their  swim  speed  if  they  have  one.

Creatures  benefiting  from  a  freedom  of  movement effect  can

wade or walk on the bottom at their normal speed.

Combat: Creatures without a swim speed (or the benefit of a

provide  a  verbal  component,  you  must  be  able  to  speak  in  a

strong voice. Characters unable to breathe underwater cannot

use  spells  with  verbal  components  unless  they  somehow

surround  their  heads  with  a  bubble  of  air.  Chapter  6:  Spells

provides lists of spells without verbal components.

Peter decides to wait before buying equipment. He notes

that Gnarshts speed is 40 feet (30 feet for bugbear, plus 10

feet for barbarian fast movement). Gnarsht retains the bug-

bears 60-foot darkvision.

Because of his Intelligence bonus, Gnarsht starts with 9

skill points as a bugbear. He also gains a +4 racial bonus on

Move Silently checks. As given in the bugbears entry in the

Monster Manual, a bugbears class skills are Climb, Hide,

Listen, Move Silently, and Spot. Peter decides to spend

Gnarshts bugbear skill points as follows: Climb 3 points,

Hide 3 points, and Move Silently 3 points. As a 1st-level bar-

barian, Gnarsht gets 5 skill points (4 + Int modifier). Peter

spends Gnarshts barbar-

ian skill points as fol-

lows:  Intimidate  3

points,  and  Jump  2

points. Since bug-

bears are Medium-

size,  Gnarsht  does

not  worry  about

size modifiers

to  his  skills.

Peter decides

to keep one of

the bugbears

standard  feat

choices, Alert-

ness, to avoid

being surprised.

He  chooses

Iron Will for

Gnarshts second

feat.

Before doing

any further cal-

culations, Peter

looks at Table 224

in  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs  Guide and

finds that Gnarsht, now

an ECL 5 character, starts

with 9,000 gp worth of equip-

ment. He spends 5,100 gp on a

+2 mithral shirt and 2,350 gp on a +1

greatsword. He buys a cloak of resistance

+1, and  the  remaining  550  gp  go

toward standard adventuring gear and

his cash reserve.

Peter notes that a bugbears good save is Reflex, giving

Gnarsht the following base save bonuses for his monster

Hit Dice:_Fort +1, Reflex +3, Will +1. As a barbarian, he

gains an additional +2 on his Fortitude base save. Peter then

applies the appropriate ability modifiers, the benefit from

Iron Will, and the +1 modifier from the cloak of resistance +1

to find Gnarshts actual save bonuses:_Fort +7, Reflex +5,

Will +3.

To determine Armor Class, Gnarsht keeps the +3 natural

armor bonus he has for being a bugbear. He also gains a +1

bonus to AC for his Dexterity and a +6 bonus for his +2

mithral shirt, giving him a total AC of 20. Gnarshts initiative

modifier is +1, thanks to his Dexterity.

Gnarshts  base  attack  bonus  is  +2  for  being  a  3  HD

humanoid and +1 for being a 1st-level barbarian. A 5th-level

barbarian would have a better base attack bonus, but the

result is not much different from a barbarian with

levels in another class.

Peter knows he keeps the bugbears 3d8 Hit Dice,

but because he increased the characters Constitu-

tion, Gnarsht gets +3 hit points per Hit Die, giving

him 3d8+9 hit points as a bugbear plus 1d12+3 hit

points for a level of barbarian. Peter opts to roll rather

than taking the bugbears average hit points. He takes the

maximum result from the first Hit Die, then rolls a 2 and a 3,

giving  Gnarsht  13  +  9  hit

points just for being a bug-

bear. Peter then rolls a 6 on

the d12 for barbarian

hit points, so Gnarsht

gains  9  more

hit  points  for

being a barbar-

ian,  giving

him a total of

31 hit points.

Here  is

Peters final

character.

DGnarsht:

Male bug-

bear Bbn 1;

ECL 5; Medium-

size humanoid

(goblinoid);

HD 3d8+9 plus

1d12+3; hp 31; Init +1;

Skills and Feats: Climb +7, Hide +4, Intimidate +3, Jump +7,

Listen +1, Move Silently +8, Spot +1; Alertness.

Rage: Gnarsht can fly into a rage once per day for up to 8

rounds. The following changes to the above statistics are in

effect as long as he rages: hp 39; AC 18, touch 9, flat-footed

17; Atk +11 melee (2d6+11/1920, +1 greatsword); SV Fort +9,

Will +3; Str 24, Con 20; Climb +10, Jump +9. After his rage is

over, Gnarsht is fatigued (2 Strength, 2 Dexterity, cant

charge or run) for the duration of that encounter.

his chapter presents rules for treating monster kinds

as character classes. If you want to play a monster

because you think that monster is cool, this material

allows you to emphasize its cool features rather than

just add levels of character classes, such as wizard or

fighter, to an existing creature.

This system is an alternative to the monster advance-

ment system presented in the Monster Manual. While a

DM can advance monsters at will using that system, this

method lets players use Table 25: Experience and

Level-Dependent Benefits from Chapter 2: Building

Monster Characters to advance their monster characters

in such a way that the save DCs for their monster abili-

ties increase with monster level. Clever DMs can also

make use of this method to regress monsters and create

versions with lower CRs, so that those creatures can

appear earlier in their campaigns. For instance, a DM

can use the minotaur monster class to regress a mino-

taur to 1st level (1 HD), making it a reasonable challenge

for 1st-level characters.

Rather than rework all the monsters in the Monster

Manual that could make good characters in this way, this

chapter presents one example to illustrate the technique.

Dozens more appear in Appendix 1: Sample Monster

Classes. Each example discusses the reasoning behind the

decisions made about how that monster advances. Players

and DMs, working together, can use these rules and that

reasoning to develop other monster kinds as classes

for their campaigns.

MONSTER CLASSES AND

LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

Level adjustment is important for determining the

starting ECL of the base creature (see Structure of

Monster Classes, below) because the starting ECL

sets the number of levels over which the monster

develops. Unlike other classes, a monster class has

a maximum number of levels equal to the crea-

tures starting ECL. For example, a minotaurs

starting ECL is 8, so the minotaur monster class

has eight levels.

When using these rules to create a character

with one or more levels in a monster class, you

can ignore level adjustment. This is replaced by

your characters monster class level.

ENTERING A

MONSTER CLASS

The only way to take a level of a monster class is

to be that monster. A mind flayer cannot multi-

class as a minotaur, nor can a human take levels

as an astral deva.

25

AS

STRUCTURE OF MONSTER CLASSES

As noted above, a monster class has a maximum number of

levels equal to its starting ECL. At the highest level for the

class, the monster character should have all the powers and

abilities of the base creature, as given in the Monster Manual.

Unlike the standard classes in the Players Handbook, mon-

ster classes have racial traits as well as character traits. Racial

traits are not given in the class tables themselves; they

appear as a separate section before the Class Features section

for each monster. Generate ability scores for a monster

character as you would for a character of a standard

race, and then apply any racial modifiers using

the racial traits given for that class. Most mon-

ster characters do not start with the full racial

ability score adjustments that a monster of

the same kind right out of the Monster

Manual would be entitled to; they gain

ability score increases over several

levels, as a character of any standard

class would.

A  monster  class  description

does  not  repeat  information

about the base creatures type

or subtype. A monster charac-

ter  gains  the  benefits  and

drawbacks of its type and sub-

type at first level. It retains the

base creatures alignment subtypes,

even if it actually has a different align-

ment  (see  the  Ritual  of  Alignment  in

Chapter 11: Becoming a Monster for one way to

reconcile subtype and alignment). A monster char-

acter  uses  its  actual  alignment  or  its  subtype,

whichever produces the worse result, for purposes of

spells and effects. For example, a lawful good succubus

is still vulnerable to holy smite because it has the

chaotic and evil subtypes.

Monster class abilities that are exactly like

the creatures abilities as given in the Monster

Manual  are  not  reproduced  in  a  class

description, but they do appear on the

class table. See the Monster Manual for

information on these abilities.

When a monster class description

refers to level, this means level

in the monster class. Levels and

Hit  Dice  gained  in  monster

classes do change special abili-

ties. For the effect of levels in non-

monster classes (standard or prestige classes) on monster

special abilities, see Monster Features in Chapter 2:

Building Monster Characters.

SIZE AND SPEED

A monster character always starts out as Medium-size

at the largest. Monsters that are Large or larger in the

Monster Manual increase in size over the course of sev-

eral levels. See the Monster Manual and the Players Hand-

book for the general effects of size changes on Armor

Class, attack bonus, Hide checks, grapple checks, and so

on. Do not change natural armor bonus or ability scores

when size changes; those alterations are built into each

class progression.

Some monsters become faster as they gain levels. The

higher speed appears in the monsters class table and

replaces the creatures original land speed.

SKILL POINTS

Monster classes grant skill points the way standard classes

do. The monsters 1st-level skill points are multiplied by 4, as

with standard classes. Table 21: Monster Character Starting

Skill Points gives the skill points that a monster starts with,

based on its Intelligence modifier and its type. The tables for

the sample classes in Appendix 1 show how the monster

gains skill points as it advances in level in its monster class.

The skills given for the base creature from the Monster

Manual are class skills for the monster class.

CHALLENGE RATING

Each monster class table has a CR (Challenge Rating)

column. This has no meaning for players or player charac-

ters and is given only as an aid to DMs who want to adjust

monster CRs by regressing existing creatures.

NATURAL ATTACKS

Many monsters have natural attacks. Members of the corre-

sponding monster class are always proficient with their own

natural weapons. Using a natural attack does not provoke an

attack of opportunity unless the class description specifies

otherwise. A monster does not get iterative attacks (multi-

ple attacks with the same weapon at a cumulative 5 penalty,

as a manufactured weapon would provide) on a full attack

action with its natural weapons unless the class description

specifies otherwise. A monster character can use any of its

natural weapons as a secondary attack at a 5 penalty on the

attack roll, but it may not use a secondary attack as a primary

attack, even if it doesnt choose to use its actual primary

attack in a given round. The Multiattack feat described in

the Monster Manual can reduce the penalty on secondary

attacks to 2.

MONSTERS BELOW 1 HD

It is possible for a monster to complete its class progression

and still not have a full Hit Die. For instance, the grig has

only a fractional Hit Die at its full potential. When such a

creature takes its first level in a class other than its monster

class, do not roll the class Hit Die for hit points. Instead, use

the maximum possible result for that classs Hit Die.

MONSTER CLASSES AND MULTICLASSING

A monster character using these rules may not multiclass

until it completes the full progression in its monster

class. This rule keeps characters from gaining the bene-

fits of a monsters type and then quickly switching to a

standard class.

A monster class imposes an experience point penalty for

multiclassing, just as other classes do (depending on pre-

ferred classes for the creature or race). A monster class is a

character class for purposes of determining whether a char-

acter takes an experience point penalty. See the sample

classes in Appendix 1 for specifics.

MONSTER CLASSES AND

LEVEL-DEPENDENT BENEFITS

A character progressing in a monster class gains feats and

ability score increases according to Table 25: Experience

and Level-Dependent Benefits. That table also limits their

maximum ranks in class and cross-class skills. Each monster

class description specifies when the character gains feats

and ability score increases.

READING THE CLASS TABLES

The following notes explain how to interpret certain infor-

mation noted on a monster class table.

Ability Score Increases: At various levels, a character

progressing  in  a  monster  class  receives  ability  score

increases. The table for that class shows how much to

change the ability score at that level. For instance, the mino-

taur gains +2 Strength at 2nd, 4th, and 6th level. That means

you should increase the Strength score by +2 at 2nd level, +2

at 4th level, and +2 at 6th level (for a total of 6 points higher

than the base value at 1st level).

Natural Armor Bonuses: At various levels, members of

some monster classes receive natural armor bonuses. The

table for such a class gives the total natural armor bonus the

creature has at that level. Do not add these bonuses together,

as is done for ability score increases.

EXAMPLE MONSTER

CHARACTER: MINOTAUR

The minotaur is one of the strongest and most combative of

the monstrous humanoids. Graced with a powerful gore

attacksand familiarity with weapons, the minotaur repre-

sents a tough opponent for dungeon-exploring heroes. Now,

the minotaur class allows the cunning and ferocity of this

classic foe to work to the benefit of player characters.

Building the minotaur monster class requires examining

each of the components that make the monster formidable

in  combat:  Strength,  size,  natural  armor,  and  natural

attacks. Then, slowly parcel out those benefits in stages

until the minotaur reaches its final ECL of 8 (including its

+2 level adjustment). A 1st-level minotaur has a hint of its

eventual Strength but must tolerate penalties to Intelli-

gence and Charisma. It also has a natural attack, the ability

to charge for increased damage, and a small natural armor

bonus. The rest of the minotaurs abilities are upgraded

along these lines as smoothly as possible until it reaches 8th

level (6 HD). For much of this time, the immature mino-

taur lacks the advantage of Large size (and the 10-foot reach

it provides). The minotaur grows to its full adult Large size

upon reaching 6th level.

After reaching 8th level, the minotaur can continue to

advance using the monster advancement rules in the Mon-

ster Manual, if desired. Monstrous humanoids have a great

base attack progression (equal to a fighters) and two good

saves, so there is good incentive to advance in this way.

Other good options for continuing to develop a minotaur

character include advancing as a fighter (for the bonus

feats), a barbarian (for rage and certain skills), or a rogue (for

sneak attacks and even more skills).

RACIAL TRAITS

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str, +2 Dex, 4 Int,

2  Cha.  While  known  for  cunning  and  ferocity,  mino-

taurs rely on Strength and natural weaponry to overcome

their  foes.  The  minotaurs  Strength  and  Constitution

increase as it gains levels, while its Dexterity decreases.

Speed: Minotaur land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Minotaurs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Giant.  A  minotaur  with  enough

Intelligence  to  receive  a  bonus  language  usually  makes

Common its first choice.

Though  they  are  classified  as  monstrous  humanoids,

minotaurs  frequently  associate  with  various  giant  kinds,

including ogres, ettins, and true giants. Their size makes

minotaurs accepted among these monsters when smaller

beings would not be.

Favored  Class:  Minotaur. The  best  multiclassing  choices

for a minotaur are fighter, barbarian, and ranger.

CLASS SKILLS

The minotaurs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis),

Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a minotaur takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the minotaur mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Minotaurs are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, with light and

medium armor, and with shields.

Feats: A minotaur receives one feat at 1st level, one at 4th

level, and another at 8th level. After 8th level, it gains feats

normally according to its effective character level (the total

of its Hit Dice, level adjustment, and class levels) as shown

on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Keen Senses (Ex): A 1st-level minotaur gains a +1

racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. At 4th

level, the bonus rises to +2, at 6th level to +3, and at 8th

level to +4.

Natural Cunning (Ex): Most minotaurs are not clever,

but they all possess an innate logical ability. At 2nd level, a

minotaur can never become lost. At 4th level, when it devel-

ops the scent ability, it can track creatures by smell. At 7th

level, a minotaur becomes immune to maze spells and is

never flat-footed.

Scent (Ex): A minotaur has a keen sense of smell. Begin-

ning at 4th level, it can detect opponents within the given

range (double range if the scent is upwind, one-half range if

it is downwind) and may take a move-equivalent action to

determine the direction of a scent. If an odor source, such as

an opponent, is within 5 feet, the minotaur can pinpoint

that source. Minotaurs can use the scent ability to track an

enemy by smell.

Large Size: At 6th level, a minotaur grows to Large size

and its natural reach extends to 10 feet. It incurs the usual

penalties for Large creatures.

Gore: A gore is a natural attack. Beginning at 1st level, a

minotaur deals 1d4 points of damage plus its Strength mod-

ifier when making a gore attack. At 3rd level the base

damage rises to 1d6, and at 7th level to 1d8. When a mino-

taur charges to make a gore attack, it deals additional

damage according to the following table. A minotaur adds

one and one-half times its Strength modifier to its gore

damage when charging.

Gore Damage

1d4

1d6

1d8

Charge Damage

2d6

2d8

4d6

Because a gore is a natural attack, a minotaur can use the full

attack action to attack with a melee weapon and follow up

with its gore attack as a secondary attack at a 5 penalty. It

does get iterative attacks (multiple attacks with the same

weapon at a cumulative 5 penalty), if it is entitled to any,

with its melee weapon (but not with its gore) when using

such an attack routine.

28

his chapter presents new feats that are particularly

useful to monster characters.

Some monsters also gain bonus feats as racial traits,

as indicated in their Monster Manual descriptions.

WHEN MONSTERS

GAIN FEATS

Monster characters receive feats at the same rate that char-

acters of standard races do: one for their first Hit Die (or

fractional HD), one more for having 3 Hit Dice, and an

additional one for each additional 3 HD the character has.

When adding class levels to a monster, you keep the

number of feats determined by the monsters Hit Dice. The

character doesnt gain a bonus feat for its first class level

because it isnt a 1st-level character (see below for the

exception to this rule). Add class levels and Hit Dice, then

refer to Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Bene-

fits in Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters. The Feats

column indicates when the character gets its next feat. For

instance, if a 6 HD monster takes a level in some class, its

level plus Hit Dice equals 7. That character wont gain

another feat until it gains two more Hit Dice (character

level 9th).

If your base creature has only 1 Hit Die and you choose

to replace that with a class level (thus losing the associated

base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, skill points,

and feats), then your character gains a feat at 1st level, just

like any other 1st-level character.

MONSTROUS FEATS

Many of the feats described in this chapter belong to

a new category, monstrous feats (see the second half

of Table 41, on page 32). Only creatures with a

monstrous form or one or more monstrous abilities

may select these feats. Monstrous forms and abili-

ties  are  those  that  are  unavailable  to  normal

humanoid or animal creatures, including but not

limited  to  extra  appendages,  nonstandard

appendages (such as tentacles or a tail), supernat-

ural abilities, and spell-like abilities. With your

DMs permission, you may be able to choose

monstrous feats for your character if your char-

acter acquired unusual abilities through trans-

formation or by advancing in a prestige class.

BACKGROUND FEATS

Another  new  category  of  feat  is  the  back-

ground feat (see the first half of Table 41, on

page 31). You can choose a background feat for

your character if the Climate/Terrain entry for

the base creature mentions the indicated type 29

AS

of terrain or climate. If the base creatures terrain entry

includes more than one specific terrain type, it may be eligi-

ble for additional background feats, at the DMs discretion.

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS

Feat descriptions use the following format.

FEAT NAME [TYPE OF FEAT]

The initial text after the feat name describes generally what

the feat does in plain language.

Prerequisite: A prerequisite is a minimum ability score,

creature type, minimum size or physical characteristic, a min-

imum base attack bonus, another feat or feats, minimum

ranks in one or more skills, or a class feature that a character

must have in order to acquire a particular feat. A feat may have

more than one specific requirement; in such a case, all of

them are still referred to collectively as the feats prerequisite.

Benefit: A feats benefit is what it enables the character

to do. If a character takes the same feat more than once, its

benefits do not stack unless otherwise indicated in the feat

description.

Normal: This section describes what a character who

does not have a particular feat is limited to or restricted

from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular

drawback, this entry is absent.

Special: This section gives additional facts about the feat

that may be helpful when in deciding whether to acquire it.

NEW FEATS

ABILITY FOCUS [GENERAL]

Choose one of your special attacks. This attack becomes

more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Special attack.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC for all saving throws against

the special attack on which you focus.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects

do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new

special attack.

AREA ATTACK [GENERAL]

You can wield improvised weapons to attack several spaces

at once.

Prerequisite: Str 19, Huge size, Power Attack.

Benefit: You can use your great size and strength to pick

up a heavy object and attack an area as a standard action.

Such an attack may consist of swinging a large log or

smashing a door down on opponents heads. The area

affected is a half-circle with a radius equal to your reach.

You deal damage to all creatures two or more size categories

smaller than you within the area. The base damage dealt

depends on your size category, as given on the table below.

Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base damage to

determine the total damage for the attack.

Size Category

Huge

Gargantuan

Colossal

Damage

1d8

2d6

2d8

Though it can deal significant damage, this form of attack is

awkward and unbalancing. You incur a 2 penalty to your

Armor Class and on Reflex saves until your next action.

ASSUME SUPERNATURAL ABILITY

[GENERAL]

You learn to use a supernatural ability of an assumed form.

Prerequisite: Wis 13, ability to assume a new form mag-

ically.

Benefit: You learn to use a single supernatural ability of

another kind of creature while assuming its form through a

polymorph self spell or a similar effect. The saving throw DC

against this ability is based on your ability scores, not those

of a standard creature of the kind whose form youve

assumed. For a breath weapon, the saving throw DC is 10 +

your Constitution modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice (rounded

down). For all other supernatural abilities, the saving throw

(if any) DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your Hit

Dice (rounded down).

If a creature, such as an undead, has no Constitution

score, use its Charisma modifier or its Constitution modi-

fier (+0 for a nonability), whichever is higher, to determine

the save DC.

Using this alien ability is disorienting. You take a 2

penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and

ability checks. Additionally, in a stressful or demanding sit-

uation (such as combat), you must succeed on a Will save

(DC 19) or be unable to use the ability.

Normal: Without this feat, you cannot use the supernat-

ural abilities of a creature whose form you assume.

neutral  and  good  communities  are  liable  to  drive  away

monsters and those who would associate with them.

OPTIONAL RULE:

TRAINING IN MONSTROUS FEATS

A creature from the Monster Manual may take any monstrous

feat,  as  well  as  any  feat  already  available  to  characters,

provided  that  it  meets  the  prerequisites.  The  character  may

have discovered the talent independently, or may have learned

it from a monstrous companion. Many monstrous beings are

not  tolerated  by  the  surrounding  community  and  must  keep

their existence secret. Evil communities may tolerate the pres-

ence  of  monsters  that  other  communities  would  not,  but

pqqqqrs

Learning a feat from another monster can lead to interesting

adventure  opportunities.  As  an  optional  rule,  the  Dungeon

Master  can  require  that  a  monstrous  character  undertake  a

quest for a desired feat. This works best if the feat is one with

many prerequisitesit is a long and difficult path to discovery.

For  example,  learning  the  secret  of  Improved  Multiweapon

Fighting might entail seeking out a xill ranger in its extraplanar

haunts.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. You cannot

apply it more than once to the same special ability in order

to improve the Will save DC. Each time you take this feat, it

applies to a different special ability.

BLOWHARD [GENERAL]

You can blow targets over with your breath.

Prerequisite: Con 20, Huge size, Power Attack.

Benefit: As an attack action, you can use your breath to

affect all creatures in a cone 5 feet in length per point of your

Constitution bonus. Each creature in the area is affected as

through struck by a wind effect (see Table 317: Wind Effects

in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). The strength of the wind effect

depends on your size category, as given on the table below.

Windstorm

If you have a breath weapon, you cannot use this feat and

your breath weapon at the same time.

BONUS BREATH [MONSTROUS]

You can use your breath weapon one more time per day

than you normally could.

Prerequisite: Breath weapon with limited uses per day,

Extend Spell or Extend Spell-Like Ability.

Benefit: You can breathe one additional time per day.

The interval you must wait between breaths is 1 hour.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time

you take it, you can breathe one additional time per day.

above. Add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus to this base

damage to determine the total damage for the attack.

A crush attack deals bludgeoning damage and affects as

many creatures as can fit under your body (see Large and

Small Creatures in Combat in Chapter 8 of the Player s

Handbook). Each creature in the affected area must succeed

on a Reflex save (DC 10 + your Str modifier + your size mod-

ifier for grapple attacks). On a failure, the opponent is

pinned and automatically takes crush damage each round

the pin is maintained.

CUMBROUS DODGE [GENERAL]

You have a chance to dodge attacks that hit you, but at a

cost.

Prerequisites: Dodge, Tumble 4 ranks.

Benefit: You may activate this feat as a free action. You

gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class for the rest of the cur-

rent encounter. At the end of the encounter, you are

fatigued. For details on fatigue, see the Condition Summary

in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

CUMBROUS FORTITUDE [GENERAL]

You have a greater chance than normal to resist attacks

against your vitality, but at a cost.

Prerequisites: Great Fortitude.

Benefit: Before rolling a Fortitude save, you can decide

to activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your

saving throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless

of  the  result,  you  are  staggered  until  the  end  of  the

encounter. A staggered character can take only a partial

action when he or she would normally be able to take a

standard action.

CONTROLLED RESPIRATION [GENERAL]

CUMBROUS REFLEXES [GENERAL]

You can stay out of water longer than you otherwise could.

Prerequisite: Time limit on how long you can remain

out of water, Endurance.

Benefit: You can control your breathing so as to remain

out of water for a longer period of time than you otherwise

could. Double the normal time limit after which you must

begin making Constitution checks to avoid suffocation.

This feat does not allow creatures that cannot normally

breathe air, such as fish, to do so.

You have a greater chance to resist attacks against your

agility, but at a cost.

Prerequisites: Lightning Reflexes.

Benefit: Before rolling a Reflex save, you can decide to

activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving

throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the

result, you are prone and dazed. For details on these condi-

tions, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide.

CRUSH [GENERAL]

CUMBROUS WILL [GENERAL]

Like a dragon, you can hurl your body onto opponents to

deal tremendous damage.

Prerequisite: Huge size.

Size Category

Huge

Gargantuan

Colossal

Crush Base Damage

2d8

4d6

4d8

You have a greater chance to resist attacks against your

willpower, but at a cost.

Prerequisites: Iron Will.

Benefit: Before rolling a Will save, you can decide to

activate this feat, which gives you a +6 bonus on your saving

throw. After the saving throw is resolved, regardless of the

result, you are shaken until the end of the encounter. A

shaken character takes a 2 morale penalty on attack rolls,

checks, and saving throws.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can jump or fall onto

opponents, using your whole body to crush them. This

attack is useful only against creatures at least three size cat-

egories smaller than yourself. The base damage for a crush

attack depends on your size category, as given on the table

DEADLY POISON [MONSTROUS]

Your poison attack deals more damage than normal.

Prerequisite: Con 19, poison special attack that deals

ability damage as secondary damage, Virulent Poison.

Desert terrain

Plains terrain

Hill or mountain terrain

Marsh terrain

Cold climate

Benefit: Your poison attack has the potential to deal

more potent secondary damage than it otherwise could. If

the subject of the attack fails the second saving throw, the

poison deals double its normal secondary damage.

DEEP DENIZEN [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a subterranean environment.

Prerequisite: Underground as sole terrain type.

Benefit: Living underground has made you more reliant

on nonvisual senses than surface dwellers. You gain a +2

competence bonus on Listen checks and a +4 competence

bonus when tracking by scent.

DESERT DWELLER [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a desert environment.

Prerequisite: Desert terrain type.

Benefit: As a desert dweller, you are more hardy than

those who live in more gentle climates. Your Fortitude save

DC to avoid subdual damage from heat is reduced to 10 (see

Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

In addition, you can go without water for a number of

hours equal to 24 + twice your Constitution score (see Star-

vation and Thirst Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide).

DETACH [MONSTROUS]

You can remove a part of your body and use it as a ranged

weapon.

Prerequisite: Con 19, regeneration.

Benefit: As an attack action, you can detach a portion of

your body that can make a melee attack other than a bite

(such as a paw, tail, or tentacle) and use it as a thrown weapon

(range increment 20 feet). The thrown member deals its base

damage plus your Strength bonus (not 1 1/2 times your

Strength bonus). Special attacks that deal damage, such as

poison and acid, take effect normally from the thrown

member. Ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain

attacks cannot be made with the detached body part.

2 You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new weapon, skill,

school of magic, selection of spells, or spell-like ability.

Special: Tearing off a piece of yourself is traumatic. You

take subdual damage equal to one-quarter of your full

normal hit point total. Damage reduction cannot reduce

the amount of damage taken in this way.

DUST CLOUD [MONSTROUS]

You can sweep dust into the air to hide from opponents.

Prerequisites:  Dex  19,  Int  19,  Huge  size,  Combat

Reflexes, wings or tail.

Benefit: As an attack action, you can sweep a limb across

the ground and create a dust cloud. This hemispherical

cloud has a radius in feet equal to 20  your Hit Dice. Creat-

ing the cloud has a 50% chance to snuff unprotected flames

(candles, torches, small campfires) of nonmagical origin in

the area. The cloud obscures vision, and creatures caught

within are blinded while inside and for 1 round after

emerging. Any creature caught in the cloud must succeed

on a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice +

your Str modifier) to cast a spell. The cloud lasts a number

of rounds equal to 1 + your Dexterity modifier.

Special: A flying creature with this feat must be within

reach of the ground to create the effect, but need not actu-

ally be in contact with it.

EMPOWER SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

You  can  use  a  spell-like  ability  with  greater  effect  than

normal.

Prerequisite: Spell-like ability caster level 4th.

Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject

to  the  restrictions  below.  You  can  use  that  ability  as  an

empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if

the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

When  you  use  an  empowered  spell-like  ability,  all  vari-

able, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased

by one-half. An empowered spel-like ability does half again

as  much  damage  as  normal,  cures  half  again  as  many  hit

points, affects half again as many targets, and so on as appro-

priate. For example, a night hags empowered magic missile

deals 1 1/2 times normal damage (roll 1d4+1 and multiply

the  result  by  1  1/2  for  each  missile).  Saving  throws  and

opposed rolls (such as the one made when a character casts

dispel  magic)  are  not  affected.  Spell-like  abilities  without

random variables are not affected.

You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell

with a level less than or equal to one-half yourcaster level

(round down),  2. See the table below. For example, a crea-

ture that uses its spell-like abilities as a 13th-level caster can

only  empower  spell-like  abilities  duplicating  spells  of  4th

level or lower.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, you can apply it to another one of your spell-like

abilites.

EXTENDED REACH [MONSTROUS]

Your flexible body allows you to reach farther than normal.

Prerequisite: Small or larger size, nonrigid body or

a nonrigid attack form such as a tentacle, feeler, or

pseudopod.

Benefit: Your body or a part of your body with which

you can deliver a melee attack is boneless and flexible,

allowing you to threaten a larger than normal area with

melee attacks. Add +5 feet to your normal reach.

EXTRA ITEM SPACE [MONSTROUS]

You can wear more magic items than are normally allowed.

Prerequisite: Multiple limbs or heads.

Benefit: You can wear one additional magic item beyond

the normal limit for the item type in question. The multiple

limbs you have must correspond to the limb on which that

item type is normally worn. For example, a character is nor-

mally limited to two rings, but a marilith (with six arms)

could wear three rings with this feat. Likewise, an ettin

(with two heads) could wear two periapts or necklaces

instead of the one normally allowed.

Normal: Usually only one or two magic items that are

restricted to a particular body part can be used at once.

Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time,

it adds a new item space. You cannot have more item spaces

than you have limbs or body parts of the appropriate kind.

FINAL STRIKE [MONSTROUS]

Your death throes are destructive.

Prerequisite: Acid, air, cold, earth, electricity, fire, or

water subtype.

Benefit: When you are killed (that is, when your hit

points drop to 10 or lower), your body explodes in a final

strikea blast of elemental destructionaccording to the

table below. Everything within 60 feet is subject to the

effect. Your final strike deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit

Die, up to a maximum of 20d6. Each creature in the area

may make a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit

Dice + your Con modifier) to halve the damage dealt. The

blast also has a secondary effect, which can be reduced or

negated (as shown on the table below) by a second success-

ful save of the type indicated (same DC_as the save against

the primary damage).

Special: A final strike renders your corpse unsuitable for

raise dead or resurrection spells. Only true resurrection, miracle,

or wish can restore life.

FLING ENEMY [GENERAL]

You can pick up an opponent and fling it.

Prerequisites: Str 23, Huge size, improved grab.

Benefit: You can make a grapple check at a 20 penalty

against an opponent at least two size categories smaller than

you. If you succeed, on your next action you can use an

attack action to fling the held opponent. The range incre-

ment for the thrown creature is 120 feet.

A creature may be thrown horizontally or vertically. If

thrown vertically, it takes normal falling damage. If thrown

horizontally, it takes damage as if it had fallen half the dis-

tance thrown (rounded down). For example, if a hurled orc

is thrown horizontally 170 feet, it takes 8d6 points of

damage.

You may also fling the creature at another creature. To do

so, make an attack roll at a 4 penalty, with appropriate

range penalties, against the target creature. If you hit, both

creatures take the amount of damage that the thrown crea-

ture would have taken otherwise, as given above.

GAPE OF THE SERPENT [GENERAL]

You can swallow larger creatures than normal.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature can make a single

flyby attack in a round.

Prerequisite: Swallow whole.

Benefit: You can swallow a creature of up to your own

size category. Like a snake, you can stretch your mouth to an

outlandish extent to accommodate immense prey. However,

this process is time-consuming. If your second grapple

check is successful after you have established a hold against

a creature larger than you could swallow normally, you

begin to swallow the held creature. On the following round,

you must make an additional grapple check to complete the

swallowing. The held creature can fight or try to break the

grapple as normal while you are attempting to swallow it.

Normal: Unless otherwise noted, a creature can swallow

opponents no larger than two size categories smaller than itself.

Special: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maxi-

mum size; other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures

remain the same.

GRASS TREKKER [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a plains environment.

Prerequisite: Plains terrain type.

Benefit: You are a nomad of the steppes, used to travel-

ing long distances, often on foot. You gain a +2 competence

bonus on Jump checks. In addition, you do not need to

make Fortitude saves when making a forced march until

you have traveled for 12 hours (see Movement in Chapter 9

of the Players Handbook). The save DC for longer travel is 10

+ 1 per hour beyond 12.

GREAT FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]

You can make multiple flyby attacks in a round.

Prerequisite: Fly speed, Flyby Attack.

Benefit: Using this feat is a full-round action. When

flying, you can move up to your fly speed in a straight line

and attack a number of opponents equal to your Dexterity

bonus. All targets must be within your reach along the line

of your movement. Make one attack roll, add the appropri-

ate modifiers, and compare the result to the AC of each

opponent you are attacking. If any hits are successful, make

one damage roll and add the appropriate modifiers. Each

successful hit does the full damage to that creature; do not

divide the result of the damage roll among the targets. Tar-

gets of your attack do not get attacks of opportunity against

you, but other opponents that would be entitled to attacks

of opportunity may take them.

GREATER MULTIGRAB [MONSTROUS]

You can grapple enemies effortlessly with your natural

weapons.

Prerequisite: Str 19, Dex 15, improved grab, Multigrab.

Benefit: When grappling an opponent with only the

part of your body that made the attack, you take no penalty

on grapple checks to maintain the hold.

Normal: Without this feat, you take a 20 penalty (or a

10 penalty with Multigrab) on grapple checks to maintain

a hold with only the part of your body used to make the

attack.

GREATER MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING

[MONSTROUS]

A creature with three or more arms can fight with a weapon

in each hand. The creature can make up to three attacks per

round with each extra weapon.

Prerequisites: Dex 19, three arms, base attack bonus

+15, Improved Multiweapon Fighting, Multiweapon Fight-

ing, Multidexterity.

Benefit: You may make up to three attacks with each off-

hand weapon that you wield, albeit with a 10 penalty on

the third attack with each such weapon.

Special: This feat replaces the Greater Two-Weapon

Fighting feat (originally presented in Masters of the Wild) for

creatures with more than two arms.

GREATER MIGHTY ROAR [MONSTROUS]

You unsettle opponents with a dreadful roar as you attack.

Prerequisite: Animal or magical beast; Large size,

Mighty Roar.

Benefit: This feat functions like Mighty Roar, except

that each opponent that fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your

Hit Dice + your Cha modifier) is panicked for 2d6 rounds. A

panicked creature takes a 2 morale penalty on attack rolls,

saves, and checks, has a 50% chance to drop what it is hold-

ing, and runs away from you as quickly as it can. The effects

of being panicked supersede the effects of being shaken.

IMPROVED ASSUME SUPERNATURAL

ABILITY [GENERAL]

You gain skill with using a supernatural ability of an

assumed form.

MONSTER COHORTS AND THE LEADERSHIP FEAT

Chapter  2  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide describes  the

Leadership  feat,  which  enables  characters  to  attract  loyal

companions and devoted followers. A character can develop a

cohort to accompany him on his adventures. There, Table 225

provides this cohorts level, as determined by the primary char-

acters  level,  Charisma  modifier,  and  a  few  special  modifiers

(Table 226 lists those).

need  not  limit  yourself  to  a  short  list  of  thirteen  monsters

when any viable creature from the Monster Manual now has a

starting ECL (see Appendix 2: Compiled Tables). The DM can

work  with  players,  if  he  or  she  approves  this  use  of  the

Leadership  feat,  to  generate  a  monster  cohort.  Refer  to  the

cohort  level  provided  by  Table  225  and  choose  a  monster

with an equal or lesser starting ECL. Remember that regard-

less  of  his  Leadership  score,  a  character  cannot  attract  a

cohort whose level (or starting ECL, in this case) is equal to or

higher than his own.

In  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide,  Table  227  provides  a  few

special  cohorts  along  with  their  level  equivalents,  but  you

Prerequisite: Wis 17, Assume Supernatural Ability, abil-

ity to assume a new form magically.

Benefit: This feat functions like Assume Supernatural

Ability, except that you do not take the 2 penalty on all

attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks when

using it.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times, but you

cannot apply it more than once to the same special ability.

Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different spe-

cial ability.

IMPROVED FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]

You can attack on the wing with increased mobility.

Prerequisite: Fly speed, Dodge, Flyby Attack, Mobility.

Benefit:  When  flying,  you  can  take  a  move  action

(including a dive) and another partial action at any point

during the move. If this partial action is an attack, you incur

no attacks of opportunity for moving through areas threat-

ened by your target. You cannot take a second move action

during a round when you make a flyby attack.

Normal: Without this feat, you can take a partial

action either before or after your move. Even with the

Flyby Attack feat, you incur attacks of opportunity for

moving through areas threatened by the target of your

flyby attack.

IMPROVED MULTIATTACK [MONSTROUS]

You are particularly adept at using all your natural weapons

at once.

Prerequisite: Three natural weapons, Multiattack.

Benefit: The usual 5 penalty on attack rolls for second-

ary attacks does not apply to your secondary attacks with

natural weapons. The damage bonus for such attacks is still

only 1/2 your Strength bonus, if any.

Normal: Without this feat, your secondary natural

attacks take a 5 penalty (or a 2 penalty if you have the

Multiattack feat).

IMPROVED MULTIWEAPON FIGHTING

[MONSTROUS]

You are expert at fighting with a weapon in each of your

three or more hands. You can make up to two attacks per

round with each off-hand weapon.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, three arms, base attack bonus +9,

Multidexterity, Multiweapon Fighting.

Benefit: In addition to the single extra attack you get

each round with each off-hand weapon from Multiweapon

Fighting, you get a second extra attack with each such

weapon, albeit at a 5 penalty.

out hidden foes within 60 feet. For strong scents, such as

smoke or rotting garbage, double these ranges. Overpower-

ing scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be

detected at triple normal range.

Normal: Without this feat, you can detect creatures by

smell only within 30 feet.

IMPROVED TURN RESISTANCE

[MONSTROUS]

You have a better than normal chance to resist turning.

Prerequisites: Undead.

Benefit: You are less easily affected by clerics or paladins

than you normally would be (see Turn and Rebuke Undead

in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook). When resolving a

turn, rebuke, command, or bolster attempt, add 4 to your

character level (monster Hit Dice plus class levels) to deter-

mine your Hit Dice for turn, rebuke, command, and bolster

attempts. For example, a 4 HD wight with this feat is treated

as an 8 HD undead for the purpose of turn, rebuke, com-

mand, and bolster attempts, even though it is a 4 HD crea-

ture for any other purpose.

IMPROVED WEB [MONSTROUS]

You gain additional utility from your webs.

Prerequisite: Ability to create webs as an extraordinary

ability at least twice per day.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC to escape or burst your webs.

You may take a full-round action to attack with your webs,

and if you do so, you may attack one additional target per

point of Dexterity bonus you have. No such target may be

more than 10 feet from another target. Using this feat

requires two of the daily uses of your web ability.

INURED TO ENERGY [GENERAL]

You can resist energy attacks more efficiently than normal.

Prerequisite: Resistance to the energy type you specify

when taking the feat.

Benefit: Your existing resistance to one type of energy

increases by 10. You can use this feat only to enhance exist-

ing resistances, not to gain resistance to a new type of

energy. For example, a demon can increase its resistance to

acid, cold, or fire, but it cannot gain sonic resistance with

this feat.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects

stack. Each time you take the feat, you can either apply it to

another type of energy to which you already have resist-

ance, or increase an existing resistance.

INVOLUNTARY RAGE [GENERAL]

Normal: With only Multiweapon Fighting, you get only

Extreme pain drives you berserk.

a single attack with each off-hand weapon.

Special: This feat replaces the Improved Two-Weapon

Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.

IMPROVED SCENT [GENERAL]

You can detect and track creatures by smell at greater dis-

tances than normal.

Prerequisite: Scent ability.

Benefit: You can detect approaching enemies and sniff

Prerequisite: Con 20, Toughness.

Benefit: If you survive 50 points of damage from a single

attack and make your Fortitude save (see Massive Damage

in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook), on your next action

you gain +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and 2 to

Armor Class. These adjustments last until the end of the

combat, at which time you become fatigued. For details on

being fatigued, see the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

IRRESISTIBLE GAZE [MONSTROUS]

Your gaze attack is more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Gaze attack.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against

your gaze attack.

Special: The benefit of this feat stacks with the benefit

provided by the Ability Focus feat (see above).

MIGHTY LEAPING [GENERAL]

You have developed your leg muscles and trained yourself

to make mighty leaps.

Prerequisite: Str 21, Dodge, Mobility, Jump 9 ranks or a

racial bonus on Jump checks.

Benefit: You gain a +10 competence bonus on Jump

checks. If you intentionally jump down from a height, a

successful Jump check (DC 15) lets you take damage as if

you had fallen 20 feet less than you actually did.

Normal: Without this feat, a successful Jump check lets

you take damage as if you had fallen 10 feet less than you

actually did.

Special: A creature with this feat is not limited by its

height when jumping.

MIGHTY ROAR [MONSTROUS]

You unsettle opponents with a dreadful roar as you attack.

Prerequisite: Animal or magical beast; Large size.

Benefit: Once per day, you can use this feat as a standard

action. Your mighty roar affects every opponent within 30

feet of you that can hear your roar and has a character level

lower than yours. An affected opponent must make a suc-

cessful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Cha

modifier) to negate the effect. Failure means that opponent

becomes shaken for 1d6 rounds. A shaken creature takes a

2 morale penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saving throws.

Prerequisite:  Dex  15,  Int  15,  two  or  more  heads,

Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Multiattack, Quicken

Spell, Two-Weapon Fighting.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can cast one addi-

tional spell (or use a spell-like ability in combination with

a spell or another spell-like ability) each round. Each spell

used in this way must have a casting time of 1 action; a

spell-like ability must also take no more than a standard

action to use. Using this feat provokes an attack of oppor-

tunity. If your concentration is interrupted during this

simultaneous casting or spell-like ability use, whether by

taking damage or by some other means, a Concentration

check is required for each spell or spell-like ability. Failing

either Concentration check negates both spells or spell-

like abilities.

You can also use one head to cast a spell or use a spell-like

ability while another head activates a head-based special

attack, such as a breath weapon or an eye ray.

Normal: Without this feat, you can cast only one spell

per round and cannot combine spellcasting with other

actions.

Special: You still cannot exceed the limit of one quick-

ened spell per round (assuming you also have the Quicken

Spell feat) when using this feat.

NARROWED GAZE [MONSTROUS]

Your gaze attack has a limited field of effect.

Prerequisite: Int 13, gaze attack.

Benefit: You may choose to limit your gaze attack to an

active gaze. Doing so prevents you from accidentally affect-

ing friends with your gaze.

Normal: A gaze attack functions constantly on all those

within range, and it can also be used actively as an attack

action.

MULTIGRAB [MONSTROUS]

PAIN MASTERY [GENERAL]

You can grapple enemies more firmly than normal with

your natural attacks.

Prerequisite: Str 17, improved grab.

Benefit: When grappling an opponent with the part of

your body that made the attack, you take only a 10 penalty

on grapple checks to maintain the hold.

Normal: Without this feat, you take a 20 penalty on

grapple checks to maintain a hold with the part of your

body used to make the attack.

Injuries send you into a fury, increasing your physical

power.

Prerequisite: Con 20, Toughness.

Benefit: You take damage normally, but every 50 points

of damage you take (if you survive the attack) automatically

increases your Strength by +2. This bonus lasts until the

end of the encounter, after which you are exhausted. See

the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide for the effects of being exhausted.

MULTITASKING [MONSTROUS]

PEAK HOPPER [GENERAL]

You can perform different tasks with different limbs.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, Int 15, four or more arms, Improved

Multiweapon Fighting, Multiattack, Multiweapon Fighting.

Benefit: If you have four or more arms, you can use each

pair of arms to perform a distinct partial action. All such

partial actions occur simultaneously. Thus, you could attack

with one or two arms while using a magic item, reloading a

crossbow, or casting a spell with two other arms.

MULTIVOICE [MONSTROUS]

If you have two or more heads, you can cast more spells

than usual in a round.

You are adapted to a hilly or mountainous environment.

Prerequisite: Hill or mountain terrain type.

Benefit: Your alpine environment has made you more

surefooted. You gain a +2 competence bonus on Balance

and Climb checks.

PERVASIVE GAZE [MONSTROUS]

Your gaze attack is more effective than normal.

Prerequisite: Int 13, gaze special attack.

Benefit: A creature that averts its eyes has only a 25% chance

to avoid the need for a saving throw against your gaze attack.

Normal: A creature that averts its eyes normally has a

Special: This feat does not affect eye rays, such as those

of a beholder.

PIERCING GAZE [MONSTROUS]

Your gaze attack has a greater range than normal.

Prerequisite: Cha 15, Int 13, gaze special attack, Irre-

sistible Gaze.

Benefit: Because of the sheer force of your presence, you

add 30 feet to the range of your gaze attack.

POISON IMMUNITY [MONSTROUS]

You can ignore the effects of poison.

Prerequisite: Poison special attack as an extraordinary

ability, Poison Resistance.

Benefit: Your poisonous nature grants you immunity to

poison attacks.

POISON RESISTANCE [MONSTROUS]

You can resist poison better than you otherwise could.

Prerequisite: Poison special attack as an extraordinary

ability.

Benefit: Your poisonous nature grants you a greater than

normal ability to withstand poison attacks. You gain a +2

competence bonus on your Fortitude saves to resist the

effects of poison. If a creature of the same kind as you pro-

duces the poison, this bonus is +4 instead, assuming that you

are not already immune to the poison of your own kind.

POWER DIVE [GENERAL]

You can fall upon an opponent from the sky.

Prerequisite: Str 15, fly speed (average maneuverability).

Benefit: When flying, you can dive and land on an oppo-

nent to deal additional damage. Using this feat is a standard

action, and it can affect only creatures one or more size cat-

egories smaller than you. To use this feat, make an overrun

attack, but the opponent cannot choose to avoid you. If you

knock down the target, you may make an additional slam

attack (at the usual +4 attack bonus against prone oppo-

nents). The attack deals the base damage given on the table

below for your size category plus 1 1/2 times your Strength

bonus (rounded down).

Special: If you fail in your overrun attempt and are

tripped in turn, you are knocked down, and you deal the

slam damage for the attack to yourself.

38

PREHENSILE TAIL [MONSTROUS]

You can use your tail to manipulate objects.

Prerequisite: Str 13, tail attack, Two-Weapon Fighting.

Benefit: You can use your tail as an extra hand. It can

grasp melee weapons and use them in combat, although the

normal penalties for using an off-hand weapon apply. If you

have two hands, your tail counts as a third hand for the pur-

pose of the Multiweapon Fighting feat and all feats that use

Multiweapon Fighting as a prerequisite.

You can also use your tail as a hand to assist in grapple

checks and Climb checks. You gain a +2 competence bonus

on all such checks.

QUICK CHANGE [GENERAL]

You can shift to an alternate form faster and more easily

than you otherwise could.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, alternate form special quality.

Benefit: The time it takes for you to change forms is

reduced as follows.

Normal

More than one round

Full-round action

Standard action

Move-equivalent action

Reduces to

Half as many rounds, rounded up

This feat cannot reduce the time it takes to change forms to

less than the time required for a free action.

QUICKEN SPELL-LIKE ABILITY [GENERAL]

You can use a spell-like ability with a moments thought.

Prerequisite: Spell-like ability caster level 8th.

Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject

to the restrictions described below. You can use that abil-

ity as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or

less,  if  the  ability  is  normally  usable  only  once  or  twice

per day).

Using a quickened spell-like ability is a free action that

does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can perform

another  actionincluding  the  use  of  another  spell-like

abilityin the same round that you use a quickened spell-

like ability. You may use only one quickened spell-like abil-

ity per round.

You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell

with a level less than or equal to one-half your caster level

(round down),  4. See the table below. For example, a crea-

ture that uses its spell-like abilities as a 15th-level caster can

only  quicken  spell-like  abilities  duplicating  spells  of  3rd

level or lower. In addition, a spell-like ability that duplicates

a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot

be quickened.

Normal: Normally the use of a spell-like ability requires

a  standard  action  and  provokes  an  attack  of  opportunity

unless noted otherwise.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, you can apply it to another one of your spell-like

abilities.

RAPID BREATH [MONSTROUS]

You do not have to wait as long to reuse your breath weapon

as you normally would.

Prerequisite: Breath weapon, Quicken Spell or Quicken

Spell-Like Ability.

Benefit: The required interval between uses of your

breath weapon is reduced by 1 round. For instance, a

dragon with this feat can use its breath weapon once every

1d41 rounds instead of every 1d4 rounds. If the 1d41

result is 0, the dragon can breathe again in the following

round (but not twice in the same round).

If the interval is a fixed period of time, such as once per

hour, the interval is halved.

Special:  If  you  have  multiple  heads  with  breath

weapons, all your breath weapons use the new interval.

RENDING CONSTRICTION [MONSTROUS]

You can pull grappled enemies apart.

Prerequisite: Str  19,  Dex  15,  constrict  ability,

improved grab, Greater Multigrab, Multigrab, two con-

stricting limbs.

Benefit: If you maintain a hold with more than one

appendage on an opponent and are able to constrict, you

can make an additional rend attack in the same round. This

attack automatically deals double the base damage for a

constrict attack, and the damage bonus is 1 1/2 times your

Strength bonus. However, making this rend attack auto-

matically releases the held creature on its next action. You

must reestablish the hold to constrict again.

REVERBERATION [GENERAL]

Your sonic attack is more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Sonic special attack.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC of all saving throws against

your sonic attack.

Special: If you have more than one form of sonic attack,

you can take this feat multiple times. Each time, it applies

to a different one of your sonic attacks.

ROLL WITH IT [GENERAL]

You are adept at lessening the effects of blows.

Prerequisite: Con 20, Toughness.

Benefit: You gain damage reduction 2/. This applies in

addition to any damage reduction you have from other

sources. Damage reduction cannot reduce damage you take

to less than 0.

Special: You may take this feat multiple times.

SCRAMBLE [GENERAL]

Your slippery ways allow you to evade a damaging blow.

Prerequisite: Dex 15, Small size or smaller, improved

evasion.

Benefit: The effects of this feat resemble those of the

rogues defensive roll, but you can use Scramble to avoid a

potentially fatal attack entirely. Once per day, when you

would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat

(from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability),

you can attempt to scramble out of the way. This requires a

Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + damage dealt). If the save is

successful, you avoid the damage entirely. You must be aware

of the attack and able to react to it; you cannot use Scramble

if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.

Special: Since you cannot normally make a saving throw

to avoid the damage from a blow, improved evasion does

not apply. That is, you cannot save twice against the same

attack.

STAMP [MONSTROUS]

You can stamp the ground to crush and disrupt opponents.

Prerequisite: Huge size, feet, trample special attack.

Benefit: You may, as a full-round action, strike a solid

surface with one of your limbs and create a shock wave that

radiates  out  from  your  position  and  continues  for  a

number of feet equal to 5  your base creatures Hit Dice.

Make a single unarmed attack roll. Every creature in the

affected area compares its Balance check result to your

attack roll result. Those who fail this opposed check are

knocked down.

Special: Each structure and unattended object that is at

least partially within the shock wave takes damage equal

to 1d6 + your Strength bonus + the objects hardness (max-

imum 5).

SUPERNATURAL TRANSFORMATION

[GENERAL]

You convert a spell-like ability to a supernatural ability.

Prerequisite: Innate spell-like ability.

Benefit:  One  of  your  innate  spell-like  abilities

becomes a supernatural ability. It is no longer subject to

spell resistance, though it can still be suppressed in an

antimagic field. Using this ability does not provoke an

attack of opportunity. The number of uses, if limited, does

not change. The effective caster level equals your total

Hit Dice or the effective caster level of the original abil-

ity, whichever is higher.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects

do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a new spell-

like ability.

SURROGATE SPELLCASTING [MONSTROUS]

You use substitute verbal and somatic components when

casting spells.

Prerequisite: Wis 13, nonhumanoid or nonhumanlike

form.

Benefit: You complete the verbal and somatic compo-

nents of spells by substituting vocalizations and gestures

appropriate to your shape. You must still have suitable

appendages and vocal organs. For example, a giant eagle

could substitute screeches and waves of its talons for the

normal verbal and somatic components of a spell. You can

use any material component or focus that you can hold.

This feat does not permit the use of magic items by a crea-

ture whose form could not ordinarily use them, and you do

not gain the ability to speak if you cannot already.

UNCANNY SCENT [GENERAL]

You can pinpoint scents at a greater distance.

Prerequisite: Scent ability, Improved Scent.

Benefit: You can pinpoint the location of a scent when

within 20 feet.

Normal: You can pinpoint the location of a scent when

within 5 feet.

SWAMP STALKER [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a marshy environment.

Prerequisite: Marsh terrain.

Benefit: You move easily through the sucking bogs and

stagnant water of the swamps. You gain a +2 competence

bonus on Swim checks and on Strength checks to break

free of nets, webs, entangle spells, and similar hindrances.

This feat does not grant a bonus on grapple checks.

VICIOUS WOUND [GENERAL]

Damage you deal causes wounds that bleed excessively.

Prerequisite: Expertise, wounding special attack.

Benefit: When using an attack that has a wounding spe-

cial ability, the wounds you cause bleed for an additional +1

point of damage each round. For instance, a hit from a bar-

bazus glaive causes the victim to bleed for 3 points of

damage each round, not 2.

THICK-SKINNED [MONSTROUS]

VIRULENT POISON [MONSTROUS]

Your tough hide grants improved damage reduction.

Your poison attack is more effective.

Prerequisite: Damage reduction.

Benefit: Your existing damage reduction improves by 2,

Prerequisite: Poison attack as an extraordinary ability.

Benefit: Add +2 to the DC for Fortitude saving throws

as indicated on the table below.

You create a cone of deafening sound by clapping two limbs

together.

Prerequisite: Str 30, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power

Attack.

Benefit: You may, as a full-round action, clap two of

your limbs together and create a cone of sound that starts

at your position and continues out for a number of feet

equal to 5  your Hit Dice. A storm giant using this feat

creates a cone 95 feet (5  19 Hit Dice) long. Creatures in

the cone get a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice +

your Con modifier) to resist the effect. Those who fail

their save are deafened for the duration of the encounter.

Those who fail their save by 5 or more are also knocked

down. See the Condition Summary in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for the results of being deafened

and knocked down.

Special: This effect automatically extinguishes unpro-

tected flames (candles, torches, and the like).

TREEFRIEND [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a forest environment.

Prerequisite: Forest terrain.

Benefit: You are completely at home in the forest. You

gain a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks and on Sur-

vival checks to avoid becoming lost in the forest.

WINGSTORM [MONSTROUS]

You can flatten targets with blasts of air from your wings.

Prerequisite: Str 13, fly speed 20 ft., Large size, Hover,

Power Attack.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can hover in place

and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with

a radius and maximum height based on your size.

The wind strength also depends on your size, as shown

on the table below.

Because the blast of air only lasts for your turn, creatures

ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in

which case they are blown back 1d65 feet).

Special: You can use this feat for a full round instead of as

a full-round action. If you do, the wind lasts until your next

turn (and you can choose to continue the effect during your

next turn). Anyone in or entering the cylinder is affected.

Because you are producing a continuous blast of air, the

checked  effect  works  normally  while  the  wind  lasts

(checked creatures cannot move forward against the force of

the wind, or they are blown back 1d65 feet if airborne).

WINTERS CHILD [GENERAL]

You are adapted to a cold environment.

Prerequisite: Cold terrain.

Benefit: As an arctic dweller, you are more hardy. The

DC of your Fortitude save to avoid subdual damage from

cold is reduced to 10 (see Cold Dangers in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). In addition, you can make a saving

throw each minute (DC 10, +1 for each previous check) to

resist the effects of hypothermia in very cold water.

any monsters can use equipment designed for

standard-race  characters,  as  described  in

Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook. In addition,

certain monsters may be ableor may be re-

quiredto use some of the monster equipment pre-

sented in this chapter.

FINDING MONSTER

EQUIPMENT

Creatures from the Monster Manual may make monster

equipment, provided they have the appropriate skills and

feats. A lucrative market exists for such equipment, for

those brave enough, or foolish enough, to seek out cus-

tomers. Such customers are not welcome in towns, so an

enterprising manufacturer must go to them. Once he finds

a customer, he must earn that customers trust, negotiate

with customers likely far more powerful than he is, and

return to civilization.

Such artisans must generally keep their activities secret.

Evil communities may approve of their efforts, but neutral

and good communities are liable to severely punish those

who traffic with monsters. Many such artisans prefer a

mobile lifestyle, packing their smithies, workshops, and

laboratories on wagons and constantly staying one step

ahead of vengeful mobs.

For monsters, this equipment is no harder to get than the

equipment in the Players Handbook. If they want to

purchase one of these items, they can find a merchant

or artisan willing to sell. Organized communities of

monsters without their own artisans can expect reg-

ular visits from traveling merchants. An individual

monster can visit such a place, put out word of its

needs to the local merchants, and return to its lair to

await delivery.

Players with monster characters can start with

this equipment, provided their starting wealth

allows it.

USING MONSTER EQUIPMENT IN

YOUR CAMPAIGN

Monster equipment should not be assigned as

random treasure. Occasionally, those that cannot

use a particular item keep it as part of their tro-

phies or collections, and for them it has value.

For the most part, player characters should

encounter the equipment in use, rather than

lying in some treasure vault, because for them

it has no real value (unless they intend to sell it

to other monsters).

Monsters can buy equipment using the aver-

age value of their treasure (see Table 72: Treasure

Values Per Encounter and Table 73: Average

Treasure  Results  in  the  DUNGEON MASTERs 41

AS

Guide). You can roll randomly for remaining wealth using

Table 74: Treasure in Chapter 7 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide.

CHANGING WEAPON SIZE

Some opponents you encounter may wield weapons of dif-

ferent sizes than standard. As a weapons size changes, so

does its damage, weight, cost, range increment, and reach.

Size and Damage: As a weapon gets larger or smaller,

the damage it deals changes. To calculate the damage a

larger or smaller than normal weapon deals, first determine

how many size categories it changes. A longsword (nor-

mally Medium-size, commonly used by Medium-size

beings) in the hand of a Huge cloud giant is two size cate-

gories larger than normal. For each size category change,

consult either Table 51 or Table 52, finding the weapons

original damage in the left column and reading across to

the right to find its new damage.

A weapon can only decrease in size so far. Weapons that

do less than 1 point of damage have no effect. Once a

weapon only does 1 point of damage, it is not a weapon if it

shrinks further.

Light and Heavy Crossbows: These weapons are exceptions

to the damage figures on Table 51 and Table 52. See Table

53: Damage for Larger and Smaller Crosbows.

Size, Weight, and Cost: When a weapon increases in

size, its weight increases by 50% for each category. So if a

throwing  axe  (normally  Small,  weighing  4  pounds)

increases to Large, its weight increases to 9 pounds. Price

increases by the same amount, so a Large throwing axe

would cost 18 gp (instead of 8 gp for the Small version).

Weight decreases by 25% per size category as a weapon

decreases in size, so a throwing axe reduced to Tiny size has

a weight of 3 pounds (instead of 4 pounds for the Small ver-

sion). Cost also decreases at the 25% rate.

Size and Range: As ranged weapons change size, their

range increment also changes. For each increase in size, the

range goes up by 25%. Huge longbows, such as those

wielded by ogre mages, have a range increment of 125 feet

(instead of 100 feet for the Large version of the longbow).

For each decrease in size, the range increment goes down

by 25%; a Medium-size longbow has a range increment of

75 feet.

Size  and  Reach: For  each  size  increase  of  a  reach

weapon, increase its reach by 5 feet. A Huge guisarme has a

reach of 15 feet (instead of 10 feet for the Large version), for

instance, while a Gargantuan guisarme has a reach of 20

feet. Decreasing the size of a reach weapon quickly makes

reach irrelevant. Having a reach of only 5 feet is normal for

Medium-size and Small creatures. The important difference

is that Tiny creatures using Small reach weapons can fight

in melee as if they had 5 feet of reach, meaning they do not

have to enter an opponents area to attack.

THREE OR MORE HANDS

Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook points out that when you

deal damage with a weapon that you are wielding two-

handed, you add 1 1/2 times your Strength bonus. The

wielder of a light weapon does not get this higher Strength

bonus when using the weapon two-handed (see Weapon

Categories in Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook).

Provided that a weapon is designed for more than two

hands, each additional hand used increases the damage

dealt with that weapon. Each hand used beyond the

first  adds  1/2  the  wielder s  Strength  bonus  to  the

damage. A creature wielding a Medium-size longsword

with two hands adds 1 1/2 times its Strength bonus to

the damage roll. A girallon wielding a Huge club with

all four hands adds 2 1/2 times its Strength bonus to the

damage roll.

Any weapon in the Players Handbook can be lengthened,

balanced, and otherwise designed and crafted for creatures

with more than two hands. The determining factor is the

relationship between the size of the wielder and the size of

the user. Light weapons can never be designed for use with

more than two hands. One-handed weapons can already be

used with two hands, and can be designed for use with four

hands. Two-handed weapons can be designed for use with

up to eight hands. The cost is for a masterwork version of

the weapon, and the wielder gains the benefits of using a

masterwork weapon as well.

Weapons may change size, as outlined above. Apply the

cost change for size before applying the additional cost for

the masterwork version when designing larger or smaller

weapons for creatures with more than two hands.

creatures to hold and use items. Ghost touch items appear

misty and translucent. Ghost touch armor and shields can

be picked up, moved, and worn by incorporeal creatures.

Incorporeal creatures gain the armor or shields enhance-

ment bonus against both corporeal and incorporeal attacks,

and they can still pass freely through solid objects. Ghost

touch weapons deal damage normally against incorporeal

creatures, regardless of their bonuses (an incorporeal crea-

tures 50% chance to avoid damage does not apply to ghost

touch weapons). Further, they can be picked up and moved

by incorporeal creatures at any time. Essentially, ghost

touch weapons, armor, and shields count as either corporeal

or incorporeal at any given time, whichever is more benefi-

cial to the wielder.

WEAPONS

Chain, Barbed: This weapon is a length of four to six

short, barbed iron bars connected by links of chain. Kytons

often wield these weapons in place of their chain rakes and

apply their dancing chains ability to them.

Chain Lash: This is a simple chain with weighted ends.

It can be whirled quickly, striking with hard blows because

of the weights. One end can also be swung out to entangle

an opponent. Kytons often wield these weapons in place of

their chain rakes and apply their dancing chains ability to

them.

The chain lash can be used either as a double weapon or

as a reach weapon. You can fight with it as if fighting with

two weapons, incurring all the normal attack penalties as if

using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. In this

case, you can only strike at an adjacent opponent.

If you use the chain lash as a reach weapon, you can strike

opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike other

weapons with reach, you can use it against an adjacent foe.

In this case, you can only use one end of the chain effec-

tively; you cannot use it as a double weapon.

Because the chain lash can wrap around an enemys leg or

other limb, you can make trip attacks with it. If you are

tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the

chain lash to avoid being tripped.

When using a chain lash, you get a +2 bonus on your

opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an oppo-

nent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if you fail

to disarm your opponent).

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dex-

terity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack

rolls with a chain lash.

Chatkcha: A chatkcha is a heavy crystalline throwing

wedge favored by thri-kreen (see Monster Manual II).

Chuul Lasher: Some chuul manufacture these lashes

to extend the reach of their own paralyzing tentacles.

Using a lasher, a chuul can substitute a whip attack for one

of its claw attacks. A successful strike with the whip attack

does  normal  whip  damage  (1d2  points  of  subdual

damage), and forces a Fortitude save against the chuuls

paralysis ability.

Gythka: A gythka is a double-weapon favored by thri-

kreen (see Monster Manual II). It is a pole arm with a blade at

each end. You can fight with it as if fighting with two

weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack

penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, as if

you  were  wielding  a  one-handed  weapon  and  a  light

weapon (see Attacking with Two Weapons in Chapter 8 of

the Players Handbook). A creature using a double weapon in

one hand, such as an ogre using an orc double axe, cannot

use it as a double weapon. Thri-kreen (and other creatures

with four or more arms) who learn the Multiweapon Fight-

ing feat can wield two gythkas at once as double weapons

because of their four arms.

Howler Javelin: Made from the quill of a howler, this

weapon performs as a normal javelin with an additional

function. An opponent hit by a howler javelin must make a

Reflex save (DC 16) or have the javelin break off after lodging

in his or her flesh. A lodged javelin imposes a 1 circum-

stance penalty on attacks, saves, and checks. Removing the

javelin deals 1d6 additional points of damage. Howler

javelins that hit a target cannot be recovered. Howler javelins

that miss their target have a 50% chance of breaking on

impact, rendering them useless. Since a howler javelin is not

crafted for melee, all characters are treated as not proficient

with it and thus take a 4 penalty on their melee attack rolls.

Notbora: This Huge exotic double weapon is made by

desmodu (see Monster Manual II) and looks like a big quar-

terstaff with a crook at one end. A notbora has a hinge in

the middle so that it can be folded for storage. The wielder

can unfold the weapon and lock the hinge by pressing a

hidden catch (a free action when drawing the notbora). The

notboras straight end is actually a sheath that can be

removed as a move-equivalent action to reveal a blade. The

hooked end can be used to make trip attacks. A wielder who

is tripped during his or her own trip attempt can drop the

notbora to avoid being tripped.

Each end of the notbora deals 2d6 points of damage. The

hooked end is a blunt weapon that deals double damage on

a critical hit and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of

20. With the sheath in place, the straight end functions the

same way. With the sheath removed, the straight end is a

slashing weapon that deals double damage on a critical hit

and threatens a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.

Pincer Staff: The pincer staff is a kuo-toa pole arm

designed to capture opponents with a minimum of harm. A

wielder who hits a Small or Medium-size opponent with a

pincer staff can immediately initiate a grapple (as a free

action) without provoking an attack of opportunity (see

Grapple in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook). In addition

to the normal options available to a grappler, the wielder of

a pincer staff can attempt to force his target to the ground

(the equivalent of a trip attack, though no attack roll is nec-

essary). The pincer staff is a reach weapon and cannot be

used against adjacent opponents.

Salamander Spears: These all-metal versions of other

spears are somewhat heavier and do more damage for their

size than ordinary versions. They also conduct both heat

and electricity, unlike the wood-hafted normal versions.

Scissors  Sword: Designed  for  use  by  six-armed

mariliths, this sword uses a complex, hinged arrangement

of three blades and three hilts. A scissors sword requires

six arms to use effectively. On a successful critical hit, a

proficient wielder may choose to grapple the opponent

with two of the blades (+2 to wielders grapple check). If

the grapple check is successful, the opponent is consid-

ered grappled and the wielder may automatically deal 1d8

points of damage against that grappled opponent in each

round from the third blade. The wielder cannot attack

other targets while using the grappling function.

Sharktooth Staff: This weapon is a pole arm designed

to tear at the flesh of targets. A wielder who hits a Small

or Medium-size opponent with a sharktooth staff does

normal damage and can immediately initiate a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity

(see Grapple in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook). The

wielder of a sharktooth staff may choose to deal normal

damage for the weapon on subsequent rounds without

making further attack rolls against the grappled victim.

Snake Chain: This chain is woven through a medusas

snakes, allowing her to make melee attacks with a reach

weapon in addition to using her gaze attack or shortbow.

A snake chain is a reach weapon. A medusa can strike oppo-

nents 10 feet away with the chain. In addition, unlike most

other weapons with reach, she can use it against an adjacent

foe.

Because the chain can wrap around an enemys leg or

other limb, the medusa can make trip attacks with it. If

the medusa is tripped during her trip attempt, she cannot

drop the chain to avoid being tripped.

When using a snake chain, a medusa gets a +2 bonus on

her opposed attack roll when attempting to disarm an

opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if

she fails to disarm her opponent).

A snake chain does not transmit the poison of the

medusas snakes. She may choose to attack with the

snakes instead of with the snake chain; if so, normal rules

and reach for the snakes apply.

Tail Blade: This weapon consists of a blade and the sheath

and harness necessary to attach it to a creatures tail. The ver-

sion presented here is for Medium-size creatures, such as

lizardfolk. When using a tail blade, the creature may make a

melee attack with it at its full attack bonus and no other

attacks, or it can make a tail blade attack in addition to its

other melee attacks. See Multiweapon Fighting and Multi-

dexterity in the Monster Manual for resulting penalties to

attack rolls.

Tail Club: This weapon consists of a club and the

sheath and harness necessary to attach it to a creatures

tail. The version presented is for Medium-size creatures,

such as lizardfolk. When using a tail club, the creature

may make a melee attack with it at its full attack bonus

and no other attacks, or it can make a tail club attack in

addition to its other melee attacks. See Multiweapon

Fighting and Multidexterity in the Monster Manual for

resulting penalties to attack rolls.

SPECIAL AND

SUPERIOR ITEMS

Aboleth Mucus: An aboleth underwater surrounds

itself with a viscous cloud of mucus roughly 1 foot thick.

Occasionally this substance finds its way into marketplaces.

Glass vials of the mucus can be thrown as grenadelike

weapons. Any creature coming into contact with or inhal-

ing this substance must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 19)

or lose the ability to breathe air for the next 3 hours (see the

Suffocation sidebar in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide). There is no splash effect for aboleth mucus.

Breathing Mask: This desmodu-made (see Appendix 3:

New Creatures) mask covers the users whole face. It is

fitted with goggles and a bag of an alchemical substance

within that allows the wearer to breathe for up to 4 hours.

With the mask on, the wearer can ignore the effects of nox-

ious fumes and inhaled toxins. It even enables the wearer to

function underwater or in an airless environment. A

slightly different version (with the same cost and weight)

allows water-breathers to function out of water.

The item consists of a masterwork leather mask with gog-

gles (cost 50 gp) and the alchemical air supply, which costs

950 gp and can be manufactured with a successful Craft

(alchemy) check (DC 20). A partially used air supply cannot

be combined with another partially used one to get a fresh

supply, but it can be discarded and replaced with a new

supply.

Cable: Desmodu (see Appendix 3: New Creatures) make

a metal cord that is thinner, stronger, and lighter than even

silk rope. It is too thin for most creatures to climb easily

(Climb DC 20), but desmodus using a cable can climb at

their normal climb speed. The cable has a snap ring at each

end so that it can be quickly attached to or detached from a

piton, spike, grappling hook, or other item without a Use

Rope check.

The cable has 10 hit points and hardness 5. It can be

broken with a successful Strength check (DC 32). Its stiff-

ness, however, imposes a 2 circumstance penalty on use

Rope checks.

Cablespool: This desmodu (see Appendix 3: New Crea-

tures) gadget carries 100 feet of cable (see above) in an

enclosed reel. The reel is spring-wound and can pull in all

100 feet of cable in 1 round (pulling with a Strength score

of 16). It can be set to reel or unreel the cable automatically

as the user climbs, or to act as a brake, allowing the user to

jump down 100 feet without harm.

Delver Slime: Delvers produce a mucuslike slime that

contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particu-

larly effective against stone. Glass vials of this substance

occasionally appear in marketplaces, sold by enterprising

dwarves who bribed delvers with gems. Vials of the slime

can be thrown as grenadelike weapons. A successful hit

deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or

objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, the delvers

slime deals 4d8 points of acid damage, and against stony

creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals

8d10 points of acid damage. All creatures within 5 feet of

where the vial lands take 1d6 points of acid damage from

the splash, but objects within 5 feet are not affected.

Drow Arrow Poison: Drow arrow poison is an injury

poison (Fortitude DC 17) that causes unconsciousness.

After 1 minute, the injured creature must make a second

Fortitude save (same DC) or remain unconscious for 2d4

hours.

Flash Tube: Ingenious alchemists figured out how to

duplicate the effect of a gibbering mouthers spittle. Vials of

this substance can be thrown as grenadelike weapons. The

fluid within ignites on contact with the air, creating a blind-

ing flash of light. All sighted creatures within 60 feet of

where the vial lands must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC

13) or be blinded for 1d3 rounds. See the Condition Sum-

mary in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for details

on the effects of blindness.

A flash tube requires a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 20) to

create.

Frostfire: This sticky, adhesive substance drains away

heat when exposed to air or moisture. A flask of frostfire

can be thrown as a grenadelike weapon with a range incre-

ment of 10 feet, and a direct hit deals 1d6 points of cold

damage. The target can then attempt to scrape off or wash

away the frostfire, if desired. If this does not occur, the

target takes an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on the

round following the direct hit. Removing frostfire by scrap-

ing requires a successful Reflex saving throw (DC 15).

Alternatively, the substance can be removed automatically

by dousing it with at least a quart of an alcoholic or acidic

solution (such as wine or vinegar). Either method requires a

full-round action.

Frostfire requires a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 20) to

create.

Harness: Desmodus (see Appendix 3: New Creatures)

cannot wear belts because of the flaps of skin attached to

their flanks. Instead, they wear harnesses that loop over

their shoulders and between their legs. Straps crisscross the

front and back of the desmodus body to keep the harness

from slipping off.

Each desmodu harness is fitted with rings, hooks, and

ties for carrying weapons and equipment. A reinforced

hook hangs near the waist for carrying a cablespool.

Sculptors Slime: Another product of dwarf dealings

with delvers, this slimy liquid softens stone. One flask

allows a Craft (stonemasonry) check (DC 10) to shape up to

25 cubic feet of stone, as stone shape cast by a 15th-level

druid.

Sculptors slime requires a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 20)

to create.

Spore Flask: No one knows who first persuaded a vrock

to allow the bottling of its spores, or how it was persuaded.

No doubt, the horrible tanarri delight in the idea of inflict-

ing pain without even being present. A flask of vrock spores

can be thrown as a grenadelike weapon. The spores auto-

matically deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 5

feet of where the flask lands. They then penetrate the skin

and grow, dealing an additional 1d2 points of damage each

round for 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is

covered with a tangle of vinelike growths. A delay poison

spell stops the spores growth for its duration. Bless, neutral-

ize poison, or remove disease kills the spores, as does sprin-

kling the victim with a vial of holy water.

Sun Lantern: This is a bullseye lantern, but without any

reservoir for oil. Instead, a sunrod may be inserted into a

socket on one end. Once the sunrod is in place, a simple

twist locks it there and activates it. A sun lantern provides

light as a bullseye lantern, with the duration of a sunrod.

Rules for bullseye lanterns and sunrods appear in Chapter 7

of the Players Handbook. Any sunrod functions in a sun

lantern.

MAGIC ARMOR

Kyton Armor: This +1 mithral shirt looks like an unravel-

ing sweater because of the strips of chain hanging from the

hem. Once per round the wearer may command one of the

strips to activate for up to 5 rounds. When first made, this

armor has five chain strips capable of animation, but

combat may destroy some of them. The strips function like

Small animated objects. The strips fight independently of

the wearer and attack as +1 weapons. They do not attack any

friend or ally of the wearer unless he commands them to do

so. If no chains are left, the armor remains a +1 mithral shirt.

Animated Chain Strips (1 to 5): CR 1; Small construct;

HD 1d10; hp 5; Init +1; Spd 0 ft.; AC 14, touch 12, flat-footed

13; Atk +2 melee (1d6+1, +1 chain rake); SQ construct traits;

AL N; SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will 5; Str 10, Dex 12, Con ,

Int , Wis 1, Cha 1.

Construct  Traits:  Immune  to  mind-affecting  effects

(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale

effects), and to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects;

cannot heal damage; not subject to critical hits, subdual

damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain; not at

risk of death from massive damage, but destroyed when

reduced to 0 hit points or less; cannot be raised or resur-

rected; darkvision 60 ft.

When wearing this armor, a kyton cannot use its dancing

chains ability with the animated chain strips. It can, how-

ever, use that ability with up to four other chain strips that

can be hung from the hem. Weight: 25 lb.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, animate object; Market Price: 13,980 gp.

Serpent Armor: This +3 leather armor appears to be made

from the skin of one or more big snakes. Though some

claim serpent armor is made of naga hide, no one has

proven it. In addition to its value as armor, serpent armor

provides its wearer a +2 insight bonus on Reflex saving

throws, and the wearer acts as if she had the Combat

Reflexes feat.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, cats grace; Market Price: 21,660 gp. Weight: 15 lb.

Wight Armor: This +1 shadow studded leather armor gives

the wearer darkvision to a range of 60 feet and the protec-

tion of invisibility to undead as if cast by a 5th-level cleric.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, invisibility to undead; Market Price: 26,175 gp. Weight:

20 lb.

MAGIC WEAPONS

Assassin Whip: This +1 whip appears to be a living vine

of some sort, with leaves shaped like human hands and

small clusters of fruit that resemble wild grapes. Gnarled

and covered with brown, stringy bark, the assassin whip can

be used as a normal whip, but twice a day the wielder can

use  it  to  make  a  ranged  touch  attack  against  a  single

Medium-size or smaller target, causing grasses, weeds,

bushes, and even trees to wrap, twist, and entwine about

her, holding her fast. If no vegetation is in the area, the

assassin whip causes vines to spring up from the ground. The

entangling plants constrict their target, each round dealing

1d6+7 points of damage with a successful grapple check

(the plants grapple check modifier is +8).

An entangled creature takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls,

takes a 4 penalty to Dexterity, and cannot move. An entan-

gled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a

Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell. She can

break free by using a full-round action to make a Strength

check or an Escape Artist check (DC 20). The entangle

effect is independent of the whip, and the wielder can

attack other targets after entangling someone.

Note: The DM may alter the effects of the whip some-

what, based on the nature of the entangling plants.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor plus entangle or web; Market Price: 11,021 gp.

Bag of Boulders: When found, this pouch holds 1d4

stones the size of sling bullets. (A newly created bag has four

stones.) When thrown (range increment 10 feet), a stone

from the bag of boulders instantly grows to 12 inches in diam-

eter and deals 3d6 points of damage on a successful attack. If

the attack misses, treat it as a grenadelike weapon. Once all

four stones are thrown, the magic of the bag is gone.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, shrink

item; Market Price: 1,200 gp (new) or 300 gp per stone (partial

bag); Weight: 1/2 lb. per stone.

Beast Claws: Usually found in a size that fits a Medium-

size humanoid, this pair of +1 spiked gauntlets sports claws at

the tips of the fingers. They allow the wearer to make claw

attacks (1d4/2 slashing damage for Medium-size charac-

ters; see Changing Weapon Size earlier in this chapter to

adjust for wearers size).

If worn by a creature that already has a claw attack, beast

claws have an enhancement bonus of +2 instead of +1. The

creature does its normal claw damage while wearing beast

claws plus an additional 1d6 points of damage. Creatures of

animal intelligence will usually not willingly wear cover-

ings on their forelimbs.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, polymorph self or ability to wild shape; Market Price:

9,610 gp.

Blade of Wind: This +2 dancing short sword allows its

wielder to fly, as the spell cast by a 6th-level wizard, for up

to an hour per day, while holding the blade of wind. The

time in flight need not be continuous. When wielded by a

creature of the air subtype, the blade of wind changes its size

in proportion to its wielder, remaining a light weapon. For

example, a storm giant would wield it as a Large short

sword. In addition, creatures of the air subtype gain a +4

enhancement bonus to Dexterity while wielding a blade of

wind, and against creatures of the earth subtype the blade of

winds threat range and critical multiplier improve to

1720/3.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, animate objects, fly; Market Price: 97,510 gp.

Brimstone Hammer: When wielded by a fiendish or

half-fiendish creature, this +2 unholy warhammer allows its

wielder to smite good one additional time per day, provided

the wielder uses the brimstone hammer for that attack.

Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, unholy blight, divine power, creator must be evil;

Market Price: 45,812 gp.

Dwarf Crusher: Made by giants to destroy the works of

their dwarf foes, this +2 greatclub has additional powers

when wielded by creatures with high Strength scores and

the Power Attack feat. Creatures with Strength of at least 25

who use Power Attack at the highest possible level (devot-

ing their entire base attack bonus to damage) ignore the

hardness  of  nonliving  materials  when  wielding  this

hammer. Targeting an opponents weapon, shield, or armor

invites  an  attack  of  opportunity  normally.  Animated

objects, constructs, and elementals (but not undead) do not

get the benefit of natural armor against this weapon.

Elf Breaker: This +1 morningstar has a special affinity for

goblinoids.  In  the  hands  of  a  goblinoid,  elf  breakers

enhancement bonus increases to +2. In the hands of a gob-

linoid in combat with an elf or with a group that includes at

least one elf, it grants the wielder a +4 enhancement bonus

to Constitution for the duration of the encounter.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, endurance; Market Price: 26,305 gp.

Elf Edge: This +1 longsword has a special affinity for those

of elven blood. In the hands of someone who has elven

blood, it grants the wielder a +4 enhancement bonus to

Dexterity.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, cats grace; Market Price: 18,315 gp.

Foe Reaver: Made by frost giants, this +1 greataxe has a

pale blue sheen and proves a great surprise to those seeking

to exploit frost giants weakness. In the hands of a frost

giant, this weapon grants its wielder fire resistance 20.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, protection from elements, creator must be a frost giant;

Market Price: 18,320 gp.

Fishgutter: Weapons similar to this appear among many

amphibious cultures, and from there have spread to fully

aquatic ones. Fishgutter is a +2 scimitar that allows its wielder

to act as if under the influence of a freedom of movement spell

cast by a 7th-level cleric.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, freedom of movement; Market Price: 64,315 gp.

Flame Reaver: This +1 flaming glaive, when wielded by

creatures of the fire subtype, feeds off their natural energy

and produces additional powers. On a critical hit, a flame

reaver does normal critical damage, and in addition the

opponent must make a Reflex save (DC 15) or catch on fire

(see Catching on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide). Creatures of the fire subtype ignore this ignition

effect if struck by a flame reaver.

Treat objects struck by a flame reaver as having half their

usual hardness, because the extreme heat of the weapon

causes the target to soften. Hardness does not lessen further

if an object is struck multiple times.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor

plus flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; Market Price: 26,308 gp.

Flint Basher: This +2 greatclub allows its wielder to use

stone shape as the spell cast by a 5th-level cleric, once per day,

while holding a flint basher. In addition, creatures of the

earth subtype gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitu-

tion while wielding a flint basher, and against creatures of

the air subtype the flint bashers threat range and critical

multiplier improve to 1920/3.

Gauntlet of Gruumsh: This single +1 gauntlet allows the

wielder to make a melee touch attack and blind the target of

the attack instead of doing damage. The target gets a Forti-

tude saving throw (DC 14) to negate the blinding effect.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, blindness/deafness; Market Price: 24,805 gp.

Ice Scythe: This weapon is a +1 frost scythe. When wielded

by creatures of the cold subtype, it feeds off their natural

energy and produces additional powers. On a critical hit, an

ice scythe does normal critical damage, and the opponent

must make a Will save (DC 14) or be affected as if by a slow

spell cast by a 5th-level wizard. Creatures of the cold sub-

type ignore this slow effect if struck by an ice scythe.

Treat objects struck by an ice scythe as having half their

usual hardness, because the extreme cold of the weapon

causes the target to become unusually brittle. Hardness

does not lessen further if an object is struck multiple times.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, slow, and chill metal or ice storm; Market Price:

26,318 gp.

Orc Razor: This +1 falchion has a special affinity for those

of orc blood. In the hands of someone who has orc blood, it

grants the wielder a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity

and a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, cats grace, endurance; Market Price: 17,375 gp.

Pixie Arrows: Pixies sometimes employ arrows that deal

no damage but can erase memory or put a creature to sleep.

Memory Loss: An opponent struck by the arrow must suc-

ceed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose all memory. The

subject retains skills, languages, and class abilities but

forgets everything else until he or she receives a heal spell

or memory restoration by means of limited wish, wish, or

miracle.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, modify memory; Market Price: 607 gp.

Sleep: Any opponent struck by the arrow, regardless of Hit

Dice, must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15) or be

affected as though by a sleep spell.

Caster Level: 1st; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, sleep; Market Price: 107 gp.

Rogue Blade: This +2 rapier provides the effect of the

blink spell as cast by a 6th-level wizard when wielded.

Because blink denies opponents their Dexterity bonuses to

Armor Class, a rogue wielding a rogue blade always gets to

add her sneak attack damage (provided her opponent is sus-

ceptible to such).

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, blink; Market Price: 44,320 gp.

Rusting Club: This +1 greatclub allows the wielder to

make a touch attack against an opponents armor or weapon

and deliver a rusting grasp spell as if cast by a 7th-level druid

instead of normal damage. This effect can be used up to

three times per day.

Any iron or iron alloy item a rusting club touches becomes

instantaneously rusted, pitted, and worthless, effectively

destroyed. If the item is so large that it cannot fit within a 3-

foot radius (such as a large iron door or the effect of a wall of

iron spell), a 3-foot-radius volume of the metal is rusted and

destroyed. Magic items made of metal are immune to this

effect.

When using a rusting club in melee, the wielder can

choose to make a melee touch attack. If successful, the

attack instantaneously negates 1d6 points of Armor Class

gained from metal armor (up to the maximum amount of

protection the armor offered) through corrosion. For exam-

ple, full plate armor (+8 AC) could be reduced to +7 or as

low as +2 in protection, depending on the die roll. A metal

weapon that is hit is destroyed. Note: Striking at an oppo-

nents weapon provokes an attack of opportunity. In addi-

tion, you must touch the weapon and not the other way

around.

Against ferrous creatures, a rusting club deals 3d6 points of

damage +1 per caster level of the creator (maximum +15) on

a successful attack.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, rusting grasp; Market Price: 35,905 gp.

Scaled Javelin: This +2 javelin gains the special abilities

of distance and returning when used by creatures of the

reptilian subtype.

Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, clairaudience/clairvoyance, telekinesis; Market Price:

26,301 gp.

Serrated Terror: Made by fire giants, this jagged +1 great-

sword proves a great surprise to those seeking to exploit fire

giants weakness. In the hands of a fire giant, this weapon

grants its wielder cold resistance 20.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, protection from elements, creator must be a fire giant;

Market Price: 18,350 gp.

Skyspear: When wielded by a celestial or half-celestial

creature, this +2 holy longspear allows its wielder to smite

evil one additional time per day, provided the wielder uses

the skyspear for that attack.

Caster Level: 12th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, holy smite, divine power, creator must be good; Market

Price: 45,805 gp.

Staff of the Whip: This +1 pincer staff (see the description

earlier in this chapter) has an additional function when

wielded by a kuo-toa. As an attack action, the wielder may

deliver 1d8+6 points of electrical damage (as a shocking grasp

spell from a 6th-level caster) to a creature already grappled

by the staff of the whip.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, shocking grasp; Market Price: 10,408 gp.

Lightning Bolt: As the spell cast by a 9th-level wizard, save

DC 15. This power uses 2 charges.

Ball Lightning: You create four 2-foot-diameter balls of

concentrated electricity that shed light as candles and move

under your control. A ball of lightning deals 2d6 points of

electricity damage to anything it touches, including crea-

tures that attack it or move through it. When you create the

balls of lightning, you mentally program them to move as

you desire, even around corners. Once programmed, a balls

orders cannot be changed. A ball can move up to 100 feet

per round and flies with perfect maneuverability. When a

ball of lightning strikes a creature, the ball stops and

remains in place for the remainder of the spells duration. A

ball dissipates if the distance between you and it exceeds

190 feet. A ball can only see under the available light con-

ditions (including the light the ball itself sheds).

For example, you could program one lightning ball to

follow the left wall of a corridor and strike the first creature

it sees, another to follow the right wall and do the same,

and the remainder to follow 5 feet behind you in a semicir-

cle. The first two lightning balls would turn corners to

remain following the walls, even if this took them out of

your line of sight, and strike the first creature they see,

which would fulfill their program and leave them in their

targets square.

A creature struck by a lightning ball or that touches one

with a natural or melee weapon gets a Reflex saving throw

for half damage (DC 17). Damage from two balls resting in

the same square stacks. A creature struck by multiple balls

of lightning in a round (or entering a square with two light-

ning balls) gets a saving throw for each. A creature with

spell resistance makes separate spell resistance checks

against each lightning ball, with success meaning that par-

ticular ball cannot harm the creature. This power uses 4

charges.

Storm gauntlets have 50 charges when new. After the last

charge  is  expended,  storm  gauntlets remain  +1  spiked

gauntlets.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor plus shocking grasp or lightning bolt; Market Price:

52,360 gp.

Sword of the Schemer: This +2 greatsword grants its

wielder a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, and +2

enhancement bonuses to Wisdom and Charisma. The

bonuses only apply when the owner wields the blade.

Sheathing the sword or hanging it by a strap of some sort

does not provide the bonuses.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor; Market Price: 32,350 gp.

Wave Piercer: This +2 trident grants freedom of movement

to its wielder if that individual has the aquatic subtype.

When wielded by aquatic creatures against creatures of the

fire subtype, a wave piercers threat range and critical multi-

plier increase to 1920/3.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, freedom of movement; Market Price: 56,315 gp.

Whip of Webs: The wielder of this whip can use it as a +2

whip (see Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook for details on

and special rules concerning whips), or may make a ranged

touch attack with it to wrap a target in a web of leather

straps. An entangled character takes a 2 penalty on attack

rolls and a 4 penalty to effective Dexterity. An entangled

character can move at half speed but cannot run or charge.

An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must

make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell. The

wielder and the whip are not attached to the entangled

character in any way and may attack other targets freely.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, entangle or web; Market Price: 10,301 gp.

RINGS

Ring of Growth: This ring allows the wearer to speak a

command word and instantly grow in size, doubling its

height and multiplying its weight by 8. This growth increases

the creatures size category by one, which grants it a +4 size

bonus to Strength, a 2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum

of 1), and a 1 penalty on attack rolls and AC. The growth

may also increase the wearers natural reach and face (see

Table 87 in the Players Handbook). The ring can be employed

once per day, and the effect lasts for 9 minutes (or less, if the

wearer desires). The ring does not change the wearers speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth,

the wearer attains the maximum possible size and may

make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to

burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is con-

strained without harm by the materials enclosing itthe

ring cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.

All equipment worn or carried by the wearer is affected

by the ring. A melee weapon enlarged by one size category

deals more damage (as shown on Table 51). Magical prop-

erties of items are not affected by the growth. Any enlarged

item that leaves the enlarged creatures possession (includ-

ing a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its

normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their

normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size

of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, animal growth;

Market Price: 18,000 gp.

Ring of Shrinking: This ring allows the wearer to speak

a command word and instantly diminish in size, halving its

height, length, and width and dividing its weight by 8. This

reduction in size decreases the creatures size category by

one, which grants it a +2 size bonus to Dexterity, a 4

penalty to Strength (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on

attack rolls and AC. The change in size may also affect the

wearers natural reach and face (see Table 87 in the Players

Handbook). The ring can be employed once per day, and the

effect lasts for 9 minutes (or less, if the wearer desires). The

ring does not change the wearers speed.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is affected by

the ring. A melee weapon reduced by one size category

deals less damage (as shown on Table 51). Magical proper-

ties of items are not affected by the reduction. Any reduced

item that leaves the reduced creatures possession (includ-

ing a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its

normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their

normal damage (projectiles deal damage based on the size

of the weapon that fired them).

Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, reduce; Market

Price: 3,600 gp.

Ring of Wordtwisting: This ring grants a +2 insight

bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks. If

worn by someone of orc blood, the ring grants a +4 insight

bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive

checks, and the wielder acts as if the subject of a tongues

spell cast by a 5th-level wizard.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Forge Ring, tongues; Market

Price: 23,508 gp.

STAFFS

Staff of the Glutton: This +2/+2 quarterstaff appears to be

made from melted flesh. At the top, a humanoid head bares

its fangs and appears to melt down into the staff. On a criti-

cal hit, the fanged head at the end of the staff bites the

victim for 1d8 points of damage in addition to the normal

critical damage. In addition, the staff of the glutton has the

following powers:

Acid fog, as an 11th-level wizard, on command (2 charges).

Summon swarm, as an 11th-level wizard, on command.

The swarm lasts for 8 rounds and does not require concen-

tration. The staff always summons vermin, so add +14 to the

d20 roll to see which type of swarm appears (2 charges).

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Staff, acid fog, summon

swarm; Market Price: 58,200 gp.

Staff of the Lich: This +2/+1 unholy quarterstaff appears

to be badly charred, but is in fact completely sound. It has

the following powers, all as a 7th-level wizard, all on com-

mand:

Negative Energy Wave: The staff releases a silent burst of

negative energy. It affects 7d6 HD worth of undead crea-

tures. Those closest to it are affected first; among equidis-

tant undead creatures, those with fewer Hit Dice are

affected first. Undead creatures gain turn resistance of 1d4

+ the wielders Charisma modifier (minimum +1). The

effect lasts 10 rounds (2 charges).

Negative Energy Burst: The staff releases a silent burst of

negative energy from a point its wielder indicates. The

point must be within 20 feet of the staff and its wielder. The

energy deals 1d8+7 points of damage to living creatures in a

20-foot-radius burst. A successful Will save (DC 15) reduces

damage by half. Since undead are powered by negative

energy, this spell cures them of a like amount of damage,

rather than harming them (2 charges).

Negative Energy Ray: A ray of negative energy projects

from the tip of the staff. The wielder must succeed on a

ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target.

The ray deals 4d6 points of negative energy damage to a

living creature. Since undead are powered by negative

WONDROUS ITEMS

Arms of the Naga: These beautiful, silver arms hang

from a harness made from top-grade leather. The arms are

proportioned as if for a Medium-size humanoid. They have

two fingers and an opposable thumb on each hand. The

magic that gives life to the arms when worn duplicates the

Strength and Dexterity of the character wearing them. In a

stressful or demanding situation, such as combat, the

wearer must make a Will save (DC 19) or take a 2 penalty

on all attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks

until the situation passes. Magic armor shifts to accommo-

date the new arms.

Arms  of  the  naga do  not  allow  additional  attacks  or  the

performance  of  several  si-

multaneous  physical  tasks.

They  do  not  increase  the

wearers  reach.  How-

ever,  they  do  allow  the

wearer  to  use  items  de-

signed for creatures with

humanoid  hands  and

arms.

If the wearer already

has  arms,  arms  of  the

naga allow the use of a

two-handed  weapon

plus another piece of

equipment.  For  in-

stance,  a  wearer

could  wield  a  great-

sword  while  still

using a shield.

SR

Arms of the naga

have  hardness  10

and  30  hit  points

each.  A  character

cannot remove arms of

the  naga from  an  oppo-

nent by succeeding on a dis-

arm  attempt.  The  arms  are

donned  or  removed  like  medi-

um armor and are subject to at-

tacks that target armor, such as

a bebeliths armor damage attack, but require no proficiency

to use.

Cloak of

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poly-

Babbling  Wheel:  An  elaborately  carved  wooden  drum

set  at  one  end  of  a  intricately  engraved  rod  made  of  the

same  material,  the  babbling  wheel  activates  when  the

wielder  spins  the  drum  around  the  handle. The  irregular

noise emitted is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion similar

to an allips babble. All sane creatures within 30 feet of the

babbling wheel must succeed on a Will save (DC 11) or be

affected as though by a hypnotism spell for 2d4 rounds. Op-

ponents  who  successfully  save  cannot  be  affected  by  the

same babbling wheel for one day.

Caster Level: 1st; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, hypno-

tism; Market Price: 2,000 gp.

Circlet  of  Rest:  Three  interwoven  rings  make  up  this

beautiful silver headband. When worn, it provides a +10 re-

sistance  bonus  against  nightmare and dream  casting (see

Chapter 6) and also makes the wearer immune to dream.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, dream,

nightmare, or dream  casting (see  Chapter  6:  Spells); Market

Price: 12,500 gp. Weight: .

Cloak of Charms: This cloak allows the wearer to cast

animal friendship, charm person or animal, or command plants

as a 15th-level druid. This cloak does not allow you to ex-

ceed the maximum number of animals befriended to you.

Each ability can be used once per day.

Caster Level: 15th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, ani-

mal friendship, charm person or ani-

mal,  command  plants;  Market

Price: 54,000

gp. Weight:

1 lb.

Cloak  of

Quills: This

brown

cloak

has  a  layer  of

quills  on  the

outside.

The

quills are 1 to 2

feet  long  and

have  bands  of

tan,  black,  and

brown.  When

grappling,  the

wearer may thrash

about,

striking

with  1d4  quills

every  time  he  or

she makes a success-

ful  grapple  check.

An  opponent  hit  by

a  quill  attack  must

make  a  Reflex  save

(DC  16)  or  have  the

quill break off in his or

her  flesh.  A  lodged  quill

imposes a 1 circumstance penalty

on  attacks,  saves,  and  checks.  Re-

moving the quill deals 1d6 additional points of damage. A

cloak  has  5d6  quills  when  found;  when  it  is  donned,  it

grows  2d4  new  quills  every  24  hours  until  reaching  the

maximum of 30 quills. Because the quills rustle and rattle

against  each  other,  anyone  wearing  the  cloak  takes  a  10

penalty on Move Silently checks.

Cloaker Flute: This woodwind instrument is crafted to

resemble the throat of a living creature. Rumor has it that a

cloaker taught an evil bard how to make the first one. When

played by a creature who has the Perform (flute) skill, a

cloaker flute produces one of four effects (the user chooses

the effect each time). Cloakers are immune to these sonic,

mind-affecting attacks. Unless noted otherwise, creatures

that successfully save against these effects cannot be

affected by the same cloaker flute for one day. All saving

throw DCs are equal to 10 + the users ranks in Perform.

Fear: All those within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a

Will save or flee in terror for 2 rounds.

Nausea: Everyone in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a

Fortitude save or be overcome by nausea and weakness.

Affected characters fall to the ground and are unable to take

any actions, including defending themselves, for 1d4+1

rounds.

Stupor: A single creature within 30 feet of the cloaker

flute must succeed on a Fortitude save or be affected as

though by a hold person spell for 5 rounds. Even after a suc-

cessful save, the creature remains vulnerable if the cloaker

flute produces this effect again.

Unnerve: All within an 80-foot spread automatically take a

2 morale penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced

to hear the sound for more than 6 consecutive rounds must

succeed on a Will save or enter a trance, unable to attack or

defend themselves until the sound stops. Even after a suc-

cessful save, they must repeat the save in each round there-

after that the sound continues.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, cause

fear, hold person, stinking cloud; Market Price: 27,225 gp.

Weight: 3 lb.

Dragon Mask: This mask allows the wearer to see invisi-

bility, as the spell cast by a 6th-level wizard. The mask func-

tions automatically when donned, for as much as 1 hour per

day. The time need not be continuous. When the mask is

active, the wearer is not subject to a rogues sneak attack

unless the rogue is at least 10th level.

Caster Level: 6th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, see

invisibility; Market Price: 44,000 gp. Weight: 2 lb.

Fairy Gold: This is a bag containing dried leaves that, for

8 hours after it is found, appear to be d% gold coins. Fey

creatures automatically see through the illusion, but all

others must make Will saves when they interact with the

bag of coins (DC 19).

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, per-

sistent image, creator must be fey; Market Price: 4,950 gp.

Weight: 2 lb.

Fingerbone Necklace: This crude necklace appears to be

made from the fingerbones of humanoids strung on a leather

thong. A goblin wearing this necklace gains a +2 competence

bonus on Handle Animal and Ride (worg) checks. If the

goblin does not have the Mounted Combat feat, it may fight

as if it does while wearing the fingerbone necklace.

Gazeblind Goggles: These goggles have dark lenses

that appear opaque until worn. Leather cups house the

lenses and surround the wearers eyes. Leather straps

secure the cups and lenses to the wearers head. When

worn, the lenses appear clear to the wearer, and the cups do

not block peripheral vision. The goggles block the wearers

gaze attacks.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item;

Market Price: 6,000 gp. Weight: .

Geas Acorn: Fey leave silver acorns like this one lying

in the open for foolish and unwary people to pick up. In

this way, the fey gain cheap labor. Once per day, when

picked up, a geas acorn can place a lesser geas on the creature

touching it unless that creature succeeds on a Will save

(DC 16). The effect remains until the creature discharges

one task set by the placer of the acorn, or until seven days

pass. If the character remains in contact with the acorn

after the effect ends, it is subject to the effect again unless

it succeeds on another save. The acorn has no effect unless

placed by a fey.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, lesser

geas, creator must be fey; Market Price: 8,400 gp. Weight: .

Gloves of Man: These magic gloves provide humanoid

fingers and thumbs for the wearer. Any creature may wear

them, provided the creature has tentacles or paws over

which to slip them. While wearing the gloves, the creature

may manipulate items as if it had fully functional hands.

The wearer can use her full Strength and Dexterity with her

new hands. Creatures with hands gain no benefit from the

gloves, but creatures missing a thumb, a finger, or even an

entire hand can use the gloves as a way to replace the loss.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poly-

morph other; Market Price: 42,000 gp. Weight: .

Grig Fiddle: Grigs are sprites known for lively fiddle

music. When playing their fiddles, grigs force any non-

sprite within 30 feet of the instrument to succeed on a Will

save (DC 15) or be affected as though by Ottos irresistible

dance as long as the playing continues. This is a sonic effect.

Anyone capable of playing the instrument (which is of

Diminutive size) can produce the effect.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Ottos

irresistible dance, creator must be a grig; Market Price: 14,400

gp. Weight: .

Hag Eye: Coveys of hags create these magic gems. A hag

eye appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone,

but a gem of seeing or other such effect reveals it as a disem-

bodied eye. Often, a hag eye is worn as a ring, brooch, or other

adornment. Any of the three hags who created the hag eye

can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the

same plane as the hag. Destroying a hag eye deals 1d10 points

of damage to each member of the covey and blinds the one

who sustained the greatest damage for 24 hours.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, clair-

voyance, creators must be a covey of hags; Market Price:

22,500 gp. Weight: .

instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In

addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all

saving throws. A night hag that loses this charm can no

longer use etherealness until it can manufacture another

(which takes one month). Other creatures, including those

of good alignments, can also benefit from the heartstones

powers, but the periapt shatters after ten uses and does not

bestow etherealness.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

creator  must  be  a  night  hag;  Market  Price: 1,800  gp.

Weight: .

Horseshoes of Flame: An ordinary horse wearing these

horseshoes may transform up to three times per day, for up

to 7 hours each time, into a creature resembling a night-

mare. The transformation happens when the owner of the

horseshoes speaks the command word. Another command

word transforms the horse back to its normal form. Speak-

ing the command is a free action, but the transformation

takes a standard action. When transformed, the horse gains

a fly speed of 90 feet (good), +1d4 points of fire damage on

each successful hoof attack, +2 Dexterity, +10 Intelligence,

and +6 Charisma. A blow from the transformed horses

hooves sets combustible materials alight.

Caster Level: 7th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, poly-

morph other; Market Price: 30,240 gp. Weight: 2 lb. each.

creates a whirlpool similar to the vortex created by a Large

water elemental. The vortex lasts for 4 rounds. It is 5 feet

wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 to 40

feet tall depending on the depth of the pool. Pouring the

contents of the flask into a pool of fluid less than 10 feet

deep produces no effect.

Medium-size and smaller creatures might take damage

when caught in the vortex and may be swept up by it. An

affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 19)

when it comes into contact with the vortex or take 2d6

points of damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex

save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the pow-

erful currents, automatically taking damage each round. A

creature that can swim is allowed a Reflex save (DC 19) each

round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage,

but can leave if the save is successful.

If the vortexs base touches the bottom of the body of

water, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is cen-

tered wherever the wielder threw or poured the liquid and

has a diameter equal to half the vortexs height. The cloud

obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.

Creatures 5 feet away have one-half concealment, while

those farther away have total concealment (see Conceal-

ment in Chapter 8 of the Players Handbook). Those caught in

the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 19)

to cast a spell.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

summon monster VI; Market Price: 3,300 gp. Weight: .

Mask of Fangs: Wearing this mask allows the owner to

dominate and direct animals with simple commands such

as Attack, Run, and Fetch. Suicidal or self-destructive

commands (including an order to attack a creature two or

more size categories larger than the dominated animals) are

simply ignored. The wearer may simultaneously dominate

and direct up to 12 HD of animals.

The mask establishes a mental link between the wearer

and the subject creatures. The creatures can be directed by

silent mental command as long as they remain within 150

feet of the wearer. The wearer need not see the creatures to

control them. The wearer does not receive direct sensory

input from the creatures, but knows what they experi-

ence, and which one has which experience. Because the

wearer directs the creatures with his own intelligence, the

creatures may be able to undertake actions normally

beyond  their  comprehension,  such  as  manipulating

objects with their paws and mouths. The wearer need not

concentrate exclusively on controlling the creatures

unless trying to direct them to do something they nor-

mally could not do.

Domination lasts for 6 rounds, after which the creatures

return to their normal, uncontrolled behavior. They have

no bond toward the wearer of the mask, but their attitude is

friendly.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, domi-

nate animal; Market Price: 30,000 gp. Weight: 2 lb.

Master Fiddle: Sized for a Tiny creature, this excep-

tional fiddle produces beautiful music when played. In the

hands of a grig, however, it replaces the normal effects of a

grig fiddle with the bardic music abilities inspire courage,

countersong, fascinate, suggestion, or inspire greatness as if it

were being played by a 9th-level bard. See the bard class fea-

tures in Chapter 3 of the Players Handbook for descriptions

of bardic music.

Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

creator must be a bard or a grig; Market Price: 18,000 gp.

Weight: .

Necklace of Natural Weapons: The enhancement

bonuses on this necklace are applied to attack and damage

rolls involving one or more of the wearers natural weapons.

In addition, any weapon special quality may be applied to

this necklace, and the quality then applies to those natural

weapons as well. For instance, a +1 throwing returning neck-

lace of natural weapons would apply its enhancement bonus

and the throwing and returning special abilities to one or

more of the wearers natural weapons.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Craft

Magic Arms and Armor; Market Price: 600 gp, plus the cost

of the enhancement bonuses, multiplied by the number of

natural weapons affected. A +1 necklace of natural weapons

that affects one natural weapon costs 2,600 gp; if the same

necklace affects six natural weapons, it costs 15,600 gp.

Weight: .

Render Bait: This amulet causes a gray render within 50

feet to regard the wearer as a trusted friend and ally, as if its

attitude were helpful, unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC

19). This is a mind-affecting charm effect. Some renders

develop a bond with the wearer, as described in their Mon-

ster Manual entry. The wearer may bond with a number of

renders that fail their save equal to his Charisma bonus (if

any). They remain fairly close to the wearer, leaving only to

hunt for food and find water. Once per day each affected

gray render brings the wearer an offering of enough meat

to feed a Medium-size humanoid for one day.

Caster Level: 11th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item,

charm monster; Market Price: 35,640 gp. Weight: .

Satyr Pipes: Any creature with the appropriate Perform

(pan pipes) skill can play these beautiful pan pipes. In the

hands of a satyr, however, the pipes can produce the per-

formers choice of three magical effects. When the pipes are

played, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs)

must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) or be affected by charm

person, sleep, or fear, as the spells cast by a 10th-level sorcerer

(the satyr chooses the tune and its effect). A creature that

successfully saves against any of the pipes effects cannot be

affected by the same set of pipes again for one day. A satyr

often uses its pipes to charm and seduce especially comely

women or to put a party of adventurers to sleep and then

steal their valuables.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, cre-

ator must be a satyr; Market Price: 3,000 gp. Weight: 3 lb.

Scentblinder: This small pouch comes suspended on a

leather thong and is worn around the neck. While worn, a

scentblinder masks the wearers scent. This effect increases

the DC to track the wearer by scent by +30. It also masks the

effect of extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural powers

of the wearer based on scent, such as a troglodytes stench.

he rules for magic presented in Chapter 10 of the

Players Handbook apply to monsters as well as stan-

dard-race  characters.  Monsters  that  can  make

somatic gestures and speak languages can cast all the

spells that a humanoid spellcaster can, provided they

have class levels that allow it. Monsters that cannot speak

can cast any spell that has no verbal component (see the

tables below) or any spell they can prepare with the meta-

magic feat Silent Spell.

MONSTERS AND

SCHOOL SPECIALIZATION

Monsters without the ability to speak cannot cast spells

with verbal components. Because many spells from the

schools of Enchantment, Illusion, and Transmutation

dont have verbal components, those schools are good

choices for specialization by nonspeaking spellcasters,

whereas the school of Conjuration, for example, is a poor

choice because it has many spells with verbal compo-

nents. Tables 61 and 62 summarize the arcane and

divine spells from the Player s Handbook that have no

verbal components.

The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game assumes that

all spells published in official sources are avail-

able to all characters when they learn new

spells. However, a DM may wish to keep the

59

AS

spells in this book more under the control of monsters and

monster characters, not because the spells are too powerful

for standard-race characters but to reinforce their flavor. As

a variant rule, the DM may require a standard-race character

to obtain these spells only through contact with a monster

willing to trade these spells or by doing research on them as

if researching original spells. See the Learning New Spells

variant and Researching Original Spells under Advancing

Levels in Chapter 2 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for guide-

lines and examples.

AIR BREATHING

Transmutation

Level: Clr 3, Drd 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creatures touched

Duration: 2 hours/level (see text)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures can breathe

air freely. Divide the duration evenly

among all the creatures you touch.

The  spell  does  not  make  creatures

unable to breathe water.

Air  breathing dispels  and  counters

water breathing.

Arcane Material Component: A short

reed or piece of straw.

AWAKEN CONSTRUCT

Transmutation

Level: Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9

Components: V, S, M, XP

Casting Time: 8 hours

Range: Touch

Target: One construct

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  awakens  a  humanoid-

shaped  construct  to  humanlike  sen-

tience.  The  spell  does  not  work  on

constructs  that  are  only  constructs

temporarily  (such  as  objects  affected

by an animate objects spell). The awak-

ened creature is independent of both

you  and  the  being  who  originally

made it, though it is initially friendly

toward both you and its maker.

Material  Component: The  brain  of  a

humanoid  that  has  been  dead  less

than 8 hours.

XP Cost: 5,000 XP.

AWAKEN UNDEAD

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Clr 6, Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V, S, M, XP

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. plus 5 ft./2

levels)

Targets: All mindless undead within

a circle 25 ft. in radius plus 5 ft./

2 levels

Duration: Permanent (D)

Saving Throw: None (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  grants  Intelligence  to

mindless  undead  such  as  skeletons

and  zombies.  Undead  with  Intelli-

gence  scores  are  unaffected.  Each

mindless undead creature within the

radius gains an Intelligence score of

1d6+4. A subject of the spell cannot

gain  a  higher  Intelligence  than  is

typical for its original kind. A skele-

tal  dog  simply  has  Intelligence  2,

while  a  skeletal  orc  uses  the  1d6+4

die roll but cant have a score higher

than 8.

Awakened  undead  do  not  regain

any skills, feats, or extraordinary abil-

ities they had in life, but they do gain

skill points ([4 + Int mod]  HD)and

feats  (one  for  first  Hit  Die,  one  for

each  three  HD  thereafter)  normally

after being awakened.

Undead  regain  the  armor  and

weapon proficiencies they had in life

(assume  the  undead  were  formerly

NPC warriors unless your DM speci-

fies  otherwise)  and  will  don  armor

and take up weapons while obeying

your  commands.  A  zombie  fighter

can  wear  any  armor  and  wield  any

simple  or  martial  weapon,  while  a

zombie  warhorse  can  wear  any

armor.

Awakened  undead  gain  a  +2  pro-

fane  bonus  on  their  Will  saving

throws to resist being controlled.

Material  Component: A  humanoid

fingerbone.

XP Cost: 200 XP.

BLINDSIGHT

Transmutation

Level: Clr 3, Drd 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell  grants  the  subject  the

blindsight ability out to a range of 30

feet.  (For  details,  see  Blindsight  in

Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide.)

BLOOD WIND

Evocation

Level: Clr 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 caster

levels)

Target: A single creature with

Intelligence of 4 or higher

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The subject may take a full attack ac-

tion to use one of its natural weapons

as if it were a thrown weapon with a

20-foot range increment. The subject

may do so every round while the spell

is in effect. The subject gestures with

the  natural  weapon  as  if  making  a

melee attack. The effect of this attack

always emanates from the subjects lo-

cation.  The  attack  does  not  get  a

flanking  bonus  or  help  a  combatant

get  one. The  subject  uses  its  highest

melee attack bonus, and deals damage

normally  if  it  hits.  All  normal  modi-

fiers  to  ranged  combat  apply.  If  the

subject  has  more  than  one  natural

weapon, it may choose which weapon

to use during each round the spell is

in effect.

BRIDGE OF SOUND

Conjuration (Creation) [Sonic]

Level: Brd 2, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One bridge of sound 5 ft.

wide, 1 in. thick, and up to 10 ft./

level long

Duration: Concentration plus 1

round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  ribbonlike,  weightless,

unbreakable, invisible bridge of sound.

The bridge must be anchored to solid

objects  at  both  ends,  but  otherwise

can be at any angle. Like a wall of force,

it must be continuous and unbroken

when  formed.  It  is  typically  used  to

cross  a  chasm  or  a  hazardous  space.

Creatures  can  move  on  the  bridge  of

sound without penalty, sinced it is no

more slippery than a typical dungeon

floor.  It  is  only  a  physical  barrier  to

solid  objects  and  has  no  effect  on

spells, line of sight, gaze attacks, ethe-

real  creatures,  or  incorporeal  crea-

tures and objects.

The  bridge  of  sound can  support  a

maximum  of  200  pounds  per  caster

level.  Creatures  that  cause  the  total

weight on the bridge of sound to exceed

this limit sink through the bridge as

if it werent there.

A bridge  of  sound is  temporarily

negated  within  the  area  of  a  silence

spell, causing anything on it to fall. If

the  silence effect  ends  or  is  dispelled

before  the  bridges  duration  expires,

the bridge is once again whole.

BUOYANT LIFTING

Evocation

Level: Drd 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Target: One willing swimming or

floating creature or object (total

weight up to 200 lb./level)

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D) (see

text)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  command  the  water  supporting

or surrounding a swimming or float-

ing creature or object to rise and hold

the creature above the surface of the

water.  An  object  so  lifted  may  con-

tain creatures or other objects (for ex-

ample, a boat). The creature must be

willing  to  be  lifted  in  this  manner,

and an object must be unattended or

possessed  by  a  willing  creature. The

spell  causes  a  smooth  wave  of  water

to rise under the subject and hold it

20  feet  above  the  rest  of  the  waters

surface.  If  obstructions  prevent  the

subject  from  being  raised  that  high

(such  as  being  in  a  cave  with  a  low

ceiling),  the  wave  lifts  the  subject

until it touches the obstruction. The

subject is otherwise resting at the top

of this wave (rescuing it from drown-

ing  if  it  was  a  sinking  air-breather)

and  can  swim  away  under  its  own

power or be moved by others (such as

with  a  rope).  If  the  subject  is  re-

moved  from  the  wave,  it  collapses

gently and the spell ends.

CACOPHONIC BURST

Evocation [Sonic]

Level: Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Area: 20-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reflex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  cause  a  burst  of  low,  discordant

noise to erupt at the chosen location.

It  deals  1d6  points  of  sonic  damage

per  caster  level  (maximum  15d6)  to

all creatures within the area.

Cacophonic  burst  cannot  penetrate

the area of a silence spell.

CAMOUFLAGE

Transmutation

Level: Drd 1, Rgr 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 minutes/level

You  change  your  coloring  to  match

the  environment  surrounding  you.

The  spell  grants  you  a  +10  circum-

stance bonus on your Hide checks.

CLOUD WINGS

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action)

Range: Tough

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes(harmless)

This  spell  increases  the  subjects  fly

speed  by  30  feet.  It  has  no  effect  on

other  modes  of  movement,  nor  does

it allow the subject to fly if it cannot

already do so.

COUNTERMOON

Abjuration

Level: Drd 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One lycanthrope

Duration: 12 hours

Saving Throw: Will negates (D)

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  stops  a  lycanthrope  from

changing  form,  preventing  both  vol-

untary  shapechanging  via  the  alter-

nate  form  ability  and  involuntary

shapechanging  because  of  lycan-

thropy. The  subject  retains  whatever

form  he  or  she  had  when  the  spell

was cast for the duration; even death

does  not  cause  reversion  to  normal

form until the spell ends. Natural ly-

canthropes  gain  a  +4  bonus  on  the

saving throw against this spell.

Material Component: A hair, scale, or

other cast-off item from the creature

to be affected.

CRAWLING DARKNESS

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Clr 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

You bring into being a shroud of dark,

writhing tentacles around your body.

The  tentacles  do  not  interfere  with

your  movement  or  spellcasting,  but

they  provide  you  one-half  conceal-

ment  (20%  miss  chance)  and  totally

hide your features. You get a +4 com-

petence  bonus  on  grapple  checks,

Climb  checks,  and  Escape  Artist

checks.

Crawling  darkness automatically

protects you with a feather fall effect if

you ever fall more than 3 feet and al-

lows you to use water walk at will.

DAWN

Abjuration

Level: Drd 0, Rgr 1

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: All creatures within a 15-ft.-

radius burst centered on you

DESICCATING BUBBLE

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 2

Components: S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Effect: 3-ft.-radius sphere of air

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Reflex negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

A  globe  of  supernaturally  dry  air

rolls  in  whichever  direction  you

point and engulfs those it strikes. It

moves 30 feet per round and can leap

up  to  30  feet  to  strike  a  target.  If  it

enters  a  space  with  a  creature,  it

stops  moving  for  the  round  and

deals 2d4 points of damage as it evap-

orates moisture from the target. (The

subject can negate this damage with

a  successful  Reflex  save.)  Oozes,

creatures composed of water (such as

water  elementals),  and  creatures

with  the  aquatic  subtype  take  2d6

points of damage.

The  bubble  moves  as  long  as  you

actively  direct  it  (a  move-equivalent

action  for  you);  otherwise,  it  merely

stays at rest. The surface of the bubble

has  a  spongy,  yielding  consistency

(similar to that of a soap bubble, but

not  fragile  and  allowing  objects  to

pass through it without affecting the

spell)  and  so  does  not  cause  damage

except by absorbing moisture. It can-

not  batter  down  large  obstacles. The

bubble  winks  out  if  it  exceeds  the

spells range.

Arcane  Material  Component: A  tiny

bag  or  bladder  filled  with  air,  and  a

sprinkle of dust.

DISSONANT CHANT

Abjuration [Sonic]

Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 100-foot radius emanation

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  distracting  and  discor-

dant chant. Affected creatures that at-

tempt  spellcasting  or  other  activities

that  require  concentration  must

make Concentration checks (DC 18 +

Int  or  Cha  modifier,  for  wizards  or

sorcerers respectively) to succeed.

Activities that already require Con-

centration checks, such as casting de-

fensively, have their DC increased by

the save DC of this spell 10. For ex-

ample, this spell cast by a wizard with

14  Intelligence  would  have  a  DC  of

14;  a  cleric  trying  to  cast  spiritual

weapon within the area would have to

succeed  on  a  Concentration  check

against  DC  21  (15  +  2  for  spiritual

weapon spell  level  +  14    for  dissonant

chant save DC  10 = 21).

Creatures  within  the  area  gain  a

bonus  on  saving  throws  against  lan-

guage-dependent effects equal to this

spells DC 10.

While  this  spell  does  not  allow  a

saving throw, the save DC for the spell

is calculated normally (10 + spell level

+  Int  or  Cha  modifier)  to  determine

the  modifier  to  the  Concentration

checks of those within the spells area.

DREAM CASTING

Illusion (Phantasm) [Mind-Affect-

ing] (see text)

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Unlimited

Target: You and one dreamer

Duration: 1 day/level (see text)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less) and Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

and yes

As  the  dream spell,  except  as  noted

above;  also,  you  can  alter  the  sleeping

persons  dreams  to  produce  a  specific

desired effect. The dreamer gets a Will

saving throw to resist the additional ef-

fects  of  this  spell;  if  he  succeeds,  the

dream casting spell can only send a mes-

sage in the manner of the dream spell. If

the saving throw fails, you decide what

additional effect the message carries.

Fear: Your  image  in  the  dream  is

surrounded  by  intimidating  imagery

and  an  aura  of  power.  For  the  dura-

tion of the spell, any time the dream-

er can see you or knows you are pres-

ent,  he  is  shaken.  This  is  a  compul-

sion and fear effect.

Charm: Your  image  in  the  dream

appears particularly helpful and kind.

For  the  duration  of  the  spell,  the

dreamer is under the effect of a charm

monster spell. This is a charm effect.

Rage: Your  image  in  the  dream

taunts and harasses the dreamer. For

the duration of the spell, any time the

dreamer can see you or knows you are

present, he preferentially attacks you

if in a combat situation. The dreamer

gains  a  +2  morale  bonus  on  saving

throws,  attack  rolls,  ability  checks,

skill  checks,  and  weapon  damage

rolls while under this effect. This is a

compulsion effect.

Harrow: Your  image  in  the  dream

behaves  in  a  bizarre  and  irrational

manner. For the duration of the spell,

the  dreamer  behaves  in  an  unusual

manner,  gaining  two  random  traits

from Table  55:  One  Hundred Traits

in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide (reroll

any physical traits, such as baldness).

If the dreamer can see you or knows

you are present, he acts bewildered.

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread, +10 ft./

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

the  earth  at  that  point  erupts  in  a

shower  of  rock,  dirt,  and  fire.  Crea-

tures and objects within the area take

7d6 points of damage; the damage is

4d6  impact  and  3d6  fire.  Those  that

fail  the  saving  throw  are  knocked

prone.

This spell allows you to adopt the na-

ture and some abilities of a wild ani-

mal.  You  retain  your  own  form,  but

you  gain  the  natural  and  extraordi-

nary  senses  of  the  creature  you

choose,  as  well  as  its  skill  ranks

(though  these  do  not  stack  with  any

ranks  you  already  have  in  the  same

skills),  for  the  duration  of  the  spell.

Thus,  depending  on  your  choice  of

animal,  you  could  gain  blindsight,

scent,  and  ranks  in  Listen,  Spot,  or

other skills. Embrace the wild does not

grant you the animals natural attacks,

methods of locomotion, feats, or non-

sensory  extraordinary  abilities,  such

as trample or improved grab.

Focus: Hide, skin, or feathers of the

selected animal, or an item or compo-

nent  of  its  lair.  You  must  have  ob-

tained  the  focus  from  the  animal

yourself.

this spell lengthens your tentacles, in-

creasing the reach of your tentacle at-

tacks by 5 feet. The tentacles attack as

normal.  This  spell  can  also  increase

the  length  of  a  medusas  snakes  so

they may make normal attacks with a

10-foot  reach,  or  they  may  start  a

grapple  after  a  successful  attack  as  if

you had the improved grab ability. If

the snakes get a successful hold, they

can constrict on any following round

for  1d3  points  of  damage  plus  your

Strength  modifier  with  a  successful

grapple check.

FOXS CUNNING

Transmutation

Level: Brd 2, Clr 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The  transmuted  creature  becomes

smarter. The spell grants an enhance-

ment bonus to Intelligence of 1d4+1

points,  adding  the  usual  benefits  to

Intelligence-related  skills.  Wizards

who receive foxs cunning do not gain

extra spells, but the save DCs for their

spells increase.

Arcane  Material  Component: A  few

hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.

FUSE ARMS

Transmutation

Level: Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature with at least four

arms or tentacles touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  cause  a  creatures  multiple  arms

or  tentacles  to  fuse  together  into  a

single  pair  of  stronger  limbs.  Only

limbs  that  the  creature  can  use  as

arms or grasping limbs are affected by

the spell (so basilisks and monstrous

centipedes, neither of which use their

limbs to attack or manipulate objects,

are unaffected).

For  every  set  of  limbs  fused  into

the primary set of limbs, the creature

gains  +4  to  Strength  when  using

those fused limbs (affecting activities

that  would  use  those  limbs,  but  not

activities relying on its bite, legs, and

so on). For example, a girallon under

the effect of this spell would have one

pair  of  arms  and  Strength  30  for  the

purpose of using those arms. A behir,

which has three pairs of limbs that it

can use as arms, wound end up with

one pair of arm-limbs with a +8 bonus

to Strength for those arms (its six legs

would be unaffected).

The loss of limbs reduces the num-

ber of attacks available to the subject.

You  give  the  subject  one  additional

pair of arms for every four caster lev-

els.  Each  arm  ends  in  a  hand  with

fingers and an opposable thumb. The

spell  can  create  a  maximum  of  five

pairs of arms, but the size of the sub-

ject limits the number of pairs of ad-

ditional  arms  it  can  have:  one  for

Small,  two  for  Medium-size,  three

for Large, or four for a Huge or larg-

er  creature.  The  creatures  original

arms  (if  any)  are  its  primary  arms,

and all others are secondary limbs (if

the  subject  had  no  arms,  the  arms

created  by  the  spell  are  its  primary

arms).

The  new  limbs  can  be  confusing.

In a stressful or demanding situation,

such  as  combat,  the  subject  must

make a Will save (DC 19) or take a 2

penalty on all attack rolls, saves, skill

checks,  and  ability  checks  until  the

situation  passes.  Nonmagical  cloth-

ing  or  armor  is  destroyed  by  the

transformation, but magic armor and

clothing  shifts  to  accommodate  the

new arms.

The  additional  arms  do  not  allow

additional attacks or several simulta-

neous physical tasks. They do not in-

crease  the  subjects  reach.  However,

they do allow the subject to use items

designed  for  creatures  with  more

than two arms, or to use a two-hand-

ed  item  and  another  piece  of  equip-

ment.  For  instance,  a  subject  could

wield  a  greatsword  while  using  a

shield.

Material  Component: A  few  strands

of girallon hair.

crystal globes.

HOLY STAR

Abjuration

Level: Clr 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Effect: Protective star of energy

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

You create a glowing mote of energy

that stays near your shoulder, provid-

ing light equal to a candle. It has three

functions,  and  you  can  designate

which function to activate as a free ac-

tion on your turn.

Spell Turning: The holy star can turn

1d4+3  spell  levels  as  the  spell  turning

spell. Any spell levels turned are gone

for the remainder of the spell (the holy

star does not recover these spent levels

every time you choose this function).

If  all  spell  levels  are  expended,  this

function  no  longer  works,  but  the

other functions still do.

Cover: The holy star gives you a +10

cover  bonus  to  Armor  Class  without

affecting your actions.

Fire  Bolt: The  holy  star lashes  out

with  a  beam  of  energy  as  a  ranged

touch  attack  against  a  creature  up  to

90  feet  away,  dealing  fire  damage

equal  to  1d4  +1  point  per  two  caster

levels (maximum +10).

ILLUSORY PIT

Illusion (Figment)

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

You  create  frigid  globes  that  strike

your enemies. You must succeed on a

ranged  touch  attack  roll  to  hit.  The

hailstone  deals  5d6  points  of  cold

damage (Reflex save half ). If you cre-

ate extra frigid globes (at 10th level or

This spell creates the illusion of a pit

10  feet  square  and  20  feet  deep.  It

may be cast on a flat surface (such as

a floor) or in an open space (such as

on  an  actual  pit  to  conceal  its  con-

tents).  It  appears  absolutely  real

when  viewed.  If  it  is  cast  on  a  solid

floor, objects dropped into the pit do

not  fall,  instead  resting  in  place  on

top of the pit as if levitating or as if

the  pit  were  covered  with  a  wall  of

force. If it is cast in an open space, ob-

jects  dropped  into  the  pit  appear  to

fall into it until they pass below the

bottom  of  the  spells  area  (at  which

point they vanish) or come to rest on

a  solid  object  within  the  spells  area

(at  which  point  they  appear  to  float

within  the  pit).  Detection  abilities

that  do  not  require  sight  work  nor-

mally on the pit, instantly revealing

it to be illusory (for example, a crea-

ture  with  blindsight  or  a  character

feeling the ground with a pole would

realize  that  there  is  no  pit)  or  cov-

ered in some invisible way. Touching

the illusion does not cause it to dis-

appear. The bottom of the illusory pit

may be bare, or it may contain metal

spikes, a humanoid skeleton, filth, or

any combination you desire, chosen

at the casting of the spell.

IMPROVED BLINDSIGHT

This  spell  turns  a  humanoid-shaped

construct  into  a  living  creature.  The

spell  does  not  work  on  constructs

that  are  only  constructs  temporarily

(such  as  objects  affected  by  an  ani-

mate objects spell). The construct gains

the incarnate construct template (see

Chapter 10). The incarnated creature

is  independent  of  both  you  and  the

being who originally made it, though

it is initially friendly toward both you

and its maker.

Material  Component: The  heart  of  a

humanoid  that  has  been  dead  less

than 8 hours.

XP Cost: 5,000 XP.

INKY CLOUD

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Clr 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: 30 ft.

Area: Cloud that spreads underwater

in a 30-ft. radius, centered on you

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The  inky  cloud created  by  this  spell

billows  out  from  your  location. The

cloud  obscures  all  sight,  including

darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature

within  5  feet  has  one-half  con-

cealment  (attacks  have  a  20%  miss

chance). Creatures farther away have

total concealment (50% miss chance,

and the attacker cant use sight to lo-

cate the target).

A moderate current (11+ mph) dis-

perses the cloud in 4 rounds; a strong

current  (21+  mph)  disperses  the

cloud in 1 round.

The  spell  functions  only  under-

water.

Material  Component: A  small  vial

containing  the  ink  of  a  squid  or

octopus.

MAW OF CHAOS

Abjuration [Chaotic, Force]

Level: Sor/Wiz 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Area: 15-ft.-radius emanation

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will half (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes (see text)

You  create  a  yawning  area  of  roiling

purple-red energy resembling a great

mouth.  This  field  of  energy  has  the

following effects upon anything that

touches or enters it.

First, all creatures except you take 1

point of damage per caster level. Spell

resistance applies to the damage (but

not  the  other  effects  of  the  spell).

Those  affected  by  the  spell  make  a

Will saving throw every round. A suc-

cessful saving throw halves the dam-

age in that round.

Second, the chaotic energy makes it

difficult  to  concentrate.  Any  activity

that  involves  concentration  (such  as

casting  a  spell  or  using  a  spell-like

ability)  requires  a  Concentration

check (DC 25 + spell level) to succeed.

Creatures with the chaotic subtype

are unaffected by this spell.

Material  Component: A  jawbone

with teeth.

possible for the subject to use certain

skills or feats).

You imbue an inanimate object with

mobility and a semblance of life. The

animated  object  is  friendly  toward

you. You have no special empathy or

connection with the object, although

it  serves  you  in  specific  tasks  or  en-

deavors if you communicate your de-

sires  to  it.  The  object  can  be  of  any

nonmagical  material,

including

wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ce-

ramic,  and  glass.  You  can  also  ani-

mate  masses  of  raw  matter,  such  as

water, a rock from a wall, or a rock on

the ground, as long as the volume of

material does not exceed 1 cubic foot

per  caster  level.  For  each  cubic  foot

of  volume,  the  animated  object  has

1 Hit Die.

The  object  gains  an  Intelligence

score (roll 3d6) and a Charisma score

(roll 1d3) from the spell. Other statis-

tics for animated objects are found in

the Monster Manual.

Material  Component: A  piece  or

handful of material of the same type

as the object to be animated.

XP  Cost:  250  XP  per  cubic  foot  of

material affected.

Duration: 10 minutes/level

You imbue the subject with powerful

transformative  magic,  granting  it

some  of  the  characteristics  of  the

plant  type.  The  subjects  skin  be-

comes  covered  over  with  moss  and

ivy,  not  unlike  the  appearance  of  a

shambling mound. Any spell or effect

that affects plant creatures also affects

the subject.

A plant creature is immune to criti-

cal  hits,  mind-affecting  effects,  poi-

son,  sleep, paralysis,  stunning,  and

polymorphing.

The  subjects  ability  scores,  skills,

and feats are unaffected (although its

new form may make it difficult or im-

RAPID BURROWING

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell increases the touched crea-

tures burrow speed by 20 feet. It has

no  effect  on  other  modes  of  move-

ment, nor does it allow the subject to

burrow  if  it  cannot  already  do  so  or

the ability to burrow through stone if

it cannot already do so.

REJECTION

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  give  the  subject  an  enhanced

sense of smell, equivalent to the scent

ability of some monsters. This ability

allows  the  creature  to  detect  ap-

proaching  enemies,  sniff  out  hidden

foes,  and  track  by  sense  of  smell.

Creatures  with  the  scent  ability  can

identify familiar odors just as humans

do  familiar  sights.  For  more  details,

see  Scent  in  the  introduction  to  the

Monster Manual.

Arcane Material Component: A sprin-

kle of mustard and pepper, and a drop

of sweat.

SKELETAL GUARD

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: One or more fingerbones

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  create  a  number  of  loyal  skele-

tons  from  fingerbones.  All  skeletons

are  Medium-size,  with  the  normal

Monster  Manual statistics  for  their

kind,  except  that  their  effective  Hit

Dice as far as turning is concerned is

equal to your caster level. You can cre-

ate  one  skeleton  per  caster  level.

These  skeletons  count  toward  the

number  of  Hit  Dice  of  undead  you

can have in your control (2 HD worth

per  caster  level,  as  with  the  animate

dead spell).

Unlike the animate dead spell, these

skeletons try to remain within 60 feet

of you. If this distance is exceeded, a

skeleton  becomes  inert  until  you  re-

turn to within 60 feet of it.

Material  Component: One  finger-

bone  from  a  Medium-size  creature

and  one  onyx  gem  worth  50  gp  per

skeleton  to  be  created. The  skeleton

that forms from the fingerbone is that

type of creature.

SONOROUS HUM

Evocation [Sonic]

Level: Brd 2, Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

After  you  cast  this  spell,  the  next

spell  you  cast  within  the  duration

that requires concentration to main-

tain  is  maintained  for  you  until  the

sonorous hum spell expires. This effect

allows  you  to  cast  other  spells,  even

another  spell  that  also  requires  con-

centration. If the spell maintained by

the  sonorous  hum has  a  shorter  dura-

tion than that of this spell, the main-

tained  spell  expires  as  it  normally

would and you gain no further bene-

fits from this casting of sonorous hum.

The  sound  created  by  the  spell  is  as

loud as a person in armor walking at

a slow pace trying not to make noise

(normally a DC 5 Listen check to de-

tect). You  may  end  the  sonorous  hum

as a free action.

For  example,  you  could  cast  this

spell, then cast detect thoughts, and this

spell maintains the concentration on

detect  thoughts while  you  cast  discern

lies and  maintain  concentration  on

that spell yourself. You control all as-

pects  of  both  spells,  so  you  could

change  the  orientation  of  the  detect

thoughts effect  and  select  a  different

target for your discern lies spell in the

same round.

SOUND LANCE

Evocation [Sonic]

Level: Clr 3, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10

Target: One creature or object

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

Sound  lance causes  a  projectile  of  in-

tense sonic energy sound to leap un-

erringly  from  you  to  a  target  within

range. The  sound  does  1d6  points  of

sonic  damage  per  caster  level,  to  a

maximum  of  10d6.  The  sound  lance

strikes  unerringly,  unless  the  target

has  total  cover  or  total  concealment.

A sound  lance cannot  penetrate  the

area of a silence spell.

SPEAK TO ALLIES

Transmutation [Language-

Dependent]

Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2

Targets: Any number of allied crea-

tures, no two of which may be

more than 30 ft. apart

As message, except as noted above and

that you and the recipients dont have

to  mouth  the  words  or  whisper,

which  means  that  those  skilled  in

reading  lips  have  no  opportunity  to

learn the messages.

SPELL FLOWER

Transmutation

Level: Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

You are able to hold the charge on one

touch spell per forelimb of your body

as  long  as  you  dont  use  that  limb  to

cast  other  spells  or  touch  anything

with  it.  Each  touch  spell  you  cast  re-

sides  in  a  different  forelimb.  For  the

duration of this spell, any touch spells

you cast are only discharged if you cast

another  spell  with  that  forelimb  or

touch something with that forelimb.

For  example,  a  human  sorcerer

casts  this  spell,  then  casts  chill  touch

and holds the charge in his left hand,

then casts shocking grasp and holds the

charge  in  his  right  hand.  Because  of

the spell flower, he can hold the charge

on  both  of  these  spells  at  the  same

time.  If  he  cast  another  spell  with  a

somatic  component  (which  requires

the  use  of  one  of  his  hands),  he  im-

mediately loses one of his held touch

spells (his choice), but if the spell he

casts is also a touch spell, he may im-

mediately  hold  the  charge  in  the

available hand. If he chooses to attack

with a touch spell, it works normally.

Since  he  has  multiple  limbs  that  are

considered  armed,  he  may  make  an

off-hand attack with the other touch

spell in the same round (with the nor-

mal  penalties  for  fighting  with  two

weapons).

A  marilith  spellcaster  could  do  the

same as the sorcerer in the previous ex-

ample, except that she could hold the

charge  on  up  to  six  touch  spells.  She

could also use any of her spell-like or

supernatural  abilities,  since  those  do

not interfere with holding the charge.

If the spell flower ends, the most re-

cent touch spell cast remains as a held

charge and all other held spells dissi-

pate.

STALKING SPELL

Illusion (Glamer)

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

As improved  invisibility, except  as

noted  above  and  that  the  creature  is

hidden  from  hearing  and  scent  as

well. The subject radiates silence to a

radius  of  5  feet  and  neither  leaves  a

scent nor can be detected by the scent

ability.

STONE BODY

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

This spell transforms your body into

living stone.

You gain damage reduction 10/.

You are immune to blindness, critical

hits,  ability  score  damage,  deafness,

disease, drowning, electricity, poison,

stunning, and all spells or attacks that

affect your physiology or respiration,

because  you  have  no  physiology  or

respiration  while  this  spell  is  in  ef-

fect. You take only half damage from

cold  and  fire  of  all  kinds.  However,

you also become vulnerable to all spe-

cial attacks that affect stone golems.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus

to your Strength score, but you take a

4  penalty  to  Dexterity  as  well  (to  a

minimum  Dexterity  score  of  1),  and

your speed is reduced to half normal.

You  have  an  arcane  spell  failure

chance of 50% and a 8 armor check

penalty, just as if you were clad in full

plate  armor.  You  cannot  drink  (and

thus  cant  use  potions)  or  play  wind

instruments.

Your  unarmed  attacks  deal  1d6

points of normal damage, and you are

considered  armed  when  making  un-

armed  attacks  (a  Small  caster  deals

1d4  points  of  damage,  not  1d6).  If

your  natural  attacks  already  deal

more than 1d6 points of damage, use

the greater value.

Your weight increases by a factor of

three,  causing  you  to  sink  in  water

like a stone. However, you could sur-

vive the crushing pressure and lack of

air  at  the  bottom  of  the  oceanat

least until the spell expires.

Material  Component: A  small  piece

of stone that was once part of either a

stone golem, a greater earth elemen-

tal, or a castle.

SUPERIOR RESISTANCE

Abjuration

Level: Brd 5, Clr 5, Drd 5, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You imbue the subject with a power-

ful magical energy that protects him

from  harm,  granting  a  +6  resistance

bonus on saves.

Arcane Material Component: A mini-

ature cloak of fine cloth.

UNDEAD MASK

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Clr 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  imbue  the  subject  with  power-

ful  transformative  magic,  granting

it some of the characteristics of the

undead  type.  The  subjects  flesh

seems  necrotic  and  rotting,  much

like  that  of  a  zombie.  Nonintelli-

gent undead ignore the subject un-

less the subject attacks the undead.

Any  spell  or  effect  that  affects  un-

dead  also  affects  the  subject.  The

subject can be turned, destroyed, re-

buked, or commanded as an undead

of  its  Hit  Dice  (and  gets  no  saving

throw to resist the result). Negative

energy effects (such as inflict spells)

heal  the  subject,  while  positive  en-

ergy  effects  (such  as  cure spells)

harm her.

An undead creature is immune to

mind-affecting  effects,  poison,  sleep,

paralysis, stunning, and disease. It is

immune  to  critical  hits,  subdual

damage,  ability  damage,  energy

drain,  or  death  from  massive  dam-

age.  The  subject  loses  its  Constitu-

tion score while the spell is in effect,

along  with  any  bonus  hit  points

from Constitution. The subject is im-

mune  to  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude  save  unless  the  effect  also

works  on  objects.  An  undead  spell-

caster  uses  its  Charisma  modifier

when making Concentration checks.

The subjects other ability scores are

unaffected.  The  subject  retains  its

skills and feats.

Material  Component: A  pinch  of

vampire dust.

VILE DEATH

Conjuration (Calling) [Evil]

Level: Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Target: One corporeal undead crea-

ture

Duration: Permanent (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  summon  the  spirit  of  a  fiend

from the depths of Hell or the Abyss

and bind it into the body of a corpo-

real  undead  creature.  Both  the  un-

dead creature and the fiend get a Will

saving throw to negate the effects of

vile death. Some fiends may voluntari-

ly fail the save if you swear to dismiss

the  effect  after  a  certain  task  or  an

amount  of  time.  Similarly,  some  un-

dead  may  voluntarily  fail  the  save  in

order to gain the fiends power, even

temporarily.

Binding  the  fiend  applies  the

fiendish  template  from  the  Monster

Manual to the undead creature. The re-

sulting creature is independent of you,

and may act on its own, and its initial

attitude toward you is indifferent.

Arcane Material Component: A bit of

Conjuration (Summoning) (see text)

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Personal

Effect: 1d4+3 summoned creatures

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  summons  1d4+3  fiendish

(CE)  or  celestial  (CG)  Medium-size

vipers  (snakes),  which  leap  forth

from your location to attack your en-

emies. If you can communicate with

the vipers, you can direct them not to

attack, to attack particular enemies, or

to perform other actions.

When you use a summoning spell

to summon an evil or good creature,

it is a spell of that type.

WALL OF LIMBS

Evocation

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./

level)

Effect: Wall of whirling limbs up to

20 ft. long/caster level, or a ring

of whirling limbs with a radius of

up to 5 ft./two caster levels, either

form 20 ft. high

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Reflex half or Reflex

negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

An  immobile,  vertical  curtain  of

whirling limbs springs into existence.

The  limbs  resemble  your  own  fore-

limbs.  Any  creature  passing  through

the  wall  takes  1d6  points  of  bludg-

eoning damage per caster level (max-

imum  15d6),  with  a  Reflex  save  for

half damage.

If  you  evoke  the  wall  so  that  it  ap-

pears  where  creatures  are,  each  crea-

ture takes damage as if passing through

the wall. Each such creature can avoid

the  wall  (ending  up  on  the  side  of  its

choice)  and  thus  take  no  damage  by

making a successful Reflex save.

The wall of limbs provides one-half

cover (+4 AC, +2 Reflex saves) against

attacks made through it.

WEAPON OF ENERGY

Transmutation (see text)

Level: Clr 4, Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Person

Target: One weapon

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude (object,

harmless)

Spell Resistance: None

You cause a weapon to gain the ability

to  deal  energy  damage  in  addition  to

its  other  abilities,  similar  to  how  a

flaming burst weapon deals extra fire

damage  on  a  hit  or  critical  hit.  The

weapon can deal acid, cold, electricity,

fire, or sonic damage, chosen by you at

the time of casting. The weapon deals

+1d6 damage of that energy type on a

successful  hit.  On  a  critical  hit,  the

weapon  deals  an  additional  +1d10

points  of  energy  damage.  If  the

weapons critical multiplier is 3, add

+2d10  points  of  energy  damage  in-

stead,  and  if  the  multiplier  is  4,  add

+3d10 points of bonus energy damage.

This spell can be cast on a weapon

that already deals energy damage, but

if the weapon already creates the same

type of damage as the spell, the effects

do not stack. For example, if cast on a

+1  flaming  longsword to  give  it  addi-

tional fire damage, the spell has no ef-

fect, but it can give the weapon any of

the other types of energy damage.

This spell has a subtype that is the

same as the energy created by the tar-

get  weapon.  For  example,  weapon  of

energy is a fire spell when used to give

a weapon bonus fire damage.

WINGS OF THE SEA

Transmutation

Level: Clr 2, Drd 1, Rgr 1, Sor/Wiz 2

Components: S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: You or person touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell increases the touched crea-

tures swim speed by 30 feet. It has no

effect on other modes of movement,

nor  does  it  give  the  subject  a  swim

speed if it does not already have one.

Material  Component: A  drop  of

water.

he DUNGEON MASTERs Guide presents the arcane archer,

the assassin, the blackguard, the dwarven defender,

the  loremaster,  and  the  shadowdancer  prestige

classes. All of those classes are available to monsters

that meet the requirements. The ten new monster pres-

tige classes described in this chapter provide additional

opportunities for monster characters to improve their

powers and abilities.

DESIGNING MONSTER

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Prestige classes allow the DM to create campaign-specific,

exclusive roles and positions. These special roles offer abil-

ities and powers otherwise inaccessible to monsters and

focus them in specific, interesting directions.

WHY DO IT?

Of the four reasons for designing a prestige class, three

truly apply to monster prestige classes.

1. Develop an Organization: Monsters have an organi-

zation line in their Monster Manual entry. You may choose

to flesh these out by creating monster prestige classes that

occupy certain positions within the monster society.

2. Develop a Race or Culture: Like organizations, races

and cultures can benefit from having specific rules to

showcase their abilities. While each race is detailed in the

Players Handbook with different abilities to make it dis-

tinctive, two of the prestige classes in the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide (the arcane archer and the dwarven

defender) help demonstrate howthrough the

ruleseach race can have its own archetypes as evi-

denced in many campaign worlds and fantasy tradi-

tions. You could easily create many more such pres-

tige classes (the elven woodstalker or the gnome

trickster, for example).

Cultures can benefit from prestige classes per-

haps most of all. The game does not provide rules

for how the orcs of the Southern Kingdom in your

campaign differ from the orcs of the Direwood

Forest. You could create an extensive description

of how the spear-using warriors of the south have

a completely different fighting style from that of

the hardy, no-nonsense warriors of the Direwood.

However, the southern speardancer and the Dire-

wood ranger prestige classes could speak vol-

umes on the subject. It makes every culture and

every populated place that you create for your

campaign something truly special.

3. Encourage an Otherwise Suboptimal

Option: A prestige class can take a poor choice

possible within the rules, such as specializing in

the whip, and make it worthwhile. Imagine a

prestige class that granted abilities enabling a 73

AS

character to entangle foes with his whip, gaining a bonus on

trip and disarm maneuvers, and granting special damage

bonuses with the weapon. Suddenly, the whip becomes an

interesting choice. Characters with strange multiclass com-

binations, or who have their best score in Charisma, or who

are of a lesser race such as a goblin or a kobold could all have

access to prestige classes enhancing those choices. Poten-

tially, you could create prestige classes that granted interest-

ing abilities for characters who spent a lot of skill points in

Innuendo, Intimidate, or a particular Knowledge or Craft.

4. Advance Characters: While a DM may advance a mon-

ster at will, a monster prestige class allows players to advance

their monster characters as monsters rather than as members

of a character class, through the games experience point

system. If you are using the rules in Chapter 3: Monster

Classes, then a prestige class allows a character to continue

advancing beyond the maximum level normally available.

DESIGN GUIDANCE

Choose Specific over General: You have an advantage

that no one else hasthat no game designer can ever have.

You know the specific details of your campaign. When cre-

ating a monster prestige class, use your knowledge of these

details of your campaign to their fullest. The first rule is to

forget the general and embrace the specific. You are not cre-

ating a prestige class for everyones campaignjust for

yours. When designing for monsters, focus the class on the

strengths of a specific kind or type of monster. Emphasize

that monsters special attacks, special qualities, weapon use,

or some other factor.

Create Requirements: All prestige class requirements

are based around the idea that the monster that qualifies for

the class is already proficient in the aspects in which the

prestige class excels. For instance, a medusa prestige class

should require a petrifying gaze attack, as well as ranks in

Bluff, Disguise, Move Silently, and Spot.

Two types of requirements can be used to determine who

can take a prestige class. The first type is game requirements.

These are hard and fast limitsoften numerical values

which a monster must meet or exceed to qualify. The second

type is character requirements. These are aspects of an

individualrace, age, religionas well as deeds that the

monster has accomplished. For example, to qualify for the

illithid savant prestige class, which specializes in gaining

skills and knowledge by devouring brains, a character must

consume the brain of a creature of at least CR 9. Sometimes

these character requirements are simply role-playing hooks

that tie into the organization or culture that a prestige class

represents, such as pledging allegiance to a monarch, paying

initial membership dues, or performing a specific religious

rite. Do not be afraid of nongame requirements, for they

really add life to a prestige class (but on the other hand, dont

use them for game balance purposes either, for they have no

game rule significance).

A minimum ability score (or ability score bonus), a cer-

tain number of hit points, or some other aspect of a monster

that is determined by a die roll should not be used as a pres-

tige class requirement. Requirements should be based on

choices such as feats or skills ranks.

Further, remember that ostensibly, prestige classes do not

map to existing classes. That is to say, no prestige class

should be set up specifically for members of a regular class.

Class and level are not good requirements. That said, once

you assign a set number of skill ranks or feats as require-

ments, its not difficult to figure out which class can meet

those requirements at what level. The requirements for the

assassin prestige class in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, for

example, can be met as early as 5th level by a rogue, but even

a wizard could potentially meet the requirements (at 13th

level). No character lower than 5th level should be able to

qualify for a prestige class.

Designing Abilities: Every level of a monster prestige

class should include some significant benefit. Remember

that the monster should improve as much as if it had taken

a character class, or advanced as a monster. Spellcasters in

particular have a difficult time missing out on the new

spells they gain with each level in their spellcasting class,

pqqrs

SAMPLE CHARACTERS AND EQUIPMENT

The sample characters provided for the prestige classes in

this chapter have possessions appropriate for NPCs of

their ECL. If you wish to use these characters as player

characters, they each need thousands of gold pieces worth

of additional equipment. Compare PC and NPC equip-

ment using Table 224: Starting Equipment for PCs above

1st Level and Table 244: NPC Gear Value in the DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide.

and so prestige classes aimed at casters must be particularly

attractive. The first ability or abilities gained should be

matched to the minimum level that a character could possi-

bly qualify for the class. Thus, if a ranger can qualify for the

class at 5th level, the benefits of 1st level in the prestige class

should be roughly equivalent to the benefits a ranger gains

for attaining 6th level.

Much of the trick of balancing prestige class levels is

involved in the small issues: base attack bonus increases, Hit

Die size, and even weapon and armor proficiency can be

strong enticements in taking a level in the prestige class.

Remember that gaining proficiency in weapons or armor is

like gaining free feats.

Major abilities, particularly brand-new powers, should be

carefully considered. They should never be more powerful

or useful than the types of abilities that other monsters

have. Look at existing class abilities, feats, and the prestige

classes in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for ideas. It is okay to

borrow directly from the abilities of other classes when

designing a prestige class.

Monster prestige classes should never duplicate the

supernatural abilities of other kinds of monsters. For

instance, when designing a prestige class for centaurs, do

not use a petrifying gaze as a feature of that class. The pet-

rifying gaze is a hallmark of creatures such as the medusa

and basilisk, and should be reserved for those creatures

only.

Spells and Spell Lists: A spellcasting prestige class may

have its own spell list. Choose spells appropriate to the

class, and perhaps even make up some new, signature

spells. However, keep the spell list relatively short. It

should have the spells appropriate for the class and no

morefor a wide variety of spells, a character can pick up a

level of wizard or cleric. It is equally acceptable to allow

spellcasters to continue advancing as their original type of

spellcaster.

Occasionally, if a spell is a signature spell of a prestige

class, you can lower the level of the spell by one for that

class. For example, for a flame mage prestige class, wall of

fire might be considered a 3rd-level rather than a 4th-level

spell. This technique should be used sparinglyonly once

or twice for a given class, if at all.

Special Considerations: Prestige classes tied to organi-

zations might have ongoing requirements. These can

include assignments, dues, personal sacrifices of wealth, or

obedience. Becoming or remaining a member of a prestige

class might involve being an apprentice for a time to

another member or eventually taking on a prospective

member as an apprentice.

Entry into a prestige class might come with strings

attached. Powerful enemies may seek out members of the

class, or those among the groups ranks must face the preju-

dices of the local folk. Membership in some prestige classes

might even be illegal in certain parts of the world.

EMANCIPATED SPAWN

Wretched slaves of undead, bonded eternally by unnatural

death, various kinds of spawn haunt the night. Once in a

great while, one of these unfortunates finds herself freed

when the undead creature that created it is destroyed. Now,

though still cursed with undeath, the emancipated spawn

begins to recall her former life and perhaps finds some

measure of redemption.

The unlife of an emancipated spawn is a lonely one. Few

creatures she meets are likely to perceive that she is search-

ing for old memories and simply try to destroy her as

quickly as possible. An emancipated spawn might be found

in the company of her former adventuring friends (who

may even have been her liberators), who are unwilling to

abandon their former companion.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an emancipated spawn, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Intelligent undead created by another undead

using its create spawn ability.

Base Attack Bonus: +3.

Special: Must have been created as a spawn by an undead

creature that has since been destroyed.

CLASS SKILLS

The emancipated spawns class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Disguise (Cha),

Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis),

Move Silently (Dex), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and

Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

pqqqqrs

FREED SPAWN

If  an  undead  spawns  creator  is  destroyed,  the  spawn  is  no

longer  controlled  by  that  creature.  If  the  freed  spawn  was  a

player character when alive, it can now adventure like a char-

acter  with  an  ECL  equivalent  to  the  creators.  For  instance,  a

freed  ghoul  spawn  has  an  ECL  of  5,  and  a  freed  shadow

spawns ECL is 10.

an undead creature, a freed spawn has basic memories of its

past (what sort of character it was in life, who his or her friends

were, and so forth). These basic memories can help the freed

spawn find and rejoin its old adventuring party, if thats what

the character wants to do.

When the mental link that binds it to its creator is broken, a

freed  spawn  is  instantly  aware  of  that  fact.  It  can  choose  to

revert to the alignment the character had when he or she was

alive. Whether it does this or retains its current alignment as

pqqqqrs

A freed spawn can gain experience points through adventur-

ing, adding them to the XP total the character had when alive.

When it becomes eligible to advance a level, it can add class

levels  as  normal  or  pursue  the  emancipated  spawn  prestige

class, which eventually enables the spawn to recall all the abil-

ities it had before it became an undead.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the emancipated

spawn prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Emancipated spawn

are  proficient  with  all  simple

weapons, and otherwise nei-

ther gain nor lose any weapon,

armor, or shield proficiencies

by gaining levels of this class.

Turn Resistance (Ex): An

emancipated  spawn  gains  an

additional +2 turn resistance at

each level. This stacks with

any inherent turn resistance

of the undead creature; for example, an emanci-

pated ghoul at 1st level would benefit from a total

turn resistance of +4 (+2 for being a ghoul and +2

for the prestige class).

Recall Feats (Ex): At 1st level, an emanci-

pated spawn remembers several aspects of her

former existence. She regains all the feats

she had as a living character, provided she

meets their prerequisites. These remem-

bered feats are in addition to any feats

gained for advancing a level.

Recall Class Features (Ex): At 2nd

level, an emancipated spawn remem-

bers more of her former existence. She

now can use all the class features of

one former class, as a character of

that former classs level. If the

former class was a spellcasting

class,  the  emancipated

spawn is able to cast one

spell of each level avail-

able to the character (if she was a wizard,

she must still consult her spellbook, or

learn from scrolls if her spellbook was lost

when she became a spawn). If the character

had a familiar, the empathic link between

her and the familiar is reestablished.

Rediscovery (Ex): At 3rd level, the eman-

cipated spawn comes fully into her heritage. She

recalls all her former class features and abilities,

regains her former base attack bonus, base saving

throw bonuses gained from class levels, hit points,

and all other class benefits, and can now advance again

in any of her former classes. This applies even if a former

character class does not normally allow free multiclassing,

provided the character did not leave the path prior to her

transformation into an undead spawn. Thus, a former pal-

adin could continue to gain levels as a paladin (effectively

multiclassing as a monster/paladin), but if she had left the

path of paladinhood before her transformation, she is still

ineligible to return to that class.

In addition, a 3rd-level emancipated spawn receives the

benefit of a sudden jump in ECL. If a character takes all

three levels of the emancipated spawn prestige class, its ECL

becomes the sum of its monster ECL + its three levels of

emancipated spawn + the characters

former class levels.

For example, Yvine was a

10th-level fighter who became

a  ghoul  spawn  and

then  was  freed.  He

adventures as an ECL 5

character and then takes one

level of emancipated spawn, be-

coming ECL 6. His next level is

also emancipated spawn, making

his ECL 7. When he next takes

the 3rd level of emancipated

spawn, his ECL becomes 18

(5 for ghoul + 3 for emancipated

spawn + 10 for fighter).

SAMPLE

EMANCIPATED

SPAWN

This  example  uses  a

shadow based on an

elf sorcerer, Anastri-

anna Galanodel. Killed by a

shadow while in search of

an  evil  tome,  Anastri-

anna  rose  from  the

dead  as  a  shadow  3

rounds later. Shortly

thereafter, she real-

ized  that  her  master  had

been destroyed and she was

no longer under its control.

She chose to revert to her

former neutral alignment and

then spent much time strug-

gling to regain her memories.

Anastrianna now recalls her previous

life and her spellcasting ability. Her raven

familiar returned to her when she regained

her class abilities. Accompanied by her familiar,

Anastrianna adventures as a shadow now, looking

for ways to increase her power.

ILLITHID SAVANT

Mind flayers are connoisseurs of brains, but some take this

taste to the next level. The illithid savant is an academic who

deals in applied science, acquiring new knowledge from the

brains he consumes.

Often an illithid savant specializes in the arcane arts, usu-

ally as a wizard since he tends toward scholarly pursuits.

Bards, with their insatiable quest for knowledge, frequently

gravitate to this career. Less often, a nonclassed mind flayer

stumbles onto the path of the savant through consuming a

particularly noteworthy brain.

Illithid savants make excellent support members for just

about any group, although they prefer the company of other

mind flayers. They usually bring several thralls of desired

classes or creature types for consumption as needed. A

savant often heads up an inquisition or even a cult to pursue

his ends.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an illithid savant, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Race: Mind flayer.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks.

Special: Must have consumed the brain of a creature of

CR 9 or greater.

CLASS SKILLS

The illithid savants class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Hide (Dex),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (any) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Move Silently (Dex), Scry (Int, exclusive skill), Search (Int),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the illithid savant

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Illithid savants nei-

ther gain nor lose proficiency with any weapons, armor, or

shields by gaining levels in this class.

Acquire Skill (Ex): At 1st level, an illithid savant can

acquire one skill known by a creature whose brain he has

consumed, chosen at the time of consumption. He perma-

nently gains all of the creatures ranks in that skill (but not

racial or ability score bonuses to the skill modifier) even if

his new total is more ranks than the illithid savants current

character level would normally allow. This skill becomes a

class skill for the illithid savant, and he may buy more ranks

in the skill if the new ranks do not cause him to exceed his

maximum ranks in the skill.

At 4th, 6th, and 8th level, the illithid savant can acquire

and use one additional skill from a brain.

Lore (Ex): At 1st level, an illithid savant gains the ability

to make a special lore check twice per day to recall esoteric

information from the brains of those he has consumed. Just

as with a bardic knowledge check (see Chapter 3 of the

Players Handbook for more on this ability and typical check

DCs), the illithid savant adds his level in this prestige class

and his Intelligence modifier as bonuses on any attempt to

learn something unusual.

At 2nd, 5th, and 9th level, the illithid savant can make a

special lore check two additional times per day.

Acquire Feat (Ex): At 2nd level, an illithid savant perma-

nently acquires one of the feats of a consumed creature, pro-

vided he meets that feats prerequisites. At 4th, 6th, and 8th

level, the illithid savant can acquire and use one additional

feat from a consumed brain.

Acquire Class Feature (Ex): At 3rd level, an illithid

savant permanently gains one class feature of a consumed

brains owner, as a character of that creatures level in that

class. If the former character was a spellcaster, the illithid

savant is able to cast one spell of each level available to the

character (if the victim was a wizard, the mind flayer must

still consult a spellbook or learn from scrolls), as well as any

bonus spells provideded by the illithid savants ability

scores. If the illithid savant already has spellcasting levels,

these spells are in addition to those granted by the illithid

savants spellcasting class levels.

At 7th level and again at 10th level, the illithid savant can

gain another class feature from a consumed brain.

Acquire Special Attack or Special Quality (Ex): At 5th

level, the illithid savant permanently gains one special attack

or special quality of a consumed brains owner. The chosen

ability must not rely on a physical feature of the consumed

creature, such as a gaze attack, a breath weapon, flight, or a

natural attack with an appendage not possessed by the mind

flayer. If the ability allows a saving throw, the illithid savant

uses his own ability score modifier to determine the DC.

At 9th level, the illithid savant can gain another special

attack or special quality from a consumed brain.

SAMPLE ILLITHID SAVANT

Sugglir Wissenka is a male mind flayer who pursued the

path of the shadowdancer almost from birth. He and his

shadow companion gathered many slaves for the glory of

Sugglirs city. An assault by drow made Sugglir realize that

his true loyalties lay among the illithids, so he abandoned

his career as a shadowdancer and began developing his

skills as an illithid savant. Sugglir is a devoted defender of

his people. He may be encountered on missions to destroy

threats to the illithids of his city.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This is an acquired class feature. If

Sugglir can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend

herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot

for extra damage. Any time Sugglirs target would be denied

her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether she actually

has a Dexterity bonus or not), Sugglirs attack deals +7d6

points of damage. Should Sugglir score a critical hit with a

sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is

30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, Sugglir can make a

sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal

damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage

to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even with the

usual 4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of his

weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

Sugglir can only sneak attack living creatures with dis-

cernible anatomiesundead, constructs, oozes, plants,

and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Addi-

tionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly

immune to sneak attacks. In addition, Sugglir must also be

able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot

and must be able to reach a vital spot. Sugglir cannot sneak

attack while striking at a creature with concealment or by

striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond

reach.

Mind Blast (Sp): This attack is a cone 60 feet long. Anyone

caught in this cone must succeed on a Will save (DC 18) or

be stunned for 3d4 rounds. Mind flayers often hunt using

this power and then drag off one or two of their stunned vic-

tims to feed upon.

Psionics (Sp): At willastral projection, charm monster,

detect thoughts, levitate, plane shift, and suggestion. These abili-

ties are as the spells cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save DC 14

+ spell level). The DCs are Charisma-based.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Sugglir must hit

a Small to Large creature with his tentacle attack. If he gets

a hold, he attaches the tentacle to the opponents head. Sug-

glir can grab a Huge or larger creature, but only if he can

somehow reach the foes head.

After a successful grab, Sugglir can try to attach his

remaining tentacles with a single grapple check. The oppo-

nent can escape with a single successful grapple check or

Escape Artist check, but Sugglir gets a +2 circumstance

bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the beginning

of the opponents turn.

Extract (Ex): If Sugglir begins his turn with all four ten-

tacles attached and successfully maintains his hold, he auto-

matically extracts the opponents brain, instantly killing that

creature.

Telepathy (Su): Sugglir can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su): Sugglir can use the Hide skill

even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of

some sort of shadow, he can hide from view in the open

without anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, how-

ever, hide in his own shadow.

Evasion: If Sugglir is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage

(such as a fireball), he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if Sugglir

is wearing light armor or no armor.

Uncanny Dodge: Sugglir can react to danger before

his senses would normally allow him to even be aware

of  it.  He  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus  to

Armor  Class  regardless  of  being  caught

flat-footed  or  struck  by  an  invisible  at-

tacker.  (He  still  loses  his  Dexterity  bonus  to

Armor Class if immobilized.)

Shadow Illusion

(Sp): Sugglir  can

create  visual  illusions

from  surrounding  shad-

ows.  This  ability  is  identical  to

the arcane spell silent image and may be

employed once per day.

Summon Shadow (Sp):

Sugglir  has  sum-

moned  a  shadow,

an undead shade

(see  the  Shadow

entry in the Mon-

ster  Manual for  its

statistics).  Unlike  a

normal  shadow,  this

shadows alignment match-

es  Sugglirs.  The  sum-

moned  shadow  cannot

be  turned,  rebuked,  or  com-

manded by any third party.

This  shadow  serves  as  a  companion

to  Sugglir  and  can  communicate  in-

telligibly with him.

If his shadow companion is destroyed, or if Sugglir

chooses to dismiss it, Sugglir must attempt a Fortitude save

(DC 15). If the saving throw fails, he loses 600 experience

points. A successful saving throw reduces the loss to 300

XP. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot

be replaced for a year and a day.

Skills: *This is an acquired skill.

Feats: **This is an acquired feat.

Lore (Ex): Sugglir gets a +9 bonus

on his lore checks. He can

use this ability

twice a day.

MASTER OF FLIES

Ravings from fevered explorers describe an unstoppable

horror, a swarming mass that creeps under doors and

through window frames to drain the life from its hapless

prey. Such stories are usually dismissed, but they do contain

a kernel of truth. The master of flies is an intelligent swarm

that can form a massive being at need, or a single creature

that can dissolve into a cloud of vermin.

A master of flies may be a creature having an affinity with

vermin, such as a drider or an aranea. Sometimes she is a

being who has an innate ability to summon creatures, such

as a vampire. The master of flies is a favorite prestige class of

demons, who revel in the horrific. Sometimes even a druid

may follow this path.

Becoming a master of flies usually appeals to a depraved

personality intent on horror and destruction. Such beings

shun all contact with others except to insinuate themselves

into a group of potential prey.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a master of flies, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills: Escape Artist 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 8 ranks.

Feats: Quick Change (see Chapter 4).

Special: Must possess the ability to change form, such as

from an alternate form ability, the shapechanger subtype, or

a wild shape ability.

CLASS SKILLS

The master of flies class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Control Shape (Wis),

Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha),

Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Move

Silently (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the master of flies

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A master of flies nei-

ther gains nor loses proficiency with any weapons, armor, or

shields by gaining levels of this class.

Summon Swarm (Sp): A master of flies can use summon

swarm as a sorcerer of her character level. She can use this

ability once per day per level she has attained in this pres-

tige class. The creatures summoned must be vermin; roll

1d20 on the following table.

1420

Swarm Type

Spiders (vermin, poisonous)

Centipedes (vermin, poisonous)

Flying beetles (vermin)

Swarm Shape (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a master of

flies can take the form of a swarm of vicious little vermin

and return to her own form. This effect is similar to that of a

summon swarm spell, except that the swarm is of the same

size category as the caster (and it has the same face statistic

as the caster). The master of flies can choose the type of

vermin from the table above. In swarm shape, she can move

at a speed of 15 feet, or up to 45 feet if the swarm flies (poor

maneuverability).

The swarm has the same number of hit points as the orig-

inal creature and can be damaged by fire and area-effect

spells and abilities. If the swarm is dispersed (by gust of wind,

for example), the master of flies must return to her own

shape. To do so, the dispersed creatures must first coalesce

(at the swarms speed); the master of flies must take a stan-

dard action on the following round to transform.

A master of flies can use this ability once per day at 2nd

level and more times per day at 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 9th

level, as shown on Table 73: The Master of Flies.

At 5th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a

swarm identical to that produced by an insect plague spell,

except that the swarm can be no more than one size larger

than the master of flies (you can choose the face if more

than one is available). This swarm can move at half the

master of flies normal speed and can fly at the same speed

(clumsy maneuverability).

At 8th level, a master of flies is able to take the shape of a

swarm identical to that produced by a creeping doom spell,

except that the swarm can be no more than two size cate-

gories larger than the master of flies (you can choose the

face statistic if more than one is possible). This mass of

vermin can only move at 10 feet per round and cannot fly.

In all other respects, the swarm shape ability is identical

to the druids wild shape ability (see Chapter 3 of the Players

Handbook).

Pied Piper (Su): At 3rd level, a master of flies is able to in-

fluence vermin to a limited extent. She can use this ability

once  per  day  per  level  in  this

prestige  class  to  charm  a

number of Hit Dice of ver-

min  equal  to  or  less  than

her character level, starting

with  the  lowest  Hit  Dice

vermin within range and

moving up in Hit Dice

until  the  limit  is

reached. The  range  of

this  effect  is  10  feet  

the  master  of  flies  level.

The  vermin  are  allowed

Will  saves  against  this  ef-

fect (DC 14 + Cha modifi-

er),  and  any  that  make

their  save  cannot  be  af-

fected  again  by  the  pied

piper  ability  of  that  master  of

flies for one day.

Charmed  vermin  move  to-

ward  the  master  of  flies  at

their  land  speed,  taking  the

most direct path available.

If  the path leads into a dan-

gerous  area,  the  creatures

get another saving throw.

Charmed  vermin  can

take  no  actions  other

than  to  defend  them-

selves. If the master of flies

moves,  the  charmed  ver-

min  follow. This  effect

lasts  for  as  long  as  the

master of flies concen-

trates.  Once  concentra-

tion  is  broken,  those

vermin  cannot  be  af-

fected  again  by  the

pied  piper  ability  of

that  master  of  flies

for one day.

Insect  Plague (Sp):

Beginning  at  5th

level,  a  master  of

flies can use the spell-like

ability insect plague as a sor-

cerer  of  her  class  level.  She

can  use  this  ability  once

per  day  per  level  in  this

prestige class.

Flyblown  (Su): At  7th

level, a master of flies can

shift  to  a  swarm  shape

and back as a free action.

Creeping  Doom (Sp):  Be-

ginning at 8th level, a master of flies

can use the spell-like ability creeping doom as a sorcerer of her

class level. She can use this ability once per day per level in

this prestige class.

Awaken Vermin (Sp):  At  9th  level,  a  master

of  flies  gains  the  ability  to  awaken  hu-

manlike  sentience  in  a  vermin.

She can use this ability once

per  week.  This  ability  is

identical to the 5th-

level  druid  spell

awaken, except that

only  vermin  can  be

affected and there is

no XP cost.

Swarm

Leap

(Su):  At  10th  level,

a master of flies be-

comes  completely

attuned to the throb

and  hum  of  vermin

swarms,  gaining  the

supernatural  ability

to  instantaneously

transport  herself

over great distances

through  that  medi-

um.  Once  per  day

as  a  standard  ac-

tion,  she  can  enter

any swarm of mun-

dane  vermin  whose

size equals or exceeds

her  own  and  travel  to

another  such  swarm

in a single round, re-

gardless  of  distance.

The  master  of  flies

merely designates a dis-

tance  and  direction  (a

swarm  50  miles  south  of

here),  and  the  swarm  leap

ability transports her to a des-

tination swarm as close as possi-

ble to the desired location. She can

attempt to name a specific swarm (a

beehive  in  an  apiary  just  outside  the

city of Greyhawk), but if no such target

exists,  the  ability  fails  and  the  master  of

flies is ejected from the entry swarm.

Both  the  entry  swarm  and  the  destination

swarm must be alive, but they can be either nat-

urally occurring or summoned. A master of flies in

swarm shape cannot use herself as the entry point,

but she could enter through an insect plague she created

in a previous round. She could even use another master

of flies in swarm shape as the entry or destination swarm.

When exiting a swarm, the master of flies must choose an

adjacent 5-foot-by-5-foot space in which to appear (or a cor-

respondingly larger space if it is larger than Medium-size).

81

Except as noted here, this ability functions like the 6th-

level druid spell transport via plants.

SAMPLE MASTER OF FLIES

Mictecacihuatl appointed herself guardian of the forest she

calls home. As a ranger, she patrolled her forest, frightening

off intruders and slaying despoilers out of hand. As she gained

knowledge in the ways of nature, she embraced the spider side

of her nature and became a master of flies. Mictecacihuatl is

fond of spider swarms, and her forest teems with them.

Finesse (bite), Weapon Focus (longspear).

Spells: Mictecacihuatl casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer

(save DC 12 + spell level). She prefers illusions and charms

and avoids fire spells.

Web (Ex): In spider or hybrid form (see Alternate Form,

below), Mictecacihuatl can use her web ability up to six

times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a

maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet,

and is effective against targets of up to Large size (see the Net

entry in Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook for details). The

web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful

Escape Artist check (DC 20) or burst the web with a suc-

cessful Strength check (DC 26). The web has 6 hit points

and takes double damage from fire.

Poison (Ex): Bite, Fortitude save (DC 13); initial damage

1d6 Strength, secondary damage 2d6 Strength.

Alternate Form (Su): Mictecacihuatls natural form is

that of a Large monstrous spider. She can assume two other

formsan elf or a Medium-size spider-humanoid hybrid.

Changing form is a move-equivalent action (see Quick

Change in Chapter 4).

In humanoid form, Mictecacihuatl gains all the abilities

of the form (for example, Mictecacihuatl in elf form has elf

traits). She keeps her ability scores and can cast spells, but

she cannot use webs or poison in humanoid form.

In hybrid form, Mictecacihuatl looks like a humanoid at first

glance, but a successful Spot check (DC 18) reveals her fangs

and spinnerets. She can use weapons and webs in this form.

Mictecacihuatl remains in one form until she chooses to

assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled,

nor does she revert to its natural form when killed. A true

seeing spell, however, reveals her natural form if she is in

humanoid or hybrid form.

Favored Enemy: Mictecacihuatl has selected giants as a

favored enemy. She gains a +1 bonus on her Bluff, Listen,

Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these

skills against this type of creature. She gets the same bonus

on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this type. She

also gets the damage bonus with ranged weapons if the

target is within 30 feet.

Summon Swarm (Sp): Mictecacihuatl can use her summon

swarm ability five times per day as a 5th-level sorcerer. The

creatures summoned must be vermin; roll 1d20 on the fol-

lowing table.

d20

713

1420

Swarm Type

Spiders (vermin, poisonous)

Centipedes (vermin, poisonous)

Flying beetles (vermin)

Swarm Shape (Su): Three times per day, Mictecacihuatl

can take the form of a swarm of vicious little vermin and

return to her own form once per day. This effect is similar to

that of a summon swarm spell, except that the swarm is of up

to Medium-size. Mictecacihuatl can choose the type of

vermin from the summon swarm table above. In swarm

shape, Mictecacihuatl can move at up to 15 feet, or up to 45

feet if the swarm flies (poor maneuverability).

The swarm has the same number of hit points as Micte-

cacihuatl and can be damaged by fire and area-effect spells

and abilities. If the swarm is dispersed (by gust of wind, for

example), Mictecacihuatl must return to her own shape. To

do so, the dispersed creatures must first coalesce (at the

swarms speed); Mictecacihuatl must take a standard action

on the following round to transform.

Mictecacihuatl is also able to take the shape of a swarm

identical to that produced by an insect plague spell, except

that the swarm can be no more than Large size (she chooses

her face statistic, either 5 ft. or 10 ft.). This swarm can move

at half of Mictecacihuatls land speed and can fly at the same

speed (clumsy maneuverability).

In all other respects, the swarm shape ability is identical

to the druids wild shape ability.

Pied Piper (Su): Mictecacihuatl is able to influence

vermin to a limited extent. She can use this ability five times

per day to charm up to 5 Hit Dice of vermin, starting with the

lowest Hit Dice vermin within range and moving up in Hit

Dice until the maximum is reached. The range of this effect is

50 feet. The vermin are allowed Will saves against this effect

(DC 16), and any that make their save cannot be affected

again by Mictecacihuatls pied piper ability for one day.

Charmed vermin move toward Mictecacihuatl at their

basic speed, taking the most direct path available. If the path

leads into a dangerous area, the creatures get another saving

throw. Charmed vermin can take no actions other than to

defend themselves. If Mictecacihuatl moves, the charmed

vermin follow. This effect lasts for as long as Mictecacihuatl

concentrates. Once concentration is broken, those vermin

cannot be affected again by Mictecacihuatls pied piper abil-

ity for one day.

Insect Plague (Sp): Five times per day, Mictecacihuatl can

use her insect plague ability as a 5th-level sorcerer.

SCALED HORROR

Scaled horrors are elite amphibious soldiers. They specialize

in guarding the watery borders of lizardfolk domains. Strik-

ing abruptly from the waters edge, they leave fear and

destruction in their wake. Many an unwary intruder is last

seen as a trail of bubbles in the marsh waters, taken below by

scaled horrors.

Lizardfolk are the most common scaled horrors, but

locathahs, merfolk, and sahuagin sometimes have similar

guardians. Occasionally kuo-toas train as scaled horrors as

well.

As NPCs, scaled horrors work in squads of 25 members

along the edges of their peoples domains. They sometimes

serve other races as mercenaries, but always in situations

where they can fight from the water. They rarely work alone,

but even a solitary scaled horror is a skilled guerrilla.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a scaled horror, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Race: Character must have either the aquatic or the rep-

tilian subtype.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Hide 5 ranks, Move Silently 5 ranks, plus either

Swim 5 ranks or a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks.

CLASS SKILLS

The scaled horrors class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Hide (Dex),

Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Search (Int),

Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the scaled horror

prestige class.

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, shields,

and light armor. Otherwise they neither gain nor lose

weapon, armor, or shield proficiency by taking levels in

this class.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a scaled horror hits with its nat-

ural weapons or unarmed attack, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity. The ability works only against

opponents of the same size or smaller. The scaled horror has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

natural weapons or unarmed attack to hold the opponent.

Each successful grapple check it makes during successive

rounds automatically deals damage given for the attack that

established the hold.

Keen Scent (Ex): A scaled horror can notice creatures by

scent in a 180-foot radius, provided both the scaled horror

and the creature are in the same body of water, and can

detect blood in the water at a range of up to 1 mile.

Spells: Beginning at 1st level, a scaled horror gains the

ability to cast divine spells from the ranger spell list (see

Chapter 11 of the Players Handbook). To cast a spell, the

scaled horror must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the

spells level, so a scaled horror with a Wisdom of 10 or lower

cannot cast these spells. Scaled horror bonus spells are based

on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a

DC of 10 + spell level + the scaled horrors Wisdom bonus.

When the scaled horror gets 0 spells of a given level, such as

0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the scaled horror gets only

bonus spells. A scaled horror without a bonus spell for that

level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. A scaled horror pre-

pares and casts spells just as a ranger does (though the scaled

horrors caster level is the same as its class level).

Freedom of Movement (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a

scaled horror moves and fights underwater as if subject to

the spell freedom of movement.

Damage Reduction (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a scaled

horror gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury

from each blow or attack. Subtract 2 from the damage the

scaled horror takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th

level, this damage reduction rises to 4/. Damage reduction

cannot reduce damage to less than 0.

Spring Attack (Ex): At 5th level, a scaled horror gains

Spring Attack as a bonus feat.

Silent Spell: At 7th level, a scaled horror gains Silent

Spell as a bonus feat.

Still Spell: At 8th level, a scaled horror gains Still Spell as

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Scaled horrors are

a bonus feat.

SAMPLE SCALED HORROR

This example uses a lizardfolk, Saebeohrt Rippling Death,

who took enough levels of fighter to qualify for scaled

horror. Saebeohrt terrorizes the borders of his community,

viciously attacking intruders and even those just passing

too close. Occasionally he leads raids on nearby communi-

ties to remind them just how dangerous lizardfolk can be.

He considers raids on human

settlements to be hunting

expeditions.

Leaders in his

community are

beginning to fear

being  usurped  by

him, but Saebe-

ohrt realizes that

a  leader  must

think about more

than just inflict-

ing pain and suf-

fering on living

creatures, and as

such he has no

desire for politi-

cal power.

SIREN

Some harpies hone

their mind-affecting

songs to add new

effects. A harpy

siren is an artist

who constantly

seeks to expand

and improve upon

her innate sonic

ability.

Any creature

with a mind-affect-

ing sonic ability

could take this

prestige class, but

few other than

harpies are intel-

ligent enough.

Cloakers

sometimes

hone their al-

ready impressive

sonic abilities.

A rare gibbering

mouther or yeth

hound may follow

this path, but only excep-

tional individuals.

Sirens can be problematic in a party, since their sonic abil-

ities  are  often  indiscriminate.  With  increasing  expertise,

however,  they  can  focus  their  talents  to  become  excellent

support for combat specialists, softening up opposition for

killing strokes.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a siren, a character must fulfill all the

following criteria.

Skills: Bluff 6 ranks, Intimidate 6 ranks, Perform 8 ranks

(includes either ballad, buffoonery, chant, epic, limericks,

melody, ode, or storytelling).

Special: Must possess an innate sonic, mind-affecting

ability.

CLASS SKILLS

The sirens class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff (Cha), Craft (any) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather

Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Perform

(Cha), Profession (any) (Wis), Search (Int), and Sense

Motive (Wis).

al effects. Once per day, she can overlay a despair effect on

her sonic attack identical to that of an emotion spell. Those

affected  by  the  sonic  attack  make  their  saving  throws  for

that attack before resolving the despair effect. The Will save

DC to resist this effect is 12 + the sirens level + the sirens

Cha  modifier.  The  despair  effect  lasts  1  round  per  siren

class level.

Charisma Bonus (Ex): At 3rd level, a siren gains a +2 in-

herent bonus to her Charisma score. This bonus rises to +4

at 6th level and to +5 at 8th level.

Skill Points at

Each Level: 4 +

Song of

(Su): At  4th

level, a siren

gains a new sonic

ability.  Once  per

her sonic attack. This is iden-

tical to the effect of a phantas-

tures  within  range  of  the

sirens sonic attack, and has

instantaneous  duration.

The  Will  and  Forti-

Song of Idiocy (Su): At 5th level, a

siren gains a new sonic ability. Once per day

lay an Intelligence-damaging effect on her

sonic attack. This is identical to the effect

of a feeblemind spell, affects all crea-

tures within range of the sirens sonic attack, and has instan-

taneous duration. The Will save to resist this effect has a DC

of 12 + the sirens level + the sirens Cha modifier, and arcane

spellcasters and creatures that use arcane spell-like abilities

take a 4 penalty on their saves.

can overlay a level-draining effect on her sonic attack. This

is identical to the effect of an enervation spell, except that all

creatures within range of the sirens sonic attack are entitled

to a Fortitude save to resist the effect, and it has instanta-

neous duration. The Fortitude save to resist this effect, and

to remove the negative levels, has a DC of 12 + the sirens

level + the sirens Cha modifier.

Song of Stone (Su): At 9th level, a siren gains a new sonic

ability. Once per day per level in this prestige class, she can

overlay a flesh to stone effect on her sonic attack. This is iden-

tical to the spell, affects all creatures within range of the

sirens sonic attack, and has instantaneous duration. The For-

titude save to resist this effect has a DC of 12 + the sirens

level + the sirens Cha modifier.

Song of Death (Su): At 10th level, a sirens sonic attack

reaches its zenith. Once per day, she can overlay a power

word, kill effect on her sonic attack. This is identical to the

spell cast as an area spell and has instantaneous duration.

SAMPLE SIREN

Melantha Akanthapoula always loved to sing. Even when

there was no prey to hear, she sang. A passing band of adven-

turers included a bard, and she became fascinated by bardic

song. The idea that a creature could modify its song to pro-

duce specific effects intrigued her, and led her to become a

siren. She seeks out performers to compete with them in

singing contests. She prefers her competitions with bards to

have a little more spice, so she usually tries to captivate them

or their companions and overlays her song of despair to fur-

ther hinder their saving throws.

Melantha Akanthapoula: Female harpy Siren 2; CR 6;

Medium-size monstrous humanoid; HD 7d8 plus 2d4; hp

36; Init +3; Spd 20 ft., fly 80 ft. (average); AC 20, touch 15,

flat-footed 17; Atk +8 melee (1d3, 2 claws), or +9/+4 melee

(1d6+1, +1 club); Face/Reach 5 ft./5 ft.; SA captivating song,

song of despair; SQ darkvision 60 ft.; AL CE; SV Fort +1, Ref

+9, Will +9; Str 10, Dex 16, Con 10, Int 12, Wis 10, Cha 16.

Skills and Feats: Bluff +9, Intimidate +9, Listen +4, Per-

form +14, Spot +4; Dodge, Flyby Attack, Persuasive, Rever-

beration.

Feats: Saving throw DCs below already include the bonus

for Reverberation.

Captivating Song (Su): Melanthas most insidious ability

is her song. When she sings, all creatures (other than

harpies) within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a Will

save (DC 15 + her Cha modifier, including any benefit from

her potions of Charisma) or become utterly captivated. This is

a sonic, mind-affecting charm effect. If the save is success-

ful, that creature cannot be affected again by Melanthas

song for one day.

A captivated victim walks toward Melantha, taking the

most direct route available. If the path leads into a danger-

ous area such as through flame or off a cliff, that creature

gets a second saving throw. Captivated creatures can take no

actions other than to defend themselves. (Thus, a fighter

cannot run away or attack but takes no defensive penalties.)

A victim within 5 feet of Melantha stands there and offers

no resistance to her attacks. The effect continues for as long

as she sings. A bards countersong ability allows the capti-

vated creature to attempt a new Will save.

Song of Despair (Su): Once per day, Melantha can over-

lay a despair effect on her sonic attack identical to that of an

emotion spell. Those affected by the sonic attack make their

saving throws for that attack before resolving the despair

effect. The Will save DC to resist this effect is 14 + her

Charisma modifier, including any benefit from her potions of

Charisma. The despair effect lasts 2 rounds.

Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2, bracers of armor +2,

cloak of resistance +2, ring of protection +2, +1 club, 2 potions of

Charisma, 100 gp.

SLAAD BROODER

Slaadi are chaos personifiedno two are exactly identical.

Only a few of the baser sorts live long enough to advance to

the rank of gray slaad or death slaad, but the slaad brooder is

another path of development. The brooders sole purpose is

to implant as many egg pellets as he can to produce the

widest possible range of progeny.

Only red slaadi can naturally implant egg pellets, but they

are the most common and the most widespread of their ilk.

Those not gifted with the ability may acquire it by taking

this prestige class. A superior brooder can aspire to a rank of

great respect in slaad society, second only to gray slaadi in

power. The path, though, is one whose end few survive to

attain.

Slaadi dont get along well with one another, let alone

with nonslaadi. Slaad brooders are always loners, roving

through Limbo and traveling to other planes to establish

rookeries.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a slaad brooder, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Race: Any slaad.

Alignment: Any chaotic.

Skills: Concentration 10 ranks.

Feats: Great Fortitude, Improved Multiattack.

CLASS SKILLS

The slaad brooders class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Hide (Dex),

Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Search (Int),

and Spot (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the slaad brooder

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A slaad brooder nei-

ther gains nor loses proficiency with any weapons, armor, or

shields by gaining levels in this class.

Implant (Ex): A slaad brooder gains the ability to implant

pellets with any of his natural attacks. If he previously had a

similar ability (red slaads implant ability or blue slaads dis-

ease ability), he can now use that ability with any of his nat-

ural attacks. The affected creature must succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 10 + slaad brooders character level + slaad

brooders Con modifier) to avoid implantation. The egg ges-

tates for one week before hatching into a slaad that eats his

way out, killing the host. Twenty-four hours before the egg

fully matures, the host falls extremely ill (10 to all ability

scores). A remove disease spell rids a host of the pellet, as does

a successful Heal check (DC 20). If the check fails, the

healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not)

deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.

If the brooder is a blue slaad, the pellet hatches into a red

slaad. If the brooder is a red slaad, the pellet hatches into a

blue slaad. If the host is an arcane spellcaster, the egg pellet

instead hatches into a green slaad.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a slaad brooder hits with one or

more claw or rake attacks, it deals normal damage and

attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking

an attack of opportunity. The ability works only against

opponents of the same size or smaller. The slaad brooder has

the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its

natural weapons to hold the opponent. Each successful

grapple check it makes during successive rounds automati-

cally deals bite damage.

Imbue Pellet (Su): At 2nd level, a slaad brooder imbues a

single egg pellet with an additional feature randomly deter-

mined from the options described below (roll d4 and apply

the appropriate feature). This feature affects the host as indi-

cated. Where a save is permitted, the DC is equal to 10 +

slaad brooders character level + slaad brooders Con modi-

fier. Roll separately for each implant attack.

1. Burn: The pellet deals 1d6 points of heat damage to the

host on the round of implantation. A successful Fortitude

save halves the damage. The pellet deals an additional 1d6

points of heat damage on the next round unless the host

makes a successful Fortitude save.

2. Caustic: As the burn feature, except that the damage is

acid damage.

3. Chill: As the burn feature, except that the damage is

cold damage.

4. Shock: As the burn feature, except that the damage is

electricity damage.

Deep Implant (Ex): At 3rd level, a slaad brooder can

implant his pellet more deeply within the hosts body,

adding +2 to the DC of the Fortitude save to resist implanta-

tion. In addition, repeated Heal checks after the first to

remove the pellet deal 1d6 points of damage to the patient

instead of the usual 1d4 points, as the healer must cut more

deeply into the hosts body.

Rapid Hatching (Ex): On reaching 4th level, a slaad

brooder gains the ability to transfer some of his own vitality

into the egg pellet, allowing it to mature more quickly. The

egg hatches in 24 hours instead of 1 week. Six hours before

it hatches, the host comes down with the severe illness,

losing 10 points from each ability score.

Chaos Focus (Su): At 5th level, a slaad brooders imbue

pellet ability becomes more potent: The DC to halve or

negate the damage from the additional feature of the pellet

(burn, caustic, chill, or shock) increases by +2.

Multiple Implant (Ex): At 6th level, a slaad brooder can

implant more than one pellet within the hosts body. Each of

his natural attacks that hits can implant an egg pellet.

Color Choice (Ex): At 7th level, a slaad brooder can

choose the color of his spawn. He can produce a green slaad

even if the host creature is not an arcane spellcaster. He can

determine  the  color  of  each  pellets  spawn  if  he  has

implanted more than one in the same host.

Heighten Chaos (Su): At 8th level, the DC to halve or

negate the damage from the additional feature of an egg

pellet increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus pro-

vided by the chaos focus ability.

Corporeal Instability (Su): On reaching 9th level, a

slaad brooder can effect a terrible transformation on the

host creature. Unless she makes a successful Fortitude save

(DC 10 + slaad brooders level + Slaad brooders Con modi-

fier), the hosts shape melts into a formless mass. She cannot

hold or use any item, nor can she wear clothing or armor.

Her  speed  drops  to  10  feet  or  one-quarter  normal,

whichever is lower. She can no longer cast spells or use

magic items, and she cannot distinguish between friend and

foe, attacking blindly (4 penalty on attack rolls, 50% miss

chance).

For each round the host spends in an amorphous state,

she takes 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain from mental

shock. If the creatures Wisdom score falls to 0, she becomes

catatonic and unresponsive. A creature can regain her own

shape for 1 minute with a successful Charisma check (DC

15). On a failure, the creature can still repeat the check each

round until successful.

A shapechange or stoneskin spell fixes the affected creatures

form for the duration of the spell, although it does not cure

the affliction. The corporeal instability can be removed with

a restoration, greater restoration, or heal spell; a separate restora-

tion spell is required to restore Wisdom drain.

Death Spawn (Ex): At 9th level, a slaad brooders extraor-

dinary vitality gives his egg pellets the ability to hatch even

from a host that has died (the death of a host becomes an

increasingly likely event as a brooder

becomes  more  powerful).  Neither

remove disease spells nor Heal checks can

destroy the pellets growing in a dead

host, but destruction of the body by

fire, acid, disintegrate spells, and the

like will do so.

Dominate  Spawn ( Sp ) : On

reaching 10th level, the slaad

brooder becomes the undis-

puted master of spawn. If he is

present at the hatching of a red,

blue,  or  green  slaad,  he  can

take control of the newborn

as with a dominate monster

spell. The effect lasts one

day  per  slaad  brooders

c h a r a c t e r   l e v e l .   T he

hatchling can resist the

effect  with  a  successful

Will  save  (DC  10  +  slaad

brooders  level  +  slaad  brooders

Con modifier).

A slaad brooder that has reached this

level of power is a threat to the domi-

nance  of  death  slaadi,  who  are  his

implacable enemies.

SAMPLE SLAAD BROODER

In his isolated lair, Frode the Gory

broods. He has no desire to implant

other  creatures.  That  would  only

create more of the hated blue slaadi.

Frode has bigger dreams. Venturing

out of his caves to create chaos from

simple pranks to catastrophic disasters,

Frode desires the ultimate ability of a

slaad brooder: To be able to control the

results of his implantation, and domi-

nate his spawn. With an army at his

claws, Frode can truly cause chaos,

and no other slaad could ever

torment him again.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  If  Frode  hits  with  his  claws,  he

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action  without  provoking  an  attack  of  opportunity.  Im-

proved  grab  works  only  against  Medium-size  and  smaller

opponents. Frode has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally,  or  simply  use  his  claws  to  hold  the  opponent.  Each

successful  grapple  check  he  makes  during  successive

rounds automatically deals 2d8+4 points of damage as Frode

bites his captive.

Resistances (Ex): All slaadi have acid, cold, electricity,

fire, and sonic resistance 5.

Pounce (Ex): If Frode leaps upon a foe during the first

round of combat, he can make a full attack even if he has

already taken a move action.

Implant (Ex): When Frode hits with either his bite

attack or either of his claw attacks, he can inject an egg

pellet into the opponents body. The affected creature must

succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 13 + Frodes Con modifier,

including any benefit from a potion of endurance) to avoid

implantation. Often Frode implants an unconscious or oth-

erwise helpless creature (which gets no saving throw). The

egg gestates for one week before hatching into a blue slaad

that eats its way out, killing the host. Twenty-four hours

before the egg fully matures, the victim falls extremely ill

(10 to all ability scores). A remove disease spell rids a victim

of the pellet, as does a successful Heal check (DC 20). If the

check fails, the healer can try again, but each attempt (suc-

cessful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient.

If the host is an arcane spellcaster, the egg pellet instead

hatches into a green slaad.

Stunning Croak (Su): Once per day Frode can emit a loud

croak. Every creature within 20 feet must succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 13 + Frodes Con modifier, including any bene-

fit from a potion of endurance) or be stunned for 1d3 rounds.

Summon Slaad (Sp): Once per day Frode can attempt to

summon another red slaad with a 40% chance of success.

Possessions: amulet of natural armor +3, cloak of resistance +3,

ring of protection +3, +3 mithral shirt, Huge +1 chaotic shortspear,

3 potions of endurance, eyes of the eagle, 197 gp.

SURVIVOR

During their adventuring career, heroesespecially mon-

ster heroesmay find themselves the victims of mental

domination, spells, and special attacks. Monster characters

may prove especially vulnerable to magical attacks, given

that their saving throws often lag significantly behind those

of standard-race characters. For this reason, more than a few

heroes set up training programs and academies where a

character willingly undergoes a program of pain and tor-

ture. The students are subjected to frequent assaults to their

bodies with cunning traps that challenge agility, psionic tor-

ment through mind-affecting spells and hired nonhu-

manoids, frequent draining attacks by controlled undead,

and steady doses of weak poisons. Those who survive the

program emerge a few weeks latertougher, faster, and less

vulnerable to attacks.

A survivors past may lie in any class, as may his future. All

that is required is mental and physical focus.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a survivor, a character must fulfill all

the following criteria.

Base Save Bonus: Highest base save bonus must be

lower than character level.

Special: The path of the survivor requires a concentrated

month of study to enter the prestige class. During this

month, the character must stay in one place and spend all

his waking hours in study, practice, and meditation.

CLASS SKILLS

The survivor can spend his skill points to purchase any

skills that any of his previous classes (or his base monster

race) have made available as a class skill (though not exclu-

sive skills), or any skill that is eligible as a cross-class skill.

The survivor prestige class does not add new skills to a char-

acters list of class skills.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the survivor prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A survivor neither

gains nor loses proficiency with any weapon, armor, or

shields by gaining levels in this class.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A survivor gains the ability to

react to danger before his senses would normally allow him

to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if

any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an

invisible attacker (he still loses his Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class if immobilized).

At 3rd level, the survivor can no longer be flanked; he can

react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he

can react to a single attacker. This defense denies rogues the

ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the survivor. The

exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels

higher than the survivor can flank him (and thus sneak

attack him).

Evasion (Ex): At 2nd level, a survivor gains evasion. If

exposed to any effect that normally allows a character to

attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage (such as a

fireball), he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Evasion can only be used if the survivor wears light armor or

no armor.

Improved Evasion (Ex): This ability, gained at 4th level,

works like evasion, except that while the survivor still takes

no damage on a successful Reflex save against spells such as

Special

Uncanny dodge (Dex bonus to AC)

Evasion

Uncanny dodge (cant be flanked)

Improved evasion

Damage reduction 5/

fireball or a breath weapon, he now takes only half damage

on a failed save. The survivors training allows him to get out

of harms way with incredible speed.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 5th level, a survivor gains

the ability to shrug off 5 points of damage from each blow or

attack. Subtract 5 from the damage the survivor takes

each time he is dealt damage. Damage reduction

can reduce damage to 0 but not less than 0. This

damage reduction stacks with any other

damage reduction of the x/ type (such

as the damage reduction that is a class

feature of the barbarian).

SYBIL

Steeped in ancient lore, or maddened by divine inspiration,

the sybil is a reclusive prophet. Questers make the difficult

journey  to  a  sybils  remote  and  hidden  lair  to  ask  for  a

glimpse of the future.

SAMPLE SURVIVOR

Dench  the  Bull  was  a  mercenary

soldier and part-time adventurer

until yuan-ti captured him. Soon,

a band of adventurers combated

his  captors  and  defeated  them.

Disturbed  by  his  close  call

with  Merrshaulk-worshiping

cultists,  Dench  vowed never

again  to  let  himself  be  at  an-

others  mercy.  After  a  month

of  study  and  training,  he  un-

dertook to adventure and gain

skill as a survivor and returned

to  his  life  as  a  mercenary

tougher than ever.

Light  Sensitivity  (Ex):  Dench  is  sensitive  to  light  and

takes  a  1  circumstance  penalty  on  attack  rolls  in  bright

sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally al-

lows Dench to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half dam-

age (such as a fireball), he takes no damage with a successful

saving throw. Evasion can only be used if Dench wears light

armor or no armor.

Possessions:  +1  falchion, mithral  shirt, cloak  of  resistance  +1,

eyes of the eagle, 110 gp.

A  sybil  is  exception-

ally  talented  in  divination,

not through arcane study or devoted service to

a  deity,  but  through  a  mystical  focus  that  bor-

ders on insanity. The traditional exemplar is the sphinx with

its famous riddle, but any being with the innate talent for

prognostication might follow this path. Some fey, celestials,

and even devils become sybils; these last do so largely to tor-

ment and mislead mortals.

The sybil is by her very nature solitary. Such beings rarely

if ever leave their lairs, although a mysterious purpose may

send  one  in  search  of  lost  knowledge.  In  these  rare  in-

stances, sybils might form temporary alliances to meet the

immediate objective.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a sybil, a character must fulfill all the

following criteria.

Alignment: Neutral.

Skills: Concentration 10 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 8

ranks, Sense Motive 8 ranks.

Feats: Empower Spell-Like Ability.

Special: Must have an innate spell-like divination ability.

CLASS SKILLS

The sybils class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Concentration (Con), Craft (any) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha),

Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (arcana)

(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession

(any) (Wis), Scry (exclusive skill, Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sybil prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A sybil neither gains

nor loses proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields by

gaining levels in this class.

Divine Insight (Su): A sybil is able to touch the essence

of reality, albeit in a mind-bending way. She gains an

insight score equal to her level in this prestige class that

has three effects.

1. Add the insight score to Wisdom when determining

bonus spells or save DCs when casting divine spells or using

divine spell-like abilities.

2. Subtract this score from her Wisdom score when

making  any  other  checks  or  saving  throws  involving

Wisdom alone.

3. Once per day, the sybil can add her insight score to

Wisdom when making a check or save. She must choose to

use this power before making the roll.

Reclusive Insight (Su): At 2nd level, a sybil learns to

focus inwardly and discern hidden truths. By spending 24

hours in complete solitude, she gains two additional effects

of her insight score for the next 24 hours.

1. This score is added to her Intelligence score when

making any checks that depend on Intelligence, such as

Scry or bardic knowledge.

2. This score is subtracted from Intelligence to determine

bonus spells or save DCs when casting arcane spells or using

arcane spell-like abilities.

Riddle (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a sybil gains the gift of

prophecy and can see more clearly as she increases in expe-

rience. However, the truths she sees are couched in mystery.

These revelations are always accurate and carry no cost in

experience points or material components, but demand a

price be paidanswer the sybils riddle. A correct answer

earns the questioner the benefit of the specified divination

spell, with no chance of failure. An incorrect answer, how-

ever, carries a penalty, which is more severe the more diffi-

cult the riddle becomes.

Conundrum: At 3rd level, a sybil begins to express her gift

of prophecy. The riddle is a simple one. A correct answer

earns the benefit of an augury spell, with no chance of failure.

An incorrect answer causes the questioner to take 1 point of

temporary damage to an ability score of the sybils choice.

The sybil can use this ability once per day per class level.

Mystery: At 5th level, a sybils prophecy becomes more pre-

cise. The riddle is moderately challenging. A correct answer

earns the benefit of a divination spell, with no chance of failure.

An incorrect answer causes the questioner to take 2 points of

temporary damage to an ability score of the sybils choice. The

sybil can use this ability once per day per class level.

Koan: At 7th level, a sybils prophecy is uncanny. The

riddle is challenging. A correct answer earns the benefit of a

commune spell as cast by a cleric of the sybils character level

(the sybil contacts a powerful extraplanar being of like

philosophical bent). An incorrect answer causes the ques-

tioner to take 2 points of temporary damage to each ability

score. The sybil can use this ability once per day per two

class levels (round down).

Enigma: At 8th level, a sybil can supplement prophecy

with preternatural knowledge. The riddle is difficult. A cor-

rect answer earns the benefit of a legend lore spell, but it

requires only 1d410 rounds to gain an answer about a

person or item at hand. Detailed information about a

person, place, or thing requires 1d410 minutes to retrieve,

while rumors require 1d10 days to garner details. An incor-

rect answer causes the questioner to take 2 points of tempo-

rary damage to each ability score, to a maximum of 8. Abil-

ity scores are not reduced below 1. The sybil can use this

ability no more than three times per week.

Apocrypha: At 10th level, a sybils preternatural clarity is

near infallible. The riddle is nearly impossible. A correct

answer earns the benefit of a discern location spell, but the sybil

need not have come into contact with the person or thing

sought. An incorrect answer bestows 2d6 negative levels on

the questioner. The sybil can use this ability once per week.

Lesser Geas (Sp): At 4th level, a sybil can use lesser geas once

per day as a divine spell cast by a cleric of her class level

(include any cleric levels).

Mysterious Lore (Ex): At 4th level, a sybil gains access

to a special lore check much like that of bards and lore-

masters, but she is restricted in how it can use this ability.

She adds her insight score (see Divine Insight, above) to

the die roll, which stacks with any levels in bard or lore-

master, but on a failure she loses the benefit of her reclu-

sive insight ability until she can spend another 24 hours in

solitude.

Geas/Quest (Sp): At 6th level, a sybil can use geas/quest

once per day as a divine spell cast by a cleric of her class level

(include any cleric levels).

HANDLING RIDDLES

One of the most difficult tasks in roleplaying, whether as DM

or player, is using riddles effectively. Too often, a riddle is either

childishly easyor worse, a hoary clichor so obscure as to

be  incomprehensible  to  any  but  the  creator.  Here  are  some

ideas on how to present effective, challenging riddles that are

appropriate to the situations difficulty.

Look  to  examples  from  myth,  folklore,  and  even  popular

entertainment. (Dont forget the challenge of the Keeper at the

Bridge of Death in Monty Python and the Holy Grail!)

The sphinxs riddle is well known and therefore unsuitable,

but consider lesser known sources, such as pronouncements

by the Oracle of Delphi. An example is the Oracles answer to

the  Athenians  who  came  seeking  advice  against  the  Persian

conqueror  Xerxes:  The  wooden  wall  will  save  you  and  your

children.  The  statement  is  ambiguous,  but  the  solution

Athens came up withbuilding a fleet that ultimately turned

the  Persians  backfulfilled  one  interpretation  of  it.  A  riddle

need  not  have  only  one  answer,  and  the  way  it  is  interpreted

can be the foundation for adventure.

In the divination spell, the Players Handbook contains useful

advice on prophecy that can help you cast a riddle or oracular

pronouncement  in  an  appropriate  way.  The  Defenders  of  the

Faith class book for clerics and paladins supplements this, and

can be helpful (if you have the book).

Fairy tales are a wonderful source of inspiration for riddles

and prophecies. Often the hero is required to answer a ques-

tion or solve a mystery, which makes a great adventure theme

to place in the mouth of a sybil. You can find numerous folktale

resources  on  the  Web,  including  many  non-European  tales

(which  are  likely  to  be  less  well  known  to  American  or

European  players).  Riddles  are  often  a  topic  of  interest  for

mathematicians;

the  works  of  Douglas

Hofstaedter  (Gdel,  Escher,  Bach:  An  Eternal  Golden  Braid),

Lewis  Carroll  (The  Universe  in  a  Handkerchief),  and  Martin

Gardner (various) contain many useful conundrums.

for  example,

Finally,  collections  of  riddles  and  puzzles  (often  aimed  at

children,  but  not  necessarily)  are  available  in  bookstores,

online,  and  in  libraries.  They  are  a  good  place  to  start  when

constructing  a  riddle  of  your  own,  and  a  great  source  of

simpler questions.

Examples of Riddle Types

Conundrum: This is an easy riddle, and a chestnut can do

well  here.  For  example,  this  is  a  traditional  Haitian  riddle:

They serve it food, it stands on four feet, but it cant eat. The

answer: a table. This riddle could be used to drop a hint to the

party about an altar.

riddles told to Bilbo by Gollum in J.R.R. Tolkeins The Hobbit is:

What has roots as nobody sees,/ Is taller than trees,/ Up, up

it goes,/ And yet never grows? The answer: a mountain. This

might lead a party to a lost dwarven city or a dragons lair.

Koan: Now things are getting tricky. The best source for inspi-

ration for this riddle type, not surprisingly, is a collection of Zen

fables or real-life koans. As an example: Draw a line and tell the

questioner to make the line shorter without touching any part

of  it.  (The  usual  answer  is  to  draw  a  second,  longer  line.)  A

lateral thinking puzzle works just as well, though, such as this

classic: A woman has a brother who was born at the same time

on the same day in the same year. Yet they are not twins. How

is this possible? Answer: They are two of a set of triplets. These

puzzles should ideally force the listener to think in an unaccus-

tomed way and can help present an offbeat sort of adventure.

Enigma: Such posers ought to be very difficult to answer, and

a good one requires some thought and research. Philosophical

and religious riddles are good models for enigmas, since they

are intended to lead the solver to a higher awareness. Here is

a Mongol example, which refers to particular stars in the sky

and might hint at a cross-planar expedition. (In this case you

would probably replace the specific real-world references with

equivalents found in the game world.)

Behind the Altai and Khangai Mountains

There are a hundred thousand horses, they say.

There is a group of seven loners, they say.

There is a group of six which flock together, they say.

There is a group of three which form a file, they say.

There are two which set black and white apart, they say.

There is one left behind, they say.

(The hundred thousand is a reference to all the stars in the

sky. The seven loners are the stars that make up the constel-

lation  Ursa  Major,  or  the  Big  Dipper.  The  number  of  stars  is

reduced in each line of the riddle. The one left behind is the

North Star, which can be found in the night sky by extending

Apocrypha: A  nearly  impossible  riddle  is  even  trickier  to

construct than to solve! One way around the problem is to pre-

sent  a  riddle  that  is  no  riddle  at  all,  such  as  Bilbos  famous

stumper  to  Gollum  in  The  Hobbit: What  have  I  got  in  my

pocket?  By  all  standards,  Bilbo  cheatedbut  Gollum

accepted the question and tried to answer, thereby validating

the  challenge.  Similarly,  the  challenge  of  Rumplestiltskin  to

name him is virtually impossible, perhaps not really a riddle at

allbut  with  immense  reward.  If  you  dont  feel  like  breaking

the  rules,  try  referring  to  unusual  items  or  an  unfamiliar

culture, perhaps adapting a real-world riddle to subjects found

in the game world. This is a great way to begin a search for an

artifact or a piece of ancient, lost loresomething to build a

whole campaign around.

Mystery: A  somewhat  more  difficult  form,  examples  of

mysteries  can  be  found  in  folklore  and  literature.  One  of  the

Limited Wish (Sp): At 9th level, a sybil can use limited wish

once per year as a divine spell cast by a cleric of its class level

(include any cleric levels).

SAMPLE SYBIL

Xanaphia Nalo is an oracle living in an isolat-

ed mountain cave. The privileged few who

know of her speak in hushed, fearful tones

of her insight. While her advice is valu-

able, she is quite mad and often speaks

of unimaginable horrors witnessed in

her

journeys  across  the  planes.

Whether  she  saw  the  terrors  in  per-

son or through her magic, she never

says.  She  charges  only  enough  for

her to survive, and she needs little in

her hermitage.

When  Xanathia  went  mad,  her  align-

ment changed from chaotic good to neu-

tral.  (Coincidentally,  this  change  al-

lowed her to qualify for the sybil pres-

tige class.)

Spells: A lillend casts arcane spells as a 6th-level

bard.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daydarkness, hallucinatory

terrain, knock, light; 1/daycharm person, speak with ani-

mals, speak with plants. These abilities are as the spells cast by a

10th-level bard (save DC 14 + spell level).

Xanaphia also has the bardic music ability as a 6th-level

bard.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Xanaphia hits with her tail slap

attack, she deals normal damage and attempts to start a grap-

ple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportu-

nity.  Improved  grab  works  only  against  Medium-size  and

smaller opponents. Xanaphia has the option to conduct the

grapple  normally,  or  simply  use  her  tail  to  hold  the  oppo-

nent. If she gets a hold, she can constrict.

Constrict (Ex): Xanaphia deals 2d6+5 points of damage

with a successful grapple check against opponents of up to

Medium-size. This uses the entire lower portion of her body,

so  she  cannot  take  any  move  actions  when  constricting,

though she can still attack with her sword.

Fire Resistance (Ex): Xanaphia is immune to non-

magical fire and has magic fire resistance 20.

Outsider  Traits: Darkvision  60  ft.;  cannot  be

raised or resurrected (though a wish or miracle spell

can restore life).

Divine  Insight  (Su): Xanaphia  has  an  in-

sight score of 2 that has three effects:

1.  Add  the  insight  score  to  her  Wisdom

score when determining bonus spells or save

DCs  when  casting  divine  spells  or  using  di-

vine spell-like abilities.

2.  Subtract  this  score  from  her  Wisdom

score when making any other checks or sav-

ing throws involving Wisdom alone.

3. Once per day, Xanaphia can add her in-

sight score to Wisdom when making a check

or save. She must choose to use this power be-

fore making the roll.

Reclusive  Insight  (Su): Xanaphia

can  focus  inwardly  and  discern  hid-

den truths. By spending 24 hours in

complete solitude, she gains two ad-

ditional effects of her insight score

for the next 24 hours.

1. This score is added to her Intelli-

gence  score  when  making  any  checks,

such  as  Scry  or  bardic  knowledge

checks, which depend on Intelligence.

2. This score is subtracted from Intelli-

gence to determine bonus spells or save DCs

when  casting  arcane  spells  or  using  arcane

spell-like abilities.

Skills: Xanaphia  receives  a  +4  racial

bonus on Survival checks.

Bard Spells Known (6/5/4; save DC 14 +

WAVERIDER

Undersea  folk  have  their  own  champions,  experts  at

mounted combat from the backs of allied sea creatures. The

waverider and her companion animal defend their city with

a vigor that exceeds eithers individual powers.

Waveriders are often merfolk or tritons who enter mili-

tary service to defend their communities. Occasionally

A hippocampus is a thoroughbred steed for aquatic riders. It

is  prized  as  an  underwater  mount  and  gladly  serves  good

causes.

A hippocampus looks like a horse gone native underwater

with coloration ranging from black to aquamarine. The front

half resembles a horse with short hair, except that fins replace

hooves and mane. The hindquarters are those of a great fish,

with scales and a muscular tail fanning out into a large fin.

Hippocampi do not get bored or restless as long as they stay

moving  and  have  a  challenge  or  competition.  Winning  does

not  seem  to  be  the  most  important  part  of  a  race  or  test  for

hippocampi; simply striving is their joy. Marathon relay races

and  long-distance  scavenger  hunts  are  favorite  forms  of

competition.

While  they  do  not  take  naturally  to  domesticated  life,

hippocampi can be convinced that living among an underwater

civilization is a good idea. Even domesticated, a hippocampus

tries  to  make  a  contest  out  of  everyday  tasks.  If  another

hippocampus  is  nearby  to  challenge,  so  much  the  better.

Hippocampus trainers try to discourage this behavior, because

hippocampi can become quite reckless in the heat of a race.

Hippocampi speak Aquan.

Combat

Hippocampi bash foes with their muscular tails, then attempt

a nasty bite before the opponent can recover. A wild hippocam-

pus will generally retreat rather than fight on if it takes signifi-

cant damage, unless its foals are at risk, in which case it will

fight to the death.

Training a Hippocampus

Training  a  hippocampus  as  a  mount  requires  a  successful

Handle Animal check (DC 22 foal, DC 29 adult). Hippocampus

foals  are  worth  2,500  gp  on  the  open  market.  Professional

trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus. Riding

a trained hippocampus requires an exotic saddle. A hippocam-

pus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also

attack unless he or she succeeds at a Ride check.

Wild  hippocampi  race  through  open  water,  living  wild  and

free. Though fairly intelligent, they are simple creatures. They

enjoy  races  and  displays  of  strength  and  endurance.

CLASS SKILLS

The waveriders class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate

(Cha), Jump (Str), Profession (any) (Wis), and Ride (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level:

2 + Int modifier.

Breach (Ex): On reaching 3rd level, a mounted waverider

can make a leaping charge to attack opponents out of the

water. The mount makes a Jump check using its own ranks

in the skill or the waveriders, whichever is better, to make a

running high jump as part of a charge, with a maximum

height distance of twice its length. If it contacts an oppo-

nent during the jump, the waverider gains the normal +2

bonus on her attack roll. At the end of the jump, waverider

and mount are once again submerged and thus do not take

the 2 penalty to Armor Class against

opponents  out  of  the  water  (those

underwater are still able to take advantage

of the waveriders being temporarily off bal-

ance). A waverider cannot use this ability in two

consecutive rounds.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the waverider pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Waveriders are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of

armor, and with shields.

Waverider Mount: A waverider can call a special aquatic

mount to serve her. This may be a hippocampus (see sidebar),

sea lion, shark, porpoise, elasmosaurus, or whale. This crea-

ture is stronger and more intelligent than others of its type. A

waverider may have only one mount at a time. If the mount

is slain, the waverider can call another one after a year and a

day. See the Waverider Mount sidebar for more information.

Mounted Weapon Bonus (Ex): At each level, a wave-

rider gains the indicated bonus on her attack roll with the

designated weapon while mounted.

Trident Charge (Ex): A waverider can use a trident to

deal double damage when used from the back of a charging

mount. The Spirited Charge feat can be used to increase the

damage multiple to triple normal.

Ride Bonus (Ex): At 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, a wave-

rider gains the indicated bonus on Ride checks.

whichever is better, to make a running long jump as part

of a charge, with a maximum distance of six times its length.

If  it  contacts  an  opponent  during  the  dive,  the  waverider

gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll and increases the damage

multiplier with her mounted weapon one more step (double

to triple, triple to quadruple) but takes a 4 penalty to Armor

Class for the next round. A waverider cannot use this ability

in two consecutive rounds.

Improved Mounted Archery (Ex): At 5th level, a wave-

rider is better able to use a crossbow, harpoon, javelin, tri-

dent, or shortspear while mounted. When making ranged

attacks with any of these weapons while mounted, she takes

only a 1 penalty on ranged attacks if the mount is making a

double move, and 2 if the mount is running.

Full Mounted Attack (Ex): At 6th level, a waverider may

attack as a standard action when its mount moves more than

5 feet rather than as a partial action.

Skim (Ex): On reaching 7th level, a mounted waverider

can make more effective charges against opponents out of

the water, skimming over the surface like a flying fish. The

mount makes a Jump check using its own ranks in the skill

or the waveriders, whichever is better, to make a running

long jump as part of a charge, with a maximum distance of

four times its length, and a running high jump with a max-

imum vertical distance of twice its length. (Use the same

roll to determine both height and length.) If it contacts an

opponent during the jump, the waverider gains the normal

+2 bonus on its attack roll. At the end of the jump, waverider

and mount are once again submerged and thus do not take

the 2 penalty to Armor Class against opponents out of the

water (those underwater are still able to take advantage of

the waveriders being temporarily off balance). A waverider

cannot use this ability in two consecutive rounds.

Superior Mounted Archery (Ex): At 8th level, a wave-

rider takes no penalties when making ranged attacks with a

crossbow, harpoon, javelin, trident, or shortspear while

mounted.

Wavedancing (Ex): On reaching 9th level, a mounted

waverider can maneuver very effectively out of the water.

Rider and mount can move up to four times the mounts

swim speed out of water and can make charges, including

Ride-By Attacks if the waverider has this feat (normal

charge rules apply). In addition, she can now use her breach,

sound, and skim abilities in consecutive rounds.

Call of the Deeps (Su): At 10th level, a waverider can

summon one or more water elementals once per day, as with

a planar ally spell.

SAMPLE WAVERIDER

Annamette Devisser considers herself a simple soldier. She

acknowledges that she is more dedicated than most, and

more skilled than some, but no more than that. Her family

has always hunted and herded fish, so she grew up riding

various aquatic animals. Her favorites were always sharks.

Her family thinks her status as a waverider brings honor to

everyone in the family. Swiftstriker, her mount, came from

the family stables.

WAVERIDER MOUNT

The waveriders mount differs from a standard creature of its

type  in  a  number  of  ways.  A  Medium-size  waverider  typically

rides  a  hippocampus,  sea  lion,  Large  shark,  killer  whale,  or

porpoise.  A  Tiny  or  Small  waverider  usually  chooses  a

Medium-size  shark,  while  a  Large  waverider  favors  an  elas-

mosaurus,  Huge  shark,  or  cachalot  whale.  This  mount  is  a

magical beast, not an animal. It has a number of special abili-

ties, as shown below.

Share  Spells: At  the  waveriders  option,  she  may  have  any

spell that she casts on herself (if she is a spellcaster) also affect

her mount. This also applies to spell-like abilities. The mount

must be within 5 feet. If the spell or spell-like ability has a dura-

tion  other  than  instantaneous,  the  spell  stops  affecting  the

mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect

the  mount  again  even  if  the  mount  returns  to  the  waverider

before  the  duration  expires.  Additionally,  the  waverider  may

cast a spell or use a spell-like ability with a target of You on

her mount instead of on herself. The waverider and her mount

can even share spells that normally do not affect creatures of

the mounts type (magical beast).

Empathic Link (Su): The waverider has an empathic link with

her mount out to a distance of 1 mile. The waverider cannot

see through the mounts eyes, but the two can communicate

telepathically. Even intelligent mounts see the world differently

from their riders, so misunderstandings are always possible.

Share Saving Throws: The mount uses its own base saves or

the waveriders, whichever is higher.

Character Level: The character level of the waverider.

Bonus Hit Dice: These are extra d8 Hit Dice, each of which

gains a Constitution modifier as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve

the mounts base attack and base save bonuses, as usual (see

the Monster Manual for rules on advancing magical beasts).

Speak  with  Creatures  of  Its  Kind  (Su): The  mount  can

communicate with aquatic animals or with creatures of approx-

imately the same kind. A whale or porpoise can speak with any

whale or porpoise, while a shark can speak with other fish, and

a frog can speak with amphibians.

Natural  Armor: This  is  an  increase  to  the  mounts  natural

Fast Movement (Ex): The mounts swim speed increases by

damage,  it  takes  no  damage  if  it  makes  a  successful  saving

pqqqqrs

Spell  Resistance  (Ex):  The  mount  gains  spell  resistance

equal  to  the  waveriders  class  level  +  5.  To  affect  the  mount

with  a  spell,  a  spellcaster  must  make  a  level  check  (1d20  +

caster level) at least equal to the mounts spell resistance.

YUAN-TI CULTIST

The deep jungles hold secret temples to the evil deities of

the yuan-ti. The mysteries of these deities are hidden to out-

siders, but the yuan-ti cultist masters their rituals to gain

personal power.

A yuan-ti cultist can enter the service of Merrshaulk, the

yuan-tis chief deity, upon reaching adulthood. After passing

the coming-of-age ritual, the prospective candidate enters

the temple warrens and rarely if ever leaves the complex

again. Ritual and rote learning fill his waking hours, and

The yuan-ti cultist is bound to his temple, but on very rare

occasions one might set out on a questgenerally to found

a new shrineaccompanied by large numbers of pureblood

yuan-ti.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a yuan-ti cultist, a character must fulfill

all the following criteria.

Race: Yuan-ti halfblood or abomination.

Alignment: Any evil.

Patron: Merrshaulk.

Skills: Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 10

ranks, Perform (chant) 1 rank.

Spells: Ability to cast 3rd-level divine spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The yuan-ti cultists class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (any) (Int), Diplomacy

(Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (architecture)

(Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (chant) (Wis),

Profession (any) (Wis), Scry (Int, exclusive skill), and Spell-

craft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the yuan-ti cultist

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A yuan-ti cultist is

proficient with all simple weapons and with shields. Other-

wise, a cultist neither gains nor loses any weapon, armor, or

shield proficiency by gaining levels in this class.

Spellcasting: A yuan-ti cultist continues training in

magic. Thus, when a new yuan-ti cultist level is gained, the

character gains new spells known and spells per day as if he

had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he

belonged to before he added the prestige class. He does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class

would have gained (improved chance of turning or rebuk-

ing undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on).

This essentially means that he adds the level of yuan-ti

cultist to the level of some other spellcasting class the char-

acter has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and

caster level accordingly.

Outer Circle: A yuan-ti cultist enters the service of Merr-

shaulk and learns some of the secrets of the cult. He gains a

+2  circumstance  bonus  on  Diplomacy  and  Intimidate

checks when dealing with yuan-ti not of the temple hierar-

chy and a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (religion)

checks dealing with the worship of Merrshaulk.

In  addition,  the  yuan-ti  cultist  learns

the  secret  of  brewing  the  dreadful  mix-

ture that transforms humans into tainted

ones  or  broodguards  (see  Yuan-Ti  in

Chapter  10:  Templates)  The  mixture

requires the venom of a halfblood

or  pureblood  yuan-ti  as  well  as

certain  herbs  and  roots  found

only  in  tropical  forests,  whose

raw materials cost is at least 50

gp. The  DC  to  craft  this  mixture  is

25; if the cultist has 5 or more ranks in Pro-

fession (herbalist), he gains a +2 synergy bonus

on this check.

Spit Poison: A yuan-ti cultist can spit his poi-

son (if he has a poison attack) in a 10-foot cone.

Suffering  Prestige  Domain: At  2nd  level,  a  yuan-ti

cultist gains access to the Suffering pres-

tige domain. This allows the cultist

access  to  a  third  domains

spells and immediately give

him  the  domains  granted

power,  as  set  out  in  the

accompanying sidebar.

Sticks to Snakes (Sp): At

2nd level, a yuan-ti cultist

gains  the  ability  to  transform  inert

pieces of wood, such as arrows, torches,

or  staffs,  into  snakes.  Once  per  day,  he

can  transform  1d4  sticks  +  1  per

class  level  (including  cleric

levels)  within  medium

range (100 feet + 10 feet/

level).  These  cannot  be  en-

chanted  items.  Unattended

items  get  no  saving  throw,

while  those  in  a  creatures  pos-

session get a Will save. Sticks of 2 feet or less in length be-

come Tiny  vipers;  those  longer  than  2  and  shorter  than  4

feet in length become Small snakes, while those longer than

4 and up to 6 feet long become Medium-size. Transforming

a Large weapon, such as a longspear, or sticks of a like size

into  a  Large  viper  counts  as  creating  two  snakes  for  each

such item. Items of Huge or larger size cannot be so trans-

formed. The effects duration is 2 rounds per class level.

Third  Circle:  At  3rd  level,  a  yuan-ti  cultist  advances  to

the  next  rank  in  service  to  Merrshaulk. The  circumstance

bonus  on  Diplomacy  and  Intimidate  checks  when  dealing

with other yuan-ti and on Knowledge (religion) checks rises

to +4.

Snake  Darts (Sp): On  ascending  to  3rd  level,  the  cultist

undergoes ritual tattooing of snakes on his forearms or (if

he does not possess arms) on legs, snakes, or tail as appro-

priate. Three times per day as a standard action, the cultist

can launch these tattoos against opponents within

medium  range  (100  feet  +  10  feet/level). The

snakes seek out their target(s) with unerring

accuracy,  hitting  automatically.  The  target

takes 2d6 points of damage from the impact

and  must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  sav-

ing  throw  (DC  10  +  yuan-ti  cultists

level + yuan-ti cultists Con modi-

fier)  as  the  snakes  venom

takes  effect.  Primary  and

secondary  damage  is  1d6

Constitution.

On  the  following

round  the  snakes  fly

back to the cultist. Be-

fore  the  spell  can  be

cast  again,  the  cultist

must  swallow  the

l i v i n g s n a k e s ,

which  causes  the

tattoos to reappear on

his arms. Swallowing the snakes is

a  standard  action  that  causes  the

cultist no harm.

Psionic  Focus  (Su):  At  4th  level,  a

yuan-ti  cultists  psionic  ability  becomes

more focused. He adds +2 to the DC for

all  saving  throws  against  his  innate

psionic powers.

Psionics: Chant of Pain (Sp):

At 4th level, a yuan-ti cultist

expands  his  inherent  psi-

onic  ability  and  learns  to

focus  it  on  the  cere-

monies of pain. At will

as  a  full-round  action,

he can dance and chant in a

sinuous sacrament to deal 3d6 points

of damage to one living creature within 60

feet.  A  successful  Will  save  (DC  10  +  yuan-ti

cultists  class  level  +  yuan-ti  cultists  Wis  modi-

fier)  halves  the  damage. This  ability  has  no  effect  on

beings  that  are  immune  to  mind-affecting  effects,  such  as

oozes and plants.

Second Circle: At 5th level, a yuan-ti cultist advances to

a  senior  rank  in  service  within  the  cult. The  circumstance

bonus  on  Diplomacy  and  Intimidate  checks  when  dealing

with other yuan-ti and on Knowledge (religion) checks rises

to +6.

In  addition,  if  the  cultist  is  a  halfblood,  he  undergoes  a

painful, night-long ritual that transforms him into a human-

headed  abomination  (abominations  form  the  leadership

within the temple hierarchy). If he is already an abomina-

tion but does not have a human head, this ceremony trans-

forms him into that form. This ceremony requires the par-

ticipation of at least six abominations of the Inner Circle.

Finally, at this level the cultist learns the secret of trans-

forming  a  tainted  one  into  a  pureblood  yuan-ti. This

involves brewing a more potent version of the infusion that

transforms humans into tainted ones (Craft [alchemy] DC

30, raw materials cost 100 gp). In addition, at least three

yuan-ti cultists of the Second Circle must preside over the

ceremony, which lasts 1 hour. If the creature does not

desire the transformation, he must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + yuan-ti cultists class level + yuan-ti cultists

Con modifier). On a failure, he lapses into a coma and dies

within 1 hour unless revived with a delay poison or neutralize

poison spell.

Greater Psionic Focus (Su): At 6th level, a yuan-ti cultist

further refines his psionic abilities. He adds +4 to the DC for

all saving throws against his innate psionic powers. This

overlaps (does not stack with) the bonus granted by the

psionic focus ability.

Psionics: Chant of Agony (Sp): At 6th level, a yuan-ti

cultist becomes a master of pain. Three times per day as a

full-round action, he can dance and chant to deal 9d6 points

of damage to one living creature within 60 feet. A successful

Will save (DC 10 + yuan-ti cultists class level + yuan-ti

cultists Wis modifier) halves the damage. This ability has no

effect on beings that are immune to mind-affecting effects,

such as oozes and plants.

First Circle: At 7th level, a yuan-ti cultist advances to

a more senior rank within the cult. The circumstance

bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when dealing

with other yuan-ti and on Knowledge (religion) checks

rises to +8.

In addition, the cultists poison becomes more virulent.

He gains Virulent Poison as a bonus feat.

Finally, at this rank the cultist learns the secret of trans-

forming a pureblood yuan-ti into a halfblood. This involves

brewing a more potent version of the infusion that trans-

forms humans into tainted ones (Craft [alchemy] DC 35,

raw materials cost 500 gp). In addition, at least three yuan-ti

cultists of the Inner Circle must preside over the ceremony,

which lasts 6 hours. If the creature does not desire the trans-

formation, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

yuan-ti cultists class level + yuan-ti cultists Con modifier).

On a failure, he lapses into a coma and dies in 1 hour unless

revived with a delay poison or neutralize poison spell.

Unhallow (Sp): At 7th level, a yuan-ti cultist gains the abil-

ity to use unhallow once per week as the spell cast by a cleric

of his class level (including cleric levels). He does not

require the normal material components to use this ability,

but he must still expend herbs, oils, and incense worth 500

gp per level of any spells tied to the unhallow area.

Command Reptiles (Su): At 8th level, a yuan-ti cultist is

able to mentally command all snakes and reptilian animals

within 30 feet at will. This resembles dominate animal cast by

a cleric of his class level (including cleric levels).

Psionics: Chant of Agony (Sp): At 8th level, a yuan-ti

cultist can perform a ritual of sacrifice to Merrshaulk. Once

per day as a full-round action, he can dance and chant to slay

one living creature within 60 feet. With a successful Will

save (DC 10 + yuan-ti cultists class level + yuan-ti cultists

Wis modifier), the creature instead takes 6d6 points of

damage. This  ability  has  no  effect  on  beings  that  are

immune to mind-affecting effects, such as oozes and plants.

Inner Circle: At 9th level, a yuan-ti cultist ascends to the

highest tier of mortal power within the cult. The circum-

stance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when

dealing with other yuan-ti and on Knowledge (religion)

checks rises to +10.

In addition, the cultists poison becomes even more dan-

gerous. He gains Deadly Poison as a bonus feat.

Finally, at this level the cultist learns the secret of trans-

forming a halfblood yuan-ti into an abomination. He must

join at least five other cultists of the Inner Circle to per-

form the day-long ceremony. One cultist casts polymorph

other on the creature to be transformed, while the others

chant and pray. The creature must receive six doses of the

tincture that transforms a pureblood into a halfblood, one

every 4 hours. If the creature does not desire the transfor-

mation, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + yuan-

ti cultists class level + yuan-ti cultists Con modifier). On a

failure, he dies instantly.

Unholy Aura (Su): At 9th level, a yuan-ti cultist can use

unholy aura once per day, as the spell cast by a cleric of his

class level (including cleric levels).

Voice of Merrshaulk: On reaching 10th level, a yuan-ti

cultist attains the pinnacle of his career, transcending his

mortal essence to become an emissary of Merrshaulk. His

type changes to outsider, but he can be raised from the dead

if willing. He gains spell resistance equal to 20 + his Wisdom

modifier.

In addition, the Voice of Merrshaulk gains the supernat-

ural ability to communicate telepathically with any other

creature within 100 feet that has a language. He can also

command other yuan-ti at will, as dominate monster cast as a

divine spell by a cleric of the cultists class level (including

cleric levels). This is a spell-like, mind-affecting compul-

sion effect.

SAMPLE YUAN-TI CULTIST

Through cleverness and guile, Shauganttha rose to a position

of power through capturing many orcs and humans in raids,

preparing for the yuan-ti village elders to transform them into

tainted ones. After his settlement of yuan-ti was raided by a

band of adventurers and dispersed, Shauganttha moved to a

large yuan-ti city located beneath a large human metropolis

and began advising a high priest in the temple of Merrshaulk.

any snake or yuan-ti, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet,

they move away. A subject can overcome the compulsion by

succeeding at another DC 17 Will save, but still suffers deep

anxiety. This causes a 4 reduction to Dexterity until the

effect wears off or the subject is no longer within 20 feet of

a snake or yuan-ti. This ability is otherwise similar to antipa-

thy as cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

Rebuke Undead (Su): Shauganttha can make undead

cower by channeling negative energy.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayanimal trance, cause fear,

deeper darkness, entangle, neutralize poison, suggestion, and poly-

morph other. These abilities are as the spells cast by an 8th-

level sorcerer (save DC 13 + spell level).

Sticks to Snakes (Sp): At 2nd level, Shauganttha gained the

spell-like ability to transform inert pieces of wood, such as

arrows, torches, or staffs, into snakes. Once per day, he can

transform 1d4 + 7 sticks within medium range (100 feet + 10

feet/level). These cannot be enchanted items. Unattended

items get no saving throw, while those in a creatures posses-

sion get a Will save. Sticks of 2 feet or less in length become

Tiny vipers; those between 2 and 4 feet in length become

Small snakes, while those 4 to 6 feet long become Medium-

size. Transforming Large weapons, such as longspears, or

sticks of a like size into Large vipers counts as creating two

snakes for each such item. Larger items cannot be so trans-

formed. The effects duration is 14 rounds.

Skills: *Yuan-ti using chameleon power receive a +8 cir-

Darkvision: Shauganttha can see in the dark as though

in normal daylight.

Constrict (Ex): The creature crushes the opponent, deal-

ing 1d6+7 points of bludgeoning damage, after making a

successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Shauganttha hits an opponent

that is at Medium-size or smaller with his bite, he deals

normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking an attack of opportunity (grapple

bonus +21). If he gets a hold, he can also constrict in the

same round. Thereafter, Shauganttha has the option to con-

duct the grapple normally, or simply use its bite to hold the

opponent ( 20 penalty to grapple check, but the Shaugant-

tha is not considered grappled). In either case, each success-

ful grapple check it makes during successive rounds auto-

matically deals bite and constrict damage.

Psionics (Sp): Shauganttha can produce the following

effects at will.

Detect Poison: As the spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer.

Alternate Form: Shauganttha can assume the form of a Tiny

to Large viper (see the Snake entry in the Monster Manual).

This ability is similar to a shapechange spell cast by a 19th-

level sorcerer but allows only viper forms. He uses the

vipers poison since he has no poison attack of his own.

Chameleon Power: Shauganttha can change the coloration

of himself and his equipment to match his surroundings.

Produce Acid: Shauganttha can exude acid from his body,

dealing 1d6 points of damage to anything he touches. The

acid becomes inert when it leaves his body.

Aversion: Shauganttha creates a compulsion effect target-

ing one creature within 30 feet. The subject must succeed

on a Will save (DC 17) or gain an aversion to snakes for 10

minutes. Affected subjects must stay at least 20 feet from

Outer Circle: At 1st level, Shauganttha entered the serv-

ice of Merrshaulk and learned some of the secrets of the cult.

He gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intim-

idate checks when dealing with yuan-ti not of the temple

hierarchy and a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (reli-

gion) checks dealing with the worship of Merrshaulk.

In addition, Shauganttha learned the secret of brewing the

dreadful mixture that transforms humans into tainted ones

or broodguards (see Yuan-Ti in Chapter 10: Templates of this

book for more information) The mixture requires the venom

of a halfblood or pureblood yuan-ti as well as certain herbs

and roots found only in tropical forests, whose raw materials

cost is at least 50 gp. The DC to craft this mixture is 25.

Suffering Prestige Domain: At 2nd level, Shauganttha

gained access to the Suffering prestige domain. This allows

him access to a third domains spells and immediately grants

the domains power, as set out in the sidebar.

Cleric Spells Prepared: (5/5/4/3; save DC 14 + spell level):

0cure minor wounds, light, resistance (2), virtue; 1stbane*,

cause fear, doom, magic weapon, protection from good; 2ndbulls

onsters  have  always  populated  the  fantasy

world, but rare is the tale that tells of monster

protagonists. Historically, monsters have been

the opponents and challenges that adventurers

measure  themselves  against,  and  the  archetypal

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS monster, no matter how far the

game has evolved, waits within its lair for heroes with

hopes of slaying them and feasting upon their bones. Obvi-

ously, the appearance of one or more monster characters is

going to somewhat alter your campaign. Just how your

campaign adapts depends partially on how prevalent mon-

ster characters are and what the people of the world think

of them. It also depends on the sort of monster characters

that populate your adventuring crew.

EXISTING CAMPAIGNS

If you want to add this material to your existing campaign

world, you need to consider what sorts of monsters youll

allow in your game, alignment interactions, and the possi-

bility that your NPCs may become paladins and crusaders

against the player characters evil.

MONSTERS

Chapter 1: Character Creation Basics tells players to ask

you for help selecting a monster from the lists in Appendix

2: Compiled Tables. The tables in the appendix include a

column showing each monsters source table in Chap-

ter 2: Building Monster CharactersIntroductory,

Intermediate, or Advanced. The categories exist as

tools for you. Limit your players to the lists with

which you feel comfortable.

The average level of the existing party determines

which starting ECLs are available. Table A55: Mon-

sters Compiled by Starting ECL in Appendix 2:

Compiled Tables exists to help with this process. A

monster characters starting ECL should be equal

to or less than the party level. Category combined

with starting ECL helps narrow down the choices

available, making your decisions as DM easier.

In addition, you need to decide how NPCs will

react to monster characters. Most minotaurs

cannot walk into a typical village to buy supplies

or get healing. This is not an alignment issue

(see below), but rather an issue of expectations.

Players now have characters that the world

expects to be dangerous, if not outright evil.

Initial NPC attitude should be unfriendly, if

not hostile, toward monster characters and

those who associate with them. After gaining a

few levels, a monster character may be a local

hero instead, and that reputation may spread to

neighboring places.

101

AS

ALIGNMENT INTERACTIONS

In the traditional roleplaying game, monsters exist to

oppose player characters. This book skews that relationship.

As a result, players may find themselves with characters of

alignments other than what is normally expected. Some

monsters always have a specified alignment, some usually

have a certain alignment, and some often have a certain

alignment. When a kind of creature always has a particular

alignment, individuals who differ are either unique or one

in a million. When a creature usually has a particular align-

ment, individuals who differ are in the minority (consider-

ably less than 50% of the population). When a creature

often has a particular alignment, exceptions are common.

Make sure your players know why their characters differ

from other monsters of their kind, if they do. The more

common differences are, the easier it is to justify the

change. Remember that the more rare alignment differ-

ences are among members of a race or kind of creature, the

less player characters expect to find variations. A carefully

built and developed NPC may not get a chance to explain if

player characters assume all of that NPCs kind are evil.

If a player wants to introduce a character with an align-

ment that varies from, or opposes, the partys general align-

ment, sit down with that player and the rest of your group

to discuss it. If your groups style of play is kick in the

door, all that matters is how much power the new charac-

ter brings to the party. If your groups style of play is deep

immersion, discussion is vital. (See Determining Style of

Play in Chapter 1 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide for descrip-

tions of kick in the door and deep immersion.) Charac-

ters of varying or opposed alignment can be the source of

tremendous roleplaying opportunities, but the focus of the

game becomes resolving moral and ethical issues within

the party. If everyone expects to focus on your adventure,

that distraction can be annoying or upsetting. Find out if

your players welcome such a shift first.

EVIL CHARACTERS AND GAMES

Other products, such as Book of Vile Darkness, City of Sin, and

Lords of Darkness devote a great deal of attention to the

details of evil in the game world. Like the Players Handbook,

they all assume that evil is a feature in the campaign

reserved for monsters and NPCs. If you are using this book,

evil can become a more prominent feature in your cam-

paign. It affects player character interactions, the themes of

your game, and the nature of your campaign world. As the

DM, it is your responsibility to warn players before their

characters go too far or, alternatively, fall back into the

grooves of their good characters. Make sure players under-

stand the differences their characters shall encounter

before they begin. End sessions a little early to discuss the

game with players, and make sure they are all comfortable

with the campaigns content and direction. Make the time

to speak individually with players between sessions in case

someone is unwilling to object in front of the group.

Alignment may well become a particularly sensitive issue

among players. Lawful evil people can theoretically be trusted

to some extent to keep their word, though they may bend it a

little. Chaotic evil characters, however, may need to be

watched. On his own, out spying or assassinating someone, a

chaotic evil character may be matchless in ability. Other party

members might have reservations, though, about letting him

pull guard duty alone a night after a big treasure haul has been

made. This is not to say that chaotic evils should be banned

from play; they just act more independently.

Evil is not stupid. Evil creatures and characters can work

together just as well as good characters can. It should be no

more difficult to maintain party cohesion with a group that

includes lawful evil, neutral evil, and chaotic evil characters

than a typical adventurer mix of lawful good, neutral good,

and chaotic good. Certainly, evil characters attempt to

manipulate events to their personal advantagea phenom-

enon not limited to evil partiesbut not to the extent of

sabotaging their own chances of survival. Everyone needs to

be aware that unless some kind of trust can be formed

among the players, the game quickly falls apart. Who wants

to get involved if you keep getting stabbed in the back all the

time? Players with a history of having their characters kill

other player characters should know that their characters

may become prone to accidental falls from great altitudes,

food poisoning, being mistaken for a hunting animal by

ones own party, and so on. After repeated incidents of this

kind, one may not be invited to any more game sessions,

either. Chaotic evil should be played with care. Player char-

acters counting on their fellow adventurers in a crunch,

regardless of alignment, have to treat them with respect.

Evil characters are still people. Even bad guys have feel-

ings, emotions, and loyalties. This means it is just as possi-

ble to play a well-rounded character who happens to be evil

as one who happens to be neutral or good. An evil character

or  creature  can  be  a  loving  parent  (such  as  Grendels

mother), a faithful spouse, a loyal friend, or a devoted ser-

vant without diminishing their villainy in any way; this

merely reflects the way in which people compartmentalize

their lives and the fact that they behave in different ways

toward different groups, brutalizing those they consider

beneath them but treating their peers and loved ones with

respect and affection. Even monsters that lack intelligence

or emotion (such as constructs and some undead) prefer to

work with those who aid them or coexist favorably with

them. To put a more selfish spin on it, benefiting by the

efforts of others is something all but the most psychotic of

evil characters should appreciate.

Evil is often more active than good. Good characters react

to evil plots, invasions, and crimes; or infiltrate lairs and

citadels. The DM decides what the bad guys do, and discov-

ering and foiling that is the heart of the adventure. When

player characters become evil, players become the driving

force for the events of the campaign. They may attack vil-

lages, plunder castles, raid caravans, or try to open a portal

for ancient, elder gods to enter the world. Players should be

aware of that additional responsibility before beginning an

evil campaign. They now generate many events in your

campaign world that used to be your responsibility.

Many of the basic assumptions of the DUNGEONS & DRAG-

ONS game change when playing an evil campaign, but the

most basic needs of the player characters do not. They need

safe places to rest, recuperate, study, and buy or make new

equipment. As the DM, you must realize that the places

used by previous player characters may not cater to new,

evil ones. Evil clerics cannot spontaneously cast cure spells,

for instance, so healing may take more time and special

fees. While merchants may believe that gold has no align-

ment, and therefore sell to anyone, they will not sell to

anyone who robs them or their caravans. Evil characters

may not be able to take a room in the village inn while they

explore the surrounding countryside. Then again, they

might, depending on the local power center (see Generat-

ing Towns in Chapter 4 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

When adding evil player characters to your campaign

world, start by creating a mirror for the support system

used by the good characters. A black market that sells to evil

characters in return for protection might operate out of

waterfront warehouses after dark. An evil cult may lurk in

the mausoleums of the local graveyard, ready to heal those

characters that promote their dark agenda. Perhaps a nearby

dungeon operates as a clandestine inn for those who are

unwelcome in more conventional resting places.

At some point, you may design a new campaign world that

assumes monster characters are common. Each of the

options discussed below offers one version of how a cam-

paign could evolve. They represent the seeds of ideas for

how to use monsters and how they fit it, but each campaign

model is different. Each campaign has its own history, and

its future that characters have a hand in shaping.

WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE

(CHAOTIC/ACCEPTING)

In this campaign model, the prevailing opinion holds that

monsters, no matter how foul and evil they may look, are

free sentient beings with all the inalienable rights that

humans, elves, and every other humanoid species are heir

to. The denizens of this campaign are not foolishthey

know that many monsters are evil and nefarious. Just the

same, they are loath to reject monsters simply because of

their origins. The philosophical leaders of this land realize

that no medusa or troll really had a choice in how it came

into this world, and indeed as oppressed as its upbringing

may have been, it is deserving of more sympathy and con-

sideration, not less.

In this world, evil among monsters is largely perceived to

be a psychological condition rather than an absolute or

genetic one. Most monsters are thought to become creatures

of evil or destruction not because of any infernal or diabolic

tie, but because of a fear of rejection, loneliness, or some other

understandable psychological condition. Even the foulest

tanarri may be in truth the victim of its own psychoses, and

the enlightened people of this world hold out hope that with

openness, respect, and even love, the darkest of souls can be

redeemed. And who knows? Perhaps they are right.

There are of course exceptions among the people of this

land or worldpeople who reject the idea of ghouls, awak-

ened lions, and mind flayers walking the streets of their

burg. Maybe these are religious fanatics, distressed and fear-

ful peasants, or simple people who have had a painful

encounter or suffered loss at the hands of a monster. Some

of the time characters spend in this campaign world may be

focused on dealing with such subversives.

It is interesting to consider what could have happened

during the history of this campaign to produce such open

thinking. Something in this lands past must have cast quite a

ripple onto the surface. Maybe an incredible magical trans-

formation passed over the land, shaping brothers and sisters

of a certain time into new forms that could only be called

monstrous. After some time of struggle, most of the people of

this world came to accept their new kin. Another answer

would be that once upon a time, a savior appeared among

this world. Perhaps this hero was a military hero who drove

back some force of darkness, or a contemplative whose

speeches and writings revealed a new way of thinking to a

generation and all those who followed. Either way, this spe-

cial monster inspired and helped to bring out the best in

people. Along the way, it gave its name to a new way of think-

ing, a new government, and more than a few monuments.

CREATURE MANAGEMENT

(LAWFUL/ACCEPTING)

Only humanoid arrogance would lead one to presume that

in every variation of the fantasy world, humans and their

ilk are running things. In this campaign model, humans do

not run the show. Perhaps they are outnumbered in terms

of numbers or power, and the monsters are ready and able

to impose their own take on how the world should be run.

Maybe this world lost the epic struggle against evil, the

outcome of which is a lesser hell on earth, where villainy

and every form of sin are simply common. Here, it is not

that monsters represent anything new or good, but that

they are the norm. To the victors go the spoils, as the saying

goes, and the monsters of this world can take some pleasure

in it. Imagine what differences would result when manti-

cores and fire giants freely walk the streets, peacekeepers

that enforce the law of monster rule.

Even so, this very victory may bring out about interesting

changes in monsterkind. Will this reversal in the usual

order of things be followed by civil war and strife as each

faction of creature seeks to prove its dominance? Giants and

dragons battle to prove themselves the ultimate victors.

Maybe this war plays out behind the scenes, and player

characters, monster or humanoid, are nothing but pawns in

the grand struggle. Alternatively, perhaps after their victory

the more intelligent monsters are forced to reflect upon

what sort of world they shall have. Will being in charge

mean that these monsters have to take a greater responsi-

bility for themselves and the world? Monsters here can

begin a path of philosophy in which the selfish desires and

caprices of individual monsters must be subject to the

needs and the will of the whole. A monster state is born.

Or, in an even more unlikely turn of events, perhaps it is

the humans that represent an ancient source of corruption.

Here, in this world, the spring of hope rose upor indeed,

rises up stillamong the various monsters of this world.

However it started, a band of well-intentioned monsters

banded together to fight against the tyranny of this world,

and they won, or at least are still fighting a war that makes

part of their world different. What remains today is the con-

tinued effort, a world where monsters have their own society.

THE PEOPLE OPPRESSED

(LAWFUL/REJECTING)

Humans have a long tradition of subjugating their own

people. Whether they differentiate between the haves and

the have-nots by skin color, ethnic background, religion,

language, or geography, humanoids have delivered death

and slavery in abundance. Why imagine that monsters,

especially as different as they are from humanoids, would

be treated any differently? Monsters are scary, frequently

powerful, and threatening. They pose a definite danger to

the good people of the land, and so they must be con-

trolledenslaved and reeducated to understand their place

in society when possible, or driven into hiding or elimi-

nated when not.

The monsters of this world may be good, evil, or any

mixed combination of the two. More than usual, though,

they have been forced to come together to counter the

threat of ending their days in shackles or by the sword.

What unites the monsters, to a greater or lesser degree, is

the fervor and accord with which humanoids have banded

together to do battle. The frontiers of this land may appear

little different from any D&D campaign. Bands of adven-

turers, bounty hunters, and profit-seekers scour the surface

and the Underdark in search of their foes. They come seek-

ing glory or treasure or bits of magical lore that mon-

sterkind wants to keep to itself.

Meanwhile, in the more civilized towns and palaces, the

enlightened people are more accepting of monsters, to a

point. Carefully guarded and controlled by force of arms

and sorcery, the monsters that find employment within the

cities are given grace to continue to live their miserable and

cretinous lives, if they work hard and cause no trouble.

Therefore, the sphinx may be trotted out at parties to tell its

clever little riddles, but after that it is back to breaking

rocks with its claws. Similarly, gargoyles serve as messen-

gers, dryads as concubines, and displacer beasts as pets.

Meanwhile, lynch mobs prowl the night, raising fires and

victims up to satisfy their fear and aggression.

Some monsters become complicit with those in power.

Other monsters call them traitors as they sell out their own

kind, but for these few, it is a choice of practicality. Monsters

have lost their great struggle, they say, and it would be fool-

ish for them to suffer for no reason. Maybe someday, they

say, hundreds of years from now, monsters may gain inde-

pendence, equality, or freedom. However, for today it is

better to bow ones head and go about ones life. Sure, that

may mean looking away as the centaur is beaten for her inso-

lence and sloth, but there is nothing to be done about it.

For others, the choice is different but equally clear. A net-

work of monsters speaks softly in the shadows, foretelling a

day when monsters shall strike back. In the frontiers, open

battles and skirmishes may be frequent. Meanwhile, the

monsters within urban areas do their best to protect their

own  kind  and  the  growing  network  that  binds  them

together. Sometimes this means helping a monster in

danger escape into the wilds or rescuing a creature from the

worst forms of persecution. Sometimes, it demands more

action. Whether on the front lines serving or opposing

humanoids, or as shadowy agents for either side, monsters

in this campaign world have a long struggle before them.

WORLD WITHOUT RULE

(CHAOTIC/REJECTING)

For this campaign, strong organization represents the excep-

tion rather than the rule. For humans and humanoids, the

world is a scary place, and they do not have the means or the

will to bring order to it. Humanoid kingdoms may be divided

and unruly, or they may be so distant from one another that

truly effective rulership over the land is impossible. What-

ever the underlying cause, the humans of this world have

grown to become suspicious and wary of outsiders. Not sur-

prisingly, this makes it difficult for monster characters to

find acceptance. Most monsters are driven off from civilized

areas if they are lucky, regardless of how pleasant their

speech or manners. Any monster that demonstrates a threat

or offers open hostility is put down as quickly as possible.

For themselves, the monsters of this world have no real

unity, either. No persistent threat unifies them, and by their

nature monsters here associate only with members of their

own kind and a few allies. Monsters prey on humankind,

and humankind hunts monsters, but nothing of lasting

importance is accomplished. Monsters that defy the rule,

that seek to join civilized society, have a very difficult time.

No matter how heroic they are, no matter how far and wide

their legend grows, they can never win the hearts of all

humanity. Even should one succeed, no monster character

can expect to have good relations from that point with

others of his own kind.

In many ways, this state of affairs is the most typical of

the average D&D campaignfull of potential for change,

but requiring a great deal of effort to bring it about.

THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Among all these possibilities, the largest and most varied

campaign worlds take a varied approach. Some portions of

the world may provide examples of one campaign model,

while in a distant land another model can be found. This

not only keeps the Dungeon Master busy with new stories

to create, but the characters are kept guessing about what a

wild world they live in.

It is an oversimplification to posit that the conflict of mon-

ster against humanoid is so central, but in some campaigns or

regions  it  could  be.  One  kingdom  could  take  the

lawful/rejecting approach, while a neighboring kingdom is

lawful/accepting. Given that one kingdom represses mon-

ster independence and the adjacent one is strongly influ-

enced if not controlled by monsters, these two kingdoms

probably do not care much for one another. Periodic war,

intrigue, and distrust make for an interesting locale for

adventures. Even within a single region, different factions

within a court or bureaucracy may espouse different posi-

tions. Just as during any time of increasing enfranchisement,

disagreements and differences in political opinion may have

brother fighting brother, and egg-sister fighting egg-sister.

s a DM, you often use the same sort of monster

repeatedly as an opponent. The monster may be a

theme or a running gag, or it may be the primary

villain for your campaign. Of course, increasing

familiarity with the monster also makes it easier

for you to run. As your player characters rise in levels, you

can keep throwing more and more of these monsters at

them, but eventually youll probably want tougher versions.

In many ways, this book is all about advancing monsters,

primarily with class levels from the Players Handbook. The

Monster Manual provides the basics for toughening mon-

sters through advancement, and you may already be famil-

iar with these rules. Chapter 3: Monster Classes and

Appendix 1: Sample Monster Classes provide ways to

regress monsters and then advance them back to normal.

Chapter 7: Prestige Classes gives you another option. This

chapter discusses the different options and offers sugges-

tions and recommendations for which one to use when,

and how. It also provides guidelines for picking feats when

advancing a monster and estimating the Challenge Rating

of the advanced monster.

ADVANCING

AS A CHARACTER

When you need a monster to have a particular class ability,

feat, or skill, adding class levels is usually the quickest way

to accomplish what you need. A few levels of fighter

make any monster tougher in combat. A level or two

of cleric makes any group of monsters more chal-

lenging. Some monsters, in fact, advance only by

character class.

Monsters with less than 1 HD take on that char-

acter class entirely. (See the 1 Hit Die Creatures

sidebar in Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters

for more information.) For monsters with more

than 1 HD, simply add the class levels to the exist-

ing monster. Chapter 2: Building Monster Charac-

ters contains all the guidelines you need to do

that. The issue is which class to add. A specific

need may dictate a specific class; for instance,

your monsters may need a high priest, so you add

cleric levels to one of them. Here are some guide-

lines for other situations.

Single Monster: Single monsters are better

with levels of barbarian, fighter, monk, paladin,

or ranger (see below). These classes make the

single monster more self-sufficient in combat.

Groups of Monsters: Groups of monsters

benefit from having at least one cleric and at

least one sorcerer or wizard (see below). These

classes bolster the entire group through spells

that increase speed, enhance ability scores, or

heal injuries.

STANDARD CLASSES

Following is some general advice about deciding on an

appropriate character class for a monster.

Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger: These are the

four usual possibilities for combat-focused monsters. The

choice usually boils down to having a d12 Hit Die and the

rage ability or having a wide selection of feats. Few base

creatures meet the alignment requirement for paladins, but

monster PCs might. Monsters with moderate Constitution

scores should consider the barbarian class, since the large

Hit Die will generate the most hit points on average. Mon-

sters with high Constitution scores can take fighter or

ranger levels, since their Constitution bonus will make up

for the slightly smaller Hit Die.

Bard or Rogue: Rogue is a good choice for monsters with

high Dexterity and low Charisma. Rogues get plenty of skill

points, can make sneak attacks, and enjoy a variety of useful

class abilities. Spend skill points on Tumble and Bluff (so the

monster can feint in combat) and choose feats such as

Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack if you expect the char-

acter to do a lot of fighting.

Bard is generally a poor choice for monsters, unless you

want something to seriously challenge an opposing PC bard.

High-Charisma monsters are generally better off as sorcer-

ers in combat. If you need monsters to interact with the

party other than through fighting, consider bards or rogues

with lots of ranks in Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense

Motive.

Cleric or Druid: If Wisdom is one of the monsters top

two ability scores, these classes are good choices. Monsters

that work with or against undead are better off taking levels

of cleric. This also helps a group of monsters in a fight, since

the cleric can use healing spells, as well as spells to enhance

Strength and Constitution. Monster druids present a seri-

ous threat to PCs because of their summoning abilities and

their control over nature.

Monk: Monsters with high scores in Strength, Dexterity,

and Wisdom (or even just in Dexterity and Wisdom) may

do well with this class if they meet the alignment restric-

tion. Those with natural attacks can deal their natural

weapon damage with the monks higher unarmed attack

rate, or they can deal the monks unarmed combat damage,

whichever is higher. Generally, monsters with only one

good ability score out of those three are better off as fight-

ers, rogues, or clerics.

Sorcerer or Wizard: Monsters without exceptional

combat ability and with high Intelligence, Charisma, or a

combination of the two should take one of these spellcast-

ing classes. Those with Intelligence higher than Charisma

should take levels of wizard; those with Charisma higher

than Intelligence should take levels of sorcerer. Both classes

are helpful to groups of monsters. Starting at 3rd level, sor-

cerers and wizards can cast spells to enhance the ability

scores of their allies.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

In general, prestige classes present more specialized class

abilities than regular character classes. They add a layer of

complication in the form of class requirements. Advanc-

106

ing a monster to the point where it qualifies for a prestige

class may make it too big a threat for your current adven-

ture.

Most prestige class descriptions state which classes most

commonly enter the prestige class. Those statements often

indicate the strength of the prestige class: combat, stealth,

noncombat interaction, divine spellcasting, or arcane spell-

casting. Once you determine that strength, it is easy to apply

the above guidelines given for the basic classes to the pres-

tige class.

ADVANCING BY TYPE

The Monster Manual covers this form of monster advance-

ment. When the Advancement line of a monsters entry

shows Hit Dice and size, you can use this method. You must

advance a monster by type if it lacks the Intelligence score

to gain class levels (minimum 3).

The Advancement line in a monsters statistics block

shows when the monster changes size, based on its number

of Hit Dice. It gains an ability score increase for every four

additional Hit Dice it has; it gains a new feat for every three

additional Hit Dice it has; and it gains skill points for each

additional Hit Dice it has. In general, monsters advancing

using this method do not gain new skills but improve the

ones they have as class skills.

CHANGING SIZE

When  an  advanced  monster  changes  size,  adjust  its

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution first. Use the new

Constitution and the new number of Hit Dice to determine

the monsters new hit points. Then determine the new For-

titude saving throw bonus based on the monsters type and

add the new Constitution modifier. Apply any other modi-

fiers, such as from Great Fortitude, and you have the mon-

sters new Fortitude saving throw bonus.

Next, use the monsters new Dexterity modifier, natural

armor bonus (if any), and new size modifier to determine

the monsters new Armor Class. (Remember that adjusted

natural armor bonuses are not cumulative; just use the new

score instead.) The new Dexterity modifier also changes the

monsters initiative modifier. Determine the new Reflex

saving throw bonus based on the monsters type and add the

new Dexterity modifier. Apply any other modifiers, such as

from Lightning Reflexes, and you have the monsters new

Reflex saving throw bonus. If the monster has the Weapon

Finesse feat, use the new Dexterity modifier and the new

base attack bonus to determine total attack bonuses with the

affected weapons.

If the monster does not use Weapon Finesse, use the new

Strength modifier and the new base attack bonus to deter-

mine total attack bonuses. Remember that an increase in

size imposes a penalty on attack rolls. The new Strength

bonus changes damage as well. If the monster uses a single

melee attack each round, it adds 1 1/2 times its Strength

bonus to damage. If it uses multiple attacks, it adds its

Strength bonus to damage from its primary attack and 1/2

its Strength bonus to damage from secondary attacks.

ADVANCING BY TEMPLATE

Applying a template to a monster advances the monster in

the sense that it often increases the monsters CR. Like char-

acter classes, templates provide a monster with a set of abili-

ties different from those of typical members of its kind.

Templates work with monsters that advance by any method.

For details on the mechanics of adding templates to mon-

sters, see Chapter 10: Templates.

Advance monsters by template when you want to surprise

your players. If they take hobgoblins for granted, present

them with a few half-dragon hobgoblins. Your reward for

the work and preparation is the expressions on the players

faces  when  your  handcrafted  monster  uses  its  breath

weapon for the first time.

The drawback to advancing by template is that the mon-

ster gains no Hit Dice (although the Hit Die type may

change). Unless the template adjusts ability scores, qualities

such as attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, AC, initiative

modifier, and DCs for monster abilities will not change. As

a result, you may want to combine this method with another

one, such as adding a class.

ADVANCEMENT AND CR

When monsters advance as monsters, their special abilities

get more powerful. When monsters advance as characters,

they gain new abilities. In either case, base attack bonus,

saving throws, Hit Dice, hit points, ability scores, and base

damage (if advancement includes an increase in size) all

increase. Most monsters gain skill points and feats as they

advance, so of course their Challenge Rating changes.

When you advance a monster to present players and char-

acters with a special threat, you must track the CR change as

wellnot only so that the PCs get credit for the correct

amount of experience points, but also to make sure the

advanced monster is not beyond the capabilities of the party.

ADVANCING AS A CHARACTER

Adding class levels to a base creature makes the process of

determining its new CR easy. For monsters with more than

1 HD, add the total class levels to the base creatures CR to

get the monsters final CR. For monsters with 1 HD or less,

class level total equals CR.

ADVANCING AS A MONSTER

If youre in a hurry, or just dont like a lot of calculation, you

can use a quick and dirty method, described immediately

below, for determining the CR of an advanced monster.

Otherwise, use the more detailed method that follows in the

next section.

Quick and Dirty

If the base creature has an odd number of Hit Dice, increase

the CR by 1 for the first Hit Die you add, and then by 1 for

every 2 HD you add after that. If the base monster has an

even number of Hit Dice, add 1 to the CR for every 2 HD

you add. A monsters CR increases for every 2 HD because

the formula used to determine the save DCs for a monsters

special abilities is (10 + monsters appropriate ability score

bonus + 1/2 monsters Hit Dice). If the monster gains a feat

or an ability score increase when it advances, add an addi-

tional 1 to its CR.

Like all quick and dirty methods, this one can be wildly

inaccurate. See Testing the New CR, below, for ways to

check your results.

Detailed Method

First, divide the advanced monsters new hit points by 4.5 to

get its effective Hit Dice. (This takes into account the added

difficulty of a creature with a high Constitution score.) Then

refer to table 91: CR Estimation to derive the monsters

base CR. (This base rating can be further adjusted by other

factors; see below.)

Next, for each special ability that the monster can use in

combat, add 1 to the base CR. If the monster can use only

one ability at a time, add 1 for each ability it can activate and

leave on (one that has a duration other than instantaneous

or concentration). If the ability is useful before combat, such

as invisibility, it should also add to the total. Otherwise, abil-

ities used outside combat do not add to CR.

Once you complete this process, test the new CR a few

times before throwing the advanced monster at your PCs.

(See Testing the New CR, below.)

ADVANCING BY TEMPLATE

If you add a template to a monster, the template lists a CR

adjustment. This method is as simple as adding class levels.

Add the CR adjustment to the monsters CR, and you are

ready to test the new CR.

TESTING THE NEW CR

Chapter  2  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide sets  out  the

advancement of classed NPCs through 20th level, starting

with Table 233: NPC Barbarian. You can use those tables to

check your monsters CR against a party of the appropriate

level. If you have the Enemies and Allies accessory, you might

be able to use a standard party consisting of Tordek, Lidda,

Mialee, and Jozan, just as we do when playtesting.

Check out Table 237: NPC Fighter. Add 10 (a slightly

below average roll on a d20) to the monsters best attack

bonus (total attack bonus, not base). If the total is equal to or

higher than the AC of an NPC fighter with levels equal to

the monsters CR, make no change. If it is lower, reduce the

107

CR by 1. Next add 10 to the fighters best attack bonus. If

that total hits the monsters AC, make no change. If it

cannot, increase the monsters CR by 1.

Next check the save DCs for the monsters special abili-

ties. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers have the

highest Fortitude saving throw bonuses. Bards, monks, and

rogues have the highest Reflex saving throw bonuses. Cler-

ics and druids have the highest Will saving throws bonuses.

Use Table 239: NPC Paladin for Fortitude saves, Table 241:

NPC Rogue for Reflex saves, and either Table 235: NPC

Cleric or Table 236: NPC Druid for Will saves. (Its worth

checking other classes to make sure that you have the high-

est save bonuses for the particular level you are testing.) Add

10 to the appropriate save bonus. If that is higher than the

save DC for the monsters ability, subtract 1 from the CR. If

it is equal to or less than the DC, make no change. Remem-

ber that your player characters may have racial bonuses,

resistances, or immunities. For instance, an elf rarely has to

worry  about  saving  throws  against  sleep  effects,  and

dwarves get a racial saving throw bonus against spells and

spell-like effects (but not supernatural ones).

ADVANCEMENT AND FEATS

In general, there are two strategies for picking feats: mini-

mizing weaknesses and maximizing strengths. A character

with a low Wisdom taking Iron Will is an example of mini-

mizing a weakness. An orc with Power Attack is an example

of maximizing a strength.

Minimizing Weaknesses

Minimizing weaknesses tends to produce balanced charac-

ters. They have no Achilles heel, but neither do they have

any remarkable advantages. This is a perfectly valid strategy

for player characters, who never know what challenge they

will face next and who will be the focus of each encounter of

the campaign.

When picking feats for a monster opponent, remember that

monsters only need to be powerful and memorable for their

single encounter. They do not have to be well-rounded or

viable characters in every situation. Have intelligent monsters

use their environment to minimize their weaknesses. Goblins

prefer to ambush foes from the far side of a bridge or chasm,

where their ranged weapons put them on better footing. They

do not need to take proficiency feats in better armor or

weapons; they need to pick a fight on advantageous ground.

There are two reasons why a DM should choose to mini-

mize a monsters weaknesses with feats. The first is because

the monster has a truly glaring weakness: A monster with a

low Wisdom that does not have Will as its good saving

throw could benefit from Iron Will. The second is to trip up

cocky player characters. If your PCs depend on a particular

spell because it always works against that opponent, give

the monster a feat that improves its saving throw (or items

that protect it from that spell).

Maximizing Strengths

Maximizing strengths produces dramatic characters. They

have both clear strengths and clear weaknesses. This strat-

egy can produce highly memorable PCs. It can also produce

frustration, however. A brawny, reckless barbarian seems

like a powerful melee combatant, but if his Wisdom is so

low that he is especially vulnerable to magic such as hold and

charm spells, he might never get into the fight.

Monster opponents, on the other hand, only appear in

single encounters. They benefit tremendously from maxi-

mizing their strengths. Swap a level of fighter for the orcs

usual level of warrior and give them Weapon Focus to go

with Power Attack. Your players and their characters are

sure to be surprised when the orcs have more hit points than

usual and hit more often.

SPECIFIC FEATS

Here are some suggestions for specific feats from the Players

Handbook.

Alertness: Monsters with Alertness are the bane of

rogues, because this feat keeps them from being surprised as

often.

Armor Proficiency: Monsters are generally better off

gaining armor proficiency through class levels.

Blind-Fight: This feat is particularly useful against oppo-

nents who like to attack under cover of the darkness spell. If

PCs use the darkness strategy extensively, the DM should

occasionally give this feat to monsters as an unexpected

challenge, or use monsters with senses that ignore darkness,

such as grimlocks.

Cleave and Great Cleave: These two feats are most

useful for monsters outnumbered by their opponents.

Cleave doesnt help an army of orcs attacking a small group

of player characters, but the PCs can certainly use it. One or

two powerful monsters attacking four or more PCs can

make good use of Cleave, where the PCs find it less useful.

Combat Casting: Any monster that uses spells or spell-

like abilities can benefit from this feat, but only if it uses

those spells or spell-like abilities in combat. Those who pri-

marily buff up with spells such as cats grace and haste before

combat can make better choices.

Combat Reflexes: Any monster with high Dexterity and

reach or a reach weapon should take Combat Reflexes the

first chance it gets. Such monsters are the bane of spellcast-

ers, since they can reach right over the front line to strike at

characters casting spells, often multiple times in a single

round.

Deflect Arrows: Monsters often have natural weapons

and do not need Improved Unarmed Strike, the prerequisite

feat for this one. Granted, monsters casually swatting arrows

out of the air are frightening, but most are better off achiev-

ing this ability through adding two levels of monk.

Dodge: The decision for this feat is the inverse of the

decision for Cleave and Great Cleave. Dodge becomes more

useful the fewer opponents you fight. When your foes out-

number you, having a better Armor Class against only one

of them is not very exciting. Dodge remains very important

as a gateway feat, though, leading to Mobility, Spring Attack,

and Whirlwind Attack.

Endurance: This is always a great flavor feat. Having it

says a lot about the athletic nature of a monster. Endurance

is very useful in games involving a great deal of cross-coun-

try travel or long-distance swimming. In campaigns focused

around rivers, swamps, and similar terrain, it allows PCs to

wait in ambush under the waters surface for long periods.

Monster opponents can also use that tactic, but this is rarely

a good choice for them.

Exotic Weapon Proficiency: This is a good feat for

changing the flavor of a monster. A gang of orc fighters with

Power Attack and spiked chains is quite a different obstacle

from typical orc warriors.

Expertise: This is an excellent feat for spellcasters with

sufficient Intelligence, making them harder to hit by shift-

ing their base attack bonus to their Armor Class. Characters

with class abilities requiring them to wear light or medium

armor, such as rangers and rogues, also benefit a great deal

from this feat. More important, this is a gateway feat for

Improved Disarm, Improved Trip, and Whirlwind Attack. A

drider could easily take Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked

chain), Expertise, and Improved Disarm instead of its usual

suite of feats, providing a nasty surprise for characters with

beloved magic weapons.

Extra Turning: This is a great feat in campaigns focused

on fighting undead. It also makes it easier to use other feats,

like some in Defenders of the Faith, that require a use of turn-

ing. Unless their opponents are undead, monsters with

cleric or paladin levels will not take this. If the players have

undead characters built using this book, it is fair to surprise

them with cleric or paladin opponents who took this feat

(most likely clerics).

Far Shot: Any monster that gets to ambush opponents

from long range benefits from this feat. Note that this feat

does not increase the range of ray spells.

Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes: These

feats are excellent choices for monsters with a low base save

bonus and a low score in the related ability. Low-Wisdom

giants benefit from Iron Will, for instance. Any one of these

feats should be sufficient for a monster with a low ability

score to cover itself.

Improved Bull Rush: This feat is a particularly good

choice for Large and larger monsters that can use their supe-

rior size and weight against opponents. Such monsters look

for opportunities to fight on bridges, along chasms, and near

pits. They want to charge opponents and push them over the

edge.

Improved Critical: Once a monster has a base attack

bonus of +8 or higher, it should strongly consider taking

this feat. The larger the threat range for its weapon, the more

useful this feat becomes. Monsters with high enough base

attack bonuses can take this feat for a natural weapon. If the

monster uses weapons, arm it with something that has a

good threat range, such as a longsword, and give it this feat.

Remember that damage-dealing ray spells also benefit from

Improved Critical.

Improved Initiative: Getting in the first blow is always

good. That is a potential benefit of both Alertness and

Improved Initiative. Getting the jump on an opponent is

particularly good for monsters with area-effect special

attacks or attacks such as paralysis that remove an opponent

from combat, and for casters with area-effect spells. Com-

bining this with Alertness and Quick Draw can make for

frighteningly fast monsters, even if they do not have high

speed or high Dexterity scores.

Improved Unarmed Strike: Monsters with natural

weapons  do  not  need  this,  and  those  without  natural

weapons generally take levels of monk if unarmed combat is

important to them.

Item Creation Feats: Monsters rarely take these, since

doing so means not taking other feats that would help them

survive in combat. Some NPCs, and a few rare monsters

with levels of a spellcasting class, might take them.

Leadership: The Organization line of the Monster Manual

statistic block generally replaces the need for this feat. If a

particular monster needs a special follower, Leadership may

be a good idea. In such cases, use the monsters class levels.

Martial Weapon Proficiency: Monsters with 2 HD or

more are proficient with the weapons mentioned in their

Monster Manual descriptions. Monsters with fewer than 2

HD gain weapon proficiencies as they advance in a charac-

ter class, so they are better off taking class levels.

Metamagic Feats: Spellcasting monsters should take

these immediately after Combat Casting and Spell Focus,

provided they expect to survive long enough to cast spells of

the appropriate levels.

Mobility:  High-Dexterity  monsters  usually  prefer

Weapon Finesse ahead of this feat, since they can expect to

make attack rolls more often than they are subject to attacks

of opportunity.

Mounted  Combat  (Mounted  Archery,  Ride-By

Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample): If your campaign

focuses on outdoor adventures, giving ample opportunity to

ride into combat, monsters should focus on this feat and

those that branch from it (given above in parentheses)

even at the expense of feats such as Power Attack. Even cen-

taur characters benefit from the later feats. However, if the

prospect of keeping track of a gang of goblins and their

worg mounts seems daunting to you as DM, remember that

halfspears and shortspears are simple weapons (so many

monsters and most character classes can use them) and can

be set against PCs charges.

Point Blank Shot: This is a great feat for monsters, such

as goblins, that prefer ranged combat to melee. Ray attacks

also benefit from Point Blank Shot.

Power Attack: This is a good feat for monsters with more

Strength than Dexterity. If the monster already has Power

Attack, pursue the other feats on the Power Attack tree

(Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Sunder, and Great Cleave).

Precise Shot: Any monster that prefers ranged combat

and that has a level of fighter will almost certainly take Point

Blank Shot and this feat. Melee combatants, such as orcs,

love to fight alongside such creatures, because they can

close with the enemy while the ranged attackers remain

effective. Similarly, spellcasters who use ray spells benefit

greatly from this feat.

Quick Draw: This feat becomes tremendously useful to

anyone with a base attack bonus of +6 or higher. Once a crea-

ture gets multiple attacks in a single round, this feat allows

it to draw its weapons and still take a full attack action.

Rapid Shot: This feat is very attractive to monsters that

prefer ranged combat, since they almost certainly meet the

Dexterity requirement. Precise Shot is a better choice for

monsters working with others who prefer melee combat.

Even they almost certainly take this feat after Precise Shot,

though. It is not a difficult choice, since a single level of

fighter can allow both Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot,

and taking another fighter level gives access to this feat.

Run: A monster with Spring Attack or Shot on the Run

should consider this feat for the boost to its movement.

Shield Proficiency: As with weapon proficiencies, mon-

sters are better off taking class levels to gain the benefits of

this feat. In addition, this is a defensive feat, like Alertness,

and monster opponents are often better off emphasizing

their offensive power.

Simple Weapon Proficiency: Monsters with 2 HD or

more are proficient with the weapons in their Monster

Manual descriptions. Monsters with fewer than 2 HD gain

weapon proficiencies as they advance in a character class, so

they are better off taking class levels.

Shot on the Run: With three prerequisite feats and a

Dexterity requirement, few opponents will achieve this

featbut many PCs will. Monsters that prefer ranged

combat should take this feat if they can, since it lets them

move out from behind total cover, fire, and take cover again.

Skill Focus: This feat can be a good way to make up for a

low ability score. For example, a fighter who wants to use

Bluff (a cross-class skill for fighters) to feint in combat and

who has a low Charisma score can benefit from Skill Focus

(Bluff ). A monster opponent that wants to bluff enemies

might take this feat, but generally, this is a fine choice for

NPC artisans and a poor one for monster opponents.

Spell Focus: This feat is an excellent choice for spellcast-

ing monsters such as driders. Monsters that cast spells

prefer this feat to Power Attack, Point Blank Shot, or similar

combat feats. They also benefit from Combat Casting, of

course. Specialist wizards in particular often take this feat

for their specialist school.

Spell Mastery: While player characters may find this

useful, spellcasting opponents generally do not need it. The

usual reason an opponent does not have its spellbook is

because the PCs have killed the opponent.

Spell Penetration: Spellcasters take this feat once they

start encountering opponents with spell resistance. Since

enemy creatures generally have spell resistance before the

PCs do, this feat benefits PC spellcasters even earlier. Until

the PCs are likely to have spell resistance, or unless the

monster opponent hates another kind of monster with spell

resistance, other feats are more attractive.

Spring Attack: Feats with as many prerequisites as this

one require a great deal of commitment. They become part

of the signature style of the monster that takes them. High-

Dexterity melee combatants certainly benefit from this feat,

particularly if they have a high speed. They may consider

taking Weapon Finesse before this feat, since being able to

move in, attack, and move away is less useful if the attack

does not hit.

Stunning Fist: The ability to stun an opponent for a

round is desirable enough that high-Wisdom melee combat-

ants may take Improved Unarmed Strike and this feat. How-

ever, combatants with a base attack bonus of +8 or higher

(required for this feat) are generally better off combining

the Power Attack tree with Weapon Focus and other feats.

Those truly desiring this ability may be better off taking

levels of monk.

Sunder: Combatants want this feat if they typically have

better magic weapons than their opponents, or if their oppo-

nents generally do not have magic weapons. In other words,

this feat favors player characters. Monsters with low Intelli-

gence scores cannot comprehend the benefit of striking a

weapon rather than the weapons wielder, but even an orc or

a goblin sees the value of this feat. Because the feat is

dependent on the enemys having no magic weapon, or a

weaker one, most monster opponents should take Improved

Bull Rush instead of this. Smaller creatures, such as goblins,

may reverse that priority.

Toughness: While more hit points are attractive, mon-

sters could also gain them by taking levels in a class with a

larger Hit Die, while also gaining the advantages of that

class. Toughness is a good feat for constructs, undead, and

any other monster type that has no Constitution score and

therefore no bonus to hit points.

Track: Most monsters are better off taking a level of

ranger to get Track, along with the rangers ability to fight

with two weapons and a favored enemy. Ambush predators

do not need this feat, but other types of opponents can make

good use of it.

Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fight-

ing: Two weapons mean two chances to score a critical hit

every round, provided the monster can take a full attack

action and use both. However, the chance to hit with each

weapon is lower than if fighting with a single weapon. It is

difficult to choose between dealing damage every round

and having two chances to deal extra damage every round.

Most monsters are better off taking levels of ranger to gain

the benefits. The exception is monsters that use double

weapons: They should take Exotic Weapon Proficiency (nec-

essary for all but the quarterstaff ) and Two-Weapon Fighting

as soon as they possibly can. Most benefit from the fighter

class, since they can have both feats at 1st level.

Weapon Finesse: Monsters with high Dexterity scores

and a preference for melee combat will probably take this

feat as soon they have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher.

Weapon Focus: This is a particularly good feat for fight-

ers planning on taking Weapon Specialization, and for

Small and smaller monsters, who benefit more from this

feat than from Improved Bull Rush or Sunder. Medium-

size  monster  opponents  should  take  this  rather  than

Sunder, since the PCs probably have better weapons. Large

and larger monsters will generally take Improved Bull

Rush first.

Weapon Specialization: Creatures with four or more

levels of fighter should take this feat. Small and smaller

monsters, which find Weapon Focus especially attractive,

are likely to take Weapon Specialization as soon as they qual-

ify for it. Monsters with sufficient levels of fighter generally

take basic combat feats such as Improved Bull Rush and

Power Attack (if melee combatants) or Point Blank Shot and

Precise Shot (if ranged specialists) before taking Weapon

Focus, and this feat clearly comes after Weapon Focus.

dding a template to a monster affects either its Chal-

lenge Rating or its level adjustment, depending on

whether the creature is a monster or a player char-

acter. Therefore, the Dungeon Master is part of

every decision to add a template. The material that

follows is written with the DM in mind.

ADDING A TEMPLATE

As pointed out in Chapter 9: Advancing Monsters, adding

a template gives a monster a suite of abilities that its kind

does not normally have. This change increases the crea-

tures Challenge Rating and provides players and charac-

ters with unexpected challenges.

As long as the DM is part of the decision to add a tem-

plate to a player character, he or she should be ready for

that characters new abilities. In fact, a player character

with a template is little different from any other monster

character.

WHEN TO ADD

Some templates can be added to creatures at any time. A

monster or character may become a ghost after death. A

spellcaster of at least 11th level can become a lich. A crea-

ture with 5 or more HD killed by a vampire may become a

vampire. Such templates are called acquired templates.

Other templates, such as the celestial, fiendish, half-celes-

tial, half-dragon, and half-fiend, assume that the crea-

ture or character was born with the changes indi-

cated. Templates such as these are called inherited

templates. Its possible for a template to be of either

type. For example, lycanthropy can afflict anyone

the template description allows at any point, but

some creatures are born lycanthropes.

Challenge Rating and level adjustment changes

assume that the template is added on top of a mon-

ster  or  a  character,  whether  it  is  inherited  or

acquired. When adding any template, simply build

a monster normally and then add the template on

top. Do not bother regressing the monster back to

1 HD (see Chapter 3: Classes), adding the tem-

plate, and then advancing again.

A character desiring an acquired template can

add it when the character meets the qualifica-

tions of the template. For instance, a character

can acquire the lycanthrope template when

bitten by a lycanthrope. In such a case, add the

template on top of class levels, monster Hit

Dice, and so forth. If a player wants an existing

character to obtain an inherited template part-

way through his or her adventuring career, see

Chapter 11: Becoming a Monster. As a rule, how-

ever, such a decision should be made when the

character is created.

AS

READING TEMPLATES

A template provides a set of instructions for altering an

existing creature, called the base creature. The following

text goes through a statistics block, line by line, to explain

how templates affect each line.

Missing Entry: If a template lacks one of the following

entries, the template uses the base creatures entry in that

category.

Size and Type: Templates often change creature type and

may change creature size.

Hit Dice and Hit Points: If the Hit Dice entry for the

template is missing, then Hit Dice and hit points do not

change unless the Constitution modifier changes.

Some templates change the size of the Hit Die (usually as

a consequence of changing the creature type). A few tem-

plates completely change previously acquired Hit Dice, and

continue to change Hit Dice gained with class levels. Some

templates change only the creatures original Hit Dice and

leave class Hit Dice unchanged.

Templates in italic are described later in this chapter.

Since monsters use average hit points, changing the die

type changes their hit point total.

d20

Average Hit Points

2.5

3.5

4.5

5.5

6.5

10.5

Notice that every 2 points of difference between the size of

one die and another changes average hit points by 1. For

example, a d6 is 2 points larger than a d4, so the difference

between the average hit points of a d6 and a d4 is 1. Also, a

d12 is 8 points larger than a d4, so the difference between

the average hit points of a d4 and a d12 is 4. The number of

Hit Dice a monster has equals the number of hit points it

gains when its Hit Die size increases one step, or loses when

its Hit Die size decreases one step. If the size increases two

steps, multiply the number of Hit Dice by 2 to get the addi-

tional hit points, and so on. If the size of the die decreases,

then the number of Hit Dice it has is the number of points

it loses. If you are more comfortable multiplying the

number of Hit Dice by the new average hit points, just do

that.

If the creatures Hit Die type changes, any bonuses it

receives from Constitution still apply. However, the tem-

plate may adjust Constitution score, so be sure to use the

new score when calculating hit points.

Initiative: If the template changes the monsters Dexter-

ity, or if it adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this

entry changes.

Speed: If a template modifies a creatures speed, the tem-

plate states how that happens. More commonly, the tem-

plate adds a new movement type, such as flying.

AC: If the template changes the creatures size, see Crea-

ture Sizes in the introduction of the Monster Manual for its

effect on Armor Class. Changes in Dexterity and natural

armor may also occur because of a template. In some cases,

such as with ghosts, the method of determining Armor

Class changes radically. If that happens, the template

explains how to change the Armor Class.

Attacks: Templates do not change base attack bonuses.

Of course, any change in ability scores may affect attack

bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the new

modifier for the attack bonuses. A change in the monsters

size also changes its attack. Creature Sizes in the Introduc-

tion of the Monster Manual gives the change.

Damage: Damage changes with Strength. If the creature

uses a two-handed weapon or has a single natural weapon, it

adds 1 1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage. If it has

more than a single attack, such as a character with two

weapons or a monster with claws and bite, then it adds its

Strength bonus to the primary damage and 1/2 its Strength

bonus to all others.

Face/Reach: A template may change this entry if it

changes the monsters size. The typical face and reach for

monsters of each size category appears below. This table

does not take into account special situations such as a

ropers tentacles.

2 Big, long creatures may be in any of several shapes. A Huge

spider fills a 15-foot-square area, while a Huge snake fills a

space 30 feet long and 5 feet wide (unless it coils itself into a

circle, in which case it would take up a 15-foot-square area).

See Chapter 5: Equipment for how to adjust weapon

damage, reach, range, and so forth with size.

Special Attacks: Templates may add or subtract special

attacks. The template contains the text for the effects of the

special attacks, including how to determine saving throw

DCs, if applicable.

Special Qualities: Templates may add or subtract special

qualities. The template contains the text for the effects of

the special qualities, including how to determine saving

throw DCs, if applicable. Some monster types, such as ele-

mental and undead, come with their own set of special qual-

ities. Even if this entry is missing, the creature gains the

special qualities associated with its new type (as noted in

the Monster Manual).

Base Saves: As with attacks, changing a monster type

does not change its base saving throw bonuses. You only

need to adjust them for new modifiers from Constitution,

Dexterity, or Wisdom. If the Saves entry is missing, the

saving throw progression does not change. A template may,

however, state that a monster has a different good saving

throw.

Abilities: After reading this far, you can see why it is so

important to adjust these scores first. Not all templates

modify them. In some templates this entry is missing

(because ability scores do not change), which simplifies the

process.

You determine a templates racial ability score modifiers

by adding them to the base creatures ability score modi-

fiers. For example:

creature type. Since templates dont change the number of

Hit Dice a creature has, you dont need to adjust skills in

that case unless the key abilities changed, the template

gives a bonus on one or more skills, or the template gives a

feat that provides a skill bonus.

If this entry changes how skill points are determined, it

only affects skill points gained after the template is applied.

Treat skills listed for the base creature as class skills, as

well as new skills provided by the template.

Feats: When this entry is missing, the creature has the

feats of the base creature or class levels rather than the feats

of any new creature type. Since most templates do not

change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a template

should not change the number of feats a creature has.

If this entry changes how feats are determined, it affects

only feats acquired after the template is applied.

Climate/Terrain: This entry has no effect on characters,

unless their players wish to roleplay any discomfort or

enjoyment based on their surroundings. The DM needs to

make sure that a template does not remove the monster

from the adventure, however. Most templates do not

change this entry. If one does, use the information provided

in the template entry.

Organization: This entry has no effect on characters.

The DM needs to adjust the encounter if the template

changes the monsters associates and subordinates. Most

templates do not change this entry. If one does, use the

information provided in the template entry.

Challenge Rating: This entry has no effect on charac-

ters. Most templates increase the creatures Challenge

Rating. The template might give a modifier to be added to

the base creatures Challenge Rating, or it might specify a

range of modifiers depending on the base creatures original

Hit Dice or Challenge Rating. The DM adjusts the mon-

sters Challenge Rating according to this entry and makes

any  necessary  changes  to  the  encounter  to  keep  the

encounter challenging without becoming instantly fatal.

See Chapter 9: Advancing Monsters for guidelines on esti-

mating new Challenge Ratings.

Treasure: This entry has no effect on characters. Most

templates do not change this entry. If one does, the DM

adjusts a monsters possessions and treasure according to

the information provided in the template entry.

Skills: When this entry is missing, the creature has the

skill points of the base creature type rather than as any new

Alignment: Most templates do not change this entry. If

one does, use the information provided in the template

FREAK OR FAUNA

A templated creature can represent a freak of nature, the indi-

vidual creation of a single experimenter, or the first generation

of offspring from parents of different species.

Alternatively, you can use templates as tools for creating new

monsters.  In  this  sense,  templates  represent  an  easy  way  to

create  an  entirely  new  species  of  monster  significant  in  your

campaign. Pick a base creature with features and appearance

appropriate  to  what  you  are  creating  and  add  the  templates

you need to make it your monster. Give it a new name, and you

are done.

pqqqqrs

For  example,  you  might  want  ghostly  creatures  that

protect the burial grounds of vampires (or, alternatively, of

blessed people whose rest should not be disturbed). Dogs

are  often  associated  with  guarding  places,  but  you  want

something  a  bit  tougher,  so  you  choose  wolf  as  the  base

creature  and  apply  the  ghost  brute  template  found  later  in

this  chapter.  You  call  the  resulting  creature  a  spectral

hound,  and  your  player  characters  know  when  they

encounter  spectral  hounds  that  a  special  burial  site  is

nearby.  Now  you  have  a  monster  to  help  make  your

campaign unique and memorable.

entry. The DM needs to make sure there is still a reason for

the monster and characters to interact after alignment

changes.

Advancement: Most templates do not change this entry.

If one does, use the information provided in the template

entry. If the template changes the monsters method of

advancement from by type to by character class, or vice

versa, it says so here. The DM must check this if he or she is

combining adding a template with advancing a monster. If

so, use the templates advancement method.

Level Adjustment: The level adjustment entry is a mod-

ifier to the base creatures level adjustment. A level adjust-

ment is meaningless unless the creature retains enough

Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels after applying

the template.

ADDING A TEMPLATE, STEP BY STEP

If the template changes the base creatures size, use the Size

Increases table in the introduction of the Monster Manual to

calculate changes to natural armor, Armor Class, and attack

rolls. Check the text of the template to see if you apply size

modifiers to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. The

Abilities line may already account for those.

Add all ability score modifiers, from size and the Abilities

line, from the template to the base creatures ability scores.

When you know the new Constitution modifier and any

change to Hit Die size, recalculate the templated monsters

hit points. See Hit Dice and Hit Points, above.

The new Constitution modifier also modifies the Fortitude

saving throw modifier and any skill bonus for Concentration.

Check for Great Fortitude or any other feat that affects the

Fortitude saving throw modifier and apply them now.

When you know the new Dexterity modifier, recalculate

the Initiative bonus and Armor Class bonus. Apply modi-

fiers for size and natural armor at this time. Check for

Improved Initiative and any other feat that affects Initiative

and apply them now.

Check to see if either the base creature or the templated

creature uses Weapon Finesse with one or more of its

attacks. If it does, use the new Dexterity modifier to recal-

culate the attack bonus. Apply any size modifiers at the

same time.

The new Dexterity modifier also modifies the Reflex saving

throw modifier and any skills with Dexterity as a key ability.

Check for Lightning Reflexes or any other feat that affects the

Reflex saving throw modifier and apply them now.

When you know the new Strength modifier, check to see

if either the base creature or the templated creature uses

Weapon Finesse. For all attacks that do not use Weapon

Finesse, use the new Strength modifier to recalculate attack

bonus. Apply any size modifiers at the same time.

The new Strength modifier affects damage and any skills

with Strength as the key ability.

When you know the new Intelligence modifier, recalcu-

late skill modifiers for any skills that use Intelligence as the

key ability.

When you know the new Wisdom modifier, recalculate

the Will saving throw modifiers and the skill modifiers for

any skills that use Wisdom as the key ability. Check for Iron

Will or any other feat that affects the Will saving throw

modifier and apply them now.

For all special abilities of the base creature that remain,

recalculate saving throw DCs (special abilities from the

template tell you how to calculate their DCs). The formula

for most save DCs is 10 + 1/2 the creatures Hit Dice + the

relevant ability score modifier of the creature using the

attack. Use only the creatures monster Hit Dice for this cal-

culation; do not include Hit Dice gained from class levels.

The relevant ability scores for save DCs against various

types of attacks or effects are as follows.

Strength: Any application of force, crushing, binding, or

constriction.

Dexterity: Movement, movement restrictions, hitting

with a missile, entanglement, webs.

Constitution: Almost anything that comes from the crea-

tures body; poison, breath weapons.

Intelligence: Illusion effects.

Wisdom: Mental or perception effects (except charms and

compulsions, see Charisma).

Charisma: The creatures Charisma modifier affects the

save DC for any spell-like abilities it has. Use the Charisma

modifier for any attack or effect that pits the creatures will

against an opponent: gaze attacks, charms, compulsions,

energy drain. Also use the Charisma modifier for any DC

that normally would be based on an ability score the crea-

ture does not have. For example, undead creatures have no

Constitution score, so any poison attacks they have would

use their Charisma modifier to determine the save DC.

Always use the Charisma modifier for spell-like abilities.

NEW MONSTER TEMPLATES

The template is a valuable tool for the would-be monster

builder. By overlaying a template on a creature, you can

create a completely new range of interesting possibilities.

The Monster Manual explores a few monstrous templates.

This section offers some new choices.

TEMPLATE CHARACTERS

Many Monster Manual entries contain information on char-

acter classes common to a monster kind, and on preferred

classes for that time. For instance, bugbear characters pre-

ferred class is rogue. Because templates can apply to many

different kinds of monsters, the character entry for a tem-

plate has to be more vague. Suggestions appear below for all

templates that can be applied to characters.

TEMPLATES AND LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS

As pointed out in Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters,

level adjustments given for templates combine with the

level adjustment of the base creature to give the level

adjustment for a templated monster. For instance, a bug-

bear has a +1 level adjustment and 3 Hit Dice. The ghost

template has a +5 level adjustment. Therefore, a ghost bug-

bear has a +6 level adjustment, 3d12 for Hit Dice, and a

starting ECL of 9.

Templates often apply to monsters that cannot, or should

not, be characters (for instance, because their Intelligence

is too low). Level adjustments for such templates only apply

if the resulting templated monster can be a character. In

cases when a template makes an otherwise unplayable crea-

ture into a viable character (such as the incarnate construct

template), this book gives level adjustments for the tem-

plated version of the creature.

FERAL CREATURE

Feral creatures were once civilized but have now sunk into

a primitive, barbarous state. Though they are generally

found deep in the harsh wilderness, feral creatures occa-

sionally wander into more civilized areas. Some eventually

adapt, but most consider civilization too confining.

Feral creatures appear larger, tougher, and meaner than

their more sophisticated cousins. Their feral nature tends to

be obvious from their

pronounced fangs

and  claws.  They

speak  the  same

languages as the

base creatures from

which they were

derived.

SAMPLE FERAL CREATURE

This example uses a minotaur

as the base creature.

Climate/Terrain: Any underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, or gang (34)

Treasure: 50% coins, standard goods and items, no scrolls

Alignment: Usually chaotic evil

Advancement: By character class

Feral minotaurs exist in the deepest, most forbidding

underground realms. Those few who locate other mino-

taurs often dominate them and become leaders. Feral mino-

taurs prize weapons and armor suited for their size, and

possession of such signifies the leader of any particular

group.

Combat

Feral minotaurs prefer melee combat, where their great

Strength serves them well. In particular they enjoy pounc-

ing on adventurers foolish enough to enter their domains,

in the hope of gaining the adventurers weapons.

Charge (Ex): A feral minotaur typically begins a battle

by charging at an opponent, lowering its head to bring its

mighty horns into play. In addition to the normal benefits

and hazards of a charge, this allows the creature to make a

single gore attack that deals 4d6+9 points of damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a feral minotaur

hits a Medium-size or smaller oppo-

nent with a claw attack, it

deals normal damage

and attempts to start

a grapple as a free

action  without

provoking  an

attack of oppor-

tunity (grapple

bonus +16). If

it  gets  a

hold, it has

the option

to conduct

the grapple

normally, or

simply  use  its

claw to hold the

opponent (20

penalty on grapple

check, but the feral

minotaur is not considered grappled). In either case, each

successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds

automatically deals claw damage.

Pounce (Ex): If a feral minotaur leaps upon a foe during

the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even

though it has moved.

Fast Healing (Ex): A feral minotaur regains lost hit

points at the rate of 3 per round. Fast healing does not

restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation,

and it does not allow the feral minotaur to regrow or reat-

tach lost body parts.

Natural Cunning (Ex): Although feral minotaurs are

not especially intelligent, they possess innate cunning

and logical ability. This makes them immune to maze

spells,  prevents  them  from  ever  becoming  lost,  and

enables them to track enemies. Further, they are never

caught flat-footed.

Scent (Ex): A feral minotaur can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Skills: A feral minotaur receives a +4 racial bonus on

Search, Spot, and Listen checks.

CREATING A FERAL CREATURE

Feral creature is an inherited template that can be added to

any corporeal humanoid or monstrous humanoid (referred

to hereafter as the base creature). A feral creature has all the

base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: Creatures with this template become

monstrous humanoids if they are not already.

Hit Dice: Change to d10.

Speed: Land speed +10 ft., other movement modes

Each successful attack does normal claw damage for that

size of feral creature, plus 1/2 its Strength bonus (rounded

down). If the feral creature pounces on an opponent, it can

also rake.

Rend (Ex): A feral creature that hits with both claw attacks

latches onto the opponents body and tears the flesh. This

automatically deals double the appropriate claw damage for

that size feral creature, plus double the Strength modifier.

Special Qualities: A feral creature gains additional spe-

cial qualities depending on its Hit Dice, as shown on the

table below. If the base creature possesses a duplicate ability,

the feral creature has whichever ability is better.

Attacks: A feral creature gains two claw attacks if it did

not already have them.

Damage: The base damage for a feral creatures claw

attack varies with its size as follows: Fine 1d2, Diminutive

1d3, Tiny 1d4, Small 1d6, Medium-size 1d8, Large 2d6,

Huge 2d8, Gargantuan 4d6, Colossal 4d8. If the base crea-

ture already has a claw attack, the feral creature uses the

better base damage.

Special Attacks: A feral creature gains additional special

attacks depending on its Hit Dice, as shown on the table

below. It gains the special attacks indicated in the row cor-

responding to its monster Hit Dice, plus all those in previ-

ous rows. If the base creature possesses a duplicate ability,

the feral creature uses whichever version of the ability is

better.

FERAL CHARACTERS

Feral characters with class levels usually have levels of bar-

barian, and barbarian is their preferred class. Some multi-

class to cleric, druid, or ranger. Few ever become bards, pal-

adins, wizards, or sorcerers.

GELATINOUS CREATURE

Perverted magic is the only explanation for these bizarre

blends with the characteristics of oozes. Translucent and

unstable in form, gelatinous creatures benefit from oozes

distinct strengthsbut also some of their drawbacks.

Improved Grab (Ex): If a feral creature hits an opponent

that is at least one size category smaller than itself with a

claw attack, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If it gets a hold, it can rake if it has that ability

(see below). Alternatively, it has the option to conduct the

grapple normally, or simply use its claw to hold the oppo-

nent (20 penalty on grapple check, but the feral creature is

not considered grappled). In either case, each successful

grapple check it makes during successive rounds automati-

cally deals claw damage. See the Monster Manual for addi-

tional rules.

Pounce (Ex): If a feral creature leaps upon a foe during the

first round of combat, it can make a full attack even though

it has already moved.

Rake (Ex): A feral creature that gets a hold can make two

rake attacks at its full melee attack bonus with its hind legs.

CREATING A GELATINOUS CREATURE

Gelatinous creature is an inherited template that can be

added to any living creature except an ooze (hereafter

referred to as the base creature). A gelatinous creature

has all the base creatures characteristics except as

noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes

to aberration.

Hit Dice: Increase to d10.

Speed: Due to its somewhat amor-

phous nature, the gelatinous creature

moves  at  half  the  base  creatures

speed or 20 feet, whichever is lower.

If the base creature can fly, the gelat-

inous creature loses the ability to do

so. If the base creature can swim or

climb, the gelatinous creature re-

tains the ability to do so, but at half

the previous speed.

AC: Natural armor bonus 2.

Attacks: The gelatinous creature

gains a slam attack if it did not already

have one. This slam is a secondary

attack.

Damage: Gelatinous  creatures

have slam attacks. If the base creature

did not have this attack form, use the

damage values in the table below. If it

has a natural slam attack, use its old

damage rating or the one given below,

whichever is better. Since the slam

is  a  secondary  attack,  the

damage bonus is 1/2 the gelat-

adjustment.

GHOST BRUTE

Ghost brutes are the spectral remnants of animals, magical

beasts, and sentient plantscreatures without the mini-

mum Charisma needed to become normal ghosts. They

drift aimlessly, haunting the places where they died and

moaning in endless misery.

A ghost brute most often results from the circumstances

that caused its earthly companion or master to remain after

death. It might be the mount of a betrayed paladin, the

beloved pet of a child tragically killed, the scorched oak of a

ghostly dryad, or a murdered druids animal companion.

Generally, laying the associated being to rest also puts an

end to the ghost brute.

Sometimes, though, a bizarre circumstance might pro-

duce a ghost brute without an intelligent companion. For

example, a forest suddenly obliterated by a fell magical

attack might remain as a ghostly grove populated by lin-

gering spirits not even completely aware of their own

destruction.

Combat

Against ethereal opponents, a ghost hound can bring to

bear its vicious bite, which also deals negative energy

damage.

Slavering Doom (Su): A ghost hounds jaws drip with

glowing ectoplasmic drool. The ectoplasm dissipates on

contact with nonliving material, but if it touches a living

being, that opponent must make a successful Fortitude save

or take 1d6 points of negative energy damage. The drool

might be delivered through a bite attack or simply sprayed

onto a nearby creature.

Incorporeal: A ghost hound can be harmed only by

other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

spells, and spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The

creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a cor-

poreal source, except for force effects or attacks made with

ghost touch weapons. A ghost hound can pass through

solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore

natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses

and force effects work normally against them. A ghost

hound always moves silently and cannot be heard with

Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Manifestation (Su): As an ethereal creature, a ghost

hound cannot affect or be affected by anything in the mate-

rial world. When it manifests, the ghost hound becomes

visible but remains incorporeal. A manifested ghost hound

remains on the Ethereal Plane but can be attacked by oppo-

nents on both the Material and Ethereal planes.

Rejuvenation (Su): A ghost hound that would other-

wise be destroyed returns to its old haunts in 2d4 days with

a successful level check (1d20 + 2) against DC 16.

A ghost hound is tied more closely to other beings than

more intelligent spirits. Often it is the companion of a

ghostly being, but it may also become fascinated with or

enraged by a living creature that intrudes on its domain. It

always returns to the object of its attachment rather than to

a set location.

Scent (Ex): A ghost hound can detect approaching ene-

mies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A ghost hound

is treated as an undead with 4 Hit Dice

for the purpose of turn, rebuke, com-

mand, and bolster attempts.

Undead:  A  ghost  hound

is immune to mind-affect-

ing effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning,

disease,  death  ef-

fects,  necromantic

effects, and any effect

that  requires  a  For-

titude  save  unless

it  also  works  on

objects.  It  is  not  sub-

ject  to  critical  hits,

subdual  damage,

ability  damage,

ability drain, en-

ergy drain, or death from massive damage. A ghost hound

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is will-

ing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: A ghost hound gains a +8 racial bonus on Hide,

Listen, Search, and Spot checks. *It also has a +8 racial

bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent.

CREATING A GHOST BRUTE

Ghost brute is an acquired template that can be added to

any animal, magical beast, or plant with a Charisma score

below 8 (hereafter referred to as the base creature). The

creature follows the rules for ghosts (see the Monster

Manual) except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead,

and it takes the incorporeal subtype.

Hit Dice: Increase to d12.

Speed: A ghost brute has a fly speed of 30 feet, unless

the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect

maneuverability.

AC: Natural armor bonus is the same as the base crea-

tures but applies only to ethereal encounters. When the

ghost brute manifests (see below), its natural armor bonus

is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma

modifier or +1, whichever is higher.

Attacks: A ghost brute retains all the attacks of the base

creature, although those relying on physical contact do not

affect nonethereal creatures.

Damage: Against ethereal creatures, a ghost brute uses

the base creatures damage ratings. Against nonethereal

creatures,  a  ghost  brute  usually  cannot  deal  physical

damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it

manifests (see below).

Special Attacks: A ghost brute retains all the special

attacks of the base creature, although those relying on phys-

ical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost

brute also gains one special attack selected from the list

below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 ghost brutes HD + ghost

brutes Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.

Bloodcurdling Howl (Su): The mournful howling of a ghost

brute chills the living to the core. The creature can howl as

a standard action. All living

creatures within a 30-

foot  radius  must

succeed  on  a

Will save or

become

frightened

for 2d4 rounds;

those  more

than 30 feet

away but

w i t h i n

300 feet must

succeed  on  a

Will  save  or

become shaken

for 2d4 rounds. This

is a sonic, necro-

mantic, mind-affect-

ing fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the

bloodcurdling howl cannot be affected by the same ghost

brutes howl for one day.

Corrupting Touch (Su): A ghost brute that hits a living

target with its corrupting touch attack deals 1d4 points of

damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength

modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against material oppo-

nents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.

Loom (Su): A ghost brute can make itself more intimi-

dating by exaggerating its natural size. It can appear up

to two sizes larger than normal for 10 minutes each day,

which need not be continuous. This enlargement is illu-

sory; the creatures attack bonus and Armor Class remain

unchanged. However, the ghost brute gains a +4 circum-

stance  bonus  on  Bluff  and  Intimidate  checks  while

enlarged.

Slavering Doom (Su): A ghost brutes jaws drip with a glow-

ing ectoplasmic drool that exists in both ethereal and cor-

poreal form. The ectoplasm dissipates on contact with non-

living  material,  but  if  it  touches  a  living  being,  that

opponent must make a successful Fortitude save or take

1d6 points of negative energy damage. The drool can be

delivered through a bite attack against an ethereal oppo-

nent, or a melee touch attack against an opponent on the

Material Plane. Alternatively, the drool can simply be

sprayed onto a nearby creature as a ranged touch attack.

Special Qualities: A ghost brute gains the three special

qualities described below..

Manifestation (Su): As ethereal creatures, ghost brutes

cannot affect or be affected by anything in the material

world. When they manifest, ghost brutes become visible

but remain incorporeal. However, a manifested ghost brute

can strike with a touch attack, if it has one, or a ghost touch

weapon (if it can wield a weapon). A manifested ghost brute

remains on the Ethereal Plane but can be attacked by oppo-

nents on both the Material and Ethereal planes.

Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, it is difficult to destroy

a ghost brute through simple combat. The destroyed

spirit often restores itself in 2d4 days. A ghost brute that

would otherwise

be destroyed re-

turns to its old

haunts  with  a

s u c c e s s f u l

level  check

(1d20 + ghost

b r u t es H D )

against DC 16.

As  a  rule,  the

only way to get

rid  of  a  ghost

brute for sure is

to  determine

the  reason  for

its existence and

set  right  what-

ever  prevents  it

from resting in

peace.  The

exact means

varies with

each spirit and

may require a

good deal of

research.

A ghost brute is tied more closely to other beings than

more intelligent spirits. Often it is the companion of a

ghostly being, but it may also become fascinated with or

enraged by a living creature that intrudes on its domain. It

always returns to the object of its attachment rather than to

a set location.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A ghost brute has +2 turn resistance.

Abilities: Same as the base creatures, except that the

ghost brute has no Constitution score, and its Charisma

score increases by +8. It has no Strength score for the pur-

pose of fighting creatures on the Material Plane, but its

Strength score is the same as the base creatures against

ethereal opponents.

Skills: A ghost brute receives a +8 racial bonus on Hide,

Listen, Search, and Spot checks.

Organization: Solitary or with associated ghost, or same

as the base creature.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +2.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Usually neutra.l

Level Adjustment: +5.

INCARNATE CONSTRUCT

An incarnate construct is a construct creature that has been

given actual life and a living body by the incarnate construct

spell.

Made of flesh and bone, it has a mind and feelings like

any true creature; it is no longer the automaton it was cre-

ated to be. An incarnate construct looks like a living version

of its former self, having normal flesh instead of inanimate

material and showing emotion instead of coldly pro-

grammed servitude. Any unusual limbs it had as a construct

(such  as  arms  that  end  in  mallets

instead of hands, but not wings

or  a  tail)  become  normal

humanlike limbs propor-

An  incarnate  con-

An  incarnate

one awakens from its unliving state with knowledge of its

liberators language.

CREATING AN INCARNATE CONSTRUCT

Incarnate construct is an acquired template that can be

applied  to  any  construct  creature  with  a  generally

humanoid formtwo arms, two legs, one head (hereafter

referred to as the base creature). An incarnate construct has

all the base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type:  The creatures type changes to humanoid

if it is Medium-size or smaller, or giant if it is Large or

larger.

Hit Dice: The creatures Hit Die type changes to d8.

Speed: If Small or smaller, land speed is 20 feet. If

Medium-size, land speed is 30 feet. If Large or larger, land

speed is 40 feet. If the base creature had wings and could

fly, use the base creatures fly speed and maneuverability.

AC: The base creatures natural armor bonus is reduced to

a maximum of +3 if Medium-size or smaller, otherwise

reduced to a maximum of +9.

Attacks: An incarnate constructs base attack bonus is

normal for a construct of its Hit Dice. An incarnate con-

struct loses all its original attacks. It may attack with

unarmed strikes in the manner of a creature similar to its

size and shape.

Damage: The damage from its unarmed strike is standard

for its size. For example, a Medium-size incarnate construct

can deal 1d3 points of subdual damage with an unarmed

strike; a Large incarnate construct can deal 1d4 points.

Special Attacks: The base creature loses all its special

attacks.

Special Qualities: The base creature loses all its special

qualities.

Base Saves: An incarnate constructs good saving throw

is Fortitude. Its poor saving throws are Reflex and Will.

Abilities: Any ability score lower than 3 is increased to 3,

and nonabilities such as Constitution and Intelligence are

rolled (4d6, drop lowest result).

Skills: An incarnate construct gains no skill points for

becoming a living creature, but if it gains levels, it acquires

skill points normally.

Feats: An incarnate construct has no feats when it becomes

a living creature, but if it gains levels, it acquires feats normally.

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary (alone or with its spellcaster lib-

erator).

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR divided by 2.

Treasure: Standard (initially none).

Alignment: Usually neutral.

Advancement: By character class.

Level Adjustment: 2 (minimum 0).

INCARNATE CONSTRUCT CHARACTERS

Because they usually possess excellent physical ability

scores, incarnate constructs usually become fighters or

rangers. Their preferred class is fighter.

INSECTILE CREATURE

Insectile creatures possess the multiple limbs and eyes of

vermin, as well as the hard, chitinous shells shared by many

vermin. Despite their alien appearance, insectile creatures

are often welcome among other races because of their

industrious nature. Insectile creatures often worship Lolth,

the most insectlike of the deities, but they also worship the

gods of the humans.

An insectile creature is of average height and weight

for the base creature from which it is derived. Its chitin

may be of any color, but the most common shades are

black, green, tan, or yellow. Ridges, bumps, spots, and

stripes all serve to differentiate insectile nations from

each other.

An insectile creature speaks the same languages as the

base creature, and a large number of them speak Terran or

Undercommon in addition.

SAMPLE INSECTILE CREATURE

This example uses an ogre as the base creature.

Advancement: By character class

Insectile ogres are big, ugly, greedy creatures that live by

raiding and scavenging. They join other monsters to prey

on the weak and associate freely with ogres, ogre mages,

giants, and trolls.

Most communities fear insectile ogres far more than

ogres because they are so much more industrious. They

solve problems by smashing them; what they cannot

smash, they either ignore or flee. Dwelling in small groups,

insectile ogres occupy any convenient location and quickly

eat nearly anything they can catch, steal, or slay. Insectile

ogres sometimes accept mercenary service with other evil

humanoids (including humans).

Adult insectile ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300

to 350 pounds. Their chitin color ranges from dull yellow to

dull brown. Their natural armor is usually covered in dark,

warty bumps. Their clothing consists of

poorly  cured  furs  and  hides,

which  add  to  their  naturally

repellent odor.

Insectile  ogres  speak  Giant,

and  those  specimens  that  boast  a

Intelligence  score  of  at  least  10

also speak Common.

Combat

Insectile  ogres  favor  overwhelming

odds, sneak attacks, and ambush-

es  over  a  fair  fight.  They  are

intelligent  enough  to  fire

ranged  weapons  first  to

soften up their foes before

closing,  but  ogre  gangs

and  bands  fight  as  unor-

ganized groups.

Tremorsense  (Ex):  Insec-

tile ogres can automatically sense

the  location  of  anything

within  60  feet  that  is  in

contact  with  the  same

surface they are.

Wide  Vision  (Ex):

Because  of  their  multiple

eyes and wide angle of vision, in-

sectile ogres have a +4 racial bonus

on Spot checks and cannot be flanked.

CREATING AN INSECTILE CREATURE

Insectile is an inherited template that can be added to any

giant,  humanoid,  or  monstrous  humanoid  (hereafter

referred to as the base creature). An insectile creature is a

biped, and it gains four more arms. It has all the base crea-

tures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to aberration.

Speed: An insectile creature gains a climb speed equal to

its land speed.

AC: Because of the insectile creatures chitinous shell, the

base creatures natural armor bonus increases by +2.

Attacks: Despite having six arms, insectile creatures gain

no additional attacks.

Special Qualities: An insectile creature gains dark-

vision (60-foot range) if it did not already have it, as well as

tremorsense and wide vision.

Tremorsense (Ex): An insectile creature can automatically

sense the location of anything within 60 feet that is in con-

tact with the ground.

122

Wide Vision (Ex): Because of its multiple eyes and wide

angle of vision, an insectile creature has a +4 racial bonus on

Spot checks and cannot be flanked.

Abilities: +4 Dex, +2 Wis.

Climate/Terrain: Same as the base creature, but never

aquatic.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +1.

Level Adjustment: +2.

INSECTILE CHARACTERS

Insectile characters preferred class is rogue. Some

become druids or clerics, but most take advantage

of their high Dexterity scores and their

climbing abilities by advancing as

rogues.

MONSTROUS

BEAST

Strange  creatures  wander

the world, the byproducts of

weird  experimentation,  natu-

ral calamity, or twisted cou-

plings. A monstrous beast is

an  otherwise  normal  crea-

ture  that  has  gained  a  mon-

strous ability.

SAMPLE

MONSTROUS BEAST

This example uses a giant stag

beetle as the base creature.

ground

Organization: Solitary

Challenge Rating: 5

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always neutral

Advancement: 810 HD (Large); 1121 HD (Huge)

Combat

Trample (Ex): As a standard action during its turn each

round, a monstrous stag beetle can trample opponents at

least one size category smeller than itself. This attack deals

2d8+9 points of bludgeoning damage. A trampled opponent

can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a 4 penalty

or a Reflex save (DC 19) for half damage.

Breath Weapon (Su): A monstrous stag beetle can

breathe a 30-foot cone of fire for 2d8 points of fire damage

(Reflex half DC 16). Once it has used its breath weapon, it

must wait 2d4 rounds before it can do so again.

Vermin Traits: A monstrous stag beetle is immune to all

mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,

patterns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision (60-foot

range).

Fire Subtype (Ex): A monstrous stag beetle is immune

to fire damage and takes a 10 penalty on saves against cold

attacks. If a cold attack does not allow a saving throw, the

creature takes double damage instead.

CREATING A MONSTROUS BEAST

Monstrous is an inherited template that can be added to

any animal or vermin (here-

after referred to as the base

creature).  A  monstrous

beast has all the base crea-

tures characteristics except

as noted here.

Size and Type: The crea-

tures type changes to magi-

cal beast.

Special Attacks: A mon-

strous beast gains one spe-

cial attack chosen from

those  given  below.

Each ability specifies a

key ability score modifier

used to deter-

mine the DC of

saving throws, the

type of saving throw,

and a minimum Chal-

lenge  Rating.  The

base  creatures  CR

must  be  at  least  this

high for the monstrous

beast to take the associ-

ated special attack.

Saving throws against the attack

have a DC of 10 + 1/2 monstrous beasts

HD + key ability score modifier.

Breath Weapon (Su): The key ability

score for a breath weapon is Constitution, a successful

Reflex save halves the damage, and the minimum CR to

qualify for the ability depends on the base creatures size,

according to the table below. Once every 2d4 rounds, a

monstrous beast can breathe a 30-foot cone of energy

(choose from cold, fire, or sonic). If you choose cold or fire,

the creature also gains the corresponding subtype as a spe-

cial quality (see below). If you choose sonic, the creature is

blind but gains the blindsight special quality (see below).

Any creature hit by the breath weapon is allowed a Reflex

save for half damage.

Challenge Rating to qualify for the ability is 1. This ability

functions like a charm monster spell (caster level equal to Hit

Dice; range 30 feet).

Petrifying Gaze (Su): The key ability score for petrifying

gaze is Wisdom, a successful Fortitude save negates the

effect, and the minimum Challenge Rating to qualify

for the ability is 5. Any

creature within 30 feet

that  meets  the  mon-

strous beasts gaze turns

to stone.

Poison  (Ex):  The  key

ability  score  for  poison

is  Constitution,  a  suc-

cessful  Fortitude  save

negates the effect, and

the  minimum  Chal-

S p e c i a l

Qualities:

A monstrous

beast  gains  one

special quality

chosen  from  those

given  below.  If  the

creature has already selected a special attack

that provides a specific special quality, it gains no

additional ones.

Blindsight (Ex): A monstrous beast can ascertain its sur-

roundings by nonvisual means (mostly hearing and scent,

but also by noticing vibrations and other environmental

clues). This ability enables it to discern objects and crea-

tures within 100 feet. A sonic breath weapon provides this

special quality.

Damage Reduction (Ex): A Small or smaller monstrous

beast gains damage reduction 5/+1. A Medium-size to Huge

creature gains damage reduction 10/+1. A Huge or larger

creature gains damage reduction 15/+1.

123

Telepathy (Su): A monstrous beast can communicate tele-

pathically with all creatures within 100 feet that have a lan-

guage, and with all associated creatures. (For example, a

monstrous cat can communicate with other felines.)

Circle of Protection (Sp): The creature is continuously

affected by a circle of protection effect against chaos, evil,

good, or law (choose one).

Elemental Subtype (Ex): A monstrous beast gains the cold

or fire subtype. A cold or fire breath weapon provides this

special quality.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +1.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Always neutral.

Level Adjustment: +2.

MULTIHEADED CREATURE

Be they freaks of nature, the results of arcane experimen-

tation, or simply new races, some creatures have more

heads than common examples of their kind. Many multi-

headed creatures are actually crossbreeds with some level

of hydra blood magically infused into them. All multi-

headed creatures are more powerful and dangerous than

similar creatures with fewer heads, and many

become local legends.

It  is  not  unusual  for  multi-

headed creatures to be

trained as guards and

sentries,  since

their increased

number of eyes and

noses makes

them  well

equipped  for

such tasks. How-

ever, a creatures

heads do not al-

ways get along,

and this can

make  such

monsters

extremely  un-

predictable.

In  many

cases, a multi-

headed creature is simply

forced into a lair close to some stronghold, perhaps cover-

ing one of its secret entrances, to serve as a guard.

SAMPLE MULTIHEADED CREATURE

This sample uses an 8 HD advanced hell hound as the base

creature.

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always lawful evil

Combat

A hellish guardian hound prefers to use its breath weap-

on to soften up foes, then enter melee combat with its

bite attacks.

Breath Weapon (Su): Each of the creatures two heads

may breathe a 30-foot cone

of fire every 2d4 rounds.

This attack deals 1d4+1

points of fire damage

(Reflex DC 20 half ).

The fiery breath also

ignites any flamma-

ble materials within

the cone. Both heads

may breathe at

once, and the

creature can

use its breath

weapon while

biting.

Fire Subtype

(Ex): A  hellish

guardian hound is im-

mune  to  fire  damage

and  takes  a  10  penalty  on

saves against cold attacks. If a cold

attack does not allow a saving throw,

the creature takes double damage instead.

Outsider Traits: A hellish guardian hound cannot be

raised or resurrected.

Scent  (Ex): A  hellish  guardian  hound  can  detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by

sense of smell.

Skills: A two-headed hellish guardian hound receives a

+5 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. Because

of its extra head, it also gains a +2 racial bonus on Listen,

Search and Spot checks. *The creature gains a +8 racial

bonus on Spot checks and Survival checks when tracking

by scent, due to its keen sense of smell.

CREATING A MULTIHEADED CREATURE

Multiheaded is an inherited template that can be added to

any corporeal creature that has a discernible head (hereafter

referred to as the base creature). A multiheaded creature has

all the base creatures characteristics except as noted here. A

multiheaded creature speaks any languages the base crea-

ture does.

Size and Type: Animals that have this template become

magical beasts, but otherwise type is unchanged. All addi-

tional heads are like that of the base creature.

Limit on Additional Heads: The number of heads possible

for a multiheaded creature is based on the base creatures

size.

Base Creature Size Maximum Additional Heads

Up to Medium-size

Large

Huge

Gargantuan

Colossal

1

3

11

19

29

Hit Dice: Each additional head adds 2 HD to the base

creatures total.

Attacks: A base creature with a bite, gore, or tongue

attack gains one additional such attack for each additional

head. This additional attack has the same attack bonus as its

counterpart in the base creature. The base attack bonus

increases for additional Hit Dice as appropriate for the crea-

tures type.

Damage: The damage bonus for an extra natural attack

gained by the addition of a head is the Strength modifier for

a primary attack, or 1/2 the Strength modifier for a second-

ary attack.

Special  Attacks: If  the  base  creature  has  a  breath

weapon, the extra heads also have breath weapons. All

weapons activate on the same round but can aim in differ-

ent directions. This rule also applies if the base creature has

a spit, spray, ray, or cone attack, so long as that attack comes

from the head. A multiheaded creature does not gain extra

gaze attacks, fear auras, and the like for its additional heads.

A multiheaded creature that can use weapons gains the

Superior Two-Weapon Fighting or Superior Multiweapon

Fighting ability (see below), as applicable. A multiheaded

creature that has only natural attacks instead gains the

Improved Multiattack feat as a bonus feat if it has any sec-

ondary attacks available at all, even if it does not have three

or more natural weapons.

Superior Two-Weapon Fighting or Superior Multiweapon

Fighting (Ex): Because each head controls one arm (or analo-

gous weapon-using limb), a multiheaded creature has no

penalty on attack rolls for attacking with multiple weapons,

and the number of attacks and the damage bonus for each

weapon are calculated as though the weapon were held in a

primary hand.

AC: Natural armor bonus increases by +1 per additional

Thus, a vorpal blade would have to remove all heads to have

its usual effect. Severing a head requires hitting the crea-

tures neck (same AC as creature) with a slashing weapon

and dealing damage equal to the multiheaded creatures

original hit point total divided by the original number of

heads. (The player must declare an attack against the neck

just before making the attack roll.) The severed head dies,

and a natural reflex seals the neck shut to prevent further

blood loss. The creature can no longer attack with the sev-

ered head but takes no other penalties. A severed head

cannot regrow naturally.

Abilities: Con +2 per additional head.

Skills: Each additional head a creature has gives it a

cumulative +2 racial bonus on Listen, Search and Spot

checks. The creature gains additional skill points for its

extra Hit Dice as normal for its type.

Feats: A multiheaded creature gains Improved Initiative

and Combat Reflexes as bonus feats, provided that it does

not already have them. The creature also gains additional

feats for its extra Hit Dice as appropriate for its type.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: The multiheaded creatures Chal-

lenge Rating depends upon how many additional heads it

has and on any head-based special attacks, as given on the

table below.

Lernaean, Pyro, and Cryo Creatures

Special Qualities: Multiheaded creatures have dark-

vision to a range of 90 feet. Having a redundant head makes

a creature more able to survive otherwise lethal attacks.

Some multiheaded creatures have abilities similar to the

various forms of hydras. The three different types each have

a special ability, as detailed below.

125

Lernaean Creatures

These multiheaded creatures have bodies that are immune

to attack (but see below). The only way to slay a Lernaean

creature is to sever all its heads. However, each time a head

is severed, two new heads spring from the stump in 1d4

rounds. A Lernaean creature may never have more than

twice its original number of heads; any heads it gains

beyond that number wither and die within a day.

To prevent a severed head from growing back into two, at

least 5 points of fire or acid damage must be dealt to the

stump (AC 19) before the new heads appear.

Spells such as disintegrate, finger of death, and slay living kill

a Lernaean creature if they succeed. If the spell deals

damage on a successful save, that damage is directed against

one of the creatures heads.

A Lernaean creature has an additional +2 level adjust-

ment.

Pyro Creatures

These reddish creatures can breath jets of fire 10 feet high,

10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once every

1d4 rounds, and each jet deals 3d6 points of fire damage per

head. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 creatures

number of heads + creatures Con modifier) halves the

damage. The creature also gains the fire subtype.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A multiheaded pyro creature is

immune to fire damage and takes a 10 penalty on saves

against cold attacks. If a cold attack does not allow a saving

throw, the creature takes double damage instead.

A pyro creature has an additional +1 level adjustment.

Cryo Creatures

These purplish creatures can breath jets of frost 10 feet

high, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long. All heads breathe once

every 1d4 rounds, and each jet deals 3d6 points of cold

damage per head. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2

creatures number of heads + creatures Con modifier)

halves the damage. The creature also gains the cold subtype.

Cold Subtype (Ex): A multiheaded cryo creature is

immune to cold damage and takes a 10 penalty on saves

against fire attacks. If a fire attack does not allow a saving

throw, the creature takes double damage instead.

A cryo creature has an additional +1 level adjustment.

Multiheaded Characters

Multiheaded creatures that take class levels treat fighter as

their preferred class. While some take levels of ranger or bar-

barian, their strengths lie in combat rather than in skill use.

MUMMIFIED CREATURE

Mummies are undead creatures, embalmed using ancient

necromantic lore. Often set as guardians for sacred sites,

mummies defend their charges until destroyed. Should a

mummy be unable to defend its charge for any reason, it

becomes an unreasoning spirit of vengeance, hunting those

who desecrated the site its master set it to defend.

A mummy appears withered and desiccated, its features

hidden beneath centuries-old funereal wrappings. It moves

with a slow, shambling gait and groans with the weight of

the ages. Symbols of the deity it once served often mark one

of these horrid creatures. While other undead stink of car-

rion, the herbs and powders used to create a mummy give

off a sharp, pungent odor, like that of a spice cabinet.

Mummified creatures speak the languages they spoke in

life.

In melee combat, a mummified ogre delivers a powerful

blow. Even if it had no other abilities, its great Strength and

grim determination would make it a formidable opponent.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of a mummified ogre,

the viewer must succeed on a Will save (DC 12) or be para-

lyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is

successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that

mummified ogres despair ability for one day.

Mummy Rot (Su): Natural weapon, Fortitude save (DC

20), incubation period 1 day; damage 1d6 Constitution.

Unlike normal diseases, mummy rot continues until the

victim reaches Constitution 0 (and dies) or receives a remove

disease spell or similar magic (see Disease in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide).

An afflicted creature that dies shrivels away into sand and

dust that blow away into nothing at the first wind unless

both remove disease and raise dead are cast on the remains

within 6 rounds.

Undead Traits: Immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, and disease. Not subject to

critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain,

or death from massive damage.

Resistant to Blows (Ex): Physical attacks deal only half

damage to mummified ogres. Apply this effect before

damage reduction.

Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A mummified ogre takes

double damage from fire attacks unless a save is allowed for

half damage. A successful save halves the damage, and a fail-

ure doubles it.

CREATING A MUMMIFIED CREATURE

Mummified is an acquired template that can be added to

any corporeal animal, giant, or humanoid (referred to here-

after as the base creature). A mummified creature has all the

base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead.

Hit Dice: All the creatures Hit Dice

become d12s.

Speed: A mummified crea-

tures land speed decreases

by  10  feet  (to  a  mini-

mum of 10 feet). The

speeds  correspon-

ding to any other

movement modes

are unchanged.

JJ

AC: +8  natural

armor bonus or the base creatures natural armor bonus,

whichever is higher.

Attacks: A mummified creature gains a slam attack if it

did not already have one.

Damage: The base damage for a mummified creatures

slam attack depends on its size, as given on the table below.

Use this value or the base damage for the base creatures

A mummified creature can infect a foe with mummy rot

Special Attacks: A mummified creature gains the two

special attacks described below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2

mummified creatures HD + mummified creatures Wis

modifier unless otherwise noted.

Despair (Su): At the mere sight of a mummified creature,

the  viewer  must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  or  be  paralyzed

with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is suc-

cessful, that creature cannot be affected again by that

mummys despair ability for one day.

Mummy Rot (Su): Any creature hit by any

of a mummified creatures nat-

ural weapons must succeed on

a  Fortitude  save  (DC  20)  or

contract  mummy  rot. The

incubation period is 1 day,

and  the  disease  deals

1d6 points of Constitu-

tion  damage.  Because

it is a supernatural dis-

ease,  mummy  rot  con-

tinues until the victim reaches

Constitution  0  (and  dies)  or  re-

ceives a remove disease spell or sim-

ilar magic (see Disease in Chapter 3 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide). An afflicted creature that

dies shrivels away into sand and dust, blowing

away  into  nothing  at  the  first  wind,  unless

both remove disease and raise dead are cast

on the remains within 6 rounds.

Special  Qualities: A  mummy

gains the four special attacks described

below.

Undead  Traits: A  mummified

creature  is  immune  to  mind-affect-

ing  effects,  poison,  sleep,

paralysis,  stunning,

disease,

death  effects,

necromantic  ef-

fects,  and  any  effect  that

requires a Fortitude save unless is

also works on objects. It is not subject to

critical  hits,  subdual  damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. A mummified

creature cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is

willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Damage Reduction (Ex): A mummified creatures undead

body is tough, giving it damage reduction 5/+1.

Resistant to Blows (Ex): Physical attacks deal only half

damage to mummies. Apply this effect before damage

reduction.

A reptilian is of average height and weight for the base

creature from which it is derived. It has green, gray, or

brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is roughly half

as long as the reptilian is tall. Although they are omnivores,

reptilians prefer meat. Primitive reptilians prefer the flesh

of intelligent creatures, while more advanced cultures

prefer the flesh of herd animals and wild game.

A reptilian speaks the same languages as the base crea-

ture, plus Draconic.

Mummified Characters

It is possible to play a mummy character. The process of

becoming a mummy is usually involuntary, but

expressing the wish to become one to the

proper  priests,  and  paying  the  proper

fees, can convince them to bring you back

to life as a mummyespecially if some of

your  friends  make  sure  the  priests  do

what you paid them to do. The mum-

my retains all class abilities it had

in  life,  provided  that  its  new

ability scores still allow it to use

them (a wizard may lose access

to  some  spell  levels,  for  in-

stance). A loss of Intel-

ligence  does  not

retroactively

remove skill

points  from

a mummi-

fied creature.

Mummified

characters  have

the preferred class

they had in life. If

they are unable to

continue in that

class because of

a  change  in

ability score or

alignment, their

preferred class is

fighter.

REPTILIAN CREATURE

Reptilians are scaly, tailed folk often found near bodies of

water. Folk tales suggest that in ancient times, dragons cre-

ated them as servitor races. Some reptilians still serve drag-

ons, some worship them, and many others are independ-

ent. Reptilians can be found in all but the coldest climates.

Their societies and cultures range from primitive to equal

with humans.

A reptilian bugbear is tall and very muscular. It stands

approximately 7 feet tall and has a tail roughly 3 1/2 feet

long. Its scaly hide varies in color from light yellow to

yellow-brown, and its ears are wedge-shaped. Its eyes are

greenish-white with red pupils, and they resemble those of

a savage animal. A reptilian bugbears mouth is full of long,

sharp fangs, and its nose is much like that of a bear, with the

same fine sense of smell.

A reptilian bugbear speaks Goblin, Common, and Dra-

conic.

Combat

Reptilian bugbears prefer to ambush opponents whenever

possible. When hunting, they normally send scouts ahead

of the main group who, if they spy prey, return to report and

bring up reinforcements. Reptilian bugbear attacks are

coordinated, and their tactics are sound if not brilliant.

Scent  (Ex):  A  reptilian  bugbear  can  detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and

track by sense of smell.

Skills: A reptilian bugbear gets a +4 racial

bonus on Balance, Jump, and Move Silently

checks.

CREATING A REPTILIAN

CREATURE

Reptilian is an inherited template

that can be added to any humanoid,

monstrous humanoid, or giant (here-

after referred to as the base crea-

ture) that does not already have

the aquatic or reptilian subtype.

The creature gains a tail half as

long as the base creatures height.

A reptilian creature has all the

base creatures characteristics ex-

cept as noted here.

Size and Type: The template

adds the reptilian subtype.

AC: The tough hide of a reptilian

increases the base creatures natural

armor bonus by +2.

Attacks: A reptilian gains a claw

attack if it did not already have

one. The base damage depends

on the creatures size, as given in

version of either ability, use the superior ability.

A reptilian can hold its breath twice as long as a human.

Abilities: +2 Str, +2 Con, +2 Wis.

Skills: A reptilian gains a +4 racial bonus on Jump and

Balance checks.

Climate/Terrain: Same as the base creature, but never

cold or desert.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +1.

Level Adjustment: +2.

Those with lawful alignments often take levels of paladin,

benefiting from the same racial advantages.

SPECTRAL CREATURE

Spectral creatures are incorporeal undead often mistaken

for  ghosts  or  other  such  horrors. They

haunt the places where they died, retain-

ing their sentience but hating all living

beings.

A spectral creature looks so much as it

did  in  life  that  it  can  be

easily recognized by those

who either knew the indi-

vidual  or  have  access  to

depictions such as paintings

or the like. In many cases, the

evidence of a violent death is vis-

ible on the creatures semitrans-

parent, faintly luminous body.

The chill of death hangs in

the  air  around  a  spectral

creature and lingers in the

places it haunts.

REPTILIAN CHARACTERS

Combat

A reptilian characters preferred class is fighter. Strong,

tough, and perceptive, these creatures excel as soldiers.

Spectral cloakers usually lie still, watching and listening for

prey. In close combat, a spectral cloaker attacks with its

129

numbing, life-draining touch. It makes full use of its incor-

poreal nature, moving through walls, ceilings, and floors as

it attacks.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature struck by a spec-

tral cloakers incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a

Fortitude save (DC 17) or gain two negative levels. For each

negative level it bestows, the spectral cloaker heals 5 points

of damage. If the amount of healing is more than the

damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as tem-

porary  hit  points.  If  the  negative  level  has  not  been

removed (by a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have

passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 17) to remove it. Failure means the opponents

level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Create Spawn (Su): Any aberration, animal, dragon,

giant, humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid

slain by a spectral cloaker rises as a spectral creature in 1d4

rounds. Such a spawn is under the command of the spectral

cloaker that created it and remains enslaved until its

masters death. The spawn does not possess any of the abili-

ties it had in life but gains the spectral creature template.

A spectral cloaker can control a number of spawn

equal to its HD  2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to

exceed this limit, the spawn longest under its control is

released.

Incorporeal Subtype: A spectral cloaker can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities, and supernatural

abilities. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any

damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or

attacks made with ghost touch weapons. A spectral cloaker

can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will.

Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but

deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against

them. A spectral cloaker always moves silently and cannot

be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A spectral cloaker is treated as an

undead with 8 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke,

command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A spectral cloaker is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is

not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

A spectral cloaker cannot be raised, and resurrection works

only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot

range).

Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated ani-

mals can sense the unnatural presence of a spectral cloaker

at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach

nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain

panicked as long as they are within that range.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): Spectral cloakers are

utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight

spell) and flee from it. A spectral cloaker caught in sunlight

cannot attack and can take only partial actions.

Skills: Spectral cloakers receive a +8 racial bonus on

Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks.

CREATING A SPECTRAL CREATURE

Spectral creature is an acquired template that can be

added to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid,

magical  beast,  or  monstrous  humanoid. The  creature

(referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a

Charisma score of at least 8. A spectral creature has all the

base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead,

and it takes the incorporeal subtype.

Hit Dice: All the creatures Hit Dice change to d12s.

Speed: Fly 80 ft. (perfect).

AC: The creature loses all natural armor but gains a

deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1,

whichever is greater.

Attacks: The creature loses all its attacks and gains an

incorporeal touch attack.

Damage: The damage for a spectral creatures incorporeal

Special Attacks: A spectral creature loses the base crea-

below.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature struck by a spectral

creatures incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a Forti-

tude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 spectral creatures HD +

spectral creatures Cha modifier) or gain two negative

levels. For each negative level it bestows, the spectral crea-

ture heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of healing is

more than the damage the creature has taken, it gains any

excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has not

been removed (by a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours

have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed on a For-

titude save to remove it. Failure means the opponents level

(or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Special Qualities: A spectral creature gains the six spe-

cial qualities described below.

Create Spawn (Su): Any aberration, animal, dragon, giant,

humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid slain by

a spectral creature rises as a spectral creature in 1d4 rounds.

Such a spawn is under the command of the spectral crea-

ture that created it and remains enslaved until its masters

death. The spawn does not possess any of the abilities it had

in life but gains the spectral creature template.

A spectral creature can control a number of spawn equal

to its HD  2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to exceed

this limit, the spawn longest under its control is released.

Incorporeal Subtype: A spectral creature can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities, and supernatural

abilities. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any

damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or

Undead Traits: A spectral creature is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is

not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A

spectral creature cannot be raised, and resurrection works only

if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated animals

can sense the unnatural presence of a spectral creature at a

distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer

than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked

as long as they are within that range.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): Spectral creatures are utterly

powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell)

and flee from it. A spectral creature caught in sunlight

cannot attack and can take only

partial actions.

SYMBIOTIC CREATURE

A symbiotic relationship is a sort of benign parasitism,

where both host and guest enjoy mutual benefits. The

most successful partnerships bond the two creatures so

tightly that they become virtually one.

SPECTRAL

CHARACTERS

Spectral characters with class

levels generally take levels of

barbarian, fighter, or ranger. These

classes  offer  good  Hit  Dice  and

attack bonuses that the spectral

character uses to make its incorpo-

real touch more effective. The preferred

class of spectral characters is fighter. They

rarely take spellcaster levels because, as incorporeal

creatures, they cannot handle material components. Some

multiclass as rogues to get the class abilities and increased

access to skills (their incorporeal nature allows them to

move silently and hide without those rogue class skills).

Combat

Blood  Drain  (Ex): A

bugsucker drains blood. To use

this ability, it must make a

successful grapple check and

attach itself to the target

by hitting with its touch

attack.  Each  round  it

maintains the hold, it

deals 1d4 points of Consti-

tution damage. It can make the

attack  against  Small  or

larger creatures only.

Detach (Ex): A symbiotic creatures two

members can separate, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the

host (bugbear). This is a standard action that does provoke

an attack of opportunity, which may be made against host

131

or guest. Reengaging takes one day of complete rest. If the

reattaching creatures are disturbed during this process,

each takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage from bleed-

ing, and they remain separate.

CREATING A SYMBIOTIC CREATURE

Symbiotic is an acquired template that can be added to

any two living creatures of the following types: animal,

humanoid, plant, or vermin. The two creatures need not be

the same type. One (hereafter referred to as the guest) must

be at least two size categories smaller than the other (here-

after referred to as the host).

A symbiotic creature has characteristics of both the host

and the guest, as noted below.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to aberration.

Hit Dice: A symbiotic creature uses the hosts Hit Dice

Constitution) of the host, and the mental scores (Intelli-

gence, Wisdom, Charisma) of the guest (minimum Intelli-

gence 3).

Skills: A symbiotic creature uses the hosts skill ranks,

adjusted to account for the changed ability scores of the

overall symbiotic creature. The skill ranks of the guest

become racial bonuses of the symbiotic creature. All the

original racial skill bonuses of both the host and the guest

also apply.

Feats: A symbiotic creature retains the hosts feats and

gains the guests feats as bonus feats.

Climate/Terrain: Same as the host.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: As a mixed pair consisting of host

and guest.

Treasure: Same as the host or the guest, whichever is

and Constitution modifier.

better.

Speed: A symbiotic creature uses the hosts speed and

modes of movement, including maneuverability if applicable.

AC: Same as the host.

Attacks: A symbiotic creature uses the hosts base attack

bonus and attack forms. However, if the guest has a different

attack form (such as a stinger), the symbiotic creature can

make a secondary attack with that weapon. All attacks use

the hosts Strength or Dexterity modifier, as appropriate.

If the guest is Tiny or smaller, using its attack(s) would

normally require entering the opponents space. Since it is

now part of a larger being, the only way to bring its attack(s)

to bear is by entering a grapple and getting a hold.

Damage: The  hosts  attacks  deal  the  hosts  normal

damage. The guests attack deals its base damage plus 1/2

the symbiotic creatures Strength modifier.

Special Attacks: A symbiotic creature can use a special

attack of either the host or the guest but cannot use both in

the same round (unless it somehow has an additional par-

tial action, such as from haste). Attack forms that require the

use of the guests entire body, such as constrict, are not

allowed unless the guest detaches (see below). Special

attacks that involve prolonged contact with an opponent

may require the host to make grapple checks each round to

maintain the hold.

Special Qualities: A symbiotic creature has the special

qualities, both advantageous and disadvantageous, of both

host and guest.

Detach (Ex): If the survival of a symbiotic creature is

threatened, its two members can separate in an effort to

save at least one of them (often this is the guest). This

process deals 1d6 points of damage to the host. Detaching is

a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity,

which may be made against host or guest. A symbiotic crea-

ture may also separate to better bring to bear a hosts or

guests special attacks.

Reengaging is not a simple matter; it takes one day of

complete rest. If the reattaching creatures are disturbed

during this process, each takes 1d6 points of Constitution

damage from bleeding, and they remain separate.

Alignment: Any, often that of the guest.

Advancement: As host or by character class.

Level Adjustment: +1.

SYMBIOTIC CHARACTERS

Because the guest often has a low Intelligence score, symbi-

otic characters are rare. Those that exist generally have

higher physical scores than mental scores, so their pre-

ferred class is fighter.

TAURIC CREATURE

A tauric creature is a hybrid being possessing the head,

arms, and upper torso of a humanoid, and the legs and

lower body of an animal, magical beast, or vermin. Some are

created as the result of magical experiments or as divine

punishment for failing their deities. Tauric creatures of the

same kind form a unique race with its own culture, lan-

guage, and religion. Tauric creatures are not to be confused

with two-legged humanoid/creature hybrids such as the

minotaur or the satyr, which have different traits from their

apparent component creatures.

Tauric creatures speak the languages of both of their com-

ponent creatures, as well as any language they have devel-

oped as a people.

SAMPLE TAURIC CREATURE

Here is an example of a tauric creature using a griffon as the

base creature and a 1st-level hobgoblin warrior as the base

humanoid.

CREATING A TAURIC

CREATURE

Tauric is an inherited template

that combines two creatures into

one hybrid creature. The template

can be added to added to any corpo-

real  humanoid  or  monstrous  humanoid  of  Small  or

Medium-size (referred to hereafter as the base humanoid)

and any Medium-size or Large corporeal animal, magical

beast, or vermin with at least four legs (referred to hereafter

as the base creature). A tauric creature has all the base crea-

tures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to monstrous

humanoid.

Hit  Dice: Add  the  base  humanoids  and  base  creatures

Hit Dice to get the tauric creatures Hit Dice, each of which

changes to a d8. A humanoid that normally has a class in-

stead of 1 Hit Die counts as a 1 HD creature.

AC: A tauric creature has the natural armor bonus of the

base creature or the base humanoid, whichever is better.

Attacks and Damage: A tauric creature retains the natural

weapons and base damage of the base humanoid and the base

creature, provided that the tauric creatures physical form is

:

capable of delivering those attacks. The absence of the base

creatures head always results in the loss of the base creatures

bite attack. If the creature loses its primary attack in this fash-

ion, all its remaining natural attacks are still secondary.

A tauric creature has the base attack bonus of a mon-

strous humanoid of the tauric creatures Hit Dice as a mon-

ster (do not count Hit Dice from class levels).

Special Attacks: A tauric creature retains the special at-

tacks of the base humanoid and the base creature, provided

that  the  tauric  creature  is  capable  of  delivering  the  attack.

The absence of the base creatures head always results in the

loss of the base creatures breath weapon or gaze attack.

Special  Qualities: A  tauric  creature  retains  the  special

qualities of both the base humanoid and the base creature.

Base  Saves:  For  each  saving  throw,  use  the  base  save

bonus for either the base creature or the base

humanoid, whichever is higher.

Abilities: A  tauric  creature  uses

the base humanoids Intelligence,

Wisdom,  and  Charisma  scores,

and  it  uses  the  base  creatures

Strength, Dexterity, and Con-

stitution scores.

Skills: A  tauric  creature

gains skill points as a mon-

strous  humanoid  of  its

Hit Dice as a monster (do

not count Hit Dice from

class  levels).  Treat  skills

from both the base crea-

tures  list  and  the  base

humanoids  list  as  class

skills. If the creature has a

class,  it  gains  skill  points

for class levels normally.

Feats: A tauric creature gains

feats as a monstrous humanoid

of its Hit Dice as a monster.

Climate/Terrain: Same

as  either  the  base

humanoid or the base

creature,  whichever  is

more restrictive.

Organization: Same as either the base

humanoid or the base creature, whichever uses the smaller

number ranges.

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +1.

Treasure: Same as the base humanoid.

Alignment: Same as the base humanoid.

Advancement: By character class of the base humanoid.

TAURIC CHARACTERS

Tauric characters excel in many areas. The base creature

often provides strong physical scores, making them excel-

lent barbarians, fighters, paladins, or rangers. The base crea-

ture may even give them attributes that make them good

rogues. The base humanoid may provide mental scores that

make them good bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, or wizards.

Their preferred class, however, is ranger.

UMBRAL CREATURE

Umbral creatures are, like shadows, creatures of living

darkness. They hate life and light with equal fervor. Their

touch bestows the painful chill of nonexistence, making

them very dangerous opponents.

An umbral creature looks like a shadowy version of a

material creature, and it may easily be mistaken for a living

creature from the Plane of Shadow. Umbral creatures are

difficult to see in dark or gloomy areas, but they stand out

starkly in brightly illuminated places.

Natural enemies of all that live, umbral creatures are

aggressive and predatory. They are quick to strike and make

short work of those unprepared to deal with them.

Umbral creatures speak whatever languages they spoke

in life.

SAMPLE UMBRAL CREATURE

This example uses an ettin as the base creature.

Umbral Ettin

Large Undead (Incorporeal)

Hit Dice: 10d12 (65 hp)

Initiative: +4

Speed: Fly 40 ft. (perfect)

AC: 10 (1 size, +1 deflection), touch 10, flat-footed 10

Special Qualities: Create spawn, darkvision 90 ft., incor-

poreal subtype, turn resistance +2, undead traits

Saves: Fort +7, Ref +3, Will +4

Abilities: Str , Dex 10, Con , Int 2, Wis 12, Cha 13

Skills: Listen +10, Search +1, Spot +10

Feats: Alertness, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power

Attack

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (34), or swarm (611)

Challenge Rating: 8

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always chaotic evil

Advancement: By character class

Combat

Umbral ettins are even less intelligent than their Material

Plane cousins, but they are equally cunning fighters. They

prefer to lurk in dark places and ambush their victims

rather than charge into a straight fight, but once the battle

has started, an umbral ettin fights furiously until all ene-

mies are dead.

Strength Damage (Su): The touch of an umbral ettin

deals 1d8 points of Strength damage to a living foe. A crea-

ture reduced to Strength 0 by an umbral ettin dies.

Create Spawn (Su): Any aberration, animal, dragon,

giant, humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid

reduced to Strength 0 by an umbral ettin rises as an umbral

creature in 1d4 rounds. Such a spawn is under the com-

mand of the umbral ettin that created it and remains

enslaved until its masters death. The spawn does not pos-

sess any of the abilities it had in life but gains the umbral

creature template.

An umbral ettin can control a number of spawn equal to

its HD  2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to exceed this

limit, the spawn longest under its control is released.

Incorporeal Subtype: An umbral ettin can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities, and supernatural

abilities. The creature has a 50% chance to ignore any

damage from a corporeal source, except for force effects or

attacks made with ghost touch weapons. An umbral ettin

can pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will.

Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but

deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against

them. An umbral ettin always moves silently and cannot be

heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Turn Resistance (Ex): An umbral ettin is treated as an

undead with 12 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn, rebuke,

command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: An umbral ettin is immune to mind-

affecting effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is

not subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage,

ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

An umbral ettin cannot be raised, and resurrection works

only if it is willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot

range).

Skills: An umbral ettins two heads give it a +2 racial

bonus on Listen, Spot, and Search checks.

CREATING AN UMBRAL CREATURE

Umbral creature is an acquired template that can be added

to any aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical

beast, or monstrous humanoid. The creature (referred to

hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score

of at least 8. An umbral creature has all the base creatures

characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead,

and it takes the incorporeal subtype.

Hit Dice: All the base creatures Hit Dice change to d12s.

Speed: The creature gains a fly speed of 40 feet if it did

not already have a faster fly speed, and its maneuverability

becomes perfect.

AC: The creature loses its natural armor bonus but gains

a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1,

whichever is greater.

Attacks: The creature loses all its attacks and gains an

incorporeal touch attack.

Damage: An umbral creatures incorporeal touch attack

deals Strength damage based on the creatures size, accord-

ing to the table below.

Special Attacks: An umbral creature loses the base crea-

tures special attacks and gains the special attack of Strength

damage, described below.

Strength Damage (Su): The touch of an umbral creature

deals 1d6 points of Strength damage to a living foe. A crea-

ture reduced to Strength 0 by an umbral creature dies.

Special Qualities: An umbral creature gains the four

special qualities described below.

Create Spawn (Su): Any aberration, animal, dragon,

giant, humanoid, magical beast, or monstrous

humanoid reduced to Strength 0 by an umbral

creature rises as an umbral creature in 1d4

rounds. Such a spawn is under the command

of the umbral creature that created it and

remains enslaved until its masters death.

The spawn does not possess any of the abili-

ties it had in life but gains the umbral creature

template.

An umbral creature can control a number of

spawn equal to its HD  2. If it creates a spawn

that causes it to exceed this limit, the spawn long-

est under its control is released.

Incorporeal Subtype: An umbral

creature can be harmed only by

other incorporeal crea-

tures, +1 or better

magic weapons,

spells,  and

spell-like

abilities,

and

supernatural abil-

ities. The creature has a

50% chance to ignore any damage

from a corporeal source, except for

force effects or attacks made with ghost

touch weapons. An umbral creature can

pass through solid objects, but not

force effects, at will. Its attacks

ignore  natural  armor,

armor, and shields, but

deflection bonuses and

force effects work normally

against  them.  An  umbral

creature always moves silently

and cannot be heard with Listen

checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Turn Resistance (Ex): An umbral creature gains turn resist-

ance +2.

Undead Traits: An umbral creature is immune to mind-affect-

ing effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a For-

titude save unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to

critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. An umbral crea-

ture cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is will-

ing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Abilities: +2 Dex, 4 Int (minimum 2), +2 Wis, +2 Cha.

As an incorporeal undead, an umbral creature has no

Strength or Constitution score.

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (34), or swarm

(611).

WIGHT

A wights appearance is a weird and twisted reflection of the

form it had in life. Its wild, frantic eyes burn with malevo-

lence. The leathery, desiccated flesh is drawn tight across its

bones, and its teeth have grown into sharp, jagged needles.

Wights lurk in barrow mounds, catacombs, and other

places thick with the aura of death, where they nurture

their hatred. They seek to destroy all life, filling graveyards

with their victims and populating the world with their

horrid progeny.

Wights speak whatever languages they spoke in life.

SAMPLE WIGHT

This example uses a troglodyte as the

base creature.

Troglodyte Wight

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature struck by a

troglodyte wights claw or bite attack must succeed on a

Fortitude save (DC 13) or gain two negative levels. For each

negative level it bestows, the troglodyte wight heals 5

points of damage. If the amount of healing is more than the

damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as tem-

porary  hit  points.  If  the  negative  level  has  not  been

removed (with a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours

have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed on a For-

titude save (DC 13) to remove it. Failure means the oppo-

nents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Stench (Ex): When a troglodyte wight is angry or fright-

ened, it secretes an oily, musklike chemical that nearly

every form of animal life finds offensive. All living crea-

tures (except troglodytes and troglodyte wights) within 30

feet of the troglodyte wight must succeed on a Fortitude

save (DC 13) or be overcome with nausea. This lasts for 10

rounds and deals 1d6 points of Strength damage.

Medium-Size Undead

Hit Dice: 2d12 (13 hp)

Initiative: +0

Speed: 30 ft.

Treasure: None

Alignment: Always lawful evil

Advancement: 36 HD (Medium-size)

Create Spawn (Su): Any human-

oid slain by a troglodyte wight

rises as a wight in 1d4 rounds.

Such a spawn is under the com-

mand of the troglodyte wight that

created it and remains enslaved

until its masters death. The spawn

does not possess any of the abili-

ties it had in life but gains the

wight template.

A troglodyte wight can con-

trol a number of spawn equal to

its HD  2. If it creates a spawn

that  causes  it  to  exceed  this

limit, the spawn longest under

its control is released.

Undead Traits: A trog-

lodyte wight is immune

to mind-affecting effects,

poison, sleep, paralysis,

stunning,  disease,

death effects, necro-

mantic effects, and any

effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects. It is not subject to criti-

cal hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain,

energy drain, or death from massive damage. A troglodyte

wight cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is

willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Skills: The skin of a troglodyte wight changes color

somewhat, allowing it to blend in with surroundings like a

chameleon and conferring a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks. *In rocky or subterranean settings, this bonus

improves to +8.

Combat

CREATING A WIGHT

Half of a group of troglodyte wights are armed only with

claws and teeth; the rest carry one or two javelins and longs-

pears. They normally conceal themselves, launch a volley of

javelins, then close to attack. If the battle goes against them,

they retreat and attempt to hide.

Wight is an acquired template that can be added to any

humanoid (hereafter called the base creature). A wight has

all the base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead.

Hit Dice: All the creatures Hit Dice change to d12s.

136

AC: The wight gains a +4 natural armor bonus or retains

the base creatures natural armor bonus, whichever is

higher.

Attacks: The wight retains all the base creatures

attacks, and all its natural weapons can deliver its

energy drain special attack.

Damage: The wight retains the base crea-

tures damage and adds energy drain to

any damage done by natural weapons.

Special Attacks: A wight gains the

energy drain special attack, described

below. The DC of the saving throw for

any of its special attacks is equal to

10 + 1/2 wights HD + wights Cha

modifier.

Energy Drain (Su): Any living creature

struck by a wights natural attack must

succeed  on  a  Fortitude  saving

throw  or  gain  two  negative

levels. For each negative level

it bestows, the wight heals 5

points  of  damage.  If  the

amount of healing is more

than the damage the creature

has  taken,  it  gains  any

excess as temporary hit

points. If the nega-

tive level has not

been removed (with

a spell such as restoration)

before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must

succeed on a Fortitude save (same DC) to remove it. Failure

means the opponents level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one.

Special Qualities: A wight gains the special qualities

described below.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a wight rises as

a wight in 1d4 rounds. Such a spawn is under the command

of the wight that created it and remains enslaved until its

masters death. The spawn does not possess any of the abili-

ties it had in life but gains the wight template.

A wight can control a number of spawn equal to its HD 

2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to exceed this limit, the

spawn longest under its control is released.

Undead Traits: A wight is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A wight

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Abilities: +2 Str, +2 Dex, +2 Wis, +4 Cha. As an undead, a

wight has no Constitution score.

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (35), or pack (611).

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +3.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Always lawful evil.

Level Adjustment: +4.

WIGHT CHARACTERS

A wights preferred class is sorcerer. Many wights combine

high Charisma scores with high Wisdom scores, making

them excellent clerics.

WINGED CREATURE

Winged creatures are avian monsters that gener-

ally prefer to live in mountainous and heavily

forested regions. Some possess feathered wings,

some possess leathery wings, and still others

possess insect wings. The type of wing is no

indication of alignment, sophistication, or atti-

tude. Intelligent winged creatures tend to

revere Bahamut and Obad-Hai for their con-

trol over the air.

A winged creature appears as a normal

representative of the base creature, with

the addition of a pair of wings on its backs.

Intelligent winged folk may be primitive

tribes, nomadic wanderers,

or as culturally sophisti-

cated as elves.

Winged crea-

tures, if they

possess the gift

of language, speak

the languages of their base

creatures, plus Auran.

The statistics presented here are based on fairly small dogs,

such as terriers. They also can be used for small wild

canines, such as coyotes, jackals, and African wild dogs.

SAMPLE WRAITH

This example uses a 1st-level kobold warrior as the base

creature.

Combat

Dogs usually rush into combat and bite opponents. They

possess little subtlety.

Skills: *A dog receives a +4 racial bonus on Survival

checks when tracking by scent.

CREATING A WINGED CREATURE

Winged is an inherited template that can be added to any

animal, giant, humanoid, monstrous humanoid, or vermin

(hereafter referred to as the base creature) that does not

already have a fly speed. A winged creature has all the base

creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: Giants and monstrous humanoids do not

change types. Animals and vermin become magical beasts,

and humanoids become monstrous humanoids.

Speed: A winged creature gains a fly speed equal to its

land speed plus 20 feet. Maneuverability is based on the

winged creatures Dexterity, as shown on the following

table.

WINGED CHARACTERS

A winged characters preferred class is fighter. Most winged

characters prefer ranged combat and take advantage of

fighter bonus feats to quickly acquire feats that make them

powerful archers. A few winged characters become rogues,

but there is a weight limit on how much a character can

carry and still fly, making it difficult to steal large amounts

of goods.

WRAITH

Wraiths are incorporeal creatures born of evil and darkness.

They despise all living things, as well as the light that nur-

tures them.

Although composed of darkness, wraiths are more or

less humanoid in shape. They are utterly featureless except

for the glowing red pinpoints of their eyes. In some cases,

the grim silhouette of a wraith might appear armored or

outfitted with weapons. This does not affect the creatures

Armor Class or combat abilities but only reflects the shape

it had in life.

Combat

Kobold wraiths like to attack with overwhelming odds (at

least two to one) or trickery; should the odds fall below

what they consider a comfortable threshold, they usually

flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their num-

bers are equal. Close combat with a kobold wraith is dan-

gerous, thanks to its deadly touch.

Constitution Drain (Su): A living creature hit by a

kobold wraiths incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a

Fortitude save (DC 12) or take 1d6 points of Constitution

drain.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a kobold

wraith rises as a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Such a spawn is

under the command of the kobold wraith that created it

and remains enslaved until its masters death. The spawn

does not possess any of the abilities it had in life but gains

the wraith template.

A kobold wraith can control a number of spawn equal to

its HD  2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to exceed this

limit, the spawn longest under its control is released.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): Kobold wraiths are

utterly powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight

spell) and flee from it.

Incorporeal Subtype: A kobold wraith can be harmed

only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic

made with ghost touch weapons. A kobold wraith can pass

through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its

attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but deflec-

tion bonuses and force effects work normally against them.

A kobold wraith always moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A kobold wraith is treated as

an undead with 2 Hit Dice for the purpose of turn,

rebuke, command, and bolster attempts.

Undead Traits: A kobold wraith is im-

mune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromantic effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also

works on objects. It is not subject to

critical hits, subdual damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain,

or death from massive damage.

A kobold wraith cannot be

raised, and resurrection works

only if it is willing. The crea-

ture  has  darkvision  (60-

foot range).

Unnatural Aura (Su):

Both wild and domesti-

cated animals can sense

the unnatural presence

of a kobold wraith at a

distance of 30 feet. They

do  not  willingly  ap-

proach  nearer  than

that and become pan-

icked if forced to do so;

they remain panicked

as long as they are

within that range.

CREATING A

WRAITH

Wraith  is  an  acquired

template that can be added to any

humanoid. A wraith has all the base creatures character-

istics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead,

and it takes the incorporeal subtype.

Hit Dice: All the creaures Hit Dice change to d12s.

Speed: Fly 60 ft. (perfect).

AC: The creature loses its natural armor bonus, but gains

a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier or +1,

whichever is greater.

Attacks: The creature loses all its attacks and gains an

incorporeal touch attack.

Damage: The base damage for the wraiths incorporeal

touch attack depends on the size of the creature, as shown

on the table below. The attack also deals 1d6 points of Con-

stitution drain.

Special Attacks: A wraith loses the base creatures spe-

cial attacks and gains Constitution drain.

Constitution Drain (Su): Any living creature hit by a

wraiths incorporeal touch attack must succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 10 + 1/2 wraiths HD + wraiths Cha modi-

fier)  or  take  1d6  points  of  Constitution

drain.

Special Qualities: A wraith loses

all the base creatures special

qualities and gains those

described below.

Create  Spawn  (Su):

Any humanoid slain by

a wraith rises as a wraith

in 1d4 rounds. Such a spawn

is under the command of the

wraith that created it and re-

mains  enslaved  until  its

masters death. The spawn

does not possess any of

the abilities it had in life

but gains the wraith tem-

plate.

A wraith can control

a  number  of  spawn

equal to its HD  2. If

it  creates  a  spawn

that causes it to

exceed  this

limit, the spawn

longest under

its  control  is

released.

Incorporeal Subtype:

A  wraith  can  be

harmed only by other

incorporeal creatures, +1 or better magic weapons,

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The

creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a cor-

poreal source, except for force effects or attacks made with

ghost touch weapons. A wraith can pass through solid

objects, but not force effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natu-

ral armor, armor, and shields, but deflection bonuses and

force effects work normally against them. A wraith always

moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it

doesnt wish to be.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A wraith gains turn resistance +2.

Undead Traits: A wraith is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. It is not sub-

ject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability

139

drain, energy drain, or death from massive damage. A

wraith cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is

willing. The creature has darkvision (60-foot range).

Unnatural Aura (Su): Both wild and domesticated animals

can sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of

30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and

become panicked if forced to do so; they remain panicked

as long as they are within that range.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): Wraiths are utterly powerless

in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee

from it. A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and can

take only partial actions.

Abilities: +6 Dex, +4 Int, +4 Wis, +4 Cha. As an incorpo-

real undead, a wraith has no Strength or Constitution score.

Feats: A wraith gains Improved Initiative as a bonus feat.

Climate/Terrain: Any land and underground.

Organization: Solitary, pair, gang (35), or pack (611).

Challenge Rating: Base creatures CR +5.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Always lawful evil.

Level Adjustment: +7.

WRAITH CHARACTERS

Those who rise from the dead as wraiths are particularly

likely to take class levels due to their increased Intelligence.

They generally prefer levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger,

since those classes offer good Hit Dice and strong attack

bonus progressionbenefits a wraith character can use

even though it cannot handle material objects. A wraiths

preferred class is fighter.

YUAN-TI

One of the most insidious aspects of the yuan-ti is their

human  heritage,  for  this  vile  race  of  serpent  folk  is

descended from humans who interbred with an ancient

sauroid race. In their monstrous evil, the yuan-ti continue

this mingling of serpentine and human blood, creating two

type of agents and servitors who are not quite humannor

are they fully yuan-ti.

Yuan-ti cultists (see Chapter 7: Prestige Classes) create

both these servitors using essentially the same process.

If the process is a success, the result is a tainted one.

These creatures appear just as they did before their infec-

tiongenerally able-bodied humans, usually of 3rd to

6th level. Though their bodies do not show signs of their

tainted blood, their personalities and mannerisms do:

They often develop habits such as frequently licking their

lips, drawing out the sibilant sounds when they speak, or

keeping large serpents as pets. Tainted ones serve the

yuan-ti as agents who can pass unnoticed among other

races and infiltrate where even a pureblood yuan-ti might

risk discovery.

If the process goes awry, the result is a broodguard

a hairless, near-mindless abomination with an emaciated

body. Its gray or yellow-green skin is tough and scaly, and

it smells faintly of rotting meat. The creature has beady,

bloodshot eyes, and its forked tongue continually darts

in and out of its mouth. Broodguards, as their name

suggests, are most often found guarding yuan-ti brood

chambers.

Tainted ones and broodguards speak the languages they

knew before their transformation, and they usually learn

Draconic within a few months of becoming infected.

Combat

Poison Bite (Ex): The saliva of a tainted one is poisonous

when ingested or introduced into the blood. A tainted one

can only inject its venom while grappling a foe with

exposed skin. The Fortitude save to resist this poison has a

DC of 17. Victims who fail this save take 1d4 points of Con-

stitution damage. After 1 minute, they must make another

save; failure means another 1d4 points of Constitution

damage. A tainted ones kiss is also poisonous, though in

this case the save DC is reduced by 2.

Psionics  (Sp): The  transformation  activates  latent

psionic potential in human minds, granting tainted ones

supernatural abilities similar to those of true yuan-ti. A

tainted one can create the following effects through the

power of its mind as a sorcerer of its character level: poison

(Fortitude save, DC 18) and polymorph self (into snake or

snakelike forms only).

Poison Immunity (Ex): Tainted ones are immune to all

forms of snake venom, including their own poison.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A tainted one gains spell resist-

ance of 12 +1 per three levels.

CREATING A YUAN-TI

Tainted one and broodguard are acquired templates that

can be added to any human (referred to hereafter as the

base creature). Creatures using these templates have all the

base creatures characteristics except as noted here.

Size and Type: Tainted ones remain humanoids. Brood-

guards become monstrous humanoids.

AC: Broodguards do not wear armor.

Attacks and Damage: Tainted ones gain a poisonous

bite (see Special Attacks).

Broodguards have sharp claws and vicious bites

they can use in melee. They use the base attack

values they had as humans, but their claws deal 1d2

points of damage and their bite deals 1d3 points of

damage.

Special Attacks: Tainted ones gain the

following two special attacks.

Psionics (Sp): The transformation

activates latent psionic potential in

human  minds,  granting  tainted

ones supernatural abilities similar

to those of true yuan-ti. A tainted

one  can  create  the  following

effects through the power of its mind

tion damage. A tainted ones kiss is also poisonous, though in

this case the save DC is reduced by 2.

Broodguards do not gain psionics or a poison bite, but

instead gain a rage ability.

Rage (Ex): Once per day, a broodguard can enter into a

berserk state similar to a barbarians rage. In this state, the

broodguard gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and a +2

morale bonus on Will saves, but it takes a 2 penalty to Armor

Class. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the

broodguards (newly improved) Constitution modifier.

Special Qualities: Tainted ones gain poison immunity

and spell resistance.

Poison Immunity (Ex): Tainted ones and broodguards

are immune to all forms of snake venom.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Tainted ones gain spell

resistance of 12 +1 per three levels.

Broodguards gain mental resistance.

Mental Resistance (Ex): Broodguards are immune

to hold and charm spells.

Abilities: Tainted ones, +2 Con. Broodguards,

+2 Dex, +2 Con, 4 Int, 4 Cha.

Feats: Tainted ones and broodguards gain Alert-

ness as a bonus feat due to their heightened senses.

Climate/Terrain: Warm land.

Organization: Tainted one, solitary. Broodguard,

clutch (28) or tribe (920).

Challenge Rating: Tainted one,

base creatures CR +1. Broodguard,

base creatures CR.

Treasure: Standard.

Alignment: Usually chaotic evil.

Advancement: Tainted  one,  by

character class. Broodguard: .

Level  Adjustment: Tainted

one, +1. Broodguard: +0.

CREATING

TAINTED ONES

Yuan-ti create most of their

servitors from human prison-

ers. They also may transform hu-

man worshipers who voluntarily

agree to become tainted ones.

Humans  become  tainted

ones by drinking a distilla-

tion  of  yuan-ti  venom  mixed

with certain herbs and roots.

as a sorcerer of its character level: poison (Fortitude save

against a DC of 13 + the tainted ones Con modifier) and

polymorph self (into snake or snakelike forms only).

Poison Bite (Ex): The saliva of a tainted one is poisonous

when ingested or introduced into the blood. A tainted one

can  only  inject  its  venom  while  grappling  a  foe  with

exposed skin. The Fortitude save to resist this poison has a

DC of 10 + 1/2 the tainted ones Hit Dice + the tainted ones

Con modifier. Victims who fail this save take 1d4 points of

Constitution damage. After 1 minute, they must make

another save; failure means another 1d4 points of Constitu-

Any  human  who  drinks  this  mixture,

whether by choice or by force, must make a Fortitude

saving throw (DC 16). If the saving throw fails (and volun-

teers may choose to fail it), the victim must make a Consti-

tution check (DC 15). Success on this check means the

character becomes a tainted one in a painful transforma-

tion that lasts 1d6 days. Failure means the character slowly

becomes a broodguard in 1d6+6 days.

If the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim immediately

lapses into a coma; death follows in 1 hour. A comatose

victim can be revived with a delay poison or neutralize poison

spell, if the spell is cast within 1 hour after the mixture has

141

been swallowed. A human-headed yuan-ti has the ability

to neutralize poison, and may save a comatose victim,

though this act of salvation is not for the victims benefit.

A human who makes his save may suddenly find himself

conscious again, only to face another flask of the mixture

when the yuan-ti attempts another transformation.

Only humans can become tainted ones. Nonhumans

who drink the yuan-ti mixture must make the same Forti-

tude save (DC 16), however. If the save succeeds, the non-

human is violently ill, unable to take any action for 1d4

rounds. If the save fails, the nonhuman becomes comatose

and dies in 1d4+1 rounds.

If a human fails his saving throw after drinking

the  mixture,  a  few  desperate  measures  may  pre-

vent  his  transformation  into  a

tainted one. If neutralize poi-

son,  dispel  magic,  remove

curse, and heal are  cast  on

the victim, in that order, the

transformation  process  revers-

es.  However,  the  victim  perma-

nently  loses  1  point  of  Intelli-

gence. A wish, limited wish, or mira-

cle spell  reverses  the  transforma-

tion  with  no  loss  of  Intelligence.

Once  the  transformation  is  com-

plete, only a wish or a miracle can re-

store the victim to his former self.

YUAN-TI CHARACTERS

Most  yuan-ti  characters  are  tainted

ones. Their  preferred  class  is  fighter.

A  few  broodguards  retain  enough

Intelligence  to  take  class  levels,

and their preferred class is fighter.

While  tainted  ones  often  multiclass

as rogues and, eventually, assassins, those

broodguards  with  class  levels  are  usually

fighters.

MULTIPLE TEMPLATES

Sometimes you want to create a monster that uses more

than one template. For instance, you might want a half-

dragon weretiger. This section discusses general rules for

applying multiple templates and some specific guidelines

for individual templates. In almost every case, some judg-

ment calls are necessary.

THE TYPE PYRAMID

Some creature types are easier to change than others. Some

types, such as undead, cannot change (with a few, rare

exceptions). As an aid to determining the type of a creature

with multiple templates, we can arrange the types in the

form of a pyramid. At the base of the pyramid are those

types that can be changed most easily. At the top are the

types can be changed only rarely, if at all.

Purpose of the Pyramid

Usually,  the  last  template  applied

determines  a  creatures  type.

However,  it  is  possible  that

some  template  imposes  a  crea-

ture  type  that  overrides  any  fol-

lowing  templates.  Types  higher  on  the

pyramid override lower types, even

if the lower type is applied after-

ward.  You  can  apply  the

half-dragon  template

to  an  earth  elemen-

tal,  for  instance,

and it remains an

elemental.

The  pyramid

is about creature

types,  and  does

not  dictate  the

order in which you

must apply templates.

The Pyramid from

Base to Top

Animal,  Human-

oid,  Vermin: These

types  form  the  base

of  the  pyramid.  These  are

the  simplest  creature  types,

with the fewest exotic abilities. Almost any tem-

plate applied to them overrides their type.

Magical Beast, Monstrous Humanoid: These

two types occupy the level above the base, a narrow

band  between  humanoid,  whose  type  they  override,  and

more  exotic  types  such  as  aberration,  fey,  giant,  outsider,

and  humanoid  (shapechanger),  whose  types  override

theirs).

Fey, Giant: These two types occupy the level above mag-

ical  beast  and  monstrous  humanoid.  While  they  override

pqqqqrs

TEMPLATES AND BIOLOGY

When  applying  templates,  the  rules  are  more  important

than anatomy. With all the polymorph spells, shapechangers,

alter form, and similar abilities in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

game, there is no point in worrying about size or anatomy.

Any  creature  can  produce  any  offspring,  and  you  can

describe  that  offspring  using  a  template.  Also  remember

pqqqqrs

that the parents may be creatures not yet published. Many

templates occur through the influence of magic, rather than

biology.  The  rules,  and  your  imagination,  should  be  your

guide.

When adding multiple templates, halves become quarters.

A creature with both half-celestial and half-dragon templates

becomes a quarter-celestial/quarter-dragon creature.

animal,  humanoid,  magical  beast,  and  monstrous  human-

oids, other types override theirs.

Dragon, Humanoid (Shapechanger): These two types

occupy the level above fey and giant.

Aberration: This type sits alone at the level above dragon

and humanoid (shapechanger).

Elemental, Ooze, Plant: These three types occupy the

level just below the top. If some other template is applied to

them, they generally retain whichever of these three types

they have.

Construct, Outsider, Undead: These three types reside

at the top of the pyramid. Once a creature becomes an

undead or a construct through the application of a tem-

plete, it cannot become something else. Once a creature

stops being a native of the Material Plane, it becomes an

outsider and stays one.

ORDER

Building a creature with multiple templates follows all

previously presented rules. Apply one template at a time

until you complete your monster.

Before you begin, plan the process. Decide each tem-

plate you want to apply and choose your base creature.

Make sure you choose a base creature eligible for the first

template. If the first template changes the base creatures

type or ability scores, make sure the new creature will be

eligible for the next template. Perform this check for each

template you intend to apply.

Apply the first template completely to create a new

base creature. Then apply the next template and so on,

until you apply the final one.

If at any time the base creature becomes ineligible for

the next template, you must stop. A creature may become

ineligible because of ability score changes or because its

type changes. For instance, the lycanthrope template can

only be added to humanoids. An elf with the tauric tem-

plate becomes a monstrous humanoid and cannot then

become a lycanthrope. Conversely, a lycanthrope elf is a

humanoid (shapechanger) and cannot become a tauric

creature. Each rules the other out.

Your  base  creature  must  be  able  to  meet  physical

(Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) requirements for the

new template. If a template does not state a physical

requirement, you must assume that all living creatures

have these scores. Undead and constructs, for instance, do

not  have  Constitution  scores  and  therefore  cannot

become any other creature type.

A creature that lacks a mental ability score (Intelli-

gence, Wisdom, Charisma) can still take on a new tem-

plate. For instance, an ooze generally has no Intelligence,

but can still take on other templates that apply to oozes as

long as they do not require a minimum Intelligence. For

instance, a gelatinous creature can take on the celestial

template because celestial templates have no minimum

Intelligence requirement. It could not become half-celes-

tial because that template requires a minimum Intelli-

gence of 4.

The last template applied determines the final crea-

ture type, unless the current type is higher on the type

pyramid (see The Type Pyramid, above).

For example, normally a dog (animal) cannot be a half-

celestial because it lacks the requisite Intelligence score.

It can, however, be a half-dragon. A half-dragon dog has

enough Intelligence to allow its offspring to be half-celes-

tial. The resulting quarter-dragon/quarter-celestial dog is

an outsider.

NOTES ON SPECIFIC TEMPLATES

Celestial: Although the text says it can be added to any

corporeal creature of nonevil alignment, the base creature

must be living. This template cannot be added to undead

or constructs. It can, however, be added to outsiders. It is

therefore possible to create a creature that is part celestial

and  part  celestiala  mix  of  archon  and  eladrin,  for

instance.

Feral Creature: Feral creatures may be little better than

predatory animals, depending on their Intelligence, despite

having the monstrous humanoid type.

Fiendish: Although the text says it can be added to any

corporeal creature of nongood alignment, the base creature

must be living. This template cannot be added to undead or

constructs. It can, however, be added to outsiders. The

fiendish template can be used to create creatures that are

part demon and part devil.

Gelatinous: Although they are unstable in form, gelati-

nous creatures are not amorphous. They each have a partic-

ular form.

Ghost: A key note for all templates that create incorpo-

real or ethereal undead is that special abilities of the base

creature that depend on physical attacks (essentially, all

extraordinary abilities) no longer function except against

ethereal creatures. A yuan-ti ghost, for instance, cannot

poison anyone. Supernatural and spell-like abilities func-

tion normally, provided they do not require physical con-

tact. Even breath weapons cease functioning.

Ghost Brute: See Ghost, above.

Half-Celestial: Creatures with this template retain their

wings if, somehow, another template is layered on top of it.

If that template has wings also, the creatures wings look

like those of the half-celestial. As with celestial, half-celes-

tial can be added to outsiders in order to create a half-celes-

tial azer, for example.

Half-Dragon: Creatures with this template retain their

wings if another template is layered on top of it. This tem-

plate can be applied to dragons to create combinations of

pqqrs

TYPE VERSUS SUBTYPE

The pyramid applies to creature types, not subtypes. A creature

generally only has one type, and the pyramid helps determine

which type a creature has. A creature may have many subtypes.

In general, a creature may have one humanoid subtype such as

goblinoid or dwarf (if it is humanoid), two alignment subtypes

(either  law  or  chaos  and  either  good  or  evil),  one  elemental

subtype,  one  energy  subtype,  and  any  number  of  other

subtypes such as reptilian, aquatic, or incorporeal.

species, such as a half-red black dragon. A creature that is

one-quarter dragon and one-quarter celestial or fiendish

has the wings of its outsider heritage.

Half-Fiendish: Creatures with this template retain their

wings if, somehow, another template is layered on top of it.

If that template has wings also, the creatures wings look

like those of the half-fiend. As with fiendish, half-fiendish

can be added to outsiders in order to create a half-fiendish

chaos beast, for example.

Incarnate Construct: This is a very specific template

intended to turn some constructs, such as stone golems,

into humanoids or giants. The primary benefit of this tem-

plate is that it provides a way for golems to become player

characters.

Insectile: No special notes.

Lich: When a character becomes a lich, all its Hit Dice

become d12s. Any dice earned afterward for class levels are

also d12s, regardless of the class.

Lycanthrope: The template list shows that several tem-

plates (celestial, fiendish, gelatinous, ghost, ghost brute, half-

celestial, half-dragon, half-fiendish, multiheaded, spectral,

and umbral) apply to humanoids as well as creatures of other

types. Lycanthrope, however, only applies to humanoids. If a

template changes the base creatures type to something other

than humanoid, a lycanthrope with that template must be a

natural lycanthrope rather than an afflicted one. A half-

dragon, for instance, is immune to the curse of lycanthropy

because you cannot layer the lycanthrope template on crea-

tures with the dragon type. However, a lycanthrope and a

dragon can produce a half-dragon lycanthrope. Any other

template besides lycanthrope only affects the lycanthropes

humanoid (true) form. When it changes shape, a lycanthrope

follows the rules for polymorph self.

Monstrous Beast: This template lets you grant some

exotic abilities to animals or vermin, in case being undead,

draconic, or multiheaded is not exotic enough! Such magi-

cal beasts are very appropriate for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS

games.

Mummified: One of the few intelligent, corporeal

undead, mummies retain many of the physical features

they had in life. For instance, a mummified eagle still has

wings and can still fly.

Reptilian: If combined with a template that lives prima-

rily in the desert, give the reptilian a burrow speed equal to

half its land speed and drop the swim speed. If combined

with a template that lives primarily in cold conditions, the

reptilians Climate/Terrain entry takes precedence.

Spectral: Spectral creatures are not the spawn of spectres

unless the base creature is humanoid. Instead, they are

independent forms of incorporeal undead. See Ghost for

notes.

Symbiotic: It is entirely possible that this template

raises the Intelligence score of the guest, since the mini-

mum Intelligence of the resulting template is 3, and ani-

mals, plants, and vermin all have Intelligences scores lower

than 3. In most cases, the resulting aberration is signifi-

cantly less intelligent than the humanoid host.

Tauric: While the centaur and the drider are good visual

examples of tauric creatures, they follow their own rules as

specific monsters. When building your own tauric mon-

sters, follow the rules of the template.

Umbral: Umbral creatures are not the spawn of shadows

unless the base creature is humanoid. Instead, they are

independent forms of incorporeal undead. See Ghost for

notes.

Vampire: When a character becomes a vampire, all its

Hit Dice become d12s. Any dice earned afterward for class

levels are also d12s, regardless of class.

Wight: Like mummies, wights are corporeal undead.

They retain many of the physical features they had in life.

For instance, a wight troglodyte retains its stench ability.

Winged: No special notes.

Wraith: Wraith creatures are not the spawn of wraiths

unless the base creature is humanoid. Instead, they are

independent forms of incorporeal undead. See Ghost for

notes.

Multiheaded Creature: If you add additional templates,

Yuan-ti: No special notes.

the creature retains its multiple heads.

BREAKING THE RULES

If  you  want  to  take  some  risks  and  venture  into  territory  not

covered  by  the  rules,  you  can  combine  templates  in  any  way

you  like  and  apply  them  to  whatever  creatures  you  like.  You

gain a monster unique to your campaign at the expense of a

few extra decisions.

Suppose you want to create a ghost barghest. Normally the

ghost  template  does  not  apply  to  outsiders,  so  the  resulting

creature  breaks  the  rules.  The  template  does  not  change  the

creatures  size,  but  it  does  change  the  type.  Undead  and

outsider are both at the top of the pyramid, so the creatures

type depends on which is more advantageous. If your adven-

tures occur on an Outer Plane, you might want to leave it as an

outsider. If so, Hit Dice should probably stay the same, and the

ghost barghest should have a Constitution score and vulnera-

bility  to  most  effects  requiring  Fortitudes  saves.  It  could  still

gain  the  incorporeal  subtype.  The  undead  type  possesses

some  significant  advantages,  so  for  this  example  we  change

the type to undead and the Hit Dice to d12s. The ghost bargh-

est  loses  its  Constitution  score  but  gains  immunity  to  any

effect that requires a Fortitude save, unless it affects objects.

The  ghost  barghest  now  has  Charisma  18.  It  now  has  39  hit

points, a small gain despite losing its Constitution bonus. Its

Fortitude  save  drops  to  +5,  since  it  loses  its  Constitution

bonus.  It  has  no  Constitution-based  skills.  Its  Bluff  and

Intimidate  skill  modifiers  increase  to  +13  because  of  its

increased  Charisma.  The  new  Charisma  score  also  increases

the  DC  for  its  spell-like  abilities  to  14  +  spell  level,  and  the

ghost barghest must manifest to affect targets on the Material

Plane. Otherwise, the special attacks and special qualities of a

ghost  apply  just  as  well  to  this  creature  as  to  any  normally

covered by the template.

f you are a DM, chances are your players will want to

build new characters when they see this book. Some,

however, will want to transform their existing characters

into monsters. This chapter provides information to use

when that happens.

A DM never has to allow a character to transform from a

standard race to a monster. Even in the case of monsters

that transform victims into monsters of the same kind by

killing them, the DM may decide that this type of transfor-

mation does not necessarily produce a monster that can be

a character. In the case of lycanthropy or some form of

transformation that takes place after a characters death,

the DM may decide to simply take the character and make

an NPC from it. As for voluntary ritual transformation

(detailed in this chapter), the DM need never allow it, or

she may determine that this method of transformation is

unavailable until she is more comfortable with the idea.

EFFECTS OF

TRANSFORMATION

Once a character transforms, she has a new effective char-

acter level. This ECL determines how many experience

points she needs to gain her next class level, and how many

experience points her party gets from each encounter. The

DM must explain these effects to her players before allow-

ing them to begin transforming their characters.

For example, a human rogue just gained 5th level

and has 10,000 experience points. On her next adven-

ture, a wererat bites her. The rogue decides she wants

the abilities that lycanthropy brings; perhaps envi-

sioning a gang of wererat thieves all working for her.

She voluntarily fails her Fortitude save against the

curse of lycanthropy (see Lycanthropes, below) and,

after her first change, becomes a wererat. Now her

ECL is 8. Instead of needing 5,000 experience

points to go from 5th level to 6th, she needs 26,000

experience points (the difference between 5th and

9th level). The average level of her party increases,

so everyone gets fewer experience points from

the ensuing encounters (see Table 71: Experi-

ence Point Awards in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide)

unless  the  DM  tweaks  those  encounters  to

increase their Encounter Level. When she has

36,000 experience points, the rogue can add her

6th level as a rogue (or any other class level she

chooses), and she will be an ECL 9 character.

She needs 9,000 XP to reach her next level (the

difference between 9th and 10th level).

After the character transforms, the charac-

ters ECL should be 15 or lower for reasons dis-

cussed in the Maximum Levels sidebar in Chap-

ter 2: Building Monster Characters. While

ritual transformation is possible for higher- 145

AS

level characters, those who know the rituals generally do

not undertake the transformation process for someone who

may then usurp their authority or who is not likely to adven-

ture long enough to pay them back.

ALIGNMENT CHANGE

If a character transforms to a kind of monster that always

has a particular alignment, and the character did not origi-

nally have that alignment, the transforming character

makes a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the goal monsters Hit Dice

+ the goal monsters Wis modifier) to avoid an involuntary

alignment change. Modify the DC as follows:

Monsters alignment is one step removed from

characters original alignment

(for instance, character NG and monster LG)

Monsters alignment is two steps removed from

characters original alignment (for instance,

character NG and monster LN, or character NG

and monster NE)

Monsters alignment is diametrically opposed to

characters original alignment (for instance,

character LG and monster CE)

CLASSES AND SPELLS

Ways already exist to change a characters creature type from

a standard-race humanoid to something else. Monks, for

instance, become outsiders at 20th level. Several prestige

classes presented in books such as Tome and Blood allow grad-

ual changes to outsider, half-dragon, and other types. Appro-

priate rules appear in the class descriptions.

The reincarnate spell also provides an opportunity for a

character to transform. Pixies and satyrs are on the table in

the spell description (see Chapter 11 of the Players Hand-

book), but so is Other. Talk to your DM about your desire to

alter your character; then, if your character dies, your DM

may allow that character to be reincarnated as a creature

type chosen by the two of you.

The effects of casting a wish spell to change a creatures

type are discussed in Rituals, later in this chapter.

MONSTERS

Several monsters have the ability to transform their victims

into creatures of their kind. However, no transformation that

reduces a victims Intelligence to lower than 3 can produce a

player character. Transformations that wipe out memories of

a characters previous life are not recommended, but the

emancipated spawn prestige class (see Chapter 7 of this book)

presents one way of dealing with a character who becomes a

ghoul, shadow, or other type of spawn. Otherwise, use the

rules in this book to alter ability scores, change Hit Dice to

reflect the new creature type, and enforce any enslavement of

characters, such as that caused by wights and vampires.

Several kinds of monsters that transform their victims are

discussed below.

Bodak: A  humanoid  killed  by  a  bodaks  death  gaze

becomes a bodak one day later, its type changing to undead.

The chief drawbacks to this type of transformation are that

few humanoids want to be near the hideous visage of a bodak,

the bodaks flashbacks may betray it into inaction, and it

becomes vulnerable to sunlight. (Primarily for these reasons,

the bodak is not considered an appropriate choice for a mon-

ster PC; see Appendix 2 of this book for a complete list of all

recommended monsters.) The new bodak has no obligation

or tie to the bodak that killed the new bodaks previous form.

Drider: According to the Monster Manual, when a drow of

above average ability (and all player characters are, in some

way, above average) reaches 6th level, the deity Lolth may

put him or her through a special test. Those who fail the test

become driders (and their type changes to aberration).

Unlike other sorts of monster transformations, this one

requires that the base creature be of an unusual race (drow)

to begin with. Further, that creature must be a cleric, wizard,

or sorcerer. This sort of transformation also requires access

to a temple of Lolth, so the base creature must be one that is

accepted in drow society, meaning it is most likely neutral

evil in alignment. You can create a drider by applying the

tauric template found in Chapter 10 of this book.

Once transformed, the drider is an outcast from drow

society. Drider clerics retain their spells, domains, domain

spells, and granted powers. Drider wizards keep their spells

and bonus feats, and may continue preparing those spells

normally. Drider sorcerers keep their spells and may con-

tinue preparing those spells normally. Any additional cleric,

sorcerer, or wizard levels earned as a drider add to the char-

acters previous six levels. If a character meets the require-

ments, the DM should consider the impact of the driders

spells and spell-like abilities on the game before allowing

this transformation.

Ghost: The DM may allow deceased characters to remain

in contact with their former lives by becoming ghosts (see

the template in the Monster Manual). Such a character

changes its type to undead. Ghosts feature many of the same

challenges as vampires: They can easily negotiate obstacles

that would stop or delay a party of corporeal beings, they are

exceedingly difficult to kill, and they can possess living

beings. Such characters are best suited to single adventures,

passing on when they accomplish some business they left

unfinished in life.

Ghoul: Ghouls present fewer problems than ghosts,

liches, or vampires because they are limited to conventional

forms of movement and can die relatively easily. A character

who becomes a ghoul changes his or her type to undead.  The

DM should enforce the need for the character to feed on car-

rion, and emphasize the horror with which most people

react to ghouls. Since the base creature is always chaotic evil,

ghoul player characters of other alignments are rare.

Lich: Transforming into a lich (see the template in the

Monster Manual) requires a character to have at least eleven

levels of cleric, sorcerer, or wizard just to create the phylac-

tery. Player characters who become liches change their type

to undead. They do not have to change their alignment to

evil; however, they do not gain the fear aura supernatural

ability unless they do. The DM should review the immortal

nature of the lich, and its relationship to its phylactery,

before allowing such a character in the game. Because a lich

is effectively immortal unless its phylactery is destroyed,

many conventional threats it may encounter while adven-

turing lose their value.

Lycanthrope: Another way to transform a characters

type is by making it into a lycanthrope (see the template in

the Monster Manual). Those who contract lycanthropy after

starting as humanoids change their type to humanoid

(shapechanger) during play. A character who wants the

transformation to take effect can voluntarily fail his or her

Fortitude save to resist the curse of lycanthropy.

Those who contract lycanthropy can learn Control Shape

as a class skill (see the skill description in Appendix 3 of the

Monster Manual), and they gain a number of other benefits as

outlined in the template description. Any time the character

changes  to  animal  form,  the  DM  takes  control  of  it  and

treats it as a wild animal of the appropriate kind. The players

loss of control occurs due to the characters decrease in In-

telligence (animals always have Int of lower than 3) and the

characters change in behavior, not because of any change of

alignment. The player retains control of the character when

it is in humanoid or hybrid form.

Shadow,  Spectre, Wight,  and Wraith: All  four  of  these

transformed creatures appear within rounds of when the vic-

tim was slain. In all cases, the characters type changes to un-

dead. A major drawback to shadows, spectres, and wraiths as

characters  is  their  inability  to  physically  interact  with  the

real world except through their draining touch attacks. As

a result, they are unlikely to get a good reception anywhere.

Since the base creature is always of a specific evil alignment,

characters of other alignments are rare. Shadow characters

spawned from a shadows Strength drain attack are under

the original shadows control while it exists.

Slaad: The bite of a blue slaad transforms arcane spell-

casters into green slaad and other characters into red slaad.

In either case, the characters type changes to outsider. The

transformation takes one week, but leaves the characters

mind and memory intact. In addition, no bond exists

between the transformed character and the blue slaad; the

transformed character is free to act independently.

Vampire: The weaknesses of a vampire (see the template

description in the Monster Manual) may not deter players

from wanting to try such a character. The DM should care-

fully review the special abilities of vampires, as well as their

weaknesses, before allowing them in the game. Domination,

energy drain, and blood drain are all powerful attacks.

Gaseous form, spider climb, and alternate form all allow the

character to circumvent traps and various other challenges.

On the other hand, a vampires inability to enter private

buildings or to cross running water make adventuring prob-

lematic for the character. In addition, the difficulty in

killing a vampire may make such characters a greater danger

than their level suggests.

Assuming  a  player  character  can  convince  a  vampire  to

drain his or her Constitution via its blood drain attack rather

than killing him or her outright via its energy drain attack,

the transformation is relatively simple. If a character with 5

or  more  Hit  Dice  (from  any  combination  of  base  creature

HD  and  HD  from  class  levels)  dies  because  a  vampire  re-

duces his or her Constitution to 0, that character rises as a

vampire 1d4 days after burial. Such characters are normally

chaotic  evil;  however,  player  characters  can  always  be  ex-

ceptions (see Keeping Alignment, above). Newly risen vam-

pires remain slaves of their master, regardless of alignment,

until the masters death.

Vargouille:  A  vargouille  may  kiss  a  paralyzed  character

and transform that character into a vargouille (changing its

type  to  outsider).  The  transformation  takes  424  hours,  as-

suming no interruption by sunlight or a daylight spell, and no

reversal of the transformation using remove disease. The loss of

Intelligence probably makes this transformed creature unde-

sirable for use as a player character. Another serious problem

for a PC is the loss of humanoid limbs and the corresponding

loss of the ability to manipulate weapons and equipment.

RITUALS

A ritual is a method of permanently transforming a willing

character  into  a  monster  of  a  certain  kind. There  are  both

minor and major rituals. Where minor rituals change some

aspect of a character, major rituals change the character into

an entirely different creature.

A ritualist (a spellcaster versed in the conducting of one

or more rituals) is necessary for the performance of any rit-

ual. Player character spellcasters can learn how to conduct

the rituals described below. A ritualist cannot conduct a rit-

ual on herself.

A spellcaster may learn a single ritual each time she gains

a new spell level. For instance, a wizard can learn a ritual at

1st  level  (when  she  gains  1st-level  spells),  3rd  level  (when

she  gains  2nd-level  spells),  5th  level  (when  she  gains  3rd-

level  spells),  and  so  on.  A  spellcaster  cannot  learn  a  ritual

that requires a specific spell (wish or polymorph other) unless

she can cast that spell.

MINOR RITUALS

Some characters may wish to gain the benefits of a particu-

lar type or subtype of monster, without actually becoming a

specific kind of monster. For instance, a character may wish

to gain the goblinoid subtype in order to use goblinoid-

specific magic items. Another character may want a specific

subtype in order to qualify for a prestige class. Minor rituals

allow these sorts of transformations.

Ritual Cost: A ritualist charges a number of gold pieces

equal to 1,000  her caster level for one performance of a

ritual. In addition, the rituals themselves have costs (in gold

pieces and experience points) specified in their descriptions

that must be paid by the subject character.

Ritual Time: A minor ritual takes 24 hours, during which

the character and the ritualist can do nothing other than

conduct the ritual, rest, eat, sleep, or talk. Any interruption

ruins the ritual, which must be started over.

Ritual Caster Level: Caster levels are specified in the

ritual descriptions.

If a ritual is interrupted, the ritualist requires another pay-

ment, but the character loses no experience points. Com-

pleting the ritual drains any experience points from the sub-

ject during the final hour. No spell, not even restoration, can

bring back the spent experience points. Characters may not

spend experience points they do not have.

Level Adjustment: This number modifies the characters

ECL by the amount shown.

Ritual of Alignment

This minor ritual gives the character an alignment subtype

(chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) or changes an existing align-

ment subtype. The benefit is significant primarily to out-

siders, changing the way certain spells and items affect them.

The successful completion of this ritual requires the charac-

ter to make a Will save. The save DC and the consequences

for failure vary depending on the relationship between the

characters alignment and the desired subtype (see below). In

all cases, success acquires the desired subtype (or makes the

desired change) and changes the characters alignment to

match the subtype. Succeeding

by 5 or more accomplishes the

ritual  without  changing  the

characters alignment.

Opposed: Any good align-

ment  is  opposed  to  any  evil

alignment,  and  any  chaotic

alignment  is  opposed  to  any

lawful alignment. Changing to

a subtype opposed to a charac-

ters alignment is very danger-

ous. If a character attempts to

gain  an  alignment  subtype

opposed to his present align-

ment, he must make a Will save

(DC 20). If he fails, the ritual

kills him.

Different but not Opposed:

If a character attempts to gain

an alignment subtype that is

neither his nor opposed to his

(for  instance,  a  neutral  good

character attempting to gain the

chaotic subtype), he must make

a Will save (DC 15). If he fails,

the ritual changes his alignment

to  match  the  subtype  and  he

gains one negative level. The charac-

ters new experience point total is midway

between the minimum needed for the new

level and the minimum needed for the next one. If the

character was 1st level, he loses 1 point of Constitution

instead of gaining one negative level. This negative level or

Constitution loss cannot be offset by any mortal spell, even

wish or miracle, thought the character can improve his Con-

stitution normally. If he succeeds, the ritual still changes his

alignment to match the subtype. If the characters align-

ment ever changes from that of the subtype, the subtype and

its benefits are lost. The character may repeat the ritual after

losing the subtype and gain it again, suffering the same

forced alignment change.

Subtype Same as Alignment: Gaining a subtype that

matches some part of a characters alignment (such as a neu-

tral good character trying to gain the good subtype) is rela-

tively simple. The character makes a Will save (DC 10). If he

succeeds, he gains the subtype. If he fails, the ritual ends

without changing the character. Any gold pieces spent are

lost, but experience points are not.

This ritual requires a 7th-level cleric who has the appro-

priate alignment domain as one of his domains.

Ritual Cost: This ritual costs the subject 56,000 gold pieces

and 2,240 XP.

Level Adjustment: +0.

Ritual of Association

This minor ritual gives the character a racial subtype or type

modifier such as gnoll, goblinoid, orc, or reptilian. (This ritual

does not grant the human, dwarf, elf, gnome, and

halfling subtypes of humanoid.) The character

gains minor manifestations of the physical appear-

ance of that subtype (DCs for Disguise

checks increase by +5), but no abili-

ties of that monster kind. The bene-

fit of this ritual is that the character

can use items as if it were a mem-

ber of that subtype. Therefore, a

magic sword with additional functions

when wielded by an orc would also

allow access to those functions for

someone who successfully com-

pleted this ritual to obtain the orc

subtype.

This ritual requires a 7th-level transmuter

who knows polymorph other.

Ritual of the Elements

This ritual imbues a character with

an elemental (air, earth, fire, water)

or energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire)

subtype  or  modifier.  The  character

becomes immune to the appropriate

energy type or element, and takes

double damage from its opposing

energy or element unless a saving throw

for half damage is allowed. The character is subject

to all spells that affect that element or energy type.

This obvious physical change increases the DC for Disguise

ify whether he can breathe salt water or fresh water. The

ritual can provide either, and a second performance of the

ritual allows the character to breathe both.

Level Adjustment: +0, or +1 if playing in a maritime or

Ritual of Transfiguration

This ritual makes a character incorporeal. On completion of

the ritual, the character no longer has a physical body. She can

be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, +1 or better

magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural

abilities. She is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even

when hit by spells or magic weapons, she has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for force

effects, such as magic missile, or attacks made with ghost touch

weapons). An incorporeal creature has no natural armor but

has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma modifier (always

at least +1, even if the creatures Charisma score does not nor-

mally provide a bonus).

An incorporeal character can pass through solid objects at

will,  but  not  force  effects.  Her  attack  passes  through

(ignores) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflec-

tion bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work

normally against it. An incorporeal character moves silently

and cannot be heard with Listen checks if she does not wish

to be. She has no Strength score, so her Dexterity modifier

applies to both her melee and her ranged attacks.

Lacking a physical body, an incorporeal character cannot

manipulate physical objects unless they have the ghost

touch property.

This ritual requires a 17th-level cleric with the Animal

domain as one of his domains.

archers in your campaign might hold the knowledge of how

to transform potential candidates into elves, or the clergy of

Gruumsh might know how to transform worthy devotees

into orcs.

The three major rituals are the ritual of unlearning, the

ritual of vitality, and casting wish. The DM decides which

major rituals are available in the campaign.

Ritual Cost: A ritualist requires a number of gold pieces

equal to 1,000  caster level  the starting ECL of the goal

creature. Alternatively, most orders accept payment in serv-

ice. The transformed character may go on quests, recruit

other  candidates,  or  join  in  worship. The  DM  should

enforce these requirements and use them to spawn new

adventures.

Ritual Time: Major rituals can require a great deal more

time than minor rituals. During that time, the character must

participate in periodic ritual activities. These activities may

occur daily, weekly, or monthly depending on the ritual.

Each periodic activity requires at least eight consecutive

hours of participation, during which the character can do

nothing other than conduct the ritual, rest, eat, sleep, or talk.

Missing one of these periodic activities ruins the ritual,

which must be started over. A character undergoing the

ritual of unlearning (see below) who is interrupted must

start earning levels again. If a character is interrupted while

undergoing the ritual of vitality, the experience points are

not lost. If a chcracter is interrupted during the ritual of

casting wish, any price paid to cast the spell, and the experi-

ence points spent for the spell, are lost. The ritualist natu-

rally insists on another payment, and more time to prepare,

before casting the spell again.

Ritual Caster Level: The caster level for a major ritual is

the starting ECL of the goal creature (minimum 7th) or the

minimum caster level of the required spell, whichever is

higher.

ECL OF THE GOAL CREATURE

When  transforming  an  existing  character  into  a  new  race  or

creature type by means of a major ritual, the goal creature is

what  the  character  wishes  to  become.  If  a  human  wants  to

become an ogre, the goal creature is ogre. The cost to trans-

form a character using a major ritual is based on the starting

ECL of the goal creature (the HD of the base creature plus level

adjustment;  see  Appendix  2:  Compiled  Tables).  The  more

powerful  the  goal  creature,  the  more  expensive  the  ritual  is.

pqqqqrs

It is possible to use the information in Chapter 3: Classes in

conjunction  with  major  rituals.  A  character  may  become  a

monster  at  a  level  lower  than  its  starting  ECL  by  using  the

guidelines  in  that  chapter.  Doing  this  reduces  the  time  and

cost of any major ritual the character undergoes. The character

advances as that monster until reaching its starting ECL, and

then may resume gaining class levels normally.

character to pay this amount in stagesa number of gold

pieces equal to 1,000  caster level each time he gains a level

until the character pays the entire fee.

Ritual Caster Level: The starting ECL of the goal creature

(minimum 7th).

Characters using this major ritual earn experience and gain

levels normally. However, once they earn class levels equal

to the starting ECL of the goal creature, they sacrifice that

many class levels and gain the starting ECL of the goal crea-

ture. The transformation is gradual and occurs while the

character is gaining the requisite levels. Other characters

can notice changes in height, skin, hair, eyes, teeth, and so

forth before the ritual is complete. If a character multi-

classes while earning these levels, then when he trades

levels he retains only those he had when he began the ritual.

For example, a 1st-level elf fighter wishes to become an

ogre. An ogres starting ECL is 6, so the ritual requires a ritu-

alist of 7th caster level and costs 42,000 gold pieces. The DM

tells the player that the elf fighter must pay 7,000 gold

pieces (42,000 gold pieces divided by six levels) to the ritual-

ist every time the elf fighter gains a level until the fee is paid.

The elf gradually transforms into an ogre while earning six

class levels. Every seventh day (six days separate each ritual

activity), he spends 8 hours performing ritual activities

during which he does nothing other than conduct the

ritual, rest, eat, sleep, or talk. Upon reaching 6th level, he

becomes a 1st-level ogre fighter, regardless of which classes

contributed to those six levels, because he was a 1st-level

fighter when he began the ritual.

Trading levels is generally best for lower-level, single-

class characters who decide to transform, because they have

plenty of time to earn levels in their current form and class,

and still have a lot of time left to advance in level after trans-

forming. If your players have low-level characters and you

want them to have time to adventure after transforming,

this ritual is a good choice.

Ritual of Vitality

This major ritual trades experience points for the starting

ECL of the goal creature.

Ritual Time: This ritual takes a number of days equal to the

ECL of the goal creature, minimum one day. Ritual activities

occur each day.

Ritual Cost: A number of experience points sufficient to

earn class levels equivalent to the goal creatures starting

ECL, minimum 1,000 XP. As with any major ritual, the sub-

ject character also pays the ritualist a number of gold pieces

equal to 1,000  caster level  the starting ECL of the goal

creature. The DM should allow a character to pay this

amount in stagesa number of gold pieces equal to 1,000 

caster level each time he gains a level until the character

pays the entire fee.

Ritual Caster Level: The starting ECL of the goal creature

(minimum 7th).

The character pays the number of experience points it

would take to gain a number of levels equal to the goal crea-

tures ECL. A character using this method to become a gnoll

would need to pay 3,000 XP, since a gnolls starting ECL is 3

and it takes 3,000 experience points to become a 3rd-level

character. No spell, not even restoration, can bring back the

lost experience points.

A character may spend so many experience points that he

loses levels. If you decide to do this, be careful not to lose so

many levels that, even with the addition of the goal crea-

tures Hit Dice, your monster character cannot survive the

threats your group faces. Characters may not spend experi-

ence points they do not have. Experience points are not

spent until the completion of the ritual. If the ritual is inter-

rupted, the character loses nothing but the time he already

spent on it, and he may start the ritual again later.

Paying the experience point cost all at once, or in large

partial amounts, is a quick way to complete this ritual for

higher-level characters with the experience points to

spend. If you have players with high-level characters and

want to allow the characters to transform, this ritual is an

ideal method. The loss of experience points may even

extend the time those characters have available to continue

adventuring.

Wish

A spellcaster casts wish and transforms the character.

Ritual Time: 1 action, as the spell.

Ritual Cost: The ritualist must spend 5,000 XP (the spells

XP component). The ritualist charges the subject a number

of gold pieces equal to caster level  90, plus an additional

25,000 gp (to compensate for the experience point loss).

Ritual Caster Level: 17th, as the spell.

Casting wish to become a new kind of creature, with full

access to all extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abili-

ties (see End Result, below), while retaining Intelligence,

memory, and personality, falls under the wishing for

greater effects rules in the spell description. While this is

the quickest method of transformation and potentially the

least expensive, it has substantial risks.

The DM may, for instance, require the spellcaster to make

a Spellcraft check. For every point by which the check result

exceeds 20, the transforming character gains a 5% chance to

have the goal creatures abilities. The transforming character

must roll for each ability. For instance, if the spellcaster gets

a 28 on her Spellcraft check, the transforming character has

a 40% chance to have any of the goal creatures abilities. He

rolls for each special attack or special quality, and each time

he gets a 61 or higher on d%, he gains that ability. It is

entirely possible to fail every roll and gain the characteris-

tics of a goal creature but none of the creatures special

attacks or special qualities.

Wish is expensive (a cost of at least 26,530 gold pieces) and

may not work. Since characters of lower than 8th level

shouldnt be able to afford this method of transformation, a

DM who uses this ritual it is setting a minimum level at

which transformation can occur. If the DM wishes to dis-

courage transformation, she can enforce the Spellcraft

check described above. If so, she must inform her players

that transforming via wish may not grant all the special abil-

ities and special qualities of the goal creature.

END RESULT

When your characters transformation is complete, he or

she permanently acquires the physical, natural, extraordi-

nary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of the chosen crea-

ture type while retaining his or her mind. Physical abilities

include natural size and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitu-

tion scores. Natural abilities also include mundane move-

ment capabilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow

you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-

weapon attacks) than normal.

Your characters equipment does not meld into your char-

acters new form and is not affected in any way, except that

magical items resize to your characters new size.

Your characters new physical ability scores and faculties

are average ones for the chosen creature. You do not modify

them using elite ability score modifiers, nor do you reroll

them from scratch.

Your character retains his or her level and class, hit points

(modified by changes in your characters Constitution

score), base attack bonus, and base save bonuses (new

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final

attack and save bonuses). A change in alignment may cause

loss of class abilities and prevent further advancement in the

class. Your characters type changes to the chosen creatures

type (and subtype, if applicable). Your character loses any

extraordinary abilities, spells, or spell-like abilities associ-

ated with his or her previous kind. Your character can cast

spells (assuming your character knows how) for which your

character has the requisite components. Your character

needs  a  humanlike  voice  for  verbal  components  and

humanlike hands for somatic components.

Your character is accustomed to his or her new form and

suffers no disorientation.

CHANGING BACK

Your character may start as some kind of creature other than

humanoid if the DM uses the rules in this book. The above

methods for transformation still apply.

Any of the rituals described above can transform a mon-

ster character into another kind of monster or into a member

of one of the standard races. The cost is the same even if the

character suffers a drop in ECL. The ECL of the goal creature

determines the time and cost in levels or experience points.

Example: Ritual Transformation that Increases ECL

A 6th-level dwarf barbarian tires of his slow speed and squat

stature. He decides to become an ogre (starting ECL 6). The

dwarf considers the ritual of unlearning. He would have to

find a 7th-level caster who knows the ritual, and pay the

caster 42,000 gp (1,000  starting ECL 6  minimum caster

level 7th). Paying 7,000 gp each time he gained a class level

would slow his acquisition of treasure at first, but in the

space of a few levels it would be a drop in the bucket. Every

seven days he would have to spend eight hours in one day

conducting ritual activities. After earning six class levels, he

would become a 6th-level ogre barbarian (ECL 12).

Alternatively, he could simply undergo a six-day ritual of

vitality. He would have to find a 7th-level caster who knows

the ritual and pay the caster 42,000 gold pieces. Going from

1st to 6th level costs 15,000 experience points, so he would

sacrifice that amount, leaving him with less than 1,000 XP.

He would be a 1st-level ogre barbarian (ECL 7). In six days,

he would effectively gain a character level. However, unless

he is a very unusual 6th-level barbarian, he does not have

42,000 gold pieces that he can spend in six days time.

If he found a 17th-level wizard willing to cast wish, the

transformation would cost him 26,530 gold pieces. Again,

unless he is a very unusual 6th-level barbarian, he has

roughly 13,000 gold pieces worth of coin and equipment,

and thus cannot afford this method either.

At the end of his ritual, he would have an ogres average

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, and his own

Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. He would be a

Large giant, with reach, and capable of using larger weapons.

His land speed would increase to 30 feet. He would gain +5

natural armor. Darkvision would remain unchanged. He

would lose stonecunning, his racial bonuses on saving

throws, his racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and gob-

linoids, his dodge bonus against giants, and his racial

bonuses on Appraise and Craft checks.

After weighing his gains and losses, he decides to remain

a dwarf and seek out some speed-enhancing magic items.

Example: Ritual Transformation that Decreases ECL

A 6th-level ogre barbarian (ECL 12) tires of the prejudices

against his kind and decides to transform into an elf. A basic

elf has an ECL of 1, so the minimum costs apply for all ritual

transformations. A ritual of unlearning would require him

to sacrifice one level. It would only take one day, and a 7th-

level caster could perform it. The cost would be a mere 7,000

gp. At the end of the ritual, he would be a 5th-level elf bar-

barian (ECL 5).

A ritual of vitality would have the same cost in gold

pieces, would also take only one day, and would require sac-

rificing 1,000 XP. Depending on how many experience

points he already has, he might not lose a level.

If he found a 17th-level wizard willing to cast wish, it

would cost him 26,530 gold pieces. Unless he is a very

unusual 6th-level barbarian, he has roughly 13,000 gold

pieces worth of coin and equipment, and thus cannot afford

this method.

Whatever ritual he chooses, the result is that he becomes a

Medium-size creature. He loses his size penalty to Armor

Class and attack rolls. He loses his +5 natural armor bonus. He

loses his natural reach. He loses his monster Hit Dice. He

gains average elf Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.

That increases his initiative modifier, but does not entirely

make up for other losses. He swaps darkvision for low-light

vision. He gains immunity to magic sleep spells and effects, a

racial bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or

effects, and a +2 bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks. If

he merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door, he

is entitled to a Search check as though actively looking for it.

Becoming an elf makes it necessary for him to find a

lower-level party with which to adventure, but the ogre is

really tired of the prejudices against him. He chooses to

spend the XP and undergo the ritual of vitality.

Appendix 1: Sample

Monster Classes

On the pages that follow are monster classes designed to

be compatible with the corresponding monsters in the

Monster Manual. They were built with the same method-

ology used for the minotaur class described in Chapter 3

of this book. Each class has a number of levels equal to

the monsters starting ECL. As a monster attains new

levels in its class, it becomes gradually more powerful

(just as a member of any other class does) until it attains

the maximum level in its class and thereby gains all the

abilities of the creature as described in the Monster

Manual.

A monster character may not multiclass until it com-

pletes the full progression in its monster class. This rule

keeps characters from gaining the benefits of a monsters

type and then quickly switching to a standard class.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +4  Dex,  4  Int.  Air

elementals are as fast as the wind but do not have much

in  terms  of  brains.  Their  Dexterity  and  Constitution

scores increase as they gain levels.

Small:  As  Small  creatures,  air  elementals  gain  a  +1  size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and

a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller

weapons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting

and  carrying  limits  are  three-quarters  of  those  of

Medium-size characters.

Speed: Air elementals fly at a speed of 100 feet (perfect).

Darkvision: Air elementals can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Auran.

Elemental:  Air  elementals  are  immune  to  poison,  sleep,

paralysis, and stunning,; they are not subject to critical hits.

Favored  Class:  Air  elemental.  The  best  multiclassing

choices for an air elemental are barbarian, rogue, fighter,

and ranger.

AIR ELEMENTAL, LARGE

Class Skills

Elemental (Air)

Fast and gifted with flight from the moment of their cre-

ation, air elementals are supreme in the air. They have a

natural weapon, special abilities that complement their

ability to fly, and favorable ability modifiers. They make

excellent scouts and melee combatants but are less effec-

tive at just about anything else. Air elementals are recog-

nizably alien and have a hard time fitting in with creatures

native to the Material Plane.

The greatest advantage of an air elemental is its ability

to fly with great speed and precision. Even a typical speci-

men can easily carry a gnome or halfling (making it a

mobile aerial attack platform), and a high Dexterity score

makes up for poor natural armor and difficulty in wearing

crafted armor. This monster class follows the progression

for the various elemental sizes, starting at Small, passing

through Medium-size, and finally reaching Large at the

apex of the class. Over the course of the classs levels, the

elementals ability scores and slam damage increase. Its

high Constitution modifier helps compensate for its

reduced Hit Dice compared to its ECL.

The air elementals class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and

Spot (Wis).

On reaching Medium-size, an air elemental loses its +4

size bonus on Hide checks.

On reaching Large size, an air elemental takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the air elemental air

elemental class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Air elementals are

not proficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty

on attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.

Feats: An air elemental receives one feat at 1st level. It

gains Flyby Attack and Improved Initiative as bonus feats at

1st level and Weapon Finesse (slam) as a bonus feat at 2nd

level. It gains additional feats at 3rd level and 9th level.

After 14th level, it gains feats normally according to its

character level as shown on Table 25: Experience and

Level-Dependent Benefits.

ANNIS HAG

Monstrous Humanoid

These strange creatures enjoy killing and sowing confu-

sion. They are gifted with great physical strength and key

magical powers to further these desires. Annis hags are

capable of blending into normal society with careful use

of clothing (and later their natural ability to change self ),

making them good spies and easy to incorporate into a

normal adventuring party. The annis hag is a good charac-

ter choice for a player that wants to play a monstrous

witch, later gaining levels in cleric or sorcerer but still

having a foundation of powerful melee attacks to fall back

upon.

Most of an annis hags abilities are physical, so building

this monster class is a matter of distributing the attack

forms, natural armor bonuses, and ability score increases in

a balanced manner across the classs twelve levels. Spell

resistance becomes active at mid levels, making the annis a

good character to take on an enemy spellcaster in melee.

The improved grab, rend, and tear abilities are placed on the

high end of the class because they are particularly danger-

ous and give a player of an annis character something to

look forward to at the end of the class progression.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str. Annis hags are

very strong, and they get stronger over time.

Speed: Annis hag land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Annis hags can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common, Giant.

Favored Class: Annis hag.

Class Skills

The annis hags class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex),

Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, an annis hag takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the annis hag mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Annis hags are profi-

cient with all simple weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Spell-Like Abilities: The annis hags change self and fog

cloud abilities have a caster level equal to the characters Hit

Dice from class levels.

Feats: An annis hag receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 12th level, it gains

feats normally according to its character level as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Steely Skin (Ex): The annis hag has a steely, blue-black

skin that reduces damage dealt by slashing and piercing

weapons by 1 point of damage per hit. However, it has brit-

tle bones that increase the damage dealt by bludgeoning

weapons by 1 point of damage per hit. (Treat combination

weapons such as morningstars as bludgeoning weapons.)

Claws: An annis has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Bite: Starting at 2nd level, an annis has a bite attack that

is a natural weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2

Strength bonus.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Beginning at 5th level, an annis

hag has spell resistance equal to 7 + class level.

Improved Grab (Ex): Starting at 10th level, if an annis

hits a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack, it

deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

gets a hold, it can rend if it has that ability (see below).

Alternatively, it has the option to conduct the grapple nor-

mally, or simply use its claw to hold the opponent (20

penalty on grapple check, but the feral creature is not con-

sidered grappled).

Rend (Ex): Beginning at 11th level, an annis hag that

hits with both claw attacks latches onto the opponents

body and automatically tears the flesh, dealing additional

damage equal to two claw attacks.

Tear (Ex): When it attains 12th level, an annis automati-

cally hits a held opponent with all its melee attacks each

round it maintains the hold.

ARANEA

Class Skills

Magical Beast (Shapechanger)

Araneas are intelligent shapechanging spiderfolk, less

exploitative than doppelgangers and usually not evil

despite most preconceptions about spiders. They have

many skills, can assume the form of a humanoid, cast webs

and spells, and even have a poisonous bite. Araneas make

moderate melee combatants or rogues, but their natural

shapechanging and spellcasting ability make them excel-

lent spies and sorcerers, and they are reasonably good

divine spellcasters. A beginning aranea character can

assume its hybrid form for a limited time each day, making

it possible to pass among humanoids for short periods.

Araneas have several good ability score modifiers and no

penalties. An aranea can cast spells, and it has a natural bite

attack, poison, a fast land speed, and the ability to throw a

sticky web. It has a generous number of skill points, and it

starts play with three feats plus bonuses to Dexterity and

Charisma. Initially the aranea can use its natural form (a

Medium-size spider) and can assume its hybrid form as well,

and it eventually perfects its alternate form to create a perfect

likeness of one humanoid that it can retain indefinitely. The

monsters poison starts out weak (good enough to allow an

aranea to catch small prey) but later becomes strong enough

to debilitate an average human. An araneas spellcasting abil-

ity appears at 2nd level and increases to a moderate level over

time. The web spinnerets mature at 5th level and reach their

full potential at 7th level. Over time, an araneas Dexterity,

Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma increase.

The main disadvantage to playing an aranea is its low Hit

Dice compared to its ECLa fully grown aranea has 4 HD

fewer than a normal character of its ECL.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Cha.

Araneas are light-fingered and have a talent for sorcery.

Over  time,  many  of  their  ability  scores  continue  to

improve.

Speed: Aranea land speed is 30 feet, with a climb speed of

25  feet.  Like  any  creature  with  a  climb  speed,  araneas

have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always

take 10 when making Climb checks.

Darkvision: Araneas can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common and Sylvan.

Favored Class: Aranea. Bard, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard

are the best multiclassing choices for an aranea.

The araneas class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (weaving) (Int),

Escape Artist (Dex), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Profession

(Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the aranea monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Araneas are profi-

cient with all simple weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: An aranea receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 5th level. After 7th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Bite: The aranea has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times Strength

bonus.

Poison (Ex): The araneas bite injects a poison that deals

the indicated primary and secondary damage (DC 10 + 1/2

araneas Hit Dice from class levels + araneas Con modifier).

Spells: Starting at 2nd level, an aranea casts spells as a

1st-level sorcerer. At 4th level, it casts them as a 2nd-level

sorcerer, and at 6th level it casts spells as a 3rd-level sor-

cerer. Araneas prefer illusions and charms, and they avoid

fire spells.

Alternate Form (Su): At 1st level, an aranea has a natural

form resembling a large spider, but it has the ability to

assume  a  hybrid  form  for  a  limited  time,  similar  to  a

humanoid with spider traits. In hybrid form, it can use its

web and poison attacks. As it gains levels, it gains the ability

to change form more often and eventually can assume a truly

humanoid form. At 5th level, the aranea must choose one

Small or Medium-size humanoid form with which to use

this ability. An araneas humanoid form has all the abilities of

the form (for example, an aranea in dwarf form has dwarven

racial traits). The aranea keeps its ability scores and can cast

spells, but it cannot use webs or poison in humanoid form.

Web (Ex): Beginning at 5th level, araneas are able to spin

sticky webs suitable for combat. These work like nets (see

Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook) and have the abilities

mentioned in the Monster Manual aranea description. Spin-

ning and throwing a web is a standard action. At first, the

aranea can use this ability only three times per day, but at

7th level it can use a web six times per day.

ASTRAL DEVA (CELESTIAL)

Outsider (Good)

What player is not tempted, at some point or another, to

bear the banner of heaven? The astral deva may be the clos-

est example, in bearing, appearance, and function, to the

classic Western depiction of an angel. Astral devas are beau-

tiful figures of grace and majesty, human-looking with

feathery white wings. They soar over the mortal realms and

the Outer Planes, helping lost travelers and rescuing those

in danger. Not only is a deva good, its also powerful: It com-

bines significant combat abilities with the power to throw

around heal and blade barrier, along with incredible defenses

and immunities.

The astral deva stands out as the most difficult monster

class to design of all those presented here. It has the highest

possible starting ECL in the standard D&D rules (12 HD + 8

level adjustment = starting ECL 20). It has a suite of spell-

like abilities, numerous celestial qualities, and a full set of

superior ability scores. These are added approximately when

a character of a standard class could access these abilities.

Likewise, the devas powerful defenses are not acquired until

a level where opponents have a chance of overcoming them.

day: cure light wounds, aid, continual flame, detect evil, dispel

magic, invisibility sphere (centered on self only), remove curse,

remove disease, remove fear, and see invisibility. At 6th level it

can use them three times per day. At 10th level it can use

cure light wounds and see invisibility seven times per day and

the others at will. The astral devas caster level is equal to its

Hit Dice from the astral deva class (DC 10 + spell level +

astral devas Cha modifier).

Immunities (Ex): At 3rd level and beyond, an astral

deva is immune to electricity and petrification. At 17th

level, the deva also becomes immune to acid and cold.

Tongues (Su): Beginning at 4th level, an astral deva can

speak with any creature that has a language. The devas

caster level for this effect is its Hit Dice from astral deva

class levels + 2. This ability is always active unless the deva

chooses to disable it as a free action. The effect can be dis-

pelled, but the deva can create it again on its next turn as a

free action.

Protective Aura (Su): At 5th level, an astral deva gains

the first of two components of its protective aura. As a free

action, it can surround itself with a nimbus of light having

a radius of 20 feet. This light acts as a magic circle against evil

(but providing +4 bonuses instead of +2 bonuses). At 7th

level, the protective aura also functions as a minor globe of

invulnerability. The astral devas caster level for these effects

is its Hit Dice from astral deva class levels. The aura can be

dispelled, but the deva can create it again on its next turn as

a free action.

Spell Resistance (Ex): At 8th level, an astral deva gains

spell resistance equal to 10 + class level.

Stun (Su): Beginning at 12th level, if an astral deva

strikes an opponent twice in 1 round with a melee weapon,

that creature must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + astral

devas Cha modifier) or be stunned for 1d6 rounds.

Deva Powers (Sp): Starting at 10th level, an astral deva

can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: dis-

cern lies, dispel evil, holy smite, and polymorph self. At 12th level

it can use them three times per day, and at 16th level it can

use them at will. The astral devas caster level is equal to its

Hit Dice from the astral deva class (DC 10 + spell level +

Cha modifier).

Greater Deva Powers (Sp): Beginning at 15th level, an

astral deva can use the following spell-like abilities once per

day: blade barrier, heal, holy aura, and holy word. At 18th level

it can use holy aura and holy word three times per day, and at

20th level it can use holy aura and holy word at will.

Large Size: Upon attaining 19th level, an astral deva

grows to Large size and its natural reach extends to 10 feet.

It incurs all the normal penalties for Large creatures.

ATHACH

Aberration

An athach is a strange, giantlike creature capable of dealing

terrible damage in combat and absorbing a lot of punish-

ment. In addition to its pure physical power, its poisonous

bite means that foes caught in a long-term battle with an

athach are likely to become less and less able to deal with

the  creatures  defenses.  Their  poor  Intelligence  and

Charisma and Huge size make athachs ill suited for any

career but that of barbarian or fighter, but they do well at

either of those.

An athachs advantages compared to a human are its

incredible size, extra arm, natural armor, great Strength

and Constitution, poisonous bite, reach, and ability to

throw rocks like a giant. A beginning athach character is

bigger than most humans but still Medium-size, growing

to its full height over the course of the next eighteen levels.

While its Strength starts out no greater than a humans, it

increases quickly over the course of the classs progression,

and its extra attacks make up for any initial lack in crush-

ing power. Eventually the athach is strong enough to hurl

small boulders. As it grows, an athachs bite becomes more

potent and gains the ability to inject poison (which also

becomes more powerful over time). With size increases

come increasing reach, until the athach has an impressive

15-foot reach when it attains Huge size at 19th level. The

athachs speed, natural armor, and Constitution increase

progressively as well.

Racial Traits

AVORAL (CELESTIAL)

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  4  Int,  +2  Wis,  4

Cha. Athachs are stupid and shy, but cunning, and even-

tually develop great Strength and Constitution.

Speed: Athach land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Athachs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Giant.

Favored Class: Athach. The best multiclassing choices for

an athach are barbarian and fighter.

Class Skills

The athachs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Profes-

sion (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, an athach takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

On reaching Huge size, an athach takes a 8 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the athach monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Athachs are profi-

cient with all simple weapons and with light armor.

Feats: An athach receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 15th level. At 9th level it

gains Multiattack as a bonus feat. After 19th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Three Arms: An athach has three arms, and it can use all

three of them in combat for wielding weapons. One arm is

the primary arm, which may have iterative attacks (multi-

ple attacks with the same weapon at a cumulative 5

penalty) if the athachs base attack bonus is high enough,

and the others are secondary arms, which never get itera-

tive attacks.

The primary arm uses the athachs base attack bonus.

Attacks with the secondary arms are at the normal penalties

for fighting with two weapons (see Table 82 in the Players

Handbook). The Multiweapon Fighting feat lessens these

penalties by 2 for all three arms. The Multidexterity feat

negates all penalties for using an off hand (making the

attack bonus for the secondary arms equal to the attack

bonus of the primary arm).

The athachs arms are not natural weapons. Attacks with

the  primary  arm  add  the  athachs  Strength  bonus  to

damage, while attacks with the secondary arms add 1/2 the

Strength bonus.

Bite: The athach has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage. If a bite attack is made in

conjunction with other attacks, it uses the athachs base

attack bonus with a penalty of 5. The Multiattack feat

lessens the penalty to 2.

Poison (Ex): The athachs bite injects a poison that deals

the indicated primary and secondary damage (DC 10 + 1/2

athachs HD from class levels + athachs Con modifier).

Rock Throwing (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, an athach

can throw a rock for the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus. A rocks maximum range is five range increments.

Outsider (Good)

Born of the heavenly planes, these birdlike celestials serve

as warriors, spies, and scouts for the forces of good. Like all

celestials, they are built to survive the attacks of evil and are

gifted with many magical abilities to let them carry out

their tasks.

A young avoral begins play with several weak resistances,

natural armor, and exceptionally keen vision. Over time its

wings become capable of carrying it at great speeds and

dealing powerful blows, its ability scores and resistances

increase, it can lay on hands, and it develops magic to

improve its sight and ability to communicate. Eventually it

becomes terrible to behold in battle, immune to many

attacks, and skilled at neutralizing enemies and enemy

magic at a distance.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Wis,  +2

Cha. Avorals are celestial birdfolkfast, wise, and confi-

dent.

Speed: Avoral land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Avorals can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Avorals can see twice as far as a human

in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar  condi-

tions  of  poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skills: +8 racial bonus on Spot checks.

Saves: +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic.

Favored Class: Avoral. Any character class is a good multi-

classing choice for an avoral.

Class Skills

The avorals class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Knowl-

edge (any two, chosen at 1st level) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spell-

craft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the avoral monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Avorals are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: An avoral receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd and 10th level. After 14th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Wings: Starting at 2nd level, an avoral has two wing

attacks that are natural weapons dealing the indicated

damage plus Strength bonus.

Claws: Beginning at 3rd level, an avoral has two claw

attacks that are natural weapons dealing the indicated

damage plus Strength bonus.

Lesser Avoral Powers (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, an

avoral can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

aid, blur (self only), command, detect magic, light, magic missile,

and see invisibility. At 6th level it can use these abilities three

times per day, and at 9th level it can use them at will. The

avorals caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from the avoral

class (DC 10 + spell level + avorals Cha modifier).

True Seeing (Su): Starting at 3rd level, an avoral can

focus its sight, requiring 1 round of concentration but

allowing it to see as if it were under the effect of a true seeing

spell cast by a 14th-level cleric. At first this ability lasts only

up to 1 minute, but at 8th level the avoral can use it for up to

10 minutes per day. Each minute used or fraction thereof

counts as 1 minute of use. At 12th level, there is no limit to

the number of times per day an avoral can use this ability.

The avoral must maintain concentration to use this ability.

Lay on Hands (Su): This ability, gained at 4th level,

works like the paladin ability, except that an avoral can heal

as much damage per day as its own full normal hit point

total.

Animal Telepathy (Su): Beginning at 4th level, an avoral

can mentally communicate with animals as a free action.

This works like speak with animals but does not require

speech. The avorals caster level for this effect is its Hit Dice

from avoral class levels + 1.

Tongues (Su): Beginning at 4th level, an avoral can speak

with any creature that has a language. The avorals caster

level for this effect is its Hit Dice from avoral class levels 

2. This ability is always active unless the avoral chooses to

disable it as a free action. The effect can be dispelled, but the

avoral can create it again on its next turn as a free action.

Avoral Powers (Sp): Beginning at 5th level, an avoral

can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

dimension door, dispel magic, gust of wind, hold person, lightning

bolt, and magic circle against evil (self only). At 9th level it can

use any of these except dimension door three times per day,

and at 14th level it can use any of them except dimension

door at will.

Fear Aura (Su): Starting at 7th level, an avoral can create

an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius once per day. It is other-

wise identical with fear as cast by an 8th-level sorcerer (save

DC 14 + Cha modifier).

AZER

Outsider (Fire, Lawful)

As dwarves native to the Elemental Plane of Fire, azers have

many of the appealing traits of the dwarf race as well as a

touch of the exotic for players who like to run unusual char-

acters. Strong, smart, intuitive, quick, immune to fire, and

with a respectable amount of natural armor, azers excel at

any class except those that rely on Charisma.

A young azer begins play immune to fire but vulnerable

to cold, with three good saving throws and some natural

armor to boot, making it a reasonable counterpart to a

fighter despite having a d8 Hit Die instead of a d10. In just

a few short levels an azers increased natural armor, other

ability score bonuses, natural heat, and spell resistance kick

in, giving it an impressive list of qualities. The only draw-

back is the azers 2 Hit Dice compared to the final ECL of 6.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Con,  2  Cha.

Azers are much like their dwarven kin.

Speed: Azer land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Azers can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common and Ignan.

Favored Class: Azer. The best multiclassing choices for an

azer are fighter and cleric.

Class Skills

The azers class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis),

Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

All of the following are class features of the azer monster

class.

BARGHEST

Class Features

Outsider (Evil, Lawful) (Shapechanger)

Evil goblinlike outsiders, barghests are strong combatants

with good ability score modifiers and an attractive list of

special abilities. Because it can take the form of a goblin or a

wolf, a barghest within an all-humanoid party can be mis-

taken as a slave or pet of another character in the party.

Barghests are fiendish killing machines and are welcome in

most parties for their melee abilityas long as nobody

minds their origin or personality.

A barghest starts with a strong attack ability, a bite attack,

natural armor, and the ability to temporarily boost its own

health by consuming the bodies of humanoid victims. Over

the next few levels its ability scores increase, it develops

claw attacks, the scent ability, the ability to change form,

and some handy spell-like abilities. Eventually it gains

more powerful spell-like abilities and even damage reduc-

tion. These and the ability to feed make up for its low Hit

Dice compared to its final ECL.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Con.

Barghests literally are wolves from Hell.

Speed: Barghest land speed is 30 feet.

All of the following are class features of the barghest class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Barghests are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons but not with

armor or shields.

Feats: A barghest receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 12th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Feed (Su): When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent,

it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life

force, as a full-round action. Barghests that are not player

characters would gain Hit Dice for feeding in this manner,

but since PC barghests gain HD as part of gaining class

levels, they instead gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Con-

stitution (no matter how many HD the consumed creature

had), which lasts for 1 day. Feeding destroys the victims

body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that

requires part of the corpse. A wish, miracle, or true resurrection

spell can restore a devoured victim to life, but there is a 50%

chance that even such powerful magic will fail.

Alternate  Form  (Su): At  2nd  level  a  barghest  can

assume the form of a goblin or an unusually large wolf as a

standard action. This is similar to using the polymorph self

barghests speed is 60 feet, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus

on Hide checks, and it can pass without trace (as the spell)

as a free action.

Lesser Barghest Powers (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a

barghest can use the following spell-like abilities once per

day: levitate, misdirection, and project image. At 6th level it can

use these abilities three times per day, and at 11th level it can

use them at will. The barghests caster level is equal to its Hit

Dice from the barghest class. The DC for saves against these

abilities is 10 + spell level + barghests Cha modifier.

Greater Barghest Powers (Sp): Starting at 7th level, a

barghest can use the following spell-like abilities once per

day: charm monster, charm person, dimension door, and emotion.

The barghests caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from the

barghest class. The DC for saves against these abilities is 10

BELKER

Elemental (Air)

Evil, smoky air elementals, belkers are reclusive monsters

that have strange powers to allow them to defend their lairs.

The ability to fly, a high Dexterity score, and elemental

immunities are the main attractions of playing this monster

as a character, and its abilities make it well-suited for

combat or stealth.

A belker begins play with some natural armor and the

ability to make wing attacks. As it gains levels, it develops

even more attacks, the ability to fly at great speed, and

increases its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. Eventu-

ally it gets increased size and reach, the ability to move about

in the form of smoke, and its strange smoke claws attack.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  4  Int.

Belkers  are  quick,  but  no  more  intelligent  than  other

common air elementals.

Speed: Belker land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Belkers can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Auran.

Elemental: Belkers are immune to poison, sleep, paraly-

sis, and stunning, and they are not subject to critical hits.

Favored Class: Belker. The best multiclassing choices for

a belker are fighter and rogue.

Class Skills

The belkers class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profes-

sion (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a belker takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the belker monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Belkers are not profi-

cient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A belker receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd and 9th level. It gains Weapon Finesse

(wing) as a bonus feat at 5th level. After 12th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Wings: The belker has two wing attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Bite: Starting at 2nd level, the belker has a bite attack

that is a natural weapon dealing the indicated damage plus

1/2 Strength bonus.

Claws: Upon reaching 4th level, the belker has two claw

attacks that are natural weapons dealing the indicated

damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Smoke Form (Su): Most of the time a belker is more or

less solid, but starting at 3rd level it can assume a smoke

form for up to 5 rounds per day. It can switch forms once

per round as a free action. A belker in smoke form can fly at

its indicated fly speed. The ability is otherwise similar to a

gaseous form spell cast by a 7th-level sorcerer. At 6th, 9th, and

12th level, the belker can assume smoke form for an addi-

tional 5 rounds per day.

Smoke Claws (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, a belker in

smoke form can engulf opponents by moving on top of

them. It fills the air around one opponent (which must be at

least one size category smaller than it) without provoking

an attack of opportunity. The target must succeed on a For-

titude save (DC 10 + 1/2 belkers HD from class levels +

belkers Con modifier) or inhale part of the creature. Smoke

inside the victim solidifies into a claw or talon and begins to

rip at the surrounding organs, dealing triple claw damage

per round (Strength modifier +0). The affected creature can

attempt another Fortitude save each subsequent round to

cough out the semivaporous menace.

CENTAUR

Monstrous Humanoid

Proud and noble beings with the strength and speed of

horses and a fondness for archery, centaurs are guardians

of the forest. Centaur tribes trade with many elven com-

munities, and each agrees to protect the other in times of

need. It is under agreements such as these that centaurs

may be found traveling with bands of elves, lending their

muscles and hooves to defend against evil creatures and

despoilers.

The centaur is a strong class suitable for any player who

enjoys nature-oriented characters. It has few special abili-

ties and reasonable ability score modifiers, making a cen-

taur character more than capable of holding its own in a

fight compared to barbarians, fighters, and rangers. Over

the levels of this class, a centaurs Strength and Constitu-

tion increase to an impressive level, it becomes faster and

larger, and it deals more damage with its great hooves.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  2  Int.

Centaurs are quick and agile, but not as mentally adept as

humans.

Speed: Centaur land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Centaurs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Elven, Sylvan.

Favored  Class:  Centaur  and  ranger.  A  centaurs  centaur

class level and ranger class level do not count when deter-

mining whether it takes an XP penalty for multiclassing.

Class Skills

The centaurs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently

(Dex), Profession (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a centaur takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the centaur mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Centaurs are proficient

with all simple weapons, the heavy lance, and the mighty com-

posite longbow, but with no armor or shields. Centaurs count

as nonhumanoid creatures for the purpose of determining the

cost of armor (see Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook).

Feats: A centaur receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 4th level. After 6th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Hooves: A centaur has two hoof attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength

bonus.

DJINNI (GENIE)

Outsider (Air, Good)

In many campaigns that include an exotic desert land of

flying carpets and scimitar-wielding thugs, the most exotic of

all the lands features are often the magical djinn, outsiders

from the Elemental Plane of Air and naturally inclined

toward good. In some places they walk the land freely, not

tied to a summoning device such as a lamp or ring, and

pursue adventure just as a mortal would. Djinn are good char-

acters for players who like to be effective in combat and still

want to have a few magical tricks up their sleeve.

As an outsider, a djinni has a favorable base attack bonus

and good saving throws in all three categories. The scaling of

the class revolves around its special powers, particularly the

whirlwind, invisibility, and plane shift abilities. Adjusting abil-

ity score progression, slam damage, and acid resistance are

simple enough, and the djinni has enough interesting abili-

ties and ability score increases to give the class something

intriguing at every level, particularly at the middle and higher

levels of the class, where the Hit Dice fall behind the ECL.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Dex, +2 Int. Djinn

are quick and smart.

Speed:  Djinni  land  speed  is  20  feet,  fly  speed  30  feet

(perfect).

Darkvision: Djinn can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Auran,  Celestial,  Common,  and

Ignan.

Favored Class: Djinni. The best multiclassing choices for

a djinni are fighter, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard.

Class Skills

The djinnis class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape

Artist (Dex), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spell-

craft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a djinni takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the djinni monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Djinn are proficient with

all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or shields.

Feats: A djinni receives one feat at 1st level and additional

ones at 5th and 11th level. It receives Dodge as a bonus feat at

3rd level and Improved Initiative as a bonus feat at 4th level.

After 13th level it gains feats normally according to its char-

acter level, as shown on Table 25: Experience and Level-

Dependent Benefits.

Telepathy: A djinni can communicate telepathically with

any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Slam: A djinni has a slam attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times its Strength

bonus.  Djinn  get  iterative

attacks  (multiple  attacks

with the same weapon at a

cumulative  5  penalty)

with a slam.

Whirlwind (Su): Beginning at 4th level, a djinni can

assume a whirlwind form. The ability is usable once per day

at 4th level and three times per day at 8th level. A djinni of

12th level or higher can assume whirlwind form at will. See

the djinnis Monster Manual entry for detailed rules about

this ability.

Plane Shift (Sp): Starting at 5th level, a djinni can use plane

shift. See the table for how the ability improves as the djinni

gains levels.

Spell-Like Abilities: A djinni gains some spell-like abil-

ities at 6th level and others at 9th level. Each of these abili-

ties is usable once per day. A djinnis caster level is equal to

its Hit Dice from class levels + 13.

A djinnis gaseous form ability

lasts for up to 1 hour.

DRIDER

Aberration

Created by the spider goddess Lolth from her drow wor-

shipers who fail a special test of loyalty and power, driders

are outcasts from their society and often wander the Under-

dark looking for allies or like-minded individuals. Drider

may be an appealing choice for players who like dark elves

and like playing weird monsters. Driders are good in

combat, good at spellcasting, and pretty good at sneaking

around, making them well-rounded creatures suitable for

most any role in an adventuring party.

The difficulty in balancing the class is that a drider casts

spells as a character of its Hit Dice, which means that at

most levels a drider gains an automatic benefit of an

increase in spellcasting, so its other strong abilities must be

placed on levels where it doesnt gain a Hit Die. The drider

progression increases ability scores, spellcasting, poison

damage, and natural armor bonus.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Int,  +2

Cha. The selection process that makes drow so powerful

means that driders are powerful as well.

Speed: Drider land speed is 30 feet, climb speed 15 feet.

Like any creature with a climb speed, driders have a +8

racial  bonus  on  Climb  checks  and  can  always  take  10

when making Climb checks.

Darkvision: Driders can see in the dark up to 120 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Common,  Elven,  and  Under-

common.

Favored Class: Drider.

Class Skills

The driders class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide

(Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis),

Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a drider takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the drider monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Since every drider is

created from a cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, a drider has the

same weapon and armor proficiencies as the spellcaster of

the appropriate type. For example, a drider that was once a

cleric is proficient with all simple weapons, with all armor,

and with shields.

Feats: A drider receives two feats at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 10th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Bite: Starting at 2nd level, a drider has a bite attack that is

a natural weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2

Strength bonus.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Starting at 6th level, a drider

gains spell resistance equal to 4 + class level.

Poison (Ex): The driders bite injects a poison that deals

the indicated primary and secondary damage (DC 10 + 1/2

driders HD from class levels + driders Con modifier).

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayclairaudience/clairvoyance,

dancing lights, darkness, detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect

law, detect magic, discern lies, dispel magic, faerie fire, levitate, and

suggestion. A driders caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from

class levels. The DC for saving throws against these abilities

is 10 + driders Cha modifier + spell level.

Spells: All driders have the ability to cast spells either as

a cleric, sorcerer, or wizard (chosen at 1st level). The drider

casts spells as a character of its Hit Dice. Most drider clerics

still worship Lolth and choose two domains from her list

(Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Trickery).

EARTH ELEMENTAL, LARGE

Elemental (Earth)

Formed of the essence of stone, earth elementals are strong,

patient, and enduring. Their rocky fists can beat enemies to

a pulp, and they have an innate understanding of how best

to crush a landbound opponent. Earth elementals are natu-

ral fighters or even barbarians, but they are too slow and

dumb to be much good at anything else. The earth elemen-

tal class begins with a Small elemental that eventually pro-

gresses to Large size.

An earth elemental has only three special abilities, two of

which are low-powered enough to grant at low level. The

third special ability, damage reduction, is shifted to the

icant ability and is something that the Medium-size elemen-

tal does not have. The rest of the class features are predomi-

nantly ability score increases, natural armor improvements,

and increases to the elementals slam damage.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +4 Str, 2 Dex, 4 Int.

Earth  elementals  are  immensely  strong,  but  ponderous

in action and thought.

Small: As Small creatures, earth elementals gain a +1 size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and

a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smal-

ler  weapons  than  Medium-size  creatures  do,  and  their

lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of

Medium-size characters.

Speed: Earth elemental land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Earth elementals can see in the dark up to 60

feet.

Elemental:  Earth  elementals  are  immune  to  poison,

sleep, paralysis, and stunning, and they are not subject to

critical hits.

Automatic Languages: Terran.

Favored  Class:  Earth  elemental.  The  best  multiclassing

choices for an earth elemental are barbarian and fighter.

Class Skills

The earth elementals class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis),

and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Medium-size, an earth elemental loses its +4

size bonus on Hide checks.

on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: The earth elemental has a slam attack that is a nat-

ural weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times

its Strength bonus.

Earth Mastery: An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus

on attacks and damage if both it and its foe touch the

ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the

earth elemental takes a 4 penalty on attack and damage

rolls.

Push: An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneuver

without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat

modifiers from the earth mastery ability also apply to its

opposed Strength checks.

EFREETI (GENIE)

Outsider (Evil, Fire)

Like their cousins the djinn, efreet have all of the mys-

tique of the lands of swirling sands and flying carpets, plus

a treasure chest of magical powers and physical ability.

Efreet make excellent fighters, rogues, sorcerers, and wiz-

ards. Efreet are appealing character choices to players who

like to be devastating in melee combat and still have a few

magical abilities for use in situations where sheer brawn is

insufficient.

Efreet are strong and powerful with several spell-like

abilities. Building the monster class involves spacing out

the availability and use of the spell-like abilities and distrib-

uting the ability score increases across all the classs levels.

By far the classs most powerful ability is wish, which does

not become available until an efreeti reaches 18th level and

initially at a smaller number of uses per day than a wizard of

the same level.

On reaching Large size, an earth elemental takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape

Artist (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Move Silently

(Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft

(Int), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, an efreeti takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the efreeti monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Efreet are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: An efreeti receives one feat at 1st level and additional

ones at 5th, 11th, and 17th level. It also receives Improved Ini-

tiative as a bonus feat at 14th level. After 19th level it gains feats

normally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: An efreeti has a slam attack that is a natural

weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times its

Strength bonus. Efreet get iterative attacks (multiple

attacks with the same weapon at a cumulative 5 penalty)

with a slam.

Dice from class levels + 8. An efreetis gaseous form ability

lasts for up to 1 hour.

Plane Shift (Sp): Starting at 5th level, an efreeti can use

plane shift. The table indicates how the ability improves as

the efreeti gains levels.

ETTERCAP

Aberration

Weird, spiderlike creatures, ettercaps are cunning but not

particularly strong or intelligent. They are good at sneaking

about, and if dressed in a heavy cloak, one can pass for a fat,

squat human. They have few interests other than eating and

breeding, but it is possible to find a wandering ettercap in

search of a mate or a particularly large meal. Ettercaps are

fun characters for players who like things a little weird and

like arachnid monsters.

The bulk of an ettercaps power comes from its debilitat-

ing poison, which is handy for those wanting to capture pris-

oners for interrogation. Its ability to make webs is useful

when an area can be prepared in anticipation of an attack,

and it has a strong bite attack and good Hit Dice. Although

not the best fighters, ettercaps make good second-rank allies

that fill the role of a rogue, using poison instead of a sneak

attack and carrying a natural supply of rope and nets.

Telepathy: An efreeti can communicate telepathically

Racial Traits

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Heat (Ex): The efreetis red-hot body deals the indicated

amount of fire damage in addition to normal damage when

it hits in melee with a slam, or when grappling, and each

round it maintains a hold.

Spell-Like Abilities: An efreeti gains spell-like abilities

at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, and 18th level. Each of these

abilities is usable either once per day or at will, as indicated.

At 19th level, an efreeti can use wish three times per day

instead of once. An efreetis caster level is equal to its Hit

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +4  Dex,  4  Int,  2

Cha. Like the vermin they resemble and live with, etter-

caps are quick but not too smart or personable.

Speed: Ettercap land speed is 30 feet, with a climb speed

of 30 feet. Like any creature with a climb speed, ettercap

have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks, and can always

take 10 when making Climb checks.

Darkvision: Ettercaps can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Low-Light  Vision:  Ettercaps  can  see  twice  as  far  as  a

human  in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skills: +4 racial bonus on Hide checks and Spot checks in

shadow.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored Class: Ettercap. The best multiclassing choice for

an  ettercap  is  rogue,  and  ettercaps  also  make  good

monks.

Class Skills

The ettercaps class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Pro-

fession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ettercap mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ettercaps are not pro-

ficient with any weapons, armor,  or shields.

Feats: An ettercap receives one feat at 1st level and

another one at 5th level. After 9th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Bite: An ettercap has a bite attack that

is a natural weapon dealing the indi-

cated damage plus Strength bonus.

Poison (Ex): The ettercaps bite injects a poison that deals

the indicated primary and secondary damage (DC 10 + 1/2

ettercaps HD from class levels + ettercaps Con modifier).

Claws: Starting at 2nd level, an ettercap has two claw

attacks that are natural weapons dealing the indicated

damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Web (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, ettercaps are able to

spin sticky webs suitable for combat. These work like nets

(see Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook) and have the abili-

ties given in the Monster Manual ettercap description. Spin-

ning and throwing the web is a standard action. At first the

ettercap can use this ability only one time per day; at 5th,

7th, and 9th level this increases to two, four, and eight times

per day.

FIRE ELEMENTAL, LARGE

Elemental (Fire)

These beings of sentient, animate fire are capable of incred-

ible destruction, able to burn an entire village with a mini-

mum of effort. The fascination of fire and the strangeness of

being an elemental creature are two strong attractions of

this monster class, and a fire elemental player character can

make a powerful fighter or even a respectable sorcerer,

particularly if the character

focuses on ground-zero

fire magic. When part of a

group that does not mind some reckless action and collat-

eral  damage,  a  fire  elemental  can  be  a  valuable  party

member. The fire elemental class begins with a Small ele-

mental that eventually progresses to Large size.

Creating the fire elemental monster class is centered on

the  creatures  attack  ability.  While  its  slam  does  a

respectable amount of damage, it is the additional fire

damage and potential for igniting the target that really

make the elementals attacks dangerous. The fire elemental

also has favorable ability score modifiers that must accrue

over several levels, and at the highest levels in the class it

gains enough damage reduction to negate most attacks

from weak creatures.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +4 Dex, 4 Int. Fire

elementals are remarkably nimble but can be as mindless

as normal fires.

Small: As Small creatures, fire elementals gain a +1 size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and

a  +4  size  bonus  on  Hide  checks,  but  they  must  use

smaller  weapons  than  Medium-size  creatures  do,  and

their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are  three-quarters  of

those of Medium-size characters.

Speed: Fire elemental land speed is 50 feet.

Darkvision:  Fire  elementals  can  see  in  the  dark  up  to

60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Ignan.

Elemental:  Fire  elementals  are  immune  to  poison,  sleep,

paralysis, and stunning, and they are not subject to criti-

cal hits.

Favored  Class:  Fire  elemental.  The  best  multiclassing

choices  for  a  fire  elemental  are  fighter,  barbarian,  and

rogue.

Class Skills

The fire elementals class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and

Spot (Wis).

On reaching Medium-size, a fire elemental loses its +4

size bonus on Hide checks.

On reaching Large size, a fire elemental takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fire elemental

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fire elementals are

not proficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A fire elemental receives one feat at 1st level and

additional ones at 3rd and 9th level. It gains Improved Ini-

tiative as a bonus feat at 1st level and Weapon Finesse (slam)

as a bonus feat at 2nd level. After 14th level it gains feats

normally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: The elemental has a slam attack that is a natural

weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times its

Strength bonus to the normal (nonfire) damage. For exam-

ple, a 1st-level fire elemental with 12 Strength deals 1d4+1

points of damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage with a slam.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A fire elemental is immune to fire

damage and takes a 10 penalty on saves against cold

attacks. If a cold attack does not allow a saving throw, the

creature takes double damage instead.

Burn (Ex): When a fire elemental reaches 2nd level, a

creature hit by its slam attack must succeed on a Reflex

saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 fire elementals HD from class

levels + fire elementals Con modifier) or catch on fire. A

burning creature can take a move-equivalent action to put

out the flames. Creatures hitting a fire elemental with natu-

ral weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though

hit by the elementals attack, and also catch fire unless they

succeed on a Reflex save.

Water Avoidance: A fire elemental cannot enter water

or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an

impassible barrier unless the elemental can step or jump

over it.

FIRE GIANT

Giant (Fire)

Of great size and physical strength, fire giants are the most

military-minded of all evil giants and the most likely to use

quality weapons and armor. Raised in a strict hierarchy of

family and clan status, fire giants are used to taking orders and

can fit in quite well with a group of adventurers once they

have established their place in the pecking order. Fire giants

can withstand ballista bolts and powerful fireballs without

flinching, and the toughest ones have been known to singly

take on dragons of their own size and live to talk about it.

Fire giants have few special abilities. Their fire immunity

takes effect early, leaving only reach and the ability to

throw rocks as ranged weapons, neither of which is particu-

larly unusual for creatures of their size and Hit Dice. The

Hit Dice and ability scores increase from level 1 to the final

ECL of 19. Fire giants are so strong and tough that they

have an ability score increase at almost every level, which

makes a fire giant attractive even though it doesnt gain the

feats or special abilities of a fighter or other martial class.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +4 Str. Fire giants are

very strong and become even stronger as they mature.

Speed: Fire giant land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Fire giants can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common, Giant.

Favored  Class:  Fire  giant. The  best  multiclassing  choice

for a fire giant is fighter.

Patron  Deity:  Surtur,  deity  of  all  fire  giants.  Most  fire

giants  that  multiclass  as  clerics  worship  Surtur,  a  fire

giant of immense size with a sword of flame, and choose

two domains from his list (Evil, Law, Trickery, and War).

Class Skills

The fire giants class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Profession (Wis),

and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a fire giant takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fire giant mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Fire giants are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, with light and

medium armor, and with shields.

Feats: A fire giant receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 8th, 12th, 15th, and 19th level.After 19th

level it gains feats normally according to its character level,

as shown on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent

Benefits.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A fire giant is immune to fire damage

and takes a 10 penalty on saves against cold attacks. If a

cold attack does not allow a saving throw, the creature takes

double damage instead.

Rock Throwing (Ex): Fire giants have a +1 racial bonus

on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A giant can throw a

rock for the indicated damage plus Strength bonus. A rocks

maximum range is five range increments.

Rock Catching (Ex): A fire giant can catch Small,

Medium-size, or Large rocks (or similar projectiles). Once

per round, a fire giant that would normally be hit by a rock

can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is

15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium-size one, and 25 for a

Large one. (If the projectile has a magical bonus to attack,

the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready

for and aware of the attack.

FLAMEBROTHER (SALAMANDER)

Outsider (Fire)

Like their larger cousins, flamebrother salamanders are

quasi-serpentine creatures from the Elemental Plane of

Fire. Gifted with a natural talent for metalworking and

quite effective in combat with their multiple attacks and

constant fire damage, flamebrothers are a good choice for

players who want a monster with a low starting ECL yet

with some exotic abilities. A flamebrother sometimes joins

an adventuring party after being brought to the Material

Plane by lesser planar ally spells and then choosing to remain

on this plane after completing its mission.

The building blocks of the flamebrother monster class

are its immunity to fire, strong natural armor, ability score

increases, constrict ability, and additional fire damage to its

attacks. Damage from heat starts out low and increases

slightly at the end of the class. The constrict ability is gained

in the middle of the class progression.

Constrict (Ex): A flamebrother deals automatic tail slap

damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple

check against creatures of up to Medium-size.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Int,  +2  Wis.

Flamebrothers are smart and alert.

Small:  As  Small  creatures,  flamebrothers  gain  a  +1  size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and

a +4 size bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smal-

ler  weapons  than  Medium-size  creatures  do,  and  their

lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of

Medium-size characters.

Weapon Familiarity: Flamebrothers treat the salamander

halfspear (see Chapter 5: Equipment) as a martial weapon

rather than as an exotic weapon.

Speed: Flamebrother land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Flamebrothers can see in the dark up to 60

feet.

Skills: +4 racial bonus on Craft (metalworking) checks.

Automatic Languages: Ignan.

Favored Class: Flamebrother.

Class Skills

The flamebrothers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Listen

(Wis), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the flamebrother

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Flamebrothers are

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but not

with armor or shields.

Feats: A flamebrother receives one feat at 1st level and

another one at 5th level. After 7th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Tail Slap: The flamebrother has a tail slap attack that is a

natural weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2

Strength bonus.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A flamebrother is immune to fire

damage and takes a 10 penalty on saves against cold

attacks. If a cold attack does not allow a saving throw, the

creature takes double damage instead.

Heat (Ex): A flamebrothers body generates so much

heat that its natural attacks and attacks with metal weapons

deal the indicated amount of fire damage in addition to the

damage dealt by the attack.

Table A18: The Flamebrother

FLESH GOLEM

Construct

Usually created as guardians by spellcasters or perhaps

some lunatic with the proper tools, flesh golems are unique

creations, each with its own story and purpose. Those rare

few that gain a spark of actual intelligence and manage to

wrest themselves free of their masters are one in a million

and are often haunted by images of their past. Flesh golems

are interesting character choices for players that wish to

explore the misunderstood formerly human monster

stereotype, as well as those that simply enjoy near-invulner-

ability and powerful melee skills.

The core of the flesh golem character class is its immuni-

ties. The construct template and its energy immunities are

with the class from the start, but are balanced by its poor

attack bonus and saving throws and the risk of instant

death if brought to 0 hit points. Over time the golems

resistance to magic builds up in the form of spell resistance,

eventually becoming complete magic immunity. The rest of

the classs abilities are based on increasing its ability scores,

natural armor, damage reduction, and slam damage, which

progress at a linear rate. Upon attaining the last few levels

of the class, the golem grows to its full size and gains an

extended reach.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: 2 Dex, 6 Int, Con

, Cha 1. Flesh golems are dead flesh given a semblance

of life through magic, but are not as fast or smart as truly

living things. As a construct, a flesh golem does not have

a Constitution score. The flesh golems Charisma score of

1 is permanent. It cannot be increased by any means.

Construct:  A  flesh  golem  is  immune  to  mind-affecting

effects, poison, disease, and similar effects. It is not sub-

ject  to  critical  hits,  subdual  damage,  ability  damage,

energy  drain,  or  death  from  massive  damage.  While

constructs do not heal damage naturally through rest, a

flesh  golem  character  can.  A  flesh  golem  is  immune  to

any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it affects

objects. When a flesh golem is reduced to 0 hit points, it

is  immediately  destroyed.  A  destroyed  golem  can  be

reanimated with a limited wish, wish, or miracle spell (the

first spell causes the golem to lose a level; the latter two

do not).

Energy Immunity: A flesh golem takes no damage from

acid,  cold,  electricity,  fire,  or  sonic  attacks.  However,

certain energy attacks can affect it (see below).

Speed: Flesh golem land speed is 30 feet. Golems cannot

run.

Darkvision: Flesh golems can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored  Class:  Flesh  golem.  The  best  multiclassing

choice for a flesh golem is fighter.

Class Skills

As a construct, the flesh golem receives no class skills or

skill points. Once a flesh golem multiclasses after 15th

level, it receives skill points normally for its other classes.

On reaching Large size, a flesh golem takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the flesh golem

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A flesh golem has no

proficiency with weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A flesh golem receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 8th, and 14th level. After 15th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: A flesh golem has two slam attacks that are natural

weapons, dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Energy Vulnerability (Ex): While flesh golems are

not damaged by any energy attack, certain energy attacks

from a magical source affect them in strange ways. Spells,

spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that create

cold or fire cause them to slow (as the spell) for 2d6

rounds. Those that create electricity heal a flesh golem 1

hit point for every 3 points of damage the electricity

would otherwise deal. For example, a flesh golem hit by a

lightning bolt for 18 points of damage would instead heal 6

hit points. Flesh golems never roll saving throws against

electricity effects.

Berserk (Ex): When a flesh golem enters combat, there

is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the spirit that

gives it a semblance of life goes berserk. The uncontrolled

golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living crea-

ture or smashing some object smaller than itself if no crea-

ture is within reach, then moving on to spread more

destruction. A golem stops berserking when it has no crea-

tures or appropriate objects within its line of sight. The

golems creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by

speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, which

requires a successful Charisma check (DC 19) and can be

attempted every round. It takes 1 minute of rest by the

golem to reset the golems berserk chance to 0%.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a flesh

golem gains spell resistance equal to its class level + 10.

Magic Immunity (Su): At 9th level, a flesh golem

becomes immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and super-

natural abilities (except fire, cold, and electricity effects, as

described in the Energy Vulnerability entry). This ability

supersedes the golems spell resistance ability.

FROST GIANT

Giant (Cold)

Like fire giants, frost giants are big, strong, and mean.

Unlike fire giants, they are reckless and wantonly destruc-

tive, more likely to fight as a loose horde than in strict mili-

tary formation. Their rebellious nature makes it likely for

individual giants to strike out on their own to escape a tribal

rival and come into contact with groups of adventurers.

Frost giants are good choices for players who like barbarian

characters or Vikings and want something a little more out

of the ordinary.

Frost giants have few special abilities. Their cold immu-

nity takes effect early, leaving only reach and the ability

to throw rocks as ranged weapons, neither of which is

particularly unusual for a creature of their size and Hit

Dice. The Hit Dice and ability scores increase from 1st

level to the final ECL of 18. Frost giants are so powerful

that they have an ability score increase at almost every

level, which makes a frost giant attractive even though it

doesnt gain the feats or special abilities of a fighter or

other martial class.

170

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +4  Str.  Frost  giants

are very strong and become even stronger as they mature.

Speed: Frost giant land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Frost giants can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common, Giant.

Favored Class: Frost giant. The best multiclassing choices

for a frost giant are fighter and barbarian.

Patron Deity: Thrym, deity of all frost giants. Most frost

giants  that  multiclass  as  clerics  worship Thrym,  a  frost

giant  of  immense  size  with  an  icy  greataxe,  and  choose

two domains from his list (Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and

War).

Class Skills

The frost giants class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Profession

(Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a frost giant takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the frost giant mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Frost giants are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, with light armor,

and with shields.

Feats: A frost giant receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 8th, 12th, and 15th level. After 18th level it

gains feats normally according to its character level, as shown

on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Rock Throwing (Ex): Frost giants have a +1 racial bonus

on attack rolls when throwing rocks. The giant can throw a

rock for the indicated damage plus Strength bonus. A rocks

maximum range is five range increments.

Rock Catching (Ex): A frost giant can catch Small,

Medium-size, or Large rocks (or similar projectiles). Once

per round, a frost giant that would normally be hit by a rock

can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is

15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium-size one, and 25 for a

Large one. (If the projectile has a magical bonus to attack,

the DC increases by that amount.) The giant must be ready

for and aware of the attack.

GHAELE (CELESTIAL)

Outsider (Chaotic, Good)

The ghaeles are the knight-errants of the celestials, tasked

with seeking out evil wherever it rears its head. Although

quite capable of fighting evil outright, they prefer to aid

mortals in their fight against evil, training them to use their

abilities and setting them on the right course. Ghaeles have

phenomenal powers at their disposal, which make them

appealing choices for players.

A ghaele begins play with the ability to cast spells as a

cleric, plus resistance to three energy types. As it gains

levels, its spellcasting ability increases, as do its resistances

(some of which eventually become immunities). It devel-

ops many spell-like abilities, spell resistance, and damage

reduction, all of which increase in power over time. Its abil-

ity scores increase as well, and it gains the power to become

a globe of pure energy that can fly and fire beams of pure

light. A ghaele has so many abilities that they must be

spread over twenty levels to create a balanced character.

Because its 10 Hit Dice are far below its actual ECL, when

part of a group of adventurers, a ghaele must take care that

it does not overestimate its ability to keep up with the cler-

ics and fighters during combat.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: None. Young ghaeles

are  physically  and  mentally  no  greater  or  lesser  than  a

typical human, but over time they become very powerful.

Speed: Ghaele land speed is 50 feet.

Darkvision: Ghaeles can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Ghaeles can see twice as far as a human

in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar  condi-

tions  of  poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic.

Favored  Class:  Ghaele.  Because  ghaeles  have  an  ECL  of

20, multiclassing requires the use of epic level rules (see

Epic Level Handbook for more information).

Class Skills

The ghaeles class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex),

Hide (Dex), Knowledge (any three, chosen at 1st level)

(Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ghaele monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ghaeles are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, but not with

armor or shields.

Feats: A ghaele receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 7th, and 15th level. After 20th level it

gains feats normally according to its character level (which

requires epic level advancement rules; see Epic Level Hand-

book for more information).

Spells: A ghaele casts spells as a cleric of its class level

(maximum caster level 14th) and may also prepare spells

from the Air, Animal, Chaos, Good, and Plant domains as if

they were on the cleric spell list.

Lesser Ghaele Powers (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, a

ghaele can use the following spell-like abilities once per

day: aid, alter self, color spray, comprehend languages, continual

flame, cure light wounds, dancing lights, detect evil, detect

thoughts, and see invisibility. At 5th level it can use these abil-

ities three times per day, and at 8th level it can use them at

will. The ghaeles caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from

the ghaele class, to a maximum caster level of 12th (save DC

10 + spell level + Cha modifier).

Spell Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, a ghaele gains spell

resistance equal to its class level +8.

Ghaele Powers (Sp): Beginning at 6th level, a ghaele can

use the following spell-like abilities once per day: chain

lightning, charm monster, dispel magic, hold monster, improved

invisibility (self only), major image, and wall of force. At 9th

level it can use any of these except chain lightning and wall of

force three times per day, and at 12th level it can use any of

them except chain lightning and wall of force at will.

Protective Aura (Su): Starting at 6th level, as a free

action a ghaele can surround itself with a nimbus of light

having a radius of 20 feet. This light acts as a magic circle

against evil (but providing +4 bonuses instead of +2 bo-

nuses). At 10th level, the protective aura also functions as a

minor globe of invulnerability. The ghaeles caster level for

these effects is its Hit Dice from ghaele class levels. The

aura can be dispelled, but the ghaele can create it again as a

free action on its next turn.

Alternate Form (Su): Upon reaching 7th level, as a

standard action a ghaele can assume the form of an incor-

poreal globe of color 5 feet in diameter. In globe form, it

can fly at speed 150 feet (perfect), fire light rays (see below),

and use its spell-like abilities, but it cannot make other

physical attacks, use its gaze, or cast spells. The ghaele can

remain in either form indefinitely, and dispel magic and

similar spells do not cause it to revert to another form. If

killed, it does not revert to another form. A true seeing spell

used to view a ghaele with this ability reveals both forms

simultaneously.

Light Ray (Ex): A ghaele in globe form can project two

light rays per round with a range of 300 feet, dealing the

indicated damage.

Gaze (Su): At 7th level, a ghaele gains a gaze attack in its

humanoid form that can kill or cause fear. The range of the

attack and the maximum HD of creatures it can affect

increase as the ghaele attains higher levels. Evil creatures of

the indicated HD or less must succeed on a Will save (DC

10 + 1/2 ghaeles HD from class levels + ghaeles Cha modi-

fier) or die instantly. Those that succeed are affected as

though by a fear spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures of

the indicated HD or less and evil creatures with more than

the indicated HD must succeed on a Will save or suffer the

fear effect.

Greater Ghaele Powers (Sp): Beginning at 14th level, a

ghaele can use prismatic spray and teleport without error (self

plus 50 pounds of objects only) each once per day as a sor-

cerer of his class level (maximum caster level 12th). At 17th

level it can use teleport without error three times per day, and

at 20th level it can use teleport without error at will.

Positive Energy (Ex): A ghaele can infuse its melee

weapon with celestial power, causing it deal an additional

2d6 points of positive energy damage to evil creatures.

Infusing a melee weapon in this manner requires 1 minute

of concentration and lasts for 1 day, but the power vanishes

immediately if the weapon leaves the celestials possession.

GHOUL

Undead

Although usually portrayed as bloodthirsty killers content

to dine on carrion, ghouls were once living humanoids

with true emotions. Sometimes memories of that previous

life comes back to haunt the ghoul, and such a character

makes an excellent tragic character. A player character

ghoul might wish to avenge its death, protect a loved one

from its life, or destroy an old enemy. Ghouls are strong

characters because of their combat ability, particularly their

resistance to many kinds of damage.

Most of a ghouls power comes from the fact that it is

undead. On top of the standard undead immunities, it has

favorable ability score modifiers and (after 1st level) mul-

tiple attacks per round. Although it is at risk of being

destroyed or controlled by a clerics use of positive or nega-

tive energy, even the weakest ghoul has turn resistance.

Probably the greatest drawback to playing a ghoul is the

danger of immediate destruction upon reaching 0 hit

points, so a smart ghoul should be careful in combat or

invest in armor, magical protection, or the Toughness feat.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Cha,

Con . Ghouls are stronger than humans and arrogant

enough  to  consider  most  humanoids  to  be  little  more

than prey animals. As an undead creature, a ghoul does

not have a Constitution score.

Undead:  Ghouls  are  immune  to  mind-affecting  effects,

poison,  sleep, paralysis,  stunning,  and  disease.  They  are

not  subject  to  critical  hits,  subdual  damage,  ability

damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

Speed: Ghoul land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Ghouls can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored Class: Ghoul. The best multiclassing choices for

a ghoul are fighter, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard.

Class Skills

The ghouls class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex),

Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession

(Wis), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the ghoul monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ghouls are proficient

with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Feats: A ghoul receives one feat at 1st level. After 6th

level it gains feats normally according to its character level,

as shown on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent

Benefits.

Bite: A ghoul has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Claws: Beginning at 2nd level, a ghoul has two claw

attacks that are natural weapons dealing the indicated

damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Paralysis (Ex): A creature hit by a bite or claw attack

from a ghoul of 2nd level or higher must succeed on a For-

titude save (DC 10 + 1/2 ghouls HD from class levels +

ghouls Cha modifier) or be paralyzed for the indicated

duration. Elves are immune to this paralysis.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a 5th-level

ghoul rises as a 5th-level ghoul in 1d4 days. Casting protec-

tion from evil on a body before the end of that time averts the

transformation. A created spawn is under the command of

the ghoul that created it and remains enslaved until its

masters death.

A ghoul can control a number of spawn equal to its HD 

2. If it creates a spawn that causes it to exceed this limit, the

spawn longest under its control is released.

GREEN HAG

Monstrous Humanoid (Aquatic)

Smaller than (but of comparable power to) the annis hag, the

green hag prefers swampy, wet environments where it can

take advantage of its ability to breathe water. Green hags,

too, can blend in with humanoid civilizations, and they may

join an adventuring party in disguise to further their own

goals. Slightly weaker than an annis in terms of melee abil-

ity, a green hag still is a formidable combatant and has even

more magic than its larger cousin. Green hags are good

choices for players who want a monstrous witch character

that eventually multiclasses into a spellcasting class.

The green hag monster class starts with relatively weak

melee attacks, low natural armor, and access to its weakest

spell-like abilities. Over time the attacks grow more power-

ful, the natural armor increases, and greater spell-like abili-

ties are gained. In the middle of the level progression, a

green hag gains limited spell resistance and its weakness-

inducing ability. The highest levels round out its ability

score increases, boost natural armor, and grant its last feat.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Int, +2 Wis. Green

hags are smart and cunning.

Speed:  Green  hag  land  speed  is  30  feet,  swim  speed  30

feet. Like any creature with a swim speed, green hags can

move  through  the  water  at  that  speed  without  making

Swim  checks,  they  have  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Swim

checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard,

and can always take 10 when making Swim checks. They

can  use  the  run  action  while  swimming,  provided  they

swim in a straight line.

Darkvision: Green hags can see in the dark up to 90 feet.

Mimicry:  Green  hags  can  imitate  the  sounds  of  almost

any animal found near their lairs.

Automatic Languages: Common and Giant.

Favored Class: Green hag. The best multiclassing choices

for a green hag are fighter, cleric, and wizard.

Class Skills

The green hags class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex),

Table A23: The Green Hag

Knowledge (any one, chosen at 1st level) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the green hag mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Green hags are profi-

cient with all simple weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Aquatic Subtype: Green hags can breathe water or air

equally well.

Feats: A green hag receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 7th, and 13th level. After 14th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: The green hag has two claw attacks that are natu-

ral weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Lesser Green Hag Powers (Sp): A green hag can use the

following abilities the indicated number of times per day:

change self, dancing lights, ghost sound, and pass without trace. A

green hags caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from class

levels.

Greater Green Hag Powers (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level,

a green hag can use the following abilities the indicated

number of times per day: invisibility, tongues, and water

breathing. A green hags caster level is equal to its Hit Dice

from class levels.

Weakness (Su): Starting at 4th level, a green hag can

weaken a foe by making a melee touch attack. The affected

opponent must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2

green hags HD from class levels + green hags Cha modi-

fier) or take the indicated amount of Strength damage.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A green hag of 7th level or higher

has spell resistance equal to 4 + its class level.

GRIFFON

Magical Beast

Griffons fly. They bear riders. They fight well, with all the

advantages of an eagle and the ferocity of a lion. It takes an

unusual player to accept a lesser role as a steed, exceptional

though a griffon may be. It takes an even more determined

character to break that mold and form more equal relation-

ships, yet still befriend, and sometimes serve as a steed for,

another character.

The griffon remains an interesting choice as a monster

character despite its lack of hands or limbs that can manip-

ulate objects, wield weapons, or hold shields. That is a major

disadvantage, and it takes a devoted player to accept it

even in exchange for the ability to fly. The monster classs

advancement is based on the griffons ability to fly, its ability

score and natural armor increases, and scent. Initially it is

not strong enough to fly on its own, but eventually it gains

flight and even enough strength to carry a rider. It gains the

pounce ability soon after gaining the ability to fly, and the

rake ability follows shortly thereafter.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  6  Int,  2  Cha.  A

griffon has great potential because of the strength, agility,

and  toughness  for  which  its  kind  are  known,  yet  it  is

hindered by a low Intelligence score.

Magical Beast: Griffon characters are magical beasts.

Speed: Griffon land speed is 30 feet.

Skills:  +4  racial  bonus  on  Jump  checks  and  on  Spot

checks made in daylight.

Darkvision: Griffons can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Low-Light  Vision:  Griffons  can  see  twice  as  far  as  a

human  in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar

conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Automatic  Languages:  None.  A  griffon  cannot  speak  or

communicate without the assistance of magic, but it can

understand Common.

Favored Class: Griffon. The best multiclassing choices for

a griffon are fighter and ranger.

Class Skills

The griffons class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a griffon takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the griffon monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A griffon has no pro-

ficiency with weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A griffon receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd and 7th level. After 10th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Bite: The griffon has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Claws: At 3rd level, a griffon gains two claw attacks that

are natural weapons dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2

Strength bonus.

Pounce (Ex): If a griffon of 4th level or higher charges a

foe, it can still make a full attack in the same round.

Rake: A griffon of 6th level or higher that pounces on an

opponent can make two rake attacks with its hind legs (at

the same attack bonus as its normal claw attack) for 1d6

points of damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus. These rake

attacks are in addition to its other attacks for the round.

GRIG (SPRITE)

Fey

Grigs are mischievous and the fiercest of the sprite kindred.

Very small and weak physically, they are clever and use tac-

tics, ranged weapons, and magic to defeat their enemies.

Sometimes they make friends with elves or other folk that

respect the forest and join adventuring groups. Their frail

and tiny bodies make them unsuited to melee combat, but

they can be deadly with a bow and can make themselves

invisible to compensate for the risk. Grigs are good charac-

ters for players who want the challenge of playing a trick-

ster that is not terribly powerful.

The greatest disadvantage to playing grigs is their low Hit

Dice. Even a 4th-level grig has only 1/2 Hit Die and can be

killed by a critical hit from a short sword. Balancing this vul-

nerability is a very high Dexterity and a size bonus to Armor

Class, plus the ability to fly and become invisible, all of which

should keep a grig out of harms way until it can take levels in

a character class that will grant more Hit Dice. The short pro-

gression of the grig monster class to its final ECL of 4 grants

it ability score increases, more uses of its spell-like abilities, a

small amount of natural armor, and a bonus feat.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: 6 Str, +6 Dex. Grigs

are physically weak but incredibly agile.

Tiny:  As  Tiny  creatures,  grigs  gain  a  +2  size  bonus  to

Armor Class, a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +8 size

bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller weap-

ons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting and

carrying  limits  are  one-half  of  those  of  Medium-size

HAMATULA (DEVIL)

Outsider (Evil, Lawful)

Hamatulas, sometimes called barbed devils, are tough and

strong. Gifted with many spell-like abilities and powerful

melee attacks, they are used as guardians and patrol troops

by the most powerful devils. Roughly humanoid in appear-

ance, they can disguise themselves as unusually large

humans, half-orcs, or tieflings. Hamatulas make good fight-

ers and clerics, and are a good choice for players who want to

play a character resembling the traditional form of a devil.

Most of this monsters abilities are physical, so the mon-

ster class is based on an advancement of its attack and

defensive abilities, flavored with its more unusual powers at

levels where comparable spells become available to stan-

dard-race classes. Its level adjustment is only +5, so it does

not suffer greatly compared to fighters, particularly when

taking into account its strong ability score modifiers,

unusual attack forms, and defenses such as damage reduc-

tion. The capstone of this class is the ability to use teleport

without error at will, making the hamatula a good scout, spy,

or hit-and-run fighter.

Class Features

Racial Traits

All of the following are class features of the grig monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Grigs are proficient

with all simple weapons, with the composite longbow, and

with the short sword, but not with armor or shields.

Feats: A grig receives one feat at 1st level and Dodge as a

bonus feat at 2nd level. After 4th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Spell-Like Abilities: A grig can use these spell-like abil-

ities the indicated number of times per day as a 9th-level

sorcerer: change self, entangle, invisibility (self only), pyrotech-

nics, and ventriloquism.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A grig has spell resistance equal

to its class level + 13.

Attune Fiddle (Su): Using a process similar to crafting a

magic item, a 4th-level grig with a fiddle appropriate to its

size can spend one day attuning that instrument to itself

and its natural magic. Once the fiddle is attuned, the grig

may invoke a special magic. When the fiddler plays, any

nonsprite within 30 feet of the instrument must succeed on

a Will save (DC 15) or be affected as though by Ottos irre-

sistible dance as long as the playing continues. The fiddle

cannot be used in this manner by anyone else, and if sepa-

rated from the grig for more than a week, it must undergo

the attunement process again. Only grigs who have chosen

fiddle as a type of performance with the Perform skill can

attune a fiddle in this manner.

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Wis.

Hamatulas are strong and alert.

Speed: Hamatula land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Hamatulas can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Hamatula darkvision functions in all magical darkness as

well as normal darkness.

Immunities:  Hamatulas  are  immune  to  fire  and  poison,

which are omnipresent on their home plane.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal.

Favored  Class:  Hamatula. The  best  multiclassing  choice

for a hamatula is fighter.

Class Skills

The hamatulas class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen

(Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Search (Int),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the hamatula mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Hamatulas are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons but not with

armor or shields.

Feats: A hamatula receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 7th, and 13th level. After 15th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

darkness of any kind.

Claws: A hamatula has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Telepathy: A hamatula of 2nd level or higher can com-

municate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet

that has a language.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day a hamatula of 3rd

level or higher can attempt to summon lemures (see the

Monster Manual). The number summoned and the chance of

success increase as the hamatula advances in level. At 11th

level a hamatula can instead attempt to summon another of

its kind, with the indicated chance of success.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A hamatula has spell resistance

equal to 9 + class level.

Lesser Hamatula Powers (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level,

a hamatula can use the following spell-like abilities once

per day: charm person, desecrate, doom, hold person, produce

flame, and pyrotechnics. At 5th level it can use them three

times per day, and at 8th level it can use them at will. The

hamatulas caster level is equal to its Hit Dice from class

levels (save DC 10 + spell level + hamatulas Cha modifier).

Hamatula Powers (Sp): Beginning at 7th level, a hama-

tula can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

animate dead, major image, and suggestion. At 10th level it can

use them three times per day, and at 13th level it can use

them at will.

Impale (Ex): A hamatula of 7th level or higher deals 3d4

points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent on a suc-

cessful grapple check, adding 1 1/2 times its Strength

bonus to damage.

Fear (Su): A creature hit by a hamatula must succeed on

a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hamatulas HD from class levels +

hamatulas Cha modifier) or be affected as though by fear

cast by a sorcerer of the hamatulas Hit Dice. Whether or

not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected

again by that hamatulas fear ability for one day.

Greater Hamatula Powers (Sp): Beginning at 9th level,

a hamatula can use the following spell-like abilities once

per day: either orders wrath or unholy blight, and teleport with-

out error (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). At 12th level

it can use teleport without error three times per day, and at

14th level it can use teleport without error at will.

HARPY

Monstrous Humanoid

Filthy birdfolk with a fondness for causing suffering,

harpies are tough creatures that rely on their powerful song

to capture prey. They gain the ability to fly and expand the

range of their song to almost that of a long-range spell,

making them well suited for dungeon combat or in open-

air surroundings where they can make use of their mobility.

Harpies are good choices for players who want an exotic

rogue, bard, or sorcerer, particularly those that focus on

spying on and controlling other beings.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  4  Int,  +2

Cha.  Harpies  are  quick  and  vain  (in  their  own  fashion)

but not very clever.

Speed: Harpy land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Harpies can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored Class: Harpy. The best multiclassing choices for

a harpy are bard, rogue, and sorcerer.

Class Skills

The harpys class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profes-

sion (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

IMP (DEVIL)

Outsider (Evil, Lawful)

Imps are among the least

powerful  devils,  but  still

quite  capable  of  slaying

normal  humans  with

little effort. Often bound

to  the  service  of  evil

spellcasters,  imps  are

sometimes  sent  to  the

Material  Plane  on  mis-

sions of spying or harass-

ment,  or  sometimes  just

to  carry  messages.  Be-

cause it can take the form

of  normal  animals,  an

imp  can  blend  in  with

adventuring  parties  as  a

pet, familiar, animal com-

panion,  or  domesticated

animal.  Imps  are  good

choices  for  players  who

like  sneaky  characters

with  some  magical  pow-

er as a backup.

Because it has few pow-

erful  physical  abili-

ties, the imp class

places  its  spell-

like abilities at ap-

propriate  levels

and  delays  the

acquisition  of

the  regenera-

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Dex. Imps have to

be fast to avoid their larger cousins.

Tiny:  As  Tiny  creatures,  imps  gain  a  +2  size  bonus  to

Armor Class, a +2 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +8 size

bonus  on  Hide  checks,  but  they  must  use  smaller

weapons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting

and carrying limits are one-half of those of Medium-size

characters. An imp has a face of 2 1/2 feet by 2 1/2 feet

and a reach of 0 feet.

Speed: Imp land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Imps can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Imp

darkvision  functions  in  all  magical  darkness  as  well  as

normal darkness.

Poison  Immunity:  Imps  are  naturally  poisonous  crea-

tures and immune to all poisons.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal.

Favored Class: Imp. The best multiclassing choice for an

imp is rogue.

Class Skills

The imps class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Spellcraft (Int), and Spot

(Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the imp monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Imps are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: An imp receives one feat at 1st level and an addi-

tional one at 4th level. It gains Weapon Finesse (sting) as a

bonus feat at 2nd level. After 7th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Sting: An imp has a tail stinger attack that is a natural

weapon dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Poison (Ex): The imps sting injects a poison that deals

the indicated primary and secondary damage (DC 10 + 1/2

imps HD from class levels + imps Con modifier + 2 racial

bonus).

Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): An imps caster level for its

detect good, detect magic, invisibility, and suggestion spell-like

abilities is equal to twice its Hit Dice from class levels. An

imps caster level for its commune ability is 12th.

Polymorph (Su): Starting at 3rd level, an imp chooses

one alternate form no larger than Medium-size (commonly

a monstrous spider, raven, rat, or boar). It can take this form

at will as if using the polymorph self spell (caster level 12th).

At 6th level it can choose a second form.

Regeneration (Ex): Imps take normal damage from

acid, and from holy or blessed weapons (if they have a +1 or

higher enhancement bonus).

JANNI (GENIE)

Outsider

Born of all four elements, jann are the weakest of the genies

and spend most of their time on the Material Plane. More

advanced than humans in every way, jann also have a small

number of spell-like abilities, some of which are particu-

larly powerful. For a plane-traveling adventuring party, a

janni with the natural ability to use plane shift is a handy

friend. Jann are good choices for players who want an ele-

mental-based character that is still humanoid and capable

of being a go-between for the various elemental and out-

sider creatures.

Much of the advancement of the janni class is based on

distributing the classs potent spell-like abilities, particu-

larly invisibility and plane shift. As outsiders, jann have a

strong base attack bonus and good saves in all three cate-

gories. Their ability score bonuses and Hit Dice are spread

over the classs 11 levels. Although good in combat, their +5

level adjustment means jann tend to have fewer Hit Dice

than fighters of the same level, and so they should be aware

of their limitations.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Dex, +2 Con. Jann

are fast like air and fire elementals, and tough like earth

and water elementals.

Speed: Janni land speed is 30 feet.

180

Darkvision: Jann can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Elemental  Endurance:  A  janni  can  survive  on  the  Ele-

mental  Plane  of  Air,  Earth,  Fire,  or  Water  for  up  to  48

hours.  Failure  to  return  to  the  Material  Plane  after  that

time deals 1 point of damage per additional hour to the

janni, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

Automatic  Languages:  Auran,  Aquan,  Ignan,  or  Terran,

spell resistance, and damage reduction, which scale up in

the later levels of the class. The early levels provide the

kyton with its natural armor, its melee attacks, and its

strange gaze. It has fewer Hit Dice than a fighter of its level

but is comparable to a rogue, and its natural abilities make it

a good secondary combatant.

plus Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal.

Racial Traits

Favored Class: Janni. The best multiclassing choices for a

Class Skills

The jannis class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape

Artist (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession

(Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the janni monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Jann are proficient

with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  with  light  and

medium armor, and with shields.

Feats: A janni receives one feat at 1st level and additional

ones at 3rd and 9th level. It gains Improved Initiative as a

bonus feat at 7th level. After 11th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): A jannis enlarge, invisibility,

reduce, and speak with animals abilities have a caster level

equal to class level + 1. The caster level for its create food and

water ability is 7th.

KYTON (DEVIL)

Outsider (Evil, Lawful)

Very humanlike in some ways but definitely fiendish,

kytons are strange, brutish creatures wrapped in chains that

serve as clothing, natural armor, weapons, and pets. They

are very useful in the rare environment that contains a lot

of chains but are average fighters in normal melee situa-

tions. Often mistaken for haunting spirits because of their

chains, kytons can pass for humans if they wear other cloth-

ing. Kytons are good choices for players who want to play

gladiator-style characters with some unusual abilities.

A kytons most powerful abilities are its dancing chains,

Table A30: The Janni

Int. Kytons are physically hardy but very simple.

Speed: Kyton land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Kytons can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Cold  Immunity:  Kytons  hail  from  the  colder  parts  of

Baator and are immune to cold.

Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the kyton monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Kytons are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons, with the spiked chain,

but with no armor or shields. A kytons body chains do not

count toward the weight of its equipment.

Feats: A kyton receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 14th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Chain Rakes: A kyton can use the chains wrapping its

body as melee weapons, making two attacks per round at its

normal base attack bonus (without any off-hand or two-

weapon fighting penalties) and dealing the indicated

damage plus Strength bonus. Any feats the kyton has

regarding its chain rakes (such as Weapon Focus or Im-

proved Critical) apply to using a spiked chain, and vice

versa. Unwrapping a body chain to use as a weapon is a free

action. A kyton can be disarmed of a chain it is using, but

that simply causes the chain to wrap itself around the

kytons body again; pieces broken from a sundered chain

wrap themselves automatically in a similar fashion. A chain

is considered a Large weapon, even though the kyton is able

to wield chains one-handed.

Chain Reach: A kytons chain rakes have a reach of 10

feet. Like a spiked chain, a kytons chains may be used

against adjacent targets as well as targets at its maximum

reach in the same round.

Unnerving Gaze (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a kyton can

make its face resemble one of the opponents departed

loved ones or bitter enemies. Those subjected to the gaze

must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 kytons HD from

class levels + kytons Cha modifier) or take a 1 morale

penalty on all attack rolls for 1d3 rounds. The gaze affects all

enemies within a certain distance. The radius of the effect

increases from 5 feet at 3rd level to 30 feet at 12th level and

higher. Creatures can only be subject to a particular kytons

unnerving gaze attack once per day.

Dancing Chains (Su): As a standard action, a kyton of

4th level or higher may control the indicated number of

unattended chains within 20 feet, making them dance or

move as it wishes. In addition, the kyton can increase the

chains length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout

razor-edged barbs (the chains return to their normal length

and shape when the kyton stops controlling them). Each

chain may make one attack per round as if the kyton were

wielding it directly.

A kyton can climb chains it controls at its normal speed

without a Climb check.

Regeneration (Ex): A kyton of 8th level or higher takes

normal damage from fire, acid, and blessed weapons (if they

bypass the kytons damage reduction).

Spell Resistance (Ex): A kyton of 10th level or higher

has spell resistance equal to 9 + Hit Dice from class level.

LILLEND

Outsider (Chaotic, Good)

Lillends are strange outsiders with a love of music and nat-

ural beauty. Although some might think them fiendish

because of their serpentine bodies, their beautiful faces and

voices and magnificent feathered wings show their benign

nature. Incredibly strong, wise, and confident, lillends

make strong fighters and bards but excel at any task they

choose. Lillends are good choices for players who want

exotic characters with a strong desire to do good.

Lillends have good ability scores, natural armor, combat

abilities, spellcasting, and spell-like abilities. They have

enough special abilities that the class has a useful ability or

ability score increase at every character level. The biggest

drawback to the class is its 7 Hit Dice relative to its ECL of

13, so a lillend cannot take quite as much punishment as a

fighter of the same level.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Wis,  +2  Cha.

Lillends are wise, personable, and confident.

Speed: Lillend land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Lillends can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Tail Slap: A lillend has a tail slap attack that is a natural

weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength

bonus.

Bard Abilities: Starting at 2nd level, a lillend casts spells

and has the bardic music ability of a bard of half its class level.

Lillend World Powers (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a lil-

lend can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

darkness, hallucinatory terrain, knock, and light. At 9th level

and higher it can use them three times per day. The lillends

caster level is its effective bard level + 4.

Lillend Talk Powers (Sp): Beginning at 5th level, a lil-

lend can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

charm person, speak with animals, and speak with plants. Its

caster level is its effective bard level + 4.

Improved Grab (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a lillend can

use this ability if its hits a creature of its size or smaller with

its tail attack. If it gets a hold, it can constrict.

Constrict (Ex): A lillend deals tail slap damage plus

Strength bonus against creatures it grapples with its tail.

This attack uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it

cannot take any move actions when constricting, though it

can still attack with a hand-held weapon.

MAGMIN

is found to restrain its urges when it is in civilized areas.

Magmins are physically weak, with almost all of their

power stemming from their natural ability to ignite objects

and exude heat. These two abilities start out weak but

develop quickly. At the highest levels, the magmins damage

reduction kicks in, balancing its weak Hit Dice.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: 2 Str, +2 Dex, 2 Int.

Magmins  are  somewhat  weak  because  of  their  size  and

not too smart, but relatively quick.

Small: As Small creatures, Magmins gain a +1 size bonus

to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4

size  bonus  on  Hide  checks,  but  they  must  use  smaller

weapons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting

and  carrying  limits  are  three-quarters  of  those  of

Medium-size characters.

Speed: Magmin land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Magmins can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Ignan.

Favored Class: Magmin. The best multiclassing choice for

a magmin is rogue.

Class Skills

Elemental (Fire)

Made from molten rock, magmins are mischievous ele-

mental creatures that do not really understand the damage

they can cause. Quick but dumb, magmins have a hard

time carrying nonmetallic equipment. Because they have

such a limited focus, they are good characters for players

who have a need to cause some destruction but dont have

a long-term interest in a particular character. A magmin

fighter or barbarian could be a workable character if a way

The magmins class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Jump (Str),

Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the magmin mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Magmins are not pro-

ficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A magmin receives one feat at 1st level. After 6th

level it gains feats normally according to its character level,

as shown on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent

Benefits.

Fire Subtype (Ex): A magmin is immune to fire damage

and takes a 10 penalty on saves against cold attacks. If a

cold attack does not allow a saving throw, the creature takes

double damage instead.

Burning Touch: The magmin has a burning touch attack

that is a natural weapon dealing the indicated damage. If

the magmin uses a metal weapon, it adds half its burning

touch damage to the weapon damage.

Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within a certain distance from

a magmin of 2nd level or higher must succeed on a Forti-

tude save (DC 10 + 1/2 magmins HD from class levels +

magmins Con modifier) or take the indicated damage from

the intense heat. The radius of the emanation increases

from 5 feet at 2nd level to 30 feet at 6th level.

Combustion (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a magmin gains

this ability. Anyone it hits with its burning touch must suc-

ceed on a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 magmins HD from class

levels + magmins Con modifier) or take additional fire

damage equal to the magmins burning touch damage as

clothes ignite or armor becomes searing hot. The damage

continues for another 1d4+2 rounds after the magmins last

successful attack. Magmins can also ignite flammable mate-

rials with a touch. Attacks from a magmin with a weapon do

not cause the target to combust.

Melt Weapons (Ex): Any metal weapon that strikes a

magmin must succeed on a

Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 magmins HD

from class levels +

magmins Con

modifier) or

melt away

into slag.

MEDUSA

Monstrous Humanoid

Whether the image of this snake-haired being emerges

from literary description, the imagination, or from a fantasy

film, the idea of a creature that can turn a human into

unmoving stone with a glance is terrifying. What if a player

character could threaten the denizens of a dungeon or the

enemy within a foreign keep with a petrifying counte-

nance? The troubling side of playing a medusa character is

that unless the medusas face is concealed (in which case

the medusa suffers from all the consequences of blindness),

its allies risk becoming realistic sculptures.

The important question in building the medusa monster

class is where to place its petrifying gaze. Since it is the most

important feature of the class, and the most likely to present

game balance concerns to a Dungeon Master, the gaze lies

close to the top of the range. At lower levels, the medusa

must make do with ability score increases, natural armor,

and poisonous snakes. The snakes deal Strength damage, a

relatively weak poison that doesnt upset game balance. At

higher levels, the medusas poison grows in efficiency, even-

tually becoming powerful enough to debilitate a strong war-

rior with a single snakes attack. Eventually, the monster

class at its highest level offers the medusa the power to con-

trol its gaze attacks so it strikes down foes, not friends.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Cha.

Medusas are quick and have a strong sense of self.

Speed: Medusa land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Medusas can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored  Class:  Medusa. The  best  multiclassing  choice

for a medusa is fighter, but its high Charisma

and  gaze  attack  make  it  better  suited  for

some  class  that  does  not

put  the  character  on

the  front  line  of  the

war,  such  as  bard  or

sorcerer.

Class Skills

The medusas class skills (and the key ability for each skills)

are Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Move Silently

(Dex), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the medusa mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Medusas are profi-

cient with all simple weapons and with shortbows but not

with armor or shields.

Feats: A medusa receives two feats at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 10th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Snakes: The medusa has a snake-hair attack that is a nat-

ural  weapon  dealing  the  indicated  damage  plus  1/2

Strength bonus. The snakes always attack as one unit (the

medusa cannot direct half of its snakes to attack one crea-

ture and half another).

Poison (Ex): A medusas snake attack injects the target

with poison (Fort DC 10 + 1/2 medusas HD from class

levels + medusas Con modifier). The poison deals the indi-

cated primary and secondary damage.

Petrifying Gaze (Su): Beginning at 6th level, a medusa

gains the ability to petrify targets with its gaze. Unlike a

fully developed gaze attack, a young medusa can use this

ability only once per day and can only use it as an active

attack against a single target within 10 feet. At 8th level its

range extends to 30 feet, and the medusa can use its gaze in

this manner up to three times per day. At 10th level its gaze

attack fully matures, and it can use it at will. Targets of the

gaze may resist with a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 medusas

HD from class levels + medusas Cha modifier).

the mind flayer character is a match for the standard mind

flayer. A mind flayer has a number of abilities to disperse to

that point, but its mind blast is a trademark ability that is

introduced as soon as possible. The ability first appears at

4th level, but is limited in its uses per day, with a lower save

DC, and affecting only a single target. One by one, those

restraints fall away until the character deals its 3d4 rounds

of stunning, in a cone, at will. The rest of the mind flayers

spell-like psionic powers appear in order of their spell levels

from lowest to highest.

The choice for mind flayer advancement is mostly moot,

unless the campaign extends itself to epic levels beyond

20th. In that case, the old mind flayer tradition of wizardry

is the best path for most mind flayers to pursue. With a +8

bonus to Intelligence, a mind flayer character given time

and experience to develop its abilities can make a formida-

ble archmage, and its spells would be very difficult to resist.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Int. Mind flayers

are intelligent creatures, albeit with an alien mindset.

Speed: Mind flayer land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Mind flayers can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic  Languages:  Undercommon.  However,  mind

flayers prefer to communicate telepathically.

Favored  Class:  Mind  flayer.  The  best  multiclassing

choices for a mind flayer are wizard and sorcerer.

Class Skills

The mind flayers class skills (and the key ability for each

skills) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (any two, chosen at 1st level)

(Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis),

and Spot (Wis).

MIND FLAYER

Class Features

Aberration

Mind flayers, like drow and driders, have a long history of

terrorizing adventurers and heroes who dare to intrude

within the deep reaches of the underworld. These aberra-

tions rip the brains from their foes. As if that were not

enough, the mind flayer triply earns its name with psionic

powers and with mind blasts that can reduce foes to quiver-

ing inactivity.

The mind flayers level adjustment is very high (+7), so

most of the monster class involves reaching a point where

All of the following are class features of the mind flayer

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A mind flayer has no

proficiency with weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A mind flayer receives one feat at 1st level and

additional ones at 5th and 11th level. After 15th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Tentacles: A mind flayer uses its four facial tentacles for

eating, but it also becomes adept at using them to attack

creatures  in  combat.  Its  tentacles  are  natural  melee

weapons and deal the indicated damage plus Strength

modifier. A mind flayer that cannot use all four of its ten-

tacles in combat is still able to use them to eat in a non-

combat situation.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mind flayer

must hit a Small, Medium-size, or Large creature with a ten-

tacle attack (or a Huge creature if it can reach the creatures

head). If the grab is successful, on its next action the mind

flayer may attempt to attach its remaining tentacles with a

single grapple check. The target can escape all the tentacles

with a single grapple check, but the mind flayer gets a +2

bonus to oppose this check for each of its tentacles beyond

the first that is attached to the target.

Telepathy (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a mind flayer gains

telepathy at the indicated range. It may communicate tele-

pathically with any creature in range that has a language.

Psionics (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level, a mind flayer

acquires psionic abilities. Unless otherwise indicated, the

abilities may be used at will. The effective sorcerer level for

these abilities is equal to the mind flayers Hit Dice from

class levels. The save DC for psionics effects is 10 + spell

level + mind flayers Charisma modifier.

Mind Blast (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, a mind flayer can

create a blast of mental energy. A creature attacked by a

mind blast can attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 medusas

HD from class levels + medusas Cha modifier) to avoid

being stunned. Initially this ability is usable once per day

against only one creature within 10 feet, and the stunned

effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. As a mind flayer advances in

level, its mind blast affects all creatures in a cone extending

out from the mind flayer, the ability is usable more often,

and the duration of the effect lengthens. At 14th level, a

mind flayer can use its mind blast at will. It affects all crea-

tures in a 60-foot cone, and those that fail their saves are

stunned for 3d4 rounds.

Spell Resistance (Ex): Beginning at 6th level, a mind

flayer gains spell resistance equal to 10 + its class level.

Extract (Ex): A mind flayer of 12th level or higher that

begins its turn with all four tentacles attached and makes a

successful grapple check automatically extracts the oppo-

nents brain, instantly killing that creature (unless it has

multiple brains or can function without its brain).

MUMMY

Undead

Undead monsters can be tough to adapt to a setting, but the

story that they bring with them often makes it worth the

extra effort. What could bring a mummy to abandon its

eternal vigilance and take up the career of a traveling

adventurer? The mummy character must answer that ques-

tion. Is it vengeance, the pursuit of a grave robber or dese-

crator of the dead? Is it the suddenly recovered memory of

the life long past? Alternatively, does this creature of the

dead, of all of the things that prowl the night, seek to ends

its years of service to negative powers? Does it long to be

human once more, or simply to end its suffering in pursuit

of something more noble?

The mummy has in its repertoire despair, mummy rot,

improved ability scores, natural armor, and its very status as

an undead creature. The undead status comes first, and

because of this type advantage, the mummy must wait for

several levels to acquire any special abilities. What is fre-

quently the most feared aspect of an encounter with a hos-

tile mummy, its supernatural rotting disease, does not play

much into the effectiveness of a player character mummy.

While PCs must deal with long-term consequences such as

diseases and curses, the typical monster wont be alive long

enough for the disease to matteror if it is, its only be-

cause the player characters have met an untimely end. The

mummys despair, on the other hand, is much more useful,

even if it is troublesome for companions to deal with its par-

alyzing visage each morning.

The mummys ability scores encourage it down the path

of any character class that does not rely on Dexterity or

Intelligence. Sorcerer, cleric, and fighter are the most likely

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  Con  ,  4

Int.  Mummies  are  strong  but  slow,  and  they  tend  to  be

single-minded.  As  an  undead  creature,  a  mummy  does

not have a Constitution score.

Undead: Immune to mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep,

paralysis,  stunning,  and  disease.  Not  subject  to  critical

hits,  subdual  damage,  ability  damage,  energy  drain,  or

death from massive damage. When a mummy is reduced

to 0 hit points, it is immediately destroyed. A destroyed

mummy can be reanimated with a limited wish, wish, or

miracle spell (the first spell causes the mummy to lose a

level, the latter two do not). A resurrection or true resurrec-

tion spell can bring a mummy back to life as a creature

(no longer undead) with a character class appropriate to

the  mummys  life  (the  former  spell  causes  the  ex-

mummy to lose a level, the latter one does not).

Speed: Mummy land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Mummies can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common. Once humanoids them-

selves,  mummies  remember  the  language  of  their  own

former  existence.  Mummies  often  study  rare  or  exotic

languages  in  order  to  preserve  their  connection  to  an

ancient past.

Favored Class: Mummy. The best multiclassing choice for a

mummy is fighter.

Class Skills

The mummys class skills (and the key ability for each

skills) are Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move

Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), and Spot

Feats: A mummy receives one feat at 1st

level and additional ones at 4th and

10th level. After 11th level it

gains feats normally according to its

character level, as shown on Table 25: Expe-

rience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: A mummy has a slam attack that

is a natural weapon dealing the indi-

cated damage plus 1 1/2 times its

Strength bonus.

Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A mummy takes double dam-

age from fire attacks unless a save is allowed for half damage.

A successful save halves the damage and a failure doubles it.

Resistant  to  Blows  (Ex): At  3rd  level,  a  mummy

becomes more resistant to damage. Any physical attacks

against it deal only half damage. Apply this effect before

damage reduction.

Mummy Rot (Su): Starting at 5th level, once per day a

mummy can infect a creature hit by its slam attack with

mummy rot. At 8th level it can do this three times per day,

and at 12th level every one of its slam attacks can inflict the

disease if the mummy wishes. Mummy rot is a supernatural

disease, and it cannot be cured without magic. An afflicted

creature that dies shrivels away into sand and dust that

blow away into nothing at the first wind unless both remove

disease and raise dead (or similar spells) are cast on the

remains within 6 rounds.

Despair (Su): At 10th level and higher, a mummy can

use its despair ability to cause fear in any creature that views

it. Such a creature must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2

mummys HD from class levels + mummys Cha modifier)

or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not

the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again

by that mummys despair ability for one day.

NIXIE (SPRITE)

Fey

Sprites have become known for their mischievous nature,

for their ability to pull pranks of either incredible complex-

ity or simple mirth. In truth sprites, especially nixies, are

reclusive by nature. A few sprites, however, buck the trend,

leaving behind their woods and lakes to learn more of the

larger world. And, perhaps, to make a difference in it. Per-

haps they seek to halt the encroachment of humanity into

their forests and wilds. Or they may realize that as vast as

the bounty of their homelands may be, the world is yet

larger and more interesting.

The advantage of beginning play as a fey creature lies

mostly in the number of skill points with which a fey begins.

Over its first three levels, the nixie character gains all of its

minor but helpful abilities and a potent Charisma score.

Because of the nixies low starting ECL and its good ability

scores, it is one of the best candidates for a monster spell-

caster. Few monsters with an ECL of more than 3 or 4 are

suitable for becoming spellcasters simply because they can

never match the spellcasting power of a human of the same

character level. In the nixies case, the trade may be worth it.

By multiclassing into a sorcerer, the nixie benefits from

Charisma and spell resistance, even if that spell resistance

eventually grows weak relative to character level. Nixies can

also do well as rogues or bards, given their ability scores.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  4  Str,  +4  Dex,  +4

Cha.  Though  weak  in  sheer  physical  power,  the  nixie

relies on grace and winning personality.

Small: As Small creatures, nixies gain a +1 size bonus to

Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and +4 size

bonus  on  Hide  checks,  but  they  must  use  smaller

weapons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting

and carrying limits are one-half of those of Medium-size

characters.

Speed:  Nixie  land  speed  is  20  feet,  swim  speed  30  feet.

Like  any  creature  with  a  swim  speed,  nixies  can  move

through  the  water  at  that  speed  without  making  Swim

checks,  they  have  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Swim  checks  to

perform some special action or avoid a hazard, and they

can always take 10 when making Swim checks. They can

use the run action while swimming provided they swim

in a straight line.

Aquatic Subtype: Nixies can breathe water or air equally

well.

Skills: +2 racial bonus on Search, Spot, and Listen checks;

+5 racial bonus on Hide checks when in water.

Low-Light Vision: Nixies can see twice as far as a human

in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, or similar conditions

of  poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to  distin-

guish color and detail under these conditions.

Automatic Languages: Aquan, Common, and Sylvan.

Favored Class: Nixie. The best multiclassing choices for a

nixie are bard, rogue, and sorcerer.

Class Skills

The nixies class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int) , Escape Artist (Dex), Handle Animal

(Wis), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession

(Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the nixie monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Nixies are proficient

with all simple weapons, and with the short sword, but not

with armor or shields.

Feats: A nixie receives one feat at 1st level. It gains

Dodge as a bonus feat at 3rd level. After 4th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Spell-Like Abilities: A nixie can use the indicated spell-

like abilities the indicated number of times per day. Its

caster level for water breathing is its class level +2. All other

spell-like abilities have a caster level of the nixies class

level.

OGRE

Giant

Ogres stand out as physically powerful combatants, even if

they lack sophistication. Yet style and grace are something

that an ogre character seldom needs. The ogre proves its

worth in single combat and to a party of adventurers in

almost every encounter,

dealing  out  terrible

punishment to its ene-

miesand thats in addi-

tion to its naturally repel-

lent odor.

Class Skills

The ogres class skills (and the key ability for each skills) are

Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Int), and

Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, an ogre takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

Building the ogre mon-

ster class focuses on the crea-

tures Strength, size, and

natural armor. The 1st-

level  ogre  begins  play

strong  but  with  less  than

half of its eventual Strength.

The rest is gained over sev-

eral levels until the ogre char-

acter reaches 8th level. Simi-

larly, the ogres natural armor

slowly accrues over those levels,

beginning at 2nd level. Finally,

at lower levels, the ogre is

merely Medium-size.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Ad-

and severely lacking in social skills.

Speed: Ogre land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Ogres can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Giant.

Favored  Class:  Ogre. The  best  multiclassing  choices  for

an ogre are fighter and barbarian. Training in more than

a  single  additional  class  is  difficult  for  their  uncompli-

cated minds to accept.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ogres are proficient

Feats: An ogre receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 3rd level. After 6th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

OGRE MAGE

Giant

Said to be magical beings native to distant lands, ogre

mages are the opposite of their slow, crude, and brutish

cousins. They can be highly organized and sometimes lead

groups of common ogres, devising tactics that make the

best of ogre strengths while minimizing their weaknesses.

With the ability to change shape, fly, charm enemies, and

escape from danger as smoke, some ogre mages let others

believe that they are actually vampires, fooling enemies

into wasting time trying to turn them or harm them with

holy water. As smart as the average wizard, ogre mages are

clever beings and make good characters for players who

like to plan and lead but still hold their own when swords

must be drawn.

Ogre mages come with a suite of magical abilities, some

of which are very powerful. Their spell-like abilities are

acquired at approximately the same level the equivalent

spells become available to wizards, and the ogre mage starts

out  with  limited  uses  but  eventually  gains  their  full

potency. The ability score bonuses accrue for the entire

range of the class, and at the highest levels the monster

gains spell resistance, regeneration, and its full size.

caster level equal to its Hit Dice from class levels + 4.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A ogre mage has spell resistance

equal to 6 + class level.

Regeneration (Ex): Ogre mages take normal damage

from fire and acid. An ogre mage that loses a limb or body

part can reattach it by holding the severed member to the

stump. Reattachment takes 1 minute. If the head or other

vital organ is removed, it must be reattached within 10 min-

utes or the creature dies. Ogre mages cannot regrow lost

body parts.

Racial Traits

PIXIE (SPRITE)

another one at 4th level. After 12th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

Spell-Like Abilities: An ogre mage can use the indi-

Fey

Pixies are pranksters and greatly enjoy leading travelers

astray, but some break out of this simple mentality and try

to learn more about their world, seek great treasures, or

avenge a particular insult to themselves, their people, or

their homeland. With their natural ability to fly, sense

thoughts, disrupt enemy magic, and become invisible,

pixies are formidable creatures when angered. They are

good choices for players who like to play mischievous char-

acters and want some magic to carry out their plans.

Despite their size, full-grown pixies can be very danger-

ous. Their magical powers and high number of skill points

and feats are responsible for their total ECL of 5, but their

low Hit Dice are their greatest drawback. The class is built

around scaling the spell-like abilities, and their natural

invisibility isnt introduced until 4th level. At the highest

level of the class are the most powerful spell-like abilities

and spell resistance.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: 4 Str, +4 Dex, +2 Int,

+2 Cha. Pixies are physically weak but make up for it in

other areas.

Small: As Small creatures, pixies gain a +1 size bonus to

Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size

bonus on Hide checks, but they must use smaller weap-

ons than Medium-size creatures do, and their lifting and

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the pixie monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Pixies are proficient

with all simple weapons, with the short sword, and with the

composite longbow, but not with armor or shields.

Feats: A pixie receives one feat at 1st level. It gains

Dodge as a bonus feat at 2nd level. After 5th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Lesser Pixie Powers (Sp): A pixie can use the follow-

ing spell-like abilities once per day: dancing lights, detect

chaos, detect good, detect evil, detect law, entangle, and invisibil-

ity (self only). Its caster level for all spell-like abilities is

equal to its class level + 3 (save DC 10 + spell level + pixies

Cha modifier).

RAKSHASA

Outsider (Evil, Lawful)

Said to be the very embodiment of evil, rakshasas are

malevolent and manipulative. They are the masterminds of

evil plots, the leaders of horrible cults, capable of using

magic but naturally resistant to it. Rakshasas are good

choices for players who want to play leaders with some

magical ability and the ability to ignore most of the spells

of enemy casters.

While its ability score increases are significant, a rak-

shasas gifts stem from magic. Its sorcerer abilities progress

about half as fast as those of a true sorcerer, but its superior

base attack bonus, saving throws, and damage reduction

make up for that. The classs most significant ability is its

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

immune to all effects of all 1st-level spells. As it advances in

level it becomes immune to higher-level spells. Like spell

resistance, a rakshasa may suppress this ability in order to

accept its own spells or spells from allies.

SATYR

Fey

If nymphs and dryads represent the beauty of the natural

world, satyrs represent its lust and fertility. Lovers and

drinkers rather than fighters, satyrs are quite capable of

defending themselves, their land, and their mates when

needed. They also have keen senses that help keep them

from being ambushed. Satyrs are good characters for play-

ers who like playing bards but want a more natural feel than

a city-born entertainer.

Satyrs have few abilities that are very remarkable. Their

level adjustment of only +2 is based on their favorable ability

score bonuses, racial bonuses to skills, and magical pipes.

Most of the class is spent advancing the creatures Hit Dice,

with its other abilities distributed over its seven levels. Its

only magical ability is one of the last things it gets.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Cha.

Satyrs are nimble and gregarious.

Speed: Satyr land speed is 40 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Satyrs can see twice as far as a human

in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar  condi-

tions  of  poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skills: +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Automatic Languages: Common and Sylvan.

Favored Class: Satyr. The best multiclassing choices for a

satyr are bard and rogue.

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Gore: The satyr has a gore attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Attune Pipes (Su): A satyr of 5th level or higher with a

set of musical pipes can spend one day attuning that instru-

ment to itself and its natural magic (a process similar to cre-

ating a magic item). Once the pipes are attuned, the satyr

may invoke a special magic. When it plays, all creatures

within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a

Will save (DC 14) or be affected by charm person, fear, or sleep

(caster level equal to twice the satyrs HD from class levels).

The satyr chooses the tune and its effect. A creature that

successfully saves against any of the pipes effects cannot be

affected by the same set of pipes again for one day.

The pipes cannot be used in this manner by anyone else,

and if separated from the satyr for more than a week, they

must undergo the attunement process again. Only satyrs

who have chosen pipes as a type of performance with the

Perform skill can attune a set of pipes in this manner.

SEA HAG

Monstrous Humanoid

Of the many kinds of hag, the sea hag is the most loath-

some, repulsive, and wretched. Most of its magical powers

stem from how hideous it isand the more horrible its

appearance, the more proud the sea hag becomes. As strong

as other hags, sea hags have no special ability to disguise

themselves or mimic others, and so they must be cautious

when away from their lairs. Sea hags are good characters for

players who enjoy dramatic appearances and are looking for

a creature with a lower ECL than a medusa (another horri-

ble-looking monster).

While sea hags have only 3 Hit Dice, their two main abili-

ties are very powerful, capable of weakening large numbers

of creatures at once or slaying one outright. They first gain a

weak form of their Strength attack, which develops over

time into its mature version, and only acquire the deadly

gaze attack at later levels. A sea hags spell resistance is

weaker than that of any other hag, but it gets this ability at a

relatively early level. Like all hags it is very strong, and a sea

hags Strength increases greatly over the classs eight levels.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Wis.  Sea

hags are strong and clever.

Speed: Sea hag land speed is 30 feet, swim speed 40 feet.

Like  any  creature  with  a  swim  speed,  sea  hags  can  move

through  the  water  at  that  speed  without  making  Swim

checks, have a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks to perform

some special action or avoid a hazard, and can always take

10 when making Swim checks. They can use the run action

while swimming provided they swim in a straight line.

Aquatic  Subtype:  Sea  hags  can  breathe  water  or  air

equally well.

Darkvision: Sea hags can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common and Giant.

Favored Class: Sea hag. The best multiclassing choices for

a sea hag are barbarian, fighter, and cleric.

Class Skills

The sea hags class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (any one, chosen at 1st

level) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a sea hag takes a 4 size penalty

on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sea hag monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sea hags are profi-

cient with all simple weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: A sea hag receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 6th level. After 8th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: A sea hag has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Horrific Appearance (Su): At 2nd level and higher, a sea

hag is so hideous that a creature looking at it must succeed

on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 sea hags HD from class

levels + sea hags Cha modifier) or take the indicated amount

of Strength damage. Creatures that save are not affected

again by that sea hags horrific appearance for one day.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A sea hag of 5th level or higher

has spell resistance equal to 11 + its HD from class levels.

Evil Eye (Su): As many as three times per day, a sea hag of

7th level or higher can gaze at any single creature within 30

feet. The target must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 +

1/2 sea hags HD from class levels + sea hags Cha modifier)

or have a 25% chance of dying instantly. Even a creature that

saves is rendered helpless for three days, although remove

curse or dispel evil can break the effect.

SHADOW

Undead (Incorporeal)

Humanity has always been fascinated by the power of shad-

ows, inventing tales of people who removed their shadows

to gain power and a magical slave, and noting that mystical

creatures such as vampires lack shadows entirely. The

undead shadows are no exception, able to pass through

walls and drain the very strength from a persons limbs.

Spooky and easily capable of creating more creatures like

themselves, shadows are often the earliest exposure adven-

turers have to incorporeal undead because of their rela-

tively low power as adversaries. Shadows are good charac-

ters for players who want a strange, spooky undead creature

without any of the nastiness associated with rotting flesh

and the need to feast on blood, brains, or carrion.

A shadows level adjustment is +7, mainly because shadows

are incorporeal and can create spawn. The power of the class

is gradually improved; at low levels the shadows incorporeal

touch ability deals only a very small amount of Strength

damage, and the creature cannot create spawn. The creature

is able to fly from the very start and eventually gains the abil-

ity to create spawn from its dead victims, giving them many

allies in a fight. A shadows greatest vulnerability is to turn-

ing, since a low-level shadow is no more likely to resist a turn

attempt than a simple skeleton. This weakness somewhat off-

sets the classs powers at low levels, since even a 1st-level

cleric has a 50% chance of turning a 1st-level shadow.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  Str  ,  Con  ,  4

Int, +2 Cha. Shadows arent very smart, but theyre spooky

and  they  know  it.  As  an  incorporeal  creature,  a  shadow

does not have a Strength score. As an undead creature, a

shadow does not have a Constitution score.

Undead: Shadows are immune to mind-affecting effects,

poison,  sleep, paralysis,  stunning,  and  disease.  They  are

not  subject  to  critical  hits,  subdual  damage,  ability

damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.

Incorporeal: Incorporeal creatures can only be harmed by

other incorporeal creatures, by weapons with an enhance-

ment bonus of +1 or higher, or by spells, spell-like effects,

or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagi-

cal  attack  forms.  They  are  not  burned  by  normal  fires,

affected  by  natural  cold,  or  harmed  by  mundane  acids.

Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incor-

poreal  creature  has  a  50%  chance  to  ignore  any  damage

from a corporeal sourceexcept for a force effect, such as

magic  missile, or  damage  dealt  by  a  ghost  touch  weapon.

Incorporeal creatures move in any direction (including up

or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground.

Incorporeal  creatures  can  pass  through  solid  objects  at

will, although they cannot see when their eyes are within

solid matter. The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures

ignore material armor, even magic armor, unless it is made

of force (such as mage armor or bracers of defense) or has the

ghost  touch  special  ability.  Incorporeal  creatures  pass

through  and  operate  in  water  as  easily  as  they  do  in  air.

Incorporeal  creatures  cannot  fall  or  take  falling  damage.

Corporeal  creatures  cannot  trip  or  grapple  incorporeal

creatures. Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not

set off traps that are triggered by weight. Incorporeal crea-

tures do not leave footprints, have no scent, and make no

noise unless they manifest, and even then they only make

noise intentionally. An incorporeal creature has no natural

armor  but  has  a  deflection  bonus  to  AC  equal  to  its

Charisma modifier (or at least +1).

Speed: Shadows fly at a speed of 40 ft. (good).

Darkvision: Shadows can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common.

Favored Class: Shadow. The best multiclassing choice for

a shadow is rogue.

Class Skills

The shadows class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis),

Search (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the shadow mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Shadows are profi-

cient with simple weapons but not with armor or shields.

Feats: A shadow receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 5th level. After 10th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Incorporeal Touch: A shadow has an incorporeal touch

attack that is a natural weapon that deals the indicated

amount of temporary Strength damage.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid reduced to Strength

0 by a shadow of 6th level or higher rises as a shadow of the

same level as the master in 1d4 rounds. Such a spawn is

under the command of the shadow that created it and

remains enslaved until its masters death.

At 6th level, a shadow can control a number of spawn

equal to its HD. This limit goes up to HD  1 1/2 at 8th level

and HD  2 at 10th level. If a shadow creates a spawn that

causes it to exceed this limit, the spawn longest under its

control is released.

STONE GIANT

Giant (Earth)

An enigma among the giants, stone giants are usually neu-

tral, not directly involving themselves in good causes as

storm giants and some cloud giants do, but avoiding the call

of evil that their other kin heed. While some consider them

idiots obsessed with throwing rocks, stone giants are actu-

ally as smart as humans and relatively civilized, preferring

to be left alone and to spend their time devoted to survival

and their own culture. Young stone giants sometimes leave

home on quests to establish status or find an answer to a

great question. Stone giants are good characters for players

who want to play a giant but dont want one with the stigma

of an inherently evil nature.

Stone giants have no strange magical abilities; their level

adjustment of +4 derives from their great Strength and

Constitution, their ability to throw and catch rocks, and

their natural armor. Because the giant has 14 Hit Dice, this

(plus the level adjustment) gives the class a broad range of

levels across which to distribute its ability score modifiers,

natural armor, and rock catching and throwing abilities,

making it easy to present a balanced class at all levels.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +4 Str. Stone giants are

very strong, and they become even stronger as they mature.

Speed: Stone giant land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Stone giants can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Skills: +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in rocky terrain.

Automatic Languages: Common and Giant.

Favored Class: Stone giant. The best multiclassing choices

for a stone giant are barbarian, fighter, and ranger.

Table A45: The Stone Giant

Class Skills

The stone giants class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Profession

(Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a stone giant takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the stone giant

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Stone giants are pro-

ficient with all simple and martial weapons, with light

armor, and with shields.

Feats: A stone giant receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd, 8th, 12th, and 15th level. After 18th level it

gains feats normally according to its character level, as shown

on Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Rock Throwing (Ex): Stone giants have a +1 racial bonus

on attack rolls when throwing rocks. A stone giant can

throw a rock for the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

A rocks maximum range is five range increments.

Rock Catching (Ex): A stone giant can catch Small,

Medium-size, or Large rocks (or similar projectiles). Once

per round, a stone giant that would normally be hit by a rock

can make a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The save

DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium-size one, and 25

for a Large one. (If the projectile has an enhancement bonus

on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The giant

must be ready for and aware of the attack.

SUCCUBUS/INCUBUS (DEMON)

Outsider (Chaotic, Evil)

Succubi  represent  the  erotic,  seductive  aspect  of  evil.  Al-

though their true forms are obviously demonic, they are still

strangely  attractiveand  most  mortals  never  see  the  crea-

tures  true  form,  but  only  its  idealized  humanoid  disguises.

Less  oriented  toward  physical  combat  than  other  demons,

succubi  are  still  powerful  creatures  with  many  abilities  at

their  disposal.  They  make  good  characters  for  players  who

Succubi are powerful creatures, with spell resistance,

energy resistances, nearly a dozen spell-like abilities, good

ability score modifiers, and the ability to converse in any

language and sometimes summon a balor. The energy

resistance starts at a low value and scales up over ten levels.

The spell-like abilities are awarded at approximately the

levels where a sorcerer might acquire their spell equiva-

lents. The ability scores increase over most of the class

levels, but the powerful summon balor ability doesnt appear

until the succubus has fully matured.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +6  Cha.

Succubi are lithe and very charming.

Skills: +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Automatic Languages: Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.

Favored Class: Succubus. The best multiclassing choices

for a succubus are bard, sorcerer, and wizard.

Class Skills

The succubuss class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Disguise

(Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (any 1,

chosen at 1st level) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex),

Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the succubus mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Succubi are profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons but not with

armor or shields.

Feats: A succubus receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 12th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: A succubus has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Telepathy (Su): At 2nd level, a succubus gains telepathy.

It may communicate telepathically with any creature

within 100 feet that has a language.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A succubus has spell resistance

equal to 6 + its HD from class levels.

Alternate Form (Su): At 1st level, the succubus chooses

one alternate humanoid form from Small to Large size. At

higher levels it masters more such forms until it can assume

the appearance of any humanoid of the appropriate size.

Energy Drain (Su): The Fortitude save to remove the

negative level has a DC of 10 + 1/2 succubuss HD from

class levels + succubuss Cha modifier.

Tongues (Su): A succubus can speak with any creature

that has a language. The succubuss caster level for this

effect is its Hit Dice from succubus class levels  2. This

ability is always active unless the succubus chooses to dis-

able it as a free action. The effect can be dispelled, but the

succubus can create it again on its next turn as a free action.

Lesser Succubus Powers (Sp): At 2nd level, a succubus

can use the following spell-like abilities once per day:

clairaudience/clairvoyance, darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect

thoughts, doom, and suggestion. At 4th level it can use them

three times per day, and at 6th level and higher it can use

them at will. A succubuss caster level for all spell-like abili-

ties is equal to its class level.

Succubus Powers (Sp): Beginning at 8th level, a succu-

bus can use unholy blight once per day. In addition, it can use

charm monster, ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects

only), and teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of

objects only) once per day at 8th level, three times per day

at 10th level, and at will when the succubus attains 12th

level. A succubuss caster level for all spell-like abilities is

equal to its class level.

TREANT

Plant

Scattered among the ancient trees of the great forests of the

world are the treants, powerful and wise woodfolk that

guard their homes against invaders and natural catastro-

phes. Tall and strong like mighty oaks, treants have been

known to lead normal trees away from fires and rearrange

trees to confuse greedy woodcutters on forest paths. Treants

are good choices for players who like nature-oriented char-

acters but want something stranger and tougher than usual.

Treants have great physical power, so their level adjust-

ment is +5, for a total ECL of 12. This gives the class plenty

of space to handle the treants two size increases and all of

its ability score modifiers. Although young treants are flex-

ible like saplings and have a Dexterity bonus, over time

they grow so large and their bark becomes so thick and

tough that they have a net Dexterity penalty. However,

their great Strength and Constitution make up for this

unusual progression.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Dex,  +2  Int.

Despite  their  sometimes  provincial  knowledge  of  the

world, treants learn and reason well, and they are often

sought by forest dwellers for their guidance.

Plant:  Treants  are  immune  to  mind-affecting  effects,

poison,  sleep, paralysis,  stunning,  and  polymorphing.

They are not subject to critical hits.

Speed: Treant land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: Treants can see twice as far as a human

in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar  condi-

tions  of  poor  illumination.  They  retain  the  ability  to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skills: +16 racial bonus on Hide checks made in forested

areas.

Automatic Languages: Common, Sylvan, and Treant.

Favored Class: Treant. The best multiclassing choices for

a treant are barbarian, fighter, and ranger.

Class Skills

The treants class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge

(any one, chosen at 1st level) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession

(Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a treant takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

On reaching Huge size, a treant takes a 8 size penalty on

Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the treant monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A treant has no profi-

ciency with weapons, armor, or shields. Treants are nonhu-

manoid for the purpose of determining the cost of armor

according to the Armor for Unusual Creatures sidebar in

Chapter 7 of the Players Handbook.

Feats: A treant receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 4th and 10th level. After 12th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: A treant has a slam attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus Strength bonus.

Fire Vulnerability (Ex): A treant of 6th level or

higher takes double damage from fire attacks unless the

attack allows a save, in which case it takes a 10 penalty

on the save.

Trample (Ex): A treant of 7th level or higher can tram-

ple creatures two or more size categories smaller than

itself for 2d12 points of damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Opponents who do not make attacks of opportunity

against the treant can attempt a Reflex save (DC 20) to

halve the damage.

Double Damage against Objects (Ex): A treant of 7th

level or higher that makes a full attack against an object or

structure deals double damage.

Animate Trees (Sp): A treant of 8th level or higher can ani-

mate trees within 180 feet at will, controlling up to the

indicated number of trees at a time. It takes a full round for

a normal tree to uproot itself. Thereafter it moves at a speed

of 10 feet and fights as an 8th-level treant in all respects.

Animated trees lose their ability to move if the treant that

animated them is incapacitated or moves out of range. The

ability is otherwise similar to liveoak as cast by a 12th-level

druid.

TRITON

Outsider (Water)

Tritons are masters of the water, hailing from that elemen-

tal plane. Although poorly adapted for adventures on land,

tritons are completely at home in the water and are familiar

with combat in their native environment. Tritons are good

choices for players who want a water-adapted character

(particularly for a sea-based campaign) but something with

magic and more humanity than a locathah, merfolk, or

sahuagin.

The triton is a straightforward class, with only natural

armor, ability score modifiers, and a single spell-like ability

contributing to its level adjustment. The summon natures

ally ability is acquired just before a druid might, reflecting

tritons natural affinity for bringing aquatic creatures to

their aid.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Con. Tri-

tons  must  be  strong  and  tough  to  move  and  live  in  the

dangerous seas.

Speed:  Tritons  have  a  swim  speed  of  40  feet.  Tritons

cannot walk on land, but they can drag themselves about

at a land speed of 5 feet (a triton on land cannot run or

charge). Like any creature with a swim speed, tritons can

move  through  the  water  at  that  speed  without  making

Swim  checks,  they  have  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Swim

checks to perform some special action or avoid a hazard,

and can always take 10 when making Swim checks. They

can  use  the  run  action  while  swimming  provided  they

swim in a straight line.

Water  Subtype: Tritons  can  breathe  water  or  air  equally

well.

Darkvision: Tritons can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Common and Aquan.

Favored Class: Triton. The best multiclassing choices for

a triton are cleric, druid, fighter, and wizard.

Class Skills

The tritons class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride

(Dex), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the triton monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Tritons are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: A triton receives one feat at 1st level and another

one at 4th level. After 5th level it gains feats normally

according to its character level, as shown on Table 25:

Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Summon Natures Ally III (Sp): The tritons caster level for

this ability is equal to its class level.

TROLL

Giant

Trolls are big, stupid, and always hungry, driven to acquire

food because of their incredible metabolism that can

regrow entire limbs. Almost as strong as some of the true

giants, trolls are tough foes and ideally suited for long

melee combats, which they almost always win due to attri-

tion. Trolls are good characters for players who want an

exotic melee combatant without too many special abilities

to keep track of.

The trolls level adjustment of +5 is almost as much as its

normal Hit Dice, giving the class plenty of room to spread

out its many advantages. Ability modifiers continue to

increase over time. The natural attacks start out weak but

numerous, eventually becoming a lethal trio. The creatures

scent and reach kick in at mid-levels, with the appearance

and improvement of regeneration being the capstone abili-

ties of the class.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +4 Str, 4 Int, 2 Wis,

4  Cha.  Trolls  are  very  strong  but  are  dumb,  short-

sighted, and thuggish.

Speed: Troll land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Trolls can see in the dark up to 90 feet.

Automatic Languages: Giant.

Favored Class: Troll. The best multiclassing choices for a

troll are barbarian and fighter.

Class Skills

The trolls class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Large size, a troll takes a 4 size penalty on

Hide checks.

pqqrs

SCRAG

Scrags (aquatic trolls) may live in fresh or salt water just about

anywhere. Scrags use all information from the troll class, with

the following changes: They have a swim speed of 20 feet, the

aquatic  subtype  (can  breathe  water  as  well  as  air),  and  they

regenerate only when mostly immersed in water.

All of the following are class features of the troll monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Trolls are proficient

with any simple or martial weapons, but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: A troll receives one feat at 1st level and additional

ones at 4th and 10th level. After 11th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: A troll has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Bite: A troll has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Rend (Ex): A troll that hits with both claw attacks latches

onto the opponents body and automatically tears the flesh,

dealing additional damage equal to two claw attacks plus 1

1/2 times its Strength bonus.

Regeneration (Ex): Trolls take normal damage from fire

and acid. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion

regrows in 3d6 minutes. The creature can reattach the sev-

ered member instantly by holding it to the stump.

TRUMPET ARCHON (CELESTIAL)

Outsider (Good, Lawful)

Chosen (or perhaps created) by the powers of good and law,

trumpet archons are the messengers of the heavens. They

herald the appearance of deities and significant events

related to the powers of good. In times of war, they serve as

leaders in the celestial armies, clearing evil from swaths of

land with their magic and their signature weapon, the

mighty trumpet. Trumpet archons make good choices for

players who want a character with many special abilities,

especially if they dont want to deal with multiclassing

(since the class has a full twenty levels).

As with the astral deva and the ghaele, creating the trum-

pet archons class progression is actually an exercise in

regressing an ECL 20 class all the way back to 1st level. The

factors in the level adjustment are cleric spellcasting ability,

the archons trumpet, spell resistance, ability score modi-

fiers, and natural armor. All but the trumpet ability are easy

to scale, starting weak or not appearing for several levels

until crowning somewhere near the highest levels of the

200

class. The archons trumpet, a special item awarded by

higher powers, is best configured to scale its two different

abilities (as a trumpet and as a greatsword) separately over

the later levels of the class.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Int.

Trumpet archons are powerful and intelligent.

Speed: Trumpet archon land speed is 40 feet.

Darkvision: Trumpet archons can see in the dark up to 60

feet.

Low-Light Vision: Trumpet archons can see twice as far as

a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar

conditions of poor illumination. They retain the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Saves: +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Draconic, Infernal.

Favored Class: Trumpet archon. Because trumpet archons

have an ECL of 20, multiclassing requires the use of epic

level rules (see Epic Level Handbook for more information).

Class Skills

The trumpet archons class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape

Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (any three, chosen at

1st level) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profes-

sion (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the trumpet archon

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Trumpet archons are

proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but with no

armor or shields.

Feats: A trumpet archon receives one feat at 1st level and

additional ones at 3rd, 8th, 14th, and 20th level. After 20th

level it gains feats normally according to its character level

(which requires epic level advancement rules; see Epic Level

Handbook for more information).

Trumpet (Su): At 4th level, the celestial powers award

the archon a mighty trumpet. The archons trumpet pro-

duces music of utter clarity, piercing beauty, and, if the

trumpet archon wills it, paralyzing awe. All creatures

except archons within a certain distance must succeed on a

Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 archons HD from class levels +

archons Cha modifier) or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The

radius of the effect increases from 5 feet at 4th level to 100

feet at 13th level and higher.

An archon can also command its trumpet to become a

magic greatsword with an enhancement bonus ranging

from +1 at 4th level to +4 at 13th level and higher. Changing

the trumpet to or from a greatsword is a free action. The

trumpets properties do not function for anyone other than

the archon to whom it was awarded; in anyone elses hands,

it becomes a_chunk of useless lead.

Spells: Starting at 2nd level, a trumpet archon can cast

spells as a cleric of its Hit Dice from class levels +2. It can

prepare spells from the Air, Destruction, Good, Law, and

War domains as if they were on the cleric spell list, but its

does not have access to any domains or domain spell slots.

Spell-Like Abilities: Starting at 3rd level, a trumpet

archon can use detect evil, continual flame, and message the

indicated number of times per day. The archons caster level

is equal to its Hit Dice from class levels.

Tongues (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a trumpet archon

can speak with any creature that has a language. The trum-

pet archons caster level for this effect is its Hit Dice from

trumpet archon class levels + 2. This ability is always active

unless the trumpet archon chooses to disable it as a free

action. The effect can be dispelled, but the trumpet archon

can create it again on its next turn as a free action.

Aura of Menace (Su): A trumpet archon of 9th level or

higher is surrounded by a 20-foot aura of menace. Hostile

creatures within the area must succeed on a Will save (DC

10 + 1/2 archons HD from class levels + archons Cha modi-

fier) or take a 2 morale penalty on attack rolls, AC, and

saves for one day.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A trumpet archon of 9th level or

higher has spell resistance equal to 9 + its class level.

Teleport without Error (Su): A trumpet archon of 9th

level or higher can use this ability the indicated number of

times per day but can only carry itself and 50 pounds of

weight. The trumpet archons caster level for this effect is its

Hit Dice from trumpet archon class levels + 2.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): This effect continually

surrounds a trumpet archon of 11th level or higher, as the

spell cast by a sorcerer of a level equal to its HD.

UMBER HULK

Aberration

Weird, buglike creatures thought by some to be unintelli-

gent, umber hulks are actually smart as orcs and have their

own language, although most cant understand it or dont

even know that the hulks clicking noises are a manner of

speech. Obviously inhuman, umber hulks stand out in

normal humanoid society, so steps must be taken to prevent

them from causing alarm whenever they are seen. An umber

hulk can be a valuable ally in a campaign where its capabili-

ties are most useful (such as underground areas), as long as

their driving hunger and nearly constant need for destruc-

tion can be assuaged. Umber hulks are good characters for

players who like big bruisers with one strange magical quirk.

An umber hulks two most important special abilities are

its tremorsense ability and its confusing gaze. Initially the

tremorsense is only sensitive enough to let the hulk detect

creatures within claw range, but eventually its senses are

refined enough to let it notice more distant creatures. The

confusing gaze is a more powerful ability that appears at

mid-level, albeit at a short range, and eventually expands in

scope to its full range.

Racial Traits

VROCK (DEMON)

Int. Umber hulks are built much like the stone they tun-

nel throughbig, tough, and dense.

Speed: Umber hulk land speed is 20 feet.

Darkvision: Umber hulks can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Umber Hulk.

Favored  Class:  Umber  hulk.  The  best  multiclassing

choices for an umber hulk are barbarian and fighter.

Class Skills

The umber hulks class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis),

and Profession (Wis).

On reaching Large size, an umber hulk takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the umber hulk

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Umber hulks are pro-

ficient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields.

Feats: An umber hulk receives one feat at 1st level and

additional ones at 3rd and 9th level. After 14th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: An umber hulk has two claw attacks that are nat-

ural weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Bite: An umber hulk has a bite attack that is a natural weap-

on dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Tremorsense (Ex): Starting at 4th level, an umber hulk

can automatically sense the location of anything that is in

conmtact with the ground and within a certain distance

from the umber hulk. The radius of the effect increases

from 10 feet at 4th level to 60 feet at 17th level.

Confusing Gaze (Su): At 7th level, an umber hulk devel-

ops its magical gaze, which causes confusion (as the spell,

caster level 8th) within a certain distance from the hulk

(DC 10 + 1/2 umber hulks HD from class levels + umber

hulks Cha modifier). The radius of the effect increases from

5 feet at 7th level to 30 feet at 13th level and higher.

Outsider (Chaotic, Evil)

A vrock may look like a demonic humanoid vulture, but it

is best to think of it as a bird of prey, swooping over a battle-

field to find a suitable victim, then suddenly diving to rend

and tear at its opponents flesh. Flight, powerful melee

attacks, and significant magical abilities are the key features

of this class. Vrocks are good choices for players who want a

flying character that combines the best abilities of a fighter

and a sorcerer.

A vrocks level adjustment is equal to its Hit Dice, giving

the class many levels in which to place its special abilities.

Key powers are its energy resistances (which scale upward

from low values), spell-like abilities, summoning tanarri,

and its two unique abilities (dance of ruin and stunning

screech). While it seems that the vrock gains a lot of power

at each level, particularly at higher levels, this benefit is

offset by the vrocks lower Hit Dice compared to a fighter of

its level.

Racial Traits

Starting Ability Score Adjustments: +2 Str, +2 Con, +2 Wis.

Vrocks, like most demons, are always on the lookout for

victims and have the power to hold their own in a fight.

Speed: Vrock land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision: Vrocks can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Poison  Immunity:  Vrocks  are  native  to  a  plane  where

poison is omnipresent.

Skills: +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks.

Automatic Languages: Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.

Favored Class: Vrock. The best multiclassing choices for a

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the vrock monster

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Vrocks are proficient

with all simple and martial weapons but not with armor or

shields.

Feats: A vrock receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional ones at 3rd and 11th level. After 16th level it gains

feats normally according to its character level, as shown on

Table 25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Claws: A vrock has two claw attacks that are natural

weapons dealing the indicated damage plus Strength

bonus.

Bite: A vrock has a bite attack that is a natural weapon

dealing the indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Rake: Starting at 4th level, a vrock has two rake attacks

with its lower claws that are natural weapons dealing the

indicated damage plus 1/2 Strength bonus.

Telepathy (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a vrock gains telepa-

thy. It may communicate telepathically with any creature

within 100 feet that has a language.

Lesser Vrock Powers (Sp): Beginning at 2nd level, a

vrock can use the following spell-like abilities the indicated

number of times per day: darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect

magic, and mirror image. Its caster level for all spell-like abil-

ities is equal to its Hit Dice from class levels + 4 (save DC 10

+ spell level + vrocks Cha modifier).

Spores (Ex): Beginning at 6th level, a vrock can release

masses of spores from its body. The spores automatically

deal 1d8 points of damage to all creatures within 5 feet of

the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing

an additional 1d2 points of damage each round for 10

rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a

tangle of viny growths. A delay poison spell stops the spores

growth for its duration. Bless, neutralize poison, or remove dis-

ease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial

of holy water. Initially a vrock can release spores once per

day; at 8th level it can use the attack three times per day;

and at 10th level and higher it can release spores once every

3 rounds.

Vrock Powers (Sp): Beginning at 9th level, a vrock can

use the following spell-like abilities: mass charm, telekinesis,

and teleport without error (self plus 50 pounds of objects

only). Initially a vrock can use these abilities once per day;

at 12th level it can use them three times per day; and at 15th

level and higher it can use them at will.

Summon Tanarri (Sp): Once per day a vrock of 9th level

or higher can attempt to summon dretches (see the Monster

Manual). The number summoned and the chance of success

increase as the vrock advances in level. At 16th level a vrock

can instead attempt to summon another of its kind, with

the indicated chance of success.

Stunning Screech (Su): At 10th level, a vrock gains the

ability to emit a piercing screech. Every creature within 30

feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 vrocks

HD from class levels + vrocks Con modifier) or be stunned

for 1 round. Initially a vrock can use its stunning screech

once per day; at 13th level it can use the ability three times

per day; and at 16th level and higher it can use the ability

once per hour.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A vrock of 11th level or higher

has spell resistance equal to 14 + Hit Dice from class level.

Dance of Ruin (Su): To use this ability, a group of five or

more vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and

chanting. At least one of the vrocks must be 14th level or

higher. If the vrocks dance for 3 rounds, a wave of crackling

avoid  a  hazard,  and  can  always  take  10  when  making

Swim  checks. They  can  use  the  run  action  while  swim-

ming provided they swim in a straight line.

Water Subtype: Water elementals can breathe water or air

WATER ELEMENTAL, LARGE

Elemental (Water)

Like ocean waves, water elementals have the strength to

wear down their opponents and the endurance to do it

slowly if necessary. Best used in aquatic situations (where

they can use their vortex ability and can easily overturn

small watercraft), water elementals are still dangerous

opponents on land, as good at battering creatures into sub-

mission as air elementals are. Water elementals are good

choices for players who want a tough character with an

alien mindset.

A water elementals progress goes through stages where it

matches the abilities of the Small and Medium-size ele-

mental before finally reaching Large size and the abilities

appropriate to its size. Because so many of its abilities are

available to the Small elemental, the water elementals

powers all have scaling effects, dealing more damage or

having a higher DC the more powerful the elemental

becomes. Its most powerful abilities are damage reduction

and an extended reach, both of which are acquired at the

highest levels.

Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:  +2  Str,  +2  Con,  4

Int. Water elementals are strong and resilient, but not too

smart.

Small: As Small creatures, water elementals gain a +1 size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and

a  +4  size  bonus  on  Hide  checks,  but  they  must  use

smaller  weapons  than  Medium-size  creatures  do,  and

their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are  three-quarters  of

those of Medium-size characters.

Speed: Water elemental land speed is 20 feet, swim speed

40  feet.  Like  any  creature  with  a  swim  speed,  water

elementals  can  move  through  the  water  at  that  speed

without  making  Swim  checks,  they  have  a  +8  racial

Table A53: The Water Elemental

equally well.

Darkvision: Water elementals can see in the dark up to

60 feet.

Automatic Languages: Aquan.

Elemental: Water elementals are immune to poison, sleep,

paralysis, and stunning, and they are not subject to criti-

cal hits.

Favored  Class:  Water  elemental. The  best  multiclassing

choices  for  a  water  elemental  are  barbarian,  fighter,

ranger, and rogue.

Class Skills

The water elementals class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis),

and Spot (Wis).

On reaching Medium-size, a water elemental loses its +4

size bonus on Hide checks.

On reaching Large size, a water elemental takes a 4 size

penalty on Hide checks.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the water elemental

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Water elementals are

not proficient with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Feats: A water elemental receives one feat at 1st level and

additional ones at 3rd and 8th level. It gains Power Attack as

a bonus feat at 1st level. After 13th level it gains feats nor-

mally according to its character level, as shown on Table

25: Experience and Level-Dependent Benefits.

Slam: A water elemental has a slam attack that is a natu-

ral weapon dealing the indicated damage plus 1 1/2 times

its Strength bonus.

Water Mastery (Ex): A water elemental gains a +1

bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its oppo-

nent are touching water. If the opponent or elemental is

landbound, the elemental takes a 4 penalty on attack and

damage. A water elemental can overturn small craft (5 feet

of length per HD), stop larger vessels (10 feet of length

per HD), or halve the speed of large ships (20 feet of

length per HD).

Drench (Ex): A water elemental of 2nd level or higher

can extinguish nonmagical flames of Large size or smaller

by merely touching the flames (moving to or through the

flames; no attack roll required).

Vortex: A water elemental can form a vortex as described

in the Monster Manual, except the damage is the elementals

slam damage without Strength bonus and the Reflex save

DC to escape the vortex is 10 + 1/2 water elementals HD

from class levels + water elementals Con modifier.

Appendix 2:

Compiled Tables

The tables in this appendix help you quickly locate the

information you need to build a monster character. Check

the Monster Manual entry for details on your base creature.

Any monster that does not appear in these tables is gener-

ally unsuitable for use as a character. See Chapter 2: Build-

ing Monster Characters for more information.

READING THE TABLES

Table A54: Monsters Compiled by Name and Table A55:

Monsters Compiled by Starting ECL contain the same

information organized in two different ways. If you know

which base creature you want to use, Table A54 enables

you to quickly look up the creatures fundamental statistics.

If you want to create a character with a particular starting

ECL, Table A55 presents all the base creatures organized

by starting ECL from lowest (1) to highest (20).

Supplementing these tables are Table A56: Dragons,

summarizing the statistics for dragons that can be used as

characters, and Table A57: Templates, which covers all the

templates presented in the Monster Manual as well as those

introduced in Chapter 10 of this book.

The categories of information on these tables are defined

below.

Name: The base creatures name.

Type: The type of the creature. Note: Constructs have two

entries; the one marked (a) is for a construct character that

has received the benefit of the awaken construct spell (see

Chapter 6), and the one marked (i) is for a construct charac-

ter to which the incarnate construct template has been

applied.

HD: The number and type of Hit Dice of the base crea-

ture.

Level Adj.: The level adjustment of the base creature.

Information on estimating level adjustments appears in

Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters. (On Table A57:

Templates, subtract 1 from the level adjustment for half-

celestials and half-fiends if the character has no wings.)

Starting ECL: The creatures starting effective character

level, equal to the base creatures number of Hit Dice + its

level adjustment.

Str, Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha: The racial ability score

adjustments for the creature. Do not modify these scores

further for size. @If a score is marked with an asterisk (*),

the base creature has an ability score of lower than 6, and

you must use the base creatures score, rather than rolling

and applying a racial modifier. An entry of (R) here indi-

cates an ability score that you determine randomly (roll

4d6, drop lowest result).

Good Save: Which type or types of saving throw receives

the highest bonus for the base creature.

BAB: The base creatures base attack bonus. Do not

modify this figure further for size.

Fort, Ref, Will: The base, unmodified saving throw

bonuses for the base creature.

Nat. Armor: If the base creature has a natural armor

bonus, it appears here. The creatures Monster Manual entry

provides other factors that may affect the base creature

Armor Class, such as size and Dexterity.

Skill Points: The skill points available to the base crea-

ture, and to your character. See Chapter 2: Building Mon-

ster Characters for rules on purchasing skills.

Feats: The total number of feats the base creature has, not

including bonus feats. You may choose the same feats the

base creature has from its Monster Manual description, or an

equal number of different feats, or some combination

thereof.

Source: Chapter 2: Building Monster Characters is

divided into Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced

monsters. This column shows which section of Chapter 2

contains additional notes for the base creature you choose.

Some templates, defined as New in this column on Table

A57: Templates, are described in Chapter 11 of this book.

Breath Weapon: On Table A56: Dragons, this column

gives the effect or area of a dragons breath weapon (either a

line or a cone), and the type of damage the breath weapon

deals.

Damage (DC): On Table A56: Dragons, this column

gives the amount of damage dealt by a dragons breath

weapon and the DC of the Reflex save for half damage.

Template Name: On Table A57: Templates, the name of

the template as it appears in the Monster Manual or in this

book.

Base Creature HD: Because some templates provide

more, or more powerful, features depending on the base

creatures Hit Dice, this column shows the templates vari-

ous Hit Die levels (if applicable).

Base Creature Size: Some templates provide more, or

more powerful, features depending on the base creatures

size. This column allows the table to show level adjustment

at various size categories.

Template HD Type: If a template changes the Hit Die

type of the base creature, this column shows the new die

type.

Template Creature Type: If a template changes the base

creatures type, this column shows the new creature type.

Appendix 3:

New Creatures

This appendix starts with a description of a variant kind of

creature, the anthropomorphic animal. It also features a new

race, the half-ogre, and descriptions of three creaturesthe

desmodu, the loxo, and the thri-kreenthat originally

appeared in Monster Manual II. They are included here so

that the DM (or a player running one of them as a character)

can take full advantage of the specialized equipment these

creatures use, as described in Chapter 5 of this book.

ANTHROPOMORPHIC

ANIMALS

Anthropomorphic  animals,  sometimes  called  anthro-

pomorphs, are animals with humanoid characteristicsor

perhaps humanoids with animal characteristics. They retain

many of the qualities of the animal on which they are based,

but they are sentient and have a humanoid form. Many anthro-

pomorphic animals of the same kind form unique societies

with their own culture, language, and religion.

Anthropomorphic animals speak the language of their

humanoid forms, as well as any language they have devel-

oped as a people.

animal. An anthropomorphic animal has all the base crea-

tures characteristics except as noted here.

Size  and  Type: The  creatures  type  is  monstrous

humanoid. An anthropomorphic animal is bipedal even if

the base creature is not. It has a tail and/or wings if the base

creature has these features. All anthropomorphic animals

have humanoid arms and hands.

Anthropomorphic animals created from Tiny or smaller

animals are Small, those created from Small to Large ani-

mals are Medium-size, and those created from Huge or

larger animals are Large. This difference in size may affect

Armor Class, attack bonus, natural armor, and abilities; see

the introduction of the Monster Manual for a summary of

these effects.

Hit Dice: A Small anthropomorphic animal has 1 Hit

Die. A Medium-size one has 2 Hit Dice, and a Large one has

3 Hit Dice. Anthropomorphic ani-

mals  use  d8s  for  Hit  Dice.  Only

Small anthropomorphic animals

lose their monster Hit Dice when

they take class levels.

Speed: If  the  base  creature  is  quad-

rupedal and has a land speed faster than

30 feet, the anthropomorpohic

animals land speed de-

creases by 10 feet. Oth-

erwise, its speed re-

mains unchanged.

If the base creature

has wings, the anthropo-

morphic animal can fly. If its

size increased because of the

transformation, its fly speed is

halved and it drops one maneu-

verability category (minimum

poor). If its size decreased because

of the transformation, its fly speed

increases  by  50%  and  it  im-

proves by one maneu-

verability  category

(maximum perfect).

If  the  base  creature  is

aquatic, the anthropomorphic

animal retains its innate swimming ability and water-

breathing characteristics, if any. If an aquatic anthropomor-

phic character is Small, its land speed is 20 feet. Otherwise,

its land speed is 30 feet. If the base creature has a burrow or

brachiation speed, the anthropomorphic animal has this

mode of movement at the same speed.

AC: Adjust for size change, if any.

Attacks: An anthropomorphic animal has the natural

attacks of the base creature, but it can also use weapons if it

did not have hands already. It must still acquire the neces-

sary  proficiency  to  wield  weapons  effectively,  either

through feats or through character classes.

If the size of the base creature changes, the damage for its

natural attacks also changes. See Chapter 5: Equipment for

the effects of size change on weapon damage.

If the base creature has more than two limbs, the anthro-

pomorphic animal has the same number, but two of them

become feet. Thus, an octopus-man, for example, would

have only six natural attacks rather than eight.

An anthropomorphic animal uses the base attack bonus

of a monstrous humanoid: +1 for a Small creature, +2 for

Medium-size, or +3 for a Large creature.

Small anthropomorphic animals with class levels use the

base attack bonus of their class because they lose their

single monster Hit Die.

Special Attacks: Attacks that rely on a nonhumanoid

shape, such as hind-leg rakes, trampling, or a snakes con-

striction, are no longer available.

Special Qualities: An anthropomorphic animal has

darkvision with a 60-foot range.

Base Saves: Base saves are as a monstrous humanoid: +0

Fort, +2 Ref, +2 Will for a Small creature; +0 Fort, +3 Ref, +3

Will for Medium-size, or +1 Fort, +3 Ref, +3 Will

for a Large creature.

Small anthropomorphic ani-

mals with class levels use the

base attack bonus of their

class  because  they  lose

their single monster Hit

Die.

Abilities: Str by size

change,  Dex  by  size

change,  Con  by  size

change, Int becomes 11,

Wis  +2,  Cha  +4.  See Table

A58.

Skills: Same as the base

creature (see Table A58),

except that Small anthropo-

morphic  animals  with  class

levels  use  the  skill  points

granted by their class.

Feats: If the base crea-

ture has Weapon Finesse

as  a  racial  bonus  feat,  the

anthropomorphic animal also

has it if it still has the related attack

form. Otherwise, anthropomorphic ani-

mals gain feats only through class levels.

Challenge Rating: Small: Base creatures CR +1. Medium-

Size: Base creatures CR +1. Large: Base creatures CR 1.

Treasure: Standard.

Alignment: Any.

Advancement: By character class.

Level Adjustment: See Table A58. which contains  the

level adjustments for the anthropomorphic versions of

each animal in the Monster Manual.

ANTHROPOMORPHIC CHARACTERS

Anthropomorphic characters seldom become sorcerers,

since most have a penalty to Charisma. A few may become

wizards. In general, an anthropomorphic race based on

predatory animals uses either barbarian or ranger as a

favored class. An anthropomorphic race based on herbivo-

rous animals uses either cleric or druid as a favored class.

APPENDIX 3

from those who hate or fear his ogre cousins. Most try to be

so tough that others have no choice but to accept them. A

few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as

they can (whether or not such displays are genuine). On the

other hand, they understand the prejudice that half-orcs

experience and generally get along well with them.

Alignment: Half-ogres  inherit  a  tendency

toward chaos from their ogre parents, but, like

their human parents, they favor neither good

nor evil. Half-ogres raised

among ogres and willing

to live out their lives with

them, however, are usually

evil.

Half- Ogre Lands: Half-

ogres have no lands of their

own. They most often live

among ogres. Of the other

races,  humans  are  the

ones  most  likely  to

accept half-ogres, and

half-ogres usually live in

human lands when not

living among ogre tribes.

Religion:  Like  ogres,

many  half-ogres  worship

Vaprak the Destroyer. The

rapacious Vaprak is chaotic

evil. He is a deity of combat,

destruction,  aggression,

frenzy,  and  greed.  The

domains he is associated

with  are  Chaos,  De-

struction,  Evil,  and

War. His favored weapon is

the greatclub. Half-ogre barbarians

and fighters may revere him as a war god

even if they are not evil themselves. Erythnul also numbers

many ogres and half-ogres among his followers. Worshipers

of Vaprak or Erythnul who tire of explaining themselves, or

who dont want to give other races yet another reason to dis-

trust them, simply dont make their religion public knowl-

edge. Half-ogres who want to solidify their connection to

their human heritage follow human deities, and they may be

outspoken in their shows of piety.

Language: Giant, which has no alphabet of its own, uses

Dwarven script on the rare occasions that someone writes

something in Ogre. Ogre writing turns up most frequently

in graffiti.

Names: A half-ogre typically chooses a name that helps

him make the impression that he wants to make. If he wants

to fit in among humans, he chooses a human name. If he

wants to intimidate others, he chooses a guttural ogre name.

A half-ogre raised entirely by humans has a human given

name, but he may choose another name once he is away

from his hometown. Some half-ogres, of course, are not

quite bright enough to choose a name this carefully. Ogre

names are similar enough to orc names that players may

choose from the orc lists (see Half-Orcs in Chapter 2 of the

Players Handbook) when making their characters.

Adventurers: Half-ogres living among humans are

drawn almost invariably toward violent careers

in which they can put their strength to good

use. Frequently shunned from polite com-

pany, half-ogres often find acceptance and

friendship among adventurers, many of

whom are fellow wanderers and outsiders.

Half-Ogre Racial Traits

Starting  Ability  Score  Adjustments:+6  Str,

2 Dex, +2 Con, 2 Int, 2 Cha.

Half-ogres  are  big,  brawny

creatures  without  a  great

deal  of

intelligence  or

couth.

Large: As Large creatures,

half-ogres have a 1 penalty

to  Armor  Class  and  a  1  penalty

on all attack rolls. They also have a

reach of 10 feet.

Speed:  Half-ogre  land  speed

is 30 feet.

Darkvision:  Half-ogres  have

darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

Natural  Armor:  Half-ogres  have  +4

natural armor due to their tough, thick

skin.

Giant  Blood:  For  all  special  abilities

and  effects,  a  half-ogre  is  considered  a

giant. Half-ogres can use giant weapons

and  magic  items  with  racially  specific

giant powers as if they were giants.

Automatic Languages: Giant and

Common.  Bonus  Languages:  Dra-

conic, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc, and Abys-

sal. Smart half-ogres (who are rare) may

know the languages of their allies or rivals.

Favored Class: Barbarian. A multiclass half-ogres barbar-

ian  class  does  not  count  when  determining  whether  he

takes  an  experience  point  penalty  (see  Experience  for

Multiclass  Characters  in  Chapter  3  of  the  Players

Handbook).

Level Adjustment: +1. A half-ogre with one class level is

treated as a 2nd-level character for purposes of awarding

the character experience, for starting equipment, and for

determining how many experience points the character

needs to gain a new level.

Desmodus are massive, batlike

humanoids who live in caverns deep underground. They

are omnivorous and usually not dangerous unless attacked.

Until recently, most sages thought them to be extinct,

wiped out in an ancient war against the drow.

An adult desmodu stands 8 to 9 feet tall. Its body is cov-

ered with reddish-black or reddish-brown fur. The creature

has long arms, short legs, and a head like that of a bat. A

membrane of leathery, black skin stretches from each wrist

to the corresponding ankle. A desmodus hands and feet are

long and narrow, with stubby, curving digits ending in

retractable claws. The fingers and toes, along with the heel

and palms, are equipped with cilia that give the creature a

very sure grip.

A desmodu is bipedal. Normally it walks upright with a

rolling gait, but it can also can get down on all fours and

gallop along at twice its base speed. The typical desmodu

wears armor and a harness for carrying tools and weapons,

but very little else.

Desmodus speak Undercommon and Terran in addition

to a language of their own. This language, called Desmodu,

includes both ultrasonic and subsonic utterances, so non-

desmodus cannot speak it. Desmodus have deep, rich

voices, though their speech includes the occasional sharp

squeak or bass rumble when they are using a language other

than their native tongue.

Combat

Desmodus use their sonic abilities to give themselves bo-

nuses and their foes penalties. Their favorite melee weapon

is  the  notbora,  an  exotic  double

weapon of their own invention.

These creatures often rush into melee

on all fours, using smokesticks to blind

foes. They follow up by using the Quick

Draw  feat  to  draw  their  notboras

and  attack  as  they  stand  up.

Desmodus  also  are  fond

of dropping down on op-

ponents  from  the  ceil-

ing of a cavern, and

they  make  full

use  of  their  su-

perior  reach  in

melee.  Once  bat-

tle  is  joined,

they jump and

tumble  to  by-

pass  the  foes

front line and at-

tack opposing spell-

casters  or  set  up

flanking attacks.

Screech (Su):

Once per day, a des-

modu can produce a

screech that

can  literally

tear items apart. The

creature can choose one

of two effects.

Ray: A ray deals 5d6 points of sonic damage

to any creature or object it strikes. This attack has a range of

30 feet.

Spread: A sonic concussion causes every creature (except

other desmodus) within a 30-foot spread centered on the

desmodu to be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Forti-

tude save (DC 20) negates the effect.

Sonic Abilities (Su): At will, a desmodu can emit subsonic

vibrations, choosing one of two effects. It takes a standard

action to invoke an effect or to concentrate to maintain it.

Despair: Each foe in a 30-foot spread centered on the des-

modu takes a 2 morale penalty on saving throws, attack

rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls

for as long as the desmodu concentrates and for 1d4 rounds

thereafter. A successful Will save (DC 16) negates this

sonic, mind-affecting effect.

Hope: Every ally in a 30-foot spread centered on the des-

modu gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack

rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls

for as long as the desmodu concentrates and for 1d4 rounds

thereafter.

Wounding (Ex): A desmodus saliva contains an antico-

agulant that causes bite wounds the creature inflicts to

bleed freely. A wound resulting from a desmodus bite

attack bleeds for an additional 1 point of damage per round

thereafter. Multiple wounds from such attacks result in

cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of

damage per round, and so on). The bleeding stops on its

own after 1 minute. Alternatively, it can be stopped by a

successful Heal check (DC 15) or the application of a cure

spell or some other healing spell (heal, healing circle, or

the like).

Blindsight (Ex): A desmodu emits high-frequency

sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that bounce off

nearby objects and creatures. This ability enables it to dis-

cern objects and creatures within 120 feet. The desmodu

usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to

notice creatures within range of its blindsight. A silence

spell negates this ability and forces the desmodu to rely on

its vision (which is as good as a humans).

Gallop (Ex): A desmodu can get down on all fours and

gallop along like an ape at a speed of 40 feet, provided that

its hands are free.

Speak with Bats (Sp): This ability functions like a speak

with animals spell (caster level 1st), except that it only

works on bats and is usable at will.

Skills: A desmodu receives a +4 racial bonus on Spot

and  Listen  checks,  which  is  lost  if  its  blindsight  is

negated. The creature also gets a +2 racial bonus on grap-

ple checks. When wearing light armor or no armor, the

creature gains a +2 bonus on Balance and Jump checks. All

these racial bonuses are included in the statistics above.

When a desmodu has its hands free and deliberately

jumps down from a height, subtract 10 feet from the dis-

tance fallen to determine damage. If it makes a successful

Jump check (DC 15), reduce the effective distance fallen

by another 10 feet.

Desmodu Society

Desmodus live in small, independent family groups that

gather in loosely organized colonies or enclaves to pool

resources and create a communal defense. They eschew

complex social organizations, and individual families live as

they please. Each family group includes several genera-

tions, with the eldest generation acting as the ruling body

to settle all issues.

The  oldest  and  most  experienced  desmodus  in  an

enclave form a council to settle disputes between families

and make recommendations about handling external

affairs. Desmodus of the same age from different families

frequently adopt each other as siblings. These adopted sib-

lings are called age-mates, and they always refer to each

other as though they were blood kin. The extended family

ties that desmodus form in this manner can be both varied

and complex, and they are usually not clear to anyone

except other desmodus.

Desmodus live in large caverns festooned with stalactites

and stalagmites. They tunnel into the ceilings to create

living spaces, keeping the entrances concealed among the

stalactites. They use the cavern floor to grow fungi, herd

lizards, and conduct any other activities that might be diffi-

cult to perform on the ceiling. Desmodus breed a variety of

bats to serve as steeds and guardians.

A desmodu settlement includes noncombatants (mostly

children) equal to 20% of the fighting population. The soci-

ety is egalitarian, so both males and females can be found

filling almost every role.

Desmodus enjoy a simple lifestyle. They understand the

value of weapons and tools, but they keep neither money

nor valuables. They conduct trade through barter, and the

only distinction they recognize as a status symbol is the

number of bats and lizards a family owns.

Breeding, keeping, and training bats is a favorite activity

among the desmodus. They consider it a mark of distinc-

tion to breed a new and useful type of bat, and thus count-

less varieties of bats exist within desmodu caverns.

Desmodu artisans produce a wide variety of ingenious

and high-quality goods. Some of these devices that may be

of interest to adventurers are described in the Desmodu

Items section, below. These creatures also produce all

manner of mundane items, including toys, household

goods, and musical instruments. All desmodus appreciate

good music and items that can produce or enhance sound.

Their own music, however, is mostly inaudible to others

because of its ultrasonic and subsonic components.

The chief desmodu deity is Vesperian, who is the creator

and protector of the race. Typically there is a shrine dedi-

cated to him in every enclave, and many dwellings also

boast private altars to Vesperian.

Desmodu Characters

Desmodus sometimes become barbarians or rogues, but

their favored class is fighter. A desmodu fighter usually

leads a colonys council of elders, and fighters also lead

most warbands, in those rare cases when the desmodus join

to  attack  a  common  enemy.  Wizards  and  clerics  are

unknown in the race. Some desmodu sorcerers and bards

exist, but most desmodu spellcasters are adepts.

KINSHIP BADGES

This  item  resembles  an  exquisite  cymbal  or  flattened  bell,

measuring 3 or 4 inches across. When struck, it emits a single

musical note. It also resonates and produces a distinctive ultra-

sonic  tone  when  a  desmodus  echolocation  sounds  strike  it.

Desmodus usually exchange kinship badges with their siblings

and use them to identify each other in battle.

Loxos  are  usually  peace-

ful  creatures,  but  they

defend  their  territories

and  families  with  great

tenacity.  They  are  among

the  most  danger-

ous  of  all  desert

dwellers to those

who incur their

wrath.

A  loxo  ap-

pears  to  be  a

humanoid elephant.

Its  skin  is  bluish-gray,

wrinkled, and covered with rough, sparse hair. It has thick,

round limbs, flat feet, short, stubby fingers, and large ears.

Its most striking feature is the pair of trunks that grow from

its  face,  framed  by  large  tusks.  Each  trunk  is  about  2  feet

long and has three fingerlike digits at the end. The typical

loxo  prefers  simple,  rustic  clothing,  particularly  cut  from

cloth patterned with circles or diamonds.

Loxos speak their own language and Common.

toward the females, so that they too can join the melee.

Berserk Rage (Ex): A loxo that sees a clan member killed

or incapacitated enters a berserk rage. For 6 rounds, the loxo

gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and

a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a 2 penalty to

Armor Class. The following changes are in effect as long as

the berserk rage lasts: HD 5d10+15 (37 hp); AC 12, touch 8,

flat-footed  11;  Atk  +10  melee  (2d8+9,  Huge  morningstar)

and +5 melee (2d6+3, 2 slams), or +10 melee (1d6+6, 2 slams),

or +5 melee (1d8+6, Large javelin); SA trample 1d8+9 (DC

18); SV Fort +4, Ref +5, Will +6; Str 23, Con 17; Climb +8.

After the berserk rage ends, the loxo is fatigued (2 penalty

to Strength, 2 penalty to Constitution, cant charge or run)

until the end of the encounter.

Trample (Ex): As a standard ac-

tion during its turn each

round, a loxo can trample

Medium-size or smaller

opponents. This attack

deals 1d8+6 points of

bludgeoning damage. A

trampled opponent can

attempt either an

attack of opportuni-

ty at a 4 penalty or

a Reflex save (DC 16)

for half damage.

Loxo Society

Loxo  herds  are

seminomadic. They

move about, grazing

and  harvesting  fruits

and nuts from groves of

trees  they  have  planted.

When  they  reach  a

grove or a good area

for grazing, they

build  tempo-

rary  huts  to

serve as shel-

ter until its time

to move on. Loxos

need massive amounts of

grass and other vegetable material to fuel their big bodies.

When not eating, these creatures create rustic works of art,

which they barter for items or tools they need.

Loxo herds are divided into clans, and all members of a

clan  wear  the  same  pattern  of  clothing.  Each  herd  has  a

chief  (called  a  lox-fithik,  or  herd-lieutenant),  who  is  a

ranger, and a tunnuk, who has at least two levels of wizard.

Combat

Loxos prefer melee to ranged combat, and they use thrown

weapons only when they cant close with enemies. If a herd

is threatened, the adult male loxos charge intruders while

the females move the young to a defensible location. Once

the young are secure, the males make a fighting retreat

Loxo Characters

A loxos preferred character class is ranger. Loxo rangers

choose favored enemies from among the most common

threats to their territories and habitats.

A loxo PCs effective character level (ECL) is equal to its

class level + 7; thus, a 1st-level loxo ranger has an ECL of 8

and is the equivalent of an 8th-level character.

Thri-kreen, often called mantis warriors,

are  intelligent  humanoids  with  in-

sectlike  features.  They  prefer

deserts and savannas, where they

maintain  a  nomadic  lifestyle  as

hunters.

A  thri-kreen  looks  like  a

bipedal praying mantis. Of the six limbs

protruding from its midsection, two are

used for walking, and each of the

other four ends in a four-fingered

hand.  A  sandy  yellow  exo-

skeleton covers an adult thri-

kreens body. Two compound

eyes, two antennae, and a com-

plicated jaw structure that

includes a pair of wicked

mandibles  give  its  head  an

insectlike appearance. The typical thri-kreen wears a har-

ness, belt, and slings for holding its equipment, but no

clothing or armor.

Thri-kreen are at home in arid, open landscapes where

they can easily blend in with the windblown dunes and bare

rock. Permanent thri-kreen communities are almost nonex-

istent; instead, packs of thri-kreen range widely over their

own territories, foraging and hunting for daily sustenance.

On rare occasions, two or more packs may come together to

join their strength against especially dangerous intruders.

Thri-kreen speak a language made up of clicks and snaps

of their mandibles. Most thri-kreen whose packs roam near

humanoid civilizations also speak Common.

While hunting, thri-kreen use their natural camouflage to

sneak up on potential prey. Because of their speed and leaping

ability, thri-kreen can close to combat (and flee from it) more

quickly than most of their foes. They can use the gythka and

chatkcha (exotic weapons that are unique to mantis warriors),

but they prefer to attack with claws and poisoned bites.

Poison (Ex): A thri-kreen delivers its poison (Fortitude

save DC 11) with a successful bite attack. The initial and sec-

ondary damage is the same (paralysis for 2d6 minutes). A

thri-kreen produces enough poison for one bite per day.

Psionics (Sp): *When using the Psionics Handbook, apply

the following psionic abilities to a thri-kreen. At will

chameleon, know direction; 1/daydisplacement, lesser metaphys-

ical weapon. Manifester level 10th; save DC 8 + power level.

Attack/Defense Modes: ego whip, mind thrust/thought

shield, empty mind. A thri-kreen manifests powers, and gains

additional attack and defense modes, as if it were a psychic

warrior or a psion with Psychometabolism as its primary

discipline. (A psionic thri-kreen characters favored class is

psychic warrior, though a few choose monk or psion

with the primary discipline of Psychometabolism.) The

level adjustment of a thri-kreen with psionics becomes +3.

Immunity to Sleep (Ex): Since thri-kreen do not sleep,

they are immune to magic sleep effects. A thri-kreen spell-

caster still requires 8 hours of rest before preparing spells.

Leap (Ex): A thri-kreen is a natural jumper. It gains a +30

competence bonus on all Jump checks, and its maximum

jumping distance is not limited by height.

Skills: *The exoskeleton of a thri-kreen blends in well

with desert terrain, granting it a +4 racial bonus on

Hide checks in sandy or arid settings.

Weapon Familiarity: Thri-kreens treat gythka

and chatkcha (see Chapter 5: Equipment) as martial

weapons rather than as exotic weapons. Gythka and

chatkcha are far more common among thri-kreen

than among other races.

Thri-Kreen Characters

A thri-kreen characters favored class is ranger, but a

few prefer the path of the cleric (generally as

clerics of Ehlonna, Fharlanghn, or Obad-Hai)

or druid. A thri-kreen character begins play

with Hit Dice 2d8, which gives it a +2 base

attack bonus; base saves Fort +0, Ref +3,

Will +3; Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat; one additional

feat of choice; and skill points equal to (2 + Int mod)  5. Its

class skills as a thri-kreen are Balance, Climb, Hide, Jump,

Listen, and Spot. Many thri-kreen also qualify for the mon-

strous feats Multiattack, Multidexterity, and Multiweapon

Fighting and choose these in preference over other feats.

A nonpsionic thri-kreen PCs effective character level

(ECL) is equal to its class level + 3. Thus, a 1st-level non-

psionic thri-kreen ranger has an ECL of 4 and is the equiva-

lent of a 4th-level character.

A psionic thri-kreen PCs effective character level (ECL)

is equal to its class level +5. Thus, a 1st-level psionic thri-

kreen ranger has an ECL of 6 and is the equivalent of a 6th-

level character.

New Character Races

for Savage Species

A Savage Species Web Enhancement

The Savage Species book offers new templates, prestige

classes, spells, and feats. In addition, it contains a wealth

of information about how to build and advance monster

characters, and even how to transform a standard-race

character into a monster character. As if that werent

enough to make it cool, it even presents entirely new

player character racesanthropomorphic animals and

half-ogres. But those races have level adjustments and

starting Effective Character Levels (ECLs), so they arent

appropriate for creating 1st-level characters.

This web enhancement presents two new character

races, one of which has a +0 level adjustment, so it can

be used to build a 1st-level character. The notes about

how these races were built provides a great demonstra-

tion of how to evaluate and tinker with level adjust-

ments. That information will prove invaluable when

you design new races for your own campaign.

PREPARATION

To understand the notes on level adjustments, you need a

copy of Savage Species. Copies of the Monster Manual and

the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide are helpful, but not necessary.

CANINE

I love dogs, so lets try to create a humanoid wolf or

dog. We already know that we want a +0 level adjust-

ment, so that the race will be usable for making a 1st-

level character. From Savage Species, we know that avoid-

ing a level adjustment means:

Balanced ability scores. Refer to Table 27: Ability

Score Equivalencies from the DUNGEON MASTERS Guide

to determine what constitutes balanced ability scores.

Medium-size. If some other ability gives a +1 level

adjustment, however, it can be cancelled out by

making the race Small.

Speed 30 feet. The creature can have no special

mode of movement.

Natural weapons (and manufactured weapons, if

desired). Since our new race is canine, it should

have a bite attack, but it cannot have a multiple nat-

ural attack routine, and its bite must do damage less

than or equal to that of a comparable melee weapon.

Reach 5 feet.

Up to two racial skill bonuses

Up to one racial bonus feat.

A special attack or special quality is almost always

worth at least a +1 level adjustment, so we should try to

avoid giving our new race any of those. That seems a

shame, though, because those abilities are what make a

race special. Dwarves and gnomes both get saving

throw bonuses and abilities such as stonecunning that

are, essentially, special qualities. Perhaps reviewing

those races might spark an idea that would make our

race unique without imposing a level adjustment.

1

So far, weve decided on a humanoid with canine

features, probably Medium-size, with balanced ability

scores and a bite attack. We could easily envision mem-

bers of this race as hunters, perhaps nomadic, who

spend much of their time in the wilderness. They must

be tough, hardy creatures, and their equipment should

be useful to hunters.

Next, lets move on to creating a statistics block in

the Monster Manual style.

LAIKA

Laika was the first dog to orbit the Earth, and her name

meant barker in Russian. It seems an appropriate

name for our new race.

We can just fill in the information weve already

decided on in the appropriate spots in our stat block,

modifying them for ability scores and other factors as

needed. Where a new decision must be made, Ill lay

out the available options and then explain my selection.

Medium-Size Humanoid

Hit Dice: 1d8+1 (5 hp)

Humanoids use d8 Hit Dice, so thats already settled. I

want a laika to have a single racial Hit Die, so that it can

choose to trade that in for a class level, thus gaining all

the same benefits that a character would get at 1st level.

Initiative: +0

Speed: 30 ft.

AC: 12 (+2 leather armor, +0 Dexterity)

I assigned typical equipment to laikas, then deter-

mined their AC from that and their Dexterity. I chose

leather armor because it has no armor proficiency

penalty,  and  no  hunter  wants  a  penalty  on  Move

Silently checks.

Attacks: Bite +0 melee, or short sword +0 melee, or

composite longbow +0 ranged

Damage: Bite 1d4, shortsword 1d6/1920, composite

longbow 1d8/x3

A humanoid has the same base attack bonus pro-

gression as a cleric, so a 1-HD humanoid has a +0 BAB.

The laikas bite damage is standard for a Medium-size

humanoid, and its weapons are those of a hunter.

Face/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.

Special Qualities: Laika traits

As much as I would love to give laikas the scent special

quality, doing so would mean that a 1st-level laika charac-

ter could detect and possibly pinpoint invisible creatures.

Such an advantage would certainly be worth a level adjust-

ment. I could go back and change the races size to Small,

but even a normal wolf is Medium-size, and a Small dog-

like humanoid seems sillier than I had in mind. See Laika

Traits, below, for what I do want to give them.

Saves: Fort +3, Ref +0, Will +0

Humanoids get one good save. Usually thats Reflex,

but we want laikas to be particularly tough and hardy,

so I made Fortitude the good save and applied the Con-

stitution bonus to its hit points.

Abilities: Str 10, Dex 11, Con 13, Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 10

These scores give the laika ability adjustments of +2

Con and 2 Int. I think the bonus to Constitution is

particularly powerful for a player character race. Every

time a laika gains a class level, it benefits from the

higher Constitution. However, the benefit isnt not as

powerful as a Strength bonus, so Ill penalize only one

other ability score. I could reduce Dexterity to balance

the bonus, but a hunting creature would surely want

the ability to use ranged weapons without penalty. I

could also penalize Charisma, but then I would be

duplicating the dwarf racial ability modifiers. There-

fore, I chose to penalize Intelligence.

Skills: Knowledge (nature) +2, Listen* +4, Spot +2,

Wilderness Lore* +3

As a humanoid with an Intelligence score of 8, the

laika is entitled to 4 skill points. First I chose the class

skills that I figured were appropriate for the laikathe

four given above. Then I spent its skill points, purchas-

ing 3 ranks of Knowledge (nature) and 1 of Wilderness

Lore. Because its canine in nature, I also assigned it a

+2 racial bonus (see below) on Listen and Wilderness

Lore checks. I already plan on giving it Alertness as its

first feat, so the bonuses on Listen and Spot checks are

included here as well.

Feats: Alertness, Track (B).

A laika is entitled to one feat, and I chose Alertness. I

also gave it Track as a bonus feat, since its a hunting race.

The rest of the stat block is meaningless for char-

acters, but Ive included it here for the sake of com-

pleteness. To create this section, I copied the infor-

mation from the wolf entry in the Monster Manual

but improved the treasure to Standard (reasonable

for a humanoid) and set the advancement to By

character class.

Climate/Terrain: Any forest, hills, plains, and moun-

tains

Organization: Solitary, pair, or pack (716)

Challenge Rating: 1

Treasure: Standard

Alignment: Any neutral

Advancement: By character class

Laikas are explorers, adventurers, and hunters. Laika

packs claim territories without regard for conventional

political borders, and they roam throughout their lands

in search of game. Although laika bards are uncom-

mon, ordinary laikas love to sing together as a pack

after their evening meal.

determining whether it takes an XP penalty (see XP for

Multiclass Characters in Chapter 3: Classes in the

Players Handbook).

A laika is the same height and weight as a human,

and it ages approximately as fast as a half-orc. Its body is

covered with silver, white, black, brown, or reddish fur,

and its eyes are blue, yellow, or brown. A laika has a pro-

nounced muzzle, triangular ears set high on its head,

and a fur-covered tail.

Laikas are very gregarious among their own kind,

but they tend to be aloof when dealing with other

races. Once a creature earns the trust of a laika pack,

however, it can be informally adopted by the pack and

treated as family.

Laikas generally speak Common. Those with high

enough Intelligence scores learn the languages of

friends or foes in their territories.

Combat

Laikas prefer to attack in numbers and use cunning tac-

tics. Often a few laikas distract their enemies with bow-

fire while others slip into ambush positions. Laikas

regard biting as uncivilized, so they use their impres-

sive teeth only in ritual combat for pack hierarchy, or

when no other weapon is available. A solitary laika usu-

ally attempts to escape confrontation unless its oppo-

nent is clearly outmatched.

Laika Traits (Ex): Laikas benefit from a number of

racial traits.

Balanced Ability Scores: A laika gains a +2 bonus to

Constitution and a 2 penalty to Intelligence.

Medium-Size: A laika gains no size bonus to Armor

Class, attack rolls, or skill checks.

Base Speed: 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: A laika can see twice as far as a

human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar

conditions of poor illumination. It retains the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Speak with Animals (Sp): Once per day, a laika can

use speak with animals to communicate with canine ani-

mals such as wolves and dogs. This ability is innate to

laikas. It has a duration of 1 minute (the laika is consid-

ered a 1st-level caster when it uses this ability, regard-

less of its actual level).

Skills and Feats: *A laika gains a +2 racial bonus on

Listen and Wilderness Lore checks, and it receives

Track as a bonus feat.

Automatic Languages: A laika speaks Common.

Bonus Languages: Dwarf, Elf, Giant, Gnome, Goblin,

Halfling, Kobold, and Orc.

Favored Class: A laikas favored class is ranger. A mul-

ticlass  laikas  ranger  class  does  not  count  when

Laika Characters

A laikas level adjustment is +0. Build laika characters

just as you would using any standard race from the

Players Handbook.

EVALUATION

Evaluating the level adjustment for laikas is pretty easy.

As a fighter, a laika gets Track as a racial bonus feat and

two more class skills (Knowledge (nature) and Wilder-

ness Lore), but its low Intelligence score combined

with a fighters low skill points balance that out. As a

ranger, the laika already has those skills as class skills

and the Track feat is redundant. Many laikas probably

take levels in rogue, gaining that classs high skill

points and using several of the rogues class skills

(Climb, Hide, Move Silently) to hunt. In short, the

laika doesnt seem particularly better or worse than the

standard races in the Players Handbook, just different.

That arrangement was our goal when we set out to

create a 1-HD race with a +0 level adjustment.

BUGS

Now lets build a race with a moderate level adjustment.

We want the starting ECL to be roughly 4, so that a

member of the race with one class level is equivalent to

a 5th-level character. Thus, well have to balance start-

ing Hit Dice and level adjustments to reach that point.

Most people are either fascinated or repelled by

insects, so an insectlike humanoid seems like an excit-

ing vision for this race. It seems reasonable that the

creature would have an insect carapace (and thus a nat-

ural armor bonus), and perhaps a flying speed. A natu-

ral armor bonus of up to +5 is worth a +1 level adjust-

ment  according  to  Savage  Species.  Flight  with  a

maneuverability of average or worse also merits a +1

level adjustment. If we stick to these aspects, keep the

ability scores balanced, and look for some small, clever

qualities to assign, then this race could start with 2 Hit

Dice. If we make the race Small, we can increase the

Hit Dice, improve one of the two existing aspects, or

unbalance the ability scores. After evaluating these pos-

sibilities, I decided to give the creature a poison that

affects Dexterity (for a +1 level adjustment).

After assigning these qualities, I came to picture this

race as being something like a spider eater or carnivo-

rous hornet. Quick and agile, it prefers to strike quietly

from above with its stinger and then withdraw to finish

3

its now-clumsy opponent with ranged attacks. Being

able to visualize the creature and its tactics helps me

with the other decisions I have to make while creating

the stat block.

After performing the Evaluation (see below), I

changed the imago slightly from the description above.

If you notice a difference in the stat block, see the Eval-

uation for why that change was made.

IMAGO

Small Humanoid

Hit Dice: 3d8 (13 hp)

Initiative: +5

Speed: 30 ft., fly 40 ft. (average)

AC: 17 (+1 size, +1 Dexterity, +5 natural)

Attacks: Sting +3 melee, or claw +3 melee, or short-

sword +3 melee, or composite shortbow +4 ranged

Damage: Sting 1d4 plus poison, claw 1d4, shortsword

1d6/1920, composite shortbow 1d6/x3

Face/Reach: 5 ft. by 5 ft./5 ft.

Special Attacks: Poison

Special Qualities: Imago traits

Saves: Fort +1, Ref +4, Will +2

Abilities: Str 11, Dex 13, Con 10, Int 9, Wis 12, Cha 8

I know I want the imago to have a high Dexterity

score. According to the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide, I

could penalize Strength, Constitution, or some combi-

nation of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma to bal-

ance that bonus. A flying creature already has a limit on

how much encumbrance it can carry while airborne, so

I dont want to penalize Strength. Wisdom controls per-

ception through modifiers on Listen and Spot checks,

so I dont want to penalize Wisdom. So I opted to penal-

ize Intelligence and Charisma.

Skills: Hide +8, Listen +3, Move Silently* +8, Spot +3

My vision of the imago as a stalker and a stealthy

hunter not only means it needs a high Dexterity score,

but also that it has some ranks in Hide and Move

Silently. Since it doesnt have many skill points to

spend on those skills, I also decided to give the imago a

+4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks.

Feats: Alertness (B), Improved Initiative

I assigned Alertness as a racial bonus feat because I

feel strongly that all imago characters should have it.

Climate/Terrain: Temperate  and  warm  land  and

underground

Organization: Solitary, pair, swarm (35), or hive

(1120)

Challenge Rating: 3

Treasure: Standard

4

Alignment: Any

Advancement: By character class

Imago  are  industrious,  no-nonsense  creatures.

Many races find them brusque or out-right rude, but

the imago are simply too focused on their current tasks

to pay much attention to social niceties. That very focus

on work makes them prized laborers in many parts of

the world. Imago encountered outside their hivelike

villages are often working on contracts in order to

bring money back to their homes. On the rare religious

or political holidays when they do relax, imago enjoy

drinking mead and singing. Bards are always welcome

in imago hives.

Imago speak their own language, which is called

Imago. To most outsiders, it sounds like the drone of a

hornet, amplified to suit the imagos proportionately

larger size. An imago that deals with other races learns

the  corresponding  languages  if  it  possess  a  high

enough Intelligence score.

Combat

Imago usually attack on the wing, swooping down on

opponents and stinging them. They then fly off, pep-

pering their foes with arrows while their poison takes

effect. Imago do not retreat, but they may withdraw

from combat long enough to gather reinforcements.

Poison: An imago delivers its poison (Fortitude save

DC 11; Constitution-based) with each successful sting

attack. The initial and secondary damage ratings are the

same (1d6 points of Dexterity damage).

Imago Traits (Ex): Imago benefit from a number of

racial traits.

Balanced Ability Scores: An imago has a +2 bonus to

Dexterity, a 2 penalty to Intelligence, and a 2 penalty

to Charisma.

Small: As a Small creature, an imago gains a +1 size

bonus to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls,

and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. However, it must

use smaller weapons than humans use, and its lifting

and  carrying  limits  are  three-quarters  those  of

Medium-size characters. Imago cannot fly when carry-

ing more than a light load.

Skills and Feats: *An imago gains a +4 racial bonus on

Move Silently checks, and it receives Alertness as a

bonus feat.

Automatic Languages: Imago.

Bonus  Languages: Common,  Dwarf,  Elf,  Giant,

Gnome, Goblin, Halfling, Orc.

Favored Class: An imagos favored class is rogue. A

multiclass imagos rogue class does not count when

determining whether it takes an XP penalty (see XP for

Multiclass Characters in Chapter 3: Characters in the

Players Handbook).

Imago Characters

An imago has a +2 level adjustment. Thus, an imago

characters Effective Character Level (ECL) equals its

starting Hit Dice (2) plus its level adjustment (2) plus

its class levels.

EVALUATION

The imagos initial level adjustment was calculated as

follows:

+1 for natural armor bonus

+1 for flight with maneuverability worse than good

+1 for poison that doesnt reduce Constitution

1 for size Small

+2

Thus, an imago character with no class levels, copied

directly from the stat block, should be equivalent to a

4th-level character. I opened up my DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide to Chapter 2: Characters and found Table 241:

NPC Rogue to make comparisons. I built the following

table for comparison.

Even assuming that an imago character would have

equipment equivalent to that of any other 4th-level

character, it seemed clearly inferior in most ways to a

standard-race character of that level. The following

options for bringing it into balance occurred to me.

Raise  its  Hit  Dice.  One  more  Hit  Die  would

improve its BAB and its non-good saving throws, in

addition to increasing its hit points. Because of

rounding, the poisons Fortitude save DC would be



unaffected. That additional Hit Die would also pro-

vide another skill point, but it would not provide

another feat.

Increase the racial bonus to Dexterity. This option

would improve the creatures ranged attack rolls and

Reflex save. If I made Weapon Finesse (stinger) its

racial  bonus  feat,  that  attack  roll  would  also

improve.

Add other ability bonuses, or remove the penalty

to Intelligence or Charisma. A bonus to Strength

would improve melee attacks, a bonus to Consti-

tution would improve hit points, Fortitude save,

and the poisons Fortitude save DC. A bonus to

Intelligence would increase skill points, and a

bonus to Wisdom would increase the Will saving

throw bonus and the racial bonuses on Listen

and Spot.

In the end I decided on a combination of increasing

the  Hit  Dice  and  adding  a  +2  racial  bonus  to

Wisdom.  The  resulting  comparison  was  close

enough to be worth the +2 level adjustment and the

starting ECL of 4.



SUMMARY

I hope you enjoy including laikas and imago in your

campaign. I also hope this treatment clarified the

process  of  creating  a  new  player  character  race.

While it is fairly simple, keep in mind the following

points.

A player should never create a player character race

without the DMs permission at the beginning and

his or her critical review at the end. In general, only

DMs should create new races.

Its much easier to balance races with low or nonexist-

ent level adjustments than it is to do so with higher

ones. The greater the level adjustment or starting

ECL, the more arguments there are over what the

level adjustment and starting ECL should be.



Always compare your race with others in the game,

and with NPCs whose level matches your races

starting ECL. The NPC tables in Chapter 2: Charac-

ters of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide are extremely

useful for this.

Creating a player character race is only the beginning.

Once you have the race, you should decide whether it

has a patron deity, what its society is like, and whether

it uses any race-specific equipment. You may also want

to provide some background information or even

create a prestige class peculiar to that race, such as the

arcane archer and the dwarven defender.
