The conict between good and evil has occurred

throughout Torils history and continues to

permeate the day-to-day lives of its peoplebut

neither good nor evil ever manages to get the upper hand

for long.

These archetypes tantalize and terrorize: reavers, criminals,

miscreants, antiheroes, pirates, murderers, cultists, seducers,

servants of dark gods, villains, and archvillains. Evil compels.

Whether its attractive and seductive or depraved and disgusting,

evil stimulates our imaginations and evokes strong responses.

What are heroes without great threatsand what if you are

one of these threats? What grand schemes can you prepare and

evil designs can you execute if youre not hampered by good ideals?

Champions of Ruin offers many opportunities for both players

and Dungeon Masters interested in exploring the darker side of

Faern.

How to Use This Book

in Your Campaign

Champions of Ruin provides players and Dungeon Masters

ideas, options, and tools for incorporating evil into a campaign.

It provides new evil races, feats, and magic items. Initiate feats

lend avor to evil divine spellcasters. Supremely evil, powerful

villains give the DM a gallery of new foes, patrons, or friends

for the player characters. The book as a whole offers a wealth of

material for expanding the role of evil in a Forgotten Realms

campaign. Alternatively, much of the book can be used with

minor adjustments in any setting.

Introduction: Why are some people or creatures evil? Here

are a number of different philosophies.

Chapter 1, Races: Three new races are custom-designed for

Champions of Ruin. Meet the extaminaar and the krinth, two

vicious new races, and, at long last, a player can play a draegloth,

using the monster class information provided here.

Chapter 2, The Tools of Evil: More than a dozen new feats,

more than forty new spells, and a selection of newly unearthed

magic items let characters explore their umbral urges.

Chapter 3, Prestige Classes: Six new prestige classes are

detailed here, along with tips on how to place them into your

campaign.

Chapter 4, Evil Organizations: To join or oppose? The player

characters have many opportunities with these organizations.

Each entry includes information on joining the groups as well

as the costs and benets of membership.

Chapter 5, Evil Places: Evil nodes, shadow nodes, shrines, and

places of evil power await the brave, desperate, or devious.

Introduction

Chapter 6, Encounters with Evil: This chapter offers practical

advice on incorporating evil player characters into a campaign.

Chapter 7, Champions of Evil: Learn more about the elder

evil of Faern. Aumvor the Undying, Dendar the Night Serpent,

Soneillon the Queen of Whispers, Eltab, and others are detailed

in all their gore, glory, and greatness.

Philosophies of Evil

Evil characters offer a rich diversity of opportunities for roleplay-

ing. They can be complex people tormented by failure to live up

to good ideals, although some evil characters never bother to

analyze whether their actions are good or evil. Others believe

that the end justies the means, and that good can ultimately

come of evil acts; some are opportunists who serve no higher

purpose than personal advancement.

When playing an evil character, some people have a tendency

to view evil in black-and-white terms and to assume that the evil

character in the party is looking for any opportunity to betray,

rob or murder his companions. This is an extreme viewpoint.

Evil can manifest itself in many ways, not all of them so

overt as stabbing the partys paladin in the back or tossing

victims into the ery belly of a brazen idol. While assault and

murder are obvious manifestations of an evil characters behav-

ior, ruthless selshness can often be a more potent expression

of evil than the psychotic thief who murders his companions

in their sleep.

A character can be evil and yet not seem to be evil; he can

be evil yet consider himself the epitome of goodness; or his evil

might only show itself under certain conditions. A character who

has contracted lycanthropy, for example, might donate treasure

to widows and orphans, build temples, slay dragons, and help old

ladies across the streetbut on the night of the full moon, he

hunts down and slaughters those widows and orphans and feeds

the same old ladies to the dragon. Most of the time he is good,

but his curse wipes out all the good that he does.

A naturally good or neutral character might be driven to evil

through the need to seek revenge, nding evil acts an easy way

to accomplish her goals. Another might stray from righteousness

and goodness by using evil means to justify good ends.

Of course, evil can be self-evident. No one is going to ques-

tion whether the priest of Cyric is really a good guy at heart;

he isntif he were, Cyric wouldnt grant him any spells. But

just because he is evil doesnt mean he is going to slaughter his

companions and steal their treasure at the rst opportunity. If

evil were really that self-destructive, good wouldnt have nearly

as hard a time combating it.

At the same time, it can be hard to understand what would

motivate a person to become evil. It is the rare individual who

admitsmuch less embracesbeing evil, and most people con-

sider themselves, if not wholly good, certainly not irredeemably

evil. Yet Faern is lled with irredeemably evil antiheroes, gods

and monsters.

So what is evil?

If you wish to play an evil character, you might act exactly

as you would play a good character, except in reverse. Instead of

going out to slay the red dragon that has been terrorizing the elf

village, you go out to slay the gold dragon that has been terror-

izing the orc village. However, if you are going to interact and

perhaps adventure with a party of good and neutral characters,

you might need to explore your characters evil nature a little

more deeply and try to nd out what it is that denes the evil

alignment you have chosen for him.

Various philosophies of evil are briey discussed below. Each

section provides tips for what sorts of religion each philosophy

follows; examples of organizations, deities, character types, or

creatures that embody a particular philosophy; and the align-

ment or alignments commonly held by those who practice the

philosophy.

Tradition/There Is No Evil

One potential cause for evil is simply following the norms and

standards of your ancestors and society. Evil is dened by society,

not by the inherent laws of gods or nature. What might be

considered the darkest taboo in one place might be a perfectly

acceptable practice somewhere else. For example, slavery is illegal

in many parts of Faern but is fairly common in Thay, where

even a good person might keep a slave or two simply because

it is a societal norm. In some regions, the use of narcotics and

hallucinogenic drugs is strongly discouraged, while in others it is

an integral part of the daily spiritual lives of the people.

Other situations are not so obvious. Sorcery, for example, is

forbidden in some regions for no other reason than that the people

distrust it. Anyone practicing sorcery in such a place might well

be called evil by the regions judges and sheriffs, while just across

the border, sorcery is an honored profession. In civilized lands,

violent retribution or revenge is the exclusive domain of the civil

or religious authorities. The rule of law is meant to protect the

innocent from hasty judgment by a grieving father or angry mob.

If you are harmed and you lash out in retaliation, your actions

might be seen to be as evil as the crime you are avenging. But

in border regions and lawless areas where a person has to rely on

his own devices, personal acts of revenge are the norm and are

considered no more evil than an act of self-defense. Evil can often

be dened not by an individuals acts or personal philosophy, but

by the culture in which he is acting at the time.

Characters might use this philosophy to justify their actions,

and they could very well be correct, depending on their individual

circumstances. A half-orc from the Spine of the World or a drow

character from the Underdark might have a much more liberal

interpretation of what constitutes evil compared to someone from

Silverymoon or Cormyr.

In any case, either the player or the DM must assign an

alignment to the character, if for no other reason than the

fact that alignment plays a critical role in how certain magic

worksforbiddance spells, or damage reduction that is overcome

by a certain kind of aligned weapon, for example. Morally am-

Introduction

biguous characters can be assigned the same alignment as their

patron deity, if no other solution presents itself.

Religion: Characters holding this philosophy are attracted to

small regional or cultural religions and cults.

Example: Cult of the Dragon.

Common Alignments: Neutral evil, chaotic evil.

I Am Not Evil

Some people recognize that evil exists in the world, but they

do not in any way think of themselves as evil, no matter how

depraved their actions might be. The Eldreth Veluuthra (discussed

on page 78 and further detailed in Lords of Darkness) is a perfect

example of an evil organization that thinks its every action is

in the service of good.

A character with this philosophy must still be assigned his

correct alignment, no matter what he thinks of himself, for the

same reasons as characters who believe in the Tradition/There Is

No Evil philosophy. Either the player or the DM should assign

alignment according to the preponderance of the characters ac-

tions. If he occasionally does good things but most often resorts

to evil ends to justify his evil means, he should be given an evil

alignment, no matter what his objections.

Religions: Characters with this philosophy often worship gods

of good.

Example: Eldreth Veluuthra.

Common Alignment: Lawful evil.

Evil Curse

The character has become evil through some magical agenta

curse from a god, a disease such as lycanthropy, through contact

with an artifact, or another form of powerful magic. In some

cases, his outlook with respect to law and chaos does not change.

The curse is usually resisted at rst, but the longer it is in effect,

the more likely it is that the character will give in to the curses

evil characteristics.

Religions: The character might attempt to retain his former

religion, but will gradually gravitate toward a religion that most

closely matches his alignment or that welcomes him for what

he is now.

Example: Malar.

Special: Good paladins and clerics under an evil curse usually

lose their divine abilities.

Common Alignments: All.

Seduction

The character has been lured with promises of power, glory,

wealth, or pleasure into performing evil acts. He is not proud of

his actions, but his desire for these rewards outweighs his dislike

of what he has become. He might even come to accept his evil

nature and relish it. A character can be magically seduced through

powerful enchantment spells or by being awed in the presence

of an evil god. Seduction differs from an evil curse in that the

character is not opposed to what is happening to him. He might

not at rst even be aware that he is acting in an evil manner, but

when he does realize it, he doesnt seek to change his ways.

Religions: The character is usually active within an evil

religion, since it is most often the religion, or his association

with it, that has seduced him.

Example: Shar.

Common Alignments: All.

Driven to Evil

A character could be driven to evil in several ways. His life or

circumstances might have been so harsh that he had to commit

evil acts just to survive. He might be seeking retribution for some

unimaginable wrong done to him or those he loved. He might

be ghting re with re, so to speak, driven to evil just to keep

a worse evil at bay.

Unlike the character who doesnt accept that he is evil, this

type of character often doesnt see himself as truly evilbut he

doesnt deny that what he has done in the past could be taken

that way. Often, he has some grandiose intention to make up for

what he has done; of course, by that time it might be too late

for him to change his ways.

Religions: Any. This sort of evil is not associated with a

particular religion.

Examples: Many a thieves guild is lled with these types of

characters.

Common Alignment: Neutral evil.

Just Plain Mean

The character is incapable of controlling his violent or anti-social

impulses. He might be kind, intelligent, and perfectly capable

of completing a task, holding a conversation, and working suc-

cessfully at a craft. But when something sets him off, there is

no telling what hell do. There is no way of knowing from one

day to the next what will ignite his fury; he usually blames his

outbursts on others and doesnt accept that he has done anything

wrong, nor does he feel regret or remorse.

Religions: Any. This sort of evil is not associated with a

particular religion.

Examples: Fighters, thieves, and barbarians.

Common Alignment: Chaotic evil.

Natural Born Evil

The character has been brought up in a society in which evil is

the rule of thumb, and he knows no other way of life. He was

born on a battleeld or in an orc den, learned to deceive almost

before he learned to talk, and probably committed his rst truly

vile act before he was ten years old.

I

This type of evil character is the most likely to undergo an

alignment shift once exposed to other cultures. He is also the most

likely to hate and fear anything that is different from himself.

Religions: The character prefers the shamanistic religion or

cult in which he was raised.

Examples: Monster societies.

Common Alignments: Chaotic evil, lawful evil.

Mad, I Tell You

Because of some psychosis,

obsession or overpowering

phobia,  the  character  is

driven to perform acts of in-

comprehensible evil. Even

characters dedicated to

the philosophy of evil or

to evil gods often nd this

characters actions beyond

the pale of acceptable

behavior. Depending on

the nature of the mad-

ness, the character could

feel remorse for the things

he  does,  but  he  cannot

stop himself from repeating

them. Another character

might delight in the things

he does, or he might not even

be aware of what he is doing.

Religions: Depending on the

madness and how it manifests,

the character might be incapable

of participating in organized reli-

gion of any type, or he might be a leader

of an evil religion or cult. He might even

be a patron of a good religion. But underneath

he hides a terrible secret, an impulse that drives

him to do things that would horrify a demon. On

the other hand, some evil religions and organizations

could welcome him after discovering his madness so that they can

manipulate him and make use of his particular talents.

Examples: Bane, Cyric.

Common Alignments: All, especially those with chaotic

tendencies.

Inherently Evil

The characters race dictates that he is evil. This is usually

only the case with certain monster races, especially undead and

outsiders.

Religions: Monster religions, if any.

Example: Night Masks.

Common Alignments: Any evil.

Evil Choice

For some reason, the character has chosen to act in an evil

manner, one that he admits is evil and for which he feels no

remorse. His reasons might be selsh, he might be bent on revenge

by any means possible, or he might be driven to complete a task

or achieve a goal, and will let nothing stand in his way. On the

other hand, he could simply be a sociopath equally capable of

acts of extreme good or extreme evil, neither of which move him

emotionally or spiritually, and in which he is incapable of

seeing any contradiction. Characters of this bent

nd it easy to conceal their alignment

and move about in polite society.

Religions: Any religion that

serves his selsh purpose, in-

cluding good-aligned ones.

E x a m p l e s :   I r o n

Throne, Arcane Broth-

erhood.

Common  Align-

ments:  Lawful  evil,

neutral evil.

Better to

Rule in

Hell than

Serve in

Heaven

This character is actively

opposed  to  good,  nds

goodness to be repellent in

every form, and thinks being

good  is  a  sign  of  weakness  of

character. He is driven by hate and

lust and revels in the thwarting of goodness

at every turn.

Religions: The most active and radical evil

Mad, I tell you:

Evil twisted by insanity

religions and organizations attract this type of character.

Examples: Cyric, Bane, Shar.

Common Alignments: Any evil.

The Ends Justify the Means

This path follows a slippery slope. The character seeks some

greater good, perhaps the overthrow of a heinous villain or the

establishment of a good church or organization in the face of

adversity; nothing will stop her from achieving this goal, even

if she must do evil to accomplish it.

Religions: The character might belong to any religion, but

good-aligned deities rarely look with favor upon evil acts.

Examples: Mystra, Shaundakul, Oghma.

Common Alignments: All.

and that their unique ancestry would make them targets for

heroes and villains alike.

Racial History

The point of origin of the draegloth race is unknown. Many of

the historically dominant drow houses have their own legends,

each of which claims that the house was the rst to receive Lolths

blessing. Of course, the veracity of such claims is questionable at

best, and they have been responsible for more than one conict

between matron mothers. Draegloths have been around long

enough that no one can say that any of these claims are invalid,

but House Baenre of Menzoberranzan was likely the rst ben-

eciary of a draegloth servant. This theory probably holds more

truth than others; a draegloth loyal to House Baenre is known to

have sheltered its leaders during the strife that eventually made

them the undisputed rulers of Menzoberranzan.

For thousands of years, draegloths were extremely rare, ap-

pearing infrequently in a few drow enclaves across the Underdark.

Starting around two thousand years ago, draegloth sightings

became more and more frequent, even being reported far from

the nearest drow enclave. Such reports were often dismissed

as the frightened ramblings of Underdark travelers, but it was

truea small number of draegloths had broken free of their

dependence on the drow, who were, of course, unconcerned by

this development. After all, free-roaming draegloths had been

present in their cities for some time, having been set loose as

wars and internal conicts saw their matron mothers and houses

destroyed. This oversight would prove to be costly to the drow

enclave of IrSylin.

The drow of IrSylin thought nothing of rumors that a

draegloth had been terrorizing a nearby settlement of duergar.

Refugees from the dwarf enclave told of a rampaging, four-

armed demon that dragged bodies away to be eaten. When this

lone draegloth appeared at the edge of IrSylin, the lizard riders

guarding the city greeted it with a cautious deference, for even

a free draegloth is Lolths child. The draegloth did not attack

immediately, instead biding its time until the enclaves ruling

Some races are rumored to have a predisposition

toward evil; in fact, this trait varies greatly from

race to race. Tieings often experience prejudice

against them because of their evil ancestry even though many

of them are neutral or even good. The stereotyping of tieings

as inherently evil often lacks substance. In contrast, the races

presented here merit their reputations as truly malevolent.

While not every draegloth, extaminaar, or krinth follows an

evil philosophy, most are evil or at best neutral; good members

of these races are rare.

Draegloth

Draegloths are half-end terrors that are ritually created by

drow priestesses who test their devotion to Lolth by mating with

summoned demons. Only once in a great while does this coupling

produce a child, and the birth of a draegloth is seen as an omen of

the goddesss favor, often sparking wars, assassinations, and other

intrigues. Draegloths are genderless, sexless creatures incapable of

procreation. Most draegloths are incredibly loyal to the priestess

that bore them, serving them as enforcers, bodyguards, and oc-

casionally lovers. When a draegloths mother dies or the house

it serves is destroyed, it is often left to wander the Underdark,

becoming a scourge wherever it goes.

Draegloths are cruel creatures known for their great strength

and stealth. They hunt the tunnels of the Underdark for food and

the opportunity to spread evil. A lone draegloth can terrorize an

entire village of deep gnomes or grimlocks, and it will usually

move on before a concerted effort to slay it can be put together.

Draegloths rarely venture out of the Underdark, knowing that

their natural advantages would be neutralized in the world above,

matron mother demanded an audience. There, the draegloth

sprung his trap; within seconds, the matrons elite guard had

been torn apart, and the rogue draegloths slavering jaws were

inches from her throat. A teleport contingency saved her life

and preserved the tale of IrSylin; all the other members of the

enclave were either slaughtered in their homes or hunted down

in the following weeks.

Since that time, the drow have attempted to maintain tighter

controls on draegloths who are without a house. They are not

allowed to live in drow cities without a house

afliation or the sponsorship of a powerful

noble. Rogue draegloths nd themselves

watched at all timeseven if they do have a

sponsorshipand some seek out new matron

mothers to pledge themselves to in order

to avoid this suspicion. There has been at

least one case of falsifying the birth of a

draegloth in order to legitimize a houses

claim to Lolths blessing. Such deceptions

were considered blasphemous before Lolths

disappearance, but now they have an

almost cultlike effect on those who wish

to believe that the Spider Queen has

returned to their house.

Since their goddesss disappearance,

draegloths have become more inde-

pendent, many no longer serving the

matron mothers without demanding

equal status. More and more have

gone wandering the Underdark in

search of adventure and a means

to  either  restore  Lolth  to  her

former glory, or, barring that,

to increase their demonic

sires power on the Material

Plane. As a result, demon cults

have found themselves with

unexpected allies, and draegloths

are starting to form their own

cults to elevate their fathers

names. Draegloths rarely work

together, but they are not above

working with others to achieve their goals.

This is especially true for the younger members of the race, in

whom Lolths grip never rmly took hold.

around those they respect, and Lolth has given them the

ability to meditate and pray for hours while searching for a

solution. Their unique combination of patience, cunning, and

ruthlessness makes them among the most feared hunters in

the Underdark.

Draegloths see all creatures in the world other than drow and

other Lolth-blessed beings as cattle or puppets. They have no

problem with killing other sentient beings for food or pleasure.

This does not mean that they cannot respect another being for her

status or power, and draegloths make excellent

companions and servants to the matron mothers

who bore them. But outside of this well-dened

religious and social role, seless acts on behalf

of another are outside the draegloths realm of

comprehension.

The only thing that outshines a draegloths

loathing for other creatures is its faith.

Worship of Lolth (or more recently

Vhaeraun) drives a draegloths ex-

istence, and many become clerics

devoted to her. They act as body-

guards and advisors to the matron

mothers out of respect for Lolth,

and even now that she has disap-

peared, most draegloths continue

to worship her with their customary fervor.

However, some draegloths have lost faith

in the Spider Queen and now look to their

demonic sires for guidance. For other denizens

of the Underdark, these are the most dangerous

draegloths, because while their faithful cousins

war with the drow and search for signs of

Lolth, those who have left her are organizing

demon-worshiping humanoids around them.

Such draegloths have started interacting

with more weak-minded humanoids

recently, rather than hunting them as

they once would have, in order to gain

power and reach for their new organiza-

tions. Grimlocks are their favorite recruits,

thanks to those creatures barbaric ferocity and

willingness to follow a strong leader in exchange

for the ability to thrive in the dangerous Un-

Draegloth

derdark environment.

Outlook

Draegloths are sly and cunning creatures with a penchant for

wild rages that end in the deaths of those around them. They

are excellent advisors, because their minds are seemingly cre-

ated for understanding the many threads of drow intrigues,

and their innate savagery allows for a plethora of options in

dealing with any enemies. They can be patient listeners when

Personality

Draegloths are possibly the most purely evil race in all of Toril.

They are born from the conuence of two great evils into a world

where vileness is normal and goodness is as absent as the light

of the sun. Members of this race enjoy inicting great cruelty

on others, and they learn how to do so from their mothers,

who nurture this trait with great relish and care. Draegloths

are known for their lack of appreciation of beauty. Unlike most

9

Races

other races, they do not have any aesthetic sense, they do not

appreciate art in any form, and they are not swayed by attractive

members of their own race or others. It is whispered that the

only time a draegloth feels peace is when it is committing acts

of evil and depravity.

Physical Description

Draegloths resemble impressively large drow, with black skin, a

long white mane, and glowering red eyes. They stand between

7-1/2 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 300 and 375 pounds.

Their legs have two joints, making them extremely quick and

agile, and their bodies are framed with thick, powerful muscles.

A draegloths face is elongated and skeletal. It has four arms, two

of which are normal-looking drow arms that appear undersized

compared to its body and are often used for spellcasting. The

other two arms are long and powerful extremities, ending

in wicked claws and with hands hanging low, much like an

apes. Draegloths do not feel the need to wear clothing, since

each individuals body is covered with a ne coat of white fur.

Draegloths are born fully developed and live to be about 300

years old, although the savage life of the Underdark robs most

of their full lifespan.

Relations

Most draegloths spend their lives around drow, who either revere

them, fear them, or both. For their part, the half-demons enjoy

their special place in the drow community, and might act ar-

rogantly toward what they often see as the lesser half of their

lineage. They regard the rest of the Underdark races as little more

than animals, there only to please them or provide them with

food and treasure. The draegloths have exhibited a particularly

strong antipathy toward gloamings (see Underdark page 12), who

Table 11: The Draegloth Monster Class

return the emotion with equal intensity. Some arcanists who are

familiar with both races have suggested that the feud originates

amongst the demons who spawned the races, but to date no one

has corroborated such claims.

On the rare occasion that a draegloth leaves its Underdark

habitat, it nds none of the surface races to be palatable compan-

ions. These draegloths often live in surface caverns, only leaving

at night, while others nd drow communities such as those in

the forest of Cormanthor in which to live.

Alignment

Draegloths are creatures of pure evil, no matter which side of

the family each individual favors; they desire to be nothing

more than they are. They favor the chaotic alignment of both

parents as well, although their devotion to their mothers often

drives them to orderly behavior in their service. Draegloths who

remain without the guiding force of a matron mother for a long

period of time are likely to abandon their house and wander the

Underdark alone.

Draegloth Lands

Draegloths are found primarily in the drow cities scattered

throughout the Underdark. They tend to stick close to their

creators unless their house is destroyed or weakened so badly

that it becomes dangerous to remain. At that point, they ven-

ture off to nd new areas to exploit and new victims for their

depraved minds. Some of these draegloths might remain in the

city, having built up their own independent power bases while

serving their matrons.

While some displaced draegloths are content to wander the

dark tunnels beneath the surface of Faern, others decide to see

what lies above. Some are drawn by rumors of drow encampments

Religion

Draegloths are very devoted to Lolth, the deity whose blessing

brings them into existence. They have been as distraught as the

matron mothers over Lolths recent disappearance, and the vast

majority of draegloths remain devoted to her cause. Some drae-

gloths have wavered in their faith, however, and nd themselves

drawn to one of the other deities of the Dark Seldarine; Vhaeraun

has gained a few powerful followers this way, and he is actively

recruiting them into his forces. Selvetarm accepts draegloths

into his worship, but only temporarily, since he plans to return

them to Lolth should she ever regain her power. The recruitment

of the draegloths into Vhaerauns service is said to have been a

warning to Selvetarm that the Masked Lord was actively working

to supplant Lolths rule of the drow gods.

Language

Draegloths speak the languages of the Underdark drow, as well

as the Abyssal tongue of their sires.

Adventurers

Draegloth adventurers are most often on a mission directed by

their matron mothers, or have been turned loose to wreak havoc

on their house rivals. Individual draegloths adventure to nd a

way to get closer to their demonic sires, or to cause misery and

destruction to anyone who comes across them. Their chaotic

nature makes it difcult for them to stay in one place without a

clear goal, and they enjoy taking the treasure and lives of others

more than they care about enriching themselves.

Extaminaar

The extaminaars are the snake-blooded members of the human

noble House Extaminos, which has ruled the city of Hlondeth

for more than eight hundred years. During the last century, the

extaminaars have gone beyond Hlondeth to set up operations in

other cities across Faern. They operate from the sewers and the

shadows, hatching schemes to increase the power of their house

and nding victims on which to perform their vile grafting and

breeding experiments.

Extaminaars make excellent rogues, because they are known

for their guile and wicked ability to strike from the shadows.

Others often try to enlist extaminaars into their organizations

because of their skills as crime bosses, interrogators, and infor-

mation brokers. Still, most extaminaars have proven exceedingly

loyal to their noble house.

Racial History: The extaminaars are the descendants of a

human noble house that began consorting with a nearby yuan-ti

tribe after nding an ancient tome detailing the rituals of the

goddess Varae. The tribe of snake people had moved to Turmish,

by way of Chondath, after surviving a rift in the leadership of

House SeSehen, the dominant yuan-ti tribe of the Black Jungles.

As the yuan-ti mingled more frequently with the humans of

House Extaminos, the two groups blood began to mix. The end

result of decades of such mixing was the introduction of many

powerful yuan-ti into the membership of the house, both through

birth as well as those sent in to oversee the construction of the

Cathedral of Emerald Scales and the spreading of Varaes worship

throughout the city.

11

Races

Once those of the yuan-ti bloodline came of age within

House Extaminos, it did not take long before they completely

dominated it. Yuan-ti rulers acted as bridges between the

yuan-ti tribe and the house, until the two were virtually

indistinguishable. Now, a yuan-ti halfblood named Dediana

Extaminos openly rules Hlondeth, known as the City of

Serpents. The yuan-ti have maintained their rule of Hlondeth

using subtle tacticsor a show of strength when necessaryto

dissuade restless Turmish and Chondathan leaders from at-

tempting to take the city for their own. From time to time

a human noble has claimed leadership of the house, but

only those with the blessing of the yuan-ti (and who

fervently worship Varae) have survived.

Although Dediana and her predecessors have

successfully kept aggressors at bay throughout

the years, recently the yuan-ti began to

recognize the need for more loyal troops

and agents to protect their interests.

They were forced to admit that not

all of the citizens of Hlondeth were

comfortable being ruled by snakes,

even if the yuan-ti knew themselves

to be superior beings. Their solution

was to turn their breeding experiments

toward a quickly produced humanoid

with loyalties to the yuan-ti tribe. The

new race, called the extaminaars, was

to bridge the gap between humanity

and the yuan-ti, to be the public face

of House Extaminos in Hlondeth and

across the continent.

Extaminaars are hatched in clutches of water-

melon-sized eggs, making it possible to fertilize and

care for dozens at a time. Although they grow into

humanoid beings, their infant form is more of a

hybridarmless, scaled, and with undened facial

features. Their lack of arms during infancy is often cited

as the reason that so many extaminaars have a fond-

ness for incredibly long serpent-arm grafts (see Serpent

Kingdoms page 154).

Once the rst generation of extaminaars was ready, the

leaders of House Extaminos decided to send many of them

out into Faern, in order to keep pace with the spying and

resource gathering of the other great houses. The extaminaars

were excellent choices for this role, since they could gain direct

access to many of the same places as the purebloods with even

less need for disguise. They set up secret bases in which they

carried out their gruesome and evil experiments, and they

recruited local tribes of humanoids and rogues from the cities

to assist them in their vile deeds.

Now, the second generation of extaminaars has fully

matured, and the next ruler of House Extaminos is said to

be among them. The yuan-ti are sending these newly formed

servants into the world on less specic missions than the rst

wave. Some are being sent to reinforce cells whose leaders have

either been destroyed or are ineffective, but most are simply

seeking ways to help the clan in general. They search for artifacts

to enhance the grafting process, new magic rituals and spells

for the breeding pits, and allies in far-ung regions of Faern

that share the yuan-ti goal of world dominationif not the

same idea of who will rule it afterward.

The success and rapid breeding of the extaminaars has led

other houses to begin growing their own hybrids, although

the rst of these clutches is just now coming to maturity. As

rumors of this extensive breeding program spread

to Hlondeth, the Extaminos realized the need to

brand their own extaminaars to prevent dop-

pelgangers from inltrating their house.

The third clutch is being bred with a

distinctive pattern of scales on their

backs, a diamond-shaped collection

of brown markings. Each house

imparts a unique pattern of scales

to its extaminaars, ensuring that

they will never be mistaken for

those from another group.

Outlook: From birth, extaminaars

are raised to venerate Varae above all

other gods, and to put the concerns of

their house above all else. The trainers

have a difcult jobthey must teach

the  growing  extaminaars  enough

self-reliance to lead independent cells

in far-ung regions while keeping them

strictly under the doctrine of the tribe

and its goddess.

Extaminaar

The race as a whole is not extremely

perceptive, but individuals offset this natural

weakness by surrounding themselves with

those who can provide them with the informa-

tion they need. They tend to be very dogmatic

toward the yuan-ti view of the world as well as

the superiority of their house and the goddess

Varae. They lord their superiority over their victims, mocking

and proselytizing to bound captives as they begin the rituals

necessary to graft esh.

Extaminaars often believe that their only purpose is to

elevate their house, even to the exclusion of the greater yuan-

ti goals or their religious obligations. They maintain regular

communication with their superiors in Hlondeth, constantly

updating them on the success of their experiments and passing

along information that might be useful to the tribe. They are

very cautious about their operations, only revealing what is

necessary to their underlings and killing anyone who gets too

close to discovering their true identity.

An extaminaar agent never gets too tied up in his work

to ignore opportunities for adventure. Although devoted to

their tribe, roaming extaminaars enjoy their freedom, and

12

Races

will sometimes abandon their lairs for months at a time. A

life of adventure often follows, as events conspire to keep the

extaminaar away for longer than anticipated. Sometimes a newly

dispatched spy never even makes it to his post, either through

chance adventure or the realization that he can be free forever

from a tribe whose ideals he does not share. The latter case is

rare, howeverextaminaars are bred for loyalty as well as for

ruthless cunning and deception.

Personality: Extaminaars are scheming, cruel beings who

will stop at nothing to further the goals of their noble house.

They enjoy experimenting on lesser beings in their quest

to nd new and better creatures. They value esh above all

other forms of currency, leading them to often deal in slaves.

Extaminaars who take root in cities outside of Hlondeth are

famously patient, sometimes lying low for months if their

lair or plans are in danger of being discovered. One of these

snake-blooded nobles would rather talk his way out a situation

than ght, especially if doing so gives his companions time to

ank their enemies.

Physical Description: Extaminaars typically stand from 5

feet to 6 1/2 feet tall; because they are extremely skinny, they

often appear to be taller than they actually are. Those who

possess the very long serpent-arm graft so commonly found

in House Extaminos appear to have more girth than normal,

because they keep their arms wound around their torsos and

their necks hidden underneath expansive robes. Extaminaars

weigh less than humans of equal size because their bones are

less dense; the weight of individuals usually falls between 100

and 180 pounds. An extaminaar has pale skin with either a

yellow or green tinge, and often has brown spots in clusters

near his neck and lower back. Extaminaars prefer to grow their

hair long and use secretions from glands in the scalp to keep it

plastered back. They wear only light clothing unless they are

concealing long serpent-arms or other grafts that would give

away their true nature. Extaminaars typically live to between

60 and 80 years of age.

Relations: Despite their strange appearance, hidden lairs,

and evil goals, extaminaars are social creatures. They prefer

to work with small, reptilian beings such as kobolds when

they need minions, and nagas or young dragons when they

are looking for a more serious partner in crime. Of course, an

extaminaar has the same prejudices as his yuan-ti ancestors

toward these creatures, considering himself above all other

life forms. The yuan-ti, however, consider extaminaars to be

one of the lowest forms of related races, and would never work

for one (although they will certainly use an extaminaar to

further their goals).

Extaminaars rarely associate with the people of the com-

munity they are in, since they see them as either food or living

subjects for their experiments. They have no favored targetsthey

see all other beings as t subjects for their grafting and breeding

programs. An extaminaar needing an outside contact within the

community might deign to work with a member of a lesser race,

but he will rarely reveal his true nature to his contact, and such

arrangements are often short-lived thanks to the extaminaars

paranoia and desire to work in privacy.

Alignment: Extaminaars are evil to the core, although some

among them favor a more balanced and neutral approach to

their experiments. Still, the need for living test subjects and the

incredible pain their captives suffer through makes avoiding

the call of evil very difcult for all extaminaars but the most

strong-willed. Those who run House Extaminos and control the

city of Hlondeth favor lawfulness, and they expect the citizens

of that city to display complete deference to their rule. Those

extaminaars who venture to other lands tend to be more chaotic;

they nd themselves often on the move and in the company of

an ever-changing cadre of minions and slaves.

Extaminaar Lands: The extaminaars were rst created by

the union of a Turmish noble house with a tribe of yuan-ti living

in the Orsraun Mountains. To this day they are mostly concen-

trated in those mountains, as well as in the city of Hlondeth,

which they control. Other extaminaars have moved to cities

across Faern in order to experiment and spy, awaiting the day

when the yuan-ti empire will stretch across the continent, and

indeed the world.

Extaminaars who travel to other cities tend to set up their

base of operations in sewer systems or damp caves (preferably

river caves or snake-infested limestone structures). Where this

is not possible, they sometimes take over buildings and then

dig large basements and cavern complexes underneath the

structures.

Religion: The nobles of House Extaminos rst began inter-

mingling with the yuan-ti through their discovery of the rituals

of Varae, and they continue to worship her to this day. The rulers

of the noble house have built a wondrous and hideous temple

to Varae in Hlondeth called the Cathedral of Emerald Scales,

and all extaminaars sent out across the continent are blessed in

a blood ritual at the cathedral before they leave. Extaminaars

who nd themselves in contact with other yuan-ti will often pay

lip service to Sseth in order to avoid conict, but yuan-ti with a

rudimentary knowledge of House Extaminos and its traditions

can see through this ruse rather easily.

Clerics of Varae choose their domains from among Evil,

ScalykindSK, and Trickery. Varaes favored weapon is the sickle.

Language: Extaminaars speak yuan-ti and also learn some

functional skills in Turmic, the human language of their home-

land. All extaminaars have a working knowledge of Common

as well; those who travel extensively spend more time learning

the trade tongue than those who stay in Turmish. Those with

the aptitude to speak multiple languages often learn Draconic,

as well as the tongue of any land they settle in. These additional

language skills can aid an extaminaar when dealing with local

humanoids and operatives, and can help one maintain a cover

identity he has adopted.

Adventurers: Extaminaars might nd themselves drawn to

adventure as they set out to stake a claim in one of Faerns

great cities. Establishing a secret testing ground can also lead

to its share of problems, including wiping out any indigenous

13

Races

creatures and acquiring the means to outt a lair with the

proper infrastructure. Most extaminaars do not seek out

adventure unless it has as its goal the elevation of their house

in some way.

Extaminaar Racial Traits

2 Strength, +2 Dexterity: Extaminaar are agile but not as

strong as other humanoids their size.

Medium: As a Medium creature, an extaminaar has no special

bonuses or penalties due to his size.

Extaminaar base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: An extaminaar can see twice as far as a

human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar condi-

tions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish

color and detail under these conditions.

+2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves versus poison: Exterminaars

do not easily succumb to venom of any kind.

+4 racial bonus on Swim checks: Extaminaars are comfortable

in the water, and their light frames make it easier for them

to stay aoat.

+2 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks: Extaminaars can

wriggle their way out of sticky situations.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willspeak with animals (snakes only);

3/daycharm animal (snakes only). Extaminaar often ll

their lairs with poisonous snakes to dissuade interlopers.

Automatic Languages: Common, Turmic, and Yuan-ti. Bonus

Languages: Abyssal, Chondathan, and Draconic.

Favored Class: Rogue. A multiclass extaminaars rogue class

does not count when determining whether he takes an experi-

ence point penalty.

Level Adjustment +0.

Krinth

For the past two thousand years, the City of Shade has existed

on the Plane of Shadow, kept in good condition by slaves

captured from that plane as well as from Faern. The Neth-

erese wizards who rule the city also trafcked with demonic

creatures made of the same tenebrous substance as the plane

itself. On occasion, these demons would force themselves on

the slaves; the offspring from these couplings are a unique

race known as the krinth.

Krinth are known for their physical endurance, their single-

mindedness, and their quick tempers. They make excellent

warriors and servants because of the rst two traits, but the

third often means they are short-lived at both roles.

Racial History: The krinth came into being shortly after

the City of Shade found itself trapped on the Plane of Shadow.

The powerful Netherese arcanists of the oating city regularly

held congress with the shadowy ends of the plane, and often

the demons demanded to know the secrets of human pleasure.

From these unions came a race of half-demon beings that came

to be called the krinth. These are the facts.

However, the krinth themselves do not ascribe to this rather

unattering origin, instead insisting that they had always lived

in the shadow world and that they were offered as slaves to the

Netherese in return for treasure and knowledge of the Material

Plane and its magic. They point to colonies of krinth in the

Plane of Shadow as evidence for this theory, although in truth

these are simply escaped krinth who have managed to carve

out a niche for themselves in their dark home.

The rst krinth were born of unions between Netherese

and demons. These krinth were unable to reproduce, making

them a rare occurrence and little more than an interesting

curiosity to both the shades and the demons who spawned them.

For a short time, the krinth even enjoyed an elevated status

within the city, where they were viewed as an expression of

the union between the realm of shadow and its new residents.

They were given well-appointed living quarters and allowed

to study under the best teachers and mages in the city. The

Shadovar secretly hoped that the krinth would somehow give

them the added knowledge and power needed to dominate the

plane and its denizens.

It did not take long before krinth began to pop up among the

slaves, however. This development led quickly to the reassignment

of all krinth as slaves of the royal family. Some krinth escaped

enslavement by appealing to those who had become close to them,

and even those who were enslaved were often given preferential

assignments. The rulers of Shade feared that abusing the krinth

could bring down the wrath of the shadow demons, although in

truth these demons cared little for their spawn.

For a reason unknown to them or their masters, the krinth

became fertile about one thousand years ago and started repro-

ducing among themselves. This quickly created two different

castes of krinththe trueborn, or full krinth, and the halfbreed

demonspawn. The demonspawn, once having been favored by

the Shadovar, now found themselves outcasts in their own

community. The trueborn krinth treated the demonspawn with

cruelty and contempt, forming a deep division in the krinth

community that lasts to this day. The number of demonspawn

has dropped dramatically since Shades return to Faern, but

plenty of demonspawn children remain within the city. Many

demonspawn krinth have turned informant, attempting to help

the Shadovar crush the growing krinth underground movement

before it can become a true threat.

The true story of the sudden fertility of the krinth reaches

all the way back to one of Faerns oldest struggles. The goddess

Shar, having been systematically defeated by her sister Selne

at every turn, found herself looking elsewhere for ways to win

their eternal battle. She saw in the krinth an opportunity to

create a race of servants who could bridge the gap between

Faern and the Plane of Shadow. Shar is secretive and subtle,

and so she did not reveal herself to the krinth, instead choosing

to watch them develop from afar. She was disappointed that the

Netherese could not nd their way back to Faern, however, and

largely gave up on the krinth until Shades recent appearance

over Anauroch. Now she is once again interested in turning

the krinth to her.

For their part, the krinth have adjusted well to life as slaves

under the Shadovar. Their natural tendencies are to work hard

and play hard, so the erratic and often grueling schedules they

keep as slaves do not bother them. The number of krinth

quickly outstripped the royals need for them, and so they

can now be found working for any number of patrons around

the city. They have steadily climbed back up to favored-slave

status, and they usually choose to keep the company of other

krinth rather than spend time with slaves

of other races.

Since the citys return to Faern,

the krinth have been restless. Shar has

sent agents to inltrate the city, and

to whisper thoughts of freedom and

promises of her rewards into the ears of

eager krinth. With the number of

krinth who have escaped the city

rising steadily, under the inu-

ence of Shar as well as their

own desire for freedom, the

Shadovar have tightened the

reins on the City of Shade. The

krinth are still alien to every

culture in Faern, and even in

places where they have proven

their value, they still arouse

curiosity and suspicion.

Outlook: Krinth are not

philosophers. Their natu-

ral inclination is to only

think  about  what  they

are doing at the moment,

and  perhaps  what  they

will be doing afterward.

On the Plane of Shadow

this outlook helped them

immensely, allowing them

to thrive even under the yoke of their Shadovar masters. It

also means that they have difculty with long-term planning

of any kind, and function best when matters of strategy are

left to others.

Now that they have reached Faern, the krinth nd that

they have more opportunities open to them than ever before.

Some krinth have seen the beauty of the forests and caverns of

Faern and wish to live there, rather than in the city above the

desert. This desire led to many escape attempts during the early

Shadovar excavation projects, and the shades have since put tight

controls on any krinth that leave the city. Some krinth are nally

awakening to the reality of their slavery, and it is frustrating to

them that they cannot leave the City of Shade to explore this

new world around them. While there is nothing close to a full

insurrection brewing, a burgeoning underground movement

helps krinth escape into the world at large, and ghts for krinth

interests within the city.

Krinth mature more quickly than the Shadovar. To the

Shadovar, this simply means that their slaves can take on more

responsibilities at an earlier age. This trait does give the krinth

some insight into the true nature of those around them, since

people act much differently around children than they do around

adults. Krinth children excel at sports, and spend most of their

free time playing and inventing new games. They do not

experiment with different interests as the children of

other races do, because the krinth mind does not

worry about nding and pursing its pas-

sion. Occasionally a krinth will show some

artistic talent or skill with mathematics

or spellcraft, although the Shadovar

generally frown upon such diversions.

The only way a krinth in the City

of Shade is likely to learn magic or art is

through a clandestine teacher, or perhaps

with the encouragement of the krinth

underground, who seek to develop a

loyal cadre of mages for the time

when they attempt to break free

from the yoke of slavery.

Like their children, krinth adults

prefer rigorous activity in their

leisure time, often playing sports

or training in combat. During the

rare holidays in which they have

more than one day off at a time,

krinth stay up all night long

drinking large quantities of

beer, wine, and other festive

libations. Aside from the rift

between demonspawn and

trueborns, krinth treat one

another  and  others  with

respect. Even though many

are now longing for freedom,

Krinth

they do not actively hate the Shadovar who rule them.

Personality: Krinth are seen as dour and humorless by most

other races. When they are working at a task, they rarely allow

themselves to become distracted from it. The krinth are said to

work as hard at leisure as they do at laboring, drinking copious

amounts of alcohol, enjoying food to gluttonous proportions,

playing games of chance, and taking physical pleasures as often

as possible. Members of this race work hard and play hard,

and they never seem to rest.

Physical Description: A krinth appear similar to an average

specimen of the nonendish half of their bloodline. Krinth

are generally born to human, orc, or dwarf parentsthe most

common slave races in the City of Shade. Krinth with dwarf

ancestry are shorter and more stout than those of human or orc

ancestry, but they are not as short as true dwarves. Krinth range

15

Races

anywhere between 5 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between

150 and 250 pounds. All krinth, regardless of their ancestry, have

straight black hair, black eyes, and dusky gray skin. Krinth reach

adulthood at age 20 and live between 100 and 125 years.

Relations: Although the krinth are slaves in the City of

Shade, they still occupy a higher social stratum than the other

humanoid slaves of the city. The Shadovar generally give them

better positions and treat them with less cruelty than their other

slaves. Since krinth are related to the shadow demons of their

adopted home plane, some Shadovar fear that mistreating them

would risk making enemies of the demons and their offspring.

The krinth regard the citys other slave races as beneath

them. They often treat their fellow slaves with more contempt

than their owners do, and their violent tempers often cost them

dearly when they take the life of, or disable, another slave. Krinth

who have escaped the City of Shade and made their way onto

the continent usually maintain this haughty attitude, although

they realize that they must soften it somewhat if they are to get

along. Most escaped krinth become mercenaries and seek to join

a larger organization. Several have joined with the Zhentarim

through caravans moving through Anauroch, and others have

gone into the Underdark and now ght for the drow. On rare

occasions, a krinth joins a more traditional community and learns

to live alongside normal races, even hiding his true nature from

his new neighbors.

Alignment: Krinth are very chaotic in nature, despite their

single-mindedness in duty. They also tend to favor the evil of

their sires, although some have shown the capacity to break out

of this mold, and even to do good. Those who escape the City

of Shade are more likely to lean toward neutrality, which might

have been the cause for their ight in the rst place.

Krinth Lands: Most krinth are slaves in the City of Shade,

performing high-level tasks as well as menial labor for their Sha-

dovar masters. They tend to reside in subterranean lairs even on

the oating city, since they prefer to live in isolation from other

races. Krinth who escape the city often retreat to the Underdark

if they can nd entry; otherwise, they simply travel as far from

Anauroch as possible. They consider open terrain to be indefensible

and uncomfortable, and the entire race suffers from a mild case

of agoraphobia. Thus, in cases where they cannot nd their way

into The Night Below, krinth often take up residence in heavy

forests, jungles, or in mountain valleys hidden away from the

sun and other humanoids.

Religion: Krinth have no common racial deity; instead, they

tend to worship powerful demon lords, especially those from their

home plane. A krinth rarely worships the demon who spawned

him unless the demon is a powerful lord that calls his spawn to

him. Krinth who escape their servitude and take up a life outside

the City of Shade often adopt native gods in order to better t

in. The deities discussed below are the most common choices of

worship for krinth who have left their old lives behind through

virtue or chance.

Those krinth who take up with the Zhentarim via one of the

caravans that run through the Anauroch generally worship Bane.

The Black Lord rules his people through power and fear, much

like the demons that the krinth are used to worshiping.

Those krinth who nd their way to the Underdark often

take up the worship of whatever god is prevalent in the com-

munity in which they nd themselves, most commonly Lolth

or Laduguer.

Shar also maintains her interest in these new Faernians, and

has directed several of her cells to actively recruit those krinth

who labor in the City of Shade as well as those who have left it.

Language: All krinth speak Common and Halruaan. Krinth

who have lived with the Shadovar might also know Netherese,

the dead language of the dead empire. Although krinth often

have contact with their sires, not all of them learn to speak or

understand the Abyssal tongue. Individual krinth who escape the

City of Shade might learn other languages appropriate to their

new region or the peoples who live there. All krinth are literate,

except for barbarians.

Adventurers: Most krinth are happy with their roles as the

favored slaves of the Shadovar. They secretly believe that the

shadow demons that spawned them will elevate them someday,

but their decent treatment at the hands of their masters is

enough for now. Those who are not happy are either rooted

out and killed, or they escape out of the oating city and nd

a new life onor underthe surface of Faern. A krinths

stubborn will to nish the job often helps him stand strong

in the face of the sorts of horrors that adventurers meet on a

regular basis.

Krinth Racial Traits

+2 Constitution, 2 Charisma: Krinth are hardy and resistant

to illness and damage, but they often lack self-determina-

tion and a sense of purpose outside that given to them by

others.

Medium: As Medium creatures, krinth have no special bonuses

or penalties due to their size.

Krinth base land speed is 30 feet.

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

+1 racial bonus on all Will saves. Krinth are resilient in mind

as well as body.

+1 bonus on all saving throws against spells and spell-like

abilities with the shadow descriptor.

+2 racial bonus on Hide checks in shadowy conditions.

+4 racial bonus on saving throws against fear. As the spawn

of demons, the krinth were born of fear and malice.

Krinth cannot become shaken, and they ignore the effects

of the shaken condition; they can still become frightened or

panicked, though in most cases their innate resistance to fear

keeps them from it.

Automatic Languages: Common and Netherese. Bonus Lan-

guages: Abyssal, Chondathan, Damaran, Undercommon.

Favored Class: Fighter. A multiclass krinths ghter class does

not count when determining whether he takes an experience

point penalty.

Level Adjustment +0.

Feats and spells serve to add interesting avor to evil

characters and campaigns. Initiate feats allow divine

spellcasters to personalize their spell list based on their

deity, often granting them spells unique to their philosophies. Vile

feats allow characters to form stronger bonds with particularly

evil patrons such as demons and devils. Magic nodes can now

be loci of evil power; for details on how node magic works, see

Chapter 5 as well as page 49 of Underdark.

Feats

Champions of Ruin introduces several feats of pure cruelty and

evil. Characters devoted to dark gods or vicious means can use

these feats to enhance their wicked power.

Bloodsoaked Intimidate

Your bloody and vicious approach to combat makes you a fear-

some foe.

Prerequisites: Snatch Trophy.

Benet: When you collect a trophy using the Snatch Trophy

feat, you can make an Intimidate check as a swift action against

an adjacent opponent who witnesses your savage act (see the Swift

and Immediate Actions sidebar for more information).

Normal: Making an Intimidate check in combat is a standard

action.

Chakram Ricochet

You can hurl a chakram so that it strikes two enemies instead

of one.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, base attack bonus +1, procient with

chakram.

Benet: If you hit a creature with a thrown chakram, you can

cause it to ricochet and strike a secondary target in an adjacent

square (within 5 feet of the primary target). You immediately

make an attack roll against the secondary target, at a 2 penalty.

If the attack hits, you deal damage normally.

Special: A rogue with Chakram Ricochet can deal sneak attack

damage to both targets if they are within 30 feet and denied their

Dexterity bonus to AC.

Corrupt Spell [Metamagic]

You can transform one of your spells into a thing of evil due to

a deal you make with an evil power.

Prerequisites: Any evil alignment.

Benet: This feat adds the evil descriptor to one damaging

spell you can cast. You must choose the spell at the time you select

the feat. If the spell deals damage, half of the damage is unholy

damage. For example, a corrupted reball cast by a 6th-level

wizard deals 6d6 points of damage: 3d6 points of re damage

and 3d6 points of unholy damage. Thus, creatures immune to

re still potentially take 3d6 points of damage.

Special: A character can take this feat multiple times, choosing

a different spell each time.

This feat originally appeared in Book of Vile Darkness and

has been revised for D&D v.3.5.

Craven

Like most sly rogues, you are a dangerous coward. However, your

sneak attacks deal more damage than normal.

Prerequisites: Sneak attack class feature, cannot be immune

to fear.

Benet: You take a 2 penalty on saving throws against fear

effects. However, when making a sneak attack, you deal an extra

1 point of damage per character level.

Dire Flail Smash

You have mastered the style of ghting with the dire ail and

have learned to deal thunderous blows with the weapon.

throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modier) or

be dazed by the pain for 1 round.

19

Tools of Evil

Dirty Rat

You are quite adept at slipping under a foes guard while hes

distracted.

Prerequisites: Tumble 4 ranks.

Benet: You gain an additional +1 bonus on attack rolls when

anking an opponent.

Doomspeak [Bardic]

You can demoralize an enemy with horrible condemnations and

grim portents of impending doom.

Prerequisites: Bardic music class feature, Intimidate 8 ranks,

Perform 8 ranks.

Benet: You can spend one of your bardic music uses to utter

a string of crass and appalling epithets and curses at one enemy

within 120 feet. The intended target must be able to hear and

comprehend your damning remarks. A target that fails a Will

save (DC 10 + your character level + your Cha modier) is cursed

with a 10 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill

checks for 1 round. This is a supernatural, necromantic effect.

Entangling Spell [Metamagic]

Your spell releases residual eldritch power that entangles your

enemies.

Benet: The feat can be applied to any instantaneous spell that

deals acid, cold, electricity, re, or sonic damage, such as reball

or lightning bolt. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of raw

energy persist; creatures damaged by the spell are entangled for

1 round. The spell is considered to be in effect during this time

and can be dispelled normally. An entangling spell uses up a spell

slot two levels higher than the spells actual level.

Feral Animal Companion

You can enslave a feral animal and adopt it as your animal

companion.

Prerequisites: Animal companion class feature, evil alignment.

Benet: Instead of calling a normal animal companion, you

can call a feral animal companion that foams at the mouth.

Any creature harmed by the animals bite attack must succeed

on a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract red ache (see Dungeon

Masters Guide page 292). The disease has no harmful effect on

the feral animal. In addition, your feral animal companion gains

a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. Attempts by others to

inuence your feral animal companion with Handle Animal

checks take a 10 penalty.

Special: This feat does not transform a normal animal com-

panion into a feral animal companion.

Flay Foe

You are skilled at aying the esh from your enemys bones.

Prerequisites: Str 15, base attack bonus +6, procient with

slashing melee weapon.

Benet: If you hit the same enemy more than once in a single

round with a slashing melee weapon, you deal an extra point of

damage with each hit after the rst.

Special: A ghter can select this feat as one of his ghter

bonus feats.

Improved Fiendish Servant

You gain the service of a powerful endish animal servitor.

Prerequisites: Fiendish servant class feature.

Benet: Add the following creatures to your list of eligible

endish servants: ape, black bear, boar, crocodile, dire badger, dire

bat, dire weasel, heavy warhorse, leopard, monitor lizard, constric-

tor snake, Large viper snake, wolverine. In addition, any endish

servant you call has the endish creature template (Monster

Manual page 107). The endish servant otherwise conforms to

the rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide (page 183).

Lingering Spell [Metamagic]

Residual eldritch energy from your spell continues to harm your

enemies after the spells main effect has expired.

Benet: The feat can be applied to any one instantaneous spell

that deals acid, cold, electricity, re, or sonic damage, such as reball

or lightning bolt. After the spell is cast, lingering tendrils of energy

persist, dealing 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy

type at the beginning of your next turn to all creatures initially

damaged by the spell. The spell is considered to be in effect during

this time and can be dispelled normally. A lingering spell uses up

a spell slot one level higher than the spells actual level.

Malign Spell Focus

Your evil spells are more potent than normal due to a deal forged

with an evil power.

Prerequisites: Any evil alignment.

Benet: Add +1 to the DC for all saving throws against any

of your spells that have the evil descriptor.

Special: This feat originally appeared in Book of Vile Darkness

and has been revised for D&D v.3.5.

Mortifying Attack

Those who witness your brutal death attack are unnerved and

jarred by the experience.

Prerequisites: Death attack class feature.

Benet: All creatures within 30 feet that witness you make

a successful death attack must succeed on a Will save (DC equal

to death attack damage dealt) or be shaken for 2d4 rounds. Any

creature you consider your ally is unaffected. In addition, creatures

that fail the save are so horried by the attack that they lose

their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class for 1 round. The target of

the death attack must also make the saving throw if it survives.

This extraordinary ability is a fear effect.

Mutilator

After striking down your enemy in battle, you can skillfully

mutilate the corpse to prevent others from raising it from

the dead.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +4, any evil alignment.

20

Tools of Evil

Benet: After delivering the killing blow to a creature (that

is, reducing it to 10 hit points) with a melee weapon, you can

decapitate or otherwise hack apart the corpse as a free action.

Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity and ensures

that the creature cannot be revived using a raise dead spell. You

can mutilate only one enemy per round in this fashion.

Natural Bully

You easily terrify weaker adversaries.

Prerequisites: Intimidate 6 ranks.

Benet: All enemies within 30 feet of you that have one-half

your Hit Dice or less are bullied; they take a 2 morale penalty

on attack rolls made against you. A bullied enemy that succeeds

in hitting and damaging you is no longer subject to the penalty

and cannot be bullied by you for 24 hours. Creatures immune

to fear effects cannot be bullied and do not take the penalty on

attacks rolls to hit you.

Poison Immunity

After prolonged exposure to a poison or toxin, you have rendered

yourself immune to it.

Benet: You are immune to one specic poison (chosen by

you), whether available as a blade poison, the venom of a specic

creature, or one other toxin. You also gain a +1 circumstance

bonus on saving throws against other poisons.

Special: A character can take this feat multiple times, choosing

a different poison each time. The +1 bonus against other poisons

does not stack with itself.

Profane Outburst [Divine]

With a horrendous release of divine energy, you steel your undead

allies and minions against harm.

Prerequisites: Ability to rebuke undead, evil alignment.

Benet: As a standard action, you can spend one of your rebuke

attempts to bathe all undead creatures within 60 feet in divine

energy, granting them a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class for 1

minute.

Pulverize Foe

You enjoy smashing your opponents into submission.

Prerequisites: Str 15, base attack bonus +6, procient with

bludgeoning melee weapon.

Benet: If you hit the same enemy more than once in a single

round with a bludgeoning melee weapon, you deal an extra 1d6

points of bludgeoning damage with each hit after the rst.

Special: A ghter can select this feat as one of his ghter

bonus feats.

Reaping Spell [Metamagic]

The dark energy of your spell devours the soul of any creature

killed by it.

Prerequisites: Any evil alignment.

Benet: A raise dead, reincarnate, or resurrection spell

cannot return to life a creature killed by a reaping spell, and a

true resurrection spell has only a 50% chance of succeeding. A

reaping spell that fails to kill the target has no additional effect.

A reaping spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the

spells actual level.

Swift and Immediate Actions

The Miniatures Handbook introduced the concept of a new

action type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded Psionics

Handbook introduced another new action type: the immediate

action. Some of the feats and spells in Champions of Ruin use

these concepts. A description of how they work follows.

Swift Action: A swift action consumes a very small amount

of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn

without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that

regard, a swift action is like a free action. However, you can per-

form only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what other

actions you take. You can take a swift action any time you would

normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift actions usually

involve magic or psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic

items; many characters (especially those who dont use magic or

psionics) never have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting a quickened spell or manifesting a quickened power

is a swift action. In addition, casting any spell or manifesting

any power with a casting time or manifesting time of 1 swift

action is a swift action.

Casting a spell or manifesting a power with a casting or

manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks

of opportunity.

Immediate Action: Much like a swift action, an im-

mediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but

represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a

free action. Unlike a swift action, an immediate action can

be performed at any timeeven if its not your turn. Using

an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a

swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn.

You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action

until after your next turn if you have used an immediate

action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using

an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using

your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use

an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.

21

Tools of Evil

Shadowform Familiar

You can summon a familiar from the Plane of Shadow.

Prerequisites: Krinth, summon familiar class feature.

Benet: Your summoned familiar looks like a dark, shadowy

version of a normal familiar. It is insubstantial and gains the

incorporeal subtype (see Monster Manual page 310).

A shadowform familiar is more closely bound to you than a

normal familiar, and the maximum distance from you the shad-

owform familiar can travel is 30 feet per caster level. If you are

separated from your shadowform familiar by a distance greater

than this, the shadowform familiar dissolves into nothingness

and is considered slain.

Special: This feat does not transform a normal familiar into

a shadowform familiar.

Shadowstrike

Due to your ties to the Plane of Shadow, you strike more ef-

fectively in areas of dim illumination.

Prerequisites: Krinth, base attack bonus +1.

Benet: When making an attack with a melee weapon in an

area of shadowy illumination (see Players Handbook page 164),

you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the attack roll and deal an

extra 1d6 points of damage.

Special: A krinth ghter can select this feat as one of his

ghter bonus feats.

Skewer Foe

A ruthless combatant, you like to impale enemies on spears and

similar piercing weapons.

Prerequisites: Str 15, base attack bonus +6, procient with

piercing melee weapon.

Benet: If you hit the same enemy more than once in a single

round with a piercing melee weapon, you deal an extra 1d6 points

of piercing damage with each hit after the rst.

Special: A ghter can select this feat as one of his ghter

bonus feats.

Snatch Trophy

You can quickly and skillfully collect a trophy of your victory

over a fallen foe.

Benet: After dealing a creature enough damage to drop it

to negative hit points, you can slice or pry off a trophy as a free

action. You must be adjacent to the dead or dying creature. The

trophy could be a small body part such as a nger or ear. Carv-

ing a trophy in this manner requires a light slashing or piercing

weapon and deals 1d6 points of damage to the target creature.

(A creature with regeneration can regrow the severed body part.)

Alternatively, you can take a small item worn or carried by your

fallen foe, such as a piece of jewelry, pouch, potion, light weapon,

or helmet, in which case the victim takes no damage. The snatched

item can weigh no more than 2 pounds. You must have a free

hand to collect the trophy.

Touch of Benevolence

Despite your evil alignment, you are prone to moments of

benevolence and mercy.

Prerequisites: Any evil alignment.

Benet: Although you are evil and spells such as detect evil

reveal your true alignment, you have a 50% chance of ignoring

any effect that specically targets or damages evil creatures.

Special: To keep this feat, a character must demonstrate peri-

odic acts of kindness and mercy. A DM can revoke this feat if the

character fails to act in an appropriately conicted manner.

Via Negativa

You can channel greater amounts of negative energy into your

inict spells.

Prerequisites: Ability to rebuke undead.

Benet: As a free action, you can spend one of your rebuke

attempts to deal additional harm with an inict spell. You must

spend the rebuke attempt before making the attack roll. If the

attack roll succeeds, the inict spell deals an extra 1 point of

damage per character level (maximum +20). If the attack roll

fails, the rebuke attempt is spent and wasted.

Vile Feats

Vile feats were rst introduced in the Book of Vile Darkness.

Only intelligent characters of evil alignment can use vile feats.

Vile feats are granted to characters at the behest of a powerful

evil agencya god, demon, or something similar. As such, vile

feats are supernatural abilities rather than extraordinary abilities.

Some DMs might also want to require a character who seeks a

vile feat to perform a special ritual or make an actual bargain

with a powerful creature of evil. The patron creature could even

(at the DMs discretion) have the ability to revoke the feat should

the character displease it.

This chapter reproduces three vile feats from Book of Vile

Darkness (Disciple of Darkness, Evil Brand, and Thrall to

Demon) and introduces several new ones.

Demonsworn Knight [Vile]

A scornful champion of the demon princes, you detest and oppose

devils and other creatures that refuse to heed the call of chaos.

Prerequisites: Thrall to Demon, base attack bonus +4.

Benet: Any weapon you wield is treated as chaotic- and

evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In

addition, against lawful outsiders, you deal an extra 1d6 points

of damage with any successful weapon attack.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Hellbound Knight or Tor-

mented Knight feat. A ghter can select this feat as one of his

ghter bonus feats. In addition, your eyes turn dead black, and

your teeth become as sharp as fangs.

22

Tools of Evil

obedience, you gain a small measure of the archdevils power.

Prerequisites: Lawful evil alignment.

Benet: Once per day, while performing an evil act, you can

call upon your diabolic patron to add a +1 luck bonus to any

one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, skill check, or level

check.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Scion of Sorrow or Thrall

to Demon feat.

Evil Brand [Vile]

You are physically marked forever as a servant of an evil power

greater than yourself or as a villain who does not care that you

seek only death, destruction, and misery for others. The symbol is

unquestionable in its perversity, depicting a depravity so unthink-

able that all who see it know beyond a doubt that the bearer is

forever in the sway of the blackest powers.

Benet: Evil creatures automatically recognize the symbol

now emblazoned upon you as a sign of your utter depravity or

discipleship to a powerful patron, although the specic identity of

the patron is not revealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on

Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made against evil creatures.

Evil Embraced [Vile]

You embrace the power of your endish patron and call upon

that power in moments of great need.

Prerequisites: Evil Brand.

Benet: Once per day, as an immediate action (see page 21),

you can call upon your endish patron to steel you against harm.

You gain damage reduction 10/good for 1 round (until the start

of your next turn).

Hellbound Knight [Vile]

A devoted disciple of the Nine Hells, you have sworn to strike

down creatures that oppose law and threaten tyranny.

Prerequisites: Disciple of Darkness, base attack bonus +4.

Benet: Any weapon you wield is treated as lawful- and evil-

aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In

addition, against chaotic outsiders, you gain a +1 profane bonus

on attack rolls.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Demonsworn Knight or

Tormented Knight feat. A ghter can select this feat as one of

his ghter bonus feats. In addition, as soon as you take this feat,

your eyes turn red.

Scion of Sorrow [Vile]

You formally supplicate yourself to a powerful yugoloth lord. In

return for your uninching obedience, you gain a small measure

of the wretched ends power.

Prerequisites: Neutral evil alignment.

Benet: Once per day, while performing an evil act, you can call

upon your endish patron to add a +1 luck bonus to any one attack

roll, saving throw, ability check, skill check, or level check.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Disciple of Darkness or Thrall

to Demon feat.

Thrall to Demon [Vile]

You formally supplicate yourself to a demon prince. In return

for this obedience, you gain a small measure of the demon

princes power.

Prerequisites: Chaotic evil alignment.

Benet: Once per day, while performing an evil act, you

can call upon your demonic patron to add a +1 luck bonus to

any one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, skill check, or

level check.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Disciple of Darkness or Scion

of Sorrow feat.

Tormented Knight [Vile]

You are inexorably bound to the loathsome yugoloths that lurk

in the Barrens of Doom and Despair, and you strive to bring

misery and pain to all creatures that oppose them.

Prerequisites: Scion of Sorrow, base attack bonus +4.

Benet: Any weapon you wield is treated as evil-aligned for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Any chaotic or

lawful outsider you successfully damage with a melee or ranged

weapon must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt)

or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage.

Special: This feat can only be taken once. A character who

takes this feat cannot also take the Demonsworn Knight or

Hellbound Knight feat. A ghter can select this feat as one of his

ghter bonus feats. In addition, as soon as you take this feat, your

esh turns pale and becomes unnaturally cold to the touch.

Initiate Feats

Initiate feats give additional focus and avor to divine spellcasters

of specic gods. Often, they grant access to unique spells only

known to the most devout servants of these deities. Initiate feats

for several prominent evil deities are presented below. Players

Guide to Faern contains initiate feats for a few other evil deities,

namely Bane, Cyric, and Malar.

Initiate of Ghaunadaur [Initiate]

jellies, and outcasts.

Prerequisites: Cleric level 3rd, patron deity Ghaunadaur.

commands or rebukes undead. You can use this supernatural ability

a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modier.

5th

Initiate of Shar [Initiate]

You have been initiated into the greatest secrets of Shars

church.

Fiend Lords and Spells

A number of powerful fiends serve as patrons for clerics

and other divine spellcasters. Clerics following Asmodeus,

Baphomet, Demogorgon, Orcus, Yeenoghu, and other such

creatures often lead bloodthirsty cults of like-minded follow-

ers. However, these powerful demons and devils do not have

any divine ranks and lack the ability to grant cleric spells as

gods normally do.

There is a way around this limitation. A character can

strike a special bargain with a powerful fiend, which gives

the fiend the ability to grant spells to that character from

a choice of domains. In effect, a powerful fiend can serve

as a conduit for certain universal principles or the nascent

divine power of its own extraplanar home, but only for

mortals who agree to the dark and insidious bargain it

offers. This bargain is represented by one of three feats:

Disciple of Darkness, Scion of Sorrow, or Thrall to Demon

(see Vile Feats, page 22). A character with cleric levels

who chooses one of these feats can choose domains made

available by the particular demon, yugoloth, or devil he

chooses as his patron, and he receives his cleric spells from

that dark entity.

The vast majority of evil clerics choose gods for patrons,

since they need not use a feat to simply gain access to cleric

spells with a divine patron. But devil lords and demon princes

crave the adulation of mortals, tooand many seek out indi-

viduals willing to give them the adulation they crave.

24

Tools of Evil

Prerequisite: Able to cast 1st-level divine spells, patron

deity Shar.

Benet: You add Bluff and Hide to your list of class skills.

Crushing Despair: Subject takes 2 on attack rolls,

Armor of DarknessFRCS: Creates a shroud of shadow

Initiate of Varae [Initiate]

You fervently worship Varae, the serpentine goddess, and guard

well the secrets of your faith.

Prerequisites: Extaminaar, cleric level 3rd, patron deity

Varae.

Benet: Once per day, as a standard action, you can transform

your skin into shimmering emerald scales. The scales absorb

magic missile damage as the shield spell, and they enable you

to pass through walls of force as if they werent there. The

emerald scales last for 1 minute per character level. This is a

supernatural ability.

In addition, you add the following spells to your cleric

spell list.

Node Magic Feats

The node magic feats presented here originally appeared in

Underdark. These versions update and supersede those in the

previous product.

Metanode Spell [Metamagic]

You cast metamagic spells to greater effect in nodes to which

you are attuned than elsewhere.

Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.

Benet: When casting a spell improved by a metamagic feat,

you can deduct the class of the node layer in which you currently

stand from the increased spell level. The class of the layer does

not equal the class of the node unless you are standing in the

innermost portion of it.

For example, if you use Maximize Spell to augment the 5th-

level spell ame strike in the innermost (+1) layer of a Class 1

node, you cast the spell as if it were only two levels higher than

normal, not three, because the node pays one spell levels worth

of the metamagic cost. This feat is most useful to casters who

do not prepare spells (such as bards and sorcerers) and to wizards

who rarely leave their nodes and can therefore prepare and cast

their spells at the adjusted level.

If you use this feat to reduce the cost of preparing a metamagic

spell and then leave the node, the spell you prepared is unavailable

until you return to a node layer of at least the same class as the

one in which the spell was prepared.

Node Defense

You can use the magical power of a node to defend yourself

from harm.

Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.

Benet: You receive an insight bonus to your Armor Class

and on saving throws equal to the class of any node that you

currently occupy and to which you are attuned, up to a maximum

of +4. For example, if you are inside the middle (+2) layer of a

Class 3 node, you gain a +2 bonus.

Node Sensitive

You can perceive a node just by passing near it.

Benet: You automatically note the presence of any node to

which you are attuned within 30 feet.

Normal: A creature without this feat that comes within 30

feet of the outermost layer of a node can make a DC 20 Intel-

ligence check to note the presence of the node. A creature with

the appropriate Node Spellcasting feat can attempt either an

Intelligence check or a Spellcraft check at the same DC to notice

the node.

Node Spellcasting

You have discovered the secret of the magic of a particular type

of node.

Prerequisite: Caster level 1st.

Benet: You are attuned to one type of node and the magi-

cal power it provides. When you choose this feat, choose a

type of node (earth, evil, or Shadow Weave). This feat grants

you access to the various node magic feats and node powers,

and allows you to make a Spellcraft check instead of an Intel-

ligence check to notice nearby nodes of the type to which you

are attuned.

Normal: A creature without this feat cannot take other node-

related feats, cannot access a nodes full potential, and must make

an Intelligence check to notice nearby nodes or to manipulate

node powers.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you

take the feat, it attunes you to a different node type.

25

Tools of Evil

Node Store

You can store a prepared spell in a node to which you are attuned.

Prerequisite: Node Spellcasting, caster level 1st.

Benet: Each time you take this feat, choose two spells of

any level that you know and can cast. If you are a spellcaster

who prepares spells, you can now prepare those two spells in ad-

dition to your normal spell complement as long as you are in a

node to which you are attuned, just as if you had two extra spell

slots per day. These extra prepared spells are stored in the node

instead of in your mind. You can cast them normally while you

are within that node, even if you have left the node and returned

since storing them there.

If you are a spellcaster who does not prepare spells, choose

two spells that you know. You can now cast those two spells while

in a node to which you are attuned as if you had two extra spell

slots per day available. Each such slot can be used only to cast its

designated spell; it cannot be used for any other spell (including

the other spell designated with this feat). If you leave the node,

these extra spell slots become unavailable to you, but you can

use them again if you return, provided that you havent already

used them since the last time you rested.

You do not need to designate a specic node in which to store

your spells when you choose this feat, but you can have spells

stored in only one node at a time. You can change the node in

which your spells are stored by meditating for 1 hour inside the

new node you have selected.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you

take the feat, it applies to two new spells.

New Spells

Magic and spells occupy a role of central importance in Faern,

a world rich with arcane and divine elements. Empires often

rise and fall based on the power of their spellcasters. Champions

of Ruin presents a wide selection of spells with a focus on evil,

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: S, M/DF

Duration: 2 hours/level; see text

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures can breathe air freely. Divide the

duration evenly among all the creatures you touch.

The spell does not make creatures unable to breathe water.

Air breathing dispels and counters water breathing.

Arcane Material Component: A short reed or piece of straw.

Anathema

Enchantment (Compulsion)

Level: Cleric 9, druid 9

Components: V, S, F, DF

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Unlimited

Target: One creature of the same faith as the spellcaster

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You can permanently break the divine link between your deity

and a lower-level cleric, druid, ranger or paladin of your faith, or

upon a common worshiper. The spell has no effect on spellcasters

of a faith other than your own. You can pronounce an anathema

upon any character of your faith, no matter where he is, even

if on a different plane. You cannot pronounce an anathema

against someone who is already dead. Some deities do not allow

an anathema to be pronounced against the innocent or against

their chosen, while others grant their high-level clerics free use

of this most terrible of divine curses.

An individual under anathema can no longer cast divine spells

or call upon the power of his god to turn or command undead,

heal, harm, smite, shape change, or use any other divine power

associated with his character class. An ordinary worshiper placed

under anathema is not allowed to take advantage of any of the

faiths services, such as healing, naming, marrying, or burial of

the dead. Anyone who dies while under anathema is barred from

entry into his deitys plane just as though he had never declared

allegiance to a god. His soul is condemned to eternally writhe in

the Wall of the Faithless.

On a more personal level, the anathema spell marks the

subject as accursed with regard to others of the faith. They are

not allowed to speak to him, look at him, or even acknowledge

his existence. The common members of the faith are only aware

that the subject is under anathema if so informed by the church

hierarchy; however, clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the

faith can automatically detect an anathema effect simply by

looking at the subject.

The effect is permanent until lifted, either by the original

spellcaster, or by a cleric of the same faith, of a higher level than

the caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject. The

subject of an anathema can also remove its effect by changing

his divine allegiance (see Changing Deities, page 233 of the

Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting).

Focus: The subjects name must be inscribed in a book or scroll

especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes

(real or imagined) for which the subject is being condemned. The

book is not consumed in the process.

Components: V, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, causing it

to split in mid-ight into 1d4+1 identical masterwork arrows

or bolts. All the missiles strike the same target, and you must

make a separate attack roll for each missile. The arrow or bolt

must be red during the same round the spell is cast, or the

magic dissipates and is lost. The projectile is destroyed even if it

misses its target.

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

By means of this spell you draw a visible, unholy line in the

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Gruumsh 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Spear touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You summon a mischievous spirit and send it to bedevil your

enemy. The spirit seeks out its assigned victim wherever she might

be, as long as she is on the same plane as you when you cast the

spell. It then proceeds to irritate and annoy her through a variety

of manifestations. The victim of a bedevil spell nds herself

constantly seeing movement out of the corner of her eye. Her

sleep is frequently interrupted by bed shaking and blanket shifting

and the sounds of voices that fade upon waking. When spellcast-

ing, she suffers a variety of minor irritations that threaten to

disrupt her spells, and she constantly feels haunted and watched.

The result of this bedevilment is that she takes a 1 penalty on

all ability checks, skill checks, and Will saving throws and has

a 5% chance of arcane spell failure (which stacks with any spell

failure chance from armor worn).

Detect evil cast upon the subject of this spell reveals the

presence of the bedeviling spirit, while protection from evil keeps

the spirit from adversely affecting the victim. A dispel evil spell

destroys the mischievous spirit, but remove curse or similar magic

has no effect on it.

Material Components: A tiny iron statuette of a devil or imp,

plus either a drop of the intended victims blood or one personal

article belonging to the intended victim.

Bloodfreeze Arrow

Transmutation

Level: Assassin 4, ranger 4, justice of weald and woe 4

Components: V, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming

its head into blue ice. In addition to taking normal damage from

the missile, the target takes 2d6 points of cold damage and is

paralyzed. A successful Fortitude save negates the paralysis, and

the target can make a new save each round (at the start of the

casters turn).

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

This spell allows you to channel the fury of Gruumsh into the gods

favored weapona spear. The weapons tip begins to drip blood, and

the spear acts as if it had the wounding special ability (see Dungeon

Masters Guide page 226) for the duration of the spell. The spell is

automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand.

You cannot have more than one bloodspear in effect at a time.

This spell has no effect on a spear that already has the wound-

ing special ability, and it does not work on artifacts.

Brilliant Energy Arrow

Transmutation

Level: Assassin 2, ranger 2, justice of weald and woe 2

Components: V, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming

its head into brilliant energy that gives off light as a torch (20-

foot radius). A brilliant energy missile ignores nonliving matter.

Armor bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that

armor) do not count against it because the missile passes through

armor. It deals normal damage and has no effect on constructs,

undead, and objects. The arrow or bolt must be red during the

same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost.

The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

Control Darkness and Shadow

Transmutation [Darkness, Shadow]

Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

Area: Shadows in one 5-ft. cube/level

Duration: Concentration + 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

29

Tools of Evil

You can affect existing shadows, both natural and magical, by

causing them to deepen, lighten, or even move. You can cause

one of the following effects at a time, and can switch them once

per round as a free action for the duration of the spell. The

chosen effect covers the entire area of the spell; multiple effects

may not be applied to different areas. The possible effects are

described below.

Deepen Darkness and Shadow: Normal shadows now grant

a +4 bonus on Hide checks and provide concealment to creatures

within them. Magical darkness now confers total concealment

to anyone within its area.

Lighten Darkness and Shadow: Normal shadows are sup-

pressed within the area, making it impossible to hide within them

or use abilities such as the shadowdancers shadow jump ability.

Magical darkness no longer provides concealment, and the area

can now be illuminated by any light source.

Move Shadow: The affected shadow moves as you direct

within the area. You can create shadow illusions (as those created

by a silent image spell, but without color), reveal hidden creatures

by taking their shadow away, cause shadows to follow you within

the area of the spell, or otherwise move the shadow as you see

t. You cannot move areas of darkness in this way.

Darkflame Arrow

Evocation

Level: Assassin 3, justice of weald and woe 3, ranger 3

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, engulng its

head in black re. The arrow deals normal damage and wreaths

the target in black ame that deals an extra 2d6 points of damage.

The black ames continue to engulf the victim for 2 more rounds,

dealing 2d6 points of damage each subsequent round (at the start

of your turn), and they cannot be extinguished (although they can

be dispelled). The arrow or bolt must be red during the same

round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost. Creatures

with immunity or resistance to re take full damage from the

black ames. The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This spell is cast upon a single arrow or crossbow bolt, enabling it

to strike two targets instead of one. The character ring the arrow

selects the two targets, both of which must be within 30 feet of

each other, and makes a separate attack roll against each target

(using the same attack bonus). After striking or missing the rst

target, the arrow

swerves and continues

on course to the second target.

Enrage Animals

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Druid 1, ranger 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: Animals within 30 ft. of each other

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Effect: Cone-shaped burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

With this spell, you create a cone of music that draws upon the

sadness, guilt, and despair of those within its area of effect. All

creatures in the area take a 4 penalty on Listen checks for 1

round. In addition, those who fail to save against loves lament

are reminded of all their lost loves and disappointments in life.

The music seizes upon these feelings and magnies them, so that

the victims of the spell take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and

are nauseated for 1d4 rounds.

This spell incites and enrages animals, making them hostile and

vicious. Only ordinary animals (those with Intelligence scores of

1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. The maximum number of

Hit Dice of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + your caster

level. A dire animal or an animal trained only to attack on order

is allowed a saving throw; other animals are not. For example,

a ranger could enrage a normal bear or wolf with little trouble,

but its more difcult to drive a trained guard dog into a frenzy

so that it attacks its master.

The affected creatures attack the nearest creature, including

any other creatures affected by this spell.

Mantle of the Slime Lord

Abjuration

Level: Initiate of Ghaunadaur 7

Components: V, S, DF

Locate Node

Divination

Level: Cleric 3, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, F/DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 1 mile/level; see text

Area: Circle, centered on you, with a radius of 1 mile/level; see text

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You sense the direction of any node within range. You can choose

to locate the nearest node, the closest node of a particular type,

or a specic node you have visited before; in the latter case, the

range is 2 miles/level and the area is a circle, centered on you,

with a radius of 2 miles/level.

The spell is blocked by even a thin sheet of lead, and it cannot

detect nodes protected by a node lock spell.

Arcane or Divine Focus: A pebble found in a node.

Loves Lament

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 3

Components: V

This spell causes a glossy nimbus of energy to surround you.

This barrier looks like a gelatinous layer of thick, dirty water

to observers, but it does not hinder you in the least. While the

mantle is active, nonintelligent oozes will not attack you unless

you attack them. In addition, you gain immunity to poison, sleep

effects, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. Lastly, when

a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on you, there is a 75%

chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage

is instead rolled normally.

Mark of the Unfaithful

Evocation

Level: Cleric 7, druid 7

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Unlimited

Target: One creature

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You permanently place a mark upon a character or creature

that identies it as an enemy of the faith. Anyone of your faith

who encounters the bearer of a mark of the unfaithful, even if

he is disguised, altered, or polymorphed, feels a natural hostility

31

Tools of Evil

toward that person and gains a +6 circumstance bonus on Sense

Motive checks made against the marked creature. This hostility

might not induce the viewer to attack, but he certainly will not

be inclined to trust or believe anything the marked one says.

Clerics, paladins, druids and rangers of the faith can automati-

cally detect the mark simply by looking at the subject.

A mark of the unfaithful is permanent until dispelled or

removed by a cleric of the same faith, of higher level than the

caster, who casts an atonement spell upon the subject.

Focus: The subjects name must be inscribed in a book or scroll

especially consecrated for this purpose and detailing the crimes

(real or imagined) for which the subject is being marked.

Node Door

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Varies; see text

Target: You and touched objects or other touched willing

creatures

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: No and Yes (object)

You instantly transfer yourself from your current node to any

other node of the same type that you have visited. You always

arrive at the exact spot desiredwhether by simply visualizing

the area or by describing your destination (for example, the

Shadow Weave node in the garden at the Temple of Old Night).

After using this spell, you cant take any other actions until

your next turn.

If you arrive in a node that is already partially occupied

by a newly added object, you arrive in the closest clear space

in that node. If the node is completely lled or has been

destroyed by any means, you bounce to the next closest node

of the same type (determined randomly or by the DM). Each

such bounce deals 2d6 points of damage to you and any who

accompany you.

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnt

exceed your maximum load. You can also bring one additional

willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up

to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels;

a Large creature counts as two Medium

creatures, a Huge creature counts as two

Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures

to be transported must be in contact with

one another, and at least one of those

creatures must be in contact with

you. As with all spells for which

the range is personal and the

target is you, you need not make

a saving throw, nor is spell re-

sistance applicable to you. Only

objects held or in use (attended)

by another person receive saving

throws and spell resistance.

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You imbue a humanoid skull with negative energy and hurl it.

The skull detonates on impact, releasing the negative energy con-

tained within. All creatures in

the spells area, except for

undead, gain 1d4 negative

levels (see Energy Drain,

page 308 of the Monster

Manual, for details

about negative

levels).

Assuming a

creature survives

the effect of the

spell, it regains

lost levels after

a number of hours

equal to your cast-

er level (maximum

15 hours). Usually,

negative levels have

a chance of draining

a creatures levels, but the

negative levels from necrotic

do so.

An undead creature in the spells area gains 1d45 temporary

hit points for 1 hour.

Tools of Evil

Node Genesis

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, XP

Casting Time: 1 tenday (8 hours/day)

Range: Touch

Effect: One Class 1 node with a 10-ft. radius

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

When you cast this spell, the arcane energies reroute local ley lines

and telluric currents, precipitating the creation of a Class 1 node

(you determine the type when you cast the spell). The new node is

centered on and emanates from a point on the ground you touch.

The rough boundary of the new node can cross any type of terrain

or empty space, and can cross different types of materials. You

have some leeway in determining the initial shape of your nodes

outer boundaryit doesnt have to be a perfect sphere.

The newly generated node retains its Class 1 status for one

year. Thereafter, its diameter increases at rate of 20 feet per year,

until it eventually reaches a diameter equal to 20 feet per the

caster level you possessed at the time of casting. When the nodes

diameter reaches the low end of the range for the next higher

class (see Table 51 on page 96), its class increases by +1. For

example, a Class 1 node becomes Class 2 when its diameter reaches

40 feet, and Class 3 when its diameter reaches 120 feet.

Nodes you create with this spell are automatically considered

node locked by you. They are otherwise just like natural nodes

and subject to destruction in the same ways.

XP Cost: 5,000 XP.

Special: You must have the Node Spellcasting feat to cast this

spell.

Pocket Cave

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Initiate of Gruumsh 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Extradimensional cave, up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You conjure up an extradimensional cave that has a single entrance

on the plane from which the spell was cast. You can only cast

this spell on a surface made of rock or some form of earth. The

entry point looks like a dark cave entrance that is 4 feet wide

and 8 feet high. Only those you designate can enter the cave, and

the portal is shut and made invisible behind you when you enter.

You can open it again from your side at will. Creatures entering

the cave will nd themselves in a dark, wet cavern. The place

contains enough oxygen to sustain as many creatures as can t in

the area for the duration of the spell. Edible fungus grows along

the walls, and condensation drips down one wall into a pool of

fresh, clean water that never seems to run dry.

External conditions such as weather do not affect the pleas-

ant atmosphere of the cave, and nothing except the designated

creatures can pass through the portal in either direction. At the

end of the spells duration, all within the pocket cave return to

the spot where they entered the cave or else to the nearest open

space, if that spot is occupied.

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 10-ft.-radius cylinder, 40 ft. high

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

A node lock spell cast upon a node magically locks it against

others who might wish to use its power. You can affect a node

whose class is equal to one-half your caster level or less. For any

caster except you, a node lock adds +15 to each Spellcraft DC as-

sociated with the use of the nodes standard powers. In addition,

the node cannot be detected by a locate node spell. A successful

dispel magic breaks a node lock.

A terrible column of swirling black energy engulfs creatures

and rips at their bodies and souls. All living creatures within

the spells area take 1d6 points of vile damage per two caster

levels (maximum 10d6). Unlike regular damage, vile damage

can only be healed by magic cast within the area of a consecrate

or hallow spell.

Tools of Evil

Remorseless Charm

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Evil, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 5, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft + 5ft./2 levels)

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell eliminates normal inhibitions and silences the subjects

conscience. Under its effects, a good creature might commit acts

of extraordinary evil without any feelings of remorse. For instance,

a paladin who strives to never destroy a foe that has surrendered

might decide that shes better off meting out justice immediately

and killing the enemy. This spell affects the targets norms and

expections; for example, once affected, a good-aligned target might

be willing to attack his friends when urged to do so through a sug-

gestion. This would not eliminate his need to atone, according to

the tenets and punishments prescribed by his faith or law.

The compulsion is permanent until broken by a break en-

chantment spell or similar magic, or until it is removed by the

spellcaster.

Material Component: One piece of masterwork artwork of at

least 1,000 gp in value. The artwork must depict acts of debauchery

or evil that are titillating and fascinating, not disturbing or revolt-

ing. The spell is cast upon the artwork, which is then revealed to

the subject of the spell, triggering its effects. The enchantment on

the artwork lasts for 1 day per spellcaster level, much like a symbol,

until it is viewed and its magical effect is triggered.

Scourge of Force

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft/2 levels)

Effect: One tendril of force plus one additional tendril per

three caster levels (maximum four)

Targets: One or more targets, no two of which can be more

than 30 ft. apart

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

One or more whiplike tendrils of force spring from your hand

and lash targets within range. Make a melee touch attack for

each tendril using your highest attack bonus. If a tendril hits, it

deals 1d8 points of force damage plus 1 point of force damage

per two caster levels (maximum 1d8+5). You can lash a target

with multiple tendrils.

Target: Up to eight projectiles, all of which must be within

40 ft. of each other at the time of casting; see text

Duration: Up to 10 min./level; see text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You transform wooden arrows, darts, or twigs into Tiny vipers

(see Monster Manual page 200). These missiles remain rigid

and harmless until red or hurled. They automatically bite any

creature they hit, each dealing 1 point of damage plus poison

(injury, Fortitude DC 11, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con).

The missiles remain in snake form for the duration of the spell,

ghting the creatures they initially struck using their normal

attack bonus. If a missile misses its target, or the target originally

struck moves out of reach, the snake moves to attack the nearest

creature other than you. If a target falls dead and no others are

in range, the spell ends even if its duration has not run out. When

the spell expires, the vipers melt away, leaving nothing behind.

Material Components: Up to eight wooden arrows, darts, or

straight twigs, plus a scale from any sort of snake.

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming

it into pure black shadow. Make a ranged touch attack with the

missile instead of a normal ranged attack. Instead of dealing

normal damage, a shadow arrow deals 1d6 points of Strength

damage. The arrow or bolt must be red during the same round

the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost. The projectile

is destroyed even if it misses its target.

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

34

Tools of Evil

Range: Touch

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Reex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

With this spell, you place a magic trap on any object that casts a

shadow. If the object is disturbed in any way that causes its shadow

to shift (for instance, if it or a nearby light source is moved), a

bound greater shadow (see Monster Manual page 221) emerges

from the objects shadow to attack the nearest living creature.

The shadow can be turned or destroyed as normal; otherwise, it

remains for a number of rounds equal to your caster level. If the

trapped object resides in a place that has no shadows, the trap

does not trigger, although the spell remains in effect.

Material Component: A sheet of black cloth large enough to

drape over the warded object.

Slashing Darkness

Evocation

Level: Clr 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Ray

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

A hissing, hurtling ribbon of pure darkness ies from your

hand. A creature struck by this ray of darkness takes 1d8 points

of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8). An undead

creature instead heals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels

(maximum 5d8).

Slime Hurl

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Initiate of Ghaunadaur 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Three globs of green slime

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You conjure and hurl three roughly spherical globs of dark green

slime. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target

with a slime glob (roll separately for each glob, using your best

ranged attack bonus). Any creature struck by a glob is coated in

a patch of green slime (see Dungeon Masters Guide page 76) and

begins to experience its effects immediately. You can hit a creature

with multiple globs, each of which must be dealt with separately.

35

The conjured green slime does not disappear automatically and

must be destroyed in the normal way.

Spellslayer Arrow

Transmutation

Level: Assassin 2, justice of weald and woe 2, ranger 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming

it into a glowing missile that destabilizes other forms of magic.

In addition to dealing normal damage, a spellslayer arrow deals

an extra 1d4 points of damage for each ongoing spell currently in

effect on the target. For example, an arrow would deal an extra

3d4 points of damage to a creature under the effects of bulls

strength, haste, and mage armor. The arrow or bolt must be red

during the same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and

is lost. The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.

Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.

Symphonic Nightmare

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 6

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: 1 day/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

A creature targeted by this spell loses the ability to dream during

sleep or rest. Rather, in place of dreams, the targets slumbering

mind is lled with the sounds of a discordant orchestra. After

the victims rst attempt to sleep, he incurs a 2 penalty on all

Wisdom-based skill checks. This penalty persists as long as the

symphonic nightmare effect maintains its hold on him. This spell

affects all creatures that sleep or enter sleeplike trances; creatures

without the need to sleep are effectively immune.

In addition, the creatures sleep is now haunted. It can no

longer gain complete rest from sleeping or resting. The target

does not regain hit points or heal ability damage naturally, nor is

it able to prepare spells if doing so requires a full nights rest. The

creature is, however, now immune to the dream and nightmare

spells, as well as to other effects that cause nightmares (such as

the night hags dream haunting ability).

Tools of Evil

The caster can lift the effect of this curse at will, but it is

otherwise difcult to remove a symphonic nightmare before its

duration expires. A remove curse cast at a higher caster level than

the symphonic nightmare spell removes it, as does a successful break

enchantment. Otherwise, a wish or miracle is required to lift the

curse.

Focus: A small statue of an opened skull within which is

arranged a miniature orchestra. The quality of this component

must be extraordinary, giving it a value of at least 1,000 gp.

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level

When you cast this spell, a familiar and soothing song wells up

in your mind. The song does not distract you from any task at

handon the contrary, by humming along to the tune you can

focus your mind with ease. As long as this spell is in effect, you

can use any Perform check in place of a Concentration check. You

must decide which skill to use before any check is made.

Tvash-Prulls

Bonefiddle

Necromancy

Level: Bard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature that has a skeleton or

exoskeleton

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round/

level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Unholy beast

You call up a ghostly ddle bow in

the air above the targeted creature.

This bow immediately descends

into the subjects body and begins to

saw back and forth against its skeleton.

Although the music produced is eerily beauti-

ful, it causes intense pain and anguish to the victim.

In each round of the duration, the victim takes

1d6 points of sonic damage and has a 20 penalty on all Move

Silently checks; the sonic damage is considered to be continuous

damage for the purposes of disrupting spellcasting. As a standard

action, you can move the boneddle to another creature in range,

but the new target gains a saving throw to resist the spell. If a

target ever makes its saving throw, the boneddle vanishes and

the spell ends. The spells effects continue even if the target

moves so you no longer have line of sight or line of effect to it,

but you cannot shift the boneddle to a new target unless you

have both line of sight and line of effect to the current target

and to the intended target.

Material Component: A miniature silver ddle worth at least

30 gp.

duration of the spell. The

animals  limbs  and  face

contort, it sprouts tusks and

bone spurs through its skin, and

Dexterity, and Constitution, and a +2 bonus to

natural armor. Furthermore, the damage

of its natural attacks increases as

An unholy beast serves you as if

it were under the inuence of a

Whip of Thorns

Transmutation

Level: Druid 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: 15-foot-long whip covered with sharp thorns

Duration: 1 round/level, or until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

When you cast this spell, a piece of vine grows into a thorn-stud-

ded whip capable of savagely ripping your opponents esh. You

36

Tools of Evil

can wield this whip as if you were procient, and it follows all

the rules for a whip except that it deals 1d8+1 points of lethal

damage per strike. Any time you strike a Large or smaller

opponent successfully with the whip, you can release it and

entangle the creature. Doing this ends the spell, but the thorny

vine continues to wrap around your enemy until the opponent

breaks free with a successful Escape Artist check (DC equal to

the save DC of the spell). On a failed check, the creature takes

an additional 1d4 points of damage and remains entangled. On

a successful check that exceeds the DC by 10 or less, the creature

takes the additional damage in the process of freeing itself. A

creature can also attempt to burst the vine with a DC 20 Strength

check, although it takes 1d4 points of damage whether or not

the attempt succeeds.

Material Component: A tiny piece of vine.

Woodwisp Arrow

Transmutation

Level: Assassin 1, druid 1, justice of weald and woe 1, ranger 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Touch

Target: One masterwork arrow or bolt

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, enabling the

missile to pass through wood as though it was air, negating any

cover benet the target might enjoy because of wooden doors,

tables, or stockade walls, or negating the AC modier of a wooden

shield. The spell doesnt grant the spellcaster the ability to see

through wooden obstructions, so unless a clairvoyance spell or

similar magic is already in effect, the target is treated as having

concealment instead of cover. The arrow or bolt must be red

during the same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and

is lost. The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.

Epic Spells

The following spells were created using the special rules in

the Epic Level Handbook. They reveal new depths of magical

depravity and represent some of the most dreadful spells Faern

has ever endured.

Aumvors Fragmented

Phylactery

Transmutation

Spellcraft DC: 30

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Target: One or more objects, including the casters phylactery

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

To Develop: 210,000 gp; 5 days; 8,400 XP. Seeds: transform

(DC 21), ward (DC 14). Mitigating factors: eld specializa-

tion (5).

This spell can only be cast by a lich. It either separates the lichs

phylactery into multiple objects or expands the phylactery to

include multiple objects, as determined by the spellcaster. The

number of such objects can be no greater than the casters modi-

er for its spellcasting ability (Charisma for a sorcerer, Intelligence

for a wizard). Thereafter, destroying the lichs phylactery requires

the destruction of the whole set of objects that comprise the

phylactery. As long as at least one such object of the set exists,

the caster cannot be permanently killed.

This spell can be cast repeatedly on a phylactery or part

thereof. Each time it is cast, the number of objects that comprise

the lichs phylactery can be increased by an amount equal to the

casters modier for its spellcasting ability.

Aumvors Soulshatter

Necromancy

Spellcraft DC: 51

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 300 ft.

Target: One living creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

To Develop: 357,000 gp; 8 days; 14,280 XP. Seeds: slay (DC

25), animate dead (DC 23). Factors: creating a ghost (+8).

Mitigating factors: seed within specialist school (5).

For any one living creature within range, you separate soul from

its body. The target is entitled to a DC 51 Fortitude save to survive

the attack. If the save is successful, the creature instead takes

3d6+20 points of damage. If the save is failed, the subjects soul is

dead and passes on to the afterlife, but the body remains alive.

After the successful casting of this spell, the body of the crea-

ture can then be possessed (as by a magic jar spell) or dominated

(as by a dominate person spell) without resistance (automatic

saving throw failure). The body retains the physical characteristics

(Strength, Dexterity, Constution, skills based on those abilities,

and extraordinary abilities) of the departed soul but otherwise

reects the abilities and skills of the possessor or dominator. If

not possessed or dominated, the body lies dormantalive, but

lacking an animating force.

The soul can be returned to the body by means of a raise dead

or resurrection spell at any time. The passage of time has no effect

on the success of either spell, assuming the body is still alive.

Tools of Evil

Bonfire of Insanity (Ritual)

Necromancy [Chaotic, Evil, Vile]

Spellcraft DC: 217

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 1-mile radius

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

Development: 1,953,000 gp, 39 days, 78,120 XP; Seeds:

animate dead (DC 23), slay (DC 25); Factors: area effect

(+15) to 20-ft. radius (+2) increased 800% (+32), additional

160 HD (+160); Mitigating factors: increase casting time

(20), ghouls (10), uncontrolled undead (10)

A bonre is built of human bones and burned during a rain-

storm while this spell is cast. The smoke from the re rises

up and mingles with the rain clouds, lling them with vile

power. As the tainted water rains down and soaks the ground,

up to sixty corpses within range rise up as ghouls. Even

skeletal remains are affected. The corpses receive no saving

throw against the spells effects, not even if they are buried

in consecrated ground.

Humanoids (including the spellcasters) of up to 80 HD that

are touched by the vile rain must make a Fortitude saving throw

or be aficted with a magical disease that turns them into esh-

starved ghouls within 24 hours. The disease is resistant to all

forms of magical healing less powerful than a heal spell.

The total Hit Dice worth of undead created from this spell,

both from corpses and living creatures, is 180.

The spell does not grant the spellcaster any ability to control

the undead created by the spell. These undead can be commanded,

rebuked, or turned normally.

Material Component: A bonre, at least 10 feet in diameter, made

out of the remains of at least twenty humanoids. These remains are

destroyed by the re and are unaffected by the vile rain.

Cataract of Fire

Evocation [Fire]

Spellcraft DC: 204

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: 0 ft.

Area: 300-ft.-radius cylinder, 2,000 ft. tall; see text

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

Development: 1,836,000 gp, 37 days, 73,440 XP; Seeds:

energy (DC 19), destroy (DC 29); Factors: increased

damage die (+40), increased damage (+70), cylinder (+2),

increase area (+18), maximized (+28); Mitigating factor:

personal (2)

This spell is similar to the ame strike spell, in that a pillar of

magical re descends upon the target. The difference is the size

and destructive power of the spell, and its magical source. A

cataract of re delivers 500 points of damage, equally divided

between elemental re and raw magical energy, to everything

within a 300-foot radius centered on the spellcaster, 250 points

of damage to everything outside the 300-foot radius but within a

600-foot radius, and 100 points of damage to everything else out

to a quarter-mile. The pillar reaches well into the clouds and can

be used to harm ying creatures. The nature of the spell grants

the spellcaster immunity to the magical damage but not the re

damage. A successful Reex saving throw halves the damage.

The magical energy affects even magical matter, energy

elds, and force effects that are normally only affected by a

disintegrate spell, such as Bigbys forceful hand, wall of force,

globe of invulnerability, and antimagic eld. Such effects are

automatically destroyed.

Material Component: A bronze gong, which is struck when

the spell is complete. The gong is consumed in the resulting

conagration.

Diluvial Torrent

Evocation [Water]

Spellcraft DC: 204

Components: V, S, M

height of 200 ft.; see text

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Reex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

Development: 1,836,000 gp, 37 days, 73,440 XP; Seeds:

energy (DC 19), destroy (DC 29), Factors: increased

damage die (+40), increased damage (+70), cylinder (+2),

increase area (+18), maximized (+28); Mitigating factor:

personal (2)

This spell is similar to the cataract of re spell, except that a

cylinder of magical water drops upon the target area. A diluvial

torrent delivers 500 points of damage, equally divided between

physical damage and damage from raw magical energy, to every-

thing within a 100-foot radius centered on the spellcaster, 250

points of damage to everything outside the 100-foot radius but

within a 300-foot radius, and 100 points of damage to everything

else out to 750 feet. The nature of the spell grants the spellcaster

immunity to the magical damage but not the physical damage.

A successful Reex saving throw halves the damage.

At the DMs discretion, creatures surviving the initial impact

of 628,000 cubic feet of water might also be subject to drowning

and/or being swept away by the resulting ood.

Material Component: A silver gong, which is struck when the

spell is complete. The gong is consumed in the resulting torrent.

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

Development: 1,062,000 gp, 22 days, 42,480 XP; Seeds: trans-

port (DC 27); Factors: interplanar (+4), unwilling target (+4),

area effect (+2), increase area (+16), area level dependent

(+25), damage/volume level dependent (+25), augment minor

magic item 10 (+40); Mitigating factor: loss of limb (25)

This spell causes everything within the area to become desic-

catedwithering plants, mummifying esh, drying up pools

and ponds, and turning lush land to dust. Any living thing,

not including the spellcaster, within the area takes 40 points of

dessication damage per spellcaster level.

The spell also absorbs 1,000 pounds (120 gallons) of water

per caster level from any standing or moving body of water.

Casting this spell permanently withers one of the spellcasters

limbs.

Necromantic Singularity

area radius (+2), increase area (+36); Mitigating factor:

destroy minor artifact (50)

This powerful spell brings into being a short-lived conduit be-

tween the Material Plane, the magical Weave, and the Negative

Energy Plane, allowing undiluted negative energy to spew into

the world. The energy instantly slays up to 1,000 HD worth

of living creatures. The spell kills creatures one at a time, in

order of proximity to the singularity, until all 1,000 HD are

accounted for.

Material Components: A sphere of annihilation. The sphere

is destroyed by the spell.

Magic Items

Evil characters and creatures employ almost all the magic items

and devices available to good beings. In addition, the items and

special abilities described below have great appeal to those who like

to dominate, horrify, or ay others. These items and abilities, while

not necessarily evil themselves, are ideally suited to evil use.

The expanded format for the descriptions that follow is

designed to add depth and detail to each item or ability. Some

items have a background in the lore of the Forgotten Realms

setting, which is provided where it applies. After the items physical

description is a prerequisite (if any) that a character must have

to make use of the item, followed by details on how its effect

is activated. Further game details, such as the benet the item

provides and its market price, follow thereafter.

armorsmith named Nirzayal crafted the rst suit to bear the

name Hellsteel, but other similar suits have appeared since, and

not all of them crafted in the ery pits of the Nine Hells. A DC

30 bardic knowledge or Gather Information check reveals that

a vengeance knight named Cordelia Flametongue (see page 71)

the scales of a remorhaz tempered in the res of the Nine Hells.

Red, marblelike veins run through it.

can use a warm re shield once per day. Any creature other than

the wearer that touches the armor for a full round (such as by

grappling or being grappled by the wearer) takes 1d6 points of

against the same creature during the same round deal an extra

2d6 points of damage (of the same type the weapon normally

dealsbludgeoning, piercing, or slashing). For example, Xokarus

the blackguard makes three attacks with his +1 ravenous greataxe,

hitting Andril the paladin all three times. The rst attack deals

normal damage, while the second and third attacks each deal an

extra 2d6 points of slashing damage.

Splitting

Any missile red from a splitting weapon, or an arrow or bolt

enchanted with the splitting ability, breaks into two identical

missiles before striking the intended target.

Description: V-shaped engravings adorn a splitting weapon

or splitting ammunition.

Activation: The splitting ability of a ranged weapon (must

be a bow, crossbow, arrow, or bolt) only functions if its wielder

has the Precise Shot feat.

Effect: Any arrow or bolt red from a splitting weapon

magically splits into two missiles in mid-ight. Both missiles are

identical, sharing the nonsplitting properties of the original mis-

sile; for example, a +1 splitting arrow splits into two +1 arrows in

mid-ight. Both missiles strike the same target. Make a separate

attack roll for each missile using the same attack bonus.

Specific Weapons

Villains and vicious characters enjoy weapons that inict pain

in creative or devastating ways. The following specic weapon is

usually preconstructed with the qualities described here.

Flensing Gauntlet

This hideous spiked gauntlet literally strips esh from its target.

Description: A ensing gauntlet is a ragged-looking, tattered

glove and armband of untanned humanoid skin. When the item

is activated, the eshy tatters writhe, and bony hooks sprout from

the palm and ngers. It is otherwise a +1 spiked gauntlet.

Activation: As a move action, curl your gloved hand into a

claw to activate the gauntlets. The effect lasts for 1 round. You

can activate the gauntlets up to three times per day.

Effect: A successful attack with an activated gauntlet tears a strip

of esh away from a living corporeal opponent, causing pain and

trauma that weakens as well as dealing damage. This effect occurs

even if the opponent is wearing armor. The opponent takes an extra

1d6 points of damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage and

1d4 points of Charisma damage. A Fortitude saving throw negates

the ability damage and halves the extra hit point damage.

Incorporeal creatures or creatures of a gaseous nature (such

as air elementals) are not affected by this item.

Wondrous Items

The following magic items are often found among the resources

of champions of ruin.

Camellia of the Black Lady

A beautiful ower that beguilesthen punishes.

Lore: A character who makes a DC 20 Knowledge (religion)

check knows that the Black Lady was a notorious assassin and

servant of Shar. She used subversion with beauty and poise, and

the scent of sweet owers.

42

Tools of Evil

Description: A camellia of the Black Lady is a creamy-white

blossom worn in the hair, taking up space on the body as a

headband or helmet. On close inspection, the inner whorls of the

ower suggest unsettling, depraved forms. The item has a sweet,

overpowering odor that carries a considerable distance.

Activation: The ower remains perpetually fragrant and

perfectly preserved. The wearer activates the blossoms dominate

person power by choosing a humanoid target and pressing the

stem (a standard action).

The poison effect activates automatically once the dominate

person effect ends.

Effect: When the designated target comes within 20 feet of

the wearer, he must make a DC 19 Will save (DC 21 if Selne

is his patron deity) or be captivated by a dominate person effect.

In addition, he is subjected to a remorseless charm effect (no

save) that stills his moral conscience. The victim must follow the

instructions of the wearer, no matter how dreadful those orders

might be. The subject remains in the thrall of the wearer for

nine days, until the dominate person effect is dispelled, or until

the camellia of the Black Lady is destroyed.

When the dominate person effect ends (either through the

duration elapsing, a dispel magic effect freeing the victim, or

the destruction of the ower), Shars vengeance manifests nally

as a poison spell, dealing 1d10 points of Constitution damage

immediately and another 1d10 points of Constitution damage 1

minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated with a DC

19 Fortitude save (DC 21 if Selne is the victims patron deity).

A camellia can be used only once.

Aura/Caster Level: Strong enchantment and necromancy;

CL 13th.

Construction: Requires Craft Wondrous Item, dominate person,

poison, remorseless charm*, 3,500 gp, 280 XP, 7 days.

Variants: A used camellia of the Black Lady still retains its

freshness, fragrance, and interesting appearance; it has a price

of 200 gp.

Weight: .

Price: 7,000 gp.

New spell described on page 34.

Sanguine Nostrum

A powder sprinkled on the heart and mixed with the blood of

an enemy.

Description: Sanguine nostrum appears as a simple magical

powder.

Activation: The powder must be mixed with a recently killed

enemys blood and sprinkled on its heart. Preparing and consuming

the heart in this way takes 3 rounds.

Effect: The powder is used to season the fresh heart of an

enemy that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. If treated

with sanguine nostrum and eaten immediately, the enemys heart

grants you great insight, as through the effect of a moment of

prescience spell. The more powerful the enemy, the greater the

benets; the caster level of the spell is equal to the Hit Dice of

the creature whose heart you consumed with the powder.

One vial of sanguine nostrum has one use.

Aura/Caster Level: Strong divination and necromancy;

CL 15th.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, moment of prescience,

2,500 gp, 20 XP, 5 days.

Weight: .

Price: 5,000 gp.

Major Artifact

An artifact is an extremely powerful magic item, beyond the

ability of present-day spellcasters to create.

Gray Portrait

This artifact prevents its owner from suffering negative levels,

ability drain, and from aging.

Lore: A DC 30 bardic knowledge or Knowledge (religion) check

recalls this myth about the gray portrait. Long ago, almost two

millennia in the past, a vain and selsh chaotic neutral follower

of Sune named Belarian the Beautiful sought every means avail-

able to sustain and enhance his beauty. Firehairs creed teaches

that beauty is not just skin deep, but Belarian only cared about

his appearance. His self-infatuation was so great that he turned

from his devotion to Lady Firehair and offered to sell his soul

to any god or demon able to preserve his physical perfection.

One answered, gifting Belarian with immortality and perpetual

beauty through an artifact. Who created the gray portrait, which

entity gave it to Belarian, or what eventually happened to the

vain man is a matter of speculation. Over the last two thousand

years, various personages have owned the portrait, but its current

location is unknown.

Description: Initially only a blank canvas, the gray portrait

becomes a picture of the owner after one week.

Activation: After an individual possesses the portrait for one

week, a picture of that individual owner appears on the canvas.

Effect: The owner of the gray portrait does not age or show

signs of aging. As long as he owns the portrait, he will appear

as young and as healthy as he did when he rst acquired the

artifact.

When the owner of the portrait is subject to spells or effects

that bestow negative levels or cause ability drain, such as energy

drain spell or a vampires touch, he does not suffer their effects.

Instead, the portrait absorbs these debilitating effects. His image

in the portrait transforms to look more haggard and depraved

as it suffers the horrors that leave its owner untouched.

The portrait stores and preserves all this horrible magic. If it

is ever destroyed, the owner immediately suffers all the negative

effects of age, negative levels, and ability drain that the portrait

has absorbed. If the owner has outlived his natural life span, he

instantly dies.

Aura/Caster Level: Overwhelming abjuration and necro-

mancy; CL 20th.

Weight: 10 lb.

Price: .

Evil lurks in many corners of Toril. These prestige

classes furnish a broad sampling of paragons of

viciousness and violence. Devoted worshipers of

Malar, woodland assassins, sporting gladiators, and many other

dark-hearted adventurers will nd interesting options for their

malevolence.

Black Blood Cultist

The power of the beasts is undeniable.

in other parts of Faernnotably near the High Forest, in

northern Cormanthor, and in Chult. Some barbaric nature is

necessary to the pursuit of the cults powers, and barbarian/rangers

are especially potent candidates. Druids rarely want to sacrice

their studies to become worshipers of abominations, but some

nd the savage nature of the cultist to be an irresistible draw.

Strength (for savage attacks), Wisdom (for tracking prey), and

Constitution (to survive deadly melee combat) are key abilities

for a Black Blood cultist.

Zert of the Wild Brothers

Table 31: The Black Blood Cultist

Worse things than wolves and orcs hunt the dark forests of

the North. The beastly lycanthropes known as the People of

the Black Blood venerate Malar with bloody rites that claim

hundreds of human, elf, and dwarf lives every year. Black Blood

cultists, worshipers of these lycanthropic horrors, are drawn

from the totemic barbarian tribes scattered across the northern

lands. They exhibit fearsome powers drawn from the veneration

of the tainted animal spirits of their masters. That their rever-

ence for the lycanthropes goes unrewarded does not matter to

the unfettered spirits of the cultiststhey rage for their cruel

masters and bring death to those who are not touched by the

Beastlords terrible power.

Class Features

Black Blood cultists are savage ghters whose natural attacks

become more fearsome as they increase in level.

Feral Rage (Ex): Black Blood cultist class levels stack with

barbarian levels for purposes of determining your rage ability. Thus,

an 8th-level barbarian/4th-level Black Blood cultist can use greater

rage four times per day, just as a 12th-level barbarian could.

Black Blood cultists strengthen their ngers and toughen their

nails with special training. As

a result, when raging, you gain

two claw attacks at your high-

est base attack bonus. Each claw

deals 1d6 points of damage plus

your Strength modier. You can

use a one-handed weapon and a

claw, but when doing so the claw

counts as a secondary weapon

(adding only half your Strength

bonus to damage, and with a 5

modier on the attack roll).

At 3rd level, you gain a bite

attack when raging in addition

to your two claw attacks. The

claws are still your primary

weapons and the bite is your

secondary weapon. The bite

deals 1d4 points of damage

plus half your Strength modi-

er. You can use a two-handed

weapon with your bite as a sec-

ondary attack, or you can use

a one-handed weapon with your

claw and bite as secondary

attacks.

At  6th  level  and

higher, whenever you hit

with both of your claw attacks

during a rage, you rend your

opponents esh, automatically

dealing double claw damage in

addition to normal damage.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 4th level and at 9th level, you

gain damage reduction, which stacks with damage reduction from

other sources. Silvered weapons ignore the damage reduction

granted by levels in this prestige class.

Shuk-ta, a black blood cultist

Improved Grapple: At 2nd level, you gain the Improved

Grapple feat even if you do not meet the prerequisites for it.

Scent (Ex): At 4th level, you gain the scent ability.

Stranglehold: At 5th level, you learn to snap the necks of

fallen enemies, allowing you to administer a coup de grace with

your bite attack as a move action.

Improved Natural Attacks: At 7th level, your natural attacks

become even more deadly. Your claw attacks now deal 1d8 points

of damage and your bite attack deals 1d6 points.

Savage Grapple: Starting at 8th level, you deal damage as if

you had hit with all your natural weapons (including rend, if you

are raging) on a successful grapple check.

Feral Form: By 10th level, you have gained great control over

your bestial nature. You can now use your claw, bite, and rend

attacks even when you are not raging.

Playing a Black Blood Cultist

You feel most alive when you are

far away from the shackles of civ-

ilization. The beast burns inside

you, and you strive to unleash it

as often as possible. You look to

the People of the Black Blood as

paragons of your idealbeasts

in humanoid form, the best of

both worlds combined into a

savage package. Your shaman

guides your spirit through its

transformation, and he is your

connection to the animal inside.

The  most  important  things

in your life are your territory

and your tribe, wherever and

whoever that might be.

You are quick to react to

danger, instantly attacking with a

fury unmatched by any civilized

being. Threats are best dealt with

swiftlykill or be killed. The

righteous transformations you

subject your body to are scars of

honor, seen and respected by

the animals of the forest

and the beasts that rule

over them. Civilization

holds nothing for you, and

you do not share the fears

of civilized creatures. Death,

loss are all a part of the natural

order, one which you are committed to protect.

Combat: While most barbarians prefer blades

and clubs in combat, you would rather rend the esh

of your enemies with your own natural weapons. Your teeth

can tear as big a hole in your prey as an axe or sword. You

are quick to react, closing immediately with the rst enemy

to dare draw steel against you. Isolate that enemy, put him on

the ground, and rip out his throat before moving on to the

next. Melee combat is where you are most comfortable. An

enemy that has ranged weapons is best avoided and ambushed,

although a frontal assault, if quick enough, can take such an

opponent by surprise. Youve learned that it is difcult for

such a foe to aim an arrow while your claws threaten to rip

it limb from limb.

hunger, and

45

Prestige Classes

By 3rd level, your melee combat skills have begun to reach

their peak. You can make three attacks per round without even

wielding a weapon, and you are a dangerous grappler while

raging. Your damage reduction allows you to absorb blows from

a grappled foes allies as your claws and bite deal their damage.

If you are working with a pack or other allies, your stealth can

help you ank your enemies while they engage in combat with

the rest of the characters. A feral Black Blood cultist charging

out of nowhere is often enough to force even the most stalwart

foes into all-out ight.

As you advance in level, your ability to both absorb and dish

out damage in melee combat increases. Your rend ability makes

it very difcult for any foe to grapple with you for more than a

couple of rounds, while your increased control over your abilities

make you a dangerous foe whether or not you have own into

a rage. You have the skills to track most foes, and to hide from

those who are tracking you.

Advancement: Black Blood cultists can be found all over

Faern; wherever the Malar-worshiping lycanthropes hold sway,

humans, elves, and others look to them as the avengers of the

natural world. It is most common for Black Blood cultists to be

reared in the tribe or cult, thereby continuing the tradition of

their forebears. A tribe always takes care of its young, even after

the parents have been killed or otherwise lost. These young grow

up alongside the other tribe members with no stigma attached,

and often grow stronger because of their independence. Tribal

Black Blood cultists are often the most savage, since they have

trained from a young age in nothing but the ways of the beast.

Those not born to such barbaric ways might come to a tribal

shaman in search of spiritual and physical fulllment. These sup-

plicants sometimes succumb to the harsh, bloody rituals inicted

upon them by the tribe to test their mettle, but others survive

the tests and emerge harder and more savage than before. Almost

universally, such trials include an individual hunt during which the

seeker must track and slay a great beast to show that he has the

favor of the Beastlord. The most severe of these trials unleash the

hunter in Black Blood lands, meaning he must not only slay his

quarry but avoid the retribution of the native lycanthropes as well.

Those who survive are inducted into the tribe in a blood rite.

Training in the arts of the Black Blood cultist can be the most

dangerous undertaking in a characters life. He toughens his body

against blows by crawling through thorny brambles, clawing and

biting on trees, and jumping from great heights until his bones

break and heal time and time again. Using specially prepared

ointments, he toughens and thickens his nails until his ngers

are like claws. Many cultists le their teeth to sharp points.

Resources: Black Blood cultists can often count on plenty

of aid from other tribe members when they nd themselves in

trouble. Of course, weak members who ask for aid too often run

the risk of being abandoned or shunned by the tribe, left to fend

for themselves in the most dangerous of territories. Black Blood

cultists often eschew material goods, gold, and the neries of

civilized life; most of what they need they either make or take.

A tribes leader recognizes that valuable magic items can be of

help to the tribe, but using too many such items can weigh heavily

on a tribe members reputation as a beast of nature.

When you do seek out magic items, you should look for magi-

cal protections that reduce the number of wounds you take in

combat. Enhanced armor is helpful, but items such as cloaks of

displacement are even better, since they can negate hits from more

powerful creatures more easily. Items that boost the effectiveness

of your natural attacks are good choices as well; several members

of the elf tribe in Cormanthor have silver and adamantine claws

with magic fang spells woven into them.

Black Blood Cultists

in the World

Black Blood cultists tend to be territorial predatorsthey are

not going to run rampant over a region or the campaign world.

They have been known to attack towns or groups in retribution

for some crime committed against them or their home, but for

the most part they are localized. Tribes are led by shamansusu-

ally druids or sorcerersand almost all follow a sort of totemic

religion, while still venerating gods such as Malar and Talona.

Characters who make enemies of a tribe of Black Blood cultists

can expect to be hunted until the day they die, while those who

befriend a tribe and travel with them are likely to witness brutality

on levels they could never have imagined.

Organization: The Black Blood cultists found across Faern

are some of Malars most fanatic followers. Much like the lycan-

thropes they worship, the different cultist tribes are independent

entities with little or no contact with others like them. Each tribe

has a relationship with the People of the Black Blood in its area,

although lycanthropes usually pay the cultists little attention.

They do recognize the cultists devotion to Malar and to nature,

however, and so they let them roam their tribal lands where no

others are allowed.

A tribes relationship with those around it differs by region.

The Chultans have very little civilization around them, and so

they focus more on their worship of the regions werebats and

of Malar than on bringing down delers. The barbarians of the

North are nomadic, wandering the region around the Night

Trees in search of enemy tribes and caravans, which represent

the civilized peoples they revile. The elf cultists of Cormanthor

concern themselves with stopping the spread of the drow, who

tend to rape the lands they inhabit in order to feed their ever-

growing numbers.

As mentioned, tribes of Black Blood cultists are often ruled by

a sorcerer or druid who claims to be an intermediary between the

tribe, the lycanthropes, and the animal spirits they worship. Clerics

of Malar rarely spend much time with these groups, who often

prefer to train their bodies rather than engage in sacred hunts.

Thus, it falls to other holy men to guide the barbarians in the

ways of the beast. It is not for power alone that a shaman guides

a tribe of Black Blood cultists. Often these individuals have had

personal interactions with the Malarite lycanthropes that inspire

their devotion. Sometimes they have barely survived such an

encounter, and other times they have witnessed the lycanthropes

meting out natures justice to trespassers and delers. Malarite

clerics sometimes encourage the formation of a tribe as a way

to gain a weapon against those who would oppose the Beastlords

46

Prestige Classes

hunts. Whatever the reason for a tribes formation, the lands in

which the barbarians roam becomes deadly to those who live in

opposition to the natural world.

Cultists spend most of their time training their bodies to be

killing machines, and the rest of the time worshiping Malar,

Talona, or local animal gods to whom they build totems and

shrines. While they do not ritually hunt as often as a Malarite,

the tradition of the individual hunt goes far beyond initiation

into the tribe. Technically only tribal hunts are required, includ-

ing those targeted against the instruments of civilization, but

individual hunting is a major determinant of prestige within

the tribe. Large game such as dire animals and dinosaurs is the

most prestigious of all targets, and even the children of a tribe

can take down a wild boar.

It is not unknown for an entire tribe to be destroyed, either by

lycanthropes fed up with the tribes intrusion upon their hunting

grounds, or by heroes from a nearby city who are determined to

put an end to the hunting and bloodshed. Sometimes a cultist will

nd cause to leave his tribe; a tribesman might also be shunned

for some act that sets him apart, or for reasons of tribal politics,

power, and control. At other times, a renegade cultist might seek

a new pack, or might fall in with adventurers who can handleor

exploithis animalistic temperament and bloodthirsty rages.

NPC Reactions

Very few people ever live to tell of an encounter with a tribe

of Black Blood cultists, much less an individual member. Those

that do speak only of an inhuman lust for blood and a hatred

for all life.

The cultists are the enemies of all civilized creatures, whether

they are found in towns, forts, or even below the earth. They have

as little love for the civilizations of the Underdark as they do for

those above ground. One known Black Blood cult has formed in

the Underdark, where a tribe of grimlocks worships a pack of

werebats and hunt drow and duergar in the dark tunnels.

Black Blood Cultist Lore

Characters with Knowledge (local Chult, the Dalelands, or the

Silver Marches) can research the People of the Black Blood or

the Black Blood cultists. The most relevant information will

come from victims, who are often aficted with terrible wounds

as a result of their meeting with or investigation of a tribe.

Lycanthropes in disguise might intentionally mislead a character

in order to draw them into a deadly ambush in tribal territory.

When a character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the

following, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: They look like animals, they worship animals, they

are animals.

DC 15: A pack of shapechangers lives in this area; how the

barbarians have survived so long among them is anybodys guess.

DC 20: The character picks up information about a hidden

route through the cultists lands, or a secret hideaway from which

the characters could safely gather information about or strike

out at the tribe.

DC 30: A character who tracks down this much information

about a local tribe can get lore about a lycanthrope that might

be sympathetic to the characters, some background information

on the shaman of the tribe, or similar information that can help

the characters defeat the barbarians more easily.

Most locals know of at least the existence of a local tribe of

animal worshipers who rampage from time to time. The DM

should assign a DC between 15 and 25, depending on the nature

and recent activities of the tribe in question. Gaining an audience

with a tribal chieftain is difcult, if not impossible, for anyone

that is not close to nature (rangers, druids, barbarians, etc.). Even

if an audience is granted, the chieftain might arrange a hunt or a

run-in with some of the local lycanthropes to test the characters

and determine Malars will in the matter.

Black Blood Cultists

in the Game

Characters who wander into tribal lands unaware of the danger

that lies therein are in for a big surprise. Even if the characters

defeat an initial hunting party, or slay a lycanthrope who has

been stalking them, they will then be hunted to the edges of the

tribes territory, or perhaps farther. If the characters can evade

the hunt for an extended period of time, the chieftain is likely to

call off the hunt and go back to his normal activities.

A player who loves the barbaric aspect of combat and doesnt

mind putting his character in harms way in order to cause griev-

ous, personal wounds to his opponents will love this prestige class.

The natural attacks of a Black Blood cultist make the character

much more than just a ghter with a boost to Strength and

Constitution.

Adaptation: Black Blood cultists could be adapted to any pack

of lycanthropes or beast god in your campaign. Alternatively,

they could worship a similar group of animallike monsters, such

as the desmodu (see Savage Species page 218).

Encounters: Any encounter with a Black Blood cultist is likely

to be deadly for one side or the other. The savage barbarians will

not ee combat, and will continue to tear into their opponents

until one or the other is dead. There is little chance of negotiation

with the leader of such a tribe, whose loyalties are to his tribe,

his territory, and his bestial lords and god.

Justice of

Weald and Woe

Make no mistake. If you harm my people or my land, I will

hunt you down like a dog and make you curse the hour of your

birth.

Talianas Sentherune,

Justice of the Suldusk cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra

The justice of weald and woe is the go-to person when something

unsavoryusually involving the removal of humansneeds

doing. When the foes of the elves are well protected physically,

magically, and politicallyand the grand lords and ladies dare

not sully their hands with the dirty necessities of preserving the

heart of elvendom from human encroachmentit is to you, the

justice of weald and woe, that they turn. With your bow in hand

and the power of nature at your command, you strike, a silent,

unseen sniper, solving problems a score of diplomats couldnt solve

in a hundred yearsthen melt back into the forest before what

is left of the enemys forces even knows you were there.

Becoming a Justice of Weald and Woe

As hunters of men, individuals already skilled in the hunt nd

themselves drawn to this class. Stealth, skill in making bows and

arrows, and knowledge of the forest are the foundation upon which

the class is built. Rangers are particularly well suited to become

justices, as are rogues, whose sneak attack damage stacks with the

sneak attack damage gained from this class. Although spellcasting

ability is not a prerequisite, you will begin to learn to cast spells that

48

Prestige Classes

draw upon the divine power of nature itself. Druids can become

justices, but one will always be less skilled in archery than his ranger

and rogue colleagues, and his druid skills will never be as powerful

as they would have had he remained a druid.

Entry Requirements

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 8 ranks, Hide 8 ranks, Knowledge

(nature) 4 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks, Survival 8 ranks.

Feats: Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow).

Class Features

As they gain in level, justices learn the skills they will need

to become the silent snipers of the forest, able to inltrate an

enemy camp in the guise of an animal or re unseen from a

concealed position.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: You gain no prociency with

any weapon, armor, or shield.

Spellcasting: You gain spells according to the tables above.

You do not gain new spells in any other spellcasting classes that

you might have had before you took this prestige class, but you

can still cast spells from your previous class. You can only choose

spells from the justice spell list; justices use their Wisdom modier

for calculating bonus spells and spell DCs.

Bonus Feats: At 2nd and 8th levels, you gain a bonus archery

feat. When you gain a new bonus feat, you must choose from

the following list: Deect Arrows, Far Shot, Improved Critical

(longbow), Improved Precise Shot, Manyshot, Mounted Archery,

Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Shot on the Run, Snatch Arrows, Weapon

Specialization (longbow only), Greater Weapon Focus (longbow

only), Greater Weapon Specialization (longbow only). You must

meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat. Use your justice level when

determining whether you meet a prerequisite of a minimum

ghter level. For example, a ranger 8/justice 8 would meet the

requirement for Greater Weapon Focus (ghter level 8th), but

not Greater Weapon Specialization (ghter level 12th).

Woodland Stride (Ex): At 2nd level, you can move through

any sort of undergrowth, as the druid ability described on page

36 of the Players Handbook.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd and 7th level, you deal

an extra 1d6 points of damage when striking an opponent when

the opponent is denied a Dexterity bonus to armor class, such

as when it is surprised and at-footed, or when you attack from

a anking position, as the sneak attack ability of rogues. Your

damage dice stack with any sneak attack damage dice you might

have gained from a previous class.

Lucky Shot (Su): Once per day as a free action, you can gain

a +10 insight bonus to one attack roll with your longbow. You

must declare the use of this ability before rolling the die.

Trackless Step (Ex): At 4th level and higher, you leave no

trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You can

leave a trail on purpose if you so desire.

Poison Use (Ex): At 5th level, you learn to create and/or

extract natural poisons and apply them to your weapons without

any danger of harming yourself.

Prestige Classes

Steady Hand (Ex): At 6th level, you become able to re your

personal longbow in melee combat without provoking attacks of

opportunity. You only gain the benet of this special ability when

wearing light or no armor.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At 9th level, you gain the ability

to hide in plain sight, as the ranger ability described on page 48

of the Players Handbook.

Death Attack (Ex): At 10th level, you gain the ability to study

your victim for 3 rounds and then make a sneak attack with a

longbow that, if it successfully deals damage, has the additional

effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (your

choice). While studying the victim, you can undertake other

actions so long as your attention stays focused on the target and

the target does not detect you or recognize you as an enemy. If

the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your

Int modier) against the kill effect, it dies. If the saving throw

fails against the paralysis effect, the target is rendered helpless

and unable to act for 1d6+10 rounds. If the targets saving throw

succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once you have

completed the 3 rounds of study, you must make the death attack

within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails

(the victim makes her save) or if you do not launch the attack

within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study

are required before you can attempt another death attack.

Poison Immunity (Ex): At 10th level, you gain immunity

to all natural poisons and animal venoms. This ability differs

from the druid ability of the same name, in that it only applies

to poisons derived from natural plants or fungi, or from animal

or vermin venoms, not to all poisons, such as venoms from

celestial animals or outsiders, or poisons derived from minerals

or magic.

Playing a

Justice of Weald and Woe

You serve two critical roles in elf culture. You are the sniper sent

to harass the enemys forces within their own encampment or

stronghold, and you are the punisher sent to the furthest ends

of Toril to execute judgment against those who harm the elves

or their interests. You are a skilled hunter and a master of using

your surroundings to disguise your movement. Your skill with the

longbow is unparalleled, and you mix martial skill with magical

ability to both mask your passage and make your arrows more

damaging, frightening, and deadly. You are patient and cautious,

yet relentless in pursuit of your goals.

The class originated within the Eldreth Veluuthra, an

elven nationalist organization dedicated to the destruction of

humankind, to deal with adventurers seeking to exploit the

ruins of Myth Rhynn. Since that time, the groups training

has spread throughout the organization as a whole. Within the

organization, you often work alone or in concert with several

other specialists whose skills compliment one another. Your

missions frequently take you outside the boundaries of acceptable

warfare as you are called upon to spread terror among humans

or eliminate political leaders whose policies lead to human

encroachment into elven forests.

Combat: Your longbow is your best friend; like a part of your

arm, it never leaves your hand. Your arrows are like thoughts

given form, speeding to do your will. Nature is your ally, hiding

your passage, covering your steps, guarding your back, and creat-

ing arrows that terrify and slay. Your best technique is to re

from a position of concealment, surprising your opponents.

When working within a party, you operate best from the

shadows. Do not be afraid to re into melee; surprise and ank

attacks are your best tactics. Although at 6th level you gain the

ability to use your longbow in melee combat, you prefer to let the

brawny ones do the sluggingyou are a bringer of swift, silent

death from afar.

Your enemies grow frustrated and begin to believe it is the

forest itself that opposes them, or that a battalion of elves lies

hidden in the wood, when it is only you, itting from tree to tree,

crawling through the tall grass like a snake, always striking from

the ank, catching your opponents at-footed. Mix your spells and

extraordinary abilities with your uncanny longbow skill to drive

fear into their hearts. Your lucky shot, death attack, and poison use

abilities allow you to assassinate difcult, even heavily armored foes

and leave little evidence of the manner of their death. As you are

taught from the rst day of your training, a single arrow, properly

placed, is often more effective than a storm of bolts.

Advancement: The Eldreth Veluuthra carefully recruits

prospective justices from the ranks of rangers and rogues already

serving the cause, individuals who have already proven their abil-

ity to follow orders without suffering from any moral qualms.

They seek individuals with superb longbow and survival skills who

show promise (though not necessarily current skill) as spellcasters.

These are sent to train with rangers and druids who are themselves

students of the ice lich Lossarwyn (see page 83).

Your rst missions as a justice are often as a longbow specialist

working in concert with other skilled individuals, including rogues,

rangers, sorcerers, druids and wizards. If combat begins, your job

is to harass the enemy leaders and spellcasters with your arrows.

You spend most of your time training with experienced rangers

and druids, who put you through your magical and mundane

paces, though you are also required to make extensive study of

the behavior of your enemies so that you can exploit their weak-

nesses and your strengths. You should learn to handle animals,

especially poisonous snakes, since they become useful to you at

later levels. Finally, you undergo a thorough indoctrination in

elven culture so that, when the time comes for swift deeds on

behalf of your people, your hand will not falter.

As you advance in skill, you will be called on more and more

often to use your skills as a spy and a hunter of menthus you

will need to concentrate on those abilities that will best serve

your missions. As a gatherer of information, you will need dis-

guise and conceal-

ment skills, plus

the  ability  to

escape danger-

ous situations. A

cloak of elven-

kind and boots

of elven k ind

are indispens-

able pieces of

your wardrobe.

As a hunter,

you will need

tracking abil-

ity as well as

the skills of a

spy, since your

quarry  might

take you into

the stronghold

of those you in-

tend to slay. Even

the best bow wears out over time,

so you will need to continue to

improve your Craft skill to make

better weapons. You might even want to in-

vest in the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat so

that you can craft your own magic weapons, such as arrows of

slaying. At the very highest levels, you are almost exclusively

an assassinthe number of arrows in your quiver is a mark

of your skill. By this time, you most often train alone, since

few have the skill to teach you. You also begin to teach others

your skills.

Resources: This prestige class was born from the Eldreth

Veluuthra because of its special needs, and the Eldreth Veluuthra

remains the primary source of justice training. Here, you can

always nd rangers and druids sympathetic to your cause who

are willing to teach you their secrets. The organization also

provides employment in organizational activities after you have

completed a mission, as well as quests and missions needing the

special combination of abilities that can only be found in a party

of adventurers. Finally, with its connections to the elf aristocracy,

the organization can sometimes provide cover, protection, and

an alibi after you have completed a mission that might have

agents of a slain human king hot upon your trail and screaming

for your blood (but only if you are extraordinarily careless). Just

dont abuse their hospitality.

Justices in the World

Justices provide a refreshing alternative to the high-and-mighty,

shining beacon of goodness image of most elves in the game.

A justice of weald and woe makes an excellent recurring foe for

a group of PCs that have stomped upon a few

elven toes at some point in their career. If you

have a justice in the game, provide plenty of

elf-related ties to your adventures to keep

the  character  active.

Justices live for

the one-on-one en-

counter, the chess

match of wits in

impossible ter-

rain  against  a

worthy foe, such

as an opposed

ranger or assas-

sin. The justice

is a primarily a

man-killer, not a

dragon-slayer.

Organization:

Justices are lon-

ers, as far as oth-

ers of their kind

are  concerned.

Whenever  two

justices  meet,

friction is likely

to result, since all

justices are extraordinarily jealous of their abilities

and secrets, and there is always the chance that the

justice sitting across the table from you has been sent

by your last employer to prevent you from talking.

However, like all hunters, justices sometimes come

together to tell elaborate lies about their exploits, or to show off

their trophies.

Because their missions sometimes overlap, justices and

Evereskan tomb guardians sometimes cooperatebut more often

competefor the glory of bringing tomb delers to justice. This

has, on occasion, led to open conict between individuals, and at

least one remarkable friendship.

Tylore Beneshare was a ranger who was recruited into the

Eldreth Veluuthra and eventually began her training as a Justice.

Her political and historical advisor was Ganethra Elderwand, a

tomb guardian with whom she spent many an argumentative hour

while sharing the responsibility of guarding a three-thousand-

year-old tomb north of Evereska. While Tylore was on a mission

to ambush a Zhentarim trade caravan in the Anauroch, human

adventurers from Waterdeep broke into the tomb. Their wizard,

a member of the Arcane Brotherhood, summoned a demon that

nearly killed Ganethra.

When Ganethra healed, he set out alone to restore his honor,

recover the artifacts stolen from the tomb, and punish the thieves.

Tylore arrived a month after Ganethra left but was able to track

Dannae,

a justice of weald and woe

51

Prestige Classes

him by the trail of bodies he had left behind. Finally, she caught

up with Ganethra outside the wizards tower at the edge of the

Ardeep Forest, where she convinced him to give up his insane

plan to inltrate the tower and slay the wizard in his conjuring

chamber. Instead, they lay in wait on the road leading to the

tower, and when the wizards wife rode past accompanied by her

bodyguard, Tylore dropped her from the saddle with a single

arrow, while Ganethra battled and slew the bodyguard. Tylore

then restrained one of the horses, and they slung both bodies

across the saddle and sent it on its way.

In a rage, the wizard stormed from his tower and descended

on the forest with his servants. But long had the Eldreth

Veluuthra cell of the Ardeep sought a chance to eliminate this

human wizard and regain the treasures he had stolen from the

elven ruins in their forest; coordinating with them, Tylore set

up an ambush in which all but one of the wizards servants

was slain. Sorely wounded, the wizard teleported to safety,

only to discover his tower already occupied by the Eldreth

Veluuthra. Hunted through the halls he had once considered

his stronghold, he was nally slain in his conjuring chamber

by Ganethra.

NPC Reactions

Because they strongly believe that the end justies the means and

will gladly slay innocents if doing so strikes a blow against a hated

enemy, justices are often reviled within normal elven culture. They

are a political liability of the worst kind. Nevertheless, they are an

effective weapon, and one not to be tossed aside lightly. Elaborate

measures are used to maintain plausible deniability.

The enemies of the elves are the enemies of the justices.

Therefore, they have many enemies, both good and evil. Where

one elf might see a competitor or an adversary, a justice sees an

enemy to be destroyed.

Justices in the game

Because of their inherent racist attitude, justices afliated with

the Eldreth Veluuthra might be difcult to work into a group

of PCs that includes humans. Some greater mission must be

involved. Anywhere that elven interests are at stake is a good

place to insert a justice into the campaign.

Adaptation: Justices t fairly well into other game worlds, but

you might need to design an organization that both motivates

them and gives them support. They would swiftly be hunted

down and destroyed by their fellow elves without some sort of

political protection.

Encounters: The justices of weald and woe are swift, silent

bringers of death to all who would subvert elven cultureespe-

cially humans. Justices are implacable foes driven by an almost

fanatic desire to crush those deemed to be an enemy of the people,

using whatever means are necessary to do so.

A number of new spells have come out of the justice training.

Designed by the ice lich Lossarwyn, these spells expand upon

the justices already formidable archery portfolio. These spells

are listed in the justice of weald and woe spell list (above) and

are detailed in Chapter 2.

Night Mask

Deathbringer

The winds of change have blown into Westgate, and I am like a

whisper on that wind. The city does as I bid, as my masters bid,

but all it feels is my cool kiss gently guiding its withered will.

Emuin Nightshade

The deathbringers are the phantoms of Westgate, able to walk

among mortal men during the light of day but possessed of some

of undeaths most ghastly powers. They are not truly undead

beings, but hybrids bred to go where the masters of the Night

Masks cannot tread. As a deathbringer, you stalk the shadows

of Westgate and beyond in search of ways to empower yourself

and your guild. You have tasted the kiss of death, and the fear it

brought you never quite leaves the back of your mind.

Becoming a

Night Mask Deathbringer

Night Mask deathbringers are highly trained members of the

Westgate thieves guild who have caught the favorable attention

of the vampires in charge of the organization. They undergo a

gruesome ceremony involving the drinking of their own blood

from the veins of a vampire lord, which changes them into

monsters capable of the most vile and depraved acts. Rogues have

the easiest time qualifying for this prestige class; other classes

generally must stray from their primary training to achieve the

necessary requirements. Dexterity (for stealth), Wisdom (for

perception), and Charisma (for more powerful special abilities)

are key abilities for a Night Mask deathbringer.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Knowledge (local) 3 ranks, Move

Silently 8 ranks.

Feat: Great Fortitude.

Special: Evasion and uncanny dodge class features.

Class Features

As they increase in level, Night Mask deathbringers gain more

of the powers their undead masters possess, increasing their

deadliness and skill.

Creature of Darkness (Ex): Animals can sense the death in

you, causing them to fear your presence. As a result, all animals

except for bats, rats, and wolves have their initial attitudes moved

down one category when you rst approach them. In addition, you

take a 2 penalty on all Ride checks due to the beasts inherent

nervousness at your presence.

Hesitating Stare (Su): Deathbringers can force their opponents

to confront their own mortality with but a glance. This ability

can be activated once per day at any time, even when you are

surprised. You cast a glance at any foe within 30 feet, who must

53

Prestige Classes

then make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level +

Cha modier) or be stunned for 1 round. You can use this ability

twice per day at 4th level and higher, three times per day at 7th

level and higher, and four times per day at 10th level.

Light Sensivity (Ex): In sunlight or bright magical light

(such as a daylight spell), a deathbringer is dazzled.

Spider Climb (Sp): Starting at 1st level, you can act as if you

were under the inuence of a spider climb spell (caster level equals

your deathbringer class level). You can use this ability a number of

times per day equal to your Charisma modier, minimum one.

Feral Senses: At 2nd level, you gain low-light visionthe ability

to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight,

or similar conditions of poor illumination. You retain the ability

to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

At 7th level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet.

Speak with Creatures of the Night (Ex): When you reach

3rd level, you can speak with rats, bats, and wolves as if you were

under the inuence of a speak with animals spell. This ability

does nothing to affect the attitude of such creatures.

Ghost Step (Su): Once per day starting at 3rd level, you

can make yourself invisible for 1 round. This is a swift action

(something you can do as a free action once per round) that does

not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability twice

per day at 6th level and higher, and three times per day at 9th

level and higher.

Lesser Blood Bond (Su): One of the deathbringers most

insidious powers, this ability helps you break down the will of

her enemies. To use this ability, a deathbringer of 4th level or

higher must get the target to drink three drops of her blood. She

can do this by hiding the blood in food or drink, or by pinning

the target for 1 round and bleeding directly into his mouth.

Once this condition has been fullled, the deathbringer can

cause a charm person effect to come over the target by speaking

directly to him. The words used are unimportant, only that the

deathbringer wills the target to be friendly to him. The caster

level of the effect equals the deathbringers class level, and the

DC to resist the effect equals 10 + the deathbringers class level

+ Cha modier.

You can have a number of outstanding blood bonds, active

or not, equal to your Charisma modier. Should you exceed this

limit, the oldest blood bond becomes inactive.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 4th level and higher, you deal extra

damage when you catch a foe at-footed or ank a foe, as the

rogue class feature described on page 50 of the Players Handbook.

Sneak-attack dice attained from multiple sources stack.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 5th level, your pseudo-vampiric

celerity grants you supernatural reexes. You now take no damage

on a successful Reex saving throw against area attacks and half

damage on a failed save. You do not gain the benet of this ability

if you are helpless.

Slippery Mind (Su): When you attain 6th level, your mind is

only partly mortal, allowing you to shrug off mental attacks and

compulsions more easily than others. Any time you are affected

by an enchantment spell or effect and you fail your saving throw,

you can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same DC.

You only get one extra chance to succeed per effect.

Greater Blood Bond (Su): This ability, acquired at 10th level,

works just like lesser blood bond, except the target comes under the

inuence of a dominate person spell rather than charm person.

A deathbringer can have a number of outstanding blood bonds,

active or not, equal to her Charisma modier. Should she exceed

this limit, the oldest blood bond becomes inactive.

Playing a

Night Mask Deathbringer

You are a master of nights dark shadows, a deadly whisper whose

passing leaves blood and destruction. Killing and robbing were

not enough for you, however; you craved power, and the lords

of the Night Masks were willing to share it with youfor a

price. You must serve their wicked ends, and sacrice a little of

your humanity in the process. You can now come and go as you

please, and the secrets of the night are yours to use for whatever

purpose stokes the res of your corrupted mind.

The night is your time; it is when you are at your most con-

dent and most deadly. Still, your masters expect you to carry

out missions in daylight as well, something they themselves are

incapable of doing without great risk. While the sun is deadly

to them, to you it is merely an inconvenience. Still, this minor

hindrance is the price of a power that you never could have

achieved on your own.

Combat: You prefer to strike from the shadows, where your

powers are at their greatest. Setting ambushes is your

tactic of choice, using your ability to speak

with inconspicuous creatures and climbing

where  others  might  fall.  Open  combat

does not serve you well, especially under

the brightness of the sun. Your skills are

best utilized in quick combat, with your

enemy on the ground before he ever knew

what hit him. When combat drags out

and surprise tactics are no longer on

your side, use skills such as Hide and

Tumble as well as your ghost step

ability to leave combat and prepare

another ambush. Leaving your foes

bleeding and confused is sometimes

better than leaving them dead.

By 4th level you are able to

better spring surprise attacks on

your foes, using your abilities to

become invisible and to see better

in conditions of low light. Since

your sneak attack damage does

not increase at the same rate

as a rogues, you must rely

even more on ambush tactics

as your level increases. For this

purpose, you must improve your

Bluff and Hide skills, allowing you to

attack from the darkness and then retreat there again, even after

you have exhausted your uses of ghost step for the day.

At higher levels you can use your hesitating stare to stun op-

ponents, making them vulnerable to your deadly sneak attacks.

Your slippery mind and improved evasion abilities allow you to

remain in close combat for longer than you could previously,

and your ability to quietly slip out of combat when things turn

against you has peaked. You are still not a combat master, but

you can hold your own against almost any single opponent, and

you have the tools to leave multiple foes scratching their heads

or grasping their bloodied throats.

Advancement: Deathbringers are recruited from among the

Night Masks most shadowy and ambitious operatives. Taking

such rogues into their inner circle accomplishes two goals for the

vampires: It keeps the ambitious close to them where they can

monitor any treacherous plans, and it gives them loyal opera-

tives who can operate above ground during the daylight hours.

Occasionally a prospect from outside the guild is turned into a

deathbringer. On at least one occasion a rogue who managed to

pierce the vampires inner sanctum was captured and, rather than

facing a long, torturous death, agreed to become an agent of the

Night Masks.

To become inducted into the deathbringer clan is to know

fear and pain as you have never experienced it. The vampires

have a ritual that involves bloodletting,

mental domination, and phan-

tasms from the deepest part of

the subconscious. Once this ritual

has been completed, a piece of the

deathbringers mortality has been

replaced with the horror of living

death.  While  this  experience

does not make her an undead

creature, she has to live with a

measure of the suffering such

creatures face.

Once the ritual is complete, the

deathbringer is now ofcially a

part of the guilds highest order.

While no special privileges are

granted because of this, death-

bringers do hold greater weight

in the eyes of the guilds leaders.

Most Night Mask operatives will

defer to a deathbringer in matters of

guild business, and they are often

trusted with the most delicate

and lucrative jobs. Unless they

are on a mission for one of their

vampire lords, deathbringers are

granted no rights to petition them

for aid or advice. Sometimes the

vampires instruct more experi-

enced deathbringers on how to use

their newfound abilities, but most of

the time they assume their creations

are smart enough to gure things out on their own.

Resources: Night Mask deathbringers work in service to the

guild, and they will ask for help whenever necessary. A particularly

powerful enemy or dangerous situation might bring a swarm of

deathbringers down upon it, usually spelling doom for whoever

has warranted such attention. Information ows freely between

the deathbringers, and there is no inherent competition for the

attention of their masters. Of course, some deathbringers are more

ambitious than others, but personal rivalries are more often the

cause of such conicts than ambition.

You should seek magic items that increase both your stealth

and speed. A ring of jumping allows you to prowl the rooftops,

and shadow armor makes you effectively invisible against the

darkness of night. Charisma-enhancing items make some of your

special abilities even more effective, as well as facilitating access

to those you wish to see drink your blood.

Night Mask Deathbringers

in the World

Night Mask deathbringers make terrible foes for any group of

PCs, because deathbringers can sow seeds of distrust between even

the most stalwart companions. Any characters who are active

and successful in or near the city of Westgate will eventually run

across a deathbringer, whether they know it or not. Westgate is

the deathbringers city, and they want to know about any potential

threats or allies that come inside its walls. A deathbringer can even

act as a characters rst introduction to the Night Masks guild, and

potentially bring him inside to work for the guild. If the PCs are

looking for a contact in Westgates underworld, they could not do

much better than one of Orbakhs pseudo-vampiric minions (for

more information on Orbakh, see page 41 of Lords of Darkness).

Organization: The deathbringers are a special arm of the Night

Masks thieves guild. Most of the time they are left to their own

devices, using their extraordinary powers to further the assets and

position of the guild. Occasionally, the vampires at the center of

the guilds power structure command one or more deathbringers

to see to an important bit of guild business. Daytime meetings and

ambushes are typical of the missions to be assigned, as are those

with more far-reaching goals such as the exploration of a ruin, or

contact with an ally outside Westgate or along the Dragon Coast.

The deathbringers are like a plague across Westgate, one that

often extends across the Dragonmere into Sembia, and south into

Turmish and Amn. Its individual agents have spread out across

the lands that interest the Night Masks and their masters. One

deathbringer, a sorcerer/rogue named Ciodaru Arexis, has risen to

such power that he now commands the respect of all the others.

Little do they know that Ciodaru is actually a disguised illithid,

working under a special arrangement with Orbakh. Although he

is bestowed with no more power than any other deathbringer, his

knowledge of the citys power structures and the intrigues he has

woven throughout them means that nothing goes on in the city

without his knowledge.

Ciodaru has control of the Purple Lady Festhall, the closest

thing to a central meeting hall the guild maintains. A complex

underneath the inn leads to a temple of Talona, where victims, kid-

napped from parties at the festhall, are taken for experimentation

with new diseases and poisons. The priests of the temple provide

Ciodaru with an elixir that dulls the horror permeating the minds

of all those who have undergone the deathbringer transformation;

his success is partly attributable to the mental clarity he gets from

the elixir, so no one outside of himself, the inns owner, and the

temple priests knows of this secret arrangement.

Westgate has a reputation as a city where anything can be

bought for a price. This atmosphere lends itself extremely well

to the Night Masks business concerns, and even more so for

its most shadowy operativesthe deathbringers. Deathbringers

are active day and night, looking for new opportunities to bring

wealth and power to the guild. During the day, most of their

activities include scouting locations and talking to their contacts

in order to stay current with the new faces in town.

Everything changes in Westgate at night. The smartest law-

abiding citizens stay off the streets, where robbers and worse lurk

in every shadow. Deathbringers swarm from their hidden holes

and hideaways as soon as the sun falls, ready to implement their

plans and attack their enemies from the shadows. The phantoms

of Westgate are rarely out to simply rob someone of their

pursethey stalk likely targets for a blood bond and investigate

their background; they track powerful adventurers who have

come into town without registering with the guild; and they

assassinate merchants and nobles who have proven troublesome

to their undead masters

Of course, the deathbringers are not without their enemies in

Westgate and beyond. Chief among them are the Five Souls of

the Dead, a group of Kelemvorites who are committed to rooting

out the vampiric lords of the Night Masks. Since Orbakh and the

Court of Night Masters rarely venture out into the city, the Five

Souls have focused their efforts on the bastard creations known

as the deathbringers. The Kelemvorites have already destroyed

three deathbringers since coming to Westgate, and they are on

the trail of at least two more. Ciodaru has managed to maneuver

them into his sphere so that he can keep tabs on them, but until

he is ready to confront them outright, he is forced to impede

their information gathering as best he can from the shadows.

NPC Reactions

The Night Masks are an accepted, if not welcome, part of the

Westgate culture and landscape. In some parts of town, guild

members can talk freely about their association without care,

while in others such aunting is looked down upon. One thing

is for certain, thoughthe authorities have long since given up

trying to control the guild and its activities. Those who nd

themselves on the guilds good side welcome its members into

their establishments, might give them preferential treatment or

minor discounts on goods, and wont betray their condence for

too little coin.

Those who nd themselves at odds with the guild quickly

nd that they must hire mercenaries to guard them and their

businesses against guild activities. One might even attract the

attention of a deathbringer, at which point all the mercenaries

in the world might not be enough protection. Although they do

not identify themselves as anything but ordinary guild thieves,

deathbringers have an aura about them that clearly differentiates

them from other individuals. This leads to stronger reactions in

both cases, with guild-friendly NPCs being even friendlier toward

deathbringers, and those with reason to fear or loathe the guild

reacting strongly in the opposite direction.

Nightmask Deathbringer Lore

Characters with Knowledge (local Westgate) can research the

deathbringers or the Night Masks. Investigating a deathbringer by

name is certain to pique the guilds curiosity, while trying to nd

information on the guild itself is certain to warrant a personal

visit, possibly from a deathbringer if the inquiring character is

powerful or inuential. When a character makes a skill check,

read or paraphrase the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

Nightmask Deathbringers

in The game

The deathbringers could be a thorn in your characters sides for

quite some time before being discovered. If the characters go to

Westgate and seek a high-level audience with the Night Masks,

a deathbringer would likely be their rst contact.

Players who love stealth, assassination, and unusual abilitiess will

be attracted to the deathbringer class for its combination of these

elements. The discovery of new abilities at each level should be enough

motivation to keep a character loyal to his vampiric masters, even

if he must occasionally make personal sacrices to them.

Adaptation: The deathbringers t perfectly into their role as

elite agents of Westgates vampire lords. They could be former

captured adversaries or specially selected lieutenants.

Encounters: Unless the characters have boldly demanded an

audience with the lords of the Night Masks (or otherwise caught

their attention), their rst encounter with a deathbringer is likely

to be short and bloody. If they manage to kill the deathbringer,

this act would probably bring the full wrath of the Night Masks

upon them very quickly.

Shade Hunter

The return of Netheril can only mean great danger for Faern.

I must nd that which they have come seeking, so that I can use

it rst.

Daggerdale Thren, shade hunter

The shade hunter is a breed of adventurer who lives for the thrill

of nding lost treasure, defeating ancient traps, and surviving

deadly curses laid by the priests of dead gods. Part historian, part

loremaster, and part graverobber, these artifact hunters will go

anywhere and risk anything to acquire the next big score to add

to their hoards. Netherese artifacts have always held a particular

fascination for anyone interested in history and ancient arcana,

and the return of the Shadovar and the oating City of Shade

above Anauroch has created a frenzy of related activity all across

Faern. The recent damage dealt to Shades mythal by ve of

Faerns most powerful mages has caused the citys leaders to seek

out ancient stores of Netherese magic in hopes that something

will be able to repair itand opportunistic treasure hunters have

not been far behind them.

Becoming a Shade Hunter

Shade hunters come from all backgrounds, but a love of adven-

ture and history as well as a total disregard for personal safety

are traits common to them all. Most hail from the northern

regionsthe Dalelands, the Western Heartlands, the North, and

the Moonsea being most commonaround which the ancient

empire of Netheril had the most contact and inuence. The

freewheeling style of the class, as well as the need for stealth and

technical expertise, best suits rogues and rangers, but occasion-

ally a curious bard will nd the lure of undiscovered caches of

magic and lore irresistible; other classes nd the wide range of

skills and knowledge a shade hunter needs to be too demanding.

Intelligence (for skill acquisition and spells), Dexterity (for evad-

ing traps), and Wisdom (for following tracks) are key abilities

for a shade hunter.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Climb 4 ranks, Decipher Script 4 ranks, Disable Device

5 ranks, Jump 4 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 6 ranks,

Knowledge (history) 2 ranks, Search 8 ranks, Speak Language

(Netherese), Survival 6 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks.

Feat: Track.

Special: Shades as a favored enemy, trapnding class feature.

Class Features

Shade hunters have become amazingly adept at navigating the

dungeons in which the ancient magic of Netheril is often found.

They also develop special techniques for ghting the rightful

heirs to this long lost treasure.

Spellcasting: When you take up this class, you gain the ability

to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, you must have

an Intelligence score of 10 + the spells level. Your bonus spells

are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells

have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Intelligence bonus. When

you get 0 spells per day, you gain only the bonus spells you would

be entitled to based on your intelligence score for that spell level.

You cast spells just as a sorcerer does.

Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level

after that, you can choose to learn a new spell in place of one

you already know. The new spells level must be the same as that

of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels

lower than the highest-level shade hunter spell you can cast.

Trap Sense (Ex): Your expertise with dungeons gives you an

intuitive sense that alerts you to danger from traps, providing

you with a +1 bonus on Reex saves made to avoid traps and a +1

dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses

increase by 1 every other level, up to +5 at 9th level. Trap sense

bonuses gained from multiple sources stack.

Tricks of the Trade (Ex): The experiences and dangers that you

have encountered in your travels begin to coalesce into a practical

body of knowledge when you enter the shade hunter class. This

knowledge grants you a bonus equal to your class level that can

be used each day to augment ability checks, skill checks, or attack

rolls. The points of bonus do not need to be applied to the same

roll, and you can divide them up however you like throughout

the day. You must decide whether or not to use a bonus, and if

so how large the bonus will be, before you roll the die.

For example, a 3rd-level shade hunter has a total bonus of +3

to distribute throughout the day. If he nds himself in mortal

combat, he could apply the entire bonus to a single attack roll,

hoping to fell his enemy. Alternatively, he could apply a +1 bonus

to an Open Lock check, then another +1 to a Spot check later

that day, and his nal +1 bonus to a Strength check to dislodge

a coffer from its resting place.

Low-Light Vision (Ex): At 2nd level, you gain low-light

vision. If you already have low-light vision, its effective distance

is doubled, so you can now see four times as far as a human in

conditions of low light.

Sense Ancient Magic (Su): Starting at 2nd level, you can

detect the magical aura radiated by items of Netherese creation.

58

Prestige Classes

This ability functions like detect magic, except that it is always

active unless you consciously suppress it, and it can only detect

the auras of magic items that have been in the same location for

at least one hundred years.

Expert Packer: Starting at 3rd level, you have learned how

to get every last bit of utility out of your backpack, belt, and

bandoleer. Reduce the weight of your gear by 10% for purposes

of guring your load.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 4th level and higher, you deal extra

damage when you catch a foe at-footed or ank a foe, as the

rogue class feature described on page 50 of the Players Handbook.

Sneak-attack dice attained from multiple sources stack.

Tools of the Trade: By 4th level, you have picked up so many

knickknacks and strange tools on your travels that youve lost

track of everything you own. Once per day, you can nd any

mundane piece of equipment (other than weapons or armor)

worth up to 10 gp per class level somewhere on your person,

having forgotten completely about it. When you do so, you must

subtract an equivalent amount of gold (or other treasuregems,

jewelry, art, etc.) from your savings. If you do not have enough

gold to cover the cost of the item you want, you might not nd

the item with this ability.

Darkvision (Ex): At 5th level, you gain darkvision out to 60

feet. If you already have darkvision, its effective distance extends

by an additional 60 feet instead.

Special Ability (Ex): At 6th level, you can choose one of the

following rogue special abilities: defensive roll, improved evasion,

or skill mastery (see Players Handbook page 51).

Locate Ancient Magic (Su): When you reach 7th level, your

ability to sense the lost magic of Netheril has grown stronger.

You can now locate any magic items that have been in the same

location for at least one hundred years as if you had cast a locate

object spell and were familiar with the items in question. Activat-

ing this ability is a standard action, and you can locate multiple

auras by concentrating for continuous rounds.

Improved Favored Enemy (Ex): Starting at 8th level, your

favored enemy bonuses against shades increase by 2. No other

favored enemy bonuses can be increased with this ability.

Blindsight (Ex): At 10th level your ability to function in

the deepest, darkest dungeons grants you the ability to sense

your surroundings using every available sensory input. You gain

blindsight out to 30 feet.

Playing a Shade Hunter

You cant wait for the next big score! The joy that some people

feel at the birth of a rst child or the kiss of a new bride is yours

only when you uncover a stash of Netherese gold or ancient magic.

Even research can be exciting when its leading you to the X on

the treasure map, and youll gladly travel across the continent to

hunt down a parchment or tome that has information you need.

The only thing you like better than learning about the things you

are passionate about is actually utilizing what you know in the

eld. You love the smell of oiled locks and old poison on rusty

spikes, and you love the look on your enemies faces as you snatch

the prize right out from under them. Whatever loot you manage

to pry from the cold, dead ngers of its former Netherese owner

is added to your hoard, especially if it is an item that can help

you on your next foray.

Your adventures cause you to cross paths with shades and other

beings from the oating city as well as treasure hunters of all

stripes. You are sometimes willing to work with others as long as

you benet from the transaction, but you worry that revealing too

much information might lose you a prize you have so long sought.

Still, your constant run-ins with powerful shades have taught you

the wisdom of sharing combat techniques and lore about your

common enemy with other shade hunters. Silverymoon, Llorkh,

and Dagger Falls are popular sites to meet and trade with other

treasure hunters, the rst for its amazing historical and arcane

resources, and the latter two for their proximity to the majority

of ancient Netherese lands. The lands in between are referred

to by your colleagues as either the ancient lands or the shadow

triangle, depending on their disposition.

Combat: Exploring inevitably brings you face to face with some

of the deadliest traps and monsters on the planetbut youre a

researcher and seeker rst, and a ghter second. You are at your

best when attacking from an ambush, which means you must be

ready for your enemies when they come. Keen senses help you,

but preparation is the key to your survival. You have researched

the areas into which you travel, and you always pack a surprise

or two for the regions deadliest denizens. When sneaking and

ambush dont work, you are still fairly procient with bow and

blade, at least enough to cover your retreat or to nd the right

method of attack.

When you travel without companions, its best to hire some

outside muscle to help carry the spoils of your search as well as

help you stay alive. Your sneak attack ability makes it that much

more effective for you to ght in a group, and such tactics help

spread out the damage your foes can cause. As an inveterate

traveler and explorer, you have run across a wide variety of

weapons and tools created to help defend oneself from harm.

Quirky items such as thunderstones and tanglefoot bags can

provide not-so-obvious solutions to tough problems, including

creatures that are determined to keep a Netherese hoard intact

for another thousand years. You nd a new use for an old item

just about every time you enter a dungeon, and cataloging these

tricks has helped you survive your dangerous occupation.

Your ghting abilities suffer the most for your studies, and

the more knowledgeable you become about Netherese history

and the dungeons where it can be found, the less formidable you

are with your sword. Against incredibly powerful foes (except

for shades, which you excel at ghting) it is even more impor-

tant to strike rst from the shadows and ee before suffering

retaliation. Youve accumulated quite a bag of tricks, and you

shouldnt be afraid to use its contents to escape from a desperate

situation. Traveling with allies at this point becomes almost a

necessityunless you have enough gold to hire the most loyal

followers money can buy.

Advancement: Scholars and adventurers from all across

Faern travel to the lands surrounding Anauroch to research

and seek out the ancient mysteries of Netheril. Anyone who

grew up in those regions, however, has heard the local tales and

legends of the fallen Netherese almost from the time that they

are born. It is not hard for the ancient empire to get under

ones skin, with this fascinationor obsessionperhaps even

leading to a career devoted to unearthing its secrets. Some take

the path of scholar, attending the nest schools of Waterdeep

and Silverymoon, while others set out at the rst opportunity

to carve adventure from the remnants of a dead society. Those

who do quickly nd that they are not alone in their pursuit of

Netherils artifacts and legacy.

At some point in time, every shade hunter is drawn to leave

his books to experience rsthand the majesty of Netherilinevi-

tably leading to confrontations with shades and other explorers

who are seeking the same things. The Shadovar are particularly

possessive over what they consider their rightful legacy, and will

attempt to destroy anyone who stands in their way. This fact

leads many treasure hunters to practice techniques to help them

combat the shades and their mighty powers, the pursuit of which

is not far off from their normal studies. Most shade hunters

acquire and commission strange tools and equipment based on

their experiences in the eld, but no matter how much a shade

hunter can learn from books and teachers, Netherils trapmakers

and arcanists still have a few surprises left for those who would

seek their ancient knowledge.

It can be difcult for a shade hunter to limit his studies to the

essentials, since he nds so many skills and talents necessary for

survival. His tricks of the trade ability allows him to spread his

skill points around a little more than a dedicated rogue or ranger,

because he has a pool of available bonus points to make up for

a deciency in ranks. Since he relies on skills as an integral part

of his activities, even combat, it can be a good idea to use feats

to bolster these skills. Feats that grant bonuses to multiple skills

are best, for the reasons stated above. Feats that help him avoid

combat and damage, such as Dodge and Mobility, are almost

always preferable to those that increase his combat capabilities.

Resources: Resourcefulness is a hallmark of shade hunters,

and they seem to have contacts in every city from Waterdeep to

Hillsfar. They can sometimes get information or advice from

fellow shade hunters, or from local rangers who dont mind seeing

the Shadovar take a hit. Real information about possible hoards,

Shadovar dig sites, and other related info are guarded by shade

hunters, however, and will rarely if ever be traded or given up

without signicant persuasion. It is considered good etiquette to

share general tips about dungeoneering, however. New and useful

tools are described or displayed, and might even be loaned for

copying from time to time. Techniques for climbing, bypassing

traps, and stalking monsters are also good conversation between

shade hunters, even ones that consider themselves rivals.

With their focus on lost magic, it is no wonder that shade

hunters employ quite a bit of magic themselves. Items that aid

stealth such as cloaks of elvenkind and rings of invisibility are

popular, as are those that allow for a quick getaway in times of

trouble. Boots of striding and springing are almost an essential

tool, allowing for quick movement and providing the ability to

jump over chasms, pit traps, and other

obstacles.

Shade Hunters in

the World

Shade  hunters  travel  the  north-

ern reaches of Faern in search

of  artifacts  and  lore  from  the

ancient civilization of Netheril.

They regularly interact with

remnants of the most magical

society the world has ever seen,

and often spread this knowledge,

intentionally or not, to Faerns

living mages. They provide a

convenient foil to the shades,

who are now scouring their

ancestral lands for magic that

will help them reestablish the

Netherese empire and make

the lands inhabitable again.

Although they might be doing

the  countries  of  Faern  a

favor by denying power to

the shades, their motives fall

well short of being altruistic.

Most shade hunters believe

that  the  Shadovar  have

returned for a purpose, and they want

to nd out why so they can wield the power rst.

Organization: Shade hunters are a diverse and independent

lot. When they are doing research or training in a city, they are

likely to help one another and pass along information not directly

related to a recent nd. There is a camaraderie between them

born of their mutual fascination with history, Netherese lore, and

the thrill of the hunt. They tend to frequent the same haunts in

cities across Faern, from libraries in Silverymoon to taverns in

Waterdeep and brothels and thieves guilds in Mulmaster. They

hope to pick up some tidbit of information from fellow shade

hunterseven if they arent forthcoming about their recent

activities, a glimpse of a book paged through or map examined

might provide valuable clues. As the nights wear on, they gather

to drink and share stories and lore. Even bitter rivals engage in

these sorts of meets, although their storytelling is often competi-

tive or meant to dredge up the failures and embarrassments their

rivals have suffered in the past.

Aside from doing research and swapping stories in taverns,

shade hunters busy themselves preparing for the inevitable jour-

neys that will, they hope, lead them to the riches of Netheril. If

other shade hunters or treasure seekers know a shade hunter is

preparing to leave, that individual must often take precautions

against being followed. A favorite tactic of the half-elf Cantius

Valer is to hire a lookalike to leave town the day before he sets

out, causing would-be trackers to head in the opposite direction

while he leaves town undetected,

usually under cover of night.

Once a shade hunter sets out,

he doesnt turn back for any

reason other than to save

his hide. He will stay in the

eld for as long as necessary,

turning over every stone in

search of the secret hoard

he knows is there.

When he nds a hoard

that  has  already  been

claimed  or  runs  into  a

shade  dig  site,  a  shade

hunter  acts  proactively

to recover the treasure he

believes is rightly his. He

will use guerrilla tactics

against a dig site, attempt-

ing to disrupt the operation

enough to drive the shades

away. If fresh tracks lead

away from a site, a shade

hunter will follow them

and ambush those who beat

him to the punch. As in all

situations, however, should

things turn sour, retreat is

an easy option.

NPC Reactions

Its hard to miss a group of adventurers coming into townthey

spend gold like water, usually make a mess of the place, and have

a penchant for uncovering trouble where there was none before.

Shade hunters are no different, although they tend to look for

trouble outside town rather than in the middle of it. Still, they

are a sight to see, with their overstuffed backpacks and jangling

bandoleers, and they always bring interesting tales and items to

delight children and tavern patrons alike.

Shade hunters are often seen as aloof and distracted because

they are often lost in thought about a recent exploit or future

endeavor. They are often excellent storytellers, however, and have

picked up a millenniums worth of legends to recount.

Shades, obviously, have a very strong dislike of shade hunt-

ers. Rival artifact hunters and treasure seekers can be jealous at

times, but all such individuals share a kinship that allows them

61

Loughlin Hale, a shade hunter

Prestige Classes

to overcome petty rivalries quite easily. Merchants and arcanists

love shade hunters for the stories and strange objects they bring

back from their adventures, but town leaders often fear the evil

that such explorers often dredge up in their wake. More than

once, a shade hunter has unwittingly unleashed some demon or

other trapped terror, only to skip town before he even realizes

what devastation he has caused.

Loughlin Hale and Company (EL 8)

A edgling shade hunter mistakes the PCs for enemies. Loughlin

assures the characters that all will be well if they just hand over

the loot. Backing him up are his hawk animal companion and

a pair of hired thugs named Garyn and Sogar (use the 3rd-level

human ghter statistics presented in Table 416 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide, page 117).

Shade Hunter Lore

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (local Anauroch, Dalelands,

High Forest, the North, Shadovar, Silver Marches, or Western

Heartlands) can research Netheril and the shade hunters. A

character with contacts among any adventuring shades can get

quite a bit of information, and asking around at libraries and

arcane shops can prove fruitful as well. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Treasure hunters come through here all the time.

Give the inn down the road a try; the tavernkeeper used to be

one himself.

DC 15: They dont so much as hate the shades as they want

their power. Find a shade dig site, and youll nd a shade hunter

lurking nearby.

DC 20: The character hears about a shade hunter that has

been in town for some time preparing for a journey, or they are

put on the trail of one who left not too long ago.

DC 30: At this point the character gains information about

specic shade hunters, shade operatives who might be seeking to

assassinate a hunter, or even uncover a hidden cache of equipment,

maps, and plans that was left behind by a shade hunter who never

returned from his last journey.

Shade Hunters in The game

Shade hunters can be anywhere you want them, even outside the

normal areas of exploration. After all, the sources of ancient

Netherese lore are not conned to the northern regions, they are

just concentrated there. Shade hunters can be used as an excellent

source of knowledge and lore, and might even lead characters

to old dungeons that have long since been cleared of anything

of interest. These dungeon experts can play the role of mentor

to a rogue, ranger, or even a bard, and can provide specialized

equipment from all over the world. Whether used as a mentor, a

sage, or a fence, a shade hunter is a fun and intruiging personality

to interact with.

Players who enjoy the challenge of dungeons lled with traps

and gold will enjoy playing a shade hunter, as will those who

crave the power of ancient Netheril. Those who prefer skill use

to combat will be well served by the class as well.

Adaptation: Shade hunters could be hunting the descendants

and magic of any lost empire in your world.

Encounters: Shade hunters generally shy away from combat

unless they are trapped or their enemy has a treasure they covet.

When they do ght, they are liable to call upon all sorts of dirty

tricks in order to win the day.

Thayan Gladiator

Ive wielded every weapon man and dwarf have invented, but

nothing compares to these.

Elak, minotaur gladiator, while cleaning

the gore of his last opponent off his horns

Popular and skillful gladiators ll the arenas of Faern

from Calimshan to the Dragon Coast, but the brutal Thayan

gladiators are the best of the best. Thayans see the misery of

humans day in and day out, so they demand more out of their

entertainment. The slave pits of the Red Wizards and the

tharchions (the civil rulers in Thay) are lled with monsters

and humanoids from around the realmsthe sharper the claws

and the longer the horns, the better. Minotaurs and lizardfolk

from the Thayan plateau, yuan-ti from the Jungles of Chult,

wemics and gnolls from the Shaarall of these creatures ght

in the arenas of Thays cities. The greatest and most vicious

of these ghters are sometimes pulled out of the pits to serve

a Red Wizard or other powerful master; the weak are left to

ght and die.

Becoming a Thayan Gladiator

Thayan gladiators are taken from all over Faern by slavers who

know the captives will fetch a high price on the plateau. Some,

however, enter the gladiatorial contests voluntarily, either to

avoid work they nd frustrating or demeaning or to attempt to

win a better life as a Red Wizards guard or an adventurer. For

creatures of a more savage nature, the arena might be the only

place where they can revel in their true nature without being

killed on the spot for their transgressions. Most gladiators are

ghters or barbarians, although a few levels in rogue can grant

additional mobility and teach them dirty tricks. Strength (for

brutalizing opponents), Dexterity (for avoiding blows), and

Constitution (for withstanding assaults) are key abilities for a

Thayan gladiator.

Class Skills (2 + Int modier per level): Bluff, Climb,

Intimidate, Jump, Sense Motive, Spot.

Study Opponent (Ex): You prefer to circle your opponents

before engaging them in melee, searching them for weaknesses and

noting the way their bodies move. You can study any opponent

within 30 feet as a standard action for a number of rounds equal

to your Wisdom modier (minimum 1 round). For each round

you study, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and AC during

the round that you rst engage them in melee combat.

Improved Critical: At 2nd level, your improved natural attack

gains the benet of the Improved Critical feat.

Natural Armor: Beginning at 2nd level, your natural armor

improves by 1 point to help you withstand the awesome blows of

your gladiatorial opponents. At 5th and 8th levels, your natural

armor improves by an additional point.

Stunning Critical (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, any time you

make a successful critical hit with your chosen natural weapon,

your enemy must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15 + your Str

modier) or be stunned for 1 round.

Silver Strike (Ex): At 3rd level, attacks from your chosen

natural weapon overcome damage reduction as if they were

silvered weapons.

Natural Weapon Focus (Ex): At 4th level, you gain the ability

to make an additional strike at a 5 penalty with your chosen

natural weapon when you use a full attack action.

Imbue Natural Weapon (Su): At 5th level, your chosen natu-

ral weapon gains a special ability as if it were a magic weapon.

Choose one special ability from the following list and apply it

to your natural weapon(s): aming, frost, ghost touch, shock, or

thundering.

At 10th level, the ritual you underwent upon becoming a

Thayan gladiator grants you a nal power from the following list

to apply to your chosen natural weapon: anarchic*, axiomatic*,

64

disruption, aming burst, icy burst, shocking burst, speed**,

unholy, or wounding.

In order to choose one of these, the Thayan gladiators align-

ment must match the appropriate ability (the character must be

chaotic to choose anarchic or lawful to choose axiomatic).

*The effect of this ability stacks with the additional attack

gained from the natural weapon focus ability (see above).

Adamantine Strike (Ex): At 6th level, attacks from your

chosen natural weapon overcome damage reduction as if they

were adamantine weapons.

Savage Strike (Ex): At 7th level, the critical multiplier for

your chosen natural weapon increases by one. Thus, if you had

a critical multiplier of 2, it would become 3; if it was already

3, it becomes 4.

Natural Weapon Mastery (Ex): Starting at 8th level, the extra

attack you gain from natural weapon focus is at your highest

base attack bonus.

Magic Strike (Ex): At 9th level and higher, attacks from your

chosen natural weapon overcome damage reduction as if they

were magic weapons.

Playing a Thayan Gladiator

You have become a nely honed killing machine, spraying the

blood of your opponents across the dirt oors of arenas from

Eltabbar to Surthay. Not surprisingly, you want to escape

slaveryit chafes at you as roughly as the collar they place

around your neckbut as long as you are someone elses prop-

erty, you might as well enjoy it as best you can. Occasionally

one of your comrades gets his freedom, or as close to it as you

could dream, and this hope gives you the strength you need to

fend off the vicious creatures they pit you against when Arena

Day rolls around.

Your master also uses you as a political and social weapon,

since a successful gladiatoral stable can open many doors in

Thayan societyand bankrupt rival owners as well. Regardless,

the attention is good, and occasionally you are invited to leave

the pits and mingle with the men in red. They show you off like

a trophy, and marvel at the cold stare that you give them as they

analyze your esh and bone. Losing in the pits means death, and

that is a fate you are not ready to accept.

Your ultimate goal is escape, or at least to be set free from

the pits to once again taste the open air. The most successful

gladiators become the personal guard of the red-clad wizards and

scheming bureaucrats who own the ghting stables. You have

learned to either love or hate the one who owns you, and while

the latter emotion might be more satisfying, it is the former

that leads to freedom. You look up at the minotaur guardian

in the Red Wizards box, as he looks down on the pits where

he once fought, and you dream that one day it could be you up

there in his place.

Combat: You cut a more imposing gure on the battleeld

than an average member of your race. You are larger, stronger,

and faster than most, and your natural weapons have developed

into intimidating tools that frighten your opponents. Ranged

combat is not your forte, although you are not quick to close

with an enemy that might have an advantage on you. You prefer

to circle for a bit rst, gauging your opponents strengths and,

more important, his weaknesses. Once you enter combat, you do

not break off. You look for the quickest way to get your hands

around your opponents throat, to claw, bite, or gore him until

he cannot rise from the arena oor.

You do not always ght alone in the arena, and you can

appreciate the benets of having an ally at your side. If you

are a rogue, you should look to maximize your sneak attack

opportunities by pouring skill points into Tumble, allowing you

to more easily ank opponents when a friend is nearby. Focusing

all your attacks on a single opponent allows you to minimize

the dangers you face in the arena. Power Attack and Weapon

Specialization help you in this regard,

while Cleave can grant you extra

attacks when you most need

them. One thing you have

learned in the arena, how-

ever, is never to turn your

back on your friends; they

might just be waiting for

the opportunity to settle

an old score.

As your skills peak, you

are able to make powerful

strikes that stun opponents who,

because they pose no threat, allow

you to focus your attention else-

whereperhaps at the yuan-ti

attempting to turn your ank.

Just dont get caught between

two enraged opponents,

or  your  ghting  days

will quickly come to a

bloody end.

A d v a n c e m e n t :

Thayan gladiators are

taken from all across

Faern and brought to

the plateau to be used as

slaves. They might not make it into

the pits directly, being used for physical

labor or muscle for a while before being sent to train as a

gladiator. In some cases it is the savage nature of a slave that

forces his master to keep him in the dungeons. Once there,

the gladiator is put in a cage, sometimes with creatures of the

same race, depending on their temperament. This is where he

stays until his rst Arena Day, when the gladiators are armed

as their masters see t and sent out to ght. This day, called

the blooding, is an important one for the gladiators, although

most do not know it.

Those who survive their blooding are given their own cells

and offered equipment and training facilities. The quality and

nature of such boons varies from arena to arena, and owners

can provide supplemental equipment to their ghters as they

desire. Some owners prefer to fully equip their ghters, provid-

ing whatever weapons and armor they need to win the day on

the arena oor. These are the most competitive owners, often

politically motivated tharchions or successful merchants with

leadership aspirations. They want to see their stable of ghters

triumph over all comers, and often wager large amounts of

gold, magic, or favors on the outcome of the battles. Gladi-

ators with a generous master are in a tricky situationthe

more successful they are, the more lavish the gifts are likely

to be, but the chances for freedom under these circumstances

diminish with each victory.

Once you start down the path of

the Thayan gladiator, there

is no turning back. The

training you undergo turns

your body into a weapon

more  deadly  than  any

sword, spear, or axe. You

can never be disarmed, and

you no longer rely on the

craftsmanship and magic of

others to increase your power.

You can enchant your body in

ways that no others canand in

a land ruled by powerful wizards,

that can make you more valuable

than gold.

Resources: As mentioned, a

slaves owner often provides him

with the necessary tools to be

successful in the arenas. This

is  doubly  true  for  those

gladiators who have been

withdrawn from the ghts

to  serve  their  masters

elsewhere;  a  tharchion

or Red Wizard using a

gladiator as a bodyguard

or loyal treasure seeker has

every reason to make sure

such servants are well equipped.

Nearly any mundane item will be readily

available to you should you require it, and

magical goods can be procured with little trouble. Thay is a

land of magicians and merchants, brimming with anything an

adventurer might need.

Your natural weaponry is sufcient to overcome almost any

enemy, so when you seek out magic items you should look for

protective items such as magical armor or amulets of natural

armor. A cloak of displacement or ring of blur is a good invest-

ment that can keep you safe from enemies with even more

fearsome physical attacks than your own, although you dont

encounter such foes very often. There is generally little time

for potions in your line of work, but having a healing potion

or two handy for times when arena medics cant get to you will

be to your advantage.

Thayan Gladiators

in the World

Thayan gladiators are among the most fearsome bodyguards and

adventurers in Faern. They have been conditioned to serve their

masters faithfully and to enjoy the art of combat to an almost

sadistic point. When not ghting in the pits of Thay, they can be

found accompanying Red Wizards and other important Thayan

luminaries both inside their country as well as on trips to cities

far and wide. When a Red Wizard is assigned to a distant enclave,

he often takes some or all of his gladiators, for personal safety

and to present an intimidating front to any who would think of

attacking the enclave.

Organization: Gladiatorial contests are among the most

popular entertainments in Thay. The downtrodden population

never passes up a chance to watch even more aggrieved souls

battle each other in the pits. The games also offer those with

less power than a zulkir and less inuence than a tharchion an

opportunity to compete in the politics of Thay. An apprentice red

wizard or merchant can actually elevate his status by building a

successful stable of ghters and then wagering on the outcome

of the ghts. Of course, the tharchions still have an advantage

in these dealingsthey control the nature of each ght, and

can introduce elements to tip the advantage in their favor. Such

underhanded tactics are a time-honored tradition in Thay, and

no competitor begrudges his host these little games.

Gladiators who are incredibly successful, or who show a

determined will above and beyond their fellows, are often

chosen by the zulkirs to be the recipients of magical experi-

ments designed to improve their prowess inside the arena. Their

strong bodies and weak minds are a perfect combination for

the arcane rituals performed by the Red Wizards. Indeed, some

of the rituals created ages ago by Druxus Rhym, the zulkir of

Transmutation, to bestow upon the rst Thayan gladiator his

amazing powers, are still in use. Ever since that time, the most

successful gladiatorial stables have paid for their most promising

ghters to undergo the ritual that will (hopefully) allow them

to grow into fearsome beasts.

When they are rst captured, potential gladiators are beaten,

told they will be killed, and generally mistreated. Those that are

not shaken by this initiation are the most apt to survive. Once

he has proven himself in the arena, however, things change

quite rapidlyhe is moved to a private cell and given food,

water, and the opportunity to bathe and dress his wounds. Most

gladatorial stables have their own healers, and while many of

these are not clerics, their skills keep the gladiators fresh and

healthy for the next ght. Gladiators that do not show signs of

rebelliousness are often granted access to weapons and armor

as well. In their down time, the gladiators that arent caged up

mill about underneath the arena, either training or spending

leisure time with cards, dice, and other games. Friendships

among gladiators are rare, however, since they could be pitted

against one another at any time.

One enterprising merchant named Varouk Pital uses the arena

as a method to train treasure hunters, who he sends out after

rumored artifacts and valuables. He treats his gladiators well, so

that when he offers them their freedom they will work for him

with no hard feelings. So far his gambit has been successful, and

he hasnt had to defend himself against a grudge-holding slave.

His mercantile interests have more than doubled since he started

participating in the games, and this bounty is well defended by

his stable of former gladiators. Thats not to say he hasnt lost

any valuables along the waysome of his ghters never return,

and entire groups have been lost to traps and monsters while

searching for lost gold.

NPC Reactions

The common folk of Thay love to either cheer or jeer the

Thayan gladiators. On the one hand, they are seemingly in even

a worse position than the craftsmen and laborers that ll the

stands. The gladiators are ghting for their lives on an almost

daily basis, and most of them are beasts to begin with. On the

other hand, gladiators are a source of amusement for those who

rarely nd any joy in their everyday lives. Some of the gladiators

and stables decorate themselves and their equipment with bright

colors, feathers, or other distinctive garb, allowing spectators to

wager on their favorite team or ghters.

When they are encountered outside the arenaa rarity unless

they are freegladiators are typically greeted by awe and fear.

Sometimes a stable will be paraded through town on its way into

the arena, and on the way out again if they were particularly

victorious. During these parades the crowd often throws either

rotten fruit or tokens of respect at the gladiators, who are either

chained together or visible in barred cages atop horse-drawn carts.

A rival stable might attempt to assassinate gladiators during

these parades; when this happens, the streets are littered with the

bodies of those who were caught in the storm of swords, claws,

and blood.

Thayan Gladiator Lore

Characters with Knowledge (local Thay) can research the Thayan

gladiators and the arenas they ght in. They can get basic

information of the ghts from fans by combing the streets and

taverns, while more detailed information will have to come from

a gladiator or the owner of a stable. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The gladiators are the most privileged (poorest) class

of slaves in Thay. They get treated the best (worst), have the most

(least) freedom, and often (never) win their freedom.

DC 15: There is more than meets the eye to the gladiators.

Their owners use them to settle feuds, curry favor, and gain the

upper hand in the constant political maneuverings that are a

part of the daily life of Thay.

DC 20: The character learns of a secret entrance to the arena

dungeons, or learns the location of an upcoming secret meeting

between free gladiators.

DC 30: A character who tracks down this much information

about the local gladiatorial scene could learn of a plot by the

local tharchion to kill a hated rivals prized gladiator, a planned

66

Prestige Classes

breakout that could cause the deaths of dozens of innocents, or

the secret identity of a Harper agent that has inltrated the

ranks of a red wizards stable.

Thayan Gladiators

in The game

The characters could be visiting a Thayan city on Arena Day,

or be there to see a parade of gladiators come into or leave the

city. The characters might be contacted by one of a gladiators

comrades, who needs help to spring the ghter from the

dungeons, or an escaped gladiator might look to join up with

a party that can successfully smuggle him out of Thay before

he is tracked down.

Players who like monstrous characters will particularly enjoy

this class, since it allows them to take their characters natural

advantages and make them more powerful and interesting. The

ability to add weapon qualities to natural attacks offers the chance

to make a unique PC that will be remembered long after the

campaign is over.

Adaptation: Any world with monstrous characters and an

oppressive society with gladiatorial games could have developed

the rituals to make their ghters more impressive and exciting.

It helps if the society in question can tolerate free monstrous

humanoids wandering the streets and serving as bodyguards

and enforcers.

Encounters: Thayan gladiators are not trusting, and they

intimidate others to get what they want. Meeting a band of

stalwart adventurers that refuse to take any lip from the gladiator

might be enough to provoke combator a respectful interest.

Vengeance Knight

Youve crossed my employers, and Im here to make you pay.

Kade Steele of Athkatla, a vengeance knight

Vengeance knights roam the Lands of Intrigue in search of

those who have committed acts of treachery against their em-

ployers, the Knights of the Shield. As a vengeance knight, you

67

Prestige Classes

are a master of steel, as comfortable in your heavy plate armor

as others are in courtly vestments or adventuring clothes. The

sword is your weapon of choice, and you use it well to intimidate

and eliminate the enemies of the Knights. Vengeance knights

often wear fearsome helmets or emblazon their armor with

symbols that strike fear into the hearts of their enemies before

steel is even drawn.

Becoming a Vengeance Knight

Vengeance knights are specially trained warriors who have pledged

their service to the Knights of the Shield, a group of politicians

and merchants with inuence in governments from Athkatla

to Calimport. They are a special breed of enforcers used by the

organization to cow their enemies into compliance. Fighters most

often become vengeance knights, but blackguards and former

paladins also make good ts because of their heavy armor use,

horsemanship, and martial prowess. Strength (for melee combat),

Constitution (for staying power), and Charisma (for intimidation)

are key abilities for a vengeance knight.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Lawful evil, lawful neutral, or neutral evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Intimidate 6 ranks, Ride 4 ranks, Sense Motive 2

ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, Weapon Focus (any sword).

Special: Prociency with heavy armor and heavy shields.

Class Features

As they increase in level, vengeance knights become more and

more effective in the use of their armor and in dealing damage

to those who have hurt them.

Armor Training (Ex): As a vengeance knight, you always wear

the heaviest armor available to you, and thus you learn to wear

it more effectively through training. Your armor check penalty

imposed by heavy armor and shields for all skills except Swim

is reduced by 1, and you can don your armor as if you had help

(although you still require a servant to help you don half-plate

or full plate).

At 6th level, your armor check penalty for armor is reduced by

3, and you can make a DC 15 Constitution check to avoid being

fatigued from sleeping in your armor. In addition, you take only

half the normal movement penalty for wearing heavy armor.

At 10th level, you have truly mastered the art of wearing

heavy armor. You can now sleep in your armor without penalty,

and your armor check penalties for armor are reduced by 5. In

addition, you can don half-plate or plate mail without assistance,

although it takes twice the indicated time.

Bringer of Vengeance (Ex): As an agent for the Knights of

the Shield, you are often called upon to avenge some slight or to

send a message to an enemy of the organization. Whenever you

have a specic target, you gain the indicated bonus on Intimidate,

Search, Sense Motive, and Spot checks when using these skills

against your target. In addition, you gain the indicated bonus on

all attack rolls and damage rolls against the target.

Counterstrike (Ex): Vengeance knights visit pain upon those

who would hurt them. As a result, you gain the indicated bonus

on all melee attack rolls and damage rolls against any creature

that damaged you in the previous round. This bonus stacks with

that from your bringer of vengeance ability.

Improved Shield Bash: At 2nd level, you gain the Improved

Shield Bash feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites.

Bonus Feat: At 3rd and 9th levels, you can choose a bonus

feat from the ghters bonus feat list.

Arcane Backlash (Su): Any time you successfully save against

any arcane spell when you are the spells only target, the original

caster takes the indicated amount of nonlethal damage as you

lash the energies of his failed spell back at him.

Playing a Vengeance Knight

You were a cruel warrior before, but the Knights of the Shield

have taught you to control and focus your cruelty toward their

own ends. When you walk into a new town, you know that you

are the most dangerous person there. Other people are there

simply to give you information and get out of your way. You

relish your reputation as a juggernaut, and you will never stop

until your job is done.

The Knights of the Shield (see page 150 of Lords of Dark-

ness for more information on this organization) employ as

many vengeance knights as possible at any one time. Vengeance

knights are stationed throughout Tethyr, Amn, and Calimshan

so that their masters revenge can be carried out swiftly, and in

some cases by more than one agent. Recruits are gathered from

the Knights pool of informants and enforcers, a few of whom

are granted access deeper within the organization by virtue of

their talent and temperament. The individual members of the

Knights of the Shield each have in their control a small number

of vengeance knights, who are sometimes used for purposes

outside the purview of the group as a whole. This is not to say

that all such knights are not available to the whole membership;

the relationship is more like that of a mentor and a student than

a master and a servant.

Combat: Vengeance knights are masters of melee combat,

using their single-mindedness to harry an opponent until he

is down before moving on to the next one. Your comfort and

mobility in heavy armor gives you a defensive advantage

over your foes, and your awesome blows can take

down many foes with a single stroke. If you can

engage your enemies on horseback, all the

better, since your improved ability to ride

in heavy armor makes it easier to utilize the

bonus you receive against grounded enemies.

Many vengeance knights focus on feats such

as Power Attack and Cleave to better improve

their melee power, while others focus on mounted

feats such as Mounted Combat and Ride-By

Attack. Vengeance knights who

bear a shield often use feats such

as Improved Shield Bash and Shield

ChargeCW to give them a surprising weapon

in their arsenal should they ever nd themselves

without their favorite weapon.

As you gain levels and your opponents

get tougher, you must focus on feats that

maximize your damage potential, such as

Power CriticalCW and Spirited Charge. Great

Cleave is useful for taking down multiple

weaker foes, but feats such as Improved

Sunder will help you get rid of the

most powerful foes rst, a task

you relish. Since you deal

maximum damage to op-

ponents that strike you, it is

essential that you are able to take hits.

Its more advantageous to square off against a single opponent

rather than many, even though doing that often pits you against

the most dangerous foes on the battleeld.

Things are the same for you at higher levels. You should

continue to increase your damage potential with feats such as

Improved Critical. Acquiring magic items that improve your Will

save is important to maximize your arcane backlash ability, and

magic armor is a must. The more powers you can bestow upon

your armor, the more feared and unstoppable you will become.

Advancement: Vengeance knights are drawn from among the

most capable warriors that work for the Knights of the Shield.

Most often these individuals do not know for whom they truly

workthe Knights do not always wish their motivations and plans

to be traced back to them. Regardless, an invitation to become

a vengeance knight is one not to be taken lightly. The Knights

are offer a chance for a character to become larger than life, a

sanctioned bully with the power and resources to force weaker

beings to do his bidding.

The initial offer generally consists of a place to live and train

in the techniques of heavy armor and devastating melee combat.

Several recruits often train together, living in a common area

that has all manner of equipment and facilities available for their

use. During this time, the Knights

also gauge the recruits psychological

makeup and their willingness to serve.

They feed them information and

misinformation that serves to

confuse the identities of their

employers and their true mo-

tivations. This is done so that

the vengeance knights come

around to seeing their employ-

ers in a favorable light and

their cause as just; this makes

it much easier to inspire the

hatred and zealotry necessary to

create single-minded instruments

of terror. Once a venegance knight

has been properly prepared, he is

sent out into Faern as the

voice and presence of the

Knights of the Shield.

You should keep your Intimidate and

Sense Motive skills polished as you advance

in level. Intimidating a foe or informant is the

most important aspect of a vengeance knights

job, and keeping the local population in check can

help prevent attempts to get rid of the character.

Also, you should try to raise your Strength

score whenever possible. If you have not

taken Weapon Specialization, it is worth

an extra level of ghter or two to

do so before entering the vengeance

knight class.

Resources: Vengeance knights are ar-

rogant ghters, and they dont like help.

When a vengeance knight is on a mission for the Knights of

the Shield, he considers it his personal duty to intimidate, shake

down, or murder his target. If another vengeance knight is sent

for the same purpose, the two might openly clash. A vengeance

knight might bring his friends along for support, but he insists on

doing the killing himself. That said, vengeance knights working

the same territory (both stationed in Darromar, for instance)

will assist each other with information or specialized gear for

missions on which they do not conict.

A vengeance knights sword and armor are his most prized

possessions. They allow him to carry out his duties in the most

brutal and direct fashion, and are the core of his combat capability.

Since a vengeance knight must never inch from confrontation,

he should focus on purchasing enhancement bonuses and special

qualities for his armor as quickly as possible. Spell and energy

resistances are good for neutralizing enemy spellcasters, while

Vengeance Knights

in the World

The vengeance knights are a prestigious arm of the Knights

of the Shield, for whom each knight works solely. They are

not so much a group as a conglomeration of individuals with

similar training who perform missions for individual members

of the larger organization. The Knights of the Shield are a

clandestine group with mercantile and political interests all

around the lands of Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr. Individual

members take ownership of a vengeance knight, whom they

can then dispatch at their whim to cajole stubborn merchants or

eliminate particularly troublesome enemies. While the Knights

of the Shield are subtle in their machinations, their vengeance

knights take great pride in being forthright and direct when

carrying out their duties.

Organization: Every vengeance knight is linked to a particular

member of the Knights of the Shield, known as his patron. A

patron has little authority over another members vengeance

knight, and cannot call him away from his duties, or even force

him to obey commands. A patron might loan his vengeance

knight to another patron for a short period of time in exchange

for another favor. Vengeance knights are often played against

one another as proxies in internal power plays within the Knights

of the Shield. One might be manipulated into embarrassing his

patron, a situation that often leads to the death of the vengeance

knight in order for the patron to save face.

Patrons use their vengeance knights for a variety of purposes.

The most common use is the shakedown of a politically trouble-

some enemy, usually either a popular but unafliated candidate or

an out-of-control ally. Merchants who do not play by the Knights

rules are also often targeted, although this turn of events can lead

to larger issues if the Rundeen or Shadow Thieves have business

with the individual. Sometimes a public assassination or severe

beating can be an effective tool, even if the target has nothing

to do with the issue at hand.

Although every vengeance knight serves a patron, he is

not required to always be at his patrons beck and call. Most

vengeance knights are released into an area that coincides with

their patrons interests, and then left to their own devices until

they are needed.

Vengeance knights are powerful enough that they often hire

themselves out to other wealthy patrons, although their allegiance

always lies rst with the Knights of the Shield. Some nd a

group of allies with complementary skills to adventure with,

taking treasure from humanoid strongholds or exploring ancient

catacombs and abandoned ruins. Not all vengeance knights are

active in this way, however. At least one is known to reside in

a villa in Riatavin, where he indulges in a variety of pleasures

in between assignments. He is a popular guest among the citys

younger nobles, most of whom are far removed from the trade

and politics that make up the knights unpleasant business.

This vengeance knight, Korben Slade, is known as The Rigar, a

nickname derived from a popular leisure game played in Amn, of

which Korben is a master. The Rigar was already an experienced

adventurer when he was offered a position within the Knights

of the Shield. His past earnings were enough to set him up in

relative luxury while he awaited assignments, and his stipend as

a vengeance knight covers some of his more exotic expenses. His

villa features all manner of exotic creatures from around Faern,

as well as several monsters he collected during his adventuring

days. He sometimes uses these monsters to intimidate those who

have displeased his patron.

As stated, The Rigar prefers to spend his time among the

young nobles of the city. The fact that his business sometimes

puts him at odds with the areas older merchants and politicians

makes him wary of forming friendships among that group. His

parties are always well stocked with the nest food and drink,

and he even invites an associate of his to bring the pleasures of

Sharess to the gatherings.

The young nobles, in turn, look up to The Rigar and con-

stantly question him about his adventures. He embellishes his

tales enough to keep his audience interested, and never seems to

run out of fodder for his stories. A quick tour of the more exotic

monsters in his villa conrms his more outlandish yarns, and

the monsters keeper, a wily, one-eyed half-orc named Crill who

used to travel with The Rigar, throws in his own reminiscences

from time to time.

Korben Slade is a powerfully built man; his arms are as big

as an ogres, and he stands almost six and a half feet tall. He

wears only half-plate armor when called to duty, a personal touch

that adds to his mystique. His black-bladed longsword only leaves

its sheath when blood is going to be spilled, a last resort in The

Rigars mind. He knows that his presence is tolerated in Riatavin

partially because he keeps the young nobles out of trouble, so

he prefers to conduct his business through intimidation rather

than bloodshed.

Some of the other vengeance knights look upon The Rigar in

disgust, believing him to be an indolent who sullies their ranks

with his hedonistic lifestyle and aversion to bloodshed. None of

the other knights have taken action against himif for no other

reason than that he is among the most powerful of thembut

words have own on more than one occasion, and Slades patron

has been questioned by other members of the Knights of the

Shield from time to time. While no formal code binds the knights,

The Rigars death would provoke action by his patron, leading to

the death of whoever perpetrated the act.

NPC Reactions

When a vengeance knight appears, everyone knows something

bad is going to happen. Even those who are not familiar with

the knights line of work cannot ignore his battle gear and grim

determination. Easily cowed members of the local populace will

be immediately friendly to the knight, while those with whom

the knight might have business will be indifferent or even hostile

70

Prestige Classes

as they try to keep the knight at bay. Savvy tavernkeepers and

merchants know that they can freely overcharge a vengeance

knight, whose single-minded drive makes no price unpayable, and

no price hike likely noticed.

Local authorites are rarely happy to see a vengeance knight

show up in their jurisdiction. Its bad enough when adventurers

come blowing through, bringing trouble more often than not,

but a vengeance knight makes trouble that doesnt end when he

leaves. Since the knights target successful merchants and politi-

cians, the stir a visit causes tends to linger for days or even weeks,

and can mean the loss of one of a communitys most beloved or

benecial citizens.

Vengeance Knight Lore

Characters with Knowledge (local Amn, Calimshan, or Tethyr)

can research the vengeance knights or the Knights of the Shield.

An encounter with a vengeance knight is sure to make the

characters curious, whether or not they are his intended targets.

When a character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the

following, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: It is an unwise man who crosses the Knights of the

Shield.

DC 15: The Knights of the Shield have specialized enforcers,

called vengeance knights, who wreak havoc upon their foes.

DC 20: Each vengeance knight has a patron within the

Knights of the Shield. The easiest way to get to a knight might

be through his patron, and vice versa.

DC 30: A character with this level of contacts can nd a

particular vengeance knight, and will also know the knights

patron within the larger organization.

Vengeance Knights

in The game

A vengeance knight can enter the game either during one of his

missions or as a foreboding character present in a new location.

If on a mission, the knight could enter a domain familiar to the

characters, perhaps being is sighted at their favorite inn.

The chance to become a vengeance knight should appeal to

players who like to be a part of larger organizations, as well as

those who like to throw their muscle around. A vengeance knights

duties to his patron should only occasionally interfere with the

goals of the characters party, but they can serve as excellent

tools for the DM to provide adventure hooks that interest the

other characters as well.

Adaptation: Any group could employ specially trained enforc-

ers. The class is especially appropriate for political and mercantile

groups, but could also include thieves and wizards guilds, slavers,

or even brutal governments.

Encounters: The appearance of a vengeance knight could signal

trouble for the PCs, or it could simply be a chance encounter as

the knight moves on toward another unlucky soul. Vengeance

knights are not shy about gathering information, so it is quite

likely that the PCs will become involved, in one way or another.

that will give it eternal life and power beyond imagining. Until

that time, it engages in a number of illegal activities in order

to fund its research and recruiting. Often, living dragons aid

a cell in these endeavors for a share of any treasureand to

bask in the reverence the cults members pay them. Even if it

never achieves its ultimate goal of a world ruled by cult-created

dracoliches, a Cult of the Dragon cell can often mean misery

for its law-abiding neighbors.

Most of those outside the cult believe its members, or at the

very least its leaders, to be insane. The idea of creating dracoliches

so that they can rule the world is outside the realm of comprehen-

sion for most people, although the cults successes are undeniable.

A few groups, such as the Harpers, understand that as crazy as

the cults goal might be, their methods and activities have dire

consequences for the world.

Areas of Influence

The Cult of the Dragon is as widespread now as it has ever been,

aided by the apocalyptic happenings of the past twenty years. One

thing is for certain, thoughmore and more dracoliches are being

reported across Faern. The cult is also pursuing a new goalthe

construction of a major fortress from which the cults activities

can proceed without interruption. The recent uncovering of the

Well of Dragons, a legendary dragon graveyard, has agitated

the cults members and caused an upsurge in activity across the

continent. The fortress will give the cult its rst serious base

of operations, but its construction has been delayed by dragon

attacks and poor planning. One thing on which all can agree is

that should the group complete construction of this fortress, it

will become a fearsome power in the Western Heartlands region

and beyond.

Aside from the Well of Dragons, several other powerful cult

cells have either created a dracolich already or are well on their

way to it. The Sembian cell is perhaps the most well established;

it has produced many of the cults leaders, and established the

groups tradition of wearing purple robes. A troubled cell in

Evil is often experienced randomly, like weeds sprout-

ing up between the cracks of a civilized society. In

some places, however, evil is carefully cultivated,

nurtured, and able to do great harm. Evil organizations are often

looking for new recruits: innocents they can corrupt, or powerful

characters who can further their goals.

Cult of the Dragon

The Cult of the Dragon is a fellowship of men and women across

Faern who believe the prophecies of their founder, Sammaster,

a crazed archmage and fallen Chosen of Mystra. He revealed

through the translation of obscure prophecies that the fate of

all the nations of Faern was to be ruled by undead dragons.

Starting from the time of his discovery of this prophetic vision,

Sammaster gathered to him necromancers and others who could

assist in preparing for their version of Faerns future. Their rst

goal was the creation of a dracolich, or undead dragon, a task

they rst accomplished in 902 DR. The rituals and components

necessary to create a dracolich were transcribed in the Tome of

the Dragon, a holy relic that is now used by the cults many cells

to raise their own dracolich allies.

The cult is now spread out across Faern, with cells in places

as disparate as Amn, the Western Heartlands, and Sembia. Its

leaders are known as The Wearers of Purple, in recognition of

the ceremonial robes they wear. The cults cells are independent

of one another for the most part, and each has a rare, scribed

copy of the Tome of the Dragon that it guards to the last member.

Each cell cultivates relationships with local dragons in the hope

that one day the dragon will be tempted to undergo the ceremony

Westgate whose refusal to join forces with the Night Masks has

caused a feud that leaves it eternally weakened and unprepared

to complete the rite of undeath. This cells weakness has caused it

to lose the interest of the true dragons it once courted, and so it

has been forced to turn to dragon turtles from the Dragonmere

as possible candidates for lichdom.

Regions

The following regions have cells with enough resources and

leadership to be strong threats to their neighbors. Many other

cells are spread throughout Faern, but these are the most

dangerous and organized.

Aglarond: The Cult of the Dragon has a long history of

strife with the Red Wizards, who seek its knowledge for them-

selves. Any cells that were in Thay long ago joined together

and relocated to the western edge of the Dragonjaw Mountains,

where they have easy access to the Sea of Fallen Stars, but nd

themselves hampered, ironically enough, by the copper dragons

that live there.

The Dragon Coast: As mentioned, recent ghting with the

Night Masks in Westgate has weakened this cell, but it is still

dangerous because of its alliance with several of the dragon turtles

that roam the nearby waters. Should the cell create a new rite

for use on dragon turtles, that would lead to the unleashing of

even more dangerous creatures upon the world.

Sembia: The members of this cell, the oldest and most powerful

of the cult, believe they hold a sort of stewardship over the rest

of the organizations cells. They concern themselves not only

with the cults ultimate goal of creating dracoliches, but also with

aiding other cells when they can and overseeing construction of

the Well of Dragons. While they do not have any direct control

over most of the cells, their oversight does make each cell more

efcient and sustainable.

Western Heartlands: Two factions are at work in this region

the cell that has existed in the region for decades, which discovered

the Well of Dragons, and the taskmasters and laborers sent by

the Sembian cell to oversee the construction of this all-important

fortress. The original cell has strong relationships with many of

the dragons that live in the Forest of Wyrms, and has even made

overtures (and generous offerings) to Ringreemeralxoth, a green

dragon and the self-styled ruler of the Snakewood in northeast

Amn. The members of this cell somewhat resent not being put

in charge of the fortresss construction, but trust in the words

of their founder Sammaster, who preaches that All shall be one

when the dragons rule the world.

usually recruit under the guise of an outlaw band rather than a

cult. In the past, cult activities have been severely disrupted by

the Harpers and other enemies, who pose as new recruits to gain

access to the groups inner workings. Despite these troubles, the

cult has a very lax policy on welcoming new recruits. It believes

that anyone wise (or crazy) enough to follow the words of Sam-

master should be allowed to share in his glory.

Recruits come from all areas, but regions with more active

criminal networks account for the bulk of new members. The

Sembian cell actively seeks raw, inexperienced recruits who are

then sent to cells throughout Faern. They look for those with

nothing to keep them tied to a single location, and who are

weak-willed enough to be indoctrinated and sent on their way.

More experienced recruits usually stay with the Sembian cell,

increasing its power; the other cells are left to their own methods

to recruit more experienced members. One advantage of joining

the Cult of the Dragon is that advancement and status are tied

to ones abilitiesthe recent ascendance of cult member Vargo

Kent (see page 117) to proprietorship of the Well of Dragons

is one such example.

Joining the Cult of the Dragon requires only that one nd

a cell, or one of its front organizations, and petition its leader.

The group will ask for a demonstration of abilities and ask some

general questions meant to gauge the persons character. If these

two trials go well, the character will be invited back for harsher

questioning to make sure he is not a spyif a cleric is available,

this questioning might take place within a zone of truth. The

second round of questioning might be, and often is, skipped in

favor of just indoctrinating the new member and getting him

or her active in the cults endeavors. Sammaster prophesied that

the enemies of the cult would become known to them and be

crushed in the jaws of dragons, so most of the cults leaders just

trust in this, and are happy to use traitors in the meantime.

The cult needs wizards and clerics who can aid in the ritual

outlined in the Tome of the Dragon, but warriors and even rogues

are necessary for the day-to-day operations of the group. Most

of its members are inexperienced and looking for a place in the

world, but sometimes adventurers and powerful spellcasters will

come to the cult to fulll their own ambitions. Many of the cults

cells (particularly desperate ones, such as the group in Westgate)

will accept just about any prospective member who comes along.

Those who would inltrate dragons lairs to make new contacts

for the cult are especially welcomed, as are those rare dragon

hunters who target the good-aligned dragons standing in the way

of the cults success.

Joining the Cult of the Dragon

The cults recruiting efforts are scattershot at best; they direct

most of their energy toward criminal endeavors and maintain-

ing relationship with the local wyrms. Those in charge of the

organizations criminal branches realize they need fresh recruits

to replace those killed in action or taken prisoner, but they

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

Once you join the Cult of the Dragon, it becomes your life.

With few exceptions, cell members live in the same area, work

together toward the cults goals, and interact with those outside

the cult only when they need something. The cults cells remain

74

Evil Organizations

somewhat secretive in this regard, and thus a new member must

leave most of his old life behind him forever. All of a members

effort goes toward the advancement of the cults goals, whether

it be the creation of weapons, the preparation of arcane rituals,

or the defense of the cell and its membership.

Exceptions are granted to adventuring members, who are

given far more leeway in exchange for their silence as to who

they work for and what their goals are. These members usually

move from cell to cell, nding adventure on their travels and

aiding any cell in need of muscle or magic. These adventuring

members get to keep whatever treasure and magic they feel is

necessary, but must pass on lore and unused magic and treasure

to whatever cell they make contact with next. Complete loyalty

is unusual for these adventuring bands, which often refuse to aid

a cell in troublebut the cult as a whole rarely pays attention to

who is doing what and where. It is usually much too focused on

its own far-reaching concerns to hold a grudge against someone

who has not hurt the cult directly.

Becoming a member of the Cult of the Dragon has different

benets, each depending on the strength and skills of the new

recruit. Wizards are granted access to necromantic lore gathered

over the past ve centuries that nonmembers might never gain

access to; just to be able to study the Tome of the Dragon fullls

the lifelong quest of many new members. In addition, a cult

wizard attempting to attract a draconic cohort gains a +2 bonus

on his Leadership score for that purpose, and cult wizards wishing

to have a draconic familiar act as if they are two levels higher

for this purpose. Clerics who join most often do so at the behest

of their gods for one reason or another, or to minister to their

faithful. The most common religions found within the cult are

those dedicated to Bane, Shar, Talos, Talona, and Velsharoon.

Other faiths, sometimes represented by only a single cleric, include

those of Cyric, Gargauth, Malar, and Tiamat.

The cult offers little besides protection and kinship to those

without the abilities necessary to bring undeath to a dragon.

It is not particularly well organized, nor does it have its own

access to weapons or equipment. The best it can offer is some

limited protection from dragons in the area, a place to sleep

and food to eat, and a steady supply of work, whether it be in

the construction of the Well of Dragons, taking part in one of

the groups many criminal endeavors, or protecting cult leaders

and sites of importance.

Acting Within the

Cult of the Dragon

Adventurers who take advantage of being under the auspices of

the Cult of the Dragon have far more freedom than they might

enjoy within another organization. They usually join because they

have similar interests to those of the cult, and so their adventures

are often in line with the cults goals. A group dedicated to seeing

undead dragons rule the world might go searching for draconic

artifacts, seek audiences with powerful dragons in order to draw

them to the cults teachings, or be used as a strike force to ter-

rorize or obliterate the cults enemies. The Cult of the Dragon

is at a crossroads right now, and it has become more proactive

in defending its interests, particularly the Well of Dragons and

the fortress under construction there.

Acting Outside the

Cult of the Dragon

Being afliated with the Cult of the Dragon is not a black mark

against a character in most evil parties. The other members might

see the cultist as a little deranged, but as long as he proves valuable

to the party, there will probably be little prejudice. Of course, he

might always keep his afliation secret, especially if he believes

that something he is looking for might be in conict with the

partys goals. A zealous member might also look to recruit a group

of adventurers, especially if he thinks bringing them into the

organization might increase his ranking and status within it.

Cults of the Moon

The Cults of the Moon is the collective name for several lycan-

thrope-worshiping tribal groups found in various areas of Faern.

Malar (along with Shar, who enjoys the perversion of the moons

power that lycanthropes represent) subtly guides these groups in

their worship, although he does not involve himself directly with

their day-to-day affairs. He also compels the lycanthropes that are

worshiped by the cults to accept the fealty of these groups and to

use their devotion to spread evil in the world. The lycanthropes,

for their part, are generally happy to have servants around. Some

of them would just as soon eat all the pesky beings or sacrice

them to the Hunt without Malars inuence, however. The cults

believe that the lycanthropes favor them (by not eating them,

mostly) and that one day they will lead the vanguard in the war

on civilization that will tear down Faerns cities and establish

the rule of the wild across the continent.

Three main cult tribes exist in Faern, with smaller ones

expanding in other areas or joining up with the larger groups

for increased protection and power. The largest tribe is found in

the Silver Marches, north of Silverymoon near the Cold Wood.

This group of totemic barbarians draws its membership primarily

from the Uthgardt tribes that roam the icy plains and cold forests

of the region. Its leader, Chazzar Ne, a human druid with ties

to the Gray Wolf Uthgardt tribe, believes that the lycanthropes

are sent by Malar to defend the North against the orcs that

constantly ravage the regions natural resources.

A tribe of wild elf and drow cultists in the forest of Corman-

thor has taken to worshiping the lycanthropes in that wood as

a means of survival. As the sect grows in power, however, there

are rumblings among the ranks that survival is not enough of

an incentive to continue paying tribute to the shapechangers.

Their leader, Kaedthis, has recently taken on an advisor, Anasta

Sarth, who is a cleric of Kiaransalee. Sarth is fueling this dis-

75

Evil Organizations

content in a bid to turn the entire cult over to the worship of

the Revenancer.

The only other sect of any size can be found in the jungles

of Chult, under the leadership of a sorcerer who worships a

werebat tribe found in the northern Mistcliff Mountains. He

believes that these creatures are the guardians of night, and

that without them the planet would burn under the heat of a

never-ending sun.

A pack of lycanthropes means trouble for nearby civilized

settlements, but the growth of a cult that worships these beasts

is even worse news. The sects attract disaffected citizens of these

towns and villages, who then inltrate and spy on the townsfolk.

The Cormanthor sect is perfectly suited to this type of informa-

tion gathering, since the drow are naturally treacherous beings.

One day soon, Anasta Sarth will unleash these savage cultists

and their shapechanging idols on the drow, who she then hopes

to raise into an army of powerful undead.

In the North, Chazzar Ne has even more grandiose plans.

She wishes to bring the Uthgardt under her command so that

they can swarm north with the lycanthropes to eradicate the orc

threat forever. Little does she know that the lycanthropes have no

such plans, even if she does succeed in uniting enough barbarians

under her banner. The People of the Black Blood worry that she

might become too powerful, and have considered hunting her

down in order to stop her plans.

The sorcerer-led Chultan sect is isolated from other human

settlements; it has enough to worry about between dinosaur at-

tacks and warding off the goblin attacks that plague its isolated

settlement.

Areas of Influence

The Cults of the Moon are a fractured group of sects that all

have similar goals and direction, thanks to the prodding of Malar

and his allies. Each sect has a strong leader that brings together

those under him to worship nearby lycanthropes (and it is always

a particular group of lycanthropes, not the race in general). The

three largest groups are a sort of trial run for Malar, and their

success (or failure) will determine how much energy he puts into

directing the formation of more sects across Faern.

The sect in the Silver Marches operates out of a semiper-

manent tent town on the plains in between the forests of the

Night Trees. Their leader, the druid Chazzar Ne (see page 119),

was drawn away from her former mentor by Malars promise of

power. Chazzars sect is not hostile toward her former mentor

and his allies.

The drow and wild elves in Cormanthor have a settlement

northeast of Essembra, two miles north of the River Duathamper

and within striking distance of the Halfaxe Trail. They work with

a tribe of weretigers that haunts the woods, coordinating hunts

and attacks on any drow patrols from the other settlements.

Kaedthis has recently become interested in the ruins of Myth

Drannor, believing that with the blessings of Kiaransalee and

Malarand the muscle of the lycanthropesshe can retake the

city and bend the mythal to her will.

Regions

Cults of the Moon sects are active in the following regions, with

further expansion possible anywhere lycanthropes.

little contact with the outside world, but the werebats are only

beginning to understand the gift that Malar has given them.

With a little prodding, the colony might look for a new haunt

in one of the forts that dot the Chultan coastline.

The Dalelands: The Cormanthor drow are often targeted

by this Kiaransalee-worshiping sect. The cultists have avoided

attacking any of the human-populated Dale cities, guring that

the other drow are already stirring up enough attention as it is.

Kaedthis is worried that too much violence will bring down a

concerted effort against all drow in the forest, especially on the

heels of the recent war against the phaerimm.

The Silver Marches: The Uthgardt tribesmen under Chazzar

Ne seek to eradicate the orcs of the North. While the civilized

folk of the Silver Marches might agree with this goal, they

cannot abide by the barbarians alliance with the evil People of

the Black Blood.

Joining the Cults of the Moon

The Cults of the Moon are always accepting new members, and

they are rarely suspicious of those who want to join. After all,

who can deny the awesome power of the werebeasts? Most of

those who join are barbarians or outcastspeople who cannot

or do not function in civilized society. Druids sometimes join,

especially those looking for a deeper insight into their animal

being, and evil rangers are sometimes drawn to the group as well.

The psychological condition of less powerful converts is usually

shaky at best; they are simply looking for a place to belong, or are

so frightened of the world that they feel the need to be protected

by beings greater than themselves. The mere thought of being

eaten by a werebeast is enough to cow them into doing anything

the sects leader desires.

While the Chultan sect rarely recruits from outside its tribe,

the Cormanthor and Silver Marches sects actively recruit from

their respective local populationsdrow and wild elves in the

forest, and disaffected or dominated Uthgardt barbarians on the

cold plains. They generally recruit survivors of a lycanthrope

attack or targeted individuals that they have hunted down.

Sometimes an entire village or tribe will be assimilated into a sect,

especially if it is from a culture in which power and leadership

are synonymous. Powerful adversaries are not recruitedthey

cannot be trusted with the sects secretsbut some do come to the

group through various means. The most obvious example of this

is the cleric Anasta Sarth, who joined with the Cormanthor sect

in order to bring them under the sway of her patron goddess.

Procreation remains the cults most effective means of growing

its population.

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

The primary benet to joining a Cults of the Moon sect is survival.

Anyone not afliated with the cult that wanders into lycanthrope-

controlled territory is liable to be hunted down and torn to bits, and

even those towns and villages that are well established but within

reach of the shapechangers are in constant danger. The cult sees a

membership boost in the days leading up to the High Hunts, and

for a few weeks afterward. Some members gain a thrill by being in

the presence of powerful lycanthropes, and others are enthralled

by the charismatic and willful leaders of these cults.

Another benet for ambitious members is access to the Black

Blood cultist prestige class (see page 44). Some barbarians are

especially attracted to these wild savages once they have seen one

in action. They might lack the shapechanging ability of a lycan-

thrope or druid, but they can combine the best of both worlds to

make themselves harbingers of destruction when they rage. Cult

members become accustomed to the presence of lycanthropes, and

are granted a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with

these creatures. Any character with the Leadership feat treats a

lycanthrope as one level lower when choosing it as a cohort.

There are costs associated with membership, however. The

People of the Black Blood take their worship of Malar seriously,

and even if a sect is not strictly an instrument of the Beastlord,

it is expected to take part in his rituals as fervently as if it were.

Tribe members grow more and more uncomfortable in civilization

the longer they stay with the cult, taking a 1 penalty on all

Charisma-related checks when inside a town, city, fortication,

or other construct of civilization. Finally, powerful applicants

to the tribe are often required to hunt down a good-aligned

creaturewith a CR at least equal to the charactersand offer

it as a blood sacrice to the lycanthropes.

Acting Within the

Cults of the Moon

Cultists can often be found hunting through the forests of

Faern, seeking wild tribes to subjugate, lycanthropes to recruit

as allies, or discovering new lairs for staging raids on civiliza-

tion. A group might be a tribal assemblage, or applicants sent

on a mission to prove their worth. Such missions can often

take months or even years to completeall the better for a

cults leader, who gets potential rivals out of the way for a long

period and gains power and status through their actions. Groups

of cultists sometimes accompany a pack of lycanthropes on a

mission to intimidate or destroy new settlements that threaten

to encroach upon tribal lands.

Acting Outside the

Cults of the Moon

Characters who were either reared in one of the sects or who were

converted later in life have quite a bit of opportunity to adventure.

All three of the sects leaders have need of information from

outside the boundaries of the tribal lands. The lycanthropes, too,

like to keep up with goings-on, and might demand that a human or

elf enter the civilized lands to gather news and procure supplies.

77

Evil Organizations

While treasure does not motivate any of the sects leaders,

they are always searching for hidden bases and lairs within the

civilized lands, and they often send out adventuring groups to

search for such locations. Individuals from the tribe might seek

out others to assist them who know more about local legends

and geography. Once their association is no longer benecial, the

order member might bring these associates into his tribal lands

where his kinsman or the lycanthropes can enjoy slaughtering

them during the High Hunt.

The Eldreth Veluuthra

The Eldreth Veluuthra is a group of fanatical elf supremacists

who have vowed to remove the human scourge from the face

of Faern. It views humanity as a blight upon the land, little

better than an infestation of vermin in dire need of a genocidal

housecleaning. Its members operate throughout Faern, particu-

larly in ancient elf homelands as well as in those forests largely

abandoned during the Elven Retreat, including Ardeep, the

Border Forest, the Chondalwood, Cormanthor, the High Forest,

the Moonwood, the Neverwinter Woods, and the Winterwood.

Wherever human civilization threatens elf interests, the Eldreth

Veluuthra works to slow or halt human encroachmentby any

means necessary.

The Eldreth Veluuthra was formed in 262 DR, a year after

the founding of Myth Drannor. In that year, ve leading elf

houses declared that they could not support the coronals liberal

attitude toward humans, nor could they allow the continued

encroachment of humans into ancestral elf lands. Rather than

battle fellow elves, the ve houses departed Myth Drannor and

began to catalogue the crimes of humans against both nature

and the land they inhabited.

However, the organization did not formally organize until

the Weeping War (711714 DR) and the destruction of Myth

Drannor. Naming themselves the Eldreth Veluuthra (Victorious

Blade of the People), they began to plan to strike a denitive blow.

In 757 DR, a series of murderous raids set the stage for their

protracted battle to end the human infestation of Faern.

Although they consider themselves to be true to the most

traditional and honored elven ideals, most elves are embar-

rassed by the Eldreth Veluuthra and would prefer to see the

organization disappear. And it would have, long ago, if it did

not enjoy secret support at the very highest levels of elf society.

The Eldreth Veluuthra is reasonably well-funded considering

its secretive and destructive ways, and there is no shortage of

elves who publicly espouse cooperation between the races while

privately funneling money, goods, magic and weapons to the

local cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra.

Attitude

The Eldreth Veluuthra is considered evil because of its methods,

but the individual members of the organization do not consider

themselves evil. If anything, they think of themselves as the

caretakers of all that is good in the world. They are constantly

surrounded by evil enemies who would like nothing better than

to remove the last vestiges of elfdom from the face of Faern.

If only the other elves would wake up and see their peril, the

threat might be averted. Unfortunately, far too many of their

kin have been deceived by humanity over the centuries, and it

therefore falls upon the Eldreth Veluuthra to act to save those

who are not even aware of their danger.

Because the Eldreth Veluuthra considers itself to be a group

dedicated to the cause of good, its members continue to worship

the traditional elven pantheon. The gods of the elves do not,

however, reciprocate these feelings. Therefore, no clerics of

the good-aligned elven pantheon are members of the Eldreth

Veluuthra, and no member of the Eldreth Veluuthra would dare

worship a nonelf or evil deity. The members are certain that one

of their gods (most likely Corellon Larethian) will eventually

recognize the merit of their position. For many years, they

were forced to rely upon whatever healing potions they could

purchase, nd or steal. But of late, they have learned (through

the instruction of the druid ice lich, Lossarwyn) to tap directly

into the divine power of nature itself, granting power to druids

and rangers.

Organization

The Eldreth Veluuthra is made up of small cells of like-minded

individual elves. Usually, most of the members of a cell are blood

relatives, further assuring the groups secrecy and the loyalty of

its members. Each cell is virtually autonomous, acting on its own

designs without interference from other groups so long as those

actions further the large-scale goals of the Eldreth Veluuthra.

Regions of Influence

In addition to haunting ancient forests and ruined elf homelands,

cells of the Eldreth Veluuthra can be found nearly anywhere

large populations of elves are found.

Ardeep Forest: Despite its relatively small size, this forest

is home to two cells of the Eldreth Veluuthra. One focuses on

guarding the ruins of Phalorm, making sure adventurers from

Waterdeep have as difcult a time as possible. The other cell

spends most of its time stalking drow worshipers of Eilistraee,

who sometimes visit the Dancing Dell and the sacred rock known

as the Ladystone. The two cells rarely cooperate. The guiding

council of the Eldreth Veluuthra, the VelNikeryma (or Blade

Lords), sometimes dispatches agents to explore the House of

Stone, a dwarf- and elf-built ruin on the edge of the Ardeep, in

search of magic and treasure.

The Border Forest: The Eldreth Veluuthra has found allies

among the fey of this region. Long harried by the Zhents, the

fey creatures of the Border Forest have become hostile to all

intruders. Despite its comparatively small size, the forest offers

78

Evil Organizations

numerous opportunities to further the organizations goals, so

two cells operate within its connes. One cell concentrates on

ambushing Zhentarim agents, while the other raids along the

Daggerdale border. The two cells nd many opportunities to

cooperate, since neither is large enough to make signicant

headway on its own.

The Chondalwood: This is one of the few areas where the

organization has made signicant progress. The Chondalwood is

lled with races sympathetic to its cause, from the centaurs and

satyrs that roam the forest to the ghostwise halings lurking in

the woodlands heart. The wild elves native to this forest provide

safe haven for Eldreth Veluuthra operatives and sometimes join

its larger raiding parties.

Cormanthor: The elf homeland of Cormanthor is the site of

one of the organizations greatest setbacks. After the Elven Court

of Myth Drannor was abandoned during the Elven Retreat, the

Eldreth Veluuthra laid plans to set up a base and begin to reclaim

the entire forest. But before the group could complete its move, it

was driven out by the invading drow of House Jaelre. Since then,

any Eldreth Veluuthra operating in the area have adopted the

tactic of disguising themselves as drow while attacking human

travelers and settlements, thus setting the stage for escalating

reprisals between these two hated groups.

The heart of the elf realm in Cormanthor, Semberholme, is

home to numerous elves, including several agents of the Eldreth

Veluuthra who strive to gain supporters within its leading houses.

There are also cells operating around Bristar and Moonrise Hill

in Deepingdale, as well as near the Tangled Trees. The Vale of

Lost Voices is an area sacred to the Eldreth Veluuthra.

Evereska: Surrounded by a ring of twelve impassible hills

and protected by a powerful mythal, this ancient city is home

to some of the noblest elf families in all Faern. It is also home

to a powerful cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra. Like other cells

operating within elf strongholds, the members here spend most of

their time quietly seeking support, advocating the organizations

goals and spreading its propaganda, all the while sending donated

treasure and supplies out to support the cells operating in the

Graycloak Hills.

Evermeet: A loose cell of spies who report directly to the

VelNikeryma operates on the isle of Evermeet. While the cells

primary purpose is to gather information, it also works to garner

support for the Eldreth Veluuthra among the high families of

the sun elves. The organization enjoys more support among the

most inuential sun elves than anyone would dare to admit or

even believe.

Graycloak Hills: The Eldreth Veluuthra enjoys some of its

strongest support among the moon elves inhabiting these hills

near Evereska. Membership in the Eldreth Veluuthra is almost

openly tolerated here, because the threat from Anauroch and

the City of Shade seems too great to exclude any ally, even

unsavory ones. One cell has dedicated itself to hunting down a

band of human adventurers who have been raiding elven tombs

in the area.

The Gray Forest: Centuries ago, the moon elves of the Gray

Forest were driven out by hobgoblins. However, a small cell of

the Eldreth Veluuthra continues to operate here, sometimes

attacking the hobgoblins and sometimes alerting them to the

encroachment of humans into their territory.

The High Forest: This is one of the largest woodlands in

Faern and home to several cells of the Eldreth Veluuthra. They

are kept busy ghting human encroachment as well as keeping

close watch on Hellgate Keep; one member of the VelNikeryma

was recently slain by the demonfey of that area, and her replace-

ment on the council now leads the northern cell of the High

Forest. The organization has made an uneasy alliance with the

great treant leader Turlang, and it has working arrangements

with the forests centaurs and wild elves. The VelNikeryma

is anxious to learn more about the human settlement called

Olostins Hold, since the humans there live in an almost elven

harmony with nature.

Within the High Forest lies a region known as the Dire

Wood, where an outer ring of massive albino oaks surrounds an

inner ring of blackened, petried trees. Inside these rings lies a

region of hills that seems to stretch far beyond its encompassing

trees. The Dire Wood is home to numerous aberrations, as well

as Lossarwyn, a druid lich who some believe is responsible for

the wizard weather that sometimes erupts from this area. The

Eldreth Veluuthra is actively courting Lossarwyn (see page 83),

since he shares many of its goals and motivations.

The Methwood: Talindra Amalith of the VelNikeryma leads

a cell within the Methwood. Like her, the members of this cell

are wild elves who have suffered many cruelties at the hands of

human adventurers.

The Misty Forest: In the past, the Misty Forest section of

the caravan route to Daggerford, Secomber, and Boareskyr Bridge

was a place where travelers could let down their guardbut not

for much longer. A cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra recently began

operating in this area, scouting out promising ambush sites and

setting up a secret base from which to raid. Though it has not

yet made its rst attack, it is only a matter of time before this

happens.

The Moonwood: This region is home to numerous lycan-

thropes, some of whom are members of the Eldreth Veluuthra.

The only formal cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra in these woods is

often harried by the more populous and better organized People

of the Black Blood.

The Neverwinter Woods: The Eldreth Veluuthra claims that

the forbidding reputation owned by this mysterious forest is due

in no small part to the activities of one of the oldest and largest

cells in the organization. Several other smaller cells also operate

in the area.

Urlingwood: This strange forest is the proverbial and literal

eastern front of the organization. Cell leaders and other

members who draw too much attention to the organization,

who needlessly risk their members lives, who cannot be trusted

with secrets, or who commit any other crime not serious enough

79

Evil Organizations

to warrant execution, are sent to Urlingwood in the country of

Rashemen. Thus, the Urlingwood cell is lled with miscreants

and fanatics; they are charged with driving the witches from the

wood, a hopeless task if ever there was one.

The Wealdath: Two independent cells operate in the Wealdath,

each drawn from the two surviving local tribes of elvesthe

Suldusk and the Elmanesse. Both groups are mostly concerned

with protecting their tribal areas from human encroachment.

Despite numerous failures, the VelNikeryma continues to send

adventuring parties into the heart of the Wealdath in an effort

to retake the ancient elf necropolis of Myth Rhynn and restore

its ancient mythal.

The Winterwood: This forest hosts the only cell of the Eldreth

Veluuthra made up almost entirely of green elves. Considered

backward and undisciplined by many other members of the orga-

nization, the Winterwood cell rarely takes aggressive action against

humans, preferring to maintain the borders and punish intruders.

Instead, members spend much of their time devising ways to drive

Foilsunder, an old male green dragon, from their woods.

Leadership

Each cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra chooses its own leader. Char-

acters wishing to obtain leadership roles within the organization

would do well to either acquire the leadership of an existing cell

or form their own cell in a new area. Unlike in other evil orga-

nizations, members of the Eldreth Veluuthra do not normally

rise to positions of leadership through the elimination of rivals.

The murder of fellow elves is contrary to the ultimate goal of

the destruction of humanity. However, sometimes a leader might

be proven to be incompetentor worse, in league with the

enemyand unwilling to relinquish control. At those rare times,

a cell leader might be eliminated, but only with the approval of

the VelNikeryma.

Although the structure of the Eldreth Veluuthra is cellular,

the organization is guided by a council called the VelNikeryma.

At one time, the VelNikeryma was made up of the leaders of

the original ve families, but all but one of these have long since

been replaced as the fortunes of individuals and families wax

and wane. Today, the council members are chosen by vote from

among the strongest and most senior leaders of individuals cells.

The VelNikeryma collects and analyzes intelligence gathered

from across Faern in order to set the long-range goals of the

organization. They rarely interfere with the actions of individual

cells unless those actions threaten the exposure of a larger goal.

Occasionally, individual members of the organization could be

asked by the council to undertake a specic mission or quest.

The current members of the VelNikeryma are described

below.

Talindra Amalith (CN female wild elf barbarian 15) leads

the Methwood cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra. Of late, she has

divided her time between the Methwood and recruiting among

the wild elves of the Chondalwood.

Saeval Calaudra (NE male moon elf rogue 8/assassin 5)

operates across the length and breadth of Faern, lending his

special skills to support the activities of any cell that needs him.

He serves as the voice of the VelNikeryma to those who might

never otherwise encounter the leadership of the organization.

Calaudra is the youngest member of the VelNikeryma.

Torynnar Rhaevaern (NE male sun elf lich [baelnornMon] wizard

15/archmage 4) is the only surviving member of the original found-

ers of the Eldreth Veluuthra. His wisdom is sought for all important

decisions concerning the society. He has begun to suspect an outside

inuence is at work within the organization, especially among the

Cormanthor cells, but he is not yet ready to speak his mind to the

full council. Although uncertain as to its source, Torynnar last felt

such a power during the fall of Myth Drannor.

Eldaerneth Spellstalker (CE male sun elf enchanter 7/rogue

8) is also a member of the Night Masks, a powerful thieves

guild operating in Westgate. While the Night Masks are not

aware that he is also a senior member of the Eldreth Veluuthra,

neither is Eldaerneth cognizant of the vampiric nature of the

Night Masks leadership. He plays a most dangerous game,

using his position in the thieves guild to funnel information

back to the VelNikeryma. Although the Eldreth Veluuthra

and the Night Masks have vastly different agendas, it is likely

that his employers in Westgate would not look kindly on this

deception.

Bhyrindar Silverhart Tellynnan (CE male moon elf were-

wolf ghter 9/sorcerer 1/arcane archer 5) is one of the newest,

brashest and most popular members of the organization. He

leads a cell operating in the north part of the High Forest. The

organizations failure to gain the full cooperation of Lossarwyn

of the Dire Wood and the treant lord Turlang are largely due to

Bhyrindars impatience with these two ancient creatures.

Recruiting

Obviously, to become a member of the Eldreth Veluuthra, one

must be an elf. Only true elves need apply. This means that drow

are forbidden, as are any half-elf combinations. The majority

of members have historically come from sun elf communities,

though recruitment among wild elves has been growing of late,

especially in the Chondalwood. Moon elves ll out the ranks,

along with the occasional green elf or sea elf.

Among the sun elves and moon elves, membership is largely

drawn from two distinct social strata: young, poor, disenfranchised

elves, and those of old, wealthy families. Wealthy elves make

attractive members because they bring with them the social

connections necessary to expand the organizations inuence and

legitimacy within elf society. At the same time, the organization

needs strong, angry, motivated young people to do the dirty work

of killing humans and stopping the spread of human culture

into elf territory. Wild elves and, to a lesser degree, green elves

make up many of the shock troops and specialists vital to the

organizations goals.

80

Evil Organizations

Allies

The Eldreth Veluuthra has few public allies. The majority of

elves would rather pretend the extremist organization doesnt

even exist. It enjoys most of its limited support among the sun

elves, with agents and members reaching to the highest levels of

society. The other elf races also provide support, though not to

the degree of the sun elves. It is only through the inuence of

the organizations powerful secret allies that the elves have not

suppressed the Eldreth Veluuthra completely.

Members of the Eldreth Veluuthra get along with sylvan

creaturesespecially centaurs, satyrs, and the more aggressive

feywho share their opinion of humanity. They have sometimes

been willing to form brief alliances with evil humanoid races

to accomplish a common goal, such as wiping out a human

settlement, but more commonly they work covertly to instigate

bloodshed between humans and their evil neighbors.

Enemies

The Eldreth Veluuthra has many enemies, especially among the

humans it so desperately wants to destroy. The Harpers have, on

more than one occasion, thwarted the organizations plansso

members of the Eldreth Veluuthra take special delight in set-

ting ambushes for anyone associated with that organization.

They also lay traps for human rangers who dare to enter their

woodlands, since rangers usually presage the arrival of human

settlements. Their relationship with human druids is nearly as

violent, although some members of the organization are opposed

to attacking humans who are so obviously trying to live up to

the elven ideal.

The organization also targets races that it views as elven

abominations, such as any of the half-elf crossbreeds. A number

of voices within the organization have argued in favor of ending

the war against the drow, but this is unlikely to happenmost

of the members hate dark elves nearly as much as they hate

humans.

Although technically evil, the Eldreth Veluuthra also wars

against the more traditional foes of the elvesorcs, goblinoids,

gnolls, beholders, and evil dragons. In dire circumstances, elf

leaders have been known to recruit the Eldreth Veluuthra to

help stem some growing evil. The organizations members have

skills and talents that, when combined with their willingness to

take on unsavory assignments, make them valuable allies against

the elves most ruthless foes.

In a nutshell, the Eldreth Veluuthra hates nearly everyone who

is not an elf, and so it is constantly surrounded by enemies.

Joining the Eldreth Veluuthra

You cant just join the Eldreth Veluuthra. You have to be invited,

and those who seem too eager are rarely asked to join. You dont

nd the Eldreth Veluuthra, it nds you.

Because of the secret nature of the organization, outsiders

who wish to join the Eldreth Veluuthra will be recruited only

after a period of observation. What attracts the attention of the

Eldreth Veluuthra is an individuals actions and deeds, not talk.

Because the organization has suffered signicantly at the hands

of such organizations as the Harpers, those who seem too eager to

nd a local Eldreth Veluuthra agent are intentionally led astray

and sometimes captured and questioned. Individuals who show

promise are watched, both normally and magically, to ascertain

Three members of the Eldreth Veluuthra communicate silently and secretly in a crowded macketplace

81

Evil Organizations

their sincerity. Sometimes, a candidate might be surreptitiously

questioned by an agent posing as a barkeep or fellow traveler. Only

after the leader of the local cell is satised as to her intentions

will she be approached by a member and invited to join.

The vast majority of members of the Eldreth Veluuthra

are recruited by family members who are already deeply and

sometimes secretly involved in the organization. Often, as much

as ninety percent of any cell will be made up of siblings, parents,

children, aunts, uncles and cousins of the cell leader. In this way,

the organization assures the secrecy and loyalty of its members.

Outsiders recruited into a cell sometimes have a hard time gaining

the trust of family members, and are often given assignments

independent of the cells regular activities until they have proven

their loyalty.

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

Entry into the Eldreth Veluuthra requires a vow of secrecy

that not only binds you to never reveal what you know, but

also requires you to punish those who break their vow. The

vow is binding for life, even for those no longer active within

the organization.

Because of the loose structure of the organization, individual

cells have their own rules about the duties required of their

members. Few cells adopt a purely militaristic organization with

strict rules of obedience or members living and working together

on a constant basis; that would attract far too much attention.

Most members lead independent lives, having professional and

familial duties outside the organization. A few adventuring

company-style cells have formed, but these usually short-lived,

due to the high attrition rates common to these activities. In

general, individuals belonging to a particular cell are expected

to participate in important operations, unless they are already

employed in another operation or working directly with the

VelNikeryma; low-level members might be asked to take on

specic duties or smaller operations.

Once members have earned the trust of their superiors, they

might request agent status from the VelNikeryma, which allows

them to operate in nearly any area in which the organization

might have a stake. Since humans and drow are their main en-

emies, this area includes almost all of Faern, both aboveground

and below. Agents of the VelNikeryma are expected to always act

in accordance with the long-range goals of the organization and to

regularly pass along information to their superiors. Adventuring

agents are also expected to contribute a reasonable portion of

their treasure and winnings to the nearest cell. Although they

are not required to, they are also expected to occasionally take

on missions from the VelNikeryma.

In exchange, adventuring agents learn universal pass codes and

secret symbols and handshakes that allow them to be recognized

by the leaders of any recognized cell anywhere in Faern. Since

these secret pass codes change frequently, agents are expected to

check in with the local cell when entering its area. As agents,

they have access to weapons, armor, equipment repair, fresh

mounts, rest, food and water, safe haven, and healing (magical

or otherwise, if available). The cell leader might require a task

of an agent if the item is particularly valuable or rare, or if the

agent spends more than a tenday enjoying the cells hospitality.

Acting within the

Eldreth Veluuthra

An adventuring band or cell within the Eldreth Veluuthra could

be composed of pureblood elves and their sylvan allies, such as

centaurs, satyrs, and fey. Half-elves, no matter how sympathetic

they are to the cause, are never accepted into the group. If the

adventuring party is within an area under the control of another

cell, it is expected to clear its mission with the leaders of the local

cell before beginning, since attacking a powerful local human

merchant (for example) might cause more harm than good to

those members of the organization who have to live in the area

after the adventurers have had their fun. Those who neglect to

keep their superiors informed of their activities risk receiving a

transfer to the Urlingwood.

Acting Outside the

Eldreth Veluuthra

Individual members of the Eldreth Veluuthra are free (and

sometimes encouraged) to act on their own, sometimes joining

unafliated adventuring companies or even other organizations,

but only after they have proven their trustworthiness by serv-

ing within the organization for a period of time. As freelance

agents, they are expected to keep secret their association with

the Eldreth Veluuthra, and to pass along any information that

might be of interest to the organization. When in the company

of others, they may not associate with members of the Eldreth

Veluuthra or take outsiders to any of the organizations hideouts,

safe houses, or weapons caches. They are also expected to make

a reasonable attempt to notify the leader of a local cell before

acting in her area. Understandably, this is not always possible, so

freelance agents of the Eldreth Veluuthra are expected to wear

in a visible manner the groups secret markers (which might be

a piece of jewelry, a special style of cloak or boots, or the like)

so that they can easily be identied by other members of the

organization.

Classes

The members of several character classes are highly prized and

vigorously recruited by the Eldreth Veluuthra. Others have no

place within the organization.

Barbarians: Barbarians are welcome recruits in wilderness

regions, unwelcome in civilized areas. The organization does not

82

Evil Organizations

actively recruit barbarians except in those regions dominated

by wild elves (such as the High Forest, the Chondalwood, and

the Methwood). Because of their chaotic nature, barbarians are

usually required to undergo a longer period of service to prove

their trustworthiness.

Bards: Bards are prized as freelance agents. After a brief

proving period, they are swiftly placed into unafliated positions

as agents, spies and recruiters.

Clerics: There are no clerics in the Eldreth Veluuthra, since

the good-aligned elven pantheon does not allow for clerics of evil

alignment.

Druids: As a class devoted to protecting the elven woodlands

from human encroachment, druids are accorded special honor

within the Eldreth Veluuthra, both for their close association

with nature and for their healing magic.

Fighters: Fighters are valuable members of the organization

but are not especially targeted for recruitment except when some

large-scale action is imminent, or if a ghter is a specialist in

some unique or exotic weapon.

Monks: Because a monks rst loyalty is to her monastic

order, monks are rarely recruited. Some believe that they cannot

be trusted. Exceptions to the rule exist, such as outcast monks,

but like barbarians, they are required to undergo a longer period

of service to prove their trustworthiness.

Paladins: Because of the unavailability of good-aligned divine

magic, there are no paladins in the Eldreth Veluuthra.

Rangers: The warriors of the woodlands are the most com-

monly recruited character class. Rangers are the backbone of the

Eldreth Veluuthra.

Rogues: Rogues and thieves are recruited as spies and profes-

sional treasure nders. Some thieves within the organization

specialize in robbing other elves. The Eldreth Veluuthra believes

that all elves should donate to the cause, whether or not they

agree with it.

Sorcerers and Wizards: These two character classes are

heavily recruited in all regions. Magic is essential to the groups

success.

In addition to the standard classes, the Eldreth Veluuthra also

recruits and/or trains in the following prestige classes:

Arcane Archer: This prestige class provides vital arcane

specialists within any military strike force.

Assassin: Assassins ll an essential role in the organization.

The Eldreth Veluuthra always trains its own assassins and never

hires an assassin from other organization.

Evereskan Tomb Guardian: Members of the Eldreth Ve-

luuthra are particularly suited to this prestige class dedicated to

the protection of elven tombs.

Hierophant: These archdruids offer an additional level of

magical power and wilderness knowledge to the organizations

activities.

Justice of Weald and Woe: This prestige class originated within

the Eldreth Veluuthra and remains one of its most carefully

guarded secrets. Justices of weald and woe are called upon for

the organizations most dangerous and vital operations.

Adventures

Current or prospective members of the Eldreth Veluuthra can

nd adventure in many places, and not all of them need involve

attacking human homesteads. They might be asked by a member

of the VelNikeryma to perform some task, such as:

Search for portals in the Cloak Wood south of Baldurs Gate

(low-level).

Hunt down a band of adventurers who have been raiding

ancient moon elf tombs in the Graycloak Hills (mid-level).

Drive the human druid Pheszeltan from the Forgotten Forest

in the Western Heartlands (high-level).

Lossarwyn the Ice Lich

In addition to being a druid lich, Lossarwyn has a strong af-

nity for cold and ice. He became an undead creature and was

trapped inside a glacier for several centuries before being freed.

Now, his aura and his touch are as cold as the glacier that once

held him.

Combat

Lossarwyns natural weapons are treated

as magic weapons for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Fear  Aura  (Su):  Lossarwyn  is

sorcerer. A creature that success-

fully saves cannot be affected

again by Lossarwyns aura for

24 hours.

Paralysis (Su): Any living crea-

ture struck by Lossarwyns touch

attack must succeed on a DC 21

the surrounding en-

vironment. Remove paralysis or

any spell that can remove a curse

can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, page

203 of the Players Handbook). The effect cannot be dispelled.

Anyone paralyzed by Lossarwyn seems dead and cold, though

a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the

victim is still alive.

Spell-Like Ability: As a hierophant, Lossarwyn has chosen

to give up one 3rd-level spell slot in exchange for being able to

use, as a spell-like ability, contagion twice per day.

Immunities (Ex): Lossarwyn is immune to cold, electricity,

poison, polymorph (though he can use polymorph effects on

himself), and mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Wild Shape (Ex): Lossarwyn can change himself into any

animal of Tiny to Huge size six times per day. He can also change

himself into a Small, Medium or Large elemental twice per day.

Because he is undead, normal animals avoid him even while he

is in an animal shape.

Lossarwyn the ice lich

Background

In ancient times, Lossarwyn was one of the most powerful elf

druids of Cormanthor. As humans began to encroach upon the

forests, he was one of the strongest voices for war against them.

But when the elves of Cormanthor signed the Dalelands Pact, he

despaired for the future of the wild places. He saw humanity as a

disease to be eradicated, and gradually came to realize that humans

have remarkable resilience against nearly every hardshipexcept

disease. Thus began his long

downfall as he sought a plague

that would destroy humankind

once and for all.

He began to travel from

land to land, going wherever

there was rumor of plague,

using his vast knowledge of

alchemy and healing to

cure the sick. For those

he saved, he seemed a

gift  from  heaven  and

won wide renown for his

medical expertise. What

he couldnt heal through

natural means was cured

through the divine inter-

vention  of  the  cadre  of

priests who followed him

like disciples. They came

from many faiths and many

lands to join this strange elf

druid who seemed to have

forsaken his forests to help

mankind. For all his fame,

Lossarwyn seemed to resent each

success, yet his dark moods and relentless spirit

only attracted more followers. Some whispered

that all was not as it seemed with the great

physician, that at times he disappeared for days or weeks. Others

said his renown was ill-deserved, since his most difcult patients

tended to disappear.

His mission to eradicate humanity continued, despite all

the human lives he had saved. Lossarwyn was searching for a

plague that had no cure. Whenever he came across a disease that

seemed especially virulent, he would whisk away its victim for a

detailed study, research that often ended the life of the one he

had ostensibly come to heal. Many diseases seemed promising,

but most had the drawback of difculty of transmission. It

seemed that magical assistance was needed, which led Lossarwyn

to study necromancy, thus renouncing the deepest strictures of

his faith.

After many years, just when he seemed on the verge of

discovery, his goal of loosing a plague upon mankind was nally

uncovered by a jealous rival, and he was revealed to his fellow

druids. They declared his crimes unforgivable, and they prescribed

a secret death by assassination for Lossarwyn rather than allow

the general public to learn of his plots. But Lossarwyn ed

rather than face punishment and was pursued by three of the

most powerful druids of that time. They chased him north into

the frozen lands and at last cornered him in glacial cavern. A

magical battle ensued, and Lossarwyn died and was frozen into

the heart of the glacier, lost forever (or so it seemed). But as

he breathed his last, Lossarwyn made a pact with darker forces

that resulted in his being cursed with undeath. In their malice,

those dark powers did nothing to free him, and so Lossarwyn

remained frozen in the ice for many centuries.

At last there came a summer warmer than any in memory.

The glacier receded, freeing Lossarwyn. Fearing the long memory

of the elves of Cormanthor (and unaware of the destruction of

Myth Drannor), he traveled west until he came to Amn, and

there he fell in league with a cabal of dark spellcasters called

the Twisted Rune. His unusual status and powers allowed him to

rise swiftly in the cabal, and all the while he continued his dark

research, more determined than ever to destroy humanity. When

at last he approached a priest of Myrkul with his plan, thinking

he would nd a sympathetic ear, he was again betrayedthis time

by the Twisted Rune. Again Lossarwyn ed, seeking refuge in the

High Forest, but his enemies soon caught up with him at the Dire

Wood. His druid powers made him a formidable opponent even

against the combined might of the Twisted Rune, so rather than

ght him, the spellcasters trapped him with a powerful maze

spell. He is able to roam the Dire Wood at will, but cannot nd

his way out.

Recently, agents of the Eldreth Veluuthra heard rumors of

Lossarwyn, one of their most ancient and revered heroes, and

they sought him out in the Dire Wood. Although they have not

yet managed to establish a formal alliance with the druid lich,

he did agree to train several members in exchange for their aid

in freeing him from the Dire Wood. He has taught them his

method of drawing upon the divine power of nature, freeing them

of the need to call upon a deity for their spells. The addition of

Lossarwyn to the Eldreth Veluuthra would signicantly increase

the organizations power and prestige, and although he has not

yet been freed from his leafy prison, he remains an extremely

important gure in the organizations future plans.

Monks of the

Dark Moon

The Monks of the Dark Moon are a sect of sorcerer-monks

who have dedicated themselves body, mind, and soul to Shar, the

Lady of Loss. The monks are her assassins, her enforcers, and

her shadowy agents. Their training is diverse, as are their skills,

and their devotion to their Lady is absolute. The organizations

leaders have direct contact with their goddess, and are not subject

to the authority or will of her clergy. The monks are a completely

independent organization, giving Shar an incredible range of

talents to call on in times of need.

This sect of Sharrans is relatively new to Faern. Shar

chose her most trusted mortal servant, Alorgoth, The Bringer

of Doom, to recruit and train the rst wave of monks, who

set out from their secret lair around three years ago. Train-

ing has since come under the purview of a group of Sharrans

representing almost every facet of her worshipthree priests

tend to the monks spiritual development, four monks and an

assassin oversee their martial training, and a powerful sorcerer

whose mastery over the Shadow Weave is unrivaled instructs

recruits in the most dangerous of Shars gifts. This group has

just nished training its second class of monks, and is now

fanning out across the continent to recruit more dark hearts

into service.

Most Faernians are blissfully ignorant of the existence of this

group, but Shars enemies know only too well of its increasing reach

and power. Since the rst wave of students reached the culmination

of their training, Shar has wielded them with brutal efciencyand

with little regard for their lives. Monks of the Dark Moon have

sacked a temple of Chauntea in Purskul, assassinated the leading

priest of Loviatar in Cormyr, and turned a holy site of Selne into

an unholy node of evil arcane energy. The fact that the Monks of

the Dark Moon keep their existence, whereabouts, and identities

secret is the only thing that has kept them from becoming one of

the most feared organizations in Faern.

Areas of Influence

The Monks of the Dark Moon began their existence in an

imposing stone monolith in the city of Purskul, the rst shrine

dedicated solely to Shars new strike force. The shrines existence

is known to all, but what goes on within its walls is one of the

orders most guarded secrets. Those who enter the shrine to train

either become faithful servants of the Lady of Loss or end up

serving as living training dummies for those within. Even most

clerics of Shar refuse to enter the shrine, for its deadly reputation

is most well known among their ranks.

The monks have since spread across Faern, establishing other

shrines and safe havens wherever they go. A shrine beneath the

northwestern foothills of the Sword Mountains serves as a meet-

ing place and training ground for order members who operate in

the northern Sword Coast. A desecrated shrine to Selne on the

southern edge of Cormanthor now operates as an evil node and

hideout for Dark Moon monks in Cormanthor and the Moonsea.

Sembian and Cormyrian recruits are taken to a mountain base at

the summit of one of the Thunder Peaks; the mountain refuge

is guarded by a clan of manticores that have been swayed to the

dark goddesss cause. Yet these are not the most remote training

grounds that the monks have founded: Deep in the Calim Desert,

where the worst magical storms blow, is a buried series of tunnels

scoured out of a hill by the blasting sands of this tormented land.

The most stoic and doughty of the Monks of the Dark Moon

the North or the Silver Marches, because Selnes inuence radi-

ates too strongly from Silverymoon for them to be effective.

Regions

The following regions are prime recruiting spots for the Monks

of the Dark Moon; even though many of them overlap with a

number of the Sharran religious cells, the operations of the two

groups are almost wholly independent.

Amn: The Monks of the Dark Moon began in Purskul, and

that city is still home to the groups most holy monastery. Amn

and the surrounding regions continue to be hotbeds of recruitment

for both the Monks of the Dark Moon as well as their Sharran

comrades.

Calimshan: Although the elite of the great city of Calimport

are too lazy and pampered to undergo the rites of the Monks of

the Dark Moon, the citys lower classes are inured against the hot

sun and other brutal conditions of their native land. They have

learned enough of the ways of the rich to be jealous and vengeful,

however, which plays right into the hands of Shars teachings.

Cormanthor and the Moonsea: The Monks of the Dark Moon

are relative newcomers to this region, but the reemergence of the

dark elves and the chaos created by the absence of Lolth have

given Shar hope that she might recruit some of the drow into

her service.

Sembia: The Sembian monks work more closely with the clergy

of the region than any other, and the Sharran inltration of the

Sembian noble houses is a great aid in recruiting new monks.

Sword Coast: The monks here enforce Shars will along the

coast from Waterdeep to Luskan. They do not travel too far into

Joining the

Monks of the Dark Moon

The Monks of the Dark Moon take on a new slate of recruits at

each monastery every fourteen months. The hopefuls are drawn

from those who are already indoctrinated into Shars mysteries, and

even then, only those who show incredible devotion to her ideals

are admitted. The rigorous training and vile acts that all recruits

must perform weed out most of the orders enemies; the faithful

of Shar guard their secrets better than anyone else in Faern.

The rst principle is that any new recruit must be a young

adult. Children are not drafted, because their capacity to under-

stand the evil to which they are dedicating their lives has not yet

fully developed. Those with sorcerous talents might be watched

and guided from an early age, but full recruitment does not take

place until they have reached maturity. Recruits must be among

the strongest in their faith, but under no circumstances can they

have taken the oath of priesthood. Shar commands that her

priests and monks be separate, so both can carry out her will

without complication. Finally, recruits must have demonstrated

the potential to develop sorcerous abilities. This last was the most

stringent requirement that Shar handed down to Alorgoth, and

many recruits have fallen under the sacricial knife for lying

about such potential.

The Monks of the Dark Moon do not accept any member who

does not undergo their training. The year-long training does not

Evil Organizations

always produce powerful members, though, and some graduates

have not yet mastered their martial or arcane abilities enough to

harness them on any level. A character who was already a monk

or a sorcerer could be invited to join as long as he fullled the

three principles, and his training would focus on the aspect of

the training that he lacked. Likewise, green candidates will often

show aptitude for one class or the other, but not both, and so

leave the monastery with only rudimentary skills as a monk or

sorcerer. The training can certainly have been undertaken before

a character picks up his rst class level.

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

In order to join the Monks of the Dark Moon, an applicant

must completely devote himself to Shar in every facet of life. It

takes fourteen months of ones life simply to undergo the trials

and training provided by the order, and after that, a lifetime

of dedicated service looms. The members of the order are not

trained for treasure hunting, but any treasure they do happen

upon is considered a part of the organization rather than the

individuals property. That said, the orders leaders are not unfair

in the distribution of such bounties, and they recognize that the

nder is often most beneted by it.

Members gain the protection of Shar and her worshipers

wherever they go. A Monk of the Dark Moon who identies

himself to a Sharran cell will be treated very graciously, since no

follower of the Lady of Loss wants to risk hampering someone

who might be on a personal mission from the goddess.

The order also teaches all members the lesser shadow tenta-

cleLD and greater shadow tentacleLD spells when they reach the

appropriate caster level. These spells are gifts from Shar, and do

not take up the characters normal spell slots. The Monks of

the Dark Moon are taught to ght alongside their brothers and

sisters, and so any time two of them ght side by side, each gains

a +1 circumstance bonus on both Armor Class and attack rolls.

These bonuses disappear if an individual moves to a square that

is not adjacent to a Dark Brother or Dark Sister, as the monks

call their peers.

Acting within the

Monks of the Dark Moon

Sometimes a job is too big for one agent to complete, such as the

sacking of the temple to Chauntea in Purskul and the assassina-

tion of all its priests. Shar does not hesitate to assign the right

number of individuals to a job, even if it means combining the

forces of her clerics with those of her monks. She has shown

this wisdom in the recent pairing of the accomplished Monk of

the Dark Moon, Alon (see page 121), with the priest Damian

Krale (see page 115) in the Western Heartlands A trained

Sharran monk can make an excellent support character for a

group composed of priests, warriors, and rogues dedicated to

the Lady of Loss.

Acting Outside the

Monks of the Dark Moon

A Monk of the Dark Moon would have a hard time acting in

a group that was not made up of others of his order or at least

those of the Sharran faith. He might disguise himself and hide

his true motives in order to travel less conspicuously, or he might

even join the group of someone he was tracking in order to gain

an edge when the time came to strike. A Monk of the Dark Moon

might need something a group of PCs hasperhaps a key to the

dungeon in which he can nd a holy relic, or some other target

that he has been instructed to destroy.

Sharran Cells

Shars worship is one of the fastest growing evils in Faern, and

her clergy and worshipers threaten the stability of many of the

regions in which they have taken hold. The church of Shar is

composed of cells that act independently of one another, often

without knowledge of the other cells. In fact, the secretive nature

of these cells often means that the identities of a cells members

are known only to that cells leader. The primary goal of every

cell is to bring as many Faernians under Shars inuence as pos-

sible, so that eventually their dark mistress can win her eternal

war against her sister, Selne. To this end, the worshipers of

Shar spread themselves throughout the populated areas of the

continent, searching for weak minds into which they can sow

thoughts of meaninglessness and revenge.

Shars inuence is felt in every region of Faern, from urban

cells that play upon the fears and jealousies of the wealthy,

to rural groups, to the wandering Monks of the Dark Moon,

who bring pain to all who oppose her. Everyday citizens know

little about the cells in their area, often not even realizing

that the Lady of Loss is represented nearby. The church only

contacts those it wishes to corrupt or those it thinks can be

useful in some way. The Sharrans prefer to go about their

dark business in secret, with as little interference as possible.

If locals did know what the cells were up toritual sacrices,

the propagation of murder and revenge, and the establishment

of cults that undermine local religionsit would not be long

before they sought the aid of adventurers to protect them from

the church.

Areas of Influence

Because of the secretive nature of the church of Shar, its wor-

shipers have no centralized base of operations. The Temple of

Old Night, the largest temple to Shar in Faern, can be found

in Calimport. This temple in the desert is the closest thing to a

rallying point Shars clergy has, and hundreds make a pilgrimage

87

Evil Organizations

to the site each year to gain their Ladys guidance. The

temple also makes for a convenient place to gather useful

contacts, to spread information that can be disseminated

to the clergy at large, and to cool ones heels during times

of trouble within a particular cell or after defeat at the

hands of opponents.

The Western Heartlands have seen quite a bit of

Sharran activity of late, leading many to suspect that

the Mistress of the Night has big plans for the region.

Rumors are spreading of a grand new temple being

built in a secret location, although all efforts to nd

such a place have ended in failure. Aside from a few

tidbits reported here and there by adventurers and spies

representing the clergy of Selne, information about

the Sharrans intentions has been sparse. In truth, a

strong priest has become a unifying force for the clergy

in the region, backed by a clan of monks who are not

afliated with the Dark Moon sect. All the cells in

the region have fallen under his sway, although they

are still not unied as a whole. Selne has commanded

followers from Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep to go to

the Western Heartlands and determine the nature of

Shars new threat.

Sembia has always been a haven for Shars clergy,

who nd the intrigues and greed of the city fertile

ground for the goddesss temptations. The recent chaos

in Cormyr has attracted the attention of some of these

clergy, who have sent underlings into the region to

establish footholds among the bickering noble families.

This act has only served to intensify the strife within

the region, and at least one noble family has fallen so

completely under Shars inuence that its manor houses

now feature dark dungeons in which blood sacrices

take place several times a month.

Regions

Sharran cells are active throughout Faern, but the

following regions have seen increased activity of late or

are bastions of the Dark Goddesss power.

Calimshan: The site of the largest temple to Shar

in the Realms, Calimport has long been a favored

destination for pilgrims devoted to the Lady of Loss.

Even more than in Sembia, the intrigues and delicate

social customs of Calimshan lend themselves well to the

corrupting inuence of Shar. Her priests sow mistrust

between those of the same social status, and manufacture

slights that are sure to infuriate the most respected

merchants and those of noble title.

Cormyr and Sembia: Shars network of clergy spreads

throughout these two regions, playing off the greed

and jealousies of their noble families. It is well known

that the Sharrans have their claws in the intrigues of

the merchants of Sembia, but so far their activities in

Cormyr remain out of sight.

The leader of a Sharran cell lures a gullible noble into her clutches

88

Evil Organizations

The Great Rift: Shars insidious message has taken root in an

unlikely placethe tunnels beneath the Great Rift. The Mistress

of the Night counts caverns and the Underdark among her port-

folio ever since she killed Ibrandul during the Time of Troubles,

and though she is not known as a patron of the dwarves, she has

captured the minds and spirits of one dissatised group of gold

dwarves in the region. Their leader, Darger Ironmoot, is an ousted

prince who has vowed revenge on his family. In the absence of a

strong military following, he has turned to Shars teachings to

nd a way to wreak havoc on those who cast him aside.

Shade: Shar has once again taken an interest in the slave race

known as the krinth, and has dispatched one of her most trusted

priests to inltrate the City of Shade. So far he has had little

success nding those willing to listen to Shars promises, but he

is clandestinely aiding the citys growing krinth underground

movement.

The Western Heartlands: Rumors of strange happenings

connected to the priesthood of Shar have been coming out of

Daggerdale and Iriaebor for the past few months. All investiga-

tions into these rumors have come up empty-handed, yet the

stories of a secret temple and a Sharran plot still spread. A strong

leader has emerged to inuence the actions of all the cells in the

region toward a common goal, but just what that goal is remains

to be seen.

Joining a Sharran Cell

The clergy of Shar is always looking for new recruits, not just to

ll the ranks of the priesthood but also to act as followers, con-

tacts, and spies. Recruiting is an ongoing process wherever a cell

operates. Because of the nature of Shars worship, open recruiting

is impossible in most places in Faern. Most of the work is done

face to face, individual by individual. Sometimes the conversion

of a new member is a long, slow process; other times it occurs

quickly, through the promise of forbidden knowledge and power

over others that the recruit nds too enticing to ignore. This type

of rapid recruiting has the additional advantage of maintaining

secrecy about the cell. Since an individual likely never has access

to more than one member of a cell before he is inducted into the

group, no recruiting effort puts the entire group at risk.

Becoming a member of the church is no easy matterShar

demands much of her followers, and each is expected to perform

vile acts from her day of induction until she meets her end. The

secrecy of Shars church in most areas means that those interested

in her teachings usually nd it difcult to locate a member

of the clergy. Most often, a prospective member is contacted

after the church already knows that the individual is open to

a dialogue. Those who have recently been slighted, for whom a

secret revealed would be devastating, or whose dark hearts would

be better bent to Shars will, all nd themselves targets of her

servants advances.

Shars teachings appeal to people of all races, professions, and

social standing. Jealousy and secrets prevail throughout societies

everywhere, so Shar has a large base of potential followers to

draw from. She prefers those who are strong enough to take care

of themselves, but with a physical or psychological weakness that

draws them to seek comfort from others. Users of the Shadow

Weave are considered particularly attractive recruits, as are

warriors who have proven unfazed after committing heinous

atrocities. Untrained followers are recruited when the possibility

exists that they could grow useful to a cell, either by developing

martial or magical abilities, becoming devout priests, or by

providing a useful contact in a city or surrounding region.

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

Shar is desperate to gain followers of late, so much so that she is

willing to accept anyone who can prove his or her commitment

to her evil principles. Those who wish to merely worship Shar

must simply declare their afliation, as with any other god. For

those who want to work with a local cell, or perhaps even become

a priest, the price is much higher. Once an individual has been

contacted, seduced, and made ready to join, he must commit an

act of great evil in Shars name. This act almost always involves

violence against the petitioners close friends or family. Such acts

are much easier to persuade a new member to perform when

the individual has been recruited based on the revelation of an

unfaithful lover or backstabbing family member.

The most immediate benet to joining a Sharran cell is

protection against the cells depredations. Although becoming a

mere worshiper does not assure an individual of full protection,

such an individual is unlikely to be the target of an abduction

or murder in Shars name. Becoming a Sharran devotee opens

a number of avenues for personal growth to those with the

ambition to pursue them. First, the secrets of the Shadow

Weave are only safely learned by one loyal to Shar. Renegade

Shadow Weave users are watched or hunted by Shars priests for

daring to dele her unholy gift to the world. Second, a person

who works his way up in the ranks of the Sharran clergy or

becomes particularly useful to the cell or the goddess herself

gains access to secrets unknown to most. Since the cells work

independently, such a person has great freedom to pursue his

own agenda and to call upon the resources and members of the

cell toward that end.

Acting Within a Sharran Cell

An adventuring party dedicated to Shar is almost always led by a

charismatic priest who interprets the Ladys will and directs the

group accordingly. Missions that such a group might undertake

are varied, from the assassination of an important Selnite

priest and his entourage, to the recovery of an artifact that

channels the power of the Shadow Weave. Such a group might

work with a cell, be independent (this is often the case if one or

more members are of the Dark Moon sect of monks), or be a

cell unto themselves.

89

Evil Organizations

Acting Outside a Sharran Cell

If a single member of an adventuring party is a Sharran devotee,

his companions might not know iteven if they have adventured

with him for years or known him their entire lives. Since Shars

faithful thrive on secrets, it would not do for a Sharran working

with others to reveal his true identity and motives. The character

must be charismatic without being a leader, subtly shifting the

partys goals and movements to benet his cell. He might suggest

an out-of-the-way destination when its time for the party to

replenish their gear, so that he can make contact with another

cell member or quietly exterminate a local devotee of Selne.

If the party is close to discovering a Sharran cell or a Shadow

Weave node (see page 98), the character might contrive some way

to steer them in another direction. Whatever his motivations,

a Sharran in a party of nonbelievers lives a life of lies, trickery,

and deception.

The Unworthy of

Ilsensine

This relatively new cult worships the illithid goddess Ilsensine

and is directed in that worship by an outcast mind ayer cleric

named Qooql (see page 116 for statistics and other details). The

cult resides in a series of winding caverns beneath the Giant Run

Mountains, south of Traders Road along the Dragon Coast.

The cult is made up of Qooql, his stone giant cohort, a tribe of

grimlocks that have come to revere him, and a clan of shield

dwarves who have been charmed for so long they now believe

that Qooql is their only hope in the world.

The shield dwarves act as emissaries to the outside world,

often traveling to nearby cities to pick up information, gather

supplies, and spread rumors that benet Qooql and the cult. The

grimlocks, on the other hand, are Qooqls muscle. They protect

the cults caverns from incursions from the Underdark, as well as

the occasional adventuring band or curious interloper from above.

Although Qooql has just in the past few months consolidated

his power and nalized control over these two groups, the mind

ayer already has big plans for the surrounding region.

Qooql rst made his way toward the surface from the mind

ayer city of Oryndoll, where he had made a pilgrimage to seek

out the wisdom handed down by the avatars of Ilsensine, who

had twice made an appearance in that city. For reasons known

only to it, the citys elder brain rejected Qooql, and he was not

allowed to enter the city. Believing this to be a test, the mind

ayer lurked at the edges of Oryndoll for weeks. Finally he made

another attempt to enter, only to be repelled by a force of thralls.

Unable enter the city and suspecting an alliance of false priests

was arrayed against him, he turned away from the city and headed

toward the surface, where he encountered a band of stone giants

from the village of Cairnheim.

He successfully charmed the leader of the band and asked for

an audience with his chieftain, whom Qooql also thought he could

manipulate. The chieftain, however, turned out to be a crafty

stone giant lich called The Dodkong, which spelled trouble for

the illithid priest. Realizing the mind ayer had charmed one of

his greatest hunters, the Dodkong ordered Qooql to be destroyed.

The illithid managed to convince his charmed ally that the

Dodkong was insane and meant to kill them both, and the two

ed the caves of the stone giants as quickly as they could. Qooql

wandered for a few more weeks before running into an ambush

prepared by a tribe of grimlocks. Qooql used his mind blast on

the ambushers, but rather than killing them he granted them

amnesty and followed them back to their lair after charming

all but one of the party, which he consumed after the rest had set

out. The grimlocks in the lair were surprised that the mind ayer

had not destroyed their comrades, and were doubly impressed that

he seemed to be speaking with them as though he regarded them

as something other than slaves. It did not take long for Qooql to

turn this favorable attitude to his advantage, and the grimlock

tribe soon became his servants.

The next group to come under his sway was the Ironhand

clan of shield dwarves, who lived in a settlement built partly

upon and partly underneath the mountains. The dwarves proved

quite resistant to Qooqls charm power at rst, and their reaction

almost led to a war between them and Qooqls grimlock servants.

The mind ayer eventually wore them down and had the entire

clan charmed. He convinced the dwarves that he was not evil,

and that he had come to the surface in order to seek redemption

from a world that had turned its back on him.

Now, Qooql has the dwarves working under the assumption

that they are building an army strong enough to drive the Dod-

kong from the mountains and rid the region of giants forever. The

dwarves, naturally inclined to be sympathetic toward that goal,

have allowed themselves to be turned into Qooqls servants. They

now act as his eyes and ears in the world above, often traveling

to cities as far away as Iriaebor and Westgate for information

and supplies.

Areas of Influence

The Unworthy of Ilsensine works out of an ever-expanding

network of caverns and tunnels in the northern part of the

Giant Run Mountains. Qooql has not attempted to expand his

network beyond this secret, easily defended position, for fear of

bringing unwanted attention to his work. The shield dwarf clan

has suffered some attrition in its numbers, but the grimlock tribe

has nearly doubled in size under the supervision and control of

the mind ayer. Even though the Dodkong sometimes sends

forces underground to root out his enemies, Qooql is content to

live there until he can make a serious play for control of one of

the cities on the surface.

To this end, Qooql has his eyes set on Westgate, and is rmly

entrenched in the politics of the cityat least the part of it that

lies outside the purview of the Night Masks. He sends dwarf

emissaries (rogues would be a better term) to the city to make

overtures and bribes, to search for weaknesses in the citys power

structure, and to gain contacts and allies that could benet him

when the time comes to make his move. He has also

recently become interested in Iriaebor, although he

has no real plans for the city at the moment.

Regions

Qooql is fairly contained in his cavern home beneath

the Giant Run Mountains, but he sends more and

more agents out with each passing month, and his

list of contacts and allies is growing.

Amn: The Giant Run Mountains jut out of the

ground in this region, and the dwarves and grimlocks

found underneath these mountains might have

some experience with the customs and culture of

the Unworthy of Ilsensine.

Dragon Coast: This region holds the most inter-

est for Qooql, since its reputation and society might

allow for a mind ayer to openly rule a city within

the area. He has a fairly well-established network

of contacts there, and his knowledge of the regions

inner workings has grown extensively in the past

few months.

The Western Heartlands: While Qooql has little

inuence in this region, he is almost ready to send

out feelers to the city of Iriaebor. He doesnt want

to use his shield dwarves for this task, because he

fears too much exposure could bring nosy heroes

around, but he would not be above dominating (or

hiring, if it came to it) a group of freelancers to

give him the rundown on the citys politics, culture,

and power elite.

Joining the Unworthy

of Ilsensine

Qooqls recruiting efforts take place outside the

main membership of his cult, as he attempts to

establish contacts and independent agents within

the city of Westgate. He continues to assimilate

smaller groups of grimlocks into the main body of

his organization, and is planning for the long term

by controlling their breeding. He also encourages a

higher than normal reproduction rate among the

shield dwarves, often using his psionic abilities to

encourage pairings and speed along the courtship

process. Qooql uses gold to augment his psionics,

especially when it comes to outside recruitment.

His inuence spans the Dragon Coast, including

members of several prominent families and guilds.

A band of pirates in the Dragonmere is completely

controlled by the mind ayer, although no one but

the leader is aware of the factand even the leader

believes their benefactor to be a powerful noble

rather than an abomination from the Underdark.

Skilled adventurers are of interest to the mind

Shield dwarves and grimlocks, proud to be among the Unworthy of Ilsensine

91

Evil Organizations

ayer as well, since they can travel the surface world and bring

back information and treasure, items crucial to the success of

Qooqls strategies.

Grimlock and shield dwarf characters could start play as

members of Qooqls cult, or some contact with the cult could

be worked into the characters background. Joining the cult

after ones career has already begun usually involves a nancial

transaction, perhaps a bribe or a payment for services rendered.

While Qooql is not above using his charm monster ability to

gain friends, this is not the optimal way to introduce player

characters into his service. Adventurers who show no hesita-

tion to commit immoral and unethical acts might come to his

attention if they are in the area, and he always sizes up visitors

to the dwarf enclave as possible recruits (willing or unwilling)

for his organization.

Costs and Benefits of

Membership

Adventurers who join with Qooql can continue their adventuring

careers, but must bring him tributes of gold, magic, and informa-

tion on a semiregular basis. He expects them to provide him with

information on the areas in which he is interested, and particularly

wants to hear about cities in the surrounding regions in which

he has no contacts. Such groups are instructed to make contact

with intelligent evil creatures rather than rush in to kill them,

so that Qooql might possibly recruit them into his service. This

is perhaps the most dangerous task given to those who work for

the mind ayer, and has led to the deaths of many adventuring

groups at the hands of adversaries.

Working with Qooql does have some benets, however. Even

though he enjoys dominating friends and enemies alike, he is not

an unpredictable tyrantso those who do his bidding can enjoy

some measure of security. They are also welcome in the caverns

in which he makes his home, which could serve as a safe place

to launch adventures from, as well as a haven for allies of Qooql

who are on the run from powerful enemies. Although Qooql

disapproves of good-aligned creatures being led toward his caverns

by disciples who are not careful about hiding their trail, this turn

of events would be preferable to having those operatives taken

prisoner and perhaps being forced to give away his plans.

The shield dwarves have a variety of mundane goods that are

available to Qooqls minions at discounted prices (a 5% discount is

standard, and Diplomacy checks to reduce the cost even more are

made with a +2 bonus). Small amounts of food and basic lodging

might be available for free whenever allies of Qooql are staying

in his underground haven. When travel through the Underdark

is necessary, Qooql offers a grimlock guide to help make the trip

easier (and to keep an eye out for traitors who might sell him

out to other mind ayers, or to The Dodkong). Finally, Qooql

himself is a repository of lore, both about the Underdark as well

as about matters of religion and the arcane, and he will gladly

act as a sage and advisor to those under his sway who ask for

such aid.

Acting within the

Unworthy of Ilsensine

Qooql is increasingly interested in what is going on outside the

Dragon Coast, and he might put together a party of adventur-

ous individuals to seek out information for him. Such a party

might be a diverse band brought together for this purpose, or

an established group of adventurers ready to sell their skills to a

powerful patron. The mind ayer might use one group to bring

him lore from the surrounding area, and another to seek out and

verify any rumors uncovered by the rst party. Qooql is always

interested in tales of lost treasure, hidden magic, and ancient

terrors that might be brought into his service.

Acting Outside the

Unworthy of Ilsensine

Qooql often sends a group of shield dwarves out to nd worthy

candidates to bring into his network. He has also employed a

drow named Tentraan Deil for this specic purpose, although

the rogue prefers to track his marks and watch them from

afar, rather than mingle with them in order to better judge

their skills. Most groups would balk at including a mind ayers

minion in their party, so discretion is often required if one

wishes to serve Qooql while traveling with unafliated friends.

The penalty for being revealed as a mind ayers tool is usually

swift and harsh.

Zhentarim

The Zhentarim is a network of merchants, spies, and assassins

backed by a large army and led by a Chosen of Bane named Fzoul

Chembryl. Also known as the Black Network, the group uses

intimidation, treachery, and brute force to establish itself as the

foremost mercantile power in every area where it is a signicant

presence. Although its tactics are questionable, the Zhentarim

has established itself as an integral part of the economy across

much of the Moonsea region. The Zhents inuence does not

stop there, however; they have established strong bases in and

around the desert of Anauroch and the Lake of Steam. They

also have agents across the North and the Unapproachable

East who work tirelessly to turn those regions into bastions of

Zhentarim inuence.

The Zhents are a normal part of life in the Moonsea, as ac-

cepted there as any other mercantile group would be in another

region of Faern. Of course, their methods and tactics are well

known, but they are also fair traders who bring a lot of foreign gold

and goods within reach of those in the region who can afford them.

Along the Sword Coast, the Zhentarim is seen as a faraway enemy

that uses blackmail, extortion, and intimidation to get whatever

it wants. Those who travel under the Zhent banner in Waterdeep

or Baldurs Gate are likely to raise a few eyebrows and close a few

doors, but few citizens in those cities feel overtly threatened by

the Black Network. The Lords Alliance in the North and the

92

Evil Organizations

merchant princes of Amn know better, however, and both groups

do all they can to stop the expansion of Zhentarim power and

interests wherever and whenever they can.

Areas of Influence

Because of recent upheavals in the organization as well as the

appearance of new threats such as the Shadovar, the Zhents

have refocused their efforts on dominating the Moonsea region.

They are gathering their forces at both Zhentil Keep and the

Citadel of the Raven, which is making Hillsfar and Melvaunt

very nervous. While there has been no overtly aggressive sign

from either fortress, everyone in the region is beginning to feel

the weight of Fzouls stare.

The city of Mintar on the northwestern shore of the Lake

of Steam is the most likely place for such an expansion, since

it is ruled by an army of Banites under the control of Fzouls

ally, Teldorn Darkhope. This region, with its many independent

cities and ruthless tyrants, has been dubbed by some to be the

Moonsea of the South, and soon the Black Network might lend

even more credibility to this nickname.

Thesk is another area ripe for Zhentarim expansion, thanks

to the massive orc army that the Zhents left in the region after

the war against the Tuigan Horde. The orcs have become a part

of the Theskan landscape, however, and their loyalty to the Black

Network has waned. Fzoul has sent increasing numbers of emis-

saries of late to attempt to regain control over the orcs, but so

far he has succeeded only in reaching tenuous agreements that

quickly fall apart. Rumors have been circulating that Fzoul has

brought in Manxam the beholder to aid in the orcs recruitment,

and some of Fzouls most trusted assassins and enforcers have

been called away to the east as well.

Regions

The following regions have a signicant Zhentarim presence, or

have attracted the attention of Zhent agents and recruiters as

possible locations for expanding the groups inuence:

Anauroch: Until the City of Shade reappeared over the desert

sands, the Zhents were the most inuential group in the desert.

They still control trade through the middle of the desert along

the Black Road, and the Zhentarim can be found everywhere

along its winding path.

The Lake of Steam: The Banite stronghold of Mintar is

very friendly to the Black Network, which has begun installing

its representatives through the church hierarchy that rules the

city. The Zhents are slowly becoming a part of the Mintaran

landscape, and it is more and more common nowadays to nd

soldiers ying the banner of the Zhentarim alongside that of the

army of Bane that occupies the city.

The Moonsea: This region is the Zhents home base, and their

numbers and inuence here are greater than in any other part

of Faern. The local population values the trade and military

might that the masters of Zhentil Keep bring to the region. The

growth of the Zhentarim armies has the common folk wondering

if they will soon march on Melvaunt or Hillsfar in an attempt

to solidify their control of the region.

The North and the Silver Marches: The Zhents inltration of

these regions, outside of their obvious occupation of Llorkh, has

been more insidious than in other locations. Retired Zhentarim

soldiers have settled in the region, claiming that they have broken

ties with the Black Network and now desire a faraway location

to live out the rest of their lives. The Lords Alliance and the

people of the regions are skeptical of these claims, however.

Thesk: The Black Network is only just now starting to gain

a foothold here, but the Theskans still view the orcs, as well as

their perceived Zhentarim masters, with well-founded mistrust

and fear.

Joining the Zhentarim

The Zhentarim has slowed its recruiting efforts in recent months

to focus on reconsolidating it power in the Moonsea region. The

Zhents are still working behind the scenes to regain the loyalty of

the orc horde in Thesk, and they would like to expand their trade

network into the Lake of Steam region to take better advantage

of the incredible opportunities in Calimshan and Amn.

The group is always on the lookout for valuable new recruits.

In areas where its soldiers and caravans are common sitesthe

Moonsea, Anauroch, and parts of the Norththe Zhentarim

openly recruit new soldiers from the local population. The Zhents

prefer those with some experience, but young recruits are often

used to make the arduous journey across the desert from Llorkh

to Dagger Falls and back.

Joining the Black Network is a simple matterone simply

nds a Zhentarim outpost or force and states his intentions. The

character is then directed to a local lieutenant, who questions the

prospective recruit in order to gauge his loyalty, talents, and tness.

Those suited to serve as common soldiers are either placed into

whatever unit they happen to approach, or are sent to units in need

of reinforcement. Those who show evidence of more specialized

talents are considered more carefully. Mages and clerics, both

among the most valuable and dangerous recruits the Black Network

takes in, are often sent to Zhentil Keep so the priests of Bane can

further investigate their loyalty. Rogues, druids, and rangers are

most often allowed to act independently in the interest of the

organization, since their talents and proclivities do not mesh well

with the structured nature of the Zhentarim military forces.

If a character wishes to join the organization but is already

occupied on a quest of his own, he might still be considered.

The Zhentarim use such adventurer-recruits to keep abreast of

information not readily available to the organization through

its trading network and local contacts. The truth behind legends,

news of activity in ruins and other abandoned sites, and the loca-

tions of magic artifacts and deposits of natural resources are all

valuable pieces of information that the Black Network can use.

Those who report such ndings back to the leadership can expect

to be rewarded, while those who withhold such information can

expect to be severely punished if they are found out.

93

Evil Organizations

Costs and Benefits

of Membership

The Zhentarim require active service from all their members,

and complete respect of the authority of those above a character

in the chain of command. That said, even low-level characters

who wish to join the Zhentarim will not necessarily be pressed

into caravan duty or other such mundane tasks. As long as they

continue to provide the Black Network with information about

the region in which they are active, new members are free to

explore and adventure in pursuit of their own goals (assuming

they are not at cross-purposes with the organization). There is

no real prerequisite for joining, other than a willingness to follow

orderswhich usually entails committing evil acts.

Membership in the organization has many benets. A Zhent

is automatically under the protection of the entire network, and

should be able to call for aid if he is under attack or the interests

of the group are in jeopardy. Treachery among the ranks is rare,

because loyalty is a key component of the Zhentarim philosophy.

A Zhentarim PC can hire allied henchmen and hirelings at a

10% discount from the standard rates (including hazard pay),

and the character gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks made to

inuence a hirelings attitude. A character with the Leadership

feat gains a +2 bonus on his Leadership score for the purpose of

recruiting cohorts and followers if he draws solely from a pool

made up of Zhentarim forces or loyalists.

Zhentarim PCs can also requisition equipment at discounted

rates if they are within Zhent-controlled territory or

are dealing with afliated merchants or caravans. In

such a case, mundane equipment

procured from the Black Network carries a standard discount of

5%, and Diplomacy checks made by a Zhent character to lower

the price of magic items or special equipment gain a +2 bonus.

Acting within the Zhentarim

A group of adventurers might be put together by the Zhentarim

in order to further the organizations goals in nontraditional

ways. The group might be tasked with rooting out priests loyal

to Cyricist in the Moonsea region, or beating the Harpers to a

rumored artifact or portal. Such groups would be well supported

with gold, magic items, and the aid of friendly contacts in the

area in which they are operating. Individual Zhentarim might

be paired up with compatible party members from within the

ranks to form these independent adventuring bands, or an entire

group of adventurers might be lured into the fold by promises

of treasure and authority.

Acting Outside the Zhentarim

Being a member of the Zhentarim does not make a character

unacceptable in an adventuring partyin fact, the members

easier access to high-quality weapons, magic items, and special

equipment could be seen as a great benet. While the entire

party cannot abuse the Zhentarims privileges, he can still bring

items into the group that might not normally be available. In

the Moonsea and along the Black Road, Zhents are considered

a part of everyday life, and thus an independent agent of the

Black Network might even be welcome in a party that is not

composed entirely of evil characters.

M agic and the energy of the planes ow

freely throughout the world of Toril.

Archmages wield unthinkable powers,

and priests of dark gods perform rituals to

concentrate evil in their unholy shrines. The

direct effects of such power being directed by mortals are obvi-

ous to allbut there are more subtle consequences as well. In

the labyrinth of darkness and stone beneath the surface of the

world, such energies pool to create earth nodes, where powerful

magic is trapped in the stone itself. This power waits to be

tapped by those sensitive to its presence, but other concentrated

sources of power exist as well.

Nodes of pure evil dot the landscape where acts of unspeak-

able immorality have taken place. Likewise, the newly formed

Shadow Weave has minor imperfections that cause its energy

to leak onto the Material Plane and infuse the surrounding

environment with its corrupt arcane nature. Shrines to evil

deities are imbued with the essence of faith itself, translating

into boons for those who follow the god and corruption for

those who do not. Finally, an insidious form of corruption can

be found where elder evils tread. These beings of pure evil leave

behind traces of their power that can corrupt for generations

those born in the area.

Evil Nodes

Certain concentrations of evil energy radiate like a beacon to

magic-wielding creatures in the area. The power is not visible

to the naked eye, but can be detected by those with the ap-

propriate knowledge and sensitivity. Evil spellcasters pay dearly

for knowledge of the location of evil nodes, which increase

the effectiveness of their spells and allow them to call forth

powers above and beyond their normal ability. Evil outsiders

and intelligent undead that can cast spells also lair around

evil nodes whenever possibleand often ght each other for

control of such an area.

Many node locations are already known, especially among

those who travel in evil circles, and others have yet to be dis-

covered. Nodes manifest themselves in different ways, from a

constant shadowy aura to an area of stale air that seems to assault

the lungs of nonevil creatures that come near. Several example

nodes and their locations are given below, although many more

exist across and underneath Faern.

Detecting an Evil Node

The boundaries of an evil node are not visible to the naked

eye unless the node itself manifests some visible effect. An evil

node can be detected, however; any creature that comes within

30 feet of the outermost layer of an evil node can make a DC

20 Intelligence check, or a DC 20 Spellcraft check if it has the

appropriate Node Spellcasting feat. Evil creatures gain a +2 bonus

on this check. A successful check of either sort reveals the source

and direction of a concentration of evil power. Characters with

the appropriate Node Spellcasting feat recognize this power as

an evil node, though they cannot determine its extent, shape, or

class without physically mapping it.

The shape of an evil node is not determined by the surround-

ing geography. It might extend for some ways underground, into

the side of a mountain, or through the waters of a river or lake.

In some cases, most of an evil node might be hidden by such

a feature, allowing creatures of an appropriate sort to take it

over without much disturbance. Evil spellcasters often excavate

such areas for their lairs, extending a tower into the air and a

dungeon underground in order to fully benet from the nodes

area of inuence.

95

Evil Places

Evil Node Class and Size

The power of an evil node is determined by its class, a number

that normally falls between 1 and 5. The higher the number, the

more powerful the evil node. Weak evil nodes are more common

than strong ones. The majority of evil nodes are Class 1 or 2;

only a few Class 3, 4, and 5 nodes have been discovered. Evil

nodes more powerful than Class 5 have not been found, although

theoretically they could exist.

Evil nodes of Class 2 or higher diminish in strength as they

radiate out from the core. The intensity of a powerful node is

measured in layers; a node has as many layers as its class. Thus,

a Class 2 evil node has two layers, while a Class 5 evil node has

ve. The innermost shell has the highest rating, equal to that of

the entire node. Each layer beyond the rst has a class rating 1

point lower than the layer it surrounds. For example, in a Class

3 node, the innermost Class 3 area is encased in a Class 2 layer,

which is surrounded by a Class 1 layer..

The size of an evil node is linked to its class, as shown on

Table 51.

Layer Width: This value describes the thickness of each

layer in the node. For example, a typical Class 3 node might

consist of three layers, each 50 feet wide.

Node Diameter: This numerical range represents the

overall diameter of the node, from one outermost edge of its

Class 1 shell to the exact opposite edge of the same shell.

Evil Node Powers

An evil nodes class and the values of its various layers have

implications regarding the powers it provides. Except for the

bonus the node grants to effective caster level (see below), these

powers are available only to a character with the appropriate Node

Spellcasting feat. A character must be aware of an evil node in

order to use any of its powers.

Bonus to Effective Caster Level: Any evil spellcaster (or evil

creature with spell-like abilities) can take advantage of this basic

feature of an evil node. An evil spellcaster standing within an

evil node layer can attempt to add its class to the effective caster

level of any spell he casts. To succeed, he must make a successful

Intelligence check (DC equal to nodes base DC + spell level)

while casting the spell. (Making this attempt does not change

the spells casting time.) If the check fails, the spell is simply

cast at the characters normal caster level. If the check succeeds,

the spellcaster adds the layers class to his caster level for that

spell. A character with the appropriate Node Spellcasting feat

can attempt a Spellcraft check instead of an Intelligence check,

against the same DC, for this purpose.

A spellcaster can choose to use less of a nodes power than is

available in order to lower the DC for the check. For example,

a spellcaster might elect to add only two levels to his effective

caster level in the center of a Class 4 node, thereby lowering the

DC from 25 + spell level to 15 + spell level.

A bonus to effective caster level has several effects on spells,

although some forms of magic benet more than others. All ef-

fects dependent on caster level (such as caster level checks, damage

dice, duration, range, and the like) are calculated according to the

new caster level. For example, if a 9th-level cleric successfully

uses node magic to improve the caster level of a ame strike

cast in the center of a Class 4 node, the spell deals 13d6 points

of damage and has a maximum range of 230 feet because the

caster has an effective caster level of 13th (9th-level cleric +

Class 4 node). The bonus to effective caster level does not allow

a spellcaster to exceed a spells maximum damage or other xed

limit (if applicable).

A spellcaster using an evil node in this way must make a

separate check for each spell he wants to modify.

New Node Types and Node Magic Feats

Node magic was first introduced in the Underdark supple-

ment, with its description of earth nodes. All the node

magic feats in that book refer only to earth nodes. With the

introduction of evil nodes and Shadow Weave nodes in this

book, the roster of node magic feats has been expanded. Now,

whenever a character chooses the Node Spellcasting feat, he

must attune himself to a specific type of nodeearth, evil,

or Shadow Weave. Thereafter, any node magic feats he selects

apply to that type of node only. It is possible to select Node

Spellcasting more than once, applying it to a different node

type each time. In this case, the other node magic feats must

also be selected more than once to apply to different types

of nodes.

A character with the Node Spellcasting feat gains a +2

bonus on his Intelligence check to detect a node of a type to

which he is not attuned.

Revised node magic feats can be found in Chapter 2, begin-

ning on page 25.

Evil Places

Granted Spells: Evil nodes are often tied to a specic theme,

such as darkness or undead, and they can grant spells to evil

spellcasters who are sensitive to their magic. Every evil node can

grant a number of spells equal to its class, with a maximum spell

level equal to its class. For example, a Class 4 evil node can grant

four spells of 4th level or lower. A character with the appropriate

Node Spellcasting feat can access any of a nodes granted spells

that he is high enough in level to cast normally. To make use

of a node-granted spell, a character must stand inside the node

and attempt a Spellcraft check (against the nodes base DC; see

Table 51).

A character who prepares spells can prepare each of a nodes

granted spells that he can cast, provided that he does so while

within the node. No extra spell slots are granted; these spells

must be prepared within the characters normal allotment and

in the appropriate spell slots. The character must succeed on a

Spellcraft check for each spell so prepared (see above). Failure

indicates that the spellcaster cannot prepare that spell or attempt

to prepare any other node spells for 24 hours. Once prepared, a

node spell is treated like a normal spell prepared by the character.

If the spellcaster leaves the node, he can still cast the spells he

prepared while there.

A spellcaster who does not prepare spells (such as a sorcerer)

cannot use a node-granted spell outside the node. As long as he

remains within the node, however, he can use the node-granted

spell as if it were one of his spells known at the appropriate

spell level. No extra spell slots are granted; these spells must

be accounted for within the characters normal allotment. The

caster must attempt a Spellcraft check each time he tries to use

a node spell in this way; making this attempt does not change

the spells casting time. Failure indicates that he cannot use

that spell and may not attempt to use any of the nodes spells

for 24 hours.

Imprison: A character who is attuned to evil nodes can

imprison other creatures inside an evil node indenitely.

Trapped creatures are not visible, may not communicate with

the outside world, and cannot affect their environmentin

effect, they are in a state of suspended animation. A node can

accommodate a number of trapped creatures equal to its class,

and no single creature can have more Hit Dice than three

times the nodes class.

A character attempting to imprison a creature must attempt

a Spellcraft check (against the nodes base DC) while he and the

creature are both standing within the node. The creature must be

willing to be imprisoned, whether through charming, compulsion,

bribery, or agreement. Failure on the check indicates that the

creature is not imprisoned, and the character cannot attempt

to imprison that creature against for 24 hours. Attempting to

imprison a creature requires a standard action that provokes

attacks of opportunity.

Imprisoned creatures disappear, dispersed within the energy

of the node itself. They cannot speak or act, do not require sleep,

food, or water, and do not ageessentially, they cease to exist. If

a node has reached its imprisonment limit, no one can imprison

new creatures there. A character attempting to imprison a crea-

ture instantly knows whether the node is full, although he does

not know what creatures are imprisoned there if he is not the

one who imprisoned them. Objects and nonintelligent creatures

cannot be stored in a node in this frashion.

A character who has imprisoned a creature in an evil node

can retrieve the creature from any evil nodenot just the one

he stored it inby making a Spellcraft check (against the DC

needed to imprison the creature). Success summons the creature

wherever the character designates within the area of the node.

Attempting to release an imprisoned creature is a standard action

that provokes attacks of opportunity.

A spellcaster other than the one who trapped the creature

can also attempt to retrieve it, but only within the evil node

where the creature was originally imprisoned. To retrieve a

creature stored by another character, the spellcaster must make

a Spellcraft check (DC equal to the nodes base DC + the caster

level of the character who originally imprisoned the creature).

Success indicates that a trapped creature (determined at random,

if more than one is imprisoned) appears at a point designated by

the character retrieving it.

Mining and Modifications

As noted above, evil creatures and spellcasters might choose to

make their lairs within the area of an evil node. Such creatures

often modify an evil node or the surrounding geography to better

take advantage of its powers or to better defend themselves. A

creature might build a tower or an underground fortress within

the area of a node, create a temple to an evil deity, or make

another physical modication to the nodes space.

Customization must be done by the appropriate physical

means and takes the same amount of time that such a project

normally takes. Ensuring that the node remains magically

intact during the process requires a successful Spellcraft

check (DC equal to the nodes base DC + 10) by an overseeing

character with the appropriate Node Spellcasting feat when the

customization is complete (or after each week of an ongoing

customization project). Each failed check permanently reduces

the nodes class by 1.

Example Evil Node

A renegade feyri named Entreya lairs near this evil node, which

spoils all of the plant life and water within its area. It can be

found on the eastern edge of the High Forest, about seventy-ve

miles south of the ruins of Hellgate Keep.

Shadow Weave Nodes

As more and more of Shars followers manipulate the Shadow

Weave toward their vile ends, it has begun to leave traces of its

corrupted power across Faern. These pools of leaking Shadow

Weave magic are known as Shadow Weave nodes. Such nodes

are exceedingly rare, but for those Shadow Weave users who

know of their existence and location, they are a very powerful

tool indeed.

Shadow Weave nodes follow all the rules for evil nodes with

regard to detection, utilization, class and size, and modications,

although only Shadow Weave users can benet from a Shadow

Weave node. These nodes do not have the imprisoning ability of

an evil node; in addition, their powers are different from those

of evil nodes, as described below.

Bonus to Effective Caster Level: Evocation and transmuta-

tion spells cannot be modied by a Shadow Weave node, nor can

spells with the light descriptor. The Spellcraft DC to increase the

caster level of an enchantment, illusion, or necromancy spell cast

within a Shadow Weave node is reduced by 4.

Granted Spells: Shadow Weave nodes almost always grant

spells from the enchantment, illusion, and necromancy schools,

as well as those with the darkness descriptor. They cannot grant

evocation or transmutation spells (except those with the darkness

descriptor), or those with the light descriptor.

Empowerment: A character with the appropriate Node Spell-

casting feat can draw energy from a Shadow Weave node, making

him stronger, faster, and more robust. To do so, the character

must attempt a Spellcraft check (against the nodes base DC) while

standing within the node. Failure indicates that the character

gains no benet and may not again attempt empowerment within

this node for 24 hours. Success grants the character a bonus to

Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution equal to the nodes class for

a period of 1 hour. The character can choose to use the bonus

for one ability score or to distribute the bonus among any or

all of those ability scores at the time of empowerment. He can

choose not to take advantage of the nodes full strength in order

to lower the DC of the Spellcraft check.

For example, a Sharran priest in a Class 5 Shadow Weave node

decides to empower himself before battling a group of adventurers.

If he succeeds on his DC 30 Spellcraft check, he can distribute 5

points between his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.

If he only wants to boost his Constitution by 2 points for some

extra hit points, then he could do so by making a DC 15 Spellcraft

check (a Class 2 nodes base DC).

Example Shadow Weave Node

Darger Ironmoots clan of dwarf worshipers of Shar has built its

underground fortress around a Shadow Weave node deep in the

Great Rift. The node appears as a fractured rock that continually

leaks shadow up into an impenetrable darkness.

Great Rift Shadow Weave Node

Granted Spells: silent image, scare, rage, control darkness and

Shrines

The gods of Toril play an active role in the day-to-day affairs

of the worlds inhabitants, and are a force in their lives as much

as nature, magic, life, and death. Generations upon generations

have spent amazing amounts of money and time building grand

temples to venerate these gods, and wars have been fought in

their names. But, at its heart, all religion is local, especially

for deities whose power is linked to the number and strength

of their followers. Not every town has a grand temple, and not

every crossroads inn has a cleric of the local gods (of which

there are usually many). For these places, a shrine must sufce

as a gathering place and focal point for their worship. A shrine

can be built and dedicated by a priest, or an existing structure

or physical feature could be recognized as a shrine because of

its common use in ceremonies conducted by local worshipers.

However they come into being, the gods certainly recognize and

appreciate these shrines, and the best of them draw more than

their fair share of divine attention.

A shrine occasionally serves as a conduit for a minuscule por-

tion of a gods power. While this transformation most often takes

place at the hands of a beseeching cleric or lay priest, sometimes

a deity takes the initiative to infuse an area personally. Some

shrines are naturally created when a god makes a direct impact

on an area. Many of the known shrines of Faern were created

during the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked among

mortals and fought terrible battles against one another and the

continents denizens.

Shrine Appearance

A shrines location can take practically any physical form, from

a carved stone idol, to a natural lake or cavern, to a grove of

sacred trees. A shrines form and location usually represent some

aspect of the gods portfolio, but need not do so. Shrines that are

centered around an artifact or specic piece of landscape radiate

outward, but their size has no bearing on the potency of their

effects. In fact, shrines of all sizes exist. Some are no larger than

a tangle of vines that can surround a single worshiper, while

others might encompass an entire mountaintop.

Detecting a Shrine

Since most shrines appear mundane, they can be difcult to

detect for those who do not know of their existence. Sometimes

they manifest minor physical effects connected to their aspect

in some way. A virgin grove dedicated to Silvanus might have

98

Evil Places

a sweet wind blowing through it at all times, while the air in a

cave dedicated to Bane might cause all nonbelievers to wheeze and

choke. In order to recognize these signs as signifying the presence

of a shrine, a character standing within it must make a successful

DC 15 Knowledge (religion) check. If the check result exceeds

the DC by 5 or more, he can determine the strongest facet of

the gods alignment; for example, a shrine to Mask would radiate

chaos, while one dedicated to Loviatar would radiate evil. If the

check result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, he can determine

which god the shrine is dedicated to.

Shrine Powers

Shrines are not just places of worship; they contain a small

seed of their gods power, granting boons to loyal followers

and casting curses on those not of the faith. These benets

for followers can be eeting insights into history or matters

of the arcane, or they can be full-edged powers that last for

a day or more. Whatever the boon, it exists at the whim of the

god that provided it, which means that it can be taken away

as easily as it was granted.

The energy that radiates from a shrine is ambientit

becomes a part of the location itself. It cannot be used for any

purpose other than the benet of a gods follower, and even then

only the most dedicated followers gain the gods favor. A cleric

or paladin of the appropriate deity can gain a shrines benet

whenever he wishesunless the god has decided to punish him

for transgressions against the faith. Followers of a deity are not

so lucky, and must make either a DC 15 Knowledge (religion)

or Charisma check in order to gain the shrines benet. Having

a priest lead the ritual invoking the shrines power provides a

+4 bonus on this check. A follower can only invoke the powers

of a shrine once every 24 hours, regardless of the success or

failure of the attempt.

As stated, every shrine has a ritual or other requirement

that a follower must perform or fulll in order to beseech his

gods favor. These rituals vary from the sacrice of gold and

jewels to blood rites to a prolonged period of prayer or medita-

tion. Priests of a god automatically know the nature of such

rituals, but others must research them or learn them from

an appropriate cleric. Researching the ritual for a particular

shrine requires a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check or bardic

knowledge check.

Example Shrines

The following shrines are well known to the clergy of their

respective gods. A successful DC 25 bardic knowledge check,

Knowledge (local) check, or Gather Information check reveals

their location as well, although poking around too much is certain

to raise the curiosity of nearby clerics of the god in question.

Each shrine entry is organized in the same general format, as

described below.

Shrine Name

A description of the shrines appearance, location, and guardians

(if any) follows the name entry.

Ritual: This section describes the ritual that grants a benet

to followers, and spells out any skill check or ability check, time

commitment, or sacrice that must be made to complete the

ritual. These rituals can be performed by anyone, but only those

devoted to the god in question can receive a rituals benets. All

others suffer some baleful effect for having the arrogance to

plead to a god that they do not worship.

Ritual Benet: A description of the benet conferred to a

follower that successfully completes the ritual.

Baleful Effect: Nonfollowers who perform the ritual or

otherwise desecrate the shrine suffer the effects described this

section. No saving throw is allowed against these effects unless

otherwise noted. Secondary curses are often given and usually

allow a saving throw of some kind.

Additional Information: Guardian creatures, example encoun-

ters, and any other useful information for DMs and players can

be found here.

The Vale of Whispers

The supplicants of Shar value secrets above gold. Many of Shars

faithful spend their entire lives gathering and keeping secrets,

using them as currency to increase their standing within the

church and to stay in the favor of their goddess. Every secret

whispered to a priest or follower of the Lady of Loss is heard

by the deity as well, and she stores them all in an unholy shrine

known as the Vale of Whispers.

The vale is actually a 100-foot-radius, dome-shaped cave

created by an overhang of rock at the southern end of the Gray-

peak Mountains, just northwest of the Marsh of Chelimber. The

cave is said to be as old as Faern itself, and its oor and ceiling

are covered by thousands of needlelike rock formations. In the

evening, when the light of the setting sun streams in through the

caves only entrance, these stony teeth give one the impression

of walking into the maw of a creature of legendary evil.

It is only after one walks inside that the true nature of the

place can be determined. All the whispered secrets of Faern make

their way here, and they bounce around the cave ceaselessly. A

hushed cacophony persists in the cave at all times as whispers echo

off the walls and stones. No matter where one stands within the

cave, every minute or so a secret will reverberate to precisely his

spot, that whisper briey becoming much louder and clearer than

the others. Otherwise he hears only the gurgle of the other secrets

as they ow around the room. Animals cannot stand the sound

of this incessant whispering and have learned to avoid the cave. It

requires a successful DC 15 Diplomacy check or Handle Animal

check to coerce a familiar or animal companion (respectively) into

the cavern; all other animals will refuse to set foot inside.

Occasionally the secrets seem to take form and it like

shadows around the room. In reality, this disturbance is a ock

of ultrapowerful shadows bound by Shar to guard the Vale of

99

Evil Places

Whispers against faithless intruders. Anyone not of the Sharran

faith (or not accompanied by a cleric or follower in good stand-

ing) who spends more than a few rounds inside the cavern comes

under immediate attack by the shadows. Fighting them is made

even more difcult by the preponderance of stalagmites and

stalactites, which provide no barrier to the shadows but cause

major problems for corporeal creatures trying to target their

attackers. Even if the shadows are slain, they reappear within

the vale in 2d20 hours.

Vale of Whispers Ritual: The ritual used to invoke the

shrines power is quite simple. A supplicant must nd her way

to the center of the chamber, where thousands of simultaneous

whispers can be clearly heard. She must kneel here and listen to

the whispers until she can discern a single secret that repeats

itself over and over again. Doing so requires a successful DC 15

Intelligence check followed by up to 1 hour of meditation. For

every 2 points by which her check result exceeds the DC, the

time necessary to discern the secret is lessened by 5 minutes. A

priest of Shar automatically succeeds at the ritual, although if

she fails her Intelligence check she must meditate for the full

hour in order to receive the rituals benet.

Ritual Benet: The character gains a +20 circumstance bonus

on all Bluff checks related to a single course of action for 24

hours. Thus, if the character was on a campaign to convince

a town mayor that each of his staff members was corrupt, the

bonus would apply to all Bluff checks made to sway the mayor.

If, during that period, the character used a Bluff check to feint

in combat or bypass the mayors guards, the bonus would not

apply.

Baleful Effect: Nonfollowers who attempt the ritual are

struck with a powerful curse. They suffer the effect of a bestow

curse spell that reduces their highest ability score by 6 points

for 24 hours. There is no save against this effect, and it cannot

be removed by any means short of a limited wish, wish, or

miracle spell.

Clerics of other gods who attempt the ritual, or try to cast

a divine spell, or attempt to turn the shrines shadow guardians

suffer even more. Not only are they hit with the above curse,

but they must also make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell

level) in order to cast any spell during the next 24 hours, as Shar

whispers their darkest fears directly into their minds every time

they attempt to draw upon their gods power.

Bloody Rock

At the northern edge of the Far Forest, where hills and crags

from the Nether Mountains break through the canopy, lies a

deadly shrine to the Beastlord, Malar, where the bones of the

unlucky are doomed to lay. The forest around the shrine is densely

packed with both trees and animals, and hunting is forbidden in

the immediate area. While Malars followers venerate the hunting

of all creatures, this shrine is for the deliberate destruction of

sentient creatures only.

Surrounded by thick clusters of tall evergreen trees, this clear-

ing is almost impossible to nd unless the precise location and

the path to it are known. The surrounding terrain is rocky and

hilly, obscuring vision and making travel by horseback impossible.

Bloody Rock is a dagger-shaped stone that juts out of the earth

to a height of nearly 30 feet. Every edge on the rock is jagged,

and any creature that attempts to climb the rock would nd its

hands and feet sliced by every hold. A dozen standing stones of

unknown origin, placed here by the Beastlord himself according

to legend, surround the rock. The nal feature in the clearing is

a curved stone called the Claw, which has a at area on which

victims are laid as well as a sharp, upturned spike of stone where

many a sacrice has met its end.

Not only is hunting around the area forbidden, but the beasts

that roam it are considered aspects of Malar himself. The god

even sent a Beast of Malar into the area when it became clear

that hostile adventurers had come to destroy the shrine. All

animals in a 500-foot radius around the shrine are automatically

hostile to anyone not of Malars faith, and they are immune to

any magical charms and compulsions that would change this

(although they can still be calmed by successful skill checks and

other mundane means). Animal companions and familiars are

unaffected by this, but trained animals must succeed at a DC 15

Will save or be lost to the Beastlords inuence forever.

Bloody Rock Ritual: Clerics and druids of Malar know that a

fresh kill is one of the greatest tributes they can pay their master.

The ritual of Bloody Rock is the most direct way to offer up

such a sacrice to the Beastlord, although the shrine only accepts

sentient beings (living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3

or higher) as proper offerings. The creature is strapped to the

Claw and ripped over and over again by the ritual leader, using

either his own claws or with a special tool made from the claws

of a bear or large predatory cat. As the sacrices blood ows

downward, it is absorbed into the Claw and disappears. The ritual

takes 2 hours to complete, and the leader must make a successful

DC 20 Heal check in order to keep the victim alive while slowly

draining his blood. If the ritual is properly performed, Bloody

Rock begins to bleed as if punctured in several places. The blood

is gathered in a special container for the ritual leader to drink,

and that act ends the ritual.

Ritual Benet: Whoever drinks the blood collected from

Bloody Rock is protected and revitalized by the elixir. Over

the next 24 hours, if the character is injured in combat, he is

immediately targeted by a cure serious wounds spell. Taking

damage from another source, such as a triggered trap or falling

from a great height, does not invoke the effect. The spell has

a caster level of 20th, and only the ritual leader can benet

from this effect.

Baleful Effect: Any creatures other than the ritual leader that

drink the blood (including faithful followers of Malar) suffer no

obvious ill effects, although they might detect a slight increase

in their heartbeat. In truth, their blood thins and runs quicker

for 24 hours, causing all wounds they suffer to bleed for an ad-

ditional 1 hit point of damage per round until such characters

receive magical healing.

A cleric of another faith who attempts the ritual, drinks the

blood, or tries to channel divine energy while within the shrine

suffers greatly. In addition to being subject to the bleeding effect

described above, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be hit

with internal bleeding as his veins begin to split and burst. The

character immediately takes 2 points of Constitution damage,

and must make another save each hour to avoid further damage

of the same sort. This condition persists until the character dies,

makes three consecutive saving throws, or is the target of a heal

or miracle spell.

Sample Encounter (EL 10): Ritual leader (CE werewolf

druid 6), 4 acolytes (CE human druid 2), 4 guards (CE human

ghter 2).

The Thunder Room

The worshipers of Bane have grown more cohesive since the

gods return and the appointment of Fzoul Chembryl as Banes

infallible mortal representative. They have begun to work more

efciently toward his goals, and their projects continue to become

more ambitious. In a t of religious fervor, a Banite general in

Mintar named Daren Timbide (see page 121 for statistics and

other details) took over an old government building and built

a shrine to his god. He rebuilt the interior of the building to

resemble a gladiatorial arena he had once fought in on the Dragon

Coast, and he dubbed it the Thunder Room.

The Thunder Room started as nothing more than a place for

ritual combat, where slaves, captured monsters, and volunteers

101

Evil Places

from the Banite army squared off for fun and prot. The crowds

grew quickly, and a new level of seating was erected over the

roof of the original building. As with all things in the city, the

arena quickly attracted the attention of Teldorn Darkhope, the

citys ruler, who is also an incredibly powerful priest of Bane. He

attended a three-day festival of violence and gore, even opening

the event with a ritual sacrice in the gods name. The reaction

was immense, and Bane himself noticed this sudden upswell in

the faithfulness of his followers. It did not take long for Teldorn

to requisition the use of the arena several days per month for

celebrations, invocations, and newly christened holidays. Bane

was pleased.

A popular feature of the Thunder Room was the percussion

show that opened each event. Heavy-sounding drums pounded out

rhythms as cymbals and hollow shells told the stories of Banes

greatest triumphs as well as his resurrection. Teldorn crafted a

ritual around these rhythms that involved the severe beating

of a cleric devoted to one of the weaker gods. The rst time he

performed the ritual, he could feel Banes power surging within

him. Fearing that the power Bane had directed to him might

be misdirected during one of the many ghts, Teldorn directed

General Timbide to construct an underground chamber linked

to the arena but well outside the area of battle.

That chamber is now complete, and has a ritual beating circle

as well as a stage for the fourteen percussionists it requires to

beat out the stories of Bane. While everyone who lives in Mintar

knows of the Thunder Room, very few know of the secret shrine

to Bane built underneath the city. Those who do know of it wish

they had never found out, because they are usually the ones being

used in the rituals.

Thunder Room Ritual: Fourteen percussionists and a cleric or

follower of Bane must be assembled in the shrine beneath Mintar

in order to perform this ritual. The musicians are assembled in

their staging area, where they perform the Glorious History of

Bane the Conqueror, a series of percussive vignettes that tells the

story of Banes rise, fall, and resurrection. During the rites, which

take just over 2 hours to complete, the performer of the ritual

must ceaselessly beat a prisoner in the center of the circle. While

any prisoner will sufce for the ritual to take place, the prisoner

must be a cleric of another faith in order for the performer to

gain the ritual benet. The prisoner clerics level of power does

not matter; even the lowliest clergyman will do.

Ritual Benet: The work of beating an individual for more

than two straight hours is not without its rewards. If the victim

was a member of the clergy of some other deity, the ritual

performer feels the strength of Bane owing through him,

making him better able to strike down the enemies of the Lord

of Darkness. The character gains the ability to smite his foes

(as the Destruction domains granted power, but substituting

character level for cleric level) a number of times per day equal

to his Charisma modier (minimum one) for a tenday.

Baleful Effect: It is hard to imagine anyone other than a

follower of Bane attempting the Thunder Room ritual, but

should the cleric of another god attempt to cast a spell or

channel Banes divine energy, the deity shows him the folly

of his hubris. His arms ll with weakness, and his resolve in

combat crumbles. The character is so affected for 24 hours,

during which time all damage he causes in melee combat is

considered nonlethal damage.

The Pit of Many Colors

During the Time of Troubles, Tiamat walked the face of Faern

alongside most of the other gods. She took advantage of the op-

portunity to slay Gilgeam, a rival power in the Untheric pantheon.

A deep pit opened at the site where Gilgeams blood was spilled,

and Tiamat quickly claimed the site as her own before Gilgeam

could corrupt it and possibly use it as an avenue for resurrection.

She used the pit to hoard the wealth she collected while in mortal

form; once swallowed, the loot was transported safely back to her

realm. Today, the pit still stands in an abandoned section of the

town of Unthalass, and Tiamats followers and supplicants use

the pit to give the spoils of their crusade to their queen.

The pit is a 20-foot-wide hole in the earth shaped vaguely like a

falling man. The bottom is lled with reddish-black mud that stays

soft no matter what the weather is like. Gems of various colors

as well as coins of all types from every nation on the continent

can be seen glittering atop the muddy surface, giving the pit its

common name. These objects are always present, although their

composition changes from time to time. Followers of Tiamat

come here to pay her tribute in the form of coins and gems,

which they throw into the muddy pit. The treasure immediately

sinks into the pit, and what happens to it after that is a matter

of theological speculation. Certainly, no one has ever attempted

to excavate the pit or dig underneath it to nd what would presum-

ably be one of the largest treasure hoards in Faern.

The ground on the edges of the pit is treacherous, often sliding

down into the pit and taking whoever was standing nearby with

it. Despite this erosion, the pit never seems to grow any larger.

Parts that slide into the mud are replaced the next time followers

approach the pit, and even Tiamats clerics never know where

these mudslides might occur next. Anyone standing in the area of

a mudslide must make a DC 15 Reex save to avoid falling in as

well. If a creature falls into the pit, the mud acts like quicksand

with all check DCs increased by 5 (see page 88 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). A cleric of another deity takes 2d6 points of

unholy damage per round that he is in contact with the mud.

Pit of Many Colors Ritual: The ritual of the pit requires

the sacrice of treasure and a personal risk by the leader of

the ritual. First, an amount of coins and gems with a gold piece

value equal to 20 times the petitioners level must be sacriced

in the name of Tiamat (thrown into the pit, that is). Then the

petitioner must walk the entire edge of the pit while chanting

to the Dragon Queen. Clerics of Tiamat who sacrice enough

102

Evil Places

treasure and are in good standing do not have to worry about

falling into the pit, because the goddess protects them from harm.

All others must successfully avoid three mudslides in order to

complete the ritual. Falling into the pit is either a sign of the

goddesss displeasure or the unworthiness of the ritual leader.

In either instance, no benet is gained and the petitioner is at

risk of drowning in the quicksand.

Ritual Benet: A petitioner who gains the favor of the

Dragon Queen takes on the aspect of one of her children. The

characters physical form changes to resemble a dragon in subtle

ways. This effect confers a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks for

24 hours, since the character can manifest her draconic pres-

ence. Also, once during the 24-hour period, the character can

unleash the breath weapon of the dragon she now resembles.

The form and characteristics of this breath weapon are just like

those of a half-dragon of the appropriate type (see page 147 of

the Monster Manual).

Baleful Effect: A nonfollower of Tiamat can attempt the

ritual and succeed, although he must sacrice twice as much

treasure (level  40 gp) in order to have any chance of succeeding.

Those who do not succeed are thrown into the pit as described

above, the same fate suffered by followers who fail to please the

Dragon Queen.

A cleric of another god who attempts the ritual, casts a spell,

or channels divine energy within 20 feet of the pit catches the

attention of the Dragon Queen, who sends one of her children

(see below) to destroy the offender. The dragon does not attack

while the character is in Unthalass, but waits for the offender

and those traveling with him to leave the city, at which time it

ambushes the group at the rst opportunity.

The Sting

In the heart of the artistic city of Cimbar lies a secluded glade that

holds one of the citys most painful secrets. Priests of Loviatar,

the Maiden of Pain, have truly found a home in this decadent and

tolerant city. Many of their rites do not even have to be hidden

from the populace at large, and those that do are easily explained

away as underground pleasure parties. Everyone is invited to these

affairs, and Loviatar has gained a number of converts from this

city of artists and free thinkers. Only a special few, however, gain

access to the holy shrine known as the Sting.

The Sting is a natural courtyard surrounded by a house used

by initiates of Loviatar for purposes of their faith. The courtyard

area is composed of soft earth covered completely by grass, and

various trees obscure the vision of those within. Four walkways

made of stepping stones lead from various mansion doors to

the center of the courtyard, where Loviatar can be properly

worshiped. At the center stands a misshapen willow tree that has

thick leaves and covered with thorns. This is where the faithful

make their prayers.

The Tree of Loviatar is not alive, but it is the conduit for

Loviatars power when the ritual is properly conducted. Its leaves

are tough and whiplike, and the thorns can be used to cause

grievous wounds or painful stings as necessary. Should the tree

or worshipers come under attack, the tree will spring to life in

defense of the shrine (see below for the trees statistics). It attacks

all nonworshipers mercilessly until it is destroyed or the shrine

is free of invaders.

The Sting Ritual: The ritual leader must provide seven

objects that have been inside seven different individuals bodies

and caused them pain. These items could be weapons that were

used to puncture someones body, sharp barbs or caltrops that

were swallowed and regurgitated, or any number of other things.

These items are placed on a special platform carved into the

trunk of the Tree of Loviatar, at which time the ritual leader

kneels and begins to pray to Loviatar. The tree slowly begins to

animatea limb shakes, a leaf jerks, a root creaksuntil the

branches are all shaking and the leaves whipping around in a

fury. If the goddess is pleased with the offering and prayers, the

ritual leaders body will be stung by a hundred shallow cuts from

the thorns on the trees leaves; if the goddess is not pleased, the

tree animates and attacks.

Ritual Benet: The character becomes virtually immune to

pain for 24 hours, gaining damage reduction 2/ for the duration

of the effect.

Baleful Effect: Should the ritual leader fail to please Loviatar,

or a nonafliated cleric attempt to cast a spell or channel divine

energy within the shrine, the tree animates and attacks. Clerics

of Loviatar are not immune to the trees attacks, but the tree

will not kill such a character. It will attack for a few rounds to

teach the errant cleric a lesson, and then drop him to the ground,

bleeding and properly chastised.

Skills and Feats: 

Frenzy (Ex): The Tree of Loviatar can fly into a frenzy,

striking all creatures in reach with 2d4 thorny whips. Doing

so strains the tree, however, causing it to be inactive for

1 round after such an attack. It can maintain its hold on

grappled creatures during its down time, but does not deal

damage to them.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Tree of Loviatar

must hit with a thorny whip attack. It can then attempt to start

a grapple as a free action that does not provoke attacks of op-

portunity. The tree has dozens of thorny whips, so it can grapple

as many creatures as it likes and still make full attacks against

nongrappled opponents.

The Caves of Cwuvain

Location: This cavern system can be used as the location of a

great treasure, guarded by the undead spirit in area 7. The elven

history of the spirit lends itself to a forested region such as the

Dales or the Chondalwood.

The entrance to the cave is low and framed by the gnarled

roots of an ancient oak tree. At its mouth, the cave oor is strewn

with leaves and forest debris, and it shows the signs of recent

passage, including a large black smudge on the roofprobably

scorch marks from a torch. The slightest hint of a breeze issues

from the mouth of the cave, carrying with it a smell of earth

and the faintest whisper of a moan.

As the PCs progress deeper into the cave, the moaning grows

louder until its source is reached at area 5.

1  The Auditorium

This rst and largest chamber is wide and low-roofed (ranging

from 5 to 7 feet high), with many dark alcoves and ssures

in the walls. The oor is strewn with rocky debris, which

reduces movement rates by one-quarter. However, a cleared

path stretches from the entrance to area 2. Nothing else of

interest is here.

2  The Crooked Stair

This staircase is partially natural and partially constructed,

as any dwarf can plainly see. It is entered from area 1 by way

of a great crack in the wall. The stair is only wide enough for

one Small or Medium creature, and the steps tilt dangerously

towards the gaping ssure that borders the left-hand side of the

stair for most of its course. Anyone who falls into the ssure

drops 100 to 150 feet, depending from what point on the stair

the fall occurs. If the imp Paxzux (see below) nds the characters

intruding and decides to attack them, it does so on the stair. So

narrow and steep are the stairs that anyone engaged in battle who

misses on an attack roll must make a DC 12 Dexterity check or

topple into the ssure.

3  The Branches

In this area, the PCs must choose between numerous branching

passages. Most often, passages lead to dead ends. It is possible for

the characters to become separated or lost in this area. If the PCs

nd their way to the dead end branch marked with a star on the

map, they nd the skeleton of a priest of Lathander. The bones

are draped in pitiful rags, but the hands still clutch a small iron

box decorated with the symbol of Lathander. The box is locked

(the key can be found under the bones); it contains a potion of

healing and 2 vials of holy water.

4  The Imps Lair (EL 5)

This cave is the lair of an imp named Paxzux. He could be the

servant of a wizard related to the larger adventure, or he could

simply be a free-roaming monster who chose to settle here. He

spends most of the daylight hours here, only leaving near dusk

to conduct his business, whatever that might be. If he is aware

of the PCs approach, Paxzux turns invisible and waits to see

what they will do.

104

Evil Places

The imp is able to polymorph at will into a goat or a raven by

means of his alternate form ability. Paxzux can use his innate

power of suggestion to control the actions of those he meets.

When in his lair, Paxzux always keeps his wand of fear nearby

to use against intruders.

The south end of the chamber is piled with heavy carpets and

many large soft pillows. Bowls of silver and carved oak are lled

with an assortment of local fruits, nuts, and breads (two silver

bowls worth 10 gp each). A wool blanket has been draped over

an iron-bound chest. The chest contains 240 cp, 40 sp, and 115

gp, a chime of opening, and a ring of spell storing containing the

following spellsgaseous form, disintegrate, and passwall. This

area also contains a keg of beer and a barrel of wine, along with

barrels and sacks of bread, dried meat, and fruit.

One of the barrels is not what it seemsit is a mimic. The

mimic guards the imps treasure in exchange for food.

Mimic: hp 60; see Monster Manual page 186.

5  The Windy Passage

This area is the source of the ever-present moaning that lls

these caverns. Along the west wall are three large cracks. A stiff

breeze blows through them, producing the noise. The breeze is

cool and somewhat moist, as is evident by the quantity of lichens

and fungi growing on the walls here.

A dwarf has the usual chance to detect that the west wall of

the passage is false and can be moved (pushed back). Otherwise,

PCs have the standard chance of detecting a secret door here.

The secret door leads to area 6.

6  The Stream

Under steady pressure, the wall slides back, and after a last

gasp the moaning stops. Beyond the wall is a small cave, with

a swift stream owing from a ssure in one wall into a crack

in another. A brisk wind blows from the crack into which the

stream ows. But, strangest of all, is the heavy door in the

opposite wall; its iron bands are carved with runes of guarding

and warding.

The stream is only 2 feet deep at its middle, but the water is

icy cold. Careful examination of the door reveals that it is sealed

with lead. The door is locked, but no lock is apparent. The door

was built to lock automatically upon closing because the elves

who created it never intended it to be opened again. Therefore,

the lock cannot be picked. It must be opened magically (using a

knock spell or a chime of opening) or not at all.

7  The Tomb of Cwuvain

Beyond the iron-bound door is the nal resting place of the

warrior-princess Cwuvain. The elves who defeated her sealed and

hid this area so that no one could enter and unleash her spirit

upon the world.

Beyond the door, PCs can see a small sepulcherlike chamber

studded with large growths of shining crystals. It is like the inside

105

Evil Places

of a geode, only many times larger and more magnicent. In the

center of the chamber lies the remains of a warrior, its bones

still sheathed in now-rusted armor, its skull cloven by a bronze

axe turned green with verdigris. Near its outstretched hand lies

a wooden staff strangely untouched by the ravages of time.

A strange mist rises above the bones; it glows with a pale

green light, and as the heroes watch, it begins to coalesce into

a humanoid shape. They see the face of a beautiful elf maiden

take shape in the mist, but it is a face twisted with evil and an

undying hatred for all living things. Spectral hands form and

extend toward the characters on ghostly

arms; cold ngers scrabble at the air as

the thing advances, oating upon the chill

air.

This is the banshee of Cwuvain. She attacks

as soon as she has fully formed. Evil charac-

ters can attempt to bargain with her in

exchange for whatever treasure

she guards.

The banshee of Cwuvain could not escape this chamber because

of the spells that sealed the door. If the PCs open it, the spells are

destroyed and she might escape. Her armor is rusted and beyond

repair, as are her sword and other items. The DM can place items

here that are important to the completion of a larger quest.

The Curse of the Demon Claw

Location: Place this stone in a temple dedicated to the worship

of demons, or in a place historically associated with the presence

of demons, such as Hellgate Keep.

106

Description: This large round stone, about 6 feet in diameter,

appears to have been shaped by the hand of a mad craftsman. At its

top is the impression of a hand, as though some wizard had pressed

his hand into the molten stone as it began to cool. The stones

dark surface is covered with weird angles and planes that shatter

any light that falls, reecting it back in a cacophony of color that

dazzles the eye and befuddles the mind. A character must make a

DC 20 Will save to avoid being affected by a telepathic command

to place his hand in the impression on the top of the stone. Some-

one who places a hand into the impression must make

a DC 22 Fortitude save or

be affected by a strange

cursed transformation.

His hand is replaced

with an oversized de-

monic hand that gains

benets; the hand is

red as blood and has

long, black, clawlike

nails. The character

benets from the great

strength of the clawed

hand  (+2  Strength),

an additional claw at-

tack per round (+2 to

base attack bonus, 1d8

damage), and the claw

is treated as an evil-

aligned weapon for the

purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

This greater power

comes at a price. Roll

1d6 to determine the

curse of the demon

claw.

1  The claw must be bathed in living blood at least once a day,

or it becomes limp and useless.

2  The claw must be bathed in living blood at least once a day,

or it attacks the character using his own base attack bonus.

It continues to attack until it does damage to the character.

3  The character goes into an uncontrollable berserk fury (as a

barbarians rage) when in combat for more than 3 rounds,

attacking friend and foe alike, and only ending when no targets

are visible to attack. There is no limit to the number of times

per day that this can happen, and the character is not fatigued

by the rage.

4  In combat, the character always drops his weapon or eschews

spellcasting in favor of claw attacks.

5  The claw attacks the character if his hit points fall to 10 or

less.

6  Once every 24 hours, the claw separates from the character

while he is asleep and acts as a crawling clawMon, attacking

If brought to 0 hit points, it vanishes, rematerializes in its

The Greenstones (EL 7)

Location: This is an ancient ruined shrine once dedicated to

some evil god, such as Bane or Shar. It could be located anywhere,

from the wilderness to an urban setting, and introduced to the

party as an opportunity to rebuild and rededicate the shrine, or

an attempt to recover and use the stones for another purpose.

It could simply be a unique encounter to liven up an evening,

or it could be used as a starting point for some greater mystery

involving the greenstones.

Description: The description below is written as though the

ruin lies in a clearing in a forest.

In the center of the clearing stands the ruin of a shrinean

irregular pile of square-cut greenish limestone, with many other

similar stones scattered around the clearing as though blown

around by a violent wind.

It appears that, rather than having been carried and dropped,

the stones were rolled or blown to their present positions. The

green stones do not radiate magic due to a masking effect of the

magic that prevents their being used to rebuild the shrine, but

they do radiate a faint evil aura.

If anyone casts magic circle against evil within 10 feet of any

of the greenish stones, the stones will begin to slowly move away

from the spellcaster. The square stones roll along the ground at a

speed of 1 foot. When not in the presence of protection magic,

the stones can be picked up and moved around without anything

happening; they can even be stacked up to rebuild the shrine. But

at night, the stones always attempt to dismantle themselves. The

shrine must be completed before it can be reconsecrated. A DC 25

Craft (masonry) check is necessary to rebuild the shrine within a

12-hour period. Subtract 2 from the DC for each skilled assistant

helping with the rebuilding, and subtract 1 for each unskilled

assistant. The shrine can only be rebuilt during the day. At night,

the stones always move away from one another.

Casting a desecrate spell on the stones, or making any attempt

to stop them from dismantling themselves at night, causes them

to clump together and form a Huge earth elemental.

Huge Earth Elemental: hp 152; see Monster Manual page 97.

The elemental attacks the spellcaster or the ones who are at-

tempting to stop its effort to dismantle the shrine. It continues

to attack until it is no longer being harassed, at which point it

falls apart. The stones begin to roll along the ground in random

directions until each one is at least 3 feet away from any other

shrine stone.

Long ago, a priest of Selne destroyed this shrine by sum-

moning an earth elemental into it and binding it there with the

command to never allow the stones of the shrine to be rebuilt.

If the elemental is driven out using banishment, dismissal, or

similar magic, the shrine can be rebuilt normally. The stones can

also be used in another construction as long as no shrine stone

is within 3 feet of another shrine stone. Of course, magic circle

against evil will still cause those stones to move, and could result

in the damaging or destruction of the new building.

Hagskull Hill

Location: This setting works best when placed at a location

where the characters are emerging from the Underdark.

Description: Hagskull Hill is an uneven mound of black rock

covered with thick patches of witchgrass. Atop the hill sits a 50-

foot-high skull-shaped rock, while the hill itself rises some 100

feet above the surrounding landscape. Anyone climbing to the

top of the hill sees a 10-foot-wide stone staircase rising to meet

a crenellated platform that gives the skull the vague appearance

of having a protruding stone jaw. Stone doors at the back of the

platform lead to the interior of the skull, as do the skulls hollow

eye sockets.

1  Bone Bed and Breakfast

It is difficult to tell whether this chamber is dungeon or natural

rock, or some combination of the two. The ceiling is low, barely

high enough for a dwarf to stand, with irregular pillars of rock

supporting the ceiling. All about you lie the scattered bones of

hundreds of creatureshumans, elves, dwarves, goblins, orcs,

ogres . . . all the humanoid races that you know, and some that

you might never have seen before. Some are old and brittle,

while others look fresh and picked clean. A broad, low opening,

faintly lit by a dim and wavering light, appears to be the only

exit from this place.

Many of the bones show signs of terrible injurycrushed skulls,

hacked limb bones, shattered ribs. No treasure is here, nor any

weapons or clothing.

2  Help Me, Ive Been Zombiefied

The low chamber opens into a wider cavern, sloping down to an

uneven floor broken by pools of reeking black water that con-

tinually bubble with foul-smelling fumes. The floor is littered

with bones and bodies in various states of decay. Balls of foxfire

and wispy curtains of glowing gases, ever shifting and changing,

provide this chamber with its only source of illumination. A

half-dozen openings of various sizes lead out of the room.

<pause until characters enter the cavern>

As you enter the cavern, you hear a slipping hiss, like a gasp of

alarm and anger. A dozen or more creatures rise up from the

corpses littering the floor. Shambling toward you, the zombies

erupt in a low chorus of moans.

The zombies attack anyone who enters this chamber.

Zombies (12): hp 16 each; see Monster Manual page 265.

107

Evil Places

3  Dark Naga (EL 8)

The passage brings you to a bowl-shaped cavern. The floor slopes

down toward the chambers center. Numerous weapons, pieces

of armor, and common items, perhaps taken from the bodies in

the first two rooms, appear to have been carelessly piled here.

Opposite, a ramp curls up the side of the chamber to just above

the entrance. Beneath it and to your right, another passage leads

off into darkness.

<pause until characters enter the cavern>

As you enter, you hear a slithering, scraping noise. A serpentlike

creature emerges from the side exit. The weird creatures skull

is that of some kind of humanoid. Its body is covered in purple

scales, and its tail is tipped with a stinger.

Ah, I see that you have arrived, the creature says in a grind-

ing monotone completely devoid of emotion. The master awaits

you above, but first he desires that you arm and clothe yourself

from the items you find before you, if you have need.

This dark naga has been ordered to welcome the group. It attempts

to answer their questions, but it will say nothing of how they

arrived here or who the master is, saying only that All will

be revealed in time or It is for the master to say, not I. As for

the zombies, it apologizes that it cannot be everywhere at once,

but soon the group will have nothing to fear from such servants

of the master. The PCs can take any items they wish from the

pile of equipment. Many of the things are rusted beyond use or

so old and rotten that they cannot be worn. None of the items

are magical, and none are alchemical items such as sunrods or

tanglefoot bags.

In each of the following lists, the quality of items is indicated

by their order of appearance, with each group separated from

the next one by a slash: items in good condition / items that

are serviceable but needing repair / items in need of immediate

repair.

In addition to these items, the naga also points out a large

pottery chime. It is black and decorated with a maddening array

of strange symbols. It warns the PCs not to strike the chime here,

but to take it with them, because they will need it. It tells them

nothing else about the object, but they can discover on their own

that it is magical. It is a chime of discord, useful for negating

the harpies songs (see area 5) and other magical sound-based

charm effects. Once the chime is struck, the harpies will leave

the party alone.

The dark naga will defend itself if attacked. The side cham-

ber is its lair and contains its treasure: a giant snow adders

hide (300 gp), eye of the serpent gem (large amber with dark

occlusion, 200 gp), egg of the serpent gem (large milky opal,

500 gp), and a vial with 2 doses of giant snow adder venom

4  The Star Chamber (EL 7)

The ramp spirals up to a passage roughly carved from solid stone.

It continues upward for some distance at approximately the same

slope and radius, completing approximately two full turns before

straightening out and turning into steps. The steps lead up another

twenty feet or so. They are covered by a thick black patina of

ancient blood.

The stair ends near the center of a large, star-shaped

chamber, the floor of which is covered with both carved and

painted cabalistic symbols and weird geometric patterns. The

center of the chamber is graven with numerous overlapping

108

Evil Places

109

Evil Places

circles charred into the floor. This appears to be some kind of

summoning chamber; there are no other exits.

As you enter, a shimmering column of hazy purple light

springs into being at the rooms center. It rises from floor to

ceiling. Within it, you see a shadowy being. Though human in

shape, the creature is utterly featureless, looking as much like a

shadow as the ones your own bodies cast on the floor, were it not

bloodred.

Welcome, it says in a voice that seems to echo from across

a great distance. I expended much of my remain-

ing energy on this plane to bring you

here.  I  need  brave  ad-

venturers such as you,

and called upon favors

owed me by dark gods

and demon lords to guide

your steps to this place.

I hope that fate has not

betrayed me.

Allow  the  characters

to ask some questions

before continuing, and

answer the questions as

needed by the adventure

you  have  in  store  for

the PCs. The shadowy

being answers all other

questions with You will

learn, in time. Use this

section to describe the

quest  that  they  are  to

accomplish.

If the PCs refuse to help,

a horde of shadows emerges through this

portal (the shimmering column of purple light) to attack and

destroy the group.

Shadows (20): hp 19 each; see Monster Manual page 221.

Danger awaits in the star chamber

If the characters agree to cooperate, read the following.

I see you are wise. Your task will not be easy, but the rewards

of success are great. Time is your ally, but do not tarry, for my

power on this plane weakens daily.

You stand within a chamber wholly dedicated to magic. Not

only can it be used to summon allies from other planes, it can also

be used as a teleport chamber.

Before you go, I will give you each a mark, so that servants

like my zombies will no longer harass you. But beware. Not

all the evil that once filled this forest is allied with me. You

will face danger within and without. But this should be of

assistance. . . .

110

A whip of purple re lashes out, striking each character across

the forehead or hand (14 hand, 56 forehead) leaving behind a

bluish welt that never heals. This welt grants the character a +2

bonus to Charisma when dealing with evil creatures, including

the rebuking or commanding of undead. It is also the shadowy

creatures way of communicating with them, for whenever he

needs to speak to the groups members, the welt will begin to

ache and burn.

After this, the column of light disappears. The characters can

return below to question

the dark naga more,

or they can attempt

to use the teleporter.

To  do  so,  they  must

activate it by blowing a

note on a silver ute that they

can nd lying in a corner of

the star chamber (Search DC

15). After it is activated, the

teleporter  delivers  anyone

stepping on it to area 5. The

teleporter remains active for

10 rounds. The PCs should

take the ute with them, or

else  they  wont  be  able  to

activate the teleporter from

the other side.

The dark naga can instruct

them in how to use the tele-

porter. If they encounter the

harpies and retreat, it will

tell them to use the chime

of discord to negate the

harpies song.

5  The Opera Hall (EL 9)

The following text assumes the characters have just teleported

from area 4.

In a flash, you find yourself in a towering natural cavern. The

dome-shaped ceiling seems to collect and focus sound, for even

the tiniest noise generates an echo that seems to go on forever.

High overhead, two large side caverns appear to be open to the

outside by the dim light filtering through them. Opposite where

you stand, a passage leads out of this chamber.

A few moments after the PCs appear in this room, the harpies

attack. They also will attack anyone approaching from the

outside.

Evil Places

With a feathery rustle of wings, several creatures leap out of

the caverns high above and descend toward you. These creatures

look like evil-faced human females with the lower body, legs and

wings of a huge vulture. They begin to shriek a horrific song that

dulls the mind and slows the wits.

Harpies (5): hp 31 each; see Monster Manual page 151.

The harpies have their lairs in the two caverns high above the

main part of the chamber. Their caves grant them access both

to the outside and the interior of the hill. They attack anyone,

even those bearing the shadowy beings mark, for they have no

loyalty to him. He allows the harpies to stay here because they

protect the hill and the swamp from intruders.

Ringing the chime of discord breaks the power of the harpies

song. They know their powers are useless against its magic, and

rather than risk melee combat, they retreat to their lairs. They

will, however, defend their lairs against all intruders, chime or

no chime. Each cavern contains nests made out of feathers,

twigs, and marsh grasses. Scattered coins totaling 1,000 sp,

plus three gems (total value 530 gp), can be found by a careful

examination of both caverns (Search DC 20). The caves are

located nearly 100 feet up a nearly vertical, uneven, wet rock

face (Climb DC 30).

6  The No. 6 Dance Hall

Unlike many of the other passages and rooms in this place, this

broad low hall was obviously constructed by human hands.

Squat, square columns support the low-hanging roof overhead,

while the walls between the columns are carved in low relief

depicting all sorts of evil scenes, from the burning of villages and

slaughtering of humans and elves, to the torturing of victims by

bestial and demonic creatures and the bloody sacrifice of prison-

ers to a variety of dark gods.

This hallway leads from area 5 to area 7. Other than the decora-

tions, it is unremarkable.

7  False Teeth

A pair of squat bronze doors open to the outside world. Beyond,

a stone landing has been leveled out of the floor of a natural

grotto. The ceiling is thick with hanging stalactites, while outside,

a ramp of roughly hewn stones forms a crenellated wall. Stone

steps lead beyond the wall down the hillside.

Anyone approaching this area from the outside is attacked by the

harpies, whose lairs overlook the staircase. Otherwise, this place

is unremarkable except for the fact that, seen from a distance, it

gives the appearance of a snaggle-toothed grin. Combined with

the eyehole harpy caves above, these features give the hill its

nameHagskull.

The Scarab Chamber (EL 16)

Location: Use this location to hold a clue that aids in complet-

ing a larger quest. The mummies and the treasure suggest an

Egyptian motif, so the location is particularly suited to the area

surrounding Skuld, in Mulhorand.

Description: The passage opens out into a large circular

chamber. This cavern looks to have been carved from the rock,

or at least its walls have been shaped from some old cave, for

its circumference is almost perfectly circular and the marks of

the chisel are quite plain upon the walls. Numerous niches have

been carved into the walls; each one holds a badly decayed human

corpse. Visitors would almost mistake this for a burial chamber,

were it not for the strange object in the center of the room.

Beneath a glass case and resting atop a purple cushion, the

characters can see a gleaming golden beetle. It looks wrought

entirely in gold and encrusted with crushed rubies and tiny black

pearls. It has the appearance of a beloved idol, but one dedicated

to evil.

Once the PCs enter this chamber, they have 2 rounds to

explore before the mummies lying in the niches rise up and begin

to attack.

Mummies  (20):  55  hp  each;  see  Monster  Manual

page 190.

The mummies attack until they are destroyed or turned.

Other than the golden beetle, no treasure is found in this room.

The beetle is wrought of solid gold, with a shell encrusted with

rubies and tiny black pearls. Beneath the shell are wings carved

from thinly sliced pieces of a unicorns horn. Its base material

value is 15,000 gp. The beetle can be used as the phylactery of

a lich, or it might contain some small scroll or key essential to

the completion of an adventure.

To reach the beetle, its glass covering must be removed. This

is no simple task, since lifting the glass releases the poison gas

contained within. The gas immediately disperses into the room.

Tomb of Queen NoRis (EL 16)

Location: This tomb can be placed in any swampy region or

underground lake (with modications to the descriptions). It is

accessible by water. The setting is designed with the expectation

that the party includes dwarf or duergar characters.

Description: A large grassy mound, more than 120 feet in

diameter, rises up out of the water. Its shape is too regular to

be a natural feature. Several large gray stones ring its crown,

some upright, some fallen and broken into pieces half hidden by

111

Evil Places

The queen is largely dressed in rags. Her breastplate, mask

and helm are actually gold foil over hardened leather, but the

leather is rotten and crumbles at a touch, leaving a worthless

pile of dust and gold akes. The belt is a different matter; it is

solid gold and encrusted with uncut, polished semiprecious stones.

The primitive craftsmanship speaks of its age; still, the belt is

worth 500 gp. The bracelets are also gold and of a serpent design

with carnelian or amethyst chips for the eyes. Each of the six

bracelets is worth 100 gp. The axe is a +2 dwarven waraxe that

glows when a nondrow elf comes within 180 feet of it.

Eighteen large ornamental stones are embedded in the oor,

connected by etched lines that form an intricate star pattern. The

eighteen-pointed star was the symbol of the queen and is repeated

on her helm and breastplate, but it is otherwise meaningless.

Each stone is worth 2 gp.

The Wizards Way

Location: This simple but deadly trap can be placed in a

wizards lair, either ancient or currently occupied.

Description: This passage is only 6 inches tall, preventing

characters from entering it normally. To further discourage

anyone from nding the way through this area, a greater glyph

of warding holding a greater dispel magic spell has been placed

on the oor of the passage about halfway down its length. The

dispel effect is targeted against any spells currently in effect

on the one who crosses the glyph. The intention is to negate

any polymorph, gaseous form, or other effect used to allow the

individual to enter the tiny passage, thus forcing him back to

his normal size and shape. Any creature of Small size or larger

reverted to its normal form inside the Wizards Way instantly

takes 18d6 points of damage, with no save.

Wizards Way (EL 7)

Clogged Pipe Trap: CR 7; spell trap; location trigger; no reset;

Handbook; caster level 11th); no attack roll required (18d6,

the tall marsh grass. Several scars on the hillside show evidence

of ancient excavations. The most striking feature of the mound

is a large section that has apparently collapsed and slid down

into the water, exposing bare black earth and what appears to

be masonry.

The characters can beach their boat in the shallow water

next to the collapsed section of the barrow mound. The masonry

proves to be a stone wall and heavily corroded bronze door. The

characters must clear away the mud, and then make a DC 23

Strength check to open it. However, the interior of the tomb has

a powerful antipathy spell on it that prevents any nondwarf from

entering (Will DC 22). Those standing at the door can see the

glint of gold within. An engraved stone above the door records

the occupant of this tomb, Queen NoRis; written in dwarf runes

below it is a curse upon all nondwarves who enter.

Squeaking horribly on corroded hinges, the door gives way,

revealing a low circular chamber beyond. It appears that this

place has remained sealed for many centuries, but despite the

ages that have passed, the chamber appears remarkably clean.

A smooth stone oor stretches out before the characters, with

only a thin layer of dust obscuring the patterns beneath. Even

so, they can see here and there the gleam of a jewel embedded

in the stone.

Thirteen niches are spaced at regular intervals around the walls

of the tombeach contains some kind of tall urn, atop which sits

the skull of a dwarf. The far end of the tomb is dominated by a

huge stone altar. A shriveled dwarf corpse rests atop it, dressed

in the nery of a former time, with golden breastplates and

bracelets and a jeweled belt encircling its skeletal hips. A shining

golden helm and face mask covers its head, from which spills

a profusion of dirty blond curls. The corpses shrunken brown

hands still grasp an axe to its breast.

Queen NoRis was a powerful dwarf warrior who ruled with

an iron st long before an earthquake formed the Iceclutch

Swamp. A bitter foe of the elf nations, she led a series of brutal

wars that reduced both the dwarf and elf populations of the

region. The Queens spirit has long since ed, but the shadows

of her former followers are cursed to guard her tomb. Anyone

attempting to despoil the queen draws their ire. They swoop

out and attack, rst casting darkness to extinguish any ames

or light sources.

Greater Shadows (13): hp 58 each; see Monster Manual

page 221.

Each shadow resides within an urn. The urns are otherwise

empty, except for the skulls atop them. As the shadows emerge,

they appear to pour out of the empty nostrils and eye sockets

of the skulls.

So you want to run an evil campaign? Your players are

determined to take the ght to the Harpers for a change,

and youre going to give them what they want. There

are many things to consider before doing so, however, such as the

style of your campaign, the depths of evil you and your players

are prepared to act out or encounter, and how the characters will

interact within the party and with the world at large. The following

section contains advice for DMs, including advice on how to pres-

ent evil in your campaign, how to keep a party of evil characters

together, and the different goals and methods an evil party might

use that would not be part of a normal campaign.

The Tone of Your Game

How evil is the game going to be? This is a question that should

be answered by the entire gaming group, since its possible to

cross boundaries that will make the game unpleasant for one or

more players. Even the DM might nd that some of the themes

explored or specic actions taken by the characters will diminish

his enjoyment of the game. The rst consideration of any new

campaign should be the enjoyment of all involved.

The best thing to do is to sit down with all the players and

discuss the level of evil in the campaign, how far the characters

will be allowed to go, and even specic actions or situations you

might or might not allow. In Book of Vile Darkness, the fol-

lowing acts are considered evil: lying, cheating, theft, betrayal,

murder, vengeance, worshiping evil gods and demons, creating and

consorting with undead, casting evil spells, damning or harming

souls, consorting with ends, creating evil creatures, using others

for personal gain, greed, bullying innocents, bringing despair, and

tempting others. Certainly many of those acts are present in a

standard campaign, and even good characters could be driven

toward them from time to time. But the repeated, deliberate use

of many of these is the hallmark of an evil character. They are

often the evil characters rst choice rather than his last resort,

because committing an evil act can be easier and faster than

acting in a moral way.

113

You and your players should discuss which of these acts are

likely to be present in the campaign, and how obvious they will be.

Some players are comfortable with acts such as drug use, outright

murder, and fetishes as long as they are presented offstage; that

is, they happen out of the game session but affect it in some way.

Others do not mind the presentation of such acts in character

or in the game. It is very important to determine these limits

before the campaign begins.

Another consideration is the frequency of evil in your game.

If you present too much of it, it can become bland and have

less of an impact on the players. After all, if every villain

has strange fetish powers and vile, endish cohorts, then they

become as common as orc chieftains and pickpocketing rogues in

standard games. You want to be able to strike the right balance

between presenting vile acts and situations and allowing the

players to experience the regular world so that they will have

some context for the truly vile things they witness. Again, this

is a consideration that should take into account each players

viewpoint and desires.

What the Players Want

Players might want to play an evil campaign for a number of

reasons. Some might feel constrained in their actions by playing

good or neutral characters, or they might want a change of

pace from their normal heroic deeds. It can be fun to turn the

tables on the heroes of the setting, to perhaps put a crimp in the

Harpers plans or help a tribe of orcs smash caravans en route

from Silverymoon to Sundabar. Scheming to dominate Faern

has always been a part of the gamebut its time to stop letting

the villains have all the fun!

Encounters with Evil

There are some warning signs and pitfalls you should try to

avoid when running an evil campaign. Players might see this as

an opportunity to backstab their fellow players, stealing their

treasure and generally making their lives miserable. Unless agreed

to beforehand, the presence of one or more players with this in

mind can be disruptive and ruin the fun for everyone else. Its

important to strike a balance between the naturally self-serving

nature of evil characters and the goals of the party within the

campaign. Evil works with evil all the time without falling apart

due to internal conicts, and the characters can still act selshly

without endangering the party or committing treachery against

the other characters.

Players who want to play evil characters in order to act out or

experiment with their darker curiosities can also be disruptive to

the group. This ties in with the overall tone of your game, so all

of the players involved should have agreed beforehand to limit

character behaviors and player interactions to a level acceptable

to all involved.

Why Run an Evil Game?

There are several reasons for both players and DMs to want an

evil game. Putting the players in an unfamiliar role can help

shake things up and create memorable roleplaying sessions. Evil

characters have almost as many options as good ones, but players

rarely get to use them in the game. An evil campaign allows play-

ers to play priests of Bane, assassins, and evil races such as yuan-ti,

orcs, and drow without diluting their true nature. Roleplaying

opportunities normally closed to good characters are available

in an evil campaign as well. Rather than planning an assault on

an evil necromancers lair, the characters might hatch a plan

to steal an artifact from the kings treasury, interrupt an

agricultural rite that ensures a ripe harvest every year, or

counterattack a force that has driven a horde of orcs back

toward its home. These different tactical and strategic

challenges can add fun and variety to the game.

An evil campaign also opens up rare opportunities for

the DM. He can use good monsters as enemies, affording him

the opportunity to pit the PCs against gold dragons, celestials,

and paladins rather than red dragons, demons, and blackguards.

Benevolent creatures are often less active antagoniststhey

dont rampage through a village, enslave a towns children, or

any of the other nasty things evil creatures do. Players of evil

characters can formulate their own plots, determining how to

act against normal society to further their own goals.

In addition, good-aligned NPCs provide a roleplaying

challenge to the DMmaniacal overlords and

necromantic wizards are replaced by law-abiding

paladins and good adventurers out to stop the PCs

plots. The DM still plays nonplayer characters as

antagonists, but their demeanor and methods are

often antithetical to the normal selection of villains.

Keeping it Fun

for Everyone

All of the above advice is geared toward one

goalkeeping the game fun for the DM and the

players. It takes a bit of foresight and work to

pull off an evil game. You must decide before the

campaign how far you and the players are willing

to go in portraying evil characters. In preparing

for the game, you must look to monsters that arent

normally thought of as villains and gure out how

to make them into interesting antagonists, albeit

sometimes good-aligned ones. Then, during the game, the DM and

players must keep the party together even while they might be

working toward selsh goals using any means possible to achieve

them. The potential rewards are great, howeveryour game might

Evil denizens of Toril might

pursue their own dark philoso-

phies in the shadows, or they

might actively promulgate vile

doctrines and activities. Every

evil is constantly challenged and opposed.

Forces of all alignments work against what they

perceive as iniquities and injustices. Some foes focus

on promoting their own agendas that conict with

others evil plans. In addition,

good-aligned folk often work

to generally oppose evil or end

Damian Krale

Damian Krale

Damian Krale is a large man. Physically, he is an impressive

specimen, but that is not the extent of it. His deep, booming

voice and force of personality make it difcult to ignore his

commands or deny his wishes. His presence intimidates all who

stand in his shadow, and the dark power granted to him by Shar

radiates like a smothering blanket. His black hair has grown

long, but he keeps his strong jaw clean-shaven to accentuate his

sneering visage. He normally wears the black and purple robes

of his faith, and displays his holy symbol on a thick silver chain

around his neck. He wears three heavy silver rings accented by

amethyst and onyx gems.

Krale has been tasked by the Lady of Loss to coordinate the

efforts of the independent Sharran cells in the Western

Heartland region. His most pressing concern is doing so

in a way that allows each to maintain its independence

while  turning  their  efforts  toward  a

common goal. Exactly what that goal

is remains Krales secret, one he is

unlikely to share with anyone else.

A few of the cell leaders know of

Krales plan, while the rest are

being manipulated without their

knowledge. Rumors of the plan

have begun to leak out of the

region, but with the construc-

tion of the fortress over the

Well of Dragons, the defend-

ers of righteousness have

too much on their hands

already  to  investigate

thoroughly.

The  earth  genasi

monk, Alon, has recent-

ly contacted Krale and

pledged to aid him in his

endeavor.  While  Alon

claims to have been sent

by Shar, the cleric is skep-

tical.  Krale  prefers  to

summon demons to aid him, and

he is still not certain of how Alon came to know of his plan. Still,

the monk has proven useful in defending him from unwanted

distractions, so for now he is content to use the monk until he

can determine what is really going on.

against the first two energy-draining attacks he suffers each

day. Finally, any creature struck by the weapon must succeed

on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be targeted by a blindness effect

for 1d4 rounds.

Qooql

The mind ayer known as Qooql is a

weak, sickly member of his race. His

skin is a pallid pink, and his tentacles

are covered with tiny, bulbous sacks

of tissue that sometimes burst

open, draining pus. He wears an

oversized coat of cloaker skin

that almost loses him in its folds

due to his short stature. Despite

all this, Qooql has an amazing

facility for interacting with others.

He has learned to read the nature

and mood of his opponents and

allies, and uses this information

to get them to do what he wants.

He  has  no  problem  turning

people against one another, using

their fears and jealousies against

them, and manipulating their

sympathies. Sometimes he even

feigns weakness to elicit pity, if

he believes it will get him what

he wants.

Qooql

Partly  due  to  his  sickly

nature and partly due to the

perceived lack of respect and

devotion given to Ilsensine in

the mind ayer community, Qooql

decided almost two years ago to leave the

city and move toward the surface. He reasoned that he could better

serve Ilsensine by corrupting surface dwellers, and there he would

not have to worry about the taunts and treachery of his heathen

kin. He has now taken command of a tribe of grimlocks, as well

as a clan of dwarves who live in shallow caverns on the northern

edge of the Giant Run mountains (for more on the Unworthy

of Ilsensine, see page 90). His ultimate goal is the subversion of

Westgate, but the undead masters who truly run the city have

proven to be an effective roadblock for his ambition.

Vargo Kent

Vargo Kent is a monstrous gure whose entire life has been

devoted to dragons in general, and black dragons in particular.

When he was only 7 years old, his parents were chosenmore

pointedly, forcedto care for a black dragon egg that was near

hatching. The creature that came out was fascinating to the

young boy, who took on the responsibility for its care and feed-

ing. Despite the fact that it tried to eat him several times, and

its saliva repeatedly burned him, leaving scars all over his body,

Vargo wanted to stay around it night and day. As Vargo grew and

his aptitude for magic became more evident, the dragon used its

inuence with him to shape the new mages philosophy. It guided

him toward the outlook he holds today, that dragonkind will one

day rule the world.

That dragon, Amnemis, is still with him, although she now

acts as his cohort. She was his familiar for a short time once

his powers had grown strong enough, but she soon outgrew the

role. Vargo chose another black dragon as his next familiar, a

choice Amnemis is still not happy about. She taunts and abuses

her younger kin, something she gets away with only because of

her importance in Vargos life.

Vargo remained independent for some time, seeking to become

more and more like his dragons through arcane research. After

the arcane alchemical process that transformed him into a

half-dragon left the lower part of his face almost skinless, the

mage decided to join forces with the Cult of the Dragon (see

page 72) in order to take his research even farther. He knew the

organization had lore that could help him, and his closeness to

dragonkind virtually assured him a high position in the group.

Even he was surprised at how high he would rise within only

a few months of joining the cult, when he was given the task

of sifting through the graveyard at the Well of Dragons and

assisting Naergoth in the nal stages of construction of the great

citadel. Now he has essentially taken over the project by virtue

of his charisma and the cult members fear of him. Naergoth is

happy to concentrate more on the defense of the citadel, leaving

the administrative work to this new wizard, who does not yet

even wear the purple. Like Naergoth, Vargo is unaware that a

mature red dragon named Arsekaslyx has been summoned to

aid in the citadels defense.

spells have the following appearances, and his other spells often

have themed appearances as well.

target.

Acid storm: A swarm of black dragons crisscrosses the sky,

raining acidic breath upon the area.

the targets skin and writhes, causing ripples in his esh.

Bigbys grasping hand: The hand is shaped like that of a huge

black dragon.

Fly: A translucent black dragon picks him up on its back.

Lightning ring: Thousands of tiny acid globules spin around

his body, lashing out in a spray from time to time (Vargo

uses spell thematics and energy substitution to alter this spell

accordingly).

Chazzar Ne

Chazzar Ne grew up in the Gray Wolf tribe of Uthgardt barbar-

ians, roaming the savage North with them and learning the

ways of their shamans. She witnessed the orc hordes of 1343

and 1367 DR, and saw the destruction the humanoids wrought

on the lands as they marched. They burned entire forests to the

ground, destroyed or ate every animal in their path, and trampled

the grasslands in mile-wide swaths. It was enough to turn her

burning hatred for all things civilized toward those that straddle

the line between civilization and savagery. She wanted the orcs

out of the North forever; she wanted them dead.

Her rst thought was to unite the barbarian tribes under

one banner, hers, and lead them into the Spine of the World to

strike the orcs at their heart. She worked for nearly two decades

to do so, but her plan was a terrible failure. Not only did the

barbarians resist her leadership, but they also drove her into the

Night Trees, where they believed she would be taken by demons

to their ery realm. Instead, she met a druid of immense power

who controled the many plant creatures that roamed that deadly

forest. Chazzar Ne was immediately enthralled, and saw in the

druid another opportunity. If only he could be convinced that the

orcs were more dangerous than humans and their cities, he could

turn his incredible control over nature toward their destruction.

Unfortunately, he did not agree, and she was allowed to leave the

forest before he turned his creatures on her.

For the past few years, Chazzar Ne has been gathering

strength once again. She created her own totem and drew fol-

lowers to her, foregoing any mention of her ultimate goal. She

created a stable place for them to live and provided all they

needed. Things were going very well for the new tribe until the

werewolves came. Incensed that these humans had encroached

upon their lands, the werewolves swiftly and ercely brought

death to the tribe. Chazzar Ne traveled into their lands with

her dire wolf, Stonefang, as her only companion, and there she

met with the local leader of the People of the Black Blood. She

Alon

Alons thick, muscular body gives the impression that he is made

of solid stone, and those who have been struck by his ying sts

and feet come away with that belief as wellif they come away

at all. He keeps his long, black hair knotted into a braid and

slung over the front of his shoulder. He keeps a blade lashed to

the end of the ponytail for emergencies, although

he does not use his hair as a weapon. His only hint

of personality is the baggy clothing he

wears, shining golds and silvers in the

style of Calishite nobles.

Despite his eccentricities, he is a

grim assassin, serving at the behest

of his master, the tieing sorcerer-

monk, Erent Skall. Recently

Alon has been assigned to

aid the Sharran priest, Damian

Krale. Krale is uniting the Sharrans of

the Western Heartlands for a reason

Alon neither knows nor cares about.

His duty is to serve, and that is

what he is doingfor now.

Daren Timbide

Daren Timbide has risen quickly

through  the  ranks  of  the  Banite

army  stationed  in  Mintar.  He  is

classically handsome, with wild blond

hair that whips across his face when

he speaks, intense blue eyes that can

stare a lie out of a person, and a lithe

body that does not betray his great

strength. He loves to give speeches

and does so with a fervor unseen

outside the ranks of Banes clerics,

some of whom secretly wonder why

he never took up the mantle himself.

Still, he seems more comfortable

preaching Banes edicts from the

generals  platform  than  from  a

temples stage.

General  Timbide  is  a  fervent

worshiper, and spends as much time

celebrating Bane in the shrine he

built as he does practicing weapons

and inspecting troops. He converted

an old government building near the

center of Mintar into a gladiatorial

arena  and  secret  shrine  to  Bane

known as the Thunder Room. There he tortures Banes enemies

to the rhythm of thunderous drums that can be heard through

the streets of Mintar on a quiet night. Unlike many zealots,

Timbide is not anxious to demonstrate the might of his patron

and army. He has no doubt that they could defeat any army on

the continent, but he is content to let them train in Mintar until

the time is right to strike. He knows that Bane will use him and

the army he has helped create to bring a new age of terror to

Faern and its weak gods.

Dorzad ain Vereet, Krinth

Dorzad ain Vereet is a half-human krinth who tired of his

servitude to the Shadovar and went underground to nd a way

out. Little did he know that nine months later he would be the

leader of an organized underground operation whose goal was to

smuggle krinth out of the City of Shade and into the lands below.

Dorzad is a practical realist, and, as such, has formed an alliance

with the Zhentarim, even though he suspects that some of the

krinth he smuggles out never make it to their new homes.

Dorzad is truly a jack-of-all-trades and is moderately successful

across a broad range of skills and disciplines. This made him an

especially valuable slave to the noble house he served, a servant

who could train others in the craft of bowmaking and then turn

around and shake down a debtor or negotiate a fair price for

services and goods. He was always a faithful servant in deed, but

he was frustrated at his captivity. He had many an opportunity to

trade one master for another as several shadow demons tempted

him to their service, but he remained an independent mind who

could never truly serve another.

At rst he planned merely to escape, to see what lay beyond

the oating city in the lands below, but at the moment of escape,

he found that he could not bear to let his fellows remain enslaved.

He stayed in the city and founded the underground movement

that he now runs. He travels to the surface world at least once

a month to gather information and nd contacts that can help

him smuggle more of his kin to freedom.

Dorzad ain Vereet helps a frightened krinth escape into the underground

Horrsin Zespar, Extaminaar

Horrsin Zespar was among the rst generation of extaminaar

to be hatched, and she has grown to be its brightest star.

Her potential was measured along with all of the other

young extaminaar as the leaders of House Extaminos

made their plans. They decided to send Horrsin to the

streets of Waterdeepor, more accurately, beneath themto

begin gathering information on this jewel of the Sword

Coast. While Waterdeep lies far from Hlondeth, its

importance in the affairs of Faern is undeniable.

It was there that they would lay the groundwork

for their plans.

The young extaminaar was arrogant, and

this was almost her undoing several times.

She has grown more canny in the

intervening years but still over-

extends herself on a regular basis.

Despite this aw, she has survived,

and even thrived, in her lair deep

within Waterdeeps sewers. She has

gathered a tribe of kobolds to her,

and has trained them in several of

the rogues arts, and even keeps

a mated pair of trolls in the

caverns for greater defense. In

addition, she claims control over

a band of outlaws that makes the

Horrsin Zespar

Dock Ward its home. In this way, she can gather information

about the city above without having to risk the streets herself.

Horrsin is short for her race, but she is extremely agile and

uses her size to squeeze through bars, portcullises, and enemies

arms in order to escape danger. She has resisted getting any

grafts, seeing them as a sign of weakness. She is completely

hairless, and her eyes are thin and

wide. She has a purple and green

diamond pattern running from the

base of her neck down to her tailbone, and

often dresses to show off these markings.

Leargath,

Draegloth

Leargath has not been particularly

affected by the loss of Lolth in recent

months, since he was always a somewhat

independent spirit. He has no sponsor-

ing house and spends most of his time hunting in the caverns

of the Underdark. He does not even particularly care for the

company of drow, and spends most of his down time in duergar

communities, where he is cautiously welcomed because of his

strength and his casual and often demeaning attitude toward the

dark elves. Leargath has a particular hatred for grimlocks and

mind ayers; he has managed to steer clear of large groups of

illithids up until this point, but when he has the chance to hunt

a lone mind ayer down, he takes it.

Leargath is smaller than most of his race, but this trait helps

him better navigate and ght in the crowded tunnels of the

Underdark. His skin is the deepest black, and bile drips from his

124

jaws when he gets excited or is about to enter combat. He loves

to wade through opponents with his axes whirling, and uses a

normal-size greataxe so he can wield it even while climbing. For

a draegloth, Leargath is quite a social creature, and he has even

been known to tell a joke on rare occasion.

Faern has known great evils over its history, from the

hubris of Karsus to the machinations of the feyri to the

power-hungry Zhentarim under Fzoul Chembryl. There

are three great evils that have been around since the dawn of

Abeir-Toril that dwarf even these, howeverthree evils so foul,

so corrupt, and so powerful that even the gods tread lightly in

their presence. Dendar the Night Serpent prowls the Fugue Plane,

swallowing the nightmares of mortals, Kezef the Chaos Hound

hunts the Outer Planes and Faern looking for fresh souls and the

weakened god who betrayed him, and Ityak-Ortheel seethes in his

Abyssal home, waiting for the day when Malar will once again

call upon him to bring ruin to the elves. Other evils are perhaps

more recently spawned, but no less deadly.

Aumvor the Undying

Perhaps the most legendary lich north of Warlocks Crypt, Aumvor

the Undying is said to lair amid one of the great mountain ranges

of the Savage Frontier. His reputation for cruelty is second only

to Shoon VII, for both are known to have experimented with the

uses of alicorns and blood of unicorns, earning them the undying

enmity of the Fair Folk. Aumvors mastery of the necromantic

arts is unmatched; even today, daring wizards seek him out in

hopes of securing an apprenticeship.

Aumvor rose to prominence during the Netherese Age of

Discovery, during the heady days of the empires expansion across

Faern. While other Netherese wizards sought out the stars and

distant shores, Aumvor turned inward, seeking to understand the

mysteries of death and dying. Aumvor earned the moniker of the

Undying by surviving for centuries in the bowels of his black basalt

castle in the heart of the Lonely Moor, attended by generation

after generation of descendants, all the while untouched by the

ravages of time. Instead of resorting to lichdom, the Netherese

necromancer fed off the life force of a long line of living zombies

he created as servitors, some of them from his own family.

In the Year of Sundered Webs (339 DR), another Netherese

wizard, Karsus, triggered the collapse of the Weave, which tore

125

apart the magical underpinnings of Netheril. The momentary

absence of magic decimated Aumvors legion of living zombies

and triggered his contingency magics, whisking him to the depths

of a secret lair in the heart of the High Forest and transforming

him into a lich. Aumvor never returned to his castle, leaving it and

the fruits of his studies to his great-grandniece Morasha, but the

lichs only surviving descendant has continued Aumvors studies

for centuries since.

What little is known of Aumvors activities after the fall of

Netheril has been recorded by his former apprentice, the Archmage

Briel, who last studied under his mentor in the Year of the Watching

Cold (1320 DR). According to Briels personal memoirs, entitled

A Life Lived in the Shadows of Death and held in the library

of his daughter Brielbara of Baldurs Gate, Aumvor is calculating,

paranoid, and utterly devoid of any moral compass, not unlike

others of his ilk. The lich cares only for his own aims, but he

is unusually willing to adapt his plots as circumstances warrant.

Morashas diaries, entitled Nesoterica: A Study of the Sublimation

of the Soul, date to the period before Aumvor embraced lichdom,

but they, too, depict a practitioner of the Art consumed with the

study of the necromantic arts to the exclusion of all else.

In life, Aumvor was short and stocky, with fat hands, a sizable

paunch, fair skin, and long, unkempt black hair. As a lich, he has

only grown more obese. The Undying One now resembles a bloated

corpse left to rot after a drowning, with his slimy, bone-white skin

distended from his skeletal frame. His eye sockets are empty save

for two ickering points of crimson light that seem to swim in

pools of innite, hateful blackness. Aumvor favors the ne robes

of a highborn Netherese arcanist, and is never without his crown-

shaped headband of intellect or rod of the epic spellcasterEL, which

he plans to use as his regalia once Netheril is reborn.

Champions of Evil

Aumvors Lair

Since abandoning his keep in the Lonely Moor over seventeen

centuries ago, Aumvor has laired in the depths of the Endless

Caverns, far below the sheltering boughs of the High Forest and

the forested slopes of the southwestern Star Mounts. The lich

has claimed a series of limestone caverns carved by a forgotten

clan of Ammarindaran dwarves, which are periodically enveloped

from below by a long arm of Araumycos.

Access to the lichs lair is restricted to tunnels ooded by

a tributary of the Unicorn Run that rises as a spring near the

rivers headwaters. As a result, anyone approaching the complex

must survive passage through bitingly cold waters without access

to air. The walls of the lair are lined with naturally occurring

veins of lead and painted with gorgons blood to render teleporta-

tion into or out of the complex impossible. A one-way portal

in the heart of the lair exits into the bowels of Aumvors old

keep in the Lonely Moor, but the lich has never found cause

to use it.

Aumvors quarters are richly appointed with the trappings

of a highborn Netherese archmage. The lichs servants scour

ruins across the North in search of heirlooms dating back to the

Netherese diaspora. Aumvor particularly prizes tapestries and

sculptures depicting scenes of Netherese society from his youth.

The lich also maintains extensive laboratories, well stocked with

the decaying corpses of his experimental subjects.

The lichs storerooms house all manner of magical treasures

forged by Netherese artisans. Some of the more legendary

artifacts he is believed to hold or have held in his living vaultEL

include the alicorn diadem of Sharrven, the bonestaff of Sade-

breth, the Crown of Horns, the jewel cage of Congenio, and the

pyramid-shaped tear of Ascore. In addition, Aumvor is believed

to own a massive library of spell tomes, most of them acquired

from dozens of crypts scattered across the North by the rst

wave of Netherese emigrants.

Aumvor is personally attended by several dozen absolutely loyal

servitors and guards, including both living zombies and various

other types of undead. On rare occasions the lich has taken a

living apprentice, assuming the student shows great promise and

is of Netherese heritage, but few survive the apprenticeship. Those

who do not are usually transformed into spectral magesMag and

forced to serve the Undying One for eternity.

Aumvors Domain

Aumvor claims all of the Endless Caverns as his domain, although

several other powerful creatures (such as Grimnosthtasdrano,

the Riddling Dragon) and factions (such as a band of illithids

and drow slavers) would strongly contest such a claim should

the lich choose to try to enforce it. In practice, Aumvor holds

sway over the northwest quarter of the Endless Caverns, and his

creations wander freely in this region, far from the unwelcome

light of day.

Deeds of Aumvor

As one of the last surviving arcanists of fallen Netherilif a

lich can truly said to be survivingAumvor hoards every scrap

of knowledge he can acquire regarding his long-dead homeland,

in preparation for the day when Netheril rises anew under his

stewardship. The lich is wise enough to realize that founding a

petty kingdom and calling it Netheril will never recapture the

glories of that which was lost. So Aumvor seeks to rekindle the

culture of magical experimentation and investigation that grew

up in the early days of Netheril and thus seed the rebirth of a

culture of magecraft that will grow to rule all of Faern. He

also labors to escape Mystras strictures on the most powerful

workings of the Art, and thereby to remove the limits he feels

might eventually stie his Netherese empire reborn. Above all

else, Aumvor sees keeping himself alive as of chief importance,

for he is convinced that only he has the vision and the drive to

see his plan through.

For centuries, Aumvor has quietly observed promising

candidates of strong Netherese bloodlines and placed scrolls

and tomes of simple spells where they will be discovered by

those showing promise in the Art. Through his agents, Aumvor

has then subtly encouraged such individuals to master ancient

Netherese traditions and then teach their insights to others he

directs to their door. Although Aumvors actions in this regard

are not unlike that of Mystras servitors, the lichs intent is far

more sinister, for he deliberately encourages those of Netherese

descent who rebel against any limitation on their workings of

the Art.

As an extension of this approach, Aumvor has also labored

from the shadows to start schools of wizardry in the lands of the

Netherese diaspora. Evidence of his guiding hand is seen in Briels

School of the Arcane in Baldurs Gate, the Brotherhood of the

Black Hand in Ascalhorn, and Ulcasters School of Conjuration

in Beregost. However, the legacy of such efforts has largely been

one of spectacular failure, and from such bitter lessons Aumvor

has concluded that he must concentrate his efforts on nurturing

the master/apprentice relationship, the linchpin on which the

culture of Netherese magecraft was built.

Perhaps most disquieting of the lichs deeds was Aumvors

attempt to claim Laeral Silverhand as his bride by placing

the Crown of Horns where it would be discovered by the Nine

adventuring band. It is unclear whether the lich sought to tempt

the Witch-Queen of the North with access to lost Netherese

magics or simply to bind her will to his, but the plot failed

spectacularly when Laeral descended into madness, thanks to

the magical conict between the artifact and Mystras silver

re, and turned on her companions. Although Khelben eventu-

ally rescued Laeral from the stronghold of the Nine, neither

archmage ever learned of Aumvors culpability, or the Lord

and Lady of Blackstaff Tower would have sought revenge on

the Undying One long ago.

Although Aumvor has yet to escape Mystras strictures on

the lost spells of yore, his research into epic spellcasting has

126

Champions of Evil

proven productive. Fruits of the lichs study include such spells

as Aumvors fragmented phylactery and Aumvors soulshatter

(see below). Aumvors greatest success is, of course, ensuring his

continued survival. His creation of living zombies sustained him

for centuries, until he was forced to embrace lichdom. However,

his all-consuming paranoia and careful cunning have done more

to ensure his continued survival than even his magic.

Aumvors Magic

Aumvor  is  heir  to  the

great tradition of Neth-

erese magic and a skilled

practitioner in the Art.

The Undying One has

created  innumerable

spells and magic items

over the centuries, and

he continues his cease-

less experimentation. Two

epic spells of note include

Aumvors  fragmented

phylactery and Aumvors

soulshatter, both of which

are detailed in Chapter 2

of this book.

Aumvors phylactery is

the rune-inscribed skeleton

of Dethed, a former ap-

prentice of Ioulaum and

rival of Aumvor. Aumvor

has cast his fragmented

phylactery spell on his

phylactery repeatedly, and

scattered the individual

bones of Dethed in caches

hidden  throughout  the

Endless Caverns (as well as a few in locations

farther aeld). Most of the 206 bones have been cloaked against

all manner of divination, including detection for magic, for

undead, or for location of Detheds remains.

Aumvors Fate

The return of the Shadovar to the Realms has disrupted many of

Aumvors plans, but also provided the Undying One with great

opportunities. The lich has yet to approach the inhabitants of

Shade or make himself known to them. Instead, he has chosen to

observe the shades as they investigate many sites he has already

plundered. Of course, the Shadovar also pose a great threat to

the lich, for he holds much of the lost Netherese lore that they

seek, and, once they become aware of his position, the Princes

of Shade might well hunt him down without mercy.

of raw materials for researching an epic spell, he multiplies the

Spellcraft DC by 7,000 gp instead of the usual 9,000 gp and

reduces the development time and XP cost accordingly.

Fear Aura (Su): Aumvor is shrouded in a dreadful aura of

death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius

that look at the lich must succeed on a Will save or be affected

as though by a fear spell from a 27th-level sorcerer. A creature

that successfully saves cannot be affected again by Aumvors aura

for 24 hours.

Field Specialization: Aumvors major eld of magic is varia-

tion (epic spell seeds: animate dead, dispel, fortify, reect, slay,

transform, transport, ward) and his minor eld is invention

Aumvor the Undying

Champions of Evil

(epic spell seeds: afict, armor, conjure, destroy, energy, slay,

summon). He cannot cast epic spells based on seeds from the

eld of mentalism.

The base Spellcraft DC for developing spells in the variation

eld of specialization is reduced by 5.

Greater Spell Focus (Epic): The saving throw DC for each of

Aumvors epic spells increases by +2, but the Spellcraft DC does

not increase.

Immunities (Ex): Aumvor is immune to cold, electricity,

polymorph (though he can use polymorph effects on himself),

and mind-affecting spells and abilities.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): Any living creature Aumvor hits

with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be

permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can

remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell

description). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed

by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15

Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.

Touch Attack: Aumvor has a touch attack that uses negative

energy to deal 1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a DC

26 Will save halves the damage.

Combat

Living zombie elves abandon the caution of their race and wade

into combat without concern. They use their bows only if a target

is far off or eeing. They favor longswords and rapiers, and usually

carry longbows or shortbows. Living zombie elves are graceful

and deadly in melee, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful

to observe.

Creating a Living Zombie

Living zombie is an acquired template that can

be added to any corporeal creature (other than

undead) that has a skeletal structure (referred

to hereafter as the base creature).

Living zombies appear as they did in life,

except their eyes turn solid black.

Living zombies can be created by a ritual

that involves the casting of command

undead, dominate animal, person, or

monster  (depending  on  type),  false

life, and feeblemind spells. The process

involves embedding a piece of the caster

(usually a single strand of hair) in the

subject. If this piece of the caster is ever

separated from the living zombie, the template

is removed. Creating a living zombie costs 1,000

gp in materials and takes at least six hours to

complete. A spellcaster can concurrently

control at most one living zombie per

ability point bonus in his primary spell-

casting ability.

Size  and  Type:  The

creatures type changes

to magical beast if it is

an animal, and it gains the

augmented subtype. Other-

wise the type remains unchanged.

It uses all the base creatures statistics and

special abilities except as noted here.

Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by a number

based on the living zombies size.

Attacks: A living zombie retains all the natural weapons,

manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon prociencies of the

base creature. A zombie also gains a slam attack.

Damage: Natural and manufactured weapons deal damage

normally. A slam attack deals damage depending on the living

zombies size. (Use the base creatures slam damage if its better.)

Special Attacks: A living zombie is unable to cast spells,

employ spell-like or supernatural abilities, understand language,

or communicate coherently.

Special Qualities: A living zombie gains the following

special quality:

Life Leech (Su): Living zombies retain a magical

bond to their creator that diminishes the former and

sustains the latter. For every full day that passes

while the bond exists, the creator of a living zombie

ages only half that amount. This effect is cumula-

tive, so a creator of three living zombies would age

only 3 hours (1/2  1/2  1/2  24 hours). This

also means that living zombies

heal naturally at only half the

normal rate.

In the Realms

Living zombies are the creation of Aumvor the Undying, a

Netherese lich rumored to lair amid the mountain ranges of

the North. Only his descendants (e.g., his great-grandniece

Morasha) and his former apprentices (e.g., the writings of Briel)

know the secret of their creation, although it is possible others

have stolen the formula as well. Although Briel never created

any such creatures, small armies of living zombie servitors serve

both Aumvor and Morasha. Both particularly prize elf living

zombies because of their long life spans.

Champions of Evil

Eltab

Eltab, the Lord of the Hidden Layer, is an ancient and power-

ful demon lord who has wreaked havoc in the eastern reaches of

Faern for centuries.

First summoned by Narfelli demonbinders in the waning

years of the great war between Narfell and Raumanthar, Eltab

led an invasion of Rashemen and ruled that land for several

decades after the fall of Narfell. After being imprisoned by the

Witches of Rashemen and then released by crusaders of Myrkul

over twelve centuries ago, Eltab helped establish the theocracy of

Eltabranar in the Eastern Shaar. He played a pivotal role in the

Battle of Thazalhar when the Red Wizards threw off the yoke

of the Mulhorandi god-king, and was then imprisoned beneath

the newly constructed Thayan capital city of Eltabbar when the

Red Wizards failed to banish him.

The Goals of Eltab

Now, after centuries of imprisonment, the Lord of the Hidden

Layer is nally free to seek vengeance against his many enemies.

This grim, hateful creatures chief foes include the Red Wizards of

Thay, particularly the lich Szass Tam, the god-kings of Mulhorand,

and the Witches of Rashemen. He also plots against the follow-

ers of Orcus in the Galenas and the paladin-princes of Impiltur,

who long ago destroyed his half-end son, Agrosh the Scaled.

Once his quest for revenge is sated (if that is ever possible), Eltab

intends to establish a powerful empire in eastern Faern. From

this new base of power, the Lord of the Hidden Layer intends

to reclaim his throne in the Abyss and resume his ancient battle

with Demogorgon, Grazzt, and Orcus.

The Cult of Eltab

Most of Eltabs former allies and enemies think him dead, a mis-

take he has done nothing to correct. However, a small number of

cultists still venerate the Lord of the Hidden Layer, and Eltab has

reached out to a few such groups since his escape from the grasp

of the Red Wizards. Small bands of Eltabs followers exist in the

city of Eltabbar in Thay, in the city of Lyrabar in Impiltur, in the

city of Teamm in Thesk, and in the outlaw wastes of Dambrath,

known as the Swagdar. At the demon lords direction, members of

these cabals have recently begun visiting cities in the guise of Red

Wizards, committing crimes in their name. Through this tactic,

Eltab hopes to undermine the mercantile might the Red Wizards

have built through the establishment of enclaves across Faern.

The leaders of such cabals typically adopt the Thrall of Eltab

prestige class (detailed below).

The Servants of Eltab

Eltab is served by a motley array of demons, primarily glazebru

and succubi he has liberated from bindings in the upper catacombs

of the Citadel of the Conjurers. The Lord of the Hidden Layer

continues to seek out new servitors buried in demoncysts across

the Demonlands, but assembling an army in this fashion is a slow

and laborious process.

Eltabs Lair

After recently escaping the clutches of Szass Tam and the Red

Wizards of Thay, Eltab has found himself in the depths of the

Citadel of Conjurers, the site where long ago he was rst sum-

moned to Faern by the demonbinders of Narfell. This Narfelli

ruin lies in southwestern Impiltur, near the Hill of Tombs in the

foothills of the Earthfast Mountains, at the mouth of Moaning

Gorge. Although the wizards of Old Impiltur warded the Citadel

of Conjurers against entry long ago, Eltab was able to gain access

by way of the demoncysts of the Hidden Layer, detailed below.

The Citadel of Conjurers is the most infamous ruin of

ancient Narfell, and it has played a prominent role in the

history of Impiltur (as discussed below in the write-up of the

Moaning Crown of Ndulu). The fell dungeons of this place are

believed to contain countless Narfelli artifacts and spelltomes,

including many that enable the summoning and binding of

demons and other endish creatures. The last known mortal

to tread in the citadels depths was the paladin-prince Nord,

in the Year of the Moaning Gorge (786 DR). His account of

what he saw therein is carefully guarded by the Paladin-Princes

of Impiltur in the royal library of the Realm of Sword and

Wand in Lyrabar.

Eltabs Domain

Eltab once ruled the 248th layer of the Abyss, known as The

Hidden Layer. This terrible place is a vast wasteland of boulders

and ssures, beset by constant electrical storms of incredible feroc-

ity. The howling wind, frequent lightning strikes, and never-ending

torrential rain make it inhospitable to most creatures, with the

notable exception of demons. Nevertheless, it is home to a riotous

array of extraordinarily deadly plant life, including forests of

assassin vines, bloodthorns, ironmaws, and viper trees.

For more than fteen centuries, Eltabs Abyssal kingdom has

been fragmented into ever-changing efdoms. Eltabs balor lieuten-

ants battle endlessly to seize control of his vacated kingdom. The

most powerful of the balors is Ndulu (32 HD advanced balor), the

general of a demonic host banished back to the Abyss by the Paladin

Princes of Impiltur at the Battle of Moaning Gorge (786DR).

Since the Year of the Stone Giant (160 DR), fragments of

the Hidden Layer, known as demoncysts, have lain buried beneath

the lands claimed by the last Nentyarch of Narfell. Somehow,

in the process of summoning and binding Eltab to their will,

the last Nentyarchs demonbinders inextricably linked Abyssal

fragments of the Hidden Layer to the lands under the sway of

the Nentyarch, creating little islands of the Abyss throughout

northeastern Faern, buried just beneath the surface.

Demoncysts of the Demonlands are typically 100 or so feet

in diameter. Conditions within each demoncyst mirror that of the

Hidden Layer, but the environment within a demoncyst does not

usually interact with the surrounding terrestrial environment. (At

least one demoncyst in the eastern Thaymount bleeds Abyss-tainted

water from the River of Blood into the River Eltar, thanks to the

actions of the rst Zulkir of Conjuration.) All known demoncysts

lie underground, so reaching a demoncyst usually requires digging

or passage through a tunnel of some sort. Creatures and objects

can pass freely into or out of a demoncyst, but environmental

conditions within or outside of a demoncyst cannot push a creature

or object into or out of a demoncyst.

As a result, a demoncyst typically

resembles an odd-shaped cavern with

a wholly different environment than

the surrounding earth or open spaces.

Although  most  of  the  undis-

covered demoncysts lie beneath the

forests of the Great Dale or the Thay-

mount, a few lie undiscovered beneath

the lands of Damara, Impiltur, the

Priador, Thesk, and Vaasa. Many

demoncysts contain imprisoned

ends,  for,  in  the  wake  of

Narfells fall, Nar demonbinders

placed many calling diagrams

(usually  in  the  form  of  iron,

bronze, or silver signs, as detailed in

Unapproachable East) within such planar

pockets  to  hold  demons  they  might

later wish to unleash. When Impilturan

settlers carved out the Great Dale in

the 600s DR, they uncovered many

such demoncysts and inadvertently

freed many of the demons, half-ends,

and tieings bound within during their

subsequent explorations of these strange

pocket planes.

The largest demoncyst, known as

the Hall of the Hidden Throne, lies in

the depths of the Citadel of Conjurers.

Over 500 feet in diameter, the Hall of

the Hidden Throne contains the throne

room of Eltabs long-abandoned palace,

wrenched from the Abyss by the Narfelli

demonbinders when they rst summoned Eltab to Faern in

the Year of the Stone Giant (160 DR). Inscribed on the oor

in front of the Hall of the Hidden Throne is the Adamantine

Binding, an extremely powerful calling circle that ties Eltab and

the Hidden Layer to the eastern Realms. Only the legendary

sword Hadryllis can shatter this binding. Until such time as the

binding is destroyed, Eltab can only be banished to a demoncyst

and cannot depart the Realms. Moreover, for as long as the bind-

ing persists, the demoncysts of the Hidden Layer are inextricably

tied to lands once claimed by ancient Narfell.

Eltab

Deeds of Eltab

The empires of Narfell and Raumathar warred from the Year

of Clipped Wings (623 DR) to the Year of Recompense (150

DR) over control of the Priador. Centuries of warfare culminated

131

in a great decade-long conagration that consumed both empires

(beginning in 160 DR, the Year of the Stone Giant) and left all

manner of summoned beings unchained upon the face of Faerun.

The ruling Nentyarchs of Narfell had long heeded

the dark whisperings of the Crown of Narfell (said

to have been a gift to the rst Nentyarch from the

demon lord Orcus, Prince of the Undead) and

directed members of the Narfelli court to trafc

with demonic agents, in the hopes of mastering

the dark art of sorcery.

Perhaps the greatest of the demons

summoned  by  the  Narfelli  demon-

binders was Eltab, at the time a

powerful demon lord who rivaled

the  ever-warring  triumvirate  of

Demogorgon, Grazzt, and Orcus in

power and inuence in the Abyss.

Some say it was Orcus who revealed

the secret of binding Eltab with the

Adamantine Binding, while others

claim it was a power inherent in the

Crown of Narfell. In an effort

to open a new front against Rau-

mathar, the reigning Nentyarch

directed Eltab to invade Rashe-

men with a host of demons, who

quickly overran the realm. In the Year

of the Black Marble (148 DR), Eltab

claimed Rashemen for himself, and the

demon lord quickly found he had a taste

for ruling in the lands of humankind, with

the almost godlike veneration one such

as he could inspire.

In the Year of the Bloody Goad (105

DR), an Illuskan tribe known as the

Rus arrived in eastern Faern via a mal-

functioning portal that deposited them

on the eastern shore of Lake Ashane.

Although quickly integrated into the

native Rashemi population, the Rus

were powerful berserkers who sparked an

insurrection among the native Rashemi

against the court of Eltab. The arrival

of the Rus coincided with the emergence of

the Witches of Rashemen, a secret sisterhood formed in the dying

days of Raumathar to preserve that empires magical lore.

In the Year of Leather Shields (75 DR), an alliance of the

Rashemi, the Rus, and the Raumviran witches nally liberated

Rashemen from demonic rule. The hero of this conict was a

half-Rus/half-Rashemi warrior named Yvengi, who wielded a great

magical blade named Hadryllis against Eltab, severely wounding

the demon lord and forcing him to ee. The Witches of Rashemen

nally caught up with Eltab in the Sharawood, far to the south in

the Eastern Shaar. They imprisoned him beneath the forest oor

Champions of Evil

and bound a dracolich known only as the Everlasting Wyrm to

be his guardian.

In the Year of the Adamantine Spiral (106 DR), crusaders of

Myrkul from the Castle of Alhanar attacked and (temporarily)

destroyed the Everlasting Wyrm. While plundering the dracolichs

hoard, the followers of Myrkul discovered the imprisoned demon

lord, and, in exchange for ninety-nine years of service to the

Church of Myrkul, the crusaders agreed to release the demon

lord from his binding. With Eltabs aid, the followers of Myrkul

seized control of the city of Shandaular in the Council Hills and

established the theocracy of Eltabranar, encompassing most of

the Eastern Shaar. The crusaders of Myrkul might have learned

from Eltab the ritual of voluntarily transforming themselves

into death knights, a secret the demon had long ago stolen from

Demogorgon, although church dogma holds (or at least held) that

the Lord of the Dead granted them the gift in exchange for

their eternal servitude.

In the Year of the Fanged Gauntlet (202 DR), Eltabranar

undertook an ambitious and ill-fated invasion of southern Unther

and Mulhorand prompted by Eltab, who coveted the might of the

god-kings. Led by an incarnation of Anhur wielding the legendary

Hadryllis, the clerics of the god-kings managed to defeat Eltab

and imprison him in a demoncyst beneath far-off Thaymount.

By the Year of the Greengrass (205 DR), Unther and Mulhorand

had reclaimed all of their lost territory, and by the Year of the

Spoiled Splendors (211 DR), the inhabitants of Eltabranar had

been forced to abandon their realm and ee south and west.

In the Year of Spouting Fish (922 DR), Jorgmacdon, the lead-

ing conjurer of the Red Wizards, tunneled into the Thaymount

demoncyst in which Eltab had been imprisoned for more than

seven hundred years. Using a rediscovered ritual of the Narfelli

demonbinders, he called forth the demon lord to ght alongside the

Red Wizards at the Battle of Thazalhar. In so doing, Jorgmacdon

inadvertently shattered the boundary that normally keeps the

environment of a demoncyst from mixing with the outside world,

and thus created the River Eltar.

With Eltabs assistance, the Red Wizards routed the god-kings

army and established the nation of Thay. When Jorgmacdon real-

ized it was impossible to dismiss the demon lord, he imprisoned

him near the mouth of the River Eltar with a variant of the same

ritual that had been used by the Narfelli demonbinders nearly a

millennium before. The Red Wizards then built their new capitol

city, Eltabbar, in and around the canals that formed the massive

binding rune.

Centuries after Eltabs imprisonment beneath the Thayan

capitol city, Szass Tam realized that the demon lord would soon

break free. Instead of waiting for that to occur, in the Year of

the Shield (1367 DR) the lich released the Lord of the Hidden

Layer, in the process causing a major earthquake in Eltabbar.

Using the Death Moon Orb, an artifact acquired from the legend-

ary Larloch, the Zulkir of Necromancy compelled Eltab to sit in

Thakorsils seat, another artifact given to him by the Netherese

lich of Warlocks Crypt. Szass Tam hoped to permanently enslave

Eltab using an epic spell known as the ritual of twin burnings

in conjunction with the artifact-throne but, before Szass Tam

could weave all nine runes of chaos, adventurers foiled the lichs

plot, enabling Eltab to escape to a demoncyst, deep below the

Thaymount. Biding his time and recovering his strength, Eltab

began to slowly subvert servants of the Zulkir of Necromancy,

seeking to defeat his foe and re-conquer what he considered

rightfully his. Finally, in the Year of Rogue Dragons (1373 DR),

Eltab emerged from hiding and confronted Szass Tam but was

thwarted by the actions of Thazienne Uskevren, who seemingly

vanquished him after a great and terrible battle. In truth, Eltab

was magically transported to the Citadel of Conjurers in far-off

Impiltur by ancient bindings cast on him by wizards of Narfell

over one thousand years ago. There he is free to plot anew and

wander Faern unchecked, seeking his vengeance.

Eltabs Magic

Since his escape from the Red Wizards of Thay, Eltab has acquired

a potent array of magical items, many of them artifacts dating

back to the empire of Narfell and lost over fteen centuries ago.

Perhaps the most prominent of the items he has acquired is the

Moaning Crown of Ndulu, a wraithlike shadow of the legendary

Crown of Narfell.

Moaning Crown of Ndulu

In the Year of Visions (731 DR), the legendary paladin Sarshel

entered the Citadel of Conjurers (which lay near the Hill of Tombs)

and shattered the fabled Crown of Narfell. In so doing, he broke

Orcuss hold over the artifact and forced the army of demons

led by the balor Ndulu to retreat and scatter. Although Sarshel

gathered up the physical fragments of the headgear, the souls of

the long-dead Nentyarchs trapped within the crown quickly ed

their ancient prison in the form of powerful wraiths.

Over the next ve decades, Ndulu captured the crown-wraiths

one by one and brought them to his lair in the depths of the Earth-

fast Mountains. Calling on the power of the Prince of the Undead,

Ndulu forged the crown-wraiths into an incorporeal circlet of evil

and darkness. With the Moaning Crown of Ndulu on his brow,

so named for the endless wailing of the souls it had trapped anew,

Ndulu was able to reforge his army of succubi and glabrezu. In the

Year of the Moaning Gorge (786 DR), Ndulus army was met by

the great-grandsons of King Sarshel at the mouth of a gorge that

led deep into the Earthspurs, just outside the gates of the Citadel

of Conjurers. Employing three shieldsKimeltaar, Naelotaar,

and Dizeltaaarand the sword Demonbane, the Paladin Princes

formed a vortex portal and through it drove Ndulu and his horde

back into the Abyss.

In his nal act, Ndulu shattered two of the shieldsNaelotaar

and Dizeltaarand their shield-bearers, Essys and Araln. In his

wake, the balor left the Moaning Crown of Ndulu, for it could not

pass beyond this plane. Recognizing the Moaning Crown as the fell

echo of the Crown of Narfell, but unable to destroy it, Prince Nord

secretly carried it to the depths of the Citadel of Conjurers and

placed it amid the other Narfelli artifacts that lay therein. After

132

Champions of Evil

his sudden reappearance a tenday later, he had the court wizards of

Old Impiltur renew their wards on the site, and the Moaning Crown

of Ndulu is believed to remain within, forever locked away.

The Moaning Crown resembles an incorporeal circular cloud

of black smoke. It can be moved only by someone or something

capable of manipulating objects on the Ethereal Plane. (Prince Nord

carried it on the blade of Felthann, Crown Prince Essys sword

with the ghost touch property.) However, if somehow placed atop

the brow of a sentient creature, it remains rmly in place. Anyone

staring into the depths of the headpiece can discern tortured faces

swirling through the dark mists, and it is from their mouths that

the ever-present moaning emerges.

Physical contact with the Moaning Crown is equivalent to the

touch of a powerful crown-wraith, dealing 1d8 points of Constitu-

tion drain per round unless a DC 24 Fortitude save is made. (Most

bearers would require some form of negative energy protection to

safely wear the crown.) As its name suggests, the Moaning Crown

radiates a constant moaning. This is a magical sonic effect and can

be negated by magical silence. In nonevil creatures, this moaning

engenders the effect of an emotion (despair) spell, centered on the

wearer. In evil creatures, the effect is akin to a bards inspire great-

ness ability. Evil creatures within 30 feet of the crown-bearer who

can hear the moaning gain +2 HD (d10s that grant temporary hit

points), a +2 competence bonus on attacks, and a +1 competence

bonus on Fortitude saves. Three times per day, at the command

of the crown-bearer, the collective moaning of the crown-wraiths

can rise to the level of a terrifying scream, equal in effect to a

wail of the banshee spell.

Eltabs Fate

The fate of the Lord of the Hidden Layer is inextricably tied to

future events in eastern Faern. The various means of binding the

demon lord to ones will are recorded in a small number of tomes,

but such means have been discovered anew enough times to suggest

that Eltab will be a recurring inuence in the unfolding history

of the eastern Realms.

Removing Eltabs tie to the Realms (and thus breaking the

enduring ties between the Hidden Layer and the Demonlands

of the Easting Reach) would require a quest of epic scope. Eltabs

lair in the depths of the Citadel of Conjurers is unknown to all but

a handful of demons and cultists. Once it is learned that Eltab is

alive, understanding the nature of the Narfelli binding that ties

the Hidden Layer to Faern might require a trek into the depths

of the Castle of Alhanar to the Myrkulyte library guarded by

the Knights of the Undying Dragon or perusing the Demonsbane

Annals in the Vault of Sages in Silverymoon. The sword Hadryllis

was last seen in the hands of an incarnation of Anhur, and now lies

forgotten in the depths of the Blood Fortress of Sultim. Banishing

Eltab requires delving the depths of the Citadel of Conjurers once

again, defeating the demon lord and his minions, and shattering

the Adamantine Binding forged when Eltab was brought to this

world centuries ago.

Eltab is a 15-foot-tall, muscular humanoid creature with the head

of a muzzled beast. His body is covered with bony, dark red plates

and sprouts dozens of horns and antlers. His slitted eyes are narrow

and yellow, with glowing red irises.

Eltab speaks Abyssal, Celestial, Chondathan, Common, Dama-

ran, Dwarven, Mulhorandi, Rashemaar, and Nar.

Ordinarily archends such as Eltab do not grant spells, but he

might act as a patron for a cleric with the given domain, whether

or not the cleric worships a specic deity. Eltabs domains include

Chaos, DemonicBV, Evil, HatredPG, and RetributionPG.

Combat

Eltab loves to wade into melee combat against multiple foes, carving

into their ranks with his greatsword or tearing them asunder with

his claws and head spikes.

Eltabs natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields,

are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Death Gaze (Su): Death, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 39. The save is

Charisma-based.

Fear (Su): Eltab radiates a fear effect (Will DC 39 negates)

at will. The save is Charisma-based.

even spell completion magic items such

as wands and scrolls.

True Seeing (Su): Balors have a

continuous true seeing ability, as the

spell (caster level 20th).

Summon Demon (Sp): Once per day Eltab

can automatically summon 1d8 succubi, 1d6

glabrezu, or 1 balor. This ability is the

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Possessions: Moaning Crown of Ndulu

(see above), Stormsplitter (+5 keen shock

Thrall of Eltab

The thrall of Eltab has embraced the dark legacies of ancient

Narfell. He works to bring the lands once claimed by the Nentyarch

of Narfell under the rule of Eltab, in hopes of achieving a position

of some power as the demon lords lieutenant.

Thralls of Eltab often work in small groups, usually led by a

demon the group has found and liberated from a binding dating

back to the waning days of Narfell. A few thralls of Eltab

are solitary individuals, traitors within an organiza-

tion hated by Eltab who seek to betray their

fellows for personal gain. More than a

few Red Wizard conjurers have heeded

the whispers of Eltab and serve as the

demon lords eyes and ears within the

ruling hierarchy of Thay.

Becoming a

Thrall of Eltab

Clerics and thaumaturgists are most

commonly found as thralls of Eltab,

for their spells lend themselves

toward  working  with  demons,

unlike Nar demonbinders, sorcer-

ers, and wizards, whose spells lean

toward binding and commanding

demons, a practice Eltab detests.

Barbarians, blackguards, ghters,

rangers, and rogues also make

good  thralls  of  Eltab,  for  their

combat abilities blend naturally

with the abilities of this class.

Class Features

All the following are class features of the thrall of Eltab prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Prociency: A thrall of Eltab is procient

with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and

with shields.

Bonus Feat or Spells: When a thrall of Eltab attains 1st, 4th,

7th, and 10th level, the character gains new spells per day as if he

had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class he belonged

to before he added the prestige class, or else he gains a bonus feat

of his choice. If the thrall chooses +1 spellcasting level, he does not

gain any other benet a character of that class would have gained.

This essentially means that he adds the new level to the level of

whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before he

became a thrall of Eltab, he must decide to which class he adds

the level for purposes of determining spells per day.

A thrall of Eltab is free to choose the bonus feat at one oppor-

tunity and the spellcasting level the next time the decision arises,

or vice versa. Characters who are not spellcasters must choose the

bonus feat.

Bone Spurs (Ex): A 1st-level thrall of Eltab gains a profusion

of sharp bone spurs emerging from his skull, which provide a gore

attack. If the thrall does not already have this attack form, use the

appropriate damage value from the table below. Creatures that have

other kinds of gore attacks retain their old damage values or use

the appropriate value from the table below, whichever is better.

Scaly Flesh (Ex): A 1st-level thrall of Eltab gains dark red,

scaly esh, which provides a +1 natural armor bonus. At every

three levels beyond 1st (4th, 7th, and 10th), this bonus increases

by 1. The bonus from scaly esh stacks with that of natural armor

derived from creature type (if the thrall of Eltab is a lizardfolk

or troglodyte, for example), but not from magical sources such as

an amulet of natural armor.

Touch of Fear (Sp): Three times per day, a 2nd-level thrall of

Eltab can produce an effect identical to that of the cause fear spell

cast by a 10th-level caster.

Burrow (Ex): A 3rd-level thrall of Eltab can burrow at a speed

of 10 feet. If the creature can already burrow, this speed does not

stack.

Summon Demon (Sp): A 5th-level thrall of Eltab can summon

a demon of 5 HD or less once per day. This functions as a summon

monster spell cast by a 15th-level caster. Once per day, a 9th-level

thrall of Eltab can summon a demon of 10 HD or less.

Demoncyst Jump (Sp): Once per day, a 6th-level thrall of Eltab

can produce an effect identical to that of a teleport spell cast by

a 10th-level caster. This abilty can be employed only within a

demoncyst, and the target must lie within another demoncyst.

Off-target results arrive in the desired demoncyst, but not at the

desired location. Similar area results lead to a randomly chosen

demoncyst, somewhere in eastern Faern. Mishaps deposit the

thrall of Eltab on the 248th layer of the Abyss.

Death Gaze (Su): At 10th level, a thrall of Eltab gains a gaze

attack: death, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 10 + thralls class level + thralls

Cha bonus negates. The save is Charisma-based. If the target fails

its save, it dies.

Soneillon,

Queen of Whispers

The Queen of Whispers has haunted the nation of Impiltur

since the Battle of Moaning Gorge, although her central role

in Impilturs enduring troubles is a carefully hidden secret. This

former consort of Agrosh the Scaled, Ndulu, and the Archmage

Ferentier is a succubus from the Abyss who excels in the twin

arts of possession and corruption. She has contributed to the

fall of two royal houses in Impiltur and sown the seeds of civil

war in both Chondath and the Realm of the Sword and Wand.

Banished more than four centuries ago from the kingdom of

Impiltur, Soneillon now rules the hobgoblins of the Giantspires

from the shadows, and claims the death knight Imbrar Heltharn,

fallen king of Impiltur, as her undying prince-consort. However,

Soneillons desire for revenge against Impiltur remains unslaked,

and she continues to plot against its leadership.

Soneillons Lair

Soneillon is based in the depths of the Giantspire Mountains, having

claimed a long-plundered crypt of ancient Narfell as her lair, and its

twin thrones as her seat of power. The Queen of Whispers nominally

dwells therein, attended by the Fallen King of Impiltur and the

undead remnants of his Royal Guard, but, in practice, she spends

much of her time secretly lurking within the minds of mortals,

possessing crowns and other symbolic objects as she sows the seeds of

corruption. Soneillon is most often found possessing the Coronation

Crown of Aliia while it rests atop the brow of the most powerful

hobgoblin of the tribes of the Giantspire Mountains.

135

Champions of Evil

Soneillons Domain

Soneillon claims all the Giantspire Mountains as her domain,

having secretly proclaimed it to be the kingdom of Naratyr. The

Queen of Whispers does not rule Naratyr in open court, preferring

instead to whisper to the various hobgoblins chieftains from the

shadows. Soneillon seeks to regain the throne of Impiltur, which

she held briey centuries ago before being banished forever from

the realm by Soargar, then the Archmage of Lyrabar.

Deeds of Soneillon

For centuries, the Giantspire Mountains, which today form the

border between the Kingdom of Damara and the tribal lands

of Narfell, have been home to bugbears, hill giants, ogres, stone

giants, and countless hobgoblins. Although long considered a deadly

nuisance, the eternally-warring tribes of hobgoblins did not begin

to pose a signicant threat to neighboring realms until the Year of

the Dawndance (1095 DR). However, the roots of their emergence

stretch back nearly four centuries before that date.

In the 600s DR, Impilturan settlers began settling the Great

Dale, inadvertently unleashing the fell legacies of ancient Narfell

buried beneath the forest oor. Once again, demons, half-ends,

and tieings began to plague the region. West of the Easting Reach,

ends began inltrating the ruling strata of the Impilturan court,

while others mustered armies under the command of the balor

Ndulu. Once unleashed in the Year of the Dowager Lady (726

DR), the armies of ends quickly brought Impiltur to its knees.

On the eastern shores of the Easting Reach, the lack of organized

resistance (outside of Milvarn) allowed individual ends to rampage

unchecked through what is now Thesk.

Among the ends released during the blazing of the Great Dale

was a succubus named Soneillon. Some scholars specializing in the

study of ends claim this is not her true name, but the name of

a female demon lord, whose guise she has assumed. The Queen of

Whispers, as the consort of Agrosh the Scaled styled herself, was

instrumental in engineering the fall of the Durlarven dynasty, but

her reign as queen of Impiltur was short-lived. In the Year of the

Twisted Horn (729 DR), Agrosh, the half-end offspring of Eltab,

the Lord of the Hidden Layer, was slain by Belthar Garshin, a

paladin of Torm, at the Battle of Horned Heads; Soneillon nar-

rowly escaped with her life.

The Queen of Whispers spent the next ve decades skulking

about Impiltur, serving as favored consort and chief spy of Ndulu,

the balor general of the demon horde. Just before the Battle of

Moaning Gorge (786 DR), she assumed the guise of Prince Nords

mistress and nearly succeeded in subverting his will. However,

Prince Nord resisted her insidious attacks and had her imprisoned

beneath his keep. As such, Soneillon escaped the fate of Ndulu

and his host of demons, who were banished back to the Abyss. In

the immediate aftermath of the battle, while Nord plumbed the

depths of the Citadel of Conjurers, Soneillon managed to escape,

engulng her captors keep in ames in the process.

Soneillon spent the next century-and-a-half in Chondath, playing

the role of consort to Archmage Whinonas Ferentier of Hlath.

There she sowed the seeds of corruption that came to fruition in

the Rotting War that ended in the Year of Queens Tears (902

DR), when Whinonas released the evil magics of ancient Netheril.

During the wars last battle on the Fields of Nun, Soneillon was

seen itting from one dying warrior to the next, whispering nal

torments in their ears and delighting in the suffering.

In the wake of the Rotting War, the Queen of Whispers

returned to Impiltur, armed with knowledge of all manner of

magical plagues. In the Year of the Spouting Fish (922 DR),

Soneillon unleashed the magics of the Tortoiscab Plague on the

royals of House Elethlim. Over the next two years, the descendants

of Sarshel fell victim to Talonas touch one by one, until only

Princess Aliia remained. Two years later, the Queen of Whispers

struck again, possessing the ship Nadyras Glory as it sailed from

Hlammach to Tsurlagol and forcing it to dive into the depths. As

the ship was en route to Suzail, delivering Princess Aliia to her

wedding, its sinking marked the last chapter of House Elethim,

the end of Impilturs Golden Age, and the beginning of the era

known as the Kingless Years.

In the wake of Aliias death, Soneillon returned to Impiltur to

nally reclaim her throne. She spent the next decade whispering

dark promises in the ears of Impilturs patriarchs, inciting the

realms noble houses and cities into civil war. With the kingdom

in chaos and those that might oppose her wracked by feuds,

only the efforts of Soargar, Archmage of Lyrabar, prevented

the Queen of Whispers from desecrating the Crown of Narfell

and claiming it as her own. The former Mage Royal of Impiltur

crafted a spell that forever banished Soneillon from the lands

claimed by Impiltur, and the civil war, sparked by Soneillons

whispers, nally subsided.

Soneillon ed north to the abandoned gnome mining tunnels

beneath the Rawlinswood, and from there she made her way north

into the Giantspires. In the decades that followed, the Queen of

Whispers slowly formulated a plan to exact her revenge on the

Realm of the Sword and Wand. One by one, the succubus seduced

the various hobgoblin tribal chiefs of the region, binding them to her

will, until she had knit the primitive humanoids into an army and

realm capable of challenging the might of shattered Impiltur.

In the Year of the Dawndance (1095 DR), the Queen of Whis-

pers sent her army through the Rawlinswood tunnels to muster

on the northern border of Impiltur. From there, the hobgoblin

horde swept into northern Impiltur, leaving only their banished

queen behind. Imphras Heltharn, War-Captain of Lyrabar, with

the aid of Soargar, united the city-states of Lyrabar, Hlammach,

Dilpur, and Sarshel, the elves of the Grey Forest, and the dwarves

of the Earthfast Mountains into an army capable of holding off

the hobgoblins. After a terrible struggle, the host of Impiltur was

driven back to the shores of Bluefang Water in the uplands of

Impiltur. There Soargar, the young sorceress Sambral, the visiting

archmage Velgarbrin of Baldurs Gate, and the folk of Impiltur

and its allies routed the hobgoblin horde.

Frustrated once again, the Queen of Whispers retreated to

the Giantspires to rebuild her armies and plot her next attack.

Meanwhile, in Impiltur, Imphras was crowned king, having learned

136

Champions of Evil

Imbrar trains his hobgoblin armies in preparation for a future

invasion, should Impilturs defenders ever lower their guard, the

Queen of Whispers plots from the shadows anew. The succubus

has learned to whisper in the minds of Impilturs rulers from

afar, circumventing Soargars prohibition, and has corrupted

more than one royal of House Heltharn with thoughts of power.

Those who have succumbed to her whispered promises of absolute

power include Prince-Consort Rilaun, King Lashilmbrar, Prince

Thaum, Crown Prince Imphras IV, and at least two of the Lords

of  Imphras  II  who  administer

the realm today. In many ways,

Soneillon has unleashed far more

horrors on mighty Impiltur than

the legendary Ndulu ever did, and

her vengeance remains unslaked.

Soneillons

Magic

Over the centuries, the Queen

of Whispers has acquired an

array of magical items, many

of  them  of  great  historical

import, which she now regards

as  the  regalia  of  Naratyr.

When Imbrar rose as a death

knight, she allowed him to

keep his Impilturan regalia,

so he, too, is suitably attired

in the fashion of a power-

ful monarch. Three items of

particular  historial  interest

are discussed below, and others

are  mentioned  in  the  list  of

possessions of each monarch of

Naratyr.

Coronation Crowns of

Aliia and Rhiigard

The Coronation Crowns of Aliia and Rhiigard were crafted in

the Year of the Fearless Peasant (926 DR) and packed aboard the

Nadyras Glory, along with many other treasures of the realm that

were being sent to Cormyr. After scuttling the bridal ship, Soneillon

kept the crowns as symbols of her eventual rightful rule of Impiltur,

and they now serve as the royal crowns of Naratyr.

The Coronation Crown of Rhiigard usually sits on the brow of

Prince-Consort Imbrar; he even wears it into battle. It is an ornate,

almost gaudy, crown, fashioned of gold and adorned with countless

jewels. The Coronation Crown of Aliia usually lies on Soneillons

throne, although the Queen of Whispers wears it whenever she

manifests in physical form. This crown is often loaned out to

the most powerful hobgoblin among the tribes of the Giantspires.

It too is an ornate crown, fashioned of platinum and also adorned

from the dying Soargar where lay the Crown of Narfell and ve

score fabled blades of the Realm. Imphras I was succeeded by

his son Imbrar in the Year of Rose Pearls (1122 DR). Imbrars

younger sister, Princess Ilmara, became a sorceress under Mhilra

of Milvarune and found the Scrying Stones of Myth Drannor.

Ilmara then founded Ilmwatch, to guard against the return of

the hobgoblins.

In the Year of the Luminar Procession (1127 DR), the ever-

vigilant Ilmara saw the hobgoblins stirring

in one of the Scrying Stones and

alerted her brother to the looming

threat. Instead of mustering his

army on the northern border of the

realm and inciting the hobgoblins

to come out onto the plains, King

Imbrar foolishly marched north

into the mountains, accompanied

only by his Royal Guard, who bore

the blades that were collectively

known as Soargars Legacy.

This had been Soneillons

ploy all along, for her armies

were still too weak to confront

Impilturs defenders directly.

Although Imbrar and his

Royal Guard fought valiantly,

they were no match for the

Queen of Whispers and her

minions on their own turf.

One by one they fell, as they

ed through the treacherous

mountain passes, until only

Imbrar remained. Undone by

his pride and dreams of valor,

Imbrar realized he had squandered

Soargars Legacy and broken the

faith of his subjects. The Queen

of Whispers captured him alive,

and  the  brokenhearted  king  was

then subjected to a stream of torments, until nally his will and

faith in the Triad broke as he drew his nal breath. To Soneillons

delight, the fallen king of Impiltur then arose as a death knight

and servant to her will.

In the two and a half centuries since Ilmara donned the Crown

of Narfell, the Queen of Whispers and her undead prince-consort

have ruled the Giantspires from the shadows, hidden behind the

throne of the reigning hobgoblin monarch. Although Soargar

banished Soneillon from Impiltur, he did not recognize the threat

she would continue to pose to the realm and breathed his last before

he could mention her existence to anyone else. However, his long-

lost notes might detail some of what he learned about the Queen

of Whispers, should they someday come to light.

Soneillon calls her realm Naratyr, in homage to the terrible

city of her patron, Orcus, Demon Prince of the Undead. While

materials alone.

Each of the Coronation Crowns has earned the sobriquet of

the Crown of Whispers and acquired the reputation of a fell

magical artifact among the hobgoblins of the Giantspires. However,

despite the legends that surround them, both simply enhance the

Charisma of their bearers (as a cloak of charisma +4). The reason

behind their reputation is that both crowns are favorite targets

of Soneillons object possession ability, and she often whispers to

whomevers head her crown bestrides.

Greatsword of Impiltur

Commissioned to mark the coronation of Sarshel Elethim as king

of Impiltur and forged by the dwarves of Earthfast, the Greatsword

of Impiltur was not completed until the Year of the Splendid Stag

(734 DR), during the early days of the reign of Halanter I. The

blade served as Halanters ceremonial sword of state from the time

of its dedication until the Year of the Missing Blade (759 DR),

when it vanished from the royal vaults along with several other

treasures of the realm. Rumors at the time attributed the blades

theft to an agent of Ndulu, the balor general who was known

to have survived the Fiend Wars. However, the Greatsword of

Impiltur was not among the treasures seized in the aftermath

of the Battle of Moaning Gorge twenty-seven years later, casting

some doubt on this theory.

In the Year of Wolfpacks (826 DR), Eljak Ferenfal, the Horned

Ranger, spent the latter half of the winter hunting a pack of winter

wolves across the ice-bound Bluefang Water. During the course of

his relentless pursuit, Eljak stumbled across the mauled and frozen

corpse of a Rashemi berserker trapped in the ice. Although the

body was clad in simple hide armor and carried nothing else of any

worth, the warriors scabbard held an impressive greatsword, later

identied as Impilturs long-missing sword of state. At winters end,

Eljak presented both the Greatsword of Impiltur and a cloak made

from the pelt of the winter-wolf pack leader to King Halanter II,

and both were placed in the royal vaults with the kings heartfelt

thanks.

In the Year of the Fearless Peasant (926 DR), the Greatsword

of Impiltur was lost en route to Cormyr, during the sinking of

the Nadyras Glory, along with Princess Aliia and many treasures

of the realm. Thus, it is one of the few royal blades of Impiltur

that is not included in the ve-score swords collectively known as

Soargars Legacy. Soneillon recovered the blade from the depths

of the Inner Sea, along with the Coronation Crowns of Aliia and

Rhiigard, and eventually bore it back to her court in the depths

of the Giantspire Mountains. The great blade then passed to a

succession of hobgoblin champions until the Year of the Luminar

Procession (1127 DR), when Soneillon reclaimed the blade and

gave it to her newly risen undead servant, Prince-Consort Imbrar

Heltharn, who has wielded it ever since.

Forged of cold iron, the Greatsword of Impiltur is a +2 ravenous

doomstrike greatsword. The blade is engraved with images of dead

and wailing demons, and the pommel is carved in the shape of a

balor whose torso has been pierced by the blade.

Soneillons Fate

Having survived the fall of Narfell, sparked civil wars in Impiltur

and Chondath, and precipitated the fall of two royal houses in

Realm of the Sword and Wand, Soneillon has proven herself a

cunning survivor and insidious opponent. Her power, however,

comes from her ability to scheme from the shadows, not con-

front foes directly. Should she ever be unmasked, the paladins

of Impiltur would undoubtedly destroy her, or at least drive her

back to the Abyss.

The fate of Soneillons prince-consort, Imbrar Heltharn, is less

certain. Eventually, he must march his hobgoblin legions back

into Impiltur, where he is almost certain to be defeatedunless

the Queen of Whispers has corrupted enough of his opponents

to shatter the might of Impilturs defenders.

Class Abilities: Soneillons class abilities are too numerous and

lengthy to repeat in detail. See the Fiend Folio, pages 202212.

Her Leadership score is 36. Her cohort is Imbrar. Her followers

are NE/CE hobgoblins (660/66/33/17/9/5/3/2/1), all placed in

positions of authority among the hobgoblin tribes.

Alternate Form (Su): Soneillon can assume any humanoid form

of Small to Large size as a standard action. This ability is similar

to the polymorph self spell but allows only humanoid forms.

While using this ability, Soneillon gains a +10 circumstance

bonus on Disguise checks.

138

Energy Drain (Su): Soneillon drains energy from a mortal

she lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss

on the victim. If the target is not willing to be kissed, she must

start a grapple, which provokes attacks of opportunity. Her kiss

or embrace bestows one negative level; the victim must succeed

on a DC 15 Wisdom check to even notice. The Fortitude save to

remove the negative level has a DC of 18.

Summon  Tanarri  (Sp):

Once per day, Soneillon can

attempt to summon one balor, with

a 10% chance of success. When

to summon Ndulu, because he

delights in the opportunity to

return to the Demonlands

and temporarily assuage his

appetite for revenge.

Telepathy (Su): Soneillon

can communicate telepathi-

cally  with  any  creature

within 100 feet that has

a language.

Tongues (Su): So-

neillon has a permanent tongues

Dark Blessing (Su): Imbrar applies his Charisma modier

(normally +5, +7 with Coronation Crown of Rhiigard) as a bonus

on all saving throws.

Detect Good (Sp): At will, Imbrar can use detect good as a

spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the detect good spell.

Fear Aura (Su): Imbrar is shrouded in a dreadful aura of

death and evil. Creatures of less than 5 HD within 15 feet of

139

Champions of Evil

Imbrar must succeed on a DC 26 Will save or be affected as

though by a fear spell cast by a 16th-level sorcerer.

Smite Good (Su): Imbrar adds his Charisma modier (nor-

mally +5, +7 with Coronation Crown of Rhiigard) to his attack

roll and deals an extra 10 points of damage when using this

ability. For example, Imbrar armed with a greatsword would

deal 2d6+10 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses

from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If

he accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has

no effect but it is still used up for that day.

Summon Mount (Su): Imbrar has the ability to summon a

mount, typically an advanced 8 HD nightmare, though it can

be any other kind of creature normally used as a mount. The

mount can have no more than 8 HD. If the mount is lost or

killed, Imbrar can summon another one after a year and a day.

Turn Immunity (Su): Imbrar cannot be turned. He can be

banished with holy word, however, just as if he were an evil

outsider. (Imbrar would return to the Abyss, specically to the

domain of Orcus.)

Undead Followers: Imbrar is attended by the undead remnants

of his Royal Guard, four of whom survive as huecavas. Each

huecava carries one of the ve-score blades of Soargars Legacy.

These creatures are in addition to any undead creatures that

Imbrar can rebuke.

Undead Traits: Imbrar is immune to mind-affecting spells

and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, necromantic effects, and any effect that requires a For-

titude save unless it also work on objects. Imbrar is not subject

to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability

damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from massive

damage. Imbrar cannot be raised, and resurrection works only

if Imbrar is willing. Imbrar has darkvision out to 60 feet.

Climate/Terrain: The Fugue Plane

Organization: Solitary

Challenge Rating: 26

Treasure: None

Alignment: Neutral evil

Advancement: 

Dendar the Night Serpent is a vile elder evil as old as the world

itself. She roams the Fugue Plane, devouring the nightmares

of the living, and looking forward to the day when she has

collected enough of the fears of humankind to initiate the end

of the world.

Combat

Dendar prefers to confront attackers head-on, using her awesome

bite attack and nightmare venom to incapacitate a single combatant

at a time. She prefers to target spellcasters rst, since her nightmare

scales can eliminate or severely weaken melee ghters before she

nishes them off. She often just slithers over creatures in her path,

crushing them under her awesome weight. Dendar tries not to kill

her opponents, preferring to put them into an endless sleep with

her venom so that she can feed upon their nightmares forever.

Dendar does not need to worry about most mortal challengers,

and it would take a concerted effort by several of the most powerful

angels, demons, or devils to give her pause. Should she ever nd

her opponents actually damaging her, she would not hesitate to

unleash the nightmares from her gizzard in an attempt to trap

her attackers inside their greatest fears forever.

Crush (Ex): As a standard action, Dendar can jump, roll, or

slither onto her opponents, using her whole body to crush them.

She can crush creatures of Large size or smaller, up to as many

140

Champions of Evil

as will t under her gigantic body. Creatures crushed by the Night

Serpent take 4d8+28 points of bludgeoning damage and must at-

tempt a DC 45 Reex save. Failure means the creature is pinned

beneath her body, automatically taking crush damage each round

the pin is maintained.

Ignore Armor (Ex): Dendars incredibly sharp fangs pierce any

armor as if it were paper. Not even the most powerful magic armor

protects against her vicious bites; as a result, do not count armor

and natural armor bonuses when determining an opponents AC

against the Night Serpents bite attacks.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Dendar must hit with

her bite attack. She can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Nightmare Scales (Su): Anyone striking the Night Serpent in

melee combat causes one of her scales to y off. Each scale contains

a consumed nightmare, which is unleashed on the character in the

form of a nightmare spell (DC 26).

Nightmare Venom (Ex): Anyone struck by Dendars bite

attack must succeed on a DC 53 Fortitude save or fall into a coma.

While in this state, the character is assailed by a constant stream

of his worst nightmares. The only way to recover a character in

this state is through the use of a wish or miracle spell, and even

then the character must succeed on a DC 53 Will save or take

1d4 points of Wisdom drain from the horrible lucid nightmares

he has experienced.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdream, fear (DC 25), nightmare

(DC 26), plane shift, shadow conjuration (DC 25), and shadow

evocation (DC 26). Caster level 30th. The save DCs are Charisma-

based and include a +4 racial bonus.

Swallow Whole (Ex): When Dendar begins her turn with a

grappled opponent in her mouth, she can swallow that opponent

with a successful grapple check. Once inside, a creature takes

2d10+28 points of bludgeoning damage per round from her

muscular contractions. There are worse things inside the Night

Serpents gizzard, however.

The undigested nightmares of thousands of souls reside within

Dendars belly. Anyone trapped within is automatically assailed by

these nightmares 1d6 times per round as if they had struck her

in combat (the Will save is affected as if Dendar had one of the

characters body parts).

There are two ways to escape this nightmare prison. The rst is

to deal at least 100 points of damage to the Night Serpents gizzard

with a light slashing or piercing weapon (her gizzard has an AC of

27). Once a creature has escaped in this way, muscular action closes

the hole; other swallowed creatures must cut their own way out.

The second method of escape is under Dendars control. If she ever

uses her unleash nightmares ability with a creature in her gizzard,

the creature is automatically expelled along with the nightmares,

suffering the nightmare attack along with all others in the area of

effect (and possibly nding its way right back into her belly).

Dendars interior can hold 2 Gargantuan, 4 Huge, 8 Large, 32

Medium, 128 Small, 512 Tiny, 2,048 Diminutive, or 8,192 Fine

or smaller opponents.

True Seeing (Su): Dendar the Night Serpent continuously uses

this ability, as the spell (caster level 30th).

Unleash Nightmares (Su): The Night Serpent can cause any

being on any plane to relive her worst nightmare. Unless the

creature succeeds at a DC 26 Will save, she goes completely insane.

This insanity can be cured only by a limited wish, miracle, or wish

spell. Dendar can unleash this ability as a breath weapon in combat

once every 1d4 rounds as well, although she is loathe to do so since

it delays the end of the world just that much longer. If she does so,

all creatures within a 100-foot cone must make the saving throw,

and those that fail are carried by their own nightmares into the

Night Serpents belly, in addition to being driven insane.

History

Some say that Dendar the Night Serpent was created the rst

time a mortal creature had a dream. They believe that she was

created to be the dreams opposite, and that had the rst mortal

had a nightmare instead, a beautiful creature of goodness and light

would now roam the Gray Waste, swallowing good dreams rather

than nightmares. Debate rages on whether or not this fate would

have been better for the world. Since her creation, Dendar has been

devouring the nightmares of mortals, gathering them in her gullet

where they swim in an eternal miasma of fear and hatred. She takes

pleasure in swallowing the fears of mortals and immortals alike,

particularly enjoying the fancies of kings and gods.

The Night Serpent is said to be the harbinger of the end of

the world, so that when she has swallowed enough nightmares, she

will come forth from her lair to douse all of existence in darkness

and fear. Even the gods will be unable to stop her, because they are

subject to the same nightmares as the mortals who serve them. A

sect of plane-hopping clerics and monks of Kelemvor (formerly

Myrkul) believe that it is their sacred duty to stop this from hap-

pening. They train every generation to hunt the Night Serpent on

her plane, forcing her to expend precious nightmares in defense

of her lair and her life. Although these religious fanatics know

that they go to their deaths when they move against Dendar, they

believe that they are vital to the continued existence of Faern and

its people.

Dendar has been known by many names throughout the ages.

Different civilizations have different uses for a legendary creature

that swallows nightmares in an attempt to bring about the end of

the world. The ancient Rus called her Nidhogg, and believed that

she would gnaw the roots of the world tree that connects all things,

until it could no longer survive. The people of Calimport believe

that she is the mother of the Night Parade, although this is not

true. And in Chult, the followers of Ubtao believe that Dendar

lives underneath the Peaks of Flame, and that she will emerge

through a massive iron door to devour the sun.

Although she sometimes slithers across the endish planes,

Dendar is content to spend most of her time in her lair, contentedly

gorged on the worlds unremembered nightmares. She lives in a

vast cave near the river that surrounds the Fugue Plane, and the

hiss of her breathing echoes throughout that plane as she sleeps.

She is automatically aware of any creature that approaches her

cave, and she awakens in order to savor the taste of their worst

nightmares before she destroys them.

Appearance

The Night Serpent appears as a 300-foot-long serpent with scales

that range in color from midnight black to deep green. These

scales represent the physical embodiment of the nightmares that

she has swallowed over the millennia. Her slit-pupiled eyes are the

sickly yellow-black of rotten eggs, and her forked tongue ickers

incessantly over her smooth lips. Dendars mouth unhinges at the

jaw to reveal a maw large enough to swallow a dragon without

trouble. She has four jagged fangs that sink deep into the esh of

her enemies, injecting a nightmare venom that slowly works to

destroy their minds. Her tongue is a weapon, too, able to knock

giants from their feet with a single swipe and entangle bitten foes

so she can swallow them whole. Beneath her tongue is a viscous

pit of greasy spittle and the bones of enemies past. She secretes

the essence of nightmares that she has devoured, and constantly

regurgitates the souls of those she has destroyed.

Dendar the Night Serpent

in Your Campaign

The Time of Troubles was more than just a time when the gods

walked the land. It was also a formidable recruiting tool for apoca-

lyptic cults everywhere. As the gods died right before the eyes of

ordinary Faernians, it began to seem as if the entire world might

be in peril. Even though things have calmed and the reorganized

pantheon has begun to rebuild its base, gods continue to disappear

(the recent upheaval in the Underdark because of Lolths disap-

pearance is a prime example), while others war for dominion of

the various aspects of existence. This was the perfect time for the

cults of Dendar the Night Serpent to make great gains in both

numbers and resources.

Cults revolving around Dendar are active across Faern, but

the two largest and most devoted can be found in Calimport and

the Jungles of Chult. In Calimport, the Sacred Order of Akabar

recruits thieves, assassins, and other skulks to fulll their twisted

purpose. This order of fanatics believes that Dendar the Night

Serpent is the mother of the Night Parade, a congregation of

demonic creatures that oversaw a reign of terror in Calimport

in 1359 DR. Their appearance in the year after the Time of

Troubles only reinforced their conclusion that the Serpent

Mother was preparing for the end of the world. Since that time,

they have made it their single-minded goal to feed Dendar enough

nightmares to bring about Faerns destruction, at which time

they expect to rule over the remaining planes of existence as the

Serpent Mothers chosen people. They do so by kidnapping and

drugging the dregs of Calimport society, who are kept in a secret

142

Champions of Evil

chamber and feed Dendar with an endless string of poison- and

narcotics-induced nightmares.

The other large group of Dendar-related cultists can be found

in the Jungles of Chult, hidden among the caves below the Peaks

of Flame. Unlike the Sacred Order of Akabar, these cultists are

bent on preventing the Night Serpent from destroying the world.

They believe that they are the guardians of an enormous iron door

through which Dendar will one day slither and attempt to eat the

sun. The Spearbearers of Ubtao, as they call themselves, believe

that they must maintain a long list of rituals in order to give their

god the strength to defeat Dendar when she nally hungers for

the light of the world. Many of these rituals require the sacrice

of sentient life, however, leading the Spearbearers to commit evil

acts in the of saving the world.

Caverns of the Serpent Mother

Hidden beneath the sands of the Calim Desert and connected

to a hideout in the city of Calimport, some twelve miles away,

the caverns of the Serpent Mother are the secret stronghold of

the Sacred Order of Akabar. It is here that the Order tends to its

growing herd of victims, who spend weeks or even months at a

time in a comalike state, feeding nightmares to Dendar the Night

Serpent. The entire operation is run by Ali Kumara, a godless priest

of Dendar who actually receives his spells from Cyric, although he

does not know it. He employs a variety of cutthroats, degenerates,

and true believers who are loyal to him because of either their

fanaticism or the gold he lavishes freely upon them.

A. Road to Calimport

This tunnel winds beneath the sands of the Calim Desert, eventually

coming to a small cavern hidden beneath a merchants warehouse

in Calimport. The tunnel is smooth and well ventilated, making

it perfect for transporting newly kidnapped victims to the sleep-

ing chamber beyond. Two ruts can be detected in the oor of the

tunnel, where the sled used to transport unconscious prisoners has

worn away the soft earth oor.

The sandy oor is well worn and covered with visible human

tracks, as well as the paw prints of a tiger the group has trained to

pull the sled. When the tiger is present in the caverns, its roar can

often be heard echoing through the tunnel, even miles away.

B. Serpents Gorge

This seemingly bottomless crevice cuts directly across the tunnel,

and hissing winds can be heard blowing in its depths. In reality, it

descends nearly a mile and contains nothing more than stale air

and thousands of years of loose rock and sand at the bottom. The

Sacred Order uses this crevice as a natural defense, and they have

constructed a drawbridge that ts into grooves cut into both sides

of the pit. When it is drawn up, the bridge can be wheeled over to

a wall where it is out of the way or it can be tilted down to provide

cover for those on the cavern side.

143

Champions of Evil

C. Guard Chamber (EL 7 or EL 12)

Just on the other side of the gorge is a small cavern that houses

any Sacred Order members that are here. Ali typically keeps four

members of the cult here at all timesa poisoner, a mage, and

two toughs. The tigers cage is also here, but the tiger itself is

normally kept in a bazaar in Calimport. If the tiger is here, that

means victims have been brought within the last 24 hours and

there will be additional guards and Order members around.

Encounter (EL 7): Human rogue 5/assassin 1, human wizard

3, human ghter 1 (2).

Encounter (EL 12): As above plus human expert 7, human

rogue 2 (4), tiger.

D. Sleeper Cavern

The cavern here is incredibly large and riddled by sharp stone

formations on the oor and the ceiling. Several beds are scattered

throughout the room, either carved from the stone of the cavern or

made from piles of clothing and straw on the open oor. Motionless

men and women can be found on most of the beds, put to sleep

by the drugs of the Sacred Order and made to play their worst

nightmares over and over again in their minds. They are kept here

for days or even weeks, depending on the poisoners assessment of

their health (and thus their ability to handle repeated dosages of

the drug). At any one time, between ten and twenty-ve sleepers

are here, all under the effects of the Sacred Orders drug. There

is a 25% chance that the poisoner will be here, checking on his

wards at any time of the day or nightotherwise, all the caverns

occupants are in the guard chamber.

An elevated shelf along the northwestern wall holds the Sacred

Orders supply of drugs, as well as food and water for those housed

here. It is set back into the stone and free of torchlight, making a

cool, dark storage area for both the food and the sensitive leaves

from which the drug is brewed. Ali has set a magical trap as a last

line of defense against intruders who would steal or destroy this

essential part of his plans to aid the Night Serpent. Anyone who

passes the threshold of the inset cavern without a sacred mark of

the Mother Serpent conjures ve serpents into being, each made of

pure force. They attack any living creature in the area and attack

like weapons from a spiritual weapon spell in all ways.

A dozen small tunnels lead away from this room into the

Underdark; no activity has ever been seen in any of them.

Player Characters and

Dendar the Night Serpent

The cults of Dendar the Night Serpent have been spreading quickly

over the past twenty years, so its quite possible that any or all of

the player characters in a group have had some contact with one

cell or another. Indeed, its possible that a character might have

grown up within the cult and to this day believe that the ancient

prophecies are soon to be fullled. Such individuals have every

reason to adventure, gathering gold and magic to aid the cult in

their mission.

With their recent expansion and increase in activity, the

Night Serpent cults make for good employers as well. They are in

constant search for artifacts and relics of their unholy mistress,

many of which have been scattered across the various planes that

she sometimes roams.

Kezef the Chaos Hound, the Ravager of Heavens, is a putrid

creature made of pure hatred that roams the Outer Planes eating

the souls of the faithful.

Combat

Kezef prefers to begin combat by howling to confuse and separate

his opponents. He follows up with a blast of his acidic breath weapon

before wading into melee combat, crunching sinew and bone with

his powerful bite. He does not fear melee because the maggots that

form his body can part to avoid blows as well as splash his enemies

with scalding slime. He does not normally ght while invisible,

since he enjoys the terror his form causes other creatures. He will

go invisible against opponents that have the capability to damage

him, and he will not hesitate to retreat via teleport or plane shift

in order to save his hide.

Acidic Bite (Ex): Kezefs acidic saliva deals an additional 1d10

points of acid damage every time he bites an opponent.

Breath Weapon (Su): 30-ft. cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage

2d20 acid, Reex DC 34 half. Any creature that fails its save takes

2d20 points of damage the following round as well, as the acid eats

its way through its esh. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Corrosion (Ex): Kezefs esh bubbles and roils with acid-spewing

maggots; any creature that strikes Kezef in melee combat causes an

acidy cloud to explode outward from his body. Unless the creature

makes a successful DC 34 Reex save, he is splashed by burning

slime that causes 1d12 points of damage per round until wiped

away. A character can take a full-round action that provokes attacks

of opportunity to remove all of the slime from his body.

This same acid is found in pools where Kezef stands on the

ground. It is not left while he is running or incorporeal, but only

where he actually touches the ground. The acidic pools last for 24

hours before burning off into empty holes (except where they are

magically preserved; see the Death Shallows entry below).

Extinguish (Ex): All nonmagical res within 60 feet of

the Chaos Hound are extinguished as soon as he moves into

range due to the fetid, oxygen-deprived breath he spews from

his slavering maw.

Flawless Tracker: The Chaos Hound can designate a single

individual as his prey, and thereafter will never fail to catch

the creatures trail. As soon as he designates his prey, he knows

the preys birthplace and can use his plane shift and teleport

without error abilities to go there. Thereafter he can use these

abilities to follow the creatures emotional scent, even tracking

the entire fabric of their lives until he catches up with them

at the present time. He does all of this with amazing speed,

once tracking four years of Kelemvors life in just one hour.

Once Kezef picks up a creatures scent, it is impossible to hide

from him. He can track across worlds and planes as easily as a

hunter tracks a bleeding deer.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willair walk, improved invisibility,

plane shift (DC 20), teleport without error*. Caster level 30th.

The Chaos Hound does not use teleport without error in the

conventional sense, but he becomes an insubstantial ghost and runs

with near-limitless speed. While in this state he can run across or

through any substance or barrier, and moves as fast as he likes, often

moving between two points as if he had teleported. When in this

form, he is perceived as a ghostly blur that leaves behind a lingering

scent of decay and a vague dread of darkened corners and howling

in the night. Spells that prevent teleportation, such as dimensional

anchor, do not prevent Kezef from using this ability.

Superior Initiative: Kezef has a +10 racial bonus on initiative

checks, and is always considered to have rolled a 20 on his initiative

check. In addition, he can never be surprised.

Terrifying Howl (Su): The Chaos Hound is so named for his

terrifying howl that causes panic and confusion to all who hear it.

Kezef can howl as a standard action, and all creatures within 100

feet must make a DC 29 Will save or suffer from confusion for

2d6 rounds. Even if a character makes this save, a second DC 29

Will save must be made or else he runs away in panic as if hit by

a fear spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

History

Kezef the Chaos Hound, the Ravager of Heavens, is as old as

Faern itself, although some believe that the god Jergal created

him to deny the other gods the souls of their followers. It is

said that Jergal created the Chaos Hound in a t of madness

when he realized that, though he held sway over death and the

dead, the souls of the Faithful went to live with their respec-

tive godsnot with him. He unleashed this terrible evil to

punish the mortals and gods alike, whom he saw as usurping

his domains. It is thought that the backlash from this moment

of rage is what caused him to divide his portfolio among Bane,

Bhaal, and Myrkul, and his willingness to do penance for the

145

Champions of Evil

that the time will come when they will be forced to deal with

his threat again.

Appearance

The Ravager of Heavens appears to be a huge mastiff whose esh

crawls ceaselessly across his body. Upon closer inspection, the creature

can be more accurately seen as a jet-black skeleton covered by millions

of bloated maggots that crawl and squirm as they wait for their next

meal. He searches for the Faithful with malevolent red eyes, and his

jaws drip with the secreted essence of a thousand souls. The maggots

that make up his esh and sinew ooze yellow-green pus at all times;

this pus is left in swirling pools wherever the Chaos Hound goes, as

his gigantic paws burn prints into the ground. His teeth ash like

obsidian daggers as he snarls at his prey.

The Chaos Hounds blood is a corrosive ooze, and he radiates

a pestilent aura of decay. His reek can be detected for miles, and

lingers for days upon his passing. Demons and paraelementals are

often spawned from the pools of ichor he leaves behind. His breath

stinks of hatred and lost souls, and it extinguishes nearby res by

smothering them in its stench.

When the Chaos Hound feeds upon a soul, the maggots from his

body swarm out like bees and feast upon the souls essence. Gorged

and bloated, they y back to the hound and reattach, causing him

to look fat and agitated. When he speaks, his voice resonates in a

low, rumbling growl.

creation of the Chaos Hound keeps him servile to the god of

death to this day.

Kezef roams the Outer Planes devouring the souls of the

Faithful before they can reunite with the gods in their respective

planes. He nds their taste intoxicating, and does not discriminate

between the gods when he feasts. The souls of the Faithless and the

False are disgusting to him, as is the esh of living beings, which

is why he rampages across Faern from time to time, leaving a

wake of destruction and devoured souls. Any souls devoured by

Kezef are truly and forever destroyed, beyond even the reach of

the gods to restore.

This terrible being was imprisoned for a time by a compact of

Faernian deities, who wanted to protect their worshipers from

the depredations of his evil. The story of his imprisonment is well

known, and is a popular tale in alehouses across the continent.

Centuries ago, somewhere in the Barrens of Doom and Despair,

several deities challenged the Chaos Hound to a contest. They

had forbidden mortals and deities alike to trafc with the Chaos

Hound, and they would lift the ban if the evil beast could escape

bonds crafted by Gond the Wonderbringer. Kezef agreed, but in

order to dissuade any treachery, he demanded that Tyr place his

right hand inside his mouth. The gods strapped him into the

chains, and then Mystra surrounded him with an invulnerable

nimbus of pure magic that resisted all attempts to dispel or

destroy it. Realizing he had been successfully bound, the Chaos

Hound squeezed his powerful jaws shut and severed Tyrs hand,

the divine essence of which the beast feasted upon for hundreds

of years.

It took the twisted plans of the newly ascended Cyric to release

the hound again, although his plans backred and helped

to ensconce Kelemvor as the new god

of the dead.

Since that time, the Chaos

Hound has spent his time feeding

on souls and chasing down Mask,

whose enmity he gained during the

Cyric debacle. Mask would certainly

have risen back to greater power by

now had he not been constantly on

the run from this deadly and tireless

opponent. Because the Chaos Hound

has been distracted by this hunt,

he has not yet shown himself to be

the enemy that he once was. The gods

are all aware that one day he will

once again feed on their follow-

ers, and they know

Champions of Evil

Kezef the Chaos Hound

in Your Campaign

For centuries, gods and mortals alike believed that the Ravager of

Heavens had been defeated forever, locked away in the Barrens of

Doom and Despair never to hunt the Outer Planes again. The mad

god Cyric proved them wrong. Now that Kezef has been released

and spends his time chasing Mask across the planes, his presence has

been noted on Faern from time to time. While these sightings

amount to little more than rumors, those who know the Chaos

Hound understand that just the lingering aura of hatred he leaves

wherever he goes is enough to cause concern.

Kezef has been temporarily frustrated in his hunt for the Lord

of Shadows by the gods procurement of the sword Houndsbane,

which hides him from the Ravager of Heavens. He spends quite a

bit of time on the Outer Planes hunting souls, but occasionally he

makes forays onto Faern in an attempt to discern Masks location.

Kezef terrorizes Masks clergy where he can nd them, and has

taken to destroying holy artifacts and temples of the faith in order

to try to draw the god out and weaken his following. Powerful

thieves dedicated to the masked god might nd themselves stalked

in the night by an invisible foe who radiates hatred for them and

their god.

Kezef has no organized following on Faern, and most of

Masks enemies would never think of using such an evil against

him. Thats not to say that Kezef hasnt left a lasting impact

upon the world, however. During one of his hunts, he happened

across an evil node that bent heavily toward planar magic

because it sat in a region where travel between the planes was

easier than normal. In this place, the Chaos Hounds footprints

became pools of acidic lth through which creatures from the

paraelemental planes could emerge. It has become known recently

as the Death Shallows.

The Death Shallows

This shallow, at depression lies about 25 miles east of Waterdeep

along the River Dessarin, surrounded by high cliffs. It is an area

rarely seen except by those traveling along the river, who must

sometimes walk along its edge to help their vessels navigate the

shallow water. Kezef rested here while hunting Mask in the city of

Waterdeep, and now foul creatures rise from the slime he left in his

wake. Several ooze and acid paraelementals have taken up residence

in the pools and the surrounding cliffs, giving rise to new tales

of ghosts and an area along the river haunted by those who have

died in its strong currents. Riverboats and trading vessels have been

coming under attack by the paraelementals lately, and Waterdhavian

merchants are beginning to worry about this new threat.

A. Pools of Acid

These pools of acid were created by the Chaos Hound when he

rested here during his hunt for Mask. Normally they would have

evaporated quickly, but this area happened to contain strong planar

magic that not only perpetuated the pools but also allowed elemen-

tal creatures to take up residence in them. The acid has weakened

to the point that it does not harm the paraelementals living inside

the pools, but it still deals 1d12 points of acid damage to other

creatures that enter them, unless these creatures are somehow

resistant or immune to acid normally.

The paraelementals that live here do not always jump out to

attack anyone that visits the shallows. They often wait until a group

is split or sleeping, and sometimes they might simply ignore visi-

tors (which serves to keep the rumors as just that). Any spellcaster

who tries to tap into the evil node draws their ire, however, and is

attacked immediately. The paraelemental weird that lives in the

nearby subterranean cavern commands them for its own purposes

from time to time as well.

Characters who run, engage in combat, or perform other

strenuous activities in the shallows must make a DC 12 Balance

check each round or fall down. Characters on the edge of an acid

pool have a 50% chance of slipping into the pool if this occurs.

Acid (Ex): Any time an ooze paraelemental makes a success-

ful slam attack, it deals acid damage. Its acid deals 40 points of

damage per round to metal or wooden objects. Armor or clothing

dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds on a

DC 13 Reex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes the

paraelemental also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds on a

Reex save. If the ooze paraelemental successfully grapples an

opponent, the foes armor takes a 4 penalty on the Reex save.

B. Caves

These caves are home to several ooze mephits that were sum-

moned to the node but prefer not to live in close proximity to the

paraelementals. Should combat erupt in the shallows, however, the

mephits are likely to swoop in to help the paraelementals, especially

if it looks like they can save any interesting treasures from being

eaten away by the acid. The mephits fear the weird, however, and

hide in their caves anytime it is active.

C. Lair of the Paraelemental Weird

The most dangerous creature to appear through the planar conux

is a paraelemental weird residing in a pool and a submerged cavern

just to the south of the shallows. This creature is not normally

hostile to passing boats, but it takes great offense at efforts to poke

around the shallows or to try to use the nodes magic.

Acid (Ex): Any time the ooze paraelemental weird makes a

successful slam attack, it deals acid damage. Its acid deals 60 points

of damage per round to metal or wooden objects. Armor or cloth-

ing dissolves and becomes useless immediately unless it succeeds at

a DC 20 Reex save. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes the

paraelemental weird also dissolves immediately unless it succeeds at a

Reex save. If the ooze paraelemental weird successfully grapples an

opponent, the foes armor takes a 4 penalty on the Reex save.

Elemental Command (Su): The ooze paraelemental weird

can attempt to gain control over any elemental within 100 feet,

regardless of the latters elemental type. The elemental must make

a DC 23 Will saveor succumb to the weirds control. An elemental

that saves against this attack is immune to that weirds elemental

command ability for 24 hours. There is no limit to the number

of elementals that a weird can control.

Once under the weirds control, an elemental serves the weird

until it or the weird dies, until the weird dismisses it, or until the

duration of its summoning expires. It obeys the weird explicitly,

even if ordered to attack the being who originally summoned it.

The weird does not need to concentrate to maintain control over

any elemental it commands.

Ooze Pool (Su): The ooze paraelemental weirds pool oats atop a

submerged cavern at the southern end of the shallows. Three times

per day, the weird can summon forth 2d4 Huge, 1d2 greater, or

1 elder ooze paraelemental through its pool. Any nonelemental

creature entering the pool without the weirds permission must

148

Champions of Evil

succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save each round or be irrevocably

transformed into elemental ooze.

The weird cannot leave its pool, although it can rise up 10 feet

above the oozes surface, always keeping its body in contact with

the pool. It can retreat through a portal to its native plane, which

exists at the bottom of its pool, but once it does so, the portal closes

and the pool loses its special traits.

Prescience (Su): At will and as a free action, a weird can dupli-

cate the effect of any of the following divination spells: analyze

dweomer, clairaudience/clairvoyance, contact other plane, detect

thoughts (DC 18), discern location, nd the path, foresight, greater

scrying (DC 23), legend lore, locate creature, locate object, tongues,

true seeing, vision. Caster level 18th.

Regeneration: Fire and sonic deal normal damage to a ooze

paraelemental weird.

Spells: The ooze paraelemental weird casts all arcane spells, as

well as divine spells from the Earth and Water domains, as an

18th-level sorcerer.

Player Characters and

Kezef the Chaos Hound

Followers of Mask, especially his priests, have much to fear from

the Chaos Hound, for the closer they get to their god, the more

attention they are apt to draw from the Ravager of Heavens. Kezef

has been known to hunt down Masks most powerful followers in

an attempt to glean information on the gods whereabouts. Once

a character has been tagged by the hound, he might start seeing

signs of being followed: a fetid stench in the air, an aura of hatred

that permeates those around him, or an angry baying in the middle

of the night from somewhere nearby.

A loose afliation of Faithless friars travel Faern seeking

artifacts of the Chaos Hound. They believe (rightly) that their

souls will be safe from the Chaos Hounds depredations only if they

worship no god, and that they will become chosen souls after their

death if they can get close enough to him. They try to achieve that

by pursuing relics of Kezefs history, including the pieces of the

chain that once bound him in the Barrens of Doom and Despair,

and any material objects that have, upon his passing, captured his

innate hatred.

Advancement: 

Ityak-Ortheel is a terrible creature that lurks in the Abyss,

waiting for its master, the god Malar, to call it forth to

destroy life.

Combat

The Elf Eater is a machine of pure destruction. It charges its

enemies, no matter their number, wading in and strangling them

one by one. If it is surrounded by more than a hundred enemies,

it ails its tentacles wildly, slapping as many foes as possible. When

149

Champions of Evil

confronted by small groups or larger foes, it uses as many tentacles

as necessary to grapple, and slams its foes with the rest. It attempts

to eat foes as quickly as possible in order to forever extinguish their

life from the world.

Carapace Defense (Ex): Ityak-Ortheels carapace is nearly

indestructible, so attacking from on top of the creature is

fruitless in most cases. It has a damage reduction of 50/epic

and good, which affects only direct attacks to the carapace, and

the carapace itself has immunity to re. In times of dire need,

Ityak-Ortheel can retreat into its shell, effectively shielding its

body from further attacks. If its enemies continue to damage

it even after it retreats in this way, it rears back up and lashes

out for a nal attack.

Constrict (Ex): The Elf Eater deals automatic tentacle damage

with a successful grapple check. It can constrict with more than

one tentacle, as outlined under Tentacle Grappling, below.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, Ityak-Ortheel must

hit a creature with one or more tentacle attacks (see Tentacle

Grappling below). It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free

action without provoking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the

grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Maw of Destruction (Ex): While it cannot effectively bite with

its huge, toothy maw, the Elf Eater can transfer grappled creatures

to it with its tentacles. Any creature that falls unconscious or dies

while grappled by the Elf Eater is automatically transferred to its

mouth at the beginning of its next turn. Once inside its maw, the

creature is utterly destroyed by the acidic juices within as if it had

been successfully targeted with a destruction spell.

Tentacle Grappling (Ex): Ityak-Ortheel the Elf Eater is a

monstrous creature with forty tentacles ailing out around its

body. It can attack with all of them in a single round as a full

round action, but only eight tentacles can attack a single target. It

can use its improved grab ability on a Large or smaller creature

as long as it hits the creature with a single tentacle. It must hit

with at least two tentacles to in order to use improved grab on a

Huge creature, four tentacles to grab a Gargantuan creature, and

all eight to attempt an improved grab on a Colossal creature. It

must use this many tentacles to maintain its hold or initiate a

normal grapple as well.

A grappled creature can attempt to break free of the Elf Eater

normally, or it can try to cut its way out of the tentacles. Each

tentacle has 15 hit points and an AC of 23, and if the creature

manages to sever all of the tentacles grappling it, it falls to the

ground (taking 1d6 points of falling damage in the process). Severed

tentacles grow back at the rate of one per round.

If a creature attempts to escape the tentacles normally, it must

contend with the sheer number of grasping limbs. The Elf Eaters

tentacles grapple as the largest size of creature it could grapple with

the number of tentacles being used. For example, if it is grappling

with a single tentacle it grapples as a Large creature, but if it has

four tentacles attached it grapples as a Gargantuan creature.

Regeneration (Ex): Fire deals normal damage to the Elf Eater.

The creature regrows tentacles at the rate of one per round in

addition to its normal regeneration. It regrows other lost limbs

(its legs) in 1d6 minutes, although it can reattach a severed leg

instantly by holding it to the stump.

Sense Life (Ex): Although Ityak-Ortheels blindsight extends

only to 100 feet, it can sense all living beings within a radius of

ve miles, and it can instantly differentiate sentience and race

(which allows it to hunt down the elves whom it hates so much).

History

The Elf Eater has existed since the dawn of Abeir-Torils history,

having been spawned directly from the mingled blood of the orc

god Gruumsh and his hated rival, Corellon Larethian. It was in

the aftermath of their titanic struggle that the creature known as

Ityak-Ortheel came into being, and it immediately ed to a deep

layer of the Abyss, where it hides in solitude to this day. Ityak-

Ortheel has plagued the elves from the time of its creation. The

Beastlord, Malar, summons it to the Material Plane on occasion

to punish the elves, and it never fails to wreak havoc and destruc-

tion wherever it goes. Although it might go hundreds, or even

thousands, of years between trips to the Material Plane (it cannot

go of its own volition, and thus must rely on others to transport

it between planes), it slowly digests the souls of those it eats over

a long period of time, keeping it satised and further torturing

those whose lives it has ended.

The creature has not always been under the control of Malar,

however. It once relied on other deities and powerful mortals to

transport it from its home. Now that the Beastlord has begun to

favor it as an instrument of terror, it has begun to visit Faern at

least once per century, sometimes more often, on rampages that

spell death to many elf communities across the world. The elves

have not taken this lightly, however, and have built a portal on the

isle of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles known as Fey-Alamtine.

This portal in the kingdom of Synnoria can be accessed by anyone

holding a platinum Alamtine triangle, one of which was given

to each elf community on Faern. When the Elf Eater attacked,

whole villages and tribes would retreat to the Moonshaes, and

often on to Evermeet from there. This plan worked for centuries,

until Malar divined the location of their portal in 1365 DR and

sent Ityak-Ortheel to deal with it once and for all. The creature

rampaged across Gwynneth and destroyed the portal, the capital city

of Chysalis, and the timeless Palace of Ages before being banished

back to the Abyss.

Ityak-Ortheel has not made an appearance on Faern since,

but some believe another rampage is imminent, especially with

the reemergence of the elves on the continent.

Appearance

Ityak-Ortheel is a monstrous creature, standing 30 feet tall on

three trunklike legs. Its body is a at, round blob of esh with an

incredibly hard, domed carapace sitting atop it. On the underside of

the creature is a huge, toothless maw with wet aps of skin sucking

in and out of the blackness within. A slurping noise can be heard

coming from the maw at all times as it awaits its next meal of elf

esh and bone. This mouth is the color of blood, surrounded by

the tannish-brown esh of the creatures body. It can expand to a

great width in order to accommodate huge prey, or it can extend

downward into a long, probing snout similar to that of an anteater.

The inside of its mouth is lled with hard plates of cartilage that

constantly rub together with bone-crushing force, making instant

work of anything the Elf Eater puts inside.

The creatures body is surrounded by forty 100-

foot-long tentacles that thrash and grapple

any living being that comes within

its awesome reach. These tentacles

are lined by large suckers that help

the creature grab and hold onto its

prey before it inserts the unfortunate

victim into its horrible maw. The ten-

tacles are fully capable of independent

action, and the creature can use

them to fend off and grapple

multiple creatures on all sides

of its body.

Ityak-Ortheel has no eyes

or ears but is keenly aware of

its surroundings, and can sense life

in all its forms, out to a distance of

ve miles. This sense is discerning

as well, allowing the Elf Eater to

track down and destroy as many of

its hated enemies as possible during a

rampage.

Ityak-Ortheel

in Your

Campaign

The Elf Eater has made appearances only at the behest of Malar

in the past few centuries, but that could change at any time. Most

gods want nothing to do with the unbridled destruction that Ityak-

Ortheel represents, and those who do probably do not know where

to nd him. Faern is much safer that way.

A group of Malarites in the Forgotten Forest have come

across one of the Alamtine triangles that their god used to

track down the elven portal the last time he summoned the

Elf Eater to Faern. They treat the triangle as a holy relic, not

understanding its true signicance (even though it is now power-

less). The Malarites, led by a endish werewolf named Tagress,

worship the triangle and offer it blood sacrices at least four

times every moon cycle in order to call forth the Elf Eater to

destroy the lands of Evereska and the elves who reside there. So

far their efforts have proven fruitless, but that has not stopped

their plotting against the elves who live in the hills beyond their

homes eastern frontier.

This group works feverishly to gure out exactly how the

triangle is related to the summoning of the Elf Eater. They go

out of their way to kidnap mages and other loremasters to torture

information out of them before sacricing them the relic. The

Malarites diligently perform all of the rites of Malar and attempt

to bring back a double bounty every time they hunt. So far nothing

has worked, and Tagress has even considered going outside the tribe

for help. He has amassed a large quantity of treasure that he has

nothing to do with, so the idea of hiring adventurers to track down

other relics or information related to the triangles

seems appealing and expedient.

a way to rebuild the Alamtine portal, or at least emulate its former

success. In the meantime, the elves have launched an all-out war

on the followers of Malar, and while some argue that this only

exacerbates the issue, others believe it is the only way to be free of

the monster. Of course, the Malarites have not taken this lightly,

and are waging their own war against elves wherever they can

nd them. While most of their plots are not as ambitious as that

of Tagress, this has meant trouble for elf communities from the

High Forest to the North.

Larger than an ogre, this hulking creature combines the features

of a muscular human and a frog or toad. Its skin is a mottled

red-gold, and two froglike heads sprout from its shoulders, each

with a gaping maw full of sharp teeth. It carries a huge glaive of

black iron, wreathed in dark ame.

In the Year of Oaths Forsaken (626 DR), a cabal of wizards

cast out from Netheril formed an arcane college atop a ruined dwarf

stronghold, Andalbruin, in the foothills of the Forest Hills. They

built a village and a tower to hold their college of magic, which

they called Selskartur, the Tower of the Star. But in the Year of

Rumbling Earth (585 DR), a troll warlord named Harska Thaug

amassed an army of savage humanoids and descended from the

north upon the elves of Rilithar, and the Tower of the Star stood

directly in the troll lords path.

In his desperation, the master of the tower, the Ar-Magus Ilvi-

roon, cast a gate spell and summoned the slaad lord Bazim-Gorag

to destroy Harska Thaugs army. Bazim-Gorag obliged, driving the

troll horde from the valley. But the price the slaad lord demanded

in payment for his services was high, and when Ilviroon balked,

Bazim-Gorag attacked, razing the Tower of the Star and slaying

several of its senior wizards. Ilviroon retaliated by luring Bazim-

Gorag into a trap and imprisoning him, via a powerful binding

spell cast in cooperation with several of the surviving wizards, in

a chamber beneath the burned-out tower. As part of the binding,

he set the conditions for Bazim-Gorags rite of unbinding, but he

told no one the formula.

The following winter, Harska Thaug returned with an even

greater army, and once more the ar-magus was forced to turn

to Bazim-Gorag for aid. But when the slaad lord demurred,

Ilviroon was forced to confront the troll horde alone, and in

the ensuing battle he was slain. With him died the secret rite of

unbinding needed to free Bazim-Gorag from his prison. Harksa

Thaug completed the destruction of the tower that Bazim-

Gorag had begun.

In the centuries since the fall of the tower, numerous adventuring

parties have explored the upper levels of the citadel, which has come

to be known as the Dungeon of the Ruins, without ever discovering

Bazim-Gorags prison. Then, seventeen years ago, a group called

the Company of the Riven Orb unearthed his hidden vault but

were unable to free him from his magical prison. Since that time,

Bazim-Gorag has managed to lure dozens of evil beings into his

service. Calling themselves the Acolytes of the Hidden Flame, they

have been working diligently to discover the rite of unbinding that

will free their lord.

Bazim-Gorag is a slaad lord, one of the most powerful slaadi

in existence, tainted by the same malignant forces that transform

gray slaadi into death slaadi. Like the other slaad lords, Bazim-

Gorag is a champion of chaos. He hungers to spread chaos through

unchecked destruction, murder, woeand re. Bazim-Gorag creates

conagrations and wields re with all the malevolent glee of a

mighty red dragon.

Bazim-Gorag has come to hate Faern, the realm of his long

imprisonment, with a vitriolic ire that can only be sated with a

Incandescent Aura (Su): Bazim-Gorag can wreathe his

body in a aming aura as a free action. Anyone within 20 feet

and must make a DC 31 Reex save or catch re (see page

303 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). The save DC is

burning the likes of which the North has never seenif only he

can be freed to wreak his vengeance.

Combat

Bazim-Gorag does not attack those who wander into his reach

if he believes the would-be foes can be turned to the purpose of

freeing him from his prison. The slaad lord often uses his change

shape ability to approach potential allies in a nonthreatening

guise, usually that of a tall, handsome lord with red hair and

bronze armor. He is willing to offer power, wealth, even a promise

of future service to attain his freedom (although

honoring promises is not Bazim-Gorags strong

suit). Only when he is certain that intruders

into his lair cannot or will not help him

does he attack. After twenty centuries

of imprisonment, Bazim-Gorag is

inclined to toy with his victims

and draw out a ght simply for

its entertainment value.

In a deadly contest, Bazim-

Gorag uses his double mind ability

to launch repeated re attacks with

his spell-like abilities, while hacking

his foes to pieces with his physical

attacks. He saves his incinerating

strike for use against an opponent who

has managed to seriously annoy or injure

him. Bazim-Gorags natural weapons,

as well as any weapon he wields,

are treated as chaotic-aligned and

evil-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. He

also receives a +6 insight bonus on

any attacks (this bonus is factored

into the statistics above).

Change Shape (Su): Bazim-Gorag can shift

between his natural form and any humanoid

form at will as a standard action. He gains the

size, natural weapons, movement modes, and

extraordinary special attacks of his new form, but

loses those of his original form. He retains all other special attacks

and qualities of his original form. Bazim-Gorag retains the ability

scores, hit points, and saves of his original form. He remains in

one form until he chooses to assume a new one. A change in form

cannot be dispelled, but he will revert to his natural form if killed.

A true seeing spell reveals his natural form. When he assumes

another shape, his magical glaive automatically adjusts in size to

suit the new shape. Its base damage adjusts to the new size, but its

other enhancements remain the same.

Bazim-Gorag gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks if he uses

this ability to create a disguise. However, when he speaks, his voice

often changes in pitch as his two heads (one hidden by magic but

there nonetheless) nish each others sentences.

Incinerating Strike (Su): Three times per day,

Bazim-Gorag can declare an incinerating strike

with a melee attack. If the attack hits, he deals

100 points of re damage (Fortitude save DC

31 for half) in addition to his normal melee

damage. Any creature slain by this attack is utterly

consumed in re, as if subjected to a destruction

spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.

All-Round Vision (Ex): Bazim-Gorag gains a

+4 racial bonus to Search and Spot checks (already

included in the statistics), and he cannot be

anked.

Double Mind (Ex): Bazim-Gorag has

two brains and two personas. One brain

can  direct  his  body  while  the  other

engages in a completely unrelated activity,

such as conversation or the use of his spell-

like abilities. In combat, Bazim-Gorag gains a

bonus standard action each turn, which can be

used only to perform a mental activity, such as

using a spell-like ability or a skill based on a mental

ability score.

Bazim-Gorag is treated as two independent creatures for pur-

poses of targeting him with a mind-affecting effect. A spell that

affects only one target can affect one of Bazim-Gorags minds

but not both. If one of Bazim-Gorags minds is incapacitated

or affected in some way, Bazim-Gorag loses his bonus action.

If Bazim-Gorag is subjected to a mind-affecting effect that can

affect two or more creatures at once, each of his two minds saves

separately and is affected separately.

As long as one of Bazim-Gorags minds remains unaffected by

a particular effect, the affected mind gains a new saving throw

each round to shake off the effect. If both minds are affected

by the same effect, Bazim-Gorag is affected normally.

Champions of Evil

Pernicious Fire (Su): Bazim-Gorags spell-like abilities with the

re descriptor are empowered, and thus deal 50% more damage

than would normally be indicated.

Summon Slaad (Sp): This ability is currently unavailable to

Bazim-Gorag in his binding. If free, Bazim-Gorag can automatically

summon 1 death slaad or 1d4+1 blue slaad once per day.

Telepathy (Su): Bazim-Gorag can communicate telepathically

with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.

Bazim-Gorags Lair

Deep below the Dungeon of the Ruins lies the prison where Bazim-

Gorag has waited out the centuries. It consists of two chambers

connected by a portal.

The entrance to the rst chamber is marked by an archway

of red stones scribed with lawful runes. Bazim-Gorag cannot pass

through it by any means, and his spells and powers cannot affect

anyone standing beyond it. Within this chamber, he holds audience

with his Acolytes, who often bring him captives with which to

amuse himself, usually by tossing them into the lava pool at the

rooms center.

The second chamber can be accessed only via the portal, and

consists of a double hall, each with its own row of columns and

lava pit, with a third lava pit between the two.. Bazim-Gorag can

temporarily block this portal (5 rounds) to prevent others from

following close on his heels if he needs to retreat. This chamber is

Bazim-Gorags private sanctum, where he keeps his rather consider-

able treasure including the scepter of the ar-magus.

Enemies

Bazim-Gorags ancient enemies have been dead for many

centuries. As yet, the actions of the Acolytes of the Hidden

Flame have not attracted the attention of powerful rivals that

could threaten their plans. Their evil is small and localized. The

greatest threat to Bazim-Gorag might actually come from others

of his kind. The slaad lords Ssendam and Ygorl tolerate Bazim-

Gorags destructive nature as long as Bazim-Gorag refrains

from overtly challenging their rule over the race. Bazim-Gorag

naturally schemes to advance the power of the death slaadi

over the rest of their kind. Doubtless Bazim-Gorag would have

been lured into a fatal confrontation against his more power-

ful fellows long agobut for the better part of two thousand

years, he has been imprisoned in a mighty binding beneath the

Dungeon of the Ruins.

Recruitment

Bazim-Gorags followers are always on the lookout for new

recruits, especially for spellcasters who could help them complete

the rite of unbinding. Bazim-Gorag himself might attempt to

recruit any adventurers who wander into his lair if he thinks

they could be of service to him and they are capable of assisting

in his release. He might even offer the treasure located in his

chamber as payment to anyone who can release him from his

prisonof course, the treasure has also been promised to many

of his current followers.

Anyone approaching the cult with a professed interest in

joining it is taken to one of its leaders, Flame Lord Moskogg, to

be questioned thoroughly by both magical and mundane means.

Those who pass this initial test and might be of use in releasing

Bazim-Gorag are then passed on to Flame Lord Durzhal before

nally being brought before the Firebringer himself.

The Acolytes of the

Hidden Flame

Bazim-Gorag has gathered a cult of nearly fty evil followers who

have dedicated themselves to freeing him from his magical prison.

Some are drawn by his promises of reward, both in treasure and

power, while others are simply attracted by the prospect of chaos

and destruction that his freedom would release upon the North.

Some even hope to one day bend Bazim-Gorag to their own will

and use him to further their own goals.

The group consists of human brigands who act as foot soliders

and guards; several monsters, including a trio of formorian giants;

and several slaadi of various types. The leaders are spellcasters,

ends, or powerful outsiders. Three of the highest-ranking lead-

ers are Flame Lord Moskogg, Flame Lord Durzhul, and High

Conagration Jendar Tholm.

Flame Lord Moskogg (CE male half-end/half-minotaur cleric

9 of Kossuth): Moskogg oversees the groups raiding and recruiting

efforts and functions as the commander of the lower-level guards

and warriors; he answers only to High Conagration Jendar Tholm.

Moskogg lives in the barracks house near the Dungeon of the

Ruins and is usually attended by a young human female named

Dregadzel (Female Gray Slaad in human form), who serves as his

secretary and lieutenant. She also participates in the questioning

of new recruits, especially human males.

Flame Lord Durzhul (CE male durzagonMM2 wizard 13): Dur-

zhul is the chief arcane spellcaster of the Acolytes of the Hidden

Flame, and the architect of the efforts to free Bazim-Gorag. It was

he who discovered the particulars of the rite of unbinding. Arcane

spellcasters seeking to join the cult are eventually brought to him

for questioning. He spends most of his time in an area of the

Dungeon of the Ruins called the alchemists croft, busily researching

the details of Bazim-Gorags prison. He is always attended by two

red slaadi bodyguards.

High Conagration Jendar Tholm (CE advanced death

slaad): Jendar is the leader of the Acolytes of the Hidden Flame.

As the leader, he coordinates the activities of his lieutenants to

make certain they support one another in the ultimate goal of

freeing Bazim-Gorag. He is the liaison between Bazim-Gorag

and his followers, as well as the paymaster, keeping a tight

control over the groups funds. His residence is deep within the

Dungeon of the Ruins, and he is always attended by a 6th-level

troll barbarian.

The Rite of Unbinding

Ar-Magus Ilviroon gave his binding spell additional strength by

specifying a rite of unbindinga set of conditions that must be

met to set Bazim-Gorag free. The specics of the riteincluding

its arcane phrases and invocationswere lost when Ilviroon died,

but might be rediscovered via legend lore or similar magic. The

requisite conditions for the completion of the rite are as follows:

Three wizardsone chaotic, one neutral, and one lawfulmust

perform the rite.

The rite must be performed in an area uncovered by the Com-

pany of the Riven Orb called the Chamber of Binding, which lies

deep beneath the Dungeon of the Ruins.

Each participant in turn must recite a specic set of arcane

phrases and invocations in Loross, the ancient language of High

Netheril.

One of the three wizards must hold the scepter of the ar-magus,

currently located in Bazim-Gorags lair. The scepter is a +1 light mace

that also functions as a variant of a brooch of shielding (absorbing 20

points of magic missile damage per day). Three times per day, it can

also be used to cast a minor globe of invulnerability, and twice per day

it can re a prismatic ray. Any magic item with identical properties

can be used in its place, if it happens to be destroyed or lost.

All three wizards must cast dismissal at the end of the rite.

This mighty end stands nearly 10 feet tall. Its skin is marble-

white, and it has two huge wings that shed shabby-looking gray

feathers. Its hands and feet are gray with scaly, birdlike talons; a

long, serpentine tail writhes behind it. Small black horns curl from

the sides of its head, and a long mane of disheveled hair cascades

down its back. The creatures humanoid-shaped face would be

noble and handsome, but the eyes are cold black pits, and a large,

complex sigil or mark has been branded across its face. The raw

brand weeps trickles of foul blood.

Lord of the ends of Myth Drannor and an outcast archduke of

Hell, Malkizid was once a solar who stood high in the service of

the Seldarine. Long ago he was seduced into betraying Corellon

Larethian by Araushnee (the goddess who became Lolth, Queen of

Spiders) and fell. When Araushnees rebellion failed, Malkizid was

branded for his treachery and cast down into the Hells. He arose

as a devil prince, and quickly carved out his own kingom.

However, Malkizid earned the disfavor of Asmodeus thousands

of years ago and was exiled from the Nine Hells, along with a small

host of devils who followed him. The Branded King settled for

building his infernal realm in the nameless pits of the yugoloths.

Malkizid is therefore both a yugoloth lord and an archdevil in

exile, and his servants include the devils who followed him into

exile as well as the yugoloths of the pits.

Malkizid is a clever, hateful, and patient devil of surpass-

ing power. He absolutely despises Lolth and her drow, blaming

Araushnee for his fall from grace. Likewise, he hates and fears

Corellon, since he feels that Corellon might have shown him mercy,

but instead cast him down from Arvandor into the Hells. Since

Lolth and Corellon Larethian are both above his reach, Malkizid

exercises his enmity against their mortal followersthe surface

elves and the drow.

Over thousands of years, Malkizid has played a subtle role in

many of the troubles of the elves. He was a secret patron of the

Vyshaanti overlords of Aryvandaar, teaching them many secrets

of powerful magic and encouraging their aggression against the

other elven realms of the First Flowering. Later, he sought to

ensnare the sun-elf realm of Siluvanede in his plots. Malkizids

greatest success came in The Weeping War of 711714 DR, when

three of his servantspowerful nycaloths he dispatched to Faern

long beforebrought about the destruction of Myth Drannor.

Malkizid returned to Faern in 1355 DR, positioning himself as

155

Champions of Evil

the hidden lord of the devils of Myth Drannor while pursuing his

dark schemes.

Combat

Malkizid was formerly a solar of unusual power, and he retains

many of the abilities and characteristics of his original form. He

is an awesome foe, capable of besting all but the most powerful

archdevils or demon princes in personal combat, but Malkizids

favorite weapons are honeyed words and seductive promises. He

delights in using gifts of power to ensnare those whom he wishes to

defeat, leading his enemies down the paths of their own destruction.

He resorts to open battle only when directly threatened by a foe

who refuses to be caught in his snares.

Malkizids natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields,

are treated as lawful-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction. He also receives a +6 insight bonus

on any attacks (this bonus is factored into the statistics above).

Baatezu Traits: Malkizid can communicate telepathically with

any creature within 100 feet that has a language. In addition, he

can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a

deeper darkness spell.

Brand (Su): Malkizids face is marked by a horrible, weeping

brand. Any creature within 30 feet that meets Malkizids gaze is

paralyzed for 1 hour and takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will

DC 36 negates the paralysis and reduces the Wisdom damage to

1 point). Baatezu and yugoloths are affected only if Malkizid uses

his brand as a gaze attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Malkizid can create an aura

of fear in a 20-foot radius. It otherwise functions as a fear spell

(caster level 15th, save DC 36). If the save is successful, that

creature cannot be affected again by the aura for 24 hours. Baatezu

and yugoloths are immune to the aura.

Prismatic Disruption (Sp): Three times per day, Malkizid can

create a prismatic disruption that affects all creatures within 30 feet

currently under the effect of a spell or spell-like ability. Malkizid

makes a dispel check against each spell or effect on each creature

in the area as if casting greater dispelling; Malkizids dispel check

modier is +24 for these checks, and includes a racial +4 bonus.

Creatures using magic items that grant constant bonuses are not

affected, but magic items that replicate or grant spell effects and

are actively doing so when Malkizid uses this ability are subject to

the disruption.

For each spell or effect that is dispelled, one randomly deter-

mined ray of a prismatic spray spell strikes the target creature

(save DC 29). The save DC is Charisma-based. This ability is the

equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

Regeneration (Ex): Malkizid takes normal damage from

good-aligned silver weapons, and spells or effects with the good

descriptor.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willaid, animate objects, bestow curse

(DC 23), contagion (DC 24), continual ame, dimensional anchor

(+37 ranged touch), greater dispel magic, unholy blight (DC 24),

imprisonment (DC 29), invisibility (self only), lesser restoration,

polymorph (self only), power word stun, resist energy, summon

monster VII, teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), waves of

mass charm monster (DC 28), permanency, resurrection, waves of

exhaustion; 1/daygreater restoration, power word blind, power

word kill, prismatic spray (DC 27), wish. Caster level 25th.

Spells: Malkizid casts divine spells as a 20th-level cleric with

access to the domains of Destruction and Evil. While Malkizid

no longer serves a deity, he is a servant of the universal forces of

evil and woe.

Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (caster level 20th): 0detect

caster level).

Malkizids Schemes

One can never be sure where and how Malkizid is attempting to

inuence elven affairs. A number of scholars have speculated on a

link between their ancient foe and the drow invasion of Corman-

thor, though few would suggest that an actual alliance exists between

the archdevil and Jezz the Lame, or any of the other drow. More

likely, Malkizid seeks to create divisions within the drow ranks by

encouraging independent thought, while at the same time promot-

ing conict between the surface drow and the elves.

It is also possible that Malkizid has been sponsoring elements

within the Eldreth Veluuthra and encouraging their wars against

humanity. The organization has seen a recent inux of new magical,

logistical, and monetary support, the source of which remains a

mystery. If the VelNikeryma (the ruling council of the Eldreth

Veluuthra) ever suspected the interference of Malkizid in their

affairs, they would surely seek to purge any evil extraplanar inu-

ence from their ranks.

Because he views them as the perfect corruption of the

elven ideal, Malkizid has been seeking an alliance with the

daemonfey. Though he has managed to recruit a few individuals,

the daemonfey are reluctant to subject themselves to such a

powerful creature as Malkizid. Today, he might prove a valuable

allybut tomorrow he would surely declare himself overlord

of all daemonfey. Nevertheless, Malkizid is patient and feels

that, sooner or later, the daemonfey will come to realize the

advantages of his rulership.

Recruitment

Malkizid carefully recruits disgruntled members of the elf race.

His spies exist within nearly every elven realm above and below

the ground, as well as in Torils seas. His trusted lieutenants spy

and pass information back to their lord, distribute aid to allied

organizations, and subvert any efforts toward elven unity. They

also recruit or corrupt powerful elves and sow the seeds of

dissention wherever practicable. The following are two agents

that characters might encounter.

Nissnley (LE female half sun elf/half yugoloth ghter 5):

Nissnley is more than just a paid agent. Shes a member of

the family, so to speak. Her father was Tremmor, a powerful

yugoloth in Malkizids service. He bedded a captive thrall

elf in his lords dungeon and set his vile seed to growing inside

her. When the endish child erupted from its mother, Tremmor

named his daughter after the sound of her dead mothers organs

spilling across the scalding hot stones of his bedchamber oor.

Nissnley grew from a cruel hellion to an enchantingly beauti-

ful end at the feet of Malkizid, learning evil from one of its

most accomplished masters. In time, her lord developed a brief

infatuation with her. Her father, Tremmor, dared to protest

and was slaughtered for his impertinence. Nissnley watched

her fathers murder with delight, but Malkizid soon grew weary

of her overeager attentions. No amount of evil could completely

eradicate her underlying elf nature. But rather than kill her, he

sent her to recruit among the daemonfey, promising that if she

should succeed, she would prove herself a worthy object of his

lust once more. Nissnley gladly took on this mission, and has

been seducing and murdering her way through the daemonfey

leadership ever since.

Dheembleth (CE male draegloth rogue 7/assassin 2): When

Lolth turned her back on his matron mother for some long-

forgotten offense, Dheembleth survived a disastrous war in

which his patron family was wiped out, narrowly escaping

the drow hunting parties sent to destroy him. After a

century of wandering the Underdark, he was captured by

Malkizids minions. Malkizid delighted in completing the

corruption of this former chosen of Lolth and making him one

of his own. Now, Dheembleth is one of Malkizids most trusted

assassins and agents. Scouting the fringes of drow society, he keeps

tabs on several enclaves, striking silently and swiftly when the

opportunity arises, slaying female clerics and capturing powerful

males to take back to his lord.

Champions of Ruin addresses the evil campaign, both as

a general concept and as it applies to games  set in the

FO R G OTT E N RE A L M S Campaign Se t t i n g . T he book also

offers invaluable tips for running evil PCs as well as

overcoming evil NPCs.

Vanrakdoom is a short D&D adventure for four 17th-

level player characters (PCs) that utilizes the new mate-

rial in Champions of Ru i n . It takes place in Wa t e rd e e p,

also known as the City of Splendors, which lies on the

continent of Faern in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Se t t i n g . Famed  for  the  legendary  dungeon  called

Undermountain that lies beneath its streets, Waterdeep

draws adve nt u rers from all over Faern. Dug by the

shield dwarves of Clan Melairkyn and their successors,

Undermountain consists of nine major levels and four-

teen subleve l s. Ha l a s t e r, the Mad Mage (detailed on

page 180 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and

updated on page 294 of the Epic Level Ha n d b o o k), ru l e s

this sprawling complex. However, many powerful crea-

t u res have carved out personal demesnes within the

sprawling caverns and chambers of Ha l a s t e rs Ha l l s,

and the Mad Mage of Un d e r m o u ntain has largely

ignored their presence.

A confused tangle of sublevels between levels 4 and 6

of the main dungeon has come to be known as the Dark

L e vels of Un d e r m o u ntain. Since many of these sub-

l e vels are accessible only via p o rt a l s , f ew have been

e x p l o red by outsiders. Se veral of the Da rk Leve l s, all

ruled by undead cre a t u re s, are collectively known

as dooms.

One of these subleve l s, known as Va n ra k d o o m , i s

c o nt rolled by the Church of Sh a r. Penetration of this

a rea is a mission appropriate for a group of four 17th-

l e vel nonevil characters. T he inclusion of a cleric in a

p a rty planning an excursion to this area is highly

recommended.

As always, feel free to adapt the material pre s e nt e d

here as you see fit to make it work with your campaign.

PREPARATION

You (the DM) need the D&D core ru l e b o o k st he

Pl a ye rs Ha n d b o o k , t he Dungeon Ma s t e rs Guide, and the

Monster Manualas well as Champions of Ruinto run

this adve nt u re. T he scenario also draws on material

f rom Complete Arc a n e (CAr), Complete Divine ( C D ) ,

Faiths & Pa n t h e o n s (F&P), Fiend Folio (FF), FO R G OTT E N

RE A L M S Campaign  Se t t i n g (FRCS), L o rds  of  Da rk n e s s

Monster Manual II (MM2), Monster Manual III ( M M 3 ) ,

Planar Ha n d b o o k ( PlH), and Pl a ye r s Guide to Fa e r  n

(PGtF). T he city of Wa t e rdeep is fully detailed in the

upcoming City of Splendors: Wa t e rdeep s u p p l e m e nt, but

1

that publication is not re qu i red to run this adve nt u re .

Pa re nt hetical re f e rences such as Blushing Me r m a i d

(D36) refer to the map key in City of Splendors: Wa t e r-

d e e p and are included for the convenience of DMs

wishing to run the adventure in conjunction with that

setting. T he information pre s e nted he re utilizes the

D&D v.3.5 rules.

The adventure is designed for 17th-level characters.

If the mission is to clear Vanrakdoom completely, an

18th- or 19th-level party could also find it a sufficient

challenge. In addition, it can be appropriate for charac-

ters one or two levels lower if the mission invo l ves a

quick hit rather than a deep penetration. You can adjust

the Encounter Levels of most group encounters simply

by choosing lowe r - l e vel opponents from among those

presented.

Statistics are given for the more challenging oppo-

n e nts in Va n r a k d o o m, particularly those who have

p restige classes. W he re groups of such characters are

e n c o u nt e red, feel free  to customize the individuals if

desired, raising or lowering the class levels for some of

t hem and substituting differe nt equ i p m e nt. Si n g l e-

classed opponents are left for you to develop using the

NPC tables in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

To get started, print out the adve nt u re, including the

m a p s. Read through the scenario at least once to familiar-

i ze yourself with the situation, thre a t s, and major NPCs

( p a rticularly their motivations). Text that appears in

shaded boxes is player information that you can re a d

aloud or paraphrase for the players at the proper times.

For monster and NPC statistics, refer to either the Ap p e n-

dix or the appropriate pages in the publications noted.

ADVENTURE

BACKGROUND

Adherents of the Nightmaiden have long been active in

t he shadow of Mo u nt Wa t e rd e e p, and their missions

h a ve been quite varied. Howe ve r, the Wa t e rd h a v i a n

c h u rch of Shar traces its origins back to a disastro u s

expedition to the Black Jungles mounted in the Year of

Da rk Dawn (1104 DR) by Lo rd Vanrak Mo o n s t a r, a

noted explorer in his day. Formerly a charismatic, out-

going swashbuckler, Vanrak was but a pale shadow of

his former self when he returned. A scant few tendays

l a t e r, Lo rd An d varran Mo o n s t a r, the family patriarc h,

died of a strange wasting disease that was unknown to

Wa t e rd e e ps healers and strangely re s i s t a nt to the i r

spells.

Upon assuming leadership of House Mo o n s t a r, Lo rd

Vanrak publicly broke with the priests of the Hi g h

House of Stars (the temple of Selne that preceded the

House of the Moon), whom he blamed for his fathe rs

u ntimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Da rk

R a n g e r, as Vanrak came to be know n, secretly emb r a c e d

Se l  n es ancient enemy, the Lady of Lo s s.

By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House

Moonstar was in open schism. Those nobles who still

venerated  Selne  aligned  the m s e l ves  with  Lo rd

Va n r a ks sister, Lady Alathene, and the Mo o n m a i d e ns

p r i e s t s, most of whom had taken refuge in the Hi g h

House of St a r s. Meanwhile, at the Moonstar Villa in

Dock Wa rd (now the Blushing Mermaid Festhall; see

D36 in City of Splendors: Waterdeep), Lord Vanrak and his

f o l l owers extended their dark influence over much of

the citys harbor with the aid of a small army of merce-

naries and priests of Shar.

On the night of the seve nth full moon of the ye a r,

Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the

Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and

banish him from the city. To demonstrate the need for

such drastic action, she pre s e nted evidence of he r

b ro t he rs numerous crimes, including slave ry, arson,

theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the Dark Rangers

immediate capture, but by the time the Watch had

b re a c hed the gates of the Moonstar Villa, Lo rd Va n r a k

and his followers had disappeared.

Un b e k n ownst to his moon-worshiping kin, Lo rd

Vanrak had already fled through a secret p o rt a l i nt o

Undermountain. For decades thereafter, he and his fol-

l owers explored Ha l a s t e rs Ha l l s. Though they lost

many of their number to the wandering beasts that

inhabited the area, they managed to recruit new adher-

e nts from among the depraved criminals whom the

Lords had banished to the depths.

In the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), Vanrak and

his followers conquered a highly defensible redoubt in

t he Da rk Levels of Un d e r m o u ntain (UM SLM), which

came to be known as Vanrakdoom. Operating from this

base,  the  Church  of  Shar  extended  its  influence

throughout much of Undermountain, and even period-

ically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of

the Moonmaiden in the city above.

The Church of Shar achieved its most dramatic suc-

cess in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when Vanraks

followers managed to infiltrate the High House of Stars

t h rough its cellars and slaughter most of the inhabi-

t a nts before they could raise an alarm. By the time the

Watch arrived, the temple was a towering inferno of

s h a d ow magic d a rk f i re , which appeared impervious to

magic, especially to the ill-pre p a red fire f i g h t e r s. T he

i n vaders  also  acqu i red  enough  tre a s u re  from  the

temple vaults to fund Lo rd Va n r a ks personal quest for

i m m o rt a l i t y. Within a few ye a r s, the Da rk Ranger had

vo l u ntarily transformed himself into a death knight

the perfect, eternal servant of the Lady of Loss.

2

In re c e nt ye a r s, Lo rd Va n r a ks followers have failed

to execute several import a nt plans. In the Year of the

Saddle (1345 DR), the Dark Army of the Night tried but

failed to set the House of the Moon afire as part of the

so-called Night of Temple Fires. In the Year of Shadows

(1358 DR), the avatar of Shar attempted to subve rt the

Mo o n m a i d e ns church by masquerading as the moon

goddess and imprisoning the avatar of Selne. Dr i ve n

from the city after followers of the Moonmaiden freed

Selne from Shars clutches, Shars faithful were forced

to  nurse  their  bitterness  anew  in  the  darkness  of

Vanrakdoom.

Lo rd Vanrak is pre s e ntly focused on building an

army  of  krinth.  He  has  been  approaching  krint h

refugees after they escape from the city of Shade (see

Champions of Ru i n page 15) and convincing them to

settle in the depths of Undermountain.

ADVENTURE SYNOPSIS

Vanrakdoom details a layer of Un d e r m o u ntain suited

for exploration by powerful adventurers. A small group

might wreak great havoc on the temple through a

series of hit-and- ru n- r a i d s, but a fro ntal assault is

unlikely to succeed given the collective power of the

creatures lairing within. Many of the temples residents

were drawn here by the personal charisma and faith of

t he Da rk Ranger, so a clandestine mission to hunt

down and destroy the death knight may cause many of

t he temples curre nt defenders to drift away over time.

ADVENTURE HOOKS

Vanrakdoom works best as a bastion of evil that the PCs

d i s c over during the course of their care e r s. Those who

a re drawn into the endless war between Se l  n es follow-

ers and the minions of Shar may gradually build up a

burning ambition to root out the dark temple that has

been implementing Sh a rs machinations along the

Sw o rd Coast for so long. Of course, simply divining the

location of Sh a rs primary temple in Un d e r m o u nt a i n

may invo l ve a whole host of adve nt u res of your devising.

As DM, you know best how to invo l ve your charac-

ters in an adve nt u re. Howe ve r, if yo ure stuck for an

idea, you can use any of the following suggestions to

prompt a raid on Vanrakdoom.

House  Moonstar  and  the  followers  of  the  Mo o n-

maiden have long sought access to the hidden temple

of Shar that is believed to lie in the depths of Un d e r-

m o u ntain.  Re c e nt l y,  an  agent  of  Selne  re p o rt e d

tracking  an  assassin  of  Shar  back  to  a  he re t o f o re

u n k n own p o rt a l that the leaders of House Mo o n s t a r

suspect may lead to that long-sought temple. T hey ask

t he adve nt u rers to travel through the p o rt a l and deter-

mine its destination.

A noble of House Moonstar (or a well-known cleric of

the Moonmaiden) is abducted by the minions of Shar.

Selnes followers ask the  PCs  to  lead  a  high-stakes

rescue mission into the depths of Undermountain to

find the missing Selnite.

As  part  of  the  tit-f o r -tat  skirmishing  that  has  long

characterized the  war  between  the  churches  of  the

Moonmaiden and the Lady of Loss, the followers of

Selne and Shar have  frequently launched raids on

one anothe rs strongholds to seize relics sacred to the i r

rivals. Recently, a relic known as the Rod of Four Moons

was captured during a daring assault on the House of

the Moon in Waterdeep. The PCs are asked to recover

the missing relic or, failing that, to capture the Shad-

owstaff of Gorothir.

BEGINNING THE

ADVENTURE

Va n ra k d o o m is a site-based adve nt u re in which the

action occurs in an isolated section of Undermountain

ruled by the Church of Sh a r. T he area is inaccessible

e xcept via a physical connection to the 6th level of

Un d e r m o u ntain and several p o rtals. T h u s, PCs must

e i t her penetrate Un d e r m o u ntain (a lengthy adve nt u re

in itself ) or locate an access p o rt a l to ent e r. T he adve n-

ture describes the locations of several access portals, but

you can alter these as you see fit or create new ones if

d e s i red. T he adve nt u re begins when the PCs actually

enter Vanrakdoom.

VANRAKDOOM

(UM SLM)

Vanrakdoom was originally built by Clan Melairkyn as

a sprawling temple to Moradin So u l f o r g e r. After drow

and duergar invaders drove the shield dwarves fro m

t hese halls, an eve r -changing succession of monsters

from the depths inhabited the temple.

For nearly two centuries now, this sublevel of

Un d e r m o u ntain has been ruled by the Church of

Sh a r, and it has become a powe rful bastion of evil

b e yond the reach of either the Lo rds of Wa t e rdeep or

t he Church of Selne. From this fortified re d o u b t ,

Lo rd Vanrak Moonstar now commands several Sh a r-

ran cults (see Champions of Ru i n , page 87), which are

a c t i ve along the Sw o rd Coast from Ba l d u rs Gate to

Lu s k a n .

INTERIOR FEATURES

T he stonew o rk throughout the dungeon is mostly

granite of ancient work m a n s h i p. T he floors, walls, and

ceilings are smooth. Unless otherwise noted, the corri-

dor width remains a constant 5 or 10 feet, as shown on

t he map. Height varies whe re indicated, but the ceil-

ings are usually 10 feet high in 5-foot-wide halls and 12

feet high in 10-foot-wide halls. T he interior doors are

constructed of metal-bound oak.

Typical Oak and Iron Do o r : 2 in. thick; hard-

ness 5; hp 20; break DC 28, Open Lock (when appropri-

ate) DC 30.

Typical Ma s o n ry Wa l l : 1 ft. thick; hardness 8;

hp 90; break DC 35; Climb DC 15.

The entire sublevel is cloaked in overlapping unhal-

l ow s p e l l s, and tied to each of these spells is a d e e p e r

d a rkness effect. T hese wards are re n ewed annually by

t he clergy of Sh a r. Room descriptions assume that the

v i ewers are capable of seeing within an area of d e e p e r

d a rk n e s s . If not, adjust the descriptions accord i n g l y.

A  map  of  Vanrakdoom  can  be  found  at

c _ k e y.jpg. T hese maps have been re p roduced he re for

your convenience. Unlabeled spiral stairs lead up to

secret doors that open into the Seadeeps (UM L6).

ENTRANCES AND EXITS

Vanrakdoom is physically connected to the 6th level of

Un d e r m o u ntain (UM L6), which is known as the Se a d-

e e p s. T h ree spiral stairc a s e sone west of V25, one west of

V9, and one south of V11lead up to a maze of mining

tunnels that extends out from the Shaft (UM SLB) under

t he sea floor. Each staircase is warded by an a l a rm s p e l l

(caster level 12th), which triggers an audible alarm.

Nu m e rous p o rt a l s connect Vanrakdoom to Un d e r-

m o u nt a i n, Wa t e rd e e p, and the rest of Faern. Po rt a l s

leading into and out of the dungeon are located in areas

V10, V17, V20, and V24, in a section of the temple

k n own as the Laby r i nth (see below). This area is the

most likely entry point for the party

Te l e p o rt spells  into  and  out  of  Vanrakdoom  are

s e ve rely restricted by a powe rful ward that enmeshe s

all of Un d e r m o u ntain. Similar wards int e rdict trans-

p o rt spells that do not invo l ve teleport a t i o n, such as

s h a d ow walk. Howe ve r, it is still possible to trave r s e

small stretches of Undermountain via shadow walk, and

many of Sh a rs faithful use this route to reach the

uppermost levels of Undermountain.

THE LABYRINTH

T he area known as the Laby r i nth (areas V10, V16, V 1 7 ,

V20,  and  V24)  was  built  by  the  dwarves  of  Clan

Me l a i rkyn as a battleground for fighting int ru d e r s. T he

d w a rves filled these rooms with pit traps, shifting walls,

and one-way doors, and then provided their fellow

clansfolk with extensive training so that eve ryone could

readily exploit these surro u n d i n g s. T he followers of

Shar use this battleground for the same purposes as

t heir predecessors did, but they have added their ow n

m o d i f i c a t i o n s.

The shifting walls are used to provide Shars follow-

ers with advantages in a fight. All the temple personnel

h a ve drilled extensively in these areas and know the

terrain well. T he four Hands of Shar who occupy the

c o nt rol room in area V16 observe battles in pro g re s s

and operate the shifting walls, giving their compatriots

t he opportunity to launch coordinated amb u s he s, set

up flanking attacks, and in some cases, enter ro o m s

u n e x p e c t e d l y. Those in battle with int ruders can also

signal the operators in the cont rol room as to the i r

wishes. Unless otherwise noted, any given shifting wall

can move as far as the are as layout will allow in the

indicated directions.

T he original one-way doors have been conve rt e d

i nto variable p o rt a l s that function both keyed and

u n k e ye d . An yone using one of these p o rt a l s without a

key always goes to area V23 (50% chance per individ-

ual), or area V39 (25% chance per individual), or are a

V40 (25% chance per individual). T he results of keye d

use are noted in each area description.

Since the access p o rt a l s leading to Vanrakdoom fro m

t he outer world transport users to the Laby r i nt h, it is re a-

sonably likely that the PCs will enter the complex he re.

KEY TO VANRAKDOOM

T he following sections describe the individual cham-

bers that make up the temple now known as Va n r a k-

doom. T he locations are keyed to the map of the temple.

V1. West Adepts Quarters (EL Varies)

T hese rooms are simply furnished barracks for the

t e m p l es low - l e vel clerics, who belong to a loosely

o r g a n i zed temple subcult called the Adepts of the

Night. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

approach any of these chambers.

Each of these rooms is furnished with a washbasin

and two to four cots. At the foot of each bed is a

small chest.

T hese sparsely furnished rooms are home to the male

Adepts of the Night and their immediate superiors.

Creatures: Two to four clerics share each of these

small ro o m s. Because they are on differe nt shifts, at

least half of the occupants are out performing temple

duties at any given time.

A total of thirty male Adepts of the Night (primarily

humans and half-o rcs) are based in the temple. No

matter when the PCs arrive, 4d4 male Adepts of the

V2. Hall of Sacred Shadows (EL Varies)

This hallway is the main artery used by living residents

of the temple. Read or paraphrase the following whe n

the PCs arrive.

This long, arc hed hallway appears to run nearly

half  the  length  of  the  temple.  T he  walls  are

adorned with images of the endless war betwe e n

Shar and Selne, and all of them show the follow-

ers of the Moonmaiden suffering horrific losses to

the forces of darkness.

Just about all of the temples inhabitants walk this corri-

dor from time to time. It connects the barracks used to

house Sh a rs followers (areas V1, V3, V12, and V 1 8 )

with the rest of the temple.

T he door at the eastern end of this corridor is not

locked and opens into a room containing a large, odif-

erous refuse pit.

Cre a t u res: At any given time, 2d8 NPCs of yo u r

choice are walking to and from various destinations

along this hallway.

Treasure: Anyone the PCs encounter in this corri-

dor has only the items she usually carries.

V3. North Barracks (EL varies)

T hese sparsely furnished rooms are home to a cont i n-

g e nt of the temples defenders. Read or paraphrase the

following when the PCs enter.

T hese rooms appear to be simply furnished bar-

racks for temple soldiers. Each contains four cots

and a washbasin. At the foot of each bed stands a

small chest.

These sparsely furnished rooms house the temple fight-

ers, who are known as Shadow Guards.

Creatures: Four fighters share each of these small

rooms. Because they are on different shifts, at least half

of the occupants are out performing temple duties at

any given time.

A total of forty Sh a d ow Guards are based in the

temple. No matter when the PCs arrive, 4d6 male or

female Shadow Guards are resting and relaxing in these

ro o m s. Use the following statistics, altering as desire d .

D Shadow Guards (40): Male or female human

or half-o rc fighter 7; hp 57 each; see Dungeon Ma s t e rs

Guide page 117.

Tactics: If attacked, the Shadow Guards attempt to

make a stand in the common room (area V5) so that

t hey can take adva ntage of the pungi stick barricades.

Tre a s u re: Each chest contains the personal items

of the ow n e r. Choose tre a s u re appropriate for the

Encounter Level used.

V4. North Armory (EL Varies)

T he two 15-f o o t -s qu a re rooms just east of V3 serve as

armories for the Sh a d ow Guards who are based in are a

V3. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

arrive.

Weapons and armor of all sorts line the walls and

floor of this room. Lo n g s w o rds and chain shirt s

appear to be the most numerous items in each of

those categories.

T he Sh a d ow Guards keep extra armor and weapons of

their preferred types here.

V5. South Common Room (EL Varies)

This area serves as a common room for the south bar-

racks (V6). At any given time, 2d6 Shadow Guards may

be relaxing here.

V6. South Barracks (EL Varies)

This set of rooms is essentially identical to area V3. The

two 15-f o o t -s qu a re rooms nearby are armories, and

both are identical to V4.

Cre a t u res:  T hese  chambers  house  the  same

number of Shadow Guards as area V3, broken down by

level in the same manner.

D Sh a d ow Gu a rds (40): Female human or half-

o rc fighter 7; hp 57 each; see Dungeon Ma s t e rs Guide

page 117.

V7. East Adepts Quarters (EL Varies)

This set of rooms is essentially identical to area V1. It s

c h a mbers house the same number of Adepts of the

Night and Watchers as area V1 does, except that all the

occupants of this area are female.

V8. Mess Hall (EL Varies)

This room serves as the primary dining hall for the

temple. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

arrive.

This squ a re chamber looks like a standard dining

hall. Five low, round tables surrounded by simple

wooden chairs are scattered about the room.

The temples occupants come here for meals at any time

of the day or night.

Cre a t u re s : PCs who enter this chamber have an

80% chance of encountering 2d8 NPCs from elsewhere

in the temple (DMs choice) here.

V9. Kitchen (EL Varies)

In this chamber, food is prepared for all the inhabitants

of the complex. Read or paraphrase the following when

the PCs arrive.

The warmth of a large, lit hearth makes this rooms

t e m p e r a t u re  almost  tolerable. T h ree  massive

tables in the center of the chamber are littere d

with food and cutlery that have appare ntly been

used in the preparation of the next meal.

K i t c hen duty rotates among the lesser adepts. T he

t e m p l es population is large enough that someone is

almost always looking for a meal, so food pre p a r a t i o n

occurs 24 hours a day.

The two rooms to the south of the kitchen are fully

stocked pantries.

Cre a t u res: At any given time, 2d8 Adepts of the

Night are engaged in food preparation herein.

D Adepts of the Ni g h t : See area V1 for statistics.

V10. West Labyrinth (EL 16+)

The western portion of the Labyrinth looks like all the

other sections (areas V16, V17, V20, and V24), and like

those, it has its own guardian. Read or paraphrase the

following when the PCs arrive.

T he  smooth  stone  walls  of  these  tunnels  are

devoid of any markings, and the corridors seem to

twist and turn without reason.

Tr a p s : This area includes three pit traps lined with

poisoned spikes.

a Poisoned Spiked Pit Traps (3): CR 10; see

Dungeon Masters Guide page 74.

Each of the three pit traps in this area can be locked

or unlocked by a lever in the control panel on the south

wall of the control room (area V16).

Cre a t u re: This area is patrolled by a nightwalker,

which acts in concert with the other four of its ilk in

areas V16, V17, V20, and V24.

D Ni g h t w a l k e r : hp 178; see Nightshade ent ry,

see Monster Manual page 196.

Other Fe a t u re s : This area includes one shifting

wall and one portal.

s Shifting Wa l l : T he shifting wall in this cham-

ber moves north/south and is cont rolled by the we s t-

ernmost lever in the control room of area V16. The wall

can also be forcibly moved by pushing it and making a

successful DC 30 Strength check.

s Po rt a l : T he one p o rt a l in this area  has part i a l l y

malfunctioned. It serves as the terminus of three  dif-

f e re nt  p o rt a l s:  the  one -way  p o rt a l f rom  the  more

7

western of the two small rooms north of area V11, the

p o rt a l in area V17, and the southern p o rt a l in area V 2 0 .

With a sliver of basalt as a key, it acts as a one- w a y

p o rt a l to the terminus in area V24. With a sliver of

black marble as a key, it acts as a one-way p o rt a l to the

n o rt hern p o rt a l in area V20. With a holy symbol of

Shar as a key, it acts as a two -way malfunctioning

p o rt a l that connects with the Plane of Sh a d ow. Used in

this way, it transports the user to a swamplike dark-

land near Sh a rs Palace of Loss (see Pl a ye rs Guide to

Fa e r  n page 163). A nightcrawler (Monster Ma n u a l

page 195) guards this terminus and feeds on those

foolish enough to come through the p o rt a l .

Because it has malfunctioned, this p o rt a l acts as a

minor planar breach (see Planar Ha n d b o o k page 151) to

t he Plane of Sh a d ow. Because of this effect, the hallway

to the north and west of it has the enhanced magic

trait of the Plane of Sh a d ow (see Pl a ye rs Guide to Fa e r  n

page 163).

V11. Dungeon (EL Varies)

This room serves as the tort u re chamber for prisoners

of the Sh a d ow Guard s. Read or paraphrase the follow-

ing when the PCs arrive.

Moonmaiden. Few retain more than a small measure of

their original sanity.

D Prisoners: Male or female human or elf com-

moner 1; hp 3.

Other Features: The dungeon area contains four

portals.

s Portals: Use of any portal in this area without a

key transports the user to area V23 (50% chance per

individual), area V39 (25% chance per individual) or

area V40 (25% chance per individual).

W hen a piece of basalt is used as a key, the p o rt a l s

operate as follows.

The one-way portal in the west room on the north wall

transports the user to the portal in area V10.

The one-way portal in the east room on the north wall

transports the user to the portal in area V17.

The one-way portal in the north room on the east wall

transports the user to the northern portal in area V20.

The one-way portal in the south room on the east wall

transports the user to the portal in area V24.

This 20-foot squ a re room is lined with doors

two on the nort hern wall and two on the eastern

wall. An archway on the south wall opens onto a

spiral staircase leading down. Four manacles are

embedded in a man-sized stone table in the center

of the ro o m, and spots of dried blood dot the

tables surface.

If the PCs descend the stairs from V11, read or para-

phrase the following.

This long, dank hallway is lined with cells. Fro m

some emanate the piercing cries of lost souls;

from others wafts the musky odor of death.

T he dungeon still serves its original purposet o

imprison and torture captives.

Tr a p : A pit trap (identical to those in area V 1 0 )

blocks the entrance to this room. T he trap is usually

locked and not functioning, but the Sh a d ow Guard s

unlock it when they pour through this room on the i r

way to the Labyrinth via the portals.

a Poisoned Spiked Pit Trap: CR 10; see Dun-

geon Masters Guide page 74.

Cre a t u res: At any given time, these cells collec-

tively house 2d122 prisoners. Most are unlucky slaves

purchased in the markets of Skullport, or travelers kid-

napped and then forgotten, or captured followers of the

V12. Shadowstalkers Quarters (EL Varies)

T hese rooms are simply furnished barracks for mem-

of these small ro o m s. Because they are on differe nt

shifts, at least half of the occupants are out performing

temple duties at any given time.

A total of fifty Sh a d owstalkers (primarily humans

and half-o rcs) are based in the temple. While some

Sneak Attack (Ex ) : T he shadowdancer deals 4d6

extra points of damage on any successful attack against

flat-footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has

been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. T h i s

damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up

to 30 feet away. Cre a t u res with concealment, cre a t u re s

without discernible anatomies, and cre a t u res immune

to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to

sneak attacks. The shadowdancer may choose to deliver

nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when

using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap

(blackjack).

Evasion (Ex ) : If the shadowdancer is exposed to

any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex

saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage

with a successful saving throw.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex ) : T he shadowd a n c e r

can hide in while within 10 feet of a shadow even while

being observed.

Trapfinding (Ex ) : T he shadowdancer can find,

d i s a r m, or bypass traps with a DC of 20 or highe r. She

can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device

skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the

spell used to create it). If her Disable Device re s u l t

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, she discovers how

to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex ) : T he  shadowd a n c e r

retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class eve n

w hen flat-footed or targeted by an unseen foe. (She

still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or othe r-

wise immobile.)

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 buckler, +1 short

sword, +1 shortbow with 20 arrows, 2 potions of cure moder-

ate wounds, 100 gp.

This room is re s e rved for visiting guests. Read or para-

phrase the following when the PCs enter.

This bedchamber is handsomely appointed with

an old four-poster bed, a table, a chair, and a

w a s h b a s i n .

For the past few tendays, the temple has hosted Tharag

t he De voted, a half-o rc emissary of the Monks of the

Da rk Moon. He is curre ntly engaged in discussions

with Lo rd Vanrak and the temples senior clergy as to

w he t her his order should base a group of monks in

Vanrakdoom.

Cre a t u re : At any given time, Tharag has a 20%

chance to be resting or reading in this room. Ot he r-

wise, he is with either Lo rd Vanrak or a senior night-

cloak (see areas V26, V28, V41, V42, or V43).

those rooms.

Cre a t u res:  A  lecture may be  occurring  (20%

chance) at any time in this chamb e r. If so, 1d2 senior

NPCs from the temple are lecturing, and 4d6 Adepts of

This chamber functions as a lesser chapel for the fol-

lowers of Shar. Read or paraphrase the following when

the PCs arrive.

An almost palpable aura of dread cloaks this re c-

tangular room. Atop a low, basalt dais in the center

of the chamber stands a black marble statue of a

nude human female. Twin basalt pillars, each 6

feet tall, flank this dark altar. Atop each pillar

c ro u c hes a black gargoyle with great shadow y

w i n g s, curling horns, a lashing tail, a blank face,

and pale, lifeless orbs in lieu of eyes. These dread-

ful statues appear to have been sculpted fro m

purest night.

T he inhabitants of the temple usually use this chapel

for private devotions to the Da rk Lady. In the smaller

rooms to the west and the east of the main altar stand

smaller altars used for private devotions.

Cre a t u re: Two nighthaunts in the service of Sh a r

guard the altars here. They permit only followers of the

Da rk Lady (whom they re c o g n i ze by a secret sign

k n own only to inhabitants of the temple) to worship

herein.

The PCs also have a 10% chance to find a follower of

V16. Central Labyrinth and Control Room

(EL 16+)

This section of the Laby r i nth is basically identical to

area V10. At its center, however, is an octagonal control

room that features four large leve r s, each of which

operates  a  shifting  wall  somew he re  within  the

L a by r i nth. On the south wall is a panel of smaller

n o rth or south face, or DC 30 from the east or we s t

face) can also force it to move.

s Eastern Shifting Wa l l : This wall is 30 feet

long and moves east/west. It is cont rolled by the

western lever in the cont rol room of area V16. A suc-

cessful St rength check (DC 30 from the east or we s t

face, or DC 50 from the north face) can also force it

to move .

s Portal: The portal at the western end of this sec-

tion serves as the terminus of three differe nt p o rt a l s i n

other locations: a one-way portal from the eastern small

room north of area V11, the northern portal in area V20,

and the p o rt a l in area V24. With a sliver of basalt as a

k e y, it functions as a one-way p o rt a l that transports the

user to the terminus in area V10. With a sliver of black

marble as a key, it becomes a one-way p o rt a l leading to

t he southern p o rt a l in area V20. With a holy symbol of

Shar as a key, it acts as a two-way portal leading to a cave

in the depths of Kryptgarden Forest.

V18. Darkweavers Quarters (EL Varies)

T hese  rooms house the sorc e rers devoted to the Da rk

L a d y. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

enter.

T hese rooms appear to be simply furnished bar-

r a c k s. Each contains two to four cots and a wash-

basin. At the foot of each bed stands a small chest.

T hese sparsely furnished rooms are home to memb e r s

of the sorc e rous subcult known as Da rk we a vers and

their immediate superiors.

Creatures: Two to four Darkweavers share each of

these small rooms. Because they are on different shifts,

at least half of the occupants are out performing temple

duties at any given time.

A total of forty Da rk we a vers (primarily humans

and half-d row) are based in the temple. T hese individ-

uals play a wide variety of roles within the temple.

Some supplement the Sh a d ow Guard patro l s, and

o t hers have temple duties, but most work outside the

temple on the Da rk Ladys behalfsometimes for ten-

days or months at a time. No matter when the PCs

a r r i ve, 4d4 male or female Da rk we a vers and 1d31

s h a d ow  adepts  are  resting  and  relaxing  in  the s e

ro o m s. Use the following statistics.

ful saving throw and half damage if the saving

throw fails.

Speak with Master (Ex ) : T he cat can

communicate verbally with the shadow adept.

Ot her cre a t u res do not understand the commu-

nication without magical help.

Skills: A cat has a +4 racial bonus on Climb,

Hide, and Move Si l e ntly checks and a +8 racial

bonus on Jump che c k s. A cat has a +8 racial

bonus on Balance che c k s. It uses its De x t e r i t y

cial benefits from having a familiar. This creature grants

her a +3 bonus on Move Si l e ntly checks (included in

the above statistics).

Al e rtness (Ex ) : * T he familiar grants its master Alert-

ness as long as it is within 5 feet.

V19. Bathing Pool (EL Varies)

T he temple re s i d e nts use this chamber for bathing.

An  ova l -shaped  pool  dominates  this  sharply

tapered room.

Small drains discreetly take overflow water away, chan-

neling it into the depths of the pool in area V25.

Cre a t u re s : Gi ven the large number of occupant s

the temple has, this room is usually in use. At any given

time, the PCs have an 80% chance of encountering 2d8

b a t hers he re. In addition, Adepts of the Night carry

water from area V25 to area V9 to be warmed, the n

bring it here.

D Adepts of the Night: hp 10 or 16; see area V1

for statistics.

De vel o p m e nt : T he levers in the small room due

west of area V19 can be used to drain this pool com-

pletely and to flush it with cold water via a hidden pipe

from area V22.

V20. North Labyrinth (EL 16+)

This portion of the Labyrinth is similar to area V10 and

contains the same kind of guardian. Read or paraphrase

the following when the PCs arrive.

T he  smooth  stone  walls  of  these  tunnels  are

devoid of any markings, and the corridors seem to

twist and turn without reason.

Trap: This area contains one large pit trap, which func-

tions like those in area V10 (although it is four times as

large). It is controlled by one of the levers in the panel

on the south wall of the control room (area V16).

a L a r g e Poisoned Spiked Pit Tr a p : CR 10;

see Dungeon Masters Guide page 74.

Other Fe a t u re s : This area contains one shifting

wall and two portals.

s Shifting Wa l l : T he shifting wall in the south-

western portion of this chamber is 10 feet long and

m oves east/west. It is cont rolled by the second leve r

f rom the west in the cont rol room of area V16. It can

also be forcibly moved by pushing it and making a suc-

cessful DC 30 Strength check.

s Po rtals: T he nort hern p o rt a l in this section serve s

as the terminus of three differe nt p o rt a l s in other loca-

tions: a one-way p o rt a l f rom the more nort hern of the two

small rooms east of area V11, the p o rt a l in area V10, and

t he southern p o rt a l in this area. With a sliver of basalt as a

k e y, it acts as a one-way p o rt a l leading to the terminus in

a rea V17. With a sliver of black marble as a key, it func-

tions as a one-way p o rt a l leading to the terminus in are a

V24. With a holy symbol of Shar as a key, it acts as a two-

way p o rt a l that connects with a cave high above the Tr a d e

Wa y, amidst the mountains of the Cloud Peaks of Amn.

T he southern p o rt a l in this section of the Laby r i nt h

serves as the terminus of two different portals: the one-

way portal in area V17, and the portal in area V24. With a

sliver of basalt as a key, it acts as a one-way portal to the

n o rt hern terminus in this area. With a sliver of black

marble as a key, it functions as a one-way p o rt a l to the

portal in area V10. With a holy symbol of Shar as a key,

it acts as a two-way p o rt a l that connects with a deep,

heavily shadowed vale in the hills west of the Sh a d ow

Sea, within sight of the City of Shade.

V21. Privy (EL 3+)

This room is the temples only designated privy. Read or

paraphrase the following when the PCs enter.

T he unmistakable odor of a privy wafts from this

c h a mb e r. Within its confines, wooden walls pro-

vide privacy for up to five occupants.

1 2

Gi ven the temples large number of occupant s, the

privy is barely up to its task.

Cre a t u re s : Two Adepts of the Night are assigned

to this room at all times. T heir duties are to ensure

that the privy remains as clean as possible. T h u s, both

a re constantly busy gathering up chamber pots and

dumping them into the refuse pit in the small room at

t he east end of area V2. At any given time, the PCs

h a ve a 90% chance of encountering at least one adept

he re i n, plus 1d6-1 living NPCs from other areas of the

c o m p l e x .

V24. East Labyrinth (EL 16+)

This portion of the labyrinth is similar to area V10 and

contains the same kind of guardian. Read or paraphrase

the following when the PCs arrive.

T he  smooth  stone  walls  of  these  tunnels  are

devoid of any markings, and the corridors seem to

twist and turn without reason.

Cre a t u res: As with area V10, a nightwalker guard s

this chamber.

D Adepts of the Night (2): Male human cleric 1;

D Nightwalker: hp 178; see Nightshade ent ry,

hp 10 each; see Dungeon Masters Guide page 114.

Monster Manual page 196.

V22. Sargauth Stream

T he stream that runs through this area serves as the

temples water supply. Read or paraphrase the following

when the PCs arrive.

A large hearth carved to resemble the gaping maw

of a purple worm disgorges a small trickle of

water. The stream pools in the center of the room

b e f o re draining away through shallow channels

beneath the three exit doors.

T he worms mouth holds the terminus of a one- w a y

p o rt a l f rom the depths of the River Sargauth near

Sk u l l p o rt.  T h rough  it  comes  a  small  trickle  of

potable water that feeds the pool in area V25 and

keeps the natural cisterns in the surrounding cham-

bers full.

V23. Portal Prison (EL Varies)

This rectangular chamber is wholly embedded in

solid rock and reachable only via p o rt a l s . It serves as a

prison cell for int ruders who dare to use the temples

p o rt a l s .

This empty, featureless room is about 20 feet wide

and 60 feet in length.

W hen the p o rt a l s in the dungeon (area V11) and the

Labyrinth (areas V10, V16, V17, V20, and V24) are used

without a key, they serve as one-way p o rt a l s that trans-

port the users here (50% chance) or to area V39 or V40

(25% chance each). Those who come here are generally

just left to die. Once in a while, followers of Shar who

can use the s h a d ow walk ability come and empty the

room of its contents.

Cre a t u re s : At any given time, this chamber con-

tains the decaying remains of 1d101 humanoid cre a-

t u re s. At your discre t i o n, it may also contain one or

more living prisoners (DMs choice).

Other Fe a t u re s : This area contains two shifting

walls and one portal.

s No rthern Shifting Wa l l : This wall is 20 feet

long and moves east/west. It is cont rolled by the second

l e ver from the east in the cont rol room of V16. A success-

ful St rength check (DC 20 from the north or south face, or

DC 30 from the east or west face) can also force it to move.

s Southern Shifting Wa l l : This wall is 10 feet

long and moves east/west. It is cont rolled by the we s t-

ern lever in the control room of area V16. A successful

St rength check (DC 30 from the east or west face, or

DC 50 from the north face) can also force it to move .

s Po rtals: T he p o rt a l at the southeastern end of

this section serves as the terminus of three differe nt

p o rt a l s in other locations: a one-way p o rt a l f rom the

more southern of the two small rooms east of area V11,

t he p o rt a l in area V10, and the nort hern p o rt a l in are a

V20. With a sliver of basalt as a key, it functions as a

one-way portal that transports the user to the terminus

in area V17. With a sliver of black marble as a key, it

becomes a one-way portal leading to the southern portal

in area V20. With a holy symbol of Shar as a key, it acts

as a two-way p o rt a l that connects with a small cave on

the western bank of the River Reaching, just within the

northern fringe of the Reaching Wood.

V25. Pool of Darkness (EL 9)

T he temple re s i d e nts use this chamber for bathing.

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs arrive.

This chamber houses a large, rectangular pool

filled with inky black water. A small stream of

dark water runs under a door at the east end of the

n o rth wall to feed the pool, making a soft shush-

ing sound. Gentle ripples in the water suggest that

some creature may lurk beneath the surface.

Despite its dangerous appearance, this water is safe to

drink. A small crack at the bottom of the pool drains

the water down into the Underdark.

1 3

Cre a t u re : An advanced shadow jelly from the

Plane of Shadow lurks herein.

Tactics: The advanced shadow jelly attacks anyone

who touches the water or stands next to the pool,

e xcept for characters opening displaying the holy

s y mbol of Sh a r. (Although the cre a t u re is nonint e l l i-

g e nt, the Da rk Ma i d e ns hand stays it from attacking

her followers.)

D Ad vanced Sh a d ow Jel l y : CR 9; Huge ooze

23, Dex 1, Con 22, Int , Wis 1, Cha 1.

Skills and Feats: Climb +14, Hide 13.

Im p roved Grab (Ex ) : To use this ability, an

a d vanced shadow jelly must hit with its slam attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opport u n i t y. If it

wins the grapple che c k, it establishes a hold and can

automatically deal 1d8 points of St rength damage

each ro u n d .

St rength  Damage  (Su ) : T he  touch  of  an

a d vanced shadow jelly deals 1d8 points of St re n g t h

damage to a living foe. A creature reduced to Strength 0

by an advanced shadow jelly dies. This is a negative

energy effect.

Oo ze  Tr a i t s : An  advanced  shadow  jelly  is

immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, polymor-

phing, and mind-influencing effects. It is not subject to

critical hits or flanking. Shadow jellies are blind.

Tre a s u re : On the bottom of the pool lies a long-

forgotten relic called Su n g l o ry, which is sacred to the

f o l l owers of Lathander. A company of Lathanderites

once tracked a noted Sharran assassin through a

mysterious p o rt a l to his base in Va n r a k d o o m, int e n d-

ing to stage a raid on the Sharran stronghold. In the

confusion of the ensuing wild battle, a Knight of the

Aster dropped Su n g l o ry in the pool as he died. T he

Sharrans never re a l i zed that their foes had possessed

a weapon of such wort h, so they never looked for it

after the fight.

Su n g l o ry is a heavy mace that is equ i va l e nt to a s u n

b l a d e (see the description on page 228 of the D u n g e o n

Ma s t e r s Guide, but replace all re f e rences to bastard

s w o rd with heavy mace and all re f e rences to s h o rt

sword with light mace.)

V26. Quarters of the Hands of Shar (EL Varies)

T hese modestly furnished chambers house the senior

priests of the ord e r. Read or paraphrase the follow i n g

when the PCs approach any of these chambers.

Each of these rooms is furnished with a washbasin

and two to four cots. At the foot of each bed is a

small chest.

Several senior Watchers and the select group known as

the Hands of Shar live in these chambers.

Cre a t u res: Four of the senior temple personnel

s h a re each of these small ro o m s. Because they are on

d i f f e re nt shifts, at least half of the occupants are out

performing temple duties at any given time.

A total of twe nty Wa t c hers and ten Hands of Sh a r

a re based in the temple. Six of the Wa t c hers are gar-

risoned in areas V1 and V7; the rest live here. No matter

w hen the PCs arrive, 3d4 watchers and 2d4 Hands of

Shar are resting and relaxing in these ro o m s. Use the

following statistics.

D Watchers (14): Male or female human cleric 6 of

Da rkness Spel l s : A Hand of Shar can pre p a re

any Da rkness domain spell as if it we re on her divine

spell list. T he spell uses a spell slot equal to its level in

the Darkness domain list.

Eyes of Shar (Ex ) : T he Hand of Sh a rs eyes are

totally black, granting her darkvision to a range of 60

feet. She can also see through magical darkness to a

range of 10 feet in the same black-and-white sight that

darkvision provides. She cannot be blinded by magical

effects.

Shadow Talk (Su): The Hand of Shar can commu-

nicate mystically through the shadows of the mind. She

can whisper short messages to other worshipers of Shar

within 500 feet. All Shar worshipers within range of

t he  message  hear  it  as  a  whisper  in  their  minds.

Ob s e rvers can hear the words if they are close enough

to physically hear the Hand of Shars actual whispers (a

DC 15 Listen check if the listener is within 10 feet,

1 4

+1 DC per 5 feet beyond that). Sh a d ow talk is a lan-

guage-dependant free action, and it can be used to com-

municate with undead worshipers of Shar and undead

creatures in the service of Shar worshipers.

V27. Shadowstone Hall (EL Varies)

This chamber serves as a sort of art gallery in which the

temple re s i d e nts can take their leisure. Read or para-

phrase the following when the PCs arrive.

Eight black marble bases line this hall, four on

each side. Five of the bases (four on the right, one

on the left) are empty, while the other three are

occupied with black crystalline statues.

The first statue depicts a massive bear of a man

with a thick beard, a great belly, and a wild mane

of hair. His thickly muscled arms are open wide,

as if he is encompassing all the world in his grasp.

He wears the flowing robes of a priest of Sh a r.

T he second statue depicts a tall, graceful woman

of Ne t he rese heritage with long flowing hair. She

wears a thin shift and a forbidding expre s s i o n .

The third statue depicts a tiny, wizened woman

of Calishite heritage. She is dressed in traditional

Shoon robes and poised as if dancing.

During the rule of Clan Me l a i rk y n, statues of Me l a i r-

b o d es greatest kings adorned the bases in this hall.

Lord Vanrak had the dwarven statues destroyed, and he

is slowly replacing them with statues depicting the

most favored servants of the Lady of Loss.

Cre a t u re s : T he  PCs  have  a  15%  chance  to

e n c o u nter 1d4 of the temples re s i d e nts (DMs choice)

in this hall at any given time.

De vel o p m e nt : Once  the  PCs  have  defeated

anyone they find in the hall, they can examine the stat-

ues more closely.

T he first statue depicts Go rothir of Sh a r, the Da rk

P ro p het of the Night (see area V44 for furt her details).

A successful DC 30 Knowledge (history) check is

required to identify him.

T he second statue is of Dahlia, also known as the

Queen of the Nightthe greatest high priestess of the

Reign of Night in the Netherese city of Sepulcher. The

Queen of the Night led the entire Netherese church in

her day and successfully transformed the port city of

Sepulcher into a bastion of Sharran might.

T he third statue depicts Irtemara el Eradsari, the

Dancer before Da w n, who is the debauched and jaded

high priestess of the Temple of Old Night in Calimport.

Since Irtemara still live s, her inclusion in this collec-

tion is a subtle slight by Lo rd Va n r a k, suggesting that

his rivals time has passed.

Tre a s u re : T he statues are fashioned from black

chalcedony that has been magically transformed (using

Tro b r i a n ds glassteel, a new spell from City of Sp l e n d o r s :

Waterdeep) into a transparent material with the durabil-

ity of steel. Each is worth 2,000 gp for materials alone,

and as much as three times that amount to a collector of

religious or historical objects of art.

V28. Darklord and Krinth Quarters (EL varies)

This complex serves as living qu a rters for Sh a rs most

senior servants and special guests. The five rooms to the

west of the hallway are occupied by senior temple per-

sonnel, and the tangle of int e rconnected rooms to the

east houses krinth refugees from the City of Shade who

were rescued and brought here by Lord Vanrak.

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

enter any of the western rooms.

T hese rooms are finely furnished and obv i o u s l y

designed for single occupant s. Each contains one

bed draped in fine linen, a crystal washbasin, an

oak table and chair, and a small bookshelf filled

with books. At the foot of each bed is a small che s t .

T hese rooms are home to the senior leaders of the

c h u rc h, who are known as Da rk l o rds and Da rk l a d i e s.

Creatures: Each chamber has only one occupant.

Because they work differe nt shifts within the temple,

only two are in their rooms at any given time.

Da rkness Spel l s : Vanrak can pre p a re any Da rk-

ness domain spell as if it we re on his divine spell list.

The spell uses a spell slot equal to its level in the Dark-

ness domain list.

Disk of Night (Su ) : Any chakram used by a

Darklady is treated as if it were a +2 returning chakram. If

it remains out of her hand for more than 1 round, it

reverts to its original abilities.

Eyes of Shar (Ex): The Darkladys eyes are totally

black, granting her darkvision to a range of 60 feet. She

can also see through magical darkness to a range of 10

feet in the same black-and-white sight that dark v i s i o n

p rov i d e s. She cannot be blinded by magical effects.

Sh a d ow Talk (Su ) : T he Da rklady can communi-

cate mystically through the shadows of the mind. She

can whisper short messages to other worshipers of Shar

within 500 feet. All Shar worshipers within range of

t he  message  hear  it  as  a  whisper  in  their  minds.

Ob s e rvers can hear the words if they are close enough

to physically hear the Darkladys actual whispers (a DC

15 Listen check if the listener is within 10 feet, +1 DC

per 5 feet beyond that). Sh a d ow talk is a language -

dependant free action, and it can be used to communi-

cate with undead worshipers of Shar and undead cre a-

tures in the service of Shar worshipers.

Sh a r s Caress (Su ) : Vanrak can surround a he l d

c h a k r a m, whip, or dagger with Sh a d ow We a ve magic,

giving the weapon the unholy property for 1 round per

use. The Darklady can invoke this power as a free action

once per day. She must decide to use this ability before

t he attack is made, and if the attack misses, that use of

Shars caress is wasted.

b a rd spell modify memories. T he Da rklady can use this

ability once per tenday as a 10th-level bard.

Del i ver Touch Spel l s : Mirra may delive r

touch spells for her master.

Im p roved Evasion (Ex ) : If Semione is

exposed to any effect that normally allows her to

attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage,

s he takes no damage with a successful saving

t h row and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Speak with Master (Ex ) : Mirra can com-

municate verbally with Semione. Other creatures

do not understand the communication without

magical help.

Skills: Mirra has a +4 racial bonus on Climb,

Hide, and Move Si l e ntly checks and a +8 racial

bonus on Jump checks. She has a +8 racial bonus

on Balance checks. She uses her Dexterity modi-

fier instead of her St rength modifier for Climb

and Jump checks. **In areas of tall grass or heavy

undergrowth, the Hide bonus rises to +8.

Familiar Benefits: Semione gains special bene-

fits from having a familiar. This creature grants her a +3

bonus on Move Silently checks (included in the above

statistics).

Al e rtness (Ex ) : * Mirra grants her master Alertness as

long as she is within 5 feet.

Empathic Link (Su ) : Semione can communicate tele-

pathically with her familiar at a distance of up to 1 mile.

T he master has the same connection to an item or a

place that the familiar does.

casts on herself also affect her familiar if the latter is

within 5 feet at the time. She may also cast a spell with

a target of You on her familiar.

bonus on saving throws against spells from the schools

of enchant m e nt, illusion, and necro m a n c y, as well as

spells with the darkness descriptor.

Shadow Walk (Sp): Semione can use shadow walk

(caster level 7th) once per day.

Shield of Shadows (Su): Semione can surround

herself with a globe of purple-black force as a standard

action. This shield of shadows functions like a s h i e l d

spell, granting her a +4 shield bonus to AC and absorb-

ing magic missiles cast at he r. In addition, the shield of

s h a d ows provides concealment (20% miss chance)

against melee and ranged attacks. Semione can see and

reach through the shield, so it does not provide cove r

or concealment to opponent s. Semione may use a

shield of shadows for up to 14 rounds per day. T h i s

duration need not be consecutives he may break it

up into increments as small as 1 round if she so desires.

Creating  or dismissing the shield of shadows is a

standard action.

L a n g u a g e s : Abyssal, Chondathan, Common,

Draconic.

Sneak Attack (Ex ) : R a i nt her deals 4d6 extra

p o i nts of damage on any successful attack against flat-

footed or flanked targets, or against a target that has

been denied its Dexterity bonus for any reason. T h i s

damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up

to 30 feet away. Cre a t u res with concealment, cre a t u re s

without discernible anatomies, and cre a t u res immune

to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to

sneak attacks. Raint her may choose to deliver non-

lethal damage with his sneak attack, but only whe n

using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap

(blackjack).

Darkvision (Su): Rainther can see in the dark as

though he were permanently under the effect of a dark-

vision spell.

De fe n s i ve Roll (Ex ) : R a i nt her can roll with a

p o t e ntially lethal blow to take less damage from it.

Once per day, when he would be reduced to 0 or fewer

hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or

other blow, not a spell or special ability), he can attempt

to roll with the damage. He makes a Reflex saving

throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only

half damage from the blow. He must be aware of the

attack and able to react to it in order to execute his

d e f e n s i ve roll. If he is in a situation that would deny

him any Dexterity bonus to AC, he cant attempt a

defensive spell.

Evasion (Ex): If Rainther is exposed to any effect

that normally allows him to attempt a Reflex saving

throw for half damage, he takes no damage with a suc-

cessful saving throw.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex ) : R a i nt her can hide

while within 10 feet of a shadow even while being

observed.

Im p roved Uncanny Dodge (Ex ) : R a i nt he r

cannot be flanked and can be sneak attacked only by a

character who has at least 19 levels of rogue.

Sh a d ow Illusion (Sp): R a i nt her can cre a t e

visual illusions from surrounding shadow s. This abil-

i t ys effect is identical to that of the arcane spell s i l e n t

image and may be employed once per day.

Shadow Jump (Su): Rainther can travel between

s h a d ows as if by means of a dimension door spell. T he

limitation is that the magical transport must begin and

end in an area with at least some shadow. Rainther can

jump up to a total of 80 feet each day in this manner;

this may be a single jump of 80 feet or two jumps of 40

feet each. This amount can be split among many jumps,

but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-f o o t

increment.

Sl i p p e ry Mind (Ex ) : This ability re p re s e nt s

R a i nt he rs ability to wriggle free from magical effects

that  would  othe rwise  cont rol  or  compel  him.  If

R a i nt her is affected by an enchant m e nt and fails his

saving throw, he can attempt his saving throw again 1

round later. He gets only this one extra chance to suc-

ceed on his saving throw. If it fails as well, the spells

effects occur normally.

Summon Shadow (Su): Rainther can summon a

s h a d ow (see Monster Ma n u a l page 221 for the shadows

s t a t i s t i c s, except that it has 2 extra Hit Dice, with the

re quisite increases to base attack bonus and save s ) .

Unlike a normal shadow, this ones alignment matche s

Rainthers, and the creature cannot be turned, rebuked,

or commanded by any third part y. This shadow serve s

as a companion to Raint her and can communicate

i ntelligibly  with  him.  If  a  shadow  companion  is

d e s t royed, or Raint her chooses to dismiss it, he must

attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save. If it fails, Rainther loses

3,000 XP, though his XP total can never drop below 0 as

t he result of a shadows dismissal or destruction. A

d e s t royed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be

replaced for 30 days.

Trapfinding (Ex ) : R a i nt her can find, disarm, or

bypass traps with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the

Se a rch skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to

disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used

to create it). If his Disable Device result exceeds the

traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass the

trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex ) : R a i nt her retains his De x-

terity bonus to Armor Class even when flat-footed or

targeted by an unseen foe. (He still loses his De x t e r i t y

bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile.)

Possessions: Amulet of natural armor +1, bracers of arm o r

+4, ring of protection +2, +2 keen short sword, +1 short b ow

with 20 arrow s, g l oves of Dexterity +2, hat of disguise, 200 gp.

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

e nter any of the chambers to the east of the hallway.

T hese rooms we re once finely appointed guest

qu a rters for visitors to the temple, but they now

bear witness to the extended occupancy of far less

civilized creatures. Each room has two to four cots

and a washbasin. At the foot of each bed is a small

chest of personal items.

T hese eastern rooms are now given over to krint h

V29. Darkfire Temple (EL 18+)

This  immense  chamber  once  housed  a  temple  to

Moradin. To honor the Lady of Lo s s, the followers of

Shar have transformed it into a twisted parody of the

Soulforgers original chapel. Read or paraphrase the fol-

lowing when the PCs open the doors.

The double doors part to reveal a 20-foot-wide pas-

sage that leads 50 feet eastward and then opens

i nto a vast room outfitted as a temple. Fa s h i o n e d

of black marble blocks inlaid with arcane ru n e s,

t he temple appears to be approximately 140 feet

deep and 100 feet wide. Its arc hed ceiling soars

some 60 feet above.

In the center of the temple is a vast forge lit by

black fire. Da rk, noxious smoke billows fort h

f rom it, obscuring all else within. A dozen or so

m a n-s i zed humanoids work the vast bellows that

m a i ntain the fire. In fro nt of the forge stands a

large  altar  made  of  ro u g h - hewn  granite  and

stained with rivers of dried blood.

Dimly visible beyond the billowing smoke is a

giant, black statue of a male dwarf with his hands

bound behind his back. His head is bowed, and he

has been shorn of his beard. Black tears appear to

gush forth from the statues empty eye sockets.

Along the south wall are additional forges,

each burning with the same black fire as the cen-

tral one. Two shadowy humanoid figures work a

smaller set of bellows to maintain each, and a

large,  still  figure,  barely  visible  through  the

smoke, stands nearby. Along the north wall stand

a few statues of humanoid figure s, but the details

are obscured by the smoke.

T he dwarf statue is in fact a he retical depiction of the

So u l f o r g e r. Any dwarf re c o g n i zes it as such automati-

c a l l y, and any other character can do so with a DC 15

Knowledge (religion) check.

The room actually contains five lesser forges spaced

e venly along the south wall. T he figures next to the m

a re Large statues of humiliated dwarf patriarc h s, each

depicted in the same manner as his god. The north wall

is lined with seven Medium statues, each of a human

wearing tattered black robes and beseeching the he a v-

ens for merc y. Behind the last of these statues, on the

north wall in the northeast corner of the room, is a con-

cealed door.

T he large forge in the center of the room and the five

smaller forges along the south wall are permanently lit

by billowing d a rk f i reMa g / Lo D, and each is considered an

altar to Sh a r. T he Sharran priests burn their offerings to

t he Lady of Loss within the d a rk f i re, thus ensuring that

t hey are truly lost once consumed.

As shown on the map, the forges produce a large

volume of smoke that envelops much of the temple.

Any living cre a t u re that spends 1 full round within an

area covered by smoke is affected as if by a stinking cloud

spell (caster level 12th).

T he five ye l l ow - g reen lines on the map re p re s e nt

sections of the floor that can be tilted up to form 5-foot-

h i g h, 6-inch-deep barriers. In the raised position, the y

function as obstacles, each of which costs 2 squ a res of

m ove m e nt to cro s s. Intended to pre ve nt charges and

other forms of fast movement, they are controlled by a

set of levers behind the altar. If forced to defend the

temple, Sh a rs followers stage a fighting withdrawal,

s l owly conceding each barrier as they re t reat. A suc-

cessful DC 15 Disable Device check lowers a 5-f o o t -

wide section of wall and prevents the lever mechanism

from raising it anew.

Creatures: The creatures working the bellows are

ogre zombies. Twelve of them attend the main bellows,

and two operate each of the lesser bellows.

T he clergy of Shar have transformed the defaced

idol of Moradin into a blackstone gigant. It in turn has

aided them in decorating this temple with statuary.

T he five statues that line the south wall we re once

shield dwarves. They were purchased as slaves in Skull-

port, attired as nobility, enlarged with magic, then pet-

rified by the blackstone gigant and placed he re by the

clergy of Shar to make a mockery of the temple that

once belonged to their kind. The seven statues that line

the northern wall were agents of House Moonstar who

we re captured by Lo rd Va n r a ks followe r s, petrified by

t he blackstone gigant, and placed he re as reminders to

any others who would try to challenge the power of

Sh a r. T he blackstone gigant can transform the statues

along the south wall into Large animated objects and

those along the north wall into Medium animated

objects by touch.

In addition, 2d8 worshipers of Shar are pre s e nt at

any given time. (Draw these from among the NPCs

described elsewhere in the adventure.) Furthermore, if

t he alarm has been raised, Lo rd Vanrak has assigned

t we l ve members of the Sh a d ow Guard (see area V3) to

defend the temple.

De vel o p m e nt : If the followers of Shar are hard

p ressed, those who cannot flee or choose not to do so

make their final stand in this room.

V30. Labyrinth Portal (EL 11+)

This chamber serves as the primary access to the con-

trol room (see area V16) in the Labyrinth.

This 15-f o o t -s qu a re chamber is empty save for a

large stone arch piercing the south wall. T he

swirling mists in the center of the arch suggest

that it may be a portal.

Four Hands of Shar (see area V26) are stationed here at

all times. They protect the portal and use it to access the

control room if intruders are reported in the Labyrinth.

V31. Wyrmwhisper Landing (EL 0, 2, or 3)

This chamber is the access point for the cavern complex

( a reas V31, V32, V33, and V35) claimed by the shadow

dragon Umb r a x a k a r, who serves as Va n r a ks steed. Re a d

or paraphrase the following when the PCs arrive .

Two large passageways provide egress from this

20-foot-square room. One corridor leads off to the

east, and the other gives access to a wide staircase

leading down to the south. Two crude cots are

tucked in the southeast corner of the room.

Two 2nd- l e vel Adepts of the Night (see areas V1 and V 7 )

a re stationed he re at all times. T heir assignment is to pass

messages from Umbraxakar (see area V33) to the othe r

i n h a b i t a nts of Vanrakdoom and to attend to any othe r

needs the dragon may have. T he PCs have a 95% chance of

finding one or both of the adepts he re at any given time.

V32. Wyrmhorde Cave (EL 0 or 16)

This  cavern  serves  as  the  temple  tre a s u ry  and  as

Umbraxakars bedchamber.

The walls of this natural cavern glisten with slime,

and the air is unnaturally cold. The cavern floor is

l i t t e red with the bones of many differe nt cre a-

tures. In the center of the room lies a great horde

of tre a s u re, spread out to form a wyrm-s i zed bed.

In addition to serving as Va n r a ks steed, Umb r a x a k a r

g u a rds the temple tre a s u ry by sleeping on it. He con-

Breath  Weapon  (Su ) : Umb r a x a k a rs  bre a t h

weapon is an 80-foot cone of billowing, smoky shadows

with an energy drain effect. Each cre a t u re within the

cone gains four negative leve l s. A successful DC 25

Reflex save halves the number of levels lost (ro u n d e d

d own). This same DC is used for the Fo rtitude save to

overcome the negative levels 24 hours later.

Frightful Presence (Ex ) : W he n e ver Umb r a x-

akar attacks, charges, or flies ove r head, each cre a t u re

within a radius of 210 feet that has fewer than 22 HD is

subject to the effect. A potentially affected creature that

succeeds on a DC 26 Will save remains immune to

Umbraxakars frightful presence for 24 hours. On a fail-

u re, a cre a t u re with 4 or fewer HD becomes panicked

for 4d6 ro u n d s, and one with 5 or more HD becomes

shaken for 4d6 rounds. Umbraxakar ignores the fright-

ful presence of other dragons.

S p ell-Like  Ab i l i t i e s : 3 / d a y m i r ror  image;

2/daydimension door. Caster level 7th.

S p el l s : Umbraxakar casts spells as a 7th-leve l

sorcerer.

Sh a d ow Blend (Su ) : In any condition of illumina-

tion other than full daylight, Umbraxakar can disappear

i nto the shadow s, gaining total concealment. Art i f i c i a l

i l l u m i n a t i o n, even a l i g h t or continual flame spell, does not

negate this ability. A d a y l i g h t spell, howe ve r, does.

V33. Lair of Umbraxakar (EL 0 or 16)

This cavern serves as the entrance chamber to Umbrax-

akars caverns.

C a rved stone steps lead up into a natural cave r n .

Its walls glisten with slime, its floor is strewn with

b o n e s, and the air is unusually cold. T h ree ro u g h

passages lead away into the darkness.

This cavern provides access to areas V32 and V35.

Cre a t u re : Umbraxakar has a 25% chance to be

here at any given time.

V34. Mastiff Masters Quarters (EL 11+)

This area once served as a small kitchen for the dwarves

of Clan Melairkyn.

This spacious, square room is almost comfortable,

g i ven the modicum of warmth provided by the

s l ow-burning coals in its great fireplace. Se ve r a l

tables placed throughout the room are cove re d

with the remnants of uneaten food and spilled ale,

and crude kegs line the wall.

V35. Sinkhole (EL 0 or 16)

This sinkhole near the rear of Umb r a x a k a rs lair twists

and turns down into the Un d e rd a rk. Read or para-

phrase the following when the PCs arrive.

A large sinkhole has opened in the floor at the

rear of this cavern. A hot, sulfurous breeze wafting

up from the hole suggests that it leads down int o

the depths of the earth.

Umbraxakar typically uses this route to reach his

normal hunting gro u n d s. T he path is twisting and tor-

tuous, and in some places the passage is so narrow that

Umbraxakar must employ magic to reduce his size .

V36. Kennel (EL 12)

The dwarves had hollowed out this cavern in search of

ore, but later abandoned it. Now it serves as the kennel

for the temples dogs.

NEW MAGIC ITEM

The Rod of Four Moons is the personal weapon of the

Moonmaiden. During lunar eclipses, Selne gives a

lesser replica of it to a champion of her faith as a

symbol of her covenant that her light will return.

tions as a +2 defending holy heavy mace. The wielder

can use each of the following spells once per day:

hold monster, lighting bolt, polymorph, and rope trick. To

A foul stench suggestive of carrion wafts up from

the cavern below. Narrow steps lead down into the

gloom, and beside them runs a greased slide caked

with bits of blood and rotten meat.

This rough stone cavern is home to a pack of twe l ve

s h a d ow mastiffs. Most of the temples inhabitants are

afraid to enter the cave, so they feed the hounds by

sending corpses down the slide into the cavern below.

D Shadow Mastiffs (12): hp 30 each; see Mon-

ster Manual page 22.

Tactics: If the extraplanar hounds smell intruders,

t hey withdraw into the shadows and wait. Once the i r

p rey  has  ent e red  the  cave r n,  the  shadow  mastiffs

attempt to encircle it before unleashing their baleful

howls.

Development: If the alarm is raised in the temple

but the int ruders cannot be found, twe l ve members of

the clergy who are skilled at handling shadow mastiffs

come get the dogs. T hey split up the cre a t u res int o

teams of two and order them to hunt down the int e r-

lopers by scent. If the priests believe that the intruders

got away via the Seadeeps, Vanrak dispatches a hunting

party that includes Grimtooth and all twelve mastiffs to

pursue them through Halasters Halls.

V37. Undercroft of Lost Souls (EL 12)

This  underc roft  once  housed  the  dead  of  Clan

Melairkyn, but the dwarven remains once interred here

h a ve been replaced by the fallen followers of the Da rk

Goddess.

Twe l ve statues of leering, grinning gargoyles line

this long hall. Be t ween each pair of adjacent stat-

ues (except for the first pair on either side) is a

low, narrow passageway lined with bas relief stone

plaques.

Shar teaches that the dead are lost, bitterly leaving

behind what they held in life. T h u s, these graves con-

tain no treasure.

Cre a t u re s : T he dwarves once buried he rein do

not rest easy. Ten of them have risen as spectres to

h a u nt the place whe re their remains once rested. Si x

n ow haunt the western re a c hes of the underc roft, and

the other four haunt the eastern reaches.

D S p e c t res (10): hp 45 each; see Monster Ma n u a l

page 232.

Ta c t i c s : T he ten spectres attack any cre a t u re that

d a res disturb their burial place, but the two groups do

not work in concert.

V38. Deepcrypts (EL 12)

These four crypts were commandeered by the Sharrans

to house the mortal remains of their most import a nt

priests. Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs

pass through any of the secret doors that give access to

the crypts.

Beyond the secret door, a narrow, sloping passage

leads downward. At the far end of the rectangular

c h a mb e r, a sarcophagus lies atop a narrow bier.

T he southernmost deepcrypt is flooded waist-high,

thanks to a natural spring that recently broke through a

crack in the floor. The others are dry.

Each of these chambers contains the remains of a

senior follower of Shar.

Tr a p : T he pit trap at the entrance to each crypt is

i d e ntical to the smaller version of the pit traps in the

Labyrinth (see area V10). The lever in the southeast sec-

tion of area V37 locks the traps.

a Poisoned Spiked Pit Traps (4): CR 10; see

Dungeon Masters Guide page 74.

Cre a t u re : Each crypt is haunted by a gre a t e r

shadow. Combat noise in any one crypt draws the other

shadows.

Ot her than its size, this chamber is identical to

a rea V 2 3 .

V40. Portal Prison

Ot her than its size, this chamber is identical to

a rea V 2 3 .

V41. Chapel of Loss (EL 17+)

This chamber is the private chapel of Lo rd Va n r a k

Moonstar.

A large pool dominates the center of this ro u g h -

hewn cavern. From the center of the pool rises a

t h re e-step pyramid carved of basalt. Slick stone

steps lead from the eastern edge of the pool to the

top of the pyramid.

Atop the pyramid stands a glistening, purple-

black  marble  cube  inscribed  with  a  circ u l a r

symbol. Behind it stands a black granite statue of a

w o m a n, her arms outstre t c hed as if we l c o m i n g

someone into her embrace.

T he pyramid serves as an altar to Sh a r, and the symb o l

on the cube is her holy symbol. T he statue depicts the

Dark Maiden.

No d e s : This chamber is both a Class 3 Evil No d e

and a Class 3 Sh a d ow We a ve Node. (See Champions of

Ruin, pages 95 and 98, respectively.)

Evil Node Granted Spells: The Evil Node grants bedevil-

CoR, slashing darknessCoR, and vampiric touch.

Sh a d ow  We a ve  Node  Granted  Sp e l l s : T he  Sh a d ow

We a ve Node grants c o n t rol darkness and shadowsC o R,

crushing despair, and lesser shadow tentacleLoD.

Cre a t u re : A sorrowsworn demon lairs in the

ro u g h - hewn tunnels to the southeast of this cave r n .

The creature was drawn to the lingering sorrow of Clan

Melairkyn that clings to this sublevel.

In addition, Lord Vanrak has imprisoned within this

node the undead remains of three failed Sharran priests

who failed to master the Evil Node. He can call upon

them to defend him if attacked in his private sanctum,

as noted in Champions of Ruin.

T he PCs also have a 10% chance to find Lo rd Va n r a k

in this room if the alarm has not been raised. Ot he rw i s e ,

he returns to this chamber only if he needs to draw upon

t he power of the Evil Node or the Sh a d ow We a ve No d e .

Tre a s u re : Atop the altar lies the Book of Stolen Se c re t s ,

a tome that has become legendary among the faithful of

Sh a r. This item is equ i va l e nt in all ways to a book of vile

d a rk n e s s . Of the curre nt occupants of the temple, only

Lo rd Vanrak has thus far perused this tome.

V42. Gallery of Night (EL 0 or 19)

This area is one of Lo rd Va n r a ks favorite places in the

complex.

This long, quiet hall is lined on both sides with

a l c ove s. T he rectangular ones along the west wall

hold simple wooden benche s. T he trapezo i d a l

alcoves on the east wall hold tapestries of swirling

shadowstuff.

Lord Vanrak spends countless hours here, staring at the

o t he rworldly tapestries while quietly cont e m p l a t i n g

the Lady of Loss.

Creatures: The PCs have a 25% chance of encoun-

tering Lord Vanrak herein.

V43. Death Knights Rest (EL 13+)

Once a crypt for a dwarven laird of Clan Me l a i rk y n,

this chamber now serves as Vanraks resting place. Read

or paraphrase the following when the PCs arrive.

This long, arched chamber is styled in the manner

of a cathedral. T he fart hest portion of the ro o m

c o ntains a raised platform, on which sits a lidless

stone sarcophagus surrounded by nine crouching

g a r g oyle statues. T he gargoyles are cont o rted in

various positions suggesting fear or supplication.

The chamber is actually 30 feet in width and 60 feet in

length, and the platform dominates the last 20 feet of it.

Although Lo rd Vanrak has no need to sleep, he re t i re s

to his sarcophagus from time to time to commune with

his goddess.

Creatures: The PCs have a 10% chance of encoun-

tering Lo rd Vanrak in this room at any given time.

Whether he is present or not, two dread wraiths, drawn

to the death knights service from elsewhere in Under-

mountain, guard this chamber.

Dread Wraiths (2): hp 104; see Monster Ma n u a l

page 258.

V44. Crypt of Gorothir (EL 17)

In the Year of the Sh a d owkin Return (1136 DR), the

whispers of the Dark Lady led Lord Vanrak to the long-

lost remains and shattered staff of her servant Gorothir.

Once the Dark Ranger had claimed Vanrakdoom as his

ow n, he int e r red Go ro t h i rs remains the re, in a place

sacred to his goddess.

This dark, fre ezing cold chamber is filled with

s h a d ows that seem to dance and flicker in an

unfelt breeze. At the south end lies a black marble

s a rcophagus atop a tarnished silver bier. Tw o

extremely tall, humanlike, and repulsive creatures

with long, rotting wings and peeling flesh stand

guard in front of the sarcophagus. Rivulets of filth

and decay drip down their rotting forms to coat

the floor in a pool of ooze.

Gorothir of Shar, the Dark Prophet of the Night, domi-

nated the Church of the Dark Lady from the waning of

Ne t heril (circa 310 DR) until his death in the Year of

t he Unblinking Eye (446 DR). Hated by his count l e s s

d e s c e n d a nts for his tyrannical ways, the Da rk Pro p he t

was destroyed by his own grandchildren, who arranged

for his foes (mages whose magics he had comman-

d e e red, clergy of rival gods, and rulers whose thro n e s

he had usurped) to ambush him while he raided a place

of power sacred to Selne. The massive conflagration of

warring magic destroyed Sh a rs serva nt, leaving only

his staff and girdle untouched. An archwizard of Selne

s h a t t e red the Sh a d owstaff of Go ro t h i ran act for which

he paid with his lifebut Gorothirs girdle survived and

2 3

has since passed through many hands. (See Un d e rd a rk

page 134 for more details of this relic.)

Cre a t u re s : Selne is served by seven shard s,

angelic cre a t u res of the moon equ i va l e nt to planetars.

On rare occasions, the Lady of Loss has managed to cor-

rupt these divine serva nts of her eternal rival, trans-

forming them into angels of decay. Two such fallen

s h a rds (since replaced) stand eternal guard over the

interred corpse of Gorothir.

D An g els of Decay (2): hp 198 each; see Li b r i s

Mortis page 83.

Trap: The lid of Gorothirs sarcophagus is inscribed

with a symbol of death (caster level 18th).

a Symbol of Death Trap: CR 9; spell; location

trigger; no reset; spell effect (symbol of death, 1 5 t h - l e ve l

cleric, death, DC 22 Fo rt save negates); Se a rch DC 33;

Disable Device DC 33. Cost: 11,200 gp to hire NPC

spellcaster.

Tre a s u re : T he bier upon which the sarc o p h a g u s

rests is a massive block of tarnished silver we i g h i n g

about 2,000 pounds and worth its weight in silve r. In

t he surface of the silver just beneath the sarcophagus is

c a rved a symbol of the Mo o n m a i d e n, eclipsed and

defaced by a cloying shadow in the shape of Sh a rs holy

s y mbol. This silver block is the Pl i nth Stone of the

Mo o n m a i d e n, one of the earliest altars used by the fol-

l owers of Selne on the slopes of Mo u nt Wa t e rd e e p.

Reclaiming it and reconsecrating it to the Mo o n m a i d e n

would be a great victory for the followers of Se l  n e .

Once Go ro t h i rs remains had been properly int e r re d ,

Shar rew a rded her serva nt by reforming Go ro t h i rs shat-

t e red staff. T he Sh a d owstaff of Go ro t h i r is now a sacre d

relic (major artifact) of the Church of Sh a r, equ i va l e nt to

a s h a d ow magic Sh a d ows t a f f (see page 281 in the D u n g e o n

Ma s t e rs Guide). T he Sh a d owstaff of Go ro t h i r lies within the

s a rc o p h a g u s, atop the pile of shattered bones that was

once the Da rk Pro p he ts skeleton.

CONCLUDING THE

ADVENTURE

T he PCs can achieve many victories in this adve nt u re .

Recovering the Plinth Stone of the Moonmaiden from

a rea V44 and turning it over to Se l  n es followe r s,

d e s t roying Lo rd Vanrak and clearing the temple of his

f o l l owe r s, or taking the Sh a d owstaff of Go ro t h i r f ro m

Sh a rs faithful are all worthy conclusions, depending

upon the level of the PCs and their exact mission.

FURTHER ADVENTURES

Vanrakdoom is the focus of the Dark Maidens power in

Un d e r m o u nt a i n, Wa t e rd e e p, and up and down the

Sw o rd Coast. A successful assault on this stro n g h o l d

deals a sharp and devastating check to the ambitions of

Shars followers for years thereafter. It also incites their

e ve r -simmering wrath, inducing an orgy of violence

not seen since the Year of the Tr i t o ns Horn (697 DR),

w hen the machinations of Lalondra incited Sh a rs fol-

l owers to riot along the length and breadth of the

Sword Coast. The PCs may be called to deal with one or

m o re of these vengeful incident s, or they may suffer

attacks on their own persons.

If the PCs gained possession of the Sh a d owstaff of

Go ro t h i r, Sh a rs followers will go to any lengths to

reclaim it before it can be destroyed or hidden. A quest

to destroy the staff or to reconsecrate the Pl i nth St o n e

of the Moonmaiden might also be a worthy undert a k-

ing for the characters.

APPENDIX:

VANRAKS STATISTICS

This section provides complete statistics and a personal

history for Lord Vanrak Moonstar.

LORD VANRAK MOONSTAR

Lord Vanrak Moonstar, also known as the Dark Ranger,

long ago betrayed his familys traditional patro n, the

Mo o n m a i d e n, to embrace the worship of Sh a r. Lo rd

Va n r a ks personal history is int e rw oven with the his-

t o ry of House Moonstar and the City of Sp l e n d o r s, as

detailed in the Adventure Background section.

Long considered the bogeyman of House Moonstar

and the Church of Selne, Lo rd Vanrak resides in the

depths of Undermountain as the uncontested master of

Vanrakdoom (UM SLM). Vanrak seeks nothing less

than the destruction of the Moonmaiden, but he is con-

t e nt to begin by destroying House Moonstar and the

House of the Mo o n, and subjugating all of Wa t e rd e e p

to the bitter comfort of the Dark Maiden.

T he Da rk Ranger stands just over 6 feet in he i g h t ,

his broad shoulders making a striking foil for his strap-

ping, skeletal frame. He wears a mantle of black velvet

over his gleaming black mithral shirt, and he keeps a

jet black chakram strapped to the back of each of his

black leather gaunt l e t s. His eyes are twin pits of dark-

ness reflecting a soul that has been utterly consumed

by the Lady of Loss.

Languages: Abyssal, Chondathan, Common.

Abyssal Blast (Su ) : Once per day, Vanrak can

unleash a blast of eldritch fire that fills a 20-foot-radius

spread anywhere within a range of 1,040 feet. The blast

deals 16d6 points of damage, half fire and half divine

(Reflex DC 20 half ).

Fear Aura (Su ) : Vanrak is shrouded in a dre a d f u l

aura of death and evil. Any cre a t u re with fewer than 5

HD within 15 feet of Vanrak must succeed on a DC 20

Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell (caster

level 16th).

Touch Attack: Vanraks touch attack uses negative

energy to deal 1d8+2 points of damage plus 1 point of

Constitution damage to a living creature. A DC 20 Will

s a ve reduces the damage by half and negates the Con-

stitution damage.

Da rkness Spel l s : Vanrak can pre p a re any Da rk-

ness domain spell as if it we re on his divine spell list.

The spell uses a spell slot equal to its level in the Dark-

ness domain list.

Disk of Night (Su): Any chakram used by Vanrak

is treated as if it we re a +2 re t u rning chakra m . If it

remains out of his hand for more than 1 round, it

re ve rts to its original abilities. Any additional abilities

(such as ravenous) that the weapon may have still apply.

Eyes of Shar (Ex): Vanraks eyes are totally black,

g r a nting him darkvision to a range of 60 feet. He can

also see through magical darkness to a range of 10 feet

in the same black-and-white sight that darkvision pro-

vides. He cannot be blinded by magical effects.

Fa vo red Enemy (Ex ) : Vanrak gains a +2 bonus

on his Bl u f f, Listen, Sense Mo t i ve, Spot, and Su rv i va l

c hecks when using these skills against humans. He

gains the same bonus on weapon damage.

Minion of Shar (Sp): Once per tenday as a stan-

dard action, Vanrak can summon ten shadows to do his

bidding for 10 ro u n d s. Any shadows that a summoned

shadow creates by draining Strength are under Vanraks

c o nt rol, but vanish along with the original when the

duration of the effect expires. Vanrak can verbally com-

municate with the shadows as if he knew their lan-

guage. He can also use his shadow talk ability to com-

municate with them.

Sh a d ow Talk (Su ) : Vanrak can communicate

mystically through the shadows of the mind. He can

whisper short messages to other worshipers of Sh a r

within 500 feet. All Shar worshipers within range of

t he  message  hear  it  as  a  whisper  in  their  minds.

Ob s e rvers can hear the words if they are close enough

to physically hear Va n r a ks actual whispers (a DC 15

Listen check if the listener is within 10 feet, +1 DC per

5 feet beyond that). Sh a d ow talk is a language-d e p e n-

d a nt free action, and it can be used to communicate

with undead worshipers of Shar and undead cre a t u re s

in the service of Shar worshipers.

Sh a r s Caress (Su ) : Vanrak can surround a he l d

c h a k r a m, whip, or dagger with Sh a d ow We a ve magic,

giving the weapon the unholy property for 1 round per

use. Vanrak can invoke this power as a free action twice

per day. He must decide to use this ability before the

attack is made, and if the attack misses, that use of

Shars caress is wasted.

Summon Mo u nt (Su ) : Vanrak can summon a

m o u nt, typically a nightmare, though it may be of any

other species used as a mount. The mount may have no

m o re than 8 Hit Dice. If the mount is lost or killed,

Vanrak may summon another one after a year and a day.

True Lies (Sp): Vanrak can reach into a cre a t u res

mind and modify its memories as the 4th-level bard

spell modify memories. Vanrak can use this ability twice

per tenday as a 10th-level bard.

Turn Immunity (Ex): Vanrak cannot be turned.

He can be banished with holy word , h owe ve r, just as if

he were an evil outsider. When banished, he returns to

Shars plane.

Undead  Fo l l owe r s : Vanrak  attracts  lesser

undead creatures that happen to exist within a 200-mile

r a d i u s. He may have up to 32 HD of such followe r s.

T hese cre a t u res remain in his service until destroye d

and are in addition to any undead cre a t u res Va n r a k

might be able to command or rebuke as a class ability.

Va n r a ks curre nt followers are the two dread wraiths

that haunt area V43.

Undead Tr a i t s : Vanrak is immune to poison,

s l e e p, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necro-

mantic effects, mind-influencing effects, and any effect

re quiring a Fo rtitude save unless it also works on

2 5

o b j e c t s. He  is not  subject to critical hits, subdual

damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain.

Ne g a t i ve energy heals him, and he is not at risk of

death from massive damage, but is destroyed at 0 or

fewer hit points. He has darkvision to a range of 60 feet.

Vanrak cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if

he is willing.

Voice of In e f f a b le Evil (Sp): Once per day,

Vanrak can command a cre a t u re as per the d o m i n a t e

m o n s t e r spell (caster level 10th). T he effect lasts for 24

h o u r s. Unlike most spell-like abilities, voice of ineffable

evil has a verbal component.
