Introduction

Youve adventured in sunken ruins, abandoned dwarven

mines, temples to death gods, and the thief- lled sewers of

large cities. Still, you know there must be more to adventure,

more to reality than what youve so far seen. You yearn to

experience for yourself the mystical realms told about in

stories  and  authenticated  by  the  appearances  of  strange

outsiders pulsing with elemental vigor or divine strength.

You knew there had to be more to the multiverse. And you

were right.

A PLAYERS GUIDE

TO THE PLANES

The  Dungeon  Masters  Guide  and  Manual  of  the  Planes  both

provide information on creating games that take place on

worlds other than the Material Plane. But as excellent a

resource as both these books are, they are primarily aimed

at the Dungeon Master.

The  Planar  Handbook  is  organized  differently.  It  was

written and compiled with players, and player characters,

in mind. The Planar Handbook offers a vast array of options

for exploring and adventuring on the planes. Like a hero of

myth, your character can descend into the land of the dead,

traverse Olympian mounts, or battle devils in Hell itself.

In  this  players  guide  to  the  planes,  youll  discover  new

races, feats, equipment, spells, and magic items to help burst

the barriers and bridge the gaps between the Material Plane

and other environments and realities. New tricks for ordi-

nary characters are also provided; now a barbarian,  ghter,

or sorcerer can improve his or her ability to function and

survive on other planes by taking special planar substitu-

tion levels.

Another highlight of this book is the concept of planar

touchstonespoints  of  power  interspersed  throughout

the multiverse that are ripe for the tapping. By knowing

where  they  are  and  how  they  work,  your  character  can

tour a small constellation of planar touchstones to which

she is attuned, thereby directly charging her body with

planar power.

Now, you hold the reins for instigating a trip away from

the familiar Material Plane. With this handbook, you can

become better prepared to make that tripand to return.

CHAPTER SUMMARY

Chapter  1:  Races.  This  chapter  introduces  several

new character racesbuommans, mephlings, neraphim,

shadow swyfts, spikers, and wildrenas well as a selection

of  planar  character  races  from  previous  products.  It  also

presents several powerful races in the monster class format

popularized by Savage Species: avoral guardinal, chain devil,

hound archon, janni, and lillend.

Chapter  2:  Classes  and  Feats.  This  chapter  intro-

duces  the  planar  substitution  levela  new  option  for

characters  using  the  standard  classes  from  the  Players

Handbook. The chapter also includes new plane-specific

and planar-inspired feats, such as Acheron Flurry, Celes-

tial Summoning Specialist, and Planar Familiar. Two new

feats, Planar Touchstone and Personal Touchstone, allow

a character to plug into extraplanar locations that exude

power,  which  that  character  can  then  channel  and  use.

Finally, a new category of featsheritage featsenables

you  to  define  your  characters  extraplanar  ancestry  in

new ways.

Chapter 3: Prestige Classes. Take your character in an

exciting  new  direction  with  the  elemental  warrior,  astral

dancer, cipher adept, or doomlord, to name just a few of the

prestige classes presented here. Most of the classes in this

chapter are presented along with descriptions of organiza-

tions appropriate to a planar campaign, which may serve as

allies or foes of the player characters.

Chapter  4:  Equipment  and  Magic  Items.  When  all

the  planes  are  your  marketplace,  the  variety  of  possible

equipment is nearly in nite. This chapter provides a small

sampling of that variety, focusing on a few weapons, armors,

gear, and other useful items available out there. For those

interested in getting around the planes in a reliable manner,

planar mounts or plane-traipsing vehicles, such as the ethe-

real tunneler, may be just the thing.

Chapter  5:  Spells.  When  your  knowledge  of  spells  is

informed  by  familiarity  with  multiple  dimensions,  magic

undreamed  of  could  be  yours.  With  these  new  resources,

you can precipitate a dimensional rift, summon mighty new

monsters, tap into the abilities of extraplanar creatures, or

even open up entirely new domains of divine power.

Chapter 6: Creatures of the Planes. Here youll  nd

plane-hopping  creatures  and  monsters  native  to  other

planes to challenge all characters. A few, such as the else-

whale and the lesser nightmare, could serve your character

as a mount, ally, or summoned servant.

Chapter 7: Planar Sites. In addition to traveling tips, a

discussion of planar breaches, and tours of some big-name

metropolises that any planar adventurer will want to visit

sometime during his career, this chapter describes dozens

of planar touchstone locationssites that let you tap into

the higher-order powers of the multiverse.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Planar Handbook makes use of the information in the three

D&D core rulebooksPlayers Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide, and Monster Manual. In addition, it includes refer-

ences  to  material  (primarily  monster  descriptions)  from

several D&D supplements, including Manual of the Planes,

Monster  Manual  II,  Fiend  Folio,  Draconomicon,  Miniatures

Handbook,  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds,  Book  of  Vile  Darkness,  and

Epic Level Handbook. Although possession of any or all of

these  supplements  will  enhance  your  enjoyment  of  this

book, they are not strictly necessary.

he races presented in the Players Handbook are perfectly

suitable to a planar campaign. Humans, elves, dwarves,

and  the  other  races  all  travel  between  the  planes,  and

some even choose to make their homes there.

Players and DMs wishing for a more multiplanar

feel to the campaign might choose to incorporate charac-

ters from one or more of the planar-oriented races in this

chapter.  Some  of  these  races  hail  from  speci c  planes,

while others simply show the signs of planar ancestry, but

all of them have a distinctly planar  avor. The neraphim

originate in Limbo, but some have found their way to the

great planar metropolises, including Sigil and Union. The

wildren travel the wild places between planes, enjoying

their  capacity  to  seek  and  explore,  while  the  Acheron-

born  spikers  seek  to  prove  themselves  in  combat  wher-

ever they go.

CHOOSING A RACE

After you roll your ability scores (see page 7 of the Players

Handbook)  but  before  you  write  them  on  your  character

sheet,  choose  your  characters  race.  At  the  same  time,

youll want to choose his or her class, since race affects how

well he or she can do in each class. Once you know your

characters race and class, assign your ability score rolls to

particular  abilities,  alter  the  abilities  according  to  race

(see Table 11: Racial Ability Adjustments, on the next

page), and continue detailing your character.

RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS

Your  characters  race  determines  some  of  his  or  her

qualities.

Race Adjustments

Find your characters race on Table 11: Racial Abil-

ity Adjustments and apply the adjustments you see

there  to  your  characters  ability  scores.  If  these

changes raise your score above 18 or below 3, thats

okay. Exception: Intelligence for characters cannot

go below 3. If your character would have an Intel-

ligence of 1 or 2 after applying ability adjustments,

make it 3 instead.

In addition, each races favored class is listed on

Table 11: Racial Ability Adjustments. A characters

favored class doesnt count against the character

when determining experience point penalties for

multiclassing (see Experience for Multi class Charac-

ters, page 60 of the Players Handbook).

The  level  adjustment  (Level  Adj.)  is  also  given

for each race. This number indicates the effective

AASIMARS

Carrying  the  blood  of  a  celestial,  an  aasimar  is  usually

good-aligned  and   ghts  against  evil  in  the  world.  Some

aasimars have a minor physical trait suggesting their heri-

tage, such as silver hair, golden eyes, or an unnatu-

rally intense stare.

Personality:  Most  aasimars  strive  for

nobility in their behavior, but must often

fight  against  tendencies  toward  venge-

fulness or quick judgment. Some also

experience  a  great  deal  of  prejudice,

particularly from their human neigh-

bors,  which  can  lead  to  aloofness.

Ultimately,  most  aasimars

tend to be loners, unable to

fully trust others.

or even topaz eyes,  iridescent  skin,  an  intense  stare,  or  a

powerful, ringing voice.

Aasimars  reach  adulthood  at  about  the  same  age  as

humans  but  are  longer-lived,  with  the  eldest  members  of

the race living to be 150 years old.

Relations: Although aasimars are mostly human, they

rarely feel like they  t in among human society. Instead,

they get along best with other halfbreedsnamely, half-

elves and half-orcsbecause they usually share the same

sort  of  semioutcast  background.  Good-aligned  aasimars

are  also  generally  friendly  toward  bariaurs  and  wildren,

which share some of their celestial heritage.

Of  the  other  races,  aasimars  save  their  distrust  for  tief-

lings, whose  endish ancestry strikes a chord of suspicion

in the heart of the aasimar.

Alignment:  Aasimars  are  usually  good,  as  be ts  their

celestial  heritage.  However,  the  extraordinarily  rare  evil

aasimar often makes the vilest villain.

Religion:  Aasimars  have  no

chief deity. Popular

Physical  Description:

Aasimars look human (and

are  roughly  the  same

height  and  weight  as

members  of  that  race),

This feature may take  the

aasimars include Heironeous, god of valor; Pelor, god of the

sun; and Kord, god of strength. Those with a more judgmen-

tal outlook may venerate St. Cuthbert of the Cudgel.

Language: Aasimars have no cultural language, although

those that realize their heritage usually learn Celestial. An

aasimar  usually  learns  the

language of her parents.

Names:  Aasimars  gener-

ally  take  human  names,  though

some change their names upon reaching

young  adulthood  and  realizing

their heritage.

A bariaur

Adventurers: Aasimars make

natural adventurers; their burn-

ing  desire  to  battle  evil  easily

draws  them  into  such  a  life.  Many

pursue a divine calling, becoming paladins

or clerics, but the race also boasts many

powerful  sorcerers,  bards,  fighters,

and rangers.

AASIMAR RACIAL

TRAITS

Aasimar characters

have the following

racial abilities and characteristics.

+2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma.

Outsider: Aasimars are outsiders

native  to  the  Material  Plane,

and  thus  have  the  outsider

(native)  type.  They  gain  the

extraplanar  subtype  when  not

on  the  Material  Plane.  They  are

not  subject  to  spells  or  effects  that  affect

only  humanoids,  such  as  charm  person  and

dominate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, aasimars have no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

An aasimars base land speed is 30 feet.

Aasimars have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: Aasimars have a +2 racial bonus on Spot and Listen

checks. They are naturally alert and attentive.

Daylight (Sp): An aasimar can use daylight, as the spell,

once per day. His caster level is equal to his character

level.

Resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5: Aasimars

share  some  of  their  celestial  ancestors  resistance  to

energy damage.

Automatic Languages: Common, Celestial. Bonus Lan-

guages:  Draconic,  Dwarven,  Elven,  Gnome,  Halfling,

Sylvan.

Favored Class: Paladin. Inherently noble, many aasimars

follow the calling of paladinhood.

Level adjustment +1.

BARIAURS

Native to the rolling hills and woods of Ysgard, the centaur-

like bariaurs wander the lands in search of evil. When a vile

foe is located, the bariaurs charge into glorious battle.

Personality:  To  those  unfamiliar  with  them,  bariaurs

appear carefree or even irresponsible, but this behavior is

merely  the  outward  sign  of  their  wanderlust.  They  rarely

remain in one place for long, preferring a life of travel to sed-

entary existence. When evil rears its ugly head, this carefree

demeanor disappears, replaced by single-minded pursuit of

that which endangers good folk of the area.

Physical Description: Standing roughly

half  a  foot  taller  than  a  human,  a  bar-

iaur resembles a centaur. Its lower

body  is  that  of  a  ram,  with

sleek  brown  or  golden  fur

and  cloven  hooves.  Its  upper

body  is  humanlike,  powerfully

muscled  and  sporting  a  pair  of

ramlike horns atop its head. The

skin  of  a  bariaur  ranges  in  color

from pale tan to deep nut-brown.

The  typical  male  weighs

nearly  300  pounds,  with

females about 40 pounds

lighter.  The  average  bar-

iaur reaches adulthood at

about the same age as a half-

elf, and the eldest members

of the race live to well over

200 years of age.

Relations:  Bariaurs  are

social and outgoing, though

not  foolishly  trusting.  They

get  along  well  with  elves,

gnomes,  half lings,  and

wil dren, as well as aasimars

who arent too strict in their

outlook.  They  grudgingly

accept dwarves as allies against

evil.  Halfbreeds,  such  as  half-

elves  and  half-orcs,  are  objects

of curiosity to bariaurs. They are

moderately suspicious of races with heritages tied to planes

of  evil  or  shadow,  including  tie ings  and  shadowswyfts,

but they prefer to take a positive outlook about individuals

until proven wrong.

Alignment: As creatures who value freedom, most bar-

iaurs are chaotic good in alignment. Some more settled bar-

iaurs tend toward neutrality in their approach to good, while

a few stray from pure good toward neutrality. Evil bariaurs

are extremely rare and always shunned from the  ock.

Religion: Bariaurs revere Ehlonna, deity of the wood-

lands, more than most other deities. Some venerate Kord,

god of strength, or Pelor, god of the sun.

5/20/04, 11:10:53 AM

Language:  Bariaurs  have  no  racial  language,  using

Celestial for most conversations. They also speak Common

to allow them to converse with other races.

Names: A bariaurs name is given to him by his parents.

It is usually a simple, one- or two-syllable name (the easier

to be shouted across the hills of Ysgard). Within the  ock,

he denotes his parentage by adding buck of his fathers

name (or doe of the mothers name, if female); outside

the  ock, he relies instead on a  ock name to indicate the

extended  family  to  which  he  belongs.  Flock  names  typi-

cally describe the environments favored by the  ock, and

can change over time.

Male Names: Bex, Hul, Jek, Menok, Ril, Wyk.

Female Names: Daeth, Hysh, Saph, Tyth, Vash.

Flock Names: Clover eld, Dalewatcher, Hillwalker, Wood-

strider.

Adventurers: The bariaurs wanderlust makes him an ideal

adventurer. Though leaving the  ock can be a dif cult deci-

sion, a young bariaur who seeks to take the  ght to the evil

creatures of the multiverse  ts in well with most adventur-

ing groups. Bariaurs frequently follow the path of the ranger,

though bariaur  ghters and barbarians are also common.

BARIAUR RACIAL TRAITS

Bariaur  characters  have  the  following  racial  abilities  and

characteristics.

+2 Strength, 2 Charisma: Bariaurs are powerful, but they

have underdeveloped social skills.

Outsider:  Bariaurs  are  native  to  the  Heroic  Domains  of

Ysgard, and thus have the outsider type. They gain the

extraplanar subtype when not on Ysgard. They are not

subject  to  spells  or  effects  that  affect  only  humanoids,

such as charm person and dominate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, bariaurs have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A bariaurs base land speed is 40 feet.

Bariaurs have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Quadruped:  As  quadrupeds,  bariaurs  have  a  +4  bonus

on checks to resist bull rush and trip attacks. They have

a  carrying  capacity  1-1/2  times  greater  than  normal  for

their Strength. They must wear barding (usually made of

studded leather) instead of normal armor and cannot wear

boots designed for humanoids.

Powerful Charge: A charging bariaur can make a single

ram attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 +

1-1/2 times the bariaurs Str modi er.

BARIAURS AND EXALTED BARIAURS

The bariaurs described in this book are the most common form

of the race (also described in Manual of the Planes). The larger,

more powerful form of bariaurs detailed in Book of Exalted

Deeds are generally known as exalted bariaurs, due to their

closer connection to the powers of the celestial planes.

selves against such threats.

Favored Class: Ranger.

BUOMMANS

There might have been a time when the buommans were

merely human visitors to the Astral Plane. But now, per-

haps hundreds of millennia later, the buommans are nei-

ther merely visitors, nor merely human. Known to some

astral denizens as the moaning monks, buommans dwell

in  temples  and  shrines  formed  by  astral  debris,  which

they  believe  to  be  the  mortal  forms  of  sleeping  deities,

long  forgotten.  Whether  the  buommans  inhabit  these

structures  in  the  hope  of  awakening  these  deities,  or  in

an effort to ensure that they stay asleep, is known only to

the buommans.

Personality:  Buommans  are  quiet,  withdrawn,  and

deferential. Though they appear capable of understanding

languages,  they  speak  no  tongue  other  than  their  low,

booming songs in a dialect called Buommi, which appear

to be more music than actual language.

Physical Description: Buommans appear more or less

like humans, though with long, sagging faces and elongated

hands and feet (a feature most prominent in the  ngers and

toes). On average, buomanns are slightly shorter and slightly

heavier than humans. A male buomman has long hair and

bushy  brows;  a  female  buomman  has  no  apparent  body

hair. Buommans reach adulthood at about the same age as

humans, and the eldest members of the race can live to be

120 years old.

Relations: Buommans often spend their entire lives in

ascetic contemplation within the con nes of the shrine or

temple in which they were born. From time to time, though,

a buomman (particularly a buomman monk) departs his or

her home to explore the Astral Plane, or other planes, out

of  curiosity  about  the  outside  worlds.  Sometimes  these

individuals  gravitate  to  service  with  wandering  githzerai,

and occasionally venture back to Limbo with them. Buom-

mans avoid confrontations with evil outsiders, more out of

caution than from fear or dislike. If buommans have any

enemies, they are most likely found on the planes of Pan-

demonium and the Abyss. Buommans get along quite well

with creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth or the

Elemental Plane of Water.

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   8

5/20/04, 11:10:59 AM

Alignment:  The  average  buomman  is  lawful,  tending

toward lawful neutral or lawful good. A few buommans are

lawful evil or simply neutral.

Religion: Buommans eschew traditional religions, seem-

ing, as they do, to worship their temple homes in

the Astral Plane. A few who travel extensively

develop an af nity for Fharlanghn, the god

of  roads.  But  few  buommans  become

clerics  of  any  deity,  because  their

vow against speaking (described

below)  makes  spellcasting  dif-

 cult. Those who wish to learn

to cast spells with verbal com-

ponents must acquire the Non-

verbal Spell feat (described on

page 40).

Whether  a  buomman

believes  that  the  astral

bodies that his race dwells

upon  are  dead  deities,

sleeping  deities  to  be

awakened,  or  sleeping

deities  that  must  never

rise  is  up  to  the  indi-

vidual buomman. Neu-

tral buommans usually

believe  in  the  dead  dei-

ties  theory,  while  lawful

good  buommans  believe

that the deities are sleeping

and will someday awake to

spread  their  majesty  again.

Lawful evil buommans fear the

return of these deities, and sing

their songs to prevent them from

awakening.

Language: Buommans communicate with one

another by means of their low, throaty songs, but

the concepts they convey appear to be more abstract than

informational.  Contrary  to  rumor,  a  buomman  does  not

constantly  sing,  but  instead  sings  as  part  of  rituals  that

mark his daily life. The buommans have a song for arriving,

a song for leaving, a song for waking, a song for sleeping, a

song for eating, and countless other songs for far less con-

crete concepts. Except for these songs, buommans choose

not  to  speak  any  recognizable  language,  though  they  are

capable of learning any language they choose. The average

buomman, for example, understands Common; he simply

never speaks it.

Names: For a race that has collectively taken a vow against

speaking, buommans have a wide variety of namesall of

which are based on musical notes. For example, a buomman

female might express her name as a short melody in the key

of D sharp, and a different buomman female might express

her name as the same melody, but in B sharp. The name of

the race re ects this tradition, being based on the deep, sus-

tained note that every buomman learns to vocalize before he

or she can walk: buomm.

For  the  convenience  of  other  races,  buommans  do  not

mind accepting nicknames, but they prefer those that have

no harsh consonants. Jak, for example, would be an

uncomfortable appellation, while Moony

would suit a buomman just  ne.

Adventurers: Most buommans who

feel the urge to explore are younger mem-

bers of the race. They usually set out with

the goal of gathering information for

the  temple  (which  usually  means

seeing  the  multiverse),  with

the  intent  of  returning  to  the

ascetic life when they become

tired  or  homesick.  Some  few

actually do return, late in life,

to  introduce  new  concepts

into their insular societies.

BUOMMAN

RACIAL TRAITS

Buommans  have  the  fol-

lowing racial abilities and

characteristics.

+2 Wisdom, 2 Cha-

risma.  Buommans

have great insight and

willpower,  but  their

reserved  nature  leads  to

poor interpersonal skills.

Humanoid  (Extra-

planar): Buommans are

humanoids native to the

Astral  Plane.  They  gain

the extraplanar subtype when not on

the Astral Plane.

Medium: As Medium creatures, buommans have no spe-

cial bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A buommans base land speed is 30 feet.

Low-Light Vision: A buomman can see twice as far as a

human  in  starlight,  moonlight,  torchlight,  and  similar

conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to

distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

Skills: +2 racial bonus on Listen and Perform (sing) checks.

All buommans have uncanny hearing and an innate sense

of tone and pitch.

Buommans take a vow against speech at an extremely

early age, after which they simply refuse to engage in

traditional forms of communication. A buomman who

breaks this vow takes 1 point of Wisdom damage and

takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for 24

hours afterward. (If the buomman breaks the vow again

before 24 hours have passed, he takes an additional point

9

of Wisdom damage, and his penalty on attack rolls, saves,

and  checks  persists  for  another  24  hours.)  A  buomman

spellcaster who wishes to cast spells with a verbal compo-

nent must use the Silent Spell metamagic feat or else have

the Nonverbal Spell feat (see page 40).

Automatic  Languages:  Buommans  speak  Buommi  and

understand  Common.  Bonus  Languages:  Aquan,  Gith-

zerai, Terran.

Favored Class: Monk.

MEPHLINGS

Scholarly lore contains two different origin stories for the

mephlings. In one, mephlings are planetouched offshoots of

long-ago unions between mephits and an indeterminate race

of humanoids. The other is a darker tale of a megalomaniacal

mage seeking to imprint his essence on another race.

What is true is that a mephling will occasionally be born

to  mephit  parents.  Weaker  than  their  mephit  ancestors,

mephlings are put out of mephit communities as undesir-

able runts. Theyre left to the mercies of the inhospitable

planes.  Mephit  parents  revolted  by  their  humanoid  child

will leave the babe on a hostile plane. Kindly parents will

place the child on a habitable plane where it will easily be

found by other creatures. Sometimes other creatures adopt

the abandoned baby and it grows to reach adulthood.

Personality: As foundlings raised by parents very dif-

ferent from themselves, mephlings frequently

feel out of place. They usually are loners who desire an elu-

sive sense of belonging. Nevertheless, theyre attractive and

personable, generally liked by people around them.

Physical Description: Mephlings look like less comely

versions of their mephit parents with stunted wings. A typi-

cal mephling stands less than 3 feet tall and weighs around 30

pounds, with females slightly taller and heavier than males.

Air: An air mephling looks like a short, cloud-white human.

Earth: An earth mephling appears akin to a short, stony,

hairless dwarf.

Fire:  A   re  mephling  resembles  a  miniature  devil,  with

 ery, reddish-bronze skin.

Water:  A  water  mephling  resembles  a  small,   sh-scaled

human with black, bulbous eyes.

Mephlings  do  not  reach  adulthood  until  they  are  more

than 50 years old. The longest-lived members of the race can

reach an age of well over 200 years.

Relations: Mephlings  t in equally oddly in virtually all

societies. At best, one is regarded as an exotic curiosity. At

worst, one is seen as a friendly stranger, perhaps with a suspi-

cious touch of devil, demon, or elemental bloodwhatever

is  least  welcome  by  a  given  culture.  Mephlings  get  along

best with others of their race who have had similar experi-

ences. Mephlings also have good relations with hal ings,

especially those who have traveled widely or who frequently

consort with outsiders.

Alignment: Mephlings tend to have a neutral component

to their worldview, but they can be of any alignment. They

frequently  adopt  the  philosophy  and  worldview  of  their

foster parents or the culture in which they were raised.

5/20/04, 11:11:07 AM

Religion: Naturally disposed to becoming sorcerers and

often acutely aware of an uncaring multiverse, mephlings

turn  to  the  worship  of  Boccob  the  Uncaring,  Lord  of  all

Magics.  Some  instead  turn  to  the  more  fatalistic  philoso-

phies  of  Wee  Jas.  Many  mephlings  who  choose  to  travel

extensively worship Fharlanghn.

Language: Mephlings speak the language of the society

in which they are raised, almost always Common. In addi-

tion, each mephling has an elemental language that re ects

his  or  her  heritageair  mephlings  speak  Auran,  earth

mephlings speak Terran,  re mephlings speak Ignan, and

water mephlings speak Aquan.

Names:  A  mephling  typically  grows  up  with  a  name

given  by  the  adopting  parents,  but  most  choose  another

name in adulthood.

Air: Air, Breath, Breeze, Hover, Wings.

Earth: Burrow, Earth, Rock, Stone.

Fire: Crackle, Fire, Flame, Scorch.

Water: Splash, Storm, Swish, Tsunami, Water, Waves, Wet.

Adventurers: Frequently ostracized or at least marginalized

in the society of their youth, mephlings almost always feel the

urge to travel and adventure. They are drawn to explore the

world and the multiverse beyond their hometowns.

Air:  Air  mephlings  tend  to  travel  a  great  deal.  Their

favored class is bard, and they prefer wind instruments.

Earth:  Earth  mephlings  have  much  of  the  strength  of

their  natural  element.  The  harmonious  balance  of  earth

leads many to pursue the favored class of druid.

Fire: The mephit heritage is very strong in  re mephlings.

Their favored class is sorcerer.

Water:  Calm  as  a  still  pond,  strong  as  rushing  water,  a

water mephlings favored class is monk.

MEPHLING RACIAL TRAITS

Mephlings  have  the  following  racial  abilities  and  charac-

teristics.

2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma. Mephlings are generally a

bit slow on the uptake, but they make up for it with strong

personalities. In addition, each kind of mephling has one

or more ability modi ers speci c to its race.

Air: +2 Dexterity. Air mephlings are quick in action.

Earth:  +2  Strength,  2  Dexterity.  Earth  mephlings

are physically strong but slow to act.

Fire: +2 Dexterity. Like air mephlings,  re mephlings

are agile and quick.

Water: +2 Constitution. Water mephlings are sturdy

and durable.

Humanoid (Extraplanar): Mephlings are native to the Ele-

mental Planes. They have the humanoid type and gain the

extraplanar subtype when not on their respective ances-

tral plane. Unlike their mephit ancestors, mephlings do

not have an elemental subtype.

Small: As Small creatures, mephlings have a +1 bonus to

Armor Class, a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus

on Hide checks. They use smaller weapons than Medium

characters use, and their lifting and carrying limits are

three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

A mephlings base land speed is 30 feet. In addition, an

air mephling has a  y speed of 10 feet (perfect), an earth

mephling has a burrow speed of 10 feet, and a water meph-

ling has a swim speed of 30 feet.

Each mephling has a breath weapon, the effect of which

varies by the mephlings heritage. An air mephlings breath

weapon  is  a  cone  of  dust  and  grit  (piercing  damage),  an

earth mephlings breath weapon is a cone of rock shards

and  pebbles  (bludgeoning  damage),  a   re  mephlings

breath weapon is a cone of  ame ( re damage), and a water

mephlings breath weapon is a cone of caustic liquid (acid

damage).  Regardless  of  the  effect,  a  mephlings  breath

weapon  lls a 15-foot cone, deals 1d8 points of damage to

each target, and allows a Re ex save (10 + 1/2 mephlings

Hit Dice + mephlings Con modi er) for half damage. A 1st-

level mephling can use his breath weapon once per day; a

higher-level mephling gains one additional use per day for

every four levels he has attained. If a mephling can use his

breath weapon more than once per day, 1d4 rounds must

pass between consecutive uses of the breath weapon.

Mephlings  cast  spells  with  an  elemental  descriptor

that matches their kind (air, earth, fire, or water) at +1

caster level.

Automatic  Languages:  Mephlings  speak  Common  and

one elemental language appropriate to their kind (Aquan,

Auran, Ignan, or Terran). Bonus Languages: Aquan, Auran,

Ignan, Terran.

Favored Class: Each kind of mephling has its own favored

class, re ecting its racial tendencies. The air mephlings

mephlings may put on a poor show. These runts of the litter

have  stunted  wings  with  which  most  cannot  fly.  They  are

generally  less  physically  developed  and  a  bit  less  charismatic

than their mephit kin. Mephlings have very limited use of their

breath weapons and reduced fast healing. They entirely lack the

mephits spell-like abilities.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

In contrast, when comparing mephits and mephlings as a

player  character  race,  mephlings  easily  triumph.  They  have

a much lower level adjustment and no racial Hit Dice, so they

can be played at a very low effective character level. Mephlings

have reasonable ability score adjustments for a player character

race. The limits on their fast healing and breath weapons also

assure that they wont be game-breaking powerhouses.

NERAPHIM

A  neraph  (plural  neraphim)  is  sometimes  mistaken  for  a

slaad at a distance, due to the two races similarity in appear-

ance.  However,  neraphim  and  slaadi  are  distinct  kinds  of

creatures, at least so far as any race can be considered dis-

tinct in the roiling chaos of the plane of Limbo.

Neraphim  are  a  nomadic  people  who  hunt  through

the maelstrom of Limbo, tracking their elusive and ever-

moving  prey.  Neraphim  have  devel-

oped  special  hunting  tools

and  techniques,  giving

them exceptional skill

in  bringing  down

the game they seek

above  all  else:  the

chaos  beast,  one  of

which  provides  a

neraph  tribe  with

a  weeks  worth

of  nutrition  and

raw  materials  for

clothing.  They

are  proficient

leapers,  able

to  jump  from

mote  to  mote

of  stable  earth  in  the  other-

wise ever-changing environment of Limbo.

For social and economic purposes, the neraphim organize

themselves in houses. Each house lays claim to certain hunt-

ing grounds, giving its members access to resources within

that  territory.  The  various  houses  congregate  once  every

seven years to conduct a great racial celebration known as

the  Festival  of  Spawning.  During  the  festival,  the  houses

negotiate  with  one  another,  exchanging  resources  and

in uence as each house seeks to better its position within

the neraphim hierarchy.

Personality: Neraphim cannot afford to be as incon-

sistent  as  the  plane  they  inhabit  and  the  game  they

huntonly  stern  discipline  within  each  neraph  house

keeps  its  members  from  succumbing  to  poverty  and

starvation.  Each  house  consists  of  a  bonded  group  of

neraphim  made  up  of  several  related  families  and  one

matriarch. In the time between their Festivals of Spawn-

ing, the various neraphim houses meet only rarely, and

then  often  in  conflict  over  disputed  hunting  grounds.

Alliances  between  houses  are  not  uncommon,  if  a  par-

ticular threat warrants.

Within  each  house,  the  rule  of  the  matriarch  is  law,

and her rule can be harsh. The most severe punishment

a matriarch can dispense is exile from the house. Exiled

neraphim  can  be  encountered,  though  most  are  slain  by

other houses, slaadi, githzerai hunting parties, and roam-

ing chaos beats. Some exiles have open personalities and

strike  up  friendships  with  travelers  from  other  planes,

hoping to accompany them home and leave the dangerous

realm of Limbo behind.

Physical Description: Neraphim are roughly humanoid

in shape, with coarse red hide. Though bipedal like other

humanoids,  a  neraph  has  a  massive,  toadlike  head  shaped

like that of a red slaad. The range in height and weight found

among  neraphim  is  the  same  as  found  among  humans.

Chitinlike encrustations on a neraphs skin provides it some

natural  protection;  however,

neraphim also prefer to wear

colorful  bone-spiked

leather  (made  of  sta-

bilized  and  cured

chaos beast hide).

Neraphim  take

longer  to  mature

than humans do, not

reaching  adulthood

until age 40, but they

can  live  to  be  more

than 400 years old.

Relations:  Nera-

phim  encountered

while  still  asso-

ciated  with  a

house are gen-

erally  unfriendly  toward  strangers,

even  those  of  the  same  race.  However,  exiles  are

more open-minded and may team up with others (whether

neraphim, githzerai, or some other-planar race) in order to

survive. On the other hand, because neraphim remind some

individuals  of  smaller,  skinnier  red  slaadi,  other  races  are

usually a bit standof sh at  rst.

Alignment:  Even  though  they  hold  themselves  above

the  general  churn  of  Limbo,  neraphim  cant  help  having

one chaotic component in their alignment. They try not to

give in to their chaotic nature, and generally are successful

in this practice.

Religion: Giving some credence to the theory that the

neraphim are a subspecies of slaad, a few neraphim houses

worship  less  bloodthirsty  and  less  insane  aspects  of  the

entities Ssendam and Ygorl (who are normally considered

to  be,  if  not  slaadi  deities,  at  least  very  powerful  slaadi

worthy of respect).

Language:  Neraphim  speak  their  own  language  and

Slaad.  Some  learn  Common,  which  allows  them  to  better

communicate with creatures of other planes, and some learn

Abyssal and Celestial.

Names: Neraphim have given names and house names.

Those exiled from a house are usually ceremonially stripped

of  their  house  names,  though  some  continue  to  refer  to

themselves as such, while others take appellations similar

to the Exile, the Stricken, or the Houseless.

Male  Names:  Anh,  Cado,  Hao,  Sam,  Tam,  Teo,  Thanh,

Thuan, Van, Xuan.

Female  Names:  Chi,  Hyunh,  Lan,  Mai,  Nam,  Tham,

Trinh, Yen.

House Names: Spent River, Hanging Cliff, Invisible Sea,

Lost Mountain, Burning Water, Living Stone.

Adventurers:  With  little  to  no  prospect  of  returning

to his or her house, and with even less prospect of joining

another house, an exiled neraph makes a perfect adventurer.

Exiles who embrace this path soon learn to excel, for the

skills that allow them to hunt in the changing seas of Limbo

are useful elsewhere. Against all odds, some exiles adven-

ture in order to complete a great quest or meet some other

condition imposed by a house matriarch that might allow

them back into a house. However, once a neraph discovers

the greater cosmos, he or she seldom wishes to return to a

primitive and nomadic lifestyle.

NERAPH RACIAL TRAITS

Neraphim have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

Outsider: Neraphim are native to the plane of Limbo, and

thus  have  the  outsider  type.  They  gain  the  extraplanar

subtype when not on Limbo. They are not subject to spells

or effects that affect only humanoids, such as charm person

and dominate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, neraphim have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A neraphs base land speed is 30 feet.

Neraphim have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Neraph Camou age (Ex): When charging an opponent or

when using a thrown weapon, neraphim can use a tech-

nique known as motion camou age (also called neraph

camou age  by  other  races),  which  predatory  insects

use to trick prey into thinking they are stationary even

though they are moving closer. The target creature can

be fooled into believing that the charging neraph or the

neraphs thrown weapon is in fact not moving closer, or

moving closer only very slowly.

A neraph can make one camou age attack per enemy

per encounter (once a foe sees the attack in action, that

foe  can  discern  it  for  what  it  is  for  the  duration  of  that

combat). Creatures that are subject to a neraphs charge or

that are targeted by a weapon thrown by a neraph may not

apply their Dexterity bonuses to their Armor Class. All

conditions that pertain when a foe cannot apply his Dex-

terity bonus to Armor Class also pertain to the neraphs

attack  (for  instance,  a  sneak  attack  could  also  be  made

with this attack, if the neraph can make such an attack).

Leap (Ex): Neraphim are natural jumpers. They have a +5

racial bonus on Jump checks.

Weapon Familiarity: Neraphim may treat the annulat (see

page 68) as a martial weapon rather than an exotic weapon.

+2 Natural Armor: Natural skin encrustations grant nera-

phim some protection against harm.

Skills:  Neraphim  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Spot  and

Search checks.

Automatic Languages: Neraph, Slaad. Bonus Languages:

Common, Celestial, Abyssal.

Favored Class: Ranger.

SHADOWSWYFTS

Shadowswyfts are planetouched beings with ancestry from

the Plane of Shadow.

Personality: Shadowswyfts are mercurial in temperament.

They delight in action and in acting now. Delay or inactivity

irritates shadowswyfts. In the amount of time it takes to for-

mulate and evaluate a plan, worlds could be won or lost.

Physical  Description:  Shadowswyfts  little  resemble

other  races.  Tall  and  slender,  they  have  skin  ranging  in

hue  from  medium  brown  to  lustrous  black  and  almost

completely  black,  slanted  eyes.  Their  dark  coloring  and

light build make them very adept at hiding in shadows and

moving quietly. The average male shadowswyft stands more

than 6 feet tall and weighs about 165 pounds, with females

somewhat shorter and lighter.  Shadowswyfts reach adult-

hood at about the same age as a half-orc, but its rare for a

shadowswyft to live beyond age 60.

Relations: To a shadowswyft, ones actions are much

more  important  than  ones  species.  Shadowswyfts  will

associate with chaotic creatures of all kinds. These alli-

ances rarely last long, but they usually end amicably with

the shadowswyft moving on to journey with other people

in far- ung places.

Alignment:  Shadowswyfts  tend  to  be  chaotic.  Their

generally  short  attention  span  and  love  of  action  without

thought  for  its  consequences  is  incompatible  with  lawful

philosophies.

Religion: The most common religion among the shadow-

swyfts is the worship of Olidammara, the god of rogues.

Shadowswyfts who do not worship the Laughing Rogue

generally choose to travel and adventure, and they favor

Fharlanghn or Boccob.

Language: Since shadowswyfts can see very well in low

light and in darkness, their language utilizes sound and

kinesics (body language including body movements, posi-

tion,  and  facial  expressions).  To  convey  the  full  extent  of

meaning in written works, a variety of symbols are used. Its

not unusual for a single word to be accompanied by three or

four symbols to help show its connotations and subtleties.

Names: Shadowswyft names tend to be short, usually

monosyllabic,  and  accompanied  by  a  signifying  gesture.

feel  the  pull  to  adventuring

diversity  of  activity.  An  adventur-

ing life is one  lled with action

and  change,  and  thus  is

well suited to the shadow-

SPIKERS

Spikers  are  of  the  same  general

ancestry as bladelings (see Monster

Manual II). Both races hail from

Acheron, but scholarly specu-

lation places their origins on

the Nine Hells of Baator, the

Bleak Eternity of Gehenna,

or  even  some  unknown

metal-based plane.

Personality:  Spikers,

like  bladelings,  share  a  great

love  of  battle.  They  bravely

enter  combat,  often  focusing

their attacks on the most danger-

ous opponent they perceive.

Physical  Description:  The

skin of a spiker is of a dull metallic

hue,  spotted  with  patches  of  metal-

lic  spines.  A  spikers  eyes  are  a  deep

violet,  and  its  blood  is  black  and

oily.  Spikers  are  about  as  tall

as  humans  but  are  considerably

heavier,  with  the  average  male

weighing over 200 pounds and

the  average  female  about  40

pounds  lighter.  Spikers  dont

reach adulthood until past the

age of 30, and even the longest-

lived among the race dont survive

to see the end of their ninth decade.

Outsider:  Shadowswyfts  are  native  to  the

Plane of Shadow, and thus have the outsider

type.  They  gain  the  extraplanar  subtype

when not on the Plane of Shadow. They are not subject to

spells or effects that affect only humanoids, such as charm

person and dominate person.

Medium:  As  Medium  creatures,  shadowswyfts  have  no

A shadowswyft rogue

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A shadowswyfts base land speed is 40 feet.

Shadowswyfts  have  darkvision  out  to  120  feet  and  low-

light vision.

Light Blindness (Ex): Abrupt exposure to bright light

(such as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds a shadowswyft

for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, it is dazzled as long

as it remains in the affected area.

+2  bonus  on  initiative  checks:  Shadowswyfts  have

quick reactions.

14

Relations:  Spikers  are  conservative  about

trusting  other  races,  and  they  tend  to  be  very  cautious

around anyone other than fellow spikers and bladelings.

Alignment:  Spikers  tend  toward  lawful  alignments,

gravitating  toward  lawful  neutral  or  lawful  evil.  Lawful

good  and  nonlawful  spikers  are  uncommon,  but  not

unheard of, though such characters usually choose to leave

Acheron to travel the planes.

Religion: Hextors emphasis on law and war appeals to

most spikers. Sometimes the sheer joy of battle fosters an

af nity for Kord, and many spikers who worship the god of

strength choose to be barbarians.

Language:  Spikers  speak  Common.  Many  also  learn

Infernal.

Names: Spiker names tend toward visceral or combat-

oriented words, with no gender differentiation. A spikers

 rst  name  is  usually  a  simple  one  (often  a  weapon  or  a

combat-focused  verb)  given  at  birth.  The  second  name  is

usually a nickname earned in adolescence or adulthood.

First Names: Dirk, Grip, Parry, Rend, Spike, Thrust.

Second  Names:  Bloodletter,  Demonbane,  Falldown,  Far-

traveler, Gutrender, Spellfodder.

Adventurers: Spikers love combat. The best way to test

ones  bravery  and  skill  is  through  serious,  no-punches-

pulled   ghting.  Thus,  the  adventuring  life  offers  ideal

opportunities for a spiker to test her mettle. Also, spikers

who do not have a lawful neutral or lawful evil worldview

 nd themselves mis ts in the spiker society on Acheron.

SPIKER RACIAL TRAITS

Spikers have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

Humanoid (Extraplanar): Spikers are humanoids native

to Acheron. They gain the extraplanar subtype when not

on Acheron.

Medium: As Medium creatures, spikers have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A spikers base land speed is 30 feet.

Spikers have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Natural Armor: A spikers metallic hide offers protec-

tion from physical attacks in the form of a +1 bonus to

natural armor.

2/bludgeoning:

A  spikers  spiny

skin  grants  resis-

tance  to  bludgeoning

attacks,  though  pierc-

ing  or  slashing  attacks

slip through normally.

Resistance to acid 5: Despite

the metallic hue of their hide,

spikers  are  not  metallic  in

nature  and  suffer  no  special

effect from rusting attacks and

the like.

Weapon Pro ciency: Spikers receive

the Martial Weapon Pro ciency feat for

armor spikes as a bonus feat. This allows

them  to  use  their  natural  spiked  skin  as  a

weapon without penalty (see below).

Natural Spikes (Ex): A spikers skin is replete with

sharp, jagged spikes. A spiker can deal extra pierc-

ing  damage  on  a  successful  grapple  check,  or

deal piercing damage with

a  melee  attack,  as  if  she

wore armor spikes.

Because of their spiked

skin,  spikers  have  a  dif -

cult time wearing armor. The maximum

Dexterity bonus of the armor is reduced

by 1, and the armor check penalty is worsened by 2. For

instance, a chain shirt worn by a spiker has a maximum

Dexterity bonus of +3 (instead of +4) and an armor check

penalty of 4 (rather than 2). These changes dont affect

the armors arcane spell failure chance, nor do they apply

to shields used by the spiker.

Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Language: Infernal.

Favored Class: Fighter.

TIEFLINGS

Carrying  the  taint  of  evil  in  their  formsand  perhaps

their very soulstie ings are often persecuted and feared

throughout the planes. The distant descendants of humans

and evil outsiders, tie ings are regarded as twisted, devi-

ous, and untrustworthy. More often than not, this opinion

is accurate.

Personality:  Tie ings  live  as  outcasts  from  an  early

ageas soon as their heritage shows itselfwhich contrib-

utes to their bitter outlook on life. Tie ings learn to keep

others at a distance, often compensating for their loss with

cruelty or depravity.

Physical  Description:  Tie ings  look  human  (and  are

roughly  the  same  height  and  weight  as  members  of  that

race), except for one or two distinguishing features related

to their unusual ancestry. Some examples of these features

include  small  horns,  pointed  teeth,  red  eyes,  a

whiff  of  brimstone  about  them,  cloven  feet,  or

red skin. No two tie ings look alike.

Tie ings  reach  adulthood  at  about  the

same  age  as  humans  but  are  longer-lived,

with the eldest members of the race living to

be 150 years old.

Relations: Tie ings treat most other

races  equallyat  arms

length.  They  are  very

slow  to  trust  others  and

always  wary  of  a  friend

suddenly  becoming

an enemy. Aasimars,

bariaurs,  and  wil-

dren often trigger

an  instinctive

fear or revulsion

in tie ings, making it dif cult for them to work together

at all.

Tie ings  respect  other  mixed-breed  races  that  have  to

put up with persecution and derision, including half-orcs

and  mephlings.  Still,  a  tie ing  isnt  more  likely  to  trust  a

member of one of these races; shes just more likely to under-

stand their perspective.

Alignment:  Tieflings  tend  toward  evil  alignments,

though neutral tieflings are not uncommon. Those who

choose a life of goodand manage to stick to itare

particularly rare.

Religion:  Tie ings  have  no  common

deity. Most choose to worship evil

deities  such  as  Erythnul,  god  of

slaughter;  Vecna,  god  of  secrets;

or Hextor, god of tyranny. Neu-

tral  tieflings  may  venerate

Wee  Jas,  goddess  of  death

and  magic,  or  Olidammara,

god  of  thieves.  Still  others

choose  to  pay  homage  to

arch ends whose names

are best not mentioned.

Language:  Tie ings

share no common language.

Some learn Infernal or Abys-

sal,  although  since  most

have no idea where their

bloodline  comes  from,

as often as not they choose

the wrong racial language. A

tie ing  usually  learns  the  lan-

guage of her parents as well.

Names: As a rule, tie ings

use human names until such

time as they seek to differen-

tiate  themselves  from  their

parents.  At  that  point,  they

often  take  names  that  hint  at

their   endish  heritage.  Some

choose  words  of  Infernal  or

Abyssal  that  sound  menac-

ing, occasionally without even

knowing the words de nitions.

Adventurers:  As  natural  outcasts,

tie ings  often  follow  a  life  of  adventure  and

intrigue. Those that hew to their heritage become thieves,

brigands, or killers. Some tie ings reject their tainted blood

and seek the light, aiming to help those in need.

WILDREN

Over  time,  the  petitioners

(spirits of the departed) who

arrive  in  the  Wilderness

of  the  Beastlands  acquire

animal traits, eventually becom-

ing  celestial  beasts  or  animals.

Some  instead  mingle  with  the

beasts they will one day become,

creating  new  races  that  are  perpetu-

ally  half-animal,  half-humanoid.

Prominent  among  these  are  the

wildren,  beings  descended  from

the  union  of  partially  trans-

formed  dwarf  petitioners  and

celestial badgers.

Prowling  the  darkest  forests

of  Karasuthra,  the  Beastlands

lowest  layer,  wildren  build  elabo-

rate underground burrows, which they

defend, out of a commingled racial memory, to

the  death.  Often  short-tempered  and  vengeful,

wildren  generally  live  solitary  lives,  emerging  only  occa-

sionally from their burrows to hunt and seek mates.

Personality: Wildren are edgy and easily riled, though

loyal  to  those  who  befriend  them  and,  on  rare  occasions,

even playful (especially toward their young). They are most

savage and feral when on the defensive, though they are still

quite formidable on the attack.

Physical  Description:  The  typical  wildren  looks  like

a  dwarf  covered  in  short,  grizzled  dark  fur,  with  a  broad

TIEFLING RACIAL TRAITS

Tie ings have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, 2 Charisma.

Outsider:  Tie ings  are  outsiders  native  to  the  Material

Plane, and thus have the outsider (native) type. They gain

16

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   16

5/20/04, 11:11:38 AM

white  stripe  of  fur  running  from  the  bridge  of  the  nose

over the top of the head and down to the base of the skull. A

wildrens arms are unnaturally large and well-muscled, and

her  ngers end in hard claws 2 to 3 inches long. Wildren

constantly emit a fetid odor.

On  average,  wildren  are  slightly  taller  and  slightly

lighter than dwarves. They reach adulthood at the same

age  as  dwarves  but  mature  more  rapidly  thereafter.  Its

possible  for  a  wildren  to  live  for  more  than  500  years,

but the races average life span is about 200 years shorter

than that.

Relations: Most wildren spend their lives hunting in

the perpetual night of Karasuthra. After a mating pair has

raised a child to adulthood, they drive it from the burrow,

forcing it to seek its own fortune. These wildren usually

dig their own burrows far from their birthplace, but some

never settle down, moving from layer to layer of the Beast-

lands in search of a new family. They come to see life as

one  long  hunting  expedition  and  can  travel  far  a eld  in

search of adventure. They are most comfortable on planes

where wildlife is abundant, especially if the ground lends

itself to the creation of a burrow. Though the average wil-

dren  nds beings of other races strange and threatening,

adventuring wildren generally feel that way only toward

the evil races. Wildren of any kind are most uncomfortable

in cities, though they can cope if provided with a burrow-

like place to sleep.

Alignment: The average wildren is chaotic good, tending

toward neutral good. A few are neutral or chaotic neutral.

Religion: Most wildren pay homage to Ehlonna, not nec-

essarily in the form of actual worship but more as a show of

respect for the most dangerous animal in their immediate

environment. Wildren rarely become clerics, but some are

happy as druids.

Language: The wildren language

is  actually  an  amalgam  of

Common,  Dwarven,  and

badger growling. It is not

truly  a  separate  tongue,  but

rather  a  convenient  medium

for members of a race who share

the same three languages.

Names:  Wildren  usu-

ally  have  only  a  spoken

name,  other wise  recogniz-

ing one another by scent. (They

often see nonwildren in the same light

and are confused by individuals with

more than one nameand even

more confused by individu-

als  who  wear  perfume  or

cologne.)

Male Names: Arl, Brum,

Durrl, Grunnur, Morrm,

Nall, Vruk.

Female Names: Brayarr, Dierrel, Hugk, Mrall, Purruk,

Vap.

Adventurers: Only unsettled wildren become adventur-

ers. Without a home, but missing the camaraderie of family,

they join up with other homeless (in other words, adventur-

ing) characters to relive some of that experience.

WILDREN RACIAL TRAITS

Wildren have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

+4 Constitution, 2 Dexterity, 2 Charisma. Wildren are

extremely durable, but they are slow to react and have a

reserved personality.

Outsider:  Wildren  are  native  to  the  Wilderness  of  the

Beastlands, and thus have the outsider type. They gain

the extraplanar subtype when not in the Beastlands. They

are not subject to spells or effects that affect only human-

oids, such as charm person and dominate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, wildren have no special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A wildrens base land speed is 20 feet. She can move at

this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor

or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other

creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).

Wildren have a burrow speed of 10 feet. In soil or loose

dirt, a wildren can build a warren large enough for one

Medium creature in the space of 1 hour.

Wildren have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Wildren have the scent ability. See page 314 of the Monster

Manual for details.

Wildren have two primary claw attacks that are natural

weapons,  dealing  points  of  damage  equal  to  1d4  +  the

wildrens Str bonus.

Fury (Ex): Once per day, a wildren who has taken at least

1 point of damage can choose to enter a brief state of rage-

like fury at the beginning of her next turn. In this state, a

wildren gains +4 to Strength and 2 to Armor Class. The

fury lasts for 1 round, and a wildren cannot end her

fury voluntarily. The effect of this ability stacks

with  similar  effects  (such  as  the  barbarians

rage class feature).

Stability (Ex): Wildren are exception-

ally stable on their feet. A wildren has

a +4 bonus on ability checks made to

resist being bull rushed or tripped

when standing on the ground (but

not  when  climbing,   ying,  riding,

or otherwise not standing  rmly on

the ground).

Automatic Languages:

Wildren  speak  Com-

mon  and  Dwarven,  and

are able to communicate

with  badgers  as  though

under  the  effect  of  a  speak

with  animals  spell  that  affects

AGE, HEIGHT, AND WEIGHT

The details of your characters age, gender, height, weight,

and appearance are up to you. However, if you prefer some

rough  guidelines  in  determining  these  details,  refer  to

Tables 12 through 14.

CHARACTER AGE

Your  characters  age  at  the  start  of  his  or  her  adventuring

career  is  determined  by  your  choice  of  race  and  class,  as

summed up on Table 12: Random Starting Ages.

As  your  character  advances  in  age,  use  Table  13:  Aging

Effects to determine when he or she reaches a new age cat-

egory and must adjust his or her ability scores accordingly

(see page 109 of the Players Handbook for more information).

POWERFUL RACES

On the planes, many options exist for playing strange extra-

planar creatures. In addition to the normal races available

to players and the new races presented in this book, some

monsters are playable as characters. If you want to play a par-

ticular extraplanar monster because you  nd it interesting,

these rules allow you to emphasize the creatures identity,

rather than diluting that identity by adding levels of stan-

dard character classes.

Selecting a monster as your character race presents its

own dif culties and has special rules to cover its use. The

monsters in this section are presented as a hybrid between

a typical race and a character class. This format is based on

the rules presented in Savage Species, and is an alternative

to the monster advancement system described in Chapter

4 of the Monster Manual. DMs may use either that system

or this one.

Some of the monsters appearing in this chapter have

appeared  as  monster  classes  in  previous  products.  The

versions  appearing  here  are  fully  updated  to  match  their

statistics in the current Monster Manual, and should be con-

sidered to supersede any previous versions.

Entering a Monster Class: The only way to take a level

of a monster class is to be that creature. A chain devil cannot

multiclass as a hound archon, nor can a human take levels as

a lillend.

Each monster class table has a CR (Challenge Rating) column.

This information has no meaning for players or player char-

acters and is given only as an aid to DMs who want to adjust

monster CRs by regressing existing creatures.

Natural Attacks: Many creatures have natural attacks.

Members  of  a  monster  class  are  always  pro cient  with

their own natural weapons. Using a natural attack does not

provoke an attack of opportunity unless the class descrip-

tion  speci es otherwise. A monster does not get multiple

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   18

5/20/04, 11:11:50 AM

attacks  with  the  same  weapon  at  a  cumulative  5  penalty

(as a manufactured weapon would provide) on a full attack

action with its natural weapons unless the class description

speci es otherwise. A monster character can use any of its

natural weapons as a secondary attack at a 5 penalty on the

attack roll, but it may not use a secondary attack as a primary

attack,  even  if  it  doesnt  choose  to  use  its  actual  primary

attack in a given round. The Multiattack feat (see page 304

of the Monster Manual) can lessen the penalty on secondary

attacks to 2.

Monster Classes and Multiclassing: A monster char-

acter using these rules may not multiclass until it completes

the  full  progression  in  its  monster  class.  This  rule  keeps

characters  from  gaining  the  bene ts  of  a  monsters  type

and then quickly switching to a standard class.

A  monster  class  does  not  impose  an  experience  point

penalty for multiclassing, as other classes do.

Monster  Classes  and  Level-Dependent  Bene  ts:  A

character  progressing  in  a  monster  class  gains  feats  and

ability score increases according to Table 32: Experience

and  Level-Dependent  Bene ts,  page  22  of  the  Players

Handbook.

AVORAL GUARDINAL

Outsider (Extraplanar, Good, Guardinal)

In their home on Elysium, avoral guardinals are peaceful

and friendly. Elsewhere, they serve as powerful emissaries

of pure good, confronting evil wherever they  nd it. Adven-

turing  avorals  are  more  common  than  one  might  think,

since they often travel the planes in search of evil activities

to thwart.

avoral guardinal can heal an amount of damage equal to his

full normal hit points.

Resistance to Cold and Sonic (Ex): An avoral guardi-

nal gains resistance to cold 5 and sonic 5 at 7th level. These

resistances improve to 10 at 11th level.

Fear Aura (Su): Once per day, a 13th-level avoral guardi-

nal can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. It is other-

wise identical to fear from an 8th-level caster (save DC 14 +

Cha modi er).

True Seeing (Su): At 15th level, an avoral guardinal gains

the ability to see through illusions, invisibility, and the like.

This ability is identical to true seeing (caster level 14th), except

that it has personal range and the avoral must concentrate for

1 round before it takes effect. Thereafter, the ability remains

in effect as long as the avoral concentrates on it.

CHAIN DEVIL

Outsider (Evil, Extraplanar, Lawful)

Truly lawful evil, chain devils (also called kytons)  t into

the hierarchy of hell as  erce enforcers and disciplinarians.

They  usually  fall  under  the  command  of  higher-echelon

bone devils who serve as the police force of Baator. Some

chain  devils  travel  the  planes,  spreading  their  particular

brand of evil and tyranny throughout the multiverse.

In  their  native  environment  of  the  Nine  Hells  of  Baator,

chain  devils  wrap  themselves  in  chains  instead  of  wearing

clothing. If actively adventuring elsewhere, they usually deign

to wear clothing under their chains. The chains give them a +4

armor bonus, the equivalent of a chain shirt. They may wear

other armor, in which case they gain whichever armor bonus

is higher, but they are not naturally pro cient with it.

CHAIN DEVIL RACIAL TRAITS

+2 Strength, 4 Intelligence.

Outsider: Chain devils are native to The Nine Hells of

Baator, and thus have the outsider type. They gain the

extraplanar subtype when not on Baator. They are not

subject  to  spells  or  effects  that  affect  only  humanoids,

such as charm person and dominate person.

Medium:  As  Medium  creatures,  chain  devils  have  no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A chain devils base land speed is 30 feet.

Chain devils have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: Chain devils have a +8 racial bonus on Craft checks

involving metalwork.

Automatic Languages: Infernal and Common.

Favored Class: Chain devil. The best multiclassing choice

for a kyton is rogue,  ghter, or barbarian.

Level  adjustment:  A  chain  devil  that  has  progressed

through its monster class has 8 Hit Dice and a level adjust-

ment of +6, making it effectively a 14th-level character.

CLASS SKILLS

The  chain  devils  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (any involving metalwork) (Int),

Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Listen  (Wis),  and

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  chain  devil

monster class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Chain devils are pro-

 cient with all simple and martial weapons, and all chains.

A chain devils natural weapons, as well as any weapons it

wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Spiked Chains: Chain devils treat spiked chains as pri-

mary natural weapons and can make two attacks per round

with them. Each attack uses the kytons full Strength bonus.

Feats: A chain devil receives one feat at 1st level and addi-

tional feats at 4th and 10th level. After 14th level, it gains

feats normally according to its Hit Dice, as shown on Table

32: Experience and Level-Dependent Bene ts, page 22 of

the Players Handbook.

Dancing  Chains  (Su):  A  chain  devils  most  awesome

attack  is  its  ability  to  control  up  to  four  chains  within  20

feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move

as it wishes. At 2nd level, a chain devil can control only one

chain. It gains additional chains at 4th, 8th, and 12th level.

In  addition,  a  chain  devil  can  increase  these  chains

length by up to 15 feet and cause them to sprout razor-edged

barbs. These chains attack as effectively as the devil itself. If

a chain is in another creatures possession, the creature can

attempt a DC 15 Will save to break the chain devils power

over that chain. If the save is successful, the kyton cannot

attempt to control that particular chain again for 24 hours

or until the chain leaves the creatures possession.

A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal

land speed without making Climb checks.

Unnerving Gaze (Su): Range 30 feet, Will save (DC 10

+ 1/2 Hit Dice + Cha modi er) negates. A chain devil can

make its face resemble one of an opponents departed loved

ones or bitter enemies. Those who fail their saves take a 2

penalty on attack rolls for 1d3 rounds.

Regeneration (Ex): Chain devils take normal damage

from silver weapons, good-aligned weapons, and spells or

effects with the good descriptor.

A chain devil that loses a piece of its body regrows it in

2d610 minutes. Holding the severed member against the

stump enables it to reattach instantly.

HOUND ARCHON

Outsider (Archon, Extraplanar, Good, Lawful)

Hound  archons  travel  throughout  the  Upper  Planes,

serving  the  greater  powers  as  protectors  and  defenders

against evil. Hound archons serve powerful masters, but

their  duties  often  allow  them  to  visit  other  planes  and

interact  with  other  creatures.  Their  broad  shoulders  and

meaty  sts mark hound archons as able combatants. Like-

wise, their strong legs indicate that  eeing enemies wont

get very far.

HOUND ARCHON RACIAL TRAITS

Hound  archons  have  the  following  racial  abilities  and

characteristics.

Outsider:  Hound  archons  are  native  to  the  Seven

Mounting Heavens of Celestia, and thus have the out-

sider type. They gain the extraplanar subtype when not

on Celestia. They are not subject to spells or effects that

affect only humanoids, such as charm person and domi-

nate person.

Medium: As Medium creatures, hound archons have no

special bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A hound archons base land speed is 40 feet.

Hound archons have darkvision out to 60 feet and low-

light vision.

swords) and can bite when in canine form (see below).

Slam (Ex): A hound archon has one secondary slam attack

that is a natural weapon and deals damage as indicated on

Table  18  plus  1/2  its  Strength  bonus.  A  hound  archon

a weapon.

Natural Armor: A hound archon has +2 natural armor at

1st level. This bonus increases as the creature gains higher

levels, as shown on Table 18.

Hound  archons  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  saves  against

poison.

Resistance to electricity 5: A hound archon has resis-

tance to electricity that improves as the creature gains

higher levels.

Skills: While in canine form (an ability a hound archon

gains at higher levels), a hound archon has a +4 circum-

stance bonus on Hide and Survival checks.

Automatic Languages: Celestial, Draconic, Infernal, Sylvan.

Favored Class: Hound archon. The best multiclass choices

for a hound archon are  ghter and paladin.

Level  adjustment:  A  hound  archon  that  has  progressed

through its monster class has 6 Hit Dice and a level adjust-

ment of +5, making it effectively an 11th-level character.

CLASS SKILLS

skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Hide

(Dex), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Sense

Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4:

Table 18: The Hound Archon

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the hound archon

monster class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Hound  archons  are

pro cient with all simple and martial weapons. They are not

pro cient with any type of armor or shield.

Feats: A hound archon gains feats normally according to its

Tongues  (Su):  Beginning  at  4th  level,  a  hound  archon

can  speak  with  any  creature  that  has  a  language,  as  the

active unless the hound archon chooses to disable it as a free

action. The effect can be dispelled, but the hound archon

can create it again on its next turn as a free action.

Change  Shape  (Su):  A  hound  archon  of  5th  level  or

higher can assume any canine form of Small to Large size.

While in canine form, the hound archon loses its bite, slam,

and greatsword attacks, but gains the bite attack of the form

it chooses. For the purposes of this ability, canines include

any doglike or wol ike animal of the animal type.

Scent (Ex): At 5th level, a hound archon gains the scent

ability. See page 314 of the Monster Manual for details.

Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds hound

sorcerer. It can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds

immunity to electricity and petri cation.

Magic Circle against Evil (Su): This effect continually

surrounds a hound archon of 11th level, as the spell cast by

a cleric of a level equal to the hound archons Hit Dice from

class levels.

JANNI

Outsider (Native)

Formed of all four elements, the jann spend most of their

time on the Material Plane. They tend to favor privacy, but

can  easily  pass  as  human.  Curious  (or  outcast)  jann  often

spend  time  among  humans  and  other  races,  sometimes

even forming bonds of friendship. The nomadic lifestyle of

a janni transfers well to the life of an adventurer, and a cou-

rageous  janni  who  undertakes  one  exciting  venture  often

 nds himself pursuing another and another.

JANNI RACIAL TRAITS

Janni  characters  have  the  following  racial  abilities  and

characteristics.

+2 Wisdom.

and thus have the outsider (native) type. They gain the

Table 19: The Janni

extraplanar  subtype  when  not  on  the  Material  Plane.

They are not subject to spells or effects that affect only

humanoids, such as charm person and dominate person.

Medium:  As  Medium  creatures,  jann  have  no  special

bonuses or penalties due to their size.

A jannis base land speed is 30 feet.

Jann have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Improved Initiative: A janni has Improved Initiative as a

bonus feat.

Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Languages: Abys-

sal, Aquan, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, Terran.

Favored Classes: Janni and rogue.

Level adjustment: A janni that has progressed through its

monster class has 6 Hit Dice and a level adjustment of +5,

making it effectively an 11th-level character.

CLASS SKILLS

The  jannis  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each  skill)

are Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Escape

Artist (Dex), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Ride (Dex),

Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the janni mon-

ster class.

feats at 5th and 11th level. After 11th level, it gains feats

normally according to its Hit Dice, as shown on Table 32:

Experience  and  Level-Dependent  Bene ts,  page  22  of  the

Players Handbook.

Change Size (Sp): Twice per day, a janni of 2nd level or

higher  can  magically  change  a  creatures  size.  This  effect

works just like an  enlarge person or reduce person spell (the

janni chooses which when using the ability), except that the

ability can work on the janni. The target can make a Forti-

tude save (DC 12 + jannis Cha modi er) to resist the effect.

This effect is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

Natural  Armor:  At  2nd  level,  a  janni  gains  a  natural

armor bonus of +1.

Hound archon

Resistance  to  Fire  (Ex):  A  3rd-level  janni  gains  resis-

tance to  re 5. This resistance increases to 10 at 7th level.

Speak  with  Animals  (Sp):  At  3rd  level  and  higher,  a

janni  can  use  speak  with  animals  three  times  per  day  as  a

12th-level caster.

Invisibility (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, a janni can use

invisibility (self only) once per day as a 12th-level caster. He

can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and three times

Fly: At 5th level, a janni gains the ability to  y at a speed of

10 feet with perfect maneuverability. His  y speed increases

to 20 feet at 10th level.

Create Food and Water (Sp): A janni of 7th level or higher

can use create food and water once per day as a 7th-level caster.

Elemental Endurance (Ex): At 9th level, a janni gains the

ability to survive for up to 48 hours on any of the elemental

planes of (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water). Failure to return to the

Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take

1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental

plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

Plane Shift (Sp): At 9th level and higher, a janni can use

plane shift to enter any of the elemental planes, the Astral

Plane, or the Material Plane. This ability works once per day

and  transports  the  janni  and  up  to  eight  other  creatures,

provided they all link hands with the janni. It is otherwise

similar  to  the  plane  shift  spell  (caster  level  13th).  At  11th

level, a janni can use this ability at will.

Telepathy (Su): At 10th level and higher, a janni can com-

municate telepathically with any other creature within 100

LILLEND

Outsider (Chaotic, Extraplanar, Good)

The ultimate aesthete, a lillend values beauty above all.

Lillends appreciate magni cence in every aspect of art. They

take  pleasure  in  lovely  items  such  as  paintings  and  sculp-

tures. More esoteric creations ranging from poetry to  ower

arranging also please them. Lillends care intensely about the

natural beauty of a forest spring, a windswept mountain, or

an unspoiled limestone cave. Those who take up the life of

an adventurer do so to actively protect the treasures of beauty

and art, or to punish those who would destroy such things.

LILLEND RACIAL TRAITS

Lillends have the following racial abilities and characteristics.

+2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma.

Outsider:  Lillends  are  native  to  the  Heroic  Domains  of

Ysgard,  and  thus  have  the  outsider  type.  They  gain  the

extraplanar  subtype  when  not  on  Ysgard.  They  are  not

subject  to  spells  or  effects  that  affect  only  humanoids,

such as charm person and dominate person.

Large: As Large creatures, lillends have a 1 penalty to Armor

Class,  a  1  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  a  4  penalty  on  Hide

checks, and a +4 bonus on grapple checks. Their lifting and

carrying limits are double those of a Medium character.

A lillends base land speed is 20 feet. Lillends also have a

 y speed of 70 feet with average maneuverability.

Lillends have darkvision out to 60 feet.

Skills: Lillends have a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks.

Automatic  Languages:  Celestial,  Infernal,  Abyssal,

Common.

Favored Class: Lillend. The best multiclassing choice for

a lillend is bard.

Level adjustment: A lillend that has progressed through

its monster class has 7 Hit Dice and a level adjustment of

+6, making it effectively a 13th-level character.

CLASS SKILLS

The lillends class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Appraise (Int), Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowl-

edge (arcana) (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Sense Motive

(Wis),  Spellcraft  (Int),  Spot  (Wis),  and  Survival  (Wis).  See

Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the lillend mon-

ster class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Lillends are pro cient

with all simple and martial weapons.

A  lillends  natural  weapons,  as  well  as  any  weapons  it

wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for

the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Saving Throws: A lillend has a +5 racial bonus on saving

throws against poison.

Tail Slap: A lillend has a tail slap attack that is a natural

weapon dealing the damage indicated on Table 110 plus 1/2

the lillends Strength bonus.

Feats:  A  lillend  receives  one  feat  at  1st  level  and  addi-

tional feats at 4th and 10th level. After 13th level, it gains

feats normally according to its Hit Dice, as shown on Table

32: Experience and Level-Dependent Bene ts, page 22 of

the Players Handbook.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  lillend  deals  points  of  damage  equal

to  2d6  +  its  Str  modi er  with  a  successful  grapple  check.

Constricting uses the entire lower portion of its body, so it

cannot take any move actions when constricting, though it

can still attack with its sword.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a lillend must

hit  with  its  tail  slap  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to  start  a

grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  an  attack  of

opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it  establishes  a

hold and can constrict.

Bard Abilities: A lillend has the spellcasting and bardic

music ability of a bard of 1/2 its class level.

Spell-Like Abilities: As they advance in level, lillends

gain certain spell-like abilities, or more uses per day for an

existing ability.

At 2nd level, a lillend can use speak with animals once

per day.

At 3rd level, it gains charm person, darkness, and knock once

per day each.

At 4th level, darkness and knock become usable twice per day.

At 5th level, a lillend gains speak with plants once per day

and can use darkness and knock three times per day.

At  8th  level,  it  gains  hallucinatory  terrain  three  times

planar adventurer may seek fame, power, and knowl-

edge to right a wrong, to spread the holy word, or

sometimes  to  perpetuate  evil.  The  methods  each

adventurer employs to achieve an end vary by the

adventurers class. Standard classes include those that use

combat, magic, skills, or a combination of these approaches;

these classes are found in the Players Handbook.

Class  possibilities  are  all  the  wider  when  one  consid-

ers  the  trans nite  expanse  of  the  multiverse.  Of  course,

the members of standard classes can venture out past the

Material Plane with the tools already available to them; at

least, many of the spellcasting classes can. But sometimes

players hunger for new vistas and new opportunities.

PLANAR

SUBSTITUTION LEVELS

Despite  the  planar  cachet  associated  with  the  prestige

classes  in  this  book,  your  character  may  not  have  the

option of pursuing such a class. Taking planar substitu-

tion levels for your class is a way for you to continue taking

levels in your favorite class while still enhancing your abil-

ity to adventure in a multiplanar campaign.

Substitution levels are levels of a standard class that you

take to gain certain bene ts instead of the level bene ts

described for the next higher level of the standard class.

Taking  a  substitution  level  is  not  multiclassingyou

remain within the class for which the substitution level

is targeted. You cant take a substitution level and apply

it  to  another  class  for  which  the  substitution  level  is

not targeted. For instance, a  ghter cant take a planar

substitution level for the rogue or monk class.

To qualify to take a planar substitution level, you

must ful ll any one of the following criteria.

Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

Have a heritage feat (described later in this chapter).

Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Mate-

rial Plane.

Have  visited  a  plane  other  than  the  Material

Plane.

Every class has a number of planar substitution

levels,  each  of  which  you  may  select  at  a  speci-

 ed  class  level.  When  you  take  a  substitution

level for your class at a given level, you give up

the bene ts gained at that level for the standard

class,  and  you  get  the  substitution  level  bene ts

instead.  You  cant  go  back  and  gain  the  bene ts  for

the level you swapped outwhen you take your

next  level  in  the  standard  class,  you  gain  the

27

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   27

5/20/04, 12:46:49 PM

next higher level as if you had gained the previous level

normally. For instance, if you are a 3rd-level  ghter and

take the planar  ghter substitution level for 4th level, you

forever lose the bene ts normally provided to a standard

4th-level   ghter  (you  gained  instead  the  planar  substi-

tution  bene t  for  a  4th-level   ghter).  When  you  gain

another level in  ghter, you gain the 5th-level bene ts of

the standard  ghter class.

Unless  otherwise  noted  in  the  description  of  a  planar

substitution level bene t, a character who takes a planar

substitution  level  gains  spellcasting  ability  (increases  in

spells per day and spells known, if applicable) as if he had

taken this level in the standard class.

A character need not take all the substitution levels pro-

vided for a class. For instance, a barbarian may decide only

to take the planar substitution level for his class at 7th level,

ignoring the previous substitution levels.

The description of each substitution level bene t explains

what occurs to the standard class ability not gained, if that

ability would normally increase at a speci c rate (such as the

barbarians trap sense class feature).

Barbarians  who  strike  beyond  their  homeland  sometimes

 nd  that  they  go  far  indeed.  Barbarians  have  no  trouble

with the dangers, the miles, and the wonders that traveling

entails, and planar travel, while more grand, offers a barbar-

ian a chance to re ne his abilities with extraplanar enemies

in mind.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To take a barbarian planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take his 3rd, 7th, or 11th level of barbarian.

Class Skills

Barbarian planar substitution levels have the class skills

of  the  standard  barbarian  class  plus  Knowledge  (the

planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4+ Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  barbarians  planar

substitution levels.

Portal Sense (Su): The barbarians raw instincts provide

him with a supernatural sense concerning portals, planar

breaches, and other passages between planes. A barbarian

28

who takes the 3rd-level planar substitution level instantly

becomes aware of any portal within 30 feet of his location,

even if such a portal is normally invisible. In a sense, the

barbarian seems to sniff out the portal. If the barbarian

spends  a  few  rounds  snif ng  around  (taking  a  standard

action each round to do so), he learns additional informa-

tion about the portal (the rounds spent analyzing the portal

need not be consecutive):

Round 1: Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.

Round 2: Any special circumstances governing the portals

use, such as knowing that it can be activated only at speci c

times of the day (but not what those times are) or if a special

key or command word is needed to activate the portal (but

not what that key or command word is).

Round 3: A brief sense of the area the portal leads to; essen-

tially, the barbarian gains as much information as if he were

allowed to see the portals destination for 10 seconds, with-

out the bene t of any other sense or analysis.

This bene t replaces the trap sense class feature gained

by a standard barbarian at 3rd level. From now on, whenever

the barbarian gains a standard barbarian level that grants an

improvement to his trap sense, he gains the indicated bonus

minus 1 (trap sense +1 at 6th level, trap sense +2 at 9th level,

and so on).

Planar Damage Reduction (Ex): The barbarian tough-

ens  his  body  against  injuries  perpetrated  by  unnatural

creatures. A barbarian who takes the 7th-level planar sub-

stitution level gains the ability to shrug off some additional

amount of injury from each blow or attack made by an out-

sider  or  extraplanar  creature.  Subtract  2  points  from  the

damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage

from a weapon or a natural attack made by an outsider or

extraplanar creature. In effect, this bene t grants damage

reduction  2/  against  the  attacks  of  outsiders  or  extra-

planar creatures.

This bene t replaces the damage reduction 1/ gained by

a standard barbarian at 7th level. From now on, whenever

the  barbarian  gains  a  standard  barbarian  level  that  grants

an improvement to his damage reduction, he gains the indi-

cated amount minus 1 (1/ at 10th level, 2/ at 13th level,

and  so  on).  However,  the  planar  damage  reduction  value

stacks with the barbarians damage reduction against attacks

from outsiders or extraplanar creatures. For example, a 10th-

level  barbarian  would  have  damage  reduction  3/  against

outsiders and extraplanar creatures, but damage reduction

1/ against all other creatures.

Menacing  Rage  (Su):  The  barbarian  gains  an  espe-

cially potent fury against unnatural creatures not native

to  the  Material  Plane.  A  barbarian  who  takes  the  11th-

level  planar  substitution  level  generates  an  intangible

aura  of  danger  whenever  he  rages.  This  aura  weakens

hostile outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar sub-

type within 20 feet. Any outsider or extraplanar creature

within  that  area  must  attempt  a  Will  save  (DC  10  +  1/2

barbarians class level + barbarians Con modi er). Those

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   28

5/20/04, 12:46:53 PM

who fail the saving throw take a 2 penalty on attack rolls,

checks, and saves against the barbarian for 24 hours. This

is a mind-affecting ability. A creature that makes its ini-

tial save is not affected by that same barbarians menacing

rage for 24 hours.

This bene t replaces the greater rage class feature gained

by a standard barbarian at 11th level. If the barbarian later

quali es for the mighty rage class feature, he gains greater

rage instead.

BARD

Some hold that if one had the eyes to see, the world would

be  revealed  as  a  symphony  of  celestial  music,  each  theme

playing  out  its  part  on  the  stage

of  reality.  For  some  bards,  this

intuition is true. When they let

the  scales  slip  from  their  eyes,

they  see  the  underlying  overture

of music that connects all levels of

reality. With this knowledge, they

gain some ability to add refrains of

their  own  choosing.  This   ne-tuning

bypasses spellcasting and directly affects

what others see as reality.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To  take  a  bard  planar  substitution

level, a character must be about to take

his 3rd, 6th, or 12th level of bard.

Class Skills

Bard planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6+ Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  bards  planar  sub-

stitution levels. Each bene t takes the place of one of the

standard  bardic  music  abilities  and  costs  one  daily  use  of

bardic music.

Planar Inspiration (Su): A bard of 3rd level or higher

with  6  or  more  ranks  in  a  Perform  skill  who  selects  this

planar substitution bene t can use his music or poetics to

protect his allies from the alignment traits of a plane. The

bard must perform for a full minute, spending a standard

action  to  concentrate  on  his  performance  each  round.  At

the end of the performance, he makes a Perform check (DC

15 for mild alignment traits, or DC 25 for strong alignment

traits). The bard cant take 10 on this check.

Success indicates that the bard and each ally within 30

feet who heard the bard perform for the full minute dont

take the normal penalty on checks made on planes whose

alignments  differ  from  their  own  (see  Alignment  Traits,

page 149 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) for 24 hours. This is

a mind-affecting ability.

This bene t replaces the inspire competence bardic music

ability gained by a standard bard at 3rd level.

Portal  Dissonance  (Su):  A  bard  of  6th  level  or  higher

with  9  or  more  ranks  in  a  Perform  skill  who  selects  this

planar  substitution  bene t  can  use  music  or  poetics  to

in uence intraplanar and extraplanar portals, moderate or

severe planar breaches, and other discrete passages between

planes (complete planar breaches cannot be affected). The

portal,  breach,  or  other  qualifying  passage  to  be  affected

must be centered within 60 feet. The bard must know about

the portal.

Each  round  of  the  performance,  he  attempts  a  DC  20

Perform check. The bard cant take 10 on this check. Suc-

cess indicates that the bard can redirect the portal destina-

tion to the mouth of any other active portal or breach

he  has  personally  traveled  through  in  the  past  30

days.  Redirection  automatically  fails

if  the  portal  chosen  as  the  tempo-

rary  endpoint  is  no  longer  active.

Only  creatures  and  objects  are

affected  by  redirection,  not

traits (which leak through planar

breaches). Creatures that enter the

portal  from  the  bards  side  of  the

portal, or creatures that would other-

wise  arrive  at  the  bards  location

through  the  portal,  instead  arrive

at  the  endpoint  of  another  portal

chosen  by  the  bard  this  round.  The

portal  to  which  the  bard  redirects  travelers  continues  to

connect to its original destination; if a redirected creature

attempts  to  go  back  through  the  bard-in uenced  portal,

it doesnt return to the bards location, but instead to that

portals natural endpoint.

The bard may keep up the dissonance for 10 consecutive

rounds (this counts as one of the bards bardic music uses

per day).

This  bene t  replaces  the  suggestion  bardic  music  ability

gained by a standard bard at 6th level. If the bard later quali-

 es for the mass suggestion bardic music ability, he gains the

suggestion ability instead.

Planar Discordance (Su): A bard of 12th level or higher

with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this

planar  substitution  bene t  can  attempt  to  create  a  minor

planar breach (as the precipitate breach spell in Chapter 5). The

bard must perform for 1 full minute, spending a standard

action each round to concentrate on the performance.

gets a +2 bonus if the creatures alignment includes either

the chaotic or evil component, while a lawful neutral cleric

gains the bonus only against chaotic summoned creatures.)

Success indicates that the summoned creature is returned

to its home plane.

Each attempt affects only a single creature, chosen by the

cleric, that is within 60 feet and visible to the cleric. A cleric

cant dismiss a summoned creature whose Hit Dice exceed

his caster level + his Cha modi er.

A  cleric  who  selects  this  planar  substitution  bene t

reduces his cleric level by three for the purpose of turning

undead. For example, a 4th-level cleric with the planar dis-

missal ability turns undead as a 1st-level cleric.

Planar Domain: A 7th-level cleric whose alignment is

other  than  neutral  can  give  up  the  two  domains  that  he

gained as a 1st-level cleric in exchange for a planar domain

that matches his alignment (see Table 23: Planar Domains).

The  cleric  need  not  worship  a  deity  listed  as  one  of  the

typical deities for the domain. A neutral cleric cant select a

planar domain.

A cleric of Yondalla

sends a devil back

to the Nine Hells

At the end of the performance, the minor breach comes

into  existence  with  an  onset  time  of  1d4  rounds,  as  indi-

cated by the precipitate breach spell description. If the bard

has further uses of his bardic music ability for the day, he

may attempt to exacerbate the breach further, as described

in the spell description.

This bene t replaces the song of freedom bardic music abil-

ity gained by a standard bard at 12th level.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the clerics

planar substitution levels.

Planar Dismissal (Su): By selecting

this  planar  substitution  bene t  at  4th

level,  a  cleric  trades  away  some  of  his

power over undead creatures to gain the

ability to dismiss a summoned extra-

planar creature (such as a  endish

wolf brought by a summon mon-

ster II spell) by channeling the

power of his faith through his

holy (or unholy) symbol.

To  attempt  this,  the  cleric

spends a turn/rebuke attempt

and  makes  a  level  check  (1d20

+  cleric  level)  against  a  DC  of

11 + the caster level of the sum-

moner.  If  the  summoning  crea-

ture doesnt have a caster level, use

its Hit Dice instead. The cleric gets

a +2 bonus on this check if the sum-

moned  creatures  alignment  has  at

least one component opposed to his

own (for instance, a lawful good cleric

30

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   30

5/20/04, 12:47:03 PM

The  cleric  immediately  loses  the  granted  powers  of

his exchanged domains. Skills that were treated as class

skills  due  to  a  granted  power  are  treated  as  cross-class

skills  for  this  and  all  future  cleric  class  levels  (though

the  cleric  doesnt  lose  any  skill  ranks  for  skill  points

already  spent  from  previous  levels).  He  can  no  longer

fill  domain  spell  slots  with  domain  spells  from  the

exchanged domains.

In return, the cleric gains a planar domain that matches

his  alignment,  gains  its  granted  power,  and  from  now  on

may  ll his domain spell slots with the spells appropriate to

that domain. See Chapter 5: Spells for more information on

planar domains.

Planar  Banishment  (Su):  By  selecting  this  planar

substitution  bene t  at  11th  level,  a  cleric  trades  away  his

ability to spontaneously cast cure or in ict spells of 6th level

or higher in order to gain the ability to banish extraplanar

creatures from his home plane. The cleric can lose any

prepared  spell  of  6th  level  or  higher  that  is  not  a  domain

spell in order to cast banishment. (If the cleric loses a spell of

7th level or higher, calculate the save DC as if the banishment

spell had been heightened to that level.)

DRUID

The forces of nature, both subtle and grand, are manifes-

tations of a deeper reality, where cosmic spheres revolve

about  each  other  in  an  awesome  celestial  dance.  That

dance  generates  the  energy  behind  the  fury  of  a  storm,

the brilliant sun, and even the vitality of life. The druid

who understands the ecological connections between the

seen  and  unseen  is  more  capable,  more  knowledgeable,

and more tuned into the events that move in all realms

of existence.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To take a druid planar substitution level, a character must be

about to take his 4th, 9th, or 13th level of druid.

Class Skills

Druid planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard druid class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4+ Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the druids planar sub-

stitution levels.

Resist Extraplanar Might (Ex): A 4th-level druid who

selects this planar substitution bene t gains a +2 bonus on

saving throws against the spell-like abilities of outsiders.

This bene t replaces the resist natures lure class feature

gained by a standard druid at 4th level.

Planar  Tolerance  (Ex):  A  planar  druid  of  9th  level  or

higher  becomes  attuned  to  the  nature  of  the  planes  she

visits  and  gains  immunity  to  their  natural  planar  effects.

Any  effect  that  would  be  negated  by  the  planar  tolerance

spell (see page 103) is negated by this druid ability. Unlike

the spell, this ability affects only the druid herself.

This bene t replaces the immunity to venom class feature

gained by a standard druid at 9th level.

Counter  Summoning  (Su):  Some  druids  who  walk

the  planes  come  to  believe  that  excessive  summoning  of

extraplanar  creatures  constitutes  an  abuse  of  the  planes

themselves, and they learn to deal with this problem at the

source. A planar druid of 13th level or higher can ready a

standard action to counter a summon monster spell or any

spell-like ability that summons an extraplanar creature.

This ability functions exactly as a counterspell using dispel

magic, except that the druid need not cast a spell to make the

attempt. The druid must make a caster level check against a

DC of 11 + the opponents caster level (if the opponent does

not have a caster level for its summoning ability, use its Hit

Dice instead). Success indicates that the spell or spell-like

ability is countered.

FIGHTER

Planar travelers often have some  ghting skill. Those devot-

ing a substantial amount of time and effort to the pursuit of

planar puissance gain additional powers and tactics useful

against planar foes.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a  ghter planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take his 4th, 8th, or 12th level of  ghter.

Class Skills

Fighter planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard  ghter class plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the  ghters planar sub-

stitution levels.

Planar Study (Ex): At 4th level, a planar  ghter learns

the secrets of combating foes encountered on the planes.

He gains a +2 bonus on all weapon damage rolls against

elementals, outsiders, and creatures that would have the

extraplanar subtype while on the Material Plane (such as a

 endish dire wolf).

This bene t replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard

 ghter at 4th level.

Align  Puissance  (Su):  Once  per  day,  for  a  number  of

rounds equal to his  ghter class level, a planar  ghter of 8th

level or higher can use a standard action to align himself so

that any weapon he wields is aligned good, evil, lawful, or

chaotic, as he chooses. A weapon that is aligned can over-

come  the  damage  reduction  of  certain  creatures,  usually

outsiders of the opposite alignment.

This ability has no effect on a weapon that already has

an  alignment,  such  as  a  holy  sword.  It  affects  all  other

weapons  wielded  by  the  fighter,  but  not  his  unarmed

Table 27: Monk Planar Substitution Levels

strikes or natural weapons. The ability comes from the

fighter, not the weapon, so if he subsequently gives away

or  loses  the  weapon,  it  does  not  remain  aligned.  Like-

wise, while the fighter is under the effect of this ability,

any weapon he picks up acts as if aligned in the manner

he activated.

This bene t replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard

 ghter at 8th level.

Aura of Stability (Su): As a standard action, a planar

 ghter of 12th level or higher can activate a dimensional

anchor  effect  (see  page  221  of  the  Players  Handbook)  on

himself with a duration of a number of rounds equal to his

class level. In addition, anyone with whom he is grappling

is likewise affected by the dimensional anchor ability while

they are grappling. Spell resistance applies, and the caster

level of the ability equals the  ghters class level.

This bene t replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard

 ghter at 12th level.

MONK

Monks who travel the planes do so for a wide variety of

reasons, ranging from seeking to restore an ancient artifact

to their temple to a much more general quest for enlighten-

ment.  The  magni cent  diversity  of  the  planes  lead  many

monks  to  adventure,  and  few  return  to  quiet  monastic

study without having spent at least some time exploring.

Living out a classic paradox, most  nd both more and less

than they anticipate.

Requirements

To take a monk planar substitution level, a character must be

about to take her 5th, 13th, or 16th level of monk.

Resistant Body (Ex): At 5th level, a planar

monk  successfully  hardens  her  body  against

one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity,  re,

or sonic), gaining resistance 5.

This bene t replaces the purity of body

class feature gained by a standard monk

at 5th level.

Axiomatic Soul (Ex): At 13th

level, a planar monk gains spell

resistance equal to her class level

+15.  This  spell  resistance  applies

only  to  effects  generated  by  cha-

otic outsiders.

This  bene t  replaces  the  dia-

mond soul class feature gained by

a standard monk at 13th level.

Ki  Strike  (Su):  At  16th  level,  a

planar monks unarmed attacks are

treated as cold iron weapons for the

purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

This bene t replaces the ki strike

(adamantine)  class  feature  gained

by a standard monk at 16th level.

PALADIN

Dedicated  to  upholding  law,

promoting  good,  and  serving  as

an example for others in the name

of their god, paladins seem to live

their lives as an effort to carry a tiny

bit of their deitys plane wherever they go.

If they have done their jobs well, spending time on the

plane in question will be like coming home, and bring-

ing that same sense of beneficial transformation to other

planes will be a worthwhile challenge for a truly worthy

champion. Better than members of any other class, pala-

dins  can  be  agents  who  embody  the  tenets  of  an  entire

plane of existence.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To take a paladin planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take her 4th, 6th, or 10th level of paladin.

Class Skills

Paladin planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard paladin class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the paladins planar sub-

stitution levels.

Smite Evil Outsider (Su): A planar paladin of 4th

level or higher can attempt to smite an evil outsider

with one normal melee attack. She adds her Cha-

risma bonus (if any) to the damage dealt by the

attack.  In  addition,  the  attack  is  treated  as

good-aligned for the purpose of overcom-

ing  damage  reduction.  If  the  paladin

accidentally smites a creature that is not

an evil outsider, the smite has no effect,

but the ability is still used up. A paladin

may use this ability a number of times

per day equal to 1 + her Cha modi er

(minimum 1).

If the paladin is on a plane that

is  both  good-aligned  and  lawful-

aligned (such as the Seven Mount-

ing  Heavens  of  Celestia),  she  also

adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to

the attack roll.

A planar paladin can use smite

evil  and  smite  evil  outsider  on

the  same  attack,  and  the  bonuses

stack.

This  bene t  replaces  the  ability  to

turn undead gained by a standard pala-

din at 4th level.

Celestial  Mount:  A  paladin  who

chooses  this  planar  substitution  ben-

e t  at  6th  level  may  apply  the  celestial

template (see page 31 of the Monster Manual)

A monk with resistance to  re

to her special mount.

The  mount  gains  darkvision  out  to  60  feet,

spell resistance equal to its Hit Dice + 5 (maximum 25), and

resistance to acid, cold, and electricity 5 (or resistance 10 if

it has 8 or more Hit Dice). If the mount has 4 or more Hit

Dice, it also gains damage reduction (5/magic for Hit Dice

4 to 11, or 10/magic for Hit Dice 12 or more), and its natural

weapons  are  treated  as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of

overcoming  damage  reduction.  It  also  gains  a  smite  evil

attack, allowing it to deal extra damage once per day equal

to its Hit Dice (maximum +20) with a single melee attack

against an evil foe.

This bene t replaces the remove disease class feature gained

by a standard paladin at 6th level. From now on, whenever

the paladin gains a standard paladin level that allows her to

use remove disease more frequently, she gains the indicated

number of uses per week minus 1 (1/week at 9th level, 2/

week at 12th level, and so on).

Alignment Purity (Ex): A 10th-level paladin who chooses

this  planar  substitution  bene t  can  ignore  the  penalty  to

Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and/or Charisma-based checks that

she would normally take when on a plane that is chaotic- or

evil-aligned. Her spirit and determination are so pure that

she effectively brings her own planar alignment traits wher-

ever she goes.

5/20/04, 12:47:15 PM

This ability only affects the paladin, not any other allies

or foes in her vicinity.

This bene t replaces the ability to smite evil three times

per day gained by a standard paladin at 10th level. From now

on, whenever the paladin gains a standard paladin level that

allows her to smite evil more frequently, she gains the indi-

cated number of uses per day minus 1 (3/day at 15th level,

4/day at 20th level, and so on).

RANGER

Rangers from the Material Plane stalk and protect forests

and hills, and the same is true for rangers who live on other

planes. Of course, they may be crystal forests and hills of

 ame,  but  the  deep  personal  connection  and  dedication

remain exactly the same.

Whatever the nature of a planar rangers chosen home,

he is as comfortable there as a noble is upon his throne.

He can sense trouble on the wind, glean details of recent

events  from  a  single  footprint,  and  know  the  habits  of

the local flora and fauna the way a mother bear knows

her cubs.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To take a ranger planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take her 4th, 8th, or 13th level of ranger.

Class Skills

Ranger planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard ranger class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the rangers planar sub-

stitution levels.

Planar Animal Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a planar

ranger can select a celestial or  endish animal as his animal

companion. Doing this reduces the rangers effective druid

level by one.

For example, a 4th-level planar ranger (with an effective

druid level of 1st) can select an animal from the normal

list of potential companions. When he reaches 8th level,

that companion would gain the bonus Hit Dice and other

special abilities granted to the animal companion of a 3rd-

level druid. He cant select a celestial leopard or  endish

wolverine  until  he  reaches  10th  level  (effective  druid

level 4th).

Unlike  a  typical  animal  companion,  the  planar  animal

companion  is  a  magical  beast.  However,  the  ranger  (and

only the ranger) can still affect it with his spells as if it were

an animal.

To  gain  a  celestial  companion,  a  ranger  must  have

a  nonevil  alignment.  To  gain  a  fiendish  companion,  a

ranger must have a nongood alignment. If the rangers

alignment  changes  to  one  that  is  ineligible  for  the

companion,  the  companion  either  turns  on  the  ranger

or  leaves  at  its  earliest  convenience,  depending  on  its

natural tendencies.

Portal  Intuition  (Ex):  At  8th  level,  a  planar  ranger

becomes  an  expert  at  tracking  quarry  across  planes  and

through  various  portals  and  breaches.  When  examining

a  portal,  the  ranger  may  attempt  to  determine  to  which

plane  the  portal  leads.  To  do  this,  he  must  succeed  on

both a DC 20 Survival check and a DC 20 Knowledge (the

planes) check.

The ranger can also use this ability to determine whether

or not a planar breach occurred within 20 feet of a particular

spot within the last 24 hours. To do this, he must succeed

on a DC 20 Search check. If the ranger determines that a

breach did occur in the area, he may then use this ability to

ascertain where it led.

This bene t replaces the swift tracker class feature gained

by a standard ranger at 8th level.

Planar Tracking (Sp): Once per day, a ranger who chooses

this  substitution  bene t  can  use  plane  shift  as  a  spell-like

ability (with a caster level equal to his class level) in order

to follow his quarry. He must be tracking a favored enemy,

and he must be at the spot where the creature traveled from

one plane to another.

Unlike with the plane shift spell, the ranger has no chance

of deviation from the intended destination. He and any-

one  he  brings  with  him  arrives  in  the  exact  spot  that

his quarry did. Spells that prevent planar travel (such as

dimensional lock) affect this ability as they would any cast-

ing of plane shift.

The  ranger  does  not  automatically  pick  up  his  quarrys

trail  when  he  arrives  on  the  new  plane.  He  must  use  his

Track feat to  nd the creatures tracks and pick up the hunt.

But  he  has  the  advantage  of  knowing  that  his  target  de -

nitely passed that way.

This bene t replaces the camou age class feature gained

by a standard ranger at 13th level.

ROGUE

The  only  thing  more  varied  and  unpredictable  than  a

rogues  intentions  are  the  in nite  planes  of  reality.  No

matter what a rogue wants to do, no matter what treasure

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   34

5/20/04, 12:47:18 PM

or information or experience she seeks, it can be found

somewhere on the planes.

A rogue who spends her life exploring the twisting reali-

ties and the gossamer walls that separate them comes away

with a unique insight into the way the cosmos functions.

She may not have a scholars ability to understand it, nor a

poets skill to describe it, but the rogue has something emi-

nently more usefulshe knows the loopholes built into

the laws of reality and how to bend them ever so slightly to

her advantage.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To take a rogue planar substitution level, a character must be

about to take her 6th, 10th, or 16th level of rogue.

Class Skills

Rogue planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard rogue class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the rogues planar sub-

stitution levels.

Breach  Sense  (Ex):  A  6th-level  planar  rogue  gains  an

intuitive  sense  that  alerts  her  of  the  imminent  opening

of a nearby conduit between the planes. She automatically

detects  the  activation  of  any  portal  or  the  opening  of  any

planar  breach  within  30  feet  of  her,  as  well  as  any  spell

or  effect  that  crosses  over  or  through  the  planes  (such  as

summon monster, teleport, or plane shift) used within 30 feet

of her. The rogue may immediately attempt a DC 25 Spot

check to pinpoint the exact location of the portal, breach,

or effect, as long as she has line of sight to it.

For example, a planar rogue would detect a demon tele-

porting to a spot within 30 feet of her, and with a DC 25

Spot check could even pinpoint the precise location where

the demon appeared (though she would lose this precision

as soon as the demon moved).

This bene t replaces the improvement to the trap sense

class  feature  gained  by  a  standard

rogue  at  6th  level.  From  now  on,

whenever the rogue gains a standard

rogue level that grants an improvement to her trap sense,

she gains the indicated bonus minus 1 (trap sense +2 at 9th

level, trap sense +3 at 12th level, and so on).

Slip the Bonds (Su): A rogue who chooses this substitu-

tion  bene t  at  10th  level  knows  how  to  slip  momentarily

into the periphery of the plane she is on. Once per day as a

free action, she can turn ethereal for a single round.

This bene t replaces the special ability gained by a stan-

dard rogue at 10th level.

Blink (Sp): By 16th level, a planar rogues understand-

ing of how to skirt the periphery of a plane is such that she

can use a blink effect on herself once per day. This effect

lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level

(rounded down).

This bene t replaces the special ability gained by a stan-

dard rogue at 16th level.

SORCERER

Though many claim a sorcerers power derives from draconic

heritage, a few sorcerers believe that their arcane prowess

comes from an even purer sourcethe planes themselves.

It isnt uncommon to see sorcerers traveling the multiverse

in search of support for this belief.

Unlike  other  spellcasters,  the  sorcerer  has  a  limited

ability  to  customize  his  talents  for  planar  adventuring.

With  a  small  list  of  spells  known,  the  sorcerer  who

wishes to adapt to life on the planes must choose his tools

wisely.  Even  so,  the  wide  variety  of  challenges  awaiting

the  planar  sorcerer  demands  a  slightly  more  adaptable

approach to spellcasting.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a sorcerer planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take her 5th, 9th, or 13th level of sorcerer.

Class Skills

Sorcerer planar substitution levels have the class skills of the

standard sorcerer class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  features  of  the  sorcerers  planar

substitution levels.

Force-Charged Energy (Su): At 5th level, a planar sor-

cerer can lace his spells with pure force, the better to affect

the  various  energy-resistant  elementals  and  outsiders  he

faces.  At  the  sorcerers  option,  half  of  the  energy  damage

dealt by a spell he casts is replaced by force damage. This

effect can be applied to any spell that deals acid, cold, elec-

tricity,  re, or sonic damage.

The maximum spell level to which a planar sorcerer can

apply this effect is one lower than the highest level of sor-

cerer spell that he can cast. For instance, a 5th-level planar

sorcerer can apply this effect to 0-level and 1st-level sorcerer

spells,  while  an  18th-level  planar  sorcerer  can  apply  it  to

spells of up to 8th level.

This bene t replaces the ability to learn a new 2nd-level

spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 5th level. From now

on, the sorcerers number of 2nd-level spells known at any

class level is one less than the value shown on Table 317,

page 54 of the Players Handbook.

Extraplanar  Spell  Penetration  (Ex):  A  9th-level

planar  sorcerer  can  imbue  his  spells  with  the  ability  to

penetrate  the  spell  resistance  of  extraplanar  creatures

more readily. Three times per day, for 1 round each time,

the sorcerer can add his Charisma bonus to all his caster

level checks made to overcome the spell resistance of extra-

planar creatures.

This bene t replaces the ability to learn a new 4th-level

spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 9th level. From now

on, the sorcerers number of 4th-level spells known at any

class level is one less than the value shown on Table 317,

page 54 of the Players Handbook.

Spontaneous  Planar  Summoning  (Su):  A  13th-level

planar  sorcerer  learns  to  summon  extraplanar  creatures

spontaneously.  When  he  chooses  this  planar  substitution

bene t,  a  sorcerer  selects  one  of  the  following  categories:

elementals (creatures of the elemental type), celestial crea-

tures  (creatures  with  the  celestial  template),  or   endish

creatures (creatures with the  endish template). He can use

any spell slot to spontaneously cast a summon monster spell

of the same level, but he can use that spell to summon only

creatures of the selected category.

For example, a 13th-level sorcerer who chose elementals

could use one of his 6th-level spell slots to cast summon mon-

ster VI. He could use that spell to summon a single Large

elemental,  or  1d3  Medium  elementals  (from  the  5th-level

summoning  list).  He  could  not  use  the  spell  to  summon

creatures that werent elementals.

This bene t replaces the ability to learn a new 6th-level

spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 13th level. From now

on, the sorcerers number of 6th-level spells known at any

class level is one less than the value shown on Table 317,

page 54 of the Players Handbook.

WIZARD

While other spellcasters may have a vested interest in a par-

ticular  planar  viewpoint,  the  wizard  prefers  a  more  open

policy toward the planes. To a wizard, the planes represent

knowledge  and  power,  and  the  wizard  who  can  learn  the

secrets of the planes without regard to those planes align-

ments or other traits is a true master of magic.

More  so  than  many  other  classes,  the  wizard  already

has the ability to customize her abilities with an eye to the

planes, simply through the spells she learns and prepares

each day. If a wizard learns plane shift and planar tolerance,

then  the  caster  is  self-customized  to  adventure  on  the

planes. But the planar wizard goes a step beyond this adap-

tation,  learning  to  channel  the  pure  power  of  the  planes

themselves in her spells.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements

To take a wizard planar substitution level, a character must

be about to take her 6th, 10th, or 14th level of wizard.

Class Skills

Wizard planar substitution levels have the class skills of

the standard wizard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are features of the wizards planar sub-

stitution levels.

Unimpeded Magic (Su): A 6th-level planar wizard learns

to overcome planar impediments to her spellcasting. When

casting  a  wizard  spell  that  would  normally  be  impeded

because of a planes magic traits (such as a  re spell on the

Elemental  Plane  of  Water),  the  spell  functions  normally

without need for a Spellcraft check.

This bene t replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a

standard wizard at 6th level. From now on, the wizard can

prepare  one  less  3rd-level  wizard  spell  than  indicated  on

Table 318, page 55 of the Players Handbook.

Planar  Spellcasting  (Su):  A  10th-level  planar  wizard

learns to channel planar energy through her spells. Upon

gaining this ability, the wizard chooses to make her spells

anarchic (chaotic), axiomatic (lawful), celestial (good), or

 endish  (evil).  Her  spells  gain  the  indicated  alignment

descriptor. The wizard can choose any of the four options,

regardless of her own alignment. Against creatures of the

opposed alignment, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level

checks made to overcome spell resistance, and her spell save

DCs  are  increased  by  1.  If  she  casts  a  spell  that  normally

has the same alignment descriptor that she would apply, or

whenever she casts a spell on a plane with an alignment trait

that matches the alignment she chose, the bonuses increase

to  +2.  These  effects  apply  only  to  the  characters  wizard

spells;  any  spellcasting  ability  gained  from  another  class

functions normally.

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   36

5/20/04, 12:47:23 PM

For  example,  the  spells  of  a  wizard  choosing  to  cast

fiendish  spells  gain  the  evil  descriptor.  She  gains  a  +1

bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resis-

tance of good-aligned creatures, and good-aligned crea-

tures attempting to save against her spells do so against

a  DC  that  is  1  higher  than  normal.  If  she  casts  a  spell

that  would  normally  be  an  evil  spell  (such  as

contagion), or if she casts any spell on an evil-

aligned plane (such as the Abyss or the Nine

Hells),  these  values  would  increase  by  2

instead of by 1.

This  bene t  replaces  the  bonus  feat

gained  by  a  standard  wizard  at  10th

level, as well as the two spells a standard

10th-level wizard learns for free.

Enhanced  Magic  (Su):  A  14th-

level planar wizard learns how to

channel the essence of a speci c

planes  enhanced  magic  trait

through her spells. Upon gain-

ing this ability, the wizard must

choose  a  speci c  plane  that  she

has  visited  (other  than  the  Mate-

rial  Plane).  Three  times  per  day,

the  wizard  may  spend  a  standard

action  to  channel  that  planes  magical  essence.  The  next

spell  she  casts  (if  cast  within  1  minute)  is  enhanced  as  if

she were casting it on that plane, applying any magic traits

normal  to  that  plane.  This  ability  doesnt  apply  any  other

planar magic traits to the wizards spells, such as wild magic

or impeded magic.

For example, a planar wizard who chose to channel the

essence of the Elemental Plane of Fire would maximize and

enlarge the next spell she cast after activating this ability

(as if she had applied the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell

meta magic feats, but without adjusting the spell slot used),

as long as that spell has the  re descriptor.

This bene t replaces the 7th-level spell slot gained by a

standard wizard at 14th level. From now on, the wizard can

prepare  one  less  7th-level  wizard  spell  than  indicated  on

Table 318, page 55 of the Players Handbook.

FEATS

The feats described in this chapter include many that can

be  learned  only  by  direct  exposure  to  planar  creatures,

locations, or knowledge from planes other than the Mate-

rial Plane.

HERITAGE FEATS

A heritage feat signi es a speci c ancestry of the character

(in the case of the feats in this book, a speci c extraplanar

ancestry). The player and DM are encouraged to come up

with  a  background  story  explaining  the  characters  heri-

tage,  though  the  exact  source  of  this  ancestral  link  isnt

crucial to the feats operation (and may remain a mystery

to the character).

A  character  may  select  a  heritage

feat at any level. Choosing a heritage

feat  after  1st  level  signi es  that  the

ancestral power of the character is

only now manifesting itself.

Once  a  character  selects  a  heri-

tage  feat,  he  cannot  select  another

heritage  feat  unless  it  lists  his   rst

heritage  feat  as  a  prerequisite.  For

instance,  a  character  who  selects  Fire

Heritage cant also take Shadow Heritage,

but he could select additional heritage feats

that  have  Fire  Heritage  as  a  prerequisite

(such as Improved Elemental Heritage).

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS

The feats in this section follow the normal format

for feat descriptions.

Acheron Flurry [General]

You  master  the  secret  technique  developed  by  Acheron-

native special forces of limiting a foes options in hand-to-

hand combat.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Wis 15, Improved Unarmed Strike,

Knowledge (the planes) 4 ranks.

Bene  t: During your turn, designate an opponent within

reach to whom you have dealt damage during this encounter

using an unarmed strike.

You  can  spend  a  standard  action  to  confound  and  dis-

tract your chosen foe with a constant  ood of distracting

mock attacks. While doing this leaves you open to attacks

(applying a 2 penalty to your Armor Class), your foe may

take only a single standard action or move action on his

next turn.

If you move away (or are otherwise no longer conscious

and adjacent to your foe) before your chosen foes next turn,

he may act normally.

Air Heritage [Heritage]

You are descended from creatures native to the Elemental

Plane of Air. You share some of your ancestors natural agil-

ity and grace.

Benefit:  Your  fly  speed  increases  by  30  feet  (up  to  a

maximum  increase  equal  to  your  normal  fly  speed).  If

you dont have a fly speed as a racial ability, this benefit

has no effect.

Improved Elemental Heritage [Heritage]

You have manifested an even stronger tie

to your elemental ancestor, resulting in a

minor resistance to elemental effects.

Prerequisite:  Air  Heritage,

Earth  Heritage,  Fire  Heritage,  or

Water Heritage.

Bene  t: You gain resistance 5

to a speci c type of energy, based

on your elemental heritage: acid

(earth), cold (water), electricity (air),

or  re ( re).

You  also  gain  a  +2  bonus  on

saving throws against spells with

the  descriptor  that  matches  your

chosen  elemental  heritage  (air,

earth,  re, or water).

Improved Outer Planar Heritage

[Heritage]

Your  ancestral  tie  to  the  Outer  Planes

manifests as an ability to deal damage with

your  natural  attacks  as  if  they  matched

the alignment of your ancestors.

Prerequisite: Anarchic Heritage, Axi-

omatic  Heritage,  Celestial  Heritage,  or

Fiendish Heritage.

Bene  t: Your unarmed attacks and

natural weapons (but not the weapons

you  wield)  are  treated  as  having  an

alignment  for  the  purpose  of  over-

coming  damage  reduction.  The  align-

ment  depends  on  the  heritage  feat  you

used to qualify for this feat: chaotic (Anar-

chic Heritage), evil (Fiendish Heritage), good

(Celestial Heritage), or lawful (Axiomatic Heritage).

Natural Heavyweight [Heritage]

You  are  descended  from  creatures  native  to  a  plane  of

heavy  gravity.  On  planes  with  normal  gravity,  you  feel

light and buoyant.

Benefit: Your carrying capacity is doubled. Double the

values given in Table 91, page 162 of the Players Hand-

book, to determine what your light, medium, and heavy

loads are.

On  a  plane  with  normal  gravity,  you  gain  a  +2  circum-

stance bonus on Climb and Jump checks, but you also take

a 2 penalty on Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks.

On a plane with light gravity, these bonuses and penalties

are doubled (and replace the normal bonuses and penalties

on these skill checks).

Attacking with the

Neraph Throw feat

Prerequisites: Wis 15, Knowledge (the planes) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  You  can  charge  in  such  a  way  as  to

fool your foe into believing that you are not

moving closer, or moving closer too slowly

to  attack  effectively.  A  victim  of  your

Neraph  Charge  attack  may  not  apply  its

Dexterity  bonus  to  its  Armor  Class.  All

conditions  that  pertain  when  a  foe

cannot  apply  his  Dexterity  bonus

to  Armor  Class  also  pertain  to  the

Neraph  Charge  attack,  if  any  (for

instance, a sneak attack also could

be  made  with  this  attack  if  you  can

make such an attack).

Once  you  have  used  a  Neraph

Charge  attack  against  an  enemy

(regardless  of  the  attacks  suc-

cess),  any  later  attempts  to  use

Neraph Charge against that enemy in

the same encounter automatically fail.

Once  a  foe  sees  the  attack  in  action

against  himself,  the  foe  can  discern  it

for what it is for the duration of

that combat.

Special:  Neraph  Charge  has  no

effect against foes who cant see you.

Neraph Throw [General]

You master the Limbo-native neraph martial

art  of  motion  camouflage  for  your  thrown

weapons.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Knowledge (the planes)

5 ranks.

Bene  t: You can throw a weapon in such a way

as to fool your foe into believing that the thrown

weapon is not moving closer, or moving closer too slowly

to be an effective attack. A victim of your Neraph Throw

attack  may  not  apply  its  Dexterity  bonus  to  its  Armor

Class. All conditions that pertain when a foe cannot apply

his  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class  also  pertain  to  the

Neraph Throw attack, if any (for instance, a sneak attack

also could be made with this attack if you can make such

an attack).

Once  you  have  used  a  Neraph  Throw  attack  against  an

enemy (regardless of the attacks success), any later attempts

to  use  Neraph  Throw  against  that  enemy  in  the  same

encounter automatically fail. Once a foe sees the attack in

action against himself, the foe can discern it for what it is for

the duration of that combat.

Special:  Neraph  Throw  has  no  effect  against  foes  who

cant see you.

Neraph Charge [General]

Nonverbal Spell [General]

You master the Limbo-native neraph martial art of motion

camou age when you charge a foe.

You  can  cast  spells  that  have  verbal  components  without

actually verbalizing the words.

40

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   40

5/20/04, 12:47:36 PM

Bene  t: You can cast spells with verbal components with-

out needing to utter the actual verbal components. You still

make noise when casting such a spell (which may be any-

thing from recognizable speech to elaborate song to simple

growls),  but  the  noise  is  unrecognizable  as  a  verbal  spell

component.  (A  silence  spell  still  would  prevent  you  from

completing  the  spell,  for  example.)  Spells  without  verbal

components are not affected.

This feat is most bene cial to races incapable of speech

in the traditional sense, but still capable of communication.

However, it also can prove helpful to characters wishing to

disguise the verbal components of their spells.

Personal Touchstone [General]

You  draw  more  power  from  one  of  the  planar  touchstone

locations to which you have forged a link.

Prerequisites:  Planar  Touchstone,  a  portable  object  of

at least 250 gp value native to a chosen planar touchstone

plane, Knowledge (the planes) 8 ranks.

Benefit: Choose any planar touchstone for which you

have previously fulfilled the higher-order recharge condi-

tion (see page 154); this is now your personal touch stone.

Each  time  you  visit  your  touchstone  from  now  on,  you

gain double the number of uses of the higher-order abil-

ity when you fulfill the recharge condition. You may con-

tinue to visit other touchstone sites and gain the standard

number of higher-order uses with each visit

to those sites (and you lose the higher-order

uses left unused at your personal site, unless

you  have  taken  Planar  Touchstone  enough

times to allow you to keep the higher-order

uses of more than one planar touch stone

simultaneously).

Special:  You  can  gain  this  feat

multiple  times.  Its  effects  do  not

stack.  Each  time  you  take  this

feat, it applies to a new planar

touchstone.

Planar Familiar [General]

When you are ready and able

to acquire a new familiar, you

may  choose  one  of  several

nonstandard familiars.

Prerequisite:  Ability  to

ac quire a new familiar, compat-

ible  alignment,  suf cient  arcane

spellcaster level, Knowledge (the planes)

5 ranks.

Bene  t:  When  choosing  a  familiar,  you

may  add  the  following  creatures  to  your

list of options. You may choose a familiar

with  an  alignment  up  to  one  step  away

from yours on each of the alignment axes

(lawfulchaotic and goodevil).

The improved familiar is magically linked to its master

in the same way as a normal familiar. The familiar uses the

basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the

Monster Manual or this book, except as noted below.

Hit Dice: For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the

masters  character  level  or  the  familiars  normal  Hit  Dice

total, whichever is higher.

Hit Points: Use one-half the masters total

or  the  familiars  normal  total,  whichever  is

higher.

Attacks: Use the masters base attack bonus

or the familiars, whichever is better.

Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use the

masters base save bonus (as calculated from his

character level) or the familiars, whichever

is better.

Familiar Special Abilities: Use the

second  table  in  the  Familiars  side-

bar, page 53 of the Players Handbook,

to  determine  additional  abilities,  just

as you would for a normal familiar.

With  the  exception  of  anarchic,

axiomatic,  celestial,  and   end-

ish  animals,  planar  familiars  do

not grant their masters any of the

bene ts that appear on the  rst

table in that sidebar.

Planar Touchstone [General]

Forge  a  link  between  you  and

power-rich  planar  locations,

referred to as planar touchstones

(see Planar Touchstones, page 153).

Prerequisite:  Portable  object  of  at

least  250  gp  value  native  to  any  desig-

nated  planar  touchstone  site,  Knowledge

(the planes) 8 ranks.

Benefit: Choose any site designated as a planar touch-

stone for which you also possess an object native to that

location,  as  noted  in  this  feats  prerequisite.  When  this

feat  is  first  taken,  forging  a  link  between  yourself  and

a  chosen  planar  touchstone  takes  24  hours  of  uninter-

rupted  concentration.  To  forge  a  link,  you  must  spend

10 experience points and expend the object described in

this feats prerequisite.

Once the link is forged, you gain the base ability described

for that touchstone. If you physically visit the planar loca-

tion  once  youve  forged  a  link,  you  also  gain  a  higher-

order ability with a limited number of uses, as described

for that planar touchstone. You may repeatedly visit the

planar touchstone, each time recharging your usages of

the higher-order ability. Usages of a higher-order ability

do not stack, so visiting your planar touchstone prior to

using up any of your higher-order usages confers no addi-

tional benefit.

Once  youve  established  a  link  with  one  planar  touch-

stone site by taking this feat, you may also freely visit other

planar touchstones. When you do so and ful ll the higher-

order abilitys recharge condition for the alternate site, you

immediately gain the base ability of the new planar touch-

stone site and lose the base ability of the previous site. You

also lose any remaining uses of the higher-order ability of

your previously selected site (if any), and instead gain the

speci ed  number  of  higher-order  ability  uses  appropriate

to the new site.

In this way, you can unplug from one site and plug in

to a new planar touchstone site as often as you desire. Thus,

after expending the raw materials and experience points for

making your  rst connection, making subsequent connec-

tions with different sites is as easy as ful lling the higher-

order recharge condition.

Special:  You  can  take  this  feat  more  than  once.  Each

time, you gain the base ability to retain one more planar

touchstone location in addition to your previous ability.

You also gain the capacity to retain uses of one more planar

touchstones  higher-order  ability.  Thus,  you  could  retain

the base abilities for both the Breaching Obelisk and Echo-

lost (planar touchstone locations described in Chapter 7), as

well as both sites higher-order uses, simultaneously. If you

then visit a third planar touchstone and ful ll its recharge

condition, unless you have taken this feat three times, you

must  choose  which  of  your  two  previous  touchstone  site

abilities  to  lose  when  you  gain  the  abilities  of  the  third

touchstone site.

Shadow Heritage [Heritage]

You  are  descended  from  creatures  native  to  the  Plane  of

Shadow. You share some of your ancestors natural stealth,

but only in areas of dim or no illumination.

Benefits:  You  gain  a  +3  bonus  on  Hide  and  Move

Silently checks when in an area of darkness or shadowy

illumination.

42

Stalwart Planar Ally [General]

The  allies  you  summon  from  a  speci c  plane  are  tougher

than normal.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Planar Touch-

stone.

Bene  t:  When  you  use  a  spell  or  spell-like  ability  to

summon  a  creature  native  to  a  plane  that  has  a  planar

touchstone  site  to  which  you  have  forged  a  link  (see  the

Planar Touchstone feat), you imbue the creature with excep-

tional resilience. The creature gains a +4 bonus to its Armor

Class and on saving throws for the duration of the sum-

moning effect.

Furthermore,  the  duration  of  the  summoning  effect

that brought the creature is doubled. (Effects with a dura-

tion  of  concentration,  instantaneous,  or  permanent  are

not affected.)

For example, a cleric who has used his Planar Touchstone

feat to forge a link between himself and Empyrea Mere (a

touchstone  located  on  the  Seven  Mounting  Heavens  of

Celestia) grants these bonuses to any creature he summons

from Celestia, such as a hound archon.

Special: If a creatures indicated environment doesnt

specify  a  particular  home  plane,  but  rather  a  group  of

related  planes  (such  as  any  good-aligned  plane),  you

may  choose  to  summon  a  creature  of  that  kind  that  is

native  to  your  chosen  plane  and  thus  apply  the  feats

effect  normally.  However,  no  component  of  the  align-

ment of the creature to be summoned may be opposed

to any alignment traits of your chosen plane for the feat

to work.

For  instance,  the  cleric  in  the  example  above  could

apply  the  feats  effect  to  a  summoned  celestial  black

bear  (lawful  good)  or  a  celestial  bison  (neutral  good),

since  celestial  creatures  have  an  environment  of  any

good-aligned plane. He couldnt apply it to a summoned

celestial lion (chaotic good), since the lions alignment

has at least one component (chaotic) that is opposed to

the alignment traits of the Seven Mounting Heavens of

Celestia (lawful).

Water Heritage [Heritage]

You are descended from creatures native to the Elemental

Plane of Water. You share some of your ancestors natural

aquatic talents.

Bene  ts: You gain a swim speed of 20 feet, or your exist-

ing swim speed increases by 20 feet.

Also, you gain a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to

hold your breath.

Special:  A  creature  with  a  swim  speed  also  gains  a

+8 racial bonus on Swim checks made to perform some

special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard,  and  can  take  10  on  a

Swim check even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

hen your eyes are opened to the vistas of other-

planar strangeness, deities on their own turf,

and  mind-bending  philosophies,  its  hard  to

remain the same as you were before. Its a lot to

absorb. Many of those who live beyond the Material Plane

feel they have a wider view of the way things actually work.

To this end, various organizations, groups, and factions exist

that teach ways of coping with the mind-boggling immensity

of the multiverse. Some of these factions are fairly strati ed

and embedded in the politics of planar metropolises where

they are based. Others are more wide-ranging but loose.

Some  groups  are  so  enamored  of  their  own  particular

philosophies that they teach their members special kinds

of prestigious abilities. These philosophical teachings and

abilities can take a character in an entirely different direc-

tion from that which she originally followed.

Of course, only a fraction of those who join philosophi-

cal plane-inspired factions take a prestige class associated

with that group. Moreover, it is possible that a given faction

could offer more than a single prestige class.

THE ATHAR

The gods are liars, every single one of themliars and

frauds.  They  arent  deities.  Theyre  mortalsextremely

powerful  mortals,  to  be  sure,  but  nothing  more.  They

are given to petty emotions, they require sustenance

in the form of prayers and the belief of their followers,

and, when denied that, they die. Think about it: If the

deities  really  are  the  source  of  all  creation,  why  is  it

that many clerics can cast divine magic without devot-

ing themselves to any deity? There may indeed be an

omnipotent  entity  (or  collection  of  entities)  respon-

sible  for  making  and  tending  reality,  but  if  so,  that

power  must  be  completely  incomprehensible  to  the

minds of mere mortals. Members of the organization

known as the Athar refer to this theoretical true god

as the Great Unknown.

The Athar are sometimes called de ers or the

lost because their beliefs bring them into direct

philosophical (and occasionally physical) con ict

with just about every religion ever established

in the multiverse. They try to convince worship-

ers of various deities that they are being duped

by a cosmic con dence scam. The Athar rarely

take their accusations to the gods themselves.

After all, even if they are only mortals playing at

divinity,  they  are  extraordinarily  powerful  mortals

playing at divinity, and it is unwise to incur their

wrath unnecessarily.

43

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   43

5/20/04, 12:47:49 PM

The Athar spend a great deal of their time on the Astral

Plane. They have established a many-windowed observatory

from which visitors can view the bodies of dead and dying

gods. This sight  lls faction members with righteous glee,

since they consider it to be absolute, irrefutable proof that

their tenets are correct.

LORE OF THE ATHAR

Crystal Cask of the Great Unknown: The Athar tell a

tale among themselves concerning the Crystal Cask of the

Great Unknown. According to the Athar, this potent artifact

predates the deities as they are currently understood. The

Cask is said to contain the essence of divinitythe power

that,  once  shattered,  allowed  for  the  sudden  multiplicity

of pretender deities. The reason the Cask was shattered is

something all Athar (who believe in this tale) would dearly

love to learn. Some among the Athar believe that if all the

shards of the Crystal Cask can be gathered together, the loose

divine energy that currently powers deities great and small

will be contained anew. The pretender gods would be extin-

guished, and the Great Unknown would  nally be revealed

as the true architect of all that exists.

Seeds of Rebellion: A sect made up of once-loyal Athar

has broken away from the main organization. These rebel-

lious Athar are led by one of their number known only as

the  Lecturer.  This   gure  issued  a  proclamation  prior  to

the breakaway, which can be summarized as: The Enemy

knows all, sees all, penetrates all minds, and skews all poli-

cies. The Great Unknown is just one more scale. Let it fall

away, and embrace the true knowledge of reality.

The rebellious Athar live in secret, hunted by loyal Athar,

though few ever  nd them; the rebels are too schooled in

accepted Athar lore to be tripped up by philosophical tests.

These seeds of rebellion that exist within the Athar organi-

zation are the subject of cautionary tales told by Athar elites

to newcomers to the fold, related to illustrate the dangers

of moving too far from the central doctrine. What do the

rebellious Athar truly believe? It is a question that plagues

the mind of some.

PRESTIGE CLASS: DEFIANT

Even among the zealous Athar, a special few are regarded

with  awe  and  respect  for  their  dedication  to  the  cause.

These individuals, called de ants, once worshiped divine

beings for power but turned from the path. They now take

the teaching of the Athar to heart in a way that grants

them tremendous powers against those who claim to wield

divine might.

Clerics who are not af liated with a particular deity make

good de ants, as do druids, monks, rangers, and other indi-

viduals who live their lives in passionate dedication to a set

of beliefs. Paladins and clerics who lose faith in their patron

deities may become de ants, particularly if they have come

to question the validity of their former benefactors claim to

the title of god.

As NPCs, de ants work to shake the populaces belief in

the gods. They take any opportunity to prove that the dei-

ties that most people worship are actually only mortals with

access to incredible powers. They disrupt religious ceremo-

nies, engage in activities that draw divinity into question,

and harangue well-known servants of the gods.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a de ant, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Base Will Save Bonus: +5.

Skills: Knowledge (the planes) 4 ranks, Knowledge (reli-

gion) 8 ranks.

Special: De ants cannot worship any deity or have one

as a patron. Any character who has any connection to a god,

demigod, or other divine entity must renounce that connec-

tion before taking a level in this prestige class.

A  paladin  or  cleric  of  a  speci c  god  cannot  become  a

de ant until the character renounces all belief and faith in

the  deity,  becoming  an  ex-cleric  or  ex-paladin  and  losing

all  spells  and  class  features  except  for  armor  and  shield

pro ciencies and pro ciency with simple weapons. This

restriction does not affect clerics who worship a cause or a

nonpersoni ed source of divine magic.

Class Skills

The de ants class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Gather Information

(Cha),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Knowledge  (the  planes)  (Int),

Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis),

and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the de ant pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: De ants gain no pro-

 ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spell Resistance (Su): A de ant gains spell resistance

equal  to  15  +  class  level  against  all  divine  mind-affecting

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   44

5/20/04, 12:47:51 PM

spells. He cannot voluntarily lower this spell resistance. This

bene t does not stack with other sources of spell resistance.

When a de ant is the target of a divine mind-affecting spell,

he uses his highest spell resistance value.

Divine Resistance (Su): At 2nd level and higher, a de -

ant  adds  his  Charisma  modi er  (if  positive)  to  his  saving

throws against divine spells.

Divine Damage Immunity (Su): At 3rd level, a de ant

gains immunity to damage from divine power, such as that

dealt by a  ame strike spell.

Divine  Cancellation  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  a  defiant

learns  how  to  counterspell  divine  spells  without  cast-

ing a spell. The defiant must ready an action to counter-

spell  (as  normal),  but  need  not  identify  the  spell  with

Spellcraft. Treat this ability as if the defiant were using

dispel  magic  to  counter  the  spell,  at  a  caster  level  of  5  +

the defiants class level. A defiant can use this ability a

number of times per day equal to 1 + his Charisma bonus

(minimum 1).

Aligned Strike (Su): A defiant of 5th level or higher

can, with a touch, align a weapon or natural weapon so

that it is treated as of a speci c alignment for the purpose

of  overcoming  damage  reduction.  The  de ant  can  choose

any alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful), even if that

alignment opposes his own. He may not use this ability on

any weapon that already has an alignment. He can use this

ability once per day at 5th level and twice per day at 10th

level. Each use lasts for a number of minutes equal to his

class level.

Divine Prevention (Su): Once per day, a de ant of 6th

level or higher can use a standard action to bestow tempo-

rary spell resistance (15 + class level) upon a single target.

The spell resistance affects only the next divine spell tar-

geted at the subject, even a bene cial spell such as bless or

cure light wounds. If the target has not used the spell resis-

tance within 24 hours, it fades.

If the target is unwilling, the de ant must make a successful

touch attack as a standard action. If the attack succeeds, the

target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC 10 + de ants

class level + de ants Cha modi er). If the saving throw fails,

the spell resistance takes effect.

Nondetection  (Su):  At  7th  level,  a  defiant  gains  the

continuous bene t of a nondetection spell as though cast by

a sorcerer of a level equal to the de ants class level. The DC

of any attempt to break through the effect is equal to 15 +

the de ants class level.

A de ant can choose to suppress this ability. Suppressing

or reestablishing it is a free action.

Divine Retribution (Su): At 8th level, a de ant expands

the versatility of his divine cancellation ability. If he suc-

cessfully counters a divine spell, the de ant may cause the

spell to rebound at the original caster instead of causing

it to fail. This ability can be used only against divine spells

that target the de ant, not spells that affect an area or those

that target another creature.

Divine Interference (Su): At 9th level, a de ants con-

nection to the Great Unknown becomes so strong that he

generates a  eld that interferes with all divine spellcasting.

Any spellcaster within 30 feet of the de ant must succeed

on  a  Concentration  check  (DC  15  +  de ants  class  level  +

spell level) in order to successfully cast a divine spell. If

the check fails, the spell fails and is lost. A de ant cannot

choose to suppress this ability.

Divine Disavowal (Su): At 10th level, a de ants spell

resistance  extends  to  cover  all  divine  spells.  He  cannot

voluntarily lower this spell resistance. This bene t does not

stack with other sources of spell resistance. When a de ant

is the target of a divine spell, he uses his highest spell resis-

tance value.

Fallen Clerics

Clerics who have turned away from their deities make the

best de ants. They have heard the lies, and even believed

them for a time, which makes them extremely effective at

speaking out against their previous beliefs. A cleric who

worshiped  a  speci c  deity  (as  opposed  to  an  alignment,

cause, or philosophy) before taking a level in the de ant

prestige class can immediately exchange up to nine of his

cleric class levels in exchange for an equal number of de -

ant levels. For example, a 7th-level cleric/1st-level  ghter

who  takes  a  level  of  defiant  can  exchange  all  his  cleric

levels for de ant levels, becoming a 1st-level  ghter/8th-

level de ant. His skill ranks remain the same (even though

his class skill list changes), and future skill points gained

are spent using only the characters current class skill lists.

This is likely a pro table trade for an ex-cleric, since he has

given up his cleric class features in order to qualify for the

de ant class.

In addition, the character gains extra bene ts based on

the  number  of  cleric  levels  traded  in.  These  bene ts  are

cumulative.

One  or  More  Levels:  The  de ant  can  heal  his  own

wounds as a supernatural ability. Each day, he can heal a

number of points of damage equal to his de ant class level

  his  Cha  modi er,  and  he  can  spread  this  healing  out

among several uses.

Three or More Levels: The de ant can imbue himself

with  enhanced  strength,  health,  insight,  or  force  of  per-

sonality three times per day as a supernatural ability. He

gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution,

Wisdom, or Charisma for a number of minutes equal to his

de ant class level.

Five or More Levels: Once per day, the de ant can grant

himself  the  supernatural  ability  to  speak  and  understand

the language of any intelligent creature. This ability lasts for

1 hour and otherwise functions like the tongues spell.

Seven or More Levels: The de ant can use dismissal as a

spell-like ability twice per day.

Nine or More Levels: The de ant can use plane shift as a

spell-like ability three times per day.

Ex-Defiants

Being a de ant means believing in and practicing a strict

policy of nonworship. A true de ant will never do any

of the following:

Use the name of any deity as part of an oath or

curse.  (The  Athar  do  sometimes  use  the  term

Great Unknown in this manner.)

Use a holy symbol or holy water for any purpose.

(This includes symbols of any deity or water of

any alignment.)

Read or quote from any holy books.

Be the willing subject of a spell cast by a cleric,

paladin, or other divine spellcaster who claims

to draw her power from any speci c deity.

Performing  these  actions,  or  other  similar  activi-

ties,  causes  the  defiant  to  lose  all  special  abilities

granted  by  this  prestige  class.  He  cannot  there-

after  gain  levels  as  a  defiant  until  he  atones  (see

the  atonement  spell  description,  page  201  of  the

Players Handbook, bearing in mind that the atonement

must  be  cast  by  an  active  Athar  in  the  name  of  the

Great Unknown).

Aton Hollysprig the Defiant

Originally,  Aton  Hollysprig  was  a  human  cleric.  From

an  early  age,  he  felt  an  affinity  for  spiritual  practice,

but  no  matter  how  many  temples  at  which  he  prayed

for  guidance,  none  of  the  gods  ever  spoke  to  him.  He

spent  a  good  many  years  devoting  himself  to  living  a

pure  life,  praying  that  whatever  deity  beckoned  to  him

would speak up and ease his path. His life changed the

day  he  met  an  Athar  warrior  and  heard  him  describe

the  charade  that  organized  religions  have  perpetrated

on mortals for eons. Aton has fought in the name of the

Great  Unknownand  opposed  the  spread  of  all  deific

religious sectsever since.

Divine Cancellation (Ex): Aton knows how to counterspell

divine  spells  without  casting  a  spell.  He  must  ready  an

action to counterspell (as normal), but need not identify the

Aton Hollysprig

spell with a Spellcraft check. Treat this as if Aton were using

dispel magic to counter the spell, caster level 9th. Aton can

use this ability twice per day.

Divine  Damage  Immunity  (Su):  Aton  has  immunity  to

damage from divine power.

Divine  Resistance  (Su):  Aton  adds  +1  to  his  saves  against

divine spells.

THE DOOMGUARD

Members  of  the  Doomguard  believe  that  the  multiverse

is  slowly  falling  apart,  and  they  delight  in  its  inevitable

destruction. They are often nicknamed sinkers. The ulti-

mate leaders are the doomlords, who gain great powers of

entropy and destruction.

The Doomguard boasts four large citadels on the Inner

Planes, with a 10th-level doomlord residing in each one.

Doomguard visitors receive hospitality, but non-Doomguard

interlopers  nd themselves unwelcome.

In a particularly earthy and dusty part of the Elemental

Plane of Air, one  nds Citadel Alluvius, a mighty tower that

long ago fell on its side. The original ceilings and  oors are

now the walls, and the curving walls now serve as concave

 oors and convex ceilings. The stone staircases are useless,

running sideways through the tower.

On the Elemental Plane of Fire, the Crumbling Citadel

slowly turns into ruin.

The Citadel Sealt is a large, echoing vault excavated in a

section of the Elemental Plane of Earth composed of crystal-

lized salt.

Surrounded on all sides by the nothingness of the Neg-

ative  Energy  Plane,  the  Citadel  Exhalus  drifts  through

the void.

LORE OF THE DOOMGUARD

Song of Dissolution: A singular sound can sometimes

be heard here and there, if brie y, among the many planes.

When a mirror shatters, the note might be discerned. When

a wall collapses, the ringing of the tone is somewhat stron-

ger. When a city burns, the notes form a chord. And when a

continent sinks beneath the waves, the song of dissolution

plays out loud and strongfor those with the ears trained

to hear.

This mythical melody is something all Doomguard are

eager to hear. Some theorize that should the tones ever be

correctly recorded and formulated, a faction member with

that song ringing in her body would have unparalleled

powerhis every utterance a curse, his every sword-stroke

a killing blow, and his very presence, anathema.

Citadel Amulets: It is well known that the Doomguard

long ago acquired potent magic items collectively known

as the Citadel Amulets. There are four types: the Amulet of

Citadel Sealt, the Charm of Citadel Exhalus, the Talisman of

Citadel  Alluvius,  and  the  Amulet  of  the  Crumbling  Citadel.

Each of these relics is said to grant the possessor instant

passage from anywhere in the multiverse to the doorstep of

the speci ed citadel, along with perfect protection against

any adverse conditions that might exist on that citadels

plane. The Citadel Amulets are long missing, but all Doom-

guard would dearly love to  nd and possess these relics of

the organization.

PRESTIGE CLASS: DOOMLORD

The  walls  of  existence  are  tumbling  down.  Though  the

chinks and cracks may not be obvious to all, knowledge of

their  continual  collapse  is  the  impetus  to  the  doomlords

worldview. Nothing can prevent this collapseso why not

join in, and exult in the eventual end of all?

A  doomlords  life  holds  the  greatest  appeal  for   ghters

and barbarians who enjoy smashing and destroying. Some

rogues,  rangers,  and  clerics,  especially  those  devoted  to

deities  with  the  Destruction  or  Death  domains,  join  the

ranks of the faction.

NPC doomlords include soldiers, blackguards, anarchists,

and just about anyone who kills people or breaks objects.

They  make  excellent  villains  or  interesting  allies  because

they can be of any alignment. They act with a focus on

entropy, not evil.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To qualify to become a doomlord, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Feats: Improved Sunder, Weapon Focus (any sword).

Special: Must sunder a weapon, scatter 500 gp into a

crowd, and destroy a building. These acts must be witnessed

or veri ed by a member of the Doomguard.

Class Skills

The doomlords class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Disable Device

(Int),  Jump  (Str),  Knowledge  (architecture  and  engineer-

ing) (Int), Listen (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival

(Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the doomlord pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Doomlords gain pro-

 ciency with all martial weapons.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each even-numbered

doomlord level, the character gains new spells per day (and

spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in

a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the

prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (such as improved

undead  turning,  metamagic  or  item  creation

feats, or the like). If the character had

more  than  one  spellcasting  class

before  becoming  a  doomlord,

the player must decide to which

class to add each doomlord level

for  determining  spells

per  day,  spells  known,

and caster level.

Entropic Blow (Su):

As a vessel of entropy, a

doomlord  can  channel  destruc-

tive  energy,  dealing  extra  damage

with  a  melee  attack.  He  adds  his

Charisma  bonus  to  his  attack  roll  and

deals  an  extra  2  points  of  damage  per

doomlord  level.  The  entropic  blow

is especially good at unraveling that

which  binds  nonliving  matter

together. It automatically

ignores  hardness,  as

well  as  any  damage

reduction  possessed

by constructs or undead

(regardless of the source

of the damage reduction).

A doomlord may use his entropic blow once

per day at 1st level, twice per day at 5th level, and

three times per day at 10th level, but no more than once

per  round.  Use  of  the  entropic  blow  must  be  declared

before the attack is made. If the attack misses, the blow

is wasted.

Healing Resistance (Ex): As proof of his dedication to

entropy,  a  doomlord  becomes  resistant  to  healing  magic.

Conjuration (healing) spells and effects used on a doomlord

heal only half the normal amount of damage.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd, 6th, and 10th level, a doomlord gains

a  bonus  feat.  These  bonus  feats  must  be  drawn  from  the

following  list:  Cleave,  Diehard,  Endurance,  Great  Cleave,

Improved Critical, and Toughness. The doomlord must still

meet all prerequisites for the bonus feat.

Destructive  Expertise  (Ex):  As  agents  of  destruction,

2nd-level doomlords learn to promote entropy by the most

ef cient means. The doomlord may add half his class level

as a bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (architecture

and engineering) checks when attempting to take apart or

disable traps and other objects.

Negative Adaptation (Ex): At 3rd level and higher, a doom-

lord does not lose hit points or need to make Fortitude saves

due to being in a negative-dominant environment.

Body  or  Soul  (Ex):  As  he  gains  power,  a  doomlord

learns either to strengthen his body against the forces of

The neraph doomlord

Cado throws an annulat

decay  or  to  empower  his  soul  to  better  arm  himself  for

battle. At 4th level and again at 8th level, a doomlord can

increase  either  his  Constitution  score  or  his  Charisma

score  by  1.  He  need  not  choose  the  same  ability  score

each time.

Unmaking Magic (Sp): At 7th level, a doomlord gains

the ability to use dispel magic three times

per  day.  His  caster  level  is

equal  to  his  class  level.

The doomlord may add

his  Charisma  bonus

(if  any)  to  his  dispel

checks,  and  he  gains

an additional +5 bonus

when attempting to dis-

pel a permanency spell.

Disintegrate (Sp): Once

per  day  as  a  full-round

action, a doomlord of 9th

level  or  higher  can  use

disintegrate  as  a  sorcerer  of

a  level  equal  to  the  doomlords

character  level.  The  save  DC  is

16 + his Cha modi er.

Cado the Neraph Doomlord

Cado scoffs at those who feel that

being  a  ranger  is  all  about  loving

nature.  To  him,  the  path  of  a  ranger

centers on hating and hating well.

In  his  youth,  a  chaos  beast  killed

his  father,  implanting  seeds  of  hatred

toward  chaotic  outsiders.  As  he  grew  up

and  learned  more  about  the  multiverse,  Cado

observed  that  little  endures:  everyone  dies,  and  all  works

fall into ruin.

While sharing his philosophies over a tankard of ale in a

large  metropolis,  Cado  was  overheard  by  a  plane-traveling

sinker.  The  Doomguard  was  impressed  by  Cados  rant

against  the  multiverse  and  offered  him  the  challenges

required to become a doomlord.

Entropic Blow (Su): Twice per day, Cado can deal an extra

10 points of damage with a melee attack. The attack auto-

matically ignores hardness, as well as any damage reduction

possessed by constructs or undead (regardless of the source

of the damage reduction). Use of an entropic blow must be

declared before the attack is made. If the attack misses, the

blow is wasted for that day.

Neraph Camou age (Ex): When charging an opponent or

when using a thrown weapon, Cado can make one neraph

camou age  attack  per  enemy  per  encounter  (once  a  foe

sees  the  attack  in  action,  the  foe  can  discern  it  for  what

it  is  for  the  duration  of  that  combat).  Creatures  who  are

subject to a neraph charge or who are targeted by a weapon

thrown by a neraph may not apply their Dexterity bonus

to their Armor Class. All conditions that pertain when a

foe cannot apply his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class also

pertain to the neraphs attack (for instance, a sneak attack

could also be made with this attack, if the neraph can make

such an attack).

Animal Companion (Ex): Cado has a hawk named Wing as

an animal companion. This creature is a loyal companion

that accompanies the ranger on adventures as appropriate

for  its  kind.  Its  abilities  and  characteristics  are  summa-

rized below.

Wing, Hawk Animal Companion: CR ; Tiny animal;

Skills and Feats: Listen +4, Spot +18; Alertness, Improved

Bonus Tricks: Wing is capable of learning two tricks in

addition  to  any  that  Cado  might  choose  to  teach  it  (see

the Handle Animal skill, page 74 of the Players Handbook).

These  bonus  tricks  dont  require  any  training  time  or

Handle Animal checks, and they dont count against the

normal limit of tricks known by the creature. Cado has

selected guard and fetch as bonus tricks and often uses

Wing to retrieve his annulats.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  Wing  is  exposed  to  any  effect  that

normally  allows  it  to  attempt  a  Reflex  saving  throw

for half damage, it takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Body or Soul (Ex): Cado has strengthened his body, adding

+1 to his Constitution score.

Destructive Expertise (Ex): Cado has a +2 insight bonus on

Disable Device and Knowledge (architecture and engineer-

ing) checks when attempting to take apart or disable traps

and other objects.

Favored Enemy (Ex): Cado gains the indicated bonus on

Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when

using these skills against this type of creature. He gets the

same bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of

this type.

Healing Resistance (Ex): Cado is resistant to healing magic.

Conjuration (healing) spells and effects used on him heal

only half the normal amount of damage.

Leap (Ex): Cado has a +5 racial bonus on Jump checks.

Link (Ex): Cado can handle Wing as a free action. He

also gains a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks and Handle

Animal checks involving his hawk.

Negative Adaptation (Ex): Cado does not lose hit points or

need to make Fortitude saves due to being in a negative-

dominant environment.

Share Spells (Ex): Cado may have any spell he casts on

himself also affect Wing if the latter is within 5 feet at

the time. He may also cast a spell with a target of You

on Wing.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Cado can move through any sort of

undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown

areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and with-

out  taking  damage  or  suffering  any  other  impairment.

However,  thorns,  briars,  and  overgrown  areas  that  are

enchanted  or  magically  manipulated  to  impede  motion

still affect him.

Ranger Spells Prepared (2): 1stlongstrider, resist energy.

Possessions: +1 mithral shirt, 2 +1 short swords, gauntlets of ogre

power +2, periapt of Wisdom +2, cloak of Charisma +2, pearl of

power (1st), bag of tricks (rust), potion of  y, potion of blur, potion

THE FATED

The multiverse belongs to those who can hold it. Every-

one makes his own fate; youre a victim only if you allow

it. A person is meant to succeed only if he pursues suc-

cess with never-ending vigor. According to takers (as

members of the Fated are called), anyone can be great, but

greatness is not guaranteed. Hard work must come  rst,

and follow after.

Takers  belong  to  the  Fated  faction,  which  advocates,

among other things, survival of the  ttest. Some interpret

the takers philosophy as If you can take it and keep it, you

were meant to have it, but others see that as a simplistic

view. Takers believe that success is not just the accumula-

tion of physical comforts and conquering enemies by force.

More than that, success is partly determined by the respect

of  others.  With  respect,  simple  happiness  is  a  measure  of

success. For some, this road is reached by kindness without

weakness, compassion without cowardice; for others with a

more heartless outlook, happiness is gained only by depriv-

ing others of it.

The Fated have their headquarters, the Heartless Hall, on

the  rst layer of Ysgard. This fortress is a single great citadel

of stone and timber, rising like a mountain from the midst

of a great forest. Some members also call it Rowans Hall

in honor of a former leader of the faction.

LORE OF THE FATED

Acquisitive Heir: Every seven generations, a person is

born into the multiverse who embodies all the ideals of the

Fated (so goes the factions doctrine, at least). This person,

called  the  Acquisitive  Heir,  is  not  immediately  known  as

such. Only when the heir makes himself or herself known

by actions of special signi cance (which follow the Fated

credo)  does  the  possibility  arise  that  such  a  person  is  the

heir. Certainly, the heir does not know of his or her title,

and as is often the case, is surprised when representatives

of the faction approach with offers of membershipand

tests. Often, the tests reveal that the person in question is

only a pale re ection of the hoped-for heir. But even then,

the failed prospect is asked to join the Fated, since his or her

actions and philosophy are apparently well matched, even if

not heir-quality.

Luckmakers Glyph: Painted on a wall in a giant-guarded

cave  on  Muspelheim,  the  second  layer  of  the  plane  of

Ysgard,  is  a  powerful  glyph  known  as  the  Luckmakers

Glyph.  It  is  said  that  those  who  win  through  the  many

trials required to view this glyph are ever after afforded

a  bit  more  luck  than  the  average  mortal.  Whether  this

assertion is true or not, a glance at the glyph is a sure way

to become a member of the clique within the Fated who

have  fought  their  way  through  the  mountains  known  as

the Serpent Spine, fought or circumvented  re giants, and

 nally  gazed  upon  the  glyph  itself,  gladdened  that  their

bold actions have granted them entry into this special level

of Fated membership.

PRESTIGE CLASS: FATEMAKER

Life is what you make of it. Your life can be grand, excit-

ing, filled with glory, and long remembered once pastif

you choose to make your own fate. Those who hope luck

and  happenstance  will  propel  them  into  a  magnificent

fortune or endow them with lasting fame are rarely satis-

fied. Each morning as they rise, ready to face a new day,

fatemakers  repeat  to  themselves  the  following  credo:

There are two paths to take; one is easy, and that is its

only reward.

Player  characters  in  general  are  attracted  to  the  fate-

maker philosophy, since making your own fate is a primary

motivation for adventuring. Fighters and barbarians tend

to play the bully, while the other classes may take a more

subtle approach.

NPC fatemakers can be found at the heads of successful

ventures or scrambling to reach the head. Others  nd suc-

cess in maintaining collections, doing deeds of good  (or

bad), or as important functionaries in government.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To qualify to become a fatemaker, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate 8 ranks; 5 ranks

each in the other two skills.

Feats: Skill Focus (Bluff), Skill Focus (Diplomacy), or

Skill Focus (Intimidate).

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Class Skills

The  fatemakers  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Appraise  (Int),  Balance  (Dex),  Bluff  (Cha),

Climb  (Str),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Decipher

Script  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),  Escape

Artist  (Dex),  Forgery  (Int),  Gather  Information  (Cha),

Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all skills, taken indi-

vidually) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Perform

(Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis),

Sleight  of  Hand  (Dex),  Speak  Language  (n/a),  Spellcraft

(Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Use Magic

Device (Cha).

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the fatemaker.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:  Fatemakers  are

proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword,

rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Fatemakers

are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower

shields).

Because the somatic components required for fatemaker

spells are relatively simple, a fatemaker can cast fatemaker

spells  while  wearing  light  armor  without  incurring  the

normal  arcane  spell  failure  chance.  However,  like  any

other arcane spellcaster, a fatemaker wearing medium or

heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane

spell  failure  if  the  spell  in  question  has  a  somatic  com-

ponent (as most do). A fatemaker still incurs the normal

arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from

other classes.

Spells:  Beginning  at  1st  level,  a  fatemaker  gains  the

ability to cast a number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, a

fatemaker must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the

spells level, so a fatemaker with a Charisma of 10 or lower

cannot cast these spells. Fatemaker bonus spells are based

on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a

DC of 10 + spell level + the fatemakers Cha modi er. When

Table 33 indicates that a fatemaker gets 0 spells per day of

a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level

fatemaker),  she  gains  only  the  bonus  spells  she  would  be

entitled to based on her Charisma score for that spell level.

The fatemakers spell list appears below. A fatemaker casts

spells just as a sorcerer does.

Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered

level after that (8th and 10th), a fatemaker can choose

to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows.

The new spells level must be the same as that of the spell

being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower

than the highest-level fatemaker spell the character can

cast.  A  fatemaker  can  swap  only  a  single  spell  at  any

given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the

spell at the same time that she gains new spells known

for that level.

1 Provided the fatemaker has a high enough Charisma score

to have a bonus spell of this level.

Take-Charge Appeal (Ex): A fatemaker is a naturally

con dent leader. She adds 1 point to her Charisma score at

1st, 5th, and 10th level.

Con  dence of the Fated (Su): Once per day, a fatemaker

of  2nd  level  or  higher  can  add  her  class  level  as  a  morale

bonus on any single attack roll, weapon damage roll, saving

throw, or skill check.

At 7th level and higher, she can do this twice per day, but

only once in any given round.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a fatemaker

deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of  damage  on  any  successful

melee  attack  against  a  flat-footed  or  flanked  target,  or

against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus

for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against  targets  up  to  30  feet  away.  Creatures  with  con-

cealment,  creatures  without  discernible  anatomies,  and

creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are

all immune to sneak attacks. A fatemaker can choose to

deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only

when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as

a sap (blackjack).

At 6th level, the extra damage dealt by a fatemakers sneak

attack increases to 2d6 points, and at 9th level it increases to

3d6 points.

Aura of Con  dence (Su): A fatemakers con dence tends

to rub off on her allies. Beginning at 4th level, a fatemaker

grants  a  +1  morale  bonus  on  attack  rolls,  saves,  and  skill

checks to all adjacent allies (but not to herself). This ability

functions only while the fatemaker is conscious.

At 8th level, the bonus increases to +2.

Ego Manifestation (Sp): At 10th level, a fatemakers

internal con dence and ego can be made physically mani-

fest, increasing her size and power. This effect is the equiva-

lent of the righteous might spell (caster level equals class

level), except that the fatemaker doesnt gain damage reduc-

tion, but instead gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. She

can use this ability once per day.

Fatemaker Spell List

Fatemakers choose their spells from the following list.

1st Level: charm person, disguise self, expeditious retreat,

jump, sanctuary, true strike.

2nd Level: bears endurance, bulls strength, cats grace, dark-

vision,  daze  monster,  eagles  splendor,  foxs  cunning,  invisibility,

owls wisdom, resist energy, spider climb.

3rd Level: haste, protection from energy, nondetection, sugges-

tion, tongues.

4th  Level:  charm  monster,  neutralize  poison,  remove  curse,

restoration, stoneskin.

Andrea Lethyr the Fatemaker

Following  her  natural  acquisitiveness,  the  hal ing  rogue

Andrea Lethyr lucked upon a cache of Fated philosophy. In

no time, she had skipped the humdrum Material Plane to

seek the Fated faction. Since then, Andrea has become one

of the most noted fatemakers to take the special Fated train-

ing. One day, she hopes to get it all.

of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill

to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, a magic

trap (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If

her Disable Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or

more, she discovers how to bypass the trap without trig-

gering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Andrea retains her Dexterity bonus

to Armor Class even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

THE MINDS EYE

Throughout the planes, many groups search for enlight-

enment. One such organization is the Minds Eye,

headquartered  in  the  Outlands.  Members  of

the  organization  call  themselves  seekers,  and

their  elite  members  are  known  as  visionary

seekers. They focus on the ultimate journey

of self-discovery by seeking out challenges

throughout the cosmos.

Seekers  believe,  among  other

things, that one must discover true

knowledge,  but  to  discover  true

knowledge, one must  rst truly know

oneself. Though some might inter-

pret the seekers philosophy as All

knowledge  lies  within,  that  doesnt

tell the whole story. The seekers path

to knowledge only begins with discovery

of  the  inner  self.  Once  the  inner  self  is

adequately  charted  and  understood,

barriers  to  accepting  knowledge  that

the multiverse provides every day will

weaken  and  collapse.  For  the  truly

enlightened, it is said that knowledge

pours in like water from a burst dam.

The  seekers  prefer  the  Concor-

dant  Domain  of  the  Outlands

because  it  sits  at  the  center

of  the  Outer  Planes  and

provides easy access to the

rest of the multiverse. They

maintain  a  base  in  each  of

the portal towns.

LORE OF THE MINDS EYE

Orb  of  Omniconsciousness:  Like  so  many

organizations,  the  Minds  Eye  has  its  favored  legends  and

anecdotes important to the philosophy of its organization.

Thus, any seeker soon hears mention of the Orb of Omni-

consciousness. Said to be the eye plucked from a deity long

dead, the Orb is purported to grant a clear, unsullied view of

reality to any that gaze into or through its crystalline focus.

According to the lore, though, only those who have already

gained  a  measure  of  self-knowledge  should  ever  attempt

this task. Those of lesser mental mettle risk blasting their

minds with knowledge too pure and uncensored to assimi-

PRESTIGE CLASS:

VISIONARY SEEKER

Everyones potential is like an in nite, mist-shrouded plain

empty at  rst, but pregnant with possibility. All beings have

within them the possibility for building knowledge upon

that plain, or for piercing the mists that obscure it to  nd

what treasures of mind and spirit reside there. A visionary

seeker knows how to navigate the mental plain stretching

out  ahead,   nding  landfall  and  truly  discovering  what  it

means to know.

Anyone imbued with a strong sense of self and a quest-

ing spirit may become a visionary seeker. However, spell-

casters  give  up  much  of  their  spell  progression.  Having

some  spellcasting  ability  enhances  the  visionary  seekers

path of enlightenment, creating a few more bright sparks.

Multiclassed  wizards,  especially  diviners,   nd  the  life  of

a  visionary  seeker  attractive.  Sorcerers  with  their  innate

spellcasting powers often hearken to the self-centered focus

of the group that detractors sometimes call the Minds I.

Occasionally, a multiclassed cleric or druid will choose to

quest for personal ful llment and become a member of the

prestige class.

Occasional  NPC  visionary  seekers  can  be  found  any-

where in the multiverse. Usually, they strive to the utmost

to  pursue  personal  goals,  often  without  much  concern

for others.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To qualify to become a visionary seeker, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (any single skill) 8 ranks or Survival

8 ranks.

Special: Must be inducted by a member of the Minds Eye.

Class Skills

The  visionary  seekers  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability

for  each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (any)  (Int),

Table 34: The Visionary Seeker

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the visionary seeker

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Visionary  seekers

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At each odd-numbered

visionary  seeker  level,  the  character  gains  new  spells  per

day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained

a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before

adding  the  prestige  class.  He  does  not,  however,  gain  any

other  bene t  a  character  of  that  class  would  have  gained

(improved  undead  turning,  metamagic  or  item  creation

feats, or the like). If the character had more than one spell-

casting class before becoming a visionary seeker, the player

must decide to which class to add each visionary seeker level

for  determining  spells  per  day,  spells  known,  and  overall

caster level.

Divination  Expertise  (Ex):  A  visionary  seeker  may

add his class level to his caster level when casting divina-

tion spells. This bonus stacks with the bonus gained for

additional spellcasting levels at every odd-numbered class

level. For example, a 10th-level wizard/4th-level visionary

seeker would cast divinations as a 16th-level caster (10 for

wizard levels, 4 for visionary seeker levels, and 2 for the

added  spellcasting  levels  gained  from  visionary  seeker

class levels).

Spell Mimic (Sp): Once per day, a visionary seeker of

2nd level or higher can mimic any spell (arcane or divine)

of a level no greater than his class level. He must have seen

the spell cast within the previous 24 hours, and he must

supply  any  material  components  or  focus  that  the  spell

requires. The spells casting time is as normal for the spell.

The visionary seeker cannot apply metamagic effects to the

spell, even if the original spell included such effects. Treat

his caster level for the spell as equal to his highest caster

level in any class.

per day, and at 10th level, he can use it three times per day.

Intuition  (Ex):  A  3rd-level  visionary  seeker  gains  a  +2

insight  bonus  on  initiative  checks  and  Will  saves  against

illusions. These bonuses increase to +4 at 7th level.

Bend Fate (Su): At 4th level, a visionary seeker gains the

ability to manipulate fate in his favor. Once per day, he can

level can reroll one roll that he has just made before the DM

declares  whether  the  roll  results  in  success  or  failure.  He

must take the result of the reroll, even if its worse than the

original roll.

Moment of Prescience (Sp): Once per day, a 10th-level

visionary seeker can use moment of prescience as a spell-like

ability.  Treat  his  caster  level  as  equal  to  his  highest  caster

level in any class.

Sebastian the Visionary Seeker

Sebastian  always  knew  he  was  destined  for  greatness.

As  a  youth,  his  sorcerous  powers  began  to  manifest,

and  he  felt  assured  of  his  path  to  power.  As  the  years

passed, he grew in skill and ability, yet he always felt a

nebulous  longing  to  know  his  place  in  the  multiverse.

His pursuit of arcane spellcasting power began to grow

stale beside the fresh challenges he encountered. When

Sebastian  met  his  first  visionary  seeker,  he  knew  that

he  would  become  one,  too.  Whatever  splendid  fate  he

heads toward remains uncertain, but hes confident hes

making progress.

Spell Mimic (Sp): Once per day, Sebastian can mimic any

spell (arcane or divine) of 2nd level or lower. He must have

seen the spell cast within the previous 24 hours, and he

must  supply  any  material  components  or  focus  that  the

spell requires. The spells casting time is as normal for the

spell. Sebastian cannot apply metamagic effects to the spell,

even if the original spell included such effects. Treat him as

a 6th-level caster.

Divination Expertise (Ex): Sebastian casts divination spells

as an 8th-level caster.

THE SOCIETY

OF SENSATION

The multiverse offers a multitude of different sensations

to be experienced and savored. The Society of Sensation is

based on Arborea. In Sigil, it runs the Civic Festhall and

has a large membership base in the planar city. Many folk

dabble as novice members of the Society of Sensation and

see it merely as an excuse to wine, dine, and romance. Their

selective attitude limits both their desire to advance in the

Society and their ability to do so. True sensates seek out

different experiencesmany pleasurable, many noton a

quest of personal ful llment.

Sensation for the sake of itself is not a philosophy that

many can understand. But to those of this organization, it is

a doctrine suited to life itself. After all, life is a brief  icker

for many, and the droll comment What will it matter in

a hundred years? is all too true for most creatures. Thus,

life is a short-lived gift. Failing to explore this gift in all its

dimensions  is  like  spurning  the  gift,  setting  it  aside  on  a

shelf where other objects of little interest accumulate. And

how else can life be experienced, but through the senses?

This is the secret the sensates know: To feel is to live, and to

live is to feel.

Sensates operate festhalls and sensoriums (lavish rooms

designed to allow visitors to sample diverse experiences)

in all the planar metropolises. Their two largest and most

impressive sites are the Civic Festhall in Sigil and the fest-

hall in the Gilded Hall on Arborea.

LORE OF THE SENSATES

Sense  Escalation  Tank:  Rich  sensates  can  sometimes

afford to visit (or better yet, install in their homes) special

body-encapsulating  devices  known  as  sense  escalation

tanks. A minute in one of these magically assisted capsules

is like a day of real life, and a day spent inside a tank is like

a lifetime! The price is steep, even for a minute, but to a sen-

sate, every moment is worth it.

PRESTIGE CLASS:

ARDENT DILETTANTE

The breeze that caresses the face brings with it a cooling

balm and scent traces that trigger memories of old. The

flavor of the fruit plucked from the tree is tart but sweet,

and  the  sticky  juice  explodes  in  the  mouth  with  a  tex-

ture just as important as taste. The voices of the choir are

rough but earnest, and they speak of experiences hidden

in the melody that only a sensate can separate from the

mix and appreciate.

Anyone can become an ardent dilettante. All it takes is a

diversity of interests and a moderate level of ability in one

skill. Bards and rogues are the most common among the

members, but characters of all classes can  nd the calling

of the ardent dilettante to their liking. However, advancing

beyond 3rd level in the prestige class requires a larger suite of

skills, abilities, and experiences and offers commensurately

greater rewards. Only multiclass characters can achieve the

highest levels of membership.

NPC  ardent  dilettantes  can  be  found  in  any  walk  of

life.  Those  who  merely  dabble  in  the  class  often  focus

on hedonistic pleasure. More devoted ardent dilettantes

tend to travel widely and enjoy exploring or  nding new

challenges. They make ideal cohorts, allies, or employers

of planar adventurers. NPC ardent dilettantes can make

equally viable villains, for a quest for new sensations can

lead down a very cruel and dark path.

Hit Die: d8.

To qualify to become a 10th-level ardent dilettante, a charac-

ter must ful ll all the following criteria.

Skills: Perform (any single skill) 8 ranks, any Strength-

based skill 5 ranks, any Dexterity-based skill 5 ranks, any

Class Skills

All  skills  are  class  skills  for  the  ardent

dilettante.  This  includes  all  skills

listed in the Players Handbook, as

well  as  all  skills  described  in

other  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS

supplements.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6

+ Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class

features  of  the  ardent  dilet-

tante prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Ardent dilettantes

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  At  each  ardent  dilet-

tante level after 1st, the character gains new spells per day

(and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a

level  in  a  spellcasting  class  to  which  she  belonged  before

adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any

other bene t a character of that class would have gained

(improved  undead  turning,  metamagic  or  item  creation

feats, or the like). If the character had more than one spell-

casting  class  before  becoming  an  ardent  dilettante,  the

player must decide to which class to add each ardent dilet-

tante level for determining spells per day, spells known, and

overall caster level.

Heightened  Senses  (Su):  An  ardent  dilettante  gains  a

competence bonus on Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot

checks equal to 1 + one-half her class level.

Lore: An ardent dilettante hears many intriguing rumors

and learns odd facts while traveling. She may make a spe-

cial  lore  check  (1d20  +  her  ardent  dilettante  level  +  her

Int  modifier)  to  see  whether  she  knows  some  relevant

information about a notable person, place, or thing. This

ability  is  otherwise  identical  to  the  bardic  knowledge

ability (see page 28 of the Players Handbook). If an ardent

dilettante has a similar ability from another class (such

as bard or loremaster), her ardent dilettante levels stack

with  those  class  levels  for  determining  the  success  of

the lore check.

Enthrall (Sp): Starting at 2nd level, an ardent dilettante

can recount one of her many adventures or experiences,

capturing the attention of an audience as with an enthrall

spell. An ardent dilettante can use this ability once per day

for every two class levels she has. Caster level equals char-

acter level; save DC 12 + Cha modi er.

Joie  de  Vivre  (Sp):  An  ardent  dilettante  of  3rd  level

or higher takes such obvious pleasure in life that she can

influence those around her to feel the same

way, as with a good hope spell. An ardent

dilettante can use this ability once per

day  for  every  three  class  levels

she  has.  Caster  level  equals

character  level;  save  DC  12  +

Cha modifier.

Bonus  Feat:  At  4th  level,  7th

level, and 10th level, an ardent dilet-

tante gains a bonus feat. She must meet

the prerequisites for the feat she selects.

Sense  Link  (Sp):  At  4th  level,

an  ardent  dilettante  becomes  able  to

establish  a  link  with  another  creature

within  30  feet,  gaining  the  benefit

of  a  clairaudience/clairvoyance  spell

centered  on  that  creatures  position.

Once the link is established, distance

is not a factor (though it works only on the plane you and

the  target  currently  occupy).  Caster  level  equals  ardent

dilettante level; save DC 13 + Cha modi er.

Scent  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  an  ardent  dilettantes  sense  of

smell becomes so acute that she gains the scent special qual-

ity (see page 314 of the Monster Manual).

Seen It Before (Su): Beginning at 6th level, an ardent

dilettante can make a Will save to identify an illusion by

perceiving it with any of her senses, even if the illusion

provides sensory input for that sense. The DM should make

this save in secret, to avoid alerting players that the char-

acter is witnessing an illusion. If the save fails, the ardent

dilettante doesnt get another one until she interacts with

the illusion.

See It Again (Su): Once per day, when targeted by or in

the area of a spell effect, an ardent dilettante of 8th level

or higher can use her next action (if it is made within 1

round of the casting) to duplicate the casting of the spell,

with all aspects identical. For instance, an ardent dilet-

tante subjected to a dominate person spell cast by a 12th-

level sorcerer can use an identical dominate person effect

in the next round. The duplicated effect has the same save

DC, range, and duration as if the original caster had cast

it. The ardent dilettante automatically knows all relevant

information about the spell in question (its name, effect,

save DC, and so on).

Blindsense  (Ex):  At  9th  level,  an  ardent  dilettantes

senses become so attuned to her surroundings that she

gains blindsense out to 10 feet.

Death Holds No Mysteries (Su): When a 10th-level

ardent dilettante is brought back from the dead by such

magic as raise dead and resurrection, the ardent dilettante

does not lose a level.

Bonus Trick: Bluescale is capable of learning one trick

in addition to any that Felice might choose to teach it

(see  the  Handle  Animal  skill,  page  74  of  the  Players

Handbook).  This  bonus  trick  doesnt  require  any  train-

ing time or Handle Animal checks, and it doesnt count

against the normal limit of tricks known by the creature.

Felice has selected guard as the bonus trick.

Felice the Ardent Dilettante

Felice joined the Society of Sensation on a whim. A bard

of some skill, she recounted several of her adventures and

gained membership. The life of a sensate enthralled her.

She enjoyed seeking out new experiences so much that

she recently studied as a druid in order to gain the divine

spellcasting ability required to advance in the society as a

true ardent dilettante.

THE TRANSCENDENT

ORDER

The  multiverse  is  really  one  tremendous  organic  entity

moving  with  some  greater  end  that  is  beyond  mortal

minds to comprehend. Each one of us is an infinitesimal

part of the whole, playing out some role whose ultimate

purpose  we  could  never  guess.  Since  the  multiverse

would not work against its own interests, we all are born

with perfect knowledge of what it is we are supposed to

do. However, most people bury their instincts under fear,

self-doubt, meaningless trivia that some call education,

and worst of all, ego.

The Transcendent Order believes that with proper train-

ing  of  mind  and  body,  a  person  can  become  so  in  touch

with the natural order (and her part in it) that correct action

 ows through her without any effort or thinking. Think-

ing adds hesitation, plants the seeds of doubt, and overrules

instinct. Once the mind and body are in harmony, the spirit

becomes in tune with the multiverse. Then a body knows

just where and how she should be.

The  Transcendent  Order  is  strongest  on  Elysium,  the

plane  of  harmonious  good.  It  maintains  a  monastery  on

Amoria, the topmost layer of that plane, where visitors are

always welcome and individuals are encouraged to study,

practice, or meditate on whatever interests them most.

Members  of  the  Transcendent  Order  are  often  called

ciphers, and the elite among them are known as cipher

adepts.

LORE OF THE

TRANSCENDENT ORDER

Mauvignon  Fragments:  The  Mauvignon  Codex  is

lost, destroyed by jealous pretenders. However, fragments

of this archetypal tome remain, studied by the Transcen-

dent Order. Through a combination of contemplation and

study  of  fragments,  ciphers  come  closer  to  attaining  the

zonethe place where actions  ow without thought and

time  loses  all  meaning  (and  perhaps  time  itself  becomes

dissociated with consciousness). Those who study the frag-

ments learn several tenets, collectively known as streams.

As a cipher masters one stream, his or her consciousness

expands,  allowing  greater  instinctive  action  and  a  mind

amenable  to  study  of  the  next  stream.  Unfortunately,

the  fragments  are  far  from  complete,  and  many  rumored

streams of the original Codex remain permanently beyond

study, unless time itself could be reversed and the Codex

plucked from the past.

Pinnacle  of  Perfect  Knowledge:  This  site  is  consid-

ered by most to be  ctional rather than an actual physical

location. Nonetheless, some ciphers are glad to express their

belief in the Pinnacle, where perfect knowledge is attained.

Others speak of the Pinnacle not as a physical location to

which they can travel but as a metaphor for the place that

all of the Transcendent Order seek. When a cipher appears

to be acting with perfect knowledge, others will say that he

or she has climbed the Pinnacle.

PRESTIGE CLASS: CIPHER ADEPT

When one action follows the next seamlessly and smoothly,

without hesitation and without anxiety, oneness with the

multiverse is touched upon, however brie y. When eloquence

 ows  from  the  pen  without  effort,  solutions  to  problems

bubble up from untapped mental reservoirs without strain.

When the blade or spell passes from one enemy to the next

in  perfect  seamless  integration,  the  cipher  adept  knows

blissno, the cipher adept is bliss.

Barbarians, sorcerers,  ghters, and rogues are most likely

to choose this class. Their goal-oriented nature makes them

open to the notion that there is a best way to perform a

particular task and a path of least resistance for them to

follow. Wizards, druids, bards, clerics, and paladins gener-

ally do not make good cipher adepts. They spend their lives

acquiring knowledge, learning the proper way to perform

certain  acts,  and  believing  that  personal  advancement

comes from strictly following a particular code or system

of behavior.

As NPCs, cipher adepts can be found everywhere, even in

the most unlikely places. Their belief in the power of seren-

dipity often leads them to wander into locations that most

people would consider too dangerous or unpro table.

Hit Die: d8.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Cipher adepts gain no

pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Improved Unarmed Strike: A cipher adept instinctively

knows how to use her body as a weapon. At 1st level, she

gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.

Strike the Weak Spot (Ex): As a standard action, a cipher

adept can attack an unattended object at what she perceives

to be its weakest point. If she hits, she may attempt a Con-

centration check (DC 10 + objects hardness). If this check

succeeds, she can ignore the objects hardness when calcu-

lating damage for this attack.

Evasion  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a  cipher  adept  gains  eva-

sion. If exposed to any effect that normally allows her to

attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes

no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion

ability can be used only if the cipher is wearing light armor

or no armor.

Combat Instinct (Ex): At 3rd level, a cipher adept gains

a  +1  insight  bonus  to  her  Armor  Class  and  on  initiative

checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level and to +3 at

9th level.

Bonus  Feat:  At  4th  level  and  8th  level,  a  cipher  adept

gets  a  bonus  feat.  Each  bonus  feat  must  be  selected  from

the following list, and the cipher adept must meet all the

prerequisites of the feat to select it:

Acrobatic, Alertness, Animal Af nity, Combat Re exes,

Deft Hands, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved

Sunder, Lightning Re exes, Mobility, Nimble Fingers, Pre-

cise Shot, Self-Suf cient, Spring Attack.

Combination Strike (Ex): At 5th level, a cipher adepts

speed and re exes in combat allow her to follow up a devas-

tating attack with a secondary maneuver. If she con rms a

critical hit on a melee attack, she may immediately attempt

a disarm or sunder attempt against the same opponent as a

free action. This disarm or sunder attempt provokes attacks

of  opportunity  as  normal  unless  the  cipher  adept  has  the

appropriate feat.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 7th level, a cipher adept

gains improved evasion. This ability works like evasion,

except that while the cipher adept still takes no damage on

a successful Re ex saving throw against attacks such as a

dragons  breath  weapon  or  a   reball,  she  henceforth  takes

only half damage on a failed save. A helpless cipher adept

(such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain

the bene t of improved evasion.

Move Without Barriers (Su): At 10th level, a cipher

adept becomes able to step into the Ethereal Plane for short

periods  of  time.  The  character  can  become  ethereal  for  a

number  of  rounds  per  day  equal  to  1  +  her  Wis  modi er

(minimum 1). These rounds need not be consecutive. This

ability otherwise functions as the ethereal jaunt spell.

instinctual  organs  wherever  they  led  her.  Thanks  to  the

ambitious group of adventurers she calls her friends, this

eventually included several trips across the multiverse and

back. At  rst, Tarhorn felt overwhelmed by the immensity

of  it  allshe  began  to  doubt  that  her  simple  instincts

would  be  able  to  lead  her  through  the  vastness  of  the

planes. But the cipher adept teachings gave her peace and

a renewed faith not only in herself, but in the traditional

ways of her people.

mally allows her to attempt a Re ex saving throw for

half damage, she takes no damage with a successful

saving throw.

Half-Orc Traits: For all effects related to race, Tar-

horn is considered an orc.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Tarhorn cannot be

 anked  and  can  only  be  sneak  attacked  except  by  a

rogue of at least 11th level.

Rage (Ex): Twice per day, Tarhorn can enter a state

of   erce  rage  that  lasts  for  7  rounds.  The  following

changes are in effect as long as she rages: hp 117; AC

19,  touch  11,   at-footed  19;  Grp  +15;  Atk  +17

melee  (1d12+13/3,  +2  greataxe);  Full  Atk

+17/+12 melee (1d12+13/3, +2 greataxe); SV

Fort +8, Will +5; Str 22, Con 18. At the end of

her rage, Tarhorn is fatigued for the duration

of the encounter.

Strike the Weak Spot (Ex): As a standard action,

Tarhorn can attack an unattended object at what she

perceives  to  be  its  weakest  point.  If  the  attack  suc-

ceeds, Tarhorn must attempt a Concentration check

(DC 10 + objects hardness). If this check succeeds, she

can ignore the objects hardness when calculating damage

for this attack.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Tarhorn retains her Dexterity bonus

to Armor Class even when flat-footed or targeted by an

unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

Possessions: +2 breastplate, amulet of natural armor +1, +1 great-

axe, +1 composite longbow (+4 Str bonus), 1,000 gp.

THE XAOSITECTS

The multiverse is chaos. Neither order nor pattern can be

recognized. But chaos has a beauty and wonder all its own.

By immersing oneself in anarchy, one learns to appreciate

randomness.  By  studying  the  quandaries  of  nature,  one

learns that the sublime intricacies of disorder are the very

foundations of existence.

Thats all well and good, but its not much fun. Xaositects

(kay-OH-si-tekts) want to play with disorder and race along

on the crest of chaotic energy that is the multiverse. Xaosi-

tects promote chaos in all its forms. Members of this faction

interpret all physical phenomena as if they were engendered

by a physical force: Chaos, with a capital C.

Limbo is thick with Xaositects. But they dont maintain a

citadel, dont get much involved in local politics, and dont

seem to work toward any particular end. Apparently, they

come to the swirling plane simply to revel in the eternal

newness of chaos.

The true masters of chaos among the Xaositects are the

chaoticians. How does an organization without organiza-

tion have elite members? Its really just a matter of advanc-

ing ones understanding and appreciation for pure chaos to

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   60

5/20/04, 12:54:35 PM

the next level. One problem: These aesthetes of anarchy

didnt bother to name themselves. They simply called them-

selves Xaositects, just like any other member of the faction.

Maybe they didnt care enough to come up with a new name,

or maybe they just enjoyed the confusion caused by the situ-

ation. Somewhere along the way, though, someone started

calling these elite characters chaoticians, and they liked the

name enough to keep it. Sometimes, they even remember

to use it.

LORE OF THE XAOSITECTS

Theory  of  the  Strange:  The  Xaositects  believe  that

underpinning all existence is a sea of chaos. Though the

cosmos is too complex for chaos to be recognized with the

naked  eye,  certain  techniques  and  mindsets  practiced  by

the Xaositectsmindsets that often cause others to dismiss

them  as  insaneallow  faction  members  to  comprehend

the world in all its complexity as a set of simpli ed abstrac-

tions, where similarity and attraction are the only rules of

existence. By concentrating on these points of abstraction,

a Xaositect can see underlying trends and sometimes even

make  predictions  that  others  cannot  hope  to  emulate.

Moment  by  moment,  a  Xaositect  seeks  to  live  more  fully

according to the Theory of the Strange.

Blade of the Attractor: All groups have their relics, and

among those revered by the Xaositects, the Blade of the

Attractor is high on the list. The Blade of the Attractor is

said to cut reality to the bone, revealing the hidden cycles

that dictate each moment, and at the same time disrupting

those cyclesthat which the blade marks is never the same

again. In most cases, this is accomplished easily enough by

separating life from the living, but the blade also can serve

a philosopher by disrupting the machinations of politicians,

the  ow direction of streams, and weather patterns across

entire continents.

PRESTIGE CLASS: CHAOTICIAN

The multiverse is a wonder, and the only prediction one

can make is that it is unpredictable. The amazing spon-

taneity  of  reality  is  the  foundation  upon  which  chaoti-

cians act. Instead of being tiresome and translucent, the

cosmos is marvelous and mysterious. Chaoticians seek to

enjoy the beauty of the unpredictable, and by seeking to

emulate  the  philosophy  of  chaos  in  their  actions,  they

create a fabulous journey through life in which nothing

is ever a bore.

Any  character  who   nds  inspiration  in  disorder  is  a

potential candidate for this prestige class, though members

of spellcasting classes are less likely to become chaoticians

due to their loss of increased spellcasting ability.

Sometimes,  NPC  chaoticians  are  discovered  lurking  in

the  shadows  of  a  city  street,  seemingly  lost  in  a  confused

veil of their own imagination. In fact, they are gazing at the

world in its undisguised state: as pure chaos.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a chaotician, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Base Fort Save Bonus: +2.

Base Re  ex Save Bonus: +2.

Base Will Save Bonus: +2.

Alignment: Any chaotic.

Class Skills

The  chaoticians  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Bluff  (Cha),  Craft  (Int),  Decipher  Script  (Int),

Diplomacy (Cha), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually)

(Int), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Use

Magic Device (Cha).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  chaotician

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: Chaoticians are pro -

cient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of

armor, and with shields.

Chaotic  Contagion  (Su):  A  chaotician  can  attempt

to infect a target with chaotic impulses that disrupt the

targets  ability  to  defend  against  the  chaotician.  If  the

chaotician makes a successful melee touch attack against

the  target,  the  target  creature  takes  a  2  penalty  to  his

Armor Class against attacks made by the chaotician, a 2

penalty on saves made to resist spells or abilities of the

chaotician, and a 2 penalty on skill checks opposed by

the  chaotician.  A  successful  Will  save  (DC  10  +  chaoti-

cians class level + chaoticians Cha modifier) negates the

effect and gives the target immunity to similar attacks by

that chaotician for 24 hours. This effect lasts for 1 hour

per class level.

A chaotician can use this ability a number of times per

day equal to his class level.

Scof  aw (Su): Divinations cast by lawful characters are

dif cult to perform on chaoticians. This ability functions

much  like  a  nondetection  spell,  except  that  it  is  useful  for

shielding a chaotician only against creatures of lawful align-

ment. Such creatures must succeed on a caster level check

against a DC of 15 + the chaoticians class level + his Cha

bonus (if any) to successfully employ a divination against a

chaotician. This ability can be suppressed or resumed as a

free action.

Anarchic Grace (Su): A 2nd-level chaotician accepts that

randomness underlies all reality. Once per day, the chaoti-

cian can tap into this randomness to make his movements

and posture unpredictable. This effect results in attackers

having  a  50%  miss  chance  on  all  their  attacks.  Even  true

seeing and similar effects cant offset this ability. Activating

the effect is a free action, and it lasts for a number of rounds

equal to the chaoticians class level. When it ends, the chaoti-

cian becomes fatigued for 1 minute.

At 4th level and higher, a chaotician can use this ability

twice per day.

Babble  (Su):  Once  per  day,  chaotician  of  3rd  level  or

higher can generate a 10-foot-radius emanation that causes

all sounds in the area to turn into garbled, cacophonous,

and unintelligible noise. Sounds that issue from, enter, or

pass through the area are altered and made unrecognizable

as a natural sound. Within this area, verbal communication

is impossible. Even something as simple as a shout of sur-

prise is turned into a warped and alien sound. Spells with

verbal components cannot be cast. Scrolls and other magic

items that require a verbal component to be activated do

not  function.  Spells  and  items

that rely on sound do not

function.  Sonic  damage

has no effect.

Clarity  of  Confusion

(Su): Starting at 3rd level, a

chaotician gains a +2 insight

bonus  on  saves  against  illu-

sion (pattern) spells, enchant-

ment  (compulsion)  spells,

and  spells  with  the  lawful

descriptor.

Destinys  Arbiter

(Su): A 5th-level chaoti-

cian  is  a  friend  of  chaos

and can summon it. Once

per  day  as  a  free  action,

the  character  can  either

reroll  one  roll  he  just  made,

or  force  another  creature  to

reroll a result the chaotician does

not  like.  A  chaotician  must

use  this  ability  immedi-

ately after the result of the

roll  is  known.  If  he  wants  to

force another creature to reroll a

result, the chaotician must be able to see the

other creature, and it must be within 60 feet

of the chaotician. Whether rerolling his own roll or forcing

another to reroll, the results of the second roll stand.

Grimble Urd the Chaotician

Grimble was always a little brighter, a little more inquisi-

tive,  and  far  more  erratic  than  his  brethren.  When  he

skipped the Material Plane for greener pastures on wider

planes,  the  disorder  of  the  multiverse  was  all  he  could

see.  The  Xaositects  had  a  convert  even  before  Grimble

realized  he  would  discover  the  loose-knit  group  of  the

like-minded.

Chaotic  Contagion  (Su):

Twice  per  day,  Grimble  can

attempt  to  infect  a  target

with  chaotic  impulses  that

disrupt  the  targets  ability  to

defend  against  him.  If

Grimble makes a successful

melee  touch  attack  against

the  target,  the  target  creature

takes a 2 penalty to its Armor Class

against attacks made by Grimble, a 2 penalty

on saves made to resist spells or abilities of the

chaotician,  and  a  2  penalty  on  skill  checks

opposed by Grimble. A successful DC 11 Will

save  negates  the  effect  and  gives  the  target  immunity  to

similar attacks by Grimble for 24 hours. This effect lasts

for 2 hours.

Anarchic  Grace  (Su):  Once  per  day  as  a  free  action,

Grimblecan tap into the randomness that underlies reality

to  make  his  movements  and  posture  unpredictable.  This

effect results in attackers having a 50% miss chance on all

attacks. Even true seeing and similar effects cant offset this

ability. The effect lasts for 2 rounds. When it ends, Grimble

becomes fatigued for 1 minute.

detection spell, except that it is useful for shielding Grimble

only against divination effects cast by creatures of lawful

alignment. Such creatures must succeed on a DC 17 caster

level  check  to  successfully  employ  a  divination  against

Grimble.  This  ability  can  be  suppressed  or  resumed  as  a

free action.

Possessions:  +1  full  plate,  heavy  steel  shield,  +1  bastard

sword, masterwork composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), 10

normal  arrows,  10  cold  iron  arrows,  10  silvered  arrows,

moderate wounds.

OTHER PRESTIGE CLASSES

These  prestige  classes  dont  necessarily  belong  to

speci c  organizations  (though  groups  of  them  may

well  exist).  They  can  be  encountered

anywhere on the planes.

ASTRAL DANCER

The  Astral  Plane  is  a  place  of  no

gravity; moving through it is more

like  ying with perfect maneuver-

ability, like walking on air. Trav-

elers  quickly  learn  to  change

directions  by  mentally  visual-

izing solid footing and pivoting

on  it.  To  longtime  inhabitants

of  the  Astral  Plane,  ignoring

the  lack  of  gravity  eventually

becomes  second  nature.  But  a

few skilled combatants learn to

take advantage of that situation.

Some  fighters,  barbarians,  and

rangers make decent astral danc-

ers, but the best begin as monks

or rogues. Their practiced grace

enables them to leap from vantage

to  vantage  quickly,  and  to  shift

balance instinctively. Spellcasters can

eventually master the art of the astral

dancer, but for them it pays off only in

a certain improvement in their ability

to deliver melee touch spells.

Astral dancers work quite well alone, but they are truly

formidable in numbers. The art is sometimes found among

githzerai  monks,  and  githzerai  rrakkma  (hunting  parties

that  seek  out  and  kill  mind   ayers)  occasionally  include

astral  dancers.  The  most  common  practitioners  are  gith-

yanki and buommans (see Chapter 1), natives of the Astral

Plane who learn to take every advantage that the environ-

ment provides them.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become an astral dancer, a character must ful-

 ll all the following criteria.

Skills: Balance 8 ranks, Jump 8 ranks, Tumble 8 ranks.

Feats: Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack.

Class Skills

The astral dancers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Bluff  (Cha),  Climb  (Str),  Escape

Artist (Dex), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (the planes)

(Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Move  Silently  (Dex),  Profession  (Wis),

Search (Int), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Tumble

(Dex), and Use Rope (Dex).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the astral dancer

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Astral  dancers

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Relative  Altitude  (Ex):  An  astral  dancer  is

experienced  at  combating  foes  in  no-gravity  envi-

ronments. While on the Astral Plane (or any other

plane or region without gravity), she is always

considered to have higher ground over

her opponent and thus gains a +1 bonus

on melee attack rolls.

Evasion  (Ex):  Beginning  at  2nd

level, an astral dancer can avoid damage

from certain attacks with a successful

Re ex save. See the monk class feature

on page 41 of the Players Handbook. Ini-

tially, an astral dancers evasion ability

is only effective while she is on a plane

wth no gravity.

Tatha practices her balance

At 4th level and higher, an astral

dancer  can  use  her  evasion  ability

in  all  environments,  regardless  of

gravity.

Improved Maneuverability (Ex):

At  3rd  level,  an  astral  dancer  begins

developing  more  control  over  her

 ight in no-gravity situations. When

she makes a double move on a plane with

the  no  gravity  trait  (such  as  the  Astral  Plane),  an  astral

dancers maneuverability drops to good (rather than to aver-

age). When she moves four times her speed on the Astral

Plane (running, essentially), her maneuverability drops to

poor (rather than to clumsy).

At 9th level, an astral dancer retains her perfect maneu-

verability  even  when  she  makes  a  double  move,  and  her

maneuverability drops only to average whe she moves at up

to four times her speed.

Astral  Dodge  (Ex):  At  5th  level,  an  astral  dancer

becomes  so  adept  at  reacting  to  attacks  that  she  gains  a

+2 dodge bonus to her Armor Class when in a no-gravity

environment  (or  a  +1  dodge  bonus  to  her  Armor  Class

when in an environment with gravity). At 10th level, this

63

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   63

5/20/04, 12:54:45 PM

bonus increases to +4 in a no-gravity environment (or +2

in an environment with gravity).

Improved  Evasion  (Ex):  Beginning  at  6th  level,  an

astral dancer can avoid damage from certain attacks with

a successful Reflex save and take only half damage on a

failed save. See the monk class feature on page 42 of the

Players  Handbook.  Initially,  an  astral  dancers  improved

evasion  ability  is  only  effective  while  she  is  on  a  plane

wth no gravity.

At  8th  level  and  higher,

an  astral  dancer  can  use  her

improved  evasion  ability  in

all  environments,  regardless  of

gravity.

Astral Agility (Ex): At 7th level and

higher.  an  astral  dancers  can  use  her

agility  and  athleticism  to  adjust  her

opponents  position  while  in  a  no-

gravity environment. Once per round

as a move action, an astral dancer can

attempt  to  switch  places  with  an

adjacent creature. The adjacent creature

must be the same size as or smaller than the

astral dancer, and it can resist the attempt by succeed-

ing on an opposed Intelligence check against the astral

dancer. The astral dancer adds her class level to her roll

(if the target creature is also an astral dancer, it adds its

class level as well); if she wins, she moves into the targets

space, and the target moves into her now-vacated space.

The  movement  caused  by  this  ability  does  not  provoke

attacks of opportunity.

Lightning Speed (Ex): At 10th level, an astral dancers

ability to move through the Astral Plane with but a thought

becomes  so   nely  tuned  that  those  observing  her  cannot

react as she passes by. The characters movement while on

the Astral Plane (or a similar no-gravity environment) never

provokes attacks of opportunity.

Tatha the Astral Dancer

Disappointed with traditional githyanki fighting styles,

the monk Tatha sought a group of githyanki ascetics who

instructed  her  in  the  martial  arts.  But  even  that  had  its

limitations, and Tatha sought out a legendary sect of buom-

mans who incorporated the Astral Planes lack of gravity

into  the  practice.  She  joined  their  order,  becoming  an

astral dancer.

Still  Mind  (Ex):  Tatha  has  a  +2  bonus  on  saving  throws

against spells and effects of the enchantment school.

Ki Strike (Su): Tathas unarmed strikes are treated as magic

weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Relative  Altitude  (Ex):  While  on  the  Astral  Plane  (or  any

other plane or region without gravity), Tatha is always con-

sidered to have higher ground over her opponent and thus

gains a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls.

Psionics (Sp): 3/dayblur, daze (DC 9), dimension door, mage

hand, telekinesis (DC 14); 1/dayplane shift (DC 16). Caster

Evasion (Ex): While on a plane without gravity, if Tatha is

exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a

Re ex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage

with a successful saving throw.

Improved Maneuverability (Ex): When she makes a double

move  on  a  plane  with  the  no  gravity  trait  (such  as  the

Astral Plane), Tathas maneuverability drops to good (rather

than average). When she moves four times her speed on the

Astral  Plane  (running,  essentially),  her  maneuverability

drops to poor (rather than to clumsy).

eases. Magical and supernatural diseases still affect her.

ELEMENTAL WARRIOR

The elemental warrior sees that great strength comes from

focusing on the most basic aspects of reality. The sages say

that  the  worlds  are  formed  through  combinations  of   re,

water, earth, and air, and that any problem can be overcome

with the correct application of these forces. The elemental

warrior becomes attuned to one of these building blocks of

reality, channeling its power to great effect.

Fighters,  monks,  paladins,  and  barbarians  make  the

best  elemental  warriors.  This  prestige  class  is  focused

on fighting and applying the elements in just the right

way to bring down even the toughest adversary. Bards,

rogues, rangers, and druids also may find this class useful

if  they  often  find  themselves  involved  in  close  combat;

a  few  levels  of  elemental  warrior  give  them  access  to

a  range  of  weapons  and  defenses  that  will  make  them

much more versatile.

NPC elemental warriors are usually  ghters or mercenar-

ies of some sort. They may be of any alignment, but they all

believe that it is best to be prepared for anything and that

with the elements themselves at their  ngertips, they have

everything they need to overcome any foe.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become an elemental warrior, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skills: Knowledge (the planes) 5 ranks.

Special: The character must have traveled to at least one

of the Elemental Planes.

Class Skills

The elemental warriors class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha),

Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (the planes) (Int),

Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the elemental war-

rior prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  Elemental  warriors

gain no pro ciency with any weapon or armor.

Elemental  Affinity  (Ex):  An  elemental  warrior  is

attuned to one of the Elemental Planes, which imbues her

with certain related abilities. At 1st level, she selects one of

the  four  elements  (air,  earth,   re,  or  water)  as  the  one  for

which she has an af nity. She immediately gains the ability

to speak (and, if she is literate, to read and write) the lan-

guage associated with her chosen element (Auran, Terran,

Ignan, or Aquan, respectively). She also gains resistance 10

to  a  particular  energy  type  based  on  her  chosen  element

(electricity, acid,  re, or cold, respectively).

Elemental Manifestation (Su): An elemental warrior

of 2nd level or higher can use a standard action to cause

her body to manifest aspects of her chosen element. The

effect  lasts  for  1  minute  and  may  be  used  a  number  of

times per day equal to her class level. It can be dismissed

as a free action.

Air: Brisk winds whip around the elemental warriors body.

All ranged attacks against her have a 20% miss chance.

Earth: The elemental warriors skin is partially sheathed

in rocky hide. Her natural armor bonus increases by 3.

Fire:  A  sheath  of   ame  envelops  the  elemental  warrior.

Any opponent who lands a successful melee attack against

her takes 1d6 points of  re damage. Creatures wielding reach

weapons, such as longspears, do not take this damage.

Water:  The  elemental  warrior  becomes  coated  in  water.

She gains damage reduction 3/piercing.

Elemental  Weapon  (Su):  At  3rd  level  and  higher,  an

elemental warrior can, as a move action, imbue any melee

weapon she wields with the energy of her chosen element.

The  imbued  weapon  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of  energy

damage on each hit. The effect lasts for 1 minute and may be

dismissed as a free action. She can use this ability a number

of times per day equal to her class level.

If the weapon already has a magical effect that allows it to

deal energy damage, that effect is suppressed for the dura-

tion of the elemental weapon effect.

When an elemental warrior reaches 5th level, this abil-

ity improves. The extra damage remains the same, but on a

successful critical hit, the weapon releases a burst of energy

that deals even more energy damage of the same type (for a

total of 6d6). The additional damage is 4d6 points for weap-

ons  with  a  2  critical  multiplier,  6d6  points  for  weapons

with a 3 critical multiplier, or 8d6 for weapons with a 4

critical multiplier.

Elemental Movement (Su): At 4th level, an elemental

warrior  gains  a  special  movement  property  based  on  her

chosen element.

Air:  The  elemental  warrior  can   y  at  a  speed  of  20  feet

(perfect  maneuverability).  If  the  character  wears  medium

or heavy armor or carries a medium or heavy load, she cant

use this ability.

Earth: The elemental warrior gains a burrow speed of 30

feet (or equal to her base land speed, whichever is lower).

Fire: The elemental warriors base land speed increases by

10 feet. This bene t stacks with all other speed increases. If

the elemental warrior wears heavy armor or carries a heavy

load, she loses this bene t.

Water:  The  elemental  warrior  gains  a  swim  speed  of  30

feet (or equal to her base land speed, whichever is lower).

She also gains the ability to breathe water.

At 4th level, elemental warriors of all kinds also gain the

ability to use plane shift once per day to reach their chosen

Elemental Plane (or from that Elemental Plane to the Mate-

rial Plane).

Elemental Strike (Su): Once per day, a 5th-level elemen-

tal warrior can channel her chosen element to deal a dev-

astating melee touch attack. The attack requires a standard

action to deliver; if it hits, it affects its target as noted below.

No save is allowed against the damage dealt by the attack,

but a successful Fortitude save negates the secondary effect.

The save DC for these effects is 15 + the elemental warriors

Con modi er.

Air:  Target  takes  10d6  points  of  bludgeoning  damage

from a sudden gust of wind and is knocked prone (Fort save

negates knockdown).

Earth:  Target  takes  10d6  points  of  bludgeoning  damage

from the crushing touch attack and is pushed back 10 feet

as if bull rushed (Fort save negates push).

Fire: Target takes 10d6 points of  re damage and catches

on  re for 1d4 rounds (Fort save negates catching on  re).

Water: Target takes 10d6 points of damage as moisture is

drawn  from  its  body  and  becomes  nauseated  for  1  round

(Fort save negates nausea).

Este Thistleworn the Elemental Warrior

The adventures of Este Thistleworn took her through the

Elemental  Planes,  where  she  became  fascinated  with  the

destructive potential of the basic building blocks of reality.

After spending time learning about the nature of the mul-

tiverse and how to tap into the elemental powers, she began

to  use  the  principles  of  simplicity  and  opposition  during

combat. She has never been more effective than when she

feels connected to the elements.

n the markets of Sigil, equipment from myriad planes is

available  for  purchase.  What  might  be  a  commonplace

weapon in Ysgard may be a strange treasure worthy of a

premium on the battleplains of Avalas.

This chapter covers the mundane, exotic, and magical

merchandise  that  characters  with  access  to  the  planes

have  available  to  them  in  most  any  city  that  supports

planar trade.

noted in this chapter (or at least offers a lead on where

some  of  the  larger  vehicles  and  exotic  mounts  can  be

built or bought). Sigils markets are renowned, though

the goods to be had in the City of Brass, Tunarath, and

Union are hardly likely to be any less cosmopolitan.

See  Chapter  7:  Planar  Sites  for  more  information  on

these speci c planar metropolises.

AVAILABILITY

All the items described in this chapter are assumed to be

available to PCs who have the wherewithal to buy them. Of

course, most of these items have a planar source, so they

wont  be  found  in  the  shops  of  all  Material  Plane  cities.

But metropolises have some or all of the goods described

below, though characters may have to make special deals

or pay a premium price to a merchant who makes a spe-

cial  effort.  Alternatively,  sometimes  temporary  or  secret

portals between rural locations on the Material Plane and

other  planes  engender  low-level  trade,  putting  the  items

in this chapter on sale in otherwise unremarkable shops

or markets.

EQUIPMENT

The  following  section  describes  an  assortment

of  equipmentweapons,  armor,  tool  kits,  and

mountsthat  any  planar  adventurer  would  be

happy to own.

WEAPONS

A  characters  weapons  help  determine  how

capable he or she is in a variety of combat situ-

ations. The rules for weapon use, exotic weap-

ons, weapon categories, weapon qualities, and

so on are described in Chapter 7 of the Players

Handbook.

The  weapons  found  on  Table  41:  Weapons  (see

Away  from  the  Material  Plane,  almost  any  market  the

PCs stumble upon carries some or all of the merchandise

page 69) are described below, along with any spe-

cial options for their use.

67

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   67

5/20/04, 12:55:02 PM

Annulat: This exotic ranged weapon, invented by the

neraphim  (see  page  12),  appears  as  a  perfectly  circular,

nearly paper-thin hoop forged from a dark ironlike metal

and sharpened on the outside edge. The annulats diameter

is a little over 1 foot. The band of metal, while thin, measures

some 2 inches in breadth.

When  thrown,  an  annulat  sails  through  the  air  with

deadly  accuracy,  its  cross-section  so  thin  that  it  is  almost

invisible. Those pro cient with the annulat are particularly

accurate  with  the  throwing  hoop  and  can  make  it  curve

somewhat in  ight. Targets who gain a cover bonus to their

Armor Class have that bonus reduced by 2.

Neraphim treat the annulat as a martial weapon.

Gehennan Lancet: The lancet is somewhat similar to a

punching dagger, but it is weighted to deliver extra clout.

The lancet is a popular criminal weapon in the streets of the

Crawling City on Gehenna.

Heavy Sickle: This sickle, slightly larger than those gen-

erally used as weapons, enjoys popularity among the vicious

tie ings that make their home in the Abyss.

Jovar: Named for the layer of Celestia on which the city

of Yetsira sits, the exotic weapon known as a jovar is the

preferred weapon of the Heavenly Citys archon guards.

The greatswordlike weapon is weighted oddly, but in the

hands of a trained wielder, the blows landed with the blade

are more likely to deal considerable damage.

Muspelrule: Originally designed as a punishment rod

for Muspelheim  re giant children, this light, clublike shaft

is strong enough to be used as a weapon.

Ramhammer:  This  long-handled  hammer  is  an  exotic

weapon  favored  among  some  dwarves  of  Nidavellir,  the

third layer of Ysgard. It is treated as a melee weapon with

10-foot reach, though the wielder doesnt threaten the area

into which he can make an attack. Using a ramhammer pro-

vokes attacks of opportunity, just as if the wielder had used

a ranged weapon.

Because of the wide hammer head and the considerable

force a trained wielder can bring to bear using leverage,

its possible to make bull rush attacks with this weapon.

When  using  a  ramhammer,  a  wielder  does  not  have  to

enter his foes square (and thus does not provoke attacks

of opportunity for this move, though, as noted above, the

wielder  provokes  attacks  of  opportunity  from  adjacent

foes as if making a ranged attack). The wielder gains a +2

bonus  on  his  opposed  Strength  check  (see  the  rules  for

bull rush, page 154 of the Players Handbook). If the wielder

has  the  Improved  Bull  Rush  feat,  he  gains  the  noted  +4

bonus on his opposed Strength check (but the ability to

avoid attacks of opportunity for entering his foes square

is irrelevant).

Ripper: A favorite on many levels of the Abyss, a ripper

is a short-shafted spear with grooves in its head designed to

improve the penetration of the point.

Stabaxe: This weapon is similar to a handaxe, but the

blade is re ned to a longer, narrower, and straighter form

designed to achieve deeper penetration. It sees some use on

Avalas, the  rst layer of Acheron.

Straightblade: Unlike a standard short sword, a straight-

blade  is  wider  and  slightly  heavier,  making  it  an  ideal

slashing weapon. The straightblade is a favorite among the

citizens of the city of Dis.

ARMOR

The three new kinds of armor described here give charac-

ters even more choices when deciding how to protect them-

selves from the perils of the planes.

SPECIAL WEAPON MATERIAL:

ABYSSAL BLOODIRON

In  the  Abyss,  cataclysmic  battles  have  raged  for  eons,  laying

down  a  sediment  of  iron,  blood,  and  spent  magic.  Abyssal

bloodiron is mined from thin deposits of mixed blood and fer-

rous mineral, compacted over the years, then forged at a low

temperature to preserve its innate powers. Weapons forged of

the  metal  usually  appear  dark  except  for  their  cutting  edges,

which are as red as freshly spilled blood.

A weapon forged of Abyssal bloodiron is treated as a cold

iron  weapon  (see  page  284  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide),

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

except that its wielder gains a +4 bonus when rolling to confirm

a critical hit.

Abyssal  bloodiron  has  the  same  weight  as  iron  or  steel.  A

weapon made of Abyssal bloodiron costs an additional 10,000

gp,  and  any  magical  enhancements  cost  an  additional  2,000

gp, just as with cold iron. (The price includes 300 gp for the

masterwork component.)

Abyssal bloodiron has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per inch

of thickness.

Mechanus gear

Hooked armor

Sectioned armor

Hooked Armor: This leather armor is festooned with

multiple  hooks  and  cleats.  These  gripping  protrusions

grant  the  wearer  a  +5  bonus  on  Climb  checks.  (Due  to

the armors 2 armor check penalty, the effective bonus

is +3.)

Mechanus Gear: This heavy armor is composed of mul-

tiple gears, cogs, plates, and other metal mechanical contrap-

tions. It grants an armor bonus superior to all other armors,

but it reduces the wearers speed more than other types of

heavy armor do.

Sectioned  Armor:  The  owner  of  this  specially  con-

structed masterwork full plate can remove several of the

large  plate  sections  from  it,  reducing  it  to  medium  or

light armor, so that he or she can sleep more comfortably

or move more freely while retaining some of the armors

defensive bonus.

GOODS AND SERVICES

Heroes need more than just weapons and armor, especially

when they seek adventure on the planes. In order to increase

their chances for survival, they also need adventuring gear,

specialized tools for their character classes, mounts, vehi-

cles, hired passage, and special substances and items.

Adventuring Gear

Just as adventurers on the Material Plane need specialized

gear to face the challenges and dif culties they encounter,

planar travelers need equipment devised with the rigors of

planar adventure in mind. The basic gear below is aimed at

general  utility;  it  doesnt  matter  what  skills  or  classes  the

user possesses.

Ether Harness: Designed after harnesses used by bur-

glars for breaking into homes, the ether harness is simply

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

SPECIAL ARMOR MATERIAL: ASTRAL DRIFTMETAL

This extraordinarily rare mineral is mined only on Tunarath

and  other  islands  of  matter  floating  in  the  Astral  Plane.  It

is  very  similar  to  iron  but  has  a  single  remarkable  feature.

Armor crafted from astral driftmetal is fully effective against

incorporeal attacks, as if it were made of force. The armors

full armor bonus to Armor Class (including any enhancement

bonus)  applies  to  the  wearers  touch  Armor  Class  against

incorporeal attacks.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

A suit of driftmetal armor weighs the same as a suit of armor

made of steel. Other statistics of the armor (maximum Dexter-

ity bonus, armor check penalty, and arcane spell failure chance)

are unchanged.

Astral driftmetal is not malleable enough to be worked into

chainmail or scale mail; only a breastplate, shield, or any form

of heavy armor can be made from it.

Astral driftmetal has hardness 12 and 30 hit points per inch

of thickness. Its market price modifier is +12,000 gp.

a network of leather straps  tted with metal rings for tying

items down. It is meant to ensure that a group of ethereal

travelers caught in an ether cyclone remain together, rather

than  being  scattered  across  the  planes.  Tying  travelers

together by means of their ether harnesses grants a +2 cir-

cumstance bonus on Use Rope checks made to ensure that

the knots do not come untied.

Fireproof  Parchment:  Not  strictly  parchment,  this

writing  material  is  made  of  hide  from  animals  found

on  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Fire,  and  it  retains  the  crea-

tures immunity to fire. Thus, fireproof parchment does

not catch fire when exposed to a fire-dominant plane or

environment.

Fireproof  Clothing:  As  with  fireproof  parchment,

this clothing is made from the hides of animals that have

natural immunity to  re, making the clothing safe to wear

in  re-dominant environments. Any style of clothing can

be made from the material; the cost simply increases by

50 gp.

Gravity Tent: Designed for use on planes that have no

gravity, a gravity tent is merely a tent in the shape of a dia-

mond, with loops and clips inside to hold bedrolls in a more

or less stable position (secured to the tents cross-poles). It

sleeps up to four comfortably, and up to eight total.

Waterproof  Ink:  Because  ordinary  ink  smears  and

runs when it comes in contact with water, this ink

actually a mixture of grease, wax, and pigmentsis quite

useful  for  making  maps  and  other  writings  in  water-

dominant planes.

Weight Suit: A weight suit is a collection of straps and

pouches containing lead pellets. When the complete suit is

worn, it distributes extra weight across the wearers body,

counteracting the skill check and attack roll penalties of

light-gravity environments (because the weight is distrib-

uted, rather than concentrated in one place, such as with a

backpack). In environments with normal gravity, the suit

is  little  more  than  a  curiosity,  except  to  certain  physical

 tness fanatics.

Class Tools

Much of the following equipment is particularly useful to

characters who spend time in otherworldly environments.

Differential Hourglass: Because time can  ow at differ-

ent rates on different planes, it can sometimes help planar

travelers to know how much time is passing on other planes.

A differential hourglass consists of two hourglassesone

large,  one  smallmounted  end  to  end.  The  substance

inside  each  hourglass  ows at the same speed, but  one of

the hourglasses measures the passage of local time, and the

other measures the passage of remote time. Differential

hourglasses are usually built with a speci c pair of planes

in mind, and as such are rather useless for any other pur-

pose. Depending on the difference between the two planes

in question, the smaller hourglass could measure seconds,

rounds, minutes, hours, or days, while the larger of the two

could measure rounds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even

some longer period, depending on the time differential

between the two planes.

Fireproof  Spellbook:  With  pages  made  of  fireproof

parchment  (see  Adventuring  Gear,  above),  covered  in

leather made from  re-resistant animals, and bound with

steel, a  reproof spellbook does not catch  re when exposed

to a  re-dominant plane or environment.

Planar Atlas: Countless versions of these handy tomes

exist, each of which is meant to describe the relationships

between  various  planes  for  the  convenience  of  travelers.

They  are  rarely  accurate  when  it  comes  to  detailing  the

locations of planar portals (or the instructions for how to

activate them), but the information on the planes grants a

+2 competence bonus on Knowledge (the planes) checks.

True  Divine  Focus:  Druids  use  sprigs  of  holly  and

mistletoe  as  the  default  divine  focus  for  their  spells,  and

these  come  directly  from  the  home  plane  of  the  druids

deity. Imbued with the raw power of nature, these divine

cuttings increase the druids effective caster level by 1 for

purposes  of  determining  level-dependent  spell  variables

(such as damage or range) and for caster level checks. The

cuttings last for one week.

True  Holy  Symbol:  Appearing  in  all  other  ways  to

be  merely  a  holy  symbol,  this  item  in  fact  comes  from

the home plane of the deity the symbol representsand

carries with it a modicum of the deitys power. Attempts

to  turn  undead  using  the  true  holy  symbol  provide  a  +2

sacred bonus on the characters turning check (1d20 + the

characters Cha modi er).

True Unholy Symbol: The evil counterpart to the true

holy symbol, this otherwise unremarkable ornament con-

fers a +2 profane bonus on the wielders attempts to rebuke,

command,  or  bolster  undead,  or  to  dispel  a  good  clerics

turning effect.

Waterproof  Spellbook:  Utilizing  waterproof  ink  and

pages sealed in paraf n, this spellbook can survive being

immersed in wateran extremely useful item for a wizard

journeying to a water-dominant plane.

MOUNTS AND VEHICLES

A  number  of  different  conveyances  existsome  of  them

creatures, some of them machines or devicesthat can

ease the task of traveling between planes or moving through

a plane.

Mounts

Common mounts such as horses allow a character to travel

faster and more easily. Plane-hopping mounts allow a char-

acter to do the same, but without the wall between dimen-

sions posing a restriction.

Chapter 6: Creatures of the Planes contains more informa-

tion about these planar mounts.

Elsewhale:  Not  traditional  mounts,  elsewhales  are

related to seagoing whales. An elsewhale has the ability to

slip between planes, as long as the original plane and the

destination  plane  have  suitable  bodies  of  water  in  which

the elsewhale can swim.

Travelers do not ride on elsewhales; they ride within,

in  the  creatures  mouth.  The  mouth  cavity  of  an  adult

elsewhale is large enough to hold 1 Large, 4 Medium, or

16  Small  creatures  in  the  dark,  cramped,  and  somewhat

moist environment.

A  stable  housing  even

a  single  elsewhale  requires

access to the sea or ocean.

Gaspar: Though these crea-

tures  are  dif cult  to  acquire

and train, their size and stur-

diness  make  the  time  and

expense worthwhile.

Nightmare,  Lesser:

A  nightmare  is  a

horse like  creature

of  evil;  a  good-

aligned  owner  who

makes  an  investment

in  a  lesser  nightmare

soon  discovers  that  the

mount  does  not  serve

him  and  escapes  at

the  first  opportunity.

Lesser  nightmares  are

bred  from  their  more

powerful  brethren.

Not  as  headstrong

or  as  capable  of  traveling

between  the  planes  at  will,

a  lesser  nightmare  still  can  carry  its  pas-

senger into other dimensions.

UrEpona: A variety of planar horse, an

urEpona makes the perfect mount, though domesticating

one of these wild creatures is a difficult task. However,

few creatures are better suited for taking riders between

the planes.

Vehicles

Why settle for a chariot when you can purchase an ethereal

tunneler or a gate zeppelin? By using the vehicles described

here, characters can go anywhereassuming they have the

cash to pay for such an extravagance.

Refer to the sidebar in this section for details

on how to read a vehicles statistics block.

Astral  Skiff:  Huge  vehicle;  Pro-

fession  (sailor)  +0;  Spd  fly  120  ft.

(average); Overall AC 3; Section hp 40

(hardness  10);  Section  AC  3;  Ram  4d8;

Face 15 ft. by 5 ft.; Height 10 ft.; SA ram-

ming;  Crew  1  (carries  3);  Cargo  1  ton

(Spd 100 ft. if carrying 1/2 ton or more);

Cost 10,000 gp.

On  the  Astral  Plane,  githyanki

commonly  wage  war  from  astral

ships. Such vessels range in size

from  those  large  enough  for  a

single squad of soldiers (the astral

skiff )  to  those  far  larger.

Powered  by  magic  sails  that

catch the motion of astral

energies,  these  ships  are

normally useless on the Material

Plane, where no such arcane winds

blow.  However,  the  vehicle  is  ideal

for  journeys  on  the  in nite  Astral

Plane itself.

Ethereal Tunneler: Huge vehicle;

Profession  (miner)  +4;  Spd  burrow  10

ft.  (clumsy);  Overall  AC  3;  Section  hp

40/120  (hardness  20/5);  Section  AC  3;

Ram 10d6; Face 10 ft. by 20 ft.; Height 10

ft.; SA ramming; SQ steering mechanism

triggers  ethereal  jaunt  on  vehicle  and  all

passengers 1/day for up to 20 rounds; Crew 5

(plus 10 soldiers); Cost 140,000 gp.

This tanklike vehicle slowly digs tunnels through earth

and when solid stone stymies it, the vehicle can brie y shift

into the Ethereal Plane. When not tunneling into other-

wise sealed regions of earth or past undefeatable defenses,

an ethereal tunneler can be used for outright warfare. The

vehicle is adamantine-armored and large enough to accom-

modate a squad of 10 soldiers. Its treads have been magi-

cally animated to provide propulsion at the direction of the

crew, who pull levers while they watch the earth for signs

of cave-ins. The massive drill at the front is better than a

ramming  prow;  an  ethereal  tunneler  never  takes  damage

from rams it initiates.

Gate Zeppelin: Colossal vehicle; Profession (pilot) 4;

Spd  y 40 ft. (nautical average); Overall AC 3; Section hp

30 (hardness 5); Section AC 3; Rigging 200 hp (hardness 0),

AC 1; Ram 4d6; Face 40 ft. by 10 ft.; Height 10 ft; SA ram-

ming; SQ steering mechanism triggers gate 1/day through

which zeppelin may pass (after which the gate closes); Crew

10; Cargo 10 tons (Spd 20 ft. if carrying 5 tons or more); Cost

160,000 gp.

A zeppelin relies on hot air trapped in a massive balloon

for lift and animated propellers for propulsion. The balloon

that  provides  lift  is  segmented  so  that  one  puncture  isnt

disastrous.  Zeppelins  have  no  minimum  forward  speed,

and they can hover.

A mechanism in the captains cabin can trigger a gate-like

opening once per day that allows planar travel.

Living Astral Ship: CR ; Colossal construct; HD 8d10

+1d10 per 10 feet of length; Init as the pilot  4; Spd as the

pilot (+30 ft. with psychic sails) on the Astral Plane,  y 50

ft. (poor) in a gravity well; AC varies (8 size, +1 natural

per  HD);  Atk  as  cleric  of  level  equal  to  the  ships  HD;

Space/Reach  30  ft./10  ft.  (or  as  ram);  SA  ram,  mounted

weapons;  SQ  construct  traits,  hardness;  AL  n/a;  SV  as

commoner of level equal to the ships HD, with no ability

score modi ers.

Construct  Traits:  Like  most  constructs,  living  astral

ships have immunity to mind-affecting spells and abili-

ties, poison, disease, and similar effects. They are not sub-

ject to extra damage from critical hits, nonlethal damage,

ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or death from

massive damage.

Hardness: A living astral ship is usually composed of dif-

ferent materials but has an overall hardness of 5 to 10. An

astral ship composed mainly of wood might have hardness

5, while an astral ship made of iron would have hardness 10.

See Smashing an Object, page 165 of the Players Handbook,

for more information on hardness.

Mounted Weapons: A living astral ship can be  tted with

heavy catapults, light catapults, and ballistas (see Siege Engines,

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

THE VEHICLE STATISTICS BLOCK

Each vehicle description contains a standard statistics block.

(The living astral ship is an exception, since it is a creature rather

than an object.) Following is an explanation of the statistics

blocks components.

Size: The size of the vehicle, using the same size categories

as for creatures.

Skill: Which skill governs control checks, followed by a cir-

cumstance bonus or penalty based on the overall quality of

the vehicle.

Spd: The vehicles maximum speed in a single move. For

wind-powered vehicles such as sailing ships, maximum speed

takes  into  account  the  velocity  of  the  wind.  For  example,  the

speed of a planar sailer is given as wind  20 ft. In a calm wind

(0 mph; speed multiplier  0), a planar sailer cant move; in a

light wind (110 mph; speed multiplier  1), a planar sailers

speed is 20 feet; in a moderate wind (1120 mph; speed mul-

tiplier  2), its speed is 40 feet; in a heavy wind (2130 mph;

speed multiplier  3), its speed is 60 feet; and at higher wind

speeds (31+ mph), the planar sailer cant sail.

A  wind-powered  vehicle  moves  at  half  speed  if  its  head-

ing into the wind (within 90 degrees of the wind direction).

It moves at double speed if its heading away from the wind

(within 90 degrees).

Vehicles generally take a double move. They can also move

at  any  slower  speed  unless  noted  otherwise.  The  vehicles

maneuverability is noted in parentheses.

Vehicles turn using the rules for aerial maneuverability. The

planar sailer and gate zeppelin have a maneuverability of nauti-

cal average, which means they can make a 45-degree turn every

60 feet.

Overall AC: The Armor Class of the vehicle as a whole. For

bigger vehicles, this number is rarely used because attacks

target specific sections of the vehicle exterior.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Section  hp:  How  many  hit  points  each  10-foot-by-10-foot

section has. Most sections also have hardness, noted in paren-

theses. If the vehicle has armor plating, the section hit points

and hardness of the armor are given first, followed by a slash,

followed by the section hit points and hardness of the vehicle

itself. Large or smaller vehicles do not have sections and lack a

section hit points statistic.

Section AC: The Armor Class of each 10-foot-by-10-foot sec-

tion of the vehicles exterior.

Rigging:  The  hit  points,  hardness,  and  Armor  Class  of  the

vehicles sails, masts, and control lines, if any. If a vehicle lacks

rigging, this statistic is omitted. For zeppelins, the rigging sta-

tistic represents the durability of the balloon.

Ram: The damage dealt by the vehicle if it rams another object

at maximum speed.

Face: The size of the vehicle, given as length by width.

Height: The vehicles height, not including rigging, mea-

sured from the ground to the roof (for a land or air vehicle)

or  the  waterline  to  the  deck  (for  a  water  vehicle).  Sailing

ships  also  have  a  draft  depth  given  in  parentheses,  which

represents the minimum depth of water they need to avoid

running aground.

SA: Any special attacks, such as a ramming prow.

SQ: Any special qualities, such as resistances.

Crew:  How  many  individuals  are  required  to  operate  the

vehicle  safely.  Unless  noted  otherwise,  one  must  be  a  skilled

driver, but the others can be unskilled.

Cargo: The capacity of the vehicles hold, in tons (one ton

equals 2,000 pounds). If the weight of cargo affects the vehicles

speed, the change in speed is noted in parentheses.

Cost: The vehicles cost, in gold pieces.

page  99  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  for  statistics).  An

astral  ship  can  have  one  mounted  weapon  for  every  2

Hit  Dice  it  possesses,  although  nonmilitary  astral  ships

typically forgo a full array of weapons in favor of having

cargo space. A heavy catapult counts as two weapons for

the purpose of determining how many weapons an astral

ship can carry.

Ram (Ex): In any round in which no ship-mounted weap-

ons are  red, a living astral ship can ram a Huge or larger

creature or object. If the prow of the astral ship is more than

50 feet away in a straight line from a target, it can move up

to double its speed to deliver a ram attack using its regular

attack bonus. The ram deals either bludgeoning or piercing

damage, depending on the shape of its prow. The damage

dealt is 1d10 points per point of the astral ships hardness.

For example, an astral ship with hardness 10 deals 10d10

points  of  damage  with  a  successful  ram  attack,  or  triple

damage on a critical hit (threat range 20).

Building a living astral ship requires the Craft Construct

feat and 10 ranks in Knowledge (the planes). Flying the

ship  requires  the  pilot  (who  must  have  an  Intelligence

score  of  1  or  higher)  to  sit  in  a  specially  attuned  chair

called a helm. The helm allows the pilot to propel the ship

by thought at a speed (in feet) equal to 10 times the pilots

Intelligence score. When the ship passes within a gravity

well, such as that generated by a large chunk of drifting

matter, it slows to a speed of 50 feet. A living astral ship

can  move  at  double  speed  and  running  speed.  Piloting

the ship is always considered a full-round action, and the

pilot cannot engage in other activities while controlling

the ship.

A pilot seated in the helm receives a 360-degree mental

picture of the area around the ship, out to normal visibility

range. The pilot feels as if he or she is  ying directly over the

ship and able to look in all directions at once.

The helm radiates strong transmutation magic under the

scrutiny of detect magic. It serves as a conduit between the

pilot and the vessel and is rooted to the ship. Destroying any

part of it (the seat itself or the parts connecting it to the rest

of the ship) renders the vessel powerless and inert. A helm

has the same hardness as the rest of the astral ship and hit

points equal to three times the ships hardness.

Rarely sold on the open market, living astral ships can  nd

their way into someones hands by theft or other means.

Planar  Sailer:  Colossal  vehicle;  Profession  (sailor)  +4;

Spd wind  20 ft. (nautical average); Overall AC 3; Section

hp 50 (hardness 5); Section AC 3; Rigging 80 hp (hard-

ness 0), AC 1; Ram 12d6; Face 80 ft. by 20 ft.; Height 10

ft. (draft 10 ft.); SA ram; SQ steering mechanism triggers

special plane shift effect on vehicle and contents; Crew 20;

Cargo 150 tons (Spd wind  15 ft. if 75 tons or more); Cost

25,000 gp.

In most situations, a planar sailer seems no different from

a common sailing ship. Measuring some 80 feet in length,

this three-masted ship requires a crew of 20 when sailing

on water and using the wind for locomotion. A planar sailer

has a special ability that allows it to sail celestial seas, follow-

ing the commands of the captain of the vessel as he stands

at the wheel. A planar sailer has enough room on deck for

two light catapults or ballistas. It usually uses a launch as a

lifeboat (not included in the price).

Hired Passage

Sometimes, the best way to get from here to there is to hire

someone  else  to  take  you.  Since  the  player  characters  are

adventurers, such solutions should be the exception rather

than the rule, but at times the PCs might prefer to use their

monetary resources to advance their agenda.

Cubic Gate: Occasionally, a group or individual will offer

transport via a cubic gate. These conduits often lead from one

well-guarded location in a planar metropolis to a sheltered

or protected spot in the same or another metropolis.

Passage:  Ships  (and  elsewhales)  that  provide  passage

to alternate planes usually do not specialize in passenger

service.  However,  they  may  have  a  regular  planar  trade

route on which they are willing to take on passengers in

order  to  supplement  their  income.  Thus,  although  PCs

might  not  often  find  passage  directly  to  the  plane  they

are seeking, they may be able to ride on a planar ship for

one leg of the journey.

Planar Allies: The planar ally spells are common ways to

secure travel. Many outsiders have planar travel capabilities

either because of spell-like abilities or spellcasting talents.

Most are willing to offer the service. A planar ally naturally

prefers to bring passengers to a plane that corresponds to its

philosophical viewpoint, but one might happily transport

a person or group to an opposing plane if doing so furthers

one of its causes.

Planar Guide: Certain people have a knack for  nding

the cracks and chinks between planar borders. They know

the  portals,  the  vortices,  the  trade  routes,  and  the  other

means for traveling the planes that dont involve spells or

other magic. Finding a guide is the hard part; after that, a

guide worth her salt can lead a party to a plane she claims as

her specialty in 2d6 days, or refer the PCs to another guide

if  the  plane  they  seek  falls  outside  her  knowledge.  Most

guides claim a specialty in the connections between only

three to four planes.

Planar Ring Gates: Some enterprising wealthy mer-

chant  guilds  or  consortiums  have  established  pairings  of

planar ring gates. These lead from one well-guarded loca-

tion  in  a  planar  metropolis  to  a  similarly  protected  spot

in another. On occasion, the owner of a pair of planar ring

gates may move them to a requested location, provided that

the task is easily done and that the new environment is

safe. The larger the risk, the larger the cost.

Spellcasting: Sometimes the easiest way to reach a planar

destination is to pay someone to cast either a gate spell or a

plane shift spell.

SPECIAL SUBSTANCES AND ITEMS

The  special  substances  described  here  are  prized  by

adventurers both planar and mundane. Most of them can

be made with the Craft (alchemy) skill, but require ingre-

dients not available on the Material Plane. Others cant be

made at all, but must be recovered from their native envi-

ronment or purchased.

Anarchic Water: Anarchic water damages lawful out-

siders almost as if it were acid. A flask of anarchic water

can be thrown as a splash weapon (see the Throw Splash

Weapon  sidebar).  Treat  this  attack  as  a  ranged  touch

attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks

if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to

use  it  against  an  incorporeal  creature,  the  bearer  must

open the flask and pour the anarchic water out onto the

target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal crea-

ture with anarchic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing

so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks

of opportunity.

A direct hit by a  ask of anarchic water deals 2d4 points

of damage to a lawful outsider. Each such creature within 5

feet of the point where the  ask hits takes 1 point of damage

from the splash.

Antitrait  Grease:  Antitrait  grease  is  made  in  four

varietiesevil,  law,  chaos,  and  goodusing  essences

collected from planes on the opposite side of the Great

Wheel  to  help  moderate  the  effects  of  the  opposing

alignment. When visiting a plane that is aligned, those

who smear on antitrait grease ignore penalties on their

Charisma checks that mildly aligned planes impose on

visitors of opposed alignments. One vial of grease pro-

tects a visitor for 1 hour. The Wisdom and Intelligence

check penalties associated with strongly aligned planes

are not affected.

Atramen Oil: This substance is cold pressed from atra-

men  fruit  that  grows  on  shoals  of  Elemental  Earth  that

have drifted too close to the Negative Energy Plane. A  ask

of atramen oil can be thrown as a splash weapon (see the

Throw Splash Weapon sidebar). Treat this attack as a ranged

touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit

causes the target to take a 4 penalty on Fortitude saves

for  1  minute.  Every  creature  within  5  feet  of  the  point

where the  ask hits takes a 1 penalty on Fortitude saves

for 1 minute.

Axiomatic  Water:  Axiomatic  water  damages  chaotic

outsiders  almost  as  if  it  were  acid.  A  flask  of  axiomatic

water can be thrown as a splash weapon (see the Throw

Splash Weapon sidebar). Treat this attack as a ranged touch

attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks

if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to

use  it  against  an  incorporeal  creature,  the  bearer  must

open  the  flask  and  pour  the  axiomatic  water  out  onto

the  target.  Thus,  a  character  can  douse  an  incorporeal

creature with axiomatic water only if he is adjacent to it.

Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke

attacks of opportunity.

A direct hit by a  ask of axiomatic water deals 2d4 points

of damage to a chaotic outsider. Each such creature within 5

feet of the point where the  ask hits takes 1 point of damage

from the splash.

Bahamuts  Breath:  Bahamuts  breath  damages  evil

outsiders almost as if it were acid, while at the same time,

it heals good outsiders as if it were a potion of cure light

wounds. One ingredient for this alchemical substance is

a breath of air gathered from any of the four lowest levels

of Celestia.

A  ask of Bahamuts breath can be thrown as a splash

weapon (see the Throw Splash Weapon sidebar). Treat this

attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of

10 feet. A direct hit by a  ask deals 2d4 points of damage

to an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the

point where the  ask hits takes 1 point of damage from

the  splash.  A  direct  hit  by  the   ask  heals  2d4  points  of

damage to a good outsider. Each such creature within 5

feet of the point where the  ask hits is cured of 1 point of

damage from the splash.

Celestial Cloak: Planar hunters frequently visit the Wil-

derness of the Beastlands to slay and skin celestial animals,

for, when the beasts are slain on their home plane and their

hides  properly  treated,  some  of  their  properties  reside  in

their pelts. A celestial cloak looks much like an ordinary

cloak made of fur from the appropriate animal, but it has a

golden sheen that is especially evident when viewed under

the noonday sun or in the light of the full moon.

When worn, a celestial cloak confers upon its wearer resis-

tance to acid 1, cold 1, and electricity 1. This resistance does

not stack with similar bene ts gained from other sources.

Chaos Flask: A chaos flask contains a small amount

of the raw stuff of the plane of Limbo. This material can

be shaped by someone with a strong enough will (DC 13

Wisdom check) into nearly any single nonmagical object,

provided the total volume is no greater than that of the

 asks  contentswith  denser  objects  requiring  more  of

the material. A  ask contains enough raw chaos to create

a Diminutive metal or stone object, a Tiny wooden object,

or  a  Small  cloth  or  leather  object.  The  user  can  even

shape  the  matter  into  a  living  creature  of  Diminutive

size or smaller, but doing this raises the Wisdom check

DC to 18.

Shaping the Limbo matter is a free action, and the user

can attempt the Wisdom check once per round. The item

so shaped persists for a number of rounds equal to the users

Wisdom  score,  and  then  dissipates  into  nothingness.  The

user can cause the object to dissipate sooner with another

Wisdom check (same DC).

Elemental  Loadstone:  Although  it  appears  to  be  an

ordinary stone about the size of a sling stone, an elemental

loadstone is, in fact, extremely dense, weighing around 50

pounds. A loadstone can be thrown (with a range increment

of 5 feet) or  red from a sling (with a range increment of 10

feet) and deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage on a suc-

cessful hit. In addition, some particularly muscular rogues

have  developed  an  interesting  tactic:  slipping  elemental

loadstones into the pockets of physically weaker opponents

by means of Sleight of Hand checks. With enough of these

on his person, the average wizard or sorcerer can quickly be

rendered immobile.

Liquid  Embers:  Liquid  embers  is  a  sticky  adhesive

goo  not  unlike  alchemists   re,  except  that  liquid  embers

contains ash or soot of an object burned with  re from the

Elemental  Plane  of  Fire.  A   ask  of  liquid  embers  can  be

thrown as a splash weapon (see the Throw Splash Weapon

sidebar).  Treat  this  attack  as  a  ranged  touch  attack  with  a

range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 3d6 points of

 re damage. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where

the   ask  hits  takes  1d6  points  of   re  damage  from  the

splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes

an additional 3d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can

use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the  ames

before  taking  this  additional  damage.  Extinguishing  the

 ames requires a DC 17 Re ex save. Rolling on the ground

provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a

lake  or  magically  extinguishing  the   ames  automatically

smothers the  re.

THROW SPLASH WEAPON

Splash weapons, described on page 158 of the Players Handbook,

can  be  slightly  more  complicated  to  use  on  other  planes.  In

order to be effective, a splash weapon must impact a solid sur-

face in order to breakbut many planes have abnormal gravity

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

or little in the way of terrain. In such environments, targeting a

specific grid intersection or missing a target may not produce

any results. A flask will simply continue along the path it was

thrown until it collides with something, often far away.

5/20/04, 12:55:41 PM

Mechanus  Eye:  This  2-inch-diameter  metallic  orb

resembles  an  eye,  though  streamlined  and  idealized.

These  eyes  are  purportedly  salvaged  from  secret  grave-

yard  cogs  on  Mechanus,  where  a  demolished  race  who

once claimed the plane now lies forgotten. Anyone look-

ing through a Mechanus eye gains a +1 competence bonus

on Search checks.

Ocanthus Knife: Ocanthus knives are actually alchem-

ically  stabilized  shards  of  magically  charged  black  ice

gathered from the fourth layer of Acheron. An ocanthus

knife  has  all  the  melee  weapon  characteristics

of a dagger, except for the following: On a suc-

cessful strike, a Medium ocanthus knife deals

2d6  points  of  damage  (a  Small  knife  deals

1d8, and a Large knife deals 3d6). After

striking  a  foe,  the  knife  loses  its

stability and immediately shatters

and  melts,  gone  but  for  telltale

oily residue.

Pure Element: Each  ask of

pure  element  contains  a  small

amount  of  the  essence  of  an

Elemental Plane: air, earth,  re,

or  water,  painstakingly  recre-

ated  from  ancient  alchemical

formulas.  The  bearer  can  pour

this  substance  upon  other  beings

or  objects  by  making  a  melee  touch

attack  (which  provokes  atacks  of

opportunity), or hurl it as a thrown

weapon  that  targets  a  creature.  The

pure element air, earth,  re, or water

contained  within  then  bonds  with

whatever  it  touches,  temporarily

altering  the  target  in  a  fashion

dependent  on  the  elements

nature.  The  effects  of  the  pure

element  last  for  10  minutes,

unless otherwise noted.

Air: This clear liquid does not seem

to  ow from the  ask as much drift from

it.  Objects  or  creatures  exposed  to  pure  ele-

ment air weigh only one-half their normal weight; creatures

so affected gain a +2 bonus on Climb and Jump checks but

take a 2 penalty on damage rolls.

Elementals with the air subtype that are exposed to this

pure element gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution.

Elementals with the earth subtype, as well as objects made

of earth or stone, take 2d6 points of damage (this effect over-

comes the damage reduction or hardness of such creatures

or objects).

Earth:  This  grayish-brown  ooze  looks  like  ordinary

mud. Objects or creatures exposed to pure elemental earth

weigh  twice  their  normal  weight;  creatures  so  affected

take a 2 penalty on Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim,

and Tumble checks. The creature also gains damage reduc-

tion 1/adamantine.

Elementals  with  the  earth  subtype  that  are  exposed  to

this  pure  element  gain  a  +2  enhancement  bonus  to  Con-

stitution. Elementals with the air subtype take 2d6 points

of damage (this effect overcomes the damage reduction of

such creatures).

Fire:  This  bright  orange-yellow  liquid  bursts  from  the

 ask  like  an  explosion.  A  creature  or  object  exposed  to

pure elemental  re takes 1d6 points of damage and catches

 re  unless  it  succeeds  on  a  DC  15  Re ex  save.

A creature or object that catches  re takes 1d6

points of  re damage per round for 5 rounds.

The   ames  may  be  extinguished  only  by

exposure to pure elemental water.

Elementals  with  the   re  subtype

that are exposed to this pure element

gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Con-

stitution. Elementals with the water

subtype  take  double  the  initial   re

damage dealt by this substance, but

do  not  catch  on   re  unless  they  are

wearing  ammable items.

Water: This liquid appears to be a

deep blue, almost indigo water. Living

creatures  exposed  to  pure  elemental

water  must  make  a  DC  10  Constitution

check  or  begin  drowning.  Each  round

thereafter until 1 minute has elapsed,

the DC increases by 1.

Elementals  with  the  water  subtype

that  are  exposed  to  this  pure  element

gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Con-

stitution. Elementals with the  re sub-

type take 2d6 points of damage.

Red  Tidewater:  Harvested  from

areas of red tide on the Elemen-

tal  Plane  of  Water,  this  water

is full of an algae that can cause

temporary  blindness  if  it  gets  into

a living creatures eyes. A  ask of red tide-

water  can  be  thrown  as  a  splash  weapon  (see

the  Throw  Splash  Weapon  sidebar).  Treat  this  attack  as  a

ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.

A direct hit forces the target to make a DC 15 Re ex save

or be blinded for 2d4 rounds. All those within 5 feet of the

point of impact must make a DC 10 Re ex save or be blinded

for  1  round.  Anyone  who  fails  the  save  has  been  exposed

to blinding sickness (see Disease, page 292 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Touchstone  Blade:  A  touchstone  blade  is  a  nonmagi-

cal masterwork sword or other weapon forged from metal

found at the site of a planar touchstonethus qualifying

it as the portable object required by the Planar Touchstone

feat.  The  cost  of  a  touchstone  blade  is  equal  to  the  cost

MAGIC ITEMS

In addition to the magic items presented in the Dungeon

Masters Guide, the following magic items can be found in a

planar campaign or in the possession of creatures who have

visited the planes.

ARMOR AND SHIELDS

Some  of  the  armor  and  shield  special  abilities  described

Special Ability Descriptions

Aquan:  An  aquan  weapon  is  imbued  with  the

water-dominant  planar  trait.  This  power  grants

the  weapon  the  ability  to  overcome  the  damage

reduction  of  any  creature  with  the  fire  subtype

(regardless of what the damage reduction normally

speci es).  It  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of  damage

against  creatures  with  the   re  subtype.  It  bestows

one negative level on any  re creature attempting

to  wield  it.  The  negative  level  remains  as  long  as

the  weapon  is  in  hand  and  disappears  when  the

weapon  is  no  longer  wielded.  This  negative  level

never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be

overcome in any way (including restoration spells)

while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and

slings  so  crafted  bestow  the  aquan  special  ability

upon their ammunition.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  7th;  Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, creator must be of the water subtype;

Price +2 bonus.

Auran: An auran weapon is imbued with the air-

dominant planar trait. This power grants the weapon

the ability to overcome the damage reduction of any

creature with the earth subtype (regardless of what

the  damage  reduction  normally  speci es).  It  deals

an extra 2d6 points of damage against creatures with

the  earth  subtype.  It  bestows  one  negative  level  on  any

earth creature attempting to wield it. The negative level

remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears

when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level

never  results  in  actual  level  loss,  but  it  cannot  be

overcome in any way (including restoration spells)

while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and

slings  so  crafted  bestow  the  auran  special  ability  upon

their ammunition.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

creator must be of the air subtype; Price +2 bonus.

Consumptive: Upon command, a consumptive weapon

is sheathed in light-sucking negative energy. The energy

does  not  harm  the  wielder.  The  effect  remains  until

another command is given. A consumptive weapon deals

an extra 1d6 points of damage on a successful hit. Bows,

crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the energy upon

their ammunition.

Moderate  necromancy;  CL  7th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, enervation; Price +2 bonus.

Consumptive  Burst:  A  consumptive  burst  weapon

functions as a consumptive weapon that also flares with

excess negative energy upon striking a successful criti-

cal hit. The negative energy does not harm the wielder.

In  addition  to  the  extra  negative  energy  damage  from

the  consumptive  ability,  a  consumptive  burst  weapon

bestows one negative level. Bows, crossbows, and slings

so crafted bestow the effect upon their ammunition.

Even  if  the  consumptive  ability  is  not  active,  the

weapon still bestows one negative level on a suc-

cessful critical hit.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Magic

Arms and Armor, enervation; Price +3 bonus.

Ignan:  An  ignan  weapon  is  imbued  with

the  re-dominant planar trait. This power grants

the weapon the ability to overcome the damage

reduction of any creature with the water subtype

(regardless of what the damage reduction normally

speci es). It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage

against  creatures  with  the  water  subtype.  It

bestows one negative level on any water crea-

ture  attempting  to  wield  it.  The  negative  level

remains  as  long  as  the  weapon  is  in  hand  and

disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded.

This negative level never results in actual level loss,

but it cannot be overcome in any way (including

restoration  spells)  while  the  weapon  is  wielded.

Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the

ignan special ability upon their ammunition.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  7th;  Craft  Magic

Arms  and  Armor,  creator  must  be  of  the   re

subtype; Price +2 bonus.

Impedance:  An  impedance  weapon  mimics

the impeded magic planar trait. When the wielder

strikes a creature that uses spells or spell-like abili-

ties, that creatures ability to use its spells is impeded for

1d6 rounds. To cast an impeded spell or use an impeded

spell-like  ability,  the  creature  must  make  a  Spellcraft

check, Intelligence check, or Charisma check (whatever is

most bene cial to the creature) against a DC of 15

+ the level of the spell. If the check fails, the spell

does  not  function  but  is  still  lost  as  a  prepared

spell or a use of a spell-like ability. If the check succeeds,

the spell functions normally.

Terran:  A  terran  weapon  is  imbued  with  the  earth-

dominant planar trait. This power grants the weapon the

ability to overcome the damage reduction of any creature

with the air subtype (regardless of what the damage reduc-

tion  normally  speci es).  It  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of

damage against creatures with the air subtype. It bestows

one negative level on any air creature attempting to wield

it.  The  negative  level  remains  as  long  as  the  weapon  is

in  hand  and  disappears  when  the  weapon  is  no  longer

wielded. This negative level never results in actual level

loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including res-

toration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, cross-

bows, and slings so crafted bestow the terran power upon

their ammunition.

The  following  weapons  are  usually  pre-

constructed  with  exactly  the  qualities

described here.

Afterlife: This +2 consumptive burst unholy

greatsword hungers for the life force of its vic-

tims.  In  addition  to  its  evil  nature,  once  per

day the wielder can use death knell as a standard

action when the wielder touches the tip of After-

life to the body of a fallen foe.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  7th;  Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, death knell, unholy blight, creator must be

evil; Price 105,550 gp; Cost 52,950 gp + 4,208 XP.

Conflagrant: This +1 ignan flaming burst long-

spear can be used in melee or as a thrown weapon. In

addition to its  ery traits, once per day the wielder

can use  reball as a standard action. If the wielder

wishes,  he  may  choose  to  activate  the  fireball  use

for the day in conjunction with throwing the spear

(this attack does not require an extra standard action

beyond making the ranged attack). In such a case,

the   reball  detonates  only  if  the  spear  successfully

strikes its target.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor,   reball,  creator  must  be  of  the   re  subtype;

Price 60,305 gp; Cost 30,305 gp + 2,400 XP.

Lethes Lash: A spellcaster struck by this +1 whip

loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level

he can cast. If two or more spells  t this criterion, the

caster decides which one becomes inaccessible. The

lost spell becomes available again the next time the

caster rests and regains spells.

Moderate enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and

Armor, modify memory; Price 22,301 gp; Cost 11,301 gp +

880 XP.

Quencher: This +1 aquan bane (fire outsiders) warham-

range of touch.

Moderate evocation; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

type; Price 40,312 gp; Cost 20,312 gp + 1,600 XP.

RINGS

Coveted everywhere, on every plane, magic rings rank among

the most versatile and valuable magic items available. Those

rings that relate speci cally to the planes are even more valu-

able to planar travelers.

For  more  information  on  rings,  see  page  229  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Elemental Adaptation: This gold ring is set with four

tiny gemstones: a ruby, an emerald, a sapphire, and a

garnet. The wearer can ignore many of the dangers of

travel on element-dominant planes (including the

Elemental Planes themselves), as follows.

The  wearer  runs  no  risk  of  suffocation

on earth-dominant planes, such as the Ele-

mental Plane of Earth. However, the ring

confers no ability to burrow out of earth;

if a character traveling to an earth-dominant

plane arrives in solid earth, he still has to dig

his way out.

The  wearer  ignores  the  high  heat  of   re-

dominant  planes,  such  as  the  Elemental  Plane  of

Fire. The wearer does not take the usual 3d10 points

of   re  damage  every  round,  nor  do  his  clothing  or

 ammable  possessions  catch   re.  The  ring  provides

no other protection against  re damage.

The wearer can breathe normally on water- dominant

planes,  such  as  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Water.  The

ring  does  not  provide  the  same  benefit  in  ordinary

water, however.

Finally,  the  wearer  gains  a  +5  bonus  on  Spellcraft

checks to cast spells or use spell-like abilities that would

be impeded by an Elemental Planes magic traits.

Strong abjuration; CL 12th; Forge Ring, avoid planar

effects; Price 24,000 gp.

Ethereal Travel: Donning this tarnished silver ring

transfers the wearer to the Ethereal Plane. Removing

the ring ends the effect and returns the wearer to the

plane he previously occupied. However, if a character

wearing a ring of ethereal travel becomes nonethereal by

some other means (such as passing through an ethereal

curtain), removing the ring has no effectthe character

remains where he is, though if he subsequently dons

the ring again, he again becomes ethereal.

Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Forge Ring, ethereal

jaunt; Price 182,000 gp.

Free  Magic:  This  platinum  ring,  etched  with  arcane

symbols, is designed to counteract the effects of planes

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   80

5/20/04, 12:55:55 PM

with the limited magic trait. By expending charges from

a ring of free magic, the wearer can cast spells of the pro-

hibited school, subschool, descriptor, or level as if the

limited magic trait didnt exist. The number of charges

expended is equal to the level of the spell the wearer

wishes to cast.

A newly created ring of free magic has 50 charges.

When  all  the  charges  are  expended,  the  ring

becomes a nonmagical item.

Strong evocation; CL 12th; Forge Ring, imbue with

spell ability; Price 45,000 gp.

Limbo  Control:  With  this  mithral  ring,

the wearer can establish control over a raw area

of the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo without

making  the  usual  Wisdom  check.  The  wearer

merely  visualizes  what  sort  of  environment  he

wants, and the ring creates it, in a 25-foot-radius

sphere centering on the wearer. Further, even if

the wearer falls unconscious, the sphere of control

retains  the  form  the  wearer  speci ed.  The  wearer

can change the form of the controlled area once

per round as a free action.

Strong conjuration; CL 12th; Forge Ring, major

creation; Price 120,000 gp.

Negative Protection: This gleaming white gold

ring  enables  the  wearer  to  ignore  the  1d6  points  of

damage  dealt  by  negative-dominant  planes,  such  as

the Negative Energy Plane. Additionally, the wearer

cannot gain negative levels while he wears this ring,

making  the  item  popular  with  those  who  battle

undead.

Strong abjuration; CL 12th; Forge Ring, negative energy

protection; Price 72,000 gp.

Positive  Protection:  This  black  iron  ring

enables the wearer to ignore the blinding effect

of positive-dominant planes, such as the Positive Energy

Plane. In addition, the wearer does not gain the fast heal-

ing  ability  usually  conferred  by  a  positive-dominant

plane, nor does the character gain additional hit points

when he reaches his normal maximum. Spells that chan-

nel  positive  energytypically  healing  spellshave  no

effect on the wearer (making this item very popular with

intelligent undead).

Strong abjuration; CL 12th; Forge Ring, positive energy

protection; Price 72,000 gp.

Water Breathing: This silver ring is shaped to show a

 sh biting its own tail. It enables the wearer to breathe freely

in water.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Forge Ring, water breathing;

Price 12,000 gp.

RODS

The  two  magic  rods  described  here  represent  opposite

extremes of the alignment spectrum.

Celestial Might: Carved from a single length

of  arrow-straight  ash,  its  ends  shod  in  gold  and

silver  bands,  this  rod  is  meant  to  be  carried

into battle by those who seek to conquer the

Lower Planes.

A rod of celestial might functions as a +2/+2

quarterstaff.  If  the  rod  strikes  an  evil  out-

sider,  its  wielder  can  trigger  a  holy  smite

effect centered on the creature struck. This

is  a  free  action  and  may  be  used  three  times

per day.

If the wielder is within 60 feet of an evil outsider,

he  can  summon  an  avoral  guardinal  as  a  standard

action (as summon monster VII).

Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic

Arms  and  Armor,  summon  monster  VII,  holy  smite;

Price 110,600 gp; Cost 55,600 gp + 4,400 XP.

Enervating Strike: Crafted from wood exposed

to a doldrum (a minor negative-dominant zone) on

the Negative Energy Plane itself, a rod of enervat-

ing strike functions as a +1 heavy mace. In addi-

tion, any creature it strikes in melee is subject

to an in ict light wounds spell. If the rod scores a

critical hit, the creature is instead targeted by an

in ict serious wounds spell.

STAFFS

Staffs have great utility in generalbeing able to hold spells

of  any  levelbut  are  usually  created  with  the  Material

Plane in mind. The following staffs, if not created on other

planes,  are  at  least  oriented  toward  the  unusual  require-

ments of planar travel.

For  more  information  on  staffs,  see  page  243  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Abyssal  Iron:  Forged  from  the  metal  of  the  Lakes  of

Molten Iron on the Plain of In nite Portals (the topmost of

the In nite Layers of the Abyss), this staff looks like noth-

ing more than a particularly long and slightly twisted iron

rod, with dents and nicks along its entire length. It gives off

an odor of burnt metal, like that in a foundry, and always

leaves a dark stain on its wielders hands. A staff of abyssal iron

allows use of the following spells:

Protection from good (1 charge)

Protection from law (1 charge)

Magic circle against good (1 charge)

Magic circle against law (1 charge)

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Staff, water walk,

as long as a human hand, and wrapped with silver  ligree,

this staff allows use of the following spells.

Air walk (1 charge)

Control winds (1 charge)

Moderate  transmutation;  CL  9th;  Craft  Staff,  air  walk,

WONDROUS ITEMS

The  vast  array  of  wondrous  items  becomes  even  more

diverse when these planar-related items are made available

to characters and creatures in a campaign.

82

Boots of Gravity: These leather boots allow the wearer

to  choose  the  direction  of  gravitys  pull  on  him  and  his

equipment.  The  character  can  move

normally  on  any  solid  surface

by  imagining  down  as  being

whatever  is  below  the  boots.  A

character  can  make  this  decision

once per round, as a free action.

If the wearer of the boots drops

an item, it falls toward the ground

as normal.

The wearer of the boots can

carry  another  living  being,

and  so  long  as  the  wearer  does

not  let  go  of  the  second  character,

that  characters  gravity  is  the  same  as  the

wearers.  However,  as  soon  as  the  wearer

releases  the  character,  normal  grav-

ity takes over.

Technically, a character wearing

boots of gravity can  y by choosing a

solid surface and letting himself fall through the air toward

it. A character  ying in this fashion moves at 60 feet per

round. He can turn once per round thereafter by choosing

a new down and falling in that direction. A falling char-

acter  loses  all  downward  momentum  when  he  rede nes

his gravity.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, false

gravity; Price 50,400 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Cloak of Shadow: This dark gray cloak appears to be

made of diaphanous cloth that always seems to be  utter-

ing  slightly,  as  though  in  a  breeze.  When  worn  with  the

hood up, a cloak of shadow gives the wearer a +5 competence

bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadowy illumination, but

applies a 5 penalty in brightly lit areas. In addition, when

the wearer is in complete darkness, he can become incorpo-

real once per day for up to 1 minute.

The cloak is actually a greater shadow (see page 221 of the

Monster Manual), bound to the shape of a cloak by magic.

Once per day, the wearer can command the shadow to come

forth, and it does the wearers bidding until slain, or until

the wearer commands it to return to its cloak form. If the

shadow is slain, it reverts to cloak form and cant be brought

forth  again  for  seven  days  (the  cloak  functions  normally,

but the shadow cant be activated during this time). If the

cloak is destroyed, the shadow is destroyed forever. Should

the wearer enter the Plane of Shadow, the greater shadow

is free to act on its ownand may well attempt to slay its

former master.

Strong  conjuration;  CL  15th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

summon monster VIII, ethereal jaunt; Price 75,000 gp; Weight

1 lb.

Deck  of  Illusions,  Planar:  This  set  of  parchment

cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box.

A full deck consists of thirty-four cards. A planar deck of

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   82

5/20/04, 12:56:01 PM

illusions appears identical to a regular deck of illusions. As

with  a  regular  deck,  when  a  card  is  drawn  at  random

and thrown to the ground, a major image of a creature is

formed.  The  figment  lasts  until  dispelled.  The  illusory

creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where

the  card  landed,  but  otherwise  moves  and  acts  as  if  it

were real. At all times, it obeys the desires of the char-

acter who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled,

the  card  becomes  blank  and  cannot  be  used  again.  If

the  card  is  picked  up,  the  illusion  is  automatically  and

instantly dispelled.

A regular deck of illusions produces illusions of creatures

suitable  to  the  environment  of  the  Material  Plane.  The

images of the creatures conjured with a planar deck of illu-

sions have a signi cantly otherworldly focus. The cards in a

deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on

the accompanying table. (Use one of the  rst two columns

to simulate the contents of a full deck, using either ordinary

playing cards or tarot cards.)

its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a

corresponding amount.

Faint illusion; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, major image;

Price 8,100 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.

Gate Compass: This item looks like an ordinary compass.

Instead of pointing to true north, a gate compass points to an

area envisioned by the holder (or to the nearest portal lead-

ing to the area). It has the same chance of being on target or

off target as if it were casting a teleport spell. Once the com-

pass points to an area (either correctly or incorrectly), it will

continue to point consistently to the area until it reaches the

area or goes to another plane.

Faint  divination;  CL  5th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  divina-

tion; Price 2,500 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Gate Compass, Greater: As a gate compass, except that it

always points correctly to the desired destination.

Moderate divination; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item,  nd

the path; Price 10,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Ring Gates, Planar: Similar to ring gates, these items

always  come  in  pairstwo  silver-etched  iron  rings,  each

about  5  feet  in  diameter.  The  rings  must  be  on  different

planes  of  existence  to  function.  Whatever  is  put  through

one ring comes out the other, and up to 10,000 pounds of

material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially

pushed  through  and  then  retracted  do  not  count.)  This

useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or

creatures. A character can reach through to grab items near

the other ring or even stab a weapon through if so desired.

Alternatively,  a  character  could  stick  his  head  through  to

look around. A spellcaster can cast a spell through a planar

ring  gate.  Creatures  of  Fine,  Diminutive,  Tiny,  Small,  or

Medium size can pass through easily. A Large creature can

make  a  DC  15  Escape  Artist  check  to  slip  through.  Each

ring has an entry side and an exit side, both marked with

appropriate symbols.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, gate;

Price 200,000 gp; Weight 20 lb. each.

Rope of Crossing: This seemingly ordinary rope enables

planar travel across the layers of an Outer Plane. While hold-

ing one end of the rope, the bearer can hurl the other end up

into the air, where it remains magically suspended, or drop

the other end down from a height, such as a cliff or a tree.

By moving up the rope, climbers can ascend to higher layers

on their current plane; by moving down the rope, climbers

can descend to lower layers of the plane. The rope magically

lengthens or shortens, depending on how many layers the

plane has.

Crossing from one layer to the next is accomplished by

climbing 10 feet on the rope. When the climber reaches

his destination, he merely steps off the rope, and he is on

the new layer of the plane. The rope remains in place until

the  last  climber  steps  off,  at  which  point  the  bearer  can

recoil the rope.

magic, this item fails to function.

Moderate  conjuration;  CL  9th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

plane shift; Price 90,000 gp; Weight 10 lb.

Sextant of the Planes: A sextant of the planes analyzes the

environment to give the user a planar bearing. In essence, it

determines what planar traits the plane exhibits.

When not in use, the sextant appears to be a brass sphere

about 4 inches across, nestled into a round brass box about

8  inches  in  diameter,  with  designs  inscribed  over  every

surface.  When  the  brass  sphere  is  pulled  upward,  the

device unfolds to reveal the inner workings, including a

series of crystal lenses and a myriad of control knobs and

levers. This unfolding process takes 1 full round; restor-

ing the sextant to its portable form takes the same amount

of time.

Using a sextant of the planes takes 1 minute and reveals the

following information (see page 147 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide for more information about planar traits).

Whether  the  gravity  is  normal,  heavy,  light,  objective

(down is always a speci c direction), subjective (down

is de ned by each individual), or nonexistent.

Whether time passes at the normal rate, faster, slower,

or erratically (randomly speeding up or slowing down),

or whether time has any noticeable effect on the plane

at all.

Whether  the  plane  is  in nite,   nite,  or  self-contained

(the edges of the plane wrap around).

Whether  the  planes  basic  nature  is  alterable  morphic

(you  can  make  changes  by  physical  effort),  static  (the

plane  never  changes),  highly  morphic  (changing  as  a

reaction to various stimuli), magically morphic (you can

make changes by casting spells), divinely morphic (dei-

ties can change the plane), or sentient (the plane effects

its own changes).

Whether the element of air, earth,  re, or water is domi-

nant on the plane, or whether the plane is dominated by

positive or negative energy.

Whether  the  plane  is  aligned  with  good  or  evil,  law  or

chaos, or neutrality, and whether the alignment is mild

or strong.

Whether magic works normally on the plane, or is dead

(nonexistent), wild (unpredictable in effect), impeded

(spells  are  more  difficult  to  cast),  enhanced  (cast  as

though  with  metamagic  effects),  or  limited  (only

spells  of  certain  schools,  subschools,  descriptors,  or

levels work).

The location of any portals within 60 feet of the sextant.

A  sextant  does  not  reveal  the  name  of  the  plane  it  is  on,

though its user can attempt a DC 18 Knowledge (the planes)

check to determine which plane or planes this information

corresponds to.

When used within 30 feet of a portal, a sextant of the planes

can  be  instructed  to  provide  the  same  information  about

the plane on the far side of the portal, as well as whether the

portal is one-way or two-way.

Vestments of Steadfast Spellcasting: Versions of this

item can vary greatly in appearance, depending on the race

of the garments creator and the plane upon which it was

made. Its appearance ranges from snowy white celestial

robes  to  leaf-adorned,  dirt-colored  clothing  suitable  to

the Beastlands. Vestments of steadfast spellcasting enable the

wearer to ignore the magic trait of a plane (except for dead

magic planes) and cast spells normally. Depending on the

plane visited, the owner of the garment might  nd it to be

of  unparalleled  utility  or  might  choose  to  take  it  off  to

experience  the  enhanced  spellcasting  opportunities  cer-

tain places afford.

lows. When sounded properly (requiring a DC 15 Perform

bay.  All  creatures  except  evil  outsiders  within  a  60-foot

spread must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become pan-

icked for 2d6 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear

effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected

creature cannot be affected by the same yeth horns sound

for 24 hours.

PLANAR DOMAINS

A planar domain counts as both of a clerics domain choices.

The granted powers of a planar domain are more potent

than  those  of  other  domains,  and  each  level  offers  two

spells  from  which  a  cleric  may  choose  when  preparing

spells. Each day, a cleric with access to a planar domain

chooses  one  of  the  two  spells  available  to  prepare  in

his domain spell slot for each spell level. Unlike other

domains,  planar  domains  each  have  an  alignment

requirement that must be met by a cleric who wants to

access the domain.

Though some of the domains below mention deities

that  can  grant  access  to  their  followers,  a  cleric  need

not  select  a  specific  deity  to  have  access  to  a  planar

domain.  A  cleric  who  devotes  himself  to  a  specific

alignment (LG, NG, CG, LN, CN, LE, NE, or CE) rather

than a deity can select a planar domain in place of his

two normal domain choices. If the DM wishes, she can

make domains specific to other planes, using these as

representative guides.

Most of the spells in the domains described below

are  found  in  the  Players  Handbook;  those  marked

with  an  asterisk  are  found  in  this  chapter.  An  X

following a spell name denotes a spell with an XP

component paid by the caster. An M or F denotes a

spell with a material or focus component, respec-

tively, that is not normally included in a spell com-

ponent pouch.

Duration: 10 min./level (D)

Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a pack of demons

from the In nite Layers of the Abyss

to serve you.

When  the  spell  is  complete,  2d4

dretches  appear.  Ten  minutes  later,

1d4 babau demons appear. Ten min-

appears. Each creature has maximum

creatures  appear,  they  serve  you  for

the duration of the spell.

The  demons  obey  you  explicitly  and

never attack you, even if someone else

manages to gain control over them.

You  do  not  need  to  concentrate  to

maintain  control  over  the  demons.

You  can  dismiss  them  singly  or  in

groups at any time.

Duration:  Concentration,  up  to  1

round/level (D)

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

You can tell whether an area contains

a  portal.  If  you  study  an  area  for  1

round,  you  know  the  sizes  and  loca-

tions of any portals in the area. Once

you  nd a portal, you can study it. (If

you  nd more than one portal, you can

study only one at a time.)

Each  round  you  study  a  portal,

you can discover one property of the

portal, in this order:

Any key or command word needed

to activate the portal.

Any special circumstances govern-

ing the portals use (such as speci c

times when it can be activated).

Whether  the  portal  is  one-way  or

two-way.

A  glimpse  of  the  area  where  the

portal leads. You can look at the area

where the portal leads for 1 round;

the  range  of  the  casters  vision  is

the spells range. Analyze portal does

not  allow  other  divination  spells

or  spell-like  abilities  to  extend

through  the  portal.  For  example,

you  cannot  also  use  detect  magic  or

detect evil to study the area where the

portal leads while viewing the area

with analyze portal.

92

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   92

5/20/04, 12:56:34 PM

For each property, you make a caster

level check (1d20 + caster level) against

DC 17. If fail, you can try again in the

next round.

Analyze  portal  has  only  a  limited

ability to reveal unusual properties, as

follows:

Random  Portals:  The  spell  reveals

only that the portal is random and

whether  it  can  be  activated  now.

It  does  not  reveal  when  the  portal

starts or stops functioning.

Variable  Portals:  The  spell  reveals

only  that  the  portal  is  variable.  If

the caster studies the portals des-

tination, the spell reveals only the

destination  to  which  the  portal  is

currently set.

Creature-Only  Portals:  The  spell

reveals  this  property.  If  the  caster

studies the portals destination, the

spell reveals where the portal sends

creatures. If it is the kind of portal

that  sends  creatures  to  one  place

and  their  equipment  to  another

place,  the  spell  does  not  reveal

where the equipment goes.

Malfunctioning  Portals:  The  spell

reveals only that the  portal is mal-

functioning,  not  what  sort  of

malfunction the portal produces.

Material Components: A crystal lens

and a small mirror.

Spell Resistance: No

You  can  tell  whether  an  area  con-

tains  a  planar  touchstone.  If  you

study an area for 1 round, you know

the location of any touchstone in the

area.  Once  you  find  a  touchstone,

you  can  study  it.  (If  you  find  more

than one touchstonean extremely

rare occurrenceyou can study only

one at a time.)

Each round you study a touchstone,

you can discover one property of the

touchstone, in this order:

The base ability gained by someone

who  takes  the  Planar  Touchstone

feat related to the site.

Any conditions that must be met in

order  to  recharge  the  higher-order

ability granted by the site.

The  higher-order  ability  gained

by someone who visits the touch-

stone  and  fulfills  the  recharge

condition.

The  number  of  uses  of  the  higher-

order ability that the character gains

from visiting the site and ful lling

the recharge condition.

For each of these properties, you make

a caster level check (1d20 + caster level)

against DC 15. If you fail, you can try

again in the next round.

Material Components: A crystal lens,

a drop of ink, and a piece of paper or

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

A driving rain falls around you. It falls

in a  xed area once created. The storm

reduces hearing and visibility, result-

ing  in  a  4  penalty  on  Listen,  Spot,

4 penalty on all ranged attacks made

into,  out  of,  or  through  the  storm.

Finally,  it  automatically  extinguishes

any unprotected  ames and has a 50%

chance to extinguish protected  ames

(such as those of lanterns).

The rain damages lawful creatures,

dealing  2d6  points  of  damage  per

round  (lawful  outsiders  take  double

damage).  In  addition,  each  round,  a

bolt  of  lightning  strikes  a  randomly

selected  lawful  outsider  within  the

This  spell  opens  up  a  small  planar

portal  from  the  Astral  Plane  to  a

can  occur  (unlike  on  the  Astral

demiplane is roughly 50 feet square,

and  the  demiplane  extends  50  feet

above  the  surface.  The  demiplanes

traits  (including  time,  gravity,  and

magic)  match  those  of  the  Material

Plane, and the demiplane is self-con-

tained; walking to one end returns a

character to the point from which he

began. The demiplane has no unusual

planar traits.

You  gain  a  temporary  respite  from

the natural effects of a speci c plane.

These effects include extremes in tem-

perature, lack of air, poisonous fumes,

emanations  of  positive  or  negative

energy,  or  other  attributes  of  the

plane itself.

Avoid  planar  effects  provides

protection  from  the  3d10

points  of  fire  damage  that

characters  normally  take

when  on  a  plane  with  the

 re-dominant  trait.  Avoid

planar effects allows a char-

acter to breathe water on a

water-dominant  plane  and

ignore the threat of suffoca-

tion  on  an  earth-dominant

plane.  A  character  protected  by

avoid planar effects cant be blinded

by the energy of a major positive-

dominant  plane  and  automati-

cally stops gaining temporary

hit  points  when  they  equal  the

characters  full  normal  hit  point

total.  Negative-dominant  planes

dont deal damage or bestow nega-

tive  levels  to  characters  protected

by avoid planar effects.

In  addition,  some  effects

specific  to  a  plane  are  negated

by  avoid  planar  effects.  In  the

D&D  cosmology,  avoid  planar

effects  negates  the  deafening

effect  of  Pandemonium  and  the

cold  damage  on  the  Cania  layer

of  the  Nine  Hells.  The  DM  can

add  additional  protections  for

a  cosmology  he  creates.  If  the

campaign has an Elemental Plane

of Cold, for example, avoid planar

effects  protects  against  the  base

cold damage dealt to everyone on

the plane.

The  effects  of  gravity  traits,

alignment  traits,  and  magic  traits

arent  negated  by  avoid  planar  effects,

nor  is  the  special  entrapping  trait

that  some  planes  (such  as  Elysium

and Hades) have.

The  spell  does  not  provide  pro-

tection  against  creatures,  native  or

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   94

5/20/04, 12:56:39 PM

otherwise, nor does it protect against

spells,  special  abilities,  or  extreme

and  nonnatural  formations  within

the  plane.  This  spell  allows  you  to

survive  on  the  Elemental  Plane  of

Earth, but it wont protect you if you

walk  into  a  pool  of  magma  on  that

same plane.

A  driving  rain  falls  around  you.  It

falls  in  a  fixed  area  once  created.

The storm reduces hearing and vis-

Listen,  Spot,  and  Search  checks.

It  also  applies  a  4  penalty  on  all

ranged attacks made into, out of, or

through  the  storm.  Finally,  it  auto-

matically  extinguishes  any  unpro-

tected flames and has a 50% chance

to extinguish protected flames (such

as those of lanterns).

The rain damages chaotic creatures,

dealing  2d6  points  of  damage  per

round  (chaotic  outsiders  take  double

damage).  In  addition,  each  round,

a  gout  of  acid  strikes  a  randomly

selected  chaotic  outsider  within  the

This demon-inspired transmutation

causes the subject to secrete a slimy

red layer of jelly that coats her skin,

armor,  and  equipment.  While  the

slime does not harm the subject or

her  equipment,  any  other  weapon

that  touches  it  takes  1d8  points  of

acid damage from the corrosive goo,

and  the  weapons  hardness  does

not  reduce  this  damage.  A  magic

weapon  may  attempt  a  Reflex  save

to avoid taking this damage. A crea-

less, object)

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  causes  a  color  pool  on  the

Astral  Planean  irregular  patch  of

color  containing  a  portal  to  another

planeto seemingly cease to exist. In

Corporeal Instability

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Touch

Target: Living creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your  touch  transforms  a  living

creature  into  a  spongy,  amorphous

mass, its shape melting and writhing

uncontrollably. An affected creature

is  unable  to  hold  or  use  any  item.

Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets

become  useless.  Large  items  worn

or  carriedarmor,  backpacks,  and

even shirtshamper more than help,

reducing the victims Dexterity score

by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs

reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter

normal, whichever is less. The victim

becomes blind and cannot cast spells

or use magic items, and searing pain

renders  it  incapable  of  attacking.

While  in  this  form,  the  creature  has

immunity to extra damage from criti-

cal  hits  and  sneak  attacks  due  to  its

amorphous nature.

Each  round  the  victim  spends  in

an amorphous state causes 1 point of

Wisdom drain from mental shock. If

the victims Wisdom score is reduced

to 0, it falls unconscious. A conscious

victim  can  regain  its  own  shape  by

taking a standard action to attempt a

new Fortitude save. Success ends the

spell effect.

Necromancy [Force]

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level or until you

are killed

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Some extraplanar creatures, such as

a  balor  or  an  energon,  expend  the

last  of  their  life  energy  in  a  burst

of  power.  You  likewise  attune  your

bodys  life  force  so  that  if  you  are

killed, your body is instantaneously

destroyed in an explosion of energy

that deals 1d8 points of force damage

per caster level to everyone in a 30-

foot-radius burst.

This  explosion  entirely  destroys

your  body,  preventing  any  form  of

raising  or  resurrection

that requires part of the

corpse. A wish, miracle, or

true  resurrection  spell  can

restore life.

points  of  damage  to  any  creature

that  has  both  the  chaotic  and  evil

subtypes  (such  as  a  howler  or  a

demon). A successful Fortitude save

negates this damage.

If the target creature also possesses

the  tanarri  subtype,  the  spell  has

a  much  more  powerful  effect.  The

targets  blood  seethes  and  churns,

stunning it for 1d4 rounds and dealing

3d6 points of damage in each of those

rounds.  A  successful  Fortitude  save

negates  the  stun  effect  and  reduces

the  duration  to  1  round.  Such  crea-

tures spell resistance does not apply

against this effect.

This  spell  was  developed  by

demonic  spellcasters  ages  ago

for use against their ancient

foes,  the  devils  of  Baator.  It

deals  2d6  points  of  damage

to  creatures  that  have  both

the  lawful  and  evil  subtypes

(such as a barghest or a devil). No

saving throw is allowed against

this damage.

If  the  target  creature  also

possesses  the  baatezu  sub-

type,  the  spell  has  a  much

more powerful effect. The tar-

gets  mind  reels,  confusing  it  for

1d6 rounds and dealing 2d6 points

of damage in each of those rounds. A

successful Will save negates the con-

fusion  effect  and  reduces  the  dura-

tion to 1 round. Such creatures spell

Level: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 feet

Target: Living creature

Duration:  1  round/level  and  1d8

rounds; see text

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

gaze  of  the  shadowy  nightwalkers,

causes  your  eyes  to  glow  with  dark

energy.  Immediately  upon  comple-

tion  of  the  spell,  you  may  target  a

living creature within range with your

with fear for 1d8 rounds. You must be

able  to  see  the  creature,  and  it  must

be able to see you (though it need not

meet your gaze).

Once  per  round  after  that  for  the

duration  of  the  spell,  you  can  target

another creature with your glare as a

move action. You cant target the same

creature twice with a single casting of

the spell, regardless of the success of

its saves.

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving  Throw:  Will  negates  (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The  subject  of  this  spell  can  travel

on  any  solid  surface  as  though  that

surface  possessed  its  own  gravity.

For example, the subject could walk

or even run up a wall as though the

wall were a perfectly level floor. The

subject can switch down as often as

he likes during the spells duration,

though  only  once  per  round,  as  a

free action. Unattended objects fall,

as normal.

The  subject  of  false  gravity  can

fly  by  choosing  a  solid  surface  and

letting  himself  fall  through  the  air

toward it. A character flying in this

fashion  moves  at  30  feet  per  round

and can make one turn, in any direc-

tion, once per round, by redefining

his personal gravity. A character fall-

ing  in  this  fashion  loses  all  down-

ward momentum when he changes

his gravity.

Material  Component :  A  pair  of

magnets.

Mantle of Law

Abjuration [Law]

Level: Cleric 3, paladin 3

Mechanus Mind

Enchantment  (Compulsion)  [Lawful,

Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving  Throw:  Fortitude  negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Like entities that inhabit the plane of

Mechanus,  the  subject  of  Mechanus

mind temporarily becomes a being of

focused order. The subject gains a +4

bonus on Will saving throws to resist

mind-affecting spells.

While in the grip of Mechanus mind,

the  subject  also  becomes  more  ana-

lytical and less emotional. The subject

gains  a  +2  bonus  on  all  Intelligence-

based checks, but takes a 2 penalty on

Charisma-based checks.

Miasma of Entropy

Necromancy

Level: Druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 30 ft.

Area: Cone-shaped burst, one solid

object, or one organic construct

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

or Fortitude half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

Miasma  of  entropy  causes  accelerated

decay in all wood, leather, and other

natural materials in the spells area. It

destroys nonmagical objects of wood,

leather,  paper,  and  other  formerly

living  organic  matter.  All  such

objects  within  the  area  rot  into

slimy,  pulpy  masses.  Objects  weigh-

ing  more  than  1  pound  per  caster

level  are  not  affected,  but  all  other

objects  of  the  appropriate  composi-

tion are ruined.

Alternatively,  you  can  target

miasma  of  entropy  against  a  single

solid  object  of  nonliving  organic

matter that weighs up to 10 pounds

per caster level.

When  targeted  against  an  ani-

mated  object  made  of  an  organic

material, miasma of entropy deals 1d6

points  of  damage  per  caster  level

(maximum  20d6),  with  a  Fortitude

save for half damage.

Negative Energy Aura

Necromancy

Level: Cleric 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Area:  10-ft.-radius  emanation  cen-

tered on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

An aura of black, crackling negative

energy  surrounds  you.  Each  round

on  your  turn,  every  living  creature

within  10  feet  of  you  loses  2  hit

points.  Undead  creatures  instead

gain  2  hit  points  per  round  (though

they  cant  exceed  their  full  normal

hit  points  from  this  effect).  Char-

acters  with  immunity  to  negative

energy effects are not affected by this

aura. The negative energy aura does not

affect you.

Inspired  by  the  deadly  gaze  of  the

noble  ghaele  eladrin,  this  spell

causes  your  eyes  to  glow  with  a

pearly light. If the target is evil and

has 5 or fewer Hit Dice, it dies unless

it  succeeds  on  a  Will  save.  Even  if

the  save  succeeds,  the  creature  is

affected as though by a fear spell for

2d10 rounds.

Nonevil  creatures  and  evil  crea-

tures  with  more  than  5  Hit  Dice  are

not  slain  by  opalescent  glare,  and  they

suffer  the  fear  effect  only  if  they  fail

the Will save.

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Duration: 1 round/level; see text

Saving  Throw:  None  (object)  and

Re ex negates; see text

Spell Resistance: No

Unless  controlled,  the  Ever-Changing

Chaos of Limbo is just what the planes

name implies: a roiling soup of energy

and  elements.  Natives  learn  to  control

it or to inhabit areas that have enjoyed

some  measure  of  control  for  a  long

damage for each round a creature lin-

gers within it.

Complete  Barrier:  A  perinarch  can

create a complete barrier of solid stone

encircling herself and her allies, pre-

venting access by any other than the

most accomplished tunnelers. On the

other hand, a perinarch can attempt to

trap  foes  within  their  own  bubble  of

solid stone.

Perinarch, Planar

Transmutation

Level: Druid 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

As perinarch, except that the caster can

cast this spell on any highly morphic

or  divinely  morphic  plane  (most  of

the  Outer  Planes  are  divinely  mor-

phic).  However,  mortals  who  change

the  fabric  of  a  gods  domain  should

think  twice,  depending  on  the  DMs

interpretation of a given gods territo-

rial nature.

Planar Bubble

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S, M/DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Area:  10-ft.-radius  emanation  from

touched creature

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving  Throw:  Will  negates  (harm-

less)

Spell Resistance: No; see text

This  spell  creates  an  area  around

the  target  creature  that  emulates  its

native  planar  environment.  Thus,  a

character  hailing  from  the  Material

Plane  would  have  normal  gravity,

temperature,  magic,  and  so  on.  This

spell cast on a native of

the  Plane  of  Shadow

would  make

the area around

her have normal

period,  but  visitors  to  areas  of  raw

limbo  must  make  a  DC  16  Wisdom

check  to  gain  control  over  the  dan-

gerous roil. The perinarch spell gives

the  caster  automatic  control  of  a

radius  of  raw  Limbo  (an  area  not

already  stabilized  or  within  some

other  creatures  control)  in  close

range.  Control  allows  the  perinarch

(the name sometimes given to those

who  can  cast  the  perinarch  spell)  to

reshape the raw limbo as she desires,

adding or subtracting one of the four

basic  elements  once  per  round  as  a

standard  action.  A  favorite  among

travelers from the Material Plane is a

chunk of earth surrounded by a small

atmosphere of air.

Casting  this  spell  overlaps  with

the  control  already  (potentially)

established  by  the  perinarch  with  a

Wisdom  check.  Allies  of  the  caster

may  give  their  control  over  to  the

perinarch  caster  contiguous  with  the

spell  being  cast,  if  they  so  choose.

Control cannot be wrested away from

the  caster  while  the  spell  is  in  effect

(which  is  one  of  the  best  reasons

to  cast  this  spell,  even  if  you  have  a

high Wisdom score). If the perinarch

moves more than 100 feet away from

the area that she controlled, the order

she imposed fades away.

A  perinarch  is  unable  to  achieve

any  works  of  complexity  within  an

area  she  controls.  But  she  can  mix

two  or  three  elements  in  a  crude

fashion; a few examples are provided

below.  The  perinarch  may  attempt

to  seize  control  of  a  new  area  that

already  contains  foes;  however,  foes

can make a Re ex save to get out of

the area.

Thick  Barrier:  A  perinarch  can

thicken  empty  air  with  dust  and

rock,  creating  a  zone  around  herself

and  her  allies  that  outside  creatures

must  hack  or  force  a  way  through.

Their speed drops to 5 feet, or 10 feet

for Large or larger creatures.

Fiery Barrier: A perinarch can create

a  thick   eld  of   ame  that  deals  3d10

points of  re damage to any creature

attempting  to  pass  through  it.  The

 eld  also  deals  3d10  points  of   re

gravity,  a  mild  neutral  alignment,

enhanced shadow spells, and impeded

light spells.

Material  Components:  A  sprinkling

of silver dust.

Planar Exchange

Conjuration (Calling) [see text]

Level: Cleric 6

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: One called creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

When you cast this spell, you call an

extraplanar  creature  (speci cally,  an

avoral guardinal, bone devil, or babau

demon, at your option) to your precise

location. At the same instant, you are

transported  to  that  creatures  home

plane,  where  you  exist  in  stasis  for

the  duration  of  the  spell.  To  a  casual

observer,  it  appears  that  you  have

transformed  into  the  called  creature

(though an onlooker who makes a DC

25  Spot  check  notices  the  slight  gap

between  your  disappearance  and  the

creatures appearance). If the called

creature would not  t in the place you

occupied when you cast the spell, the

spell fails.

You  have  full  control  over  the

creatures  actions  and  can  perceive

the  environment  around  the  called

creature as if you were seeing through

its  eyes,  hearing  through  its  ears,

and  so  on.  The  creature  has  full

access to all of its abilities, with one

exception:  It  cant  summon  other

creatures.  If  the  called  creature  is

slain, you take 3d6 points of damage

and the spell ends.

While  in  stasis,  you  cant  take

any  actions  other  than  to  control

the  called  creature  or  to  dismiss

the  spell,  nor  can  anything  on  the

creatures  home  plane  affect  you  in

any way. You also cant perceive any-

thing  around  your  bodys

location.  When  you  dis-

miss  the  spell,  or  when

the  creature  is  slain,  you  appear

in  the  creatures  location,  and  it  is

returned to its home plane.

When  you  use  a  calling  spell

that calls a chaotic, evil, good, or

that type.

Level: Cleric 8

As  planar  exchange,  except

you  trade  places  with  a  leonal

Plane Shift, Greater

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 8

This  spell  functions  like  plane  shift,

except  that  if  you  have  visited  the

the precise location (rather than 5 to

500 miles distant).

Positive Energy Aura

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Cleric 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Area:  10-ft.-radius  emanation  cen-

tered on you

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

An  aura  of  white  positive  energy

surrounds you. Each round on your

turn,  every  living  creature  within

10  feet  of  you  gains  2  hit  points

(creatures  cant  exceed  their  full

normal  hit  points  from  this  effect).

Undead  creatures  instead  take  2

points  of  damage  per  round.  Char-

acters  with  immunity  to  positive

energy  effects  are  not  affected  by

this aura. The positive energy aura does

not affect you.

Precipitate Breach

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, M

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Planar breach; see text

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You meddle with the boundaries

between  planes,  creating  insta-

bility  and,   nally,  a  minor  planar

breach.  See  Planar  Breaching,

page  151,  for  details  concerning  this

phenomenon.

You  have  no  control  over  the

breach created. However, as opposed

to a truly random breach (see page

153),  when  this  spell  is   rst  cast

in  any  area  that  doesnt  already

contain  a  breach,  a  minor  breach

forms  automatically.  The  breach

has  the  size  (10d10-foot  radius)

and  onset  time  following  cast-

ing  (1d4  rounds)  described  for

a  random  breach.  Roll  on  Table

71:  Random  Planar  Breaching,

page  152,  to  determine  the  trait

that  leaks  through  from  the

breaching plane. The effect is as for a

minor breach. The breach has a stan-

dard duration for a minor breach (1d6

days  minus  12  hours,  minimum  12

hours), after which time it fades away.

If  you  cast  precipitate  breach  into

an area that currently hosts a minor

breach,  you  precipitate  a  severe

breach.  Reroll  the  size,  the  onset

time, and the trait that leaks through

from  the  breaching  plane  (which

could mean that the identity of the

breaching plane changes). The effect

is as for a severe breach. The breach

has a standard duration for a severe

breach  (1d6  days  minus  48  hours,

minimum 1 hour), after which time

it fades away.

This spell has no effect if cast into

an  area  currently  hosting  a  severe  or

complete breach.

Saving  Throw:  Fortitude  negates

(harmless)

You  can  permanently  seal  an  inter-

planar  portal  or  gate.  If  cast  on  a

portal, the spell prevents any activa-

tion of it, although seal portal may be

dispelled  by  a  dispel  magic  spell.  A

knock spell does not function on the

sealed  portal,  but  a  chime  of  opening

dispels  seal  portal  if  seal  portal  was

cast  by  a  spellcaster  of  lower  than

15th  level.  In  addition,  the  ability

of the gatecrasher prestige class (see

Manual of the Planes) to open portals

may be able to break through a sealed

portal,  but  if  the   rst  attempt  fails,

the gatecrasher cant try again.

Once the portal is opened, seal portal

does not remain in effect and must be

cast again.

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This spell summons a greater elemen-

tal  of  your  choice  (air,  earth,   re,  or

water) from the appropriate Elemental

Plane. It appears where you designate

and acts immediately, on your turn. It

understands your speech (regardless

of your language), and it follows your

commands  to  the  best  of  its  ability.

You  must  concentrate  on  the  spells

effect,  but  commanding  the  creature

is a free action.

A  summoned  creature  cannot

summon or otherwise conjure another

creature, nor can it use any teleporta-

tion or planar travel abilities.

When  you  use  a  summoning  spell

to summon an air, earth,  re, or water

creature, it is a spell of that type.

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: One or more rays of electricity

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  can  convert  an  unused  usage

of  your  higher-order  planar  touch-

stone  ability  into  a  ray  of  electric-

ity  (see  the  Planar  Touchstone  feat,

page 41). This ray exhausts one use of

your  higher-order  ability  and  deals

5d6  points  of  electricity  damage  to

the  target  with  a  successful  ranged

touch attack.

For  every   ve  levels  gained  above

7th,  you  may   re  one  additional  ray

of electricity (to a maximum of three

rays  at  17th  level).  Each  ray  exhausts

one of your higher-order ability uses.

A  driving  rain  falls  around  you.  It

falls  in  a  fixed  area  once  created.

The storm reduces hearing and vis-

ibility,  resulting  in  a  4  penalty  on

Listen,  Spot,  and  Search  checks.

It  also  applies  a  4  penalty  on  all

ranged attacks made into, out of, or

through  the  storm.  Finally,  it  auto-

matically  extinguishes  any  unpro-

tected flames and has a 50% chance

to extinguish protected flames (such

as those of lanterns).

The  rain  damages  good  creatures,

dealing  2d6  points  of  damage  per

round  (good  outsiders  take  double

damage).  In  addition,  each  round,

a  blast  of   re  strikes  a  randomly

selected  good  outsider  within  the

spells area, dealing 5d6 points of  re

damage.  After  the  spells  duration

expires, the water disappears.

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  taps  into  the  planar

energy  of  Mechanus  to  create  a

6-inch-thick  wall  of  moving

iron cogs, wheels, gears, pis-

tons,  and  assorted  mechani-

cal parts. Each 5-foot square

of the walls surface has hard-

ness 10 and 180 hit points.

Both sides of the wall have

hundreds  of  moving  parts  that

flail  out,  dealing  1d6  points  of

bludgeoning  damage  per  two

caster levels (maximum 15d6)

to all creatures within 10 feet.

A successful Reflex save halves this

damage.

Material Component: A small gear.

ANARCHIC CREATURE

Anarchic creatures dwell in planes of chaos, the realms of dis-

order. Although they may resemble creatures from the Mate-

rial Plane, they appear less  nished, their features more rough

and uneven, their fur or scales blotched and tattered, their

appearance more ragged and horri c. They are also called the

Un nished, and some say they were  rst drafts, abandoned

to the roiling planes of chaos by forgotten creators.

CREATING AN

ANARCHIC CREATURE

Anarchic is an inherited template that can be added to any

corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid,

magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin

of nonlawful alignment.

An anarchic creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and  abilities  except  as  noted  here.  Do  not  recalculate  the

creatures Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points

if its type changes.

Size and Type: Animals or vermin with this template

become magical beasts, but otherwise the crea-

ture  type  is  unchanged.  Size  is  unchanged.

Anarchic  creatures  encountered

on  the  Material  Plane  have

the extraplanar subtype.

Special Attacks: An anar-

chic  creature  retains  all  the

special attacks of the base creature

and  also  gains  the  following  spe-

cial attack.

Smite  Law  (Su):  Once  per  day,

an  anarchic  creature  can  make

a  normal  attack  to  deal  extra

damage  equal  to  its  Hit  Dice

(maximum 20 points) against

a lawful opponent.

Special Qualities: An

anarchic creature retains

all the special qualities of

the base creature and also

gains  the  following  special

qualities:

Anarchic satyr

Darkvision out to 60 feet.

Damage reduction (see the table below).

Resistance  to  acid  5,  cold  5,  electricity  5,   re  5,  and

sonic 5.

Immunity to polymorph and petri cation.

Fast healing (see the table below).

An  anarchic  satyr  strikes   rst

with its smite law ability against

foes subject to its damaging

effects.

Smite  Law  (Su):  Once

per  day,  an  anarchic  satyr

can  make  a  normal  attack

to  deal  an  extra  5  points

of  damage  against  a  lawful

opponent.

Pipes (Su): Anarchic satyrs

can  play  a  variety  of  magi-

cal  tunes  on  their  pan  pipes.

Usually,  only  one  satyr  in  a

group  carries  pipes.  When  it

plays,  all  creatures  within  a

60-foot  spread  (except  satyrs)

must succeed on a DC 13 Will

save  or  be  affected  by  charm

person,  sleep,  or  fear  (caster

level 10th; the satyr chooses

the  tune  and  its  effect).

In  the  hands  of  other

beings,  these  pipes  have

no  special  powers.  A  creature

that  successfully  saves  against

any of the pipes effects cannot be

affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours.

A satyr often uses its pipes to charm and seduce espe-

cially comely women or to put a party of adventurers to

sleep and then steal their valuables.

Skills:  Satyrs  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide,  Listen,

Move Silently, Perform, and Spot checks.

the astral kraken tucks the opponent away in the folds of its

body and seeks a new target.

Energy  Drain  (Su):  An  astral  traveler  trapped  in  an

astral krakens cocoon gains one negative level per day as

the astral kraken begins feeding on the victims life energy.

This energy drain begins 24 hours after the victim is  rst

cocooned, and the victim does not receive a Fortitude save

to remove negative levels until he is freed from the astral

cocoon. (The Fortitude save DC to remove a negative level

is  21.)  For  each  such  negative  level  bestowed,  the  astral

kraken  gains  5  temporary  hit  points.  If  an  opponent  is

slain by an astral kraken in this fashion, his physical body

dies as well, and can only be resurrected by a wish, limited

wish, or miracle spell.

AXIOMATIC CREATURE

Axiomatic creatures dwell on lawful planes, the domains

of order. Although they may resemble creatures from the

Material  Plane,  they  are  more  perfectly  formed,  their

features  sharper  and  more  precise,  their  fur  or  plumage

shinier,  their  appearance  clearer  and  more  heroic.  They

are often called perfect creatures, and some say that the

axiomatic  versions  are  the  true  and  ideal   rst  models,

of  which  all  other  creatures  of  the  type  are

merely imitations.

Axiomatic dragonne

Astral krakens prey on astral travelers. They lurk on the

Astral Plane, usually near color pools, where astral travelers

generally pass by. Attracted by some scent only they seem

able  to  perceive,  astral  krakens  attempt  to  snare  travelers

with their tentacles.

COMBAT

When an astral kraken sights prey, it attempts to ensnare a

victim in its tentacles. As soon as it succeeds on a grapple

attempt, it moves away from any remaining opponents (if

possible) and consolidates its hold on the grappled oppo-

nent by grappling with at least one more tentacle (depend-

ing on whether it is still in combat or not). An opponent

can  make  sunder  attempts  against  an  astral  krakens

tentacles as if they were weapons; the tentacles have AC

30 and 18 hit points. If an astral kraken is currently grap-

pling a target, it usually uses any free tentacles to make its

attacks of opportunity against the sunder attempt. Sever-

ing an astral krakens tentacle deals damage to the astral

kraken equal to half the limbs full normal hit points. An

astral kraken withdraws from combat if it loses three or

more tentacles.

An  opponent  grappled  by  an  astral  kraken  faces  one

of two fates. If the opponent is native to the Astral Plane

(not an astral traveler), the astral kraken attempts to deal

bite damage to the target each round. If the opponent is

connected by a silver cord to a physical body elsewhere,

the astral kraken attempts to cocoon the opponent for

a later meal.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an astral

kraken must hit a creature of up to Huge size with a

tentacle attack. It can then attempt to start a grap-

ple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it

establishes a hold. On its next action, the astral

kraken can either deal bite damage to the held

opponent or begin enclosing the opponent in

an astral cocoon.

Astral  Cocoon  (Su):  An  astral  kraken  can

save  a  meal  for  later  by  encasing  it  in  a  trans-

lucent  magical  resin,  trapping  the  victim  on

the  Astral  Plane.  During  each  round  that  an

astral kraken holds an opponent it has pinned,

it secretes a fast-hardening astral adhesive as a

free action. After the  rst round of cocooning,

the opponent can no longer attack, cast spells,

or move on the Astral Plane. An astral travelers

soul cannot return to its material body while it

is trapped in a cocoon.

A  creature  can  escape  the  cocoon  with  a

Strength  check.  The  initial  break  DC  for  the

cocoon is 10, and it increases by 10 for each addi-

tional  round  spent  cocooning,  to  a  maximum

break DC of 30 after three rounds. At this point,

A swarm of blind, writhing

creatures  f lails  through  the

air,  drawing  a  deeper  shadow

of menace behind.

A  dharculus  inserts  its

mawed  tentacle  ends

into  corporeal  planes

to  feed,  much  like  a

bear  scoops  trout  out

of  a  stream.  To  corpo-

real  eyes,  a  dharculuss

six  tentacles  appear  as

a  swarm  of  blind,  snakelike  creatures

sliding through the air in a deadly school

(though  the  shadow  of  the  creatures

menace is visible in dreamy outline). On the

Ethereal Plane or to those who can see across the ethereal

border, the tentacle tips all come together in a fused, worm-

like  braid  that  forms  the  dharculuss  body.  The  posterior

end of the cylindrical body loops back toward the front like

a question mark, the end of which is a huge, drooling maw

 lled with razor-sharp teeth. Several tentacles end in eyes

instead of maws, which the entity keeps safely ethereal to

search the Material Plane for its next meal.

Dharculus

112

The dharculus is a creature from an alternate reality far

from  the  Material  Plane,  and  perhaps  beyond  the  planar

cosmology  as  it  is  presently  understood.  It  may  be  that

these creatures are dependent on some element from their

unknown  place  of  origin;  however,  reports  indicate  that

more  and  more  of  these  creatures  are  hunting  along  the

shoals of corporeal planes.

A dharculus does not speak.

COMBAT

A  dharculuss  dual-plane  existence  provides  it  excep-

tional protection against its prey, while it is free to attack

most potential victims with impunity, first by establish-

ing a hold with a small mawed tentacle, then by bringing

its otherwise intangible ethereal bite into play.

Dualplanar  (Ex):  The  bulk  of  a  dharculuss  body

resides on the Ethereal Plane, but the mon-

ster  possesses  the  capacity  to  insert  or

remove its mawed tentacle ends into

or  out  of  the  Material  Plane  as

a  standard  action.  Creatures

that  are  stuck  on  the  Mate-

rial Plane  nd it dif cult but

not  impossible  to  target

the  dharculus.  Because

the  monster  is  dual-

planar  and  therefore

exists  partially  on  the

Material  Plane  while  its

tentacles  are  inserted,

its  foes  on  the  Mate-

rial  Plane  can  attack

the  creature  as  if  it  had

cover, and so it gains a +4

bonus to Armor Class and

a +2 bonus on Re ex saves. A

dharculus  can  take  a  standard

action to remove its tentacles from

the  Material  Plane,  allowing  it  to

effectively retreat completely into the

Ethereal Plane.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this

ability,  a  dharculus  must  hit  a  Small

or  larger  creature  with  its  tentacle

attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to  start

a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  pro-

voking  an  attack  of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple

check,  it  establishes  a  hold  and  attaches  the  tentacle  to

the opponent.

After a successful grab, a dharculus can try to attach its

remaining tentacles with a single grapple check. The oppo-

nent can escape with a successful grapple check or Escape

Artist  check,  but  the  dharculus  gets  a  +2  circumstance

bonus for every tentacle that was attached at the beginning

of the opponents turn.

5/20/04, 1:06:23 PM

Ethereal Bite (Ex): A dharculus that begins a turn with

all six tentacles attached and that makes a successful grapple

check automatically makes an ethereal bite (biting with its

enormous, body-sized maw, which is normally relegated to

the  Ethereal  Plane),  dealing  6d6+1  points  of  damage.  The

maw and main body of the creature remain only a threaten-

ing thickness in the air even when the bite is delivered, so

the sudden jerking and wounding of a victim become all the

more unsettling to the victims compatriots.

Millennia ago, the frost giants of the Ice Wastes of the Abyss

enslaved a tribe of duergar and brought them to their home

to craft armor and weapons. All but the hardiest perished,

and those who survived gradually changed, becoming more

like their frost giant masters. Now, frost dwarves toil away

in  the  mines  and  forges  of  the  Ice  Wastes,  plotting  their

liberationand their revenge.

COMBAT

Like  other  dwarves,  frost  dwarves  use  their  environment

to its fullest, though they only rarely plan out their attacks

in advance. Frost dwarves hurl themselves into every battle

with reckless abandon, hacking away with their axes until

no enemies are left. In close combat, frost dwarves some-

times cast aside their battleaxes and attempt to grapple their

foes into submission, using their chill touch spell-like ability

to help take the  ght out of their enemies (and later ransom-

ing their prisoners for a hefty pro t). If outmatchedor if

they simply wish to remain hiddenfrost dwarves use their

obscuring mist spell-like ability to confuse their enemies and

cover their escape. (The frost dwarves may not be able to see

through the mist themselves, but they know the layout of

their mines and tunnels.)

Frost Dwarf Traits (Ex): Frost dwarves have the follow-

ing racial traits.

 +4 Constitution, 4 Charisma.

 Medium size.

 Darkvision out to 120 feet.

 Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison.

 Resistance to cold 10.

 Stability: Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their

feet. A dwarf has a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist

being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground

(but not when climbing,  ying, riding, or otherwise not

standing  rmly on the ground).

 +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like

abilities  (*not  reflected  in  the  saving  throw  numbers

given here).

 +1 racial bonus on attack rolls and +4 dodge bonus to

Armor Class against creatures of the giant type (such as

ogres, trolls, and frost giants).

scuring  mist  as  a  wiz-

ELEMENTITE SWARM

Swarms of barely sentient elementals inhabit the Elemental

Planes corresponding to their types. Elementite swarms are

actually premature forms of standard elementals. On aver-

age, one or two individual elementites in each swarm may

eventually grow up to be Small elementals.

COMBAT

Elementite swarms have very little intelligence. Like all

swarms,  they  attack  by  moving  into  an  opponents  space,

provoking an attack of opportunity. An elementite swarm

can occupy the same space as an opponent of any size, but it

remains a creature with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make

attacks of opportunity.

Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, an elemen-

tite swarm is shapeable. It can occupy any four contiguous

5-foot squares, and it can squeeze through any space large

enough to contain a Tiny creature.

Elemental Traits: An elementite swarm has immunity

to poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, and stunning. It is

not subject to extra damage from critical hits or  anking.

The  individual  elementites  cannot  be  raised,  reincarnated

or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or true

resurrection spell can restore life). An elementite swarm has

darkvision out to 60 feet.

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and

no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to extra damage

from critical hits or  anking.

Reducing a swarm to 0 or fewer hit points causes it to

break up, though damage taken until that point does not

degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are

never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also,

they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they

cannot grapple other creatures.

A swarm has immunity to any spell or effect that targets a

speci c number of creatures (including single-target spells

such  as  disintegrate).  A  swarm  takes  half  again  as  much

damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such

as many evocation spells and splash weapons.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a swarms

damage that begins its turn with a swarm in its square is

nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarms

HD + swarms Con modi er) negates the effect. Spellcast-

ing or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm

requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using

skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC

20 Concentration check.

Combat

Air elementite swarms wander the Elemental Plane of Air like

agitated clouds. Sometimes several swarms group together,

making the air thick with the tiny elementites. They seek

out and harass anything that is not an air elemental.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty on

attack and damage rolls against an air elementite swarm.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to a

swarms damage that begins its turn with an air elemen-

Combat

Fire elementite swarms enjoy burning things. Even though

theyre more curious than malicious, their limited intelli-

gence usually prevents them from understanding attempts

at communication made by living targets.

Burn  (Ex):  A  fire  elementite  swarms  attack  deals

damage as well as extra  re damage from the diminutive

elementals  aming bodies. Those swarmed by  re elemen-

tites also must succeed on a DC 15 Re ex save or catch on

Creatures  hitting  a   re  elementite  swarm  with  natural

weapons or unarmed attacks take  re damage as though hit

by the swarm, and also catch on  re unless they succeed on

a Re ex save.

Water elementite swarms live and learn by exploring crea-

tures  by  swarming  all  over  them.  They  are  a  signi cant

threat to visitors to the Elemental Plane of Water.

Distraction  (Ex):  Any  living  creature  vulnerable  to  a

swarms damage that begins its turn with a water elemen-

tite  swarm in its square must succeed on a DC 14 For-

titude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is

want  to  go.  Some  elsewhales  have  been  domesticated  to

serve as mounts (see page 72).

Elsewhale

117

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   117

5/20/04, 1:06:49 PM

COMBAT

Wild elsewhales sometimes choose to grab their

foes in a secure bite grapple, shift

to  another  planes  ocean,  then

leave  on  their  own,  allowing

the unfamiliar territory to do in

their enemies.

Carry  Passengers  (Ex):  An

elsewhale  can  carry  up  to  1

Large,  4  Medium,  or  16  Small

creatures  in  its  mouth,  without

swallowing or otherwise endanger-

ing  the  carried  passengers.  Only

willing passengers may be carried

inside  the  mouth  (but  unwill-

ing  creatures  may  be  caught

in  the  bite  grapple).  Creatures

carried within the closed mouth

enjoy  a  breathable  atmosphere

for  the  same  period  of  time  that

the  elsewhale  can  hold  its  breath

(see  below).  When  carried  in  the

creatures mouth or in its bite grapple,

subjects  automatically  fail  their  saving

throw against the elsewhales plane shift spell-

like ability.

Spell-like Abilities: 1 dayplane shift (DC 19), else-

whale  and  passengers  in  mouth  or  grapple  only.  Caster

level 9th.

Blindsight  (Ex):  Elsewhales  can  see  by  emitting

high-frequency  sounds,  inaudible  to  most  other  crea-

tures,  that  allow  them  to  locate  objects  and  creatures

within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces the

elsewhale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as

good as a humans.

Hold Breath (Ex): An elsewhale can hold its breath for a

number of rounds equal to 8  its Constitution score before

it risks drowning.

Skills: An elsewhale has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.

It  can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim  check,  even  if

distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

An elsewhale has a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Listen

checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated.

TRAINING AN ELSEWHALE

Trained elsewhales are highly valued as modes of interpla-

By virtue of their beautiful song, Elysian thrushes contrib-

ute to the overall feeling of joy and contentment that suf-

fuses the Blessed Fields of Elysium.

COMBAT

Elysian thrushes are not combative birds by any means. If

attacked, they are more likely to  ee than to  ght back. But

their gentle song has a sopori c effect that can entrap those

who hear it. These birds are reluctant to completely abandon

their perches, however, and even if chased away, they may

soon return (often within 4d6 rounds).

Elysian  Song  (Su):  The  song  of  an  Elysian  thrush  is

melodic, soothing, and extremely hypnotic. Those within

30 feet who listen to the thrushs song while resting recover

at twice the normal natural healing rate.

However, after 12 hours of listening to the Elysian song,

a character not native to the Blessed Fields of Elysium must

succeed  on  a  DC  12  Will  saving  throw  or  become  com-

pletely uninterested in departing. The character is perfectly

content to remain encamped, and if no one brings her food

and water, she will quietly die of starvation and thirst, con-

tent merely to keep listening to the birds song. She can be

removed forcibly and subsequently returns to normal after

24 consecutive hours of not hearing the Elysian song. Other-

wise, the effect of the song can be broken only by casting a

spell on the victim that stirs up powerful emotions (fear, rage,

or crushing despair, for example), or by slaying all the Elysian

thrushes within hearing.

ENERGON

Until  now,  only  two  types  of  energon  have  been  docu-

mented  by  planar  travelersthe  xag-ya  and  the  xeg-yi,

native  inhabitants  of  the  Energy  Planes  (see  Manual  of

the Planes for details). But other kinds of energons wander

the  multiverse  as  well,  including  the  xac-yij  (acid),  the

xor-yost  (cold),  the  xap-yaup  (electricity),  the  xac-yel

(fire),  and  the  xong-yong  (sonic).  In  the  statistics  given

for  each  kind  below,  the  indicated  environment  is  one

of the more likely places in which to encounter that par-

ticular energon.

The  purpose  of  the  energons  remains  enigmatic.  They

 nd great releases of energy, especially of their particular

type, to be attractive. They congregate at scenes of natural

and  created  cataclysms.  Sometimes  one  will  peacefully

follow a spellcaster whom the energon witnessed casting a

powerful, energy-based spell.

Energons  also  exhibit  curiosity  about  gates  and  portals,

often choosing to go through them, if able. Because of this,

energons can be found on almost any plane, even though the

creatures have no natural ability to travel between planes. A

lone energon can reproduce; energons procreate asexually

by simply advancing to 15 Hit Dice and choosing to split

into three energons of the same kind with 5 HD each. Few

energons advance far enough to produce offspring, so while

energons exist throughout the planes, they remain unusual

and uncommon creatures.

An energon is a translucent globe about 2 feet across that

 oats and shimmers in the air, giving off an aura  tting to its

particular type of energy (acidic, frosty, ozonelike, burning,

or thrumming). A pair of spots on the upper hemisphere of

the globe suggests eyes. Beneath the lower hemisphere of

the globe, six to twelve tentacles dangle and curl. Energons

spread and contract their tentacles when they move, much

as an octopus or squid does.

As incorporeal creatures, energons ignore terrain.

Large amounts of energy of their type will tend to attract

energons.  They  often  lurk,  watching  a  spellcaster  or  crea-

ture who uses energy attacks. They rarely start  ghts, but

occasionally seek to touch other creaturesa very painful

prospect for most.

If in combat with a group of creatures, each type of ener-

gon has a preferred type of target that it will attack, if able.

Energy Ray (Ex): An energons energy ray has a range of

30 feet.

Explosion (Su): If an energon is reduced to 0 hit points,

its body is instantaneously destroyed in an explosion that

deals 1d8+9 points of damage of its energy type to everyone

in a 20-foot-radius burst (Re ex DC 16 half).

Incorporeal Traits: An energon is harmed only by other

incorporeal  creatures,  magic  weapons,  spells,  spell-like

abilities, and supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source, except for force

effects  or  attacks  made  with  ghost  touch  weapons.  It  can

pass through solid objects, but not force effects, at will. Its

attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but de ec-

tion bonuses and force effects work normally against them.

An incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot

be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Outsider Traits: An energon cannot be raised, reincar-

nated or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle, or

true resurrection spell can restore life). It has darkvision out

to 60 feet.

Energons do not speak, even among themselves.

COMBAT

Energons use their incorporeality to great advantage, retreat-

ing  into  solid  objects  when  attacked.  They  rarely  start  a

combat, but will  ght  ercely if attacked.

Entropic ogre mage

Ogre  mages  favor  loose,  comfortable  clothing  and  light-

weight armor.

Ogre mages speak Giant and Common.

Combat

An  entropic  ogre  mage  relies  on  its  spell-

like  abilities,  just  as  a  regular  ogre  mage

does, but is more liable to resort to physical

combat due to its imposing negative energy

aura.  Nevertheless,  when  faced  with

obviously  superior  forces,  it  prefers  to

retreat using gaseous form rather than  ght

a losing battle.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdark-

ness, invisibility; 1/daycharm person (DC

14), cone of cold (DC 18), gaseous form, poly-

morph, sleep (DC 14). Caster level 9th.

Flight  (Su):  An  ogre  mage  can  cease

or resume  ight as a free action. While using

gaseous form, it can  y at its normal speed and has

perfect maneuverability.

Regeneration  (Ex):  Fire  and  acid  deal  normal

damage to an ogre mage.

An ogre mage that loses a limb or body part can reattach

it by holding the severed member to the stump. Reattach-

ment takes 1 minute. If the head or some other vital organ

is severed, it must be reattached within 10 minutes or the

creature dies. An ogre mage cannot regrow lost body parts.

CREATING AN ENTROPIC

CREATURE

Entropic is an inherited template that can be added to any

corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid,

magical beast, monstrous humanoid, outsider, plant, undead,

or vermin (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

An entropic creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and abilities except as noted here.

Size  and  Type:  Unless  the  creature  was  undead,  its

type changes to outsider. Do not recalculate the creatures

Hit Dice, base attack bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged.

The creature also gains the extraplanar subtype.

Special  Attacks:  An  entropic  creature  retains all the

special attacks of the base creature and also gains the follow-

ing special attack.

Negative Energy Ray (Su): An entropic creature can  re a

ray of negative energy once every 1d4 rounds with a range

of 60 feet. With a successful ranged touch attack, an entro-

pic creature infuses a target with points of negative energy

damage equal to 1d4 + its Cha modi er. This attack damages

living creatures and heals undead.

Special  Qualities:  An  entropic  creature  has  all  the

special  qualities  of  the  base  creature,  plus  the  following

special qualities.

Limited Spell Resistance (Positive Energy) (Ex): An entropic

creature has spell resistance equal to 15 + Hit Dice (maximum

This creature looks like a big, demonic human. It has green

skin, dark hair, and a pair of short ivory horns protruding from

its forehead. Its eyes are dark with strikingly white pupils, and

its teeth and claws are jet black.

An entropic ogre mage looks like a standard ogre mage,

but is much more deadly. The negative energy powers it

possesses  enable  it  to  better  indulge  its  rapacious  and

cruel nature.

An entropic ogre mage is identical in measurements to

its Material Plane cousin. It stands about 10 feet tall and

weighs up to 700 pounds. Its skin varies in color from light

green  to  light  blue,  and  its  hair  is  black  or  dark  brown.

that  uses  positive  energy,  including

cure spells.

Negative  Adaptation  (Ex):  Entropic

creatures do not lose hit points or need

to make Fortitude saves due to being in

a negative-dominant environment.

Negative Energy Aura (Su): Any living

creature within 10 feet of an entropic

creature loses 1 hit point per round due to

the aura of negative energy surrounding it. Char-

acters with immunity to negative energy effects, as well

as other entropic creatures, are not affected by this aura. If

conscious, an entropic creature can repress this aura as a

standard action, but takes 1 point of Strength damage for

each full minute that the aura is inactive. The aura is always

functioning while an entropic creature is unconscious.

Outsider Traits: An entropic creature cannot be raised,

reincarnated or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish,

miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore life). It has dark-

vision out to 60 feet.

Turn Resistance (Ex): An undead entropic creature has +4

turn resistance.

Constitution +2, Charisma +2. Intelligence is at least 3.

Environment: The Negative Energy Plane or same as

Plane  Shift  (Su):  Although  it  has  superb  and  impos-

ing antlers, a gaspar has an even more remarkable defense

mechanism:  It  can  make  its  foes  go  away.  If  engaged  in

melee combat and seriously wounded or threatened (usually

if reduced to half of its hit points), a gaspar activates its plane

shift defense. Everyone within a 10-foot radius of the gaspar

must make a DC 16 Will save or be transported to a random

plane (see Table 57, page 151 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

All creatures caught in the same burst go to the same plane.

The gaspar and any rider it bears are not transported.

Once  a  gaspar  uses  its  plane  shift  ability,  it  cant  do  so

again  until  1d4  rounds  later.  A  gaspar  can  plane  shift  a

maximum of four times per day.

Powerful Charge (Ex): A gaspar deals 4d8+16 points of

damage when it makes a charge.

TRAINING A GASPAR

Trained  gaspars  are  highly  valued  as  planar  mounts,  but  a

gaspar requires training before it can bear a rider. Training

a  gaspar  requires  six  weeks  of  work  and  a  DC  25  Handle

Animal check. A professional trainer works with a spellcaster

capable of casting plane shift and teleport to train a gaspar.

The pair charges 7,500 gp to train a gaspar.

Riding a gaspar requires an exotic saddle.

A gaspar can  ght while carrying a rider,

but the rider cannot also attack unless he

or she succeeds on a Ride check.

Plane  Shift  (Su):  A  trained

gaspar  can  learn  to  alter  its

plane shift ability. Instead of

the  defensive  10-foot-radius

burst,  it  can  take  itself,  its

rider, and an amount of gear

up  to  its  maximum  load

to  a  plane  speci ed  by

its  rider  (if  the  rider

makes  a  DC  20  Ride

check), as long as it has

been there before. Fail-

ing the Ride check by

5 or more indicates that

the  gaspar  transports  to

a different plane.

Carrying  Capacity:  A

light load for a gaspar is up to

2,076 pounds; a medium load, 2,0774,158 pounds;

and a heavy load, 4,1596,240 pounds.

Countless ages of toil in the deep

mines  of  Dothion,  where  the

walls between the Twin Para-

dises  of  Bytopia  and  the

Elemental  Plane  of  Fire

are  very  thin  indeed,  has

created  a  hybrid  race  that

shares  some  qualities  of

gnome  and  some  of  fire

elemental. Fire gnomes are

exceptionally  resistant  to  heat  and  especially

vulnerable to cold, and though they share some

of the same interests as their cousins the svirfneblin,  re

gnomes are nowhere near as insular and paranoid.

Fire gnomes do not have the innate illusion powers of their

cousins,  but  they  are  capable  of  impressive  effects  with

 re. They frequently give ground, only to devise elaborate

schemes and return later. And also unlike rock gnomes,  re

gnomes have no compunctions about killingespecially in

defense of their mines and tunnels. Adept at spotting incen-

diaries and explosives carried by opponents,  re gnomes

are all too happy to start fires (which have no effect on

them, of course) in hopes of setting off an opponents own

supply  of  explosivesand  thus  letting  the  fire  gnomes

defeat their foes with only minimal effort.

Fire Gnome Traits (Ex): Fire gnomes have the follow-

ing racial traits.

 +2 Constitution, 2 Strength.

 Small: As Small creatures,  re gnomes have a +1 bonus

to Armor Class, a +1 bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 bonus

on Hide checks. They use smaller weapons than Medium

characters  use,  and  their  lifting  and  carrying  limits  are

three-quarters of those of a Medium character.

 A  re gnomes base land speed is 20 feet..

 Darkvision out to 60 feet.

  Stonecunning:  This  ability  grants  fire

gnomes a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to

notice unusual stonework. A  re gnome who

merely comes within 10 feet of unusual

stonework can make a Search check

as  though  actively  searching,  and

can use the Search skill to  nd

stonework traps as a rogue can.

A   re  gnome  can  also  intuit

depth,  sensing  the  approxi-

mate  distance  underground  as

naturally  as  a  human  can  sense

which way is up.

  +2  bonus  to  caster  level

when  casting  spells  or  using

spell-like abilities with the  re

descriptor.

 Immunity to  re and

vulnerability to cold.

  +1  racial  bonus  on

attack rolls against kobolds

and goblin oids (including

goblins,  hobgoblins,  and

bugbears).

  +4  dodge  bonus

to  Armor  Class  against

creatures of the giant type

(such as ogres, trolls, and

hill giants).

  Spell-Like  Abilities:

seek out slaadi in particularthe bigger the

better  (making  blue  or  green  slaadi  the

preferred targets). This is because Limbo

stalkers  lay  their  eggs  in  the  rotting

carcasses  of  other  creatures,  giving

their young something to feed

on  the  moment  they  hatch,

and the corpse of a slaad lasts

much  longer  than  that  of  a

stringy githzerai.

COMBAT

Limbo  stalkers  have  enor-

mous  amounts  of  patience

and  usually  hunt  by  hiding

somewhere near where their

prey  travels.  Using  their

limited  invisibility  ability

to  camou age  themselves,  Limbo

stalkers wait for just the right opportu-

nity to strike: a lone traveler, not paying

any particular attention to his surroundings,

and passing within 40 feet of a lurking Limbo

stalker.  The  Limbo  stalker  then  lurches  out  of  its

concealment,  bull  rushing  the  target  into  a  solid  object

(sometimes,  the  very  ground  that  the  target  has  shaped

to stand on). Once the target is prone, the Limbo stalker

launches a  urry of claw and bite attacks until the target,

or the stalker, is dead.

When  these  creatures  hunt  in  numbers,  one  Limbo

stalker acts as the pack leader, by some understood agree-

ment. In such cases, the pack attempts the same basic tactic,

except that only one stalker (the leader) attempts the bull

rush. The others come out of concealment only if the attack

succeeds or if the target, in escaping, strays too close to one

of the concealed stalkers to resist launching a second attack.

Only when the target is dispatched will any Limbo stalkers

still in concealment emerge to lope off with the others or

help carry the prize.

A Limbo stalkers claw and bite attacks, as well as any

weapons  it  wields,  are  treated  as  chaotic-aligned  for  the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Limited  Invisibility  (Ex):  Just  as  other  predators  use

their environments as camou age, a Limbo stalker is able

to exert its will over its immediate surroundings in Limbo

to conceal its own presence. By making a DC 16 Wisdom

check as a free action, a Limbo stalker can wrap itself in an

area of controlled Limbo so that it seems to vanish. If this

check fails, a Limbo stalker can attempt the check once per

round  as  a  free  action.  Once  a  Limbo  stalker  establishes

control, it need not check again.

This effect ends the moment the Limbo stalker moves or

attacks. It likewise ends if another sentient creature exerts

control  over  the  same  area  of  Limbo  and  uncovers  the

Limbo stalker.

Lesser  nightmares  are  as  evil  as  their  more  well-known

brethren, but not as accomplished at plane-hopping.

A lesser nightmare is about the size of a light warhorse.

Lesser nightmares understand Infernal and Abyssal, but

speak no languages themselves.

COMBAT

Biting with its viperish fangs and kicking with its powerful

legs is a lesser nightmares best option in a  ght. A lesser

nightmare  can   ght  while  carrying  a  rider,  but  the  rider

cannot also  ght unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.

A lesser nightmares natural weapons, as well as any weap-

ons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction.

Flaming Hooves (Su): A blow from a lesser nightmares

hooves sets combustible materials alight.

Smoke (Su): During the excitement of battle, a lesser

nightmare snorts and neighs with rage. This snorting  lls

a  15-foot  cone  with  a  hot,  sulfurous  smoke  that  chokes

and blinds opponents. Anyone in the cone must succeed

on a DC 16 Fortitude save or take a 2 penalty on all attack

rolls and damage rolls until 1d6 minutes after leaving the

cone. The cone lasts for 1 round, and a nightmare uses it

once as a free action during its turn each round. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

Because of the smoke it gives off, a nightmare

has concealment against creatures 5 feet away

and total concealment against creatures 10 feet

or farther away. The smoke does not obscure

the nightmares vision at all.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for

a  lesser  nightmare  is  up  to  300  pounds;

a  medium  load,  301600  pounds;  and  a

heavy load, 601900 pounds.

Skills:  A  lesser  nightmare

always  knows  where  true  north

lies in relation to itself.

BLACKGUARDS AND

LESSER NIGHTMARES

A lesser nightmare makes a  ne

 endish  servant  for  a  black-

guard.  Reduce  the  bonus

Hit Dice gained by the lesser

nightmare  by  2  (for  example,  a

lesser  nightmare  that  serves  a

blackguard  with  a  character

bonus  Hit  Dice).  Treat  the

blackguards character level as

5/20/04, 1:07:57 PM

A shadow jelly is a nonsentient shadow driven by a desire

to feed on life and light. As concentrated shadow-stuff, it is

not incorporeal, as undead shadows are; its touch is some-

what more solid, and it can engulf prey like oozes from the

Material Plane can. But rather than dissolving its prey with

digestive acids, a shadow jelly drains all the warmth and life

from its target.

A shadow jelly naturally seeks out the darkest place it can

 nd,  so  it  can  be  dif cult  to  see.  But  because  of  its  size,  it

stands out even in dark or gloomy areas, where it appears to

be a large patch of deeper darkness. In places of bright illumi-

nation, the presence of a shadow jelly is painfully obvious.

Mindless and always hungry, a shadow jelly is an aggres-

sive predator with no fear of multiple opponents. It attacks

such  opponents  one  after  the  other,  though  it  tends  to

ignore opponents at least as large as itself.

A shadow jelly has no language and does not speak.

COMBAT

Shadow  jellies  lurk  in  the  darkest  of  dark  places,  waiting

for living prey to happen by. On the Plane of Shadow, they

gravitate toward the darklands, from where they originate.

When prey presents itself, a shadow jelly lurches forward

out of hiding, seeking to get a grip on its opponent. Once

it has caught a foe, a shadow jelly withdraws to its hiding

place, even if it is still under attack. It changes tactics only

if it loses its grip on its foe.

Strength Damage (Su): The touch of a shadow jelly deals

1d6  points  of  Strength  damage  to  a  living  foe.  A  creature

reduced to Strength 0 by a shadow jelly dies. This is a nega-

tive energy effect.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a shadow jelly

must hit with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start

a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  an  attack  of

opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it  establishes

a  hold  and  can  automatically  deal  1d6  points  of  Strength

damage each round.

Skills: *A shadow jelly gains a +12 racial bonus on Hide

checks in areas of shadowy illumination. A shadow jelly

has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb  checks

and can always choose to take 10 on a

Climb  check,  even  if

rushed or threatened.

Shadow jelly

COMBAT

A lone pack  end uses stealth to approach a target, pouncing

the very moment the target becomes aware of the pack  ends

presenceor when, aware or not, the target is unable to escape.

Multiple pack  ends prefer hit-and-run tactics, making quick

slashes at the target in one round, then withdrawing in the

next, so that the target is never quite sure where the next attack

will come from. Whenever possible, pack  ends band together

to take targets down one at a time, moving on to the next for

only when the current target stops twitching.

A pack  ends natural weapons are treated as evil-aligned

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 18, initial damage 1d6

Strength, secondary damage 2d6 Strength. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

Pounce (Ex): When a pack  end makes a charge, it can

follow with a full attack.

Skills: Pack  ends gain a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Move

Silently, and Survival checks.

TRAINING A PACK FIEND

Trained  pack   ends  are  highly  valued  as  hunting  beasts.

A pack  end requires training before it can hunt on com-

mand. Training a pack  end requires six weeks of work and

a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

An elemental spirit unlike any other, the unraveler is born of

opposition. Where the Inner Planes have borders, unravelers

thrive. Unravelers have been called menglis in the past, but

whatever they are called, it is accepted that they are dangerous

entities to encounter while traveling the Inner Planes.

Unravelers do not speak.

COMBAT

Unravelers are violently opposed to mixed elements. Most

material  creatures  and  their  equipment  possess  just  this

sort of mixture that unravelers seek to undo. Their attack

delivers a disjoining touch, which causes a victim to begin

separating into its basic elements.

Disjoin (Su): A blow from a unraveler against a creature

can cause the target to begin to separate into its component

elements.  A  creature  must  succeed  on  a  DC  15  Fortitude

save  or  immediately  take  2d8  points  of  damage.  Unless  a

130

creature manages to control the effect (see below), it unrav-

els over the course of 2d4 rounds, until it has decomposed

into a few pounds of minerals and a pool of liquid. The save

DC is Constitution-based.

An  affected  character  feels  searing  pain  coursing

along  his  nerves,  so  strong  that  the  victim  cannot  act

coherently.  The  victim  cannot  cast  spells,  manifest

psionic  powers,  or  use  magic  items,  and  he  attacks

blindly,  unable  to  distinguish  friend  from  foe

(4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance,

regardless of the attack roll).

Each round the victim spends decomposing, he

takes an additional 2d8 points of damage. When

2d4 rounds of decomposition have passed, the

victim  completely  separates  into  compo-

nent elements (and is, of course, dead).

A victim can try to hold together by

attempting a DC 15 Charisma check

(this  check  DC  does  not  vary  for

unravelers with different Hit Dice

or ability scores). A success halts

the  decomposition  for  24  hours.

On a failure, the victim can still

repeat this check each round until successful.

Disjoining is not a disease or a curse and so is

hard to remove. A shapechange spell does not cure

an  af icted  creature  but   xes  its  form  for  the

duration of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater

restoration spell removes the af iction.

Elemental Immunity (Ex): An unrav-

eler  has  immunity  to  naturally  occurring

damaging  conditions  on  the  Elemental

Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, and Water.

This horselike creatures hide seems to shimmer, changing from

white to dark gray as you watch.

UrEpona, also known as Eponas grandchildren, are horse-

like creatures that can move from plane to plane. Descended

through several generations from Epona (a being variously

described as a horse-goddess or even the Primal Horse), they

derive their power from her.

A creature without any predetermined color, this equines

hide changes color with its mood, ranging from pure glis-

tening white to deep sable.

UrEpona do not speak, but can understand any language

spoken to them.

COMBAT

An urEpona seeks to avoid combat when possible, though

it defends itself and its offspring with dedication. Its hoof

attack is treated as a secondary attack and adds only 1/2 the

urEponas Strength bonus to damage.

Plane Shift (Sp): Once per day, an urEpona can use plane

shift,  taking  itself  and  its  rider  to  the  plane  of  its

choice. An unwilling rider can resist with a

DC 17 Will save. Caster level 9th.

TRAINING AN

UREPONA

Although  intelligent,

an urEpona requires

training  before  it

can  bear  a  rider

in  combat.  To

be  trained,  an

urEpona  must

have  a  friendly

attitude  toward

the  trainer  (this

can  be  achieved

through  a  suc-

cessful  Diplo-

macy  or  wild

empathy  check).

Training a friendly

urEpona  requires

six  weeks  of  work  and

a  DC  25  Handle  Animal

check. Riding an urEpona

requires  a  normal  saddle.

An  urEpona  can  fight

while  carrying  a  rider,  but  the  rider  cannot  also

attack unless he succeeds on a Ride check.

An urEpona can be taught to use its plane shift spell-like

ability to travel to a plane of the riders choice. Treat this as

the same as teaching the urEpona a trick; it requires one

week of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for an urEpona is up to

200 pounds; a medium load, 201400 pounds; and a heavy

load, 401600 pounds. An urEpona can drag 3,000 pounds.

VIVACIOUS CREATURE

Vivacious creatures dwell on the Positive Energy Plane. The

vast expanses of the plane are populated by rare creatures

that have adapted to its unusual conditions.

CREATING A VIVACIOUS CREATURE

Vivacious is an inherited template that can be added to any

corporeal aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid,

magical  beast,  monstrous  humanoid,  outsider,  plant,  or

vermin (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

A vivacious creature uses all the base creatures statistics

and abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to outsider.

It gains the incorporeal subtype and the extraplanar sub-

type. Do not recalculate the creatures Hit Dice, base attack

bonus, or saves. Size is unchanged.

This immense, transparent feline is almost as tall at the

shoulder as a human. It has a long body with bold

stripes and paws the size of bucklers.

A vivacious dire tigers

higher-than-animal

intelligence makes

it  aware  of  the  deadly

power  of  its  positive

energy  ray  and  positive  energy

aura when used against hale

and hearty foes.

Against  an  ethe-

real  opponent,  a

dire  tiger  attacks  by

running  at  its  prey,

leaping, and clawing

and biting as it rakes

with its rear claws.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a dire tiger must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

Pounce  (Ex):  If  a  dire  tiger  charges,  it  can  make  a  full

attack, including two rake attacks.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +18 melee, damage 2d4+4.

Skills:  Dire  tigers  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide  and

Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy under-

growth (not likely on the Positive Energy Plane), the Hide

bonus improves to +8.

Speed:  A  vivacious  crea-

ture  gains  a   y  speed  equal

to  its  base  land  speed  with

perfect maneuverability.

Armor Class: A vivacious

creature  loses  all  natural

armor  bonuses,  but  gains

a  de ection  bonus  equal

to its Charisma modi er or

+1, whichever is higher.

Attack: A vivacious

creature retains all the

attacks  of  the  base  creature,

although  those  relying  on

physical contact do not affect

nonethereal creatures.

Special  Attacks:

A  vivacious  creature

retains  all  the  special

attacks  of  the  base

creature, although those

relying on physical contact

do  not  affect  nonethereal

creatures. It also gains the

following special attack.

Positive Energy Ray (Su):

A  vivacious  creature  can   re  a

positive energy ray once every 1d4

rounds  with  a  range  of  60  feet.

With a successful ranged touch attack,

the vivacious creature infuses a target with positive energy

equal to 1d4 + its Cha modi er. This attack damages undead

and heals living creatures. Creatures that exceed their full

normal hit points from this effect need to make Fortitude

saves as if in a positive-dominant environment.

Special Qualities: A vivacious creature has all the spe-

cial qualities of the base creature. In addition, it gains the

following special qualities.

Fast Healing (Ex): Vivacious creatures regain hit points at a

rate of 5 hit points per round.

Limited Spell Resistance (Negative Energy) (Ex): A vivacious

creature has spell resistance equal to 15 + Hit Dice (maxi-

mum 35) against any spell or spell-like ability that uses nega-

tive energy, including in ict spells.

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   132

5/20/04, 1:08:15 PM

Outsider Traits: A vivacious creature cannot be raised, rein-

carnated, or resurrected (though a limited wish, wish, miracle,

or true resurrection spell can restore life). It has darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Positive Adaptation (Ex): Vivacious creatures do not exceed

their full normal hit points or need to make Fortitude saves

due to being in a positive-dominant environment.

Positive Energy Aura (Su): Any living creature within 10

feet of a vivacious creature gains 1 hit point per round due

to  the  aura  of  positive  energy  surrounding  it.  Creatures

that exceed their full normal hit points from this effect

need to make Fortitude saves as if in a positive-dominant

environment. Creatures with immunity to positive energy

effects, as well as other vivacious creatures, are not affected

by this aura. If conscious, a vivacious creature can sup-

press this aura as a standard action, but the creature takes

1 point of Strength damage for each full minute that the

aura is inactive. The aura always functions while the crea-

ture is unconscious.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows:

Constitution +2, Charisma +2. Intelligence is at least 3.

As an incorporeal creature, a vivacious creature has no

Strength score.

Environment: Positive Energy Plane.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: 3 HD or fewer, as the base creature

An area of darkness blacker than black seems to absorb light. It

vaguely resembles a great flying black slug.

Void oozes frequently live in areas of doldrums, often cohab-

itating  with  undead  that  tend  to  leave  them  unmolested.

Some intelligent undead will cultivate a void ooze and use

its  negative  energy  touch  to  repair  damage  to  themselves

and their minions.

COMBAT

A void ooze vigorously attacks living creatures with its slam

attack and energy drain ability.

Death Ward (Su): A void ooze is protected by a

death ward effect at all times, giving it immunity to

death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and

any negative energy effects.

Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit

by a void oozes slam attack gain one negative

level. A void ooze gains 5 temporary hit points for

each negative level it bestows.

Engulf (Ex): As a standard action, a void ooze

can  move  over  opponents,  affecting  as  many  as  it

can cover. Opponents can make attacks of oppor-

tunity against the ooze, but if they do so, they are

not entitled to a saving throw. Those who do not

attempt attacks of opportunity must succeed on a

DC 20 Reflex save or be engulfed; on a success, they

are pushed back or aside (their choice) as the ooze moves

forward.  Engulfed  creatures  are  subject  to  the  oozes

negative  energy  damage  and  energy  drain  each  round,

and are considered to be grappled and trapped within its

body. The save DC is Strength-based.

Shadow  Shield  (Su):  A  void  ooze  is  surrounded  at  all

times by a mass of  itting black shadows (the equivalent of

a darkness spell, but only covering the void ooze itself). This

provides the void ooze with concealment.

In  addition,  the  shield  is  infused  with  negative  energy.

Any creature striking the void ooze with a natural weapon or

a handheld weapon takes 1d8 points of damage, as does any

creature struck by the void ooze. Creatures wielding reach

weapons, such as longspears, are not subject to this damage.

Creatures with immunity to negative energy effects take no

damage from this effect, and undead are healed of damage

instead of injured (as by an in ict spell).

Split  (Ex):  If  a  void  oozes  energy  drain  attack  would

increase its hit points to 200 or more, it instead splits into

two void oozes, each with 100 hit points, as a free action. The

new ooze appears adjacent to its parent. If no space is avail-

able, it cannot spawn on this turn (but will do so as soon as

space is available).

Ooze Traits: An ooze is blind (blindsight 60 feet) and

has immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and

other attack forms that rely on sight. It has immunity to

poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, and poly-

morph. It is not subject to extra damage from critical hits

or  anking.

NEW CREATURES

AND SUMMON SPELLS

When you, as the DM, incorporate the material in this book

into  your  campaign,  youll   nd  it  worthwhile  to  give  some

thought to the new creatures and the summoning spells. First,

bear in mind that the summon spells in the Players Handbook

are balanced, both by the level of power of a particular creature

and by the resources available to casters of the spell. With each

summon monster or summon natures ally spell, a spellcaster has

an  intentionally  limited  repertoire  of  options.  Clerics  and

druids  face  additional  restrictions  based  on  alignment  (for

instance, good clerics cant summon evil creatures).

If you ignore these built-in limitations, the spells simply

become  too  good  for  their  level.  Does  this  mean  that  you

cant  add  new  monsters  to  the  list?  Certainly  notbut  it

does mean that you should take care. For each creature you

add to a spellcasters summoning options, consider the role

it will ful ll. Is it exceptionally mobile? A good spellcaster?

A  big  bruiser?  Take  away  a  monster  of  comparable  power

that ful lls that (or an equally important) role.

Table  62,  below,  describes  where  the  new  monsters  in

this  book  best   t  on  the  summoning  lists.  The  table  also

offers  a  recommendation  about  which  creature  each  new

monster should replace; however, you have the  nal say.

For templates, the replacement works a little differently

(see  Table  61).  At  your  discretion,  a  caster  can  choose  to

replace  all  celestial  or   endish  creatures  on  his  summon

monster  lists  with  creatures  bearing  one  of  the  new  tem-

plates in this book. The caster loses the ability to summon

monsters  with  the  template  that  is  replaced,  but  adds

creatures with the new templates in those places. In some

cases, the spell level required to summon a speci c creature

changes, because the new template is more powerful than

the old. For instance, when adding entropic creatures to the

summon monster lists, the entropic creature appears at a spell

level one level higher than the celestial or  endish creature

it is replacing. Thus, a spellcaster could use summon monster

III to summon an entropic wolf.

The  caster  cant  replace  a  template  of  creatures  that  he

couldnt summon due to his alignment, nor can he bring in

a template of creatures he cant summon for that reason. For

instance, a lawful good cleric cant replace  endish creatures

with axiomatic creatures, since his alignment precludes him

from  summoning   endish  (evil)  creatures,  nor  could  he

replace celestial creatures with anarchic creatures, since his

alignment precludes him from summoning chaotic creatures.

He could replace celestial creatures with vivacious creatures.

he planes are new worlds, alternate realities, and

dimensions other than the Material Plane. Rules of

gravity, magic, and common sense can be radically dif-

ferent on the planes, which makes adventure in these

locales all the more memorable, if dangerous.

Alternative  planes  are  harder  to   nd  than  your  average

hidden shrine, lost continent, or buried ruin. Thats part of

their appeal. But other planes can be reached, if characters

know where to look for them. New dimensions may exist just

behind a magic mirror, on the other side of an ancient portal,

or beyond a  ery elemental rift. Mostly, it is up to the Dun-

geon Master to make available these routes to other realms,

but this book seeks to change that situation somewhat. With

this guide to the planes, characters (and players) will discover

that they have greater powers to affect their own planar dis-

position than they may have thought possible.

COSMOLOGY OVERVIEW

The  various  planes  of  existence  in  the  D&D  cosmology

follow the Great Wheel model. The Great Wheel is a straight-

forward  concept.  The  world  of  reality  that  most  people

think of as the only plane of existence is called the Material

Plane. The Material Plane is coexistent with the dreamlike

Ethereal Plane, which means the two planes occupy the same

space, but it is coterminous with the Astral Plane, which

means that the Material and the Astral share a common

border. For inhabitants of the Material Plane, the Astral

Plane is the gateway to the divine Outer Planes and the

elemental Inner Planes. When you throw in the many

other  extradimensional  spaces  known  as  demiplanes,

the Great Wheel model describes the multiverse in all

its in nity.

THE MATERIAL PLANE

The  Material  Plane  is  the  world  that  hosts  most

D&D  campaigns.  It  is  the  most  Earthlike  of  all

planes and operates under the same set of natural

laws that our own real world does. Even though the

Material Plane is a comfortable place for PCs, it is

a  strange  and  dangerous  environment  for  many

creatures that are native to other planes but  nd

themselves on the Material Plane at least tempo-

rarily (perhaps as the result of a summon monster

spell or similar magic).

THE TRANSITIVE PLANES

Transitive  planes  are  used  to  get  from  one  place  to

another;  however,  many  natives  of  the  transitive

planes rarely  nd it necessary to venture from their

135

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   135

5/20/04, 1:08:41 PM

strange realms. There are three so-called transitive planes: the

Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.

The  Astral  Plane  is  a  conduit  to  all  other  planes,  while

the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both serve as

means of transportation within the Material Plane theyre

connected to. These planes have the strongest regular inter-

action  with  the  Material  Plane  and  are  often  accessed  by

using various spells.

Travelers  within  the  most  interconnected  transitive

plane,  the  Astral  Plane,  may   nd  it  bene cial  to  visit  the

city of Tunarath (see Planar Metropolises)provided they

take the proper precautions.

THE OUTER PLANES

Deities make their homes on the Outer Planes, as do demons,

devils, and angels. Each of the seventeen Outer Planes has

an  alignment,  representing  a  particular  moral  or  ethical

outlook, and the natives of each plane tend to behave in

agreement with that planes alignment. The Outer Planes

are  also  the   nal  resting  place  of  souls  from  the  Material

Plane, whether that  nal rest takes the form of calm intro-

spection or eternal damnation.

One of the most legendary cities of all lies on the Outer

Planes: the city of Sigil. Planar travelers of all stripes can

 nd pro t there (see Planar Metropolises).

THE INNER PLANES

THE DEMIPLANES

The  Inner  Planes  are  elemental  manifestations,  pure  sub-

stances from which the rest of the multiverse is constructed.

Each Inner Plane is made up predominantly of a single type

of energy or element that overwhelms all others. The natives

of a particular Inner Plane are made of the same energy or

element  as  the  plane  itself.  The  six  Inner  Planes  are  the

Elemental Plane of Air, the Elemental Plane of Earth, the

Elemental Plane of Fire, the Elemental Plane of Water, the

Negative Energy Plane, and the Positive Energy Plane.

Travelers  who  stray  onto  the  very  dangerous  Elemental

Plane of Fire will probably be best served if they visit the

City of Brass (see Planar Metropolises), assuming they have

leave to do so.

Demiplanes  are  extradimensional  spaces  that  function

like planes but have measurable size and limited access.

Other  kinds  of  planes  are  theoretically  in nite  in  size,

but a demiplane might be only a few hundred feet across.

Some  demiplanes  are  easily  reached  through  portals,

while  others  may  be  more  dif cult  to  enter.  Generally,

access  to  a  demiplane  is  limited  to  a  particular  location

(such as a  xed gateway) or a particular situation (such as

a time of year or a weather condition). Some demiplanes

DM GUIDANCE: A PLANAR CAMPAIGN

The multiverse is a big place. Whether youre starting a new

planar campaign from scratch or adding planar locations to an

existing campaign, here are some tips to keep in mind.

Take it Slow: The planes can easily overwhelm players or DMs

who want to try everything all at once. Dont try to do too much

too soon.

Decide on a Tone: Its your campaign, but the players and DM

work together to create the multiverse. The DM should set an

overall tone for the campaign. Does an event on one plane have

cosmic importance that creates ripples through several others,

or do the planes work very independently?

As an example, the PLANESCAPE Campaign Setting (published

several years ago) adopted a very specific tone where all that is

interesting happens in threes. Most adventures revolved around

the city of Sigil (either as a staring point or where the action

takes place). It had a specific lingo, the Cant, which helped make

Sigil feel unique.

One Place at a Time: A DM should feel free to restrict the

scope of known territory and gradually bring in new places as

the campaign grows.

Establish a Base of Operations: Its a good idea for characters

to get to know one location fairly well. The city of Sigil provides

the friendliest starting point and is the most hospitable to those

new to the planes. Tunarath and the City of Brass provide other

interesting destinations, as the three cities all offer very differ-

ent experiences. Union (described in the Epic Level Handbook)

makes an ideal location for high-level epic play.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Consider Alignments: The core DUNGEONS & DRAGONS experi-

ence focuses on the conflict between good and evil. The planes

open up many more opportunities for this conflict or for its

counterpart:  the  clash  between  chaos  and  law.  In  a  planar

campaign, the DM might choose to make the chaos/law axis

the primary one. The multiverse feels very different when lawful

good and lawful evil characters work together to stem the tides

of chaos.

View Each Plane as Unique: How different does each lo-

cation  feel?  The  planes  offer  great  opportunities  to  create

unique  atmospheres,  and  each  plane  should  have  its  own

mood. A visit to Celestia and a visit to the Abyss should share

little in common.

The DM is largely responsible for establishing the atmo-

sphere of each location, but players can help by being open

to the unexpected instead of supposing each place to be like

every other.

Not every locale has an inn at which adventurers of all races

gather to drink ale, socialize, and meet the shady contact for

their  next  adventure.  Most  places  on  the  Inner  Planes  lack

inns and accommodations for travelers. Watering holes on the

Upper Planes or Lower Planes may not allow alcohol, public

gatherings, interspecies fraternization, or the unlicensed com-

missioning of work for hire.

Give each plane its own flavor, and appreciate it for the place

it is. Also, bear in mind that different areas on the same plane

can be substantially different. One glance at the diversity of the

Material Plane is enough to demonstrate that.

even  the  existence  of  these  extradimensional  spaces  is

constantly changing.

Union

A trading city located on a demiplane named Union, formed

eighty years ago, has become known for the extreme volume

of trade moving through its streets, as well as for the excep-

tional abilities of many of its citizens. Union is described at

length in the Epic Level Handbook.

GEOGRAPHY OF THE PLANES

The Dungeon Masters Guide provides a cogent description

of  all  the  planes,  which  serves  as  the  perfect  springboard

for utilizing the information in this book. However, if you

really desire to plumb the depths of all things planar, see

Manual of the Planes for an exhaustive treatment of planar

topics from a DMs perspective.

stomach  the  moral  perversity  of  the  City  of  Brass  should

steer clear.

Those new to the city should ask after Melchoir the Mer-

chant (LE male efreeti, expert 3). Melchoir, a wily creature

who puts business  rst despite his personal hobbies, knows

that all contacts have a seed of potential for future lucrative

contracts.  He  sees  foreign  travelers  who  are  enterprising

and brave enough to visit the fabled City of Brass as likely

to continue their travels and exploits, perhaps gaining great

fame  and  wealth  in  the  process.  And  Melchoir  makes  a

point of staying friends with the wealthy and famous. Its

all about business.

To this end, he offers lavish accommodations and meals

in his mansion for the meager price of 2 gp per day or per

meal. He provides travelers with contacts and additional tips

concerning the City of Brass, though he will never stick his

neck out for his guests should they anger the Grand Sultan

or the Sultans agents.

PLANAR METROPOLISES

From  a  players  perspective,  adventuring  on  the  planes

may at  rst seem a daunting undertaking. While it is true

that lower-level adventurers rarely possess the resources to

branch  out  to  the  planes,  other-planar  explorations  are  in

some  ways  limited  more  by  ignorance  than  ability.  This

section seeks to give characters a few starting points from

which they can get a toehold on the planes.

THE CITY OF BRASS

The City of Brass, home to powerful efreet lords, is found on

the Elemental Plane of Fire. Cradled in a brass hemisphere

40  miles  across,  the  city   oats  above  a  plate  of  cracked

obsidian. Here, trade  ourishes among the Inner Planes. In

addition, travelers and merchants from every corner of the

multiverse conduct business. The Grand Sultan rules from

his  Charcoal  Throne  in  the  Burning  Palace  of  the  Grand

Sultan of All the Efreet at the center of the city.

The city has normal gravity and time. The  re-dominant

trait is suppressed by the will of the ruler, the Grand Sultan.

Travelers Tip: Located on the Elemental Plane of Fire,

the  City  of  Brass  is  an  arti cial  island  free  of  the  planes

 re-dominant trait. Here, travelers and traders can conduct

business, and efreet can grant audiences to those not hard-

ened against the  res. Of course, all travelers need to keep

in mind the lawful evil nature of the placethose who cant

Entering and Exiting the City of Brass

Several interplanar portals connect various parts of the City

of Brass to other planar locations, though most of these por-

tals are privately controlled. If players can locate any land-

ing on the In nite Staircase (see the sidebar), a technique

that often proves useful for  nding the City of Brass is to

follow the staircase that leads in the warmest direction.

Though simplistic, some enchantment laid on the In nite

Staircase grants this method validity, and eventually a land-

ing  will  spit  travelers  out  on  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Fire,

with the towers of the City of Brass visible across the  re-

cracked plain. Unfortunately for them, travelers must cross

the plane before entering the city proper.

City of Brass (Metropolis): Conventional; AL LE; 300,000

gp  limit;  Assets  750,000,000  gp;  Population:  500,000  free

average, noble], 15% mephits [ re, magma, and steam], 15%

3% magmin, 1% thoqqua, 8% other) and 1,000,000 slaves

THE INFINITE STAIRCASE

The  Infinite  Staircase  is  a  mystery.  It  leads  to  all  places,

though the trick is finding an exit. When one finds an open-

ing onto the staircase, the journey usually begins on a small

landing with a nondescript stairway leading off. Travelers on

the  Infinite  Staircase  see  its  appearance  vary  from  simple

stairs of wood or stone to a chaotic jumble of stairs hanging

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

in radiant space, where no two steps share the same gravita-

tional orientation. It is said that a traveler can find her hearts

desire somewhere on the Infinite Staircase if each landing is

searched long enough.

The origin and purpose behind the Infinite Staircase remain a

mystery. It is unknown whether the staircase is truly infinite or

just unimaginably large.

History

The City of Brass is the capital of the efreet civilization.

The  Sultan  or  Sultana  rules  from  the  Charcoal  Palace.

Although  there  have  been  many  different  Sultans  over

the millennia due to natural deaths and coups, little has

actually changed in government beyond the name of the

person in charge.

Architecture

The Districts

Tall spires topped with minarets feature prominently in

the City of Brass. The buildings are made of stone ranging

from sandstone to marble, most of which is imported from

the Elemental Plane of Earth, or of metal, primarily brass,

copper, or iron edged with brass, copper, silver, or gold.

Illumination

The  surrounding  Sea  of  Fire  and  the  many   ery  canals

provide a red glow that dims with distance. To supplement

this  illumination,  torches  are  placed  at  intervals  in  the

lower-class districts, and continual  ame gems brighten the

upper-class areas.

While the area doesnt have weather per se, it does have

a  weatherlike  phenomenon  that  impacts  visibility:  ash

fall.  The  hot  air  from  the  Sea  of  Fire  follows  predictable

thermal  patterns.  Ash  fall  is  localized  and  falls  thickest

and most often on the poorer sections of the city and least

on the wealthiest.

Laws and Society

The  City  of  Brass  has  highly  developed  laws.  Different

laws exist for efreet and nonefreet. Efreet suffer from few

restrictions  on  their  behavior  or  trade.  Nonefreet  must

follow many regulations pertaining to how they conduct

themselves,  how  they  do  business,  and  the  amount  of

money they must pay as tax on their transactions. These

laws are well publicized (posted at the gates and in each

inn or public house) and are relatively simple to follow for

those who wish to obey them. Some of the more obvious

laws prohibit theft, murder, kidnapping, and misrepresen-

tation of goods.

Lawbreakers are sentenced to a period of slavery under

the control of the offended party (often the city itself). The

original length of servitude can be extended for additional

infractions,  ranging  from  speaking  impolitely  to  ones

master  (seven  days  for  a   rst  infraction  or  if  a  year  has

passed since the last infraction) to attempting to escape

(one year plus one year for each day the slave was missing).

Aside  from  breaking  laws,  the  most  common  way  that

visitors to the City of Brass become slaves is by borrow-

ing money and not being able to repay it (and the accrued

interest) in time.

Slaves  must  wear  and  display  bracelets  indicating  their

servitude and their master. Slaves are often bought and sold

during the period of their slavery. Once his or her sentence

is served, the slave again becomes a free person.

Like many other metropolises, the City of Brass is organized

into different districts.

Arches: This areas most notable location is the slave

market.

Ashlarks: Many common efreet live in the Ashlarks area.

Its  most  prominent  feature  is  the  tower  of  Krak  al-Tawil,

also known as the Long Castle, home to the city guard: sala-

manders always ready to stop crime and capture criminals.

Avencina: Avencina is a rowdy, lower-class district where

many races mingle. It contains the Commoners Market, an

open-air bazaar where one can  nd anything and everything

thats nonmagical (though an occasional magic item veiled

with Nystuls magic aura  nds its way into the merchant stalls

here). While buying or selling stolen merchandise is strictly

illegal, one would be hard pressed to explain the presence

of many of the used, secondhand items in any other way.

All merchandise is sold as-is, caveat emptor. Frequently, a

vendor selling in the market one day isnt there the next (or,

at least, not in the same disguise).

Char: The smell of molten metal suffuses this business

district, where metalworking businesses congregate. The

area houses the Red Wyrm Smelter, which has several dif-

ferent slave-operated workshops and re nes great quanti-

ties of ore brought into the city. The Forge of Manacles

makes all the slave bracelets, and Locksmiths Row provides

the fasteners.

Cindersweeps: This neighborhood houses mostly lower-

class, free residents of the city. The only notable features are

the Military Dock, Drydocks, and Krak al-Zinad. Krak al-

Zinad, the Keep of Fire Striking Steel, serves the harbor gar-

risons and trains marines and others in the use of seaborne

weaponry. The area also houses the city- or efreet-owned

interplanar crafts and military personnel. The Naval Yards

offer restricted admittance to the citys canal system via the

Naranj Canal.

The Foundry: Visitors to the city sometimes make the

mistake  of  going  to  the  Foundry  district  in  search  of  the

metalsmiths who actually do business in the Char or Kef-

 nspires.  The  Foundry  is  the  third  most  exclusive  neigh-

borhood  of  the  city,  boasting  large,  ornate  mansions  and

beautiful memorials and tributes to past notable personages.

Efreet  not  well  enough  connected  to  live  near  the  Sultan

in the Furnace or not wealthy enough to live in the Plume

reside  here.  In  addition,  this  is  the  best  neighborhood  in

which nonefreet are permitted to live. The most impressive

and attractive locations in the district are the Plaza of the

Hunters, the Plaza of the Silver Chariot, the Gate of Glory,

and the Fountain of Clearest Azure.

The Furnace: The most exquisite district in the City of

Brass is de nitely the Furnace, a perfect hemisphere with

the Charcoal Palace rising from its center. The Red Pillar

Halls (government of ces) surround the Sultans residence

and accompanying areas, which include the Breath of the

Sultan (an ornate fountain), the Barracks of the Ring of Fire

(the Sultans personal guard), and the Eternal Flame Pavil-

ion (a holy temple sheathed in beaten gold, which is devoted

to the nameless god who consumes all torches).

Iskalat: This district contains public docks for interpla-

nar vessels and those that sail on the Sea of Fire. Entrance

to the harbor is through the Magma Gate. The harbor allows

traders access to the citys canal system. Anyone making his

or her living from vessels (repair, provisioning, or housing

or recreation for travelers) lives and does business here. The

districts  a  lively  one,  with  many  different  races  of  planar

travelers  occupying  the  inns  and  taverns.  The  Octagon,  a

large  public  festhall  run  by  the  Society  of  Sensation  that

used to be a prison, provides entertainment and merriment

at all hours of the day or night.

Kef  nspires: The main feature of this merchant district

is the Street of Steel, where weaponsmiths and armorsmiths

abound. Most of the trade here is regulated by the Azer Steel

Guild,  with  their  of ces  located  in  the  Golden  Tower.  In

recent centuries, the azer secured a pro table commission

from the Sultan and have nearly exclusive rights to oversee

the manufacture and sale of weapon and armor. Many sala-

manders work at these trades here.

Marlgate: Located just south of the Ashlarks and north

of Iskalat, this district holds the warehouses that store all

that is worth having. Here the goods from the holds of

interplanar  ships  gets  bought  and  sold.  The  Dao  Guard

mercenaries  have  their  headquarters  here  in  the  shadow

of Krak al-Tawil.

The Plume: Second in splendor only to the Furnace, the

Plume houses the wealthiest and most noble of the efreet.

Only efreet may own or occupy property in this district.

Magni cent  buildings  overlook  architecturally  splendid

open  courts.  The  district  also  houses  Krak  al-Nayyiran,

the Castle of the Sun and Moon, where the Sultans  nest

legions live and train.

Pyraculum: This area houses the citys market, which is

slightly more upscale than the one found in Avencina. Many

craftsmen live and work here.

Rookery:  The  most  infamous  quarter  of  the  City  of

Brass, this area is renowned throughout the plane as the

single  most  dangerous  and  lawless  area  of  the  city,  where

even the Sultans guards sometimes fear to go. Its gambling

dens, pleasure gardens, and  ghting pits never close.

The Charcoal Palace

The Charcoal Palace is a dark building of basalt that seems

to suck up all the light and  ame around it. Its towers and

domes are golden, brass, and copper. The palace sits on a

small rise overlooking the rest of the city.

It is the home of the court and courtiers, and the center

of  the  military.  The  Sultan  receives  petitioners  here  once

each month. A huge fountain of purple  re roars before the

palace, the sign of the Sultans constant rule and vigilance.

The  re dims and goes out only when the Sultan dies or is

deposed. The new Sultan then relights the  res in a thun-

derous  explosion  of   ame  and  soot  that  can  be  seen  and

heard throughout the city. The fountain is called the Breath

of the Sultan.

SIGIL

The most famous planar metropolis of all is the city of Sigil.

Located at the center of the Outer Planes and built on the

inner surface of an enormous ring, Sigil claims to be the true

crossroads of the multiverse. The city is ruled by the dreaded

Lady of Pain, an enigma credited with enormous power

including the ability to bar divine beings from her realm.

Bards call Sigil the City of Doors due to its large number

of  portals,  but  the  locals  arent  that  poetic.  They  just  call

it the Cage, a name suited to a city thats tough to get into

and  tough  to  leave.  Not  just  physicallythough  unless

you  know  a  little  something  about  portals,  even  thats  a

challengebut emotionally. After all, what could you ever

need  that  you  couldnt   nd  in  Sigil?  The  place  has  every-

thing, and then some. Its a  lthy, noisy place, with smoke-

choked alleyways and crowded streets, but Sigil is alive in a

way that no other city could ever hope to be.

As be ts its paradoxical nature, Sigil is in the center of an

in nite plane (the Concordant Domain of the Outlands),

 oating above an in nitely tall spire and built on the inside

of a gigantic hollow ring of unknown material. The place

has no sun or moon (see Illumination, below) and no real

horizon, and only nave visitors wonder aloud about whats

on the other side of the ground.

The only way in or out of the Cage is through its many

interplanar portals. Locals claim that you can get anywhere

from Sigil if you just know the right portal. While that may

be an exaggeration, it isnt far from the truth. See Entering

and Exiting Sigil, below, for more on the portals that give

the city its reputation as the gateway to everywhere.

Travelers Tip: More so than any other planar metropolis,

Sigil is the least immediately deadly to travelers, no matter

how extreme their philosophies. If you can get to Sigil, it

can serve as the launching pad for further explorations, or as

an end in itself; Sigil is known for its many strange inhabit-

ants, services, and distractions.

Newcomers should hire a guide. Like any large city, Sigil

has its bad parts, and wandering without guidance could

lead into dark alleysor worse. A good guide can help trav-

elers  nd fair-priced inns, places to buy essential materials,

and contacts who can provide needed information. One of

the  best-known  guides  in  Sigil  is  a  tie ing  named  Kylie

(described in more detail below).

lings, and the like], 10% elves, 10% hal ings, 3% dwarves,

Shemeshka the Marauder a.k.a. King of the Cross-Trade,

information broker (NE female arcanaloth).

Entering and Exiting Sigil

Sigil may well hold the honor of being both the best- and

worst-protected  city  in  the  multiverse.  It  has  no  walls  or

gates, so it has nothing to fear from sieges or any of the other

threats that face a typical city. On the other hand, just about

anybody or anything can walk right into the city whenever

he, she, or it pleases through the portals that connect Sigil

to other planes.

The portals arent specially marked, ornate gates, but instead

look  like  average  doorways,  windows,  arches,  manholes,

 replaces, and the like. Thats because thats just what they

are. Any bounded space big enough for somebody to walk or

wriggle throughfrom a sewer entrance to a wardrobe

might double as a portal to another plane.

But a visitor to Sigil need not worry about opening his

bedroom closet and accidentally tumbling through to the

Abyss.  Most  portals  need  a  portal  key  to  activate  them

usually,  a  speci c  object  that  has  some  af nity  for  whats

on the other side, but sometimes merely a word, a gesture,

or the right state of mind. Without the correct key, a portal

is  just  an  open  space.  Many  of  the  citys  natives  are  more

than happy to sell keys to speci c portals, or at least sell the

knowledge of a keys nature.

Some  portals  dont  cooperate  with  the  commercially

minded,  however.  Many  dont  linger  long  enough  to

become  well  known,  and  some  dont  even  lead  to  the

same place twice in a row. But since nobody knows how

to make or control portals, little can be done to improve

the situation.

Furthermore, theres no way around the portals, no spe-

cial back door to get into or out of the Cage. You cant call

or summon creatures into or out of Sigil (even with a gate

spell), nor can you use plane shift to get in or out. You cant

use astral projection, though, strangely enough, the various

teleportation spells work just  ne within Sigil itself. Since

the city resides on the Outer Planes, no connection to the

Ethereal Plane exists. Even the deities themselves cant (or

dont want to) overcome these restrictions.

If  the  DM  allows  it,  a  character  who  makes  a  DC  25

Knowledge (the planes) check knows of at least one portal

on his home plane that purportedly leads to Sigil. Thats not

saying that the portal wont be hard to reach or well guarded,

but the route can be discovered.

Architecture

In most cities, the architecture depends on three factors:

the  building  materials  available,  the  environment,  and

the dominant style and personality of the locals. Sigil has

none of those things, and its architecture demonstrates

that fact amply.

Theres  nothing  to  build  with  in  Sigil.  The  ground,

though  hard  and  sturdy,  isnt  stone,  and  it  crumbles  to

dust when excavated. The place has no trees to turn into

lumber  (the  only  plant  that  seems  to  thrive  in  Sigil  is

razorvine; see below). You cant even dig up sod or mud to

build a crude hut. Every piece of material in every building

on  every  street  is  imported  from  another  plane.  No  two

buildings are made from the same materials or designed

the same way.

Sigil doesnt have much of an environment to shape its

architecture,  either.  It  never  gets  very  hot  or  very  cold,

it  has  no  monsoons  or  tornados,  and  what  does  pass  for

weather  just  tends  to  make  everything  look  gray  and

dingy.  Thus,  since  the  inhabitants  dont  have  to  worry

about their houses surviving the next big storm, they build

whatever kind of structures suit their fancy. Whats more,

they build wherever they like, with no thought to overall

city planning.

Finally,  Sigil  has  no  dominant  style.  The  look  of  the

city  re ects  the  fact  that  its  residents  come  from  every-

where.  Dwarves  build  sturdy  stone  structures  next  to

graceful  elven  villas.  Down  the  street  stands  a  faithful

reproduction  of  an  Abyssal  palace,  and  tucked  into  a

nearby alley is a white marble shrine to Pelor. On top of

that, since its easier to scavenge than to import, half (or

more)  of  the  buildings  in  Sigil  are  ramshackle  affairs

thrown  together  from  the  parts  of  a  dozen  other  con-

structions. The gorgeous darkwood facade of that tavern

probably came from an old elven inn, and its stone  re-

place was carried rock by rock from the ruins of a foundry

twenty-three blocks away.

Illumination

Despite the lack of a sun or moon, Sigil enjoys days and

nights much like any terrestrial city. In the early hours of

the morning, the sky slowly brightens, reaching a peak of

illumination as bright as the noonday sun in a mid-latitude

city (tempered somewhat by the near-perpetual haze). After

peak,  the  illumination  fades  over  the  next  several  hours

until darkness reigns, and then the whole cycle starts over.

With no moon or stars, of course, night in Sigil isnt like

a  typical  country  evening.  If  its  clear,  though,  you  can

usually  make  out  the   ickers  of  torchlight  and  lanterns

from the other side of the city high above (remember, the

citys built on the inside of a ring, so the far side of town is

directly overhead).

All  told,  over  the  course  of  24  hours,  Sigil  has  about  6

hours of bright light and the same amount of darkness. The

rest of the day resembles twilight, allowing beings sensitive

or vulnerable to bright light or sunlight the freedom to go about

their business with relative ease.

Laws and Society

Because of Sigils role as the melting pot of the planes, its easy to see how the

city might seem like little more than a recipe for anarchy. How can a place

where  devils  and  demons  rub  shoulders  with  archons  and  slaadi  hope  to

maintain order? In truth, three factors keep the city relatively stable.

The  rst is the Lady of Pain. This ultrapowerful beingpossibly a deity, but no

ones sure, since she doesnt allow worshipersmoves calmly and silently through

the streets of Sigil. With a mere glance, she can cause creatures to sprout wounds and

bleed like a fountain. Someone who manages to get on her bad side will  nd himself

banished to an extraplanar maze, where hell likely die of starvation (or even old age)

searching for the single hidden exit. Somehow, the Lady also makes it so that

deities and beings of similar power cant enter the Cage, even through its portals,

so a coup isnt really an option.

The second factor keeping the city intact is the dabus, the strange, alien ser-

vants of the Lady of Pain. These silent, humanoid creatures serve as workmen,

patching the streets and shoring up buildings; as arbiters of justice,

running the city courts; and, when necessary, as peacekeepers, put-

ting down riots and the like. However, the dabus dont bother them-

selves with quelling petty crimes, so the streets are far from safe.

The third leg propping up the social order in Sigil is quite a bit  im-

sier: the people themselves. In the heyday of the factions (see History,

below), everybody knew who was in charge of law and order. Now, the

closest thing Sigil has to a police force (not counting the dabus) is a

citizen group called the Sons of Mercy. Unfortunately, without any

of cial power to make arrests or carry out sentences, the Sons

of Mercy dont garner much respect from the locals, and

thus arent terribly effective in limiting crime. Similarly,

the so-called Sigil Advisory Council, founded by former

members of the faction known as the Transcendent Order,

may have the citys best interests at heart, but the group lacks

real political power.

History

No one knows how Sigil came into be-

ing. Some say it was built ten thousand

years  ago  by  a  deposed  duke  of  Hell.

Others claim it was unconsciously cre-

ated  by  an  insane  demi-

god  while  he  dreamed

in  an  extradimensional

prison. Still others con-

tend  it  was  constructed

from  the  leftover  bits

of  the  Outer  Planes

just  after  the

time  of  cre-

ation.  But  most

inhabitants of the Cage dont care about their citys origins.

Still, nearly everyone agrees with the following handful of

historical facts.

In some distant past, Sigil was run by guildspowerful

organizations that kept order and peaceand the factions

were nothing more than dozens of splintered groups that

squabbled and fought incessantly among themselves. But

then, six or seven centuries ago by most accounts, came

the Great Upheaval, when the Lady of Pain decreed that

the  fty-plus warring factions would be cut down to a mere

 fteen.  Despite  this  shock  to  the  system,  most  agreed  it

was a good thing, because it ended countless feuds nearly

overnight.  Unfortunately  for  the  guilds,  it  also  meant  an

end for their power structure, as the factions quickly took

dominance in local politics.

But that stability proved short-lived, relatively speaking.

Soon enough, those  fteen factions started putting them-

selves up on pedestals, each believing that its way was the

right way, both for its members and for Sigil itself. The fac-

tions grew to believe they had a right to run the city. A few

years ago, though, the political strife turned physical, and

the streets ran with the blood of the Faction War.

So the Lady decided to start over again. As command-

ments go, it was a simple one, delivered to the leaders of each

faction: This city tolerates your faction no longer. Abandon

it or die.

Opinions varied as to what exactly the Lady meant by

that,  but  everyone  paid  attention.  Three  of  the  factions

simply disbanded, ceasing to exist. Six more moved out of

town to other locations, there to keep preaching their beliefs

to all whod listen. And six more remained in Sigil but gave

up on anything resembling an organization. Whether those

six were the bravestdeciding that the Lady meant no fac-

tions but not no beliefsor just the foolhardiest is open

to question.

The Wards

Sigil is divided into six regions called wards. The wards

arent official designationsno walls divide them from

one anotherbut everyone knows the difference between

one ward and the next, even if they dont agree on exactly

where that difference begins and ends. Still, its important

for  visitors  to  know  whats  where,  so  they  dont  wander

where they arent wanted. In some locales, that might earn

them a warning, but in others, it might get them a knife

between the ribs.

Lower Ward: The Lower Ward is perhaps the most sym-

bolic of the Cage as a whole. It gets its name from the large

number of portals to the Lower Planes found there, portals

through which a foul, sulfurous stench billows,  lling the

area. Still, its hard to avoid the Lower Ward, since most of

the citys craftsmen live and work there, and the place is full

of forges, mills, warehouses, and workshops.

The Ladys Ward: Going counterclockwise around the

ring of Sigil, the next stop is The Ladys Ward (and yes,

the locals can hear you capitalize all three of those words).

The Lady of Pain doesnt actually live here, but rich citi-

zens and most of Sigils temples lie within this ward. The

Ladys Ward has power, wealth, and majesty, and knows

how to show it off.

Market  Ward:  In  the  Market  Ward,  everything  is  for

sale. The wealth of Sigil may be concentrated in The Ladys

Ward, but its spent here, whether on goods, services, infor-

mation,  reputation,  or  anything  else  your  heart  desires.

The best place to get it all is the Grand Bazaar, an immense

plaza  lled with shops, tents, and stalls offering wares from

dozens of planes and strange worlds. As the old saying goes,

if  you  cant   nd  it  here,  it  probably  doesnt  (or  shouldnt)

exist. Prices can vary wildly, from dirt cheap (for merchants

with an unexpected overstock) to many times the normal

value (for goods in sudden short supply, due to a faulty portal

or a band of planar marauders).

Guildhall Ward: Many visitors cant tell the difference

between  the  Guildhall  Ward  and  the  Market  Ward.  Even

some locals claim that only tradition separates them. Since

guilds havent played a particularly signi cant role in Sigil

for centuries, one can guess that the name itself owes a lot to

tradition. Today, the Guildhall Ward serves as the domain of

the middle class of Sigil. Many merchants who hawk their

wares in the Market Ward during the day sleep here at night,

and many who deal in services (rather than selling  nished

goods) live and work here as well. The Guildhall Ward also

houses many racial neighborhoods, from the transplanted

hal ing hill of Curly-Foot, to the bariaur neighborhood of

Ghundarhavel, to the githyanki community of Gitriban.

Clerks  Ward:  Before  the  Great  Upheaval  (see  History,

above), the Clerks Ward held the bureaucracy of Sigil, but

thats all gone now, and some wonder what keeps the Clerks

Ward busy. The concern appears well founded; many whis-

per that the Clerks Ward is starting to crumble at the edges,

as the  lthy Hive encroaches upon its territory. Behind the

scenes, though, the Clerks Ward is  nding new purpose as

a quiet place to get things done without a lot of attention.

Some criminal organizations looking to improve their lot

have  moved  from  the  Lower  Ward  or  the  Hive  into  the

Clerks Ward, and the fact that the locals here tend to respect

each  others  privacy  just  encourages  activities  of  an  illicit

nature. Of course, it wouldnt be Sigil if everything made

sense, so the Clerks Ward is also home to one of the  ashiest

places in the citythe Civic Festhall. Run by a group call-

ing itself the Society of Sensation (a faction, back when the

Lady allowed such things), the Festhall combines the best

aspects of a concert hall, museum, and tavern while simul-

taneously serving as the centerpiece of an artistic neighbor-

hood  that  brings  travelers  from  across  the  multiverse.  Its

the best place in Sigil to see or be seen.

The Hive: Many locals claim that the Hive isnt a ward so

much as its the lack of a ward. Both the name for the region

between  the  Lower  Ward  and  Clerks  Ward  and  for  the

chaotic, sprawling slum in its center, the Hive crawls with

scum and villainy of all stripes. The lowest of the low live

in the Hivethose who cant afford (or dont dare) to rub

elbows with the more fortunate folks. In effect, the Hive is

like a miniature version of Sigil itself, with everything that

is needed in daily life: taverns and inns aplenty, entertain-

ment, and services from escorts to sellswords. The quality

may be questionable, but the prices cant be beat. The Gate-

house Night Market offers nearly everything one could  nd

in the Grand Bazaar (and a few things one couldnt), though

its best not to think too hard about where they came from.

Kylie the Tout

Kylie is widely regarded as one of the best and most trustwor-

thy touts (that is, guides) on the streets of Sigil. She knows

everybody, or at least it appears that way, and she always

seems to know what a potential customer wants. She also has

an uncanny knack for getting what she wants. She makes

a great  rst friend for visitors to Sigil, and she can prove

useful even to those familiar with the city.

Kylie:  Female  tie ing  rogue  8;  CR  9;  Medium  outsider

allows her to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage,

she takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Trap nding  (Ex):  Kylie  can   nd,  disarm,  or  bypass  traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to

 nd, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, a magic trap

(DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it). If her Dis-

able Device result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, she

discovers how to bypass the trap without triggering or dis-

arming it.

Possessions: Masterwork leather armor, earring of protection

resistance +2, +1 short sword, Hillpops golden quill (writes mes-

sages understood by any being).

TUNARATH

Tunarath is the largest and greatest githyanki city in any

dimension. It is found on the Astral Plane, built upon the

petri ed body of an unnamed dead god. Here dwells the

lich-queen, the absolute ruler of all githyanki. The lich-

queen  allows  trade  with  other  races,  but  nongithyanki

merchants  and  visitors  to  Tunarath  must  first  secure

special visas.

The dei c husk upon which Tunarath is built appears

vaguely humanoid in shape, with a head, an elongated

body, and six radiating arms. Subjective directional gravity

holds sway within 200 feet of the husk, allowing the citys

inhabitants to walk normally. Creatures and objects moving

within  200  feet  of  the  city  begin  to  fall  as  they  enter  the

astral islands gravity well. A series of mooring towers and

landing  platforms  on  the  head  spikes  and  arms  of  the

island allow astral ships to dock.

Surrounding the city are several chunks of astral detritus

atop which the githyanki have built small, forti ed citadels.

Chained to these  ying fortresses are smaller chunks of

rock with towers jutting out of them.

Travelers Tip: It is reported that visas must be granted

personally by the queen, but in fact such a mundane func-

tion is far below her attention, especially with the many plots,

intrigues, and invasions she must orchestrate. Generally, visas

are granted by her lesser generals and aides. But even this can

be touchy. Travelers are better off getting a trader exemp-

tion, which is a pass that can be purchased on the outskirts

of the city. The exemption is a green armband that visitors

must wear. Those sporting the exemptions can visit the trade

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

RAZORVINE

The flora of Sigil isnt much to write home about. The foul

environment  makes  short  work  of  most  plant  life,  so  visitors

shouldnt expect to see much greenery. In fact, the only plant

that  seems  to  thrive  in  the  Cage  is  a  horrid,  twining  climber

called razorvine.

Spread from the Lower Planesno doubt via portals in the

Lower Wardthe kudzulike razorvine grows everywhere it can in

the city. The dabus keep it in check in most places, but everybody

knows you cant really ever get rid of it. Even trimming it down

to  a  stub  only  delays  the  inevitable,  because  razorvine  grows

a foot or more per day. And as its name implies, the vine is as

sharp as a knife, so you cant just yank it out of the ground. In

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

fact, even reaching your hand into a patch can leave you bloody.

Minor contact with razorvine deals 1d6 points of damage, while

more serious contactsuch as a push into a patch or falling

headlong into itcan deal up to 3d6 points of damage. Armor

and a thick hide help reduce the damage; subtract your natural

armor  bonus  plus  half  your  armor  bonus  from  damage  dealt

by razorvine.

Some  Sigil  residents  have  turned  razorvine  to  their  advan-

tage. With care, a patch of razorvine can be cultivated to provide

protection. After all, most burglars arent desperate enough to

scale a razorvine-covered wall to see whats on the other side.

And since the plant becomes dull and brittle when cut, it also

makes fine kindling.

Architecture

=

Tunaraths architecture re ects the gith-

yanki  militaristic  mindsetominous

structures  with   ying  buttresses  and

protruding wrought-iron spikes, but with

enough  decor  to  make  them  more  than

cold assemblages of stone and iron. Porti-

cos are often adorned with sculptures and

frescoes depicting githyanki champions riding red dragons,

while  beautifully  carved  statues  of  prominent  githyanki

dominate city squares. Buildings are densely packed, multi-

story affairs joined by stone bridges on the upper levels.

Bridges  that  span  roadways  are  common  sights  in  every

district of Tunarath.

Skillfully wrought carvings of githyanki champions and

battle scenes adorn the outer walls of most public and civic

buildings.  Inner  and  outer  walls  are  of  superior  masonry.

Ground  oors are made of smooth stone, sometimes covered

with wooden planks, while upper stories consist of wooden

tiles or planks set atop thick wooden beams. Ceilings inside

buildings are usually 15 feet tall.

The lich-queen dwells in Susurrus, an immense obsidian

palace that rises from the forehead of the dead gods shape.

A great obsidian statue of Gith stands in front of the palace,

Illumination

The  silver  void  of  the  Astral  Plane,  though  dark  and

ominous in places, provides the city with perpetual light

equivalent to an overcast afternoon on the Material Plane.

Creatures that usually shun bright light can function nor-

mally here.

Laws and Society

Githyanki  society  precludes  the  need  for  codi ed  laws,

since it has virtually no crime and all disputes are handled

within  a  strict  military  chain  of  command.  Although  the

githyanki do not generally share space with other races,

147

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   147

Tunarath is cosmopolitan enough to host other races in its

Merchant District. These races are allowed to conduct trade

and come and go as they please (either by portal or astral

ship), but they have few rights and are watched closely by

githyanki  patrols  assigned  to  the  district.  In  general,  any

creature capable of abiding by the citys laws is allowed to

live and earn a living in Tunarathunless the githyanki

Commissar or some higher authority dictates otherwise.

Githzerai,  mind   ayers,  and  other  blood  enemies  of  the

githyanki are killed on sight. Harboring such a creature in

the city is a crime punishable by death.

Codi ed  laws  exist  to  deal  with  races  that  are  prone  to

violating the order of things. In short, any wrong in icted

upon a githyankifrom the most violent murder to a hate-

ful  glareis  punishable  by  death.  Particularly  heinous

criminals  are  brought  before  the  Commissar  so  that  he

may have the honor of killing the perpetrators personally.

When a crime is committed against a nongithyanki, both

the  accused  and  the  accuser  are  dragged  before  the  Com-

missar and given one chance to plead for justice. In most

instances,  the  accused  is  presumed  guilty  and  killed.  In

some instances, particularly when no githyanki are involved

in the crime, both the accused and the accuser are deemed

at  fault  and  summarily  slain,  which  helps  to  discourage

criminal acts and the willingness to report them.

History

Eons ago, the forerunners of the githyanki rebelled against

the mind  ayers. After winning their freedom with the aid

of the legendary Gith, they established a hereditary monar-

chy, naming Gith their ruler. Gith declined the honor. Civil

strife  ravaged  the  forerunner  race  of  the  githyanki  and

githzerai, and the two became vicious rivals.

Eventually, the githyanki settled on the Astral Plane. The

husk of the dead god that became the important githyanki

city of Tunarath was ancient even then. A family claiming

a blood relationship to Gith took power and established

Tunarath as its capital.

The Vlaakith line provided much-needed leadership

and constancy. The large degree of stability of govern-

ment in Tunarath is rare in the multiverse, even among

the gods. The Vlaakith line has ruled the githyanki for

countless millennia.

The current ruler, Queen Vlaakith CLVII, has reigned

for well over a thousand years. Unlike all her predecessors,

this Vlaakith is a lich. She has no heirs, and her elimination

would lead to great turmoil among the githyanki.

The Districts

The githyanki organize their city into a series of districts.

Artisan District: Githyanki use combat, dress, and craft

as means to express their individuality. Githyanki artisans,

called  mlar,  specialize  in  the  construction  and  repair  of

buildings,  tools,  weapons,  astral  ships,  and  other  needed

items, while others create sculptures and art pieces. Entire

districts  of  Tunarath  are  given  over  to  the  mlar,  some  of

whom rely on item creation feats and spells such as fabricate

and  wall  of  stone  to  complete  their  works.  Some  mlar  are

powerful wizards in their own right, and though they are

quick to rally to the citys defense, they have chosen a life

apart from the military. Low-level mlar tend to work in great

factories and foundries, while mid- to high-level mlar own

shops, forges, and studios. This district is decorated with

statuary, and even the most common buildings have elabo-

rate  bas-reliefs  on  the  outer  walls  and  fearsome  gargoyles

clutching the stone eaves.

Farmer District: Inhabitants of the Astral Plane never

suffer from hunger or thirst, so they have little need for

supplies of food and water. However, githyanki and their

red  dragon  mounts  journey  to  other  planes  regularly,

which  usually  requires  that  they  bring  supplies  of  food

with them. For this reason, Tunarath has githyanki farm-

ers, or glathk. The Farmer District is where the glathk live

and  tend  the  citys  food  supply.  Large  enclosures  illumi-

nated by continual  ame spells and magically enhanced so

that time passes normally (so plants can grow and mature)

hold fungi gardens, while livestock brought to Tunarath

from  other  planes  are  herded  into  caverns  beneath  the

city or allowed to roam about in small pens on the surface.

Githyanki and red dragon livestock includes everything

from  animals  to  chained  humanoid  captives  (goblins,

kobolds,  gnomes,  dwarves,  hal ings,  elves,  humans,  bar-

iaurs,  and  other  cattle).  In  addition  to  livestock,  the

glathk oversee the disposal of the citys waste by monitor-

ing  caverns  of  giant  bombardier  beetles,  which  quickly

consume the refuse and offal.

Merchant District: Located on one of the citys protrud-

ing middle arms, the Merchant District is the only section

of Tunarath open to nongithyanki. Githyanki vigilantly

patrol the streets that connect to the rest of the city, and

many of the buildings near the boundary of the Merchant

District are empty tenements or githyanki guard barracks.

The Merchant District is not maintained as immaculately

as other districts, but it is far from dirty and disheveled.

The most squalid structures are located among the ware-

houses at the end of the arm, near the docks. A few large

residences dominate the districts skyline, but most of the

buildings are densely packed apartments available for rent

at an average cost of 1 gp per room (per 24-hour period).

Because nongithyanki cannot own property in Tunarath,

all  buildings  have  a  githyanki  landlord,  or  nilghar,  who

usually lives elsewhere in the city; most landlords are gith-

yanki knights who were bequeathed the estates as rewards

for loyal service. They use lower-ranked githyanki or non-

githyanki hirelings to collect rental payments and deal with

unwanted tenants.

Military  Districts:  The  culture  of  the  githyanki

revolves  around  war  and  conquest.  From  the  moment

they hatch, gith yanki are assigned to military regiments.

Deprived  of  any  sense  of  family,  the  githyanki  learn  to

value their weapons, armor, and combat prowess above all

else. The city has several military districts where hundreds

of githyanki regiments live and train. Each regiment has its

own hierarchy of githwarriors, knights, warlocks, and gish.

A typical district contains dozens of separate military com-

pounds, with a supreme commander (a githyanki knight)

presiding over each one. The supreme commanders spend

most of their time planning missions of conquest and con-

ferring with one another about issues affecting the whole

city. They rely on captains, or kithraks, to organize the units

under their command. The captains in turn rely on ser-

geants, or sarths, to train the common soldiers. Githyanki

who  demonstrate  an  af nity  for  magic  receive  additional

training at the Citadel of War before rejoining their respec-

tive regiments. Githyanki who manifest unusual psionic

abilities are sent to the Citadel of the Voids Eye for mental

training and enlightenment.

The Palace of Whispers

Vlaakith  the  lich-queen  dwells  in  Susurrus,  the  Palace  of

Whispers. Its polished obsidian walls are supported by  ying

buttresses and carved with narrow windows set with opaque

panes of crimson glass. Entrance is gained through the 100-

foot-tall statue of Gith that guards the palace and watches

over the city below. A vast necropolis surrounds the palace

on all sides, the graves and mausoleums of fallen githyanki

heroes eerily silent. As one nears Susurrus, the whispers of

the dead trapped within its walls can be heard. These whis-

pers  become  louder  as  one  enters  the  forlorn  edi ce,  and

even more intense in the presence of Vlaakith.

Entering and Exiting Tunarath

Protecting the city are a dozen or more fortresses built into

large fragments of rock adrift in the Astral Plane. When an

unfamiliar  astral  ship  or  astral-faring  retinue  approaches

Tunarath, the nearest  ying fortress dispatches an escort

to intercept the approaching vessel or retinue: a githyanki

kithrak  (captain)  astride  a  juvenile  red  dragon.  When

approaching  an  astral  ship,  the  dragon  positions  itself

outside the  ring arc of the ships visible weaponry, but

drifts close enough to blast the decks with its  ery breath,

if necessary.

When  confronting  a  githyanki  retinue  or  githyanki-

crewed astral ship, a kithrak merely ushers the vessel to the

city docks before returning to the  ying fortress.

When confronting a retinue that includes nongithyanki,

a kithrak demands to know their business in Tunarath and

instructs  nongithyanki  to  con ne  themselves  to  the  Mer-

chant District, lest they be killed on sight. If the visitors are

belligerent or recognized as enemies of the githyanki people,

the kithrak and its dragon mount attack immediately. This

activity  draws  the  attention  of  nearby   ying  fortresses,

which send reinforcements.

When confronting a vessel populated by nongithyanki, a

kithrak requires that the vessel undergo a thorough search

before proceeding. The kithrak uses his dimension door abil-

ity to appear on deck and begins systematically inspecting

every compartment and container on the ship. Meanwhile,

the  dragon  circles  the  ship,  ready  to  blast  it.  Once  the

kithrak  is  satis ed,  he  rejoins  the  dragon,  at  which  point

they escort the ship to the city docks.

Leaving Tunarath is generally simpler than arriving. Unless

the githyanki have a good reason to prevent an astral ship

or retinue from leaving the cityfor example, they suspect

that a githzerai might be hiding among the crewthey let

the visitors depart unsearched and unimpeded.

New Artifacts

Vlaakith has two artifacts in her possession at all times: the

crown of corruption and the scepter of Ephelomon.

Crown  of  Corruption:  This  slender,  black-and-silver

diadem has rested atop Vlaakiths head for more than 900

years, serving as her badge of of ce and the means of test-

ing any githyanki who would threaten her. Those who have

beheld  the  crown  say  it  twitches  of  its  own  volition,  and

that the 5,000-gp rubies that adorn the crowns spires look

something like  ickering eyes. The crown has the following

command-word activated powers.

Energy drain (Fort DC 23 negates).

Mass suggestion (Will DC 19 negates).

Control undead (Will DC 20 negates).

The crown of corruption has 30 hit points. However, only a

magic weapon with the holy and disrupting special abilities

can damage it.

Caster level 25th; Weight 3 lb.

Scepter  of  Ephelomon:  This  ruby-encrusted,  dragon-

shaped  scepter  was  Ephelomons  gift  to  the  githyanki

centuries  ago  when  the  pact  with  red  dragons  was  forged.

5/20/04, 1:09:45 PM

Ephelomon gave the scepter to the  rst Vlaakith (the current

Vlaakiths ancestor), saying, Go forth and conquer all.

The scepter has the following powers.

The  bearer  has  total  control  over  red  dragons.  Any  red

dragon that approaches within a half-mile of the scepter

must succeed on a DC 35 Will save or be affected as by a

dominate monster spell cast by a 30th-level caster.

The bearer has immunity to  re and fear effects.

Once per week, the bearer can create a gate through which

a very old red dragon  ies. The dragon must immediately

make a DC 35 Will save or serve the scepter-bearer with-

out reward. Even if the dragon makes its save, it is consid-

ered controlled as described in the gate spell and may be

ordered  to   ght  the  scepter-bearers  foes,  or  the  dragon

can bargain with the bearer of the scepter.

The scepter of Ephelomon has 60 hit points and can be dam-

aged only by the claws of Bahamut or one of his chosen vas-

sals, by a magic weapon with the bane (evil dragons) special

ability, or by the cold breath weapon of a good-aligned silver

dragon.  If  the  scepter  is  destroyed,  the  pact  between  the

githyanki  and  the  red  dragons  dissolves.  The  red  dragons

do  not  immediately  turn  against  the  githyanki,  but  only

the most subservient ones will continue to serve or assist

the githyanki in any way. Red dragons in Vlaakiths service

continue to serve the lich-queen out of fear, but not loyalty.

Caster level 30th; Weight 5 lb.

PLANAR BREACHES

If you cant go to the planes, dont worry; sometimes they

come  to  you.  The  divisions  between  different  planes  of

existence are usually unassailable. But in a multiverse where

magic, psionics, and divine decree daily wrench reality into

unnatural  con gurations,  that  which  separates  one  space

from the next can wear thin. Thats when the phenomenon

known as planar breaching occurs.

Planar breaches can be minor, severe, or complete. Minor

breaching  is  often  overlooked  because  its  effects  are  not

immediately  obvious,  while  at  the  other  end  of  the  spec-

trum, a complete breach opens a hole in reality where laws

and planar natives mix in the middle.

Wily  planar  travelers  sometimes  use  severe  and  com-

plete planar breaches to get around, though unless they are

responsible for causing the breach in the  rst place, its hard

to count on such phenomena (except, of course, for locations

such as the Breaching Obelisk, a planar touchstone location

described in this chapter).

MECHANICS OF A PLANAR BREACH

Dungeon  Masters  may  use  the  following  de nitions  to

guide the creation and execution of a planar breach.

A  planar  breach  has  an  onset,  an  area,  a  severity,  and  a

duration.

Onset:  Most  planar  breaches  come  into  being  over  the

course of 1d4 rounds. The occurrence of a planar breach is

accompanied by discharges of visible light, an atmospheric

disturbance that causes a wind, and a basso rumbling.

Area: A breach, regardless of its severity, affects an area

10d10 feet in radius.

Severity: A breach can be minor, severe, or complete. For

minor or severe breaches, one plane is called the breaching

plane, and the other is called the destination plane. Usually,

only one trait from the breaching plane leaks through to the

destination plane. In a complete breach, all traits from both

affected planes leak equally into each other.

Minor Breach: A minor breach occurs when one align-

ment,  elemental/energy,  or  magic  trait  described  in  the

Dungeon Masters Guide leaks from one plane to another.

You can choose a trait or roll for one on Table 71: Random

Planar Breaching.

Elemental and energy traits in a minor breach are nowhere

near  full  strength.  If  an  elemental  or  energy  trait  is  deter-

mined to be present in a minor breach, the overtly noticeable

effect is that it is hotter ( re), windier (air), damper (water),

dirtier (earth), brighter (positive), or darker (negative). Addi-

tionally, creatures with a subtype corresponding to a leaking

energy trait gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, saving throws,

and  skill  checks.  Likewise,  spells  that  have  a  descriptor

coresponding to the leaking energy trait receive a +1 bonus

to their save DC, if applicable. All creatures inhabiting an

area where positive energy leaks through heal at twice their

normal rate. All creatures inhabiting an area where negative

energy leaks through heal at half their normal rate. These

weakened elemental and energy traits do not manifest in a

severe or complete breach.

Severe Breach: A severe breach occurs when one align-

ment, elemental/energy, magic, or physical trait described

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

PLANAR TRAITS

Each plane of existence has its own propertiesthe natural laws

of its universe. Planar traits are broken down into a number of

general areas. All planes have the following kinds of traits.

Physical Traits: These traits determine the laws of physics and

nature on the plane, including how gravity and time function.

Elemental/Energy Traits: These traits determine the domi-

nance of particular elemental or energy forces.

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

Alignment Traits: Just as characters may be lawful neutral

or chaotic good, many planes are tied to a particular moral or

ethical outlook.

Magic Traits: Magic works differently from plane to plane, and

these traits set the boundaries for what magic can and cant

do on a particular plane.

Planar  traits  are  described  starting  on  page  147  of  the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

2 The breaching plane serves only as an example; the DM may choose a different breaching plane, or make up a plane or

demiplanes of his own choosing to serve as the breaching plane.

3 1 round in breach area equals 1 year outside breach area.

4 A sentient plane or demiplane that breaches affects the destination plane as if it is haunted. Objects move of their own volition,

creatures in the area get a sense of being watched, and strange noises are heard. The DM is free to add additional effects.

5 These demiplanes are only as large as the breach area in the destination plane and exist only as long as the breach itself

exists. The DM may determine other demiplane traits or inhabitants as desired.

in the Dungeon Masters Guide leaks between one plane and

another. You can either choose a trait, or roll for one on Table

71: Random Planar Breaching.

The trait, whatever its effects, is applied across the entire

area  of  the  breach.  This  can  be  spectacular  for  a  water-

dominant  or   re-dominant  trait,  and  quite  dangerous  for

creatures in the area. Natural structures and land forms in

the breaching area can also be affected or damaged by the

change in environment. For instance, an area that suddenly

gains the  re-dominant elemental trait becomes a roaring

area  of   ame  that  deals  3d10  points  of   re  damage  every

round to all creatures and objects within it.

A severe breach also represents such a thin boundary

between planes that creatures and objects from one plane

can  slip  or  squeeze  through  to  the  other  side.  When  a

creature or object first enters an affected area on either

the  breaching  or  destination  plane  (or  if  the  area  comes

into  effect  where  a  creature  or  untended  object  already

exists),  there  is  a  20%  chance  that  the  creature  or  object

slips through to the other plane. A creature that wants to

make this transition can increase this chance to 100% if he

makes a DC 15 Knowledge (the planes) check.

Unlike with minor breaches, severe breaches require the

DM to speci cally determine the breaching plane in case

travel occurs between the two places.

Complete Breach: When a complete breach occurs, a hole

is ripped in reality. The hole is a 10-foot-radius sphere that

inhabits  the  center  of  the  10d10-foot-radius  area  of  the

breach  on  both  affected  planes.  This  larger  affected  area

exists  on  both  affected  planes  and  contains  the  traits  of

both affected planes. The hole at the center is an open portal

between the planes. Creatures from either plane can move

as they will through the hole.

If the planar material on one side is less dense than the

material on the other, transport may occur. For instance,

if the air pressure on one side is much higher than on the

other, a roaring wind blows out one side of the hole, while

a  sucking  vortex  comes  into  being  on  the  other  (small

differences  in  pressure  create  only  a  slight  breeze).  If

water exists on one side and not the other, liquid jets out

one side, but swirls away on the other.

Unlike with minor breaches, complete breaches require

the  DM  to  speci cally  determine  the  breaching  plane  in

case travel occurs between the two places.

Duration: Most planar breaches last 1d6 days minus a

certain number of hours. A minor breach lasts 1d6 days

minus 12 hours (with a minimum duration of 12 hours),

a  severe  breach  lasts  1d6  days  minus  48  hours  (with  a

minimum duration of 1 hour), and a complete breach lasts

1d6 days minus 72 hours (with a minimum duration of 10

minutes). When the duration expires, the planar breach

recedes, taking the same amount of time and causing the

same  atmospheric  disturbances  and  effects  as  during  the

breachs onset.

BREACH CANDIDACY

Breaching usually occurs randomly. Material Plane loca-

tions are less likely to see a breach; in fact, they almost never

experience one. A planar site is a good candidate for a breach

if it meets any of the following criteria.

The location is home to a regular energetic event, such

as a volcanic vent, an oceanic whirlpool, an evil sacri ce,

and so on. A one-time event of signi cant proportion can

also make that location a breaching candidate, such as a

spectacular volcanic eruption, a whirlpool of epic propor-

tions, a mass evil sacri ce, and so on.

The location was used to launch a planar trip via magical

or psionic means, such as by using the spells plane shift,

ethereal jaunt, etherealness, astral projection, and so on.

The DM wants a breach to occur at the location. This

criterion is particularly useful in campaigns set on the

planes where the average character level is deemed too

low  for  wide-ranging  exploration  or  adventuring.  A

planar breach allows the DM to inject planar material

into  the  game  without  unduly  endangering  the  player

characters. Instead of having the heroes risk a journey

into the Abyss, for example, a bit of the Abyss can come

to them.

In addition, certain spells (such as precipitate breach, detailed

on page 103), items, and locations can cause a breach whether

or not an area is a candidate for a natural breach.

RANDOM BREACHING

If the DM decides that an area is a candidate for a breach,

he  can  arrange  all  the  details  ahead  of  time,  especially  if

designing an adventure with a speci c goal in mind. How-

ever, the DM also can generate a random breach, which is a

good way to create seeds for a new adventure.

To generate a random breach, the DM first rolls d% to

see if a breach occurs at the location. Each day, a candi-

date site has a 4% chance to experience a breach. Once a

breach occurs, the tension is relieved, and the location is

no longer a candidate for future breaches (unless the DM

determines otherwise).

When a breach occurs, the DM then rolls to decide the

severity of the breach.

Finally, the DM rolls on Table 71: Random Planar Breach-

ing  to  determine  a  trait  for  the  breach.  If  the  breach  is

minor, reroll any results that are not alignment, magic, or

elemental/energy  traitsonly  those  types  are  allowed  in

a minor breach.

PLANAR TOUCHSTONES

Certain places in the cosmos resonate with unique forms

of energy. The cosmological association of linked planes,

demiplanes,  and  connective  dimensional  realms  creates

a vast network over which the energy of existence itself

is channeled. Less-connected demiplanes and planes are

the  nodes  of  this  network,  while  the  most  highly  con-

nected planes are the hubs, where their many linkages to

other planes suffuse them with excess energy. Those able

to form a linkage with a hub are rewarded with a heady

charge of supernatural power. These hubs, usually places

already  resonant  with  mythic  possibility,  are  known  as

planar touchstones.

The Planar Touchstone feat described on page 41 allows

those  who  possess  some  association  (in  the  form  of  an

object native to the planar touchstone) with a given planar

location to forge a link. A link forged with a planar touch-

stone provides a base ability that is always active. The link

also provides characters with the possibility of supercharg-

ing their abilities by making a personal visit to a touchstone

site. Such a visit allows the power inherent in the touch-

stone  to  discharge  directly  into  the  visitor,  granting  the

character  a  higher-order  ability  that  she  can  call  upon  a

limited number of times before it is exhausted. Additional

visits to that planar touchstone (or any other touchstone)

can revitalize her charge, as needed. If she visits a touch-

stone  other  than  the  one  she  originally  linked  to  when

taking the feat, she swaps out the base ability of the old site

for the new, and gains the higher-order ability of the new

site (while losing any remaining higher-order uses of the old

site). For those intimately familiar with planar touchstones,

visiting one or more touchstones is known as taking the

touchstone tour.

In addition to the bene ts planar touchstone sites obvi-

ously provide to players, DMs are happy to discover that

they make wonderful story elements to their campaigns. For

instance, a prophecy can state that a particular scourge

cannot  be  overcome,  save  by  one  who  looks  upon  the

stars of Oxyrhynchus. (Oxyrhynchus is a touchstone site

described in this chapter.) On a less dramatic scale, planar

touchstones also make great alternatives to treasurewhen

players overcome an encounter level-rated threat associated

with  a  touchstone  site,  the  higher-order  ability  gained

makes a good reward.

WHAT MAKES A TOUCHSTONE?

Often, a touchstone site is special in some way that goes

beyond its status as a touchstone, though sometimes the

fact that a location is a touchstone is what makes it special.

Relatively few touchstones exist on the Material Plane, but

almost  every  Material  Plane  touchstone  is  signi cant  for

some other reason. For instance, the location may also have

historical or geographic importance (such as the peak of the

worlds tallest mountain).

Planar locations previously described in other game prod-

ucts might also be considered planar touchstones. Adven-

turers might have known about and even visited a site for

years without ever realizing that it had the power to confer

special  abilities.  Determining  the  base  and  higher-order

abilities conferred by these sites is an exercise for the DM.

Sometimes characters with great power gain the ability

to create small demiplanes. Such  edgling demiplanes can

never be planar touchstones, though after several thousand

years of growth, linkage, and expansion, such created planes

could come to host planar touchstones.

TRAVELING TO TOUCHSTONE SITES

If a character lacks the ability to visit a touchstone site,

the higher-order ability inherent to that location cannot

be accessed. Presumably, someone who takes the Planar

Touchstone  feat  and  forges  a  link  to  a  particular  planar

location feels that he has a reliable method of reaching the

site. Perhaps the character knows of a permanent portal that

opens near the touchstone. Others may rely on spells such

as  plane  shift,  cast  personally  or  by  a  friend.  Whatever  the

method of transportation, the character must have access to

a method that is at least somewhat reliable.

Of course, merely reaching the planar touchstone is the

first step. Some planar touchstones are located in planes

inimical to nonnative life. Elemental planes, especially,

with energy-dominant traits, require some preparation. For

instance, the planar touchstone location called the Burning

Rift is located on the Elemental Plane of Fire. Without some

protection, the visit to the touchstone may be short.

TOUCHSTONES ON THE PLANES

The following section provides numerous planar touchstone

locations. Each planar touchstone site follows this format:

Name: The most common name or names of the planar

touchstone.

Description: Each location has a description.

Location: The planar location of the touchstone, if known.

The major planes of existence are described starting on page

151 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. The DM should refer to

those descriptions for details, especially when a character

must travel through some of the intervening location plane

before arriving at the touchstone.

Initial Encounters: Information on the type of encoun-

ter  players  may  face  on   rst  visiting  the  touchstone.  This

entry comes with an encounter table, if appropriate.

Subsequent Encounters: Information on the type of

encounters players may face on subsequent visits to the

touchstone.

Base Ability: The ability gained by someone taking the

Planar Touchstone feat, regardless of whether that character

has visited the site. This conferred ability is always available

to the character (to the limits of any supernatural ability)

and does not have a given number of uses.

Recharge Condition: Many planar touchstones require

not only a visit, but also the ful llment of some condition

in order to recharge the higher-order ability provided. This

condition can vary widely among planar touchstones. It

need  not  be  ful lled  to  gain  the  planar  touchstones  base

ability, but it must be ful lled for each recharge of a higher-

order ability.

Higher-Order  Ability:  The  ability  gained  by  some-

one  who  visits  the  touchstone  and  fulfills  the  recharge

condition. This ability is limited to a number of uses per

recharge,  and  thus  can  be  used  up,  until  such  time  as  a

future visit is made. All higher-order abilities are consid-

ered either supernatural or spell-like, as indicated in each

abilitys description.

Higher-Order Uses: Each time the character recharges

her higher-order ability, she gains a number of uses of that

ability. The higher-order ability cannot be used more than

once per day.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN: TOUCHSTONE ABILITIES

When  creating  new  planar  touchstones,  follow  these  general

rules for determining base abilities and higher-order abilities.

A planar touchstones base ability should be comparable to a

general feat, and should work the same way. The higher-order

ability granted by a visitation should possess the rough power

equivalent and total uses as follows: five uses of a 3rd-level

spell  equivalent,  six  uses  of  a  2nd-level  spell  equivalent,  or

pqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqrs

seven uses of a 1st-level spell equivalent. You also might con-

sider power equivalents as follows: four uses of a 4th-level spell

equivalent,  three  uses  of  a  5th-level  spell  equivalent,  or  two

uses of a 6th-level spell equivalent. These abilities should scale

with character level for at least a few levels, so they may end

up being slightly more powerful than spells in some instances.

Save  DCs  for  these  abilities  are  based  on  the  characters

Charisma score.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 4 SITES

Empyrea Mere

This cold, clear mountain lake overlooks the great City

of Tempered Souls, with its healing fountains and curing

waters. In fact, the citys healing waters are drawn from

the Mere. Those looking in the Mere see the truth about

themselvesall  their  strengths,   aws,  and  weaknesses,  it

is saidand those who bathe in the water are healed of all

curses and spiritual hurts.

Location:  Mertion,  the   fth  layer  of  Celestia,  near  the

City of Tempered Souls.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Empyrea Mere encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. The creatures encoun-

tered are initially suspicious of those seeking the Mere, but

diplomacy may turn their hostile attitudes to a less aggres-

sive posture.

Subsequent Encounters: Once the players negotiate a

peace (or clear the location), on subsequent visits the chance

of an encounter is only 10%. If the PCs fail to visit the loca-

tion for more than a year, they must roll for encounters as if

they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain +3 hit points.

Recharge Condition: Drink of the Mere from a silver

chalice.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, your touch upon

the target creature can wipe away one of the following ail-

ments  or  conditions:  ability  damage,  blinded,  confusion,

dazed, dazzled, deafened, disease, exhaustion, fatigue, feeble-

mindedness, insanity, nausea, sickness, stun, poison (ongo-

ing), or hit point damage (up to 90 points). Your touch has no

effect on undead creatures.

Higher-Order Uses: 4.

Mundellir Lake

A   oating  earthberg  some  100  miles  in  rough  diameter

holds  a  windswept  lake  that  constantly  spills  over  the

edges.  Great  freshwater  pearl  beds  dot  the  shallow  por-

tion  of  the  lakes  bottom  some  90  feet  below  the  sur-

face  (though  the  lake  is  far  deeper).  In  addition  to  the

encounters  noted  on  the  table  below,  fishermen  from

the surrounding earthbergs of Ysgard sometimes wait on

the lakes surface, casting great nets into its deepest por-

tion, hoping to dredge up a great haul of fish or a trophy

worthy of a heroic Ysgardian.

Location: The top layer of Ysgard (also called Ysgard).

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Mundellir Lake encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year.

visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +2 bonus on Swim checks and

add +10 to your swim speed.

Recharge Condition: Retrieve a pearl from the seabed

(each has a value of 1d10 gp).

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  you  can  breathe

water freely for up to 1 hour per character level (and you can

still breathe air, too). During this same period, you can also

choose to stay above the water, treading upon it as if it were

 rm ground, though your feet actually hover an inch above

the surface. This ability works in mud, oil, snow, quicksand,

and  ice  in  addition  to  water.  Should  you  decide  to  begin

treading on the substance while beneath its surface, you are

borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until you stand

above it.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 5 SITES

The Burning Rift

The Burning Rift is situated upon a solidi ed plain of free-

 oating magma on the Elemental Plane of Fire, some 200

feet above the in nite expanse of  re and ash below. The

 oating plain is bisected, forming a great rift from which

wells up a great river of  re called the Rift River. The Rift

River  ows out along the rift and into empty space, creating

a magni cent cascade of  re. The headwaters of the Rift

River are a magnet to native creatures.

Location: The Elemental Plane of Fire.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Burning Rift encounter

table when the characters visit the location for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. The elementals are ran-

domly drawn to the site, while the magmin and salamanders

have attempted to make a home there.

after  the  magmins  last  successful  attack.  Magmins  can

also ignite  ammable materials with a touch. The save DC

is Constitution-based.

Fiery Aura (Ex): Anyone within 30 feet of a magmin must

succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of  re

damage  per  round  from  the  intense  heat.  The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Melt Weapons (Ex): Any metal weapon that strikes a magmin

must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or melt away into

slag. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Evasion (Ex): If exposed to any effect that normally allows

an  attempted  Reflex  saving  throw  for  half  damage,  a

magmin takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Still  Mind  (Ex):  +2  bonus  on  saving  throws  against

The Heart of the Sea

The Heart of the Sea is a con guration of four bubbles of

breathable air that  oat through the in nite depths of the

Elemental  Plane  of  Water.  The  bubbles  align  themselves

in a shape reminiscent of the four chambers of a human

heart, and a stream of fast-moving water flows through

them  in  roughly  the  same  path  that  blood  would  take

through a heart.

Inhabitants of the plane sometimes use the heart as a way

to test the mettle and valor of visitors. If a bubble breather

can swim upstream through all four chambers of the Heart

of  the  Sea,  she  is  considered  to  have  been  embraced  by

Mother Ocean.

Location: The Elemental Plane of Water.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Heart of the Sea encoun-

Base Ability: If you fail a Fortitude saving throw to keep

from drowning, you may attempt the saving throw a second

time.  You  must  accept  the  results  of  the  second  roll.  (See

Drowning, page 304 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.)

Recharge  Condition:  You  must  swim  one  complete

circuit through the Heart of the Sea, swimming against

the flow of the stream, without taking a breath during

the course of the circuit. (See Water Dangers, page 304

of the Dungeon Masters Guide.) You must do this without

the benefit of a water breathing spell or any other magical

effect that allows you to ignore the effects of having no

air to breathe.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you gain the ben-

e ts of water breathing as though it were cast solely on you by

a 20th-level cleric.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

Omores Folly

The Underworld is as bleak and desperate a place as one will

 nd anywhere in the multiverse. The gray, blasted landscape

is  home  to  thousands  of  petitionersthe  spirits  of  those

who have recently diedwho are slowly being drained of

the  last  vestiges  of  their  emotions  and  spiritual  strength.

Legends tell of heroes who traveled to the Underworld to

rescue  lovers  or  family  members  from  untimely  deaths,

though these stories rarely speak of the hundreds of would-

be saviors who failed in the attempt. Saddest among these

is Omore.

Omore came to Hades and scaled the wall of the Under-

world to retrieve the spirit of his recently departed love, the

beautiful but morally shallow Jeilut. Against all odds, the

young man found his lovers spirit and managed to get her

up the same wall he climbed on his way in. At the top, he

paused and told her to look back so that she would see how

much he loved herwhat he was willing to dare for her sake.

Unfortunately, it was at just that moment that Jeiluts resolve

crumbled. Being a woman of poor character to begin with,

she  transformed  into  a  larva,  attacked  Omore,  and  killed

him with a single bite.

The  section  of  wall  on  which  this  unhappy  incident

occurred has been known ever since as Omores Folly.

Location:  The  Underworld  within  Pluton,  the  third

gloom (layer) of Hades.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Omores Folly encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the location for the  rst

time, or for the  rst time in over a year.

Will save bonus.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

The Unseen Path

On  the  whole,  the  plane  of  Pandemonium  is  a  dark,

befuddling place. The ground is generally uneven, rocky

terrain, there are no natural sources of light, and winds

howl constantly, bringing odd sounds from every direc-

tion. This makes it dif cult, even at the best of times, for a

visitor to get her orientation, and walking even a few steps

can be an adventure.

Of  all  the  disorienting  places  in  Pandemonium,  the

section of tunnel known as the Unseen Path is perhaps

the most baffling. Approximately 300 feet long and laid

with  fine  cobblestones,  the  Unseen  Path  was  clearly

carved by some intelligent hand. Because of the nature

of gravity on Pandemonium, the fact that this path wan-

ders unpredictably from floor to wall to ceiling and back

is not all that strange. What is strange is that the tunnel

has been enchanted so that if one wanders off the path,

gravity  reverses  itself,  causing  unwary  pedestrians  to

unexpectedly fall the entire width of the tunnel (about

50 feet).

This would be troublesome enough, but there is a second

enchantment on the Unseen Path. The entire length of

the  passageway  is  cloaked  by  a  series  of  deeper  darkness

spells, making traversing the span an especially danger-

ous proposition.

Location: Cocytus, the second layer of Pandemonium.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Unseen Path encounter

table when the characters visit the location for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year.

path for the whole distance; you merely have to traverse the

entire tunnel.

darkvision for a number of minutes equal to 10  your char-

acter level.

Higher-Order Uses: 6.

The Veil

The Plane of Shadow is an ever-changing landscape of stark

contrast.  The  sky  is  always  black  and  the  land  a  powdery

white,  with  no  shade  or  hue  anywhere  (except  for  subtle

gray  tones  that  hint  at  an  objects  texture  and  depth).  In

one area, however, the line of stark delineation ripples and

blursthe Veil.

From a distance, the Veil looks like a small dust devil or

smoke  from  a  smoldering   re.  But  as  one  draws  closer,  it

becomes clear that the Veil is even more ephemeral. It is a

ripple in the air, a distortion through which colors appear

to morph into their opposites and back again many times a

second. Since the only two colors on the Plane of Shadow

are  black  and  white,  this  means  that  anything  viewed

through the Veil has a soft gray tone, almost like highly

realistic drawings done in charcoal.

Creatures native to the plane find this effect disturb-

ing, even profane, and avoid it at all costs. Some of them

believe  that  merely  looking  through  the  Veil  can  addle

a  persons  mind,  making  it  difficult  for  him  to  make

decisions or understand opposing concepts. Visitors are

more likely to see it as a peculiar but intriguing natural

wonder.

Location: The Plane of Shadow.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Veil  encounter  table

when the characters visit the location for the  rst time, or

for the  rst time in over a year.

Recharge  Condition:  Stand  on  the  opposite  side  of

you see. Then look at the drawing through the Veil.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, as long as you are

within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, you can hide from

view in the open without anything to actually hide behind.

You cannot, however, hide in your own shadow.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 6 SITES

Arthenmyrs Wrath

Ni heim, the second gloom of Hades, is a place covered in

thick, obscuring mists. Somewhere in this bleak landscape

is a small dell where the fog takes on a yellowish tinge and

the air is  lled with a sulfurous stench. Anyone who enters

takes 1d6 points of acid damage every round they stand in

the poisoned fog. The dell is known as Arthenmyrs Wrath,

and at its center stands a bone-white chapel dedicated to a

nameless god.

Arthenmyr  is  a  barbazu  sorcerer  who  has  seen  every

companion  he  has  ever  known  die  in  the  Blood  War.

He decided that rather than perpetuating the pointless

battle, he would seek to end it in a most fitting manner.

At the heart of the chapel is a magic fountain filled with

acid that continually roils and sends up clouds of poison-

ous gas that mix with the fog and make the dell unlivable.

If Arthenmyr has his way, he will someday discover a way

to spread the effect to all of Niflheim and, eventually, the

entirety of Hades.

Location: Ni heim, the second gloom (layer) of Hades.

Destiny Point

Along  the  shore  of  Celestias  Glass  Tarn,  a  spit  of  land

sticks  out  into  the  water  like  a   nger  pointing  forward.

This islet is known as Destiny Point, and it is considered

the most auspicious place from which to access the lakes

prophetic powers.

It is said that merely standing at the waters edge along

Destiny  Point  is  enough  to   ll  a  person  with  a  sense  of

purpose.  Whats  more,  some  claim  that  this  physically

changes a person so that others will see her as one who is

favored by fatea person with an important role to play

in the multiverse. Whether or not any truth lies in these

claims,  it  is  one  of  the  most  picturesque  spots  along  the

shoreline, and an especially good spot from which to view

the constellations.

Location: Venya, the third layer of Celestia.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Destiny Point encounter

table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time, or

for the  rst time in over a year. The cleric will generally be a

character similar to the PCs who has come to the Glass Tarn

to glean information about his future. The lantern archons

Subsequent  Encounters:  Once  the  characters  have

established their presence in the area, on subsequent visits

the chance of an encounter is only 10%. If the PCs fail to

visit  the  location  for  more  than  a  year,  they  must  roll  for

encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Recharge  Condition:  Pick  a  stone  from  the  shore  of

the Glass Tarn, and throw it across the water so that it skips

at least three times. To count how many skips you get per

throw,  make  a  Dexterity  check.  The  number  of  skips  is

based on the check result; the stone skips once for every 5

full points of the result (so a result of 04 would not skip at

all, a result of 59 would skip once, a result of 1014 would

skip twice, and so on).

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day as a full round

action,  you  can  urge  your  companions  on  to  extraor-

dinary  levels  of  capability.  You  may  affect  a  number

of  allies  equal  to  one-quarter  of  your  character  level

(round  down,  minimum  1).  The  subjects  receive  a  +1

morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls,

and a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm

and fear effects. The bonuses last for a number of rounds

equal to your character level. This ability will not work

on  anyone  who  has  immunity  to  mind-affecting  spells

and abilities.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

The Library of Ignorance

Agathys, the innermost layer of Carceri, is a dark sphere

of  black  ice.  The  wind  howls  endlessly,  and  little  light  or

shelter can be found anywhere. At the base of one glacial

cliff sits a tiny, lonely stone building known as the Library

of Ignorance.

The  library  consists  of  a  main  level  and  a  balcony  that

runs around three sides. Each wall of the building is  lled

from  oor to ceiling with rows of bookshelvesall empty.

None of them holds even a single book.

In the center of the main floor sits a wooden table, a

single chair, and a small, pot-bellied stove. On the table

159

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   159

5/20/04, 1:27:43 PM

rests a tremendous volume whose cover reads Book of

Knowledge.

The librarys sole occupant is a derro wizard by the name

of Dreschm. Once, Dreschm was an adventurer who wan-

dered  the  planes,  learning  all  he  could  from  anyone  who

would speak with him. Now he is irretrievably mad (even

for a derro). Though no one is certain how he came to be in

this state, it is presumed that somewhere in his adventuring,

he earned the ire of Nerull.

Every day, Dreschm sits at the table and  lls one page in

the book with memories from his long-ago travels across the

multiverse. However, since he has no other source of heat,

he also tears one page from the book and tosses it into the

stove to feed the  ame.

Despite the wretched conditions, Dreschm has no desire

to leave his library, and will actively  ght anyone who tries

to rescue him or otherwise make him leave.

Location: Agathys, the innermost sphere of Carceri.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Library of Ignorance

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. Some of the

encounters are with creatures that wander the frozen waste;

others are with visitors who come to torment Dreschm. No

matter when one visits the library, Dreschm will be there,

sitting at his table, either writing or tearing out a page to

feed into the stove.

Mimshans Curtain

Mimshans Curtain can be found in the mountains outside

the city of Fortitude on the Concordant Domain of the Out-

lands. It is a thin veil of a waterfall that feeds into a crystal

clear pool of chilly water. The spot got its name because it

was  favored  by  a  legendary  monk  named  Mimshan  who

would sit under the waterfall and meditate for days on end.

He claimed that the purity of the waters helped to cleanse

his mind and heal his body.

Mimshan was secretive about the location of his water-

fall.  He  never  took  anyone  there  with  him,  and  never

marked  the  spot  on  a  map.  Then,  one  day,  the  monk

left his home to visit the site but never returned. Some

say he was waylaid by greedy merchants or rival monks

who wanted to know the location of his famous retreat.

Others  believe  that  he  achieved  such  enlightenment

while sitting under the waterfall that he simply became

one  with  the  multiverse.  The  truth  of  the  matter  will

never be known.

In  the  intervening  years,  though,  many  individuals

claim to have found Mimshans Curtain. And even more

people have sat shivering under waterfalls in the moun-

tains of the Outlands, generally to no effect other than

catching a cold.

Location:  The  Outlands,  in  the  mountains  outside  the

city of Fortitude.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Mimshans  Curtain

Curtain. It is left to the DM to decide whether he is a worthy

pilgrim or a would-be exploiter.

Base Ability: You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks.

ing for 24 hours. You may wear only a light cotton tunic or

breeches, and you may not take any food or drink during the

Mount Sangaree

Over  100  miles  tall,  this  vast  mountain  of  ice  floats

on  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Air,  shrouded  in  cold  fogs

and  howling  wind.  Local  gravity  gives  the  otherwise

directionless  location  a  sense  of  height  and  danger.  At

the apex, a blot of super-chilled yet unfrozen water lies

trapped beneath a thin veneer of ice. It is easy enough to

break  through  the  coating  to  reach  the  water  beneath,

but  the  very  air  freezes  soon  after,  once  more  encasing

the liquid in ice.

Location: The Elemental Plane of Air.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Mount  Sangaree

encounter  table  when  the  characters  visit  the  site  for  the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. If a frost giant

is encountered, it is attempting to establish a lair.

Subsequent Encounters: The Blazing Forge never sits

unattended  for  long.  No  matter  whether  the  characters

negotiated  or  fought  to  gain  access  to  it,  the  forge  is  in

someone elses hands every time the characters return. Roll

on the encounter table again.

Base  Ability:  You  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  Craft  checks

involving metals, and your cost for creating masterwork

items is halved.

Recharge  Condition:  Either  provide  100  pounds  of

pig iron (costing about 20 gp) for the forge, or operate the

bellows  for  one  hour,  taking  1d6  points  of  fire  damage

each minute.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  you  can  fix

anything made  of metal in a single round, as  if a make

whole spell were cast. You accomplish this amazing task

with a DC 20 Craft (blacksmithing) check; if the check

fails, you lose one use of this ability, but the item is not

destroyed.

Higher-Order Uses: 6.

The Blinding Tower

The rumors of a shining citadel of color and light, located

at the very heart of the Plane of Shadow, may be fueled by

162

the  Blinding  Towera  mysterious  edi ce  from  which

emerges a blinding light. This light sweeps out for hundreds

of feet, slowly circling. Shadow creatures caught in the light

suffer excruciating pain, but the light moves slowly enough

that some are able to scurry past and assault the tower, seek-

ing a way to extinguish the beam.

Location: The Plane of Shadow.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Blinding Tower encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. All of the beings encoun-

tered attack intruders.

Subsequent  Encounters:  Once  the  characters  rid  the

area  of  creatures,  on  subsequent  visits  the  chance  of  an

encounter is only 50%. If the PCs fail to visit the location

for more than a year, they must roll for encounters as if they

had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or your

existing darkvision distance increases by 30 feet.

Recharge  Condition:  Look  directly  into  the  light

from the Blinding Tower (DC 20 Fort save or be blinded

for 1d4 hours).

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  you  can  shine  a

light  from  your  eyes  that  heals  damage  as  a  cure  moderate

wounds  spell  (2d8  +1  point  per  character  level,  maximum

+10), with the usual effects against undead creatures. Using

this ability against an unwilling target requires a successful

ranged touch attack.

Higher-Order Uses: 6.

The Fountain of Screams

On  the  245th  layer  of  the  Abyss,  on  an  island  of  black

glass in a vast sea of acid, stands the ruins of a small town

made entirely of that same black glass. Embedded in the

walls  of  this  town  are  its  former  inhabitants,  creatures

that  seem  human  but  might  be  half-elves  or  even  aasi-

mars. All are frozen in attitudes of extreme agony, their

mouths open as if to utter one last scream. In the center

of this macabre village sits a large public fountain, still

working after countless centuriesthough rather than

spraying out water, the fountain sprays out potent, sear-

ing acid.

Location:  The  245th  layer  of  the  In nite  Layers  of  the

Abyss.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Fountain of Screams

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

first  time,  or  for  the  first  time  in  over  a  year.  Though

each  creature  encountered  is  thoroughly  evil,  they  are

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   162

5/20/04, 1:27:56 PM

less interested in combat than in the spectacle of some-

one bathing in the Fountain of Screams. In their excite-

ment, they might even attempt to help someone into the

fountain sooner than that person is readyperhaps even

holding that person under to ensure immersion for the

full duration.

Subsequent Encounters: Because a great many creatures

of the Abyss make this vast acid sea their home, the chance

of an encounter on every subsequent visit is 60%. If the PCs

fail to visit the location for more than a year, they must roll

for encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You can spit a small glob of acid as a stan-

dard  action.  The  glob  of  acid  has  a  range  increment  of  5

feet, with a maximum range of 20 feet, and deals 1d3 points

of damage. The acid does no harm to you, and becomes inert

in less than a round.

Recharge Condition: You must bathe in the Fountain of

Screams (which deals 2d6 points of acid damage per round).

At least 1 round of bathing must consist of complete immer-

sion (which deals 10d6 points of acid damage). The longer

you immerse yourself in the Fountain of Screams, the more

effective the higher-order ability is.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Immediately  after  emerging

from  the  Fountain  of  Screams,  you  gain  the  ability  to

become resistant to acid for short periods. Once per day

as a free action, you gain resistance to acid 10, and it lasts

for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds you

bathed in the Fountain of Screams (to a maximum of 20).

For each round you were fully immersed in the Fountain

of  Screams,  you  may  activate  this  ability  one  additional

time per day. Each activation still counts toward the total

number of uses.

Higher-Order Uses: 6.

The Ice Catacombs

At the core of one of the larger ice pockets on the Elemen-

tal  Plane  of  Water  lies  a  great  iceberg  easily  the  size  of  a

mountain. Into one side of this mountain of ice runs a great

tunnel leading to a vast hall of ice, with columns so tall that

the ceiling is lost to view, hundreds of feet overhead. In this

hall  dwell  aboleths  and  ice  paraelementals,  though  none

of them is responsible for the construction of the mighty

hall. In fact, the craftsmanship of the Ice Catacombs sug-

gests dwarven manufacture, as though a dwarf citadel were

constructed  in  the  heart  of  a  mountain,  somehow  turned

to ice (mountain and all), and transported to the Elemental

Plane of Water.

Location: The Elemental Plane of Water.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Ice Catacombs encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. Most of the mephits and

ice  paraelementals  claim  the  site  as  their  home,  but  the

greater  ice  paraelemental  considers  the  Ice  Catacombs  its

personal palace, and defends it aggressively. Remember

that entering an ice pocket on the Elemental Plane of Water

deals 1d6 points of cold damage each minute to any creature

within the area.

only 30%. If the PCs fail to visit the location for more than

a  year,  they  must  roll  for  encounters  as  if  they  had  never

visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain resistance to cold 5.

Recharge Condition: Embed treasure worth 500 gp

(gems or jewelry) in the ice of the Catacombs  oor.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can create an

area of intense cold about yourself in a 10-foot radius. This

zone of cold drains heat from everything in the area, deal-

ing 1d6 points of cold damage per character level (maximum

10d6) to everything in the area.

Higher-Order Uses: 3.

The Monastery of ZerthAdlun

A githzerai monastery overseen by a 16th-level githzerai

monk named Belthomais, the Monastery of ZerthAdlun

teaches  zerthia  form  of  martial  arts  that  emphasizes

anticipating  an  opponents  next  move.  The  practitioners

of zerthi claim to be able to see a moment into the future as

a result of their training, but in a secret shrine inside the

monastery, the monks meditate over a small pool that grants

the same ability.

Location: The Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Monastery of ZerthAdlun

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. Although the

monks welcome visitors, they may require that the suppli-

cant prove his martial prowess before being admitted to the

chamber of the pool. Such matches are carried out without

weapons,  though  a  monks  unarmed  damage  is  perfectly

acceptable. Most monks strike for nonlethal damage rather

than dealing lethal damage.

herself worthy of a visit to the chamber of the pool, there is

only a 25% chance that the monks will insist on another test

on a subsequent visit. If the PCs fail to visit the location for

more than a year, they must meet the challenge again.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 dodge bonus against melee

attacks.  If  a  melee  opponent  makes  a  full  attack  (two  or

more melee attacks) against you, your dodge bonus increases

to +2.

Recharge Condition: Spend one week training with

the githzerai monks and abiding by their grueling sched-

ule (DC 18 Constitution check or suffer from the effects of

fatigue for 1d4 days after leaving the monastery).

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day  as  a  free  action,

you can look into the immediate future to determine what

a melee opponent will do in the next round. You may then

declare that you are readying an action against that oppo-

nent, without specifying what your action will be, or what

conditions will trigger it. In essence, you are able to allow

your opponent to begin acting, then interrupt him at some

point to take either a standard action, a move action, or a free

action. If you do not use your special readied action before

your next action, this use of the ability is wasted.

Higher-Order Uses: 3.

The Were Glade

Deep in a forest of continual night, the trees part. A circle

of  ancient  obelisks  scrawled  with  generations  of  beast-

marks seems to keep the trees at bay. The opening in the

trees allows the silver moon above to cast its radiance down

unhindered. Where the silver shaft touches the stones, they

take on an inner, answering light. Were wolves often meet

in the glade, to dance under the lambent moon. The Stone

of Wailing and the Stone of Lament are huge boulders that

push up from the earth, revealing just their tips. It is uncer-

tain how these formations received their name.

Location: Karasuthra, third layer of the Beastlands.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Were Glade encounter

table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time, or

for the  rst time in over a year. If a werewolf lord is encoun-

tered, it is attempting to establish a lair.

visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +2 bonus on Handle Animal,

Diplomacy, Bluff, and Sense Motive checks when dealing

with animals, magical beasts, or shapechangers.

Recharge Condition: Scratch a beastmark of your own

onto one of the obelisks in the Were Glade. A beastmark can

be a simple scoring on the stone, or a series of scratches that

represents a bestial image.

Higher-Order  Ability:  You  gain  limited  wolf  lycan-

thropy. Once per day, you can become a werewolf, either

a full wolf or a hybrid between your normal form and that

of a wolf. Once changed, you can maintain your new form

for up to 9 hours. Changing back to your normal form ends

the  effect  and  counts  as  one  use.  While  in  your  alternate

form, you retain full control of your actions and gain most

of  the  bene ts  of  the  lycanthrope  template;  however,  you

cannot pass on the curse of lycanthropy. Once youve made

your  rst visit to the Were Glade, you permanently retain

the  shapechanger  subtype,  even  if  youve  exhausted  all

your uses of the higher-order ability. For full details of the

template, see Creating a Lycanthrope and associated text on

page 175 of the Monster Manual.

The Astral Sojourner

Once a mighty githyanki astral galleon, the Astral Sojourner

is now, effectively, a ghost ship. Lost during a particularly

violent  psychic  storm,  the  ships  captain  is  said  to  have

promised a powerful demon that he would give anything,

if only his ship could reach home once again. The truth

behind this story is unknown, for the Sojourner, when it

appears, is always seen in the midst of a violent psychic

storm, and the crew is long since gone. Those who can steer

the Astral Sojourner back out of the psychic storm are able to

reap great rewards.

Location: A psychic storm on the Astral Plane.

Initial Encounters: When  rst encountered, the Astral

Sojourner is always in the midst of a psychic storm; the char-

acters can reach the lost ship only by braving the dangers of

the storm. Roll once on the tables below for the characters

group and once for each individual.

Sent through random color pool;

see Table 51: Random Color Pools,

in Manual of the Planes.

Base Ability: You treat all destinations on the Astral

Plane as being one step more familiar than they normally

are. Areas you have studied carefully become very familiar

to you, areas you have seen casually are considered to have

been studied carefully, and so on. (The best result you can

get, however, is very familiar.)

Recharge Condition: Pilot the Astral Sojourner safely

out of the psychic storm. This requires a DC 25 Profession

(sailor)  check  and  can  be  attempted  once  per  hour.  If  the

check fails, the character can try again in 1 hour. For each

hour, roll once on the Mental Effects table, above, for each

person aboard the ship.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can summon

a small contingent of githyankithe Sojourners original

crewto aid you, either in battle or in handling a ship.

The crew, consisting of one 5th-level githyanki  ghter, two

3rd-level  githyanki   ghters,  and  ten  1st-level  githyanki

warriors, remain until the battle is over or the characters

ship is out of danger, then vanish. They each have maxi-

mum ranks in Profession (sailor)4 ranks for the captain,

3 ranks for the two mates, and 2 ranks for the crew (its a

cross-class skill for these classes)and either perform any

task that needs doing on a ship or aid a character already

performing the task. Though they understand the charac-

ters language, no matter what tongue the characters speak,

the githyanki do not speak themselves.

In the secret hollows of the petri ed body of a dead god

lost on the Astral Plane, sparks of power yet remain. The

forgotten  deity  Threphocris  contains  many  such  hollows,

though not all connect to one another. One long tunnel

holds  a  forest  of  crystal  stalagmites  and  stalactites  strung

with  pearly  ectoplasm.  A  wind  comes  from  nowhere  and

seemingly goes nowhere, but it cools the long tunnel as if a

breeze on an otherwise too-warm summer day.

(All the hollows within Threphocris appear to be natu-

rally formed caverns of gray stone covered with a thin crys-

talline lattice, like a geode. Pale, wispy-white ectoplasm

drifts through the caverns, ephemeral and essentially harm-

less. The  oating milky strands and gossamer draperies lend

the caves an otherworldly quality. The ectoplasm is sensitive

to psionic energy and is naturally pushed out of any square

occupied by any creature that manifests a psionic power or

has innate psionic spell-like abilities.)

Location: The petri ed body of Threphocris, which drifts

through the Astral Plane.

Subsequent  Encounters:  Once  the  characters  have

steered the Astral Sojourner clear of the psychic storm, there

is a 20% chance that the Sojourner will  nd its way back into

another psychic storm. If the PCs fail to visit the location for

more than a year, they must roll for encounters as if they had

never visited the site.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  you  can  breathe

forth a cone of air that is charged with positive energy. The

cone can be as short as 10 feet or as long as 60 feet. This cures

The Catalogues of Enlightenment

Resting on its own separate cog on the Clockwork Nirvana

of Mechanus, the Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment

is teeming with clerks, functionaries, legal aides, transla-

tors,  mathematicians,  philosophers,  and  bureaucrats  who

have made it their goal to learn each and every law of the

cosmos. Their stronghold contains seemingly endless stacks

of books and tomes, manuals and librams, each discussing

or explaining some facet of natural or universal lawin

effect,  the  source  code  of  the  multiverse.  Once  they  have

collated all of these laws, these mortal researchers believe,

they will hold the very same power of the deities who origi-

nally created the multiverse.

Location: The Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment on

the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Catalogues of Enlight-

enment encounter table when the characters visit the site

for the  rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. The

functionaries of the fortress do not mind allowing seekers

of knowledge access to the libraries, but they are adamant

that  only  the  most  learned  and  wise  should  gain  access

to the fortresss greatest secrets, such as the higher-order

abilities granted by the Catalogues. Thus, whoever seeks

access must debate the nature of the multiverse with a phi-

losopher. If the supplicant can defeat the philosopher in an

opposed Knowledge check (see below for the subject), the

character  can  gain  access.  The  philosopher,  an  8th-level

expert,  has  a  total  skill  modi er  of  +18  in  the  indicated

Knowledge  eld.

Subsequent Encounters: Once admitted to the Cata-

unless a year has passed between visits. The debate at that

point is largely a question of new procedures, rather than

any particular doubt as to the characters knowledge. A char-

acter who loses the debate is shown outside, along with his

companions, and not allowed to return for six months.

Base  Ability:  Choose  a  cleric  domain;  you  gain  the

make a DC 25 Intelligence check to uncover a transla-

tion error, misplaced decimal, mathematical anomaly,

or so forth. You may take 20 on this check (requiring

20 days).

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you may cast a

spell from the cleric domain you have chosen, as though you

had prepared the spell normally. You must be of suf cient

character level to cast the spell and have a Wisdom equal to

10 + the spells level.

The Silent Temple

In  the  steaming  jungles  of  Smargard,  a  massive  temple

lies  nestled  in  the  forking  branches  of  a  vast  tree,  so

high  up  that  the  ground  (if  any  exists)  cannot  be  seen.

All around is the susurrus of the jungle, with occasional

shrill cries or harsh growls of prey and predator. Inside

the  great  temple,  all  is  deadly  quiet,  and  the  structure

seems deserted. But lurking in its labyrinthine depths, the

children of Merrshaulk, the yuan-ti deity, slither through

ancient passageways and perform rites that even their own

god has forgotten.

Location: Smargard, one of the layers of the Infinite

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Silent Temple encoun-

replace it. If the characters defeat the yuan-ti, there is a 20%

chance that more yuan-ti arrive to take their place before

the characters return. If the PCs fail to visit the location for

more than a year, they must roll for temple encounters as if

they had never visited the site.

Recharge Condition: Find and retrieve a citrine (worth

50  gp)  in  a  20-foot-by-20-foot  pit  filled  with  venomous

snakes, enduring 1d4+4 attacks per round from (roll d6)

a Small viper (13), a Medium viper (45), or a Large viper

(6).  Finding  the  citrine  requires  a  DC  25  Search  check,

though magical means can suf ce. The citrine must then

be placed in a bowl of similar gemstones at an idol farther

inside the temple.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can polymorph

yourself into a viper of your same size category. This trans-

formation lasts for 1 minute per your character level, or until

you choose to change back to your natural form.

Higher-Order Uses: 4.

The Stormvault

Controlling the weather on the two layers of the Peaceable

Kingdoms  of  Arcadia  are  four  once-mortal  beings  now

known  as  the  Storm  Kings:  Rain,  Wind,  Lightning,  and

Cloud.  Each  dwells  in  a  mighty  castle,  arranged  precisely

at  equidistant  points  around  Arcadias  Orb  of  Day  and

Night, and from here they work together to provide just the

right mixture of rain and shine for all of Arcadia. The one

place they share together is the Stormvault, a great subter-

ranean cistern containing the power of the storms. Each of

the Storm Kings visits the Stormvault from time to time,

withdrawing power when particularly large atmospheric

phenomena are called for, or returning power when a storm

has  run  its  course.  And  though  they  are  precise  in  their

measurements, even beings as powerful as the Storm Kings

cannot be everywhere, especially on the in nite layers of

Abellio and Buxenus. Thus, the Storm Kings reward those

who aid them in their dutieseverything from rounding

up stray air elementals to controlling the winds and calling

the lightning from the skies and back into the vault.

Location: The Peaceable Kingdoms of Arcadia.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Stormvault encounter

table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time, or

for the  rst time in over a year. Air elementals in the vicinity

of the Stormvault are stray powers of the Storm Kings, who

would not appreciate their destruction. An arrowhawk, on

the other hand, has wandered in from the Elemental Plane

of Air and become curious about the power contained in

the Stormvault.

higher-order ability.

Higher-Order Uses: 2.

Widows Walk

Nestled  in  a  quiet  corner  of  Lolths  Demonweb  Pits  is  a

high spire draped all about with webs. Atop this spire, a

pair of glittering black opals sits at each of the four corners.

Throughout the webs climb thousands of black widow spi-

ders of all different sizes, paying their own special homage

to their Spider Queen. Those who clamber up the webbing

to clear the webs from the opalsand thus, be seen by the

spires eyesare granted special favors.

Location: The Demonweb Pits, the 66th layer of the In -

nite Layers of the Abyss.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Widows Walk encoun-

case, use your character level as the caster level.

Higher-Order Uses: 6.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 9 SITES

Echolost

Where  no  tunnels  reach,  there  can  be  found  the  closed

cavern of Echolost. Vast in size, echoes chase each other

across  the  wide  space  for  eternity.  Some  are  so  complex

that they may be considered creatures in their own right,

though they could not exist outside the space of Echolost.

One  side  of  the  cavern  in  particular,  known  as  the  Wall

of Echoes, is special. It appears as a  at black expanse of

dense,  rocklike  material.  It  absorbs  any  sound  that  falls

upon it, then once again emits that sound minutes, hours,

days,  or  sometimes  many  years  later.  Sages  sometimes

come here just to listen to the wall, hoping to hear whis-

pers  of  knowledge  long  lost.  The  other  major  feature  of

the cavern, the Earthpool, is a basin of dust so  ne that it

appears to be liquid, though woe to those who mistake the

pale dust for water.

Location: The Elemental Plane of Earth.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Echolost encounter

table when the characters visit the site for the first time,

or  for  the  first  time  in  over  a  year.  If  an  eartheurge  is

encountered,  it  is  attempting  to  establish  (or  has  estab-

lished) a lair.

Earth Mastery (Ex): An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus

on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching

the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the

elemental  takes  a  4  penalty  on  attack  and  damage  rolls.

(These modi ers are not included in the statistics block.)

Push (Ex): An earth elemental can start a bull rush maneu-

ver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat

modi ers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to the

elementals opposed Strength checks.

Earth  Glide  (Ex):  An  earth  elemental  can  glide  through

stone, dirt, and almost any other sort of earth (except metal)

as easily as a  sh swims through water. Its burrowing leaves

behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or

other  signs  of  its  presence.  A  move  earth  spell  cast  on  an

The Metacube

Nearly hidden among the buildings, arches,

and doorways of Sigil sits a cube, 10 feet on a

side and composed entirely of mithril. Unlike

practically every other structure in the city,

this  cube  has  no  doors,  windows,  or  other

portals. Its simply a solid block of metal with no  ligree or

adornmentswith one bizarre exception.

Anyone  who  looks  at  the  cube  long  enough  will  see

what at first appears to be a shadow or reflection moving

across its surface. Closer inspection will reveal that this

is  actually  a  sequence  of  numbers  and  letters  that  carve

themselves  into  the  mithrila  great  equation  that  pro-

gresses across the face of the cube. The equation devel-

ops, moving at about an inch per second. It extends about

4  feet  long,  with  the  tail  end  constantly  melting  back

into smooth mithril as the front end continues to build.

It does not move in a straight line, curving from time to

time for no fathomable reason, and occasionally splitting

in two (or more) with each mini-equation following a dif-

ferent path for a while before they meet and rejoin a few

minutes later.

One  of  the  most  interesting  qualities  of  the  equation

is that it can be stopped. If someone puts a hand or other

living  body  part  in  its  path,  the  series  of  numbers  and

symbols stop their progression. (Unliving material has no

effect on the equation.) Once stopped, the only way to get

it going again is for someone to use a knife or other sharp

instrument to carve out the next three numbers or symbols

in the equation, after which the process will continue on

its own again.

Scholars know that the equation is part mathematics, part

arcane notation, and part divine symbology, but they cannot

be certain what it means. Most believe that it is an academic

notation for the state of the multiverse at that particular

moment. They say that the secrets of reality can be found if

one studies the equation long enough. So far, however, no

one has come up with the answer.

Location: The city of Sigil,  oating above the Spire in the

center of the Outlands.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day  as  a  full  round

action,  you  can  improve  the  sturdiness  and  durability  of

one building, piece of sculpture, piece of furniture, or other

constructed  object.  To  do  this,  you  must  spend  the  full

round touching the object in question. At the end of that

period, the object gains a number of hit points equal to your

character level, which may make the object better than new,

even more sturdy than when it was  rst constructed.

Higher-Order Uses: 2.

The Spire of Thorns

The  sprawling  forests  of  Arvandor,  topmost  layer  of  the

Olympian Glades of Arborea, are home to a nearly in nite

number  of  different  plants,  trees,  and  shrubs.  Far  from

Corellons Court, or indeed any settlement, in a stretch

of  woods  that  grows  so  thick  that  the  sun  never  reaches

the forest  oor, a single, poisonous bramble has grown so

tall and strong that it has become a tower whose top fairly

scrapes the canopy of leaves overhead.

Called the Spire of Thorns by the elves of Arvandor, this

tower  has  become  a  way  that  foresters,  rangers,  barbar-

ians, and other folk who relish the wild life use to prove

their  mettle.  They  climb  the  tower  barehanded  while

wearing only a light tunic. The spires thorns are coated

in a poison that addles the wits and dulls the senses, but

completing the task is said to toughen the body against

all toxins.

Location: Arvandor, the topmost layer of Arborea.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Spire of Thorns encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. The elf barbarian is there

to  test  his  mettle  by  climbing  the  spire.  The  elf  may  be

friendly or antagonistic, at the DMs discretion.

Base  Ability:  You  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  saves  against

Recharge Condition: Climb to the top of the spire. This

requires a successful DC 20 Climb check; you may take 10

on  this  check,  but  you  may  not  take  20.  Each  attempt

in icts 1d6 points of damage. If the Climb check fails, you

must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or fall prey

to the brambles poison. The poison has an initial damage

of 1 point of Wisdom and a secondary damage of 1 point

of Dexterity.

Higher-Order Ability: You gain the ability to cast neu-

tralize poison on yourself once per day. The spell functions as

if cast by a 15th-level ranger.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

Yondallas Teeth

Amid the ever-changing chaos of Limbo is an area where

a jumble of alabaster boulders and rocks tumbles through

the miasma, crashing into one another and anything else in

its way. The boulders seem to be drawn to a central point of

gravity. More than anything, they look like a great maw of

teeth chewing up everything in their path.

This  phenomenon  is  just  a  part  of  the  unpredictable

nature  of  Limbothe  lawful  good  goddess  Yondalla  has

nothing  to  do  with  it.  The  place  earned  its  name  because

acrobats and tumblers from all over the multiverse travel to

the Teeth in order to hone their prowess at avoiding injury

even in the most chaotic of circumstances. A disproportion-

ate number of these visitors are hal ings, and so it became

widely, albeit erroneously, supposed that their goddess had

something to do with it.

Every round that a character spends inside Yondallas

Teeth, she takes 2d6 points of damage. A successful DC 15

Re ex save halves the damage.

Location: Limbo.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Yondallas Teeth encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. The rogues are there to test

their skills inside Yondallas Teeth and may be friendly or

antagonistic as the DM prefers.

re ections of himself.) Each re ection, though, is slightly

different. Each one shows the viewer at a different stage in

his life or in the grips of a different emotion, and no two

re ections are identical.

Somewhere in the jumble is a re ection of how the crea-

ture is at that moment in time. It is said that if one can

 nd and concentrate on the true re ection, he will gain

a great insight into himself and his relationships with all

other creatures.

As in a carnivals hall of mirrors, all the re ections make

it dif cult to move around in the Cavern of the Self. Anyone

within the cave takes a 4 penalty on all attack rolls, Re ex

saving throws, and Dexterity-based skill checks. Creatures

that do not rely on eyesight, or those with the blindsense

special  quality,  have  immunity  to  this  effect.  Likewise,  a

character  may  choose  to  close  his  eyes  while  in  the  cave,

taking all the penalties associated with that action.

they are as smooth as glass. In fact, every surface in the cave

Oxyrhynchus

In the midst of an in nite desert is

a ruined city, buried below the

shifting sands, but sometimes

revealing itself in small part in

the  aftermath  of  a  windstorm.

Once it had enclosing walls miles

long, with  ve mighty gates; col-

onnaded  streets,  each  a  mile

long, connecting to the cen-

tral square; a coliseum with

seating  for  thirty  thousand

people;  and  a  grand  temple

to  a  long-forgotten,  jackal-headed

deity.  On  one  side  were  quays,  and  on

the other, a great road led up to the desert

and camel-routes to the oases and gates off-

plane. All around lay small farms and orchards, irrigated

by an annual  ood. Most of the city has been worn away,

but in the center square of Oxyrhynchus, a stone pyramid

still stands, its lines sharp, brooding silently over the ruin

all around.

Inside, if one can bypass the traps, is a domed chamber.

On the ceiling of this large room, luminescent stars are

painted,  still  bright  after  thousands  of  years.  Someone

standing  in  the  center  of  this  chamber  may  invoke  great

power from ancient days.

Location: Demiplane.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Oxyrhynchus encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. Traps are reset by creatures

that come to inhabit the pyramid, or the traps reset them-

selves, sometimes in new, previously clear locations. Such is

the power of the site.

with your chosen weapon, you can make an additional free

attack  at  your  base  attack  bonus  5.  You  can  make  this

extra attack during any round that you can make multiple

attacks,  but  only  with  your  chosen  weapon  type.  This

means that if you are of a high enough level to make addi-

tional attacks (you have at least a +6 or higher base attack

bonus), you could make two additional attacks at your base

attack bonus 5.

Recharge Condition: Hold forth your chosen weapon

and  recite  a  string  of  ancient  words  inscribed  around  the

periphery of the dome. Doing this takes at least 2 minutes

and  involves  calling  on  the  sentinel  of  Oxyrhynchus  to

energize the implement of guardianship.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  you  can  call  up

the power stored in the weapon you charged at the center of

620_17920_PlanarHandbook2.indd   172

5/20/04, 1:28:33 PM

Oxyrhynchus. The weapon is now considered a consumptive

weapon (a new weapon special ability introduced in Chapter

4) and for 10 rounds, the weapon is sheathed in light-sucking

negative energy. The energy does not harm the wielder. A

consumptive weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of damage

on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted

bestow the energy upon their ammunition.

Higher-Order Uses: 4.

Pilgrims Rest

Pilgrims Rest is a graveyard on both the Material Plane

and the Ethereal Plane. On the Material Plane, it is a pau-

pers  eld where the bodies of those who could afford no

comfort or solitude in life  nd eternal rest under similar

conditions.  Mass  graves  are  the  norm,  and  remains  are

rarely laid in restful reposethey are generally thrown

into the earth haphazardly. Whats more, murderers often

use the  eld as a convenient place to hide the evidence of

their handiwork.

On the Ethereal Plane, the spirits of those who cannot

or refuse to go on to their eternal rest linger. Some are eter-

nally bound to the spot where their body lies. Others have

no idea who killed them, and so have no idea where to go

in search of revenge. Still others simply feel that they have

un nished business in the world of the living but have no

place other than this from which to center their activities

and no way to communicate with the living to get their

 nal affairs in order.

Pilgrims  Rest  is  one  of  the  most  profoundly  sorrowful

places in the multiverse. Sadness permeates both the Mate-

rial and Ethereal sides of the location. From time to time,

however, an altruistic soul comes here for the express pur-

pose of easing anothers pain. Through magic or psionics,

she discovers a simple task that one of the departed souls

needs performed and acts as a proxy for that tortured spirit,

hopefully  allowing  it  to  leave  its  former  life  behind  and

move on to its next level of existence.

Location: The Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Pilgrims Rest encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year. Some of the spirits in

Pilgrims Rest are malevolent, while others are peaceful.

The DM may decide the speci c temperament and goals of

whatever creature the characters encounter.

visit the location for more than a year, they must roll for

encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base  Ability:  You  gain  a  permanent  connection  to  the

Ethereal  Plane.  Because  of  this,  whenever  you  are  on  the

Material Plane, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

Recharge Condition: Perform a simple task (pass a mes-

sage to a loved one,  x a broken window, and so on) for one

of the spirits in Pilgrims Rest. The DM may determine the

exact nature of this task, but it should not take more than

half a day to accomplish, nor should it require combat.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you gain the ben-

e ts of ethereal jaunt for a number of rounds equal to your

character level.

Higher-Order Uses: 2.

The Valley of Thunder

Among  the  rolling  hills  of  Brux,  the  second  layer  of  the

Wilderness  of  the  Beastlands,  is  a  valley  that  is  home  to

the massive reptiles known as dinosaurs. On most worlds,

dinosaurs ruled the land until the rise of dragons or until

some  natural  calamity  culled  their  numbers  enough  to

allow a humanoid race to  ourish. In the Valley of Thunder,

though, they remain the undisputed masters, and any crea-

ture that knows whats good for itself will give the ancient

lizards as wide a berth as possible.

Not all the dinosaurs are dangerous, of course. Some are

carnivorous and some are vegetarian, but like most animals,

they want nothing more than to live out their lives follow-

ing natures simple requirementseating, sleeping, and

mating at the appropriate times. But being as big as they are,

dinosaurs can cause trouble for smaller creatures in many

unintended ways. And, of course, the great hunters, such

as the Tyrannosaurus, consider anything that moves to be a

potential meal.

Location: Brux, the second layer of the Beastlands.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Valley  of  Thunder

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 11 SITES

The Breaching Obelisk

In one of the many nameless demiplanes, there stands a

single squat metallic obelisk carved with many faded runes

whose meanings are obscure, or perhaps without meaning.

The four-sided obelisk (60 feet by 60 feet by 97 feet high) is

forged of astral driftmetal (see Chapter 4: Equipment and

Magic Items). In addition to serving as a planar touchstone,

the Breaching Obelisk and its environs commonly breach

on  extraplanar  and  Material  Plane  locations  (see  Planar

Breaching  in  this  chapter),  according  to  a  complicated

schedule. The demiplane that contains the Breaching Obe-

lisk is only about 1,000 feet in radius. It has all the traits

of the Material Plane, plus one additional trait that usually

leaks  into  the  destination  plane  when  breaching  occurs:

wild magic.

The  breaching  schedule  is  somehow  controlled  by  the

obelisk itself. The DM may determine his own schedule, or

use this: The obelisk visits one location on each of the planes

of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS cosmology, one every other

day,  for  a  breach  duration  of  1  day  each.  Those  who  suc-

ceed on a DC 40 Knowledge (the planes) check can choose

the destination plane and intraplanar location if allowed 8

hours  of  uninterrupted  concentration  while  maintaining

physical contact with the obelisk prior to a breach.

Location: A demiplane.

Initial Encounters: Roll twice on the Breaching Obe-

lisk encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

 rst time. Because the Breaching Obelisk serves as such a

handy way to travel, a wide variety of creatures can be found,

sometimes existing in harmony, other times at each others

necks, according to their natures.

Base Ability: You gain a +3 competence bonus on Knowl-

edge (the planes) checks.

Recharge  Condition:  Maintain  continuous  physical

contact with the obelisk for at least 8 hours.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can instantly

enter another time frame, speeding up so greatly that all

other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still

moving  at  their  normal  speeds.  You  are  free  to  act  for  1

round of apparent time. Normal and magical  re, cold, acid,

and the like can still harm you. While you are accelerated,

other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells;

you cannot target such creatures with any attack or spell. A

spell that affects an area and has a duration that is longer than

the remaining duration of your temporal acceleration has its

normal effects on other creatures once the power ends.

You  cannot  move  or  harm  items  held,  carried,  or  worn

by a creature stuck in the standard time frame, but you can

affect any item that is not in another creatures possession.

While accelerated, you are undetectable and cannot enter

an area of dead magic.

When  the  acceleration  lapses,  you  are  disoriented  on

your return to the standard time frame. You take a 4 pen-

alty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for

2 rounds.

Higher-Order Uses: 2.

The Eye of Gunragh

The Astral Plane is perhaps the most desolate place in the

multiverse, with only a smattering of solid matter, the pet-

ri ed bodies of dead gods, and the rolling astral winds to

disturb the endless silver void. The winds, however, some-

times coalesce into a psychic storm that disturbs the eternal

silence, making it impossible for anyone to travel across that

particular part of astral space. These storms usually pass

relatively quickly, but from time to time, a squall will  are

into a psychic tempest that ravages the astral landscape for

decades or even centuries.

Tempest Gunragh is the largest and longest-lived psychic

storm ever recorded. It has been raging for well over 2,500

years  and  shows  no  signs  of  abating.  During  that  time,

Gunragh has wandered over a huge area, wreaking damage

on  dozens  of  githyanki  communities  and  even  shattering

the remains of several smaller dead deities.

Although Tempest Gunragh is incredibly destructive, like

a terrestrial hurricane, it whirls around a calm center, known

as its eye. Unlike terrestrial storms, though, a psychic tem-

pest is roughly spherical in shape, so it is impossible to see

this eye or approach it from a relatively safe angle. However,

some have braved the ravages of the storm to  nd and enter

the  eye.  They  report  that  it  is  the  most  transcendently

peaceful place they have ever visited and that they experi-

enced complete clarity of thought and emotion that forever

changed their outlooks on life.

Location: The Astral Plane.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Eye of Gunragh encoun-

ter table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time,

or for the  rst time in over a year.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 bonus on Will saving throws.

Recharge Condition: Travel through the psychic tempest

to reach the Eye of Gunragh. To  nd the center requires three

successful DC 30 Knowledge (the planes) checks or six success-

ful DC 30 Survival checks. Each time you attempt a check, you

must also make a DC 13 Will saving throw. If the saving throw

fails, you (or your silver cord) take 1d10 points of damage.

Juiblexs Grasp

One  part  of  the  Slime  Pits  is  very  much  the  same  as  any

othera bubbling morass of ooze and sludge dotted here

and there with multicolored fungus. Many visitors have dif-

 culty navigating the realm of Juiblex because they cannot

tell one place from another, but one area is like no other:

Juiblexs Grasp.

Juiblexs Grasp is a shallow bay of slime that completely

covers a rich forest of mushrooms. The hidden fungus makes

negotiating the passage treacherous, tripping unwary pedes-

trians. In addition, the  ow of the slime is so funneled that

in several places vicious riptides and undertows can suck a

Medium humanoid several hundred feet away in just a few

seconds.  Tales  speak  of  seasoned  adventurers  losing  their

footing, falling into the slime, and never being seen again.

Location: The Slime Pits, the 222nd layer of the Abyss.

Buxenus has a center, it is also true that both layers are in nite

in size. These are just two of the many seeming contradictions

to be found in the boundless reaches of the multiverse.)

Although the river rushes wildly as it approaches the

precipice, it becomes calm and tranquil at a spot just before

the water plunges over the edge. This location is known as

the Lip of Purity, and it is a meditation spot favored by many

devotees of law. It is a perfect metaphor, they say, for the way

that adherence to the rules of nature provides peace, purity,

and protection in even the most dangerous situations.

The Mausoleum of Icy Fear

A cemetery in the Abyss whose graves are

carved  into  the  surface  of  a  frozen  ocean

hosts many mausoleums, gravestones, and

buried tombs. In fact, the entire cemetery

is actually just part of a far greater necropo-

lis, though it doesnt pay to wander in the

greater  city,  where  its  warlike  legions  of

retrievers, vampiric giants, and liches rule

a  greater  population  of  zombies,  ghouls,

wights, and motionless, decaying corpses.

No, better to remain among the towering

funeral obelisks, crypt parapets, and icy

mausoleums of this corner of the cemetery

where the dead are mostly quiet.

Here, a mausoleum carved directly from the icy substrate

stands. Its doors, though, are bone panes on which carved

glyphs warn away trespassers. Inside is an empty space, a

chasm that plunges straight into the icy ocean. No one has

ever plumbed its depths. And from these unknown depths

issues the icy presence of fear.

Any creature who opens the bone doors is subject to a fear

spell as cast by a 20th-level caster (DC 30).

Location: The city of Naratyr in the 113th layer of the

Abyss.

against cold effects.

Recharge Condition: Descend at least 100 feet into the

shaft capped by the mausoleum (which in icts 5d6 points

of cold damage, no save).

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can consume

points, the subject must make a Fortitude save (DC 14 + your

Wis modi er) or die. If the target dies, you gain 1d8 tempo-

rary hit points and a +2 bonus to Strength. Your effective

caster level goes up by one, improving spell effects depen-

dent on caster level. (This increase in effective caster level

does not grant you access to more spells.) These effects last

for 10 minutes per level or Hit Die of the target creature.

The Red Pit

The Bastion of Last Hope on Carceri boasts what are widely

considered to be the bleakest, most soul-crushingly dismal

dungeons in the multiverse. They are not the cruelest, nor

the  most  inescapable,  but  something  about  their  nature

seems  to  sap  a  prisoners  resolution  and  will  to  survive.

Worst among these is known as the Red Pit.

Although the residents of the Bastion refer to it as a cell,

the Red Pit really is no more than a rough-hewn, 100-foot-

deep hole in the ground into which the most hard-bitten

criminals are thrown. An iron gate is then placed over the

opening and the prisoner is left there, rarely for longer than

a day or two. When the gate is withdrawn and the offender

is removed, he is a mere shell of his former self. Most visitors

to the Red Pit enter with overwhelming self-con dence and

bravado but come out scared of their own shadows.

Exactly what gives the pit this effect is uncertain, but it

does  have  some  striking  characteristics.  Foremost,  about

halfway  down,  the  rock  appears  to  change  color  from  a

mottled brown to a deep red the color of blood. This is con-

sidered to be an optical illusion, because samples removed

from the wall have no noticeable discoloration when exam-

ined under torch or sunlight.

Location: Othrys, the  rst layer of Carceri.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Red Pit encounter table

when the characters visit the site for the  rst time, or for the

 rst time in over a year. If the encounter happens in the Red

Pit (as opposed to some nearby chamber within the Bastion

of Last Hope), everyone in the pit is subject to the effects

granted by meeting the recharge condition.

30 minutes in the Red Pit must make one saving throw for

every hour or portion thereof they spend in the hole.)

The Shrine of Acererak

dark stone stands alone before a sealed mausoleum of cold

iron. The statue is of a humanoid skull and measures 5 feet

tombs and unmarked graves studding a vast tunnel along

which howling winds blow mournfully. Undead of various

sorts prowl this forgotten graveyard.

attack them, after which they react normally (attacking a

single undead that belongs to a group of adjacent undead

causes all in the group to likewise treat you normally).

Recharge Condition: Kiss the idol of Acererak.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you can in uence

one  undead  within  50  feet.  To  in uence  the  undead,  you

must  indicate  a  course  of  activity  (limited  to  a  sentence

or two). This direction may not be to take some obviously

harmful act such as to impale itself or leap into a vat of acid;

however, an undead may be directed to leave the area, defend

you, or defeat a former ally or master. An in uenced undead

acts on its direction until one of the following conditions is

met: its assigned task is completed, a number of hours equal

shoot a leaf of a particular color out of midair, pinning it to

a target (hopefully in the bullseye).

Location: Mertion, the  fth layer of Celestia.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Fields  of  Autumn

encounter  table  when  the  characters  visit  the  site  for  the

Subsequent Encounters: Once the characters clear out

the area, on subsequent visits the chance of an encounter is

a  year,  they  must  roll  for  encounters  as  if  they  had  never

visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls.

Recharge  Condition:  Using  a  ranged  weapon,  shoot  a

red leaf from the air and pin it to a speci c target or tree.

This is the equivalent of hitting Armor Class 30.

Higher-Order  Ability:  Once  per  day,  for  a  number  of

rounds equal to your character level, you gain a +5 compe-

tence bonus on ranged attacks. Furthermore, for the dura-

tion of this effect, you may double the range increment of

any ranged weapon you  re.

Higher-Order Uses: 3.

The Great Orrery

In the heart of the endless sea of cogs,  ywheels, and spindles

that make up the Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus, a rela-

tively small cog ticks in perfect harmony with its surround-

ings. This cog would be completely unremarkable except for

the spinning circular mechanism that sits at its center. The

mechanism, called the Great Orrery, is a perfect model of the

multiverse from the heart of the Material Plane to the most

distant Outer Plane. (See the map of the planes, page 137.)

No one ever sees the Great Orrery move, but every time

one looks away for even an instanteven for the blink of an

eyethe mechanism has advanced a turn or the arrangement

of individual cubes and spheres has been changed. No one

knows who designed or built the Great Orrery, let alone why.

Indeed, no one even understands why it functions the way it

does. The internal gears are not in synch with the observed

external movements, sometimes moving only in tiny incre-

ments,  but  other  times  completely  rearranging  themselves

several times within a few minutes. It is said, though, that by

studying the Orrery, you gain a glimpse into how the multi-

verse functions (at least at that moment in time).

Location: Mechanus.

the undead is redirected, or someone else with the ability to

turn or command undead successfully affects the directed

undead. The direction can continue for the entire duration

(a  number  of  hours  equal  to  your  character  level).  If  the

direction can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends

when the undead  nishes what it was asked to do. You can

instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity

during the duration. For example, you might suggest that an

undead give directions to the  rst traveler it meets. If the

condition is not met before the duration expires, the activity

is not performed.

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 12 SITES

The Fields of Autumn

In Mertion, the  fth layer of Celestia, a vast open plain is

dotted with small groves of elm and oak trees that eternally

wear their colorful autumn foliage. Orange, red, and yellow

leaves hang heavy on the trees and blow lazily through the

mountain air.

These   elds  are  a  favorite  training  ground  for  paladins

and celestials who favor bows, crossbows, and other ranged

weapons. There is plenty of space to set up archery ranges,

and  the  task  at  hand  is  made  all  the  more  challenging

because  of  the  leaves  that   oat  distractingly  between  the

The Life Molds of Neumannus

On  a  free- oating,  clocklike  cog  wheel  some  900  feet  in

diameter stands a building bristling with smokestacks, which

projects from either side of the two-dimensional cog. Called

Neumannus, this is a factory of sorts that turns out creatures

known as inevitables. Inevitables are constructs that have

taken it upon themselves to uphold the laws of the cosmos.

But not all inevitables follow the law.

Living  entities  are  not  allowed  to  visit  Neumannus,

or  usually  suffered  even  to  know  its  location.  However,

certain  constructs  with  less  moral  character  than  their

counterparts  allow  living  visitors  access  through  secret

back doors and into a mold chamber. This is where inevi-

tables take form, gaining animation. And, with the proper

knowledge, it is where biologicals can be subtly modi ed

with machine features.

Location: Mechanus.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Life Molds encounter

table when the characters visit the site for the  rst time, or

for the  rst time in over a year.

initial contact within the Life Mold complex, on subsequent

visits the chance of an encounter is only 10%. If the PCs fail

to visit the location for more than a year, they must roll for

encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You have a construct-inspired resistance to

certain weaknesses of the  esh, granting you a +2 bonus on

saving throws against disease, paralysis, poison, or stunning.

Recharge Condition: Deliver several quarts of your blood

(which some inevitables prize for their own reasons) to the

construct currently running the secret life molds out of

Neumannus.  Upon  payment,  the  inevitable  will  enclose

your body in a mold and instigate the special process that

ity score (to a minimum of 1). You need not (and cannot)

hits. You have an arcane spell failure chance of 25% and a 4

armor check penalty. You cannot drink (and thus cant use

potions) or play wind instruments. Your unarmed attacks

deal  damage  equal  to  a  club  sized  for  you  (1d4  for  Small

characters or 1d6 for Medium characters), and you are con-

sidered armed when making unarmed attacks. Your weight

increases  by  a  factor  of   ve,  causing  you  to  sink  in  water.

However, you could survive the crushing pressure and lack

of air at the bottom of the oceanat least until the duration

of the power expires.

The Pillar of Skulls

On the  rst of the Nine Hells of Baator is a mountainous

pile  of  skulls  collected  as  trophies  in  the  Blood  War.  The

skulls can be as large as a house or as tiny as a pebble, and

they are in various states of decay. The devils leave them

here in part as a way to celebrate their victories, but just as

much  as  a  way  to  show  fealty  to  Tiamat,  the   ve-headed

queen of all evil dragons, whose cave is nearby.

It has long been rumored that the skulls themselves con-

tain some magical power. Some say that they are enchanted

and  can  be  fashioned  into  impregnable  armor,  while

others say that if properly treated with alchemical elixirs,

they  become  highly  unstable  and  explode  upon  even  the

slightest impact. None of these rumors is true, but enough

treasure seekers have come skulking around the pillar that

a cadre of osyluths has been assigned to stand guard. They

will  attack  anyone  they  catch  approaching  the  Pillar  of

Skulls,  no  matter  how  outmatched  they  might  bethey

fear Tiamats retribution more than they do death in battle.

Location: Avernus, the  rst layer of Baator.

The Temple of Radiance

The Temple of Radiance sits atop a tiny spit of rock that

juts from the waters of Thalasia, the bottommost layer of

Elysium.  It  is  a  temple  to  Pelor,  god  of  the  sun,  built  in

the classic style. Walls, columns, and arches measure out

the  forms  of  various  rooms  and  chambersincluding  a

large central chapelbut none of these areas has even the

pretense of a roof or other covering. The entire building

is open to the sky so that worshipers may follow the sun

along its celestial journey.

Some claim that this was the very  rst shrine ever built in

Pelors name; others say that it is merely the most beautiful.

Whatever the truth, the Temple of Radiance is one of the

most popular pilgrimage destinations for worshipers who

have the wherewithal to travel to and within Elysium. The

temple generally receives anywhere from a dozen to several

hundred visitors per day.

Of  course,  since  the  Temple  of  Radiance  is  so  highly

valued by worshipers, it occasionally comes under attack

from  enemies  of  Pelor  (in  particular,  by  worshipers  of

Nerull). To protect the pilgrims from this and other dan-

gers, a cadre of holy warriors, known as the Radiant Guard-

ians, protect the island.

Location: Thalasia, the lowest layer of Elysium.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Temple of Radiance

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

first time, or for the first time in over a year. The Radiant

Guardians  are  cautious  if  visitors  arrive  heavily  armed,

but they will welcome anyone who has come to worship

at the Temple.

Ashardalons Tongue

Khalas, the  rst layer of the bleak eternity of Gehenna, has

hundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  of  lava   ows  pouring  con-

stantly across its sloped face. The largest and most destruc-

tive of these is known as Ashardalons Tongue.

Named  after  an  ancient  red  dragon  that  terrorized

several  planes  of  existence,  Ashardalons  Tongue  is  aptly

named.  It  is  wide  and  deep  where  it  bursts  from  the

ground high up on the mountain, but it tapers to a forked

point lower down on the slopes where it cools. Addition-

ally, the bottom end is in more or less constant motion

like a geologically slow snakes tongue flicking here and

there. The tip of Ashardalons Tongue only moves about

300 feet a day, but it travels over a range of about 8 miles,

and there is no way to accurately predict where it will

go next.

Location: Khalas, the  rst layer of Gehenna.

Densahls Challenge

Every day on the Plain of Ida, warriors and champions test

themselves and their prowess in contests of skill and martial

cunning. Valiant heroes from across the multiverse engage

in games of strategy, speed, and raw strength. The most

famous of the latter is known as Densahls Challenge.

At   rst,  Densahls  Challenge  seems  like  nothing  more

than a rocky tor sticking out from the grassy  eld. It stands

about 20 feet tall and is made of a rose-colored stone very

similar to granite. Long ago, a mighty dwarf warrior named

Densahl  (who  had  just  won  an  ale-quaf ng  competition)

stumbled  into  the  tor  and  took  exception  to  it  being  in

his way. He climbed to the top of the rock and announced

that he would break it to a thousand pieces so that it never

bothered anyone again. He only managed one swing of his

hammer before passing out, but that single blow broke off a

boulder the size of Densahls head and shoulders. The crowd

was impressed, but many claimed they could do better. One

by one, they climbed the stone to try, and the tradition con-

tinues to this day.

Densahls  Challenge  is  quite  simple.  Contestants  carry

sledgehammers  to  the  top  of  the  tor,  call  out  their  names

and af liations, and then swing the hammer with all their

might. The goal is to break off as large a piece of the rock

as  possible.  The  record  blow  was  struck  by  none  other

than Kord himselfa boulder the size of a workhorse. No

matter how many warriors break off signi cant chunks of

the stone, though, each day the tor is just as tall as ever.

Although  the  warriors  who  frequent  the  Plain  of  Ida

can  be  quite  competitive,  and  many  climb  the  tor  time

and again to outdo their rivals, Densahls Challenge is a

friendly competition. No matter what the result of an indi-

vidual swing, the onlookers (a crowd of spectators is always

present at Densahls Challenge) raise a mighty cheer in the

contestants honor.

Location: Ysgard, the top layer of Ysgard.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Densahls Challenge

encounter table when the characters visit the site for the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. The creatures

they meet may well be arrogant or belligerent, but they will

not be evil. The PCs have a relatively good chance of nego-

tiating  these  encounters  peacefullyor  at  least  without

serious injury (contests of strength or martial prowess may

take the place of actual battle).

Subsequent  Encounters:  Once  the  characters  have

established their presence in the area, on subsequent visits

the chance of an encounter is only 50%. If the PCs fail to

visit  the  location  for  more  than  a  year,  they  must  roll  for

encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 bonus on melee damage rolls.

Recharge Condition: Participate in Densahls Challenge.

To gauge your results, make a single melee attack roll using

a sledgehammer (treat as a warhammer) with the following

results. Unless you roll a 1, the blow lands true (rolling a 1

results in the hammer breaking). If you threaten a critical

hit, roll to con rm the critical hit even though youre attack-

ing an object. The weight of the piece of rock you break off

depends on how much damage you deal.

Restyns Last Stand

Among  the  Battleplains  of  Avalas,  the  first  layer  of  the

infernal battle eld of Acheron, is a small cube that orbits

Scourgehold, the cube that holds Hextors realm. The tiny

cube hosts the ruins of what was once a modest fortress, the

home of a Heironeous-worshiping planetar named Restyn.

She  chose  this  location  despite  (indeed,  because  of)  its

proximity to Hextors domain. Her fellow angels told her

that she was madthe cube was small and worthless, and

Hextor was welcome to it. These words did not faze Restyn

in the least.

For years that stretched into decades and eventually into

centuries,  she  and  her  followers  defended  their  chosen

home  against  attacks  from  the  nearby  bastion  of  evil.

Wave  after  wave  of  Hextorites  threw  themselves  against

the fortress, only to be driven back by Restyns righteous

fury.  However,  no  defense  is  impenetrable,  and  the  tide

of opponents was never-ending. Restyn and her followers

eventually fell.

Although they crushed the planetar and the forces of

good at her command, the Hextorites were unable to lay

claim to the cube. Every time they tried, a force of Heiro-

nean angels drove them back to Scourgehold. The angels,

it seemed, now considered the cube sacred ground, hal-

lowed by the determination and blood of Restyn and her

followers. They would now pay any price to keep it free

from Hextor and his followers. The irony of this fact is

not lost on the Heironeans, but it does nothing to soften

their stance.

Location: Avalas, the  rst layer of Acheron.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Restyns Last Stand

encounter table whenever the characters visit the site. The

Heironeans and the Hextorites each have the goal of driving

from the cube anyone who is not speci cally aligned with

them. If the characters are not their allies, then they will be

treated as enemies.

ENCOUNTER LEVEL 14 SITES

The Peak of Continuation

The Peak of Continuation is not one of the tallest mountains

in Shurrock, one of the two facing layers of the Twin Para-

dises of Bytopia. It is, however, one of the most challenging

to climb. The mountain has a double summittwin peaks

that are separated by a 100-foot-wide chasm over nothing

but the steep, gravelly slopes. The peaks are connected by a

simple rope bridge.

In a land that is renowned for harsh weather, formidable

terrain, and being an especially dif cult place for even the

most skilled outdoorsmen to simply survive a few days in

the wild, the Peak of Continuation is a challenge that even

the  hardiest  of  locals  usually  shy  away  from.  The  winds

blow  nearly  constantly  in  excess  of  100  miles  per  hour,

the air is bitterly cold, and the mountain is home to several

dangerous carnivores.

Still, those who have succeeded at crossing the span atop

the  Peak  of  Continuation  say  that  it  was  a  life-changing

experience. They now have looked death in the face without

blinking, and they feel prepared to do so again.

Location: Shurrock, one of the layers of Bytopia.

The Sargasso of Entropy

The Negative Energy Plane is an endless void that is darker

than  the  blackest  night  and  emptier  than  the  most  evil

heart.  Here  and  there,  one  can   nd  voidstonesnegative

energy so densely concentrated that it becomes solid matter.

But in one especially dismal corner of the plane, a number

of voidstones have accumulated to form a shifting congrega-

tion of annihilation known as the Sargasso of Entropy.

The  sargasso  is  one  of  the  most  deadly  locations  in  the

multiverse. Every one of the voidstones is powerful enough

to completely wipe out anything it touches. Together, swirl-

ing in the unpredictable, chaotic way they do, the voidstones

are practically unavoidablegetting any closer to the sar-

gasso than a few dozen feet is practically an act of suicide.

The Sargasso of Entropy is a sacred site for those who wor-

ship Wee Jas, Nerull, and other deities associated with death.

Champions of life, on the other hand, occasionally visit the

spot because it is so closely attuned to death. They believe that

seeing it and feeling its power will focus their resolve to resist

the inevitable, withering end that waits for all creatures.

Location: The Negative Energy Plane.

Initial  Encounters:  Roll  on  the  Sargasso  of  Entropy

encounter  table  when  the  characters  visit  the  site  for  the

 rst time, or for the  rst time in over a year. Pale raiders are a

cult of death slaadi clerics who have rededicated themselves

to the pursuit of magical power for the purpose of honoring

death in all its myriad forms.

APPENDIX:

PLANAR ENCOUNTERS

When generating random encounters for a planar adventure,

youll need to consider several factors: Who are the natives of

the plane? Is the area visited wilderness, rural, or urban? If it

is part of planar trade routes, nonnative extraplanar creatures

will have a signi cant presence. If it is far removed from gates,

portals, and similar mechanisms of planar travel, most of the

creatures encountered will be native to the plane.

BUILDING A PLANE-SPECIFIC

ENCOUNTER TABLE

The  information  in  Random  Wilderness  Encounters  on

pages 9598 of the Dungeon Masters Guide gives instructions

and  advice  on  how  to  create  random  encounter  tables.  To

apply those techniques to the planes, all you need are the fol-

lowing lists that provides the Challenge Ratings and typical

planar residences of outsiders and extraplanar creatures.

In  addition  to  the  creatures  native  to  each  plane,  some

creatures are found on virtually every plane. Apply the tem-

plates to the planes inhabitants or to everyday creatures to

create diverse, unique encounter lists.

In the following lists, the titles of books are abbreviated

as follows: MM = Monster Manual; MM2 = Monster Manual II;

FF = Fiend Folio; Drac = Draconomicon; MH = Miniatures Hand-

book; MotP = Manual of the Planes; BoED = Book of Exalted Deeds;

BoVD = Book of Vile Darkness; ELH = Epic Level Handbook; and

PH = Planar Handbook (this volume).

The Planar Handbook describes extraplanar locations

suffused with the power of all existence that are known

as planar touchstones. Characters linked to these natu-

ral hubs of planar activity can tap their power for per-

sonal use, gaining abilities that reflect the nature of the

specific locations. But gaining power from the planes is

not without risk, and those wishing to exploit their

planar connections to the utmost must brave the dan-

gers of the touchstones with which they are linked.

Dozens of planar touchstones are described in the

Planar Handbook, complete with abilities gained and

specific perils of the locations. Now designers Bruce

Cordell,  Gwendolyn  Kestrel,  JD  Wiker,  and  Skip

Williams offer four additional planar touchstones for

plane-hopping PCs to exploit.

PLANAR TOUCHSTONES

The cosmological association of linked planes, demi-

planes, and connected dimensional realms creates a

vast network through which the energy of existence

itself is channeled. Less-connected planes and demi-

planes are the nodes of this network, and the most

highly connected planes are the hubs. These hubs,

known as planar touchstones, are usually suffused with

excess energy by virtue of their numerous connections.

Thus, many of them are legendary sites of power, or at

least places resonant with mythic possibility.

The Planar Touchstone feat described in the Planar

Handbook allows a character who possesses a portable

object native to a given touchstone to forge a link with

it. Such a linkage grants the character a base ability that

is always active. A personal visit to the touchstone site

discharges its inherent power directly into the linked

character, granting her a higher-order ability that she

can call upon a limited number of times. Additional

visits to that planar touchstone can revitalize this

charge, restoring the number of available uses of the

ability to maximum.

If a character with the Planar Touchstone feat visits a

touchstone other than the one to which she is linked,

the base ability of the new site replaces that of the old

one. In like manner, the character immediately gains

the higher-order ability of the new site and loses any

remaining uses of the one corresponding to the old

site. Characters intimately familiar with planar touch-

stones often refer to visiting multiple such sites as

taking the touchstone tour.

In addition to conferring benefits on characters,

planar touchstone sites can serve as story elements for

campaigns. For instance, a prophecy might state that a

1

particular scourge can be overcome only by one who

looks upon the stars of Oxyrhynchus (see Planar Hand-

book, page 172). On a less dramatic scale, planar touch-

stones also make great alternatives to treasurewhen

characters overcome a particularly difficult threat asso-

ciated with a touchstone site, the higher-order ability

gained makes a good reward.

WHAT MAKES A TOUCHSTONE?

A touchstone site is often special in some way that goes

beyond its status as a hub of the cosmological network.

Relatively few touchstones exist on the Material Plane,

but almost every one of them has historical or geo-

graphical importance, or is significant for some other

reason besides its cosmological status. For example,

one  Material  Plane  touchstone  is  the  peak  of  the

worlds tallest mountain.

Planar locations previously described in other game

products might also be considered planar touchstones.

Adventurers might have known about and even visited

such a site several times without ever realizing that it

had the power to confer special abilities. Determining

the base and higher-order abilities conferred by these

sites is an exercise for the DM (see the Behind the Cur-

tain sidebar on page 154 of the Planar Handbook for

instructions on creating touchstone abilities.)

Some very powerful characters  eventually gain the

ability to create small demiplanes. Such fledgling loca-

tions can never be planar touchstones, but after several

thousand years of growth, linkage, and expansion, such

a created plane could become host to one or more

planar touchstones.

TRAVELING TO TOUCHSTONE SITES

A character who lacks the ability to visit a touchstone

site cannot access the higher-order ability inherent to

it. Thus, anyone who wishing to take the Planar Touch-

stone feat and forge a link to a particular planar loca-

tion should possess a reliable method of reaching it.

Perhaps the character knows of a permanent portal that

opens near the touchstone, or has access to spells such

as plane shift, either personally or via a friend. Whatever

the method of transportation, the character must have

access to a method that is at least somewhat reliable.

But reaching the planar touchstone is the only first

step. Some planar touchstones have environments that

are inimical to nonnative life. In particular, elemental

planes  require  some  preparation  because  of  their

energy-dominant traits. For instance, the planar touch-

stone location called the Burning Rift (see the Planar

Handbook) is located on the Elemental Plane of Fire.

Unless a linked character arranges for proper protec-

tion, his visit to this touchstone may be short.

TOUCHSTONES ON THE PLANES

The following section offers four new planar touch-

stone locations. Each of these sites is described in the

following format.

Name: The most common name or names of the

planar touchstone are given in this entry.

Description: Each location has a description that

details its appearance and general conditions.

Location: This entry provides the planar location

of the touchstone, if known. The major planes of exis-

tence are described starting on page 151 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide. Refer to those descriptions for details,

especially when a character must travel through some

of the intervening planar locations before arriving at

the touchstone.

Initial Encounters: This entry offers informa-

tion on the type of encounters that characters may face

on their first visit to the touchstone. An encounter

table is provided, if appropriate.

Subsequent Encounters: Information on the

type of encounters characters may face on subsequent

visits to the touchstone is given here.

Base Ability: This entry describes the base ability

gained by a character who takes the Planar Touchstone

feat and links to this site. This ability is always available

to the character (to the limits of any supernatural abil-

ity) and has unlimited uses.

Recharge Condition: Many planar touchstones

require not only a visit, but also the fulfillment of some

condition in order to recharge the higher-order ability

it confers. The linked character need not fulfill this

condition to gain the planar touchstones base ability,

but she must do so each time she recharges the higher-

order ability.

Higher- Order Ability: A character with the

Planar Touchstone feat who visits the touchstone and

fulfills its recharge condition gains this ability. It can

be used a limited number of times before recharging,

which requires another visit to the touchstone and ful-

fillment of its recharge condition. All higher-order abil-

ities are considered either supernatural or spell-like, as

indicated in the individual descriptions. Each such

ability is usable only once per day.

Higher- Order Uses: Each time the character

recharges her higher-order ability, she brings her

remaining uses of it up to this number.

THE BLEAK TOWER (EL 13)

Ages ago, a powerful lich created a swampy demiplane

in which to build her strongholda single obsidian

structure known as the Bleak Tower. Although the bog

seemed to surround the tower for miles in every direc-

tion, the plane was really only 1 mile in diameter. The

lich made the plane self-contained so that no one who

entered could move very far from her clutches.

For  centuries  the  lich  remained  in  her  tower,

researching new and innovative ways to turn dead

flesh into undead servants. Whenever she needed new

subjects for her experiments, she opened a portal from

her demiplane to some other place in the multiverse.

The creatures pulled into the swampy plane through

such portals were never seen againat least not in any

recognizable form.

No one knows what happened to the lich, but she

has not been seen or heard from in millennia. The

demiplanes boundaries have grown so weak that it

periodically breaches them, spilling into swampy

regions of other planes. When such a tear occurs, the

Bleak Tower beckons to all the undead in the region,

augmenting its own forces.

Location: A nameless demiplane.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Bleak Tower

Encounter Table below when the characters visit the

site for the first time, or for the first time in more than

a year.

Subsequent Encounters: Once the characters

clear out the area, the chance of an encounter is only

25% on each subsequent visit. If the PCs fail to visit the

location  for  more  than  a  year,  they  must  roll  for

encounters as if they had never visited the site.

Base Ability: You gain a +1 bonus on all Fortitude

saving throws.

Recharge Condition: Walk across the demi-

plane, beginning at the entrance to the Bleak Tower

and walking away in a straight line until you arrive at

the entrance again. Traversing the demiplane in this

manner is possible because it is self-contained. While

walking,  you  have  a  50%  chance  of  having  an

encounter, in addition to any encounters that may

occur as a result of your arrival on the demiplane.

Higher-Order Ability: Once per day, you may use

inflict serious wounds (caster level 10th) as a spell-like ability.

Undead Traits: A balor skeleton is immune to

mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis,

stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that

requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects

or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal

damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores,

ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and resurrec-

tion works only if it is willing.

Possessions: None.

THE CUSP OF THE TRYST (EL 14)

The 148th layer of the Abyss is a rocky, wind-blasted

plain named Torrent. Dark blue and green clouds roil

endlessly through the sky, and bolts of lightning strike

the ground incessantly. Only creatures made of light-

ningor those with immunity to its effectscan live

in this dismal place.

Any creature standing on the surface of Torrent will

eventually be struck by lightning. The inhabitants con-

sider such an event joyousa sensual joining between

the sky and the earth via the body of a fortunate inter-

mediary. Most visitors, however, have no such roman-

tic notions about several million volts of electricity

coursing through their bodies.

The tallest point on Torrent is a relatively small

mountain that the locals call the Cusp of the Tryst

because it is struck by lightning more frequently than

any other spot. Many of Torrents inhabitants consider

it a sacred place, and those who travel to it can enjoy

the kiss of the lightning more than ten times per hour.

Location: Torrent, the 148th layer of the Abyss.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Cusp of the

Tryst Encounter Table below when the characters visit

the site for the first time, or for the first time in more

than a year.

In addition, every 10 minutes that a group of characters

remains above ground on Torrent, one of them may

(25% chance) be struck by a natural lightning bolt. This

chance increases to 50% every 5 minutes for characters

standing atop the Cusp of the Tryst. Each of Torrents

lightning bolts deals 5d6 points of electricity damage

(Reflex DC 15 half).

Subsequent Encounters: Once the characters

clear out the area, the chance of an encounter is only

20% on each subsequent visit. If the PCs fail to visit the

location  for  more  than  a  year,  they  must  roll  for

encounters as if they had never visited the site. The

chance of a lightning strike does not change.

Base Ability: You gain electricity resistance 5.

Recharge Condition: Climb to the top of the

Cusp of the Tryst and stand there until lightning

strikes you. The lightning deals 5d6 points of electric-

ity damage (no save).

Higher- Order Ability: Once per day as a full-

round action, you can create an effect similar to that of

the lightning bolt spell, except that it deals 1d6 points of

electricity damage for every two character levels you

have achieved (maximum 10d6, Reflex DC 3 + your

character level).

Higher-Order Uses: 5.

THE SENTINEL GROVE (EL 9)

The towering oaks of the sentinel grove are massive

and ancient even by the standards of Arborea. Many

rise hundreds of feet into the air and have boles more

than 20 feet across. A thick bed of moss, fallen leaves,

and delicate ferns blankets the ground under these

trees, except where occasional gaps in the canopy let in

shafts of pure sunlight. Beds of gorgeous wildflowers

thrive in such locations, filling the air with their heady

perfume.

In the heart of this grove stands an ancient temple

ruined, yet still magnificent. Flowering vines twine

around its stately marble columns, and within the roof-

less sanctuary lies a pond filled with lilies. The remains

of friezes depicting epic battles between heroes and all

manner of terrible foes decorate the interior walls, but

no clues reveal the identity of the deity to whom the

temple was dedicated. Some say the building is simply

a monument to struggle, and that it was created as a

ruin to indicate the fleeting nature of glory.

Location: The first layer of Arborea.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Sentinel Grove

site for the first time, or for the first time in more than

a year.

Subsequent Encounters: Once the characters

50% on each subsequent visit. If the PCs fail to visit the

location  for  more  than  a  year,  they  must  roll  for

encounters as if they had never visited the site. The

creatures of the sentinel grove resent constant intru-

sions but are basically good-natured. They may consent

to give the characters access to the grove in return for

some service rather than simply fighting.

Base Ability: When standing upright on any natu-

ral terrain, you gain a +1 bonus on any opposed checks

you make to resist bull rush, trip or overrun attempts,

and on saving throws to resist being moved against

your will (by wind effects or telekinesis, for example).

Recharge Condition: You must climb to the top

of the tallest oak in the grove, harvest an acorn, and

plant it in fertile soil. The relative heights of the trees

may change from time to time because of irregularities

in growth and vagaries in the weather, so a fresh deter-

mination of the correct tree is necessary with each visit.

Higher- Order Ability: Once per day, you can

create a heroes feast effect, as the spell (caster level

equals your character level).

Higher-Order Uses: 2.

THE DEEPING POOL (EL 11)

The Deeping Pool is actually a small lake, perhaps a

quarter mile wide and several miles long. It lies hidden

within a broadleaf forest on Krigala, the realm of eter-

nal day. Though the sun shines perpetually overhead,

the forests thick canopy casts the whole area in a green

twilight gloomexcept for the exact center of the lake,

where shafts of golden light stream down and make the

waters sparkle like a field of precious diamonds. The

pools depth has never been precisely determined,

4

perhaps because its verdant surroundings are so lovely

that no one has ever bothered to do so, or perhaps

because it is bottomless indeed.

The Deeping Pool is the only sizable body water for

hundreds of miles in any direction. Thus, for inexperi-

enced travelers, the forest surrounding the pool is effec-

tively a cool, green desert. At any given hour, dozens or

even hundreds of animals visit the pool to slake their

thirst. Most of these visitors are harmless enough, but

some come here for more than a cool drink.

Location: The first layer of the Beastlands.

Initial Encounters: Roll on the Deeping Pool

Encounter Table below whenever the characters visit

the site for the first time, or for the first time in more

than a year.

Recharge Condition: Share a drink from the

pool with an animal. To do so, you must be adjacent to

an animal, and the two of you must drink from the pool

at the same time. For the purpose of recharging the

pools higher-order ability, an animal is any creature

with the animal type or the augmented animal subtype.

Characters with animal companions should find meet-

ing this condition fairly simple, but others must calm

or control the animal in some fashion.

Higher- Order Ability: Once per day, you can

assume one of the following animal traits for 1 minute

per character level. The duration of the ability need not

be consecutive minutes or rounds, and starting or sus-

pending the effect is a standard action for you. Choose

from the following traits each time you use the ability.

Subsequent Encounters: The Deeping Pool

serves as a watering hole for all manner of wildlife. PCs

who make an effort to clear the area of monsters find it

just as busy each time they visit. If they make a con-

certed effort to clear out the bigger predators in the

area, however, treat an encounter with dire animals or

giant crocodiles as no encounter during subsequent

visits. If the characters dont visit for a year or more, go

back to using the regular encounter table.

Base Ability: You gain a +2 bonus on all Handle

Animal checks and on Survival checks made to forage

for food and water.

Gain the low-light vision special quality.

Gain the scent special quality.

Increase your current natural armor bonus by +2.
