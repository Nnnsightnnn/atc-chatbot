Across  Faern,  the  name  Waterdeep  evokes

feelings of wonder, awe, and envy. Although it

is not the largest city in the Realms, the City

of Splendors is undoubtedly the most famous and most cosmo-

politan metropolis on the continent of Faern. Having grown

rich on a steady diet of trade and industry, this crossroads city

combines the best aspects of many cultures into a marvelous

shining jewel. Waterdeeps cultural patrimony is all of Faern,

and its inhabitants are much richer for it.

The City of Splendors lies in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep

on the shore of the best natural harbor along the Sword Coast.

Undermountain, the greatest dungeon in all Faern, lies beneath

the citys streets and sewers, and the untamed hinterlands of

the Sword Coast beckon to those daring enough to seek their

fortune.

Built on a plateau settled  rst by the elves of Illefarn and

later honeycombed by the shield dwarves of Clan Melairkyn, the

City of Splendors was founded by primitive Illuskan and Tethyr-

ian settlers and heavily in uenced by far-wandering Chondathan

merchants. Today, Waterdeep remains a predominantly human

city, although representatives of nearly every intelligent race

make their home within its walls.

Waterdeep is home to haughty nobles, diligent craftsmen,

scheming merchants, daring sailors, and bold adventurers of

every stripe. It has always been a center of wealth and in uence

where those who dream of power, riches, or artistic ful llment

can come to to realize their aspirations.

It is also a city of fearsome dungeons.

Undermountain  and  the  Dungeon  of  the  Crypt  promise

untold  riches  and  deadly  monsters  to  those  who  dare  their

depths. Skullport, the Port of Shadow, beckons to those who

seek  illicit  goods  and  dark  dearlings.  Ancient  feuds  divide

Waterdeeps guilds and noble houses, and many factions seek

to  topple  the  secretive  Lords  of  Waterdeep.  The  Arcane

Brotherhood of neighboring Luskan seeks to weaken its hated

rival to the south, while the Red Wizards of Thay hope to

dominate Waterdeeps markets. The churches of Selne and

Shar use the City of Splendors as a battle eld in their eternal

war,  while  countless  mercenary  groups  come  to  the  city  to

spend their hard-won earnings. The Shadow Thieves of Amn

plot to overthrow the Lords who once drove them out of the

city. Spies and mercenaries such as the Knights of the Shield

and the Kraken Society spread rumors and steal closely held

secrets, while agents of Skullports Iron Ring prowl for slaves

to abduct into the depths. All the while, the secretive Lords

of Waterdeep strive to preserve the citys tolerant spirit, wise

rule, and powerful magical tradition.

Although Waterdeep is younger than many cities

of the South, its history stretches back millen-

nia.  Humans  have  dwelt  along  the  shores  of

Deepwater Bay for at least two thousand years, in settlements

such as Sargauth, Blackcloak Hold, Bloodhand Hold, Nimoars

Hold, and Skullport, and their traditions, culture, and law form

the foundation of Waterdhavian culture and society.

In  the  current  age,  the  City  of  Splendors  serves  as  the

Gateway  to  the  North,  accessible  by  road,  ship,  Underdark

passage, or magic portal. Almost anything can be bought, sold,

or found in its thriving markets and long-forgotten dungeons.

Most adventurers worth their salt eventually make their way to

Waterdeep in search of excitement, danger, or great reward. The

trick is surviving and thriving in the grandest city of Faern.

Waterdeep (Metropolis, Magical): AL all; Spending limit

100,000  gp;  Assets  663,300,000  gp  (3,316,500,000  in

summer months); Population 132,661 within the city limits

(5 in summer months); Races mixed (humans 64%, shield

dwarves  10%,  elves  [mostly  moon  elves]  10%,  lightfoot

hal ings 5%, half-elves 5%, gnomes [all kinds] 3%, half-orcs

2%, others 1%).

Authority  Figures:  Piergeiron  Paladinson;  Khelben  Black-

staff Arunsun; Mirt the Moneylender; other Lords of Waterdeep

(see page 52).

Important Characters: Elaith the Serpent Craulnober (NE

male moon elf  ghter 3/wizard 9, crime lord detailed on page

numerous to list here).

Notable Imports: Grain, livestock, leather, ore, timber, and

exotic goods from all lands.

Notable Exports: Ale, arms, cloth, furnishings, leather goods,

pottery, re ned metals, and all other sorts of  nished goods.

History of Waterdeep

Deepwater Bay is the best harbor along the Sword Coast, and the

plateau in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep is a natural site on

which to build a city. Elves, dwarves, Netherese wizards, Illuskan

seafarers, and Tethyrian migrants have all laid claim to what is

now the city of Waterdeep at various points in time.

The following is a brief accounting of that history, detailing

the  major  settlements  that  have  existed  on  and  beneath  the

plateau of Waterdeep.

Aelinthaldaar (8500 to 1100 DR)

The  rst known settlement in the area was Aelinthaldaar, capital

city  of  Illefarn.  Founded  around  8500  DR,  Aelinthaldaar

was  razed  by  elven  high  magic  in  1100  DR  on  the  order

of Illefarns coronal when he initiated a retreat to Evermeet.

Virtually nothing was left to indicate that an elf city had stood

on the site for seven millennia.

In 1088 DR, scarcely a dozen years after the razing of

Aelinthaldaar, annual trade began between southern merchants

and barbaric local tribes. The only known traces of Aelinthaldaar

that still exist today are the crypts beneath the Pantheon Temple

of the Seldarine (C66) and a high magic effect that persists

even today (described in the next section).

Melairbode (1288 to 211 DR)

Even before the Fair Folk abandoned Aelinthaldaar, a shield

dwarf  named  Melair  discovered  a  vein  of  precious  mithral

beneath Mount Waterdeep in 1288 DR. King Melair I, as

he came to be known, sent word to his kindred, and those who

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

answered his call became Clan Melairkyn. The Melairkyn were

traders,  artisans,  and  explorers,  strongly  protective  of  their

home, which they named the Underhalls of Melairbode. They

slew  or  drove  off  Underdark  predators,  duergar  miners,  and

drow scouts in order to establish their realm.

As the Melairkyn extended the boundaries of their realm to

include the topmost levels of what is now Undermountain, the

leaders of Aelinthaldaar grew increasingly concerned. Eventu-

ally a deal was struck, in which the Melairkyn would provide

a great amount of mithral ore to the elves. In exchange, the

elves crafted a high magic effect that would prevent the plateau

from ever collapsing or settling, no matter what occurred in

the tunnels below. The plateau of Waterdeep still stands  rm

today, despite countless collapses in the caverns of Melairbode

in the intervening centuries.

Sargauth Enclave (750 to 339 DR)

In 750 DR, an order of powerful Netherese mages claimed

a  section  of  rock  amid  Melairbode  that  the  Stout  Folk  had

not yet begun to excavate. Some claim the Netherese sought

the protection of the lingering magics of Aelinthaldaar, while

others believe they deliberately placed themselves in the midst

of a rich dwarf kingdom so that the Stout Folk would serve

as a buffer against invaders. Be that as it may, the Sargauth

Enclave was hewn by Netherese spells and then sealed against

dwarf intrusions before the Melairkyn could even protest the

presence of these unwanted neighbors.

For  more  than  four  centuries,  the  Stout  Folk  and  the

Netherese arcanists lived side-by-side as unfriendly neighbors.

The  Netherese  experimented  on  and  expanded  the  mantle

magic of the elves, creating a great mantle akin to a mythal

to encompass their entire enclave. While just as committed to

magic, the people of this enclave embraced gods as well, unlike

other powerful Netherese mages. Their temples were incredible

constructs  of  magic  and  stone.  (See  pages  111112  of  Lost

Empires of Faern for more information on mantles.)

In the Year of Sundered Webs (339 DR), the temporary

collapse of the Weave that destroyed the  ying cities of Netheril

left the ceiling of the Sargauth Enclave temporarily without

magical support. More than two-thirds of the enclave collapsed,

leaving the area (the current Level Three of Undermountain)

in  ruins.  The  survivors  were  twisted  into  magically  potent

undead that survive to this day as the Skulls of Skullport (see

page 109).

Kyorlamshin (677 to 493 DR)

In  the  Year  of  Fervent  Glances  (677  DR),  drow  from  the

city of Karsoluthiyl (located beneath the Trackless Sea, west

of the mouth of the River Chionthar) began their  rst incur-

sions against the Stout Folk of Melairbode. After centuries of

inconclusive skirmishing, the drow mustered a huge army in

the Year of Purloined Power (34 DR) and swarmed up from

the depths, overwhelming the shield dwarves and slaying King

Melair IV, the last clan chief of the Melairkyn. The dwarves

were forced to retreat to successively lower and less important

levels of the Underhalls, until they  nally vanished in the Year

of Spoiled Splendors (211 DR).

The  drow  named  their  new  holdings  Kyorlamshin  and

claimed  most  of  fallen  Melairbode  as  their  demesne.  They

established  a  chain  of  portals  linking  Kyorlamshins  central

temple with Karsoluthiyl and began regular slaving runs between

the Northdark and the more southerly Realms Below.

Ruathym Diaspora (52 to 168 DR)

In the century leading up to the beginning of Dalereckoning,

the ancient kingdom of Ruathym was wracked by intertribal

strife,  which  in  turn  prompted  a  wave  of  emigration.  One

Ruathymite tribe, known as the Illuskans, settled at the mouth

of the River Delimbiyr, founding the city of Tavaray in the

Year of the Phandar (50 DR).

While the various Illuskan island settlements either dwindled

and died or grew into tiny kingdoms, the Illuskans of Tavaray

prospered and began expanding their holdings. From the mouth

of the River Delimbiyr, the Illuskan settlement spread upriver

and north along the coast. By the Year of the Thundering Horde

(52 DR), Illuskans were farming the plateau above Deepwater

Harbor, and for two and a half centuries their rule of the area

was uncontested.

Blackcloak Hold (168 to 482 DR)

In the Year of Scattered Stars (168 DR), a wizard of unknown

ancestry calling himself Halaster Blackcloak built a tower and

forti ed ramparts in the middle of the Deepwater Plateau, to

the north and west of the burgeoning farms along the harbor

shore. Halaster quickly convinced the local populace to leave

him and his apprentices, known as the Seven, alone, and then

retreated into his new stronghold.

Unbeknownst  to  the  local  populace,  Halaster  Blackcloak

had built the hold as a secure base from which to explore the

Underhalls of the Melairkyn and claim the delvings for himself.

Halasters Huntsheld at various times from 171 DR to 308

DRbrutally exterminated large pockets of drow and duergar,

driving them out of the Underhalls, as they had previously done

to the dwarves. Halaster ruled the Underhalls by the Year of the

Cascade (309 DR), and the drow, forced into the lowest levels

of the Underhalls, abandoned the former dwarfhome entirely

by the Year of the Ecstatic Priest (493 DR).

Meanwhile,  the  Seven  left  Halasters  Hold  in  the  Year

of  Sundered  Sails  (307  DR),  hoping  to  establish  their  own

holdings  in  the  depths.  The  tower  and  surface  holding  fell

into decay and ruin, and the tribes of Blackcloak Hold, as the

settlement had come to be known, quickly learned to avoid

this cursed enclosure.

In the Year of the Deep Bay (302 DR), the inhabitants of

Tavaray were forced to abandon their city by the rising waters

of the Lizard Marsh. This event marked the waning of Illuskan

in uence along the coast south of the Sword Mountains. Cut off

from the lower Delimbiyr Vale by the Ardeep Forest, Blackcloak

Hold entered a long period of decline, and its population frag-

mented into tribes split along what had once been clan lines.

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

Bloodhand Hold (482 to 882 DR)

In  the  Year  of  the  Blighted  Vine  (482  DR),  a  Tethyrian

warlord named Ulbaerag Bloodhand conquered the ever-feud-

ing, settled tribes of Blackcloak Hold. Within a generation,

Ulbaerag had united the tribes as one. The settlement served

as a small but important anchorage on the Sword Coast, visited

annually by ships seeking timber harvested by the inhabitants

of Bloodhand Hold.

The rising power of orc hordes in the North led to the Coun-

cil of Axe and Arrow in the Year of Trials Arcane (523 DR).

There, the humans of Delimbiyran, the dwarves of Dardath, the

elves of Ardeep Forest, the gnomes of Dolblunde, and displaced

hal ings from Mieritin collectively founded the Tri-Crowned

Kingdom of Phalorm. The aging Ulbaerag rejected an invitation

to join the Realm of Three Crowns. However, Ulbaerags son

and successor proved more pragmatic, forging a lasting peace

with the elves of the Ardeep Forest.

The Realm of Three Crowns lasted less than a century, falling

in the Year of the Lamias Kiss (615 DR) to waves of goblinoid

attacks. The  nal battles between Phalorm and the Horde of

the  Wastes  resulted  in  the  magical  inundation  of  Uthtower

(forming the Mere of Dead Men) and the overrunning of the

Sword Mountains by countless bands of orcs. Many warriors of

Bloodhand Hold died in the  ghting as well, but their sacri ce

ensured the safety of their home.

In the wake of the Fallen Kingdoms collapse, the humans of

Delimbiyran founded the human-ruled Kingdom of Man. For

 fty- ve years the armies of Delimbiyran waged an Endless

Battle  against  the  scattered  orc  tribes  of  the  Sword  Coast,

indirectly  shielding  the  folk  of  Bloodhand  Hold  from  their

depredations. Although Ulbaerags descendants retained their

nominal independence, Bloodhand Hold was considered by most

to be just an outlying village of the Kingdom of Man.

The death of Delimbiyrs heirless king in the Year of the

Tritons Horn (697 DR) plunged the Kingdom of Man into an

ill-timed civil war. Bloodhand Hold was one of the few small

states to survive the internecine con ict and the subsequent orc

assault. In the Year of the Splendid Stag (734 DR), a succession

of harvests wrecked by  erce summer storms drove Raulbaera

Bloodhand, a descendant of Ulbaerag, to lead a band of followers

inland in search of a more sheltered vale. The Maiden King

laid claim to the lands near present-day Amphail, establishing

a settlement there that she named Rowan Hold.

Nimoars Hold (882 to 932 DR)

Great changes swept the North in the Year of the Curse (882

DR).  The  fall  of  Ascalhorn,  Eaerlann,  and  Ammarindar  to

demons  prompted  a  great  migration  of  dwarves,  elves,  and

humans south and west toward the coast. Among the migrants

arose  a  great  human  warrior  known  as  Nimoar  the  Reaver.

Nimoar gathered an armed host and led them in search of a

new home.

As winter drew nigh, Nimoar and his followers came upon

Bloodhand Hold and decided to seize it for their own. They

quickly vanquished the Bloodhand tribe. Nimoar immediately

ordered  the  construction  of  a  log  palisade  atop  an  earthen

embankment and a wooden fortress at the northern end of

the settlement.

Nimoars defenses were seriously tested in the decade that

followed. In the Year of Fell Pearls (887 DR), southern pirates

attacked Nimoars Hold in force, but the Reavers followers beat

them back three times in a row. In the Year of the Shining

Shield (889 DR), driven from the lower Dessarin vale by the

same pressures that had prodded Nimoar and his followers, the

Tethyrian Bull Elk tribe attacked Nimoars Hold and set it a re.

However, once again the Reavers followers proved victorious,

driving off the barbarian raiders and rebuilding the hold before

the  rst winter snow.

From then onward, Nimoars Hold grew and prospered, and

the  edgling community became known among ship captains

as the town of Waterdeep.

Age of War Lords (932 to 1032 DR)

After some four decades of peace, two threats arose to challenge

Waterdeeps prosperityorcs and trolls. In the Year of the Red

Rain (927 DR), a shaman named Wund arose among the orc

tribes  of  the  Sword  Mountains.  On  the  eve  of  the  Feast  of

the Moon, as Wund had prophesied, blood red thunderclouds

engulfed the Sword Mountains. For three days the slopes ran

wet with blood, leaving behind the sickening stench of rot and

decay. All manner of plagues quickly swept through the region.

Many orcs (and other folk) died by the White Hand of Yutrus,

including every tribal chieftain, but the spawn of Gruumsh who

survived the crucible of plagues grew stronger.

In  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  Blood  Plagues,  Wund

established a monastic order known as the Brotherhood of the

Scarlet Scourge. Members of the order organized the surviving

orc tribes into a united realm under the spiritual guidance of

the brotherhood. The most powerful chieftain, a massive, fairly

unintelligent tusker named Uruth, was crowned king by Wund.

The  rst signs of Waterdeeps impending peril unfolded in

the  Year  of  Fireslaughter  (932  DR).  Gangs  of  trolls,  driven

out of the Sword Mountains by the orc tribes of the region,

began attacking Nimoars Hold with increasing regularity. In

response, the aging Nimoar led his forces northward against the

Everlasting Ones in what became known as the First Trollwar,

burning miles of land bare in the process.

In the Year of the Sky Raiders (936 DR), the armies of Uruth

Ukrypt swept down the eastern slopes of the Sword Mountains.

The armies of Waterdeep battled the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt in

a series of pitched battles known as the Orcfastings War. Early

orc victories in the Battle of Whirling Blades, the Battle of

Sarcrag, and the Battle of Withered Fields drove Waterdeeps

forces back to the gates of Nimoars Hold. However, a timely

feint by the Duke of Calandor enabled Nimoars forces to break

the orcs siege of the hold in the Battle of Burning Cliffs.

Over the next  ve days, Waterdeeps armies won four suc-

cessive battles, shattering the might of Uruth Ukrypts armies.

King Uruth fell in the Battle of the Westwood, but it was the

death of Wund that precipitated the Horderout.

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

In the aftermath of the Orcfastings War, Nimoar died of

old age, and the mantle of War Lord passed to Gharl, his

most accomplished general. The orcs of Uruth Ukrypt retreated

to their high steadings. Orc plans to attack Waterdeep in the

Year of Cold Claws (940 DR) faltered thanks to Palarandusk,

a great gold wyrm. This proved fortunate for the defenders of

Waterdeep, for once again the Everlasting Ones began raiding,

marking the beginning of the Second Trollwar.

For a dozen years, the defenders of Waterdeep battled gangs

of trolls throughout the Dessarin River valley. Beginning with

Amphail the Just, who reigned for a year, six warriors claimed

the mantle of War Lord of Waterdeep during this period, only

to fall in never-ending battle with the trolls.

In the Year of the Rings Royal (952 DR), the human realms

and holdings of the North united and  nally ended the war,

destroying or scattering the hordes of Everlasting Ones. Two

heroes of that war were Ahghairon, thereafter recognized as the

premier wizard of the Savage North, and Samular Caradoon,

a Tyrran knight who attracted a large following to his banner.

In the aftermath of the war, Ahghairon was elevated to the

position of of cial advisor of the War Lord of Waterdeep,

and Samular went on to form the Holy Order of Samular, a

knighthood still active in Waterdeep to this day.

After  ghting and winning three wars in the span of two

decades, the city of Waterdeep emerged as a preeminent power

in the North. Construction of Castle Waterdeep began in the

Year of the Deadly Duo (963 DR), just north of the city walls.

Over the next decade, the citys walls were expanded to abut

the  wall  around  the  ruins  of  Halasters  Hold  and  replaced

with high stone forti cations. In the Year of the Haunting

Harpy (974 DR), the castle was  nally completed and Laroun,

Waterdeeps  rst female War Lord, took residence therein.

Laroun ruled long and well, seeing to Waterdeeps continued

prosperity and defense. By the Year of the Bold Barbarian (1007

DR), the city walls had been expanded once again, absorbing

the ruins of Halasters Hold, cloaked in wards by Ahghairon.

Waterdeeps master mage also built his tower in this year, at

the time outside the citys walls. In the Year of Three Signs

(1010  DR),  Laroun  of cially  established  the  Free  City  of

Waterdeep, with herself as Warlord (or ruler).

In the Year of Lathanders Light (1024 DR), a daring

band of Waterdhavian adventurers known as the Dawnbringer

Company incited the orcs of Uruth Ukrypt by plundering

their  sacred  crypt,  known  as  the  Ukrypt.  Discovered  in

the act, the band  ed the wrath of the Scarlet Scourge. In

response, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered

the  rst orc horde in generations to emerge from the Sword

Mountains. Bent on destroying the City of Splendors, the

Broken Bone horde instead fell prey to Lhammaruntosz, the

Claws of the Coast.

Enraged by its defeat, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge

plotted revenge against the city of Waterdeep. In the Year of

Crimson Magics (1026 DR), the Brotherhood mustered another

orc horde from the depths of the Sword Mountains. The Black

Claw horde encircled the plateau on which the city lay and then

repeatedly assaulted the City of Splendors. Warlord Laroun died

defending Waterdeep during one of the desperate battles to hold

the citys walls.

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

Larouns title passed to Raurlor, leader of the citys army,

despite the reservations of Ahghairon. The Black Claw horde

would have undoubtedly overrun the City of Splendors if not

for the daring of an elite company of veterans who traveled

through Halasters Underhalls, beyond the city walls, and then

fell on the orc encampment from the rear. The defeats of two

successive hordes shattered both the kingdom of Uruth Ukrypt

and the order that sustained it. The orcs of the Sword Mountains

disintegrated into warring tribes.

In  the  Year  of  Warlords  (1030  DR),  Raurlor  began  to

increase Waterdeeps standing army and navy to a size not seen

since the fall of Phalorm. Over the next two years, he turned

the city into a garrison and military encampment, brooking

no dissent from the populace. In the Year of the Nightmaidens

(1032 DR), Raurlor proclaimed the Empire of the North, but

Ahghairon de ed him, transforming the Warlords blade into a

viper that poisoned its wielder; Raurlor died at the mages feet,

and Ahghairon took power.

Age of Ahghairon (1032 to 1256 DR)

As the  rst Lord of Waterdeep, Ahghairon determined that

henceforth  wisdom  and  not  armed  might  would  rule  in  the

city. He assembled a group of Lords drawn from all walks of

life, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people,

but equal to him in authority. In the years that followed, Wa-

terdeep prospered, growing in both size and economic might.

The System of Wards came into being in the Year of Falling

Stars (1035 DR), initially including Castle Ward, Trades Ward,

Temple (later Southern) Ward, and Dock Ward.

The Year of Lions Roars (1071 DR) saw the noted adven-

turer Ranressa Shiard return to the slopes of Mount Waterdeep

on  dragonback,  astride  a  copper  wyrm  named  Galadaeros,

prompting  Ahghairon  to  create  wards  deterring  (but  not

completely preventing) dragons from raiding the city. In the

winter of the Year of the De ant Salute (1076 DR), Waterdeep

was attacked by the Tethyrian Black Boar tribe of the Dessarin,

led by Nalethra of the Winged Spear. Repelled from the citys

walls, the princess and her bodyguard slew thrice their number

of Waterdhavian  ghters before they fell.

A great plague swept the Sword Coast in the Year of the

Scourge (1150 DR), coupled with increased attacks by troll and

orc tribes. Large numbers of Waterdhavians died from these

twin scourges, thanks in part to the treachery of a secret cult

of Talona, quickly destroyed by agents of the Lords. The same

year  saw  the  arrival  of  Khelben  Blackstaff  Arunsun  the

Elder, who built Arunsun (later Blackstaff) Tower for himself

and his apprentices.

In the Year of the Black Horde (1235 DR), Waterdeep and

much of the Sword Coast was besieged by the largest orc horde

in history. The city was spared the destruction visited on its

neighbors when Ahghairon and his generals introduced griffons

as  ying steeds for the army. The Year of Burning Steel (1246

DR) saw Kerrigan, a wizard and hidden Lord of Waterdeep,

attempt to seize power for himself. He managed to fell three

of his fellow Lords and a score of innocents before being slain

by Ahghairon.

Skullport (1148 DR to present)

In the Year of the Angry Sea (1148 DR), a Netherese wizard

named Shradin Mulophor discovered the ruins of the Sargauth

Enclave and petitioned the Lord of the Underhalls for permis-

sion to settle and use the ruin- lled chamber as his personal

demesne. The Lord of Bones, as Shradin came to be known,

encouraged trade with other Underdark powers by linking the

River Sargauth with subterranean waterways and creating portals

leading to distant seas.

Fear of the necromancers magical powers, combined with the

mysterious Skulls that lent Skullport its name, fostered peaceful

trading within the ports environs. Within twenty- ve years of

its rediscovery, Skullport had grown into a secure settlement,

and smugglers, slavers, assassins, thieves, and buccaneers  ocked

to the Port of Shadow to conduct their business.

Ever since, Skullport has  ourished beneath Waterdeep in

large part due to the tolerance of the citys Lords. Most of the

citys rulers are or have been realistic enough to admit that dark

deeds occur in every large city and that by giving them an outlet

in the Port of Shadow they are reducing the incidence of such

activities in the City of Splendors. Shradin himself continued

to explore the Underhalls, but after once such expedition in

the Year of the Howling Hourglass (1184 DR), he returned to

Skullport a changed man, unstable and unpredictable. Although

he retained the mantle of Lord of Bones, he no longer com-

manded the fear and respect he once had. During Halasters

Higharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), the Skulls

of Skullport ganged up and destroyed him. Although a lesser

clone of the necromancer eventually reappeared, the Skulls have

ruled the Port of Shadow ever since.

Reign of Guildmasters

(1256 to 1273 DR)

In the Year of the Dusty Throne (1256 DR), shortly after Khel-

ben vanished from the City of Splendors, the aged Ahghairon

passed away and was interred with great ceremony in his tower,

which was then sealed with potent wards that remain in effect

to  this  very  day.  Ahghairons  fellow  Lords  were  nowhere  to

be found, as all but two had been quietly slain in the wake of

Ahghairons death, leaving the masters of Waterdeeps various

guilds (who had secretly discovered the identities of the hidden

Lords and had them killed) to argue over who should rule.

While the council bickered, deadly strife erupted in the citys

shadows. The Guild Wars pitted armies of hired mercenaries

and assassins against one another, wiping out many merchant

families. After two months, it was agreed that the Council of

Guildmasters  would  collectively  rule  the  City  of  Splendors,

although most of the feuds spawned during this era have never

been forgotten.

In  the  Year  of  the  Black  Wind  (1262  DR),  six  years  of

self-interested squabbling among the Guildmasters erupted into

bloodshed. All but two of the citys Guildmasters died in the next

few months. The surviving Guildmasters, Lhorar Gildeggh of

the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters,  nally

sickened of the bloodshed and agreed to rule together as Lords

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

Magister,  although  their  continued  bickering  prevented  any

effective governance of the city.

In the same year the Lords Magister began their rule, the

Shadow Thieves, up till then a minor band of thieves openly

tolerated  as  a  recognized  guild,  discovered  a  long-forgotten

stronghold  in  the  depths  of  Mount  Waterdeep  built  by  the

dwarves of Melairbode and used as a defensive retreat during

the era of Bloodhand Hold. Calling their new stronghold the

Citadel of the Bloody Hand, the Shadow Thieves quickly grew

in  strength  and  in uence,  free  to   ourish  in  the  climate  of

lawlessness that prevailed.

The reign of the Guildmasters came to an abrupt end in the

Year of the Wagon (1273 DR), when the last two of Ahghairons

Lords  appeared  in  the  court  of  the  Lords  Magister.  Lady

Shilarn, apprentice and undeclared heir of Ahghairon, blasted

Lhorar  and  Ehlemm  with  lightning  and   re.  Lord  Baeron

Silmaeril removed his mask and declared himself Open Lord

of Waterdeep.

Reign of Baeron (1273 to 1308 DR)

The revival of the Lords Rule saw a gradual return to peace

and prosperity in the City of Splendors, although many worked

in secret to oppose Baeron Silmaeril and the masked Shilarn

Silmaeril as they reestablished their authority. Among their  rst

acts, Shilarn declared Houses Gildeggh and Zoar to be outcast,

while Baeron established the black-robed Magisters to maintain

justice and outlawed the Shadow Thieves from the city.

Within three years of their installation, the wedded Lords

Silmaeril had chosen fourteen additional individuals to serve as

hidden Lords of Waterdeep, although only  ve to seven were

ever seen at once. In the Year of the Crumbling Keep (1276

DR), the Lords expanded the citys borders to include North

Ward  and  Sea  Ward,  and  Shilarn  gave  birth  to  a  daughter

named Lhestyn.

In  the  guise  of  the  Masked  Lady,  Lhestyn  in ltrated

the outlawed Shadow Thieves in the Year of the Pointed Bone

(1298  DR)  and  exposed  their  continuing  activities.  This  act

precipitated  a  bloody  tenday  of   ghting  between  the  guild

and the City Watch that culminated in the death or  ight of

the  guilds  members.  Two  years  later,  Lhestyn  wed  Zelphar

Arunsun, a Neverwintan wizard and youngest son of Khelben

the Elder, and two years after that (1302 DR) she gave birth

to Khelben Ravenscloak Arunsun the Younger, a near twin

of his grandfather and namesake.

In the same year that saw the birth of Lhestyns only child,

two noted adventurers, Durnan and Mirt the Merciless, emerged

from  Undermountain  bearing  great  wealth,  precipitating  a

renewal of interest in the vast dungeon beneath the City of

Splendors. The practice of exiling criminals to the depths of

Undermountain dates back to this year, although some have

begun to question its effectiveness, as it seems to ensure that

only the most dangerous predators of the city survive, often

strengthened by the crucible of Halasters Halls.

Baeron died of fever in the Year of the Catacombs (1308

DR), and Shilarn, his wife, immolated herself on his funeral

pyre. Their daughter, Lhestyn, a hidden Lord of Waterdeep

herself, became the citys Open Lord.

Reign of Lhestyn (1308 to 1314 DR)

Lhestyns  short  reign  as  Open  Lord  of  Waterdeep  began  in

splendor but was marked by personal tragedy. In the Year of

the Catacombs (1308 DR), Lhestyn constructed the Palace of

Waterdeep on the site of a ruined abbey of Chauntea. In the

Year of the Fist (1311 DR), her husband Zelphar was crushed

to death by a sorcerous hand of force. The perpetrator remains

unknown to the Lords to this day (in truth, he was murdered by

a lich of the Twisted Rune as a favor to the Shadow Thieves).

Zelphars death prompted Durnan, himself a hidden Lord,

to found the Red Sashes as his personal agents, creating a pre-

caution against blatant disregard for the watch that had grown

increasingly common in Dock Ward. Khelben the Elder secretly

returned to Arunsun Tower after the death of his son, phasing

out and eventually faking the death of his guise as Ducat

Eattel by the following year. Over the next ten years, he trained

his grandson and namesake, as it gradually became known that

Khelben the Younger now claimed his grandfathers tower.

Lhestyn died in the Year of the Shadowtop (1314 DR), only

a few short years after her parents and husband. Piergeiron Pala-

dinson, a paladin and of cer of the city guard whom Lhestyn

had made a hidden Lord three years earlier, became Open Lord

of Waterdeep. Khelben the Younger departed Waterdeep in the

Year of Chains (1321 DR), leaving his grandfather to assume

his guise.

Reign of Piergeiron

(1314 DR to Present)

Since ascending to the position of Open Lord of Waterdeep,

Piergeiron Paladinson has reigned wisely and honestly. In his  rst

four decades, Waterdeep knew peace, with only one exception.

The Year of the Saddle (1345 DR) saw religious strife between

the  church  of  Shar  and  the  churches  of  Lathander,  Selne,

and Tempus. This con ict resulted in the  ery destruction of

two of the citys templesthe Spires of the Morning and the

House  of  Heroesduring  the  Night  of  Temple  Fires  and

the sacking of a thirda hidden temple of the Dark Maiden

beneath what is now Shadows Alley.

The era of peace ended in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR),

when Amril Zoar, scion of the exiled Waterdhavian family of

the  same  name,  slew  two  secret  Lords  of  Waterdeep,  Lady

Tamaeril Bladesemmer and Resengar the Whitebeard, and badly

wounded Open Lord Piergeiron. After being apprehended, he

was spared execution by the intercession of Storm Silverhand

of the Harpers.

In the  rst days of the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), a Water-

dhavian troop patrolling the trade routes came under attack by

devils and goblins in the Open Marches. The devils were tracked

back to Dragonspear Castle, where Waterdeeps forces besieged

and set  re to the ancient keep. The Dragonspear War contin-

ued for months, as the numbers of devils continued to grow.

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

Eventually,

the armies of

Waterdeep  and  Baldurs  Gate

prevailed, and the devils were defeated.

On the heels of the Dragonspear War, Ruathym attacked

and sank a Luskanite caravel after persons unknown (at the

time) stole the Tome of the Unicorn from the Green Library.

Luskan responded by destroying much of Ruathyms  eet and

invading the island itself. After months of  ghting, Ruathyms

defenders  drove  the  High  Captains  of  Luskan  back  to  their

ships.  Waterdeep  negotiated  a  truce  between  the  two  parties

early  the  following  year,  but  that  back red  when  Luskan,

Ruathym, Tuern, and the Whalebones forged an alliance to raid

settlements along the Sword Coast. Not until the Year of the

Serpent (1359 DR) did the navies of Waterdeep and Baldurs

Gate end this threat to merchant shipping.

The Time of Troubles beset Toril in the Year of Shadows

(1358  DR).  First,  Shar  appeared  in  the  guise  of  Selne,  at-

tempting to permanently weaken her ancient adversary. Then,

near the end of the Avatar Crisis, Myrkuls Legion and the

avatar of the Lord of Bones invaded the City of Splendors,

wreaking  great  destruction  throughout  Dock  Ward,  Castle

Ward,  and  Southern  Ward.  Many  buildings  in  the  Market

were destroyed when Myrkuls avatar was defeated, Midnight

(Mystra) and Cyric ascended to godhood from the slopes of

Mount Waterdeep, and the voice of Ao the Overgod was heard

by many in the Market.

The years that followed were no less tumultuous for Pier-

geiron and the Waterdhavian populace. Rumors of a Harper

assassin swept Waterdeep in the Year of Maidens (1361 DR),

as did whispers of a new land to the distant west discovered by

explorers from Amn. Along with the rest of the Lords Alliance,

Waterdeep was also forced to threaten war when Luskan once

again turned on Ruathym and conquered its brothers to the

west. In the Year of the Wave (1364 DR), droughts, increased

monster activity, and political unrest plagued Waterdeep for

12

months leading up to Midsummer, culminating in the disrup-

tion of Shieldmeet by a green dragon (Grimnoshtadrano, the

Riddling Dragon of the High Forest) and an apparently mad

bard (an ex-Harper named Iriador Garnet Wintermist), nearly

upsetting the Lords Rule.

In  the  Year  of  the  Shield  (1367  DR),  Khelben  Black-

staff  Arunsun  unmasked  himself  and  resigned  as  a  Lord

of Waterdeep, to the surprise of the populace and his fellow

Lords. Autumn of the Year of the Banner (1368 DR) saw

the cream of Waterdhavian youth enlist in Prince Haedraks

Reclamation  Army  to  restore  Tethyrs  monarchy.  At  the

same time, a fad for dream spheres secretly created by the

Mhaorkiira Hadryad swept the City of Splendors, appeal-

ing to the increasing ranks of those who dreamt of a better

life but despaired of ever achieving it. Complications from

the latter episode resulted in the deaths or disappearance of

several  nobles  and  nearly  rent  asunder  the  seven  families

of the Two-Cities Consortium who secretly controlled trade

between Waterdeep and Skullport.

Two events stood out in the Year of the Gauntlet (1369

DR). First, on the last day of Ches, an army of sea creatures

led  by  the  monstrous  wereshark  named  Iakhovas  invaded

the  City  of  Splendors  from  the  depths  of  the  harbor  and

surrounding sea. Waterdeeps defenders won the Deepwater

War, but at the cost of many lives and much destruction in

Dock Ward and Sea Ward. Moreover, some number of sea

creatures escaped into Waterdeeps sewers and lurk there still.

Second, Halasters Higharvestide disrupted the Mad Mages

wards  and  released  all  manner  of  monsters  into  the  citys

streets through malfunctioning portals across the city, causing

a great deal of property damage, particularly in Castle Ward

and Trades Ward.

Waterdeeps armies were drawn into war once again in the

Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), after the phaerimms escaped

the  Sharnwall  and  attacked  Evereska.  Khelben  Arunsun  led

one army that became trapped within the Vale of Evereska,

so Laeral and Storm Silverhand led a relief army against the

thornbacks  and  their  minions,  battling  armies  of  bugbears

and lizardfolk thralls led by beholder and illithid generals. An

uneasy alliance with the Shadovar of Shade fell apart, and it

soon became clear that the Netherese shades were melting the

High Ice of Anauroch, with no thought as to the consequences

for the rest of Toril. After months of war, the phaerimms were

defeated and the plans of the Shadovar were disrupted by the

theft of the Karsestone. Nevertheless, western Faern continues

to be beset by drought, threatening the prosperity of the City

of Splendors and its allies for years to come.

What the Future Holds

Since the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Waterdeep has been

invaded  by  two  armies  (Myrkuls  Legion  and  the  Army  of

Iakhovas), fought three wars beyond its walls, and had magi-

cally induced climatological changes devastate its agricultural

environs twice. At the same time, Waterdeeps trusted leaders

have  grown  old  or  turned  to  other  projects.  Folk  such  as

Durnan, Mirt, and Piergeiron are now far beyond their hale

and hearty youth, and Khelben is focused on personal projects

such as the Tel Teukiira.

With its treasuries nearly drained, its populace exhausted, and

severe droughts still ravaging the North, the City of Splendors

has acquired a dark patina of despair and penury unseen since

the misrule of the Guildmasters. Undoubtedly Waterdeep will

rise  again,   lling  its  coffers  with  trade  wealth  and  proudly

serving as the Gateway to the North, but for now at least, the

City of (faded) Splendors is greatly in need of adventurers to

restore its glory once again.

Whos Who in

Waterdeep

The City of Splendors is home to over one hundred thousand

citizens,  growing  to   ve  times  that  number  in  the  summer

months. Among the citys vast numbers, a handful of individuals

have achieved particular prominence.

Piergeiron the Paladinson, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, and

twenty hidden Lords of Waterdeep rule the City of Splendors.

Notable  Lords  include  Brian  the  Swordmaster,  Durnan  the

Wanderer,  Kitten  Nymara  Scheiron,  Larissa  Neathal,  and

Mirt the Moneylender. The City Guard, the City Watch (led

by Captain Rulathon), and the Gray Hands (led by the ranger

Jardwim) enforce the rule of the Lords.

The in uential merchant nobility controls much of the

citys  wealth  and  wields  a  great  deal  of  power  behind  the

scenes. Most common merchants and craftsmen are members

of  one  of  the  citys  guilds.  Prominent  guilds  include  the

Council  of  Musicians,  Instrument-Makers,  Choristers,  the

Order  of  Master  Shipwrights,  and  the  Watchful  Order  of

Magists & Protectors.

Although religion does not play a major role in Waterdeeps

culture or (aside from the Church of Tyr) government, most

known faiths are represented by at least a handful of worshipers

within the citys walls. The major acknowledged faiths include

the  Churches  of  Gond,  Lathander,  Mystra,  Oghma,  Selne,

Siamorphe, Sune, Tempus, Tymora, and Tyr. The churches of

Loviatar and Shar and cults of Ghaunadaur and Ibrandul also

play prominent roles from the shadows.

Many powerful arcane spellcasters have settled in Water-

deep,  drawn  by  the  combination  of  resources  and  freedom

found  in  the  City  of  Splendors.  Noted  archmages  include

Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun, Laeral Silverhand Arunsun,

Halaster  Blackcloak,  Kappiyan  Flurmastyr,  Tessalar  Huli-

corm, Muiral, Maaril, Marune, Savengriff, and Trobriand

the Metal Mage. Famed bards include Danilo Thann and

the Masked Minstrel.

Waterdeeps wealth has also attracted a host of black-hearted

rogues, including lone agents such as Alauneth Black Viper

Orrane, Elaith Craulnober, and Zabbas Thuul, and guilds such

as the Shadow Thieves and the Xanathar Thieves Guild. Spy

guilds such as the Knights of the Shield and the Kraken Society

 ourish here as well, as do various bands of predatory monsters,

including the beholders of the Graypeaks Hive, the Savants of

the Dark Tide, and the Unseen.

Culture and Society

As Gateway to the North, cosmopolitan Waterdeep is home to

all manner of individuals, some of them native to the city and

some of them hailing from distant lands. Humans make up

the bulk (64%) of the populace, but representatives of nearly

every race or ethnic group native to Faern dwell within the

city walls. Elves (predominantly moon elves) and shield dwarves

make up 10% each of the population, while lightfoot hal ings

and half-elves makes up 5% each of the population. Gnomes, at

3%, and half-orcs, at 2%, are the remaining racial minorities

found in sizable numbers.

Waterdhavian culture and society derives most strongly from

Chondathan, Illuskan, and Tethyrian in uences. (The ethnic

make-up of Waterdeeps human population is Tethyrian [51%],

Illuskan [23%], Chondathan [22%], Calishite [2%], other [2%].)

Waterdeeps maritime heritage can be traced back to the Illuskan

sailors who  rst anchored on the shores of Deepwater Bay. The

citys tolerance and egalitarianism is the legacy of Tethyrian

settlers whose forebears have always rebelled against empires

and  domination.  Chondathan  merchants  imparted  a  strong

mercantile streak into the citys culture in recent centuries and

left a legacy of Chondathan as the primary tongue.

Waterdhavians  tend  to  be  talkative,  friendly,  easygoing,

and  outspoken.  Most  are  slow  to  take  offense  or  fright  and

are relatively worldly compared to their counterparts in less

cosmopolitan cities. Lecherous and drunken behavior is usu-

ally tolerated but considered unusual. Small talk often centers

on  matters  of  commerce  and  warfare  elsewhere  in  Faern.

THE CITY OF SPLENDORS

Waterdhavians  are  generally  proud  of  their  history  but  not

dismissive of other realms. With important exceptions, they

dream of wealth and individual aggrandizement, but eschew

thoughts of empire and conquest.

In keeping with the tolerance shown to outsiders, all forms

of dress and appearance are seen on the streets of Waterdeep,

though  impersonating  a  Lord  of  Waterdeep,  a  black-robed

Magister, or of cers or members of the city guard or watch is

forbidden. Guild livery is reserved for guild members, but only

worn on of cial business, holidays, extra-city business ventures,

and during guild meetings. Coats of arms can only be worn by

those so entitled; nobles rarely display them except in signet

rings, belt buckles, or pendants, but their servants wear clothes

emblazoned with their masters coats-of-arms. For women dress-

ing in high fashion, glittering, diaphanous gowns of silk and

sequins accompanied by glittering jewelry are much in favor,

as are furs and  ligreed stomachers in exquisite designs.

Laws and Punishment

Legal authority in the City of Splendors rests within the Open

Lord and the hidden Lords of Waterdeep. The Lords Court

is chaired by Piergeiron, and is attended by at least two other

Lords and two Magisters. The Lords Court hears all severe

crimes, including suspicious deaths, rape, misuse of magic, and

succession and inheritance disputes.

Twenty-six  appointed  black-robed  Magisters  conduct

the  Common  Courts  of  Waterdeep.  Three  Black  Robes

are  always  on  duty  at  the  Palace.  During  daylight  hours,

a  Magister  is  also  posted  at  each  gate.  Magisters  can  pass

sentence  instantly,  but  most  sentences  are  conditional  on

the supporting evidence of witnesses. Magisters are always

accompanied by at least six members of the city guard. Any

citizen of Waterdeep can appeal to the Lords Court within

two days of being sentenced by a Magister, but most such

appeals  fail.  There  is  no  bail  in  Waterdeep,  and  barristers

are barred from working in the city (although counsel from

professional witnesses is grudgingly tolerated).

Waterdhavians are largely law-abiding, and most of Water-

deeps laws remain unwritten, within the reasonable discretion

of the Magisters (and thus the Lords who oversee them). The

Code Legal serves as a basis for sentencing, dividing all crimes

into four Plaints and each Plaint into severe, serious, lesser, and

minor offenses.

The  rst Plaint involves Crimes Against the Lords (treason,

impersonation, forgery of of cial documents, destruction of city

property, assault, willful disobedience of edicts, and blasphemy

against  a  government  of cial).  The  second  Plaint  involves

Crimes Against the City (poisoning of wells, murder, spying,

sabotage,  fraud,  fencing,  unlawful  dueling,  bribery,  unlawful

entry into the city, vagrancy, littering, brandishing a weapon

without cause, and reckless driving). The third Plaint involves

Crimes  Against  the  Gods  (de ling  of  a  holy  place,  theft  of

temple goods, tomb-robbing, assault on a religious person, public

blasphemy of a god or priesthood, and disorderly conduct at

worship). The fourth Plaint involves Crimes Against Citizens

(arson,  rape,  bodily  harm,  magical  assault,  forgery,  slavery,

robbery,  burglary,  theft/killing  of  livestock,  usury,  property

damage, assault, hindrance of business, and excessive noise).

Slavery  is  illegal  within  the  city,  and  slaves  brought  into

the city are considered free. Selling slaves within the wall is

forbidden and strictly policed. Weapons can be worn openly and

used in self-defense, but brandishing weapons in other situations

is a crime. Waterdhavians also expect debts to be paid in full,

even if that means the debtor must serve a form of indentured

servitude to the creditor (in the case of small debts) or the city

(in the case of large debts).

Duels (for reasons of speci c, unprovoked injury) are legal

only in speci c places, but must be marshaled by a member

of  the  Watch  or  a  Magister.  Lords,  Magisters,  guard  and

watch members, and Heralds are exempt from challenges, and

the Lords forbid most duels involving heads of guilds, noble

houses, or priesthoods. Most importantly, duels are rarely to

the death.

Sentences  for  lawbreaking  include  instant  death,  death

upon conviction, exile, mutilation, hard labor, imprisonment

(dungeon), imprisonment (light work in castle compound),  ne

(payable to city), or damages (payable to injured party). Perjury,

adjudicated by magic, is punished by expulsion from the city.

Death sentences vary by stationcommoners and soldiers are

Read All About It

Only  the  most  wealthy  and  powerful  Waterdhavians  can

afford large private libraries of bound tomes. Though the

majority of citizens can read, and they do so often both for

pleasure and to feel on top of Mount Waterdeep (which

means commanding a view of current events, politics, trade

activity, and near-future business opportunities), most citi-

zens only own a few well-worn chapbooks, some traditional

long  scrolls,  and  a  large  selection  of  the  short  scrolls

commonly known as broadsheets (typically 1 cp on the street

or in specialty shops).

Broadsheets are short, written newssheets that specialize

in  tabloid-style  news,  filled  with  political  rants,  sly  social

comments,  jokes,  and  serialized  adventures  (often  bawdy

or  pranksome)  and  are  usually  available  for  sale  on  the

streets and in specialized shops. Chapbooks are apt to contain

anything from poetry to furious arguments against guilds,

governing policy, or methods of tiling roofs. However, chap-

books are most often devoted to memoirs and to romantic

tales of either the tearful (for goodwives) or bawdy (for jacks

old  and  young)  variety.  Long  scrolls  tend  to  have  writing

on one side only, and they are the form of choice for setting

down religious texts, accounts that are maintained over time

(large ledgers are favored for official coinkeeping, however),

and spells that will be cast directly from the writing.

hung from the Castle battlements, while nobles are beheaded

by the sword. Floggings are typically carried out at the Court

of the White Bull. Death sentences are sometimes commuted

to exile into Undermountain, although this often winds up with

the same result.

Festivals and Holy Days

As Waterdeep is home to all manner of churches, cults, sects,

nationalities, and racial groups, almost every calendar day is

celebrated by one group or another, and not a tenday goes by

without some local festival in one of the smaller neighborhoods

of the city. The City of Splendors has long been tolerant of all

such activities, so long as they do not violate the law or interfere

with the  ow of commerce. Waterdhavians became blas about

such public displays long ago, and most celebrations draw little

more than a casual glance or a curse of annoyance when they

momentarily get in the way. Nevertheless, in addition to the

standard festivals of the Calendar of Harptos (see page 77 of

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting), there are several

other noteworthy festivals and holidays observed in the City

of Splendors.

Ahghairons Day: Celebrated on the  rst day of Eleasis, in

honor of the Old Mages birthday, this holiday does not affect

the citys operation (aside from closing the Lords Court). It is

honored in small ways, with many toasts to the Lords of the

city in tavern talk, bards performing songs in honor of the

much-loved Old Mage, and the leaving of violets at the base of

Ahghairons Tower (C79), the Plinth (T38), or atop the altars

of the House of Wonder ($21). The Open Lord often visits

taverns and inns throughout the city to wish the people well,

a practice continued by Piergeiron over the years, despite two

assassination attempts during such visits.

Aurils Blesstide: Serving more to ward off the Frostmaiden

than as a true celebration, this holy day is observed on the

day of winters  rst frost. Nearly everyone in the city wears

white clothes, no one eats or serves hot meals, and vendors

are  largely  absent  from  the  streets.  In  the  past  century,  a

disrespectful lark by some unclothed and besotted young nobles

has become a traditional part of the Aurils Day ceremonies;

as such, a parade of white-cloaked (but otherwise naked) men

and women runs from Cliffwatch in North Ward across the

city, through the West Gate, and out onto the westernmost

beaches. From there, the participants leap into the icy waters

of the Sea of Swords, thus sacri cing their warmth to the

Cold Goddess.

Fleetswake: Spanning the last tenday in Ches, this mariners

festival celebrates the sea, the sea trades, and the gods of the sea.

Events are concentrated primarily in Dock Ward, although the

Fiery Flagon ($37) in Sea Ward sees a great deal of activity as

well. Notable events include boat races (involving both private

boats and the navys rakers), the annual Shipwrights Ball at

the  Shipwrights  House  (D19),  and  guild-sponsored  galas  at

the Copper Cup festhall (D54). Any ship entering the harbor

during  Fleetswake  is  charged  1  gp  per  day  (rather  than  the

standard docking fee), which is added to the Fair Seas tribute

to Umberlee.

Lliiras  Night:  Celebrated  on  the  7th  of  Flamerule,  this

nightlong festival honors the Lady of Joy with dances and balls

held throughout the city. The Cynosure Ball is the highlight

of the night, sponsored jointly by the Lords, the local clergy

of Lliira, and various noble families. Many festhalls become

centers of wild carefree dancing and other pursuits under the

Ladys purview.

Visiting Waterdeep

Adventurers  from  all  over  Faern  come  to  Waterdeep  in

search of wealth, knowledge, trade, and adventure. The City

of Splendors lies on the western coast of Faern, just north of

the mouth of the River Dessarin. It can be reached by air, by

sea, overland, through the caverns of the Northdark, by spell,

or by portal.

Roads and Trade Routes

Four major overland trade routes connect the City of Splendors

to the rest of Faernthe High Road, the Long Road, the

Trade Way, and the East Trail. A  fth road, the Coast Way,

leads north along the coast from the Troll Gate until it joins

with the High Road several miles north of the city.

The High Road enters Waterdeep through the Northgate at

the northern end of Sea Ward and continues through the city

until it becomes the Trade Way upon exiting the South Gate.

The High Road leads north along the coast, threading between

the Mere of Dead Men and the Sword Mountains, connecting

the City of Splendors to Leilon, Neverwinter, Port Llast, and

Luskan. Overland traf c along the High Road is dominated

by metal ores from the Frozenfar, metalwork from the City

of Sails, lumber from the Neverwinter Woods, the craftwork

of the City of Skilled Hands, and the agricultural and artistic

bounty of the City of Splendors.

The Long Road splits away from the High Road a dozen

miles north of the city proper. It runs north-northeast through

the  Dessarin  River  valley,  passing  through  such  settlements

as  Rassalantar,  Amphail,  Red  Larch,  Westbridge,  Triboar,

Longsaddle, and Xantharls Keep, until it reaches its terminus

in Mirabar. Metal ores and metalwork from Mirabar, cattle

and livestock (including shaggun, a herd animal that resembles

the  bison)  from  Longsaddle,  leatherwork  from  Triboar,  and

Waterdeeps myriad trade goods dominate overland traf c along

the Long Road.

The Trade Way leads south along the coast, passing through

Daggerford before skirting inland of the Trollbark Forest and

Troll  Hills.  South  of  Dragonspear  Castle  it  forks,  with  one

branch  leading  southeast  toward  Scornubel  and  the  Sea  of

Fallen Stars, and the other bending westward to reach the city

of Baldurs Gate and the northern terminus of the Coast Way.

Trade is dominated by raw materials heading south (metal ore,

lumber),  spices  heading  north,  and  agricultural  produce  and

 nished goods sent in both directions.

The East Trail leads east from the Trade Way several miles

south of Ardeep Forest and runs up the lower Delimbiyr valley,

connecting Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh to the Zhentarim-

built Black Road across the sands of Anauroch. Craftwork and

rare spices pass in both directions along this route, although

traf c is but a fraction of that running north and south along

the Sword Coast.

Sea Lanes

Countless ships ply the waters of the Sea of Swords, although

most of them remain within twenty miles of Faerns western

coast.  The  bulk  of  the  Waterdhavian  traf c   ows  along

the  legs  of  the  triangle  formed  by  Waterdeep,  Caer

Calidyrr in the Moonshaes, and Baldurs Gate

and  north  along  the  Twilit  Coast  to

Neverwinter and Luskan. Some ships

venture  farther  south  along  the

coast to Athkatla and Murann.

Only heavily armed merchant

cogs dare Asavirs Channel,

for the pirates of the Nel-

anther regularly prey on

ships headed south to the

coastal  cities  of  Tethyr

and  the  Shining  Sea.

In  recent  years,  more

and  more  shipborne

traf c has headed west

to Ruathym and from

there  to  the  colony  of

New  Waterdeep  in  dis-

tant Maztica. Orlumbor,

Mintarn,  and  the  lesser

isles of the northern Track-

less Sea are infrequent ports

of  call,  but  collectively  make

up  a  not  insigni cant  amount

of sea traf c.

Spells and Portals

As Waterdeeps reputation as the City of Splen-

dors has spread across Faern and beyond, it has increasingly

become the favorite port of call for powerful adventurers, no

matter where the whims of Lady Luck take them. Given the

availability of various teleport spells to such folk, visits to the

City of Splendors can become a fairly standard occurrence. In

order to discourage such folk from appearing in the middle

of a city street and to increase the safety of such travels, the

Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors maintains a deliber-

ate teleport target just northeast of the South Gate, between

the inner and outer walls. Members of the guild ensure that

the  site  remains  both  static  and  very  distinctive,  which  is

important to safe teleportation of all types. A circle of white

marble pillars, each engraved with a stylized depiction of a

local animal (bear, wolf, or the like), make it simple to become

very familiar with the site.

In addition to spells, Waterdeep is also well connected to the

rest of Faern by portals. Unfortunately, thanks to centuries of

16

portal building by the Mad Mage of Undermountain, most of

those portals actually enter the halls of Undermountain and not

the city proper. Known portals leading to and from Waterdeep

include the ones described below.

The  Angry  Coxswain  Portal:  This  one-way  keyed  portal

links the Angry Coxswain alehouse (D67) with a prison cell

in a slave market in the Mulhorandi city of Skuld. This portal

is employed by two slaversthe innkeeper Ramas Shehepset

(NE male Mulan human expert 5) and the house brewmaster

Orth Ironchisel (LE male duergar expert 2/ ghter 6). They

dispatch captives through it and employ Drejjd of the

Unseen to make it seem like the victims are

still around.

The Glow-Gate: This one-way mal-

functioning portal (in the form of

a lit inscription) connects the

depths  of  Undermountain

with a glade in the depths

of  the  Kings  Forest  in

Cormyr. The glade is a

half-days  trek  north,

off the road that links

Dhedluk and Immer-

sea  and  just  west  of

the River Starwater.

Gravegate  of  Ge-

niste:  This  one-way

portal links the depths

of  Undermountain

with  the  abandoned

village  of  Geniste  in

The  Illusk  Arch:  This

two-way portal links the depths

of  Undermountain  with  an

abandoned warehouse in Luskan near the

Ruins of Illusk.

The  Lightsinger  Theater  Portal:  This

two-way  variable  portal  connects  a  prop

room  in  the  Lightsinger  Theater  (C56)  with  portals  in

Ankhapur (in the sewers near the docks), Luskan (a storeroom

in a wheelwrights shop called Wileys Wheels), and Mulmaster

(a  dark  corner  of  the  Scarlet  Hippogriff  Trading  Concerns

main warehouse).

Lost Lovers Gate: This one-way portal links a tidal pool in

a sea cave one mile north of Llorbauths northern gate along

the coast of the Deepwash to the depths of Undermountain.

Lost Princess Road: This keyed two-way portal network con-

nects the Purple Hills, south of the holy house of St. Rhyndas,

with an abandoned quarry in northeastern Amn, by the Troll

Mountains, and with Skarn Rock, off the coast near the mouth

of the River Chionthar. From Skarn Rock, one can travel to

the gorge beneath the Bridge of Fallen Men, west of Cormyr,

to the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, up and east from Silavenes

festhall (C3), and to the con uence of the Unicorn Run and

the River Delimbiyr. However, no one seems to know what the

key is, so would-be travelers will have to discover the key before

using the portal.

The  Sargauth  Flow:  This  one-way  portal  links  the  River

Sargauth with the depths of the ruined fortress of Inthar, which

stands atop a sea crag east of Ruathym and south of Axard.

The  Slitherswamp  Drain:  This  one-way  variable  portal

connects  the  depths  of  the  Slitherswamp  sublevel  of  Under-

mountain  with  the  grasslands  west  of  Ithkyxans  Lair  (see

Serpent Kingdoms  page  108)  in  the  shadows  of  the  western

Serpent Hills and with the depths of the Nameless Dungeon

in the northeastern High Forest.

The  Sundered  Throne:  This  variable  two-way  portal  in

the form of a throne in the depths of Undermountain leads

to the Rat Hills, the exit of the Slitherswamp Drain, one of

the guano-covered sea stacks outside Waterdeeps harbor, and a

vampires tomb in the mountains north of Waterdeep.

The  Welcome  Gates:  This  keyed  two-way  portal  connects

the Lantanna embassy in Waterdeep with Visitors Vale outside

the city of Anchoril on the isle of Suj. In addition to the key

(the  word  Enjoy),  guards  protect  access  to  the  Lantanna

portal,  using  a  maze  of  bureaucracy  designed  to  keep  out

undesirables.

Trade in Waterdeep

In a city as large as Waterdeep, almost anything is available for

sale, and almost anything can be sold. Travelers come from all

over Faern to shop in Waterdeeps markets and bargain with

Waterdeeps merchants. Trade in Waterdeep runs the gamut,

from  nished goods and edible treats to special services and

even illegal items. Most commerce in illicit goods such as as-

sassinations, drugs, poisons, slaves, or evil magic items occurs

in  Skullport,  though  a  good  deal  of  trade  in  minor  illicit

goods (proprietary information and stolen property) occurs in

Waterdeeps own shadows.

Table 11, on pages 1819, lists objects and services available

for sale in Waterdeep (including Skullport) and places where such

things might be acquired or sold. Base prices for almost all of

the goods on Table 11 are as found in Chapter 7 of the Players

Handbook. (The exceptions are broadsheet and chapbooks, for

which base prices are given in the lefthand column of the table,

and certain services for which prices are highly variable.) The

column headers on Table 11 are de ned below.

Category: De nes the general type of goods or services.

Location (Key): Indicates the name of the locale and the map

key (as shown on the city maps, pages 95109). The abbrevia-

tions refer to city wards, as discussed in the introduction.

Markup: This is the price multiplier that a vendor places

on an object or service when selling it (usually 1.0, but ranges

from 0.9 to 1.5). Apply this multiplier to the items base price

to determine how much it really costs in Waterdeep. An entry

of var, often seen for establishments that offer services, means

that the price is variable depending on the quality of service

desired and the result of negotiations.

Resale Value: This is the price multiplier used by a store-

keeper or individual who offers to purchase an object or service.

This value is most often between 0.4 and 0.6 (except for trade

goods, which always have a multiplier of 1.0; see Table 73 in

the Players Handbook). Apply this multiplier to the base price

to determine how much an individual can get for something

he sells in Waterdeep. An entry of na (not applicable) means

that the establishment in question does not purchase goods or

services of this sort.

Research in Waterdeep

Just as Waterdeep is known as a place where nearly anything can

be purchased or sold, it is also a place where spies, rumormongers,

libraries, magical researchers, and sages  ourish. Table 12, on

page 21, provides a list of types of information (usually the

name of a skill) and places in Waterdeep where such informa-

tion might be acquired. Usually, access to such sources provides

a circumstance bonus on appropriate skill checks or access to

someone with many ranks in a particular skill.

Coins and Trade Bars

Although only coins and trade bars minted by the Lords of

Waterdeep are technically considered legal tender in the City of

Splendors, all forms of currency are welcome in this merchant-

friendly city. However, suspect coins and trade bars, including

those of uncertain antique vintage oft-recovered by adventurers,

might be refused or deeply discounted by wary merchants.

Coins  of  Waterdhavian  mintage  include  harbor  moons,

taols,  suns  (platinum  pieces),  dragons  (gold  pieces),  shards

(silver pieces), and nibs (copper pieces). Harbor moons are

worth  50  gp  in  the  city  and  30  gp  outside  the  city  walls.

Named for their traditional use by the docks for buying large

amounts of cargo at a time, harbor moons are fashioned of

platinum inset with electrum and consist of a crescent with a

hole cut into the center of its curve. Taols, worth 2 gp within

the city walls and almost nothing beyond them, are square,

 at brass coins issued and honored by the Lords treasury.

Among  some  neighborhoods  and  classes,  slang  terms  for

various coins rise and fall in popularity. Most Waterdhavians

apply local names to foreign coins as well. Thus an Amnian

danter or Cormyrean golden lion is still called a dragon in

the City of Splendors.

Trade bars are usually blocks of silver (which quickly corrode

to black) in 1-, 10-, 25-, and 50-pound weights (worth 5, 50,

125, and 250 gp, respectively). They are common throughout

the North and used everywhere in Faern. (In the South, gems

are more often used for such purposes.)

City Defenses

Waterdeep is ably defended against external attack, with many

of the defenses dating back to the First and Second Trollwars

and the Orcfastings War. The recent invasions from the sea

during the Deepwater War and the extraplanar invasion during

the Time of Troubles revealed new weaknesses in Waterdeeps

defenses, which the Lords are moving quickly to correct.

The citys  rst line of defense is its topography; Waterdeeps

coastlines  and  placement  atop  the  high,  sloping  plateau  sur-

rounding Mount Waterdeep deter most orc and troll hordes

from even making the attempt. The bald, rough crag enables

the citys defenders to occupy the high ground. Just below the

summit on the landward side is the Peaktop Aerie (C67), home

to the citys griffon cavalry, and two Watching Towers (C68

and C69), one located high above Piergeirons Palace and the

other overlooking the Naval Harbor, give the citys lookouts

unobstructed views in all directions. The citys natural harbor is

a nigh-perfect redoubt on the Trackless Sea. The navy occupies

the Naval Harbor at the west end of the Great Harbor and

garrisons four forts along Deepwater Isle, Stormhaven Isle, and

the Harborwatch Peninsula.

Waterdeep is shielded by the Trollwall, thus named for its

role in the Trollwars. These stout stone walls (AC 3; hardness

small rooms running through the interior. The walls encircle

the entire city, except for a small stretch north of the City

of  the  Dead,  known  as  the  Cliffwatch,  where  the  cliffs  are

so high that they act as effective walls. A second set of walls

wraps  around  the  northern  edge  of  the  city  and  the  South

Gate,  providing  an  additional  line  of  defense  against  land

invasions. Even the islands that form the harbor are walled,

connected to the mainland and each other by stout chains that

bar passage to ships in times of war. Five major gates pierce

the TrollwallSouth Gate, River Gate, Northgate, Troll Gate,

and Westgate.

Waterdeep is also enmeshed in a variety of magic wards,

the effects of which are largely unknown, even (in some cases)

to  Khelben.  Only  Ahghairon  and  Halaster  had  or  have  a

near-complete understanding of Waterdeeps magical defenses,

which typically encompass the outer (forti ed) walls and cliff

tops, all of Mount Waterdeep and Deepwater Isle down to the

low tide lines on their seaward sides, and so reach a maximum

two-dimensional extent of 10,500 feet east to west, and 23,000

feet north to south.

Waterdeeps  armed  forces  include  the  City  Watch,  which

plays the role of a police force; the City Guard, which defends

the city from external land-based threats; the City Navy, which

defends the city from external sea-based threats; and the Griffon

Cavalry, which defends the skies above Waterdeep. The merfolk

and sea elves of Deepwater Harbor form an aquatic contingent

of the City Guard, and the Gray Hands act as an elite strike

force  for  the  Lords.  Waterdeeps  last  line  of  defense  is  the

most importantits ever-resilient citizenry. On more than one

occasion, the inhabitants of Waterdeep have rallied to defend

their city, reinforcing the City Guard and City Watch. Likewise,

the citys arcane and divine spellcasters have crafted numerous

wards and other magical defenses against external attack. Two

examples are given belowAhghairons dragonward and the

Walking Statues.

Ahghairons Dragonward

Just over three centuries ago, the noted adventurer Ranressa

Shiard  ew over the palace and alighted from dragonback atop

Mount Waterdeep to a heros welcome. However, her dramatic

 ourish caused much consternation among the Waterdhavian

populace, leading Ahghairon to craft a magic ward that prevents

most wyrms from doing such a thing today.

The City of Splendors is now blanketed by an epic spell known

as Ahghairons dragonward. Any creature of the dragon type

attempting to enter the city is subject to an antipathy effect (Will

DC 41). The effect is a mythal centered beneath Ahghairons

Tower. Notable exceptions to its coverage include the halls of

the Mad Mage below the city and the docks along the harbor.

(The  southern  reaches  of  Dock  Ward  are  outside  the  effect

because the city slopes down just beneath the wards coverage.

This little-known fact is occasionally exploited by wyrms that

swim into the harbor and meet with minions along the docks

or in the southernmost sewers.)

Although some dragons have obviously bypassed the drag-

onward, even the Lords of Waterdeep are not sure how this is

done. The truth is that any dragon that touches the dragonstaff

of Ahghairon, currently in the possession of Maaril (see page

32), can ignore the dragonward until such time as that dragon

is again struck again by the dragonstaff or until the expiration

of a period of time speci ed by Maaril. As a result, the Dragon

Mage of Waterdeep is able to closely regulate the number of

dragons residing in the city proper, giving him a great deal of

quiet in uence over their number and kind.

At the present time, only a handful of song dragonsMF and

half-dragons permanently reside in the City of Splendors, for the

Dragon Mage has little interest in allowing the entry of those

who could wreak havoc within his demesne. That said, Maaril

sometimes  nds it in his interest to do so. For example, it was

Maaril who enabled Grimnoshtadrano, the Riddling Dragon of

the High Forest, to attack Iriador Garnet Wintermist during

Shieldmeet in the Year of the Wave (1364 DR), thus indirectly

upholding  the  rule  of  the  Lords.  The  Dragon  Mages  price

was the service of Grimnoshtadranos offspring as a steed and

guardian. Likewise it was Maaril who allowed the topaz dragon

Gaulauntyr  (see  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign  Setting)

entry into the city. Maarils price was a small fraction of her

hoard and the promise of regular tithes of stolen magic items.

The Melairshield

Over two millennia ago, the Fair Folk of Aelinthaldaar foresaw

that dwarven Melairbode might one day grow to honeycomb

the entire plateau beneath their city. While the capital city of

Illefarn  is  no  more,  one  enduring  legacy  that  survives  until

this day is the Melairshield, a powerful high magic mythal that

still guards the City of Splendors against excessive tunneling in

Halasters Halls. Speci cally, the Melairshield renders the top

100 feet of the Waterdhavian plateau immune to collapse, no

matter how much dirt and stone is excavated from the depths

of the plateau. It in no way prevents new excavations, magical

or otherwise, but it does prevent the cumulative effect of such

excavations ever leading to the collapse of the plateau.

Although Khelben has discerned that the Melairshield exists,

only Halaster truly understands the protection it affords the

city above and the unspoken thanks owed by the citizens of

Waterdeep to the long-dead High Mages of Aelinthaldaar.

Walking Statues of Waterdeep

Built by the Archmage of Waterdeep and controlled by him

and the Open Lord, the eight giant stone colossi known as the

Walking  Statues  of  Waterdeep  (described  in  more  detail  on

page 139) play a unique role in the citys defense. During times

of peace, one statue stands on Gull Leap, gazing out over the

waters of the Trackless Sea, while the others are hidden away

on the Ethereal Planetwo at the base of the Cliffwatch, two

within Mount Waterdeep (to defend the Castle and the Palace),

one each beneath Northgate, River Gate, and South Gate.

The Material Plane statue is dormant and unmoving, nor-

mally remaining motionless unless under the direct command

of Khelben or the Open Lord. Over time, it tends to accumulate

birds nests, moss, mantles of snow, and other such cosmetic

debris. Many visitors to the city naturally believe it is nothing

more than a gigantic statue. However, certain conditions can

cause  the  statue  to  animate  and  act  to  defend  the  city  even

without an explicit command, based on a set of standing orders

dictated long ago. For example, the statue attacks any Huge

or  larger  creature  that  it  perceives  is  engaged  in  destructive

or hostile activity against the city, and the statue also acts to

defend itself against serious attack.

The colossi on the Ethereal Plane do not shift to the Material

Plane unless summoned by the Open Lord or the Archmage

of the city. However, they actively guard against ethereal intru-

sion into the city. They ignore ethereal humanoids (unless such

creatures are traveling in a company of ten or more) but attack

other ethereal creatures they perceive within the bounds of the

city. Visibility on the Material Plane for an ethereal creature is

limited to 60 feet (see the ethereal jaunt spell, page 227 of the

Players Handbook), so unless an intruder happens to pass close

by one of the city gates or approaches the Castle or the Palace,

the ethereal statues are not likely to notice the intrusion.

The City of Splendors is home to a wide and varied

range of individuals and groups, ranging from the

bards of New Olamn to the Savants of the Dark

Tide, and from the pampered scions of the merchant nobility

to  the  hardworking  members  of  the  Cellarers  &  Plumbers

Guild. This chapter details a sampling of notable and typical

characters usually found in Waterdeep, as well as the organiza-

tions to which they belong.

Guilds and

Organizations

Dungeon  Masters  Guide  II  introduces  rules  for  contacts,

guilds,  and  organizations.  Waterdeep  is  home  to  hundreds

of  distinct  orders,  societies,  noble  houses,  churches,  gangs,

guard  companies,  and  so  on.  The  most  important  of  these

organizations  are  described  with  an  organization  statistics

block that sums up the organizations type, resources, leaders,

and membership bene ts.

For purposes of this presentation, the term guild means any

organization or group, ranging from the clergy of a particular

faith to the city guards to mercantile guilds or associations of

craftsfolk. (The word has a much broader de nition in this book

than it does in Dungeon Masters Guide II, and the format for

organization descriptions presented below varies in some ways

from the format for guild descriptions in that book.)

Organization Format

The various guilds, orders, houses, and organizations of the city

are presented in the following format.

Name  (Size  [Minor,  Standard,  or  Expansive]  Type  [Arcane,

Criminal, etc.]): AL [alignment abbreviation]; # gp resource

limit;  Membership  #;  [Racial  mix:  Isolated,  Mixed,  or  Inte-

1% other.

Integrated: Approximately 37% human, 20% hal ing, 18%

elf, 10% dwarf, 7% gnome, 5% half-elf, 2% half-orc, and 1%

others.

Dues/Salary: If the guild requires monthly dues or a fee to

the organizations members, in order from most common to

least common.

Associated Skills: Skills that all members of the guild or

in Guild feat, you gain this special bene t for belonging to this

guild.

Requirements: Any special requirements of the characters

time  or  efforts  required  by  that  guild  or  organization.  If  a

character does not meet the requirements, he does not gain any

bene ts for belonging to that guild until he begins to meet the

requirements again.

Joining a Guild

In order to join a guild, you must have at least one level in any

one of the guilds associated classes, and you must have at least

4 ranks in any one of the guilds associated skills. Finally, you

must obtain the DMs approval. While big organizations such as

the Church of Tyr turn away few suitable candidates, exclusive

guilds such as Blackstaff Tower dont just take anyone who walks

in off the street.

When you join a guild, you are assumed to be a lay member

you gain a few general bene ts, such as a safe place to sleep and

eat, but you gain no special powers or advantages. If you want

to associate yourself more closely with your chosen guild, you

need to select the Favored in Guild or Guildmaster feats, both

described in Dungeon Masters Guide II. For your convenience,

weve reprinted the Favored in Guild feat here.

NEW FEAT: FAVORED IN GUILD

You are an active and valued member of your guild.

Prerequisites: Membership in a guild.

Bene t: Select one of your guilds associated skills. As long

as you remain a member of the guild, you gain a +2 competence

bonus on all checks made with that skill.

A  guild  member  with  this  feat  also  gains  one  additional

fringe bene t, the exact details of which depend on his guild.

The bene ts are described under each guild entry.

Normal: To receive general bene ts from your guild, you

must pay your monthly dues. You do not gain any guild fringe

bene ts.

Arcane Schools

and Practitioners

Arcane  spellcasters  have  long  been  drawn  to  cosmopolitan

Waterdeep.  The  City  of  Splendors  has  a  strong  tradition  of

magical research, and its role as a central trading hub means

that one can purchase nearly any material component therein.

However,  Waterdeeps  strong  guild  system,  speci cally  the

Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors, has prevented the

formation of many arcanists academies such as those found

in cities such as Silverymoon today or Myth Drannor before

the fall. As a result, most Waterdhavian wizards and sorcerers

are either very powerful lone practitioners or members of the

Watchful  Order.  Likewise,  most  bards  are  either  legendary

troubadours or members of the Council of Musicians, Instru-

ment-makers, & Choristers.

Blackstaff Tower

In the years since Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun rescued Laeral

Silverhand from the madness induced by the Crown of Horns,

the  two  have  dwelt  together  in  Blackstaff  Tower  (C6)  along

with an everchanging roster of apprentices. Over time, as those

apprentices have taken on students of their own, the students of

the Lord and Lady Mage of Waterdeep have effectively formed

an  informal,  elite  arcanists  academy.  Although  Khelben  and

Laeral remain titular master and mistress of the school, most

day-to-day administration and instruction of junior arcanists is

left to the more senior apprentices.

About   fty  apprentices  reside  at  Blackstaff  Tower  at  any

one time. The more senior apprentices, well trained in defensive

magics,  defend  the  Tower  against  monstrous  incursions  and

hostile wizards.

Khelben and Laeral make very sure that no one is treated

badly or allowed to chafe in restlessness, so the temptation of

treachery is slight. Arcanists desiring to leave are always assisted

in setting up in new locations so they part with the folk of the

Tower as friends. The result is a steady stream of arrivals and

departures.  Graduates  of  Blackstaff  Academy  include  Achem

el Zalath (NG male Calishite human wizard 11 of the Guild

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: As a student of Blackstaff

Academy, you are eligible to select the Blessed of the Seven

SistersPG feat, assuming you meet the prerequisites. You can

learn rare or unique spells created by Khelben or Laeral (for

example,  blackstaffMag,  Khelbens  dweomerdoom*,  Khelbens

suspended  silenceMag,  Laerals  cutting  handMag,  and  Laerals

silver lance*, with the notable exception of Laerals crowning

touch*) any time you have the opportunity to learn new spells,

but  you  may  not  learn  more  than  one  such  spell  per  level

gained. Wizards gain three new spells each time they gain a

level instead of two.

Special: Admittance to Blackstaff Academy usually requires

demonstration of exceptional magical talent (Spellcasting Prodigy

or  a  similar  feat)  or  a  uniquely  compelling  personal  history.

Nonwizards are very rarely admitted.

LAERAL SILVERHAND ARUNSUN

Anamanu Laeral Silverhand was born in the Year of the Cowl

(765 DR), the  fth of seven daughters. Raised in Silverhand

Tower  (in  a  wooded  dell  near  what  is  now  Longsaddle)  by

Elminster alongside Dove and Storm, Laeral was the  rst of

the three sisters to set out on her own.

As the Witch-Queen of the North, Laeral founded Stornanter

in the Year of the Warriors Rest (806 DR). The Realm of the

Witch-Queen, roughly triangular in shape, stretched from the

River Mirar to the outlying farms of Neverwinter and from

Swordsea Coast to the Crags. Stornanters capital was the coastal

town of Port Llast, and Laerals tower stood on the high, rocky

spit that sheltered the ports small bay. Stornanter lasted barely

thirty- ve years, twenty- ve of which Laeral spent wandering

the  hinterlands  aiding  the  common  folk.  In  the  Year  of  the

Hunted Elk (841 DR), Laeral was manipulated into battling

Sylun,  and  the  sisters  Silverhand  would  have  destroyed  each

other if not for the intervention of Mystra, who invited both

to become her Chosen.

In the centuries that followed, Laeral wandered the Sword

Coast in the service of Mystra, and she became known for her

fearlessness and for creating magic items. She adopted many

guises during this period, most of which even Khelben does

not know.

Eventually,  Laeral  came  to  lead  a  band  of  adventurers

known as the Nine, and she took them on a long and wild

string  of  adventures  across  the  North.  The  band  split  into

three warring factions in the Year of the Wandering Maiden

(1337 DR) after Laeral succumbed to the Crown of Horns in

the Stronghold of the Nine on the banks of the Unicorn Run.

While  she  was  mad,  Laeral  bore  a  daughter  named  Maura

Silverhand (apparently with the consent of Mystra), who now

dwells on the isle of Evermeet; Mauras father is unknown.

Khelben and Alustriel rescued Laeral in the Year of the Prince

(1357 DR) and slowly nursed her back to sanity over the next

three years in Blackstaff Tower.

Over the past dozen years, Laeral has risen to prominence

as the Lady Mage of Waterdeep, consort of the Blackstaff.

Although she never formally married Khelben, she has taken

his name and is now known as Laeral Arunsun. She runs Black-

staff Tower and has been active in both the Harpers and as an

agent of the Lords of Waterdeep. Given Khelbens off-again,

on-again relationship with both the Harpers and the Lords of

Waterdeep, Laerals relationship with both groups is currently

undetermined. She seems to have retained her in uence with

both, all the while working alongside the Blackstaff and the

Tel Teukiira.

Most recently, Laeral led a Waterdhavian army to relieve

Evereska  from  the  phaerimms  and  snuck  into  Shade  along

with several other Chosen of Mystra in an attempt to bring

down the  oating city. Although Shade was not destroyed, the

citys mythallar was damaged and the Karsestone lost. Laeral

then helped Evereska defeat the phaerimms before returning

to Waterdeep.

Laeral  is  a  slim,  lithe  woman  of  surpassing  beauty  and

impish twinkling eyes. Charming by nature, she is a consummate

actress and a natural judge of character. She is widely admired

by nobles, guildsfolk, and common citizens alike, although some

fear her for her former madness or for her association with the

Blackstaff.  Laeral  is  comfortable  in  both  foresters  skins  and

leathers as well as splendid  nery, and is generally lighthearted,

merry, hard-drinking, and fearless. She dislikes troublemakers

and  those  who  spin  deliberate  untruths  for  harmful  reasons.

Lady Arunsun sees magic as the tool of the little folk to defend

themselves against those who are stronger. She loves to  nd, play

with, and  ne-tune item enchantments, attend parties in formal

garb, and dabble in intrigue. She is the chatelaine of Blackstaff

Tower, a coordinator (now informal) of Harper activities in the

City of Splendors, and a frequent visitor to the Port of Shadow

in the guise of Irusyl Eraneth.

Eltorchul Academy

Upon  inheriting  the  family  spice  and  import  business,  Lord

Thesp Eltorchul invested the family fortune into arcane aca-

demia and rare magical component procurement. The family

has run Eltorchul Academy for three decades now, having slowly

elevated it into an elite bastion of noble scions and the children

of the well-to-do.

In the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), Lord Thesps son

and heir, Oth Eltorchul, was left a babbling husk after dab-

bling in the creation of dream spheres with the Mhaorkiira

Hadryad.  Fallout  from  the  dream  spheres  affair  nearly

bankrupted the family, forcing them to open the doors of

Eltorchul  Academy  to  all  manner  of  students  willing  and

able to pay. As a result, current students and recent graduates

of Eltorchul Academy vary widely in talent, ability, social

status, and outlook, and the academys status among the social

elite has plummeted.

Enclave of Red Magic

The Red Wizards of Thay have long sought to rule Faern. For

centuries, they sought to do so through force of arms, but in

recent years, they have turned to trade as part of a plan of eco-

nomic conquest. Thays Guild of Foreign Trade now administers

sovereign trading enclaves in cities across Faern.

Waterdeeps wealth and role as Gateway to the North makes

it  an  obvious  choice  in  which  to  establish  a  Thayan  enclave.

However,  the  Lords  of  Waterdeep   atly  rejected  the  Three

Laws  of  the  Enclave  when  approached  by  representatives  of

Thay, refusing to compromise Waterdeeps sovereignty or coun-

tenance the sale of slaves within the city. After several years of

futile negotiations, the Thayans  nally found a way around the

restrictions. By reviewing public records detailing the chaos of

Halasters Higharvestide, the Thayans deduced the presence of

a forgotten two-way portal between Skullports Lower Heart

District and Waterdeeps Castle Ward.

Late  in  the  Year  of  the  Tankard  (1370  DR),  agents  of

Thay  approached  the  recently  returned  Shradin  Mulophor

about  establishing  an  enclave  in  Skullport.  The  Lord  of

Bones quickly agreed, and the Thayan enclave was established

shortly thereafter between Beggars Rest Pass and Steamfall

Pass. At the same time, representatives of Thay established

an  embassy  (C70)  in  Castle  Ward  overlooking  the  Market

between the Sutherlane, Mendever Street, and Traders Way.

As an embassy, the building is considered sovereign territory

of  Thay,  exempt  from  the  laws  of  Waterdeep.  Because  the

Red Wizards are careful never to conduct business within the

embassy proper, it is in no danger of losing its sovereign status.

Visitors (customers) are simply conducted to a back room

(through a portal to an inner room in the Skullport enclave)

where  such  transactions  are  concluded.  It  is  the  customers

choice whether to bring purchased goods out of the embassy

or to have them delivered somewhere outside the city walls.

While the Lords of Waterdeep are well aware of how closely

the Thayans are skirting to the edge of the law, for now they

have chosen to simply observe the enclaves transactions. Most

customers are wholly unaware that they have even left Waterdeep,

leading most to assume that the transaction took place within

the city and thus speculate that the Thayans have bought or

bribed themselves an exemption from the law.

The  real  threats  to  the  enclaves  continued  success  are

threefold. First, noble families with dark dealings in Skullport

view the enclave as a threat to their continued domination

of trade with the Port of Shadow. Second, the leaders of the

Watchful Order see the enclaves growth as a direct threat to

their primary revenue streams (the sale of magic items and

rare components), despite the fact that many of the resident

Red Wizards have joined the Watchful Order. Finally, Shradin

Mulophors recognition of the enclave might not be worth

much, given that the Skulls are the real power in Skullport.

The  leaders  of  the  enclave  have  successfully  concealed  this

situation from the Guild of Foreign Trade back in Thay, rec-

ognizing that the enclave might be closed down if the Thayan

bureaucrats realized that the Three Laws of the Enclave are

not really in effect.

Base of Operations: Thayan Embassy (C70), Thayan enclave

in the Lower Heart district of Skullport.

Enclave of Red Magic (Standard Arcane): AL LE, NE, LN;

40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 130; Isolated (humans

125, gnolls 3, tie ings 2); Wages 5 gp per level per month (no

Requirements: You are required to serve in the embassy or

its Skullport annex for an average of 30 hours per tenday. Each

month, you must also donate at least 100 gp of magic items to

not their cost to create.)

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: The guild subsidizes your

monetary  expenses  when  creating  magic  items,  reducing  raw

Special: Membership in Thays Waterdeep enclave is restricted

to natives of Thay dispatched by the Guild of Foreign Trade.

The enclaves ranks also include nonhuman servitors and slaves,

although both groups are restricted to Skullports warrens. Zabbas

Thuul and a handful of others are not actually members of the

enclave, but serve as Skullport/Waterdeep go-betweens.

Some of the enclaves more important characters include:

Ambassador Ethur Anszim: Ethur (LE male Mulan human

wizard 11/Red Wizard 5) is the urbane, witty Thayan ambas-

sador to Waterdeep. He is regularly invited to noble parties across

the city, for he provides an exotic eastern  avor with a whiff

of danger, perfect for the daring host or hostess. In private,

Ethur is harsh and unforgiving, covetous of Waterdeeps great

wealth and determined to bring the City of Splendors to its knees

under his dominion.

Consul Thazar Skullstorm Arkanak: Thazar (NE male

Mulan human  ghter 7/blackguard 2/Thayan knightLD 2) is the

ambassadors personal bodyguard, a dark and glowering  gure

who inspires dread wherever he goes.

Consul Orgin Ulmokina: Orgin (CE male Rashemi human

rogue 7/Thayan slaverUna 3) is the cruel overseer of the Skullport

enclave. He has never been to Waterdeep, and has no interest in

visiting a city that does not allow him complete mastery over

his slaves.

Halasters Heirs

Centuries  ago,  Halaster  Blackcloak  and  his  seven  apprentices

established Halasters Hold and began exploring the dwarven

delvings  beneath  the  plateau.  Of  the  Seven,  one  is  known  to

be dead and two are known to still liveTrobriand the Metal

Mage and Muiral the Misshapen. In addition, in the years since

Halaster claimed the Underhalls for his own, the Mad Mage

has taken on additional apprentices, some of whom still stalk

the depths of Undermountain.

In  the  Year  of  the  Gauntlet  (1369  DR),  the  events  of

Halasters Higharvestide upset the delicate status quo in the

Underhalls of the Mad Mage. Among the tumultuous events of

that day, Trobriand was attacked by his abandoned experiments

and driven from his lair in a deep sublevel of Undermountain,

and Muiral was expelled into the streets of Waterdeep by means

of  a  malfunctioning  portal.  Trobriand  convinced  Muiral  to

return to the  rst level of Undermountain, where the mad-

ness-inducing  magic  of  Undermountain  was  at  its  weakest.

There  the  two  ex-apprentices  forged  an  alliance,  agreeing  to

work together to carve out a new domain largely beyond the

reach of the Undermountains maddening taint, but suf ciently

within Halasters Halls to allow them to continue to pursue

their interests.

As  word  spread  of  a  hidden  arcanists  academy  located

in the  rst level of Undermountain near the shaft to the

Yawning  Portal  (C48),  dozens  of  dark  arcanists   ocked  to

their service, drawn from across the North and the length

of the Sword Coast.

Base of Operations: Level 1 of Undermountain, in the vicinity

of the Yawning Portal.

Eltorchul);  Nandel  Greenward  (CE  female  Illuskan  human

level gained. The guild subsidizes your monetary expenses when

creating constructs, reducing the raw materials cost by 10%.

Muiral and Trobriand are the undisputed masters of the academy.

Muiral the Misshapen: Muiral (CE male tauricSav human/

Large monstrous scorpion barbarian 3/wizard 14/archmage 2)

was once a bodyguard for Halaster Blackcloak. He abandoned his

warrior ways to study the Art under the tutelage of the great

wizard. Muiral was the  rst of the Seven to follow the Mad

Mage  into  Undermountain,  passing  the  tests  of  Halasters

guardian monsters. Muiral established his lair amid the ruins

of Kyorlamshin and began studying superior physical forms.

After he had spent decades experimenting on drow, spiders, and

vermin, Muirals research led to his catastrophic transformation

into a half-human, half-scorpion abomination.

In  the  centuries  since  his  transformation,  Muiral  the

Misshapen  has  wandered  the  deep  ways  of  Undermountain,

stalking and killing all who cross his path. His rage at his own

stupidity for taking this powerful but hideous formcoupled

with the degenerative effects of Undermountain that also af ict

Halasterhas led him into extended bouts of madness.

Only recently has Muiral regained a degree of lucidity. He

now seeks to continue his research, in hopes of achieving a new

and better form. Once again, he has taken apprentices under his

tutelage, but he views them more as experimental fodder than

as wards for whom he is responsible.

TROBRIAND THE METAL MAGE

Trobriand  is  the  most  powerful  surviving  ex-apprentice  of

Halaster,  having  long  ago  made  his  peace  with  his  former

master. Known as the

Metal  Mage  for

his  penchant  for

creating metal

constructs,

Trobriand  avoids  direct  combat,  preferring  to  allow  his  cre-

ations  to   ght  for  him.  The  Metal  Mage  appears  as  a  thin,

clean-shaven man with long, steel-gray hair. He is unnaturally

tall, but he stoops in his old age, bringing his eyes to about six

feet from the  oor.

Trobriand  kept  to  his  heavily  guarded  laboratories  in  the

depths of Undermountain (UM L7) for centuries until he was

driven forth by the events of Halasters Higharvestide. Of the

Seven, he kept the  rmest grip on his sanity, but even he suc-

cumbed in part to Undermountain-instilled madness. Having

 nally recognized the danger posed by remaining therein, the

Metal Mage now seeks to establish a new stronghold in the Lands

of Light, preferably on the site of Halasters Hold, now occupied

by the Yawning Portal tavern.

Trobriand is the true leader of Halasters Heirs, and he is

responsible  for  training  most  of  the  schools  newly  recruited

apprentices. Only his deft touch keeps Muiral from rampaging

through the streets of Waterdeep. Trobriand continues to design

and build constructs of metal, including helmed horrorsMF, iron

golems, and scaladars*.

New Olamn

In the Year of the Wave (1364 DR), a former Harper named

Iriador Garnet Wintermist unleashed a series of unconven-

tional attacks against the inhabitants of the Sword Coast. Her

anger stemmed from the decline of bardcraft and the evolution

of  the  Harpers  away  from  their  founding  ideals.  Although

she  was  ultimately  defeated,  several  Waterdhavians  took  her

lesson to heart and refounded Waterdeeps old bardic college

two years later in what had been the Cliffride villas of Heroes

Rest  and  Stormwatch.  (The  old  location  was  the  House  of

Song [T19].)

Backed  primarily  by  the  Crommer,  Estelmer,  Majarra,

Melshimber, and Thann noble families as well as the Council of

Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers, New Olamn has

become a noted education center and an excellent storehouse of

knowledge in just a few short years, with bards coming from

across the Realms to study within its walls.

Those generally acknowledged to have successfully completed

their studies acquire the title of master bard and, if they choose

to study at the school of New Olamn in the city of Waterdeep,

receive  the  degree  of  Magnus  Alumna  upon  completion  of

Watchful Order of

Magists & Protectors

Technically, the Watchful Order is one of the citys forty-three

guilds,  formed  to  protect  less  powerful  wizards  and  sorcerers

from those distrustful of the Art, but in practice, it acts as the

largest arcane academy in the City of Splendors. The Watchful

Order encourages prudence in the use of the Art so that arcane

spellcasters will be respected and looked up to, not feared and

actively  opposed.  Effectively,  it  polices  less  powerful  arcane

spellcasters who reside in or visit the city, actively discouraging

them from throwing spells around to in uence the populace.

Since many powerful arcane spellcasters are not members of

the Watchful Order, the guild uses its in uence to mitigate their

most egregious behavior as well.

The  Watchful  Order  provides  many  bene ts  to  members,

including forums for arranging instruction and trading in magi-

cal information, the sale of rare material components from the

golem-guarded cellars of the Tower of the Order (C15), and a

market for the buying and selling of spellcasting services, scrolls,

and minor magic items. In addition, members of the guild can

 nd regular employ as  re guards and spell guards. The Watchful

Order contracts with building owners across the city to respond

to  res with summoned water elementals, keeping half a dozen

or so  re guards on duty every day. The guild also contracts with

paranoid individuals of means to provide spell guards skilled in

detecting and countering hostile workings of the Art. The guilds

livery is a dark purple cloak, with a white human hand,  ngers

together and uppermost, on the left shoulder.

Important Characters: Speaker of the Order Orlar Tham-

mas  (CG  male  Illuskan  human  wizard  5/guild  wizard  of

WaterdeepMag 7).

Associated Classes: Adept, sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Craft (alchemy), Decipher

Script, Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Use Magic Device.

Requirements: You must craft at least one magic item for

the guild each month; the item must be worth at least 25 gp.

(Members who craft more expensive items are excused from this

obligation for 1 month per 100 gp of the market price of the

item crafted.) Donating a magic item is an acceptable substitute

for crafting one. In addition, you must serve an average of 20

hours  per  tenday  with  the  Guard,  the  Watch,  or  in  similar

protective duties.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: The Order subsidizes your

monetary expenses when you create magic items, reducing raw

material costs by 10%.

Special:  Many  members  of  the  Watchful  Order  take  the

guild wizard of WaterdeepMag prestige class, which requires an

additional initiation fee of 1,000 gp and carries with it different

responsibilities and privileges. The requirements and dues given

above apply to rank-and- le members.

Most of the rank-and- le members of the Watchful Order are

sorcerers or wizards who pay their dues and provide the minimal

service required to be a member in good standing. A fair number

of guild members dont bother to keep up with their dues and

service, and are content to simply register their af liation once

and then go about their business. Most of the guilds positions

of responsibility are  lled by characters who actually have the

guild wizard of Waterdeep prestige class; these individuals enjoy

a much stronger voice in guild affairs than those who just pay

their dues or take the Favored in Guild feat without pursuing

the prestige class.

Mhair Szeltune: Mhair (NG female Illuskan human wizard

5/guild wizard of WaterdeepMag 10/archmage 4) is a petite, lithe

woman with long, glossy black hair and deep, royal blue eyes.

A serene, ef cient lady of iron will and persistence, she can be

a kind and loyal friend or a harsh, dangerous enemy. As Lady

Master of the Order, she heads the Watchful Order of Magists &

Protectors. She often wanders the city in the illusory guise of an

old crone, surreptitiously checking to see what kind of treatment

she receives. She is an uncanny judge of character and has never

assessed anyone wrongly in the politics and power plays among

(and within) the guilds.

Other Practitioners

Although most arcane spellcasters of lesser or middling power

join the Watchful Order, many powerful loners call the city

home as well. While the most famous independent Waterdha-

vian  wizard  is  undoubtedly  Halaster  Blackcloak,  others  less

well known deserve attention as well. Among the ranks of the

nobility are Lord Huld Belabranta, Lady Hlanta Melshimber,

Lady Alathene Moonstar, Lady Thyriellentha Snome, Telbran

Nelarn (although his relationship with the Cragsmere family

is  unknown),  Lady  Nleera  Tarannath  Tesper,  Lord  Baerom

Thunderstaff  II,  Lord  Maskar  Wands,  and  Lady  Olanhar

Wands. Several notable lone practitioners resident in Waterdeep

are detailed below.

Dagsumn: Gaunt and ghostly pale, Dagsumn (LN male Il-

luskan human wizard 7) is an austere man of moderate height,

given to bulky blue and green robes. Despite his apparent physical

failings, he is a skilled practitioner of the Art with a hunger for

magical power. Dagsumn hails from Port Llast and had a brief

apprenticeship with Malchor Harpell at the Tower of Twilight.

While the two did not part company as enemies, they have not

spoken in over twenty- ve years. Dagsumn came to Waterdeep

to make his fortune, but his brief adventuring career gave way

long ago to casting spells and tutoring lesser mages for fees. He

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

can usually be found at the Elfstone Tavern (C32) and keeps an

apartment nearby with his wife, Kyrss Wands.

Dagsumn prefers to engage in spellcasting in the City of the

Dead, protected by hired guards, where few can glean his secrets

through observation. While friendly and trustworthy enough to

honor any contract, Dagsumn is a stickler for details. Although

he is capable of creating his own magic items and spells, Dag-

sumn would much prefer to collect them in payment with a

minimum of risk or expended gold. He can be somewhat of a

bore and pest when he catches wind of a new item, belaboring

others for details.

Kappiyan Flurmastyr: Kappiyan (NG male Tethyrian human

wizard 7/master alchemistMag 10/Loremaster 3) is a tall, thin,

digni ed man over a century in age with white hair and beard,

bushy eyebrows, and a childlike gleam in his eyes. Despite his

messy line of work, he always wears immaculate gray robes. He

recently married his long-time apprentice, Shalara Malarrkin,

and  these  two  potion  wizards  dwell  in  quiet  comfort  in  a

modest home in Southern Ward (S10). Kappiyan sells potions

and periapts to fund his Mystra-blessed research, but he frowns

on repeat customers who darken his doorstep more than once

every few months. Because his domicile is frequently the target

of thieves, Kappiyan has an array of magical guardians deployed

about his home, and he is never without an array of wands and

potions on his person.

Tessalar  Hulicorm:  Tessalar  (LN  male  Illuskan  human

wizard 18) is a high-voiced, bearded, vain man given to wearing

large amounts of gleaming costume jewelry, who nonetheless is

a respected and well-liked  gure at the galas of Sea Ward. He

often prepares elaborate illusion and pyrotechnics for a sponsoring

noble (whose praise and political support is now more important

to Tessalar than money). Tessalar lacks obvious enemies, but he

still seems unwilling to trust anyone, to the point of paranoia.

Many have correctly divined that Tessalar has aspirations of

founding his own noble house, and more than one established

patriarch has used this fact to his advantage.

Tessalar used to be a mercenary mage who tutored and cast

spells in exchange for treasure, which he then used to further

his research into the making of various magic items. After one

fateful trip to Undermountain, he came back richer than any

man in his generation, laden with emeralds the size of goose

eggs. He still makes and sells potions and scrolls, and he always

demands  payment  in  advance  for  unusual  varieties  (half  in

advance, half upon pickuphe never delivers). Tessalar rarely

leaves his home ($25) except to attend parties, and his magical

defenses daunt even the most powerful thieves.

Unbeknownst to all, Tessalar acquired his fortune by loot-

ing the hoard of the slumbering Vulharindauloth (an ancient

male black dragon), who now dwells in an extensive network

of  ooded caverns beneath Skull Pool in Skullport. Aware that

Vulharindauloth is actively looking for the thief who stole his

hoard, Tessalar is becoming increasingly anxious about his safety,

to the point of anonymously expending large amounts of coin to

hire as-yet-unsuccessful dragon hunters to dispatch the wyrm.

Telbran Nelarn: Telbran (CN male Netherese human sorcerer

24), most commonly known today as Hurlblar Corthyn, is a quiet

man, small in stature, with pale skin and jet-black hair. His deep

blue eyes suggest a man who has seen almost everything and

lived. Before the fall of Netheril, Telbran Nelarn was a scullery

knave in the kitchens of the Ensul Thruin, a quiet Netherese

scholar of the relationship between the Weave and the forces

of the natural world. Telbrans sorcerous powers were awakened

after a jealous rival threw down his masters tower. After  eeing

into the wilderness, Telbran survived using a spell he learned

from a purloined tome of his master, Ensuls soultheft*. In time,

Telbran adopted the life of a traveling trader, using his magic

to extend his life or eliminate foes as needed.

As the centuries passed, Telbran came to restrict his soultheft

to evil arcane spellcasters who, in his view, preyed on others.

Eventually Telbran came to Waterdeep, where he has dwelled

ever since, having fallen in love with its color, bustle, and intrigue.

Seeking privacy, leisure, and the resources to pursue his studies of

magical lore and history, Telbran set about amassing a fortune

soon  after  his  arrival  in  the  City  of  Splendors.  A  few  quick

soulthefts won him the coins of some merchants and smugglers,

which he used to buy buildings and as lending capital. Telbran

made sure to position himself as a generous, wealthy man willing

to loan money to nearly anyone and willing to forgive small

dif culties in paying.

Telbran changed names often, to conceal his rise to wealth,

before  settling  on  Raeraeth  Cragsmere.  His  life  took  an  un-

expected detour when he met and married Salarma Meldart,

an Athkatlan dressmaker, and she bore him  ve sons and two

daughters. Telbran set aside his studies to raise his family, keeping

sorcerous watch over their doings and drinking the lives of those

who worked them ill. He also redoubled his wealth-building to

amass a fortune for his progeny, seizing more coin and properties

from his victims. In time, the Cragsmeres grew very wealthy

and in uential, while Raeraeth retreated into the background,

assuming  the  role  of  aged  family  patriarch.  When  Salarma

died, Telbran faked his own death soon after, retreating into a

succession of shapes and identities. He moved from property to

property, always watching over his descendants, while guiding

them into the ranks of the citys nobility.

Telbran now views Waterdeep as a garden in need of tending,

and  believes  his  killing  of  evildoers  is  simply  a  much-needed

weeding. He is a sorcerer of considerable power who can read

and write many languages, and he knows more Realmslore than

most sages ever learn. He lives quietly, most often in the guise

of Hurlblar Corthyn, a book collector who dwells in modest

upper rooms above Ragathan Furriers (N43).

Savengriff:  Savengriff  (LG  male  Illuskan  human  wizard

20) is a plain-featured man with hazel eyes, pale skin, and dark

brown  hair  and  beard.  Once  a  member  of  the  Company  of

Crazed Venturers, he perished in battle with a beholder before

his companions retrieved his remains and brought him back to

life. He became a loyal apprentice of Khelben and, in time, a

loyal agent of the Harpers and a mage of accomplishment. His

signature creation is the staff of banishment*, of which he has

created at least a dozen copies.

For years, Savengriff wandered the North, serving the Harp-

ers, returning to Waterdeep only occasionally. In time, he took to

exploring the planes, and his ties with the Harpers slowly faded.

In the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), Savengriff returned to

Waterdeep and took a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger

(T3). Although he still maintains his ties with Those Who Harp

(and the Tel Teukiira as well), he now has a new loyalty. During

his  travels  Savengriff  located  the  long-absent  and  legendary

Prespur and Grimwald. After lengthy discussions, the three agreed

to reinvigorate the ancient cabal of good-aligned mages known

as the Covenant. Savengriff is the  rst to return to Faern, and

he is actively seeking like-minded mages of power to join this

ancient brotherhood.

MAARIL THE DRAGON MAGE

Given to wearing dark green or purple robes, the Dragon Mage

of Waterdeep is a handsome, dark-eyed wizard with a jutting black

beard curling from the point of his chin. Famed largely for his

dragon-shaped tower ($30), Maaril is considered just one more

eccentric, independent mage of note by most other wizards of

the city. Khelben is a notable exception, having deduced Maarils

true nature in recent years, but he is hesitant to confront Maaril

for the reasons detailed below.

Born in the Year of the Wandering Wyrm (1317 DR), Maaril

was fostered in the House of Wonder ($21) and apprenticed at a

young age to Lhoril Delhiirnyn, a mage who had survived the

Guildwars and avoided exile. Once Maaril felt he had learned all

he could from Lhoril, he summoned a demon to slay her and

framed a rival apprentice for the murder. The infamous Dragon

Tower of Maaril was once Lhorils abode.

Maarils many secrets included his legion of guardgoyle* servi-

tors, his recent mastery of the gate spell, and his never-ending

efforts to seize magic items from overly boastful adventurers by

means of such servitors. He has proven himself a quiet, patient,

behind-the-scenes foe to all adventurers who retaliated against

him, hiring endless sellswords to bar their way.

Maarils greatest treasure is the dragonstaff of Ahghairon,

a legacy of Ahghairon stolen by Lhoril in the immediate after-

math of the legendary archmages death and taken in turn by

Maaril after he murdered his instructor. The Dragon Mage of

Waterdeep holds the literal key to Ahghairons dragonward (see

page 20), a fact that gives him a great deal of in uence over the

citys resident dragon population.

The Dragon Mage has many foes and few allies among the

populace of Waterdeep, but nonetheless he is regularly invited

to revels hosted by the Waterdhavian elite. Maaril has made

himself  suf ciently  in uential  that  it  is  dangerous  to  annoy

him. The Dragon Mage bears a particular enmity for Duhlark

Kolat (CG male Illuskan human transmuter 20), who brie y

turned Maaril into a faerie dragon after Maaril goaded him

into an ill-advised spell-duel. (Duhlark is the brother of Alcedor

Kolat, who is mentioned on page 148 in connection with the

quarterstaff of Alcedor and the amulet of Alcedor.) Maarils

closest friend is Meleghost Starseer, the Magister of Mystra at

the House of Wonder ($21).

Maaril  has  reached  an  understanding  of  sorts  with  most

dragons that reside in the City of Splendors, for he always treats

them with proper respect, and they reply in kind. Among those

dragons that dwell outside the City of Splendors but seek to enter

the city, Maaril is regarded with distrust, if not loathing, for he

invariably frustrates such plans. As a result, the Dragon Mage

must take signi cant precautions each time he exits the city.

Maarils dragon cohort is Khavalanoth (LE male juvenile

green dragon). The offspring of Chloracidara of Mhiilamniir

and Grimnoshtasdrano the Riddling Dragon is pledged to serve

the  Dragon  Mage  until  he  becomes  a  young  adult.  Maarils

familiar is Frethian, a black cat.

Arcane Fire (Su): Maaril can change arcane spell energy into

arcane  re, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The

bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (440 feet) that

deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage per level

of the spell used to create the effect.

Frightful Presence (Ex): When Maaril attacks or charges,

all opponents within 30 feet who have less than 18 Hit Dice

become shaken for 1d6+3 rounds. The effect is negated by a

DC 22 Will save. A target that saves successfully is immune

to Maarils frightful presence for 24 hours. This ability cant

affect creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or lower, nor does

it have any effect on dragons.

Possessions: Maarils scaled bracers (bracers of armor +8),

Maarils mantle (cloak of Charisma +4), Maarils gloves (gloves

of  Dexterity  +4),  Maarils  brooch  (amulet  of  proof  against

other planes. He knows many of the wizard/sorcerer spells in

the Players Handbook as well as some of those found in Magic

of Faern.

Armed Forces

The Lords of Waterdeep enforce their rule and maintain peace

and security through the citys armed forces. Waterdeeps defend-

ers are divided into four branches: the Griffon Cavalry, the City

Guard, the City Watch, and the Navy. The Gray Hands act as

an elite company, called in for emergencies.

Griffon Cavalry

Waterdeeps griffon-riders patrol high above the skies of Water-

deep, defending Mount Waterdeep and the city below against

intrusion. The Griffon Calvary is an elite company of the City

Guard, and its leader, Lord Moedt, reports directly to General

Obryn Iron st.

Special: Joining the Griffon Cavalry requires swearing an

oath of loyalty to the city of Waterdeep. Prospective members

must demonstrate pro ciency in combat (a base attack bonus of

at least +3) and know the Mounted Combat feat. The Griffon

Cavalry  is  quite  prestigious,  and  prospective  members  often

have to arrange favors or make signi cant donations to civic

causes in order to join.

Griffon riders are given griffon badges of Waterdeep* on join-

ing the company. They are issued griffon mounts and lances of

burning black re* in order to perform of cial duties, but may

not use their mounts or magic weapons for personal reasons

without obtaining special approval from Lord Moedt. Members

of the Griffon Cavalry wear the same uniform as the Guard,

but have a griffon emblazoned on their tabard.

SAMPLE GRIFFON-RIDER

A griffon-rider patrol consists of four griffon-riders and their

as honor guards for visiting diplomats. Contingents of the Guard

and the Watch jointly man the city gates; the Guard controls

access, while the Watch observes those who enter, pursues fugi-

tives, and escorts visitors into the city.

Base of Operations: Castle Waterdeep (C76), Guard Armory

(C47), Guard Barracks (C19, D56, N1), Piergeirons Palace (C75),

various towers and gatehouses surrounding the city.

City Guard (Expansive Government): AL LN,

Guards.  Whenever  you  are  adjacent

to another Guard, you both gain a +1

competence bonus to AC.

The uniform of the Guard is brightly

polished chainmail, covered by black

tabards  with  gold  trim.  Guards  carry

weapons appropriate to their posting, such

as longswords, rods (treat as masterwork

clubs),  shortbows,  shortspears,

short swords, and daggers.

The  Guards  ranks  and  command

structure  are  similar  to  that  of  the  City

Watch (detailed below), except the army is appor-

tioned not to wards but to various garrisons along

the city wall, in Castle Waterdeep, Piergeirons Palace, and in the

surrounding countryside.

Madeiron Sunderstone: Madeiron (LG male Illuskan human

paladin 15, JotunbrudRac feat) stands an astonishing eight feet

tall in height, a throwback to his Ostorian lineage. He keeps

his head shaved and his muscular form lightly oiled, giving

his opponents no chance to grab him in combat. Madeiron is

famous  for  his  polished  blue  full  plate  (+1  blueshineMag  full

plate), a greataxe known as the axe of heavenly  re (see page

147),  and  the  9-foot-long  iron  bar  (treat  as  a  Large  heavy

mace) he uses for crowd control. He is virtually fearless, but

not especially bright. However, his perseverance makes him a

formidable foe.

Madeiron hails from Hartsvale, a small kingdom nestled in

the mountains north of the Silver Marches. He is a distant cousin

of the current royal family, tracing his lineage back to King

Brun I, son of Hartkiller. Madeiron came to Waterdeep over

two decades ago after a long and varied career as an adventurer

in the Inner Sea lands. He rose through the ranks of the City

Guard to become the Champion of Piergeiron, the Open Lords

personal bodyguard. Madeiron stays at Piergeirons side in the

Palace and outside the city, and he answers any challenges

to the Open Lord with his own weapon.

SAMPLE CITY GUARD

A Guard patrol consists of twelve members: a civilar

City Navy

Heavily reliant on maritime trade, Waterdeep has long

maintained  a  powerful  navy  capable  of  dominating  its  rivals

along  the  Sword  Coast  and  protecting  its  merchant  shipping

from pirates and monstrous threats.

In times of war, merchant sailors are press-ganged into the navy

and encouraged to swear an oath of loyalty to Waterdeep.

The navys  eet consists of 16 fast rakers (or dromonds),

slim top-armored vessels usually armed with two  re-pot light

catapults and two large deck-mounted ballistae that the guard

uses with stunning accuracy against pirates and smugglers. These

ships have armored bow rams, banks of oars, and two masts for

crowding on sail in pursuit or when speed is essential. They are

supported by twenty-four small lateen-sailed galleys, known as

strikers, and  fteen large, wallowing troop-and-supply vessels,

or transports. At least two naval rakers are always on patrol

outside the harbor, and another two are on ready duty within

the  harbor.  At  least  four  others  will  be  on  extended  patrol

somewhere off the Sword Coast on any day in peacetime.

City Watch

The City Watch serves as Waterdeeps police force, patrol-

ling the city and ensuring the well-being of its inhabitants.

In  addition  to  arresting  those  who  break  the  laws,  Watch

patrols  often  assist  passersby  with  heavy  loads,  give  direc-

tions, search for lost children, provide basic medical aid, and

referee verbal disputes.

The  commander  of  the  watch  is  Captain  Rulathon,  who

reports to Piergeiron. His senior commanders are Grand Civilar

Derek Winds re (NG male half-moon elf  ghter 11), Mage

Civilar Thyriellentha, and Senior Armsmaster Helve Urtrace.

Each ward is commanded by a ward civilar and has a number of

guard posts, each commanded by a senior civilar. Each patrol is

commanded by a civilar, who reports to the local senior civilar.

There is also one skulk (made up of a half-dozen rangers and

rogues) per ward commanded by a Senior Skulk, and one arca-

num (made up of a half-dozen sorcerers and wizards) per ward

commanded by a Senior Watch-Wizard.

Base of Operations: Piergeirons Palace (C76).

The uniform of the Watch is a doublet of leather armor studded

with iron rings, under an overshirt of green, black, and gold.

Members of the Watch are armed with light steel shields, clubs,

daggers, and short swords.

The watch has access to the armories ($75 and C76) of the

guard, the Palace (C75), and the wall-towers. All on-duty mem-

bers can enter any building or area in the city without hindrance

or warning and can search any person, place, or container at

will, unless speci cally forbidden by a Lord. Traditionally, certain

areas  are  lightly  patrolled,  such  as  the  docks,  and  others  are

heavily patrolled, such as the City of the Dead. If a watch patrol

encounters a major disturbance, they will blow the distinctive

trembling note horns they carry on their belts to summon

aid, and one member of the patrol will immediately run to the

nearest guard tower or guard post to spread the word, usually

summoning additional aid from the guard of necessary.

If a watch patrol makes an arrest, two members of the patrol

immediately escort the captive to a Magister, while the others

continue patrolling. The watch prefers to disarm and capture

suspects  who  do  not  surrender,  but,  in  cases  of  great  danger,

lethal force is authorized. Afterward, speak with dead spells are

employed on the dead to determine the truth and then resurrec-

tion spells are paid for by the city if necessary.

Emmer Jundhyl: Emmer (NG male Illuskan human rogue

1/ ghter 7) is a large, beefy, outgoing man, given to great boom-

ing laughs and a ready smile. He is the watch civilar of North

Ward  and  close  friends  with  Regnet  Amcathra  and  Scirkhel

Wands  (see  page  63).  Emmer  has  been  recently  replaced  by

Fengharl of the Unseen (NE doppelganger), but as yet no one

has detected the change.

Mulgor of Tyr: Mulgor (LG male Illuskan human cleric 7

[Tyr]) is Waterdeeps collector-of-fees, a stolid, polite no-nonsense

man who is escorted by the Watch while on his money-collecting

rounds. He is diligent, inexorable, and never forgets a face, a

name, or an unpaid fee. Those who slip out of the city without

paying and return years later are confronted by a patient, courte-

ous Mulgor. The Tyrran cleric of ciates at ceremonies for the

followers of Tyr in the Palace, but does not serve in the Halls

of Justice, believing that would compromise his role as collec-

tor-of-fees. Mulgor lives in apartments in the Palace, one of few

who actually live there other than Piergeiron and his daughter,

but ventures forth at least once a tenday to share an ale with

old friends at the Elfstone Tavern (C32).

Rulathon: Captain Rulathon (LG male Chondathan human

 ghter 13) is a distinguished, gray-haired man of slight build

and  wiry,  tough  muscles.  His  square-jawed  face  is  lined  with

wrinkles earned in the line of duty. He is fair, but tough, and

willing to arrest troublemakers dozens of times until he either

wins a conviction or drives them from the city in exasperation.

As captain of the watch, reporting directly to the Open Lord,

Rulathon  represents  the  watch  in  Palace  ceremonies  and  has

overall command responsibility for the safety of the city. The

captain is famed for taking a personal hand in tough  ghts,

wading into battle in full plate armor bearing his famous Red

Sword  (+4  defending  longsword).  In  tight  spots,  Rulathon

employs his iron horn of Valhalla, which both summons im-

mediate  reinforcements  and  alerts  all  members  of  the  watch

within earshot to come on the run.

Thyriellentha Snome: Mage Civilar Thyriellentha (LG female

Illuskan human wizard 13) is a capable, friendly, and powerful

woman. She can also be petty and grasping, seeking more power

in all manner of legal ways. She has commanded the watch-wizard

corps for nearly a decade, earning the ire of many subordinates

for her strict, demanding standards. Thyri, as she is known

to friends, felt betrayed when her grandfather, Lord Arrabas

Snome, chose her cousin Dandobar as his heir instead of her.

Ever since, she has had little to do with her family, despite the

fact that Dandobar has named her his heir.

Brace  Ulmemur:  Brace  (CN  male  Chondathan  human

 ghter 7) is a beefy, hard-faced man with an unlucky past. He

is a loyal friend and has a sharp, biting wit, but, if crossed, will

obsessively hunt down and kill the betrayer. Despite his fervent

devotion to Lady Luck, every adventuring company Brace has

been part of has been decimated by monsters while exploring

ruins of the North. Brace is not greedy and quite dependable

to those who treat him fairly, but he is mildly paranoid and

distrustful of others that he does not know. Nevertheless, he

has acquired a reputation of sorts (kissed by Beshaba) that

keeps him from  nding regular employ in adventuring bands.

As a result, Brace joined the City Watch to  nd a more regular

source of income. Brace does not have a regular abode other

than the city barracks (C19).

Helve Urtrace: Helve (LG male Tethyrian human  ghter

6) is a quiet, rugged man with a scarred visage, an oft-broken

pug  nose,  and  missing  teeth.  While  aged  and  balding,  he

can still put many of this watch recruits (and any taproom

brawler)  through  their  paces.  Helve  is  the  close-mouthed,

always calm Senior Armsmaster of the City Watch, responsible

for purchasing, maintaining, and keeping an account of all

weapons used by of cers of the watch. If one goes missing, he

investigates. In tavern talk, he is said to put secret marks on

all such weapons, but that is simply rumor. Helve also drills

watch of cers in the use of their arms, and is said to know

every trick of tavern- and street- ghting. If a watch patrol

calls for reinforcements, and the reinforcements in turn have

to blow their horns for additional reinforcements, Helve will

almost certainly arrive. He carries a rod of smiting when on

duty,  and,  when  answering  a  summons  to  trouble,  is  often

accompanied by his watch-wizard daughter, Lassree Urtrace

(NG female Tethyrian human wizard 7), and a dozen or two

additional watch of cers.

SAMPLE WATCH PATROL (EL 6)

A watch street patrol consists of four members: a civilar (cap-

tain or lieutenant), an armar (sergeant), and two watchmen or

watchwomen.

The Gray Hands

Although Waterdeep is ably defended by the City Guard and City

Watch, some threats require more extreme solutions. The Gray

Hands are an elite force of high-powered adventurers who answer

directly to the Lords of Waterdeep. Although their numbers are

small, members of this group are capable of confronting the most

powerful foes. The Lords of Waterdeep are loath to call on the

Gray Hands unless no other option prevents itself, for the fallout

from con icts involving this group inevitably in ict a great deal

of collateral damage on the City of Splendors.

Base of Operations: Blackstaff Tower (C6).

The Gray Hands (Minor Mercenary): AL LG, LN, NG, CG;

15,000 gp resource limit; Membership 20; Mixed (human 16,

half-elf 2, shield dwarf 1, frost giant 1); Salary 100 gp/month

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Special: A prospective member must demonstrate excellent

combat skills or powerful spellcasting to join the Gray Hands

(minimum +5 base attack bonus or 3rd-level spells). Members of

the Gray Hands usually adopt the Gray Hand enforcer prestige

class as soon as possible.

Asper: Asper (CG female Illuskan human sorcerer 1/ ghter

8) is a lithe, petite beauty, soft-spoken yet merry, and a great

contrast to her voluminous husband Mirt. Although not formally

part of the Gray Hands, this daring worshiper of Lady Luck

adventures  with  them  enough  to  be  considered  an  honorary

member of the team.

Hrusse of Assuran: Hrusse (LN male Mulan human cleric

14/Gray Hand enforcer 1 [Assuran/Hoar]) is a sallow-skinned

exile from Unther, banished from his homeland by the theocrats

of Gilgeam ere the god-kings fall. He is vengeful, intense and

driven,  never  forgetting  a  slight  or  provocation.  Hrusse  has

adopted Waterdeep as his own, avenging the city in the eyes of

Assuran whenever it or the Lords is insulted or damaged.

Carolyas Idogyr: Carolyas (LG female half-moon elf sorcerer

14) is the wild, magic-hurling heart of the Gray Hands, who

joined the group to escape the strictures of life as a watch-wizard.

She has curly  ame red hair she lets run wild and  ashing green

eyes that burn with power. The niece of Gamalon Idogyr (Tethyrs

Court Sage and Count of Spellshire), Carolyas often clashes with

Khelben over his conservative views on the use of magic.

Jardwim: Jardwim (NG male Illuskan human ranger 15/Gray

Hand enforcer 3 [Mielikki]) has shoulder-length black hair, a

Van Dyke beard, and a stocky, muscular build. His skin retains

a grayish cast from being petri ed by the original Xanathar.

Jardwim is the ruthless, indomitable leader of the Gray Hands,

who believes that if his team is needed, any resistance should

be met by lethal force. He hates losing or even being fooled by

anything. His concentration on the task at hand is legendary.

Two blink dogs usually accompany the ranger. (Although Jard-

wim is the of cial leader of the group, he reports to Khelben

Blackstaff Arunsun.)

Maliantor: Maliantor (NG female Tethyrian human wizard

10/Gray Hand enforcer 3) has long, braided brown hair, sea-green

eyes, and an impish smile. She favors practical breeches, tunics,

and twin baldrics stuffed with scroll cases. As a former student

of Khelben often referred to as Blackstaffs Eyes, Maliantor is

rumored to be one of his main agents outside the Tel Teukiira,

in addition to her work with the Gray Hands.

Churches and

Religious Orders

Polytheistic Waterdeep is home to all manner of faiths. The citys

largest temples include the Font of Knowledge (Oghma, C4), the

Halls of Justice (Tyr, C5), the House of Heroes (Tempus, $58),

the House of Inspired Hands (Gond, $38), the House of the

Moon (Selne, $56), the House of Wonder (Mystra, $21), the

Shrines of Nature (Silvanus and Mielikki, $5), the Spires of the

Morning (Lathander, C1), the Temple of Beauty (Sune, $10),

the Tower of Luck (Tymora, $19), and the Plinth (all faiths,

T38). Temples to dark gods, such as Ghaunadaur, Loviatar, and

Shar, are said to lie in the depths of Undermountain. The City

of Splendors is also home to religious orders such as the Order

of the Aster (Lathander), the Order of the Blue Moon (Selne),

the Order of the Sun Soul (Lathander, Selne, Sune), the Order

of the Even-handed (Tyr), and the Holy Order of the Knights

of Samular (Tyr). The following is a brief accounting of the

various faiths active in Waterdeep.

Church of Cyric

The church of Cyric considers Mount Waterdeep sacred to the

Dark Sun, for it was here that Cyrics ascension took place in

front of the watchful eyes of Waterdeeps populace. The Dark

Suns more fanatic devotees make regular pilgrimages to the

City  of  Splendors.  Waterdhavians  have  never   ocked  to  the

Dark Suns banner, but many rich Waterdhavians winter in the

warmer climes of Amn, where the church of Cyric is strong.

The interest of a few of these well-off individuals in the decadent

practices of the South ensures Cyrics clerics a steady stream of

noble patrons willing to fund activities in Waterdeep. Three of

the more prominent Cyricists to frequent the City of Splendors

are described below.

Malchior  of  Darkhold:  Malchior  (CE  male  Chondathan

cleric 13 [Cyric]) is a fat,  eshy, gray-bearded man whose cun-

ning is matched only by his greed. Malchiors  rst loyalty is to

himself; the Dark Sun is a distant second. Although he remains

part of the Zhentarim, Malchior rarely returns to Darkhold

these days, a place that has fallen increasingly under the sway of

the church of Bane. The Cyricist is a master manipulator who

enjoys bending others to his will. Malchior regularly exercises

in uence  over  the  judgments  of  Dag  Zoreth  (see  Bronwyn

Caradoon,  page  74),  Bronwyns  brother,  and  Sir  Gareth

Cormaeril (see page 49) through a combination of blackmail,

careful prevarication, and charisma.

Xorla Djannas: Xorla (CE female Tethyrian human illusionist

7/arcane devoteePG 5 [Cyric]) is a native of southern Tethyr who

ventured north to Waterdeep with her master Selpar Thynn, but

she was abandoned when Thynn died in a tavern brawl. Xorla

found her true calling at the end of the Time of Troubles. Having

observed the ascendance of Cyric to godhood, she pledged herself

to be one of his  rst and most devoted followers. In the years

since her conversion, Xorla has wandered Faern in service to

the Dark Sun, spreading word of her faith and collecting lost

tomes of arcane lore for the church of Cyric. Nevertheless, she

often returns to Waterdeep to pray at the spot where Cyric  nally

received his due.

Tomas  Siohcen:  Tomas  (NE  male  Chondathan  human

cleric 5 [Cyric]) is a thin man with a pockmarked face given

to  frequenting  the  Dock  Wards  dreariest  taverns  in  dark,

hooded  robes.  Tomas  harbors  a  deep  and  abiding  hatred  for

the Church of Talona, for he suffered greatly as the slave of a

Talona-worshiping Calishite in his youth. Tomas sees the Unseen

as the perfect expression of the Dark Suns teachings and his

enthusiastic support for the druuths war against the Lords of

Waterdeep is simply a front for his long-term goal of building a

cathedral to the Dark Sun atop Mount Waterdeep at the sight

of Cyrics ascension.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Church of Gond

Waterdeep has long been a bastion of enterprising artisans and

craftsfolk, many of whom worship the Wonderbringer. Merchants

from Lantan are believed to have  rst introduced the teachings

of Gond to the settlement, and their teachings were in large part

responsible for the ascendance of Waterdeeps mercantile culture.

The Waterdhavian branch of the church has long bene ted from

the generous donations of Waterdeeps prosperous tradesfolk.

In  recent  years,  as  Waterdeeps  economic  troubles  have

multiplied,  donations  to  the  churchs  coffers  have  fallen  off,

undermining the authority of the temples leaders with respect

to  the  rest  of  the  faith.  In  response,  High  Seeker  Jhoadil

Zulthind has partnered with the Splendid Order of Armorers,

Locksmiths, & Finesmiths, the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons,

Potters,  &  Tile-Makers,  and  the  Watchful  Order  of  Magists

&  Protectors  to  begin  actively  marketing  constructs  to  the

wealthiest  Waterdhavians,  attempting  to  corner  the  market

for such devices. Smiths, stonemasons, and sorcerers across the

city are now employed in the fabrication of caryatid columnsFF,

dread guardsMM2, guardgoyles*, helmed horrorsMF, iron golems,

nimblewrightsMM2, shield guardians, and stone golems.

Base of Operations: House of Inspired Hands ($38).

Requirements: You must craft an item worth at least 2 gp and

donate it to the temple once per month. You must also adhere

to the tenets of Gonds faith.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: The church subsidizes the

costs of any construct or magic item you create, reducing your

raw material costs by 10%.

Special: Admittance to the clergy of Gond usually requires

demonstrable understanding of the churchs teachings (2 ranks

in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the Wonder-

bringer.

Many members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of

Gond feat, once they qualify.

High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind: Jhoadil (N female Lantanna

human cleric 10/techsmithFP 5 [Gond]) is a plump, green-eyed,

copper-haired woman, with the characteristic parchment-colored

skin of her ancestors. She projects the amiablealmost grand-

motherlyair  of  someone  is  a  tinkerer  with  little  ambition.

In truth, she is extremely strong-willed and driven, consumed

with the same drive that leads some to become master artisans.

In  the  High  Seekers  case,  she  seeks  acknowledgement  as  the

preeminent cleric of Gond in western Faern. Jhoadil has just

begun a secret project to automate the creation of golem body

parts (thus creating half-golemsFF) despite the risks of doing so.

Jhoadil is convinced that she can succeed where those before her

have failed, but she has kept such investigations secret from her

construct-making partners who might disapprove of her new

line of inquiry.

Church of Lathander

Although  humankind  has  dwelt  in  the  shadow  of  Mount

Waterdeep since the abandonment of Aelinthaldaar, the City

of Splendors has retained the energy of an up-and-coming com-

mercial center full of promise for generation upon generation.

This spirit of renewal is both in harmony with the teachings of

the Morninglord and the primary reason so many Waterdhavians

embrace the teachings of Lathander. As a result, the Church of

Lathander is one of the leading churches of Waterdeep.

The  Church  of  Lathander  is  divided  into  three  factions,

although there is little discord between the three: the clergy of

Lathander, the Order of the Aster, and the Order of the Sun Soul.

The clergy focus primarily on ministering to the faithful. The

Order of the Aster encompasses the Morninglords holy warriors,

dedicated to the destruction of evil undead and the defense of the

clergy. The Order of the Sun Soul is not formally part of the

Morninglords church, as it claims equal allegiance to the churches

of Selne and Sune, but in truth, this monastic brotherhood has

long been primarily associated with the followers of Lathander.

However, the Waterdhavian branch of the Sun Soul Order has

recently begun espousing a heresy that might eventually lead to

a split among the three branches of the Morninglords church.

CLERGY OF LATHANDER

The clergy of Lathander are considered by the followers of the

Morninglord to be the Church of Lathander, encompassing both

the Order of the Aster and the Lathander-worshiping members

of the Order of the Sun Soul. In practice, however, the cleric

faction  of  the  Morninglords  church  encompasses  only  those

individuals  who  are  not  members  of  the  other  two  factions.

The  clergy  of  Lathander  concern  themselves  primarily  with

the encouragement of the arts and acting as patrons for artists,

performers, and craftsfolk.

active participation in your guild. Once per character level, you

can call upon this inner faith and thereby gain a +5 bonus on a

Senior members of the order usually adopt either the mornin-

glord of LathanderPG or sunmasterLE prestige class.

Ghentilara:  Sunrise  Lord  Ghentilara  (LG  elderly  female

Chondathan human cleric 6/morninglord of LathanderPG 10

[Lathander]) is the aging high priestess of the Spires of the

Morning. Ghentilara still has the smooth, olive-hued complex-

ion of a young girl from her native Chondath, but her long

braided hair has turned snow-white over the years. Although

she is strict and has little patience for mischief or blasphemy,

Ghentilara is much beloved by her congregation. Ghentilara is

as comfortable tending to an ill family in a small hovel in Dock

Ward as she is while attending the most extravagant gala of the

year, and she makes time for both in her busy days. Although

she is increasingly uncomfortable with the preaching of Hanor

Kichavo of the Sun Soul Order, she has yet to break publicly

with him, fearing that such a split would divide the church and

undermine its effectiveness.

Mhaere Dryndilstann: Mhaere (NG female Illuskan human

cleric 5 [Lathander]) is the quiet, devoted, iron-willed wife of

Durnan the Wanderer. She hails from Neverwinter, where she

was raised by an uncle who served as a priest of the Mornin-

glord. Mhaeres hands are skilled in both healing and dealing

death in battle. Her skills are frequently called upon to heal

dying adventurers as they are hoisted out of Undermountain,

and she has been known to drop a coin to those in desperate

need of a way up from the bottom of the shaft when Durnan

is not looking.

ORDER OF THE ASTER

The Order of the Aster serves as the church army of the faithful

of Lathander. In alliance with devotees of the Moonmaiden

and other like-minded deities, members of the order, sometimes

known as Soldiers of the Light, continue their eternal battle with

the forces of darkness and destruction, speci cally the followers

of Bane, Shar, and Talos.

Each  member  of  the  Order  of  the  Aster  is  assigned  to  a

company of the Morninglords church army. Each company is

housed in one of a dozen or so church-sponsored abbeys scattered

across western and central Faern. Companies are dispatched by

the commanding abbot to battle enemies of the faith, usually

in response to an entreaty from a high-ranking cleric of the

Morninglord. Between tours of service, members of the order

are frequently given leave to pursue their own goals. Most spend

their time defending individual temples of the Morninglord, but

some serve the faith by becoming adventurers. In Waterdeep,

many  members  of  the  Order  of  the  Aster  contribute  to  the

defense of the City of Splendors by serving in the City Guard.

Most members of the order are instructed in the Disciple of the

SunCD feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order usually

adopt either the morninglord of LathanderPG or sunmasterLE

prestige class.

Jandar Ilbaereth: Jandar (LG male moon elf wizard 7/arcane

devoteePG 2 [Lathander]) is tall, thin moon elf with fair, blue-

tinged skin, silver-white hair, and striking gold- ecked purple eyes.

He joined the Foes of the Fang in the Year of Maidens (1361 DR)

to help rid the northern frontiers of a heretofore unknown plague

of vampires. Jandar met his future wife, Corinna Lathankin,

during his adventuring years when she joined the Foes of the

Fang. After disappearing in Mirabar, Jandar returned to alert

his comrades-at-arms to the presence of a troupe of vampires in

Mirabar. The Foes of the Fang destroyed the charm, but they

were forced to slay Jandar as well when it became apparent that

he too had become one of the undead. After his resurrection,

Jandar rejoined the group as a living member. The elf and his

wife are the only surviving members of the now-defunct group,

as the others died destroying a vampire in Castle Khommel in

the Gray Peak Mountains several years past. Jandar joined the

Order of the Aster upon his return, intent on reshaping the

order into the most ef cient vampire-hunting army ever seen.

Corinna  Lathankin:  Corinna  (LG  female  half-moon  elf

wizard 3/cleric 3/Mystic Theurge 10 [Lathander]) has a beauti-

ful, wai ike  gure and soft face that belie her intense energy

and loud, commanding voice. Corinna is a highly emotional

woman who focuses her passions into her spells and activities.

The illegitimate daughter of a minor noble, she grew up at the

Spires of the Morning (C1) and has dedicated her life to the

worship of Lathander and the destruction of vampires. Corinna

is married to Jandar Ilbaereth, and remains close with Olanhar

Wands (see page 63), who tutored her in the Art. Like Jandar,

Corinna was until recently a member of the now-defunct Foes

of the Fang and joined the Order of the Aster upon her return

to Waterdeep.

Corinna continues to rely on her half-brother, Djarrus Gost

(NG male Chondathan human aristocrat 6, now charmed), for

news and information of vampire activity in western Faern.

Unbeknownst to anyone but Corinna and Jandar, Djarrus was

the silent patron of the Foes of the Fang, donating money and

resources to the groups efforts and supplying them with informa-

tion about ongoing vampire activity in the North. Of course,

Corinna would be horri ed to learn that Djarrus is a charmed

servant of Artor Morlin, receiving the bulk of his information

from the master vampire of Waterdeep.

ORDER OF THE SUN SOUL

During the Age of Netheril, the Netherese venerated Amau-

nator, Keeper of the Eternal Sun, as the lord of bureaucracy,

contracts, law, order, sun, and rulership. An order of itinerant

monks known as the Brotherhood of the Sun served the faithful

in the  eld, bringing the comforting words of Amaunator to the

peasants and common folk. Although the Brotherhood of the

Sun survived the fall of Netheril and the death of the Yellow

God, it never coalesced around a successor to Amaunator. Instead,

each monastery chose its own god to serve, with most eventually

gravitating to Lathander (god of dawn) or Selne (goddess of

the moon and stars), but a few choosing Sune Firehair.

Today, the Brotherhood of the Sun is known as the Order

of the Sun Soul, and the groups original association with the

Church of Amaunator has been largely forgotten. The order now

admits both men and women, but retains its itinerant nature and

ancestral focus on serving the common folk of the Realms.

The  Order  of  the  Sun  Soul  maintains  a  large  monastery

in the city of Waterdeep, due in large part to the presence of

prominent churches of Lathander, Selne, and Sune. The orders

current leader, Monastic Abbot Hanor Kichavo, is attempting to

unify the three sects of the order into a cohesive whole for the

 rst time in centuries. Drawing selectively on historical texts

that survived the Netherese diaspora and the fall of Calimshans

Cajaan dynasty, he preaches that Lathander, Selne, and Sune

are tripartite fragments of Amaunator, and that the Yellow God

shall rise anew once the three are uni ed to form the one.

Base of Operations: Monastery of the Sun (T46).

Order  of  the  Sun  Soul  (Standard  Religious):  AL  LG,  LN;

Requirements: You must engage in charitable work among

the poor, sick, and needy. This requires an average of 20 hours

per tenday.

Favored  in  Guild  Fringe  Bene t:  Lathander  teaches  that

undead must be destroyed. Once per character level you can call

upon your faith to enter a state of holy resolve, which lasts for

1 minute. While in this state, you gain a +2 morale bonus on

attack rolls and damage rolls against undead.

Special: Admittance to the Order of the Sun Soul usually

requires demonstrable athleticism (2 ranks in Jump or Tumble,

or the Athletic feat) and a vow of obedience to one of the three

acknowledged patrons of the order.

Monks of the Sun Soul Order can gain levels in one other

class and still progress as a monk as long as their monk level is

their highest class level. Senior members of the order usually

adopt the Sun Soul monk prestige class.

Hanor Kichavo: Monastic Abbot Hanor (LG male Tethyr-

ian human monk 10/Sun Soul monk 10) keeps his head shaved

and favors bright yellow robes. Although he has an easy smile,

he speaks with the fervor of a true believer who  nds himself

called  to  be  a  teacher.  Hanor  is  the  spiritual  heart  of  the

Waterdhavian branch of the Order of the Sun Soul and one

of only a handful of monks with a following across the order

as a whole. Hanor has drawn the ire of Waterdeeps powerful

churches  of  Lathander,  Selne,  and  Sune  for  his  heretical

preaching, a feeling echoed by the more traditional members

of his order. More than one rumor has spread through the City

of Splendors suggesting that the esteemed Monastic Abbot is

in the thrall of the Lady of Loss and that his teachings are

designed to weaken Waterdeeps good-aligned churches. Whether

or not his actions lead to such a state, Hanor truly believes in

what he preaches.

Church of Loviatar

The Church of Loviatar has a large and growing body of adher-

ents among the more decadent members of the Waterdhavian

nobility, including several members of House Anteos and House

Husteem.  In  the  City  of  Splendors,  worship  of  the  Maiden

of Pain has traditionally been con ned to private homes and

disreputable Dock Ward cellars, but the cult has  ourished with

the recent establishment of a new temple in the uppermost level

of Undermountain.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Participation in Loviatars

rigorous observances has inured you to pain. Once per character

level, you can enter a state of unholy suffering in which you gain

damage reduction 2/ and ignore the effects of being sickened

or stunned. This state lasts for 1 minute.

Special:  Admittance  to  the  Church  of  Loviatar  usually

requires demonstrable understanding of the churchs teachings

(2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]) and a vow of devotion to the

Maiden of Pain.

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate

of  LoviatarSS  feat,  once  they  qualify.  Most  Loviatan

monks are members of the Disciples of the White Rod

and  instructed  in  the  Pain  TouchCW  feat,  once  they

qualify. Senior female members of the church usually

adopt the maiden of painPG prestige class.

Hlethvagi  Anteos:  High  Whipmaster  Hle-

thvagi  Anteos  (LE  male

Chondathan human cleric

10  [Loviatar])  is  a  fat,

wispy-bearded,  sinister

little  man  who  favors

 ne  robes,  silken  sashes

and  waistcoats,  bejew-

eled  daggers,  and   ne

whips.  He  enjoys  only

two  things  in  life:  in-

 icting pain and staying

 lthy  rich.  Hlethvagi

has  long  led  a  double-

life  in  Waterdeep;  his

public  persona  is  that

of a somewhat prosper-

ous warehouse-operator,

carter, and moneylender

who lives in a mansion

in  Sea  Ward  ($68)  and

runs  a  business  based  in

Southern Ward (S51), but most

of his fortune comes from his undercover

trade run through a web of intermediaries. His minions have

controlled the Long Dark Stair (UM L1)a fabled, long-for-

gotten entrance to Undermountainfor nearly two decades. He

rarely exposes himself to danger, and is never without a group

of bodyguards.

After  years  of  leading  foul  worship  services  to  Loviatar

in  various  cellars  in  Dock  Ward,  Hlethvagi  funded  the  con-

struction  of  a  new  temple  in  the  northwestern  chambers  of

Undermountains  rst level in the Year of the Banner (1368

DR). The House of Pain (UM L1) is now a growing power in

the upper reaches of Undermountain, guarded by the orcs of

the Grinning Skull tribe. It is drawing increasing support from

various disaffected nobles.

Yolanda  Shamat:  Yolanda  (NE  female  Tethyrian  human

cleric 5/maiden of painPG 4 [Loviatar]) is a daunting  gure: a

tall, sturdily built woman in her late thirties with dark, swarthy

features. She has pale blue eyes and midnight black hair that she

braids and coils around sharp iron needles. Yolanda, or Yola as

she is sometimes known, carries herself rigidly erect and moves

with deliberate purpose, cowing everyone around with an icy

stare. She serves as chamberlain for Lady Ellandra Tolbert (N

female Illuskan human necromancer 14), an important  nancier

of the churchs activities in Waterdeep, who purchased Yolandas

release from slavery.

Church of Mystra

Waterdeep has a strong tradition of both wizardry and

sorcery. Waterdhavians inclined to worship one of the

arcane faiths (Azuth, Mystra, Savras, or now Velsha-

roon) have traditionally favored the Lady of Mysteries,

dating back to the establishment of the House of Wonder

in the Year of Starlight (1215 DR).

In Waterdeep, the Church of Mystra has long played

a secondary role to the Watch-

ful Order of Magists &

Protectors  because  the

sale of spells and magic

items is traditionally the

province of the guild, not

the church. The relation-

ship  between  guild  and

church  has  been  upset

in  recent  years  by  the

growth of the Enclave of

Red Magic and attempts

by  Meleghost  Starseer,

the temples high priest,

to reach out to the Red

Wizards.

Waterdeeps Mystran

church  is  closely  allied

with  the  Church  of

Selne,  and  the  two

faiths  work  together  to

battle  the  followers  of  Shar.  In  the

aftermath of the Time of Troubles, Meleg-

host Starseer joined Naneatha Suaril in founding the Knights

of the Blue Moon, in large part to remove High Moonknight

Xale from his leadership role at the House of Wonder. Although

Knights of the Blue Moon are of cially welcome in the House

of Wonder, Meleghost has made clear that he  nds their pres-

ence distasteful.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Mystras faith

and craft one magic item per month of at least 25 gp value to

donate to the church.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: The church subsidizes your

monetary expenses when you create magic items, reducing raw

material costs to you by 10%.

Special: Admittance to the Church of Mystra usually requires

demonstrable understanding of the churchs teachings (2 ranks

in Knowledge [religion] and 2 ranks in Knowledge [arcana]) and

a vow of devotion to the Mother of All Magic. No member of

the church may have the Shadow Weave MagicPG feat.

Most members of the clergy are instructed in the Initiate of

MystraPG feat, once they qualify. Senior members of the order

usually adopt either the arcane devoteePG or dweomerkeeperFP

prestige class.

Ilbrost Mythyl: Ilbrost (NG male Tethyrian human cleric

3/enchanter 6/dweomerkeeperPG 3) is an aging enchanter who

deftly relies on his magic to maintain his prominent social

position. Ilbrost is always immaculately groomed, with a wand-

thin mustache, sumptuous wizardly robes, and slicked-back,

thinning gray hair. Ilbrost is the nominal leader of the cleric

faction seeking to unseat Meleghost, but his lack of personal

ambition  for  the  job  has  kept  him  from  rebelling  strongly

against  his  superior.  Ilbrost  is  nervously  attentive  to  the

growing wave of dissatisfaction with Meleghosts leadership,

seeking to position himself on the winning side, no matter

who prevails.

Meleghost  Starseer:  Magister  of  Mystra  Meleghost  (LE

male Chondathan necromancer 13/arcane devoteePG 5) is the

cruel,  urbane  master  of  the  House  of  Wonder.  He  has  long,

slender   ngers,  a  shaven  head,  and  a  neatly  trimmed  goatee.

Given to long  owing robes adorned with runes, Meleghost is

 ercely devoted to the Lady of Mysteries and her patronage

of all avenues of arcane investigation, including necromancy.

The Magister of Mystra is a close friend of the Dragon Mage

Maaril and the leaders of the Eltorchul family, but he has never

gotten along well with either the Blackstaff or the members of

the Wands clan. Meleghost has a cold, formal relationship with

Naneatha Suaril, high priestess of Selne, and an icy, almost

hostile, relationship with Xale of the Starry Glen of the Order

of the Blue Moon (see page 83).

Of late, Meleghost has been reaching out to members of

the Red Magic Enclave, despite the opposition of his long-

time allies in the Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors.

Although the Magister of Mystra professes that he is simply

observing his vow to the Lady of Mysteries and ministering to

all the faithful, the long-standing campaign by some members

of the clergy to remove him from his position as high priest

has gathered strength as more and more guild members voice

their discontent.

Church of Oghma

Although the Binder has long been honored Waterdeeps bards,

wizards,  and  sages,  only  recently  has  the  church  of  Oghma

achieved  the  status  of  a  major  faith  among  the  populace  of

Waterdeep. The faiths recent rise to prominence is the result of

hard work and careful diplomacy by Savant Sandrew the Wise.

House Estelmer gave generously to the construction of the Great

Library, assembling the tomes in the Estelmer villa before the

temple was completed.

In the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), the Font of Knowledge

(C4) was  nally completed, and the temple staff moved from its

former temple, a row house on Swords Street, to the beautiful

new structure. House Estelmer took the lead in collecting and

organizing the collection of tomes and scrolls before the temple

was  even  complete,  allowing  the  church  of  Oghma  to  open

the doors of the Great Library in possession of the greatest

assemblage of books found in the City of Splendors.

Although the most valuable service offered to the city by the

Binders disciples is the Great Library, the informal result has

been the creation of a market square for the citys notoriously

independent sages. Because most recognized sages spend at least

several hours each day among the stacks, adventurers in need of

immediate information have taken to seeking out the Council

of Sages in the Font of Knowledge.

The Church of Oghma is closely allied with the bardic col-

lege of New Olamn (C72) and receives a great deal of  nancial

backing from members of House Estelmer and House Majarra.

It is also closely linked with the Scriveners, Scribes, & Clerks

Guild, which hosts a small chapel to Deneir within its guildhall.

A keyed two-way portal links a bricked-up archway in a scribes

chamber on the second  oor of the Font of Knowledge (C4)

and the library on the second  oor of the Zoarstar (T25) to

a library hidden in a secret chamber of the old dwarf hold in

on constructing a temple and library worthy of the Binder and

the City of Splendors. He brought with him a handful of clerics

from his old temple in Silverymoon, and he has continued to

recruit additional clerics and librarians.

Church of Selne

The church of Selne is one of the citys oldest faiths, as fol-

lowers  of  the  Moonmaiden  have  worshiped  on  the  slopes  of

Mount Waterdeep since the Year of the Half Moon (390 DR).

During the time of Bloodhand Hold, the church was known

as the Cult of the Howling Moon, made up of good-aligned

lycanthropes who gathered at what is now the Dancing Court.

The cult was driven from the city by Nimoar the Reaver, but

subsequently returned.

In the Year of the Gleaming Crown (1097 DR), two years

after  donating  the  Plinth  (T38)  to  the  Lords  of  Waterdeep,

Selnites began worshiping at the newly constructed High House

of Stars (see Vault of Stars, page 120). The temple stood until

the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when it was attacked and

burned by in ltrators from below. The Moonmaidens followers

began worshiping at the House of the Moon ($56) in the Year

of Soft Fogs (1188 DR), where they have remained ever since,

having foiled an arson attempt in the Year of the Saddle (1345

DR) on the Night of Temple Fires.

Led  by  the  charismatic  Priestess  of  the  High  Moonlight

Naneatha Suaril, the church of the Moonmaiden has waxed in

strength since the Time of Troubles, when the church of Selne

foiled the dark plots of Shar and her followers. Naneatha lent

strong  backing  to  the  effort  to  found  the  Order  of  the  Blue

Moon after the Time of Troubles, and High Moonknight Xale

and other knights of the order are in regular attendance at the

House of the Moon.

Naneatha Suaril: Priestess of the High Moonlight Naneatha

(CG  female  Illuskan  cleric  6/silverstarFP  10/divine  disciplePG

4  [Selne])  is  deliberate,  proud,  and  more  than  a  match  for

Waterdeeps haughtiest nobles. As the daughter of a minor Nev-

erwintan noble family and the sister of Lady Wylynd Moonstar

(see  page  62),  Naneatha  has  impeccable  fashion  sense  and  is

known for her rich, bejeweled gowns of the  nest make. Having

never forgiven herself for falling victim to Shars machinations

during the Time of Troubles, Naneatha has crusaded against the

Dark Ladys followers ever since.

ORDER OF THE BLUE MOON

Mystryl, the original goddess of magic, is said to have been

born of Selne. Although Mystryls second successor Mystra

(once  the  mortal  wizard  Midnight)  retains  dominion  over

the Weave, Selne is thought by some to retain a measure of

in uence over her twice-removed daughters portfolio, causing

the Weave to ebb and  ow much as the moon causes tides in

Torilian bodies of water.

The  Order  of  the  Blue  Moon  is  a  small  religious  order

dedicated  to  both  the  Mother  of  Mystryl  and  the  reigning

Lady of Mysteries. The group draws its name from  uctua-

tions of the Weave that result in localized concentrations of

magic  that  occur  at  varying  locations  during  nights  of  the

full moon, causing Selne to appear blue in color. Members

of this order serve both goddesses in their endless battles with

Shar, the Mistress of the Night. They seek advantage over the

dark servants of their eternal foe by making strategic use of

Selnes in uence over the Weave combined with the power

of the Weave itself.

The order gathers only to debate shared goals and propose

new  missions  beneath  the  light  of  a  blue  moon.  The  orders

hidden chapter house is said to lie amid the Red Rocks north of

Waterdeep, protected by both the ever-raging waters of the sea

and a permanent maelstrom of wild magic. However, Waterdeeps

House of the Moon serves as the orders day-to-day center of

operations,  for  Naneatha  Suaril  actively  supports  the  orders

the Knight of the Blue Moon* prestige class.

Church of Shar

Although  adherents  of  the  Nightmaiden  have  long  been

active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep, the Waterdhavian

church of Shar traces its origins to a disastrous expedition to

the Black Jungles in the Year of Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by

Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a noted explorer in his day. Formerly

a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler, Vanrak returned a pale

shadow of his former self. Within a tenday of his return, Lord

Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange

wasting disease unknown to Waterdeeps healers and strangely

resistant to their spells.

Lord Vanrak assumed leadership of House Moonstar and

publicly broke with the priests of the High House of Stars (see

Vault  of  Stars,  page  120),  whom  he  blamed  for  his  fathers

untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as

he came to be known, secretly embraced Selnes ancient enemy,

the Lady of Loss.

By  the  Year  of  the  Howling  Moon  (1130  DR),  House

Moonstar was in open schism. Those Moonstar nobles who still

venerated Selne aligned themselves with Lord Vanraks sister,

Lady Alathene, and took refuge in the temple of Selne. At

the Moonstar villa in Dock Ward (now the Blushing Mermaid

festhall [D36]), Lord Vanrak and his followersa small army

of mercenaries and priests of Sharextended their dark in u-

ence over much of the citys harbor.

On the night of the seventh full moon of the year, Lady

Alathene asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of

his title and banish him from the city. To prove her case, she

presented evidence of her brothers numerous crimes including

slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the Dark

Rangers immediate capture, but when the watch breached the

gates of the Moonstar villa, Lord Vanrak and his followers

had disappeared.

Unbeknownst to his moon-worshiping kin, Lord Vanrak had

 ed through a secret portal into Undermountain. For decades

thereafter, the Dark Ranger and his followers explored Halasters

Halls. In the Year of the Dark Mask (1181 DR), Vanrak and

his followers conquered a highly defensible redoubt in the Dark

Levels of Undermountain (UM SLM). From this base, the

church of Shar grew strong, exerting its in uence throughout

much of Undermountain and periodically dispatching assassins

and marauders to battle followers of the Moonmaiden in the

city above.

The church of Shar achieved its most dramatic success in the

Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when Vanraks followers in ltrated

the cellars of the High House of Stars and slaughtered most

of  the  inhabitants.  They  also  acquired  enough  treasure  from

the  temple  vaults  to  fund  Lord  Vanraks  personal  quest  for

immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger voluntarily

transformed himself into a death knightMM2the perfect, eternal

servant of the Lady of Loss.

In recent years, Lord Vanraks followers have failed to execute

several important plans. In the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR),

the Dark Army of the Night tried to set a re the House of

the Moon ($56) as part of the Night of Temple Fires. In

the Year of Shadows (1358 DR), the avatar of Shar attempted

to subvert the Moonmaidens church by masquerading as her

ancient foe and imprisoning the avatar of Selne. Shars faithful

were driven from the city after followers of the Moonmaiden

freed Selne from Shars clutches, forced to nurse their bitterness

anew in the darkness of Vanrakdoom.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Special: The church of Shar requires members to be true ad-

herents of the Lady of Loss, with a demonstrable understanding

of the churchs teachings (4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics, but

all divine spellcasters are welcome. Most members of the clergy

are instructed in the Initiate of Shar* feat, once they qualify.

Senior members of the church usually adopt the nightcloakFP

prestige class.

Gathgaer  Milomynt:  Gathgaer  (NE  male  Chondathan

human cleric 7 [Shar]) is a beak-nosed, alert-looking man with

close-cropped brown hair and beady brown eyes. He favors dark

robes and a handy mace at his belt. Gathgaer purports to be

a medicinal healer, selling medicines and treatments out of a

run-down house in Dock Ward (D68). In truth, he is a slaver,

kidnapping folk of little in uence or pro le in Waterdeep and

transporting them down into Undermountains second level by

a two-way keyed portal that leads from his iron maiden to a

sarcophagus. Gathgaer sells the slaves to Hlethvagi Anteos (see

page 42), who transports them down to Skullport.

Church of Talos

The Storm Lord does not have a large following in Waterdeep,

although many sailors in Dock Ward whisper prayers as a storm

approaches while at sea. Nevertheless, itinerant Talosians visit

the  City  of  Splendors  from  time  to  time,  leaving  a  trail  of

destruction in their wake.

Sumer  of  Calimport:  Sumer  (CE  male  Calishite  human

cleric 5/stormlordFP 4 [Talos]) is tall, slim, dusky-skinned and

dark-haired,  favoring  purple  robes  and  an  excessive  amount

of  silver  jewelry.  He  has  become  rich  trading  goods  between

Calimport and Waterdeep, and he visits the City of Splendors

two or three times per year for a tenday or so each visit. Sumer

is never without his regular bodyguard ( ve Calishite human

warrior 3) and his crony Greeme (CE male Calishite human

 ghter 5/rogue 1/assassin 2), who favors poisoned blades.

Although  Sumer  keeps  a  low  pro le  and  does  not  cause

public trouble, he kills at least one person on each visit for the

glory of Kozah (Talos), despite the efforts of his brother-in-law

Olophin (a civilar in the City Guard) to frustrate him. Sumer

usually targets adventurers, as they regularly disappear through

their own foolishness and thus are unlikely to be missed. Sumer

typically chooses a target after concluding his business, follows

the target around the city until they are weak or resting, and

then attacks. He will  ee if is life is threatened, sacri cing his

guards to make his escape.

Church of Tymora

The City of Splendors has long been a beacon for adventurers

who trust their lives to Lady Luck. The donations of those who

braved the depths of Undermountain and survived to tell the tale

alone were enough to construct the Tower of Luck ($19) in just

a few short years. Nevertheless, the church of Tymora continues

to struggle, due in large part to the lack of adherents among the

year-round citizenry. Some say that High Lady Priest Seenroas

and Lord Prior Markos are too mercenary, trading in luck as

if it were a commodity, while others say they are ignoring the

burgeoning number of adherents among the hal ing population

of Waterdeep.

Base of Operations: The Tower of Luck ($19).

Church of Tymora (Standard Religious): AL CG, CN, N; 40,000

Requirements: You must adhere to the teachings of Tymora,

and give a special offering of at least 50 gp value every time a

stroke of great luck favors you (you roll a 20 on an attack roll

or saving throw).

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Once per character level

you can call upon the powers of chance to intercede on your

behalf immediately prior to a single d20 roll. You gain a bonus

equal to 1d104 on the roll; if the result is negative, you take

the appropriate penalty instead (fate is  ckle, after all).

Special: The church of Tymora requires members to be true

adherents of Lady Luck, with a demonstrable understanding of

the churchs teachings (2 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics,

but all divine spellcasters are welcome. Senior members of the

church sometimes adopt the auspicianFP prestige class.

Elegul  Another:  Elegul  (male  Tethyrian  human  cleric  7

[Tymora]) is a kind soul who aids those in need of healing and

help.  To  avoid  creating  a  dependence  on  Tymoras  favor,  he

eschews joining adventuring bands and instead wanders, dispens-

ing the bene cence of Lady Luck. Since his recent escape from

Undermountain, he has con ned his ministries to the city proper

and its immediate aboveground environs.

Lamris Kholl: Lamris (CG female human cleric 5 [Tymora])

is a strikingly beautiful woman from Llorkh with a vivacious

and unpredictable nature. Although loyal and true to her call-

ing, she can be rather irresponsible and capricious. She recently

managed to rescue her family from Zhent-controlled Llorkh

thanks to the unasked-for aid of Adama, and now, after years of

toying with his emotions, is beginning to view him in a much

more positive light.

Adama  Miiralin:  Adama  (CG  male  Chondathan  human

cleric 5 [Tymora]) is a nave, kindly young priest from Arabel

with aspirations of rising up in a temple hierarchy far from

the heresies of his native church. He is a nightly regular at the

Yawning  Portal  (C48),  attending  to  adventurers  entering  or

exiting Undermountain and keeping a record of who dares the

ultimate test of Lady Luck. Despite his normally wise demeanor,

Adama trusts in luck implicitly, taking wild risks as a matter

of course.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Church of Tyr

Waterdeep has long been a bastion of justice and the rule of law

in the North (or at least has aspired to be such), thanks in large

part to the followers of Tyr who have long played an illustrious

role in the governance of the City of Splendors. As such, the

church of Tyr and its associated religious orders hold a prominent

role in the citys religious and political life, but con icts between

the  twin  obligations  of  faith  and  public  service  have  created

discord and division among the faithful.

The four primary factions within the Waterdeep arm of the

church include members of the government, the formal cleric

hierarchy, the Holy Order of the Knights of Samular, and the

Order of the Even-Handed. Members of the government include

Piergeiron the Paladinson (see page 53), Madeiron Sunderstone

(see page 34), Mulgor of Tyr (see page 35), Rulathon (see page

36), and Texter (see page 55). Few last long in such positions

if their primary obedience is not to god and government  rst.

For example, Piergeiron would not last long as Open Lord if it

became apparent that he put the dictates of the cleric hierarchy

above  the  best  interests  of  Waterdeep.  In  contrast,  members

of the cleric faction owe their primary allegiance to god and

church  hierarchy,  while  members  of  the  religious  orders  owe

their primary allegiance to god and brotherhood.

CLERGY OF TYR

The clergy of Tyr are considered by the followers of Grimjaws

to be the church of Tyr, encompassing the independents, the

Order of the Even-Handed, and the Holy Order of the Knights

of Samular. In practice, however, the clergy encompasses only

those who are not members of the other three factions.

Base of Operations: Halls of Justice (C5).

10 gp/month.

Authority  Figures:  Hammer  Lord  Hykros  Allumen  (see

Associated Classes: Barbarian, cleric,  ghter, monk, paladin,

Requirements: You must adhere to the tenets of Tyrs faith

and spend at least 20 hours a tenday engaged in charitable work

among  the  citys  poor  or  in  attendance  in  the  citys  temple,

assisting petitioners.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Tyrs teachings have helped

you to differentiate truth from falsehood in the pursuit of justice.

Once per character level you can call upon your teachings to

gain a +5 bonus on any one Sense Motive check.

Special: The church of Tyr requires members to be true ad-

herents of the Maimed God, with a demonstrable understanding

of the churchs teachings (4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics and

paladins, but all divine spellcasters are welcome. Most members

of the order are instructed in the Initiate of TyrPG feat, once they

qualify. Rare members of the church are suf ciently zealous

to take the Hand of Tyr* feat. Senior members of the order

sometimes adopt the justiciar of TyrPG prestige class.

Hykros Allumen: Hammer Lord Hykros (LG male Illuskan

paladin 20) is the high priest of the Halls of Justice (C5) and

the leader of the clergy of Tyr in Waterdeep. Hykros is a devout

worshiper of the Maimed God and a strong pillar in the defense

of the rule of law in Waterdeep. He is also a student of the

churchs  early  traditions,  believing  that  the  followers  of  Tyr

have gradually fallen away from the truths revealed when Tyr

 rst marched across Faern in the Procession of Justice.

As a result of his traditional and orthodox beliefs, Hykros

rejects many aspects of the modern church. In particular, he

 rmly rejects the notion that Tyr is the latest incarnation of

Anachtyr, a belief held by most southern sects of the church, and

his prejudice in this regards extends to most non-Northerners. In

addition, he regards Tyrran cleric, monk, and paladin traditions

as distinct and separate, and he looks with distaste upon those

who attempt to fuse these clearly de ned roles.

Jhassalan of the Lightning: Jhassalan (LG male Illuskan

human evoker 7/arcane devoteePG 1 [Tyr]) is a native of Silvery-

moon whose title stems from his penchant for electricity spells

and the lightning-shaped shock of blond hair that runs from

his  temple  and  over  his  brown-haired  scalp.  Jhassalan  was  a

member of the ill-fated Guild of the Just, an adventuring band

of Tyrrans who attacked the House of Pain in Undermountain

to free a bunch of captives but was then ambushed by the forces

of  Loviatar.  Jhassalan  escaped  only  due  to  the  unlooked-for

aid of Muiral the Misshapen. In the years since that failure,

Jhassalan has rededicated himself to the service of Tyr, and now

leads the small contingent of arcane spellcasters who serve in

the Halls of Justice (C5). He retains his deep loathing for the

Church of Loviatar and continues to investigate from where

it is receiving its funds.

HOLY ORDER OF THE KNIGHTS OF SAMULAR

In the Year of the Rings Royal (952 DR), the Second Troll War

 nally ended under the leadership of Aeroth, War Captain of

Silverymoon. One of the great heroes of that war was Samular

Caradoon, a Tyrran knight whose bravery and faith were un-

surpassed. Samular was the third of three brothers: The oldest,

Renwick,  studied  wizardry,  while  Amphail  the  Just  and  his

younger brother Samular became paladins of Tyr.

Nearly  two  decades  before  the  war,  Renwick  Caradoon

acquired a trio of artifacts of mysterious purpose now known

as the rings of Samular and later gave them to Samular to

hold. When the Second Troll War began, the magic of the

three rings enabled the brothers (each of whom temporarily

held one of the rings) to employ a magic siege engine known

as Kezefbane to great effect against the trolls, lifting the siege

of Waterdeep. For his heroism and leadership, Amphail was

elevated to the position of War Lord of Waterdeep after the

battle, only to die in a troll raid less than a year later. Without

the third brother, the effectiveness of Kezefbane against the

trolls  was  greatly  diminished.  Nevertheless,  Samular  played

a key role in Aeroths eventual victory through his martial

prowess and valor; in so doing, Samular acquired a legion of

devoted followers. Renwick fell in the  nal battle, but the eldest

brother had prepared to transform into an archlich, a process

he began as he lay dying. Only Samular knew that Renwick

had survived his death in battle.

After the war, Samular formed an order of Tyrran paladins

based in the North. Under Samulars leadership, the order seized

Thornhold,  the  keep  of  a  petty  warlord  named  Brunyundar

Margaster, and made Thornhold its chapterhouse. Located just

south of the Mere of Dead Men, Thornhold became the personal

property of Samular and his direct heirs. Renwick retreated into

his tower in the Sumber Hillshis undead state would have been

considered an abomination by many of Samulars followersand

Samulars acceptance of such would have destroyed the  edgling

order. Samular ordered that a training monastery, Summit Hall,

be  built  around  Renwicks  tower,  and  that  the  tower  remain

undisturbed for all time, in honor of his brothers memory. The

heart of the order moved to Waterdeep, occupying a wing of the

Halls of Justice (C5).

gaze. He favors chainmail covered by a white tabard bearing the

symbol of Tyr and rides a white stallion named Icewind. Where

once he was an earnest young man, full of certainty and strong

in faith, Algorind is now a man adrift. Although he is earnest,

dedicated, and sincere, his willingness to follow the orders of his

superiors unquestioningly has led him far from Tyrs principles,

much to his confusion. As a result, Algorind relies on Sir Gareth

Cormaeril (see below) for advice and direction even more than he

did in years past, unaware that it was Sir Gareths manipulation

that has sent him on one lonely, futile quest after another for the

past few years. Algorind has only recently returned to Waterdeep,

determined once again to prove his worth to his beloved order.

He has orders to avoid Bronwyn Caradoon (see page 74), since

the two worked to opposite ends in the Thornhold affair.

Harkas Kormallis: Harkas (LG male Illuskan human paladin

8/justiciar of TyrPG 6 [Tyr], Hand of Tyr* feat) is the eldest son

of Lord Helm Kormallis. He is also Tyrs Champion, tasked

with the defense of the Halls of Justice (C5). Of the two roles,

Harkas takes only the second seriously, because he is fanatically

devoted to the service of the Maimed God, going so far as to

cut off his right hand to demonstrate his faith. Harkas is the

senior paladin of the Knights of Samular based in Waterdeep,

and he strictly governs the conduct of members of the order.

Harkas is a strong believer in the importance of regular quests,

and  he  regularly  calls  upon  younger  Knights  of  Samular  to

handle reports of evil doings in the wilds of the North.

Among  the  Knights,  Harkas  is  closest  with  Lord  Morus

Brokengulf II, whom he regards as a son and protg. Harkas

has somewhat strained relations with Hykros Allumen, believing

that the Hammer Lords prejudices blind him to the greater

glory of Tyr. Of course, Harkas himself has failed to notice the

seed of evil now staining the order, embodied in his right-hand

man, Sir Gareth Cormaeril.

Morus Brokengulf II: By the age of 16, Lord Morus (LG

male Illuskan human paladin 4, Hand of Tyr* feat) was a paladin

and Tyrran zealot, cutting off his own right hand in sacri ce to

Tyr and devoting himself to the teachings of Harkas Kormallis.

After roaming the Sword Coast for years, doing good in Tyrs

name, the death of the elder Lord Morus I forced Morus II

to return to Waterdeep and assume the mantle of patriarch.

After several months of frustration, the new Lord Morus II

turned over day-to-day operation of the family business to his

close friend, Sir Gareth Cormaeril, Exchequer of the Knights

of Samular, so that he could once again sally forth against the

evils of the North in the name of Tyr. Lord Morus II returns

to  Waterdeep  periodically,  but  now  spends  most  of  his  time

away,  battling  evil  monsters  and  hunting  Old  Gnawbones,  a

long-standing enemy of the family.

Renwick Snowcloak Caradoon: Renwick (LN male archlich

[augmented Illuskan human] wizard 14/arcane devoteePG 5 [Tyr])

is  the  elder  brother  of  Amphail  the  Just  and  the  legendary

Samular. Centuries ago, he engineered the founding of the Holy

Order of Samular and then retreated into undeath and seclusion.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

The Guardian of the Order has hidden for centuries in his old

tower in Summit Hall, awaiting a descendant of Samular to

claim the third of the rings of Samular. Although Bronwyn

Caradoon (see page 74) brie y united the rings and Kezefbane,

Renwicks long-laid plans are blocked once again by her decision

to divide the rings among the Knights of Samular, the church

of Cyric, and the Harpers, and to hide Kezefbane away again

in a location unknown to Renwick (in Blackstaff Tower).

Gareth Cormaeril: Sir Gareth (CE male Chondathan human

paladin 7/blackguard 5, Veil of Cyric* feat) is a tall, well-

made man in vigorous late life distantly related to the

now exiled Cormyrian noble house of the same name.

He wears his white hair in precise waves and has bright

blue eyes. Although he retired from active service in

the Knights of Samular over three decades ago, thanks

to a grievous wound that left him with a withered

right arm, Sir Gareth has continued to serve the

order for many years as Exchequer of the Knights

and the senior paladin of the order based in

Waterdeep at the Halls of Justice (C5).

Unbeknownst to his fellow knights, or

indeed anyone other than Malchior and

Dag Zoreth of Darkhold, Sir Gareth fell

away from the faith of Tyr decades ago after

saving the life of Hronrulf Caradoon at the cost

of his arm. It was Gareth who sold the location

of Hronrulfs children to the Zhentarim in the

Year of the Spur (1348 DR), and it was Gareth

who nearly engineered the assemblage of the rings

of Samular and Kezefbane in the hands of Dag

Zoreth, a priest of Cyric.

Sir Gareth has never admitted even to himself

that he no longer follows the teachings of Tyr,

constructing  elaborate  rationalizations  and

falling back on willful ignorance to justify his

actions  to  himself  and  others.  Nevertheless,

he continues to follow the lead of Malchior

of Darkhold and fund his activities, claiming

to Dag Zoreth, for example, that Whatever

else he might be, Malchiors a scholar and most

knowledgeable in the lore and history of the order.

Therefore, it is right and  tting that some of the

orders monies support his work. I have no  rsthand

knowledge that these funds were used in any other manner. The

fallen paladin never explicitly lies, but often omits inconvenient

truths or misleads others.

ORDER OF THE EVEN-HANDED

The  Order  of  the  Even-Handed  is  a  local  monastic  order

dedicated  to  Tyr.  The  orders  small  chapterhouse  sits  on  the

slopes of Mount Waterdeep, overlooking Smugglers Bay. Due

to longstanding philosophical differences between Grand Master

Hlam and Hammer Lord Hykros Allumen (Hykros believes

Hlams mixing of cleric and monk traditions to be heresy), the

order has closer ties with the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter

than it does with the clergy of Waterdeeps Tyrran temple, going

so far as to send its tithes to the City of Skilled Hands.

49

Hlam, Grand Master of the Even-Handed, has long dwelled in

a small cave partway up the eastern slopes of Mount Waterdeep.

Over the years, as he trained a succession of younger monks

who found their way to his cave, Hlam developed a monastic

discipline that he called the Way of the Sacred Fists, giving equal

weight to cleric magic and monk training. In recent years, his

students organized themselves into a monastic order, one that

taught both individual self-reliance and a duty to bring justice

to the world. With the assistance of Piergeiron, Hlams disciples

purchased an aging manor near their masters cave to serve as

the orders chapter house.

Although Hlam has always preferred to adventure alone,

most of the younger members of the order seek out companies

of fair-minded adventurers of varied skills, as opposed to

journeying with other members of the order. However,

it is a goal for every member of the order to have one

grand solo adventure in the service of the Grimjaws

before they die. Most also seek to battle and defeat

a Helmite monk in ritual combat.

the Ten Black Days and found his calling as a monk in the service

of Tyr in the wilds of the Savage Frontier. He is of slight build

and middling height, but he is incredibly  t. Hlam keeps his

head and face completely shaved, favoring simple tunics and a

ritual blindfold of thin white gauze. The Grand Master has little

involvement in the order he nominally leads, but he looks with

great favor on the efforts of his student to extend his teachings,

seeing it as the will of Tyr.

Church of Umberlee

Although the Bitch Queen is given more than her due in the City

of Splendors during the annual donations to Umberlees Cache

(see page 120), the church of Umberlee has never been strong

in the City of Splendors. The Bitch Queens of cial emissary to

Waterdeep is usually a priest based in Stormhaven House on

Orlumbor, charged with overseeing the Fleetswake ceremonies

and observing which ships pay proper homage to the Bitch Queen

upon departing Deepwater Harbor.

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), Dread High Trident

Meritid Archneie discovered a magic abalone shell  oating in the

harbor, which he believed to be the legendary Orglara, a sacred

text of the Bitch Queen. Seeing this as a good omen, Meritid

promptly petitioned the Lords to use half the annual tithe to

construct a temple to the Bitch Queen atop a large outcropping

of rock near the end of the large sandbar that extends south of

the citys South Gate. Without explanation, the Lords agreed to

his unlikely request, and construction was begun on the azure-

hued  Queenspire  (H5).  Now,  after  many  years  of  work,  the

Queenspire is  nally nearing completion, and Meritid has sent

out a call far and wide for Umberlants to join him in worshiping

the Queenspire in the lee of Mount Waterdeep.

Base of Operations: The Queenspire (H5).

Church  of  Umberlee  (Minor  Religious):  AL  CE;  15,000  gp

resource limit; Membership 24; Isolated (humans 18, merfolk

4, weresharksMF 2); Dues 20 gp/month (none to join).

Associated  Classes:  Adept,  cleric,  druid,   ghter,  ranger,

rogue.

Associated  Skills:  Concentration,  Intimidate,  Knowledge

(religion), Profession (sailor), Spellcraft, Swim.

Requirements: You must uphold the tenets of Umberlees faith

and spend an average of 10 hours per tenday ensuring that ships

leaving harbor placate Umberlee before they set out.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Umberlee rewards your

faith and service by stretching forth her hand to smite your

enemies. Once per character level, you can call on her power

to  gain  a  +5  profane  bonus  on  a  single  attack  roll  or  spell

penetration check.

Special: The church of Umberlee requires members to be true

adherents of the Bitch Queen with a demonstrable understanding

of the churchs teachings (4 ranks in Knowledge [religion]).

The ranks of the priesthood are made up primarily of clerics,

but all divine spellcasters are welcome.

Senior members of the church sometimes take up the wa-

veservantFP prestige class.

Fences and Smugglers

Although the assassin, drug, poison, and slave trades of Water-

deep are largely con ned to Skullport, the City of Splendors is

home to a fair share of illegal commerce. There is a large resale

market for purloined goods, many of which are stolen in one

ward, sold in another, and then displayed prominently by their

new owners in a third. Some of the known fences and dealers in

contraband of Waterdeep are described below.

Balthorr the Bold Olaskos: Balthorr (N male Tethyrian

rogue 8) is a hearty, loud-voiced, bubbling fellow with a ready

smile and  rm handshake. He is an expert on the currency,

uniforms, and badges used by most realms of Faern, and he can

make up colorful stories about the history of particular items

on the spot. He owns Balthorrs Rare and Wondrous Treasures

(C14) offering a wide selection of curios. Balthorrs apparent

honesty is belied by his willingness to purchase coins, gems, and

regalia with no questions asked, although if he suspects an item

is hot he offers only 40% of market value. Balthorr has long

been a spy for the Shadow Thieves, and, now that the guild has

returned to Waterdeep, he has grown increasingly involved in

their affairs.

Ildar the Duke of Darkness Orsabbas: Orsabbas (CE male

Tethyrian expert 5) is stout, fun loving, and slightly pompous.

He is the owner of Orsabbass Fine Imports (T17), a shop stocked

with odd items from far across Faern. Known as the Duke of

Darkness for the masked, sinister guise he wears during nobles

feasts, he enjoys making threats, dancing, and seduction while

in costume. Ildar goes to such feasts in part to examine the

tapestries, wines, and perfumes, for he specializes in fencing such

items, paying 30% of the value. Ildar buys such items with no

questions asked, earning him the nickname the Fingers, but

his price always drops dramatically if he recognizes the item

as stolen or hot.

Orlpar Husteem: Orlpar (CE male Chondathan aristocrat

1/rogue 6) is the bored, thrill-seeking, cunning younger brother

of Lord Orbos. From his house (N59) on Golden Serpent Street,

Orlpar deals in spices, scents, wines, and drugs, purchasing goods

at 50% of their market value, and selling them at a tidy pro t

to jaded young scions of the nobility. He occasionally deals in

large and unique thefts that have the town buzzing. Orlpar can be

reached through his employee, a neer-do-well hanger-on named

Hala Myrt (NE female Tethyrian commoner 1) who frequents

the Grinning Lion (N56). She arranges meetings with Orlpar

at the Grinning Lion and then delivers the goods herself at a

later time (when Orlpar has a convenient alibi).

Orlpar has long had an arms-length relationship with the

Xanathar Thieves Guild. In recent years, however, that relation-

ship has grown much closer, allowing Orlpar to corner the market

on haunspeir, mordayn powder, and tekkil with the guilds quiet

backing. (All three of these substances are detailed in Lords of

Darkness.) Orlpars vaults are guarded by a death tyrant and the

wizard Helmyn Faunspiel (CN male Illuskan wizard 9), whom

Orlpar keeps well supplied with haunspeir and mordayn powder.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Orlpars cellars link to the citys sewers and, in recent years have

become something of a safe house for the Xanathar Thieves

Guild (see Agents of the Eye, page 64).

Phalantar Orivan: Phalantar (NE male Chondathan human

rogue 7, Snake BloodPG feat) is a native of far-off Hlondeth, with

dark olive skin, a shaved head, a manicured black beard, and a

gentle smile. The owner of Phalantars Philtres & Components

(C33) always smiles gently and moves smoothly and quietly. He

sells exotic medicines, spices, herbs, and rare substances used in the

making of perfumes, scented oils, poisons, and spell components.

Phalantar deals with adventurers and arcane spellcasters regularly

and is fabulously rich. He buys magic items, no questions asked,

at 40% of the market value. Finally, Phalantar sponsors adven-

turing bands in return for a share of their loot (substances he

can sell in his shop) and bankrolls some Sword Coast mercenary

companies in exchange for a share of their pro t and plunder.

Guilds and Merchants

Economic  activity  in  Waterdeep  has  been  dominated  by  the

citys guilds for more than one hundred years. Their manage-

ment and skilled control of commerce has brought Waterdeep

to its current prominence as the premier center for trade on the

Sword Coast. Although their avarice, ruthlessness, and greed have

nearly destroyed Waterdeep twice in the past, the guilds have also

brought the city great prosperity. The Lords must recognize all

guilds, and applications for guild formation are rarely granted.

No new guild can overlap the provenance of an existing guild

because the Lords prefer that competition exist within guilds

rather than between them.

Guilds  have  widely  varying  degrees  of  in uence,  but  no

of cial precedence. The guilds are rarely if ever united. They

constantly ally with and strive against rival guilds, prominent

noble houses, established trading costers, and the Lords them-

selves.  Some  guilds  work  closely  with  the  Lords,  providing

essential  city  services,  while  others  are  specialty  guilds  that

wield in uence only in the Market.

All  guilds  have  a  guildhall,  which  acts  as  a  headquarters,

showcase, meeting place, central clearinghouse for guild business,

of ces of the guild of cers, and (sometimes) place of business.

Within a guild, individual ranks vary, but usually they include

the following: Master, Elders, or Council; senior members;

and Apprentice or Prentice or Novice. Guild law, the rules under

which speci c trades are conducted, are distinct from city law,

but they can never con ict with or override city law or the intent

of such laws. Guilds can never restrict all trade to themselves;

the  Lords  are  adamant  in  enforcing  the  right  of  merchants

and tradesfolk to operate outside the strictures of the guilds if

they  prefer.  Obviously,  guilds  cannot  be  held  accountable  for

such persons, and tradesfolk operating outside the guilds are not

entitled to guild rights and privileges.

The current roster of Waterdhavian guilds (and guildhalls)

includes the following establishments.

Bakers Guild (C27)

Carpenters, Roofers, & Plaisterers Guild (S2)

Cellarers & Plumbers Guild (T26)

Coopers Guild (D31)

Guild Masters

Some  of  the  citys  most  notable  guildmasters  include  the

following individuals.

Maxeene  Rhiosann:  Maxeene  (NG  human  Tethyrian

human expert 12), Lady Voice of the Council of Musicians,

Instrument-Makers,  &  Choristers,  is  a  large  woman  given

to  voluminous  robes  and  dazzling,  upswept  sculptures  of

hair. Her voice is thought to give praise to Milil with every

note, and she is legendary across the city for the hours-long

performances  she  gives  at  intimate  gatherings  of  cultured

nobles. Since the death of Kriios Halamabar in the middle

of  his  eleventh  term  of  of ce,  Maxeene  has  served  as  the

Councils interim Master Musician and will continue to do

so until the next election in the Year of the Haunting (1377

DR). Because Maxeene has publicly stated that she has no

desire to hold that of ce, there is now widespread jockeying

among the leading musicians of the city for position, leading

to barely submerged tensions within the Council and within

the leadership of New Olamn.

Hilithiimm  Turnstone:  Hilithiimm  (CG  male  Tethyrian

human  expert  14),  the  Master  Plumber  of  the  Cellarers  &

Plumbers Guild and owner of Turnstone Plumbing and Pipe t-

ting (D2), is a middle-aged, balding man with ample girth and a

ready laugh who has the trust of the Lords, the watch, and the

nobility. He has led the guild responsible for digging building

foundations  and  keeping

the  sewers  of  the  city

functional  and  safe

for  many  years,  a  job

he  hopes  to  one  day

turn  over  to  his  son,

Jhalossan  Turnstone

(LG  male  Tethyrian

human expert 9). The

Turnstones are legend-

ary for their discretion,

for  in  the  course  of

their duties they have

learned many secrets of

the city that the Lords

and powerful merchant

families  do  not  want

revealed. Unbeknownst

to  anyone,  including

his son, Hilithiimm is

now the enslaved thrall

of NexilVendyliq, one

of the Savants of the

Dark  Tide  (see  page

57),  whom  he  visits

regularly  to  have  his

enslavement  renewed.

The aboleth allows Hi-

lithiimm to act as he

would  normally  with

the  notable  exception

of  steering  away  con-

tingents  of  Cellarers

from the aboleth-ruled

portions of the sewers.

Arnagus the Shipwright: Arnagus (LG

male  human  expert  10)  is  a  strong,  vital  man  with  broad

shoulders, a beaming smile, a ruddy, clean-shaven complexion,

and a healthy shock of long, white hair approaching 65 years

in age. While not of noble blood, he grooms himself well and

dresses in expensive  nery. He is genuinely friendly with ev-

eryone he meets, but he often has little to sayeven to friends

hes known for years. Arnagus is the wealthiest shipbuilder in

Waterdeep, with the best reputation and prices to match. He is

very in uential within the Order of Master Shipwrights, and

he is a skilled haggler and trader as well. He keeps a sharp eye

on goings-on near his docks, often aiding the City Watch in

their investigations.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Rhazbos  Redbridle:  Rhazbos  (CG  male  Illuskan  human

 ghter  6/expert  3),  a  former  mercenary  and  experienced

caravan master, is now a stout, jolly man of advancing years, too

busy (and fat) to take to the road on adventures any more. He

makes his living breeding and training horses in Waterdeep, and

he is now a ranking member of the Stablemasters & Farriers

Guild. He also owns and operates a large and successful stable

(S4). Rhazbos was once an adventurer, and he might take up

to two tendays (at the most) off to tutor  ghters if they offer

him enough monetary in-

centive, including meals,

and  have  a  place  (for

example, a comfortable

private house) where he

can stay.

The  Lords  of  Water-

deep  have  ruled  the

city for most of the last

three centuries. During

that period, there have

been  between  fifty

and  eighty  Lords  of

Waterdeep,  of  whom

four  reigned  as  Open

Lord:  Ahghairon  the

Mage, Baeron Silmaeril,

Lhestyn  the  Masked

Lady,  and  Piergeiron

the  Paladinson.  The

Lords  of  Waterdeep

have been drawn from

all  walks  of  life,  from

noble  to  dungsweeper,

and  from  merchant  to

cleric. Although most of

the Lords of Waterdeep

have been human, they have included elves, half-

elves, and hal ings among their number.

Hilithiimm Turnstone visits his master

Of all the Lords selected by Ahghairon or his successors, only

one, Kerrigan the Arcanist, has abused his position. Kerrigan,

through various subterfuges and hired agents, killed three of

his fellow Lords before Ahghairon discovered his treason. The

resultant spell battle crossed the city before ending in Temple

(now Southern) Ward with the death of the traitorous Lord.

The penalty for impersonating a Lord is immediate execu-

tion. On those occasions when a Lord appears to be about in

the  city  in  full  regalia,  of cers  of  the  guard  or  watch  alert

Piergeiron at once, for the Open Lord can demand that any

Lord unmask himself or herself at his command. Failure to

do so is also punishable by death. It is not uncommon for those

seeking  to  improve  their  standing,  socially  or  economically,

to claim to be a Lord. This is a dangerous practice, however,

for if the perpetrator is caught in the lie, such claims are also

punishable by death.

The Open Lord of Waterdeep, currently Piergeiron the Pala-

dinson, holds the titles of Warden of Waterdeep (commander of

the guard), Overmaster of the Guilds, and Commander of the

Watch. He or she is the only Lord whose face is exposed and

known to the public, and he serves as the citys chief diplomat.

Although no other Lord is ever formally named, some individu-

als become the subject of widespread rumor or general consensus.

Mirt the Moneylender, Larissa, and Texter are generally men-

tioned as prospects, and, until his apparent resignation, Khelben

was generally agreed to be a Lord. (In truth, Khelben remains

a Lord, although his resignation was genuine, if brief.)

Many of the Lords of Waterdeep are detailed below. The rest

are left to the DM to develop as be ts his or her campaign.

Piergeiron the Paladinson: Open Lord Piergeiron (LG male

Tethyrian human paladin 17 [Tyr]) is a tall, muscular, handsome

man of quiet con dence, poise, and patience. His hair is only

slightly graying at the temples, despite his increasing years. The

Paladinson speaks so seldom and slowly that he has acquired

the nickname (never to his face) of the Thickskull. Piergeiron

is not stupid, but often pretends to be, so draw others out into

admissions they might not make otherwise. The Paladinson is

the son of Athar, the Shining Knight, who was famed for

slaying the great wyrm Kistarianth the Red.

Despite the many challenges of his tenure, Piergeiron has

remained  above  reproach,  ably  administering  the  city  and

ensuring the rule of law. As such, the Paladinson is very safe

from those who wish the city to  ourish and a frequent target

of attack by those who wish Waterdeep ill. Piergeiron dwells in

the Palace of Waterdeep (C75), commonly known as Piergeirons

Palace,  ever  shadowed  by  his  personal  bodyguard,  Madeiron

Sunderstone (see page 34).

Piergeirons wife Maethiira died in the Year of the Moonfall

(1344 DR), and the couple had only one child. Aleena Paladinstar

(LG female Tethyrian wizard 7/arcane devoteePG 4 [Tyr]) has been

absent from the city for several years, having taken to planewalk-

ing to see new worlds. Some say she might someday succeed her

father when his reign as Open Lord comes to an end.

Khelben  Blackstaff  Arunsun  the  Elder:  Khelben  (LN

male human [Chosen of Mystra] wizard 24/archmage 3) is fully

detailed  on  page  274  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign

Setting, updated in Epic Level Handbook (page 299). Khelben

dwells in Blackstaff Tower (C6).

Kyriani Agrivar: Kyriani Agrivar (N female half-drowRac

wizard 11/Moonstar agent 3) is a recent addition to the Lords

of Waterdeep.  For details about her, see page 87.

Brian the Swordmaster: Brian (NG male Illuskan human

 ghter 4/expert 16) is a gray-eyed bald man, with a black

beard streaked with gray and a penchant for scowling. His

years at the forge and as an armar of the guard have left him

with a powerful build. Brian is a skilled swordsmith, the best in

the city, and a master armorer. He crafts items of lasting beauty,

durability, and exquisite workmanship. Much like Kitten, he

is known for his simple, direct way of looking at things. He is

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

similar in outlook to Mirt, Durnan and Nindil, capable of seeing

weak points in plans and foreseeing problems long before they

occur. Brian dwells above his smithy (S7).

Brianne Byndraeth: Brianne (CG female Chondathan human

sorcerer 12) is the widow of Carril Byndraeth, a crime lord and

former Lord of Waterdeep murdered nearly two decades ago

by a black wyrm in human form seeking the return of its eye.

Brianne herself is a Lord of Waterdeep, and the rift between

Brianne  and  Carril,  before  his  death,  nearly  split  the  Lords

into two factions. After Carrils death, Brianne played the role

of  respectable  Waterdhavian  widow,  courted  by  a  long  string

of men seeking to marry into wealth (and secretly of interest

to the Lords). Now, after many years of looking, Brianne has

 nally been engaged to Randulaith of Mirabar (see page 65), a

charming wizard who moves easily among the citys social elite.

Brianne has a tower (N75) within the city proper but also lives

in Carrils old estate outside the city.

Caladorn Cassalanter: Caladorn (NG male Tethyrian human

 ghter 13) stands six feet tall, with short brown hair, a clean-

shaven face, and a prominent cleft in his chin. This young gallant

is often sardonic, very perceptive, and intelligent. He is quite fun

loving when he can  nd an occasion to abandon his customary

serious resolve in private. He is the third son of Lord Ohrl Cas-

salanter, but has chosen to drop the family name until he does

something worthy of it. His father has come to suspect that

Caladorn will never consider himself worthy, leaving him the

privileges of the nobility without having to answer to the family

patriarch. The Cassalanters are unaware that their restless scion

is actually a Lord of Waterdeep. In recent years, Caladorn has

taken an increasing interest in Waterdeeps navy, posing as a bored

young noble who could lend an extra swordarm to a raker on

patrol. This has left him uniquely positioned among the Lords

to understand the challenges Waterdeep faces in maintaining its

hegemony on the Sea of Swords. Caladorn lives in a row house

in Castle Ward (C71).

Durnan  the  Wanderer:  Durnan  (NG  male  Illuskan

 ghter 18) is a gruff, burly, russet-haired man, close-mouthed

and prudent. He hates unfairness and injustice, but is tolerant

of the differing interests of othersat least until they un-

sheathe a weapon in his inn, whereupon he draws his longsword

on the spot.

Durnan  is  a  retired   ghter  born  in  the  remote  North

who  spent  his  youth  wandering  the  Savage  Frontier,  bat-

tling monsters and their ilk. He is an old friend of Mirt the

Moneylender, and the duo were the  rst in modern times to

explore Undermountain, emerging in the Year of the Broken

Helm (1302 DR) as rich men. While Mirt used share of their

plunder  to  purchase  his  mansion  on  the  southern  slopes  of

Mount Waterdeep, Durnan built an inn, the Yawning Portal

(C48) over the ruins of Halasters long-vanished tower and now

dwells there with his wife, Mhaere Dryndilstann (see page 40),

and their daughter. As overseer of the primary open route into

Undermountain, secret Lord of Waterdeep, and secret leader of

the Red Sashes (see page 74), Durnan  nds himself involved

in most events of import to affect the City of Splendors, a

role for which he is well suited.

Nindil Jalbuck: Nindil (LN male lightfoot hal ing rogue

6/expert 4) stands some three feet high, sporting a distinctive

jet-black crewcut and golden nose ring. His common clothing

and  grocers  apron  do  little  to  disguise  the  knowing  look  of

a joker and mischief-maker in his sea-green eyes. Outside the

city, he dons a suit of chainmail emblazoned with the emblem

of Golden elds. At his core, Nindil is loyal, good-natured, and

trustworthy. He is slow to anger, only losing his temper when

talked down to.

Nindil  hales  from  Secomber,  having  come  to  Waterdeep

to make his fortune and survived through petty thievery and

pickpocketing. In time, he found work as a spy and broker of

underworld information. In time, Nindil turned aside from such

work and established the Garrulous Grocer (S37). He built a good

reputation with the city by providing food out of his pocket to

the many left homeless and destitute by the ravaging of Myrkuls

minions. Nearly a decade later, Nindil was selected to be a Lord.

He now speaks for the common folk of Waterdeep.

Six months ago, Nindil was killed and subsumed by Hlaavin,

the greater doppelgangerMF who leads the Unseen (see page 57).

Mather Ukkhemn of the Knights of the Shield (see page 74)

betrayed Nindils identity in a  t of pique for a healthy monetary

inducement. For now, Hlaavin is content to continue in Nindils

guise, doing nothing untoward to reveal his deception. However,

Hlaavin sees this victory as the  rst step of many in his long-

term plan to supplant the Lords of Waterdeep.

Mirt the Moneylender: Also known as Mirt the Merciless and

the Old Wolf, Mirt (CG male Tethyrian human  ghter 8/rogue

5)  is  fully  detailed  on  page  181  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign Setting. Mirts forti ed mansion (C52) sits on the

southern  ank of Mount Waterdeep above Smugglers Dock.

His wife, Asper, is an informal member of the Gray Hands (see

page 37).

Larissa Neathal: Larissa (NG female Chondathan expert 10)

is a human chameleon, capable with cosmetics and minor magics

of changing her hairstyle, hair color, eye color, and dress in the

wink of an eye. Her only constants are her distinctive necklace, a

gold  ligree phoenix rising from a cluster of inset rubies (periapt

of proof against poison), and her taste for extravagant, provocative

clothes. Larissa is a courtesan, playing a giggling, empty-headed

sex-kitten with all the visiting envoys and diplomats she has time

for, and gathering all the information for the Lords that she

can that way. When weary or upset, she leans on the shoulder

of her closest friend and con dante, Durnan the Wanderer. Her

capacity for court parties is legendary, and she can dance all day

and all night if necessary, without ill effects. Larissa keeps a

house on Mulgomirs Way (C77).

Nymara Kitten Scheiron: Kitten (NG female Tethyrian

human  rogue  12)  is  an  intensely  secretive  person  whose  full

name is known to few. This tousle-haired,  erce woman has a

savage temper and a lush, strong  gure that belies her years.

Although she can appear as a stunning, beautiful lady of high

station, she is more often found heavily perfumed and made-up,

posing as a Dock Ward tavern dancer. In less distinctive garb,

she is an expert at following people, often taking to the sewers

or rooftops when speed is of the essence.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Mirt and Durnan recruited this sometime thief more than

twenty- ve  years  ago  for  her  understanding  of  the  common

folk, and her practicality in uences the details of many actions

planned  by  the  Lords.  Among  her  fellow  Lords,  Kitten  is

closest  with  Mirt,  Durnan,  Larissa,  and  Khelben.  She  keeps

several residences scattered about the city, never staying in any

one of them for any length of time.

Sammereza Sammer Sulphontis: Sammereza el Sufontis

(N male Calishite human expert 15), who employs a variant of

his name in the North, is a slightly slimmer, slightly younger,

and far more polished version of Mirt. He keeps his brown skin

and hair meticulously groomed, and his purples eyes are quite

hypnotic. Sammereza is a sly, witty, iron-nerved, sometimes oily

wheeler-dealer with sharp eyes that miss nothing.

Sammereza hails from Calimshan but has made his home in

the City of Splendors for over thirty- ve years. He still favors

many layers of silk and extravagant robes, keeping comfortable

in northern climes with his ring of warmth, perhaps because he

spends so much time traveling. Sammereza will sell anything

to anyone, buy almost anything from anyone, and trade most

things with most people. When he is in the city, Sammereza

takes a room at the Purple Palace (D25).

In recent years, Sammereza has become increasingly tangled

in the affairs of his homeland. The recent death of Sammerezas

elder brother, Pasha Ahmahd el Sufontis of Calimports Trades

Ward,  and  the  subsequent  strife  among  Sammerezas  four

nephews  and  sister-in-law  have  nearly  bankrupted  the  family

fortunes. Moreover, Sammerezas simmering war with the el

Synabbat family (a front for the ruling el Pesarkhal family),

whose  machinations  in  Skullport  have  suffered  greatly  due

to  Sammerezas  interference,  is  threatening  to  erupt  anew.

Sammerezas sister-in-law, widow of Ahmahd, has just become

the second wife of the weak, craven Harun yn Bajir el Synabbat

(NE male Calishite human commoner 1), cementing her alli-

ance with Haruns  rst wife and Sammerezas primary enemy,

Saida yr Oma yr Pesarkhal el Synabbat (LE female Calishite

commoner 7). What began as Sammereza acting on behalf of

the Lords in Skullport might soon metastasize into a plague of

Calishite assassins pursing a blood vendetta against Sammereza

and anyone he associates with in the shadows of Waterdeep.

Texter: Texter (LG male Chondathan human paladin 20

[Tyr]) is a powerfully built, dutiful, pious holy warrior, with

a face ruddy and lined, a thick, brown mustache, and a stern,

distinguished  visage.  Fearless  but  never  stupid,  he  has  little

patience  for  ceremony,  preferring  such  activities  as  leading

guard  and  navy  patrols  to  the  cut-and-thrust  of  just-below-

the-surface politics. Texters vigilance has saved the city from

being surprised on more than one occasion, although he still

berates himself for the attacks he has missed. When he needs

to renew his commitment to the Maimed God, Texter rides

forth alone into the wilderness to battle orcs, trolls, and other

evil creatures. Texter has little respect for the cleric hierarchy

in the Halls of Justice, feeling they spend more time jockeying

for position than they do serving the will of Grimjaws. On

those rare occasions when he is not in the  eld, Texter dwells

at the Guard Barracks (C19).

Mercenaries

and Guides

The City of Splendors is home to countless  ghting-men, some

of them employed in the armed forces of Waterdeep and others

in the private militias of Waterdeeps nobility. A large underclass

of warriors intermittently inhabit Dock Ward and South Ward,

 nding rude accommodations until the next caravan, adventuring

company, or warmonger needs their services. Others  nd employ

as guides, leading nobles, adventuring companies, and caravans

into the North in hopes of reducing the danger of getting lost

or blundering into the territory of some monster.

A sampling of mercenaries and guides are detailed below:

Blazidon  One-Eye:  Blazidon  (CN  male  Tethyrian  human

 ghter  7/expert  2)  is  a  large,  stocky  man  with  graying  hair

and a patchy, unkempt beard. Although slightly overweight, his

many scars and thickly muscled shoulders and arms mark him

as a  ghter from days past. He still comes out of retirement

from time to time, but days are now occupied as a poor hiring

agent for sell-swords and (secret) owner of the Bowels of the

Earth tavern (T36), where he lives. Blazidon spends his nights

making the rounds of the citys inns and taverns, befriending

poor newcomers who might be willing to hire themselves out

as  ghters or guards. By day, he can be found, still armed to

the teeth, in Virgins Square$GS: on map?, where most caravan

masters know to  nd him. His fee is one copper piece per person

hired, and Blazidon will contact sell-swords for clients, bringing

them together to talk business in a little room of the taproom

of his tavern. Blazidon is one of the few people in the city who

dislikes Filiare of the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3), as the

two are rivals in the  eld of  nding jobs for hireswords.

Filiare: Filiare (LN male Illuskan human  ghter 5/expert

5) is a jovial, middle-aged man whose thinning black hair and

moustache are streaked with gray. Despite his years of retire-

ment from the  eld, Filiare has maintained the strong physique

that made him a highly paid mercenary all those decades ago.

Filiare used his earnings to purchase the Inn of the Dripping

Dagger (T3), now a favored home and watering place for many

mercenaries. He is a good, kind, considerate host, more than

willing to shave a few coppers off his prices for folks down on

their luck. Filiare supplements his income by selling used weapons

he keeps on hand (many given to him in lieu of payment by

down-on-their-luck  warriors)  and  he  competes  with  Blazidon

One-Eye to be the citys leading job- nder for hireswords.

Myrmith Splendon: Myrmith (LN male Tethyrian human

 ghter 12) is a handsome, clean-shaven man with light-brown,

curly hair, light-blue eyes, and a ragged scar across his forehead.

His build is light and disarming, but his strength is easily proven

in combat. He is always clad in chainmail with a black tabard,

alert and ready for action. Myrmith is a captain-at-arms (a

professional tutor of  ghters) who will train willing students in

the use of bladed weapons or pole arms. He does not specialize in

any particular weapon, but tries to master the greatest number of

weapons possible. His fees are steep, but his instruction excellent,

and there is often a waitlist of a tenday or more unless one is

willing to pay double. Myrmith lives in his house on Spindle

Street (T5) and he is always busy training clients there.

Aluar  Zendos:  Aluar  (CG  male  Tethyrian  human  ranger

6 [Mielikki]) is a quiet, unassuming man of muscular build, a

hawklike face, and an uncompromising hatred for evil creatures.

Aluar is a restless man who does not know what to do in life,

but feels his destiny lies with Waterdeep. He recently acquired a

singing swordMag, ful lling a long-held wish for a magic weapon,

but its unusual nature has led him  rst to New Olamn (C72) and

now to Those Who Harp and the beginnings of a new friendship

with Vedellen Hawkhand (NG male half-sun elf ranger 11).

Aluar keeps a room at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger (T3)

when in Waterdeep, but regularly makes the rounds of inns and

taverns in the Trades Ward. He will offer himself as a guide

or caravan-guard for 1 sp/day for any traveling as far north as

the mountains allow, as far east as Westgate, or as far south as

the cities of Amn. He will readily tutor other rangers as well

for 5 sp/day.

Monsters

The City of Splendors is home to a signi cant population of

monsters. Such creatures generally fall into three camps: those

that live openly among the folk of Waterdeep, those who prey on

the population like foxes in the henhouse, and those who play a

parasitic role within the City of Splendors. Most Waterdhavian

monsters are loners, at least with respect to their own kind,

but those who do work in concert from the shadows often wield

a great deal of hidden in uence in the city.

Dragons

Although  Ahghairons  dragonward  reduces  the  number  of

dragons living in the City of Splendors, many wyrms either live

within the mythals strictures or keep a close watch on Waterdeep.

Some of the more prominent representatives of dragonkind to

do so include the following individuals:

Claugiyliamatar: From her lair in Deeping Cave in the depths

of Kryptgarden Forest, Old Gnawbones schemes and watches

Waterdeep through an array of crystal balls. Claugiyliamatar is

fascinated by powerful human and elf females as well as magics

that enable a dragon to take on human form. She hungers to

participate in the hustle and bustle of city life, but she has not yet

found a way of doing so that preserves her personal security.

In  particular,  the  members  of  the  Brokengulf  family  seek

her death, for Old Gnawbones once posed as a silver dragon that

offered to rid the Brokengulf grazing lands of herself. When the

affair was over, Lord Saerlin Brokengulf was crippled, three of

his sisters were dead, the family nearly bankrupted, and a hastily

mustered Waterdhavian strike force had conveniently slain a young

male green dragon with designs on Claugiyliamatars domain.

Old  Gnawbones  employs  dozens  of  human  and  hal ing

agents to manipulate events in the City of Splendors. She also

indirectly sponsors adventuring companies, such as the dozen

highborn Waterdhavian ladies of the Bloodred Crown adventur-

ing company, which she discretely leads to ruins and tombs near

Waterdeep and Neverwinter. Old Gnawbones invests her earnings

so as to stir up rivalries and strengthen organizations she controls

to create more trouble and squeeze out more pro ts.

Base of Operations: Basement of the Wyrmbones Inn (C78).

Gnawbones  (Minor  Criminal):  AL  NE,  LE,  N;  3,000  gp

resource  limit;  Membership  40  (half  in  Waterdeep,  half  in

dragon  rogue  4/druid  4);  Delgar  of  the  Emerald  Blade  (LE

male half-green dragon Illuskan human  ghter 8, Neverwintan

mercenary lord); Lady Hylla Eirontalar (NE female Tethyrian

human aristocrat 4/rogue 12, Waterdhavian noble).

Important Characters: Red Scrag (N male Illuskan human

commoner  11,  Neverwintan  harbormaster);  Jingles  (NE

female lightfoot hal ing rogue 8, Waterdhavian cutpurse).

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert,  ghter, ranger, rogue.

Associated Skills: Appraise, Bluff, Disguise, Gather Informa-

tion, Knowledge (local), Use Magic Device.

Requirements: You may not divulge secrets of the society to

outsiders, and must obey the orders of your superiors.

Favored  in  Guild  Fringe  Bene t:  You  know  where  to  get

things. Once every character level, you can purchase any good

or service for just 75% of its actual price as long as you are in

Waterdeep or Neverwinter.

Special: All members of the society must be able to speak

Draconic.

Jalanvaloss: The Wyrm of Many Spells (LN female mature

adult steel dragon) hides amid the citizenry of Waterdeep in the

shape of a female human, revealing herself only to savagely  ght

off any dragon who dares try to do her city harm. She is a keen

observer of the smallest detail who revels in participating in as

many intrigues and deceptions as possible. An actress of the  rst

rank and an adequate mimic, she enjoys manipulating others and

scheming. She has become expert in recalling the genealogies,

relationships, cabals, and alliances of Waterdhavians high and low.

She is active in the city underlife but also enjoys the entertainment

provided by the pretensions and indulgences of its nobles.

Nymmurh:  The  Wyrm  Who  Watches  (LG  male  ancient

bronze dragon) has scryed the Silmerhelve family (apparently

chosen at random in centuries past) through magic mirrors and

portraits that can also act as temporary portals since at least the

Year of the Nightmaidens (1032 DR). Fascinated by humans

predictability and unpredictability, Nymmurh tries to manipulate

the Silmerhelves to be kinder, gentler, and slower to act before

consequences are considered. He usually reveals himself to one

Silmerhelve  family  member  per  generation,  while  the  others

regard him as mere family legend. Nymmurh protects the family

against attacks from without and within, but does not watch over

every wayward family member out seeking his fortune. He likes to

attend family revels, sometimes appearing as a long-dead family

member returned from the grave (usually the mumbling-mad

Lady Saerista Silmerhelve, who dwells comfortably in the dragons

lair). Nymmurhs lair, which he calls the Pit, lies in the high

peaks of Alaron in the Moonshaes. He is known to have taught

at least some Silmerhelves the spell jumpgout*.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

The Plague Rats

Waterdeeps dark underbelly has long been home to wererats, a

lycanthropic plague that the Lords have never wholly eradicated.

In recent years, as the number of threats occupying the Lords

has grown, the wererat population has grown in number to its

highest point in decades. Concurrent with this population growth,

the rodent lycanthropes have been assimilated into the Plague

Rats,  an  elite  organization  of  thieves,  assassins,  and  wererats

active throughout the Western Heartlands and the North and

dedicated to Talona, the Mistress of Disease.

In Waterdeep, the Plague Rats largely operate in Dock Ward

and the sewers under cover of darkness, although they perform

clandestine missions anywhere in the city for hire. Currently, the

group is focused on expanding their ranks and extending their

reach into every aspect of Dock Wards seamier side. Ironically,

only  the  burgeoning  power  of  the  Shadow  Thieves  and  the

Xanathar Thieves Guild is keeping the Plague Rats in check.

Base of Operations: The Rats Maw of the Rat Hills, Deloun

Alley (see page 113), and Skullport.

Plague Rats (Expansive Criminal): AL LE, NE; 40,000 gp

Special: All members must choose Talona as their patron

deity and demonstrate a knack for stealth and skullduggery (2

ranks in Hide).

Savants of the Dark Tide

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), a wave of monsters

from  the  depths  of  the  Sea  of  Swords  swept  into  Waterdeep

Harbor,  nearly  overrunning  the  defenders  of  Dock  Ward.

Among  their  number  were  a  dozen  or  so  aboleths,  most  of

whom were slain during the Deepwater War. However, among

their number was a trio of aboleths from the Swordsea Depths

who joined the Army of Iakhovas with the deliberate intent of

using the assault to sneak into Waterdeeps sewers. During the

chaos and confusion, the Savants of the Dark Tide swam into

foulest heart of the sewer, where they have since established a

nigh-impregnable lair.

The Swordsea Depths are the region of the Underdark that

extends out into the continental shelf beneath the Sea of Swords.

As described in UM L6: The Seadeeps (see page 128), this region

of the Underdark is wracked by a never-ending three-way war

between the aboleths, the drow, and an alliance of svirfneblin

and  tomb  tappersMF.  The  Savants  of  the  Dark  Tide  came  to

Waterdeep in pursuit of an ancient legend in hopes of gaining a

decisive advantage in that war. If the Savants of the Dark Tide

can locate and resuscitate the Sargauth Swimmer (a legendary

aboleth of enormous size and age rumored to lie dreaming in

the Sargauth River), the knowledge it possesses might tip the

balance in their interminable war.

Since  their  arrival,  the  aboleths  have  moved  cautiously,

seeking to understand the city above their heads before moving

into the depths. The Savants quickly determined that the only

organized activity in the sewers was performed by members of

the Cellarers & Plumbers Guild. As such, individual rogues and

others who will not be missed are captured and transformed into

skum, whenever possible; however, guild members are enslaved

and instructed to stay away from certain parts of the sewers and

to stay within the city of Waterdeep, but they are otherwise left

to do their jobs. By using already enslaved members to lure more

senior members of the guild, the aboleths have thus enslaved

the entire leadership of the guild as well.

Base of Operations: Drain of Madness (SF77).

Savants of the Dark Tide (Standard Criminal): AL LE; 15,000

gp resource limit; Membership 86; Isolated (aboleths 3, skum 45,

charmed others 38); Dues 0 gp/month (0 gp to join).

Authority  Figure:  NexilVendyliq  (LE  advanced  18  HD

HD  aboleth  sorcerer  6/aboleth  savantLM  4);  InkylDeskiloop

(NE advanced 13 HD aboleth bard 8/aboleth savantLM 1).

Special:  Membership  in  this  organization  is  involuntary,

except for the aboleths. Skum are transformed slaves, and all

other members are enslaved proxies of their piscine masters.

The Unseen

The Unseen is a consortium of shapechangers, thieves, illusionists,

and assassins that has been growing in strength and numbers

in Waterdeep for nearly three decades. The Unseen began as

a druuth (a band of doppelgangers led by illithids), tasked to

in ltrate and spy on the City of Splendors for the Underdark

city of ChChitl. The death of the elder brain of the Kingdom

Below forced the druuth to operate largely on its own, enabling

a greater doppelgangerMF named Hlaavin to emerge as the leader

of the now-autonomous band.

Aside from the creation of the Waterdeep-based wilora (see

page  141),  the  successes  of  the  Unseen  are  largely  unknown,

but failures and setbacks include the death of Flaern Cragsmere

during a failed attempt to in ltrate that family, the Rat Hills

Con agration (which drove the doppelgangers wholly into the

city),  and  the  unmasking  of  the  Hanging  Lantern  festhall

(D22) when the infamous Volothamp Geddarm revealed that

the courtesans were doppelgangers. Despite these setbacks, the

Unseen  nally appear poised to achieve true power in the City

of Splendors, having  nally placed one of their own in the ranks

of the Lords of Waterdeep, and having learned the identity of

the One, leader of the Red Sashes.

Base of Operations: Formerly the Hanging Lantern (D22),

now secret rooms within the Dungeon of the Crypt, the sewers,

and Skullport.

leucrotta*); Necrom Regescar (LE male lightfoot hal ing rogue

9);  Synyl  (appears  to  be  a  CE  doppelganger,  see  Nylaersyn

the Changeling Floshin below); Tomas Siohcen (see page 38);

Uhkra (NE changesteed leucrotta*); Lasster Vhenlok (CE male

Tethyrian human  ghter 7).

Associated  Classes:  Bard,  druid,   ghter,  ranger,  rogue,

sorcerer, wizard.

Associated  Skills:  Bluff,  Disguise,  Escape  Artist,  Hide,

Knowledge (dungeoneering), Sense Motive.

Requirements: Do not divulge the secrets of the brotherhood

to any outsiders.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Due to your long associa-

tion with many shapechangers, you gain a +2 bonus on Spot

and Sense Motive checks made to see through a Disguise or

Bluff attempt.

Special:  Any  creature  with  the  shapechanger  subtype  can

join, regardless of character class (or lack thereof). If you are

not a shapechanger, you must demonstrate skill in deception and

subterfuge (2 ranks in Bluff and 2 ranks in Disguise) or have

the ability to alter your form magically (alter self, polymorph,

wild shape, or similar spells or abilities).

The  Unseen  are  primarily,  but  not  exclusively,  made  up  of

creatures with the shapechanger subtype.

Amarune: Amarune (CE malaugrymMF sorcerer 5) has long

been  absent  from  Shadowhome,  the  fortress  of  the  Blood  of

Malaug on the Plane of Shadow, fearing death from her kin for

some long-forgotten sin if she is ever discovered. Amarune has

posed as Nael Irlingstar for over three decades, eschewing the

plots of her kin and living quietly among Waterdeeps nobility,

in accordance with the Dark Decree of the Great Shadowmaster

Dhalgrave. The death of her daughter Sintre left House Irlingstar

without a direct heir and Amarune alone with the magic baubles

she had acquired. Two years ago, Hlaavin, who somehow discov-

ered her deception, abruptly confronted Amarune and gave her

the choice of joining the Unseen or being exposed for what she

was. Amarune has reluctantly begun supplying the Unseen with

funds purloined from House Irlingstars coffers and magic she

has accumulated. The shadowmaster secretly burns with hatred

for the doppelganger, and, as Hlaavin fully expects, intends to

betray the greater doppelganger at the  rst opportunity.

Nylaersyn  the  Changeling  Floshin:  Nylaersyn  (CE

female feyriMF sorcerer 6) is a member of House Dlardrageth

who has adopted the guise of a doppelganger, allowing her

to in ltrate the Unseen in the guise of Synyl. In the guise

of  Synyl,  Nylaersyn  has  also  adopted  the  guise  of  several

Waterdhavians: Biafyndar Loceath (CG male gold elf), an

initiate of Corellon Larethian at the Pantheon Temple of the

Seldarine (C66), Hragnor Splitstone (male Illuskan human),

a  etcher at Riautars Weaponry (T18), and Tymaara Moon-

smile (CG female half-moon elf), a waitress at the Elfstone

Tavern (C32).

Gonehl: Gonehl (CE doppelganger), in the guise of Aquila

Gerallin, leads the Masquerade. This shadowy group acts out-

side of Waterdeep as the information network and mercenary

arm  of  the  Unseen  and  includes  more  than  one  hundred

members  specialized  in  in ltration,  spying,  and  poisoning.

As they are reasonably honorable and seem to have no dark,

hidden motives, few suspect that the Masquerade is actually

an arm of the Unseen.

Hlaavin:  Hlaavin  (NE  half-illithidUnd  greater  doppel-

gangerMF sorcerer 9) is the driving force behind the Unseen,

a greater doppelganger who lacks the self-centered, cowardly

nature common to most doppelgangers and their ilk. Hlaavin

is a master manipulator, consumed with envy for those who

have more power, money, and prestige. Hlaavin sees the Unseen

as a means of achieving true power in the City of Splendors,

and  Waterdeep  as  the   rst  step  in  his  plot  to  take  control

of the entire Sword Coast North. Hlaavin has accomplished

something no other doppelganger ever has, keeping its druuth

united without an outside controller. The secret of Hlaavins

efforts is its illithid ancestry, an experiment initiated by the

illithids of ChChitl to see if it would make their druuth more

effective. The leader of the Unseen keeps its ancestry secret

even from its fellow doppelgangers.

Hlaavins current roster of identities include: Chievel (LN

male  Chondathan  commoner  2),  the  major-domo  of  the

Kothont  villa  and  right-hand-man  of  Lord  Kothont;  Lady

Cyrtue (CE female human commoner 5), owner of the Hang-

ing Lantern festhall (D22), Thad Ruchel (NE male Illuskan

human rogue 7), leader of the Luskan-based adventuring band

Masks Conscripts, and Nindil Jalbuck (see page 54), now his

primary identity.

Ptola: Ptola (NE greater doppelgangerMF rogue 9) is a cold,

scheming  creature  that  enjoys  torturing  its  victims  before

assuming  their  identities.  Ptolas  current  roster  of  identities

include  Kamlann  (N  male  Chondathan  human  commoner

1), a member of the Dungsweepers Guild, Murklar (LG male

Tethyrian  human  commoner  1),  a  penitent  hunchback  and

janitor of the Wyverns Rest inn ($2), Thurn Blackskull (LE

male duergar psychic warriorXPH 9), a fence specializing in rare

and magic weapons, Senya (CN female Gur human expert 1),

courtesan at the Golden Horn Gambling House (T28), Wendyll

Thintoworth (CN male half-moon elf sorcerer 4/rogue 5/assasin

1)  of  Masks  Conscripts,  and  Jurisk  Ulhammond  (see  page

75). At present, Ptola and its agents simply seek to in ltrate

as many factions in Skullport as possible and slowly increase

the groups in uence in the Port of Shadow.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Vampires

Artor Morlin, once a Shoon outlaw, then Lord Baron of Morlin

Castle and the Steeping Falls, then a vampiric mercenary lord

famed for his hatred of all things Calishite, has dwelled in the

City of Splendors since the Second Troll War. Artor (LE male

vampire  ghter 13/blackguard 3/master vampireLbM 3) sees Wa-

terdeep as his personal hunting preserve and brooks no challenges

from rival vampires to his domain. As a result, Waterdeep is

home to far fewer vampires preying on the citizenry than might

otherwise be the case for a city of its size. Artor takes care to

keep his depredations within the city to a minimum, giving him

a secure and pro table base in which to live out his immortality.

For more on Artors lair, see the Fireplace Level, page 118.

Nobility

Since the founding of Nimoars Hold in the Year of the Curse

(882 DR), wealthy merchant families in what is now Waterdeep

have claimed the mantle of nobility. In some cases, such claims

were based on the awarding of nobility to the familial line by

another sovereign realm; in others, such claims re ected the

aspirations of a powerful family with the means to demand such

honori cs from their neighbors.

In  the  Year  of  the  Cockatrice  (1248  DR),  the  Lords  of

Waterdeep recognized the merchant gentry, marking the formal

beginnings of the Waterdhavian nobility. In some cases, they

retroactively acknowledged a longstanding claim, allowing the

family  to  date  its  ennoblement  to  an  earlier  date.  However,

the Lords carefully insisted there was no established order of

precedence or seniority, preventing the formal establishment of

an old guard.

Ahghairon proposed the establishment of a nobility as both a

matter of practicality and of diplomacy. From a practical stand-

point, the chaotic use of widely varying titles among the populace

prompted all manner of disputes and feuds and threatened the

authority of the Lords. (At one point, there were no less then

twelve Dukes of Waterdeep among just three families.) As a

diplomatic carrot, the city used the granting of titles to lure

powerful, land-owning lords from the surrounding countryside

and wealthy merchants from lands far away into the city. In so

doing, Ahghairon drew new wealth to the city and prevented the

emergence of numerous tiny statelets in Waterdeeps backyard

that might incessantly war among themselves and thus threaten

the citys prosperity.

Since the Year of the Cockatrice, noble families have been

granted the right to bear arms, including small private armies

of up to seventy warriors. (Non-noble families, businesses, and

individuals  are  restricted  to  sixteen  warriors  by  edict  of  the

Lords.) Nobles have also been granted the right to bear arms

of grace, a coat-of-arms borne by all warriors and low-ranking

servants in their service. The noble families have always been

required to contribute one percent of their annual earnings to

the city coffers, payable each Midsummer, for the defense and

maintenance  of  the  city.  Slave  trading  is  forbidden,  and  all

families were required to renounce it upon induction in the Year

of the Cockatrice (1248 DR). Several backsliding houses (includ-

ing Anteos, Kormallis, and Thann) were required to renounce

it again upon the restoration of the Lords rule in the Year of

the Wagon (1273 DR).

Over time, the rate at which new families are ennobled by

the  Lords  of  Waterdeep  has  greatly  diminished.  Effectively,

Waterdeeps nobility is now a closed shop, as no new family

has been ennobled since the Year of the Snow Winds (1335 DR).

As Waterdeeps power has grown, the need to lure minor nobles

from the surrounding countryside into the city has diminished,

and the current families have no interest in reducing the value of

their pedigrees by sharing the wealth, as it were. In recent years,

there has been some talk of ennobling the Duke of Daggerford

and  thus  drawing  that  town  more  formally  into  Waterdeeps

orbit, but for now such discussions have gone nowhere.

All noble families are considered at least minor organiza-

tions, once you include servants, retainers, and the like. Almost

all noble families are isolated in racial make-up (at least among

the blooded kin), with noble members almost exclusively human.

(Rare exceptions include families with half-elves, half-dragons,

tie ings, liches, mummies, werewolves, or yuan-ti among their

living relatives.)

In the current era, the number of actual nobles per noble

family varies between a dozen and six dozen, but such  gures

include all acknowledged relatives, sometimes as far as fourth

cousins from the current patriarch. Typically, the number of

blood relatives of the patriarch of each family resident in the

city is about  fteen or so.

Titles, lands, and funds can be inherited by any child or heir

of a noble patriarch or matriarch. The standard practice in the

Waterdeep assumes the eldest child (regardless of sex) inherits

the title and the majority holdings of a family, with younger

siblings and other relations getting lesser legacies. Living rulers

of a noble family can proclaim a different heir should they

choose, but such a proclamation must take place in the Lords

Court and be con rmed by the Lords, keeping the city rulers

appraised  of  who  stands  to  inherit  the  lands  and  titles  (and

avoiding  any  problems  with  contesting  the  inheritance  after

a rulers passing). The changing of an heir is rare, although a

number of heirs have refused family lands and titles, dedicating

their lives to religious orders or adventuring. In cases where

leadership of the family is contested, the Lords of Waterdeep

make the  nal determination.

Matriarchal  families  are  not  uncommon  in  Waterdeep.

Established  matriarchs  wishing  to  marry  a  nobleman  can

choose to adopt his name and family holdings (at which time

she would abdicate her title and legacy to her chosen heir), or

her husband can become a matriarchs consort (at which time

he would abdicate any former family inheritances and holdings

in order to share in his wifes title and station). If either spouse

(or both) is a solitary heir with no heirs to receive his or her

title, the family portfolios can combine under one name and one

titular head of house or create an entirely new dynasty.

Some  noble  families,  such  as  the  Houses  Deepwinter  and

Maernos, do go extinct, but the Lords usually work behind the

scenes to arrange a hasty marriage to prevent such occurrences.

Aside  from  the  Houses  Gildeggh  and  Zoar,  there  have  been

four such extinctions over Waterdeeps history. Many wealthy,

4/22/05   11:16:40 AM

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

would-be nobles have viewed such extinctions as an opportunity

for their own elevation to the nobility, but in practice there is

little tie between the two.

Ascending to the Nobility

Although it is often easier to marry into an existing noble family,

individuals of wealth and in uence can petition the Lords of

Waterdeep  to  ennoble  them  and  their  descendants.  Although

the Lords of Waterdeep have never spelled out strict criteria

for granting such petitions, some informal strictures have been

deduced by would-be nobles over the years:

An  individual  should  have  demonstrable  personal  wealth,

in excess of 25,000 gp, that has been largely acquired through

mercantile endeavors. (Adventurers who recover large amounts

of treasure do not provide the same ongoing economic impact

to Waterdeep as a wealthy merchant who employs hundreds of

Waterdhavians.)

An individual should reside in Waterdeep except when winter-

ing in the South or leading trade expeditions.

An individual should own several signi cant properties in

the City of Waterdeep.

An individual should play a prominent role in one or more

guilds.

An  individual  should  be  human.  (Although  some  Lords

might wish otherwise, the other families are unlikely to accept

a nonhuman ennobled family any time soon.)

An individual should be sponsored by at least  ve other

noble families.

The key criterion is, of course, the last one. It takes a staggering

amount of wealth, connections, debts, charitable giving, bribes,

and humility to get  ve noble families to agree that it is in their

best interest to add a new family to the nobility.

Adarbrent

House Adarbrent is one Waterdeeps leading shipping clans, with

strong ties to the navy and the Master Mariners Guild.

History:  Lord  Royus  and  his  father  came  to  Waterdeep

from Cormyr in the Year of Storms (1310 DR). The Adarbrent

Shipping Company was a success from the start and the family

joined the nobility a mere seven years later. Lord Royus now

has the third largest  eet of ships in Waterdeep (after the City

Guard and Guild of Watermen).

Plots & Intrigues: House Adarbrent initiated the Horizon

Armada, a league of noble ship owners, and continues to play

a key role in the command of the  eet and the creation of the

resulting maps. Initially, the Adarbrent clan made a fortune on

the trade with New Waterdeep, and several of Royus brothers set

up shop in the new world. Thanks to Beshabas  ckle hand, the

Deepwater War and the assault on Evermeet hurt the Adarbrent

 eet much more than its partners, leaving the house in dire

 nancial straits. Now, Lord Royus is reluctantly entertaining

offers  of  large  amounts  of  money  at  very  reasonable  rates

from his daughters father-in-law, whose only condition is that

the Adarbrents sign a contract with the Rundeen. Through an

intermediary, Lord Royus is looking to hire a band of adventurers

with no previous connection to House Adarbrent to investigate

the business dealings of Fahd yn Sarsor al Nisr to see what he

might be getting into if he accepts the offer.

House  Adarbrent  (Minor  Noble):  AL  LG,  NG;  15,000  gp

resource limit; Membership 86; Isolated (73 human, 8 hal ing, 3

half-elf, 2 other); Salary 15 gp/month for house agents or stipend

of 75 gp/month for clan members (no cost to join).

Authority Figure: Royus Adarbrent (see below).

Important  Characters:  Alroy  Adarbrent  (see  below);  Ellis

Adarbrent (see below); Syllia Adarbrent (see below).

Associated Classes: Aristocrat, expert,  ghter, rogue.

Associated Skills: Appraise, Diplomacy, Forgery, Knowledge

(local), Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Profession (sailor).

Requirements: If you are an agent of the House, you must

serve an average of 20 hours per tenday attending Adarbrent

business. If you are a member of House Adarbrent, you must

devote an average of 30 hours per tenday to dealing with House

business.

Favored  in  Guild  Fringe  Bene t:  Your  connections  with

Waterdeeps merchant nobility give you a jump on  nding the

best market for a valuable item. Once per character level, you

can sell a magic item for 100% of its market value (or an art

object or gem for 120% of its normal value).

Special:  You  can  only  be  a  clan  member  if  the  DM

approves.

Key members of House Adarbrent include:

Alroy  Adarbrent:  Alroy  (NG  male  Chondathan  human

aristocrat 1/expert 9) is a thin, weak man with a keen mind and

perpetual cough. He is one of the best navigators in the city,

having completed the arduous trip to New Waterdeep and back.

This committed bachelor swore off women after being spurned

by Galinda Raventree (who was barely aware of his interest) in

favor of Regnet Amcathra, but he is now spending a great deal

of time with Myrna Cassalanter.

Ellis Adarbrent: Born in the Year of the Moonfall (1344

DR), the third son of Royus, Ellis (LG male Illuskan aristocrat

3), is a very quiet man who stutters when he gets nervous. After

completing an apprenticeship at Larans Cartographers (S39),

he is now a senior cartographer at Horizons Sails (D62) and

close friend of Winter Zulth (see page 76).

Royus Adarbrent: The aging patriarch of House Adarbrent,

Royus (LG male human aristocrat 9) mourns the loss of his wife

many years ago and is consumed with worry that the family is

not in a strong enough  nancial position to weather his death.

Syllia  Adarbrent:  Syllia  (CG  female  Illuskan  aristocrat

1/ ghter  5)  is  a  spit re  with   aming  red  hair  with  temper

and tenacity to match. A born seafarer, Syllia is captain of the

Hippocampus,  agship of the Horizon Armada, and a member

of Those Who Harp. This past spring, Syllia impulsively mar-

ried her lover and fellow Harper, Farid yn Fahd al Nisr (CG

male Calishite human wizard 5), to the dismay of her father

and brothers. At the beginning of the season, the two set off

for New Waterdeep and points beyond and have yet to return.

Unfortunately (and unbeknownst to her), Farids father, Fahd

Amcathra

House Amcathra has a long and distinguished history in the

service of Waterdeep, and a wide variety of trading interests.

Scions of House Amcathra are active patrons of The Splendid

Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, & Finesmiths

as well as The Vintners, Distillers, & Brewers

Guild.  In  addition,  Lord  Arilos  just  became

man with brown hair and beard. He has long been absent from

the family affairs, but is now playing host to his aged parents,

Challas (NG male Tethyrian human aristocrat 9) and Miri (LG

female Tethyrian human aristocrat 9).

Galinda Raventree Amcathra: Galinda (CG female Tethyr-

ian human aristocrat 5/expert 2), recently married to Regnet

Amcathra,  is  one  of  Waterdeeps  leading  socialites  and,  until

recently, one of its most desirable ladies. The younger sister of

Lord Surakh Raventree is now the mother of two, but producing

heirs for House Amcathra has not stopped her

from hosting Waterdeeps annual costume ball

or engaging in rumormongering. Galinda greatly

dislikes Myrna Cassalanter and enjoys beating her

at her own game. She can be contacted at the

History: House Amcathra traces its

lineage  back  to  Rorgar  Amcathra,  a

talented  swordsmith  who  established

a  large  horse-farm  on  the  outskirts

of Rowan Hold (now Amphail) in the

wake  of  the  First  Trollwar,  correctly

perceiving a need to replenish the ranks

of  Waterdeeps  much-depleted  cavalry.

The  family  grew  wealthy  in  the  years

that followed, plowing its pro ts back into

vineyard they built in the foothills of the

Sword Mountains and nurturing the growth

of a half dozen hamlets that fell within their

lands. In the Year of the Cockatrice (1248 DR),

Lord  Hargrym  Amcathra,  great-grandfather

of  the  current  lord,  accepted  Waterdeeps  offer

of nobility and moved his family into the city, and

House Amcathra has continued to prosper ever since.

Regnet  Amcathra:  The  younger

brother of Arilos (NG male Chonda-

than  ghter 5) is a tall man with curly

brown hair and a  erce temper. Famed

for his tastes in clothes and drink, he

has friends and enemies in nearly every

tavern  in  town.  He  considers  Danilo

Thann  (see  page  63),  Civilar  Emmer

Jundhyl (see page 35), Mother Tathlorn,

and  Scirkhel  Wands  among  his  closest

con dantes.  He  is  also  a  founder  of  the

Deep Delvers adventuring company. Regnet

has  settled  down  since  marrying  Galinda

Raventree.  Myrna  Cassalanter  continues  to

badmouth the pair whenever she can, but most

folk ignore such sniping.

Crest of

House Amcathra

Plots  &  Intrigues:  The  blades  of  House  Amcathra

have long been acknowledged as the  nest to be found

in  the  City  of  Splendors,  a  reputation  that  has  long

been pro table for the family. Recently, however, House

Gralhund has begun selling blades at cut-rate prices that seem

far superior to those produced by House Amcathra.

Lord Arilos is gravely concerned of the effect on the familys

 nances should House Gralhund acquire a better reputation for

blademaking. He suspects, but cannot prove, that the dramatic

improvement in House Gralhunds blades results from a new alloy

of metal unavailable to their competitors. The lord of House

Amcathra is now looking for adventurers to determine the source

of House Gralhunds recent ascendance. In particular, he hopes to

either embarrass the rival house or, better yet, acquire a similar

source for metal ingots for the forges of House Amcathra.

The newfound source of metal for House Gralhunds weapons

is the duergar of Clan Xundorn. Speci cally, House Gralhund

has  been  trading  with  Thaglars  Foundry  (LH11),  shipping

steel ingots laced with mithral to the surface and sending coins,

food, and ale into the depths in exchange. If House Amcathra

could obtain access to similar ingots, its superior craftsfolk could

easily produce even better blades than those emerging from the

smithies of House Gralhund.

Chondathan human  ghter 8) is a physically  t, neatly trimmed

Moonstar

House Moonstar is one of Waterdeeps oldest families,

with strong ties to the Church of Selne, the Master

Mariners  Guild,  and  the  Surveyors,  Map  &  Chart-makers

Guild.

History:  The  history  of  House  Moonstar  is  largely  re-

counted in the discussions of the Church of Selne and the

Church of Shar.

Plots & Intrigues: The endless war between Lord Alathene

and  Lord  Vanrak  has  long  consumed  the  scions  of  House

Moonstar. The current generation took it as a personal affront

when Shars avatar impersonated the Moonmaiden during the

Time of Troubles, and it has redoubled its efforts to discover

Lord Vanraks hidden redoubt in the depths of Undermountain.

In recent years, Lord Helve has sponsored no less than a dozen

adventuring companies to delve the depths of Undermountain

in hopes of  nding his trail but so far to no avail. This has

led to the despairing conclusion that there might simply be no

physical link between the hidden temple of Shar and the rest

of Undermountain.

The rise of the Shadow Thieves and their ability to slip

between  the  shadows  has  given  Lady  Alathene  a  new  idea:

She intends to send a band of adventurers into the Plane of

Shadow to establish a temporary base. From there, companies

of  adventurers  chartered  by  House  Moonstar  can  search

for Lord Vanraks Undermountain in the shadow analog of

Undermountain and then attack it from its point of greatest

weakness. Of course,  nding a band of adventurers able and

willing to embark on a long sojourn on the Plane of Shadow

is proving to be a challenge.

Alathene Moonstar: Lady Alathene (CG archlichMF [aug-

mented Illuskan human] wizard 15/arcane devoteePG 5 [Selne]),

long associated with Selnes faith in the City of Splendors, is

old  and  beautiful,  with  the  regal  air  of  a

centuries-old aristocrat. She resides primar-

ily at the Blushing Mermaid (D36), but she

can frequently be found in her laboratory in

the deepest cellars of the Vault of Stars (see

page 120). Lady Alathene is consumed with

the hunt for her brother, Lord Vanrak, and

she will stop at nothing to make him pay

for his crimes.

Feluna  Moonstar:  Feluna  (NG

female af icted werecatMF [augmented

Illuskan human] cleric 5 [Selne]) is

the young, almost ethereally beautiful

sister of Lord Rober. She evinces many

of the personality traits commonly as-

sociated with felines, including a strong

streak of independence, a nocturnal bent,

and a hunters mindset. Feluna  rst mani-

fested  her  lycanthropic  abilities  during  the

Time of Troubles after being kidnapped and left

bound and gagged in the sewers for several days. The

Moonmaiden answered her pleas for aid by transforming

her into a cat. She now serves at the House of the Moon

($56) as one of the Called, having grown comfortable

with her newfound abilities.

Helve Moonstar: Helve (NG male Tethyrian aris-

tocrat 9) is tall and of regal demeanor, with youthful

muscles have that run to fat over the years. He was originally

a captain in the Waterdhavian cavalrys Guard, but a vicious

sword cut to his right leg cost him the long-term career he had

been seeking and drove him into the family business, much

to the delight of his father. While rebellious at  rst, Helve

has matured and, with the guidance of his wife, successfully

enlarged  the  Moonstar  holdings.  Helve  secretly  fears  that

his heir, Rober, does not have what it takes to be head of the

clan, and he has taken to quietly testing his other nephews

and nieces to see if one of them would make a better choice

to succeed him.

Vanrak Moonstar: Lord Vanrak (NE male death knightMM2

[augmented Tethyrian human] ranger 2/cleric 4/nightcloakFP

10 [Shar]), the Dark Ranger, has long been the bogeyman of

House Moonstar and the Church of Selne, residing in the

depths of Undermountain as the master of Vanrakdoom (UM

SLM). Vanrak seeks nothing less than the destruction of the

Moonmaiden,  but  is  content  to  begin  by  destroying  House

Moonstar,  the  House  of  the  Moon,  and  subjugating  all  of

Waterdeep to the bitter comfort of the Dark Maiden.

Wylynd  Moonstar:  A  quiet,  dark-eyed  woman,  Wylynd

(CG  Illuskan  human  female  aristocrat  7)  is  cautious  and

suspicious in her dealings with others. Her habit of planning

and preparing for any contingency has allowed her husband

to embark on several risky business ventures that have paid

off  handsomely,  but  this  has  made  her  few  friends  in  the

process. The younger sister of Naneatha Suaril (see page 75)

is widelyand correctlyperceived as the true force behind

the Moonstar fortunes.

Thann

House Thann is one of Waterdeeps leading

vintners,  with  large  land-holdings  in  the

South and strong ties to Blackstaff Tower.

They have strong ties with the Vintners,

Distillers & Brewers Guild.

History: House Thann traces its his-

tory back to a family of Velenese slave

traders who built their fortune ferry-

ing  slaves  from  the  Port  of  Shadow

to southern lands, where slavery was

legal. Over time, the family split into

two branches, one based in Tethyr, now

all-but-gone, and one based in Waterdeep.

In the Year of Spilled Blood (1315 DR),

Lord Rhammas Thann convinced his aging

father, Lord Erktos I, to abandon the slave

trade, and the family fortunes are now built on

merchant  shipping,   ne  wines,  and  land  owning.

The  family  maintains  a  hand  in  less  reputable  trade

as well.

Plots & Intrigues: The Thann clan is deeply engaged

in the Reclamation of Tethyr and closely allied with

Tethyrs  royal  house.  The  familys  ties  to  the  long-

dead Lhestyn Silmaeril Arunsun and involvement in

Riatavins joining with Tethyr have placed them in the midst of

a burgeoning war with the Shadow Thieves. In the past years,

this con ict has spilled into Waterdeep, with frequent attacks

on Thann holdings by the resurgent thieves guild.

Cassandra  Thann:  Cassandra  (NG  female  Chondathan

human  aristocrat  12)  is  the  indomitable,  intellectual,  long-

lived  matriarch  of  the  Thann  clan,  almost  single-handedly

responsible for resurrecting the familys fortunes after they

abandoned the slave trade. Well versed in the cut-and-thrust

of  city  politics,  she  has  a  nigh-encyclopedic  knowledge  of

Waterdeeps history over the past century. Cassandra has nine

childrenDartek, Eldaun, Randor, Zelphar, Harmon, Ildaera,

Synthea,  Danilo,  and  Judithand  thirteen  grandchildren.

She is the daughter of Zelphar Arunsun and his  rst wife, a

half-elf, although she keeps this elven heritage a secret, pretend-

ing instead to rely on magic for her long years. Cassandras

half-brother is Khelben Ravenscloak Arunsun the Younger,

whose identity Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun the Elder has

assumed.  Although  Cassandra  sometimes  wonders,  she  does

not suspect the deception.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Danilo  Thann:  Danilo  (CG  male  Tethyrian  human  aris-

tocrat  3/wizard  9/spellsingerRac  1),  sixth  son  of  Rhammas

and Cassandra, is a former apprentice of Khelben, a former

Harper, and a former Lord of Waterdeep, instrumental in the

founding New Olamn (C72). He is believed to be in Tethyr in

the company of Arilyn Moonblade (CG female half-moon elf

rogue 1/ ghter 4/Harper agentPG 5), but has largely dropped

out of contact with his family.

Erktos Thann II: Erktos II (LG male Tethyrian human

aristocrat 2/expert 5), Royal Bailiff of Tethyr and second son

of Dartek Thann, joined the Reclamation Army along with

his uncle, Zelphar. Lord Erktos IIs grasp of battle strategies,

siege engineering, and castle construction made him crucial

to the successful siege of Myratma.

Rhammas Thann: Rhammas (LN male Tethyrian human

aristocrat 5), the eldest son of Erktos I, is an honorable, hard-

working man somewhat overshadowed by his wife Cassandra.

The aging Thann patriarch has his failings, including siring

an out-of-wedlock daughter named Lilly who was murdered by

the Knights of the Shield, and in recent years he has largely

retired from an active role in family affairs.

Zelphar  Thann:  Zelphar  (LN  male  Tethyrian  human

aristocrat  8/cleric  5  [Gond]),  fourth  son  of  Rhammas

and Cassandra, is Tethyrs Count of Rivershire and Estate

Chancellor,  responsible  for  all  public  works.  Zelphar  has  a

knack for all things mechanical, which he put to good use

maintaining the siege engines of the Reclamation Army, but

his true love is wine, and he oversees most of the familys

southern vineyards. He is also a member of the Merchants

Chosen of Riatavin, a role that has earned him the enmity

of the Shadow Thieves and made him the target of frequent

assassination attempts.

Wands

House Wands is one of Waterdeeps leading magecraft clans,

with strong ties to the Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors

and  Blackstaff  Tower.  Members  of  the  family  are  scattered

across Faern, including Ellidis Shadowink Wands (CG half-

moon elf male rogue 3/sorcerer 6/Arcane Trickster 1), making a

name for himself as a thief in Calimshan, and Marcus Marco

Volo Wands (CN male Tethyrian human bard 7), now off

adventuring in the Heartlands.

History: House Wands is one of Waterdeeps oldest families,

able to trace its ancestry back to a Magister of Mystra. The

founder of the clan was Eldrus Sunstaff, a wizard from another

world who came to Faern in the Year of the Narrow Escape

(395 DR), changed his surname to Wands, and then slew the

reigning Magister in the Year of High Eyes (409 DR). Members

of the family have always espoused a conservative approach to

magic that many arcane spellcasters  nd incredibly restrictive.

However, House Wands has played a critical role in ensuring

that Waterdeep never fell victim to the magical excesses that

consumed the once-proud city of Ascalhorn.

Plots & Intrigues: Less than a decade ago, Marcus Wands

stole an artifact known as the Dragonkings Eye from an evil

wizard  named  Sabbar.  After  a  series  of  adventures,  Marcus

ended up releasing the alien god bound within, known as the

Dragonking.  The  Dragonking  was  defeated  thanks  to  the

intervention  of  Corellon  Larethian,  Sune,  and  Tyr,  but  its

momentary liberation has had a strange effect. In the years

since its release, creatures from the Far Realm have begun ap-

pearing the immediate vicinity of individual members of House

Wands at random, but with distressing regularity. Maskar and

Olanhar continue to seek a solution to this problem, but in

the interim House Wands is in need of skilled adventurers to

protect the less powerful members of House Wands whenever

they venture forth from the heavily warded Wands villa.

House Wands (Standard Noble): AL LN, LG; 15,000 gp re-

source limit; Membership 99; Isolated (77 human, 9 hal ing, 7

elf, 4 half-elf, 2 other); Salary 20 gp/month for house agents or

stipend of 100 gp/month for clan members (no cost to join).

serve  an  average  of  20  hours  per  tenday  attending  Wands

business.  If  you  are  a  member  of  House  Wands,  you  must

devote  an  average  of  30  hours  per  tenday  to  dealing  with

House business.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: House Wands subsidizes

the costs of any magic item you create, reducing the cost of

raw material components by 20%.

Special:  You  can  only  be  a  clan  member  if  the  DM

approves.

Notable Wands nobles include:

Maskar Wands: Maskar (LN male Tethyrian human wizard

20/Archmage 3) is the rarely seen, traditional, conservative

patriarch of the Wands clan. He favors traditional wizards

robes, and he is gracious in manner and gestures. Maskar is

known for his strict disapproval of the abuse of magic and

its wasteful, unrestrained use, to the point of even chastising

the Blackstaff from time to time. Although Maskar and his

daughter Olanhar do take students, Maskar demands payment

for such services in the form of dif cult Art-related quests.

Olanhar  Wands:  Olanhar  (LG  female  Tethyrian  human

wizard 14) is a tall, regal woman with long raven tresses and

her father Maskars distinctive facial features. She is married

to  Challat  Artoban  (CG  male  Tethyrian  human  wizard  7)

and is a close friend of Mhair Szeltune (see page 30) of the

Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors.

Scirkhel Wands: Scirkhel (CG male Tethyrian human ranger

6/bard 2) is a middle-aged, bearded member of the Wands clan,

the handsome and well-respected great great nephew of Maskar

Wands. Born in the Year of the Fallen Throne (1319 DR),

he left at a young age to see the world. During his travels, he

fell in with a ranger of the Heralds and learned heraldry and

woodcraft from him. After returning to Waterdeep, Scirkhel

quietly assumed the duties of Falconfree. He recently took up

study as a bard at New Olamn (C72), and he is a close friend

of Regnet Amcathra.

MYRNA CASSALANTER

Myrna (NE female Tethyrian human bard 1/rogue 7) has a

sharp-angled facemade possible by vigorous self-starvation

and  delineated  by  too  much  cosmeticsand  a  pale,  perfect

complexion, enhanced with judicious doses of belladonna. She

favors elaborate, revealing gowns accented with gems (and made

practical in a northern clime by means of her ring of warmth)

and complicated, upswept hairstyles that dramatically show off

her henna-colored hair. She has considerable personal wealth,

including a small mansion ($78), vast wardrobe, a stable with

riding and carriage horses, several hawks, and a considerable

personal library with books detailing the heraldry, history, and

scandals of generations of in uential Waterdhavians.

Myrna showed an aptitude for gossip at an early age, falling

naturally  into  the  family  business  of  information  gathering

and rumormongering. One of the best sources of information

in upper class Waterdeep, Myrna prides herself on her accu-

racyexcept when she is paid to spread lies, of course. She is

careful to only engage in character assassination when it cannot

be traced back to her and damage her reputation. In recent years,

Myrna has begun to look for a match that will improve her

standings and fortune. Regnet Amcathra spurned her several

years ago when he married Galinda Raventree, Myrnas long-

time rival, and Myrna continues to exact her revenge in ways

both petty and small.

Rogues and Ruffians

Like all great cities, Waterdeep attracts its fair share of rogues

who  stalk  the  shadows  and  ruf ans  who  prey  on  the  weak.

Waterdeeps only recognized thieves guild, the Shadow Thieves,

has been exiled for nearly a century, and the Lords have long

sought  to  con ne  the  citys  inevitable  illegal  pursuits  to  the

Port  of  Shadow.  As  a  result,  most  Waterdhavian  rogues  are

independent agents or members of organizations based outside the

city. Since the Year of the Wave (1364 DR), those who practice

bardcraft have been regaining their former prominence in the

City of Splendors. Much of this ascendance can be ascribed to

the founding of New Olamn (C72).

Agents of the Eye

The Xanathar, also known as the Eye, is Waterdeeps most

powerful and successful beholder. It eliminated every rival

eye tyrant in the City of Splendors and the dungeons below,

leaving  it  the  unquestioned  master  of  its  kind  in  the  City

of Splendors. The Eye is served by a large group of agents,

known  in  Undermountain  as  the  Agents  of  the  Eye  and

in  Waterdeep  as  the  Xanathar  Thieves  Guild.  By  either

name, the Xanathars operation controls a large fraction of

Waterdeeps  slave  trade  and  is  rivaled  only  by  the  Shadow

Thieves in its dominance of petty thieving operations in the

City of Splendors.

Base of Operations: The Xanathar Thieves Guild maintains

scattered  safe  houses  throughout  the  sewers  of  Waterdeep,

small rooms hidden behind secret doors among the warrens of

passages. In Undermountain, the Agents of the Eye maintain

a base in Skullport, the former residence of Misker the Pirate

Tyrant, and control much of the Sargauth Level (UM L3).

Agents of the Eye (Expansive Criminal): AL LE, NE, CE;

40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 360; Integrated (humans

133, half-orcs 72, hal ings 64, dwarves 36, half-elves 25, others

18,  elves  7,  gnomes  4,  and  beholder  1);  Dues  60  gp/month

(300 gp to join).

Authority Figure: The Eye (see below).

Important Characters: Ahmaergo the Horned Dwarf (LE

male  shield  dwarf   ghter  9);  Avaereene  (see  below);  Shindia

Darkeyes  (CE  half-drow  elf  rogue  9);  Orlpar  Husteem  (see

page 50); Slink Monteskor (CE male Chondathan expert 12);

Randulaith of Mirabar (see below); Colstan Rhuul (see below);

Ott Steeltoes (NE male shield dwarf rogue 5/ ghter 4); Slan

Thurbel (CE male Tethyrian  ghter 9).

Associated Classes: Expert,  ghter, rogue, sorcerer, wizard.

Associated Skills: Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Knowledge

(dungeoneering), Knowledge (local), Search.

Requirements: Do not divulge guild secrets to outsiders. You

must obtain the guilds consent before attempting any large (a

score of 1,000 gp or more) or high-pro le crime, and the guild

claims 15% of your pro ts for such crimes.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: You know the best markets

for valuable merchandise. Once per character level, you can sell

a magic item for 100% of its market value, or an art object or

gem for 120% of its normal value.

Other Noble Houses

Waterdeep is home to over seventy noble families and clans,

ranging  from  fantastically  wealthy  merchant  princes  to

impoverished but well-bred gentry. Some of the citys more

notable noble houses include:

Hawkwinter

Raventree

Roaringhorn

Rosznar

Silmerhelve

Thunderstaff

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Special: The Eye is extremely careful, to the point of paranoia,

about bringing new members into its inner circle. You must demon-

strate ruthlessness and obedience in a test of loyalty (usually, killing

or selling into slavery a former associate or family member).

As  the  Xanathar  Thieves  Guild  grows  in  number,  the  Eye

increasingly hides behind multiple layers of indirection, but even

low-level agents of the Xanathar Thieves Guild are secretly

probed by the Eye before becoming members of the guild.

Although no one has done so thus far, an agent of the Eye

might become an ocular

adeptFP,  but  the  Eye

would view such individ-

uals as self-aggrandizing,

deluded pawns.

Avaereene:  Avaer-

eene

female

(LE

Tethyrian wizard 12) is

a  beautiful,  cruel,  and

skilled mage and slaver

who  serves  the  Eye

by picking up potential

slaves  in  the  seamier

wards of Waterdeep by

night. She leads the Eyes

snatch-and-grab kidnap-

ping  agents,  known  as

the  Hand.  She  com-

mands  great  loyalty  from

her forces, and they will do

anything to prevent her harm

or capture. In addition to her quarters in the

stronghold of the Eye in Undermountain, she

rents rooms in North Ward above the Bent Nail

(N77),  where  she  keeps  a  workbook  of  spells

beneath the  oor. She hides an impressive cache

of magic items and spellbooks in a cellar off the

south end of Carters Way. Avaereene enjoys creating

darkenbeastsMF to serve her deadly whims, and she

intends someday to supplant the Blackstaff as the most

powerful mage of Waterdeep.

The Eye: The Eye (LE advanced 33 HD elder orbLM sorcerer

12),  also  known  the  Xanathar,  is  an  ancient,  wrinkled,  and

extremely paranoid beholder of the Graypeaks Hive. Its primary

base is in the southern half of the third level of Undermountain

near Skullport in a forti ed complex, but it also maintains an

extensive lair in the sewers of Waterdeep, linked to its other

lair by a keyed portal. The elder orb never ventures out from its

dual lairs, preferring to work exclusively through intermediaries.

It is attended at all times by swarms of lurking stranglersMM3

and eyeball beholderkinMF.

The Eye controls an extensive slaving operation in the Port

of Shadow, rivaled only by Zstulkk Ssarmns out t (see Serpent

Kingdoms  pages  134  and  142),  and  the  recently  resurgent

Shadow Thieves. It has also recently muscled in on Skullports

smuggling operations, at the expense of its beholder rival, Misker

the Pirate Tyrant (LE advanced 22 HD beholder). In recent

65

years, the Eye has extended its control over all the beholders of

Undermountain, forcing those who refused to bow to its rule to

 ee into the Underdark or the surface. It sole remaining rival,

Misker, was forced to  ee into the depths and is now in hiding

in  the  abandoned  Trobriands  Graveyard  (UM  SLE).  The

Eye views all humanoids as slaves for the taking, but always

interrogates captives to learn all that might be turned to its

advantage, slaying only if it must.

Randulaith of Mirabar: Randulaith (NE male

Illuskan  human  wizard  9)

guards  the  Eyes  lair  in

Undermountain,  but  is  a

frequent  habitu  of  Skull-

port  and  Dock  Ward.  This

quiet,  elegant  man

has a taste for good

wine,  clever  jokes,

and  mermaids.  He

favors a plain tunic and

breeches. He is not cruel

and  makes  friends

easily  among  beings

of  all  races  and

alignments, making

him  a  valued  spy  of

the Eye.

Randulaith has long aspired

to join the Lords of Water-

deep,  and  he  has  recently

made  progress  toward  that

goal. He is now the engaged

to be married to the widow

Brianne Byndraeth (see page

54),  having  learned  from

Colstan Thuul of her mem-

bership in that august group

and then determinedly courted her.

In  the  course  of  his  courtship,  he

has  also  caught  the  eye  of  Caladorn

Cassalanter and Sammereza Sulphontis, both

of whom see the charming Randulaith as a

possible future Lord, although, thus far, Randulaith has not

discovered their secret roles or interest.

Colstan Rhuul: Colstan (LE male Illuskan cleric 11 [Bane])

is a one-time adherent of Bane who brie y adopted Cyric as his

god before returning to the Black Lord after his return. This

haughty, cold man with thick black hair is a patient, calculating

schemer who avoids personal danger whenever he can, preferring

to  work  at  a  distance  through  hired  knives  and  behind-the-

scenes manipulation. He makes a patient, careful foe for those

who injure or thwart him, tirelessly arranging opponent after

opponent to bedevil his enemies.

Colstan is Avaereenes second-in-command in the Hand and is

based in the Eyes lair in Undermountain. The Banites favorite

tactic is to send hireswords to start a brawl or similar incident

with adventurers newly arrived in Waterdeep, while he waits

in the wings to steal unguarded belongings in their rooms or

The Eye

attack an isolated spellcaster. The Banite then takes what magic

he can, and then calls in the Hand to capture the remaining

adventurers. Colstan prides himself on knowing the faces of

all important (not always prominent) Waterdhavians, and he

has made a hobby of uncovering the identities of the Lords of

Waterdeep. After several setbacks in his efforts to discover who

is and is not a Lord, Colstan has identi ed the widow Brianne

Byndraeth as a probable member of that group.

Black Boar Tribe

Named for a barbaric tribe that attacked the City of Splendors

nearly three centuries ago, the Black Boar tribe is one of

two barbaric gangs that prowl Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The

Black Boars were founded less than a decade ago by Myrnd

Gundwynd, a noble raised by members of the Thunderbeast

tribe before returning to Waterdeep as an adult.

The Black Boars provide genuine, reasonably priced security

services for merchants and tavernkeepers in Dock Ward, serving

as both bodyguards and bouncers for those with coin. The Black

Bears are not above initiating the occasional tavern brawl on

behalf of a wealthy patron, but they never deliberately target

individuals during such altercations, so only those in need of

a distraction typically use this service. Members are  erce

rivals of the Bull Elk tribe.

Base of Operations: The Black Boar tribe has no chapter-

house, but its members can usually be found drinking at the

Sleeping Snake (D41).

Black  Boar  Tribe  (Minor  Mercenary):  AL  CN,  CG,  N;

3,000 gp resource limit; Membership 62; Isolated (humans

59,  shield  dwarves  2,  half-orcs  1);  Dues  10  gp  per  month

(100 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Myrnd Gundwynd (CN male Illuskan

 ghter 3/barbarian 9).

Important  Characters:  Janszobur  (see  below);  Krelth  Li-

onmane (CG male Illuskan human barbarian 3/ranger 3, far

wandering member of the Black Lion tribe).

Associated Classes: Barbarian,  ghter, rogue, warrior.

Associated  Skills:  Climb,  Intimidate,  Jump,  Knowledge

(local), Move Silently, Spot.

Requirements: Do not divulge secrets of the tribe to out-

siders. Spend an average of 10 hours per tenday engaged in

missions or jobs for the tribe.

Favored  in  Guild  Fringe  Bene t:  You  have  learned  to

overcome pain and weakness in order to impress your fellows.

Once per character level you can automatically shake off the

effects of being sickened, stunned, or shaken.

Joining the Black Boar tribe usually requires a demonstration

of great bravery, such as wrestling a deadly monster in one of

the citys illegal  ght pits.

Janzobur  of  the  Snow  Cats:  Janzobur  (NG  male  Illuskan

human barbarian 6) is a tall, beardless man with long, braided

red hair. He favors pants and a cloak cut from the pelt of a polar

bear and a shirt, if worn, of simple linen. Janzobur  rst came to

Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR) in search of a

warrior-princess for the Red Tiger Uthgardt tribe. His candidate, an

Athkatlan mercenary, perished in battle with a remorhaz. By her

failure to lead the tribe to glory, Janzobur was also judged a failure,

and he returned in disgrace to Waterdeep in search of another

candidate.  Janzobur  now  concentrates  his  efforts  on  sampling

the best brews South Wards and Dock Wards taverns have to

offer. He has recently fallen in with the Black Boars at the gentle

urging of his long-time friend, Myrnd Gundwynd. Janzobur still

prefers to brawl rather than draw steel, and his drunken efforts to

 nd his princess at the end of every evening (startling sleeping

goodwives by peering in their windows and rattling doors down

every street he passes) are well known to the City Watch.

Bull Elk Tribe

Named for a barbaric tribe that set Nimoars Hold ablaze in

the Year of the Shining Shield (889 DR), the Bull Elk tribe

is one of two barbaric gangs that prowl Waterdeeps Dock Ward.

The Bull Elks are composed primarily of outcast Uthgardt

barbarians and brutish half-orcs, although a few former Illuskan

reavers have joined the tribe as well.

Under the leadership of Chief Hagar Hlutwigsson, the

Bull Elks offer lucrative protection services to most of the

taverns along the harbor and many ships while they are un-

loaded. They are sometimes hired discretely by representatives

of the various noble houses to incite tavern brawls in which a

certain target is accidentally hurt or killed. The thuggish Bull

Elks are savvy enough to stay just within the law, keeping one

step ahead of the Magisters, the City Watch, and the Guild of

Watermen. They are  erce rivals of the Black Bear tribe.

Base of Operations: The Bull Elk tribe has no chapterhouse,

but its members can usually be found drinking at the Bloody

Fist (D17).

Bull Elk Tribe (Minor Criminal): AL CE, NE, CN; 3,000 gp

resource limit; Membership 83; Mixed (humans 66, half-orcs

17); Dues 40 gp/month (100 gp to join).

Authority Figure: Chief Hagar Blue Bear Hlutwigsson

(see below).

Important  Characters:  Wormguts  (NE  male  Illuskan

human  barbarian  7,  banished  for  murder  from  the  Great

Worm tribe); Reskyn the Fanged (CE male half-orc werewolf

barbarian 2/ranger 4, abandoned at birth by the Gray Wolf

tribe); Ulmrin (see below).

Associated Classes: Barbarian,  ghter, rogue, warrior.

Associated  Skills:  Climb,  Intimidate,  Jump,  Knowledge

(local), Search, Spot.

Requirements:  Do  not  divulge  secrets  of  the  tribe  to

outsiders.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: You have learned excep-

tional savagery in battle from your bloodthirsty fellows. If you

are within 30 feet of another Bull Elk tribesman, you gain a

+1 morale bonus on damage rolls.

Special: Joining the Bull Elk tribe usually requires a dem-

onstration of uncontrolled savagery, such as entering a rage or

frenzy in combat. In the absence of pure savagery, demonstrable

 ghting skill (base attack bonus +3 or better) will suf ce.

Notable Bull Elks include:

Ulmrin:  Ulmrin  (LE  male  half-orc   ghter  5)  is  a  rare

Waterdhavian  half-orc,  tolerated  so  long  as  his  gold  is  good.

This burly  ghter can almost pass for human in appearance,

and favors the longsword, battleaxe, dagger, and chainmail. He

loves to  ght, but his loyalty is only to himself. He used to hire

on with adventuring bands, but in time his cruelty, self-centered-

ness, and cowardice became too well known to  nd steady work.

Ulmrin eventually fell in with the Bull Elk tribe, where he has

found a comfortable, if brutal, fellowship.

CHIEF HAGAR HLUTWIGSSON

The Blue Bear is the hagspawnUna son of

Tanta  Hagara,  an  annis  who  brie y

ruled  Hellgate  Keep,  and  Hlutwig

Long-throw,  last  chieftain  of  the

Uthgardt Blue Bear tribe. Banished

from the tribe at a young age by his

mother, who was serving as shaman

at the time, Hagar wandered south

and west, surviving through luck,

cunning, and his innate hagspawn

traits. Over time, he assembled a

small  band  of  brutish  Uthgardt

outcasts and half-orcs, who took to

calling him chief. Eventually the

group ended up in Waterdeeps Dock

Ward, as much by happenstance as

by design.

Although  some  think  him  a

werebear,  the  Blue  Bear  became

a  traditional  bear  warriorCW  after

receiving  a  vision  from  Malar

of  his  traditional  tribal  totem,

for  Hagars  temperament  and

methods  pleased  the  Beastlord.

Through cunning and brute force,

Hagar has since transformed the thugs of

the  Bull  Elk  tribe  into  one  of  the  most

powerful gangs in Dock Ward.

Tall and powerfully built, Hagar resembles a brutish human

with long arms, big hands, a distinctive hunched posture, and

coarse, heavy features. His jet-black hair is long and lank, his red

eyes gleam with malice, and his skin color is pallid blue, hinting

at his annis ancestry. In bear form, Hagars fur has a distinctly

blue-ish hue, accounting for his moniker as the Blue Bear.

Languages: Abyssal, Common, Giant, Illuskan.

Bear Form (Su): Hagar can transform into a bear (similar

to the polymorph spell) while in rage, limited by the number of

times per day he enters a rage, and returns to his own form once

the rage ends. Hagar retinas the normal +2 bonus on Will saves

and 2 penalty to Armor Class while raging, but the ability score

bonuses granted by rage are replaced by Strength, Dexterity, and

Constitution bonuses appropriate to the bear form

taken (black bear: +8 Str, +2 Dex,

+4 Con; brown bear: +16 Str, +2

Dex,  +8  Con).  As  normal  for

polymorph,  Hagar  gains  the

bear  forms  physical  qualities

(including  size,  movement,

natural armor bonus, natural

weapons, space, and reach), as

well as any extraordinary special

attacks  possessed  by  the  form

(such  as  improved  grab  in  the

brown bear form). The transfor-

mation lasts for the duration of

the rage.

Unlike  with  the  polymorph

spell, Hagar doesnt gain the bears

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitu-

tion scores when he takes bear form,

nor  does  he  regain  any  hit  points

when he transforms. However, his

current hit points increase due to his

new Constitution, as normal for the

rage ability.

Improved Uncanny Dodge

(Ex): Cannot be  anked and

can only be sneak attacked by

a  character  who  has  at  least  12  levels  of

rogue.

Rage (Ex): Three times per day, Hagar can enter a state of

 erce rage that lasts for 8 rounds. The following changes are in

effect as long as he rages: hp 155; AC 18, touch 13,  at-footed

17; Grp +20; Atk +21 melee (1d12+10/3, masterwork greataxe);

Full Atk +21/+16/+11 melee (1d12+10/3, masterwork greataxe);

SV Fort +15, Will +5; Str 24, Con 20; Climb +15, Jump +15.

At the end of his rage, Hagar is fatigued for the duration of

the encounter.

Scent (Ex): Hagar has the scent special ability while in bear

or nonbear form.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Hagar  retains  his  Dexterity  bonus

to Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen

foe (he still loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise

immobile).

Possessions: Blue dragonhide armor, Ellatharions ring (ring of

protection +4), masterwork greataxe, heart of the beastMag, potion

of protection from arrows (10/magic).

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

The Shadow Thieves

Founded over a century ago in the City of Splendors, the Shadow

ThievesLD were eventually unmasked and nearly destroyed by

the Lords of Waterdeep. After the guild was banished from the

City of Splendors, the survivors regrouped in Amn. The guild

has since grown to be the largest and most prosperous thieves

guild in all Faern, controlling the lions share of all criminal

operations along the Sword Coast (with the notable exception of

Waterdeep), and elsewhere in the Realms as well.

The  Shadow  Thieves  have  long  schemed  to  reestablish

themselves in the City of Splendors. Constant vigilance by the

Lords of Waterdeep and their agents kept the guild at bay until

recently, but the dark times that have fallen on Waterdeep in

the past two decades have given the Shadow Thieves an opening

they have been quick to exploit. For more than  ve years, the

guild has been funneling manpower and resources into the City

of Splendorsand results are beginning to show. The guild has

slowly come to dominate criminal activity in Dock, South, and

Trades  Ward,  and  its   ngers  are  reaching  into  the  northern

wards of the city as well.

The Waterdeep sect is led by Silhouette of Shadows Alauneth

the Black Viper Orrane. She reports to Marune the Masked,

Cloakmaster of the Dessarin, who is in the city often enough

to be considered the true head of the sect. Marune, in turn,

reports to the Shade of Baldurs Gate and thereby the entire

Shadow Council.

Early in the Year of the Tankard (1370 DR), Marune  nally

unveiled his grand plan for giving the Shadow Thieves an unas-

sailable edge over the Lords of Waterdeep. The necromancer

began  distributing  slippers  of  shadowwalking*  to  the  guilds

highest-ranking thieves. Agents of the Shadow Thieves can now

effortlessly navigate Waterdeeps shadows, beyond the reach of

the citys Lords. Marune intends to continue this work until the

entire city falls under the sway of the guild.

Base of Operations: Before their banishment, the Shadow

Thieves were based in the Citadel of Bloody Shadows in the

heart of Mount Waterdeep. Today, the reborn guild is based in a

half-dozen safe houses scattered through Dock Ward, Southern

Ward, and Trades Ward. (A sample safe house is detailed in

Lords of Darkness.)

The Shadow Thieves have struck a bargain with the Shadovar

of the City of Shade, in which select members of the guild are

transformed into shades. In exchange, the Shadow Thieves spy

on Waterdeep and the Sword Coast on the behalf of the princes

of Shade.

Shadow Thieves of Waterdeep (Standard Criminal): AL LE,

NE, CE, CN; 40,000 gp resource limit; Membership 164 (local);

Mixed (humans 130, hal ings 15, elves 8, dwarves 5, gnomes 3,

half-elves 2, half-orcs 1); Dues 70 gp/month (300 gp to join).

Authority Figures: The Shadow Council of Athkatla (spe-

ci cally the Shade of Baldurs Gate); The Masked (Marune,

Cloakmaster of the Dessarin; see below); Alauneth the Black

Viper Orrane (see below).

Important Characters: Androm Kherr (NE male Illuskan

human  ghter 6, Ruathymite sea captain); Balthorr the Bold

Olaskos (see page 50); Maknis (LE male Illuskan human com-

moner 4, shipping agent); Ressic Ophal (LE male Tethyrian

human rogue 5/shadow thief of AmnPG 4, spice merchant of

Amn);  Reoke  Segymn  (CE  male  Illuskan  human  expert  3,

merchant);  Yladhra  the  Grim  (CE  female  Calishite  human

diviner 12, exile from Myratma).

Associated Classes: Expert,  ghter, rogue.

Associated Skills: Bluff, Disguise, Gather Information, Hide,

Knowledge (local), Sleight of Hand.

Requirements: You may not divulge secrets of the guild to

outsiders. You must gain the consent of your superiors before

attempting any particularly large (1,000 gp or more) or high-

pro le crime, and the guild is entitled to a 20% cut of your

pro ts for such jobs.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: Mask favors thieves who

are bold and quick. Once per character level, you can call upon

Masks blessing to gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for a duration

of 1 minute.

Special: Joining the Shadow Thieves requires a demonstration

of cunning and effectiveness (usually the acquisition of a valuable

trinket that is to be given to the guild in tribute, or the heart

of an assassinated enemy of the guild) and a blood-oath to the

Shadow Councils designated representative.

Members of the Shadow Thieves can take the Shadow Thief of

AmnPG prestige class, if admitted to the guild and they meet

all requirements.

Marune the Masked: The oldest living member of the Shadow

Thieves is the necromancer Marune (NE male Tethyrian human

necromancer 5/shadow adeptPG 14/archmage 5), who was born

in the Year of the Black Buck (1226 DR). Marune achieved

longevity through magic without resorting to lichdom, thanks

to the artifact known as Andrathaths mask, which he acquired

early in his career while plundering a long-forgotten ruined tower

in the Lost Peaks.

Marune helped found the Shadow Thieves in the Year of the

Raging Flame (1255 DR), and served as Shadowmage of the

Guild until their defeat and exile in the Year of the Pointed Bone

(1298 DR). In the Year of the Behir (1342 DR), Marune sold his

holdings in Luskan and Mirabar and vanished. Unbeknownst to

his allies and foes alike, he had acquired the Book of Vauth and

wanted to study it in isolation. Marune constructed a secret lair

amid the roots of Mount Helimbrar and then vanished within.

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), Marune emerged

to reclaim his old position within the hierarchy of the Shadow

Thieves. He is now the Cloakmaster of the Dessarin, nominally

reporting to the Shade of Baldurs Gate. In truth, the Shade

Council gives him almost complete autonomy. Marune accepts

whatever changes occur within the guild with a shrug, determined

only that the guild will survive.

Despite  his  reputation,  Marune  is  rather  nondescript  in

appearance. He is of middling height, with an average face, a

mid-length gray beard, and a plump belly. Traditionally, Marune

has favored the classic garb of a necromancer, including long

black robes and a somewhat pointy hat. However, during visits to

Waterdeep, the Cloakmaster of the Dessarin shields his identity

with Andrathaths mask. Marune is consumed with his hatred

for the Lords of Waterdeep and the members of the Arunsun

clan. He is cruel, ruthless, and vengeful to a fault.

Marune  is  attended  by  six  will-o-wisps  who  serve  him

voluntarily.

ALAUNETH BLACK VIPER ORRANE

Born in the village of Amphail in the Year of the Lion (1340

DR), the Black Viper of Undermountain is one of Waterdeeps

most infamous thieves. Alauneth has short, hacked-off black

hair, a  ery temper, and a deep, husky voice given to nigh-con-

stant swearing. Her beautiful face is marred only by a ragged

scar that runs down the left side of her chin and ends on her

shoulder.

In the past, the Black Viper favored daring snatch-and-grab

thefts accompanied by clouds of smoke (obscuring mist) from rich

merchants and nobles, but in recent years, she has grown bored

of such games. After allying herself with agents of the Shadow

Thieves  almost  a  decade  ago,  she  quickly  became  enmeshed

in guild activities and rose to a position of leadership within

the Waterdeep sect of the guild, second only to the Masked

(Marune). Her responsibilities as Silhouette of Shadows include

recruiting new talent, surreptitiously establishing safe houses for

the guild within the City of Splendors, and eliminating threats

to the guilds activities. She employs her thieving prowess to

acquire materials with which to blackmail rich merchants into

being her purchasing agents.

The  rst set of statistics that follow describes Alauneth if she

is encountered in darkness (when she is more formidable); the

second set describes her if she is encountered in a location that

has  bright

illumination.

Death  Attack  (Ex):  If  Alauneth  studies  her

victim  for  3  rounds  and  then  makes  a  sneak

attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals

damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect

of  possibly  either  paralyzing  or  killing  the  target

Marune and the Black Viper

(Alauneths choice). If the victim of such an attack fails a DC

16 Fortitude save, she is paralyzed for 1d6+5 rounds or killed,

as appropriate.

Poison Use: Alauneth is skilled in the use of poison and

never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison

to a weapon.

Control Light (Sp): Alauneth can decrease the levels of light

within a 100-foot radius of herself by a factor of up to 100%.

This decreases the overall effective range of vision for characters

and creatures dependent on light by the same percentage. Crea-

tures within the affected area gain a +1 bonus on Hide checks

for each 25% decrease in light. Alauneth cannot use this ability

in bright light.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Cannot be  anked and can

only be sneak attacked by a character who has at least nineteen

levels of rogue.

Invisibility (Sp): Alauneth can use this spell-like ability once

per minute as a 15th-level sorcerer. She cannot use this spell-like

ability when in bright light.

Shadesight (Su): Alauneth has darkvision out to 60 feet. She

can see normally through any darkness effects, but not through

fog, invisibility, obscurement, and so forth. She cannot use this

ability when in bright light.

Shadow Image (Sp): Three times per day, Alauneth can use

this ability (similar to the mirror image spell) as a 15th-level

sorcerer. The ability creates 1d4+5  gments. She cannot use this

ability when in bright light.

Shadow Stride (Su): Alauneth can vanish from her current

location and reappear in any shadowy area within 100 feet,

as often as once every 2 rounds. Using this ability is a move

action,  so  Alauneth  can  use  another  ability,  cast  a  spell,  or

attack in the same round. She cannot use this ability when in

bright light.

Shadow Travel (Sp): Once per day, Alauneth can use either

greater teleport to reach a shadowy locale on the same world as

the shade or plane shift to access the Plane of Shadow. Alauneth

must be in shadows to use this ability.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Alauneth does an extra 9d6 points of

damage on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked

targets, or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity

bonus for any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks

against targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment,

creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to

extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Alauneth can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Trap nding (Ex): Alauneth can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. She can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 +

the level of the spell used to create it). If her Disable Device

result exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, she discovers how

to bypass the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  Alauneth  retains  her  Dexterity

bonus to Armor Class even when  at-footed or targeted by

an unseen foe (she still loses her Dexterity bonus if paralyzed

or otherwise immobile).

Assassin  Spells  Known  (4/2  per  day;  caster  level  5th):

1stdetect poison, low-light visionMag, obscuring mist, true strike;

2ndcats grace, darkness, pass without trace.

Possessions: +3 mithral chain shirt, Dartdasher (+1 spellbladePG

[magic missile] rapier), Viperfang*, greenstone amuletMag, ring of

feather falling, ring of freedom of movement, rope of entangle-

ment, 3 potions of cure serious wounds.

New item described in Chapter 7.

Independent Agents

Since the exile of the Shadow Thieves, the Lords of Waterdeep

have fought to keep organized thieves guilds out of the City

of Splendors. In their absence, individual agents have  our-

ished, free to pursue their own aims and keep their ill-gotten

gains for themselves. Some of the more notable independent

agents include:

Thear Chessar: Thear (CN female shield dwarf rogue 5/thief-

acrobatCA 3, Dungeoneers Intuition* feat) is a short, bearded

dwarf  of  Clan  Stoneshaft  who  loves  the  fun  and  danger  of

stealing from rooftops. With her trusty battleaxe and old chain

shirt, no one suspects she is a thief. She simply leaves them

behind in the shadows of a rooftop when shes in the building

beneath, leaving her free to practice her craft. If chased, Thear

proves an elusive foe, doubling back over sewers and rooftops

until she can don armor and axe and become a typical dwarf

drinking  in  a  busy  tavern.  Thear  resists  greedy  impulses  to

over-indulge in thievery, usually picks on visitors to the city,

and is quite talented. In recent years, Thear has become quite

close with Paerro (see below), and the two have become  rm

drinking and thieving buddies.

Elaith the Serpent Craulnober: Elaith is fully detailed on

page 182 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Duromil  the  Fearless:  Duromil  (CN  male  Tethyrian

human rogue 8) appears to be an average  ghter, down on his

luck, with stringy chestnut hair, wispy moustache and beard, and

ill-kept equipment. In truth, Duromil is a quiet, close-mouthed

thief who specializes in robbing visitors to the city of small

precious items. He frequents Castle Wards inns and taverns,

posing as a  ghter and even hiring on with Blazidon if times

are  particularly  lean.  He  is  not  averse  to  accompanying  an

adventuring band as a hiresword and later stealing from them

when opportunities arise, but he is always careful to hide the

fact that he is a thief.

His favorite tricks are sneak attacks and picking pockets in

the dark when an adventuring band is confused and split up

by an engagement with another foe, and then appearing on

the scene as a loyal, troubled comrade. Duromil never attempts

this scam when there is even the slightest chance of failure,

and no one in Waterdeep suspects his true nature, a tribute to

his success.

Paerro: Paerro (CN male rock gnome rogue 6/thief-acrobatCA

2), whose real name is Taslythor Rocktapper, of the Rocktappers

of the Earthfasts, emigrated from the backlands of Impiltur

nearly two decades ago. When he  rst arrived in Waterdeep,

he was at loss for what to do, but he eventually found he could

make a reasonable living as a pickpocket in Waterdeeps busy

taverns. That lasted for several years, with Paerro making an

increasing number of trips before Waterdeeps magisters, until

Thear Chessar took pity on him and began teaching him the

art of being a cat burglar. It has now been so long since Paerro

has been caught that the Watch thinks he has left town, and

Paerro and Thear have become fast friends, drinking and thieving

together for fun and sport.

Juzla: Juzla (CE tainted oneMF (yuan-ti) rogue 3/sorcerer

8)  is  a  native  of  Skullport,  born  in  the  Port  of  Shadow.  In

her youth, she survived as a spy, selling secrets to the highest

bidder. After crossing the slaver Zstulkk Ssarmn (see Serpent

Kingdoms  pages  134  and  142),  she  was  captured,  trained  in

sorcery, and transformed into a tainted one. Juzla served Zs-

tulkk as a spy among the followers of Cyric before undergoing

a devout religious conversion to the Dark Suns faith. She then

became a double agent for a time before the slaver discovered

her treachery. Juzla  ed to the surface, where she now makes

a living as a minor spy lord in Waterdeep in the employ of

various guilds and merchants.

ZABBAS THUUL

Zabbas Thuul wears his oily black hair pulled back in a pony-

tail, and his face always shines with sweat and oil. He keeps a

low pro le in Waterdeep, posing as a sycophantic wizard of

minor powers willing to tutor, sell scrolls, or adventure for

the right price. He is an unprincipled thief, willing to steal

from anyone, including his own adventuring companions. He

is adept at arranging alibis; his favorite is to get himself jailed

by the Watch for drunken revelry, then slip out of his cell

with magic to make a theft, stash the loot, and return before

his absence is noted.

Zabbas is a frequent habitu of Skullport as well, earning

lucrative  fees  running  messages  and  acting  as  a  slave-ship

booking agent. He has long worked with the slavers of the Iron

Ring, and he is quickly becoming a relatively trusted agent of

Consul Orgin Ulmokina of the Thayan enclave in Skullport.

Curiously,  Elaith  Craulnobers  honorable  streak  has  actually

opened doors for Waterdeeps other rogue elf, despite the fact

he in no way deserves such a chance. Zabbas rents rooms at the

Blushing Nymph (C81) festhall in Waterdeep and the Burning

Troll inn in Skullport.

Zabbas  Thuul:  Male  moon  elf  rogue  3/wizard  5/  Arcane

Languages: Chondathan, Common, Elven, Illuskan.

Evasion (Ex): If Zabbas is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Impromptu  Sneak  Attack:  Once  per  day,  Zabbas  can

declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak

attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the

impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an

impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but

only against that attack. The power can be used against any

target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take

no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus

to AC against the attack).

Ranged Legerdemain: Using his unique talents, Zabbas can

perform one of the following skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable

Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance

increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and Zabbas cannot

take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh

5 pounds or less. Zabbas can make only one ranged legerdemain

skill check each day.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Zabbas does 4d6 extra points of damage

on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked targets,

or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage  from  critical  hits  are  all  immune  to  sneak  attacks.

Zabbas can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with his sneak

attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose,

such as a sap (blackjack).

Trap nding (Ex): Zabbas can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass

the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Wizard  Spells  Prepared  (caster  level  9th):  0detect

magic,  ghost  sound  (DC  13),  prestidigitation,  read  magic;

1stdetect secret doors, disguise self, hold portal, true strike,

Spellbook: Zabbas knows all of the abjuration, conjuration,

divination, enchantment, illusion, and necromancy wizard spells

in the Players Handbook and many of the permitted wizard

spells in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, Magic of

Faern, and Players Guide to Faern.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Sages and Loremasters

As the gateway to the North and the center of trade along the

northern  Sword  Coast,  one  of  Waterdeeps  most  important

markets is the sale and spread of information, knowledge, and

lore (true or otherwise). However, unlike many other profes-

sions, Waterdeep does not have a guild of sages.

Irbryth Authamaun: Irbryth (CG male Chondathan expert

6) is a sage knowledgeable about such diverse areas as Knowledge

(local Waterdeep), specializing in the minutiae of Waterdeeps

broadsheets, and Knowledge (history), specializing in the history

of Waterdeep. He can be contacted at his home (N62).

Ilighast Chamnabbar: Ilighast (NG male Illuskan wizard 5)

is well-educated in Knowledge (arcana), specializing in magic

traditions, Knowledge (the planes), specializing in the Astral

Plane,  the  Ethereal  Plane,  and  the  Elemental  Planes,  and

Knowledge (history), specializing in the histories of dwarves,

elves, gnomes, and hal ings along the Sword Coast and across

the North. This short, bitter little man is a member of the

Watchful Order, and he spends much of his time hoping to

hear some useful information at the Tower of the Order (C15).

He is incredibly terse, leading some to complain he charges

by the word.

Narthund Delzhour: Narthund (LG male expert 5) studies

the   elds  of  Knowledge  (arcana),  specializing  in  astrology,

astronomy, and numerology, and Knowledge (geography), spe-

cializing in geology and mineralogy. Always found in a tavern,

Narthund is very cheap, charging half his fees in ale, but only

coherent in the early hours of the evening. His favorite tavern

is the Elfstone Tavern (C32).

Jasmal: Jasmal (N female shield dwarf cleric 5 [Dumathoin])

is known for her research in Knowledge (architecture and engi-

neering), specializing in stonecraft and weaponry, Knowledge

(history), specializing in dwarfkind, and Knowledge (nature),

specializing in fauna of the Sword Coast and the North. She

has a light beard and ready smile, unless lied to. She is only

found  in  Waterdeep  in  the  winter  months;  the  rest  of  the

year,  she  wanders  the  North  looking  for  relics  of  Delzoun

and observing the local wildlife. When in the city, she takes

lodging in the Warrens under Dock Ward but is often found

at Selnes Smile (D6).

Vlorn Keenear: Vlorn (N male lightfoot hal ing expert 10)

is a sage known for his studies of Knowledge (history), special-

izing in the folklore, history, languages, legends, and politics

of  hal ingkind,  and  the  politics  and  history  of  humankind

along the Sword Coast, and Knowledge (religion), specializing

in  the  mythology  of  hal ingkind.  Vlorns  sarcastic,  joking

demeanor leaves many clients wondering just how accurate his

information is, but he is invariably correct. Vlorn has a keen

and discerning eye for the intrigues of Waterdeeps nobility,

and his grasp of Waterdeeps intricate politics is near perfect.

Vlorn lives amid the Warrens of Dock Ward, but he is often

found at the Grinning Lion (N56).

Blackrabbas Khuulthund: Blackrabbas (CN male Tethyrian

human expert 7) is a sage knowledgeable about such diverse

areas as Knowledge (nature), specializing in the fauna (birds,

insects) and  ora ( owers, herbs) of the Sword Coast and the

North. Although quite knowledgeable, Blackrabbas is a pompous

windbag given to touting his own horn, which has undermined

his reputation in recent years and forced him to lower his fees.

Blackrabbas is a habitual visitor to the Font of Knowledge (C4)

and keeps a room in a nearby row house.

Javroun Lithkind: Javroun (NE male Chondathan human

expert 9) is very knowledgeable of such  elds as Knowledge

(geography), Knowledge (history), specializing in the history

and  politics  of  humankind,  and  Knowledge  (nobility  and

royalty), specializing in the genealogy of humankind. Jav-

roun is a spiteful, bitter man who consults only to prove his

superiority over his clients after making them wait through

interminable pauses in which he stares silently through his

client while twisting his moustache. Javroun is a regular at

the Font of Knowledge (C4) and keeps a room in a nearby

row house.

Haerun Mhammaster: Haerun (CN male Tethyrian human

expert 12) is a scholar whose studies include Knowledge (history),

specializing  in  the  art,  folklore,  legends,  and  music  of  elves,

dwarves, hal ings, and gnomes, and Knowledge (architecture and

engineering), specializing in dungeons and other underground

construction. This shriveled, hunchbacked old man never leaves

his  library.  He  never  solicits  clients,  but  his  friends  at  the

Elfstone Tavern (C32) direct honest-looking clients to his row

house (C82) nearby.

Kromnlor  Sernar:  Kromnlor  (CN  female  Chondathan

human expert 8) is knowledgeable about such diverse areas as

Healing and Knowledge (nature), specializing in  ora (fungi,

herbs) of the Sword Coast, the North, and the Heartlands. Born

in Sespech, Kromnlor is a wandering midwife who helps the

indigent of Dock Ward with her folk remedies and often clashes

with members of the Guild of Apothecaries & Physicians, who

disagree with her undoubtedly effective methods. Kromnlor

rooms at Warm Beds (D15), but is rarely there except early

in the morning and late at night.

Mirrormul Tszul: Mirrormul (CG male Tethyrian human

expert 7) is well read in Knowledge (nature), specializing in

the biology of humanoids and giantkind. He also speaks many

humanoid and giant languages and can ably Decipher Script.

This excitable, nervous man is prone to inappropriate giggling

and quick speech. He is usually found at the Shrines of Nature

($5), lending aid to the clergy of Silvanus.

Sulphon: Sulphon (N male Illuskan human expert 8) is a

sage knowledgeable about Knowledge (arcana), specializing in

the study of magical beasts, and Knowledge (dungeoneering),

specializing  in  the  study  of  aberrations.  Sulphon  is  a  quiet,

studious  man  who  would  prefer  to  read  one  hundred  books

rather than talk to another individual. He can usually be found

among the stacks at the Font of Knowledge (C4).

Secret Societies

Waterdeep attracts the interest of various secret societies the

same way honey attracts the interest of  ies. As the chief bastion

of civilization, commerce, and military power on the northern

Sword Coast, Waterdeeps dealings affect people for a thousand

miles around.

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

The Harpers

Those Who Harp believe in the power of individuals, the bal-

ance between the wilderness and civilization, and the good of

humankind and its allies. Harpers have played a powerful part

in guiding Waterdeeps energies toward commerce, not conquest.

Despite the groups longstanding ties to the City of Splendors,

the recent formation of the Tel Teukiira has undercut Harper

activities in Waterdeep and divided the loyalties of many Harper

agents, friends, and allies.

Although the number of Harpers based in Waterdeep has

always  been  small,  each  has  a  score  of  individual  contacts,

Harper friends, and secret allies. In addition, many Harpers

regularly pass through the City of Splendors, effectively doubling

or tripling the number of active Harpers in the city at any

given time.

Base of Operations: Although individual Harpers and Harper

friends have innumerable contact points, the group does not have

a permanent home in Waterdeep itself, aside from Harpers Hold.

This secret section of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page

116), hidden beneath the western  anks of Mount Waterdeep,

is now warded against entry by Khelben or Laeral.

Harpers  of  Waterdeep  (Minor  Special):  AL  NG,  CG,  LG;

40,000  gp  resource  limit;  Membership  121  (local,  including

allies); Integrated (humans 45, hal ings 24, elves 22, dwarves

12, gnomes 9, half-elves 6, half-orcs 3); Dues none.

Authority Figure: Eather Heilean (see below). In addition,

Khelben and Laeral still command a great deal of respect from

many rank-and- le Harpers.

Important  Characters:  Alice  Tinker  (see  below);  Bensyl

Iyrivvin (CN female half-moon elf wizard 4/rogue 1/Harper

agentPG 2, lady escort at the Blushing Mermaid [D36]); Bronwyn

Caradoon (see below); Jhandess Millomyr (CG female Tethyr-

ian human bard 7/Harper agentPG 3, harpmaker and owner of

Millomyr Harps [N70]); Nleera Tarannath Tesper (CG female

Illuskan human wizard 7/rogue 1/Harper agentPG 5); Tantuss

Shieldsun (see below); Vedellen Hawkhand (NG male half-sun

elf ranger 11).

Important  Harper  Friends:  Coril  (see  below);  Tioch  (LN

male Tethyrian human  ghter 4, blind beggar who can magi-

cally see Harper pinsMag in full moonlight); and the Defenders

Three: Amstor the Grim (LG male lightfoot hal ing cleric

7 [Arvoreen]), Asohs the Daring (CG male lightfoot hal ing

male rogue 6), and Pithar the Bold (CG male lightfoot hal ing

 ghter 5), who run the Holyhands House (N16).

Associated Classes: Any.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Diplomacy, Gather Informa-

tion, Knowledge (arcana), Listen, Perform, Spellcraft.

Requirements: None.

Fringe Bene ts: The Harpers count many skilled magical

artisans among their friends. Once per character level you can

purchase a single magic item of 50,000 gp or less for 75% of

its normal market price.

Special: Joining the Harpers requires sponsorship by a member

in good standing of Those Who Harp and approval from the

High Harpers.

Members of the Harpers can take the Harper agentPG or Harper

paragonPG prestige class, if approved by the High Harpers and

they meet all requirements.

Coril of Baldurs Gate: Coril (CG fe-male Tethyrian human

wizard 8) is always seen wearing heavy, black robes and carrying

a heavy, metal-bound book under one arm. She seems to be a

handsome, clean-shaven young man, with close-cropped, straight

brown hair and eyes of sparkling lime green hue, but in truth, she

is a woman. Quiet to a fault, Coril is often found in the corners

of Waterdeeps taprooms, simply observing the goings-on and

making copious notes and sketches. Her tome is a collection of

loose papers on which she writes awful verse as well as coded

bits of information for the Harpers.

Coril keeps her spellbooks hidden in a cavity behind a loose

stone in a roof minaret atop Mariners Hall (D44). Coril is the

illegitimate daughter of the wealthy mercenary lord Sarraver

of Baldurs Gate, who has recently rediscovered her whereabouts.

She is loathe to move from Waterdeep to escape his unwanted

attentions, so she is forced to reject the increasingly frequent

efforts of Sarravers servants to bring her back to Baldurs Gate

and marry her off.

Eather Heilean: Born in the Year of the Wandering Maiden

(1337  DR),  Eather  (LG  female  Illuskan  human  paladin

7/Harper paragonPG 10 of Milil, Foe HunterPG feat) wandered

the North as a child until the age of twelve, when her parents

placed  her  in  fosterage  at  Evensong  Tower  in  Berdusk.  She

joined the Harpers at a young age and recently achieved the

rank of High Harper with the backing of Bran Skorlsun and

Belhuar Thantarth.

In the Year of the Unstrung Harp (1371 DR), in a deliber-

ate rebuke to Khelben, the leaders of Twilight Hall dispatched

Eather to Waterdeep to restore order to the Harper ranks

in Waterdeep. Since her arrival, Eather has begun purging the

ranks of those who continue to aid and abet the Tel Teukiira or

who challenge the directives of the High Harpers in Berdusk.

Eather has also stepped up efforts to recruit new Harpers who

are loyal  rst and foremost to Twilight Hall, many of them

recent graduates of New Olamn (C72). Although the change

is gradual, under Eathers direction the Harpers of Waterdeep

have begun to work more openly and align themselves with the

churches of Milil, Oghma, Sune, and Tymora, largely distancing

themselves from Blackstaff Tower and the Tel Teukiira.

Tantuss  Shieldsun:  Tantuss  (NG  male  Illuskan  ranger  10

[Mielikki])  is  tall,  broad-shouldered,  and  barrel-chested,  with

a black hair and a bushy beard. Almost comically shy around

women (particularly the priestesses of the Shrines of Nature),

he is constantly bowing his head in devout prayer to prevent

any  from  seeing  him  blush.  Tantuss  makes  his  living  as  an

adventurer, guiding and defending caravans across the North

and hiring himself out to adventuring bands (although he will

not  enter  tombs  or  private  homes  without  just  cause).  As  a

Harper, he often carries messages from the Ladys Hands to

other servants of the Lady of the Forest across the North. He

also tutors rangers for small fees, donating that which he does

not need to live to the church.

Alice  Tinker:  Alice  (NG  female  rock  gnome   ghter  4/

rogue 1/Harper agentPG 1) works in the Curious Past (C85) as

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

Bronwyns assistant. Skilled at drawing and appraising, she is

also an agent of the Harpers, active in aiding the adventures

and aspirations of Waterdeeps hal ing and gnome communi-

ties. Alices presence has made the Curious Past a popular but

clandestine meeting place for hal ings and gnomes embroiled

in the latest intrigues.

Bronwyn Caradoon: Born in the Year of Moonfall (1344

DR) to Hronrulf and Gwenindale Caradoon, Bronwyn (NG

female  Illuskan  human  rogue  5/Harper  agentPG  4)  is  small

and slim, with an athletic build, long-brown hair pulled back

in a single braid, and large brown eyes. Captured by Zhentarim

slavers as a child, she grew up in Amn and became an adept

counterfeiter of jewelry and coins. After purchasing her free-

dom, she became an antiquities dealer. Recruited to the Harpers,

she moved to Waterdeep, where she divides her time between

tending her shop, the Curious Past (C85), and adventuring in

search of new treasures.

Bronwyn can provide information and lore on little-known

treasures, translation of ancient texts and inscriptions, or discrete

introductions to collectors who operate somewhat left of the

law. She also hears things, so adventurers hired to locate lost or

stolen objects would do well to check with her. Dandies, socialites,

and others who possess an excess of coin will her  nd her shop

a rich trove of unusual jewelry and curiosities. As a member of

Those Who Harp, Bronwyn carries messages and gives aid to

Harpers passing through Waterdeep.

As  a  descendant  of  the  legendary  Samular,  Bronwyn  has

acquired several unusual familial legacies. She holds one of the

three rings of Samular, and she has returned one to the Knights

of Samular. She also holds title to the keep known as Thornhold.

Her estranged brother is Dag Zoreth (born Brandon Caradoon)

of Darkhold (CE male Illuskan human cleric 5/strifeleaderFP 5

[Cyric], Trickery domain), and she is raising his young daughter,

Cara, who owns the third ring.

Bronwyn is not on good terms with the Knights of Samular,

particularly Algorind of Tyr or Sir Gareth Cormaeril, or the

Zhentarim, including her brother and his mentor, Malchior of

Darkhold (see page 38). Through her friend Ebeneezer Stoneshaft

(CN male shield dwarf  ghter 7/rogue 7), Bronwyn is closely

allied with the shield dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft and allows

them to occupy Thornhold as their clanhold.

The Knights of the Shield

The  Knights  of  the  Shield  purport  to  be  a  consortium  of

merchants and nobles interested in manipulating political and

mercantile activity for their own economic gain, but, in truth,

their in uence stems from their ability to acquire, manipulate,

and wield information. Based primarily in Amn, Tethyr, and

Baldurs Gate, their in uence extends from Calimshan and the

Shining Sea to Waterdeep. The Knights hold some notoriety

in the North, for rumors place a disguised evil being from the

lower planes at the head of this group.

The Knights have kept a low pro le in Waterdeep for the

past decade, after a disastrous attempt to overthrow the Lords

resulted in the organization being largely driven from the City

of Splendors.

Bly Ruldegost: The only Knight of any prominence to reside

in the city is Lord Bly Ruldegost (LN male Illuskan human

 ghter 8), a proud and honorable man and the regent of House

Ruldegost. Lord Bly has little interest in overthrowing the Lords

or placing a Knight among their number, and he has blocked

all suggestions to do one or the other. Lord Bly continues his

efforts to recruit other Waterdhavian nobles to the knighthood,

but so far without success, thanks to the quiet whispers of the

various Lords of Waterdeep.

Mather Ukkhemn: Mather (CE male Tethyrian commoner

5) is a fat, egotistical Tethyrian merchant who moonlights as

a slaver and visits Waterdeep on occasion for business. Having

earned the ire of Durnan after staying at the Yawning Portal

(C48) with a pair of slaves, Mather must now keep a very low

pro le on return visits. Mather is a strong advocate of placing a

member of the order among the Lords of Waterdeep, and Lord

Inselm Hhune of Tethyr recently entrusted to him the identity

of a suspected Lord of Waterdeep. After being  rmly rejected

by Lord Bly Ruldegost in any attempt to replace Nindil Jalbuck

with a member of the Knights, Mather revealed Nindils identity

as a Lord of Waterdeep to the Unseen for a tidy sum of money.

(See page 54 for more information on Nindil Jalbuck, and page

57 for more details on the Unseen.) Mather is now terri ed

that Lord Hhune or Lord Bly will discover his treachery and

hold him accountable.

The Kraken Society

The Kraken Society is a shadowy group active in the North

and the islands of the Trackless Sea. They have a well-deserved

reputation in the North for kidnapping, assassination, torture,

and  thuggery,  but  their  focus  is  on  information  gathering

because the organization believes that information is power.

Most  Krakenar  join  the  group  in  order  to  advance  their

own  personal  power  and  wealth,  but  few  suspect  that  the

leader  of  the  organization,  Slarkrethel  (NE  male  kraken

sorcerer 20, Serpah of Umberlee) seeks to build a kingdom

encompassing the depths of the Trackless Sea and the western

coast of Faern.

Local agents of the Kraken Society include the Skum Lord

(LE aboleth sorcerer 6/cleric 7) and Meritid Archneie (CE male

Tethyrian human cleric 15 [Umberlee]; see page 50).

Red Sashes

The  Red  Sashes  are  a  vigilante  group  active  in  Waterdeeps

poorer neighborhoods, particularly Dock Ward. Answering only

to the One (Durnan, see Lords of Waterdeep), the Red Sashes

excel at intrigue, hiding people, and  nding people who do not

want to be found. The Red Sashes appear to work against the

Lords of Waterdeep, but in truth, they often end up serving

the Lords indirectly.

Unlike most vigilantes, the Red Sashes do not act impetu-

ously or excessively. They keep a close eye on Waterdeeps seamy

underbelly, carefully observing the abused and their abusers. If

the Watch seems inclined to step in and actually serve the cause

of justice, then the Red Sashes remain in the shadows. However,

4/22/05   11:20:04 AM

4/22/05   11:20:04 AM

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

if the Watch pursues an innocent person, the Red Sashes might

surreptitiously assist his escape. Likewise, if the Watch seems

disinclined to pursue someone who has committed a crime, the

Red Sashes might apprehend the wrongdoer and deposit him on

the Palace steps. Such public captures both embarrass the Watch

and draw public attention to the case.

The Red Sashes are organized into cells, one per ward, each

answerable  only  to  the  One.  The  Castle,  Trades,  and  Dock

Ward cells are the strongest and most active. Most Red Sashes

only know the identities of their fellow cell members, meaning

that the arrest of the few cannot unravel the whole

organization. Coordination among the various

cells  is  rare  or  nonexistent,  and

sometimes  multiple  cells  have

pursued  the  same  individual.

As the One seems capable of

eluding  all  detection,  magical

or otherwise, the unmasking of a

single cell leader has not yet led to

another cell being penetrated.

Among  the  Lords  of  Wa-

terdeep, only Khelben, Kitten,

Mirt, Nindil, and Sammereza

are aware of Durnans involve-

ment  with  the  Red  Sashes.

The more practical Lords keep

this information away from the

paladins of the group, who would

never approve of the groups meth-

ods. Laeral Silverhand Arunsun

and  the  Unseen  (see  page  57)

are among the few others who

know Durnans secret.

Base of Operations: Various

taverns in Dock Ward.

Joining  the  Red  Sashes  requires  only  an  oath  of  loyalty  to

the One, but this is an organization that approaches potential

members,  not  the  other  way  around.  Invitations  to  join  the

group  are  only  made  after  a  period  of  extended  observation

and  a  series  of  casual  conversations  crafted  to  draw  out  the

potential candidates views. Many members of the group take

the vigilanteCA prestige class.

Baklin: Baklin of Clan Stoneshaft (LN male shield dwarf

 ghter 7) is a stout, bearded dwarf, largely unremarkable among

his kind. He tends bar at the Quaf ng Quaggoth (C53), keeping

an eye on goings-on for the Red Sashes.

Surrolph Hlakken: Surrolph (CG male com-

moner 16/vigilanteCA 1) is a fat, balding

man  with  thick   ngers  who  wears   ne

robes  that  have  long  since  lost  their

original  sheen.  Surrolph  is  a  horse

dealer  at  the  Hlakken  stables  (S17)

and  the  chief  information  gatherer

for the Red Sashes.

Naneatha  Lharilstar:  Naneatha

(NG female Chondathan rogue 6/

vigilanteCA 5) is an olive-skinned

beauty with raven black hair and

striking  green  eyes.  She  works

as a courtesan at the Palace and

owns her own domicile (C45).

Naneatha is the leader of the

Castle Ward cell and one of two

ward leaders who know that the

One is Durnan.

Jurisk  Ulhammond:  Jurisk

(CG male human rogue 5/ ghter

8/vigilanteCA 1) is a mousy-looking

man with a thin, prematurely gray

hair who looks much older than

his  age.  He  favors  ink-stained

robes and endless cups of boiling

hot tea. Jurisk is a moneylender and the leader

of a Trades Ward cell. As one of the most trusted lieutenants

of the One, Jurisk is only one of two Red Sashes who knows

that Durnan is the One.

By chance, Jurisk fell afoul of a greater doppelgangerMF of

the Unseen one month ago during while indulging in a visit

with his favorite courtesan. Jurisks identity is now a faade for

Ptola (see page 58), one of Hlaavins lieutenants. The Unseen

are only beginning to decide what to do with these newly veri ed

suspicions, but it will almost certainly play into Hlaavins efforts

to manipulate the Lords of Waterdeep.

The Tel Teukiira

The Tel Teukiira (an Elven word that translates as Moonstars

or Silverstars) are a group of renegade Harpers and allies of

the Blackstaff who seek to bring together humans, elves, and

PEOPLE OF WATERDEEP

other races against the many dangers lurking in the shadows

of Faern. The members of the Tel Teukiira seek to learn from

the lessons of history, preserving and learning from the lore

of lost civilizations. Although the Lord and Lady Arunsun

still believe that the goals of Those Who Harp are right and

true, the Blackstaff formed the Tel Teukiira to address goals

that range far beyond the scope of Harper activities. In the

Year of the Laughing Swan (816 DR), Khelben, in the guise

of  a  cloistered  monk  of  Candlekeep,  discovered  dire  threats

within Alaundos Prophecies that no one else had ever perceived.

At  rst Khelben hoped to counter these threats through his

shepherding of the Harpers, but over time the group slipped

from his control.

In  the  Year  of  the  Prince  (1357  DR),  Khelben  stole  the

Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings from the Harper vault known

as the Catacombs of Ordulin and replaced it with an illusory

duplicate. Over a decade later, he made sure the Scepter fell into

the hands of Fzoul Chembryl, head of the Zhentarim. Fzoul used

the Scepter to destroy the banelichMF Faram Khaldan. When

Khelbens action was discovered in the Year of the Tankard (1370

DR), the Harpers of Twilight Hall in Berdusk put Khelben on

trial, and the Blackstaff admitted his guilt and resigned from

Those Who Harp. Khelben then founded the Tel Teukiira, put-

ting in motion his long-brewing plan.

Organizationally, the Tel Teukiira shares much in common

with the Harpers, except that the group is under the  rm direc-

tion of the Blackstaff. Laeral has no of cial standing within the

group, but she speaks with authority second only to Khelben.

Reporting directly to the Blackstaff are twelve senior agents,

who meet in conclave every eight tendays and have the individual

authority to shepherd regional and active agents. Thirty regional

agents serve as the eyes and ears of the group, monitoring events

and news within a broad region. Finally, twelve active  eld agents

are in the forefront of the groups activities, implementing the

decisions of the senior agents.

Base  of  Operations:  The  Tel  Teukiira  is  headquartered  at

Blackstaff Tower (C6), but most members live elsewhere in the

Realms and rarely, if ever, physically visit. The groups true base

of operation is the Silver Safehold, an extraplanar stronghold

built by the Sword Heralds of Cormyr and accessible to members

of the group by means of their Teukiir badges*. The Safehold

acts as a central meeting hall for all members, a private meeting

chamber for senior agents, a small dormitory for agents hiding

out from other forces, and a library for the lore to be collected

and shared by the members.

Tel Teukiira (Minor Special): AL NG, LG, LN; 100,000 gp

Associated Classes: Any.

Associated Skills: Concentration, Decipher Script, Knowledge

(arcana), Knowledge (history), Perform, Spellcraft.

Requirements: None.

Favored in Guild Fringe Bene t: The Moonstars count many

skilled magical artisans among their friends. Once per character

level you can purchase a single magic item of 50,000 gp or less

Special: Joining the Tel Teukiira requires the personal invita-

tion of the Blackstaff or Lady Arunsun.

Members of the Tel Teukiira can take the Moonstar agent*

prestige class, if they meet the requirements. Former members

of the Harpers with levels in the various Harper prestige classes

(Harper agentPG and Harper paragonPG) are not considered Ex-

Harpers and do not lose any of their current abilities when

they leave the Harpers for the Moonstars, but they cannot

continue to advance in such classes, re ecting the ambivalent

relationship between the two groups. All Moonstars can acquire

the Blessed of the Seven SistersPG feat, assuming they meet

the prerequisites.

Kylia:  Although  Kylia  (CG  female  rock  gnome  illusionist

12/Moonstar agent* 1) looks like a fragile doll of unassuming

demeanor. With immaculate auburn hair and red robes, she is

one of the Lords most effective agents, having proved her skill

by deducing the identities of nearly all the Lords simply through

observation and then confronting Khelben with the fact. Her

penchant for dramatics when using magic and need for attention

have led her to work far more closely with Laeral than with

Khelben. Kylia plays the role of Liak, a male half-elf apprentice

of Irusyl Eraneth, during forays into the Port of Shadow. The

gnome illusionist rooms at Madam Garahs boarding house (S30)

and The Deep res (LH7) in Skullport.

Winter Zulth: Winter (LN male half-moon-elf wizard 16)

The City of Splendors is home to secret societies,

elite  orders,  masters  of  the  Art,  and  shadowy

organizations.  Many  such  groups  have  unique

prestige classes associated with them.

Of  the  prestige  classes  described  in  the  Dungeon Masters

Guide,  Waterdeep  has  a  higher  than  average  population  of

arcane tricksters, archmages, dragon disciples, eldritch knights,

and  thaumaturgists,  re ecting  its  strong  magical  traditions.

Assassins and shadowdancers are thankfully rare ,but both have

been steadily increasing in numbers since the Time of Troubles.

Blackguards are here and there in positions of power and in u-

ence.  Duelists,  particularly  those  skilled  in  the  Twin  Sword

StylePG, are common among younger nobles. Hierophants and

mystic theurges are uncommon, but not unknown, re ecting

the lesser role played by the clergy in Waterdeep compared to

guilds and arcane spellcasters. Loremasters are fairly common,

particularly since the founding of New Olamn (C72).

Most  of  the  prestige  classes  presented  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting and Players Guide to Faern can be

found in the City of Splendors. (All of the classes mentioned in

the next two paragraphs are from Players Guide to Faern.)

The return of the Shadow Thieves to Waterdeep has resulted

in a sharp spike in the number of shadow thieves of Amn. Harper

agents are not unknown, while Harper paragons are quite rare in

Khelbens hometown. Red wizards, once absent, are now found

in Waterdeeps Thayan enclave.

Divine champions, divine disciples, and divine seekers of any faith

are relatively rare, more likely to be passing through Waterdeep

than residents of the City of Splendors. The Church of Lathander

includes many morninglords of Lathander among its ranks. The

Church of Mystra includes many arcane devotees. Increasing num-

bers of shadow adepts have found a home in the Church of Shar,

re ecting the growth in the number of spellcasters tapping into the

Shadow Weave. The Church of Tyr and the ranks of Waterdeeps

magisters count many justicars of Tyr among their ranks. The Cult

of Ghaunadaur is led by a handful of slime lords.

Other prestige classes found in the City of Splendors include

cognition  thiefPG,  dweomerkeeperFP,  goldeyeFP,  guild  mage  of

WaterdeepMag, heartwarderFP, mage-killerMag, master alchemistMag,

martyred champion of IlmaterPG, maiden of painPG, nightcloakFP,

silverstarFP, Thayan knightLD, Thayan slaverUna, techsmithFP, and

warrior skaldRac.

This chapter presents a number of prestige classes common

to the City of Splendors: the Gray Hand enforcer, the Knight of

the Blue Moon, the Moonstar agent, and the Sun Soul monk.

Gray Hand Enforcer

Come here, little demon, and stop tormenting the nice townsfolk

. . . I will squash you like a bug.

Harshnag the Grim

Gray Hand enforcers are highly trained members of the Gray

Hands,  Waterdeeps  elite,  high-powered   ghting  force.  They

answer only to the Lords of Waterdeep and are selected for their

ability to deal quickly with enemies of unusual personal power.

Through rigorous training, Gray Hand enforcers gain the ability

to shrug off physical damage and magical attacks alike.

Becoming a Gray Hand Enforcer

Barbarians,  ghters, and rangers most commonly become Gray

Hand enforcers, although members of all classes and many races

(particularly  monstrous  humanoids  and  giants)  have  served

among the ranks of the Gray Hands.

The most important requirement of a Gray Hand enforcer

is the ability to deal damage, followed closely by the ability to

take large amounts of damage. Melee-oriented characters should

emphasize Strength and Constitution, while those specializing

in  ranged  or  sneak  attacks  should  focus  on  Dexterity  and

Constitution, and then Strength. Spellcasters are best served by

emphasizing their primary mental attribute to maximize the

number of bonus spells they can cast. Spellcasters should also

focus  on  Constitution  to  improve  their  hit  points  as  well  as

Dexterity and Wisdom to improve their saving throws.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Skills: Intimidate 5 ranks.

Feats: Endurance, Toughness, and either Power Attack or

Empower Spell.

Special: Base attack bonus +7 or ability to cast 4th-level spells.

Special: Must be a member of the Gray Hands (see page 37).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Gray Hand enforcer

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Gray Hand enforcers gain

no pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: A Gray Hand enforcer continues training in

magic. At every Gray Hand enforcer level beyond 1st, you gain

new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells

known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spell-

casting class you belonged to before adding the prestige class.

You do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that

class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting

class before becoming a Gray Hand enforcer, you must decide to

which class you add the new level for purposes of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 1st level, a Gray Hand enforcer

gains damage reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage you take

each time you are dealt damage from a weapon or natural attack.

Damage  reduction  can  reduce  damage  to  0  but  not  below  0.

This ability improves to damage reduction 2/ at 3rd level, and

damage reduction 3/ at 5th level.

Gray  Hand  Token:  All  Gray  Hand  enforcers  are  given  a

small token, usually a clasp, ring, or brooch in the shape of a

human hand,  ngers together and palm out. Civic of cials of

Waterdeep (including Lords, magistrates, and Watch and Guard

of cers) know the token by sight. You gain a +5 bonus on any

Charisma-based skill checks made against an of cer or of cial

TABLE 31: THE GRAY HAND ENFORCER

of Waterdeep if you show the token. A bearer of the token may

not be arrested or hindered in Waterdeep unless the arresting

of cial is a Lord, magistrate, or civilar of the Guard or Watch.

Dragonward  Strike  (Su):  By  calling  upon  the  power  of

Ahghairons dragonward, the Gray Hand enforcer can launch

a mighty attack. Beginning at 2nd level, you can make a single

melee attack with a +4 bonus on the attack roll and a bonus on

the damage roll equal to your Gray Hand enforcer level. You

must declare the strike before making the attack.

Instead  of  using  the  dragonward  strike  to  make  a  melee

attack, you can empower a single spell as if you had applied the

Empower Spell feat. You do not have to prepare the spell as an

empowered spell ahead of time, and this does not increase the

level of the spell. You can use a dragonward strike once per day,

or two times per day beginning at 4th level.

In  either  case,  the  dragonward  strike  is  only  usable

within 10 miles of Waterdeep, since it relies on proximity to

Ahghairons spell.

Spell Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, you gain spell resistance

equal  to  5  +  your  character  level.  For  example,  as  a   ghter

10/Gray Hand enforcer 4, you would have spell resistance 19.

Lords Boon (Su): At 5th level, you gain the ability to heal

your own wounds. You can heal 20 hit points each day. You can

use the healing all at once, or spread it out among several uses.

Playing a Gray Hand Enforcer

You  are  tough  as  nails  and  every  bit  as  dangerous  as  your

reputation suggests. You have earned the trust of Waterdeeps

leaders at great personal risk, and you have little fear of death.

You have no time for moral niceties or negotiation; you trust

the Lords to call you in only when right is on your side and

complete annihilation of the enemy is the only remaining resort.

You are  ercely loyal to the City of Splendors, allowing no one

to besmirch the name or reputation of your great city.

COMBAT

Gray Hand enforcers must deal out large amounts of damage

quickly, regardless of the consequences to the surrounding area.

Gray Hand enforcers are also incredibly tough, able to withstand

large numbers of dangerous attacks without  inching or falling.

For spellcasters, evocation and summoning spells are two quick

ways to take out a foe. Abjuration spells are also important, as

PRESTIGE CLASSES

they allow members of your team to  ght longer. Avoid divina-

tion spells (if it moves, kill itnothing else matters), illusions

(if your reputation doesnt scare your foe, nothing will), and

enchantments (if it was susceptible to reason, you wouldnt be

needed). For melee combatants, make sure you can always get to

your foe (missile weapons or the ability to run, climb, jump, or  y)

and when you do, deal large amounts of damage (big, powerful

weapons with large threat ranges or critical multipliers).

ADVANCEMENT

You want to acquire spells and magic items that enable you to

survive the sorts of  ghts for which the Gray Hands are famous.

Anything else is secondary. If you survive, you will inevitably

advance.

RESOURCES

The Gray Hands are an elite organization, fully

backed  by  Waterdeeps  treasury.  Dont  worry

about collateral damage in service to the Lords;

destruction  of  private  property  is  never  your

concern. If you need a weapon or suit of armor, the

Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors would be

happy to fabricate such for you as quickly as they can.

You must still pay for personal armaments, but simply

having the ear of the citys most powerful spellcasters is

helpful enough.

Gray Hand Enforcers

n the World

The Gray Hands are the elite strike force in the employ of the

Lords of Waterdeep. When called upon, they battle fearlessly

against any threat to the City of Splendors. The Gray Hands

organization is described in detail on page 37.

NPC REACTIONS

Gray Hand enforcers are an unknown quantity outside the City

of Splendors. In Waterdeep, the Gray Hands have acquired

a fearsome reputation. Word that the members of the Gray

Hands have been spotted is enough to send most Waterdhavians

 eeing,  as  any  battle  involving  Gray  Hand  enforcers

is likely to result in a lot of collateral damage and

civilian casualties.

Gray Hand Enforcer Lore

The Gray Hands are well known in the City of Splendors, al-

though their exact role in service to the Lords is the subject of

some confusion. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (local

Waterdeep) check can learn the following information, including

the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Lords of Waterdeep are served by an elite team

of adventurers, known as the Gray Hands.

DC 15: The Gray Hands are dispatched only when the City Watch

or City Guard cannot handle a problem. If you see a large frost

giant heading your way, get out of the area as fast as you can.

Harshnag the Grim, a Gray Hand enforcer

DC 20: The leader of the Gray Hands is the ranger Jardwim.

Hes tough as nails and as in exible as the Blackstaff. He  gures

if the Lords need his merry little band, then things are long

past the discussion stage. Your only hope if you cross the Gray

Hands is to surrender or die.

Gray Hand Enforcers

n the game

Any powerful adventurer resident in Waterdeep and loyal to the

Lords could be a member of the Gray Hands. The team is a

glori ed adventuring band with a low survival rate and a steady

in ux of new recruits.

This prestige class appeals to gamers who like to battle pow-

erful foes using every resource at their disposal. Its especially

appropriate for a Waterdeep-based campaign where the City of

Splendors is under continual threat.

NPC Gray Hand enforcers are always based in Waterdeep,

available to defend the City of Splendors in a moments notice.

ADAPTATION

While the Gray Hands are presented as unique to Waterdeep,

there is no reason you could not create similar organizations

in other wealthy cities such as Baldurs Gate, Suzail, Tantras,

or Tel amm.

ENCOUNTERS

The  Gray  Hand  enforcers  are  most  commonly  encountered

by  renegade  adventuring  companies  who  believe  themselves

powerful enough to mess with anyone without consequence. The

Gray Hands can also be brought in if the PCs take on a foe too

powerful for them in or around the streets of Waterdeep, but the

Gray Hands arent really in the business of rescuing adventurers

who cant take care of themselves.

EL 14: Harshnag the Grim is a typically beefy frost giant

with snow-white skin, light blue braided hair and beard, and

light blue eyes. Exiled from his clan in the Spine of the World

for  his  soft  nature,  Harshnag  wandered  south  to  see  the

world, eventually entering the City of Splendors. Jardwim (see

page 38) was impressed by Harshnags polite response after

the Gray Hands were dispatched to stop Harshnags expected

rampage,  and  he  invited  the  frost  giant  to  join  the  group.

Today, Harshnag lives in a cave atop Mount Sar, linked to

Blackstaff Tower (C6) by a large-sized two-way keyed portal.

Maliantor, a Gray Hand wizard, alerts Harshnag by means

of a sending spell whenever the giant is needed in the City of

Splendors.

Rock Catching (Ex): See Monster Manual page 120.

Lords Boon (Su): Harshnag can heal himself up to 20 hit

points per day. He can use the healing all at once, or spread it

out among several uses.

Swift and Immediate Actions

The  Miniatures  Handbook  introduced  the  concept  of  a

new action type: the swift action. Likewise, the Expanded

Psionics Handbook introduced another new action type: the

immediate action. Some of the prestige class features, spells,

and magic items in City of Splendors use these concepts. A

description of how they work follows.

Swift  Action:  A  swift  action  consumes  a  very  small

amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort

and energy than a free action. You can perform one swift

action  per  turn  without  affecting  your  ability  to  perform

other  actions.  In  that  regard,  a  swift  action  is  like  a  free

action. However, you can perform only a single swift action

per turn, regardless of what other actions you take. You can

take a swift action any time you would normally be allowed

to take a free action. Swift actions usually involve magic or

psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic items; many

characters (especially those who dont use magic or psionics)

never have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. In addition,

casting any spell with a casting time of 1 swift action is a

swift action.

Casting a spell or with a casting time of 1 swift action

does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Immediate  Action:  Much  like  a  swift  action,  an  im-

mediate action consumes a very small amount of time, but

represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a

free action. Unlike a swift action, an immediate action can

be performed at any timeeven if its not your turn. Using

an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a

swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn.

You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action

until after your next turn if you have used an immediate

action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using

an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using

your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use

an immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.

Knight of the Blue Moon

Observe the waxing and waning of the moon, and watch how

the Weave ebbs and  ows in response. Tis the Daughter of the

Moonmaiden responding to the tug of her mothers bosom.

Xale of the Starry Glen

Knights of the Blue Moon are elite soldiers in the endless battle

against  the  Mistress  of  the  Night.  Their  tactics  are  strictly

governed by the phase of the moon, for they are strongest when

the moon is full and weakest when the moon is new. Drawing

on Selnes tidal in uence over the Weave, they attack when

the  moon  is  waxing  and  their  offensive  powers  grow  strong,

and they defend when the moon is waning and their defensive

powers move to the fore.

Becoming a

Knight of the Blue Moon

Cleric/sorcerers and paladin/sorcerers make good Knights of

the Blue Moon, for they combine a diverse array of spontane-

ously cast spells with the ability to channel the divine power

of their deity. Cleric/bards and even ex-bard/paladins can also

become Knights of the Blue Moon, although they are far less

common.

Depending on your base spellcasting class or classes, youll

 nd  that  Wisdom  or  Charisma  remains  your  most  valuable

ability score. If you choose to emphasize your capabilities as a

sorcerer, you might wish to emphasize your Dexterity as well,

allowing  you  to  become  a  ranged  combatant.  Otherwise,  the

usual mix of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are likely to

be as important to you as they are to all melee combatants.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Alignment: Any good.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks,

Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.

Feats: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Lunar Magic*, and

either Weapon Focus (heavy mace) or Exotic Weapon

Pro ciency (shuriken).

Spells: Ability to cast arcane spells spontaneously.

Patron Deity: Selne or Mystra.

Special: Ability to turn undead, membership in the Order of

the Blue Moon (see page 44).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Knight of the Blue

Moon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Knights of the Blue Moon

gain no pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields. Selnes

favored weapon is the heavy mace, which Knights of the Blue

Moon refer to as the moons hand. Mystras favored weapon is the

shuriken, which Knights of the Blue Moon refer to as whirlstars.

Spellcasting: A Knight of the Blue Moon continues train-

ing in magic. When you gain a level in this class, you gain new

spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known,

if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting

class you belonged to before adding the prestige class. You do

not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class

before becoming a Knight of the Blue Moon, you must decide

to which class you add the new level for purposes of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Moon Blessing (Su): During days and nights of the waning

or new moon, you can channel the in uence of Selne over the

Weave to reduce the impact of magic directed at you. At the cost

of a single attempt to turn undead, you receive a sacred bonus

equal to +1 per class level on a single saving throw against a spell

or spell-like ability. Using this ability is an immediate action (see

the sidebar on page 80).

During days and nights of the waxing or full moon, you can

channel the in uence of Selne over the Weave to increase the

impact of magic cast by you. At the cost of a single attempt

to turn undead, you increase the saving throw DC of a single

use of a spell or spell-like ability by an amount equal to your

class level. Using this ability is a swift action (see the sidebar

on page 80).

Special Mount: At 1st level, you can call a special mount.

This ability is identical to the paladin ability of the same name,

except the mount will always match your alignment. Levels of

paladin and Knight of the Blue Moon stack for purposes of

determining the special mounts abilities. In addition, if you do

not have a familiar, levels of sorcerer or wizard also stack for

purposes of determining the special mounts abilities.

Faerie Fire (Sp): At 2nd level, you can use faerie  re, as the

spell, three times per day.

Lunar Sight (Ex): Knights of the Blue Moon of 2nd level

and above have low-light vision. If you already have low-light

vision, you instead gain improved low-light vision, which means

that you see four times as far as a human in conditions of poor

illumination.

Divine Moonlight (Su): At 3rd level, any spell with the light

descriptor is heightened by one level, as if you had the Heighten

Spell feat. The spell does not require a spell slot of higher level

or require you to prepare such spells in advance.

Selnes Foresight (Su): At 3rd level, you can tap into the

prophetic  powers  associated  with  the  moon,  giving  you  a  +2

insight bonus on initiative rolls.

Weavesight (Sp): At 4th level, you can use arcane sight, as

the spell, three times per day.

Moon Kiss (Su): At 5th level, you can channel the silver light

of Selne into weapons or armor you use. When the moon is

waxing or full, at the cost of a single attempt to turn undead,

a  magic  weapon  you  wield  receives  the  property  of  brilliant

energy for 1 round. This use of the ability is a swift action (see

the sidebar on page 80).

When the moon is waning or new, at the cost of a single

attempt to turn undead, armor you wear receives the property of

spell resistance (SR 10 + character level) for 1 round. Using this

ability is an immediate action (see the sidebar on page 80).

Playing a

Knight of the Blue Moon

Although the Lady of Loss can never be defeated, you are a dedi-

cated foe of the forces of darkness, bitterness, and loss, battling

the followers of Shar wherever they appear. Where others see

weakness in the endless waning and waxing of the Moonmaiden,

you see a way to control the ebb and  ow of combat. Where

others are tempted by the dark power of the Shadow Weave, you

see hidden power in the tidal  uctuations of the Weave.

You excel at tactics, always seeking to maximize your advan-

tage over your foes. You see the glass as it is, both half empty

and half full, untroubled by temporary setbacks or inclined to

rash behavior thanks to unexpected victory. You live your life

in accordance with the heavens, advancing when the signs are

favorable and retreating when dire portents beckon.

COMBAT

You live for the chance to battle the followers of Shar, but are

careful to pick your time and your battle eld. You prefer to  nd

a small redoubt and then sally forth for brief periods before

retreating and concentrating on defense.

ADVANCEMENT

Qualifying for the Knight of the Blue Moon class requires a

signi cant number of feats and skill points. Moreover, many

multiclass  combinations  that  work  well  with  the  class  are

relatively weak, specializing in neither combat nor spellcasting.

Regardless  of  how  you  met  the  entry  requirements,  consider

the Extra Turning feat and then focus on either spellcasting or

combat. You should choose your spells to give you a good variety

of offensive and defensive options at every level.

If you want to multiclass while advancing as a Knight of the

Blue Moon, pick one of your base classes and concentrate on

it. Paladins, sorcerers, and wizards are particularly appropriate

second classes if you intend to employ your special mount ability

to great effect.

RESOURCES

The Order of the Blue Moon is relatively new (less than two

decades old) and is concentrated in lands where the church of

Shar is powerful. Although it has little in the way of  nances,

the churches of Selne and Mystra do all they can to support

the Order in such lands.

In general, a Knight of the Blue Moon can obtain healing (or

other spellcasting services) from a cleric of Selne or Mystra at

25% of the normal cost, and his or her companions can obtain

healing at 75% the normal cost.

Knights of the Blue Moon

in the World

The Order of the Blue Moon is a religious organization dedicated

to Selne and Mystra. Based north of Waterdeep, they are a

growing presence in the City of Splendors despite tensions with

the Mystran clergy in the House of Wonder ($21). The Order

of the Blue Moon is described in detail on page 44.

NPC REACTIONS

The Order of the Blue Moon is a relatively new knightly order

in a world that has large numbers of such religious organizations.

Outside the city of Waterdeep, the Orders existence is largely

unknown, and thus most NPCs treat it like any other crusading

orderwith wary regard. Those that do learn something of the

Order in their roles as part of the church hierarchy of Selne

or Mystra are often put off by its perceived heresy of venerat-

ing both Selne and Mystra. Displays of lunar magic engender

great interest among students of the Art, for lunar magic is

relatively unknown among those who study the many ways to

manipulate the Weave.

Knights of the Blue Moon Lore

The Order of the Blue Moon is known in the City of Splendors,

but most folks think it a knightly order that serves a speci c

church, like the Order of the Aster. Characters who succeed on

a Knowledge (local Waterdeep) or Knowledge (religion) check

can learn the following information, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Moonmaidens temple is defended by the Knights

of the Blue Moon, a newly founded religious order.

DC  15:  While  the  Order  of  the  Blue  Moon  is  backed  by

both the Moonmaiden and the Lady of Mysteries, it has much

stronger support from the church of Selne than it does from

the church of Mystra.

DC 20: The Order of the Blue Moon has an isolated chapter-

house on one of the Red Rocks.

Knights of the

Blue Moon in

the game

Given their limited number, the

Knights of the Blue Moon rarely

act in concert. They often have

to hire adventurers, particularly

those with ties to the church of

Selne  or  the  church  of  Mys-

tra, to complete various

missions  on  behalf  of

the  Order.  Sometimes,

a single Knight of the

Blue  Moon  joins  with  a

small company of adventur-

ers to accomplish a goal of

the order. The Knights can

even  be  used  as  a  new  weapon

against the church of Shar.

The Knight of the Blue Moon

prestige class appeals to a player

who likes a variety of capabili-

ties and the challenge of making

tactical  decisions.  The  prestige

class  is  appropriate  for  those

who  like  their  characters

to  ght on the side of right

against  an  endless  tide  of

darkness.  Your  adventures

dont  all  need  to  be  con-

sumed with the battle against

the  Church  of  Shar.  Just  make

sure that a variety of tactics will

be required over the course of your adventures. Some should

demand  aggressive action and others a stout defense.

ADAPTATION

While  the  Knights  of  the  Blue  Moon  are  dedicated  to

Selne  and  Mystra,  deities  worshiped  chie y  by  humans,

you can easily change the patrons of the order to Corellon

Larethian and Sehanine Moonbow. Simply change the last

feat requirement to Weapon Focus (longsword) or Weapon

Focus (quarterstaff).

ENCOUNTERS

Knights of the Blue Moon are most commonly encountered as

potential allies for player characters, particularly when the PCs

are taking on the minions of Shar. The Knights are a particularly

useful ally for characters who have begun to run afoul of the

Shadow Weave and need to counter its pernicious in uence.

EL 16: High Moonknight Xale of the Starry Glen stands

well over 6 feet tall. He has jet-black hair streaked with silver,

piercing blue eyes, and fair skin that gleams with a silvery

radiance. Xale favors deep blue

cloaks, silken shirts, and tailored

breeches, all cut in the style of

ancient Netheril.

The High Moonknight is a

native  of  Selnarra,  a   oating

city  that  escaped  the  Fall  of

Netheril when the Moonmaiden

transferred the city and all its

inhabitants to the Gates of the

Moon. Over time, the Netherese

interbred with other inhabitants

of Selnes domain, resulting in

a  race  of  extraplanar  aasimar

that still reside there today. Xale

was unusual among his fellows in

that he chose to worship Mystryl

(as  Mystra  is  still  known  to

the  Selnarrans),  although  he

continued to honor Selne.

Some  years  ago  (at  the  end

of the Time of Troubles), Xale

found himself beneath a starry

sky he did not recognize amid

the  trees  of  an  elven  wood-

land  (Ardeep  Forest).  In

the sky, he saw a vision of

a full moon surrounded by

a ring of seven stars that

seemed to be leading him

north  and  west.  In  time,

Xale came to the City of

Splendors  and  made  his

way to the House of Wonder.

He  continued  to  experience

visions  of  the  moon,  however,

which led him to the House of

the Moon as well. Once he learned of a vision shared by the

two  churches  of  a  knightly  order  dedicated  to  opposing  the

machinations of Shar, Xale immediately volunteered to lead the

new order, seeing it as the realization of his calling.

Moonstar Agent

Despite  the  self-aggrandizing  puffery  of  those  windbags  at

Twilight Hall, the Blackstaff stands, as ever, unbowed. But then

again, thats what makes him so much fun to tease.

Kyriani Agrivar

Moonstar agents, also known as Teukiir, are members of the

Tel Teukiira, a group founded in the Year of the Tankard (1370

DR) by Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun when he broke from the

Harpers. Similar in many ways to Those Who Harp, Moonstar

agents combine a keen understanding of history with a knack for

spying on chosen targets and acquiring powerful artifacts. The

group receives the blessings of three deities long favored by the

Blackstaff: Mystra, Oghma, and Sehanine Moonbow. In addition,

Khelben and his consort, Laeral Silverhand Arunsun, perform

arcane rituals reminiscent of elven high magic on members of

the group, giving them special magical abilities.

Becoming a Moonstar Agent

Bards, bard/rangers, bard/rogues, rogue/sorcerers, and rogue/wiz-

ards all make good Moonstar agents, for they combine a wide

array  of  skills  with  arcane  spellcasting  ability.  Single-classed

sorcerers  and  wizards,  ranger/sorcerers,  ranger/wizards,  and

other bard multiclass options can also become Moonstar agents,

although they are less common.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Depending on your base arcane spellcasting class, you will  nd

that Intelligence or Charisma remains your most valuable ability

score. You will also  nd that the art of gathering information,

dodging surprise attacks, and manipulating others requires equal

parts Dexterity and Charisma.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Skills: Decipher Script 4 ranks, Gather Information 4 ranks,

Knowledge (history) 8 ranks.

Feats: Investigator, Stealthy.

Spells: Ability to cast disguise self and identify.

Special: Bardic knowledge, lore (loremaster class feature or any

similar ability), Harper knowledge, or ability to cast legend lore.

Special: Member of the Tel Teukiira (see page 75).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Moonstar agent

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Moonstar agents gain no

pro ciency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: When a new Moonstar agent level is gained,

you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and

spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in

a spellcasting class you belonged to before adding the prestige

class. You do not, however, gain any other bene t a character of

that class would have gained, except for an increased effective

level of spellcasting. This essentially means that you add the

level of Moonstar agent to the level of some other spellcasting

class you have, then determine spells per day, caster level, and

spells known accordingly.

Lore (Ex): Like a bard, a Moonstar agent has a knack for

picking up odd bits of knowledge. This ability works exactly like

the bardic knowledge ability of the bard class. If you have bard

levels (or levels in another class with the same ability, such as

loremaster or Harper agent), your Moonstar agent levels and

bard levels (or levels in the other appropriate class) stack for the

purpose of using Moonstar agent knowledge.

Oghmas Insight: As masters of obscure lore, Moonstar agents

develop a keen interest in many  elds. You gain Skill Focus in

any one Knowledge skill as a bonus feat.

TABLE 33: THE MOONSTAR AGENT

Laerals  Intuition  (Sp):  At  2nd  level,  you  can  use  detect

thoughts, as the spell, three times per day.

Mystras Boon (Su): At 3rd level, you gain a +2 sacred bonus

on all saving throws against spells.

Khelbens Call (Sp): At 4th level, you can use sending, as the

spell, as a standard action once per day.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): When you reach 5th level, you retain

your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught

 at-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (You still lose any

Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

If you gain uncanny dodge from a second class, you automatically

gain improved uncanny dodge (see Players Handbook page 50).

EX-MOONSTAR AGENTS

Any Moonstar agent who violates the code of the Tel Teukiira,

endangers other Telkiir through negligence or deliberate action,

or intentionally turns away from the Tel Teukiira quickly gains a

reputation in the organization. Such an individual can no longer

progress in the Moonstar agent prestige class. Furthermore, he

can no longer use the supernatural or spell-like abilities of the

class. A petition to Khelben Arunsun, ful llment of a suitable

quest set by the Blackstaff, and an atonement spell from a cleric

of a deity chosen by Khelben brings the former Moonstar agent

back into good standing. Thereafter, she regains the use of all class

abilities and can once again gain levels in the prestige class.

MOONSTARS AND HARPER AGENTS

Characters with levels in the Harper agentPG prestige class can

take levels in the Moonstar agent prestige class without losing

any of their Harper agent abilities, and vice versa.

Playing a Moonstar Agent

Faern is endlessly awash in the sweep of history, and once again

the tides of change are rushing forward. You see the broad strokes

of historical experience, placing the complications of today in

the context of yesteryear. While time might march inexorably

forward, the actions of a few can change the course of history,

for weal or woe. Seek understanding of the context of what you

do and the inexorable chain of events your actions precipitate.

Do not worry overmuch regarding the immediate concerns of

today, or tomorrow might not dawn.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

COMBAT

Your greatest weapons are knowledge of the past and understand-

ing of the present; your skill is in knowing how to use that

understanding to your advantage. Master the Art, but use it

wisely, for the ostentatious use of magic will only draw attention

to your activities. Spells of divination and illusion serve to both

reveal the actions of your foes and shield your own activities in

turn. Do not attack directly if another hand can be directed to

serve the purpose. Watch from the shadows, emerging only to

whisper in the right ear or subtly manipulate a situation.

ADVANCEMENT

You want to acquire spells and magic items that help you gather

information and shield your activities from the prying eyes of

others.  Spells  such  as  arcane  eye,  clairaudience/clairvoyance,

detect thoughts, and scrying enable you to spy on your foes from

afar. Spells such as comprehend languages, disguise self, invis-

ibility, pass without trace, silence, and tongues enable surreptitious

information gathering. Spells such as analyze dweomer, identify,

and  legend  lore  allow  you  to  investigate  artifacts,  and  spells

such  as  message,  sending,  and  whispering  wind  allow  you  to

communicate with your fellows over long distances.

Skills such as Hide, Gather Information, and Move Silently

facilitate your ability to gather information, while Knowledge

(arcana) and Knowledge (history) allow you to understand the

lost magical lore of ancient civilizations. Bluff, Diplomacy, and

Sense Motive allow you to manipulate others for the long-term

ends of the Tel Teukiira.

RESOURCES

Although the Tel Teukiira is a young group, it can call upon all

the resources of the Blackstaff, not to mention their powerful

colleagues. In practice, this means Moonstar agents have access to

the vast magical resources of Blackstaff Tower (C6), albeit only in

cases of demonstrable need, and indirect access to the resources of

Those Who Harp (primarily through Harpers who are inclined

favorably to the Tel Teukiira) and the Lords of Waterdeep (of

which  Khelben  and  Kyriani  Agrivar  are  members).  Moonstar

agents can employ either Blackstaff Tower or (assuming they have

a Teukiir badge) the Silver Safehold as a refuge when needed.

Moonstar Agents in the World

The  Tel  Teukiira,  which  translates  to  Moonstars  in  the

common tongue, is a shadowy group of ex-Harpers who broke

from Those Who Harp to pursue the mysterious objectives of the

Blackstaff. The Tel Teukiira is described in detail on page 75.

NPC REACTIONS

The Tel Teukiira is a secretive group that few have even heard

of. If a hero is revealed to be a member of the Tel Teukiira,

most  NPCs  would  mistake  them  for  Harpers  in  the  service

of the ever-meddling Blackstaff. Most Harpers of the North

and the Dalelands remain favorably inclined toward Khelben

and any agents who serve in his employ. In contrast, Harpers

closely af liated with Twilight Hall in Berdusk are likely to

view members of the Tel Teukiira as traitors (if they are ex-

Harpers) or untrustworthy (if they are revealed to serve the

traitorous Blackstaff).

Moonstar Agents Lore

The Tel Teukiira are well hidden in the City of Splendors because

the group works hard to hide its existence, and the bulk of the

groups activities and agents are located in cities across Faern.

Characters  who  succeed  on  a  Gather  Information  check  can

learn  the  following  information,  including  the  information

from lower DCs.

DC 15: Ever since he resigned from the Lords, the Blackstaff

has been assembling a private army of meddlers even worse than

Those Who Harp.

DC 25: The Tel Teukiira are behind the fall-off in Zhentarim

activity in western Faern. The Blackstaff and his agents made

some deal with the tyrant of the Moonsea to divide control of

the Realms.

Characters who learn the name Tel Teukiira and succeed on a

Knowledge (history) check can learn the following information.

DC  25:  Amagals  Tome,  an  ancient  Elven  text  of  early

Cormanthor, notes that the Tel Teukiira will come hidden and

in many guises and faces. They dwell in shadow and speak in

omens, yet they shall bring about waking dreams and save us

from the Three Threats Who Wait in Darkness, the Prefects,

and ourselves.

Even members of the Tel Teukiira are uncertain as to what

this means, although most suspect that Khelben knows and does

not say.

Moonstar Agents in the game

Most  high-ranking  Teukiir  are  not  (yet)  members  of  the

Moonstar  agent  prestige  class,  although  new  recruits  usually

take at least one level of the class. NPC Moonstar agents can be

found in small numbers in cities and kingdoms across Faern,

although the largest concentration of such characters is found

in Waterdeep and the North.

The  Tel  Teukiira  works  best  as  a  mysterious  organization

operating behinds the scenes. The Moonstars might be engaged

in a silent war in the shadows with an evil group, leaving the

PCs to untangle what is going on when they chance upon such

activity. The Tel Teukiira can also act as patrons (or manipula-

tors) of the characters, overtly or indirectly guiding them into

new adventures that ultimately serve the Blackstaffs aims. The

Tel Teukiira can also be used as foes (at least initially) if the PCs

are dispatched by the Harpers of Twilight Hall to uncover the

plots of the Blackstaff.

ADAPTATION

While the Tel Teukiira is presented as an offshoot of the Harpers

founded and run by the Blackstaff, they can easily be adapted

to serve the role of a private army of in ltrators and spies. By

dint of their personal power, many mages across Faern believe

themselves entitled to manipulate the affairs of their neighbors.

An archmage who succeeds in establishing such a group might

assemble a coterie of followers with powers similar to that of

the Moonstars.

ENCOUNTERS

Moonstar agents are most commonly encountered individually.

They can act as patrons for the PCs, commissioning or suggesting

the recovery of lost lore from an ancient ruin. They can act as

manipulators, subtly or not, who attempt to use the characters

to accomplish a particular goal. They can also act as spies, watch-

ing and observing the PCs or their foes. In the latter case, the

characters might blunder into an ongoing Moonstar operation,

forcing the Moonstar agent to adapt

to the new situation.

EL 14: Kyriani Agrivar is the

stunningly  attractive,  gray-eyed

daughter  of  the  late  wizard  Ostus

Agrivar  and  a  drow  sorceress  of

Shadowdale. The lascivious and

mischievous Kyriani has come

to  grips  with  her  dual  nature

after twice separating into twin

aspects  of  good  and  evil.

When  adventuring,

Kyriani  tucks  up  her

shimmering  silver-

white  hair  away  from  her

face  and  favors  high  boots,

form- tting leather armor,

and  a  cape.  She  prefers

expensive,  off-the-

shoulder   oor-length

gowns  when  attend-

ing parties or services

at  the  House  of  the

Moon ($56), or some

compromise  between

these  extremes  when

tending bar at Selnes Smile (D6), a tavern she inherited from

Luna (an avatar of Selne) and now lives above.

Since the departure of Luna, Kyriani has begun an apprentice-

ship under Lady Alathene Moonstar (see page 62) and made

rapid progress with her command of the Art. Although most of

Kyrianis former adventuring companions are in Tethyr, having

marched south with Haedrak and fought in the Reclamation

Army,  Kyriani  still  sees  them  and  her  half-brother,  Priam

Agrivar (LG male Illuskan human paladin 10), from time to

time. Kyriani chose to remain in Waterdeep, where she has a

veritable army of lovers and a lingering loyalty to the city in

which Luna chose to reside.

After her companions departed, Kyriani rose quickly among

the ranks of worshipers at the House of the Moon to become the

most in uential layperson in Waterdeeps church of the Moon-

maiden. Now that Luna has returned to the outer planes, Kyriani

has taken over her former tavern. Kyriani was invited to become

a Lord of Waterdeep in the Year of the Banner (1368 DR), after

Danilo Thann (see page 63) resigned. Danilo requested that his

replacement represent the Fair Folk of Waterdeep, and Piergeiron

87

chose Kyriani for her ability to span both worlds. Kyriani is also

an  agent  of  the  Tel  Teukiira,  and  she  works  closely  with  the

Blackstaff on a variety of covert activities in that capacity.

Sun Soul Monk

Look  within  for  the  dawning  light  of  the  Morninglord,  the

twinkling diamonds of the Moonmaidens raiment, and the shim-

mering corona of Lady Firehairs beauty. Let it shine forth from

your soul, and the Yellow God shall be reborn through you.

Kadila adh Vitendi

Monks of the Sun Soul Order believe that they each harbor a

small fragment of the suns divine essence, long absent from

the Realms. Brothers and sisters of the Order of the Sun Soul

are trained to tap into the spiritual light withina tradition

that developed during Amaunators slow declineand manifest

it externally. The monks are loosely af liated with the faiths

of Lathander, Selne, and Sune, and they share many common

concerns with those churches. Staunch opponents of darkness,

evil, and chaos, the Sun Soul monks serve as crusaders against

churches  of  evil  deities,  defenders  of  the  common  folk,  and

protectors of sites sacred to deities of light and good.

Becoming a Sun Soul Monk

Monks  and  monk/paladins  make  the  best  Sun  Soul  monks.

They are uniquely suited to the asceticism and discipline of the

order. Cleric/monks are not uncommon among the followers of

the Morninglord, but are exceedingly rare among the followers

of  Selne  and  Sune  because  one-step  alignment  restrictions

require such a character to be either an ex-monk or an ex-cleric.

Clerics,  ghters, paladins, rogues, and multiclass combinations

thereof occasionally join the order, but their total collective

numbers are small.

As with any combat-oriented character, you will  nd that a

high Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity will serve you well.

You will also want a high Wisdom to maximize the use of your

inner  re combat abilities.

ENTRY REQUIREMENTS

Alignment: Lawful good or lawful neutral.

Base Save Bonuses: Will +4.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks,

Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks.

Languages: Ignan, Loross.

Feats: Athletic, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist.

Patron Deity: Lathander, Selne, or Sune.

Special: Member of the Order of the Sun Soul (see page 41).

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the Sun Soul monk

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Sun Soul monks are pro -

cient with all simple weapons, but gain no new pro ciency with

any armor. You can treat a light mace as a special monk weapon

for the purpose of your  urry of blows ability.

Monk Abilities: Sun Soul monk levels stack with monk levels

for purposes of determining  urry of blows, unarmed damage,

AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus (see Table 310, page

40 of the Players Handbook).

Sun Soul (Sp): You gain the ability to radiate magical light,

equivalent in effect to a daylight spell with a duration of 1 minute

per caster level, once per day per Sun Soul monk level. You and

your clothing are the object from which the light emanates.

Your caster level is equal to your combined monk, paladin, and

Sun Soul monk levels.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  you  gain  low-light

vision if you dont already have it.

Sun Soulray (Sp): At 2nd level, you gain the ability to radiate

and project a blast of light from an open palm, equivalent in

effect to a searing light spell. Treat the caster level as equivalent

to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels. At

4th level, you can use this ability two times per day; at 6th level,

three times per day; and at 8th level, four times per day.

Flaming Fists (Su): At 3rd level and beyond, you can channel

your inner light into your unarmed attacks as a swift action (see

page 80), giving them the  aming weapon special ability for a

number of rounds equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1).

See the Dungeon Masters Guide, page 224.

At 6th level, you can use this ability two times per day, and

you  bestow  the   aming  burst weapon  special  ability  on  your

unarmed attacks.

At 9th level, you can use this ability three times per day. You

can choose to bestow either the  aming burst or brilliant energy

weapon special ability on your unarmed attacks.

Abundant  Step  (Su):  At  5th  level  or  higher,  you  can  slip

magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door,

combined monk and Sun Soul monk levels (rounded down).

Greater Sun Soul (Sp): At 7th level, you gain the ability to

wreathe yourself in  ames, equivalent in effect to a  re shield spell

(warm version), once per day. Treat your caster level as equivalent

to your combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels.

Darkvision (Ex): At 8th level, you gain darkvision out to 60

feet if you dont already have it.

emit dazzling beams of light, equivalent in effect to a sunbeam

spell, once per day. Treat your caster level as equivalent to your

combined monk, paladin, and Sun Soul monk levels.

Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): At 10th level, you can

speak with any living creature.

EX-SUN SOUL MONKS

A Sun Soul monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels

as a Sun Soul monk, but retains all Sun Soul monk abilities.

Like a member of any other class, a Sun Soul monk can

be a multiclass character, but multiclass Sun Soul monks face

a special restriction. A Sun Soul monk can gain levels in one

other class (other than monk) and still progress as a monk or

as a Sun Soul monk, as long as long as his combined monk and

Sun Soul monk levels exceed all other class levels.

Playing a Sun Soul Monk

You  are  a  dedicated  servant  of  the  common  man,  eschewing

ostentatious  consumptions  of  wealth,  food,  or  libation.  You

almost never despair, no matter how dark things seem, for you

have discovered your spiritual light within. You see yourself as

a custodian of the suns divinity and the inheritor of an ancient

tradition, awaiting the day the sun returns to its proper glory and

banishes the spiritual shadow from the world.

COMBAT

You relish unarmed combat, particularly against foes vulnerable to

 re, for in such battles you can truly unleash your inner  re. Thanks

to your training, you can also use spell-like abilities that burn your

enemies, a potent combination unexpected by most foes.

ADVANCEMENT

Qualifying for the Sun Soul monk class requires a signi cant

commitment of skill points. As you gain levels, you probably

want to catch up in some of the more physical skills, including

Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble. Moreover, you might  nd

you have missed out on some combat feats as well. The order is

known for its employment of the Sun SchoolCW tactical feat; it

is suggested that you acquire it as soon as you qualify.

If you want to multiclass as you advance, consider taking levels

in monk or paladin. Many of your abilities stack with levels in

these classes, so doing so maximizes your potential.

RESOURCES

Although  scattered  and  somewhat  disorganized,  the  Order  of

the Sun Soul is known to most regions of Faern. As a result, it

should be available to you no matter where you go. In general, a

Sun Soul monk can obtain healing from a cleric of Lathander at

25% of the normal cost, and from a cleric of Selne or Sune at

50% of the normal cost. Her companions can obtain healing at

75% of the normal cost. A Sun Soul monk can obtain free room

and board for herself (for any length of stay) and her companions

(for one night) at any of the orders monasteries across Faern.

Sun Soul Monks in the World

The Order of the Sun Soul is a monastic order spread across

Faern. A monk with controversial beliefs about Amaunator,

Lathander, Selne, and Sune leads the chapter in Waterdeep. The

Order of the Sun Soul is described in detail on page 41.

NPC REACTIONS

The monks who join the Order of the Sun Soul are only one

of many monastic and knightly orders found across Faern.

Few  commoners  know  much  about  the  differences  between

these organizations, so Sun Soul monks are treated much as

any  other  nonevil  monks;  most  people  admire  their  single-

mindedness of purpose and dedication, but think that they are

somewhat aloof.

Members  of  the  church  of  Lathander  welcome  Sun  Soul

monks as allies because the two organizations have fought side

by side in many battles against the undead and other forces of

evil. Members of the churches of Selne and Sune also view the

Sun Soul monks as allies, but see the monks ways as inscrutable

and overly rigid. In Waterdeep, all three churches view the Order

of the Sun Soul with suspicion because the local leader of the

order has been preaching heresy, although the gods have yet to

strike him down for doing so.

Sun Soul Monk Lore

The Order of the Sun Soul is closely af liated with the church

of Lathander and loosely af liated with the churches of Selne

and Sune. Characters who succeed on a Knowledge (religion) check

can learn the following information, including the information

from lower DCs:

DC 10: The Order of the Sun Soul is a widely scattered sect

encompassing worshipers of the Morninglord, the Moonmaiden,

and Lady Firehair.

DC 15: Monks of the Sun Soul Order are dedicated servants of

the common folk, a tradition stretching back many generations.

DC 20: Monks of the Sun Soul Order can visibly manifest

their  spirits  in  the  form  of  light  or   re.  According  to  their

teachings, everyone harbors a tiny piece of the golden, life-giving

sun in his or her soul.

DC 30: The Order of the Sun Soul dates back to the time of

Netheril. The order, once known as the Brotherhood of the Sun,

evolved into its current form after the death of Amaunator.

The Order of the Sun Soul is not particularly secretive, but a

great deal of confusion surrounds its teachings because of its

division into three sects, each venerating a different deity. Even

members of the order are often unaware that the order once

served the church of Amaunator.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Sun Soul Monks in the game

The Order of the Sun Soul is well suited for PC monks and

monk/paladins. Even if none of the PCs belong to the brother-

hood, the order is always seeking out lost Netherese religious lore

and individual sects regularly hire adventurers to recover lost

texts believed to date back to the orders earliest days.

The Sun Soul monk appeals to players who like to roleplay

virtuous, athletic characters with a dash of magic,  ash, and

mystery.  Make  sure  you  provide  ample  opportunity  for  the

Sun Soul monk to shine in unarmed combat, perhaps

by pitting her against a monk of a rival order.

NPC Sun Soul monks typically inhabit monasteries

hidden in far- ung wilderness areas but spend much

of their time wandering the Realms while serving

the common folk. Some members of the order are

assigned  to  prominent  temples  of  Lathander,

Selne, or Sune, and thus they make their home

within the major cities of Faern.

ADAPTATION

While the Sun Soul monk is

presented as loosely af liated

with  three  churches  con-

cerned with the heavens, you

could easily adapt the class to

other gods. For example, if the

order were af liated with Auril,

you  could  change  the  allowed

alignments  to  LN  and  LE,  replace

the   aming  and   aming  burst  abilities  with

frost and icy burst, change  re shield to the chill

version,  and  replace  the  searing  ray  ability  with

shivering touchFB.

ENCOUNTERS

Sun Soul monks are most likely encoun-

tered as allies of the PCs, particularly when the

characters are searching for the legacies of

ancient Netheril. On occasion, Sun Soul

monks might clash with the PCs over

possession  of  a  religious  text  dating

back to the orders earliest days.

EL 10: Righteous Sister Kadila

adh Vitendi was born in Teshburl,

the  illegitimate  daughter  of  Mond  el  Vitendi,

now the Sultan of Teshburl, and a jhasina (harem slave). She was

raised in the harem and trained as a jhasina before her father sold

her to a distant cousin in Memnon. While crossing the Calim

Desert, bandits attacked the caravan she was in, and Kadila  ed

in the confusion. Working as a courtesan in taverns and inns

along the way, Kadila made it to Waterdeep, the legendary city

of the North she remembered from her mothers tales.

Initially, Kadila sought refuge in the House of Sune, the fair-

haired goddess venerated by her mother. There she encountered

Hanor Kichavo, Monastic Abbot of the Sun Soul Order. Naturally

slim, graceful, and athletic and in search of something in which

centuries, others last for less than a tenday. The

following is a brief overview of the more permanent locations

in  Waterdeep.  While  hundreds  of  locations  are  noted  below,

most are left for the Dungeon Master to de ne, as best be ts

the campaign.

System of Wards

Since the Year of Falling Stars (1035 DR), Waterdeep has been

divided for the purposes of governance and security into a system

of wards or civic districts. Although no formal boundaries mark

their borders, the six recognized wards of Waterdeep are Castle

Ward, Dock Ward, North Ward, Sea Ward, Southern Ward, and

Trades Ward. The City of the Dead is nearly a seventh ward

unto itself, and Deepwater Harbor and the surrounding islands

form an informal eighth ward.

The map on page 93 shows the wards of the city and the

boundaries between them. Other maps in this chapter are en-

largements of  sections of the ward map.

Waterdeep Structures

Buildings in the city are detailed in the following format:

Map Key: Name (usage, building class, # of  oors)

Building Class

Building class is an arti cial categorization of structures into

one of four groups (described below), suf cient to allow the DM

to describe the building on the  y.

Class A Buildings: Class A buildings are always unique and

distinctive landmarks of any scale. Most, however, are of a large

and grandiose nature, almost built as much for show as for use.

Examples  include  the  citys  public  structures,  major  temples,

and the nobles villas.

Class B Buildings: Class B buildings cover the larger, more

successful and elaborate single buildings within the city. They

have up to six stories, and might have extensive cellars (usually

connected to the sewers at some point). Most inns and guildhalls

fall into this class. Examples include grand houses and mansions,

prosperous businesses, large warehouses, and the guildhalls.

Class C Buildings: The great majority of buildings in Water-

deep are Class Cthe tall row houses that line the streets to

heights up to  ve stories. Row houses usually have shops on the

ground  oor, with of ces or apartments above that. While not

always multi-story row houses, this class includes many of the

better-kept taverns and rooming houses in the city as well.

Class  D  Buildings:  Class  D  buildings  are  lesser  buildings,

usually one-story wooden buildings used as small warehouses,

individual homes, and storage sheds for Waterdeeps lower classes.

Such buildings are mainly found in Dock Ward, southernmost

Castle Ward, and, in smaller numbers, in Southern Ward and

Trades Ward.

Sea Ward

Waterdeeps wealthiest ward is notable for the many-spired, grand

homes of the nobility, the gleaming edi ces of the citys leading

temples, and the imposing towers of the citys premier wizards.

Other notable landmarks include the Field of Triumph ($77),

the lush Heroes Garden ($70), and the Seas Edge Beach.

SEAS EDGE BEACH

Originally just an area of mud  ats on the citys western seaside,

the area south of the West Gate ($72) has been covered with

sand and turned into a beachfront. While only used as such at the

height of summer when water temperatures rise to near-tolerable

levels, Seas Edge Beach is also used for re ection, solitude, and

as the terminus of Aurils Blesstide Cliffs Run.

HEROES GARDEN ($70)

Waterdeeps only public park outside the City of the Dead is a

large, lush area of grass, trees, and ponds once covered by the

sprawling school of wizardry known as the Tower of Yintros.

A number of statues decorate the area, including large marble

statues to the Open Lords Baeron and Lhestyn (in her guise as

the Masked Lady). It is often the scene of adventurers retelling

tales of their exploits to others and attendant local children. The

watch and the local citizenry tend to the park, which means they

keep the park free of debris and prevent would-be heroes from

carving their names into the trees. (The Company of Crazed

Venturers did so anyway several decades back.)

The Catacombs of Yintros (see page 115) lie beneath Heroes

Garden.

FIELD OF TRIUMPH ($77)

This huge open-air stadium is the site of many spectacles staged

for the populace of Waterdeep. From late spring to late autumn,

thousands  of  people   ood  through  the  awe-inspiring  Lion

Gate to witness shows of magic, martial skills, horse races, and

monstrous exhibitions of creatures big and small. The Field also

acts as a public forum for such important public events as the

Open Lords proclamations to the city and special gatherings for

foreign dignitaries.

North Ward

Waterdeeps quietest ward is also one of its wealthiest. North

Ward  is  home  to  most  of  the  middle  class  and  lesser  noble

families. This ward has few notable landmarks other than the

Cliffwatch, and it all but shuts down at dusk. This placid reputa-

tion belies the intrigues and scheming that goes on behind closed

doors, and the volumes of smuggled goods that lie in cellars

beneath the city streets.

CLIFFWATCH

This sheer 100-foot cliff presents a beautiful view of the coun-

tryside east and south of Waterdeep, and it provides a valuable

defense  against  invading  orcs  and  trolls.  Guards  in  Endcliff

Tower (N80) and the Watchway Tower (CD11) carefully watch

the cliffs edge, which is unobstructed by walls or rails.

THE GRINNING LION (N56)

Tucked away inside a block of homes and businesses, this place,

adorned with (faked) battle trophies from all over Faern, is as

raucous as taverns get in North Ward. An old joke claims the

Riven Shield Shop (T4) sends all shields beyond repair to hang

on the walls here.

The music is loud, with male and female dancers in fantastically

styled and revealing mock armor swaying and pirouetting among

the tables. Real, if broken, weapons hang on the walls everywhere,

so bouncers swiftly discourage any disputes. Folk come here to

drink zzar and wine and eat fried onions and eels.

The proprietor is Unger Farshal (NE male Tethyrian human

 ghter 8), and regulars in attendance include Hala Myrt (an

agent of Lord Orlpar Husteem; see page 50) and Vlorn Keenear

(see page 72).

WATERDEEP LOCALES

Castle Ward

Castle Ward lies in the heart of Waterdeep, wrapping around the

eastern slopes of Mount Waterdeep. This ward is home to the

citys administrative buildings and buildings of state. The wards

most prominent landmarks include Ahghairons Tower (C79),

Blackstaff  Tower  (C6),  Castle  Waterdeep  (C76),  Piergeirons

Palace (C75), the Market, and Mirts Mansion (C52).

FETLOCK COURT

This  large  paved  courtyard  adjoining  the  Palace  paddocks

and stables is the staging area for any mounted contingent

of the guard before they head out of the city for outlying

patrols. It has also become an impromptu concert area for

practicing bards, who prefer it to their chilly quarters at New

Olamn (C72).

THE MARKET

The largest open space in the city is an open marketplace sur-

rounded by stone buildings (many moneylenders and pawnshops

among them) that enclose the maze of temporary stalls and carts

that appear here day and night. The Market is the best place to

haggle for the lowest prices on almost any trade good imaginable,

though theres no guarantee of  nding anything.

MOUNT WATERDEEP

The mountain on which the city is built is a bald, rough crag

with a peak some 1,500 feet above sea level. A lookout tower and

griffon-steed eyrie sit atop this mountain. On its seaward  anks

are emplaced eleven gigantic triple-catapults for hurling loads

of rock and burning material out to sea against attacking ships.

Several sea caves pierce the base of its western  ank, connect-

ing it to Undermountain and various points under the city by

tunnels of great antiquity (once used for smuggling). The City

Guard now watches these sea caves, allowing the Lords to use

them for secretive operations. The South Seacave is connected

by a set of hoists down into the mountain to the River Sargauth

and Skullport.

THE CYNOSURE (C7)

In the immediate aftermath of Myrkuls defeat and the ascen-

sion  of  Midnight  and  Cyric,  many  Waterdhavians  heard  the

voice of Ao over Mount Waterdeep. Within a month, a marble

temple known as the Temple of the Overgod was built upon

the ruins of Traders Way (the site of Myrkuls death) with the

enthusiastic  support  of  Waterdeeps  guilds  and  noble  houses.

Many worshipers  ocked to the temple, including many nobles

intent on following what seemed the latest fashion. Yet, after six

months, the temples  ock was reduced by both mortal and divine

disinterest. Soon, the temple was empty save for a few sporadic

services. In the Year of the Serpent (1359 DR), the Lords of

Waterdeep annexed the temple building and put it to use as a

public hall, available for rent by nobles and wealthy merchants

for parties, balls, weddings, and other events. Now carved into

the frieze is The Cynosure, a name both apt and ironic given

the existence of the plane of the same name and the purpose it

serves as the meeting place for the gods.

The ground on which the Cynosure was built falls within

Myrkuls  Ruins,  so  named  for  the  brown  murk  that  settled

on the area after Myrkuls disintegration during the Time of

Troubles. Although the Watchful Order of Magists & Protec-

tors cleaned up much of the fall-out of the destruction of the

Lord of Bones, Myrkuls Ruins remain the site of a seemingly

permanent planar breach, linking Faern to the Fugue Plane.

The minor planar breach has allowed the Fugue Planes impeded

magic trait (all spells are impeded; Spellcraft DC 20 + level

to cast) to leech into this area. As word of this phenomenon

has  spread,  many  powerful  spellcasters  have  chosen  to  hold

negotiations in the, as it is seen as relatively neutral ground

by those skilled in the Art.

NEW OLAMN (C72)

In just a few short years, New Olamn has become a prominent

center of education and bardcraft in Waterdeep and up and down

the Sword Coast. It can be reached by means of the Cliffride, a

steep, treacherous gravel track that runs along the western edge

of Mount Waterdeeps northern spur and is constantly exposed

to the sea winds and spray of the ocean below. A more pleasant

path passes through Mount Melody Walk, a continual  ame-lit

tunnel dug through Mount Waterdeeps northern spur and staffed

by a four-person contingent of the Guard at all times.

PIERGEIRONS PALACE (C75)

Built in the Year of the Smoky Moon (1287 DR), the white

marble  Palace  of  Waterdeep,  now  commonly  known  as  Pier-

geirons Palace, still stands as a shining symbol of the Lords Rule,

unblemished by corruption. The Palace is the main of ce location

for many city of cials, the majority of which are dedicated to

the administration of city services, such as the Watch, the Guard,

city clerks, and the Loyal Order of Street Laborers. The Lords

Court meets in a large chamber on the second  oor, just up the

grand staircase from the echoing, open entry hall.

There are also embassies here from many other countries and

cities, although such embassies need not be located in the Palace.

The most elaborate embassy in the Palace is the Silverymoon

Embassy, with a portal to Alustriels Court.

Piergeirons lodgings occupy the two northern towers of the

northern wing of the Palace. Also in the northern wing are

various guest quarters for visiting dignitaries without a separate

embassy in the city. Secret tunnels run from Piergeirons cham-

bers to all the private meeting places of the Lords, including

Blackstaff Tower (C6).

CASTLE WATERDEEP (C76)

Waterdeeps  great  fortress  is  a  thick-walled  stronghold  that

broods over Castle Ward from the  anks of Mount Waterdeep.

Pennants and banners are often hung and  own from its battle-

ments to signal the arrival of diplomats or the commencement

of ceremonies. The great height of the castle walls makes such

signs readily visible in the southern half of the city. The castles

walls average sixty feet thick, with rooms and passages tunneled

out of their great bulk.

The castle can house approximately three thousand Medium-

size creatures in comfort, and three times that number if every

corner  is  used  for  accommodation  and  storage.  The  normal

garrison is fourteen hundred city guards. Dungeon levels beneath

the city hold ninety cells in total, each capable of holding up

to six prisoners. By edict of the Lords, the castles larder must

contain an emergency food supply large enough to feed  fty

thousand people for a tenday. The castle courtyard is used for

training members of the Guard and the Watch. The main stables,

containing seventy or so fully trained and equipped warhorses, are

located in the ground-level interior of the castles south wall.

Signal beacons, horns, and mighty catapults capable of com-

manding the entire harbor of Waterdeep as far as Deepwater

Isle and the Torchtowers are kept ready on the battlements. A

garrison unit of at least thirty armed soldiers of the Guard always

stands watch. The castle gates and all stations of the walls are

always guarded, and just within the gates is a duty guardroom

where a strike squad of twenty crossbowmen and two wizards

can reinforce the guards at the gate in seconds, and anywhere

else in or under the castle in minutes.

Castle  Waterdeep  is  linked  to  extensive  dungeons  beneath

the castle and in the mountain to the west, used as armories,

food-stores, and to hold Waterdeeps secrets. Beneath the castles

dungeons lies the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see page 116),

now a dangerous, festering sore on the castles integrity.

Trades Ward

Trades Ward lies in the eastern half of Waterdeep, encircling

the western and southern walls of the City of the Dead. Given

over almost entirely to commerce, Trades Ward lacks the feeling

of community found in the more residential wards, but retains

the hustle and bustle of a marketplace throughout the day and

night. Notable landmarks of Trades Ward include the Court of

the White Bull, the Plinth (T38), and Virgins Square.

COURT OF THE WHITE BULL

This place is a packed-dirt plaza named for the birth of an albino

calf on this site when it lay outside the city walls. The calfs owner

eventually built the White Bull tavern, which thrived for years

until destroyed by Thongalar the Mighty and Shile Rauretilar in

a great spell battle that tore a rapidly widening planar breach to

the Astral Plane. Azuth, god of mages, repaired the breach, but

this area intermittently acquires the planar trait of wild magic.

As a result, no one has ever dared build on the location, making

it a natural meeting place and market for caravan owners to

peddle their wares from wagons.

THE PLINTH (T38)

Once  a  wizards  tower  and  the  center  of  Selnite  worship  in

Waterdeep, the Plinth is now a temple open to any faith and

employed by worshipers of gods who lack sizable congregations

in the City of Splendors. This mighty, needlelike tower resembles

a tall, thin, pyramid with the top cut off. Small balconies spiral

around the tower in slow descent. City laws forbid the sacri ce

of intelligent beings to any god, but a lot of folk leap (or are

helped  to  fall)  from  these  heights  each  year.  The   at  roof

is often used as a landing place for aerial steeds by the citys

wealthy and powerful.

VIRGINS SQUARE

This market and traditional hiring place for warriors is named

for  a  local  legend  that  virgins  were  sacri ced  to  dragons  on

this  spot,  long  before  the  founding  of  Waterdeep.  Whenever

Cult of the Dragon agents visit the city, this is their traditional

meeting place.

City of the Dead

This walled enclosure on the eastern edge of Trades Ward is the

general cemetery for the City of Splendors, and its size nearly

makes it a ward in and of itself. Many citizens visit the City of

the Deads parklike green lawns and white marble tombs during

the day, for it is one of the few places dominated by greenery

that the citizens of Waterdeep can share within the city walls.

A Watch contingent keeps the cemetery peaceful, and various

members  of  the  Guild  of  Chandlers  and  Lamplighters  keep

torches lit around and inside a number of the tombs. The grounds

are off-limits after dusk, and the gates are locked. Nevertheless,

many individuals still hold clandestine meetings at night in the

City of the Dead, despite the slight risk of undead escaping from

a warded tomb to prowl the sprawling cemetery.

Although it has only been in its current form since the Year

of the Riven Skull (1250 DR), the area has served as the city

burial ground for centuries. The cemetery ran out of room in

the  Year  of  the  Stranger  (1064  DR),  prompting  the  city  to

build  a  low  wall  around  it  and  replace  the  individual  graves

with magic tombs linked by portals (constructed primarily by

the mage Anacaster) to in nite demiplanes. Two years later, the

high number of undead prompted the Lords to erect higher,

defensible walls around the cemetery and to lock and ward the

magic tombs. There have been few incidents since.

ROADS END (CD1)

This small tomb is the  nal resting place for travelers who die

while in the city. Any unclaimed possessions are interred with

their remains (minus any outstanding debts, including their burial

costs). This tomb has always been a frequent target for thieves,

usually following rumors of rich adventurers being buried with

great magic and gold.

THE HOUSE OF THE HOMELESS (CD2)

This is a vast mausoleum with a row of low steps leading up to

its high metal gates. Anacasters portal (an opaque energy- lled

arch at the end of the echoing, empty entry hall) leads to an

apparently endless labyrinth of underground caverns. The city

pays  the  Guild  of  Chandlers  &  Lamplighters  to  light  these

caverns. Here lie all the dead of Waterdeep who do not merit,

or do not own, a place in any other tomb. If their names are

known, such are always cut into the rock above the hole where

their cremated ashes are interred.

AHGHAIRONS STATUE (CD3)

This  tall,  marble  sculpture  is  an  incredibly  lifelike  depiction

of the bearded, robed mage as he appeared at age seventy (his

prime). Ahghairon stands atop concentric steps, facing west with

his hands outstretched to indicate the City of Waterdeep around

him, with a smile on his face. The steps are lit by night with rows

of torches and are a favorite meeting spot by day.

MERCHANTS REST (CD4)

Also known as the Coinscof n, this resting place is reserved for

those who prepay for the honor of burial here. The tomb contains

one of Anacasters portals, which leads to a lightly wooded region

with inset plaques on the ground, marking burial plots.

WARRIORS MONUMENT (CD5)

This is a 60-foot-high impressive stone sculpture depicting a circle

of three men and two women striking down trolls, goblinoids,

orcs, and barbarians, all of whom are falling backwardout-

wardall around them. After the Time of Troubles, the statue

was renovated and magically altered to add a griffon-rider  ying

above the other warriors and spearing a minion of Myrkul.

LORDS RESPITE (CD6)

This small, black marble tomb is the  nal resting place of those

Lords who wish to be buried in state. It is fronted on three sides

by statues of the Open LordsAhghairon (north), Baeron (east),

and Lhestyn (south). There is no statue on the western face, but

there is a door apparently made of the same smoky material as

the Lords helms, which prevents any from seeing or entering

the inside of the tomb. Only one Lord has been buried here in

the past three decades, and the identities of all buried Lords

remain secret even in death, as bodies interned herein are buried

in full Lords regalia.

THE HALL OF THE SAGES (CD7)

This is a special tomb for sagesa small, dusty tomb with only

about  eighty  sages  interred  inside.  What  makes  it  interesting

to some illicit treasure hunters is the rumor that many of the

sages rarest tomes and books were interred with their cremated

remains (a false rumor maintained by Laeral and others to  ush

out dealers of forbidden lore).

THE HALL OF HEROES (CD8)

This is the of cial warriors tomb of Waterdeep, for  ghters and

all who fall in battle. Its blue marble walls enclose a trophy hall

with many remembrances of the fallen, including the sword hilt

of Raurlor (its blade long since turned to the skeleton of an asp).

At the far end of the hall is one of Anacasters portals, leading

to pleasant rolling  elds on an empty, grassy plane, where the

warriors are buried, row upon row.

DEEPWINTER VAULT (CD10)

Deepwinter  Vault  is  the  long-neglected  tomb  of  the  now-

vanished  Deepwinter  family.  It  also  contains  the  primary

entrance to the Dungeon of the Crypt (see page 118).

SULTLUE VAULT (CD14)

In the depths of this heavily warded tomb slumbers Sylsinssath

Sultlue (CE male yuan-ti pureblood sorcerer 9/ancient masterSK

3) of House Eselemas. Driven from Lushpool by his cousin and

greatest rival, he settled in Waterdeep over a century ago and

quickly rebuilt his fortunes. Members of House Sultlue make

regular visits to this tomb to attend to his needs, and a small

band of tainted onesSK actually dwell within the tomb.

Dock Ward

Waterdeeps most notorious and colorful ward is also the oldest.

Travelers tales portray it as a lawless, brawling place of drunks,

smugglers, roaming monsters, and fell magic, which is not all that

far from the truth. The bustling harbor scene and its attendant

activities dominate this ward.

THE WARRENS

Beneath the heart of Dock Ward lies one of Waterdeeps lesser-

known  neighborhoods.  Reachable  through  narrow  winding

tunnels leading off various dark alleys, the Warrens have been

centuries in the making, starting with ancient stone houses built

along hilly streets. From time to time a higher  oor has been

added to a building, or a walkway built to add living space or

to connect houses, even those across a street from each other.

Over time, parts of streets have been completely hidden from

the sun, and the lowest  oors of many buildings have become

cellars. Subsequent rebuildings have shored up the lowest inhabited

 oors and worked from there. The slow result of Waterdeeps

reach for the grander and larger and taller is the forgotten layer

known as the Warrens, home to many of Waterdeeps small folk.

Many gnomes, hal ings, and even the occasional dwarves have

found congenial and discreet housing amid the dark cellars and

narrow tunnels, for stout hal ing warriors guard most entrances,

keeping the Warrens free of humans and their ilk.

THE KEELHAULED DWARF

In the cavernous cellar beneath the warehouse known as the

House of Tarmagus (D30) lies The Keelhauled Dwarf, a subter-

ranean tavern favored by duergar and their ilk, as well as many

of the citys half-orcs, thugs, and ruf ans.

THE MONSTER PIT

Beneath the Fishscale Smithy (D60) building and the neighboring

Thirsty Sailor (D12) lies an abandoned gladiatorial arena once

owned (indirectly) by Elaith Craulnober. Various Dock Ward

gangs sometimes use the place for settling their differences.

THE OLD XOBLOB SHOP (D71)

This  curiosity  shop  is   lled  with  lots  of  battle  trophies  and

souvenirs from Undermountain. The shop is untidy and ill-or-

ganized but worth a look, if only to see the stuffed beholder for

which the shop is named (hanging by the main counter). The

proprietor, Dandalus Ruell, loves to tell the tale of his victory

over Old Xoblob.

South Ward

Once known as Temple Ward, Southern Ward lies in the southeast-

ern corner of Waterdeep, bounded by Trades Ward to the north

and Dock Ward to the west. Caravan City, as this oft-forgotten

ward is sometimes known, is a homely, friendly, busy, and largely

poor area of Waterdeep. Notable landmarks of Southern Ward

include Caravan Court and Waymoot.

106

CARAVAN COURT

This place is usually a dust-shrouded melee of cursing, whip-

wielding drovers, bawling beasts of burden, and creaking wagons

and  carts.  Most  caravans  entering  or  leaving  through  the

Southern Gate muster or disband in Caravan Court, making it

a scene of nonstop activity and chaos.

WAYMOOT

At the southern intersection of the High Road and the Way of

the Dragon, the Waymoot is a high signpost mounted in the

middle of the crossroads with hanging arrows pointing toward

the harbor and city gates. Created by the Watchful Order and

funded by local merchants, the signpost magically directs travel-

ers to locations spoken into a crystal on the post. Once a site is

spoken, the Waymoot writes the destination onto the relevant

arrow and indicates is distance from Waterdeep; therefore folk

are sent out the appropriate gate leading north, east, or south,

depending on their destinations.

Deepwater Harbor

The naturally sheltered, deepwater basin that gives Waterdeep

both its name and its wealth is a bustling place. Its chill waters

are kept fairly clean by the diligent work of the Guild of Water-

men and the merfolk of Tharqualnaar. The mariners of the

Guard control access to the harbor above the waves, using the

retractable chain-nets and walls of the defensible harbor to bar

entrance or exit by particular ships.

Deepwater Harbor is divided into two smaller harborsthe

Great  Harbor,  through  which  commerce  and  transportation

 ows, and the Naval Harbor, restricted for the use of the navy.

Two  major  islands,  Stormhaven  and  Deepwater,  enclose  the

harbor. Notable landmarks include Boatscrape Cove, where ships

are beached to be cleaned of barnacles and worse; Deepwater

Beach, where mermaids often come to sun and  irt with the

guards; the Sea Stacks, sharp rocks that deter the close approach

of sailing ships; and Umberlees Cache, the subsea depression that

leads to  ooded caverns in the depths. (See page 120 for more

information on Umberlees Cache.)

Waterdeeps sewers empty into the harbor at places covered

with extremely large and strong gratings, regularly patrolled

by bands of merfolk. The merfolk use catch-nets on poles to

scoop and gather the debris into large tow-globes for transport

far  out  to  sea.  The  harbors  rocky,  sloping  bottom  is  thinly

covered with mud, especially at the southern end of the harbor.

It is kept free of plants and litter by the merfolk. Due to the

cleanliness of the harbor and the undersea lighthouse known as

UNDERWATER RESIDENTS

The Great Harbor is home to two communitiesthe merfolk

village of Tharqualnaar and the sea elf hamlet of TQuession.

Both  communities  suffered  horribly  during  the  Deepwater

War, but their numbers have rebounded thanks to an in ux

of refugees from other communities devastated by the Army

of  Iakhovas.  Locathah  sometimes  come  to  the  harbor  to

trade,  as  do  other  merfolk,  but  lizardfolk  and  sahuagin  are

slain on sight.

DEEPWATER BEACON (H7)

This underwater lighthouse stands at the edge of Umberlees

Cache (see page 120), lit by a magical light which guides the

merfolk patrols and keeps the sea wraiths con ned within the

caverns below. The light is actually the terminus of a one-way

portal from a point high above the atmosphere through which

sunlight pours twenty-four hours a day. The lighthouse serves

the merfolk as a tethering spot for giant seahorse steeds, as an

armory, and as a storage facility. It also serves ships above by

acting as a subsurface beacon.

Communities Within

Although  Waterdeep  is  a  city  in  its  own  right,  it  contains

three settlements within its borders suf ciently distinct to be

considered communities of their own.

Skullport

Skullport is a subterranean community on the banks of the

River Sargauth in the depths of Undermountains third level.

Built  atop  the  ruins  of  the  Sargauth  Enclave,  the  Port  of

Shadow  has  long  been  the  dark  mirror  of  Waterdeeps  fair

face. The Lords of Waterdeep have long tolerated Skullports

existence, reasoning correctly that if they were to destroy the

Port  of  Shadow,  the  sinister  commerce  of  the  place  would

inevitably  migrate  upward  to  the  city  proper,  despoiling  the

City of Splendors. However, the Lords do keep a close eye on

activities within Skullport, predominantly through the efforts

of Laeral and Kitten (see page 54).

Skullport serves as a smuggling and trading base for stolen

and illegal cargo in the City of Splendors. Body parts, cadavers,

drugs, ask-no-questions mercenaries, slaves, evil and vile magic,

poisons, and almost anything else can be found for sale in its

dark ways. Aside from the communitys location and Skull Isle,

the most notable feature of the Port of Shadow are its inhabit-

antsbeholders,  gargoyles,  illithids,  drow,  vampires,  and  all

manner of terrible monsters.

Skullport has no government per se, although the various

competing power groups form a  uid oligarchy of sorts, with

disputes resolved outside the town through proxies. The Skulls

of  Skullport,  remnants  of  the  Netherese  wizards  who  once

ruled the Sargauth Enclave, keep what peace exists. Shradin

Mulophor is the nominal lord of Skullport, harkening back to

an ancient agreement with Halaster, but since his transforma-

tion  during  Halasters  Higharvestide,  he  has  exercised  little

actual  authority.  His  clone  has  largely  retreated  within  his

manse, ignoring all else.

Other  important  power  groups  in  Skullport  include  the

Agents  of  the  Eye,  the  Arcane  Brotherhood,  the  Chosen  of

Eilistraee (from the nearby Promenade of Eilistraee, UM L3),

the Dark Dagger, the drow of House TanorThal, duergar from

Gracklstugh,  the  Harpers,  the  illithids  of  ChChitl,  the  Iron

Ring, the Keepers, the Kraken Society, the Lords of Waterdeep,

various Skulker gangs, and the Unseen.

the proximity of Waterdeeps resources and riches.

THE SKULLS OF SKULLPORT

The  Skulls  for  which  the  Port  of  Shadow  is  named  are  the

sentinels of order in an otherwise dangerous community. The

true nature of the Skulls has been a mystery since the ports

founding, but their authority has never been successfully chal-

lenged since the arrival of Shradin Mulophor in the Year of the

Angry Sea (1148 DR). The Skulls are possessed of a strange,

alien intellect and are known to speak in cryptic phrases and

ancient  tongues  long  since  vanished  from  the  Realms.  The

Skulls often make bizarre demands of those who cross their

paths or otherwise attract their attention, and their reaction

to events is unpredictable.

The true history of the Skulls is known only to Halaster and

a few of his apprentices. At the exact moment that the Weave

faltered in the Year of Sundered Webs (339 DR), the Netherese

arcanists of the Sargauth Enclave were experimenting with the

109

great mythal that encompassed their subterranean city. As surges

of wild magic wracked the mythal, the arcanists were drawn into

the magical mantle that enveloped their city. The thirteen most

powerful arcanists were transformed into the Skulls of Skullport

and trapped within the ruined city, while their apprentices were

trapped within the twisted remnants of the mythal in the form

of spellshades (treat each as CN  ameskullLE sorcerer 9 with a

rainbow-hued, vaguely humanoid-shaped body).

In the centuries that followed, the thirteen Skulls lurked

within the ruins of their shattered enclave, unable to move more

than 300 feet beyond the cavern that now houses the Port of

Shadow. The mythal that held the Skulls in thrall allowed their

thoughts to mingle, and over time the thirteen Skulls lost their

individual identities and developed a collective consciousness that

retained only fragments of its constituent personalities. While

each Skull still exhibited odd habits, pet peeves, and even the

occasional  bit  of  skill  or  wisdom  reminiscent  of  its  original

personality, for all intents and purposes the Skulls became a

single  entity.  The  spellshades  found  themselves  incapable  of

manifesting at all except when summoned by the Skulls.

Shortly after his arrival in Undermountain in the Year of Scat-

tered Stars (168 DR), Halaster Blackcloak discovered the ruins of

the Sargauth Enclave, but he wisely retreated, correctly perceiving

the threat posed by the Skulls. Halaster has never set foot within

the ruined enclave, and he has always barred his apprentices from

doing  the  same.  Shradin  Mulophor  ignored  Halasters  vague

warnings and received the Mad Mages permission to claim the

ruins for his own. The Lord of Bones forged a pact with the Skulls

that enabled him to establish a small trading settlement in the

cavern. The Skulls agreed to Shradins request not out of boredom

or whimsy, as the necromancer suspected, but because his plans

dovetailed with their own plans to escape their ancient prison. As

Skullport grew, the Skulls learned to absorb and empower wizards

they  killed,  transforming  them  into   ameskullsLE.  Not  every

arcane spellcaster was susceptible to absorption into the mantle,

but enough were to create a great number of vassal skulls.

During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), Halasters control

of  Undermountains  wards  wavered  for  the   rst  time,  and

the Skulls were brie y able to tap into a portion of his power.

The unlucky victim of their newfound prowess was a visiting

drow archmage. The Rag Mage, as he came to be known, was

transformed  into  his  current  form  (insane  CN  male  drow

sorcerer 15/archmage 4 attended by a closet of common rag-

gamoffynsMM2), capable of feeding Skullports mantle by slowly

bleeding magical and life energies of victims of his servitor

raggamoffyns. The wards of Undermountain faltered again on

Halasters Higharvestide (1369 DR) when the Mad Mage was

abducted from his halls by the Twisted Rune. The Skulls struck

almost  immediately,  transforming  Shradin  into  his  current

form (NE nishruuMF [augmented male human] necromancer

22/archmage  5),  capable  of

feeding  Skullports  mantle

the magic he absorbs. In the wake of these two successes, any

two of the  fteen entities linked to the mythal (the thirteen

Skulls, the Rag Mage, and Shradin) were able to escape the Port

of Shadow. The Skulls became convinced that they only need

link eleven other powerful arcane spellcasters to the mythal

and they could escape once and for all.

Such  ambitions  were  shattered  just  a  few  years  later,  when

a  powerful  extraplanar  entity  named  Vhostym  tapped  into

Skullports mythal with an artifact known as a Weave Tap. The

ensuing destruction destroyed four of the Skulls, wreaked havoc

in the Port of Shadow, and transformed the remaining Skulls into

true undead. Once again the Skulls were trapped within the mythal,

unable to depart (as were the Rag Mage and the Lord of Bones),

but now they could send their spellshades and vassal  ameskulls

beyond the mythal into the halls of Undermountain. It is unclear

how, if at all, the damage to Skullports mythal has affected the

balance of power within the Port of Shadow and between the

Skulls and Halaster, but it is clear that the status quo on which

Skullport was built has come to a rapid and unclear end.

The Skulls themselves can now be considered CN advanced

8 HD  ameskulls. Collectively, they can tap into the spells of

a sorcerer 26/archmage 5/Netherese arcanistPG 5 (effectively a

shared spell pool). Individually, they can cause spellshades and

vassal  ameskulls to manifest for 1d4 rounds or 1d4 hours,

respectively. Skullports mythal, in addition to functioning as

a  prison,  acts  like  a  lichs  phylactery.  As  long  as  it  survives

unscathed, none of the Skulls can be truly destroyed.

TQuession

The hamlet of TQuession is less than a decade old, having been

formed by sea elf refugees from warmer southern waters in the

Year of the Shield (1367 DR). The Fair Folk were driven from

their homes by a huge horde of undersea predators, the vanguard

of the Army of Iakhovas. The survivors settled in Waterdeeps

harbor alongside the merfolk of Tharqualnaar and petitioned

Waterdeeps Lords to join the Guard. Like the merfolk, the sea

elves fought long and hard in defense of Waterdeep during the

Deepwater War and paid a high toll for their efforts. In the

years since that battle, many additional sea elves have migrated

to the relative safety of Waterdeeps harbor, and the community

is beginning to grow.

Like the merfolk of Tharqualnaar, sea elves who join the

Guard receive a healthy stipend from the Lords. However, most

of the Fair Folk seem to prefer the role of merchants, selling

the fruits of the seas to surface dwellers at the Sea Elf Trading

Outpost (H6), just outside Waterdeeps walls.

Tharqualnaar

The village of Tharqualnaar is a community of merfolk older

than Waterdeep itself, dating back to the Year of Sea Monsters

(458 DR). For centuries, detachments of male merfolk have

been sent north from warmer southern waters to the  ooded sea

caves beneath what is now known as Deepwater Isle. Members of

the merfolk garrison kept watch over the tithes to Umberlee that

littered the cavern  oor, hoping to keep thieves from provoking

the  Bitch  Queens  ire  and  the  inevitable  ensuing  destruction

above and below the surface all along the Sword Coast. Since the

Year of Three Seas Rage (334 DR), that duty has necessitated

keeping watch over Umberlees Cache (see page 120) and the

burgeoning number of sea wraiths and other monsters of the

depths that dwell within.

In the Year of the Harp (1355 DR), merfolk  eeing the de-

struction of Laakos Reef, a community in the Shining Sea forty

miles east of Calimport, arrived in Deepwater Harbor seeking

sanctuary from the looming threat of Iakhovas and offering

their tridents in service to the Lords of Waterdeep. As they were

accompanied by female and young merfolk, Tharqualnaar was

transformed almost overnight from a remote military garrison

into a thriving village. In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR),

the village was nearly destroyed by the Army of Iakhovas, and

the merfolk bore the brunt of the Deepwater Wars undersea

casualties. However, in the wars aftermath, refugees from up

and down the Sword Coast migrated to Tharqualnaar and made

it their home. Coupled with a generous donation of material

and magic support from the Lords of Waterdeep, the merfolk

village of Tharqualnaar has once again begun to thrive. The

merfolk have even cultivated an undersea garden in a hot rift

on the harbor  oor near the eastern tip of Deepwater Isle.

All adult merfolk of Tharqualnaar are considered members

of the City Guard if they contribute to the defense of Water-

deep, though their weaponry and equipment is their own. The

Lords pay a stipend of food, medical supplies, and trade-bars

(the equivalent of 25 gp per head per month) to all who loyally

patrol the harbor depths against invaders, predators, and ship-

ping hazards. The merfolk are expected to aid in the recovery

of corpses, spilled cargo, sunken vessels, and the like. They are

free to travel outside the harbor, but rarely patrol more than

a quarter-mile from the western shore of Deepwater Isle or a

half-mile north of Stormhaven Island.

Although Waterdeep makes a convenient sanc-

tuary  where  player  characters  can  lick  their

wounds, count their coins, and out t themselves

anew, it offers much more to those willing to seek adventure.

Waterdeep can even be the basis of an entire campaign, span-

ning the entire range of adventuring possibilities and taking

PCs from their  rst adventure to their last.

Waterdeep works well as a home base for a dungeon-delving

campaign  that  ranges  up  and  down  the  Sword  Coast.  Many

neophyte adventurers make their way to the City of Splendors

in search of companions of similar ilk. Almost anything can be

bought or sold in Waterdeep or Skullport, making it easy to keep

player characters comfortably equipped as they rise in power.

In fact, it is not uncommon for characters based elsewhere in

Faern to teleport into Waterdeep for supplies before returning

to their home regions.

Waterdeep also works well as a dungeon in its own right.

The City of Splendors sits atop the greatest dungeon of Faern

(Undermountain), as well as hosting lesser sites such as the Cita-

del of the Bloody Hand and the Dungeon of the Crypt. Many

monsters live in and among the people of Waterdeepaboleth

and skum lurk in the sewers, illithids and vampires prey on

the populace, and beholders with legions of charmed servitors,

shape-shifting dragons, and all manner of undead each pursue

their own schemes. Player characters can  nd more than enough

monsters  to  battle  simply  by  exploring  Waterdeeps  seamy

underside.

Finally, Waterdeep is the perfect setting for a campaign based

on political intrigue. Strife between guilds, nobles, politicians,

religious  gures, rogues, and outside power groups can provide

an endless font of roleplaying possibilities for players who prefer

to focus on character interaction over dungeon exploration.

Urban Dangers

Although  Waterdeep  is  largely  civilized  and  its  population

comprised  primarily  of  allied  humanoids  (humans,  dwarves,

elves, hal ings, gnomes, and others), its dangers are not con ned

to the dungeons and sewers beneath the streets. Many sentient

monstrous races uniquely adapted for urban hunting dwell in

and among the citizenry of Waterdeep, including doppelgangers,

ghaunadansMF, greater doppelgangersMF, malaugrymsMF, wererats,

and vampires. Lesser predators and pests such as dweomervores*,

changesteed leucrottas*,  hyrsMM2, splinterwaifsMM3, and even

wiloras* are sometimes found in the city as well. (Dweomervores

and wiloras are described in Chapter 6.)

Other urban dangers are more localized, dealt with by the

locals through avoidance rather than confrontation. Of course, if

foolhardy PCs blunder into such a place and manage to dispatch

the persistent threat, everyone bene ts. If not, the attitude of

the local citizenry and Watch contingent is usually well at least

it wasnt a neighbor who vanished.

Black Wagon Alley (EL 3)

Running east of Book Street to the north of Candle Lane, this

narrow way leads to a warren of houses inhabited by the poor

(including  some  thieves).  City  Watch  patrols  are  often  busy

cutting away trip-wires and strangle-wires from its more easterly

stretches. It is named for the ghostly apparition of a black plague-

wagon, which sometimes meanders through the alley, slowly and

silently, without horses or a driver. Anyone who encounters this

haunting must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or catch cackle

fever (see page 292 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Black Well Court (EL 7)

Opening west off Book Street, across from the end of Drakiir

Street, this cramped courtyard is known for its long-polluted well

of black water. It serves as the meeting place for many gangs of

street ruf ans, thugs, and cultists. As such, it is regularly patrolled

by  the  Guard  and  the  Watch,  who  often   nd  thugs,  Dragon

Death Attack (Ex): If

Qikna  studies  a  victim  for

3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack

with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak

attack  has  the  additional  effect  of  possibly  either  paralyzing

or killing the target (Qiknas choice). If the victim of such an

attack fails a DC 12 Fortitude save, he is paralyzed for 1d6+2

rounds or killed, as appropriate.

Disease (Su): Claw attack, Fort DC 13, incubation time 1d6

days, damage 1d2 Dex and 1d2 Con per day. Any victim that

takes ability damage must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save

or take 1 point of Dexterity drain and 1 point of Constitution

drain instead of the normal damage for the disease.

Evasion (Ex): If Qikna is exposed to any effect that normally

allows him to attempt a Re ex saving throw for half damage,

he takes no damage with a successful saving throw.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Qikna does 5d6 extra points of damage

on any successful attack against  at-footed or  anked targets,

or against a target that has been denied its Dexterity bonus for

any reason. This damage also applies to ranged attacks against

targets up to 30 feet away. Creatures with concealment, creatures

without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra

damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks.

Trap nding (Ex): Qikna can  nd, disarm, or bypass traps

with a DC of 20 or higher. He can use the Search skill to  nd,

113

and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the

level of the spell used to create it). If his Disable Device result

exceeds the traps DC by 10 or more, he discovers how to bypass

the trap without triggering or disarming it.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Qikna retains his Dexterity bonus to

AC even when  at-footed or targeted by an unseen foe. He still

loses his Dexterity bonus if paralyzed or otherwise immobile.

Possessions: +1 studded leather armor, +1 short sword, light

crossbow, 20 bolts, greenblood oil (3 doses).

Brindul Alley (EL 6)

This crescent-shaped alley lies

between  Sorn  Street  and

River Street. It is a frequent

haunt  of  a  dangerous

apparition,  known  as

The  Hand  That  Sings,

which  was  seen  more

often near the docks in

older days but has been

in this new location for

nearly two decades. The

Hand  appears  to  be

an  animated,  severed

human  hand  with  a

mouth  in  its  palma

strange  apparition  all

too similar to the sign

of cursed Moander, the

ancient and evil god who

never  sleeps  quite  soundly

enough.  The  Hand  is  said

to  snatch  valuables  it  fancieses-

pecially magicwhen it encounters them, and to occasionally

attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them

into fatal falls. Most often, though, it seems to take no notice

of those who do not bother or follow it, merely drifting along,

eerily singing old and fragmentary Sword Coast ballads and love

songs as it wanders through the night.

Unbeknownst to all, the Hand is actually a living combination

of two spells: handfangRac and magic mouth. Fashioned by one of

Halasters apprentices long ago, it now wanders about Waterdeep,

following the barely remembered dictates of its mad creator.

merely has to move over the opponents, affecting as many as it

can cover. Opponents can make attacks of opportunity against

the Hand that Sings, but if they do so they are not entitled to a

saving throw. Those who do not attempt attacks of opportunity

must succeed on a DC 15 Re ex save or be engulfed; on a success,

they are pushed back or aside (opponents choice) as the spell

moves forward. Engulfed creatures are subject to the full normal

effect of the spell(s) each round on the living spells turn, and

are considered to be grappled.

Spell Effect (Su): A creature hit by the slam attack of the

Hand that Sings is subjected to the normal effect of the spell

or spells making up the creature, as if it were within the area

or effect of the spell itself. Saves apply as normal for the spell

(DC 15). The fanged, biting mouth deals 1d6 points of damage.

With a successful DC 15 Re ex save, the victim takes only half

damage, but if the target fails the Re ex save, the Hand that

Sings automatically establishes a hold. Its teeth sink into the

targets  esh and continue to bite for an extra 1d6 points of

damage each round until the hold is broken or the spell ends. In

addition, the fanged mouth delivers venom to a held foe, dealing

1d6 points of Constitution damage (initial and secondary) unless

the target makes a successful DC 15 Fortitude save.

Deloun Alley

Reached from Chelors Alley, this back-of-the-shops delivery route

is always crowded with crates, barrels, and the like. By night, rats

of both the human and rodent sort lurk herewhere crates can

easily be thrown or used to block the escape of surprised victims.

This alley serves as the informal headquarters of the Plague Rats

(see page 57) in the City of Splendors.

Lhestyns Court (EL 13)

Lhestyns Court lies on the interior of the block of taverns and

businesses bound on the south by Chassos Trot and the High

Road  on  the  east.  The  main  entrance  to  the  Jhansczil  Villa

($14) faces the northern side of the barely visible entrance to

the dark court. Many wrongly assume this was the spot upon

which  the  Masked  Lady  (Lhestyn  Silmaeril)  died,  but  those

aware of their city history know this is the area where one of

the  battles  against  the  Shadow  Thieves  occurred  in  the  Year

of the Pointed Bone (1298 DR). Lhestyn led more than four

dozen Shadow Thieves into ambushes within this court and she

and her hidden allies killed all of them over seven encounters

spread across a tenday. While the Shadow Thieves were physically

removed from the city after that tenday, the spirits of the slain

remained here. They did not manifest fully for more than two

decades, but they have been infrequently active since that time

as greater shadows. The spirits never manifest within 2 hours

of highsun or if a light source is present. The touch of these

greater shadows leaves slash marks on a victims body, the  rst

of which always occurs on the right ankle. If a victim is slain

by one of these shadows, the right foot falls off as if severed, a

well-known calling card of the Shadow Thieves.

This  is  a  quiet  place  in  which  ruthless  nobles  dispose  of

problems, and the PCs might just earn themselves an escort

here if they displease the more amoral nobles in their activi-

ties, whatever they might be. Over the decades, many political

enemies of the local noble clansespecially the Jhansczils and

Rosznarshave found themselves trapped in Lhestyns Court

after a disarming party at the nearby villa; such victims are

often hemmed in the haunted locale until dead.

Greater Shadows (5): hp 58 each; Monster Manual page 221.

Pharras Alley (EL 10)

This alleyway is named for the  rst magistress of The House of

Wonder ($21), who died more than one hundred twenty years ago.

It is a busy shortcut route used by merchants and their delivery

carts, and is often crowded with would-be wizards coming to

The House of Wonder hoping to hire on as an apprentice to a

wizard. Some are anxious to impress everyone with their magic,

or are just very, very nervousand they have been known to

let  y wildly with magic, endangering passersby.

They vanish hurriedly, though, when the Circle of Skulls

appears. This spellhaunt (as wizards call it) is all that is left

of some early priests of Mystra who tried to devise their own

means of immortality and achieved only a lichlike state. These

eerie skulls are always seen  oating in a circle, arguing among

themselves  in  hollow,  echoing  voices.  They  spit  spells  from

their empty mouths or hurl beams of  re from their empty

eye sockets when angered by those they encounter, but they are

unpredictable and might help someone with information instead

of attacking. They seem tied to Pharras Alley, and they never

appear anywhere else in the city (though the information they

pass on indicates that they must be able to see and hear things

in other parts of Waterdeep).

Flameskulls (9): hp 26 each; Lost Empires of Faern page 171.

The Prowl (EL 4)

This short alley loops eastward off Alnethar Street, and through a

side-spur, links up with Cymbrils Walk to the south. It provides rear

access to a row of shops and a row of apartments in the center of

the block. Named for the acts of an eccentric nobleman who used to

loose his pet panthers to stalk the alley, terrorizing the neighborhood

(until one of the cats grew exasperatedor just hungryone day

and ate him), this otherwise unimportant alleyway is the favorite

hunting-ground of a pair of skeletal hands that strangle folk from

behind, leaving wither-scars where each  nger presses deep into

victims throats. Some folk who have glanced into the alley at

night but not entered have reported seeing two points of light, close

together in the air, that resemble  oating, glowing eyes.

This  frightening  killer  doesnt  strike  oftenfour  times  a

year, at mostand seems adept at evading detection whenever

powerful wizards and priests come looking for it. No one is yet

sure what it islet alone how to destroy it. It seems to be active

only in the hours of darkness, striking only in the alleyway, never

at folk in buildings.

In  truth,  the  killer  is  a  dread,  left  behind  with  carefully

crafted instructions by a long-departed evil wizard to torment

his hated ex-neighbors.

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

Dungeons of Waterdeep

Although many young Waterdhavians believe one must brave the

wilds of the Savage Frontier or the depths of Undermountain

when seeking monster-infested ruins, in truth plenty of dangerous

locales can be found much closer to home. The City of Splendors

contains quite a few dungeons, including the Citadel of the Bloody

Hand, the Dungeon of the Crypt, the sewers that run beneath

the entire city, the aquatic chasm known as Umberlees Cache,

and the granddaddy of them all, the playground of the Mad

Mage Halaster, the vast Undermountain. In addition, a wide

variety of smaller sites might challenge the intrepid explorer,

including dark, haunted alleys, various crypts in the City of the

Dead, the treasure vaults of Waterdeeps merchant elite, and the

towers of city-dwelling wizards.

Ahghairons Tower

Born  in  the  Year  of  Great  Riches  (920  DR),  Ahghairon  of

Waterdeep arrived in Silverymoon in the Year of the Red Rain

(927 DR), yearning to learn magic. He was taken in and taught

by numerous tutors. In the Year of Sudden Sorrows (941 DR),

Ahghairon  single-handedly  destroyed  a  pair  of  young  green

dragons  intent  on  attacking  Silverymoon.  Soon  thereafter,

Ahghairon left the city to learn more about Toril, but little is

known of his travels. He had returned to Waterdeep and built

his tower by the Year of the Blazing Call (947 DR), for that

is where Magister Taline Telgara, The Flame of the North,

found him after receiving visions from Mystra. By the Year of

the Rings Royal (952 DR), Ahghairon was the of cial advisor

to the War Lords of Waterdeep, and his history is thereafter

wholly intertwined with that of the City of Splendors.

Ahghairons Tower (C79) rises as a slim stone pinnacle with

few windows and a conical roof four stories above the street. It

is always quiet, never visibly changed by the passage of years nor

disturbed by passersby. No one is thought to have entered it since

Ahghairons death, thanks to a series of wards erected through the

cooperative effort of Ahghairons apprentices (a mythal created

with epic spellcasting), although in truth Lhoril Delhiirnyn stole

the dragonstaff of Ahghairon before the wards were laid.

The tower is enclosed in a permanent forcecage (caster level

23),  with  a  gap  of  10  feet  between  the  cage  and  the  tower

proper. If successfully disintegrated or otherwise destroyed, the

forcecage reforms 10 minutes later. Within the forcecage, the

tower  is  enclosed  in  an  invisible  prismatic sphere,  within  the

prismatic sphere is a time stop  eld, within the time stop  eld is a

spell turning  eld, and within that ward is variant of the alarm

spell that sounds a loud, audible alarm in Piergeirons Palace

(C75), Blackstaff Tower (C6), and Heralds Holdfast (far to the

north; see Silver Marches). If the alarm is triggered, a walking

statue (see page 139) is teleported from Mount Waterdeep to

the tower and set to attack the intruder. Some have speculated

that it might be possible to bypass the wards with secret tokens

of recognition or pass-phrases, but if such things exist, no one

has admitted knowledge of them.

The  contents  of  Ahghairons  Tower  are  largely  unknown,

although certain legendary items, such as Ahghairons great cloak,

are said to lie within. Iron and stone golems, as well as lurking

spell traps, are also said to guard the wizards treasures.

Blue Alley

In  the  Year  of  the  Blue  Flame  (1327  DR),  a  mad,  reclusive

mage named Keilier Twistbeard (CE male Chondathan wizard

20/planeshifterMP 4) constructed the Blue Alley as a way to afford

himself endless amusement. Although Keilier now wanders other

planes, he still returns periodically to watch visitors encounter

the alleys perils, making bets with old friends like Maaril on

the victims probability of success. The Blue Alley is a deathtrap,

 lled with cruel traps and illusions, and its only real treasure is

the sword Magebane (see page 148).

Whenever PCs boast of their adventures in Waterdeeps shops

and taverns, invariably the proprietor or one of the regulars will

inquire, Ah, have ye tried the Blue Alley yet, then? Nearly all

Waterdhavians have heard of the Blue Alley and know that it

lies in Sea Ward. Residents of that ward usually know that its

entrance opens on Ivory Street. Anyone who goes looking on

Ivory Street can  nd the Blue Alley with a DC 10 Search check.

The alleys blue paving stones glow faintly underfoot, leading to

a T-shaped intersection adorned with a carved stone image of a

mans face twisted in fear.

Catacombs of Yintros

The Tower of Yintros was once one of Waterdeeps preeminent

schools of wizardry, standing beyond the walls at the northern

end of the plateau where the Heroes Garden ($70) stands today.

Built by the archmage Yintros in the Year of Spreading Spring

(1038 DR), it passed to his apprentice, Ulthorn, in the Year of

the Lords Dilemma (1066 DR). Ulthorn dwelt in the Tower

of Yintros for over two centuries, educating generation after

generation of Waterdhavian wizards.

In the Year of Thunder (1306 DR), Ulthorn died in a sorcerous

duel with a vastly more powerful foe, the Archmage Ahrabose. In

defeat, he slew his enemy by bringing the Tower of Yintros down

upon them both with a great shout. Many of Ulthorns young

apprentices and prestidigitators of Waterdeep searched the wreck-

age of the tower that night, seeking items of power and written

spells. The blasted corpse of Ulthorn was found with his shattered

staff and emerald sigil ring, but many other treasures, including

the Spellbook of Daimos, were never found. In the wake of the

towers destruction, the Lords of Waterdeep purchased the land

on which it stood from Ulthorns apprentice and heir, the wizard

Rendergallis. The ruins of the tower were cleared and the land was

transformed into a public park, known today as Heroes Garden.

Unknown to all but a few, part of the Tower of Yintros still

exists. The catacombs beneath the tower, used for spell research

and magical experimentation, still exist, sealed from prying eyes

by wards set in place by the Watchful Order. One entrance to

the catacombs lies beneath the statue of Lhestyn, which can be

pushed aside with a DC 24 Strength check if one  rst speaks

the password, Ulthorn. The other entrance lies in the sewers,

through a secret door halfway down passage SF5. This secret

door  requires  the  same  passphrase  to  bypass  its  wards.  The

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

existence of the catacombs and the passphrase needed to bypass

the wards are recorded in the Diaries of Rendergallis, of which

several copies exist in various libraries around the city. A hand-

ful of adventurers have explored the Catacombs of Yintros over

the years, but reports as to what they have found vary widely.

From these contradictory accounts, sage Ilighast Chamnabbar

(see page 72) has deduced that a powerful summoning oozeMM3

must lie within, but that is just a guess.

Citadel of the Bloody Hand

The  shield  dwarves  of  Clan  Melairkyn  built  the  subterranean

citadel  of  Melairgate  in  the  early  days  of  their  settlement  in

the eastern spur of Mount Waterdeep. The citadel served as the

primary entrance into Melairbode and as a trading station for the

Stout Folk to meet with the Fair Folk of Aelinthaldaar. After the

elves abandoned their capital, the shield dwarves buried the doors to

the citadel and turned it into a warren thick with traps, guardians,

secret passages, and peepholes reachable only from below.

During the reign of Ulbaerag, the inhabitants of Bloodhand

Hold  rediscovered  the  dwarf  citadel  and  claimed  it  for  their

own.  They  sealed  the  passage  leading  down  to  the  depths  of

Undermountain, and transformed the subterranean fortress into

a defensive redoubt to which they could withdraw if necessary.

The citadel saw infrequent use over the years when the settle-

ment was threatened, but it was otherwise ignored. Knowledge

of its existence was lost in the Year of the Splendid Stag (734

DR) when Raulbaera Bloodhand led her followers inland and

the village of Bloodhand Hold all but died.

In the Year of the Black Wind (1262 DR), a contingent of

Waterdeeps  small  Thieves  Guild  (now  the  Shadow  Thieves)

found the citadel while exploring a stairway leading up from

the  rst level of Undermountain (now known as the Falling

Stair because of the spectacular collapse it undergoes whenever

anyone approaches before it reverts to its unblocked state). Word

of  this  discovery  was  passed  back  to  the  guildmaster,  known

professionally as the Bloody Hand, who cheekily decided to make

the citadel his stronghold, despite the fact that it lay directly

under Castle Waterdeep.

After securing the citadel from the roving monsters set loose

by Halaster, the guild renamed it the Citadel of the Bloody Hand,

and constructed two links to the city sewers, a secret passage into

the castle above (through which they could send spies to observe

goings-on), and an escape route exiting on the western face of

Mount  Waterdeep,  just  above  the  ocean.  The  Shadow  Thieves

operated from this forti ed base for over three decades before being

driven from the citadel in the Year of the Pointed Bone (1298

DR) after Lhestyn Silmaeril in ltrated the guild and revealed the

existence of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand to the Watch.

After the Shadow Thieves were driven from the city, the

Lords of Waterdeep garrisoned the citadel and sealed the pas-

sage leading down the Falling Stair. The two passages to the

sewers were left intact, garrisoned by the Guard and employed by

high-ranking occupants of Castle Waterdeep when they needed a

discreet exit. The seaward section of the Citadel was given over

to  the  Harpers,  who  transformed  it  into  the  forti ed  refuge

known as Harpers Hold, and knowledge of its existence is now

the exclusive province of Those Who Harp and a handful of

the Lords of Waterdeep.

In the Year of the Gauntlet (1369 DR), during Halasters

Higharvestide, a horde of goblins, orcs, and ogres rushed up the

Falling Stair and broke into the citadel. Although the Guard

contingent prevailed, what seemed at  rst to be an easy victory

has proven anything but such. In the wake of the goblinoid horde

came a  ood of living spellsMM3. These lingering remnants of

Halasters spells have somehow taken on sentience and refused

to  dissipate.  As  their  numbers  have  continued  to  grow,  the

Guard has been forced to abandon the Citadel, sealing off the

passage into Castle Waterdeep. Harpers Hold is still accessible

to Those Who Harp, but many leading Harpers are growing

concerned that this refuge might soon have to be abandoned as

well. Although the Guard refuses to allow adventurers into the

Citadel of the Bloody Hand to investigate, several groups have

done so by making the perilous trek through Undermountain

and then up the Falling Stair. Those explorers who have returned

and spoken of their experience have vanished soon thereafter,

possibly abducted by agents of the Shadow Thieves seeking word

of their lost redoubt.

Cliffwatch Ruins

The Cliffwatch Inn was once a rambling old inn, recognizable

for  its  exterior  galleries.  Although  the  place  was  shabby  and

well worn, its cheerful proprietor Felstan Spindriver (CG male

Illuskan human commoner 4) more than made up for its  aws.

Felstan was well known for helping folks in need of a place to

hide, for directing adventurers or visitors to odd sites, and for

chatting about rumors, treasure tales, and events around the

city. The inns cellars were rumored to contain secret passages

down to smugglers storage cellars, and from thence to the city

sewers and Undermountain.

In the Year of the Shield (1367 DR), the inn was engulfed

in multiple magical explosions that sent gouts of  ame far into

the air overhead. Since that night, the area has been surrounded

by a high wooden fence and kept under constant observation by

Guard and Watch patrols. The owner has not been seen since

the destruction of his property, and he is believed dead. Offers

to purchase the land have been repeatedly denied by the Lords,

leading  most  to  suspect  that  something  dangerous  still  lurks

within the ruins.

Crypt of Chauntea

Long before the spires of the Open Lords Palace graced the

skies of Waterdeep, the site was home to an abbey of monks and

clerics of Chauntea. The Abbey of Chauntea was one of the citys

oldest buildings, built in the Year of Waving Wheat (554 DR)

during the era of Bloodhand Hold. The abbey fell in  re and

ruin during the Second Troll War and was never rebuilt.

Piergeirons  Palace  (C75)  is  still  haunted  by  the  spirits  of

Chauntean monks who died in the con agration, and no less

than seven such hauntings have been observed. The most famous

haunting is known as the Monks of the Three Candles, a ghostly

procession that approaches the guardpost of the South Tower 2

hours before every dawn and marches up a long-vanished stair

toward their old  elds on the mountains slopes.

Less well known is the Ghost of the Bathing Monk. He appears

on the slopes above the palace on nights after a strong rain that

 lls a small hollow with a natural bathing pool. The spirit appears

to notice some far-off danger and rushes down the mountain,

dripping water as he goes, before vanishing into the ground just

outside the palace walls. No one has ever dug into the ground

where the spirit vanishes, but if someone did (and managed to

avoid the notice of the Palace guards), she would discover a small

stone staircase leading into the

mountain and the long-forgot-

ten  undercroft  of  the  abbey.

From the undercroft, one can

then reach the cellars used for

storing  seeds  and  the  abbeys

hidden treasury.

All knowledge of the catacombs

was  lost  in  the  abbeys  destruc-

tion,  and  the  construction  of

Piergeirons  Palace  atop  the

ruins  obscured  any  chance

that they would be discovered.

The undercroft is haunted by a

dozen or more huecuvasFF, once

monks of Chauntea who hid

in the abbeys crypts rather

than  battle  the  trolls.  The

wrath of the Earthmother

has  also  transformed  the

vast  store  of  seeds  within

into a wide variety of undead

plant monsters.

Dungeon of

the Crypt

Located beneath the northern

end of the City of the Dead

and  the  southern  end  of

North Ward, the Dungeon of

the  Crypt  was  constructed  at

the behest of Artor Morlin (see page 59), a powerful and cunning

vampire, during the Second Troll War. Legendary in the South

as an enemy of all things Calishite, the mercenary lord moved

north to Waterdeep after the construction of Castle Daggerford

over the ruins of his old castle in the Year of the Advancing

Wind (947 DR) and found the burgeoning city to his liking.

The Dungeon of the Crypt can be reached from the city most

easily by means of the Deepwinter Vault (CD10). As more than a

few neer-do-wells have discovered, the wards on the crypt lapsed

long ago, as the last of the Deepwinters died during the reign

of the Guildmasters. In the center of the crypt, a huge cof n

containing the crumbling corpse of some forgotten Deepwinter

patriarch can be rotated sideways to reveal a steeply descending

stair. After several landings (each furnished with a guardroom

with  ring-ports), this broad, steep staircase descends well over

a hundred feet into a complex of rooms that looks like a de-

fensible warehouse. A long tunnel leads off from this network

of rooms to connect (by means of a secret door) with the  rst

level of Undermountain. Privy-chutes and a partially collapsed

descending tunnel also connect with caverns near Skullport. A

narrow passage to a secret door connects with a secondary sewer

passage (SF71). Tunnels that once ascended to some cellars in

North Ward were  lled in long ago, but they could be opened

once again with some work.

At the northern end of the

Dungeon  of  the  Crypt,  far

from the areas reached by the

Deepwinter Vault, is a chain

of  quite  palatial  rooms,  the

last  of  which  is  an  ornate

bedchamber  connected  to  a

large hall with a  replace. This

area  was  once  the  lair  of

Artor Morlin, before he was

driven from his home by the

Company of Crazed Ventur-

ers. Artors escape route led

up the chimney through the

thick common wall of some

North Ward businesses and

exited among the chimney-

tops there. In the years since

he  was  forced  to  abandon

this lair, Artor has installed

a succession of servitor vam-

pires herein (never letting any

him)  to  decoy  any  would-be

vampire  slayers  from  his

own  trail.  The  current  oc-

cupant  is  Fhang  (CE  male

doppelganger vampire rogue

9), a member of the Unseen

who  secretly  serves  Artor,

unknown  even  to  Hlaavin.

Fhang  is  under  instruction

from  Hlaavin  to  maintain  a  safe  house  for  members  of  the

Unseen, and under instruction from the vampire lord to keep up

Artors guise while in the Dungeon, on the off chance a member

of the Company of Crazed Venturers might come seeking the

long-vanished vampire of the Dungeon of the Crypt.

The Fireplace Level

The  Fireplace  Level,  so  dubbed  by  the  Company  of  Crazed

Venturers, lies beneath the southern end of North Ward, just

north of the City of the Dead. Built by an early member of the

Gost family, the Fireplace Level once served as the source of

that familys fortunes and a place to stash their ill-gotten gains.

Although the complex is mentioned in private diaries still held

by the Gost family, the current members of the clan have yet

to discover how to reach the complex, and they arent even sure

if it ever existed. (In his current guise as the aging seneschal of

the Gost familys private militia, Artor Morlin keeps watch to

ensure that the Gosts never  nd their old stronghold.)

Although the Company of Crazed Venturers  rst entered

from the rear of the complex through the  replace they found

in  the  Dungeon  of  the  Crypt,  the  primary  entrance  to  the

Fireplace Level is through a secret staircase in the basement

of the Gost Villa (N57) unknown to anyone other than Artor

Morlin. The dungeon-side face of the door is warded with the

gigantic, obviously spell-shaped  oating face of Khelben, who

bellows: Turn back, whoever you are! Trespass in this area is

prohibited! (Khelben had nothing to do with this spell. It is

simply a ruse left by a long-dead member of the Gost clan to deter

interlopers from below from entering the family villa.) Other

spell-wards also guard the place, some of them quite deadly to

those who do not possess the Gost family crest.

A railless stone staircase leads down from the Gost villa base-

ment to a room  lled with inky, opaque water; additional steps

lead down to its unseen depths. At the time the Company of

Crazed Venturers explored this place, a trio of banelar inhabited

the  waters,  but  Artor  has  since  replaced  them  with  vampiric

spawn created from merfolk he kidnapped from the harbor. The

Company never discovered that the stairs leading down into the

pool connected with the vampires reserve crypt, or that Artor

Morlin has continued to lair therein. Artor, of course, has another

escape routea portal connecting his lair with the dungeons of

old Morlin Castle (which now lie beneath Castle Daggerford).

The Fireplace Level continues through a pair of rusting, iron

double doors to a subterranean complex comprising a dozen or

more storage chambers and beast cages. The Gosts were early

backers of the Shadow Thieves, and over the years they accumu-

lated a warehouse full of treasures plundered from Waterdhavian

tombs and guilds. Many of those treasures were stashed in the

Fireplace Level, and the Gosts left many traps and guardians to

secure their ill-gotten gains. Long-dead ghosts of the Gundwynd

family, who were imprisoned in the dungeon over a century ago,

also haunt the Fireplace Level. A member of the Gost clan left

the Gundwynds to starve in one of the beast cages so he could

seize their possessions. Although a distant member of the Gundw-

ynd clan eventually restored the family fortunes, the Gundwynds

harbor lingering suspicion to this day that the Gosts had a hand

in nearly destroying the Gundwynd family and fortunes.

A portal once led from the Fireplace Level to the Worm-

writhings,  a  warren  of  twisting  tunnels  north  and  west  of

ruined Blingdenstone beneath the Lurkwood, and from there

to  a  series  of  dangerous  destinations  across  Faern,  allowing

the Gost clan to import all manner of beasts from the Savage

Frontier directly into Waterdeep. The Gost family was forced to

abandon the complex in the Year of the Catacombs (1308 DR)

when a purple worm came through the portal and triggered a

temporal stasis trap. Years later, after the Company of Crazed

Venturers discovered the place and turned the purple worm into

solid silver, Laeral disposed of the worms corpse, investigated

the portal network, and then sealed the portal for the safety

of the city. Of course, enterprising adventurers could always

attempt to unseal the portal.

The Fireplace Level has two other known exits. A staircase

still leads up from the Fireplace Level to connect with the

midden of the Grinning Lion (N56). Only its proprietor, Unger

Farshal knows of the passage, and he has installed a secret door

20 feet down the stair that leads into sewer passage SF31. The

other exit is a small  ssure that opened up when the purple

worm arrived and now connects with the sooty shaft leading out

of Artor Morlins old  replace. Artor discovered the Fireplace

Level after the  ssure opened up and subsequently used his

charms to ensure that the Gosts were fearful enough of the

Gundwynd ghosts and the magically frozen purple worm to

abandon the place and the treasures within. Unger uses both

back  exits  during  his  regular  runs  to  and  from  Skullport,

passing down the stair, through part of the Fireplace Level,

down into the Dungeon of the Crypt, and from there down

to Skullport. To date, Unger has yet to explore much of the

Fireplace Level, for the ghosts haunting the place have scared

him off. Artor is aware of Ungers movements, but for now

allows him to proceed unmolested.

Maldiglass Refuge

Maldiglas  Turntower  the  Magni cent  reigned  as  Mystras

Magister from 1318 to 1322 DR. During his reign, Maldiglas

created a number of magical refuges for arcane spellcasters to use

in times of injury or sickness. One such refuge lies in a cavern

deep inside Mount Waterdeep. The cave is approximately 40 feet

in diameter and accessible only through two-way portals (two of

which are located in each ward). From inside the cavern, one

can see out the mouths of the fourteen portals that open into

its walls and leave simply by stepping through those archways.

An observer from the other sides of the portals cannot see in,

and one can enter only by whispering the name of Maldiglas

while stepping on the correct stone.

The existence of Maldiglass Refuge is kept as secret as pos-

sible by the Watchful Order of Magists & Protectors, concealed

beneath a cloak of wild, exaggerated tavern tales told only when

someone asks about the cave or claims to know something of it.

Apprentices using scrying globes in Blackstaff Tower monitor

use of the Waterdeep refuge. Khelben and Laeral have prom-

ised the Watchful Order and the Lords of the city that they

will only intervene in visits to the refuge if one being attacks

another within. They have made no promises, however, about

not magically tracing or spying on users of the refuges, after

such beings depart. The Watchful Order has secretly decided

that anyone using the refuge more than twice in any month

will be interviewed by senior mages of the Order as to their

doings, aims, and current foes to uncover any possible perils

to the Order, the city, or the prosperity of ongoing trade in

the North. The order is not above temporarily substituting

false stones for the real ones to prevent speci c portals from

operatingparticularly when Waterdeep is at war or there is

suspicion of immediate covert magecraft hostile to the city.

The known, automatic powers of the refuge (really a mythal

created with epic spellcasting) include the following spells cast

upon  anyone  entering  the  refuge:  break  enchantment,  endure

elements, and heal. A single individual can receive the spells no

times per day. The portals leading to the refuge are as follows:

Castle  Ward:  1stSmall,  permanently  chained-off  (with

chains  anyone  can  step  over  or  roll  or  crawl  under)  mud

sinkholes between the Watching Tower (C68) and the Palace

Stables (C17). 2ndAt the southwestern end of Fetlock Court

(past the horse-trough).

City of the Dead: 1stThe stone that begins under the

right heel of Ahghairons Statue. 2ndThe waterdrip wash

stones  set  under  a  downspout  on  the  western  side  of  the

Mariners Rest.

Dock Ward: 1stThe  sh-shaped stone halfway down Odd

Street, near its northern edge. 2ndThe moon-shaped stone

set into the mouth of Alines Way, were it meets Keel Alley.

North Ward: 1stOn the west side of the rain barrel that

stands  against  the  north  wall  of  the  Grinning  Lion  tavern

(N56), just off Golden Serpent street. 2ndInside a cubicle

behind an open doorway in the southeastern wall of Farwatch

Tower. The cubicle is a tiny, tall bare room whose walls are

several feet thick, and it is regularly checked by the Watch,

beggars seeking shelter, conspirators, and lovers. The Watch has

spread a story about the door being always open because they

cannot keep it locked no matter how hard they try. Truthfully,

the cubicle is a haunted sentry post.

Sea Ward: 1stA footstone marking the burial site of a

long-dead  Open  Lords  faithful  guard  dog,  Rivuryn,  which

is set into the turf just south of a small stand of trees that

lies inside the city wall immediately south of Seaseyes Tower

($71). Sometimes a portable wooden bench hides the footstone.

2ndA stone half-hidden under a downspout, on the seaward

side of the Fanebar, at the southernmost corner where a narrow

passage leads through Kulzars Alley.

Southern Ward: 1stThe stones just outside the back (south)

door of the Midnight Sun tavern (S9), where garbage is usually

piled. 2ndThe round stone set into the street between Athals

Stables (S27) and the city wall guard tower that faces it.

Trades Ward: 1stThe huge, cracked, paving stone set into

the eastern end of Ironpost Street, on its southern edge (right

against the wall of the corner building). 2ndOn the rooftop

Umberlees Cache

Since the  rst trade-meets occurred on the shores of

Waterdeep Harbor in 1088 DR, mariners have paid

homage to Umberlee, the Bitch

Queen, by dropping coins into

the deepest reaches of the har-

bor in thanks for safe ports and

safe passage in the coming year.

Over time, this tithing attracted

the attention of a small religious community of

merfolk dedicated to appeasing Umberlees wrath

and safeguarding her offerings.

In the Year of Three Seas Rage (334 DR),

merfolk clerics of Umberlee from Tharqualnaar

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

used magic to open the  oor at the harbors deepest point in

the lee of Deepwater Isle, revealing deeper caverns beneath.

Almost immediately,  erce currents pulled down all of the

tithed  coins  that  littered  the  harbor   oor  into  the  great,

unplumbed depths below.

In the years that followed, those who used the harbor continued

to make tithes to the Bitch Queen, although the exact ceremony

varied slowly over time. The modern form of this ceremony is

known as the Fair Seas Festival, which comes at the end of Fleets-

wake (see page 15). Of course, the vast wealth known to lie in the

depths of Waterdeep Harbor has proven to be an irresistible lure

for treasure hunters. Merfolk wardens turn back most would-be

explorers of Umberlees Cache, but every once in a while a band

of foolhardy adventurers makes it into the lightless depths.

All  the  caverns  of  Umberlees  Cache  are  considered  to  be

under the effects of a permanent unhallow spell placed here by

the Bitch Queen herself. The upper caverns of Umberlees Cache

are haunted by sea wraiths, a self-propagating form of aquatic

undead that continue to add to their number by transforming

most interlopers into undead of a similar nature. Luckily, the

light of the Deepwater Beacon (H7) keeps the sea wraiths from

escaping  into  the  harbor.  The  middle  caverns  of  Umberlees

cache are guarded by a wide variety of  endish aquatic monsters,

including dire sharks, reekmurksFF, squids, and giant octopi. In

the lightless depths swim  endish titans of the deep (krakens,

leviathansMM2, legendary sharksMM2) and various aquatic demons

(myrmyxicusesFF, skulyvnsFF, and wastrilithsFF).

Violent, sudden currents that appear without warning and last

for varying durations plague the lightless waters of Umberlees

Cache. All such currents tug at least slightly downward, inexora-

bly drawing the treasures dropped into Umberlees Cache toward

a cavern called the Bitch Queens Maw. For 24 hours each year,

on the last day of Ches, a complete planar breach leading to

Umberlees domain in the Blood Sea of Furys Heart opens in

the center of the Maw, giving the cavern the planar traits of

alterable morphic, strongly evil-aligned, and mild faith (as de ned

in the Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Guide to Faern). A

dozen or more tribute gatherers (advanced 24 HD half- endish

giant octopi) emerge through the breach to gather up all the

treasures that have reached the Maw and bring them into the

Blood Sea. Although legends speak of a merfolk shaman who

witnessed this event in centuries past, most sages believe such

knowledge comes from dream visions sent by the Bitch Queen

to her most faithful adherents.

Vault of Stars

Waterdeeps  rst major temple to Selne was located on the site

that is today Moonstar Alley, which curls around the walled villa

of the noble family for which it is named. Originally known as the

High House of Stars, popular wisdom holds that it was burned

to the ground in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR) by raiding

worshipers of Bane who crept up from below and breached the

temples cellars. The interlopers slaughtered most of the residents

before the alarm was raised, and by the time the Watch arrived,

the temple was a towering inferno of  ames that seemed impervi-

ous to magic. Selunes faithful are believed to have never set foot

on the desecrated ground again, building their present temple a

block to the west. Local rumor suggests that the cellars of the

burnt temple still hold magic and wealth, buried under burned

rubble, and that they can be reached by stairs and shafts now

hidden under the paving stones of this alleyway.

In truth, Lord Vanrak Moonstar (see page 62) and his fellow

Shaaran worshipers destroyed the High House of Stars before

retreating into the Underdark. However, the undercroft of the

High House of Stars, the building now known as the Vault of

Stars, survived the con agration and is still in the hands of the

Moonmaidens  followers.  Lady  Alathene  Moonstar  (see  page

62),  now  an  archlich,  has  continued  her  unending  war  with

Vanrak and his followers and uses the undercroft only to pursue

her research and investigations. Adventurers who learn of the

Vault of Stars might be tempted to explore it, at least until they

determine theyve walked uninvited into the lair of a lich with

a fantastic memory, a sharp wit, and a hunger for new stories

of Waterdeep. If they cause any damage before realizing theyve

invaded the workplace of one of the good people, they might

 nd themselves paying their debts not in coin but in service to

the Moonmaidens cause.

Wonderstar Garrison

Irritym Wonderstar was a powerful Waterdhavian wizard with

close ties to the church of Gond and the Watchful Order of

Magists & Protectors. One of his many accomplishments was

to graft the still-moving arm of a metal construct to the arm

of Baelam the Bold, an infamous thief of the Sword Coast

who lost his left hand in a trap. In gratitude and admiration,

Baelam gave up his thieving ways and explored his newfound

interest in the Art.

In the Year of the Behir (1342 DR), Irritym was slain by

thieves seeking to plunder his house of magic. Enraged, Baelam

hunted down and slew his tutors murderers and then spent the

next several months learning what he could of his masters Art,

trading lesser items and tomes to those who would teach him in

exchange for training. The more powerful items and tomes he

hid away somewhere beneath the citys streets.

In  the  decade  that  followed,  Baelam  roamed  the  cities  of

the Sword Coast, slaying thieves and taking their stolen wealth

to further  nance his training. In the process, he made many

enemies, including the sorcerer Garthagul of Calimport and the

infamous thief Ssilban The Silent of Theymarsh. During this

period,  Baelam  returned  frequently  to  the  City  of  Splendors,

claiming Irrityms house as his own.

In the Year of the Crown (1351 DR), a group of thieves

gathered secretly in Waterdeep to attack and slay Baelam and

seize  Irrityms  remaining  treasure.  Baelam  slew  them  all  for

their troubles and then quit Waterdeep to roam Faern, after

giving the last of his masters magic to Khelben Arunsun.

Little more was heard of the late Irritym or Baelam in the

years that followed until the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR). Be-

ginning around Greengrass of that year, rumors spread through

the  City  of  Splendors  that  Garthagul  of  Calimport,  while

excavating the earthen  oor of a Dock Ward warehouse, had

discovered a heretofore unknown cache of Irritym Wonderstars

constructsa veritable army of steel warriors standing row

upon row and bearing Irrityms distinctive exploding star-shaped

sigil. On the heels of such rumors came whispers that there

was no such cache, and that Garthagul himself had started

such tales in a bid to draw Baelam back to Waterdeep. Within

days of the rumors widespread dissemination, Garthagul had

vanished and sightings of Baelam were reported in nearly every

tavern in the city.

Nothing more might have come of the incident if not for

the discovery of a unique form of golem hidden in the cargo

of a Calishite trading vessel bound for Garthaguls hometown

shortly  thereafter.  The  Lords  quickly  con scated  the  golem,

hiding it away in the depths of Castle Waterdeep for further

study, but the story spread quickly and served to validate the

existence of the Wonderstar Garrison in the popular imagina-

tion. Whether or not such the Wonderstar Garrison exists still

remains a mystery, but many continue to look for Wonderstars

army of constructs.

Sewers of Waterdeep

Waterdeeps sewers run beneath the entire city, with the notable

exceptions of the harbor islands and the heart of Mount Wa-

terdeep, forming a subterranean dungeon between the surface

and the depths of Undermountain. The uppermost portions of

the sewers are in present use and fairly good repair, thanks to

the efforts of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild. Many older,

smaller tunnels are walled up and not in useat least, not to

carry sewage.

The map shows only the largest passageways of the sewers.

These are of two sortsprimary and secondary, according to

size. Primary passages are 20 feet across and contain 3-foot-

wide railless walkway ledges on both sides. Sewer workers cross

passages by means of their 16-foot catch-poles to vault across

or by the use of boards, which they lay down as temporary

bridges. The catch-poles are also used for reaching below water

level to clear debris from sewer gratings. Secondary passages

are 12 feet across with a single 3-foot-wide ledge on one side

(usually the more southerly or easterly). The countless feeder

pipes (any sewer pipe less than 1 foot in diameter) and tertiary

tubes (which can be crawled through by a Medium or smaller

creature) are not shown.

Junction rooms are usually 30-foot-by-30-foot stone cubicles,

20 feet high with a sitting ledge near the ceiling, above the muck.

Surface shafts are 6 feet in diameter with iron rungs set in the

walls to use as ladders to and from the sewers. The entrance to

a surface shaft is a 3-foot-wide hole capped by a removable metal

(or metal-banded wood) cover.

The accompanying map is accurate, but some of its features

(such as the junction rooms and surface-shafts) are distorted in size

for clarity. The sewers themselves are unnamed, so those giving

directions usually give them in relation to the point of entry.

Sewer Properties

Waterdeeps sewers have masonry ceilings, walls, and  oors. The

 oors are considered to be light rubble, thanks to all the debris

that has been deposited over the years, adding 2 to the DC of

Balance and Tumble checks.

Air:  The  air  supply  is  reasonably  good  (from  a  survival

standpoint) in the sewers, as the numerous small feeder pipes

bring stench-ridden air down from the surface in addition to

refuse.

Ambient Noise: The echoing water  ow produces lots of noise,

providing a 4 circumstance penalty on all Listen checks in the

network.

Disease: The sewers are  lled with tainted water. Any activity

that results in a characters nostrils, mouth, eyes, or ears get-

ting wet requires a DC 16 Fortitude save to avoid contracting

blinding sickness. Anyone injured by a slashing or piercing attack

(including natural bite, claw, gore, and sting attacks) must make

a DC 12 Fortitude save or contract  lth fever. (Both diseases are

described on page 292 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.) Creatures

who have survived in the sewers for an extended length of time

are assumed to be immune to both af ictions.

Gratings: Sewer gratings are stout, but many are often old

and rusty. They could be permanently set into stone walls or set

to swing open on pivots when unlocked.

Iron Gratings: 2 in. thick; hardness 10 (8 if rusty); hp 60 (30

if rusty); break DC 25 (23 if rusty).

Illumination: Generally, there is no light in the sewers except

beneath a sewer grate, where the  ltered sunlight is equivalent

to an immovable torch.

Scent: A terrible stench pervades the entire network, providing

a 4 circumstance penalty on Survival checks for tracking when

relying on scent.

Tracking: Walkway ledges are generally coated in a thin sheen

of slime, making them  rm ground for purposes of tracking.

in the westernmost end of a dead-end alley opening south off

Simples Street.

SF57: Surface Shaftentrance located at the intersection of

Tsarnen Alley and Burdag Lane.

SF58: Surface Shaftentrance located in the mouth of a

dead end alley, where it joins Quill Alley between the Wide Way

and Nethpranters Street.

SF59: Surface Shaftentrance located in the western end of

a dead-end forked alley that opens east off Rivon Street, north

of Spendthrift Alley.

SF60: Surface Shaftentrance located in a cul-de-sac opening

east off the north end of Drovers Street.

SF61: Surface Shaftentrance located halfway down Beacon

Street.

SF62:  Junction  Room  (no  surface  connection)under

Grocers Lane where it meets Snake Alley.

SF63: Surface Shaftentrance located in Rednose Alley, just

east of Saddlers & Harness-Makers Hall (S6)

SF64: Surface Shaftentrance located in a cul-de-sac opening

off the Rising Ride between Juth Alley and Caravan Court.

SF65: Surface Shaftentrance located in the wide part of

the alley that opens south off Olaims Cut.

SF66: Surface Shaftentrance located in the wide alley north

of Coach Street, just west of the High Road.

SF67: Surface Shaftentrance located in the alley just east

of the former Prestars Furniture (S54), east of Carters Way

and immediately south of Coachlamp Lane.

SF68: Surface Shaftentrance located in the cellar of the

Spouting Fish (S18).

SF69: Surface Shaftentrance located in the wide area of

the second alleyway north of Bellisters House (S25).

SF70:  Surface  Shaftlocked  entrance  located  under  Pier-

geirons Palace (C75). This shaft opens into a cellar guarded at

all times by  ve guard members and one armar (see City Watch,

page 35); an alarm on the wall near them is sounded whenever

they see or hear anything suspicious from the sewers below.

SF71: Secret Doorconnects the secondary passage leading

south from SF32 to the Dungeon of the Crypt.

SF72: Lair of the Xanatharlocated directly beneath the

Philosophers Court, just east of the Snail Street and north of

the Street of Curtains. It can be reached by way of two differ-

ent secret doors into the sewersone leading north from the

secondary  passage  leading  southeast  from  SF49,  one  leading

west from the primary passage running roughly north-south

between SF55 and SF56. It can also be reached by way of three

different passages leading up into basements of the buildings

above and a pair of tunnels that lead down into the Cavern of

Eyes (UM L1). None of these connections is direct; each leads

through a warren of trapped and warded passages just large

enough for a beholder to make its way.

SF73: North Entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (see

page 116)connects the secondary passage west of SF53 with

the once-secret northern entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody

Hand. There is now a guard station here, once used to defend Castle

Waterdeep from attack from below and now used to keep the living

spell legacies of Halasters Higharvestide trapped within.

SF74: South Entrance to the Citadel of the Bloody Hand

(see page 116)connects the secondary passages running north

and west of SF48 with the once-secret southern entrance to the

Citadel of the Bloody Hand. Otherwise identical to SF73.

SF75: Drain of Madnessa collapsed section of the sewer

 oor in the dark,  ooded depths of SF21 leads down to a set of

now- ooded chambers built long ago as a storage vault by some

forgotten merchant. These chambers are now the home of the

Savants of the Dark Tide.

Sewer Encounters

The  sewers  of  Waterdeep  are  home  to  all  manner  of  creepy

crawlers, as well as bats, rats, and other various small animals.

Many varieties of slimes, molds, and fungi are also found in the

sewers, including brown mold, green slime, and yellow mold.

A wide variety of monsters are commonly encountered in the

sewers as well. Many of these make their way through connections

between the citys dungeons and the citys sewers. Many inhabit-

ants of the city above also frequent the sewers, including members

of the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild, merfolk from the harbor,

solitary rogues, and various Agents of the Eye (see page 64). Several

unique creatures known to roam the sewers include the following:

a deathshriekerMM3 created in the aftermath of Myrkuls destruc-

tion; the Eye itself (see page 65), accompanied by a contingent of

eyeball beholderkinMF and lurking stranglersMM3; Xliilqil (LE doom-

sphereMF), who seeks revenge on the Company of Crazed Venturers

for its destruction decades before; a long-missing contingent of the

Cellarers and Plumbers Guild who vanished during the Time of

Troubles (CN male curstsMF [augmented humans] commoner 1);

and the Savants of the Dark Tide (see page 57).

ENCOUNTER CHANCE

As a party travels through Waterdeeps sewers, every 30 minutes it

has a chance for a sewer encounter, as set out in Table 51: Sewer

Encounter Chance. Groups moving at half their best possible speed

or slower are treated as using cautious travel. Parties cloaking both

sound and light use the hiding column. Passageways are considered

to be primary, secondary, or tertiary, as noted above.

On the table, Sewer Feature refers to junction rooms, the

immediate vicinity of sewer shafts, or other secret chambers (not

shown) off a sewer passage. In addition, every time a party moves

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

through a sewer feature, there is a chance of an encounter. If the

party remains in a sewer feature for 30 minutes or more, there

is a chance of an encounter coming to them every 30 minutes

per passage connecting to the sewer feature. For example, if a

junction room connects to a primary passage and two secondary

passages, roll three times per half hour the party remains in the

vicinity of the sewer feature.

ENCOUNTER TABLES

Each encounter table includes the following information:

d%: The result on percentile dice that will generate this en-

counter. Use the Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, or Sewer Feature

column, as appropriate.

Encounter: The type of creature encountered. Some of these

might be groups, such as a merfolk patrol or contingent of the

Cellarers  and  Plumbers  Guild.  If  the  indicated  creature  is  a

template, use the sample creature whose statistics appear in the

template entry.

Number Encountered: The number of creatures encountered. If

the term See text appears here, refer to the Encounter Descrip-

tions section below for the exact composition of the encounter.

ENCOUNTER DESCRIPTIONS

Encounters needing further explanation are described here. Where

appropriate, determine class, race, and alignment of each character

by using the NPC generation tables in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Dungeon Masters Screen or in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Aboleth:  This  encounter  is  with  NexilVendyliq  (30%),

AvidnaDelinskyun (34%), InkylDeskiloop (34%), or all three

(2%)  and  1d6+6  skum  per  aboleth.  If  all  three  aboleths  are

slain, they do not reappear, and no encounter occurs. All three

aboleths are described on page 57.

Beholder: There is a 20% chance this encounter is with the

Eye (see page 65), accompanied by a contingent of 4d4 eyeball

beholderkinMF and 4d4 lurking stranglersMM3. Otherwise, it is

an itinerant beholder.

Cellarer: The PCs encounter 1d6+6 human warriors (level 1d3)

and 1 leader (warrior level 1d4+4). All cellarers are members of

the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild and wear deep orange caps and

cloaks, with a red border around all hems and cuffs. They wear

leather armor and carry short swords and light crossbows.

Curst: During the Time of Troubles, a contingent of  ve

Cellarers never returned from the sewers. Believed to be lost,

they actually were transformed into cursts and continue to patrol

the sewers. If the Eye is destroyed, this group does not reappear

and no encounter occurs.

Deathshrieker: In the wake of Myrkuls destruction during

the Time of Troubles, a deathshrieker was created in the sewers

beneath what is now the Cynosure (C7). This undead horror

Doomsphere: There is a 95% chance that this encounter

is with the doomsphere Xliilqil (unless he has been previously

destroyed,  at  which  time,  the  encounter  is  with  a  normal

doomsphere). Before they disbanded, the Company of Crazed

Venturers destroyed a beholder in Fell Pass at great personal

cost. Now, decades later, the slayer of Savengriff (since resur-

rected) and Tzarrakyn the Elder has abruptly returned, stalking

the sewers of Waterdeep as it tries to learn what happened to

its killers.

Hand of the Eye: The PCs encounter Avaereene (see page 65)

and 3d6  ghters of level 1d3+1 on a snatch-and-grab kidnapping

run. There is a 50% chance they will have 1d6 commoners of

levels 1d3 in tow, destined for the slave markets of Skullport.

Merfolk: The PCs encounter 1d4+2 merfolk warriors of level

1d2 and 1 merfolk leader of level 1d4+1. If this encounter is

indicated for any other ward than Dock Ward or South Ward,

the players must reroll on Table 52.

Undermountain

The great dungeon of Undermountain, also known as the Halls

of the Mad Mage, is a vast subterranean complex carved into the

roots of Mount Waterdeep and the great plateau on which the City

of Splendors sits. Although Undermountain extends underneath

the entire city and even beneath the sea  oor to the west, the bulk

of the dungeon lies beneath Mount Waterdeep (hence the name),

as well as the western reaches of Castle Ward and Dock Ward.

126

Undermountain  is  said  to  include  nine  major  levels  and

fourteen sublevels. Obviously no product of this scope could detail

both the City of Splendors and Undermountain in the fashion

they deserve, so this account is restricted to a brief description

of the twenty-three dungeon levels and a catalog of some of

the ways in and out. Dungeon Masters who lack access to the

original  Ruins  of  Undermountain,  Ruins  of  Undermountain

2, Skullport, The Lost Level, Maddgoths Castle, and Stardock

boxed  sets  and  sourcebooks  are  encouraged  to  make  up  their

own dungeon, throwing everything they can possibly think of

and more against the PCs. For centuries, Halaster stocked his

dungeon with monsters and traps of all description, so nothing

should be considered out of bounds.

The abbreviation for each level or sublevel is simply UM (for

Undermountain), L or SL (for level or sublevel), and a number

or letter (levels are given numbers, sublevels are given letters).

For example, UM SLB means Undermountain sublevel B.

Ways In and Out

The halls of Undermountain are linked to the surface world

in countless ways, both physical and magical. Halaster uses his

network of portals to bring in monsters from all across Faern

to restock his dungeon. He also uses portals to draw adventurers

into the deeper regions, rarely explored, and to give the occasional

lucky  adventurer  an  unexpected  escape.  Some  of  the  notable

physical links are described below.

Blue Mermaid Passage: This connects a dry well in the cellar

of the Blue Mermaid tavern (D27) to the Port of Shadow.

Castle Corkscrew: This passage corkscrews down from the cellars

of Castle Waterdeep to Skullport, bypassing the  rst two levels.

Falling Stair: This connects the dungeons of Castle Waterdeep

(C76) and the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (UM SLA) with

Undermountains  rst level (UM L1).

Long Dark Stair: This links the oubliette of the Blush-

ing Nymph festhall (C81) with Undermountains first level

(UM L1)

South Seacaves: This links the Sea of Swords on the western

 ank of Mount Waterdeep with the River Sargauth by means

of a set of hoists.

Yawning  Portal:  Built  atop  the  ruins  of  Halasters  Hold,

the Yawning Portal inn (C48) contains the primary entrance

into  Undermountain,  a  large  well  that  drops  down  into

Undermountains   rst  dungeon  level  (UM  L1).  Secondary

entrances are found in the inn as well, including a link to the

inns less well known wet well and a passage leading out of

the Yawning Portals cellar.

The Upper Levels

The Upper Levels of Undermountain show the in uence of a

variety of builders over the centuries. The dwarves of Melair-

bode constructed the Citadel of the Bloody Hand (UM SLA)

and the series of stairs, shafts, and passages that connected it

through what is now the Upper and Deep Levels to the Lower

Levels. The Stout Folk also began mining operations on this

level  before  being  driven  out.  Halaster  and  his  apprentices

excavated what the dwarves had begun with their spells and

enslaved  beasts.  Netherese  wizards  constructed  the  southern

half of the Sargauth Level from a series of rough caverns and

waterlogged tunnels.

UM SLA:

THE CITADEL OF THE BLOODY HAND

Dug into the heart of Mount Waterdeep, the Citadel of the

Bloody Hand has until recently been occupied by the Guard.

Since Halasters Higharvestide, the Citadel of the Bloody

Hand has become the preserve for the living spellsMM3

that escaped the Mad Mage.

UM L1: THE DUNGEON LEVEL

The Dungeon Level has long been used by the Lords of

Waterdeep as a dumping ground for undesirables, hence

its most common name. It is also known as the Temple

Level, for the many temples of dark gods that have been

constructed here over the years, and the Tomb Level, for

the many lords and kings that have been interred herein as

well. As explorers of Undermountain often visit this level,

its features are common tavern-talk of Waterdeep. Notable

features of the Dungeon Level include the Bone Throne,

the  Cavern  of  Eyes,  the  Falling  Stair,  the  Grim  Statue,

the  Hall  of  Sleeping  Kings,  the  Hall  of  Three  Lords,

the House of Pain, the Lanceboard Room, the Sundered

Throne, the Temple of Gulkulath, and the Temple of the

All-Seeing One.

UM L2: THE STOREROOM LEVEL

On  this  level,  Halaster  and

his apprentices excavated the

rough  stone  caverns  and

mining  tunnels  left  by

the dwarves to house their

acquisitions  and  magical

experiments.  Notable  fea-

tures of the Storeroom Level

include  the  Doomgate,  the

Helmwatch, and Lord Hund

Hillgauntlets Tomb.

UM L3: THE

SARGAUTH LEVEL

Known for the River Sarg-

auth,  which  winds  through

this  massive  level,  Under-

mountains third level consists

of  two  major  sections.  The

southern third of the level con-

sists of the remnants of the

Sargauth Enclave, now split

by a massive cave-in leading

to the Port of Shadow and the

Promenade of the Dark Maiden.

The northern two-thirds of this

level was constructed by Halaster and his apprentices, and served

much the same role as Undermountains second level. The most

notable features of this level are the Lair of the Eye and the

rubble- lled Pit of Ghaunadaur, a mile-deep shaft that leads from

the Prime Material Plane into the Cauldron of

Slime through an intermittently existent

planar breach.

The Deep Levels

Halasters  ex-apprentices  have  his-

torically dominated (but in no sense

controlled) Undermountains

middle  levels.  Halasters

Higharvestide prompted at

least three of these appren-

tices to quit this region, and

the  ensuing  power  struggle

has devolved into nigh-constant

strife among the many inhabit-

ants of the oft-called Apprentice

Levels.

UM L4:

THE FARMS LEVEL

The fourth level of Undermountain

contains farms no surface dweller

would recognize. Halasters mighti-

est  magic  brought  the  River  of

the Depths, also known as the

River  Sargauth,  to  this  level,

where  it  links  huge  caverns

in  broad,  sweeping  curves,

and is navigable by barges.

In  these  caverns,  slaves

and servants of the drow,

aboleth, and other races of

the  Realms  Below  produce

slimes  and  algae  for  food.

Halaster  controls  his  own

farms  here,  too,  and  their

produce is teleported to feed-bin

rooms  throughout  the  dungeon

(rooms  known  to  resident  monsters  as

watering-holes).

Undermountains privies are also rinsed

by magically pumped or redirected

water  into  miniature  portals

that bring their contents to the

farms.  The  dung-heaps

produced by this process

are inhabited by advanced

otyughs  and  gulguthydrasMF,

among other foul scavengers.

All of these farms are quite valu-

able, as there are few large sources of good

food underground; thus, all are heavily guarded. The drow and

Halaster have both used fearsome monsters as guardians, including

death tyrants, advanced nagas with many sorcerer levels, dragon

turtle sorcerers, and even wilder creatures.

A large, eerily dark lake at one end of the level supports a

kuo-toa  sh factory of the blind white  sh of the depths, an

important industry, heavily guarded to prevent food-raids from

other creatures of the Underdark with the aid of an advanced 30

HD kuo-toa leviathanUnd. An island in the middle of the lake is

home to an advanced 18 HD otyugh, piled deep in dung, offal,

carrion, and other refuse that  nds its way down long, twisting

garbage-shafts from Skullport.

UM SLB: THE SHAFT

The 37,000-foot-long Shaft, also known as Belkrams Fall for the

unfortunate dwarf who discovered it, was originally a lava tube,

but it became a rough, empty cavity long ago. Clan Melairkyn

smoothed the shafts sides, reinforced the stone in certain areas

with mithral bracing, and installed winches and pulleys at vari-

ous points up and down the shaft, all to move mithral from

the lower mines to areas closer to the surface. Unfortunately,

the Shaft also proved their undoing. Drow invaders levitated up

the shaft from the depths to attack the heart of Melairbode,

precipitating the gradual fall of the dwarf hold.

Hundreds  of  side  tunnels  lead  out  from  the  Shaft,  most

connecting with chambers and tunnels that were once either

living chambers or mines. Considered a vertical sublevel, the

Shaft connects all the major levels between the Farms Level

(UM L4) and the Terminus Level (UM L8), as well as many

sublevels in between.

UM L5: THE MAZE LEVEL

This level contains  ve major features of notethe drow outpost

of Kyorlamshin, the Lair of the Umber Hulks, the Maze of Mad-

ness, an old dwarf hold built by Clan Melairkyn and expanded by

the duergar, and the winding channels of the River Graymurk.

Kyorlamshin is linked by a series of portals to the city of Karso-

luthiyl, which lies deep beneath the ocean  oor west of Baldurs

Gate. The drow of House TanorThal continues to dominate both

settlements and the slave trade that links them. The Maze of Mad-

ness is the creation of Halaster, stocked with ravenous minotaurs

and magic traps to confuse and trip up the unwary.

UM L6: THE SEADEEPS

This level once housed two major mining operations of Clan

Melairkyn. Nigh-endless mining tunnels stretch westward, follow-

ing two now-vanished veins of mithral beneath the ocean  oor.

Only numerous dwarf-built locks and pumps prevent the ocean

waters from seeping down and wholly  ooding this level.

The Seadeeps have numerous connections to the Swordsea

Depths, as the Underdark beneath the Sea of Swords is known. At

the present time, the Swordsea Depths are host to a long-running

three-sided battle between an alliance of svirfneblin and tomb

tappersMF, drow troops from Karsoluthiyl, and certain aboleth

and their evil servant creatures. The Savants of the Dark Tide

(see page 57) are refugees from this con ict.

The Dark Levels

The Dark Levels are a confused area of sublevels that lie between

levels 4 and 6 of the main dungeon. Many are accessible only

through portals and are otherwise dif cult to reach.

UM SLC: THE WYLLOWWOOD

An  apprentice  of  Halaster  created  the  Wyllowwood  over  a

century ago for his beloved, an elf druid named Wyllow. Set in

a cavernous region carved by a tributary of the River Sargauth,

this level is dominated by the Wyllowwood, a thriving forest

nourished by sunlight  ltered through a massive portal in the

sky above. Other notable features include a temple of the

Destroyer and a long-abandoned lakeside village built by the

Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn.

UM SLD: THE LOST LEVEL

Entombed in solid rock, the Lost Level is almost inaccessible, and

its primary egress is said to be a portal guarded by the Ring of

Death, a waiting ring of death kissMF beholderkin, death tyrant

beholderkin, and the beholder lord Nagus (LE advanced 20 HD

beholder sorcerer 8). The Lost Level is divided into three sec-

tionsa temple of Dumathoin and crypt for Clan Melairkyns

rulers, a drow prison now dominated by Huntmistress Dhusarra

(CE female Calishite human vampire  ghter 2/cleric 14 [Malar]),

and a massive cavern carved by a branch of the River Sargauth

and now split by an earthquake-caused tremor.

UM SLE: TROBRIANDS GRAVEYARD

The  Stout  Folk  originally  mined  this  sublevel  for  mithral,

leaving  it,  by  chance  or  for  mysterious  reasons,  in  the  crude

image  of  a  scorpion.  Before  Halasters  Higharvestide,  the

Realm of the Metal Masters was home to Trobriands rejected

constructs, built before he perfected his scaladars. By Halasters

Higharvestide, Trobriands cast-offs had organized themselves

into a self-governing community for mutual defense, and they

took advantage of the chaos to escape through a portal to their

masters secret sanctum (UM L7) and claim it for themselves.

In the wake of their departure, this level was largely abandoned,

but it didnt remain that way for long. After being driven from

Undermountain by the Eye, Misker the Pirate Tyrant (see page

65)  ed to this level and made it his own. Now a portal links the

beholders lair to the Ilzimmer Villa ($40), and House Ilzimmer

has begun storing its ill-gotten gains herein.

UM SLF: THE SLITHERSWAMP

Located deep beneath the city of Waterdeep, the Slitherswamp

is a largely unexplored sublevel between UM L4 and UM L5.

Further details of this level are revealed in Serpent Kingdoms.

UM SLG: MUIRALS GAUNTLET

Muirals  Gauntlet  is  a  sublevel  built  by  the  drow  soon  after

their initial invasion that included living quarters and a warrior

academy.  Muiral  transformed  these  chambers  into  a  trap-

 lled gauntlet haunted by giant spiders, undead, and driders.

Although  the  monstrous  mage  has  abandoned  this  area,  his

deadly creations remain.

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

UM SLH: TROGLODYTE WARRENS

This  region  of  caves  is  accessible  only  by  a  two-way  random

portal.  It  is  home  to  two  warring  tribes  of  troglodytesthe

Urggroth-Kyan clan and the Szygmog-Thurgin clan.

UM SLI: THE OBSTACLE COURSE

The Obstacle Course is a sublevel composed of a long chain of

trap- lled rooms. Carved from the earth by the will of Tyr, this

sublevel is intended as a potentially lethal test for conceited, cocky

braggarts who do not respect the dangers of adventuring.

UM SLJ: MADDGOTHS LEVEL

Maddgoths Level is a small sublevel famed for the presence of

Maddgoths castle. Built by Halaster, this miniature,  oating

castle is enveloped in a reduction  eld that reduces all creatures

within it to one-twelfth their normal size.

UM SLK: THE CRYSTAL LABYRINTH

The drow constructed this chamber as a training ground for

their  young  in  the  Year  of  the  Blue  Ice  (148  DR).  Halaster

discovered it in the Year of Secret Slaughters (326 DR) and made

it his own, with transparent crystal walls,  oors and ceilings,

and a coral- oored cavern  lled with seawater directly below. At

the heart of the labyrinth lies Halasters Aqitocrun, a treasure

chamber in which he stores prized possessions.

UM SLL: ARCTURIADOOM

This  level  was  long  the  private  demesne  of  Arcturia,  one  of

Halasters  most  ambitious  apprentices.  After  her  death  during

Halasters Higharvestide, contingency magics whisked her corpse

to her sanctuary, leaving the illusion of a body in their wake.

Thanks  to  careful  preparations,  Arcturia  was  reborn  as  a  vile

form of undead (CE half-fey female Chondathan human worm

that walksEL wizard  15). She now works to restock the monsters

guarding this level, now known to a handful of daring explorers

as Arcturiadoom.

UM SLM: VANRAKDOOM

This sublevel was claimed by Lord Vanrak Moonstar (see page

62) for the followers of the Night Maiden in the Year of the

Howling Moon (1130 DR). A sprawling shadow-cloaked temple

of Shar and an army of creatures from the Plane of Shadow

that defend the abbey dominate Vanrakdoom.

The Gauntlet Below

The Gauntlet Below consists of the lowest three levels of Un-

dermountain. It is so named for the gauntlet of dangers it poses

to creatures from the Realms Below attempting to make their

way up into Undermountains heart. Halasters constructs and

immigrants from the Underdark who want to prevent others

from following them upward man the various forti cations built

by the Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn.

UM L7: THE CAVERNS OF OOZE

Largely avoided by the Stout Folk of Clan Melairkyn in their

day, the Caverns of Ooze have long been home to all manner

of slimy creatures serving That Which Lurks. Countless slimes,

oozes, jellies, and other amorphous creatures frequent these natural

caverns. For centuries, a colony of ghaunadansMF has attempted

to transform this level into a massive temple of Ghaunadaur, but

Halaster has continued to frustrate such efforts. Many suspect that

the inhabitants of this region emanate from the bottom side of

the planar breach that lies at the bottom of the Pit of Ghaunadaur

(UM L3) and make their way down through a warren of narrow

tubes, but such a connection has never been proven.

Trobriand the Metal Mage (see page 28) once had his private

sanctum on this level, but it was overrun by constructs from

UM SLE during Halasters Higharvestide.

UM L8: THE TERMINUS LEVEL

The Terminus Level is a mix of dwarf-built chambers, now-depleted

mithral mines, and vast natural caverns. Many of the one-way

portals used by Halaster to restock Undermountain with dangerous

monsters open into the sprawling caverns of Undermountains

eighth layer. Additionally, the Mad Mages failed or freed experi-

ments also wander this level. The Terminus Level connects with

the heart of Undermountain through the Shaft (UM SLB).

UM L9: THE MAD WIZARDS LAIR

Built by Clan Melairkyn as a trading outpost, Undermountains

ninth level is linked to the Underdark by a large number of

sinkholes, each ringed by forti cations allowing a small number

of defenders to hold off almost any invader. This level was one

of the  rst to fall to the drow, who then quickly made their way

up the Shaft (UM SLB) into the heart of Undermountain.

Said to hold the fabled treasure of Halaster the Mad, this level

is whispered of in Waterdhavian taverns late at night by those

who dare to dream of plumbing the depths of Undermountain.

Of course, Halaster himself has spread many of these rumors, in

hopes of inducing more adventurers to die foolish deaths in his

trap- lled Underhalls. In reality, Undermountains ultimate level

is one big gauntlet of nasty traps and horrifying monsters.

The waiting treasure is also the subject of much speculation.

Some whisper that vaults full of hundreds of mighty magic items

and countless gems lie hidden in the depths of Halasters Lair,

while others claim that Halasters greatest and cruelest joke is

that the legendary hoard is no more than a pittance.

Ilvastarr Vault

Like most Waterdhavian noble families, the Ilvastarr clan has

at least one secret vault hidden within the City of Splendors.

Such vaults serve to hold family heirlooms, records, and hard

currency  savings.  They  also  prove  useful  for  hiding  embar-

rassing secrets and covering up the misdeeds of the past. The

Ilvastarr Vault is typical of such repositories. As such, it can be

easily adapted to serve as the vault of any other noble family.

The exact location of the Ilvastarr Vault is left up to the DM

to determine, although the most likely location is somewhere

beneath the Ilvastarr Villa (N53) or an otherwise anonymous

warehouse in Dock Ward.

This adventure site is suitable for characters of 3rd to 5th

level.

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

Character Hooks

The PCs might become interested in this hidden vault through

one of the hooks below.

The Belabrantan family has long suspected the Ilvastarr heirs

of concealing the Griffontack of Belabranta, a set of heirloom

magic items lost over three centuries ago during the Battle of

Blood-Drenched Swords. Lord Moedt Belabranta, heir of House

Belabranta, hires the characters to break into the Ilvastarr Vault

and settle the matter once and for all.

Lord Gotom Ilvastarr, heir to House Ilvastarr, approaches

the characters discreetly through a trusted intermediary. He is

concerned  that  his  elder  brother,  Lord  Ulguth  II  (LE  male

Tethyrian human aristocrat 11), has been seen making repeated,

clandestine visits to the Ilvastarr vault for no apparent reason.

Lord Gotom hires the PCs to follow his brother into the vault and

discover what he is doing without confronting him directly.

Vault Layout

The Ilvastarr Vault has been designed to deter would-be thieves,

while still allowing straightforward access to a member of House

Ilvastarr familiar with the defenses.

Stonework: All areas have 10-foot-high, barrel-vaulted, bare

stone ceilings unless speci ed otherwise. The walls are made of

mortared blocks of stone quarried from the Sword Mountains.

Strong Wooden Doors (locked): 2 in. thick; hardness 5; hp

20 hp; break DC 23; Open Lock DC 25.

V1: CHAMBER OF THE CROUCHING WYRM (EL 11)

This  room  contains  a  stone  golem,  a  creature  normally  far

too strong for low-level characters to face. Here, it is intended

to  serve  as  an  obstacle  in  this  encounter,  not  an  opponent.

Characters need only retreat out of the creatures reach, and

it will not strike them. Figuring out how to get the golem to

move isnt easy, but it should be a better solution than  ghting

such a strong monster.

The stairs lead down and south to one end of an arched barrel

vault,  30  feet  long.  Two  smaller  side-vaults  form  hallways

alongside the main vault. In the center of the room on a low,

octagonal pedestal crouches a statue in the shape of a stone man

with draconic features, ready to pounce.

Unlike the rest of the Ilvastarr vault, the  oor of this room

is relatively dust-free, suggesting that most visitors do not go

past this room.

Trap: The dais beneath the golem is warded by an alarm

spell. It is set to trigger a mental alarm if anyone steps into

area V1 without saying the word Wyrmbait. If, and only if,

Lord Gotom Ilvastarr (the Ilvastarr heir) is within one mile of

the vault (65% chance), the alarm alerts him to the presence

of intruders in the family vault. Lord Gotoms planned response

is to dispatch the house guard (treat as a double contingent of

a standard Watch patrol, as detailed on page 36). Depending

on where you place the vault, it can take anywhere from a few

rounds to an hour or more before the Ilvastarr guards arrive.

Alarm: CR 1; magic device; proximity trigger (alarm); au-

tomatic reset; Atk n/a; Search DC 26; Disable Device DC 26.

Creature: Despite its unusual appearance, the statue is simply a

stone golem. It ignores the presence of intruders unless they attack

it or try to move it. If so provoked, it attacks anyone in the room,

but does not leave the chamber. If anyone in the room prominently

displays the Ilvastarr pendant, the stone golem immediately ceases

its attack and moves to the west side of the room.

Stone Golem (1): hp 107; Monster Manual page 137.

Secret Exit: A secret stairway beneath the golems pedestal

leads down to area V4 (Search DC 20). If the stone golem is

destroyed or induced to move aside, the low round stone pedestal

can be rotated aside, swinging away on a pivot rod in the

west side of the pedestal. The pedestal easily turns

clockwise, but doing so triggers the trap (a glyph

of  warding,  described  below).  If  the  pedestal

is  turned  counterclockwise,  the  trap  remains

untriggered.

Traps: Three pit traps line the halls of V2. Pits A and B are

wide-mouthed spiked pit traps. They are triggered when a character

walks over the center square, though characters in the squares

adjacent to the center square are also threatened when the trap

is sprung. Pit C is a simple deep pit trap, with no spikes.

Wide-Mouth Spiked Pit Trap (A and B): CR 4; mechanical;

location trigger; manual reset; Re ex DC 20 avoids; 20 ft. deep

(2d6, fall); multiple targets ( rst target in each of two adjacent

5-ft squares); pit spikes (Atk +10 melee, 1d4 spikes per target for

1d4+2 each); Search DC 18; Disable Device 25.

Deep  Pit  (C):  CR1;  mechanical;  location  trigger;  manual

reset; hidden switch bypass (Search DC 25);

Re ex DC 15 avoids; 20 ft. deep (2d6,

fall); single target; Search DC 20;

Disable Device DC 23.

Development: The fact that

one  of  the  three  pit  traps  is

less dangerous than the others

is an indirect clue that some-

one might enter it deliberately.

There is a secret door in the

east wall at the bottom of the

pit  (Search  DC  20)  leading

to area V7.

PITS A AND B:

GUARDGOYLE PITS

(EL 5)

These two pits contain more

than  just  deadly  spikes.  At

the  bottom  of  each  pit  are

two  small  niches,  hidden

from direct view above.

Ad-Hoc Experience Award:

It is assumed that a stone golem

is too dif cult for the PCs to

defeat,  given  the  intended

rest  of  the  encounters.  If

the characters manage to

circumvent the golem and

enter area V4, award them

experience points as if they

defeated a CR 5 creature.

V2: HUNTING WAYS

(EL 5)

The east-west passageway and the

north-south  archways  compose

the hunting grounds of the creatures in V3.

The bottom of the spike- lled

pit  is  littered  with  bones  and

other debris. To the left and right

are small niches  lled with leering

gargoyle statues. Suddenly, one slashes at you

with its claws, while the other yanks on a

rope above you, making a clattering racket.

An adventurer visits the guardgoyle pit

Three dust- and cobweb- lled doorways lead off into the gloom

from the chamber of the statue, opening into a short east-west cor-

ridor. Two more doorways lead south beyond this passageway.

No creatures guard area V2, but the watchspiders of V3 are

trained to attack and kill intruders in this area.

Creatures: See area V3.

Tactics: The watchspiders in area V3 are alerted to the presence

of intruders by making successful Listen or Spot checks. When

in this area, the watchspiders exhibit a pack mentality and degree

of coordination unknown to their mindless kin. They are well

aware of the location of the pit traps and do their best to herd

foes into the pits, if at all possible.

A rope leads from a hook on the back of one niche to a sideways

wooden sliding door above the east niche.

Creature: Each niche houses a guardgoyle.

Guardgoyle (2): hp 21 each; see page 135.

Tactics:  Neither  guardgoyle  leaves  its  niche  unless  forced,

as doing so would expose it to attacks from above. While one

guardgoyle attacks, the other guardgoyle pulls on the rope. This

has the effect of pulling the sliding door across the pit, cutting

it in two. Anyone attempting to rescue a comrade trapped down

below must  rst descend to the wooden door and push the door

partway back (a full-round action) before joining the combat. The

pit spikes (see area V2) make one attack per round against any

creature standing in the bottom of the pit (but not the niches)

unless the creature succeeds on a DC 10 Balance check.

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

V3: SPIDERS DEN (EL 4)

This room is the lair of the four trained watchspiders that guard

the upper level of the Ilvastarr Vault.

The  passage  opens  into  a  long  room,  some  ten  feet  wide  and

twenty- ve feet long with a barrel vault ceiling running east-west.

The room is  lled with cobwebs, and bones of humanoid-sized

creatures litter the  oor.

The spiders are found herein only if they have not already been

alerted to the presence of intruders in area V2.

Creature  (EL  4):  Four  watchspiders  make  this  chamber

their lair. The spiders have been trained to obey anyone speaking

Draconic.

Watchspiders (4): hp 11 each; see page 140.

Treasure: The largest watchspider has a small amulet tied to

its rear left leg, nearly obscured by the spiders thick pelt. It read-

ily surrenders the Ilvastarr pendant if so ordered in Draconic.

Scattered  about  the  room  are  a  handful  of  coins  collectively

worth 200 gp. A DC 10 Search check is required to  nd more

than a quarter of the coins.

V4: CHAMBER OF FRESCOES

But for the frescoes described below, this chamber is empty.

The  trapdoor  leads  down  to  a   ve-foot-square  alcove,  which

opens onto a barrel-vaulted chamber some twenty feet long and

 fteen feet wide. At the far end of the room, passageways lead

east and west. The walls of this chamber are lined with frescoes

depicting  daring  individuals  (most  likely  members  of  House

Ilvastarr) capturing fearsome beasts, including chimera, dragons,

manticores, and gigantic snakes.

V5: WEST VAULT

Although the vault was once used for storage, it is now home

to a shameful family legacy.

The door opens into a barrel-vaulted chamber some  fteen feet

square. In the center of the room lies a low, black marble bier.

Atop the bier rests a suit of full plate armor in repose. On the

far wall is a large steel shield emblazoned with a metallic green

dragon rampant with a bright orange eye. The dragon appears to

balance a set of scales on its long, forked tongue.

The late Lord Haran Ilvastarr, granduncle of the current lord,

was a noted paladin of Helm and ward civilar (captain) of the

city watch in his day. During the Guild Wars, he deliberately

withdrew several Watch patrols from one neighborhood, allowing

an allied merchant family to attack a rival family and burn their

villa to the ground. His per dy came to light during the reign

of the Lords-Magister, and as his crimes were directed at an ally

of House Zoar, he was summarily tried and hung. Members of

House Ilvastarr took possession of the body and hid it away in

this crypt, fearful of what might arise from his remains. A cleric

of Tymora cast a hallow spell herein, preventing Lord Haran

from rising as an undead creature.

Treasure:  Lord  Harans  bones  lie  within  the  +1  full  plate

armor. The shield, known as the Ilvastarr bulwark, is a +1 heavy

steel shield. It is recognizable with a DC 20 Knowledge (history)

check or a DC 15 Knowledge (local Waterdeep) check as the device

of the infamous Lord Haran Ilvastarr. The bearer of the shield

gains a 4 circumstance penalty on Charisma-based checks made

against anyone of nonevil alignment who recognizes the device.

Development:  Should  any  part  of  Lord  Harans  mortal

remains  be  removed  from  this  chamber  for  any  reason,  his

spirit will no longer be constrained from rising as an undead

monster. Within 24 hours, his remains transform him into a

LE male huecuvaFF ex-paladin 9. The monster then rampages

through the city, attacking anyone it sees. If word of the PCs

involvement in the huecuvas rampage should get out, members

of House Ilvastarr hire rumormongers to spread their infamy

far and wide (and thus de ect shame from their own house).

V6: EAST VAULT (EL 5)

The  Ilvastarr  family  uses  the  east  vault  to  hold  important

business records, as well as part of the family savings. It also

contains the evidence of a past theft theyve never acknowledged

or attempted to make right.

The door opens into a barrel-vaulted chamber some  fteen feet

square and twenty feet tall. As the door opens, a gravelly voice

from somewhere above the doorframe calls out, Uninvited guests,

I presume? Please do not force me to destroy you.

Unfortunately for the characters, this room also contains a deadly

guardian, as referenced by the mysterious voice.

Creature: In a 5-foot-deep niche above the doorway, lurks a

spectator tasked with guarding the contents of the western vault.

Eye  Rays  (Su):  Each  of  a  spectators  four  small  eyes  can

produce a magic ray once per round, as a free action. During a

single round, it can aim only one eye ray at targets in any one

90-degree arc (up, forward, backward, left, right, or down). The

remaining eyes must aim at targets in other arcs, or not at all.

Each ray has a range of 60 feet and a save DC of 14 (caster

level 6th). The save DCs are Charisma-based. The four eye rays

include the following:

Fatigue: The target must make a successful Fortitude save

or become fatigued. An already fatigued creature that fails this

save becomes exhausted.

ADVENTURES IN WATERDEEP

Telepathy: A spectator can communicate telepathically with

its target for the round. As a free action, a spectator can make a

suggestion (as the spell) to any creature with whom it is currently

telepathically speaking.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/daycreate  food  and  water;  1/

dayplane shift (DC 17). Caster level 6th.

Flight (Ex): A spectators body is naturally buoyant. This

buoyancy allows it to  y at a speed of 20 feet. This buoyancy

also grants it a permanent feather fall effect (as the spell) with

personal range.

Planar Fast Healing (Ex): While in the House of the Triad

in the domain of Everwatch, a spectator has fast healing 1.

Spell Turning (Su): A spectators central eye produces a 90-

foot cone that re ects spells cast upon it back upon its source.

This functions just like spell turning (caster level 6th). Up to

one spell can be re ected per round.

Tactics: The spectator is tasked with protecting the contents

of the room, and it does not deviate from that task. It knows

it has the high ground and a good defensive position from its

niche, and it is unlikely to drop down unless forced. That said,

the spectator, named Qilnax, is eager to talk to adventurers. It

refrains from attacking unless forced to do so by its responsibilities

or imminent danger, preferring instead to issue warnings like

If you step in the room, I will be forced to destroy you, and

neither of us would like that.

Treasure: The room is  lled with a dozen small chests, none of

which are locked or trapped. Ten of the chests are  lled with non-

magical scrolls detailing the past history and business transactions

of House Ilvastarr. These records are not the only copies owned

by House Ilvastarr, and individually, they are largely worthless.

However, the scrolls might fetch as much as 200 gp from one of

the familys merchant rivals. The eleventh chest contains 2,000

gp worth of silver trade bars, worth 50 gp apiece. The twelfth

chest contains the griffontack of Belabranta (see below).

Development: Stealing and selling House Ilvastarrs business

secrets earns the enmity of that house. Their vengeance is likely

to take the form of hired assassins for a total expenditure equal

to the value of the lost business (probably in the thousands of

gold  pieces).  Stealing  the  griffontack  of  Belabranta  is  likely

to engender the same response, as House Ilvastarr desperately

seeks the items recovery before their complicity in the original

theft becomes public. Displaying the griffontack prominently

will  eventually  come  to  the  attention  of  House  Belabranta.

The Belabranta family will initially assume that the PCs are

not the original thieves, though they will insist that they are

obligated to return the items to the original owners. Once

House Ilvastarr realizes House Belabranta is aware of the items

reemergence, they hire rumormongers to attempt to pin the

blame on the player characters.

Griffontack of Belabranta: House Belabranta has long been

associated  with  griffon  breeding  and  taming  in  the  City  of

Splendors,  and  its  handlers  have  raised  most  of  the  griffons

owned by the City Guard of Waterdeep. The members of House

Belabranta trace their ancestry back to Ilithrew Belabranta, a

hero of the second Trollwar (940 DR to 952 DR) famed for his

bravery and prowess on griffonback.

Early  in  the  twelve-year-long  war,  Ilithrew  seized  a  large

cache of coins from the hoard of a giant three-headed troll. He

wisely used much of his treasure to commission a set of magic

items to increase his effectiveness in battle. These items came

to be known as the griffontack of Belabranta. In the aftermath

of  the  Second  Trollwar,  House  Belabranta  became  part  of

Waterdeeps merchant nobility, and family patriarchs proudly

displayed Ilithrews tack and lance as a symbol of the house.

In the Year of Crimson Magics (1026 DR), the Black Claw

horde emerged from the depths of the Sword Mountains and

swept down the Dessarin River valley to encircle the City of

Splendors. Nobles and commoners alike died in Battle of Blood-

Drenched Swords, as the populace of Waterdeep fought to beat

back the orc assault. Among those who sacri ced their lives for

the  city  were  Lord  Palinor  Belabranta  and  his  griffon  steed.

A hail of arrows brought down the brave beast, and his rider

vanished into a sea of orcish warriors. After the battle was won,

Lord Palinors heir searched far and wide for his fathers body, but

it had vanished along with Ilithrews legendary griffontack.

It has been three centuries since the griffontack of Belabranta

was last seen, but the heirs of House Belabranta have never ceased

looking for it. For almost as long as it has been missing, they

have harbored suspicions that the ancestors of House Ilvastarr

plundered Palinors body in the confusion of the battle and that

the griffontack of Belabranta lies unused in the vaults of the

Ilvastarr villa. House Ilvastarr of course denies such accusations,

suggesting instead that the griffontack lines the hoard of some

orcish chieftain, but the bad blood between the two houses stem-

ming from this dispute has never abated.

The griffontack consists of  ve pieces, all inscribed with the

Belabrantan crest: the Belabrantan caparison of warmth*, a bit

and bridle of griffonriding*, a griffon lancesaddle*, a lance of

burning black re*, and a ring of feather falling.

V7: VISAGEWAY

This area is accessible only through the secret door in the bottom

of pit C in area V2.

The secret door reveals a hand-hewn crawlway bending north-

ward around a corner. As you pass around the corner, you see

before you a leering, hideous visage of carved stone at the end

of the crawlway. A flickering torch stuck in a sconce near the

visage casts a shadowy orange glow. You can just make out the

shape of a dark black tome resting on the visages tongue.

The  face  is  a  depiction  of  Gormauth  Souldrinker,  an  aspect

of  Gargauth,  and  the  crawlway  serves  as  a  tiny  chapel.  The

visage is the center of an unhallow spell with a cause fear spell

(DC 13)  xed to it.

Treasure: The torch is a continual  ame torch. The black

tome appears to be the diary of Lord Ulguth Ilvastarr II,  rst

son of the current patriarch. It is  lled with the hateful scribings

of a man consumed with bitterness and a lust for power; Ulguth

believed he had discovered a dark deity who would give him the

great power he felt he deserved. The book is also a cursed magic

item, acting as a vacuous grimoire for anyone who peruses it

without acknowledging Gargauth as his or her patron deity.

such creatures are commonly encountered in and around the

Dweomervores are small, thieving dragons that feed on charged

magic items and wield a telekinetic breath weapon as both a tool

and a weapon.

Dweomervores are fairly intolerant of their own kind, rarely

dwelling within ten miles of each other without entering into a

protracted feud, but they enjoy the company of other dragons.

Dweomervores  are  asexual,  reproducing  (after  reaching   fty

years of age) by absorbing all the charges from a magic item

in 10 minutes and then laying a single egg after a tenday of

gestation.  They  protect  their  young   ercely  until  they  reach

maturity (within a tenday of birth).

Although they can be encountered almost anywhere, dweo-

mervores are typically found in large, prosperous, magic-rich

MONSTERS OF WATERDEEP

cities,  such  as  Bezantur,  Silverymoon,  and  Waterdeep,  where

wands are fairly plentiful. Many quickly ensconce themselves

as the heads of small thieves guilds specializing in the theft of

charged magic items. In the wilds, dweomervores favor sprawling

aboveground ruins where adventurers are common (such as Myth

Drannor and Shoonach) and they can  y overhead invisibly while

searching for targets.

Dweomervores speak Common, Auran,

and Draconic, but since they can use tongues

as a spell-like ability at will, they rarely have

dif culty communicating. These crea-

tures are phenomenally long-lived,

and  they  can  reach  ages  of   ve

hundred years or more if they are careful.

Combat

Dweomervores lurk in and around ruins, taverns,

and other locales frequented by adventurers.

They observe potential prey before attempting

a theft, hoping to discern which members of a

group have charged items, such as wands. A

dweomervore attempts to steal as many such

items as is possible using its breath weapon

from a place of hiding. If discovered,

a  dweomervore  uses  any  stolen  items

against  their  owners  before  closing

to slash with its barbed tail attack.

Dweomervores  are  usually  more

interested  in  stealing  magic  than

killing,  but  if  hard  pressed,  they

use  all  their  abilities  to  defend

themselves.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):

A  dweomervore  has  a  unique

telekinetic breath weapon that it can use

once every 1d4 rounds. It can duplicate the combat

maneuver or violent thrust versions of the telekinesis spell (caster

level 10th), with a maximum range of 100 feet. Its breath weapon

manifests as shimmering golden waves of force.

Since it can affect creatures of up to 250 pounds, the dweo-

mervore can pick up and hurl most creatures of Medium size or

smaller (Will DC 15 negates). Against larger creatures, it must

employ a combat maneuver or settle for hurling other objects at

its target. A dweomervore cannot maintain its telekinetic breath

weapon after its turn ends, so it usually chooses maneuvers such

as bull rush, trip, or disarm that can be resolved on its turn (its

modi er for resolving these attempts is +14).

Telekinetic  Filch  (Su):  A  dweomervore  can  use  an  effect

similar  to  a  telekinesis  spell  to  manipulate  objects  weighing

5  pounds  or  less  at  a  distance  of  up  to  60  feet.  Unattended

nonmagical objects receive no saving throw against this attack,

but attended or magic objects can attempt a DC 17 Will save

to resist. The save DC is Charisma-based. A dweomervore can

manipulate objects in this manner with amazing grace, and if it

wishes to take an object from a person without being detected,

it can make a Sleight of Hand check to do so. Dweomervores

135

are fond of stealing improperly stowed wands and scrolls from

the pockets of unwary victims by using this ability.

Magic Drain (Su): As a full-round action, a dweomervore

can place any charged magic item (for example, staves or wands)

in its mouth and consume 1d6 charges. Each charge consumed

in this manner is drained without activating any of the objects

powers, and each charge so drained cures the dweomervore of

5 points of damage. Excess hit points gained in this

manner are gained as temporary hit points, and

they persist for 1 hour. A dweomervore can

only  have  a  number  of  temporary  hit

points equal to its full normal total.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  will

blur, color spray (DC 15), daze

(DC 14), detect magic, identify,

invisibility,  reduce  person

(DC  15),  see  invisibility,

obscuring  mist,  tongues.

Caster  level  7th.  The

save DCs are Charisma-

based.

Tail  Barbs  (Ex):  A  dweo-

mervores  tail  is  studded  with

numerous  razor-sharp  barbs.

These  barbs  can  in ict  terrible

wounds.  A  wound  caused  by  the

creatures  tail  continues  to  bleed

at the rate of 1 point of damage per

round.  The  bleeding  persists  until

it is magically healed or staunched

with a DC 15 Heal check. Multiple

hits result in cumulative bleeding

damage.

Skills:  Dweomervores  have

a +4 racial bonus on Use Magic

Device checks.

Alignment: Always neutral

Advancement:  34  HD  (Small);  56  HD

Level Adjustment: 

This creature looks like a grotesque, winged

humanoid about the size of a hal ing, with

a horned head and long, curving fangs jut-

ting from its mouth. It seems to be carved

from a block of solid stone.

Originally  devised  by  the  Zhentarim,

guardgoyles  are  commonly  found  in

tombs,  vaults,  and  manses  of  wealthy

merchants  and  nobles  across  Faern.

They are most frequently encountered in

wealthy cities with populations of arcane

spellcasters  for  hire,  such  as  Calimport,

Saerloon,  Selgaunt,  Silverymoon,  Water-

deep, and Zhentil Keep.

Created to guard valuable items, guardgoyles

protect their charges with absolute loyalty. A

guardgoyle can only be commanded to defend

a speci c item. It remains close by and inert

until its is attacked, until its charge is dis-

turbed in any way, or until an intruder takes

a speci c observable action de ned by the

creatures master (which might be as simple

as entering this room.) A guardgoyle never

pursues intruders farther than 100 feet away

from the item it guards. Only the guardgoyles

creator, or those whom the guardgoyles creator orders

it to obey, can assign the creature a new guard task.

A  guardgoyle  can  be  directed  to  ignore  certain  individuals,

who must be easily described or physically present at the time the

guardgoyle is given its charge. If an ignored individual moves the

guarded item, a guardgoyle will do its best to follow. If a guardgoyle

loses track of the item it guards (for instance a keyed individual picks

the item up and teleports away), the guardgoyle becomes inert until

the item returns or it is given a new charge by its creator.

A guardgoyle is some 3 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. A

guardgoyle cannot speak, but it understands commands given

in any language its creator speaks.

Combat

Guardgoyles  are  straightforward  combatants,  shrieking  in

warning and then attacking with their natural weapons. In the

presence of spellcasters they cannot attack directly, they continue

to use their shriek ability to disrupt spellcasting.

Construct  Traits:  A  guardgoyle  has  immunity  to  poison,

magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

136

necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms,

compulsions, phantasm, patterns, and morale effects), and any

effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on

objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,  or

energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired.

It has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Guardgoyle

Poison (Ex): Injury or contact, Fortitude DC 11,

initial and secondary damage 1d4 Con. The save

DC is Charisma-based. A guardgoyle stores enough

poison in its fangs for two poisonous bites. After

that, its poison must be replenished. Other types

of poison are possible.

Shriek  (Su):  A  guardgoyle  can  emit

an  ear-piercing  shriek  in  a  cone-shaped

burst with a range of 30 feet. Any creature

within  the  area  is  deafened  for  1d2  rounds

and takes 2d6 points of sonic damage. A DC

11 Fortitude save negates the deafening effect

and reduces the damage by half. The save DC

is Charisma-based.

Alarm (Sp): If an item guarded by a guard-

goyle is disturbed in any way, the person who gave

the creature its charge receives a mental alarm

from the guardgoyle. The range of this ability is 1

mile; if the guardgoyles master is farther away, he is

not warned. The master notes a single mental ping

that awakens him from normal sleep but does not

otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has

no effect on a mental alarm.

Construction

A guardgoyles body is sculpted from granite or

basalt and coated with gem dust. The materials

cost 1,000 gp. The creatures master can assemble

the body or hire someone else to do the job. Creating

the  body  requires  a  DC  20  Craft  (sculpting)  check  or  a  DC

20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. After the body is sculpted, the

guardgoyle is animated through an extended magical ritual that

requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar

to an alchemists laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If

the creator is personally constructing the creatures body, the

building and the ritual can be performed together.

Damage to a guardgoyle can be repaired with a stone shape

spell; each such use restores 1d8 hit points to the creature. Repair

damage spells also work.

CL  7th;  Craft  Construct,  alarm,   y,  shout,  stone  shape,

Combat

If it can choose its ground, a leucrotta prefers to  ght beside

cliffs, ravines, and deep gullies. It attempts to trap a foe with his

back to empty air and then bull rushes to knock him back off

the edge. A leucrottas often uses Power Attack against lightly

armored foes, reducing its attack bonus to +8 and dealing 1d8+10

points of damage with its bite.

When  ghting intelligent prey, a leucrotta attempts to lure

one victim away from its allies and then torture it before killing

it. Then, using its mimicry ability, it attempts to lure additional

victims away from their fellows by replaying the screams

and words of its earlier victim.

Adamantine Bite (Ex): A leucrotta deals bite damage

as if its teeth were magic adamantine weapons both

for purposes of bypassing the hardness of objects

and for overcoming damage reduction. On

a critical hit, a leucrottas bite deals triple

damage.  A  leucrotta  often  attacks  its

opponents weapons and shields.

Immunities: A leucrotta is immune

to charm and compulsion effects.

Iron  Guts  (Ex):  A  leucrotta  can

eat almost anything, no matter how

rancid.  It  has  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Fortitude  saves  against  disease  and

poison.

Mimicry  (Ex):  A  leucrotta  has

the  ability  to  mimic  animal  cries

and  voices  in  any  language.  It  can

duplicate the voices of its victims, in-

cluding screams, with uncanny accuracy.

A leucrotta has a +8 racial bonus on Bluff

checks made to imitate another creatures

voice. A leucrotta uses its Wisdom modi er

(instead of Charisma) when making Bluff checks

and Disguise checks.

Sure-Footed (Ex): A leucrotta has a +4 racial

bonus on Balance checks, and it ignores movement

penalties for moving on slopes. However, a leucrotta lacks

Leucrotta

hands, and thus cannot climb ropes or vertical walls.

Leucrottas are the murderous bullies of the wilderness, living in

desolate areas far from civilization. Although cunning enough

to hunt humans, leucrottas prefer nonintelligent prey that will

not have relatives looking for vengeance. Leucrottas regularly

hunt more than they can consume, killing for sheer pleasure.

Few other creatures will touch a corpse slain by a leucrotta, for

them in the leucrottas nauseating stench.

Although  leucrottas  are  normally  found  in  the  wilds,  a

number  of  the  creatures  inhabit  the  middle  levels  of  Under-

mountain, most notably Skullport. They are allies of the Unseen

(see page 57), and they use their guile and talent for mimicry

to lure adventurers into ambushes.

Leucrottas can be dif cult to track, as their footprints are

identical to that of a mature stag.

Leucrotta speak Common, Draconic, and Giant.

Sometimes known as the greater leucrotta, the changesteed is a

leucrotta with doppelganger blood. Changesteeds prefer humanoid

 esh and hunt them more avidly than normal leucrottas do.

Changesteeds are frequently encountered in Undermountain

and the various sewers and dungeons of Waterdeep, where they

often serve the Unseen (see page 57).

Combat

In  addition  to  the  special  attacks  and  qualities  possessed  by

normal leucrottas, changesteeds also have the ability to assume

the form of other animals and beasts. Changesteeds often kill

a horse, hippogriff, or griffon, consume or hide its remains,

and pose as the slain creature. The changesteed later attacks

its  rider  when  they  reach  an

isolated locale.

This  scorpionlike  automaton  is  fashioned  of  interlocking  iron

and  zzles with electrical energy.

Scaladars are the creation of Trobriand the Metal Mage

(see page 28), an ex-apprentice of Halaster Blackcloak.

Formerly found only in Undermountain, scaladars

are beginning to spread to surrounding subterra-

nean and surface areas, either wandering away as

aimless killing machines or constructed elsewhere

by Trobriands former apprentices. Trobriand

has  released  a  handful  of  scaladars  into

the wild, ordering them to kill any living

creature  they  encounter  and  devour  the

remains. In recent years, a few

solitary sca-

ladars have

appeared in

Construction

A scaladars body is sculpted from 2,000 pounds of

pure iron, smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures

costing  at  least  5,000  gp.  Assembling  the  body

requires a DC 20 Craft (armorsmithing)

check or a DC 20 Craft (weaponsmith-

ing) check.

In addition, an existing ring of

Trobriand must be employed or

a new one created as part of

the process. (The cost of doing

so is not included in the cost or

price of the construct.)

CL 13th; Craft Construct, arcane

sight, limited wish, polymorph any object,

protection from energy, shield, caster

must be at least 13th level; Price

25,000  gp;  Cost  15,000  gp  +

800 XP.

Walking statue of Waterdeep

by  Trobriand  to  dispatch  his  foes

quietly.

Scaladars  are  often  employed  as

guardians,  and  they  are  usually  in-

structed to aid their fellow constructs if

they come under attack. Some scaladars

are employed as magic hunters, instructed

to swallow every magic item they encoun-

ter and use force if necessary to do so.

Scaladars  are  controlled  by  magic

rings known as rings of Trobriand*. Each

remains under the strict command of

whoever bears the ring of Trobriand*

linked to it at the time it was created,

and it follows its last set of instruc-

tions until instructed otherwise.

Combat

Scaladars attack  rst with their claws,

preferring to use their improved grab

to  grapple  opponents  and  then

follow  with  a  sting  attack  against

grappled or pinned opponents.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this

ability,  a  scaladar  must  hit  with  a  claw

attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple

as  a  free  action  without  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity.

Shocking Sting (Su): A scaladar deals 1d6 points of electric-

ity damage to creatures hit with its stinger, or 2d6 points of

electricity damage if its stinger is overcharged due to its electricity

absorption ability (see above).

Arcane Sight (Su): Scaladars see magical emanations as if

they were under the effects of the arcane sight spell.

Construct  Traits:  A  scaladar  has  immunity  to  poison,

magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms,

compulsions, phantasm, patterns, and morale effects), and any

effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on

objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,  or

energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired. It

has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Electricity Absorption (Ex): Scaladars are immune to elec-

tricity attacks. If a scaladar is subject to electricity damage, it

instead overcharges its shocking sting for a number of minutes

equal to the electricity damage dealt. While overcharged, each

sting attack the scaladar makes deals extra electricity damage

(see above). A scaladar cant overcharge itself or another scaladar

with its shocking sting.

Magic  Missile  Absorption  (Ex):  Scaladars  are  healed  by

magic missile spells, receiving a number of hit points equal to

the damage the spell would normally deal.

Skills: Scaladars have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and a

+4 racial bonus on Hide and Spot checks. They can always choose

to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

This enormous statue made from greenish-brown stone stands

almost forty feet tall. Its features are carved in the shape of

a vigilant warrior in armor. Its blank eyes glow with a faint

silvery sheen.

A walking statue is a mighty construct built for the defense

of holy temples, ancient vaults, and the most important cities,

castles, and fortresses. It often serves as an ethereal guardian that

attacks other ethereal creatures approaching its guarded area.

Unlike  most  constructs,  a  walking

statue  is  a  free-willed,  thinking

creature that can reason, learn,

and  remember.  It  might  pass

centuries at a time unmoving

but  endlessly  vigilant,  think-

ing  deep  and  slow  thoughts.

It  understands  Common  and

Draconic,  but  only  speaks  if

commanded  to  do  so  by  its

creator  (or  whatever  creature

it recognizes as an appropriate

authority).

A walking statue is unswerv-

ingly loyal to its instructions or

orders, and it carries them out

to the best of its ability.

Combat

A walking statue is a fearsome

opponent, capable of crushing

all but the most powerful foes

with  its  immense  strength

and size. It uses its Awesome

Blow  and  Improved  Overrun

feats to scatter and knock down

smaller opponents. It commonly

uses Power Attack against smaller and weaker

foes, reducing its attack bonus to +25 and increasing its

damage to 6d6+25.

A walking statues natural attacks are treated as magic and

adamantine  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Planar Disjunction (Su): Once every 7 rounds, a walking

statue can create a planar disjunction in a 120-foot-radius burst

centered on itself. All ethereal creatures and objects within this

area (other than the statue itself) must succeed on a DC 26

Will save or be forced onto the Material Plane and stunned

for 1d4 rounds. Ghosts are forced to manifest when caught in

a planar disjunction. Creatures with the ability to return to the

Ethereal Plane (or, in the case of a ghost, stop manifesting)

cannot do so for 1 full round after being expelled by a planar

disjunction.

Construct Traits: A walking statue has immunity to poison,

magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,

necromancy effects, mind-affecting spells and abilities (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any

MONSTERS OF WATERDEEP

effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on

objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal

damage,  ability  damage,  ability  drain,  fatigue,  exhaustion,  or

energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired. It

has darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Ethereal Jaunt (Su): A walking statue can shift itself and

any  creature  it  touches  or  grapples  to  or  from  the  Ethereal

Plane as a free action. Unwilling creatures touched or grappled

by the walking statue are entitled to DC 26 Will saves to resist

this effect (if successful, the creature remains

on  the  other  plane  while  the  statue  shifts

away). Once it uses this ability, it must wait

10 minutes before it shifts again.

Fast Healing (Ex): A walking

statue heals 5 points of damage

each round so long as it has at

least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0

hit points, it is destroyed.

See Invisibility (Su): A walking

statue  can  continuously  use  see

invisibility, as the spell.

This eight-legged, eight-eyed arachnid has a sleek body, large head

and fangs, and an excessively hairy body and legs. Its eyes gleam

with feral intelligence, suggestive of a preternatural cunning.

Watchspiders are fairly common in the cellars and warehouses

of guild houses and rich merchants. They are trained to obey a

single master, who can order them not to attack certain beings.

All watchspiders are schooled in disabling spellcasters and in

avoiding weapons set against their leap attack (spears and large

piercing weapons). Moreover, they can be trained so that most

attack while another rings an alarm bell or drinks from a basin

containing a magic potion before joining a  ght.

Watchspiders are indigenous to Tharsult, where the natives

 rst trained the species as guards. The Mhairuun merchant

family brought watchspiders and their breeding and training

processes north to Waterdeep, swiftly establishing a lucrative

business with this rare commodity. After sixty years of breeding

in the North, watchspiders can be found in Sword Coast cities

from Neverwinter to Lantan, all purchased and shipped from

Waterdeep. While still a creature of more temperate climes,

watchspiders  have  adapted  to  the  Sword

Coast with the growth of heavier hair

(almost  fur),  but  they  still  cannot

survive the cold any further north

than Neverwinter.

A  watchspider  can  serve  as a n

animal companion (if the character has

an effective druid level of 4th or higher),

a familiar (at 3rd level or higher, with the

Improved Familiar feat), or a mount.

Watchspiders  spin  webs  to  use

as  lairs  but  rove  about  hunting

prey. They exhibit more of a pack

mentality  than  true  vermin  and  a

degree  of  coordination  unknown  to

their mindless relatives.

Poison  (Ex):  Injury,  Fortitude  DC

13;  initial  and  secondary  damage  1d4

Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Web  (Ex):  A  watchspider  often  waits

in its web or in a tree, then lowers itself

silently on silk strands and leaps onto prey

passing  beneath.  A  single  strand  is  strong

enough to support a spider and one creature

of the same size.

This storklike creature has long blue legs and a

ravenlike head with a sharp, straight beak.

The creatures plumage is breathtaking, with

thin, prismatic feathers cascading down its

back. It has a magni cent, brightly colored

crest and long tailfeathers similar to those

of a bird of paradise.

The wilora is a cunning and deceptive

creature that can steal the memories

of  those  who  meet  its  gaze;  it  can

then assume the form of its victims at will.

creation of Beshaba, formed from the eggs of tropical birds

that have been soaked in the blood of doppelgangers. Indeed,

the  similarity  between  the  wiloras  abilities  and  those  of  a

doppelganger seems more than coincidental.

Wiloras  commonly  adopt  the  guise  of  a  local  species  of

bird, and then search for particularly interesting or intriguing

individuals from which to steal hedonistic or amusing memo-

ries. Wiloras are sometimes befriended by thieves guilds; their

unusual talents can be used to great effect in the creation of

alibis, the blackmailing of wealthy targets, and the extraction

of  information  from  prisoners  or  public  of cials.  However,

should that relationship falter, a wilora can do great damage

by exposing the guilds criminal activities.

Wiloras speak Common, Auran, and any languages known

by the form they take using their alternate form ability.

Combat

A wilora forced into combat in its natural form relies heavily

on its hypnotic songit is far from a dangerous creature in

melee. When forced into melee in its true form, it claws with its

talons and hopes for the best. A wilora hides and rests during

the day. At night, the wilora takes full advantage of its alternate

forms when forced into combat. If it doesnt have access to a

humanoid form, a cornered wilora is quick to assume the form

of a birdlike beast to  ght more effectively.

Hypnotic Song (Su): While in its true form, as a full-round

action a wilora can trill a captivating song that affects all living

creatures within a 30-foot spread. Such creatures must succeed

on a DC 14 Will save or become entranced by the song as if

by a hypnotism spell. This is a mind-affecting sonic attack. The

save DC is Charisma-based. A bards countersong ability allows

a hypnotized creature to attempt a new Will save.

Memory-Snatching Gaze (Su): If a wilora meets the gaze

of a helpless or willing target (such as a target that has been

hypnotized by its song) within 30 feet, the victim must succeed

on a DC 14 Will saving throw, or its memories and knowledge

become accessible to the wilora through an intrusive telepathic

link. The save DC is Charisma-based. After the link is estab-

lished, closing ones eyes, being blinded, or looking away from

the wiloras gaze has no effect, but moving more than 30 feet

away  breaks  the  link.  Each  round  the  victim  can  attempt  a

new saving throw to break the link, but in each round when

the victim fails the saving throw, the wilora learns the answer

to one question to the best of the victims knowledge. These

questions are posed telepathically, and the answers are imparted

directly to the wiloras mind. Once a victim makes a Will save

against the wiloras gaze, it becomes immune to that particular

wiloras gaze for 24 hours.

Unlike  most  gaze  attacks,  this  gaze  attack  requires  the

wiloras concentration; it cannot target more than one crea-

ture in a round. A wilora can use its memory-snatching ability

only while in its true form. The ability is a mind-affecting

attack.

Alternate Form (Su): A wilora is bound to its true form

during  the  day,  but  after  nightfall  it  gains  the  ability  to

polymorph at will as a move action into any bird or birdlike

magical beast of Large or smaller size (including giant eagles,

giant owls, griffons, hippogriffs, or owlbears). It can remain

in that form until daybreak, if it wishes.

In addition, if a wilora has successfully used its memory-

snatching  gaze  during  the  current  night,  it  can  assume  the

form of the last creature upon which it successfully used its

memory-snatching gaze. This ability works as the polymorph

spell, except as noted above. A wilora can take the form of any

Large or smaller creature allowed by that spell.

Resistant to Enchantment Spells: A wilora has a +4 racial

bonus  on  all  saving  throws  against  enchantment  spells  and

effects.

push or pull their victims deeper into the Cache to make them

sacri ces to Umberlee.

A sea wraith cannot speak, although those who escape its

grip  claim  to  have  heard  an  infernal  moaning  that  nearly

overwhelmed their senses.

Combat

A  sea  wraith  attacks  with  its  chill  touch,  and  it  takes  full

advantage  of  its  dark  environment,  often  attacking  from  a

nonstandard location, such as from directly beneath or above

a  victim,  since  many  targets  are  not  used  to   ghting  in  an

aquatic environment. (As an incorporeal creature, a sea wraith

can move and  ght in water with no penalty.) A sea wraith

always seeks to surround a humanoid foe and destroy it with

its deep chill ability.

Create  Spawn  (Su):

Any  humanoid  reduced

to  0  Strength  by  a  sea

wraith dies and becomes

a  sea  wraith  in  2d4

rounds unless the body is

removed from the water

or a protection from evil

spell  is  cast  upon  the

body before the transfor-

mation occurs. The new

sea  wraith  possesses  no

abilities or memories of

life,  nor  is  it  under  any

command  other  than

to kill those who would

approach  or  touch  the

treasures that it guards.

Surround  (Ex):  As

a  standard  action,  a  sea

wraith  can  attempt  to

surround  a  single  oppo-

nent of its size or smaller.

It does not need to make

a  touch  attack  during

the round in which it at-

tempts to surround its foe.

The sea wraith merely has to move into the opponents space.

Opponents  can  make  attacks  of  opportunity  against  the  sea

wraith, but they are not entitled to a saving throw against being

surrounded if they do so. An opponent that does not attempt

an attack of opportunity must succeed on a DC 16 Re ex save

or be surrounded; on a success, the opponent is moved back or

aside one square as the sea wraith moves forward. A sea wraith

uses its deep chill attack in the round when it surrounds its foe

and at the beginning of its turn on each subsequent round.

A surrounded foe is blinded while it remains in the same

square as the creature, as the sea wraiths misty form prevents

the foe from seeing out of its own square or squares. Creatures

striking at the sea wraith automatically strike the surrounded

creature as well, unless their attack does not affect a corporeal

target. A surrounded foe can attack the sea wraith with any

melee weapon or natural weapon suitable for use in a grapple

(the wraith wraps the victim so closely that larger weapons just

cant be brought to bear), but there is no penalty for attacking

with such a weapon.

A surrounded foe is not grappled or prevented from moving,

but if it moves, the sea wraith automatically moves with it. In

order to free itself, a surrounded foe must move into sunlight

(in which case the wraith releases it immediately and  ees for

darkness  at  the   rst  opportunity)  or  attempt  to  escape  as  a

standard action. The victim makes an Escape Artist check, op-

posed by the sea wraiths touch attack modi er (usually +6).

Deep Chill (Su): A sea wraith that surrounds a victim or

that begins its turn surrounding a victim cloaks its opponent

in  the  chill  of  the

abyssal  depths,  deal-

ing  3d6  points  of

cold damage and 1d4

points  of  Strength

damage per round. A

successful  Fortitude

save reduces the cold

damage  by  half  and

negates the Strength

damage.

Incorporeal Traits:

A  sea  wraith

is

harmed only by other

incorporeal creatures,

magic weapons, spells,

spell-like abilities, and

supernatural abilities.

It has a 50% chance

to ignore any damage

from  a  corporeal

source,  except  for

force  effects  or  at-

tacks made with ghost

touch weapons. It can

pass  through  solid

objects, but not force

effects, at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and

shields, but de ection bonuses and force effects work normally

against it. An incorporeal creature always moves silently and

cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be.

Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex): A sea wraith is utterly power-

less in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and  ees

from it. A sea wraith in natural sunlight immediately releases

an engulfed victim.

Undead  Traits:  A  sea  wraith  is  immune  to  mind-affect-

ing  spells and abilities,  poison, magic sleep  effects,  paralysis,

stunning, disease, death effects, and any effect that requires a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It

is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage

to its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised,

and resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision

out to 60 feet.

Skills: A sea wraith is nigh-invisible in its underwater envi-

ronment and has a +8 racial bonus on Hide checks in aquatic

environments.

HEROES AND MAGIC

Hand of Tyr

You have sacri ced your right hand to Tyr, the Maimed God,

proving your resilience and strength of spirit. Most who take

this  feat  wrap  their  right  hands  in  white  gauze,  voluntarily

refraining from using the hand. Others have lost their hand in

battle, and a few fanatical followers of the Maimed God choose

to cut off their hand to demonstrate their zeal and devotion

to Tyrs faith.

Prerequisites: Patron Tyr, alignment lawful good, ability to

turn undead.

Bene t: As long as you refrain from using your right hand,

you receive a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and

Will saves.

Since you are using only one hand, you cannot  ght with two

weapons, wield a two-handed weapon, or  ght with a one-handed

weapon and a heavy shield. You can  ght with a one-handed

weapon and a light shield, but you cannot use your shield hand

to hold other objects such as a holy symbol, spell components,

or a light source. (This means you must use your weapon hand

to cast spells, so you might have to drop or sheathe a weapon

when you wish to cast a spell requiring your holy symbol or

somatic components.) You take a 4 penalty on Climb, Disable

Device, Open Lock, and Tumble checks. You can only gain the

bene t of wearing one magic ring.

4th  Armor of Darkness: Creates a shroud of shadow around

target that grants darkvision, a bonus to AC, and a bonus

on some saving throws.

5th  Darkbolt: One beam of darkness/2 levels deals damage and

dazes opponents.

Special:  The  armor  of  darkness  and  darkbolt  spells  also

appear on the Darkness domain list. With this feat, you can

cast them as regular cleric spells, not just domain spells.

Jesters Magic

You are a skilled master of magical jests, capable of inciting

audiences to laughter or lulling them to sleep.

Prerequisites: Perform (acting) 8 ranks, ability to cast arcane

spells.

Bene t: Choose either the bardic jester tradition or the jester

mage tradition. You gain +1 caster level when casting a spell

from the list below for your tradition.

The bardic tradition of jesters magic includes the following

bard spells at the appropriate levels: 0prestidigitation; 1st

remove fear, hypnotism, Tashas hideous laughter; 2ndcalm

emotions,  enthrall;  3rdconfusion,  glibness;  4thmodify

memory; 5thmass suggestion; 6thOttos irresistible dance.

(If  you  previously  considered  yourself

right-handed, you suffer no penalty for using

your left hand as your primary hand. Handed-

ness isnt de ned in the game; the point of

the vow is to restrict yourself to using one

hand.)

Special: If you violate your oaths and use

your right hand for any purpose, you lose the

bene ts of this feat until you perform a rite

of puri cation in a shrine or temple of Tyr,

which requires 24 hours of vigil and prayer.

Initiate of Shar

[Initiate]

You have been initiated into the greatest secrets

of Shars church.

Prerequisite: Able to cast 1st-level divine

spells, patron deity Shar.

Bene t: You add Bluff and Hide to your

list of class skills.

In addition, you add the following spells to

your divine spellcaster spell list. If you have

more than one divine spellcasting class before

taking this feat, you must decide which class

has the additional spells added to its list.

1st   Disguise Self: Changes your appearance.

3rd  Crushing  Despair:  Subject  takes  2  on

attack  rolls,  damage  rolls,  saves,  and

checks.

HEROES AND MAGIC

The mage tradition of jesters magic includes the following

sorcerer/wizard spells at the appropriate levels: 0prestidigita-

tion;  1stgrease,  hypnotism;  2ndTashas  hideous  laughter,

rope  trick;  3rddeep  slumber,  suggestion;  4thconfusion;

5thseeming;  6thmass  suggestion;  7thproject  image;

Lunar Magic

Your spells and spell-like abilities are tied to the phase of the

moon, rising and falling with the strength of Selne.

Prerequisite: Patron deity Selne or Mystra, arcane or divine

spellcaster level 1st.

Bene t: As shown in the table below, your effective caster

level for all spells you cast or spell-like abilities you possess is

tied to the phase of the moon.

For purposes of this feat, the new moon and full moon are

considered to last three successive nights (the night before, the night

of, and the night after the true full moon or new moon). Since

Selnes month is almost exactly as long as the calendar month,

the moon is always full right at the beginning of the month, and

dark right in the middle of the month, as shown below.

Veil of Cyric

You have reconciled yourself to the unfortunate truth that hard

decisions and regrettable actions are necessary in the service

of  your  deity.  You  intrinsically  rationalize  any  nongood  act,

believing your actions to be just and pure.

Prerequisite: Any evil alignment, not an outsider, cannot

worship an evil god.

Bene t:  You  do  not  register  as  evil  to  detect  evil  spells,

spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities unless the aura power

(see the detect evil spell, Players Handbook page 218) of the

detector exceeds your own. For example, the aura power of a

paladin  7/blackguard  1  is  moderate,  so  a  good-aligned  cleric

would need to be 9th level to detect his evil nature.

This feat provides no bene t against attempts to smite evil or

spells such as holy smite or holy word. You are evil, you simply

do not register as such to most detect evil attempts.

Magic Items

Many magic items in common use today were once exclusively

associated  with  the  City  of  Splendors.  Common  and  rare

examples  include  the  dagger  of  homing  (usually  a  +1  or  +2

returning dagger), the eye of the druuthbaneMag, Laerals spell

shieldMag,  Laerals  storm  armorMag,  the  thunderstaffPG,  and

the trollkiller sword (usually a +1  aming longsword). Some

uniquely Waterdhavian artifacts have wandered far a eld, such

as AzureedgeMag, Slayer of the Netherborn, and the reformed

Crown of HornsMag. Detailed hereafter are Art-crafted objects

and  properties  still  exclusively  (or  nearly  so)  associated  with

Waterdeep and unique items believed to be found within the

City of Splendors.

Weapon Special Abilities

In addition to the special abilities described on page 223226 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide, the following abilities are relatively

commonplace for weapons made in Waterdeep.

Corrosive: Upon command, a corrosive weapon becomes slick

with a thick layer of acidic  uid (the wielder takes no damage

from this effect). Corrosive weapons deal an extra 1d6 points

of acid damage on a successful hit.

Bows, crossbows, and slings with this ability bestow the acid

energy upon their ammunition.

Moderate conjuration or evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic

Arms and Armor, acid fog, acid storm, Melfs acid arrow, or

storm of vengeance; Price +1 bonus.

Harmonizing:  This  enchantment  can  only  be  placed  on

melee weapons. A harmonizing weapon accompanies its wielder

in song if drawn, granting a +6 enhancement bonus on Perform

checks that involve singing. Beginning on the second round

of singing, the harmonizing weapon begins to sing alongside

the wielder. If the wielder stops singing at any time after the

second round, the weapon continues singing for a number of

rounds equal to the wielders Charisma bonus or until sheathed.

This  extended  singing  is  equivalent  in  effect  to  the  wielder

continuing to sing.

For example, a bard with a 16 Charisma could start sing-

ing for 1 round to inspire courage in his allies. In the second

round, his harmonizing weapon would join in. If the bard

stopped singing in the third round, the harmonizing weapon

would sing for up to 3 additional rounds, continuing to inspire

courage in the bards allies. If the bard restarted his song any

time before the end of the 6th round, the harmonizing weapon

would continue to sing with him, uninterrupted. (Restarting

the song in this manner does not count as another use of

bardic music.) If you start using another form of bardic music

while your harmonizing weapon is maintaining a song, the

weapon stops maintaining the  rst song and begins aiding

the second.

Faint illusion; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, ghost

sound; Price +1 bonus.

Shattermantle:  A  shattermantle  weapon  damages  an

opponents spell resistance. Each time the weapon strikes a foe

with spell resistance, the value of that spell resistance is reduced

by 2 for 1 round. The penalties for multiple hits during the same

round stack. For example, if the wielder succeeds on three attacks

in the same round against the same foe with spell resistance,

that foes spell resistance is reduced by 6 until the beginning of

the wielders next turn. This weapon property does not grant

the bearer the ability to determine how much spell resistance

(if any) a target might have.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Spell Penetration; Price +1 bonus.

Spellstrike: A spellstrike weapon allows the wielder to transfer

some or all of the weapons enhancement bonus as a bonus on

his  saving  throws  against  spells  and  spell-like  abilities.  As  a

free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapons

enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the

weapon, and the effect on saving throws lasts until his next

turn. This bonus stacks with all other bonuses that bene t the

wielders saving throws.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

resistance; Price +1 bonus.

Sundering: A sundering weapon deals an extra 1d6 points

of damage on a successful sunder attempt. This property can

only be added to a slashing or bludgeoning weapon.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic

Arms and Armor, shatter; Price +1 bonus.

Specific Magic

Weapons

Over  the  years,  Waterdhavians  have

crafted a wide range of magic weapons,

many of them for use in battle against

orcs and trolls. The following is a brief

sampling of rare and unique magic weap-

ons found within the City of Splendors.

Axe of Heavenly Fire: This Large +3 holy greataxe sheds

light equivalent to a light spell (bright illumination in a

20-foot radius, shadowy illumination in a 40-foot radius)

and is considered sacred to Tyr. It was given to Madeiron

Sunderstone  (see  page  34)  by  Lord  High  Justiciar  High

Avenger Deren Eriach of the Abbey of the Just Hammer

in Tasseldale.

Moderate evocation; CL 15th; Craft

Magic  Arms  and  Armor,  holy  smite,

creator must be good; Price 50,340 gp;

Cost 25,340 gp + 2,000 XP; Weight

Bow  of  Hosark:  Carved  from  an

unknown  creamy-white  wood  resem-

bling  ivory,  this  unique  weapon  has

been in the possession of Travis Deepdell

for over thirty years, despite the efforts of

Elaith  Craulnober  and  others  to  steal  it.  No

sages have been able to identify the bows origin,

and legend lore spells only produce the beautiful illusion

of an elf maidens face that cryptically asks the bearer

to take care of the Horn of Moons Dawning. Some

rangers and druids who gaze at the bow see a faint carved

outline of a unicorns head along its outer curve, suggesting

the weapon is connected in some way to Mielikki or Lurue.

The bow of Hosark is a beautiful +2 distance mighty composite

longbow (+5 Str bonus). When the bow is held or worn over

the back, it acts as an amulet of proof against detection and

location. Two times per day, the wielder can add the brilliant

energy special ability to any arrow shot from the bow (so long

as the total arrow bonus, including the brilliant energy special

ability, does not exceed +10).

Strong  transmutation;  CL  15th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  clairaudience/clairvoyance,

continual  ame, gaseous form, nondetection; Price 102,900 gp;

Cost 51,900 gp + 4,080 XP; Weight 3 lb.

Ettin Axe of Uruth: This unique +1 icy burst/+1  aming

burst  orc  double  axe  is  imbued  with  two  sentiences,  Ur  and

Krypt, respectively, and can illuminate its surroundings at will

as a torch.

Ur: AL LE; Int 14, Wis 14, Cha 10; speaks Common, Orc,

and Troll; 120-ft. vision and hearing; Ego score 9.

Lesser  Power:  Item  has  10  ranks  in  Sense  Motive  (total

modi er  +12)  and  10  ranks  in  Spellcraft  (total

modi er +12).

Krypt:  AL  CE;  Int  14,  Wis  10,  Cha  14;

speaks  Common,  Orc,  and  Troll;  120-ft.

vision and hearing; Ego score 9.

Lesser Power: Item has 10 ranks in

Intimidate (total modi er +12) and 10

ranks in Bluff (total modi er +12).

Although  one  axe  head  is  lawful

evil and one axe head is chaotic evil,

the weapon is considered neutral evil

for  purposes  of  determining  which

bearers  can  wield  it.  If  the  heads  work

in  concert,  which  is  rare,  the  items  ego  is  considered

equal to 13.

Fashioned by Lethchauntos the Black and and wielded

by King Uruth before his death in the Battle of the West-

wood, this orc double axe is famous for the endless verbal

spats between its twin personalities. Most intelligent items

try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she

ignores or destroys rival items within 60

feet.  This  common  trait  manifests  in

the ettin axe of Uruth in the form of

nigh-constant  attempts  to  denigrate

the other sentience.

Claimed by War Lord Gharl in the

aftermath of the Orcfastings War, but

quickly  interred  and  forgotten  in  the

depths of Nimoars Hold, the ettin axe

of Uruth vanished during the Siege of the

Black Horde, apparently stolen by orc in ltra-

tors. Subsequent divinations performed after the

weapon was stolen revealed only that the double axe

remained within Waterdeep, suggesting that the Black

Horde interlopers had failed to escape with this potent

symbol of orc might. The weapons current location and

recent history remain unknown.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

either chill metal or ice storm, either  ame blade,  ame strike,

or   reball;  Price  64,660  gp;  Cost  32,660  gp  +  2,560  XP;

Weight 15 lb.

Gurts Greataxe: In the Year of the Icy Axe (123 DR), Gurt,

Lord of the Pale Giants, fell to Uthgar Gardolfssonleader

the folk who would become the Uthgardt barbariansin an

epic battle that marked the ascendance of humankind over the

giants in the Dessarin River valley. Gurts greataxe is said to

have been buried in Morgurs Mound until the Second Trollwar,

when it was brought back to Waterdeep by Amphail the Just.

HEROES AND MAGIC

After decades of obscurity, lying forgotten in the citys vaults,

Piergeiron gave the legendary weapon to Harshnag the Grim

in recognition of his service to Waterdeep.

Gurts  greataxe  is  a  Large  +1  human  bane  thundering

greataxe. It sheds light as a torch when the temperature drops

below 0 F. It cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light

be shut off in these conditions. Once per day, the greataxe can

use a chill metal effect upon command.

Moderate  conjuration;  CL  8th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, blindness/deafness, chill metal, summon monster I; Price

22,660 gp; Cost 11,500 gp + 893 XP; Weight 24 lb.

Lance of Burning Black re: Favored by the griffon-riders

of Waterdeep, these otherwise rare +1 corrosive  aming heavy

lances are fashioned from the trunk of a zalantar or blackwood

tree and inscribed with sacred runes of Mystra. (Zalantar has

the properties of darkwood, as detailed in Magic of Faern and

the Dungeon Masters Guide.)

Moderate  evocation;  CL  10th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, acid fog, acid storm, Melfs acid arrow, or storm of

vengeance, and  ame blade,  ame strike, or  reball; Price 18,410

gp; Cost 9,410 gp + 720 XP; Weight 5 lb.

Magebane:  This  intelligent  +2  bastard  sword  is  made  of

an unusual black metal, hilt and blade all one piece. Runes of

green  re twist up and down the blade endlessly, but the blade

does  not  otherwise  glow.  Forged  during  the  Seventh  Age  of

Calimshan as a sword of state for one of the ruling mameluks,

Magebane was employed to hunt down wizards of the qysars

court who survived the fall of the Imperium. Its last owner

was a satrap of Manshaka who died nearly a century ago, and

the blade has been missing ever since. Only Keilier Twistbeard

knows that it lies in the Blue Alley (see page 115), a seeming

reward for anyone who survives the deathtrap.

Magebane: AL NE; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; speaks Auran,

Alzhedo, and Common; telepathy; 120-ft. darkvision and hear-

ing; Ego score 16.

Lesser  Powers:  Detect  magic  at  will,  item  has  10  ranks

in  Knowledge  [arcana]  (total  modi er  +13)  and  Spot  (total

modi er +13).

Special  Purpose:  Defeating  or  slaying  arcane  spellcasters

(including spellcasting monsters and those that use spell-like

abilities).

Dedicated Power: Feeblemind.

Strong  transmutation;  CL  4th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor; Price 102,935 gp; Cost 51,635 gp + 2,052 XP; Weight

6 lb.

Muirals Decapitator: Custom-made by Halaster for Muiral

(see page 28) during his days as the Mad Mages bodyguard, this

+3 adamantine vorpal greatsword is now a Large weapon, as

Muiral had it reforged by a renegade of Clan Melairkyn after

his transformation. Magic items touched or struck by the blade

glow with a pale radiance for 1d4+1 rounds. Muirals decapitator

is still in Muirals possession, and given the power and tempera-

ment of its owner, its probably not going anywhere else soon.

Strong  necromancy  and  transmutation;  CL  18th;  Craft

Magic Arms and Armor, detect magic, circle of death, keen

edge; Price 135,400 gp; Cost 67,900 gp + 5,400 XP; Weight

16 lb.

Quarterstaff  of  Alcedor:  Custom-made  by  Alcedor  Kolat

for his own use, this 7-foot-long +3 spellstrike/+3 shattermantle

Spiked  Gauntlet  of  Ulbaerag:  This  unique  +3  wounding

spiked gauntlet  drips  blood  for  as  long  as  a  victim  wounded

by it continues to bleed. (The victim suffers damage from the

wounding effect normally.)

After serving as the symbol of authority in Bloodhand Hold

for Ulbaerag and his successors, the gauntlet was lost during

Nimoars  sacking  of  the  settlement.  The  Shadow  Thieves

found it centuries later, and the Citadel of the Bloody Hand

(see page 116) is the gauntlets namesake. Ulbaerags gauntlet

was lost again after the Shadow Thieves were banished from

Waterdeep, but the weapon is believed to remain within the

City of Splendors.

Viperfang: Custom-built to the Black Vipers speci cations

+2 corrosive assassins dagger of venom has a curved blade and

serrated edge. It allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the

spell, save DC 14) upon a creature struck by the blade once

per day. The wielder can decide to use the power after he has

struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be

invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes. In addition,

the dagger provides a +1 bonus to the DC of the Fortitude save

forced by the death attack of an assassin.

Rings

Magic  rings  found  in  or  around  Waterdeep  include  the  fol-

lowing.

Ring of Armor: These rings come in three varieties. A ring of

light armor is equivalent to a ring of protection +1 with the light

forti cation armor special ability. A ring of medium armor is

equivalent to a ring of protection +1 with the medium forti ca-

tion armor special ability. A ring of heavy armor is equivalent

to a ring of protection +1 with the heavy forti cation armor

special ability. Other varieties, with larger de ection bonuses,

exist as well.

Staffs

Magic staffs associated with Waterdeep include Morgans staff,

the staff of banishment, and the staff of rejecting.

Morgans Staff: Laeral Arunsun crafted this staff, although

why she calls it Morgans staff in her guise as Irusyl Eraneth

is  unclear.  Fashioned  of  polished  cherry  and  walnut  twined

together into a solid shaft, this +1 thundering/+1 shock quar-

terstaff allows the use of the following spells:

baleful polymorph (1 charge)

chain lightning (1 charge)

Most  such  staves  are  somehow  keyed  to  a  sublevel  of

Undermountain known as Trobriands Graveyard and cannot

be used to send the target anywhere else.

Wondrous Items

As one might expect, Waterdeep is also home to a bewildering

variety of unique or unusual wondrous items.

Amulet of Alcedor: This amulet, consisting of a large sap-

phire carved in the shape of a clenched  st hung on a chain

of platinum links, was crafted by Alcedor Kolat and is always

clasped about his neck. The amulet allows the wearer to cast

hold person (Will save DC 14) at will. Held victims are also

affected by a vampiric touch spell.

Moderate enchantment; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item,

hold person, vampiric touch; Price 318,500 gp; Weight .

Amulet of Fire Breath: This amulet, fashioned in shape of a

miniature gold dragons head, allows the wearer to breathe  re,

as the spell Palarandusks  re breath*, three times per day.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, Palaran-

Amulet of the Watch: This amulet, fashioned in shape of

a  miniature  shield  emblazoned  with  the  crest  of  Waterdeep,

allows the wearer to use whispering wind once per day. Watch

captains use the amulet to summon help from the Watch or

Guard barracks when needed.

Faint evocation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, whispering

Belabrantan Caparison of Warmth: A Belabrantan caparison

of  warmth  is  a  large  ornate  cloth  fashioned  of  red  silk  and

emblazoned with the heraldic device of House Belabranta (a

white  eld with a light blue stream and purple netting).

A Belabrantan caparison of warmth keeps both a steed and

its rider comfortably warm in extreme temperatures as if they

had endure elements cast upon them.

This item takes up space on a griffons body as a robe.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  1st;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  endure

Bit and Bridle of Griffonriding: A bit and bridle of grif-

on Ride checks.

This item takes up space on a griffons body as an amulet,

brooch, medallion, necklace, periapt, or scarab.

Faint conjuration; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, mount;

Gauntlets of Weaponry Arcane: These gauntlets are made

of dragonhide  ligreed with silver thread in the shape of magic

runes. They grant the wearer the ability to cast magic weapon

at will on a single melee weapon. The effect lasts as long as the

weapon is in contact with at least one gauntlet, and the gauntlets

cannot affect more than one weapon at a time.

Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, magic

Griffon Badge of Waterdeep: These amulets, fashioned in

the form of silver cloak clasps inscribed with a griffon rampant

above the arms of Waterdeep, are given to every member of

Waterdeeps griffon cavalry. A griffon badge allows the wearer

to use feather fall, as the spell, once per day. The spell effect

can be triggered as an immediate action (see page 80), even if

it isnt the riders turn.

Faint evocation; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, feather fall;

Price 400 gp; Weight .

Griffon Lancesaddle: This exotic military saddle is custom-

designed for griffon riding. It appears to have six small leather

cylinders,  akin  to  leather  scroll  tubes,  af xed  to  it.  Each  of

the tubes actually contains an extradimensional space capable

of holding a single heavy lance (or other item of similar size

Leomunds secret chest; Price 1,860 gp; Weight 40 lb.

Laerals Anklets: Fashioned and worn by Laeral Arunsun,

these everbrightMag anklets are adorned with tiny padlocks. Their

appearance has led to rumors that Laeral is Khelbens captive,

kept obedient by magic cast on the anklets. This is a rumor

Laeral has never denied, as it has led to some interesting offers

over the years from foes of Khelben who were hoping to gain

her help in defeating him in return for freeing her.

In truth, Laerals anklets surround the wearer with an invis-

ible but tangible  eld of force, granting her a +8 armor bonus

to AC. Both anklets must be worn for the magic to be effective.

In addition, two times per day, the wearer can cast passwall.

Finally, the everbright property means that the anklets never

tarnish, are immune to acid and rusting attacks, and grant the

bearer resistance to acid 5.

This item takes up space on the body as a pair of boots.

Laerals  Robes:  Fashioned  and  worn  by  Laeral  Arunsun,

these  rich  robes  are  adorned  with  scores  of  magical,  eyelike

patterns, visible only when the robes are worn.

Laerals robes act as a robe of eyes, a cloak of resistance +5,

and a Hewards handy haversack.

Lords Amulet: Equivalent to an amulet of proof against

detection and location,  these  light,  gold  medallions  on  silver

chains  are  stamped  with  the  symbol  of  the  particular  Lord

of Waterdeeps deity (so as to appear to be a simple religious

symbol). They also function as keys for a set of portals in and

about Waterdeep created by Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Wondrous Item, non-

Lords Helm: These enchanted helms are worn by the Lords

of Waterdeep only when they appear in public and support their

featureless masks. A Lords helm is equivalent to a ring of mind

shielding, with the additional property that it alters the wearers

voice to a deep, hollow baritone.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound,

nondetection; Price 8,750 gp; Weight .

Lords Rings: A Lords ring acts as a periapt of proof against

poison. It allows the wearer to cast sending (to Piergeiron or

Khelben  Blackstaff  Arunsun  only)  or  teleport  (to  a   xed

location only) at will. In the latter case, the  xed location varies

for each Lord, but it is always considered very familiar.

Lords Robe: The black robes of the Lords disguise body

shape and height within their folds, making all the Lords seem

6  feet  tall  and  of  indeterminate  gender.  Only  a  true  seeing

effect pierces the effect, but even then the voluminous robes

function as a mundane disguise that conceal most details about

the wearer.

Faint illusion; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self;

Price 3,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Mask  of  Lhestyn:  The  mask  of  Lhestyn  is  a  bejeweled

white silk veil worn across the brow and secured by a string of

black pearls. It acts as both a hat of disguise and a medallion

of thoughts.

Fabricated by Shilarn Silmaeril for her daughter, Lhestyn

employed the mask to in ltrate the Shadow Thieves and expose

their activities. Ever since, the mask of Lhestyn has served as a

symbol of Waterdeeps expulsion of the guild, making it both

a beloved symbol of justice for ordinary Waterdhavians and

the focus of the Shadow Thieves anger. The mask vanished

when Lhestyns husband Zelphar died, suggesting the Shadow

Thieves had a part in his murder. However, members of the

exiled guild have continued to search for the mask of Lhestyn,

a fact that either absolves them of his death or suggests that

their plot went awry.

Faint  divination;  CL  5th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  detect

thoughts, disguise self; Price 14,700 gp; Weight .

Spell-Lens: Originally fashioned by the Netherese, spell-lenses

have only recently been recovered from the ruins of the Sargauth

Enclave by explorers of Undermountain. A spell-lens resembles a

small crystal oval with a socket on one end that attaches to the

end of a wand. When used in such a fashion, a spell cast from

a wand acts as if affected by both the Empower Spell feat and

the Enlarge Spell feat, but costs triple the normal number of

charges. If the wand lacks suf cient charges, the spell-lens has

no effect.

Slippers  of  Shadowwalking:  When  worn,  a  pair  of  these

soft black slippers enable the wearer to use shadow walk once

Lords Apparel

No one in Waterdeep will knowingly traffic in the various

items  of  Lords  apparel.  None  are  for  sale,  and  should  a

player character acquire an item of Lords apparel and try

to sell it in Waterdeep, few would consider buying it, expect-

ing that Khelben Blackstaff would deal harshly indeed with

anyone engaged in such trade. (Of course, folk in other cities

might eagerly purchase items of a Lords apparel.) The prices

are given here so that item-crafting characters who wish to

create items with similar properties (or to create fake Lords

apparel, for that matter) can do so.

Minor Artifacts

Many  magic  devices  of  inexplicable  nature  and  great  power

have been recovered from the Undermountain by generations

of adventurers. Some of the more notable are described here.

Horned Ring: Fashioned by Halaster, these iron rings have

pairs  of  tiny  curved  horns  curling  out  and  back  toward  the

wearer. Only eight horned rings are known to exist, and nearly

all are accounted for among Halasters ex-apprentices. Jhesiyra

Kestellharp had one in her possession, but it vanished centuries

ago along with the former Magister.

At  will,  the  wearer  of  a  horned  ring  can  employ  greater

teleport  within  the  con nes  of  Undermountain,  unaffected

by the effects of a Halasters teleport cage. It is not possible to

teleport out of or into Undermountain using a horned ring.

Upon  command,  the  wearer  of  a  horned  ring  can  cloak

himself in an antimagic auraMag.

A  horned  ring  provides  its  wearer  immunity  to  magic

missiles and also functions as a major ring of energy resistance

(electricity).

Strong abjuration and conjuration; CL 18th; Weight .

Master  Ring  of  the  Scaladar:  Fashioned  and  worn  by

Trobriand the Metal Mage, this plain iron ring is capable of

commanding  any  scaladar  created  by  Trobriand  or  someone

instructed in his method of constructing scaladars. If con ict-

ing commands are issued, a master ring of the scaladar always

prevails over a ring of Trobriand.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Weight .

Rod of Lathander: This 2-foot-long tapered rod is fashioned of

gold-plated mithral. One end of the rod  attens and widens

into a half-disc with a serrated edge. Embedded in the

sunrise tip are four rubies, four rose-hued diamonds,

and four  ery-yellow corundums. Removing any of

the jewels causes the gems to crumble into dust and

renders the rod inoperable until the gem is replaced

with a similar stone of at least 5,000 gp value.

The rod of Lathander was fashioned at the Spires of

the Morning in the Year of Lathanders Light (1024 DR),

nearly eight decades before that temple was brought within

the walls of Waterdeep. The paladin Dahaerlin of the Burn-

ing Brand commissioned the rod after the outlying village of

Hespheira, situated in the shadow of Mount Sar, was shifted

into the Plane of Shadow by unknown magic. Dahaerlin and

the Brotherhood of Light spent four months in the Plane of

Shadow before the company returned with over half of the

missing villagers. Members of the company told a wild tale

of battling a powerful shadow dracolich named Umbralax

that dwelt in one of that planes mysterious Darklands.

Dahaerlin apparently won the groups escape at the cost

of his own life, for he never returned.

For over a century, the rod of Lathander occupied a

place of honor above the altar of the Morninglord at the Spires

of the Morning. Then, in the Year of the Shadowkin Return

(1136 DR), the relics unique powers were required again. Reports

trickled back to Waterdeep suggesting that the ruined village of

Hespheira had returned wrapped in a cloying cloud of blackness,

and that shadowy wraithlike creatures were attacking the sur-

rounding region. In response, knights of the Order of the Aster

sallied forth to combat this new menace, bathed in the protective

light of the rod of Lathander. A series of quick battle eld suc-

cesses drew the company deep into the shadowed village, where

Umbralax lay in wait. After a  erce battle in which over half

of the knights lost their lives, Umbralax and the wraiths were

destroyed (although the dracolichs phylactery was never found)

thanks to the protective magic of the rod.

Returned  to  its  place  of  honor,  the rod of Lathander  re-

mained above the altar of the Spire of the Morning until the

Night of Temple Fires, in the Year of the Saddle (1345 DR).

Thieves stole the rod and several other Lathanderite relics as

Waterdeeps oldest temple burned, prompting some to conclude

that the  res had been deliberately set as a distraction. Although

no word of the rods fate has ever come to light in the years

since  its  theft,  reports  persist  of  a  subterranean  sun  in  the

depths of Undermountain, shining from the roof of a large

natural  cavern.  Such  reports  have  prompted  many  followers

of the Morninglord to plumb the depths of Halasters Halls,

but without success.

HEROES AND MAGIC

The rod of Lathander glows with the power of a 9th-level

heightened daylight spell from the minute the sun rises to the

minute the sun sets. If taken to a location where the sun does

not shine (indoors, underground, or on a sunless plane), the rod

adheres to the diurnal cycle of the last place it was in where the

sun regularly rose and set. If taken to another location where a

different sun shines (another plane or world, for example), the

rod automatically adjusts to the new diurnal cycle, including

adjustments for changes in latitude and longitude.

The rod of Lathander has one additional power. For as long

as the rod shines, all creatures within the 60-foot radius of the

daylight spell are protected by a death ward effect.

Strong evocation; CL 17th; Weight 5 lb.

Poison

As with any large city, Waterdeeps populace makes periodic use

of poisons against their enemies. Such means of warfare are

particularly common among merchants and nobles.

Sleep-Smoke:  Used  primarily  by  agents  of  the  Xanathar

Thieves Guild for kidnapping, sleep-smoke is a dark-gray, smoky

gas that rapidly dissipates when released into the air. One dose

affects a globe 10 feet in diameter on the  rst round, expanding

outward to a globe 20 feet in diameter on the second round, and

being harmless thereafter. A strong wind can move the globe

of sleep-smoke.

Type: Inhaled DC 15; Initial damage unconsciousness for 1

minute; Secondary damage unconsciousness for 1d3 minutes;

Price 25 gp; DC to create 15; CR modi er +1.

Spells

Many spells in use today across the Realms were once exclusively

associated with the spellcasters of Waterdeep. Examples include

battering ram, blackstaff, Duhlarks glasstrike, healing touch,

Khelbens  suspended  silence,  and  Laerals  cutting  hand.  (See

Magic  of  Faern  for  details  of  these  spells.)  The  following

spells, presented in alphabetical order, are still exclusively (or

nearly so) associated with the City of Splendors.

BINDING CHAIN OF FATE

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Whirling chain of force

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a chain of force that whirls into a loop around a

single creature of your choice, making a metallic rattling sound

as it does so. The chain creates an oscillating ring surrounding

the target at a distance of 5 feet (so all squares adjacent to the

target creature are within the chain). If the creature succeeds

on its saving throw, the chain fails to encircle it and dissipates

harmlessly. Otherwise, the chain surrounds the target, with the

following effects:

The target creature cannot leave the area de ned by the

chain. Other creatures can enter or leave the area (although

they must succeed on a DC 15 Escape Artist check or a DC 15

Tumble check to slip past the chain). If the target was in midair

( ying, levitating, and so on) when the chain took effect, the

chain suspends the target in midair safely as if it had a solid

 oor on which to stand.

The chain prevents the target from changing form, includ-

ing lycanthropic form changes, vampiric transformations, or

polymorph or similar effects.

The chain acts as a dimensional anchor upon the target.

The chain deals 2d6 points of force damage per round to

the target.

No magic functions within the chain, as if the chain de ned

the area of an antimagic  eld. This means that the target cannot

use any magic, and no magic from outside the chain affects the

creature.

The chain cannot be dispelled, but it is automatically de-

stroyed by disintegrate, Mordenkainens disjunction, or a rod

of cancellation.

Material Component: A tiny silver chain.

ENSULS SOULTHEFT

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Touch

Target: Living, corporeal creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D); see text

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Crackling black radiance surrounds your left hand. While the

spell lasts, you can make touch attacks to steal the lifeforce of

another creature in a manner that heals and renews you, diluting

diseases and poisons, and prolonging your life span.

With a successful melee touch attack, you drain 1d4 points

of  Intelligence  from  the  victim  touched.  This  is  permanent

ability drain. For every point of Intelligence drained, you heal 5

points of damage. Healing in excess of your normal maximum

is retained as temporary hit points that fade after 1 hour. In

addition, you receive an immediate Fortitude save against any

diseases  or  poisons  currently  ravaging  your  body  when  you

drain a foes Intellligence, as long as the disease or poison in

question allowed a Fortitude save in the  rst place. The DC for

this saving throw is the same as the DC of the original effect

that poisoned or infected you, and there is no penalty if you

fail this new saving throw.

If a victim is reduced to 0 Intelligence as a result of this

spell, it dies. A victim slain in this manner is forever dead and

cannot be brought back by raise dead, resurrection, or similar

magic unless used in conjunction with a miracle or wish. When

pear at the end of the spells duration. However, they become

free-willed and outside the control of the caller after the spell

expires.

you slay a victim in this manner, you do not age for a number

of days equal to the number of points of Intelligence drained.

If the victim was a spellcaster, the gain in lifespan is increased

by the sum of the spell levels prepared by or available to the

victim at the time of death. If the victim was a psion, the gain

in lifespan is increased by a number of days equal to the victims

power point reserve.

Ensuls soultheft lasts for 1 round per level, during which

time you can attempt touch attacks as often as once per round.

Some users of this spell arrange for the victim to be restrained

or  otherwise  helpless,  so  that  they  can  be  easily  drained  for

multiple rounds.

Material  Component:  A  drop  of  blood  taken  from  a

vampire.

HALASTERS BLACKSPHERE

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 10-ft.-radius burst and globe

Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Re ex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell creates a burst of black force. The force burst causes

1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 20d6)

and envelops the affected area in a sphere of force with a radius

of 10 feet, trapping creatures within. A successful Re ex save

reduces the damage by half and negates the entrapment effect.

Creatures trapped inside cannot escape except by those methods

that can bypass or destroy a wall of force.

This spell can be used in lieu of wall of force as part of

creating a bead of force.

Material Components: A small piece of charcoal and a small

piece of onyx.

HALASTERS IMAGE SWAP

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: You and touched objects weighing up to 50 lb./level

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: No and Yes (object)

You instantly swap locations with a projected image. You always

arrive exactly where your image previously stood, and you leave a

projected image in your wake. To anyone incapable of discerning

that the projected image is an illusion, the image swap occurs

without visible clue. To anyone capable of discerning that the

projected  image  is  an  illusion,  the  image  swap  is  effectively

identical to a dimension door.

This spell has no effect if you do not have a projected image

in effect. Unlike normal teleport spells, use of Halasters image

swap  does  not  count  as  breaking  ones  line  of  sight  with  a

projected image.

Material Component: A small replica of you (a doll).

HALASTERS LIGHT STEP

Transmutation

Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

As  y, except Halasters light step provides a maximum speed of

30 feet (20 feet if the subject wears medium or heavy armor).

Additionally, the subject cannot ascend or descend vertically

unless  hovering  1  foot  or  less  above  terrain  that  ascends  or

descends at an angle of less than 45 degrees.

The practical impact of this spell is to allow the recipient to

walk along reasonably level terrain without leaving tracks and

to stride across chasms at will. It also adds a +15 circumstance

bonus on Climb checks, a +10 circumstance bonus on Move

Silently checks (which does not stack with the bonus provided by

boots of elvenkind), and negates any chance of falling. When this

spell is used in combination with levitate, the combined effect

is equivalent to a slow-speed  y spell. It provides no additional

bene t if used in combination with  y.

HALASTERS SHAKING HAND

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

As Bigbys interposing hand, except the hand can also grapple

the magic hand created by the following spells: Bigbys clenched

 st, Bigbys crushing hand, Bigbys forceful hand, and Bigbys

grasping hand. The shaking hand gets one grapple attack per

round. Its grapple bonus against another magic hand is your

level + your Intelligence or Charisma modi er (for wizards or

sorcerers, respectively), +9 for the hands Strength score (29),

+4 for being Large.

Once grappled, a magic hand can only escape the shaking

hand by making an opposed grapple check, unless the duration

of the grappled hand exceeds the duration of the shaking hand.

In cases where no Strength score is given, assume the magic

hand has a Strength score of 17 + twice the level of the spell.

Once a grapple is broken, nothing prevents your shaking hand

from attempting another grapple attack.

For  example,  a  wizard  uses  Halasters  shaking  hand  to

grapple  a  sorcerers  Bigbys  forceful  hand,  rolls  a  10  on  a

d20, adds +4 for his own Intelligence score (18), adds +9 for

the  hands  Strength  score  (29),  and  adds  +4  for  the  hands

size  (Large),  for  a  total  of  27.  The  sorcerer  seeks  to  break

the handshake; he rolls a 14 on a d20, adds +4 for his own

Charisma  score  (18),  adds  +8  for  the  hands  Strength  score

(27), and adds +4 for the hands size (Large) for a total of 30.

The handshake (grapple) lasts for at least 1 more round. If,

however, the sorcerer had rolled a 15 or higher, the handshake

would have been broken, at least until the shaking hand suc-

cessfully grappled the forceful hand again.

Halasters Drifting Portals

The mad archmage of Undermountain long ago devised a

number of unique properties for the portals he created in his

terrible dungeon, including the odd drifting portals.

A  drifting  portal  has  its  origin  or  terminus  tied  to  a

general area, not a specific fixed location. The creator of

the portal must specify whether this spell affects the origin

of a portal or the terminus of a portal during the creation

of the device. Such portals drift continuously and randomly

within the radius specified by the portal builder (anything

from 10 to 1,000 feet from the focal point) at a rate of 10

feet per round. To determine the random motion of a drift-

ing  portal,  roll  1d6  three  times  per  minute  to  determine

a portals movement; 12 means up, left, or forward; 34

means  no  change,  no  change,  or  no  change;  56  means

down, right, or backward).

A  portals  creator  can  direct  its  path  through  active

concentration,  which  requires  a  standard  action.  Once  the

creator ceases concentration, the portal resumes its random

drift until concentration is resumed. A portal with the drift-

ing property costs 50% more than it otherwise would.

HALASTERS TELEPORT CAGE

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Close (25 feet +5 ft./2 levels)

Area: One 10-ft. cube per level

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This spell modi es the functioning of all conjuration (telepor-

tation) spells and spell-like abilities, including dimension door,

greater teleport, refuge, teleport, teleportation circle, and word

of recall, into, out of, and within its area.

If cast in an area adjoining or overlapping another teleport

cage, the effects of both spells merge to create a single teleport

cage. Undermountain, the greatest dungeon of Faern, is believed

to have been enclosed within the largest teleport cage in existence

in the Realms by means of this effect.

When cast within a teleport cage, such translocation spells

simply transport all affected creatures and objects to another

random location within the teleport cage. For example, if a

wizard casts teleport within the con nes of Undermountain,

the encompassing teleport cage would cause him to appear at

another random location within the great dungeon.

When a caster outside the area encompassed by a teleport cage

attempts to teleport into it, this spell redirects their destination

to another random location reachable by the spell. For example,

if a 9th-level wizard in Waterdeep attempted to teleport into the

depths of Undermountain, the teleport cage would cause him

to appear at another random location within 900 miles of the

place where he cast the spell.

Material Component: Diamond dust worth 1,000 gp.

JHANIFERS DELIQUESCENCE

Transmutation [Cold, Water]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S

As transmute rock to mud, except it transforms ice to cold water

(about 40 F).

The water remains until a successful dispel magic spell or

spell with the cold descriptor restores its substancebut not

necessarily  its  form.  The  water  will  freeze  again  naturally

depending on local weather conditions and the depth of the

water, normally over the course of several hours or days.

This spell was created by Sylun in her guise as Jhanifer.

JUMPGOUT

Evocation [Fire]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Duration: 2 rounds

Area: 5-ft.-radius pillar of  ame, up to 30 ft. tall

Saving Throw: Re ex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a vertical pillar of roaring  ame. Creatures caught

in the  re take 1d6 points of  re damage per caster level, up

to a maximum of 15d6. On your next turn (the second round

of the spell) the pillar vanishes and reappears up to 60 feet

away from its original location. If you maintain concentration

on the spell on its second round (a standard action), you can

choose the spot where the pillar reappears. Otherwise, the pillar

moves 1d610 feet in a random direction. Creatures caught in

the pillar on the second round take 1d6 points of  re damage

per 2 caster levels (Re ex half). The pillar then dies away in

a swirl of sparks.

KHELBENS DWEOMERDOOM

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 swift action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: 1 creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  counterspell  an  opponents  spell  or  spell-like  ability

before  it  is  even  cast  and  without  knowing  what  spell  you

are countering.

If the target prepares spells, you counterspell the highest

level spell currently prepared, eliminating it from the targets

list of prepared spells for that day. If the target casts spells

spontaneously  (and  does  not  prepare  spells),  you  effectively

reduce by one the number of spells per day of the highest level

spell slot available. If the target has spell-like abilities (and does

not prepare spells or cast spells spontaneously), it loses one use

of the highest-level spell-like ability available. Otherwise, this

spell has no effect.

You must make a successful dispel check (as the spell dispel

magic, but the maximum caster level on your dispel check is +25

instead of +10) to successfully counter or remove your opponents

prepared spell, spell slot, or use of a spell-like ability.

Focus: A crystal lens worth at least 1,000 gp.

You place a curse on the subject. Mystras symbol appears drawn

in silver on each palm (or on the chest and forehead of beings

lacking palms) as a glowing brand equal that sheds light as a

candle. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer

or wizard, takes a 4 penalty on its saving throw.

Any time the target casts a spell, he gains a number of nega-

tive levels equal to the level of the spell being cast. (The spell

he just cast functions normally at the caster level he possessed

before he received the negative levels for casting that spell.) This

effect is cumulative and lasts as long as the crowning touch lasts.

There is no saving throw to avoid gaining the negative levels,

but 24 hours after gaining each negative level, the subject must

make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = crowning touchs spell

save) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative

level is removed.

With each spell use, streaks of silver appear in the hair of the

target, until the transgressors hair is all silver (which happens

when the characters level reaches 1st).

The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can

be removed with a wish spell or a successful break enchantment

spell (caster level check DC 15 + caster level of the crowning

touch). After the curse is lifted, all the effects (except permanent

level loss) go away.

This spell was developed for use only against beings who

misuse the sort of magic Mystra has dominion over. The Lady

of Mysteries does not look kindly on

mages who hurl deadly magic at every

spellcaster who insults them. Mystra

has  been  known  to  shorten  the  ef-

fects on the truly repentant and the

undeserving, if they pray to her for

forgiveness and obtain an atonement

spell.

Focus:  A  prism  worth  at  least

1,000 gp.

XP Cost: 1,000 XP (reduced to 500

XP if cast by a character with Mystras

special  blessing,  such  as  one  of  the

Chosen of Mystra or the Magister).

Palarandusks  re breath is considered a breath weapon. If

you expend the spell on the round you cast it, you only use one

standard action to cast and breathe. If you save the spell for

later, you must use a standard action to breathe  re. If unused,

the gout of  ame dissipates after 1 hour. One nasty side effect

of this spell is terrible heartburn.

STEELSTING

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Area: 5-ft.-radius cylinder, 25 ft. tall

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a brief maelstrom of  ying darts of force that spin,

slice, and rebound within the area. Each creature within the

area is targeted by 1d3+1 melee attacks from these darts (check

for each creature separately). The darts strike with an attack

bonus equal to your caster level + your Intelligence or Charisma

bonus (for wizards or sorcerers, respectively), dealing 2d6 points

of damage per hit.

The name is a misnomer, for the spell creates neither steel

nor a true sting.

TROBRIANDS BALEFUL TELEPORT

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

As teleport, except that you send the targeted creature (and only

that creature) and carried objects to a designated destination.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout

of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more

likely  the  teleportation  works.  Areas  of  strong  physical  or

magical energy might make teleportation more hazardous or

even impossible.

If the destination is very familiar, the target gets no saving

throw bonus. If the destination is studied carefully, the target

gets a +2 saving throw bonus. Likewise, if the destination is

seen casually, viewed once, or false destination, the target

gets a +4, +6, or +8 bonus, respectively.

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell reduces the hardness and hit points of the targeted

object  to  that  of  glass  (hardness  1  and  1  hit  point/inch  of

thickness).  If  the  object  already  has  a  lower  hardness  score,

the spell has no effect. (As always, if the object is attended, its

owner receives a saving throw; unattended nonmagical objects

do not receive saving throws.)

Material Component: A glass needle worth 100 gp.

1) P = Patriarch, M = Matriarch, C = Consort, H = Heir. Any parenthetical familial relation noted is with respect to the patriarch or matriarch.

2) First date marks ascension to Waterdhavian nobility. Additional dates, if any, note prior ascension to nobility within another realm and the name under

which such ascension occurred, if different from the current.

3) These are known holdings. Most families own many more properties than are indicated here.

4) Korras, the previous heir, was replaced by the infant son Dulbrawan II.

5) Lord Huld Belabranta (NE male Tethyrian enchanter 17) maintained a long-standing affair with a courtesan at the House of Purple Silks ($54).

Unbeknownst to him, his amour was really Elinaera (CE succubus fiend of corruptionFF 3), a demon. Her influence transformed this once-smiling, gener-

ous host into a power-hungry, amoral wizard. At last, Huld and Elinaera had a falling out, and the Dark Enchanter banished her, but not before she had

dealt him a mortal wound. As Lord Huld lay dying, a greater doppelganger of the Unseen named Rhelgyn took advantage of the Dark Enchanters plight

and consumed his mind. Rhelgyn (NE corrupted greater doppelganger) now rules House Belabranta in the guise of Lord Huld.

6) The founder of House Cragsmere still lives in Waterdeep, though his presence is unknown even to his descendants. (See Arcane Schools and

Practitioners, City of Splendors: Waterdeeppage 23.)

7) A few members of House Gost have the Snake BloodPGtF feat.

8) Members of House Gralhund include a handful of tieflings who are thought to trace their ancestry back to Gargauth.

9) Since Jynnia has never returned, she has been replaced with a new heir.

10) Lord Hund Hiilgauntlet (LE mummy necromancer 15), grand-uncle of the current lord, survives in his crypt on the Tomb Level (UM L2).

11) The elderly Baelrun died, and his former consort Berlie may or may not be dead. Thus the lordship has passed to his grand-nephew, Chostal.

12) Lord Urtos II (LN afflicted werewolf [augmented Tethyrian human fighter 10]) holds the lordship, but his sons are barred from inheriting the role of

patriarch.

13) The recent mysterious death of Lady Estrip Rosznar forced the Lords of Waterdeep to recognize the claim of her Amnian relatives, despite her long-

standing desire to have them barred from the city.

14) Other known members of this house include Ravithara Silmerhelve, the fourth cousin of Lord Laerlos and unwed mother of Emmeros Silmerhelve. The

father of her baby is the infamous Volothamp Geddarm. Another member of the clan is the mad 60-year-old (as of 1367 DR) Saerista Silmerhelve. There

are no evil Silmerhelves this generation.

15) The unseen guardian of House Silmerhelve is Nymmurh, the Wyrm Who Watches.

16) Lord Arrabas is dead. He chose Dandobar over Thyriellentha as his heir in his waning years. Dandobar picked the overlooked Thyriellentha as his heir

upon assuming the patriarchy.

17) The Lords decided in favor of Jhardnet, the recently returned elder brother of the late Mintos, for the patriarchy. The compromise was that Harkan,

young son of Mintos, was named heir. Mintoss ex-wife retained her status by marrying Lord Ulboth Tchazzam. The rest of the family acquiesced, since

the family fortunes had entered a steep decline that is only now beginning to reverse.

18) Many members of House Sultlue have the Snake BloodPGtF feat.

19) Several members of this house are half-steel dragons (see Appendix, below) or have the DragonfriendDrac feat. The house has close ties to the Harpers

and the Confluence.

20) Lady Larissa and Adiira Thongolir are actively involved in the Confluence.

21) Lady Hulmara Thorp has just reached maturity. Lady Stelar Thorp Nesher is her older first cousin and former regent. Khorom Thorp is Hulmaras

disowned uncle (father of Stelar) and former regent. Hulameros is also former regent.

22) Shauban Zulapir (CE male Tethyrian human rogue 5) is a member of the Deep Delvers.

HALF-DRAGON, STEEL

A half-steel dragon is the product of a union between a

steel dragon (h t t p : / / w w w. w i z a rd s. c o m / d e f a u l t . a s p ? x = d n d /

m m / 2 0 0 4 0 3 2 8 a) and another cre a t u re. Because steel

dragons prefer human form over draconic form, half-s t e e l

dragons are by far the most common kind of half-d r a g o n s

in Faern. A typical half-steel dragon has dark gray hair,

light gray scaled skin, and eyes of two differe nt colors (one

d a rk gray and one silve r ) .

Ha l f -dragons are fully detailed on page 146 in the

Monster Manual.  T he  adjustments  for  half-s t e e l

dragons are as follows.

Special Attacks: A half-steel dragon can breathe a 30-

foot cone of corrosive (acid) gas.

Special Qualities: A half-steel dragon has a +10 racial

bonus on all Fo rtitude saving throws against poison.

pqqqs

STEEL DRAGON DISCIPLE

A steel dragon disciple gains a cone of corrosive

gas as a breath weapon.

pqqqs

IN THE REALMS

Ha l f -steel dragons are most fre qu e ntly encount e red in

large cities and metro p o l i s e s, such as Ne ve rw i nt e r, Si l-

verymoon, Suzail, and Waterdeep. In the City of Splen-

d o r s, most half-steel dragons are members of the Con-

fluence, a mysterious organization that battles the

Unseen in Waterdeeps shadows.
