Throughout  recorded  history,  the  humans  of

Faern  have  feared  the  Scaled  Onesthose

sentient  snake  and  lizard  races  whose  cultures,

magic, weapons, cities, and visible accomplishments rival those

of  humanoids.  Fireside  terror  tales  tell  of  slithering  death,

unblinking eyes, and fangs in the night, and a few even hint

at  the  serpentfolks  fell  plans  to  enslave  all  other  races  and

breed them like cattle. Some people scoff at such darkshadow

talk, but the wisest sages warn that these fears have a solid

foundation. Some few even claim that its too late to be afraid

because  undercover  enslavement  already  exists  in  many  of

Faerns proudest cities.

Merchants  in  Waterdeep  and  the  Silver  Marches  readily

trade  rumors  of  nagas  and  snake-headed  humans  who  rule

southern cities, and of jungles down there aswarm with many-

headed snakes as long as barges. But in Calimshan, the Vilhon

Reach, and more southerly lands, talk of the Scaled Ones is far

more guarded. All across Faern, those who live closer to the

fabled reptilian cultures tend to be far more reticent to speak of

them aloud than those who live farther away.

Although  farmers  and  stay-at-home  crafters  in  most  of

Faerns human-dominated realms know nothing of the Scaled

Ones beyond the tales told in taverns, many far-traveled folk are

convinced that malevolent serpent beings are at work behind the

scenestheyre just not quite sure where or how. Even traders

who frequent the southerly lands are loath to speak directly of

such  creatures  lest  they  draw  undue  attention  to  themselves.

Though  merchants  are  quick  to  warn  inexperienced  servants

and traveling companions about odd-smelling smoke (especially

if it has a green or purple hue), strange piping sounds arising

from cellars and sewers, and wines or sweets tainted with exotic

 avors,  they  usually  reply  to  direct  questions  with  cryptic  re-

marks such as, Crawling evils never sleep.

Serpent  Kingdoms  focuses  primarily  on  the  mysterious,

scaled creator race known as the sarrukhand the three major

races its members bred and modi ed into their present forms

from more primitive ancestors: lizardfolk, nagas, and yuan-ti.

Various other monsters and races native to Toril, including the

asabi, ophidians, pterafolk, tren, and troglodytes, are also exam-

ined in some detail.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION

The Progenitors

Toril has been home to reptilian creatures of both the serpent (leg-

less) and the lizard (limbed) kinds ever since the mists lifted from

the newly formed continents. Sages believe that before the coming

of dragons, much of Faerns dry land was dominated by creatures

that some humans called Thundererslizards ranging from a few

inches in length to the size of the biggest oceangoing ships that

humankind has since constructed. Amid this  ourishing profusion

of reptiles were certain kinds of sentient lizards and snakes that

developed societies, mastered magic, and eventually built empires.

In this ancient time, the lizard people known as the sarrukh

rose  to  become  the  dominant  race  of  Faern.  Through  their

superior intellect and tactical sense, they forged the land empires

known as Isstossef  l, Mhairshaulk, and Okothvast realms

wherein they enslaved, bred, and experimented upon other crea-

tures. The sarrukh dwelt in fortresses, kept thousands of slaves,

and built a culture the like of which has never been seen since.

Eventually, however, the empires of the sarrukh met the inevi-

table fate of all empiresthey slipped into decadence and were

ultimately swept away by foes from within and without.

Today, some thirty-six thousand years later, the sarrukh are

very rare but not quite extinct. The few that are left remain as

aloof from the rest of Toril as their ancestors were at the height

of their power. In fact, most beings in modern-day Faern have

never even heard of them.

INTRODUCTION

The creations of the sarrukh, however, still  ourish in many

parts of Faern. The most notable of these are the yuan-ti, the

nagas,  and  the  lizardfolk,  but  horri c  (and  thankfully  rarer)

reptilian monsters with strange shapes and deadly powers have

been sighted by intrepid adventurers across the continent. Many

of the nagas and yuan-ti experiment on themselves and other

creatures just as the sarrukh did on them, in hopes of granting

themselves and their servitors even greater powers.

The ever-expanding humanoid in uence on Faern has done

little  to  check  the  spread  of  the  Scaled  Ones,  and  even  those

that lack the means and desire for self-improvement persist (and

sometimes  ourish) in remote areas. The Thunderers and other

ancient, primitive kinds of Scaled Ones were hunted nearly to

extinction by dragons, but a few such creatures still survive in

remote jungle areas and on offshore islands.

Though  vast  empires  controlled  by  Scaled  Ones  no  longer

exist on the surface of Faern, sentient serpentfolk and scalykind

are not the rare perils that humans would like to believe they

are, nor are they con ned to tombs and ruins. Through spies and

direct in uence, the covert reach of the Scaled Ones extends to

surprising  placesincluding  the  glittering  hearts  of  Faerns

wealthiest, busiest cities.

The Insidious Threat

Neither the sarrukh nor their most capable creations are stupid.

Though they view humanoids as weak, stinking, ugly, edible cattle,

they also recognize that the Scaleless Ones are swift and intelligent,

breed rapidly, and can rise to nearly any challenge. Indeed, humans

in particular are perhaps the most adaptable of all the races of

Faern, making them dangerous but valuable slave material.

Thus, though most yuan-ti and nagas in Faern today view

humans and their kin as potential food and slaves, they realize that

these creatures also constitute their most dangerous foes. Energetic

and  widespread,  humanoids  are  too  numerous  to  be  confronted

openly, but too useful and powerful to be allowed to  ourish freely.

Indeed,  the  races  spawned  by  the  sarrukh  are  always  seeking  to

expand their in uence among humanoids, usually in subtle ways.

The Ideal

In a perfect serpentfolk-controlled community, humanoids would

eagerly serve as slaves, watching for perils that could endanger their

serpentine masters and acting swiftly on their own initiative to deal

with such threats and warn their masters of danger. Furthermore,

the controlled humanoids would willingly offer themselves as sac-

ri ces to the snake-god Sseth and live only to give pleasure and

contentment  to  their  masters.  In  practice,  however,  Scaled  Ones

know quite well that no such perfect community can exist because

by their very nature slaves are weak and imperfect creatures.

Covert Control

The drive to dominate is characteristic of the Scaled Ones cul-

tures, and this need, more than any other facet of their society,

makes them an insidious threat to humanoids. To the yuan-ti,

direct or indirect control of other beings is the Sacred Way of

Sseththe only proper way to deal with other races; whereas to

nagas, it is both prudent and the most favored style of behavior.

The  yuan-ti  developed  a  special  terminology  to  indicate  the

exact  status  of  Scaleless  Ones  with  whom  they  have  contact.

The tsaa olo are potential slaves (usually human, though this

term can be applied to any Scaleless Oneand sometimes even

to other Scaled Ones, as a term of contempt). The hasssar are

creatures currently being in uenced or conquered, and the sslin

are controlled servitors or slaves.

The Scaled Ones attempts to gain control over a humanoid

culture include a high degree of covert activity. Both nagas and

yuan-ti dwell among humans, subtly in uencing and enslaving

them through magic, drugs, and controlled servitor creatures,

including the altered humans known as tainted ones. Rulers and

other powerful individuals, such as mighty wizards, are usually

the  rst targets in a given culture, since control of such persons

makes domination of the rest of the community simpler.

Most of the time, these techniques are used so subtly as to

be unnoticeable. Indeed, a tired or uninquisitive humanoid visit-

ing a settlement controlled by serpent creatures may not notice

anything out of the ordinary at all. More alert travelers might

experience  a  feeling  of  being  watched  or  notice  an  odd  local

customseemingly  practiced  by  everyoneof  perfuming  the

body with strongly scented oils.

Merchants who become aware of serpent in uence either avoid

the affected places altogether or try to trade with the local citi-

zens for whatever drugs, herbs, and venoms they can obtain. The

serpent creatures controlling the servitor humans may offer the

desired goods eagerly in order to take control of the merchants or

expand their in uence to areas beyond their direct control.

Neither yuan-ti nor nagas are foolish enough to show their

true forms openly in any human settlement they dont control.

Thus, when dwelling in or visiting humanoid-dominated settle-

ments, most sentient serpent creatures remain hiddeneither

behind  walls  in  countryside  compounds  that  they  control  as

absolute  rulers,  or  in  slither-tunnels  built  into  the  walls  of

settlements.  Such  passages  almost  always  link  up  with  other

tunnels and cellars into a large network of underground routes

that  are  dif cult  for  humanoids  to  traverse.  Sewers,  disused

and expanded burial catacombs, and storage cellars under hu-

manoid cities (particularly in the warmer parts of Faern) are

also favored dwelling places for Scaled Ones who are interested

in humans.

The Scaled Ones are patient, ever-present, and ruthless. Their

advance is often very slow and subtle, extending over generations

of humans. Often, they seek to change local beliefs and attitudes

so that service to (and even worship of) yuan-ti or nagas comes

to be seen as right, proper, and even holyregardless of which

human  deities  are  locally  venerated.  Wise  Scaled  Ones  never

rush to act openly. Rather, they patiently await just the right

moment to strike. When they do make their moves, they enact

precisely the best strategy with cold calm to achieve the maxi-

mum possible effect.

The snakeheads, as the yuan-ti are generally known,

are widely feared among humans. In places where

these creatures have been discovered, the residents

are justly fearful, and every ruin, sewer, and shadow is seen as a

potential hiding place for fell serpentfolk who wait to feed on

the unwary. The truth, however, is a little different.

Overview

The yuan-ti are the most powerful, successful, and favored cre-

ations of the sarrukh. Bred to be loyal and capable servants of

their creators, they were trusted to act on their own initiative in

furthering their scaly masters agendas. Among the tasks that

fell to the yuan-ti were the exploration and exploitation of new

territory and the supervision and discipline of lesser servants. To

better manage these widely varying responsibilities, the sarrukh

bred several strains of yuan-ti, each with a physical form suited

for a particular sort of task. To aid in the creation of servitor

races, the sarrukh also developed and mastered a technique that

would permanently alter the shape of any Scaled One.

All yuan-ti are highly intelligent, self-centered, and calculat-

ing.  To  humans,  the  typical  yuan-ti  seems  ruthless,  arrogant,

coldly  calm,  patient,  and  prepared.  Some,  howeverparticu-

larly those who operate alone or with nonscaled servitorscan

become crazed and downright reckless.

Description

Sarrukh-controlled  breeding  and  the  centuries  of  free-willed

mating that followed have established three basic natural forms

for the yuan-ti: the pureblood, the halfblood, and the abomina-

tion. Details of these three kinds of yuan-ti, which make up the

bulk of the race, can be found in the yuan-ti entry on page 262

of in the Monster Manual.

A few other yuan-ti forms also exist, though their numbers

are few.

Purebloods

Yuan-ti  that  can  pass  for  humans  with  suitable  clothing,

cosmetics,  and  magic  are  known  as  purebloods.  These  crea-

tures are usually charged with in ltrating humanoid societies

and  managing  covert  operations  that  require  direct  contact

with humanoids.

Halfbloods

A yuan-ti that possesses such obvious serpentine features as a

fully scaled body, snakes instead of arms, a snake head, a snake

tail, or serpent tails in place of legs is called a halfblood. Half-

bloods form the bulk of a yuan-ti communitys defense.

Abominations

An abomination either resembles a human-sized snake in every

way or has only a single humanlike featuretypically a head

or arms. Indeed, the classic yuan-ti featured in the  reside tales

told  among  humans  is  a  scaled  snake  with  humanlike  arms.

This fearsome creature can invariably speak human languages

and glide along upright so as to reach the height of a human.

Many such stories erroneously claim that these fearsome crea-

tures can shapechange at will into purebloodsoften beautiful

humanlike  females  whose  snake  blood  is  revealed  only  when

they seduce human men or when their bodies are accidentally

revealed. The truth behind such tales, of course, is that spells

can enable any yuan-ti to transform temporarily into human

form.

YUAN-TI

Anathemas

Above and apart from most yuan-ti is the rare anathema, which

resembles a great, human-armed snake with six human heads.

Such a creature possesses formidable powers and is thought to

be a divine incarnation of Sseth, the yuan-ti god.

Almost all anathemas attract their own cults of yuan-ti who

revere and dwell with them. These nascent tribes often outlive

their  founders  to  become  lasting  hasrammass  (great  tribes).

These fell creatures are described fully in the Fiend Folio.

Other Yuan-ti Subraces

The sarrukh also bred and developed a handful of yuan-ti speci -

cally to perform certain specialized tasks. Through the centuries,

these subraces, known as mageslayers and holy guardians, have

bred true (see Chapter 6 for descriptions).

Racial History

Created  by  the  sarrukh  in  the  long-ago  days  of  the  Mhair-

shaulk Empire, the  rst yuan-ti were the results of controlled

breeding experiments that melded early humans with serpents

and  sarrukh.  Altered  and  augmented  by  sarrukh  magic,  they

became the most powerful and successful of the created scaled

racesmore intelligent than the lizardfolk and more loyal and

versatile than the nagas. The sarrukh favored the yuan-ti over

these other creations and entrusted them with the most chal-

lenging tasksthose that required free will.

By and large, the yuan-ti were happy to serve in such capaci-

ties. As the depth and fervor of Sseth worship grew among them

(carefully manipulated by certain sarrukh through generations

of yuan-ti breeding), the yuan-ti increasingly viewed such ser-

vice as right and  ttingthe only proper aim and pursuit of

their kind.

Yet the very growth of intellect, society, and faith among the

yuan-ti  inevitably  weakened  their  obedience  to  their  creators.

At one time, the sarrukh held the power to compel obedience

from individual yuan-ti, regardless of their personal wishes, but

the creators gradually lost that ability as yuan-ti society grew

stronger. The sarrukh still retained their power to alter yuan-ti

bodies  at  will,  however,  and  to  this  day  they  can  still  coerce

individual yuan-ti into service by threatening to use this power

against them.

As their civilization grew, yuan-ti began to covet the powers,

possessions, and in uence of the sarrukh. Though they admired

sarrukh society and embraced its values and worldview (includ-

ing the fact that lesser beings were meant to be slaves to their

betters), they also came to see the sarrukh as lazy, decadent, and

inattentive.  The  yuan-ti  had  always  taken  pride  in  their  own

accomplishments as players in sarrukh society, but increasingly

they saw themselves as more worthy of Sseths favor and rewards

than  their  creators  and  began  to  resent  their  domination  by

lesser beings.

Eventually, the Mhairshaulk Empire had weakened enough

that outside forces (most notably dragons) decided to launch a

concerted attack. These enemy forces crushed many of the sar-

rukhs lizardfolk armies, most of which were led by yuan-ti. This

bloodbath led some yuan-ti to turn against their creators, and the

three great empires of the sarrukh fell one by one. The dumb-

founded sarrukh  ed, hid, sank into hibernation, or  perished.

The  yuan-ti  were  free  at  lastor  rather,  they  were  free

within the con nes of their own customs and thinking. Over

the  centuries  that  followed,  most  yuan-ti  forgot  the  sarrukh

and came to consider themselves the most capable and powerful

beings in all Faern. They felt that their eventual rise to world

domination was inevitable if they went about the task properly.

In  recent  times,  however,  increasing  numbers  of  yuan-ti

have  felt  the  call  of  the  awakened  sarrukh  and  trembled  at

what it might mean. The  rst unsettling revelation was that

the yuan-ti cant resist the call; they are inexorably drawn to

the  sarrukh.  The  second  was  the  discovery  that  the  sarrukh

can still alter yuan-ti bodies at willspeci cally, they can slay

a  yuan-ti  merely  by  changing  her  into  a  creature  that  cant

breathe air. Thus, they can easily coerce one of their former

servants  into  undertaking  any  task,  regardless  of  the  conse-

quences  to  her  life,  social  standing,  and  race.  The  third  and

most devastating revelation was that the yuan-ti still want to

serve the sarrukh on a level far deeper than their conscious

minds. The fawning and genu ecting that most yuan-ti  nd

themselves performing in the presence of their old masters is

far more than save-ones-scales playactingit is the unfailing

devotion of a servant to a master.

Outlook

To the yuan-ti, their race represents the pinnacle of sentient life.

These con dent, arrogant creatures see themselves as the most

capable and cunning beings on Toril. They believe themselves

the rightful masters of all Faern and are convinced that they

can realize their goal of absolute mastery if they proceed deftly

and wisely.

In order of importance, yuan-ti rank themselves  rst, their

intimates and battle-comrades second, their immediate kin third,

their tribe fourth, and their race  fth. Prudence tempers their

innate sense of superiority only slightly, causing them to treat

sarrukh with wary respect, nagas and obviously formidable scaly

creatures (such as dragons and powerful wizards) with guarded

politeness, other serpentine and reptilian beings as useful dupes

or short-term allies, and all other creatures as cattle to be used

as practicality demands.

Some yuan-ti maintain that any creature that de es or dis-

obeys a yuan-ti must be either destroyed or broken to obedience.

However, the goal of the race as a whole is to conquer and enslave

others, not to butcher or eradicate them. All creatures have their

uses, and when the yuan-ti achieve their rightful mastery over all

life, the other races will serve as the slaves they were meant to

be. After all, there is no victory or proud achievement in ruling

9

5/11/04, 11:58:26 AM

YUAN-TI

a land that has been emptied of other life. Sseth teaches that the

yuan-ti are destined to rule allnot slay all.

Older yuan-ti tend to be more interested in the diversity of

the creatures found on Faern than their younger counterparts,

but less tolerant of religious differences and circumstances that

might suggest a change in yuan-ti practices. Younger yuan-ti are

usually disgusted by direct dealings with other racesparticu-

larly when touching is involvedbut more tolerant of proposed

changes in yuan-ti customs than their elders are. Furthermore,

the younger the yuan-ti, the more interest it is likely to exhibit

in different worldviews held by other creatures. Only rarely does

a yuan-ti of any age regard differing worldviews as in any way

correct, but the younger ones  nd them interesting and often

useful in manipulating other races.

Yuan-ti tend to be more fatalistic about death than humans

are. They recognize that all living things die, and that death can

come swiftly despite safeguards and scheming. Finite lifespans,

however, are no excuse for undue haste or abandonment of the

Sacred Way of Sseth. Dying in battle is always honorable, but

a  long  life  is  also  admired,  provided  that  much  has  been  ac-

complished during that time. To say that a yuan-ti has lived an

empty or worthless life is a grave insult.

Self-Improvement

Most yuan-ti consider the variances among the subraces (from

near-human  to  almost  wholly  serpent)  to  be  part  of  Sseths

divine plan. Yuan-ti who embrace this philosophy believe that

each individual should make the most of the particular form he

was given, striving only to improve his magic, his wisdom, and

his own creations (lesser creatures he has bred or augmented).

To meddle with his own body is a sinful act, since it is already

perfect for its purpose.

Other yuan-ti seek to augment or alter themselves directly with

grafts and powerful spells. They view such immediate betterment

as their deitys true plan for their race and view yuan-ti who shun

such practices as lazy, unworthy cattle that deserve to be dominated

and defeated by their wiser and more powerful fellows.

Debates on such matters have raged for centuries and show

no signs of abating, since the opposing views are tied to deep

religious divisions in this essentially devout race. But as the in u-

ence of the yuan-ti widens, so too do their views. Over time, they

have  become  more  and  more  like  the  divided,  self-interested,

in nitely adaptable humans they so despise.

Yuan-ti Society

Yuan-ti call themselves vrael olo (favored ones). This phrase is

usually shortened in daily use to vrael and can be modi ed to

auvrael (friendly or known yuan-ti) and duthrael (unfriendly or

unfamiliar yuan-ti).

Social Hierarchy

In general, the more snakelike features a yuan-ti possesses, the

higher  its  status  in  vrael  olo  society.  Abominations  have  the

highest status, followed by halfbloods, and  nally purebloods.

Mageslayers and holy guardians invariably hold high positions

in yuan-ti society, ranking either above or below abominations

depending on the proximity of temples and the perceived local

threat of magically empowered Scaleless Ones. Within their sub-

races, yuan-ti are ranked by achievements and the demonstrated

favor of Sseth.

Individual yuan-ti can sometimes increase their social status

by acquiring more serpentine features through grafts (see the Ap-

pendix) and other magical means. But such an advance in status

also requires moving to another geographical area, forsaking kin

and tribe, and adopting a new name and a new identity. Such an

altered yuan-ti typically does not gain as much status as a native

member of the desired subrace would have because the duthrael

in the new location invariably regard her as a strangermost

probably a spy for a rival tribe. Coupled with the loss of familial

support and known contacts and sources, this natural mistrust

ensures that most yuan-ti avoid such drastic moves.

Purebloods are the exception to this rule, since they  our-

ish best when hiding in plain view among humans in human

cities. They often move about to follow trade and pursue oppor-

tunities, just as humans do. Thus, they are the least likely to be

closely tied to a tribe and the most likely to seek grafts and other

serpentine augmentations to increase their status. They typically

choose snakelike features that can be hidden from humans under

clothing but quickly revealed in moments of threat or crisis.

Relationships

Even though yuan-ti need not love or even like their mates, they

are capable of forming strong (though never quite trusting) re-

lationships with others of their kind. The usual yuan-ti term of

endearment (which translates into human vocabulary as a fondly

spoken dear or dear one) is tisstess. This address is reserved

for a yuan-tis intimatesother vrael olo to whom she feels es-

pecially close. Her family bloodkin are her ahass, the individuals

she dwells and works with compose her ssrath (lesser tribe), and

the members of her greater tribe are her hasrammass.

Life Cycle

Yuan-ti hatch from eggs in chambers monitored by broodguards.

The  hatchlings  are  always  curious  and  eager  to  explore.  They

seek  food  immediately  and  may  eat  each  other  if  sustenance

is not at hand. Their initial training is provided by the brood-

guards that watch over the hatcheries. Vrael olo are trained in

the use of their powers almost from hatching. When the young

yuan-ti see danger or hear a warning, they turn into Tiny vipers

and slither under the nearest cover.

YUAN-TI

In the prime of their lives, yuan-ti scheme, breed, and work

on  behalf  of  their  tribes.  Breeding  with  the  right  mates

throughout life so as to produce even greater yuan-ti is a holy

act for vrael olo, especially those who believe in the perfection

of their own forms. Two prospective partners coldly measure

one  anothers  abilities  and   tness  for  furthering  the  race,

and if both agree that the match is promising, they usually

mate, even if they personally dislike each other. After mating,

yuan-ti  females  lay  their  eggs  in  brood  chambers,  marking

each clutch with its parentage, then abandon them to the care

of the broodguards.

Many yuan-ti grow lazy when they reach great age, sleeping

or lying in torpor for longer and longer periods rst for days,

then weeks, then seasons at a time, and  nally years upon years.

At last, they fail to wake at all, and their bodies rot and then

mummify where they lie coiled.

Some aging elders grow irritable and bite anyone who awak-

ens or disturbs them. A very few choose to go on a last great

adventure, feebly seeking some thrill guaranteed to slay them.

Most,  however,  seek  to  die  in  peace  and  luxurypreferably

in  walled  country  estates  that  they  have  purchased  or  seized,

waited  upon  by  deferential  human  slaves.  Elderly  yuan-ti  are

respected for their wisdom, and they arent spurned or savaged

by their more vigorous, younger fellows even after sinking into

slumberous dotage.

Organization

The yuan-ti of Faern are divided into seven great tribes (called

houses) and one intertribal, not-so-secret society. The allegiance

of any particular yuan-ti is based primarily on blood ties but can

be modi ed by deliberate choice.

Charismatic  local  leaders  like  to  gather  their  own  ssrath.

Most such lesser tribes consist primarily of outcasts from other

tribes and individuals who are in disfavor with nearby families.

Members of such a group rarely move from one house to an-

other, but they may drop out of contact with their home tribes

to operate independently, and occasionally they join with other

ssrath to form new tribes.

Over  the  centuries,  various  greater  tribes  have  risen  and

fallen.  At  the  present  time,  seven  yuan-ti  houses   ourish  in

Faern, along with a society called the Coiled Cabal. This orga-

nization is quite different in both nature and origin from the

greater tribes, but it functions almost like one of them.

HOUSE ESELEMAS

Members of this house, known as Eselemaa, are known for their

jungle stealth and battle-prowess. Those who hunt regularly pos-

sess the Prehensile Tail feat and are accomplished at wielding and

hurling weapons with their tails. Such hunters always carry extra

weapons with them for this purpose.

YUAN-TI

At  present,  nine  Eselemaa  secretly  rule  Lushpool,  form-

ing the majority of its sixteen satraps. Though the number of

Lushpan satraps has grown from the original seven mentioned

in  the  ballad  called  Seven  Satraps,  these  rulers  still  remain

masked  and  cloistered.  The  satraps  keep  to  their  luxurious,

fortress-style compounds (known as asharlans), issuing written

decrees  through  their  human  servants  (who  are  often  tainted

ones). When they wish to address the populace, they summon

Lushpan citizens to audiences and use spells to speak through

the mouths of chained slave women.

Most other Eselemaa dwell along the shores of the Lapal

Sea and throughout the northeasternmost Mhair Jungles. Their

settlements form an unseen serpent that links the Lapal Sea

with Lushpool via a twisting route that avoids the holdings of

House SeSehen, their sworn enemy, as much as possible.

The enmity between House Eselemas and House SeSehen

stems primarily from rival claims to certain key jungle areas.

More than one Eselemas beast hunt in the jungles has turned

out to be a thinly disguised war party seeking SeSehenand

vice  versa.  House  Eselemas  is  allied  with  the  Jennestas  tribe,

and  the  two  houses  have  often  fought  together  in  the  Black

Jungles  against  House  SeSehen.  The  Coiled  Cabal  also  takes

care  to  remain  on  good  terms  with  the  Eselemaa,  since  the

port  of  Lushpool  provides  ready  access  to  Tharsult,  and

through it to merchant shippers who can easily reach much of

western Faern.

HOUSE EXTAMINOS

House  Extaminos  is  an  offshoot  of  House  SeSehen,  but  the

two tribes have remained close allies. The split occurred when

two  strong  claimants  for  leadership  of  House  SeSehen  could

not agree on who should prevail. Instead of instigating the kind

of bloodbath that so often marks such disputes, the two claim-

ants agreed to draw apart and allow the other SeSehen to rally

around  whichever  leader  they  wished.  The  claimant  who  gar-

nered the most support would gain mastery of House SeSehen,

and the other would lead his followers elsewhere in Faern to

form a new tribe.

The offshoot tribe ventured northeast in a long and dan-

gerous  journey  to  seek  out  new  hunting  grounds,  eventually

settling in the Ankhwood and the Chondalwood. But attacks

from  myriad  foes  weakened  the  tribe  in  both  areas,  and  the

survivors  ultimately  gathered  and  reformed  their  house  in

the  Orsraun  Mountains.  Shortly  thereafter,  members  of  the

nearby human noble House Extaminos of Hlondeth stumbled

on rituals of Varae and began to summon yuan-ti to their aid.

So many human-yuan-ti matings stemmed from this practice

that  yuan-ti  blood  now  dominates  the  combined  clan,  whose

members are called Extaminaar. House Extaminos now rules

Hlondeth, and its members have erected a  ne temple to Varae,

which is called the Cathedral of Emerald Scales. Other Extami-

naar can be found all across Faern, dwelling in hiding beneath

human cities.

Extaminaar act as trade agents for the SeSehen, control-

ling  local  smuggling,  slaving,  and  drug  trading  through  the

thieves  guilds  and  adventuring  bands  that  they  control,  as

well as other human agents. Almost all members of this house

conduct personal experiments on captured creatures, employing

spells,  drugs,  grafts,  and  various  training  processes  to  create

loyal servants and guardians. The elders of the tribe approve

of all such activities so long as such experimentation does not

expose House Extaminos to wider public scrutiny in a particu-

lar human city, and any useful advancements are shared with

the tribe. Thus, should any experiment produce a creature that

could be of signi cant use (such as an aerial steed or a swiftly

breedable soldier), the Extaminaar could quickly assemble nu-

merous specimens to improve the tribes chances of attaining

true greatness.

Many Extaminaar choose to augment themselves with the

Serpent Arms graft, thereby gaining extra appendages of aston-

ishing length (up to 30 feet). They usually keep these arms

coiled around their necks and shoulders underneath their robes

to  impart  an  impression  of  great  size  and  girth.  (For  details

of this body feature, see Yuan-ti Grafts in Chapter 10). Senior

members of House Extaminos usually possess the Graft Yuan-ti

Flesh feat.

HOUSE HSSTAFI

The  Hssta n,  as  members  of  this  house  are  known,  were

plucked  from  the  northwestern  shores  of  the  Lapal  Sea  and

magically  transported  to  the  ruins  of  Ssthartissssun  in  the

Year of Netted Dreams (320 DR). Since then, they have been

part of the ruling nobility of Najara, the Kingdom of Snakes,

where  they  serve  primarily  as  administrators,  merchants,  and

religious leaders.

During  the  reign  of  Terpenzi,  the  Hssta n  civilized

the  ophidian  tribes  and  rebuilt  the  ruined  sarrukh  city  of

Ssthartissssun, along with its main temple complex. After the

fall of Najara, members of this tribe were instrumental in re-

establishing the rule of the nagara (dark naga descendants of

Terpenzi) and discreetly transforming the Kingdom of Snakes

into a major power of the Western Heartlands. House Hssta

also  originated  the  process  by  which  tainted  ones  and  brood-

guards are created, but these techniques have now spread to the

yuan-ti of Hlondeth and the Chultan peninsula as well.

The  Hssta n  see  their  hasrammass  as  the  most  capable

and  practical  of  all.  They  are  not  too  proud  to  work  with

and  even  serve  under  nagas  (or  other  any  creature,  for  that

matter) if doing so will ultimately advance the designs of the

holy  Sseth  and  the  rightful  dominance  of  the  yuan-ti  race.

Other vrael olo, however, see them as unprincipled schemers

who shouldnt be trusted with a single copper coin, let alone

the future of the race.

The Hssta n are known for their cobralike hoods. Snake-

headed  members  of  this  tribe  usually  possess  the  Cobra

Head feat.

YUAN-TI

HOUSE JENNESTAS

Sometimes  derided  by  other  yuan-ti  as  backward  vrael  and

half-witted wild ones, members of this house are allied with

the Eselemas tribe against House SeSehen for control of large

areas of the Black Jungles.

The Jennestaa, as members of House Jennestas are called,

dwell  in  many  small  tunnel-holds  within  the  Black  Jungles.

Strongest in numbers along the River Chun and in the ruins

of Ssyintiasaminass, they hold sway from Dolsel Gap to the

River Lapar and rule openly in the human city of Mhairhetel.

The  City  of  Renegades,  which  welcomes  pirates,  slavers,  and

merchants  on  the  run  from  less-than-honest  dealings  else-

where, serves as a convenient port from which to trade with

the wider world.

The  High  Lord  of  Mhairhetel  is  Istas s  Nsaran,  who

married the  widow  of  Lord Rhaunister. Nsaran,  the  deceased

Rhaunister, and all of the lords and ladies of the ruling Rhaunis-

ter family are actually junior pureblood Jennestaa. Though any

of them can easily pass for human when suitably garbed, every

Mhairheten knows that the Rhaunisters have the blood of the

jungle in their veins and can speak with serpents. Citizens often

whisper with each other about the Rhaunisters. Theyre coming

to get us, neighbors con de, and if you go with them, and they

bite you in their bedchambers, you grow scales and become their

slave, winding up on your belly as a dumb, wriggling snake!

Whatever truth such tales may have, the Rhaunisters rule fairly,

Mhairhetel  remains  wealthy,  and  patrols  of  human-sized  ser-

pents protect the city from jungle beasts and land attacks. Such

Jennestaa patrols can be encountered on the eastern slopes of the

Guth Mountains and at the eastern end of the Dolsel Gap.

The  Jennestas  tribe  is  the  least  interested  of  the  yuan-ti

houses in expanding its in uence into human cities and civi-

lized  lands.  Its  members  view  the  close  contact  that  other

yuan-ti seek with humanity as decadent, deliberate tainting of

the race and direct manipulation of the Scaleless Ones as a weak-

headed  and  wrong  strategy.  They  maintain  that  their  fellow

yuan-ti have strayed from the rightful goal of world dominance

and are thus doomed to inevitable failure.

The  elders  of  House  Jennestas  believe  that  yuan-ti

domination can be achieved only by reversing the process of

civilization in humanoid lands and reclaiming the wilderness.

Their  tactics  involve  extending  the  jungles,  shattering  the

agricultural  base  of  cities,  and  allowing  wild  beasts  to  roam

everywherewith  yuan-ti  as  their  shepherds  and  masters.

The Jennestaa use servitor beasts to break down walls, shat-

ter bridges, and fell trees across roads, and they regularly sow

jungle plants in farm  elds. The Jennestaa refer to such proj-

ects as fanging the edges of what humans and other so-called

civilized cattle claim as their own.

Because of this attitude, only the lowest-ranking purebloods

dwell in Mhairhetel, where the continued presence and rule of

House Jennestas is tolerated by the majority of tribal elders only

as an experiment in long-term human breeding. Other elders,

however, see retaining Mhairhetel as crucial to the survival of

the  tribeafter  all,  if  the  Jennestaa  retreat  entirely  into  the

jungles, House SeSehen can bar them from any contact with

outsiders and slowly destroy them. The elders agree on only one

issuetroublemakers  in  Mhairhetel  must  be  removed  swiftly.

Such  individuals  are  either  devoured  by  senior  Jennestaa  as  a

delicacy,  or  snatched  away  to  Ssyintiasaminass  to  serve  as

subjects for breeding experiments.

The Jennestaa are also interested in capturing jungle beasts

and  rearing  them  in  captivity,  both  for  food  and  as  experi-

mental subjects. Their ancestors once bred and altered apes in

search of a new serpent race, thereby seeding the jungle around

Ssyintiasaminass with many formidable apelike creatures that

exhibited unusual powers. In the same way, the boldest Jennestaa

now experiment on hal ings abducted from Luiren (via a portal

linking the southern Black Jungles to the Southern Lluirwood)

and on humans abducted from surrounding lands.

The Jennestaa are known for their stealth and patience in

battle. Warrior members of this tribe usually possess the Cha-

meleon Hide feat, and most of them can remain motionless for

hours,  observing  their  surroundings  through  slitted  eyes  and

clearly remembering minute details of what theyve seen.

HOUSE SAURINGAR

The  Sauringar  tribe  once  dominated  the  Sanrach  Basin,  but

its members were driven from their ancestral holdings in the

Year of Many Serpents (605 DR), following the alliance of the

local human populace with a powerful Nimbral Lord. Presently,

the tribe maintains a strong presence in the Chultengar and a

small one in the Samarlogh. Its members also control scattered

holdings in northern Chult and northern Calimshan, which are

tended by human cultists of Varae. The Sauringans are also the

secret rulers of the independent city-state of Narubel.

The Sauringans are closely allied with the SeSehen tribe and

the spirit nagas of the Chultengar. In addition, they have been

working indirectly with the Rundeen merchant consortium of

the  Tashalar  for  centuries,  supporting  the  Rundeens  protec-

tion policies through targeted acts of piracy. For decades, the

Sauringans have subtly guided the Rundeen away from selecting

leaders who exhibit the rampant ophiophobia common to most

Tashlutans. This careful strategy has resulted in a newly forged

alliance between the SeSehen tribe and the Rundeen, which has

brought security to the far weaker Sauringans.

Members of the Sauringar tribe are known for their ability

to expand the size of their bodies. Most Sauringans with serpen-

tine torsos possess the Puff Torso feat.

HOUSE SESEHEN

The SeSehen tribe is currently the largest and most powerful in

the Black Jungles. After House Hssta  vanished in the Year of

Netted Dreams (320 DR), the SeSehen seized the fallen tribes

landsand with them control of Ssintheessaree and the Pit of

Vipers. The SeSehen closely allied themselves with Sseth during

13

620_96566_SerpentKingdom3.indd   13

5/11/04, 1:17:34 PM

YUAN-TI

his drive to establish the Serpentes Empire, and they were given

control of the Tashalar Basin as a reward for their efforts.

In the Year of the Fallen Fury (20 DR), a decade after the

disappearance of Sseth, the SeSehen were forced to withdraw

from the Tashalar to their holdings on the northwest shores of

the Lapal Sea. As a result of this defeat, they sank into centuries

of somnolence.

Sseths brief reappearance during the Time of Troubles has

invigorated the SeSehen, prompting them to forge an insidious

alliance with the Rundeen trade consortium of the Tashalar.

The SeSehen exchange exotic spices and poisons for slaves and

a  means  to  transport  their  spies  to  ports  in  the  north.  The

spies, assassins, and thieves of the SeSehen (including members

of House Extaminos) are scattered throughout Faern, where

they work to advance yuan-ti plans for domination of the sur-

face world.

The  SeSehren  count  the  Extaminos  and  Sauringar  tribes

as their closest allies, but they clash frequently with the Coiled

Cabal, since both groups see themselves as the rightful crafters

of  yuan-ti  dominance  in  Faern.  The  SeSehren  openly   ght

the Eselemas and Jennestas tribes even more frequently, since

all three houses claim sections of the Black Jungles.

Members  of  the  SeSehen  tribe  experiment  extensively  on

other creatures of the Black Jungles. Their most successful cre-

ations are the serpentlike ti-khana, and the house is now served

by the predatory ti-khana deinonychuses.

SeSehen are known for their ability to spit venom. Most

of  the  snake-headed  members  of  this  tribe  possess  the  Spit

Venom feat.

HOUSE SSERADESS

The Sseradess once openly ruled the Thindol basin, but the defeat

of their lizardfolk slave-soldiers by troops of the Shoon Impe-

rium in the Year of Hounds (293 DR) forced them to retreat to

their undersea holdings. For some time thereafter, members of

House Sseradess ruled indirectly through agents who in ltrated

the  courts  of  Thindol.  This  strategy  collapsed  in  the  Year  of

Many Serpents (605 DR), when the agents of the Sseradess were

unmasked and forced to concede defeat yet again.

The Sseradess currently dominate the waterways of Thindol

and the subterranean passage known as Labrands Folly. These

holdings  are  isolated  enough  that  the  tribe  counts  no  other

yuan-ti tribe as a true ally or foe.

Ever since they lost control of Thindol, the Sseradess have

been attempting to reassert their in uence over the humans of

that realm, but the wary vigilance of the rampant ophiophobes

who dwell there has made progress dif cult at best. The tribe has

found much greater success in conquering the kuo-toa tribes of

Gathgoolgapool (see Labrands Folly in Chapter 7) and employ-

ing them to rule the watery depths.

The  Sseradess  employ  kuo-toa  as  farmers  of  the  sea  to

harvest  sh, pearls, and certain seaweeds that are valuable to

human  alchemists  and  scent-makers.  These  marine  products

are sold through agents (or used for bribes) in Thindol. Certain

Sseradess are growing impatient with the slow process of achiev-

ing real power there, however, so they are looking to hireand

ultimately  controlsome  outlander  adventurers  who  can  add

muscle to their intrigues ashore.

Members of this tribe are known for their ability to breathe

and swim underwater. Most snake-necked Sseradess possess the

Water Adaptation feat (see Feats in Races of Faern).

THE COILED CABAL

This  secret  society  of  arcane  spellcasters  is  dominated  by  the

Hssta n, but it draws members from all the great houses of the

yuan-ti. Though the vrael olo do not consider it an independent

tribe in its own right, it is often treated like one in intertribal

politics, especially since membership requires that loyalty to the

society take precedence over tribal allegiances. The mark of the

Coiled Cabal is an S-shaped serpent with open-jawed heads at

both ends.

The  Coiled  Cabal  has  power  bases  in  the  Great  Petri ed

Serpent  (Serpent  Hills),  Sskowlynraa  (Forest  of  Wyrms),

Semoravs Tower (Hlondeth), the ruins of Lhesper (Shaar), and

at various ruins and settlements currently under construction

in  the  Black  Jungles.  The  society  is  allied  with  the  Eselemas,

Extaminos, and Hssta  tribes, but it often marches to its own

drum. Members of the Coiled Cabal clash most frequently with

the  SeSehen  tribe  because  both  groups  see  themselves  as  the

rightful leaders in the push for open dominance of Faern.

Cabal  members  work  in  oumkathuss,  small  groups  of  a

dozen or so individuals that independently undertake missions.

In times of open strife, such missions are often handed down

by superiors known as overhoods. At other times, however, each

oumkathuss devises its own missions and submits its plans to an

overhood for approval. An oumkathuss may report to more than

one overhood, but usually no more than three. A Cabal member

who  personally  knows  more  than  three  overhoods  is  likely  to

draw missions with a high likelihood of death in the  eld.

Overhoods in turn report to greater overhoods. The upper

hierarchy of the Cabal is largely hidden and free of formal titles

or rules, but it culminates in a council of seven leaders known

informally as the Hooded Ones and more properly as the Iur-

coil.  These  yuan-ti  direct  the  Cabal  in  accordance  with  their

own mysterious and complex plan. Its speci cs and secrets are

never shared, but thoughtful members who observe Cabal activi-

ties over time often conclude that the Hooded Ones strategies

have much to do with covert domination of certain individual

humans. Many seem designed to subvert local rulers and arcane

spellcasters of all kinds; others are obviously geared to shift the

attitude of all humans against temples and priesthoodsprob-

ably  to  weaken  clerical  in uence  over  the  human  societies

of Faern.

Some  yuan-ti  believe  that  the  Coiled  Cabal  wants  to  shat-

ter  the  power  of  Sseths  clergy,  reducing  his  priests  to  little

more than entertainers who provide comforting rituals for the

14

YUAN-TI

vrael  olo.  Whether  or  not  the  Cabal  is  pursuing  such  a  goal,

and whether that goal is a good or bad one are matters of hot

and  frequent  debate  among  vrael  olo.  Some  yuan-ti  feel  that

Sseths priests have already lost power over the populace, since

increasing numbers of yuan-ti see their personal faith in Sseth

as something that can be separated from obedience to clerics of

the god.

Although the Hooded Ones do seem to have particular ends

in mind, the Cabal is by no means a monolithic organization

that  unerringly  pursues  a  single,  coherent  goal.  Side  intrigues

 ourish, and many seemingly unrelated projects are underway at

any given time. Some Cabal overhoods, for example, direct their

underlings to slay and frustrate members of the Red Wizards of

Thay and the Cult of the Dragon at every opportunity. Others

believe that those same organizations should be aided, strength-

ened, in ltrated, and conquered from within. In this way, they

can become great new Dark Arms with which the yuan-ti can

tame the teeming hordes of humanity.

The Coiled Cabal embraces a variety of behaviors as well as

viewpoints. Some oumkathuss function very much like human

adventuring bands, while others more closely resemble secretive,

tower-cloistered  wizards  conducting  magical  research.  Many

Cabal members pursue small plots to enrich themselves, appar-

ently with the tacit approval of their superiors. An exchange of

threats often determines who holds superior rank when Cabal

members meet, but impostors pretending to hold overhood or

greater overhood rank are rare, thanks to various scrying and

divination spells.

Households

Yuan-ti  live  in  ordered,  hierarchical  groups  known  as  house-

holds, each of which is governed by a strict chain of command.

The  members  of  a  household  are  related  by  either  blood  or

mating. Any yuan-ti who breaks the chain of commandeither

by defying orders or by reporting to a superior other than the

one directly above himis regarded with suspicion and distaste.

Such a transgression is usually accompanied by a formal loss

of status that results in a lower position on the chain of com-

mand. Such a demotion may not occur if senior yuan-ti dispute

with each other over the issue at hand and a majority of their

kin  dont  strongly  side  with  either  one  of  them.  Persistent

breakers of the hierarchy, however, are cast out or even slain

in accidents that everyone in the household knows were not

accidents at all.

Young and ignorant yuan-ti are permitted a few transgres-

sions against authority, but they are sharply reprimanded and

punished by curbs on their behavior for such indiscretions. Heirs,

lovers, and other favored yuan-ti who defy their elders are typi-

cally punished with dangerous missions. Those who return are

entirely forgiven until the next time they defy authority.

For  non-yuan-ti,  breaking  the  chain  of  command  means

death, though its manner depends on the status of the individual.

A slave valued for diligent, long-term service becomes a sacri ce

to  the  gods.  One  in  disfavor  usually  becomes  food  after  being

punished and then slain by other slaves. A captive or a slave of

marginal status is often hunted for sport and casually maimed,

then sent to the stewpots or simply devoured alive.

Most yuan-ti consider it good form to anticipate what orders

an elder plans to issue, and to read small clues of manner, tone

of voice, and attitude so as to react accordingly before an order

is given. But only the most deranged priests of Sseth (and then

only those in the temple hierarchy) expect other yuan-ti to know

whats  expected  of  them  without  being  told,  or  try  to  punish

those who dont manage to read their minds.

Orders are always given politely and quietly. An eye blink, tail

tap, or nod indicates that an order has been heard. If no such

signal is forthcoming after a few moments, the order is repeated

just as politely, but often slightly more loudly, and usually from

closer  range.  Eye  contact  is  established  in  conjunction  with  a

repeated order if possible.

Pointed refusal to acknowledge orders is normally dared only

by elders and yuan-ti who believe themselves of equal or superior

rank to the issuer of the order. A yuan-ti may also be temporar-

ily exempt from authority by virtue of cult membership, orders

from  another,  higher  superior,  or  status  as  the  emissary  of  a

temple or tribe.

ELDERS

Vrael olo households differ in how they treat ailing elders. Such

family members are rarely attacked or slain, primarily because

doing so would establish a precedent for similar mistreatment

of  the  perpetrators  in  their  dotage.  Most  yuan-ti  households

ensure that such elders are properly fed and housed, and oth-

erwise  simply  ignore  themespecially  if  they  have  shown  a

tendency to bite when disturbed. A few entrust them with cer-

tain key family secrets, so as to keep ambitious younger family

members in check. Yuan-ti who need the favor of these failing

elders to access family magic items or speci c wealth tend to

become much more cooperative, resourceful, and respectful than

those who do not. As an added bene t, vrael olo who have cared

properly for an ailing elder can ensure the support of bloodkin

outside the household in future disputes, whether that elder still

lives or not.

Some yuan-ti plan for retirement well in advance, purchas-

ing luxurious walled country estates in which they can live out

their  nal years. When they sense their faculties beginning to

fail, they relinquish their status within the household and take

up residence in their own palatial manors, where they can rule

supreme over deferential human slaves and die slowly and peace-

fully. Elders who refuse to give up their positions to those more

able or who otherwise defy the authority of the ssrath are often

seen as irritants. Rather than slaying them, however, their fami-

lies often buy them out, settling them in comfortable retirement

elsewhere. Families choosing this route usually either purchase

or seize a human dwelling of appropriate luxury.

15

5/11/04, 1:17:47 PM

YUAN-TI

Almost  all  yuan-ti  respect  the  property  and  person  of  a

yuan-ti elder living in retirement, regardless of tribe or politics.

Invading an elders walled compound, stealing his property, or

committing violence against his person or slaves is simply not

done.  Dozens  of  such  palatial  mansions  (particularly  in  the

wilder eastern fringes of Calimshan and the southern backlands

of  the  Tashalar)  house  frightened  human  slaves  who  try  to

ignore  the  withered  corpse  of  a  dead  yuan-ti  master  in  their

midst, or live their lives around the coiled, immobile form of

an elder whos been asleep for decades.

Funereal Customs

Vrael olo funeral rites vary from tribe to tribe, ssrath to ssrath,

and  temple  to  temple.  Some  yuan-ti  burn  or  just  abandon

corpses,  but  many  try  to  glean  scales  or  skins  from  the  dead

before  leaving  the  remains  to  decay  in  the  open  or  burying

them under small stone cairns. A few favor feeding the dead to

certain local monsters, which are thereafter treated as oracles

of a sort because they have swallowed the memories of the

deceased.  Yuan-ti  wishing  to  divine  the  future  simply  observe

the  creatures  behavior  and  interpret  it  according  to  certain

little-known guidelines. The bodies of tribal elders or leaders are

usually treated with more reverence than those of lesser mem-

bers of the tribe, and yuan-ti priests are almost always ritually

burned on the altars of their deities.

The  Extaminos,  Sauringar,  and  SeSehen  tribes  employ

a  ritual  known  as  to  the  egg  return.  First,  they  wash  and

arrange  their  dead  in  as  intact  a  manner  as  possible,  even

sewing  on  or  magically  reattaching  severed  body  parts.  Once

so prepared, corpses are bound in clean linen and shrouded in

windingspieces of cloth that have been tied together into long,

continuous  strips  and  treated  with  resins.  The  end  results  are

oval balls that resemble the eggs from which the dead yuan-ti

once hatched. These eggs are then walled up in secret caves to

mummify. Such caverns are opened only to add more dead, or

for adornment with tribal relics or trophies.

Dwellings

Vrael  olo  can  adapt  to  many  environments.  In  most  cases,

they utilize whatever is readily available in their target area

to build homes.

JUNGLE

Jungle-dwelling yuan-ti often take control of overgrown stone

ruins left behind by other races. If no such option is available,

they construct abodes in trees or tunnels.

Yuan-ti tree homes are usually gigantic trees that stand iso-

lated in swamps. Interior spiral wriggle-tunnels link each tree

with underground passages and perhaps even other trees.

Extensive tunnel systems in the jungle can quickly become

choked by fast-growing roots, and all manner of creatures can

invade them. Thus, retaining control and ensuring free passage

through such tunnels is a constant battle that often costs many

slave lives.

HILLS

Yuan-ti hill homes are natural or arti cial mounds riddled with

dwelling-dens and encircled by concentric walls. In the center

are  the  actual  living  spaces.  Subsequent  rings  enclose  storage

areas,  lookout  and  spellcasting  towers,  livestock,  and   nally  a

maze ring studded with traps through which only two tortu-

ous but safe routes exist. The outermost ring beyond the maze is

where guardian beasts (experimentally altered jungle monsters

of all sorts) roam. These creatures are kept hungry and are thus

eager to attack any non-yuan-tior anyone else theyre ordered

to devour.

OTHER TERRAIN

Most yuan-ti that inhabit the more civilized areas of Faern

prefer to live in subterranean crawl-tunnels or in structures built

of  stone.  In  cold  regions,  such  dwellings  always  extend  below

frost level to where the temperature remains fairly constant. If

volcanic activity or other subterranean sources of warmth are

present, yuan-ti tunnels always encircle such features.

LAIR FEATURES

Yuan-ti prefer the walls of their dwellings to be smooth and free

of certain molds and fungi. Beyond that, they are not especially

pickythey dont mind the presence of vapors, the litter that

accumulates  in  ruins,  or  minor  incursions  by  other  creatures

(such as edible birds and small, furry forest-dwellers).

If possible, narrow crawl-tunnels are built into each yuan-ti

lair to slow or stop large invaders. Sunning ledges and other

warmed places are provided so that vrael olo and other rep-

tilian  inhabitants  can  readily  access  a  comfortable  range  of

temperatures.

Most  yuan-ti  dwellings  contain  at  least  one  ssarramath,

or  prayer-focus  to  Sseth.  Such  a  feature  may  be  as  simple  as

a snake-headed spiral scratched on a wall, or as elaborate as a

life-sized, hand-carved stone snake balancing upright on its tail.

A  statue  of  this  sort  invariably  features  back-and-forth  loops

of coils similar to those of a caduceus. It stands in a smooth,

carved bowl that can be  lled with  ammable, scented oiland

the bodies of sacri ces.

Yuan-ti that build anew or have suf cient resources (time

and slaves) to reshape the ruins they inhabit often create sloping

walls that are fairly smooth and pierced by many slither-holes

linking chamber to chamber. Broken rock and rubble are cleared

away, and foliage that blocks the sun from shining directly on

at least one area of the ruin is cut back. Horizontal tree trunks

or stone pillars are installed in large chambers to serve as rest-

ing  perches  and  high  refuges  against  intruders.  Yuan-ti  who

make use of osssra oils (see Osssra in Chapter 10) usually also

pierce walls, ceilings, and  oors with vent tunnels that allow

the smoke to drift from a burning-chamber into other areas of

a dwelling.

YUAN-TI

DWELLING DECOR

In yuan-ti dwellings, mosaics dominated by sinuous curves are

common, and silken, translucent tapestries are favored by many.

The chambers of the wealthy tend to be dominated by trophies

and slither-rubsdecorative sculptures with sharp edges situated

to allow a chipped or dangling scale to be rubbed off with ease.

Slitherglows are especially popular with yuan-ti of high social

status. These liquid, ever-shifting paintings consist of  at glass

vessels  lled with many-hued oils that swirl when heated from

below by small oil-lamp  ames. A wall-mounted slitherglow may

be painted with a lone serpent eye on one side, which is revealed

at random times by the shifting swirls of oil.

Vrael  olo  often  cut  shallow  pools  into  the   oors  of  their

dwellings, or fashion great bowls with slither-ramps ascending

both their inner and outer surfaces. Such vessels are often  lled

with scented oils that the yuan-ti can glide through or bask in

to banish the stink of human contact, to keep his scales from

drying or becoming brittle, or simply for the sensual pleasure

of  remaining  fully  supple.  Many  yuan-ti  like  to  dream  deep

thoughts for hours whilst thus soaking, sometimes enshrouded

in thick clouds of pungent osssra smoke.

Yuan-ti Characters

Yuan-ti purebloods are suitable as player characters, as are the

yuan-ti  creations  known  as  tainted  ones  and,  in  some  cases,

broodguards. See the Racial Traits Table in the Appendix for

the traits of these three subraces.

Purebloods

Pureblood  travel  throughout  Faern,  in ltrating  human

societies everywhere. Most can easily disguise their snakelike

features to pass for humans. Typically, purebloods serve as spies

and agents, carrying out the plots of higher-ranking yuan-ti.

Some, however, are ambitious enough to make their own plans,

and a few even leave their fellow yuan-ti and embrace human

society completely. Such purebloods can make enjoyable player

characters.

Tainted Ones

and Broodguards

Tainted  ones  are  yuan-ti  servitors  created  from  humans  who

drink a distillation of yuan-ti venom mixed with certain roots

and herbs. The recipe for this mixture is a closely guarded secret

that, despite much energetic spying, hasnt yet spread to every

tribe of the vrael olo.

A  human  who  drinks  the  mixture,  willingly  or  not,  must

make a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw. Success means an imme-

diate lapse into a coma, followed by death 1 hour later. Failure

leaves the imbiber sickened and requires an immediate DC 15

YUAN-TI

Constitution check. Success on this check begins a painful and

permanent change into a tainted one during the next 1d6 days.

Failure  means  a  groggy,  torpid  transformation  into  a  brood-

guard over a period of 1d6+6 days.

Onrushing death from a failed Fortitude save isnt necessarily

an escape from yuan-ti servitude. During the hour in which such

a creature lies comatose, it can be revived with a delay poison or

neutralize  poison  effect.  Yuan-ti  halfbloods  and  abominations

often use their neutralize poison ability to revive a victim so

that they can administer the mixture again, necessitating a new

Fortitude save. They repeat the attempt as often as necessary

until they gain a servitor rather than a human corpse.

Humans can be rescued from either transformation by at

least  two  magical  methods.  Casting  neutralize  poison,  dispel

magic, remove curse, and heal on the victim (in that order)

reverses  the  transformation  in  half  a  day,  but  the  rescued

human permanently loses 1 point of Intelligence in the pro-

cess.  Alternatively,  a  properly  worded  wish,  limited  wish,  or

miracle  spell  can  undo  the  change  instantly  with  no  loss  of

Intelligence. Once the transformation is complete, only a wish

or miracle spell can restore a tainted one or broodguard to its

former human state.

Only humans can be successfully transformed with this mix-

ture. Any other humanoid that drinks it must make the same

DC 16 Fortitude saving throw, but success leaves the imbiber

sickened for 1d4 rounds, and failure results in a coma, followed

by death in 1d4+1 rounds.

BROODGUARDS

Broodguards  begin  their  service  to  the  yuan-ti  as  low-ranked

slaves. Naked and unarmed except for their claws and teeth, they

stand guard in and around the brood chambers. Broodguards eat

and sleep at their posts, never leaving the vicinity of the brood

chambers  except  to  move  eggs  and  hatchlings  under  yuan-ti

supervision when the community is threatened. See the brood-

guards entry in Monsters of Faern for more information.

TAINTED ONES

Though  tainted  ones  serve  primarily  as  spies  and  agents  in

human cities, they are also frequently employed as bodyguards

and  stealthy  strike  forces  by  pureblood  yuan-ti  working  in

human  settlements.  Tainted  ones  who  outlive  their  yuan-ti

masters often become free agents in the shadowy underworlds

of  the  human  cities  where  they  formerly  served.  A  few  even

betray  their  masters,  pitting  the  agents  of  one  yuan-ti  tribe

against another, or arranging for humans to catch and destroy

their vrael olo masters. A few masterless tainted ones make their

livings as slavers, poison dealers, and fences for yuan-ti of many

tribes seeking to do business in a given city. Such businesses are

lucrative, and rumor has it that least one tainted one amassed

suf cient wealth to purchase his own escape back into true hu-

manity by hiring a good-aligned archmage to cast a wish spell

upon him.

Magic of the Yuan-ti

Yuan-ti  are  masters  of  experimentation,  both  magical  and

otherwise.  The  vrael  olo  have  had  centuries  to  reap  the

bene ts  of  sarrukh  sorcery  and  the  research  of  thousands

of inspired nagas and yuan-ti ancestors. Thus, the depth and

variety of arcane spells at their command rival those of the

most magically mighty human cultures. Through their own

research, the yuan-ti have developed subtle variants of many

human-created spells that paralyze creatures or move them

from afar. A few anathemas can also use ability rip and trait

removal (see Chapter 11).

Yuan-ti  are  always  developing  new  spells  and  new  variants

of established dweomers. Thus, an encounter with yuan-ti spell-

casters, especially Coiled Cabal members, presents a situation of

unpredictable danger.

Many spells widely known among yuan-ti are described in

Chapter 11. These include fang trap, razorscales, serpent arrow,

venom bolt, and whirl of fangs.

Deities of the Yuan-ti

At the time the yuan-ti were created, the sarrukh empires were

monotheistic  societies  that  worshiped  the  World  Serpent.  All

other gods were viewed as inferior blasphemies, and the sarrukh

believed that those who worshiped them should be either turned

to the veneration of the Great Scaled One or destroyed.

After the Mhairshaulk Empire fell, many yuan-ti sought

different fragments of the World Serpent to lead them to the

truth,  hoping  to  leave  behind  the  dark  decadence  of  their

former masters. Most of these gods were forgotten long ago,

but the worship of Sseth took root and became the foundation

of modern-day yuan-ti religion. Today, the majority of yuan-ti

worship  Sseth  with  a  strength  and  fervor  that  astonishes

other beings.

Some  yuan-ti,  however,  still  search  for  other  gods  to

followusually  because  their  own  self-importance  demands

that  they  become  the  most  favored  mortal  devotees  of  their

divine patrons, and doing so is easier when there are few other

worshipers with whom to compete. In particular, the worship of

the older gods Merrshaulk, Sssthasiness, and Varae still thrives

in certain areas. Varae is secretly worshiped by many pureblood

yuan-ti who dwell in and under human cities and have come to

prefer the bustle and color of such settings to their own realms.

Merrshaulk is often venerated by outcast or wandering yuan-ti,

particularly those who restlessly travel Faerns wild places and

glory  in  hunting  dangerous  beasts.  Some  such  yuan-ti  believe

that by worshiping Merrshaulk, they are shedding the decadence

of their own culture and bypassing the inevitable failure of

following the ways of Sseth.

Many yuan-ti cults form around anathemas. Some of these

creatures  claim  to  be  awakened  older  gods;  others  proclaim

themselves entirely new deities. At present, this latter category

18

620_96566_SerpentKingdom3.indd   18

5/11/04, 1:18:06 PM

YUAN-TI

includes Belissssrae, Olome, Phelriss, Sssravvan, and Tstranth,

whose  worshipers  have  clashed  openly  with  other  yuan-ti  and

occasionally  raided  human  caravans.  Other  such  pretend-

ers  to  divinity  doubtless  exist  but  have  thus  far  managed  to

remain hidden.

Sseth, the Slitherer Supreme

For most yuan-ti, there is Sseth and only Sseth. The other ser-

pentine deities that some vrael olo have worshiped over the years

have all been either masks worn by Sseth or false faces of the

fell deities venerated by Scaleless Ones. These latter beings seek

always to subvert yuan-ti from the truth of Sseth and lead them

into decadent indolence, loss of power, and ultimate betrayal and

destruction.

Sseth whispers in dreams, speaks directly through his priests,

and on rare occasions even appears to his faithful. More often,

however,  the  Slitherer  Supreme  leaves  signs  in  the  smoke  of

his temples after suitable sacri ces of life have been made on

his altars.

Sseth guides in mysterious ways, leading his faithful toward

ever-greater power and eventual supremacy over the world. The

path to dominance that he reveals, however, is invariably a wind-

ing, veiled, and subtle one rather than the destructive and brutal

route of conquest embraced by humanoids.

THE SACRED WAY OF SSETH

Devout worshipers of Sseth may express the gods creed in dif-

ferent ways, and indeed many fall to arguing over its speci cs. In

general, however, they all believe in the following tenets.

Sseth guards secrets to make his believers strong, imparting

hints and aid to faithful followers subtly and sparingly. Those

who use the gods gifts to achieve power and success are pleasing

to Sseth and worthy of rewards ranging from rebirth after death

to augmentation with increased powers, such as serpentine limbs,

stronger venom, or greater mastery of magic.

All secrets are known to Sseth. He yields them up sparingly

in  return  for  service  he   nds  pleasing,  such  as  achievements

that bene t all vrael olo, sacri ces made in his name or upon

his altars, and obedience to the priests of Sseth and orders from

the god himself.

All  yuan-ti  must  act  in  accordance  with  the  Sacred  Way

of  Sseththat  is,  subtly.  Whenever  possible,  vrael  olo  should

choose manipulation over open confrontation, the whisper over

the fang, and subterfuge over battle spells. Those who follow the

Sacred Way of Sseth know their foes, think ahead, plan forward,

and slither well.

SACRIFICES TO SSETH

The Slitherer Supreme hears all prayers from his yuan-ti fol-

lowers,  but  he  is  likely  to  dispense  actual  aid  only  when  the

sacri ce of life accompanies the request. Any sort of intelligent

creature (that is, one with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher)

is a suitable sacri ce, though some creatures are more pleasing

to the god than others. Sacri ces rank in desirability according

to the list below.

A scaled creature that submits willingly to death in Sseths

name.

Any sort of scaled creature.

A Scaleless One with arcane spellcasting ability or a natural

spell-like power.

A Scaleless One with great personal power or achievements.

Any other sort of Scaleless One.

In any of these categories, a more formidable creature is always

more  pleasing  to  Sseth  than  a  small  and  insigni cant  one.

Thus, an ogre experienced in battle is far more worthy than a

hal ing infant.

Fervor of feeling while conducting a sacri ce is more im-

portant  to  the  Slitherer  Supreme  than  the  total  number  or

frequency of sacri ces offered. Sacri ces are expected whenever

a worshiper needs to atone for straying from the Sacred Way,

but  they  are  entirely  optional  for  worshipers  who  have  been

diligently following the wishes of Sseth, as communicated per-

sonally in dream-visions or by his priests. The manner in which

the ritual is conducted and the attitude of the victim also have

a bearing on the acceptability of the sacri ce.

An ideal sacri cial victim is one that submits willingly to

death for the glory of Sseth. Few Scaleless Ones are truly happy

about dying for Sseth, but yuani-ti and other Scaled Ones often

see some bene t in giving themselves wholly to the god.

Next  most  prized  are  victims  that  participate  willingly  in

preparing themselves for sacri ce. Potential sacri ces are usu-

ally  offered  all  they  desire  of  food,  drink,  treasure,  company,

and favors. Yuan-ti frequently offer aid in slaying a hated rival

or  righting  a  perceived  wrong,  then  slyly  drug  their  intended

victims food or drink so as to render them unable to resist.

In  the  third  rank  of  acceptability  are  creatures  slain  in

Sseths  name  on  an  altar  of  Sseth  by  a  worshiper  employing

either a melee weapon or her own fangs. Sacri cial victims slain

by spells or bound so as to hamper resistance are less desirable.

A trussed, terri ed, struggling victim is the least desirable

sacri ce of all. Offering up such a victim requires little effort,

almost no risk, and not much subtlety, so it is unlikely to impress

the god.

The sacri ce is best performed by either biting away some of

the victims throat or face or biting off an extremity (usually

a  hand).  Either  way,  death  results  from  blood  loss,  not  from

poison or other means. The slayer should slither through the

victims blood while praying aloud to Sseth.

Speci c rewards for sacri ces are given in Chapter 2 of the

Book of Vile Darkness. Alternatively, the supplicant may receive

cryptic replies to speci c questions, either as hissed words in the

mind or as visions. Other options for rewards include healing

(whole or partial restoration of lost hit points) while in contact

with the sacri cial altar, ready-to-cast spells (placed directly in

the recipients mind), or spontaneous, on-the-spot alterations of

YUAN-TI

form (purebloods into halfbloods, or serpentine features akin to

the grafts detailed in Chapter 10).

THE ANSWERED PRAYERS OF SSETH

Almost all priests of Sseth are serpent-headed halfbloods, but

the most powerful are often multiple-headed yuan-ti. Sseth ac-

cepts, ordains, and ranks his priests in dream-visions. No yuan-ti

can declare himself a priest of Sseth or remain one without the

agreement of the Slitherer Supreme. If any yuan-ti counterfeits

priestly status in any place sacred to Sseth, the god is instantly

aware of it and may inform any true priests on that consecrated

ground via visions, telepathy, or other remote communication.

The clergy of Sseth tend and clean the gods sacred places

and  prevent  de lements  and  intrusions  of  nonbelievers  other

than sacri ces. His priests also breed, rear, feed, and train the

snakes that serve as temple messengers and errand runners, and

they manage and dispense all temple caches of poisons, osssra

oils,  and  monetary  and  magical  treasures.  Furthermore,  they

are charged with communicating the will of Sseth to all yuan-ti

within their reach and with giving holy orders in times of tribal

strife or war with Scaleless Ones. In addition, they continually

monitor yuan-ti society for signs of disloyalty to Sseth and perils

to all vrael olo.

THE DEEP TRUTH

For at least an age, Sseth has been growing more lethargic, often

sleeping for centuries at a time but continuing to grant spells

to his priests in his dreaming. In the Time of Troubles, Sseth

appeared over the black Jungles as a giant, winged, magic-using

snake and exhorted his priests to gather their strength. Shortly

thereafter, while asleep in his lair, Sseth was magically bound

into a deeper captivity by the deity Set, working through min-

ions such as the Okothian sarrukh.

Set  became  Sseth,  assuming  his  portfolio  and  all  of  the

aspects hed already subsumed, including Varae and Merrshaulk.

He usurped Sseths place as lord of the yuan-ti and the source of

their divine magic. To mark his assumption of Sseths portfolios,

Set created the creatures known as wereserpents (see Chapter 6).

All yuan-ti now receive divine spells from Set, even though they

believe theyre receiving them from Sseth or some other vrael

olo deity.

The majority of yuan-ti still believe that Varae, Merrshaulk,

Sssthasiness, Set, and Sseth are all separate entities, and that

Sseth  reigns  supreme.  Most  either  know  nothing  about  the

strife of Set and Sseth (see the Racial History of the sarrukh

in Chapter 5), or dont want to know anything about it. Those

who dare to speak directly about the matter insist that Sseth

is  troubled  by  disloyalty  among  the  vrael  olo,  and  it  must  be

rooted out. Beyond that, they leave divine matters to Sseth and

concentrate on and obeying the priests of Sseth and living their

lives in accordance with the Sacred Way. They fervently believe

that if enough yuan-ti focused on those tasks, the troubles would

end and all vrael olo would rise to their rightful triumph.

In  truth,  Sseth  is  slumbering   tfully,  and  portions  of  his

nightmares have been visited upon his followers since the Time

of Troubles. These disturbing and increasingly frequent dreams

have  convinced  most  yuan-ti  and  non-Okothian  sarrukh  that

Sseth  is  angered  or  upset.  Many  of  them  have  performed  re-

peated divinations to discover whats happening. Through their

efforts,  they  have  learned  that  Sseth  is  distressed  and  desires

them to do something, though what that might be is not clear.

This knowledge has prompted a few yuan-ti to undertake quests

of widely varying sorts, and vrael olo priests to order an even

greater variety of strange practices.

A  very  few  of  Sseths  followers  are  aware  that  the  god  is

in  some  way  losing  a  battle  with  another  deity,  and  that  the

Okothian sarrukh are somehow to blame. Those privy to this

knowledge are keeping quiet about it for now in hopes of learn-

ing more about the threat and what they can do about it before

they spread the word among the tribes. The Okothian sarrukh

know  exactly  what  Set  did,  but  they  have  intentionally  been

misleading the yuan-ti and sowing discord among them to delay

vrael olo investigations and prevent any agreement about what

to do.

At  present,  the  yuan-ti  who  pray  to  Sseth  receive  spells

from Set, whose domains are Air, Darkness, Evil, Hatred, Law,

Magic, and Scalykind. The real Sseths domains are Air, Animal,

Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, Magic, Planning, Scalykind, and Trick-

ery. If Sseth is ever freed, his worshipers will have access to his

domains but not those of Set.

Relations with

Other Races

The yuan-ti regard most other races as inferior, but their precise

attitude varies according to the degree of serpent nature each

race possesses.

Sarrukh

The  yuan-ti  recognize  that  the  now-rare  sarrukh  have  power

over their race by the will of Sseth himself. After all, the divine

Sseth  made  the  sarrukh  his  personal  emissaries  and  servants

many eons ago, naming them the Claws of Sseth and granting

them the ability to create other serpent races. Not only did the

sarrukh create the yuan-ti, but they also have the ability to alter

yuan-ti bodies at will. Thus, the vrael olo typically obey, fear,

and even fawn over any sarrukh they encounter.

On the other hand, the yuan-ti also remember the sarrukh

as lazy and decadent beingsindeed, a few of them were even

found unworthy of Sseths favor in the past. Thus, a constant

watch must be kept upon them, so that worthy yuan-ti cannot

lose Sseths favor or endanger their fellows by following foolish

or overly sel sh sarrukh commands.

20

YUAN-TI

Other Reptiles

To a yuan-ti, witless reptiles are kin of a sort, though they are

obviously lesser creatures that must be made to see their right-

ful  places  as  inferiors.  Thus,  the  yuan-ti  are  free  to  exploit,

tame,  enslave,  and  use  such  creatures  as  desired.  Dragonkin,

pterafolk, and the like are a measure better, but they are still

regarded as inferiors rather than allies.

Most yuan-ti respect dragons for their great powers and lon-

gevity and nagas for the fell magic they control. Shapechangers

that have access to reptilian wereforms are obviously touched

by Sseth; thus they are viewed as mysterious and holy creatures

that have a rightful purpose, even though they are inferior to

yuan-ti. Lizardfolk are stupid but physically powerful and there-

fore useful as allies and servants.

Scaleless Ones

Like the sarrukh that created them, yuan-ti loathe all nonscaled

species,  regarding  them  as  inferior  beings.  Humanoids  com-

pletely  unscaled  bodies  are  unsettling  to  the  yuan-tiindeed,

some  abominations  regard  human  bodies  as  obscene  and  the

humanlike  pureblood  yuan-ti  as  little  better.  Furthermore,

humans  in  particular  have  an  odor  that  is  offensive  to  the

yuan-tihence the custom of applying heavy perfume to the

skin in areas controlled by the serpentfolk.

Yuan-ti regard humanoid attitudes as base and strange, and

their  overly  excited  mannerisms  grate  on  the  yuan-ti  nerves.

Humans  and  their  ilk  are  always  busy,  and  most  are  com-

pletely  untrustworthy.  The  most  prudent  tactic  is  to  control

them  through  drugs  or  coercionor,  more  simply,  eliminate

those that serve no useful purpose.

However,  many  yuan-ti  who  dwell  among  humans  for  ex-

tended periods of time grow to regard them as fascinating and

often surprising beasts that can provide endless entertainment.

Some yuan-ti even come to admire certain humans and enjoy

particular human customs, viands, fashions, and games.

Yuan-ti Equipment

Since  the  yuan-ti  consider  themselves  the  most  perfect  of  all

beings,  they  use  only  the  best  equipment  availabletypically

of  at  least  masterwork  quality.  After  all,  the   nest  creatures

deserve the  nest tools.

Yuan-ti Encounters

Player characters can encounter a yuan-ti warband on a jungle

trail, or en route to a major yuan-ti temple with sacri ces in

tow. Such a band usually consists of 1d12+1 purebloods, 1d4+1

halfbloods, and 1d3+1 abominations. Small gangs of purebloods

undertaking a mission in a human city often consist of as few

as 1d3+1 yuan-ti.

Ready-to-Use

Villains and Allies

In  any  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign,  adventurers  worthy  of

their  reputations  must  inevitably  come  to  grips  with  yuan-ti.

The two pureblood opponents detailed below might be encoun-

tered skulking in the sewers or cellars of a human city. More

formidable sample villains appear in Chapter 8.

MRUTHLISSK

Mruthlissk was the offspring of yuan-ti whod been forced to

take part in breeding experiments. His parents  ed with the rest

of their ssrath when strife erupted within their tribe (just which

tribe, Mruthlissk never knew). For generations, the ssrath moved

north, slithering from jungles to forests and moving on when-

ever they encountered other yuan-ti. Mruthlissk was hatched in

the eastern fringes of the High Forest, where strange monsters

were many. The casualties among his scaly kin rose precipitously,

and he was soon orphaned.

The  rest  of  his  ssrath  scattered  shortly  thereafter,  leaving

Mruthlissk  on  his  own.  For  years  he  lived  wild,  hunting  the

fringes of the forest for food, until he reached a section of its

western   ank  that  was  not  far  north  of  Secomber.  There  he

began to track lone prospectors, small bands of foresters, and

other humans who frequented the forest. Night after night, he

lay  still  on  the  forest   oor  beyond  the   relight  of  encamped

humans, listening to their talk of wealth, cut-and-thrust trade,

and life in human cities. When his targets fell asleep, he pounced

upon them and slew them, taking their goods for his own. But

the conversations he heard stuck with him, preying on his mind

until he began to crave the chance to taste life in the world of

humans for himself.

The threat of an early, cold winter  nally drove Mruthlissk

to hunt beyond the forest along the trade roads. There, he fol-

lowed several bands of folk who were hurrying to Silverymoon

ere snowdeep. It became his habit to don the clothes of his

earlier victims and fall in with small groups of travelers, sizing

them  up  as  prey.  One  night,  the  cold  drove  him  to  seek   re-

warmth  with  a  group  consisting  of  a  few  armored  men  and

many women bundled up and shivering in heavy furs and hide

cloaks. A few moments of conversation revealed that the group

was actually a troupe of dancers bound for Silverymoon, and

two of their men had already been lost to wolves on the jour-

ney. Mruthlissk offered himself as a replacement and spent that

winter in Silverymoon, learning on the job.

When  spring  came,  Mruthlissk  accompanied  the  troupe

south to Waterdeep, then promptly vanished, heading for the

warmer coastal cities of Amn. From there, he began to tour the

human settlements of Faern in disguise, seeking a place where

he  could  make  his  fortune  and  settle  down.  Mruthlissk  loves

dancing and views it as a perfect cover, since entertainers can

enter human cities at will. But he dreams of becoming a respect-

able merchant in the right porta pillar of the community who

21

620_96566_SerpentKingdom3.indd   21

5/11/04, 1:20:19 PM

YUAN-TI

can host minstrels and dancers at feasts by day while running

a rich smuggling and slaving operation from his own harbor-

connected cellars by night. Such an arrangement would allow

him to hunt and slay trade rivals as well as traitors in his own

shady organization, thus ridding himself of annoyances while

satisfying his own bloodlust.

To  make  this  dream  real,  Mruthlissk  needs  money,  trade

contacts, and that right port. Thus, he has taken up adventur-

inga lifestyle that he very much enjoys.

Mruthlissk  may  be  encountered  alone  or  in  the  company

of 1d6 human rogues, thugs, or dancers. If his companions are

dancers,  then  he  is  temporarily  performing  as  part  of  their

group to earn food, shelter, and a few coins while subtly making

his own contacts within the area. Rogues or thugs who travel

with him are local shady talent with whom hes negotiating

or perhaps even disputing. When local criminals want certain

individuals to disappear, Mruthlissk often purchases them, drugs

them to make them biddable, and then resells them elsewhere

as slaves. If he has such a captive with him, he often claims the

person is a sick relative or village elder whom he is escorting to

a particular temple to die. Mruthlissk also sells information hes

gained elsewhere, sometimes using a peculiarly-knotted thong as

a memory aid to record numbers and individual letters of script

that spell out names.

Description:  Mruthlissk  looks  like  a  typical  young  human

male with brown hair and dark, riveting eyes. His slender, supple

body seems appropriate for a dancer, and his  ne-featured face

leads some people to think he must have elf blood in his ances-

try. He takes clips his  ngernails regularly, since they grow quite

rapidly. His tongue is long and forked, so he takes care never to

show it. Mruthlissk cosmetically disguises the scales on his lower

back to look like burn-scarred, not-wholly-healed skin. Bandages

artistically decorated with disgusting, oozing liquid keep most

folk from wiping the disguise aside and discovering the truth.

He usually wears his companion Sriss wound around his body,

under his clothing.

TATHTLASSS

Born and reared in the cellars of a major port by yuan-ti sla-

vers, Tathtlasss has dwelt in cities all her life, hiding among

humans. She earned her coins initially by stealing and later by

slaying.  Tathtlasss  loves  to  killhumans  in  particularand

since she learned that some humans would pay to have others

slain, shes lived quite well. The secret of her success is two-

foldknow thy victim before striking, and know thy employer.

Well aware that employers sometimes try to silence assassins

after  their  work  is  done,  Tathtlasss  always  arranges  a  safe

method  of  payment  (preferably  in  advance)  and  a  means  of

escape from the area.

Tathtlasss lives in a world of hiding-places, traps, and ready

disguises,  and  she  trusts  no  onea  policy  that  has  prolonged

her life more than once. No matter where she is in a city, shes

never far from a place where she can hideeven if its a shielded

corner of someone elses roof. She equips all of her hiding places

with food, weapons, clothes, and disguise aids, such as masks and

22

620_96566_SerpentKingdom3.indd   22

5/11/04, 1:20:27 PM

YUAN-TI

cosmetics, to ensure that she can survive for days and slip out

unnoticed when the time is right.

When  the  market  for  murder  is  slow,  Tathtlasss  is  happy

to make money by means other than killing. Under the name

Tatha,  she  operates  a  makeup,  tattooing,  and  bodypainting

service in a storefront in the wealthy part of town. She special-

izes in superb facial makeup and swirling, ornamental body paint

designed to distract viewers from body plumpness when skin-re-

vealing gowns are worn. This lucrative business also allows her

to peddle scents, drugs, and poisons on the side to a clientele of

wealthy but jaded women while learning about the important

people of the city. Between her two professions, shes amassed

quite a lot of wealth, which shes invested in properties in many

other cities.

Tathtlasss  has  lingered  longer  than  usual  in  her  current

city primarily because it offers her a steady supply of arriving

outlanders. Thus, when she is between jobs, she can indulge

her love of slaying by ambushing lone strangers no one will

ever miss.

Another  reason  she  stays  is  the  presence  of  an  old,  local

wizard who is gradually sinking into his dotage. He mutters his

days away over books of magic, shut away in his golem-guarded

tower, never noticing that a lithe thief (who can become a ser-

pent when she wants to hide) has found a way over the rooftops

into his loftier windows, and thence into his trophy rooms. In

these littered, seldom-visited chambers lie many relics of mon-

sters that can be discreetly harvested for sale as arcane material

components.  Furthermore,  a  pearly  white  ioun  stone  and  a

crystal ball with detect thoughts are hidden in a little box on an

upper shelf. Tathtlasss has not yet taken these items away with

her, preferring to sneak in and use them whenever she wishes.

No  less  than  three  closets  in  this  warren  of  cluttered  rooms

offer her the option of locking herself away to use these items,

and one has bolts on the inside of the door that she keeps oiled

to ensure silent operation.

Tathtlasss has no interest in making enemies of adventurers

who might mount a determined campaign to hunt her down.

If  at  all  possible,  she  poses  as  a  human  victim  of  thieves,

kidnappers, or slavers should she unexpectedly encounter PCs.

Pretending to be bewildered about how she got into the sewer,

cellar,  or  dungeon  labyrinth  where  they  found  her,  she  acts

frightened but eager to get out.

If  PCs  do  rescue  her,  she  offers  them  free  bodypainting

and tattooing at her shop and treats them well if they accept.

Therafter, however, she uses the wizards crystal ball to keep a

close watch on their activities, since adventurers have a habit of

turning up wealth and items of interest to a thief. Rather than

stealing directly from them, however, she tries to ensure that

the  city  authorities  take  them  into  custody  for  some  real  or

suspected  crime.  Then,  while  theyre  occupied  with  explaining

themselves, she swoops down on their loot.

( lightning bolt), 28 gp.

Description:  Tathtlasss  looks  like  a  lithe,  slender  human

female. Her smooth, dusky skin is a perfect counterpoint for

her black hair and dark eyes. The only hints of her serpentine

nature are her forked tongue, pointed teeth, and a few scales

along the nape of her neck and spine. Though her long hair

usually  covers  these  scales,  she  further  conceals  them  with  a

henna-dye  tattoo  of  ornate  scales  edged  in  many  monster

heads.  She  reapplies  the  design  every  few  months  using  her

professional skills and a set of angled mirrors. Should anyone

notice and remark on the design, Tathtlasss passes it off as a

slave  brand  burned  into  her   esh  years  ago  by  a  cruel  slaver

who kidnapped her. Fortunately, she claims, her kin hunted him

down and slew him before his caravan could reach the rich slave

markets he was heading for.

The  Scaleless  Ones  generally  regard  naga  with  a

mixture of dread and awe. Some humanoids are

drawn to serve and worship these serpentine mas-

ters of the Art, while others wisely fear the insidious, slithering

threat they pose.

Overview

All nagas are seen as potentially dangerous and regarded with

suspicion  throughout  Faern,  whether  their  inherent  nature

is  bene cent,  neutral,  or  malign.  The  truth  is  more  complex

and nuanced.

The Mhairshaulkan sarrukh created nagas to serve as loyal

guardians, researchers into the arcane arts, and agents of explo-

ration. Over time, the original nagas fragmented into myriad

subraces, each with its own abilities. Now, millennia after the

sarrukh dispatched their creations to the far corners of Faern,

nagas can be found almost everywhere, although most still dis-

like cold climes. Although they continue to follow their ancient

drives, the decline of the sarrukh has enabled them to do so in

service to their own ends rather than those of their creators.

Nagas are natural, potent spellcasters born with an inherent

understanding of the Art. Regardless of their nature and loyal-

ties, all nagas are crafty, cunning, and charismatic enough to

dominate lesser races through force of personality alone. Most

are naturally curious, loyal to a fault, and unusually skilled at

deductive reasoning. Beyond these basic traits, their attitudes and

goals differ by subrace as well as by individual.

Dark nagasMM prefer to plot and scheme, forming calculated

alliances  with  other  evil  creatures  so  as  to  gather  prey  and

wealth more ef ciently. The serenely wise guardian nagasMM con-

cern themselves primarily with preserving beauty and goodness.

Iridescent  nagasSK  are  itinerant  wanderers,  constantly  seeking

new discoveries and hidden beauty in the world. Spirit nagasMM,

on the other hand, see only evil and ugliness, and they seek to

do harm wherever they can. The bad-tempered and mischievous

water nagasMM tend to lash out if threatened, but otherwise they

prefer to withdraw from the world at large.

Of the minor naga races, banelar nagasSK are the cruelest,

most  cunning,  and  most  desirous  of  magic  and  power.  Bone

nagasSK,  undead  creatures  consumed  with  hatred  and  malice,

detest  servitude  above  all  else,  but  they  are  otherwise  akin

to  the  nagas  they  once  were.  Ha-nagasSK  revel  in  their  own

devastating prowess, seeing all other creatures as lesser beings

that should bow down before them. NagahydrasSK are fearsome

predators that haunt the depths of the darkest forests and prey

on lesser races.

Description

A naga has a long, snakelike body covered with glistening scales

and a more or less human face. A typical specimen ranges in

length  from  10  to  20  feet  and  weighs  between  200  and  500

pounds, but nagas 100 feet or more in length (such as the larg-

est ha-nagas) are also known. The eyes of a naga are bright and

intelligent, burning with an almost hypnotic light.

Major Naga Subraces

The  major  subraces  are  all  quite  distinctive  in  appearance,

despite their general similarity of form.

DARK NAGA

This  creature  has  a  deep  purple,  eel-like  body  covered  in   ne

scales. Its tail ends in a barbed stinger, and its head resembles an

eels except that it has a humanlike visage. Their statistics are

found on page 191 of the Monster Manual.

NAGAS

GUARDIAN NAGA

A guardian naga looks like a snake with a beautiful human face.

Its  body  is  covered  with  green-gold  scales  that  exude  a  sweet,

 oral scent. A gold frill extends from the top of its head to the tip

of its tail. See page 192 of the Monster Manual for full details.

IRIDESCENT NAGA

This  gentle  creature  gets  its  name  from  the   ne,  mirrorlike

scales that cover its body, radiating a scintillating array of colors

whenever it moves. Its head is only vaguely human, and it has

colorful feathers in lieu of hair. A frill of silver feathers extends

from its neck down to its tail. Iridescent naga statistics are given

on page 76.

SPIRIT NAGA

Cloaked in the cloying stink of carrion, this creature looks as

foul as it smells. The black body of a spirit naga is banded in

swaths of bright crimson, and stringy hair hangs limply from

its vaguely human head. The Monster Manual describes them

on page 192.

WATER NAGA

The water naga is covered with emerald-green scales in reticu-

lated  patterns  that  run  the  length  of  its  body.  Fiery  red  and

orange spines jut out along its spine from the base of its vaguely

human head to the tip of its tail. Their statistics can be found

on page 192 of the Monster Manual.

Minor Naga Subraces

The  minor  subraces  of  nagakind  are  even  more  bizarre  in

appearance than the major ones.

BANELAR NAGA

This foul creature has a dark purple-green, snakelike body that

ends in a dull brown tail. A ring of tiny tentacles surrounds its

mouth, and a pair of green-white, glistening eyes is set deep into

its oversized humanoid head. See page 72 for their statistics.

BONE NAGA

Once a naga of a different kind, this undead horror has been

reduced to a serpentine skeleton with a bone tail stinger. Its skull

is humanlike except for its long fangs and the cold, cruel light

that burns within its empty eye sockets. The tempate appears

on page 75.

FAERNIAN HA-NAGA

This creatures scales have no set color; rather, they take on hues

to match their environment. A ha-nagas head is that of a clas-

sically beautiful human man or woman. For more information,

see page 75.

NAGAHYDRA

A nagahydra is a monstrous, snakelike creature with multiple

humanlike  heads.  Its  scales  are  multihued  and  arranged  in  a

reticulated pattern, and a thicket of  ery red and orange spines

juts from its body along each of its backbones. Their statistics

appear on page 77.

Racial History

Nagas were created by the sarrukh in the early days of Mhair-

shaulk. Like the yuan-ti, the nagas were the products of magical

interbreeding  that  combined  the  bodies  of  powerful  serpents

with the natural intelligence and inquisitiveness of the human

mind.  The   rst  nagas  produced  were  water  nagas,  bred  spe-

ci cally to explore Abeir-Toril for their increasingly withdrawn

masters. Only beings such as these could explore both on land

and below the sea.

Approximately  33,500  DR,  while  sarrukh-ruled  Mhair-

shaulk  slowly  declined,  the  heart  of  the  empire  increasingly

became the preserve of the yuan-ti. The unexplored territories

beyond  its  periphery,  however,  attracted  the  nagas,  who  made

longer and longer forays into the wilderness. By 24,000 DR,

when  yuan-ti-ruled  Mhairshaulk  fell,  the  nagas  had  almost

wholly  withdrawn  from  their  ancient  homeland  and  scattered

across all of Faern.

In the millennia that followed, many nagas became indi-

vidually  powerful  in  Faern,  but  they  never  came  together

to  forge  a  great  civilization  of  their  own.  Najara,  centered

on the Serpent Hills and the Forest of Wyrms, is the closest

thing to a powerful naga empire that has ever existed on Toril.

Nagas have always ruled the Kingdom of Snakes, the bulk of

its populace consists of ophidians, and most of the day-to-day

governance  is  conceded  to  the  yuan-ti  of  the  Hssta   tribe.

Indeed, only the subtle in uence of these yuan-ti has enabled

Najara to survive as long as it has. The Nagalands, south of the

Vilhon Reach, constitute a more typical example of the kind

of anarchical, individual-focused society that nagas naturally

form on their own.

After the fall of yuan-ti-ruled Mhairshaulk, different naga

bloodlines  began  to  favor  certain  inherent  traits  more  than

others,  and  in  time   ve  major  naga  subraces  evolved:  dark

nagas, guardian nagas, iridescent nagas, spirit nagas, and water

nagas. Some dark and spirit nagas sought out ancient rituals of

the sarrukh and transformed themselves into beings of immense

power known as ha-nagas. A few water nagas sought to reverse

the racial fragmentation, but the result was the creation of the

creatures now called nagahydras. The minor subraces known as

banelar  nagas  and  bone  nagas  both  appeared  within  the  past

two millennia. The former resulted from a magical ritual that

the followers of Bane employed on water nagas, and the latter

were the products of dark naga experimentation in the ebon arts

of necromancy.

NAGAS

Outlook

Nagas  are  inherently  curious  about  the  world  in  general  and

magic  in  particular.  They  hold  the  pursuit  of  knowledge  and

understanding above all other goals and the Art above all other

forms of study. While they can see the strategic advantages of

consulting a large library of wizard spells or entreating a deity

for divine support, most nagas see the Art as a natural exten-

sion of the mortal form. Thus, they tend to view sorcery as the

perfect embodiment of natural magic.

Most nagas view the preservation of cultural achievements

as  a  worthy  goal,  regardless  of  the  race  that  developed  them.

Thus, nagas of all subraces willingly seek that which has been

lost and guard the remains of fallen civilizations. Even ha-nagas

and spirit nagas, which normally revel in destruction, like to lair

amidst the ruins of lost cities or even the remains of temples,

castles, or other edi ces that they themselves have destroyed.

Most  nagas  see  their  own  limbless  physical  form  as  the

philosophical ideal for a true explorer and scholar. They view

the  use  of  physical  limbs  to  manipulate  the  environment  as

symptomatic of a lesser mind that has been diverted from true

understanding. According to some naga philosophies, the lesser

races  constitute  the  limbs  of  a  metaphysical  body  in  which

the naga is the brain. Thus, the pairing of nagas with lesser

servitors constitutes a perfect melding of mind and body.

Naga Society

Each naga calls members of its own subrace najassara, a nuanced

term loosely translated as embodiments of the ideal. They call

members of other naga subraces najassynsa (shadows of the ideal).

Young nagas of any kind are known as nagara, although that term

has acquired a secondary meaning that encompasses the ruling

dark naga caste of Najara. Bone nagas and rarer undead nagas are

called najasessynsa (eternal shadows of the ideal).

Nagas  never  speak  in  the   rst  person  singular,  preferring

instead the royal we. An individual naga of any kind always

refers  to  itself  as  SsaNaja  (we  the  ideal).  Members  of  lesser

races are termed distassara, (hands of the embodiment), while

more powerful creatures are called senthissassa (teachers worthy

of emulating).

Social Hierarchy

As noted previously, nagas of all kinds are  ercely independent

creatures.  They  have  no  concept  of  equal  rank  and  hence  no

word  for  peer.  Each  naga  considers  itself  perfect  and  other

members of its own subrace as nearly so.

Relationships

Although some nagas are perceived as male or female (including,

curiously, all naga deities), all are actually hermaphrodites. As

such, each naga is capable of both self-impregnation and copula-

tion with another of its subrace to fertilize the eggs of both.

Since neither form of reproduction is particularly favored over

the other, convenience and individual preference dictate how and

when any given naga reproduces. This  exibility also means that

the concept of a mate does not have the same importance to a

naga as it does to most other creatures.

Life Cycle

Each naga lays its eggs in its own lair and tends them until they

hatch. Young nagas are fed and trained by their parent, and the

nagara instinctively work together until they are strong enough

to survive on their own. At that point, the parent simply leaves

the lair for good and seeks out a new one.

Organization

Though nagas have little in the way of social structure, they do

understand the concept of the sagarassynsa, or nest. Originally,

the sagarassynsa encompassed only eggmates, since nagara of

the  same  hatching  must  work  together  to  survive  until  they

reach  adulthood.  Over  time,  however,  this  concept  has  been

extended to encompass small groups of allied adult nagas who

agree to work together toward a common set of goals. Eventu-

ally, such societal evolution may lead to naga tribes, but for now

nagas rarely work in groups of more than three or four, and

then only for limited periods of time.

Occasionally, a powerful outside in uence (such as an indi-

vidual phaerimm or a group of yuan-ti working in concert) can

forge much larger bands of nagas, but such social structures per-

sist only as long as outside pressure is applied to maintain them.

The longevity of the Kingdom of Snakes is due in large part to

the subtle in uence of the Hssta  tribe, whose leaders have held

the ruling nagas together for centuries. Their technique consists

of strictly indoctrinating the ruling class with the concept of the

greater nest and referring to its members as nagara. In this

way, they continually reinforce the notion that the nagas must

continue working together with others of their nest.

Naga Characters

The  typical  naga  is  a  natural  master  of  the  Art,  exhibiting

inherent spellcasting powers equivalent to those of a 7th-level

or higher spellcaster. (Banelar nagas are a notable exception to

this rule.)

Although nagas can advance by gaining additional Hit Dice,

mature individuals who have traveled far and wide can also ad-

vance via class levels, although most do not survive long enough

to do so. The favored class for such nagas is either sorcerer or bard,

and the favored classes for banelar nagas are cleric and wizard.

For the purpose of spellcasting, a naga is considered to have

virtual levels at least one spellcasting class that stack with any

actual  levels  it  has  in  the  same  class.  For  example,  a  typical

dark naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer, though it has none

of the other abilities of such a character (such as the ability to

summon  a  familiar).  A  dark  naga  that  acquired  one  sorcerer

26

620_96566_SerpentKingdom3.indd   26

5/11/04, 1:20:51 PM

NAGAS

level would be a dark naga sorcerer 1 who casts spells as an 8th-

level sorcerer, though it would function as a 1st-level sorcerer in

all other respects, including familiar bene ts.

Some  nagas  can  treat  spells  from  the  cleric  spell  list  and

certain domain spell lists as arcane spells and can choose them

as  spells  known  if  desired.  For  such  nagas,  gaining  additional

levels in the class it uses for spellcasting also gives it access to

higher-level  cleric  and  domain  spells.  For  example,  a  typical

spirit naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer and thus can know

3rd-level cleric spells and 3rd-level spells from the Chaos and

Evil domains as arcane spells. If that spirit naga acquires one

sorcerer level, it can then cast spells as an 8th-level sorcerer and

thus has access to 4th-level cleric and domain spells. Nagas do

not receive the granted powers of their domains.

Magic of the Nagas

Nagas  are  natural  spellcasters,  and  the  breadth  and  depth  of

their  experimentation  with  the  Art  rivals  that  of  any  other

race.  Because  their  ancestors  helped  the  sarrukh  establish  the

foundations of magic in Isstossef  l, Mhairshaulk, and Okoth,

modern-day nagas have a deep understanding of the history of

the Art and the context in which magical advances have been

made. Because of this natural af nity for research, a naga gains

a +4 racial bonus on Spellcraft checks made to develop a new

spell. Moreover, a naga does not require access to a well-stocked

library to pursue such a project.

Although  nagas  experiment  with  and  employ  all  types  of

spells, they are masters of divination and guile. Thus, they tend

to  favor  spells  from  the  schools  of  divination,  enchantment,

and illusion. Dark nagas in particular favor arcane eye, arcane

sight,  charm  monster,  charm  person,  command,  confusion,  dis-

guise self, eagles splendor, hypnotic pattern, detect magic, detect

thoughts,  foxs  cunning,  greater  mage  hand*,  identify,  mage

hand, misdirection, owls wisdom, prayer, read magic, scrying,

suggestion, vampiric touch, ventriloquism, and whispering wind.

Razorscales, venom re, and other spells developed and used by

nagas are detailed in Chapter 11.

Many nagas are skilled in the art of creating magic items.

They  invariably  favor  objects  that  they  can  employ  in  their

natural  forms,  so  items  worn  over  the  eyes  (lenses,  goggles,

and  masks),  on  the  head  (coronets,  diadems,  crowns,  hats,

headbands,  helmets,  and  phylacteries),  or  around  the  neck

(amulets, brooches, medallions, necklaces, periapts, and scarabs)

are common. Banelar nagas also utilize rings, rods, and wands

that  they  can  employ  with  the  tentacles  that  grow  around

their mouths.

Magic  items  commonly  created  and  used  by  nagas  include

arms of the naga (Savage Species), brooches of shielding, elixirs of

serpents, are detailed in Chapter 10. The art of crafting a naga

crown (actually a creation of the yuan-ti, see Chapter 10) has been

lost, if indeed nagas ever knew it.

See Magic of Faern.

Naga Deities

When  the  sarrukh  created  the  naga  race,  Mhairshaulk  was  a

monotheistic society that acknowledged and venerated only the

World Serpent. All other claimants to the mantle of divinity

were viewed as blasphemous heretics. However, the many facets

of the World Serpentand even other godsintrigued many

nagas, since they were by nature more curious than their cre-

ators. Some theologians now claim it was the endless questioning

of the World Serpent by the naga race that caused the Great

Scaled One to fragment into a host of lesser deities, while others

insist that the nagas were simply the  rst to recognize the World

Serpents impending fragmentation. Whatever the cause, sages

agree that the breakup of the World Serpent enabled the result-

ing deities to better address the myriad, contradictory demands

of its worshipers.

Of  all  the  emergent  aspects  of  the  Great  Scaled  One,  two

deities in particular attracted the worship of most nagas: Sshar-

strune and Shekinester. The former embodied the principles of

curiosity,  destruction,  and  possessiveness  that  had  precipitated

the  World  Serpents  fragmentation.  The  latter,  known  as  the

Naga Queen, became the keeper of the knowledge and wisdom

originally held by the World Serpent, preserved within the eter-

nal  ame that she guarded.

After the fall of Mhairshaulk, both Ssharstrune and Jazirian,

another fragment of the World Serpent, began to court Sheki-

nester. The Naga Queen eventually chose Jazirian and became

pregnant by him. Enraged by this decision, Ssharstrune attacked

Shekinester,  and  she  was  forced  to  swallow  him.  In  so  doing,

the Naga Queen took into herself the same destructive element

that had fragmented the World Serpent in the  rst place. As a

result,  she  acquired   ve  guises:  the  Acquirer,  the  Empowerer,

the Seeker, the Weaver, and the Preserver. This event was ac-

companied by a  vefold division in the naga race, forming the

 ve major subraces now known as dark nagas, guardian nagas,

iridescent nagas, spirit nagas, and water nagas.

Upon giving birth to Parrafaire, the Naga Prince, Shekin-

ester expelled Ssharstrunes remains and instructed her offspring

to hide away the destructive force that the corpse embodied for-

ever, so that her  vefold aspect could not actually divide her into

 ve separate goddesses. Parrafaire complied with her wishes, and

now both he and his mother are venerated as guardians of the

naga race.

An individual naga who worships Shekinester typically em-

braces one aspect of the goddess wholly but gives homage to all

her other guises as well. The Five-Faced Queen does not have an

organized church, and she largely eschews clerical support. Em-

bracing the magical heritage that runs in the bloodlines of her

followers, Shekinester allows some nagas to access divine powers

through arcane spellcasting. See Deities of the Scaled Ones in

the Appendix for more information on speci c deities.

Other Deities

Venerated by Nagas

The following deities also have signi cant naga followings.

BANE, THE BLACK LORD

Although  Bane  is  part  of  the  Faernian  pantheon  venerated

primarily  by  humans,  many  banelar  nagas  are  also  drawn  to

the tyranny of the Black Lord. According to legend, Bane once

taught his human followers the rediscovered ritual for transform-

ing water nagas into banelar nagas, thus ensuring himself a loyal

following within this minor naga subrace. Many banelar nagas

that had strayed to the faiths of Cyric and Iyachtu Xvim during

Banes absence from the pantheon have since returned to the Black

Lords fold, swelling the ranks of his followers once again.

Banelar nagas that ally with priests of Bane are considered

mid-level  priests  in  the  church  hierarchy,  with  all  the  at-

tendant  privileges  and  duties  stemming  from  such  a  ranking.

Further  information  about  the  Black  Lord  can  be  found  in

Faiths and Pantheons.

CYRIC, THE DARK SUN

During the fourteen years that Bane was dead, a large number of

banelar nagas forged alliances with the church of Cyric in order

to  further  their  own  evil  ends.  Since  Banes  return,  however,

most  of  them  have  gone  back  to  their  traditional  faith.  The

remaining Cyricist banelar nagas tend to be of neutral evil or

chaotic evil alignment, and they are actively hunted by followers

of the Black Lord. Further information about the Dark Sun can

be found in Faiths and Pantheons.

Relations with

Other Races

Nagas are extremely conscious of their status among the various

sentient and magic-wielding races of Faern. They view most

other  creatures  as  beneath  them  and  in  need  of  leadership,

education,  or  complete  domination.  This  belief  leads  many

dark and spirit nagas to establish small cults of servitors who

worship them as divine entities, and many guardian and irides-

cent nagas to become teachers and guides for those who would

bene t from their insight and wisdom. Conversely, many nagas

willingly serve beings with potent, internal magic that exceeds

their own mastery of the Art, including dragons, phaerimms,

sarrukh, sharn, and certain yuan-ti.

Nagas  have  far  less  dif culty  leading  large  numbers  of

lesser creatures than they do interacting with others of their

own kind, since subservient creatures do not challenge their

sense  of  individuality.  An  evil  naga  mastermind  attended

by a cult of worshipers perceives itself as effectively alone,

with  the  lesser  races  acting  as  tools  or  physical  extensions

of  its  will.  Likewise,  a  good-aligned  naga  teacher  attended

by a band of disciples also perceives itself as alone, with the

lesser  races  serving  as  empty  containers  in  which  to  store

its  wisdom.  Such  narcissistic  racial  perceptions  give  rise  to

a  complete  intolerance  for  disloyaltyafter  all,  a  creature

should  be  able  to  direct  its  own  limbs  without  fearing

argument or betrayal.

Naga Equipment

Nagas use little in the way of mundane equipment. A few have

armor specially designed for their sinuous bodies, but most shun

it  because  it  inhibits  their  movement.  Weapons  are  useless  to

nagas, since they have no manipulative appendages.

Naga Encounters

Player characters can encounter individual nagas almost any-

where, often supported by cults or small groups of followers.

Both human cities and remote locations can hide naga lairs,

though good-aligned nagas often make the locations of their

lairs  public  so  that  they  can  direct  the  activities  of  their

followers openly.

Ready-to-Use

Villains and Allies

Nagas often pursue prestige classes of various kinds, particularly

those that enhance their spellcasting ability. The naga characters

presented below can be woven into adventures or encountered

individually.

MAHARISHI, SEER OF PROCALITH

Maharishi lairs amidst the ruins of Procalith at the western end

of the Dolphingulf, in the shadow of the Delphin Mountains.

Known  as  the  Seer  of  Procalith,  the  wise  guardian  naga  has

made the study of the sarrukh and the yuan-ti its lifes work,

focusing especially on their history and magic. Thus, the naga

has  become  known  far  and  wide  as  a  skilled  diviner  and  sage

of  all  things  serpentine.  Adventurers  of  all  stripes  seek  out

Maharishi  before  delving  into  the  Black  and  Mhair  Jungles,

knowing that the information it can provide may mean the dif-

ference between life and death in the heartlands of the yuan-ti.

Those who survive such treks often pay the mysterious oracle a

second visit upon their return to  nd out which of the artifacts

they have recovered are valuable and which bear fell curses of

the yuan-ti.

Maharishis actual lair has never been found. Those who seek

the naga simply camp out for a night in the ruined city, putting

to papyrus a summary of their questions or laying out the items

do not resist scrying attempts. If the Seer of Procalith is willing

to grant them an audience, it appears before them.

EBARNAJE, KING OF NAJARA

Ebarnaje, the reigning King of Snakes, is a powerful dark naga

who claimed the unique naga crown known as the Marlspire of

Najara in the Year of the Ormserpent (1295 DR), after the

untimely death of the previous ruler. The serpentine monarch

lairs in the Snake Pit of Sskhanaja, attended by the Guardian

of Najara and a half-dozen spirit nagas.

Although Ebarnaje is personally quite powerful, its authority

stems  primarily  from  its  strength  of  personality  and  its  abil-

ity to inspire the serpentfolk of Najara. The current King of

Snakes is patient, but much more ambitious than its immediate

predecessors. Ebarnaje backed the formation of the Cult of the

Dark  Naga  (see  Najara  in  Chapter  7)  in  hopes  of  adding  to

the store of spells and magic available to Najaras elite, but it

has yet to reveal what it intends to do upon acquiring such an

arsenal. The King of Snakes also backs plans to subvert the vil-

lage of Serpents Cowl by slow and steady means, and to regain

control of the ruined city of Ssthartissssun and reclaim it as

Najaras capitol.

Ebarnaje  reached  its  current  position  by  forging  alliances

with care and by pitting its underlings and rivals against one

another.  It  shows  no  sign  of  abandoning  such  tactics  now,

even  though  they  might  actually  hinder  the  achievement  of

its goals.

TERPENZI, THE GUARDIAN OF NAJARA

The bone ha-naga known as Terpenzi was the founder and the

 rst ruler of Najara, the Kingdom of Snakes. After its death

in  battle  against  the  Shadowking  during  the  waning  days  of

Ssthartissssun,  its  remains  were  converted  into  a  bone  naga,

and it guarded the abandoned City of Fountains for millennia.

NAGAS

During its long unlife, it gained considerable power as a naga

overlord (see Chapter 12: Prestige Classes).

Today, Terpenzi is the sinister Guardian of Najara, enslaved

to the will of each successive dark naga king by the Marlspire

of Najara. The bone ha-naga is utterly loyal to both the realm

it founded and the monarch who wears Najaras crown, though

it constantly presses against the magical strictures that enforce

its loyalty to the leader of the nagara. To that end, Terpenzi en-

gages in decades-long plots to undermine the rule of the nagara

without betraying the reigning king. Most of these plots involve

inducing adventurous Scaleless Ones to wage daring assaults on

the  ruling  nagara  and  destroy  the  Marlspire  of  Najara,  an

item  that  theyve  been  led  to  believe  threatens  the  safety  of

western Faern.

Like  the  serpentfolk,  the  lizard  races  are  diverse

and  have  little  in  common  except  for  their

barbaric  nature  and  their  heritage.  Most  were

created  by  the  sarrukh  tens  of  thousands  of  years  ago,  either

as servants or as agents capable of advancing whatever agenda

they had at the time. Although the sarrukh created hundreds,

if not thousands, of other lizard creatures during the heyday of

their empires, most were killed by competing races or proved

incapable of surviving in the wilderness. Those that still exist

today are hardy, determined, and hostile.

Asabis

Asabis are desert-dwelling, reptilian humanoids. Native to the

Isstossef  l  Empire,  which  stood  where  the  Anauroch  desert

is now, asabis are still primarily found within and beneath the

Great Desert. The name asabi was given to these creatures by the

Bedine tribes. In earlier times, they were known as the laertia

name given to them by the Netherese.

Asabis are warlike creatures with a love of battle unequalled

by most other races. They often form mercenary bands or are

enlisted into the service of more powerful evil creatures.

Overview

The asabi race encompasses two separate subraces. The  rst and

most common is the standard asabi; the second is the stingtail.

Both are described in Monsters of Faern.

Description

A  typical  asabi  of  either  subrace  stands  about  7  feet  tall  and

has a 9-foot-long tail that stabilizes it when it stands. It walks

upright but hunched over, with a gait that wobbles to and fro.

An asabis limbs protrude from its sinuous body at odd angles,

and it moves with quick, awkward-looking gestures. Its narrow

skull features a sloping forehead that ends in protruding brows.

Its pebbly skin varies in color from brown to gray and is lighter

on its belly.

STANDARD ASABI

Standard  asabis  are  primarily  warriors.  They  enjoy   ghting,

and they are accustomed to organizing themselves in disciplined

ranks. Asabis are happy to  ght for their masters (if enslaved)

or for whoever pays them the most gold.

STINGTAIL

Stingtails also take naturally to battle. They are generally more

powerful than standard asabis, but they also behave more chaoti-

cally on the battle eld.

Racial History

Like many of the scaly races, asabis were created by the sarrukh

before  the  fall  of  their  empires.  The  sarrukh  designed  asabis

speci cally to  ght their battles. In the millennia since their

creation, these warlike creatures have not changed their focus

at all, nor have they spread throughout Faern as many other

species have done.

Many  asabis  who  were  originally  loyal  to  the  sarrukh

remained  so  when  their  empires  crashed  down  around  them.

Today,  the  offspring  of  those  loyal  asabis  continue  to  live  in

what  remains  of  Isstossef  lnamely,  a  single  subterranean

stronghold in the catacombs of ruined Oreme. The sixty ancient

sarrukh  liches  who  dwell  in  the  Crypt  of  Dreaming  Lizards

nominally rule this place, though only one of them is awake at

any given time. The one currently in charge allows the asabis

to govern themselves, considering them trustworthy since they

have chosen to remain of their own volition. These asabis main-

tain a powerful defense against potential intruders. The asabis

of Oreme believe it is their duty to protect the lich kings and go

to war for them should the need arise.

Other  asabis  that  were  once  loyal  to  the  sarrukh   ed  un-

derground  when  the  three  empires  were  destroyed.  The  harsh

life there caused disagreements that fragmented the group, and

eventually several different asabi clans carved out homes within

the Underdark. Many of those communities thrived, continued

to multiply, and conquered new territory below ground. Others

were  enslaved  under  powerful  masters  or  chose  to  put  their

instinctual aptitude for war to use as mercenaries.

Asabi troops have participated in numerous armed con icts

throughout Faern. One notable example occurred in the Year

of  the  Turret  (1360  DR),  when  the  Zhentarim  raised  an

army in Anauroch that included a large number of asabis.

Their intent was to subjugate the Bedine tribes and seize

control of the trade routes, but their plan was foiled by

a  Harper  named  Lander  and  a  Bedine  witch  named

Ruha, who united the Bedine tribes and defeated the

Zhentarim Army.

vidual can aspire. Such a death ensures the asabi a place in the

palace of her gods.

While asabis delight in warfare, they are not hateful oppo-

nents. They know that their craft results in their own deaths

as well as the deaths of their enemies, and they accept this

outcome as part of the natural life cycle. When alliances shift

and old enemies become new allies, they greet their former

foes with open arms and march into battle side by side. Asabis

make lifetime enemies only when

allies  betray  them  or  when

they  are  enslaved  and

forced  to  serve  under  a

brutal master.

Asabi Society

Groups  of  asabis  often  settle  in  small

villages or form large mercenary bands. A

community is usually led by a council

of  elders  and  a  war  chief,  with

both wielding the same amount

of power. The council of elders

is  made  up  of  laborers

representing  the  non-

combatants  within  the

group,  including  the

young,  the  elderly,

and  parents  who  are

currently  raising  young.

The  war  chief  rises  to  power  by

forging  alliances  with  the  warriors

of the community and then taking com-

mand. Most disagreements that arise between

the two centers of power are settled peacefully.

Should  an  impasse

A  large  group  of

asabis has, until recently, been enslaved by the phaerimms.

These mindslaves, as they were called, were completely under the

control of their masters, who often sent them against the asabis

loyal to the liches of Oreme. Upon the defeat of the phaerimms

by  the  shades  of  Evereska,  thousands  of  asabis  that  had  once

been utterly dominated became free to pursue work as mercenar-

ies. For reasons unknown, a large group of them have recently

banded together and are now trekking toward the frozen sea.

Outlook

Asabis view warfare as a game, and they delight in slaying enemy

creatures. They understand that death is the eventual outcome

of a life devoted to warfare, but they believe that dying on the

battle eld is the most glorious achievement to which an indi-

Asabi

occur, the issue is brought before the community, which decides

the matter by majority vote.

The asabis of Oreme handle disagreements in a slight ly dif-

ferent way. The sarrukh lich that happens to be awake at the

time moderates any disputes that cannot be solved between the

council of elders and the war chief. The liches prefer to deal with

standard  asabis  rather  than  the  stingtails  because  the  former

tend to be more intelligent.

RELATIONSHIPS

Stingtails  and  standard  asabis  coexist  within  the  same  com-

munities,  although  a  typical  settlement  has  a  larger  number

of one type than the other. The two subraces are usually free

to  intermingle  and  reproduce  with  one  another.  Each  off-

spring of a mixed pair has an equal chance to be a member of

either subrace.

LIZARDS

In most cases, no social stigma is attached to the minority

subrace in an asabi community. Despite the relative equity be-

tween the subraces, however, stingtail settlements tend to be less

orderly than standard asabi communities, and their leaders rule

by emotions rather than reason. Stingtails are more common-

ly found in highly aggressive warbands or groups intended for

front-line action, such as those that patrol the entrance to the

Crypt of the Dreaming Lizards in Oreme.

LIFE CYCLE

Female  asabis  lay  eggs  in  protected  shelters  and  tend  them

until they hatch. The young are raised by a small group

of asabis of both genders, who train them in the ways

of war. The composition of this group is  uid, with

adult asabis taking their turns at this service to the

community. Once an asabi reaches maturity, it is absorbed

into the  ghting force.

MERRSHAULK

The  asabis  of  Oreme,  in  service  to  the  same  sarrukh  liches

that once controlled the Isstossef  l Empire, still cling to the

ancient traditions and worship Merrshaulk, an older aspect of

Sseth. They are willing to worship the deity of their creators

simply out of loyalty to that race.

Worshipers of Merrshaulk must perform sacri ces regularly.

The  lich  kings  would  prefer  to  sacri ce  asabis  to  ful ll  this

requirement, since no other sacri ces are handy or convenient,

but they fear losing the loyalty of their protectors through abu-

sive orders. Thus, they have worked out a compromise. While

the  asabis  are  not  required  to  sacri ce  themselves  to

Merrshaulk, any asabi killed while defending Oreme is

considered a sacri ce. Should peace reign for too long,

the  asabis  are  charged  with  capturing  other  scaly

creatures  to  sacri ce.  Most  often,  they  bring  back

troglodytes  or  lizardfolk  from  the  nearby  caverns

and wilderness areas.

Asabi Characters

Most  asabi  characters  prefer  to  take

levels  of   ghter  or  barbarian,  though

rangers,  rogues,  and  sorcerers  are  not

uncommon.  Asabis  who  travel  with

other races often become sell-swords.

Some standard asabis are willing

to enter human civilizations and

learn about human and humanoid

cultures, and many of those who do

eventually overcome their evil natures. Stingtails,

however, are likely to remain evil and barbaric wherever they

serve. Members of this subrace are usually employed exclusively

as mercenaries, and they almost never transcend that function

within the groups they join.

Asabi fighter

Magic of the Asabis

Asabis  use  very  little  magic  and  few  magic  items.  Most

spellcasting asabis are either clerics or sorcerers. The latter are

normally viewed as assets on the battle eld, although they are

otherwise distrusted by the majority of their fellows. Clerics are

the spiritual leaders and healers of asabi communities, and as

such,  they  are  usually  considered  too  valuable  to  risk  on  the

battle eld. Aside from the adults who tend the young, clerics are

the only able-bodied members of an asabi community exempted

from war.

Asabi  have  developed  no  spells  or  magic  items  unique  to

their race.

Deities of the Asabis

Different asabi communities worship different deities. Most ven-

erate fragments of the World Serpent, but Semuanya actually

has the largest number of asabi followers.

34

SEMUAN-YA

The  asabis  that  escaped  the

domineering  phaerimms  had

no  god  until  after  they  were  freed.

Shortly  thereafter,  they  happened  upon  a

lizardfolk cleric of Semuanya and adopted this deity

as their own. The lizardfolk cleric has since left

the asabis, but a number of the stingtails from

the  original  group  took  cleric  levels  so  that

they could provide spiritual leadership for the group.

These clerics are the true source of power in the community,

since this generation has had no exposure to other asabis.

Relations with Other Races

Asabis are accustomed to serving other races, either as slaves or

as employed mercenaries. Thus, they tend to treat all intelligent

creatures that have not been identi ed as enemies with respect.

Throughout  Anauroch,  large  numbers  of  asabis  have  been

forced into slavery by groups such as the phaerimms and the be-

holders of XunQoroth. Enslaved groups serve faithfully if their

masters treat them well. If they are tortured, overworked, or

otherwise abused, however, they plot not only their own escape,

but also the downfall of their masters. Many a cruel warlord

who put a group of asabis to work has been surprised by a knife

in the back from one of his faithful slaves.

Asabi Equipment

Asabis  prefer  steel  weapons  and  armor  over  magic  items  of

almost any sort. Most have the ability to forge metal, though

many tribes do not have the resources to do so and must rely on

plunder for such supplies.

Firenewts

Firenewts live in hot spots, primarily volcanic regions and des-

erts. These bipedal monstrous humanoids are as warlike as the

asabis, but not as loyal.

Overview

Though  they  are  distantly  related  to  the  lizardfolk,   renewts

are unlike many of the other scaly races because they were not

created by the sarrukh. Some sages have suggested that a few

lizardfolk  wandered  into  the  Firelands  (the  Underdark  region

that lies below the Jungles of Chult) and slowly evolved into  -

renewts, while others believe that these creatures were the result

of magical  experimentation.

Description

A  renewt resembles a bipedal lizard with a long tail. Its hands

are clawed, and its reversed knees give it an exceptional capacity

for running and jumping. Its skin is a blotchy sepia color that

is darkest along the spine, fading to near-white on the belly. Its

lizardlike  face  is  smooth  and  unremarkable  save  for  its  large,

inky-black eyes.

Firenewt warriors wear armor and usually  ght with swords

or  other  martial  weapons.  They  prefer  mounted  combat,  and

most train giant striders as mounts. Statistics for both  renews

and giant striders appear in

Monsters of Faern.

Racial History

Whatever the circumstances of their creation,  renewts origi-

nated in the Firelands more than 15,000 years ago. Over time,

 renewt raiding parties pushed up into the Peaks of Flame via

lava tubes that connected the Burning Rift with the volcanoes

above.  From  there,  they  spread  into  the  surrounding  jungles.

Had it not been for the intervention of the yuan-ti,  renewts

would probably never have roamed beyond Chult.

In the early days of the Serpentes Empire, the yuan-ti discov-

ered the  renewts. Recognizing their aptitude for combat, the

yuan-ti immediately enlisted the aid of their new acquaintances

on the  eld of battle. The  renewts utilized a hammer-and-an-

vil tactic that involved placing a visible unit directly ahead of

their enemies and a larger unit just out of view. Once their ene-

mies drew close to the smaller, visible unit, the larger one struck

from the sides with melee and breath weapons. Meanwhile, the

smaller unit peppered the foe with arrows. This tactic, heretofore

unseen  in  Faern,  proved  remarkably  effective  against  enemy

skirmish units.

By the time Serpentes fell,  renewts had spread throughout

Faern. The great armies of the empire disbanded, leaving isolated

colonies of  renewts all over the continent. Although they could

have journeyed back to the Peaks of Flame, most of the  renewts

were one or two generations removed from those who had quit

their ancestral homeland to  ght for the serpentfolk. A few made

the return trek, but most settled in other volcanic peaks through-

out Faern, and a few made new homes in the  deserts.

Since their resettlement across the continent,  renewts have

been  a  menace  to  travelers  and  those  species  unlucky  enough

to live near them. Their surprise tactics are legendary among

Firenewts on giant striders

their enemies, but these techniques still remain effective, since

their enemies dont know where a surprise attack might origi-

nate.  Since  most   renewts  live  in  mountain  peaks,  they  tend

to concentrate their raids against other groups of  renewts as

well as other humanoids, such as goblins, orcs, and other moun-

tain-dwelling  creatures.  Firenewts  are  a  constant  source  of

harassment to the Bedine tribes of the Anauroch desert, and re-

cently the Bedines have devoted enormous resources to seeking

out  renewt settlements and destroying them.

THE LEGEND OF INFERNO

Traditionally,   renewts  use  the  giant  striders  native  to  the

Flame  Vault  on  Tuern  as  mounts.  How  they  acquired  such

mounts,  however,  is  a  matter  of  some  speculation,  since  no

 renewt has ever actually visited this location.

According to legend, a red dragon of the Starmounts by the

name of Inferno once sought a small cadre of  re-based crea-

tures to serve him. Seeing the  renewts of the Peaks of Flame

during one of his forays and deciding that they were well quali-

 ed to be his underlings, he approached them with a proposal:

In  exchange  for  the  service  of  a  large  band  of   renewts,  he

would provide the colony with an immense pile of gold that the

residents could use to recast their statue of Kossuth. The  re-

newts, who had seen mounted knights and recognized the value

of mounts in combat, made a counterproposal. If the dragon

could  nd a creature that the  renewts could ride and breed,

they would give him  fty of their warriors.

Inferno  agreed  and  left  to  seek  suitable  creatures.  Several

months later, he returned carrying an immense bag  lled with

giant strider eggs, which he presented to the  renewts along with

instructions for hatching them. The  renewts hatched the eggs

and quickly discovered the usefulness of the giant striders. In re-

turn, they honored their agreement and selected  fty  renewt

warriors to follow Inferno, whom they served for the remainder

of their lives.

Outlook

Despite  their  societys  apparent  orderliness,   renewts  are  ex-

treme  sadists.  They  delight  in  the  torture  of  virtually  every

creature,  especially  sentient  ones  such  as  humans  and  other

humanoids.  Firenewts  often  become  enemies  or  rivals  of  one

another,  ghting over assets, social standing, or mates. Murder

is common within any given tribe, though fear of retribution

from the slain  renewts family, the clerics, or even the overlord

prevents numerous killings. The most expedient way of elimi-

nating a rival is simply not to aid him during a battle, allowing

him  to  be  overwhelmed  by  opponents.  When  such  a  solution

is not feasible, simply slaying the rival and hiding or destroy-

ing his body is the next most common means of elimination.

Though  everyone  knows  the  missing   renewts  probably  fate,

the standard assumption is that he simply wandered elsewhere

and failed to return.

Firenewt Society

Firenewt  tribes  living  in  close  proximity  to  one  another  are

almost  never  on  friendly  terms.  At  the  best  of  times,  they

ignore each other, and at the worst they  ght vicious wars. In

fact,  renewts are more likely to be at war with their own kind

than they are with other hated races. Whether or not a war has

been declared, the greatest honor a  renewt raiding party can

achieve  is  to   nd  the  hatching  chambers  of  a  rival  tribe  and

destroy its eggs.

A  typical   renewt  community  is  ruled  by  a  single  over-

lordtypically  the  most  charismatic  individual  in  the  tribe.

The overlords primary function is to plan raids, assign  renewt

warriors to various trade routes, and ensure that his subjects are

properly  trained  and  combat-ready.  Although   renewts   ght

constantly if given the chance, only the overlord actually has

the power to declare war upon enemies. In many cases, he may

choose to harass enemies with quick raids or other actions that

require fewer resources than an all-out war.

While the overlord makes the major decisions for a  renewt

tribe, clerics of Kossuth oversee the day-to-day functions. These

spiritual leaders decide which of their captive humans or human-

oids will become meals, attend to the welfare of the tribe, and

offer healing as needed.

Firenewts prefer to dine on humanoids of almost any kind.

They can survive on the meat of herd animals, wild beasts, or

even rodents, but they resort to such fare only when they are

completely  out  of  their  preferred  food.  If  there  are  multiple

humanoids are available,  renewts always select humans  rst,

followed by elves, dwarves, and then other humanoids. Firenewt

tradition  holds  that  brutally  torturing  creatures  before  death

makes them tastier. Once the meat has been cooked, the clerics

eat the juiciest parts, then distribute the rest among the other

members of the tribe.

Societal laws vary from tribe to tribe. The most commonly

addressed  offenses  are  murder  and  the  theft  of  food.  While

the overlord can step in and judge such matters if desired, the

tribal clerics handle most of the criminal proceedings. Death is

the most common penalty for those found guilty of offenses.

Such killings tend to be even more brutal than the torture of

humanoids slated for meals. A condemned  renewt is tortured

for a minimum of three days. After various body parts have

been  removed,  stabbed,  or  sliced  open,  the   renewt  is  treated

with sarsson, an herb that giant striders  nd irresistible, and fed

alive to his own mount.

RELATIONSHIPS

Firenewts  take  mates  within  their  own  tribes  as  they  please,

but  such  relationships  rarely  last  long.  The  ambition  of  these

creatures and their propensity for treachery far outweigh their

loyalty to any individual. Likewise, the membership of an indi-

vidual warband always remains  uid, allowing for a change of

venue when disagreements threaten the stability of a group.

LIFE CYCLE

The  propagation  of  the   renewt  race  is  both  dif cult  and

treacherous. After a female has produced a clutch, her eggs are

taken  to  a  heavily  guarded  hatching  ground.  There,  they  are

placed near lava vents or other sources of heat to ensure that

they remain warm. Once an egg begins to hatch, the baby  re-

newt must tear free within 1 minute or it is deemed too weak to

survive. Such a failure to hatch is viewed as a sign that Kossuth

is displeased with the tribe, so the attending cleric sacri ces the

hapless young  renewt to the god. Such killings are rare, but

clerics actually engineer hatching failures on occasion to end the

bloodlines of their enemies.

Magic of the Firenewts

As a race,  renewts have no particular talent for arcane magic,

so they almost never become wizards or sorcerers. Because they

are devout followers of the god Kossuth, however, clerics are an

important element of their society. Firenewts rarely create new

magic items, although their clerics do have some spells that are

unique (see erupt, lava missile, and lava splash in Chapter 11).

Deities of the Firenewts

The fact that  renewts worship Kossuth instead of some aspect

of the World Serpent provides further support for the theory

that  they  were  not  created  by  the  sarrukh.  In  fact,  the   re-

newts are among the oldest and most faithful devotees of the

Flamelord.  Though  cults  of  Kossuth  are  plentiful  in  Faern,

the god truly seems to favor the  renewts. Their clerics teach

that Kossuth imbued  renewts with  ame when he freed them

from the dominion of the World Serpent in the depths of the

Burning Rift.

During  the  Time  of  Troubles,  Kossuth  appeared  in  the

Burning Rift beneath the Peaks of Flame and chose a  renewt

blackguard  named  Chassan,  overlord  of  a  local  tribe,  as  his

avatar.  Kossuth/Chassan  led  the   renewts  into  a  brutal  war

with  the  pterafolk  of  the  Chultengar,  and  the  con ict  lasted

until  the  Avatar  Crisis  had  ended.  Kossuth  returned  to  the

planes, leaving the charred corpse of Chassan in his wake, but

the  god  later  rewarded  Chassans  loyalty  by  allowing  him  to

return to his tribe as a death ame (a version of a death knight;

see Chassan, below). Chassan, who still leads the Ackta tribe by

the Flamelords decree, is one of the few  renewt overlords who

also holds sway over the clerics of Kossuth.

Firenewts  follow  most  of  the  traditions  practiced  by  Kos-

suths  followers  elsewhere  in  Faern.  They  believe  that  their

souls are tempered by  re, that  re is the cleansing force of the

multiverse, and that only the strongest survive the  ame. Like

other followers of Kossuth,  renewts test themselves with pain,

but since  ame is a part of their beings, they must choose other

forms of pain with which to test their mettle. Thus,  renewts

often test the worthiness of their young by submerging them

in  cold  water  for  as  close  to  a  full  minute  as  possible.  Those

who endure an entire minute of submersion without crying out

are deemed worthy to enter the clergy of Kossuth. Those who

endure less than half a minute are sacri ced to Kossuth, and the

rest become warriors in the service of the overlord.

Unlike  most  of  Kossuths  faithful,   renewts  do  not  divide

their clergy between the tendrils and burning braziers. Instead,

one single group called the Chalices of Brass is entrusted with

tending to the needs of the  renewts and leading them in faith.

These priests are responsible for torturing and preparing food

for the tribe, ensuring that the eggs are properly hatched, and

leading the  renewts in prayer and sacri ce.

Each  renewt tribe has a golden idol in the shape of Kossuth.

Strangely, while most believe that Kossuth is a  renewt made

of living  ame, the golden idol always resembles a great lizard.

(The fact that the  renewts were the last to look upon the gods

form during the Time of Troubles suggests that he might in fact

normally assume this shape.) The golden idols of Kossuth vary

in size from one tribe to the next. In general, the overlord evenly

distributes the gold acquired from raiding among the members

of the tribe, although the clerics are normally given the largest

portion.  Once  they  have  acquired  a  large  enough  supply,  they

melt it down and reforge it into a larger idol of Kossuth.

Fiewnewts also play a role in the greater church of Kossuth.

Several hundred years ago, three prominent  renewt mercenary

bands approached the human-led branch of the church to offer

their services. The Church of Kossuth accepted their help, using

them  as  temple  guards  as  well  as  escorts  for  their  traveling

clergy.  This  arrangement  continued  until  the   renewts  were

indoctrinated into the religion as guardians and living examples

of  Kossuths  mastery  over   re.  At  that  point,  they  became  a

much  more  important  aspect  of  the  church.  Now  a  typical

temple of Kossuth is protected by more than one hundred  re-

newts and roughly half that number of giant striders. Some of

these  renewts are bred in the church, and others are recruited

from the outside. Firenewts wishing to leave may do so freely at

any time.

Firenewt Characters

Firenewts  are  not  often  found  living  among  other  races,  and

they  are  almost  always  hostile  when  interactions  do  occur.

Should  an  entire   renewt  tribe  be  slaughtered,  the  survivors

may join local mercenary groups in the region, since they are

not normally welcome among other tribes. Given a choice, such

 renewts typically join evil groups that raid civilized areas.

Rarer  even  than  survivors  of  lost  tribes  are  outcasts  that

have  turned  their  backs  on  Kossuth  and   renewt  society  and

lived to tell the tale. These rare and unique  renewts are nor-

mally good or neutral, and some of them even form alliances

with good creatures. In fact, rumor has it that several  renewts

turned their backs on the tribes in the Peaks of Flame and were

subsequently taken in by a couatl.

sports a colorful,  aring crest that is unique in color and shape.

Its long powerful tail is used for balance rather than combat.

Khaasta statistics appear in the Fiend Folio.

Relations with Other Races

Firenewts  view  other  creatures  as  little  more  than  food,  and

they  are  notoriously  sadistic  and  cruel.  Firenewt  war  parties

frequently ambush travelers and disable enemy mounts to slow

and confuse their foes, then mount a surprise attack. After win-

ning the battle,  renewts often prolong the thrill of the hunt

by of allowing some of their captives to escape, then tracking

them down and recapturing them. The  renewts mounts play

a key role in such recaptures, since giant striders can track prey

by scent and identify places where their quarry has been for up

to three days after it has left.

Firenewt Equipment

Regardless of their location in Faern, most  renewt tribes keep

 ightless birds known as giant striders (Monsters of Faern, page

51) that serve as their mounts. Giant strider eggs are hatched at

the same locations as the  renewt young, although they require

even  more  heat  than  the   renewt  eggs.  Upon  hatching,  each

giant  strider  bonds  with  a   renewt,  becoming  its  mount  and

friend  until  death.  The   renewt  in  turn  raises  and  trains  the

creature and takes full responsibility for its welfare. The giant

strider continues to serve its master even after death, providing

food,  bones  from  which  tools  can  be  fashioned,  and  hide  for

leathermaking.

Khaastas

Sometimes mistaken for powerful lizardfolk, khaastas are extra-

planar creatures native to the Abyss. On their home plane and

the Barrens of Doom and Despair (where many have migrated),

khaastas are mercenaries and  ghters who impose their will on

others  by  force  of  arms.  In  Abeir-Toril,  however,  they  take  a

much more cautious approach, staying on the outskirts of so-

ciety and interacting with the natives only when they need to

The khaastas are nomadic creatures by nature. Like many of the

other lizard races, they were bred for war and have an unusual

talent for waging it. When not doing battle with their own en-

emies, they are happy to  ght on behalf of anyone else willing

to hire their services.

Description

Though physically similar to a lizardfolk, a khaasta appears con-

siderably more imposing. Its scales are small, and each individual

Racial History

Sometime in the distant past, the demon prince Demogorgon

created the khaastas as servitorsspeci cally, to serve as war-

riors in his armies. As the demon lords power increased, scores

of demons joined his army, and the best and brightest of them

quickly  rose  to  leadership  positions.  These  demonic  generals

found the khaastas dif cult to command, and in many cases,

not as effective in battle as true demons. When they complained

to Demogorgon, he pondered the khaastas thousands of years

of loyal service and, in a brief moment of generosity, decided

to free them.

The  khaastas  wasted  no  time  establishing  alliances  with

other demonic powers. They offered to help defend the domains

of several demon lords in return for permission to hunt there,

and most of those they approached found wisdom in such an

arrangement. Such deals forged close relationships between the

demons and the khaastas, and eventually both sides agreed to

help  one  another  in  case  of  attack.  Over  time,  the  khaastas

became particularly friendly with Sessinnek, a demon lord who

sought the mantle of divinity.

When the sarrukh who survived the fall of the Okothian

Empire sought allies in the Abyss, their eyes fell upon the

khaastas.  Erroneously  assuming  that  these  creatures  were

no  more  powerful  than  the  lizardfolk  they  had  created  in

Faern,  the  sarrukh  immediately  tried  to  enslave  them.

Not only did their efforts fail, but the attempt offended the

khaastas to such a degree that they immediately declared war

on the sarrukh.

The sarrukh called on what few reinforcements they could

muster  from  Faern,  including  an  army  of  lizardfolk  led  by

yuan-ti  masters,  and  war  was  joined.  Not  understanding  that

the Okothian sarrukh were actually refugees from Faern, the

khaastas hatched a plan to corrupt what they believed to be their

enemies base of power in that world. They petitioned Sessinnek

for  aid,  and  he  sent  demons  to  take  control  of  the  lizardfolk

tribes throughout Faern that the khaastas believed were sup-

porting  the  sarrukh  invasion.  Though  this  demonic  incursion

had no effect on the war between the sarrukh and the khaastas,

the demons did stay long enough to breed extensively with the

lizardfolk, giving rise to the half- endish lizardfolk known as

the lizard kings (see Lizard Kings, below).

The  war  dragged  on  for  centuries,  often  spilling  out  into

some of the outlying planes. Although it had long since become

a  war  of  attrition  for  both  sides,  momentum   nally  built  in

favor of the khaastas under a ruler called Maadaril. A brilliant

tactician  whose  family  had  been  slaughtered  by  the  sarrukh,

Maadaril  proved  himself  capable  of  uniting  several  khaasta

factions against the sarrukh. At last, he led his forces to victory,

crushing the sarrukhs remaining yuan-ti and lizardfolk allies in

the process. The defeated sarrukh returned to Okoth.

Despite their victory, the khaastas had come to hate the sar-

rukh with a vengeance for killing so many of their kind. Upon

following  their   eeing  enemies  to  Faern  to  complete  their

destruction, they learned that the race was nearly extinct on its

home world. Unable to locate their quarry, they returned to the

Abyss, where Maadaril decreed that the war would not be truly

won until the last of the sarrukh had been destroyed. To that

end, he sent out khaasta scouts to gather information about the

sarrukh. They returned with news of a few areas where the sar-

rukh had existed thousands of years ago. Maadaril ordered the

khaasta armies to invade those areas and destroy any sarrukh

they found there, but most of these forces returned with neither

news nor any trail to follow.

At  last,  Maadaril  decided  to  scale  back  the  number  of

khaastas he committed to Faern and send the more civilized

and  intelligent  members  of  their  race  to  gather  information

instead. Several small groups of khaastas traveled to numerous

points  throughout  Faern,  eventually  unearthing  a  trail  that

led to their sworn enemies. Raids followed, and though the sar-

rukh managed to defend their strongholds in Faern, they grew

worried enough to strike a deal with Set. In exchange for help

against the khaastas, they agreed to help him bind Sseth, the

aspect  of  the  World  Serpent  that  they  worshiped.  Set  created

the  wereserpents  as  a  symbol  of  this  pact,  and  he  also  man-

aged to secure some werecrocodiles from his ally Sebek to send

against  the  khaastas.  This  aid  prevented  the  khaastas  from

in icting heavy casualties upon the sarrukh, but the attackers

were forced to withdraw from many of the locations in Okoth

to  the  underground  crypt  of  SarRukoth.  In  this  stronghold,

they were protected not only by their minions, but also by miles

of  subterranean  tunnels.  Although  the  khaastas  continued  to

send out raiding parties, they no longer knew where the sarrukh

were hiding, so they began making random strikes throughout

the  area  in  hopes  of  uncovering  them.  In  the  meantime,  the

Okothian  sarrukhs  betrayal  of  Sseth  made  enemies  of  the

yuan-ti and sarrukh of Serpentes, who chose to remain loyal to

their god.

The sarrukh struck back at the khaastas by using polymorph

to turn a yuan-ti assassin into a khaasta and sending him to the

Barrens of Doom and Despair. This agent in ltrated Maadarils

camp and slew him by slipping poison into his food. The khaas-

tas correctly assumed that the sarrukh were responsible, so they

renewed the intensity of their attacks on Faern.

Currently, the khaastas and the sarrukh are at a stalemate.

The sarrukh are in hiding in a heavily forti ed position, and

the khaastas have only vague clues as to where this stronghold

might be. Meanwhile, the khaastas are becoming more and more

entrenched  in  Faern,  where  they  have  staked  out  territorial

claims  in  Okoth,  the  Heartlands,  the  Unapproachable  East,

and Mulhorand.

Outlook

The khaastas view Faern as a tremendously challenging place,

where they must  ght their own instincts to wage war against

the native inhabitants while gathering the information necessary

to hunt down the sarrukh. Since most of the scaly races inexpli-

cably refuse to betray the progenitor race, the khaastas face the

daunting  task  of  gathering  this  information  from  humanoids

and other civilized beings of Faerngroups that in fact know

very little about the sarrukh.

Khaasta Society

The khaastas have always been willing to exploit weakness when-

ever they encounter iteven within their own species. Shortly

after they were freed by Demogorgon, they fell to squabbling

and  nearly  drove  themselves  to  extinction  through  constant

in ghting.  The  reasons  for  such  con ict  ranged  from  simple

dislike of their fellows to power struggles in which rival factions

tried to oust leaders and assume control of various tribes. But

the khaastas were no fools, and when they realized what a toll

this in ghting was taking upon their numbers, they instituted

ritual combat as a method of handling disputes. Though khaas-

tas continue to  ght and murder one another, this arrangement

results in far fewer deaths. Furthermore, because ritual combat

forces each khaasta to stand up for itself when wronged, laws are

virtually nonexistent.

Khaasta society in Faern, however, takes on a different

form. Because the khaastas living there must remain focused

on their main goal of eradicating the sarrukh, they tend to

focus their combat skills on ridding their territory of men-

acing  creatures  rather  than  on  engaging  in  glorious  battle

with one another. In addition, the highly magical nature of

Abeir-Toril  forces  many  to  undertake  training  they  would

not otherwise have pursued simply to ensure the survival of

their forces.

RELATIONSHIPS

Khaastas  bear  little  love  for  one  another  under  any  circum-

stances, though they are disciplined enough to join forces when

needed. They choose mates based primarily on battle prowess.

Though unions are usually for life, mates rarely like one another

and  spend  as  little  time  together  as  possible.  True  friendships

are likewise rare, since any personal alliances tend to dissolve in

the next perceived insult or ambitious power play. Khaastas do,

however, honor their parents and other mature relativesalbeit

sometimes grudgingly.

LIFE CYCLE

Unlike many scaly races, khaastas are born alive, normally in

litters of three or four at a time. Within a year of birth, each

newborns family gives her an ornate masterwork scimitar, which

she is expected to keep and use in battle for the remainder of

her life. Should a khaastas blade ever be lost, she is expected to

explain why her birth scimitar is no longer with her.

Khaastas begin training their young to  ght at an early age.

The females of the race are just as aggressive as the males, and

they often carry their young into battle with them. During the

ten years it takes for a khaasta to mature, she learns swordsman-

ship, armor use, and the art of ritualized combat.

As soon as a khaasta comes of age, she must enter a ritual-

ized battle to  rst blood with a peer of the same age. The loser

owes a blood debt, or favor, to the victor. Blood debts are almost

always collected within the  rst year after the battle, and they

normally involve some kind of combatmost often protection

of the winners person during a raid. Since failure in such a duty

means immediate exile from the tribe, young khaastas are quite

willing to  ght to the death to ful ll a blood debt.

Virtually every khaasta that comes of age is a combatant.

Because so few ever reach old age, their true biological lifespan

remains uncertain, but most die before the age of thirty, with

elders  commonly  living  no  more  than  ten  years  beyond  that.

Because khaastas consider it shameful to die of old age, many

elders place themselves on the forefront of raiding parties and

undertake dangerous missions against their enemies.

FUNEREAL CUSTOMS

When a khaasta dies in combat, her tribe holds a great feast to

celebrate her departure. At the conclusion of the meal, the body

is burned in a great bon re, and the charred bones are interred

in a shallow pit in the tribes burial moundusually a small hill

in the Barrens of Doom and Despair. Journeying to the burial

mound  to  inter  the  dead  is  a  sacred  duty  offered  as  a  reward

for notable accomplishments in combat, and no more than  ve

khaastas may escort any one deceased individual.

One per year, the khaasta migratory pattern takes each tribe

to its burial mound. Upon arrival, the tribe holds a great feast

and sacri ces one of its captive enemies in honor of the dead.

The birth scimitar of each khaasta slain in the last year is passed

down to the next individual born into that family. Should there

be no young to receive the blade, the family name is inscribed

upon the hilt, and the scimitar is left at the burial mound. A

typical khaasta burial mound sports a ring of swords at the top,

commemorating clans that no longer exist.

Khaasta Characters

Khaastas that are part of the larger force opposing the sarrukh

almost never desert their own kind. Khaastas encountered singly

are either seeking information about the location of sarrukh or

outcasts who have taken up the use of arcane magic.

Khaastas  seeking  sarrukh  strongholds  normally  travel  in

groups  of  two  or  three,  though  they  occasionally  act  alone.

Most  have  learned  to  speak  Common  in  order  to  converse

with the civilized folk they encounter, but they remain aloof

and evasive about their origins when speaking with natives of

40

LIZARDS

Faern, never divulging their purpose or their feelings about

external  issues.  Some  hide  their  settlements  well;  others  fre-

quently relocate to avoid confrontation with any natives who

might seek to destroy them.

Outcast  wizards  and  sorcerers  typically  roam,  often  stum-

bling from one dangerous situation to another, until they are

eventually killed or wander into groups of mercenaries or other

evil-aligned creatures that prize their abilities. Occasionally, a

khaasta  nds herself in the company of good creatures, whom

she quickly labels as weak. Such alliances are usually doomed to

failure because of the friction such an attitude generates within

the group.

Magic of the Khaastas

Khaastas are not naturally inclined toward arcane spellcasting

in fact, in the Barrens of Doom and Despair, khaastas that can

use arcane magic are almost unheard of. Normally, the khaastas

simply call upon their demonic allies to provide magic for them

when needed. The demons typically oblige such requests more

out of hatred for whatever beings the khaastas are  ghting than

any loyalty they feel toward their allies.

The war with the sarrukh, however, has caused the khaastas

to revise their way of thinking to some degree. Their strategy of

placing near-permanent settlements in Faern while raiding sar-

rukh strongholds from their home plane has created a need for

magic that allows them to move between the planes. Sessinnek

initially  provided  them  with  such  magic,  but  they  have  since

acquired a large number of magic items that allow planar travel

as well.

In  Faern,  khaasta  wizards  and  other  wielders  of  arcane

magic  are  beginning  to  appear.  But  because  the  khaastas  are

superstitious folk by nature, those who have learned to use magic

are often rejected by their tribes upon returning to their planar

homes.  This  practice  has  led  a  few  small  groups  of  khaastas

to carve out permanent homes for themselves in Faern. Such

outcasts normally  nd work in mercenary bands of other races,

but a few have discovered lizardfolk tribes and taken up residence

as their shamans.

Deities of the Khaastas

Khaastas venerate the demonic Sessinnek rather than an actual

deity.  The  worship  of  Sessinnek  has  more  to  do  with  the  ar-

rangements  previous  generations  of  khaastas  made  with  him

than  with  any  actual  respect  on  the  part  of  those  currently

living.

The khaastas are not particularly religious, which is  ne with

Sessinnek as long as they ful ll the minimum requirements he

sets forthnamely a certain number of sacri ces in his name.

The khaastas sacri ce approximately one out of ten prisoners to

Sessinnek. Clerics exist, though they do not receive their spells

from  Sessinnek,  and  their  value  is  measured  by  their  ability

to  ght and restore the wounded to health rather than by the

spiritual guidance they can provide.

On  the  other  hand,  the  khaastas  venerate  their  ancestors

almost as gods. Each khaasta learns the names and deeds of

past generations for as far back as the older clan members can

recall. Such information is passed down in the oral tradition

and never written down. Before going into battle or facing some

other trial, the khaastas call not upon the favor of Sessinnek,

but upon the blessings of their ancestors. Periodically, each clan

performs  ceremonies  of  remembrance  to  honor  the  lives  of

their ancestors.

Relations with Other Races

Despite  their  innately  vicious  nature  and  traditionally  short

tempers, the khaastas have mounted no attacks on the civilized

regions  of  Faern.  In  fact,  they  have  taken  care  to  maintain

amicable relations with all the civilized creatures they have en-

countered, so as to prevent splintering of their power through

local con icts. A few orcish tribes ousted from their territory by

the newcomers have attempted to strike back, but their attacks

have been both costly and ineffective.

Khaasta Equipment

In addition to their birth swords, khaastas prize  ne weapons

and  armor  above  all  else.  Though  khaastas  rarely  make  their

own  magic  items,  many  sport  magic  weapons  or  armor  that

they have taken from enemies or received as gifts from their

demonic allies.

Lizard Kings

Lizard  kings  (or  lizard  queens,  as  the  females  are  called)  are

half- end  lizardfolk  that  have  assumed  the  leadership  of  nu-

merous  lizardfolk  tribes  throughout  Faern.  Violent,  chaotic,

and evil, they lord their power over their subjects, driving them

to war with surrounding settlements. Most lizard kings seek to

conquer rival lizardfolk tribes and subjugate them under their

rule. Because they worship the demon Sessinnek, lizard kings

recognize  the  khaastas  as  potential  allies  and  aid  them  when

called upon.

Overview

Lizardfolk tribes under the rule of lizard kings tend to be more

advanced than those without such leaders. They typically employ

higher technology, making their weapons and armor out of steel

rather than natural materials. Such tribes generally form perma-

nent settlements complete with stone or wood dwellings, rather

than roaming the wilderness as nomads. Their tactics in combat

are also more organized, allowing them to hold formations and

use  traps  to  advantage.  Lizardfolk  under  the  leadership  of  a

lizardfolk population) were not involved in the wars, and their

societies continued as they had previously.

Description

A lizard king resembles a lizardfolk but may have any of several

demonic features, such as glowing red eyes, extra spines, extra-

long arms, long fangs, or additional scaly frills. Each individual

is different, depending on its exact heritage. Lizard king statis-

tics appear on page 68.

Racial History

Lizard kings arose in Faern when the demon Sessinnek, in an

effort to aid the khaastas in their war against the sarrukh, sent

his lesser demons to Faern to take control of as many lizardfolk

tribes as possible. The lizardfolk resisted less than Sessinnek had

predicted, caving quickly to the will of their demonic conquerors.

Some of the tribes even began to worship the demons as gods.

The demons bred with the lizardfolk for their own amusement,

killing any offspring as soon as they hatched.

Time passed, and the war between the khaastas and the sar-

rukh failed to end, so Sessinnek ordered the demons to place a

creature loyal to them in charge of each tribe and return to the

Abyss. No lizardfolk were deemed suitable for such roles, since

they  had  a  tendency  to  switch  alliances  frequently,  especially

when their allies werent nearby to remind them of their com-

mitments.  Thus,  the  demons  decided  to  allow  a  few  of  their

own half- end/half-lizardfolk offspring to live. These so-called

lizard kings were then placed in charge of the tribes that the

demons had controlled. Like their demonic parents before them,

the lizard kings interbred with the tribes under their control,

producing some offspring like themselves and some normal liz-

ardfolk children. They did not slay all their offspring outright,

however, wishing to ensure their own lines of succession.

The  lizardfolk  did  not  reject  the  lizard  kings,  and  the

tribes  under  their  control  prospered  and  became  more  ad-

vanced.  The  news  of  their  achievements  spread  to  other

tribes,  some  of  them  many  miles  away,  whose  members

became  jealous.  As  a  result,  many  lizard  king  young  were

stolen and raised to adulthood, then placed in charge of the

tribes that had fostered them. While the lizard kings didnt

mind their offspring bringing more lizardfolk under the con-

trol of Sessinnek, they sometimes lost their most promising

heirs in such raids. A period of general warfare ensued. Since

the lizardfolk tribes without lizard kings were almost never

as  advanced  as  those  with  them,  most  con icts  ended  with

the slaughter of the weaker tribe and the absorption of any

survivors by the conquering tribe.

By the time this succession of small wars ended, numerous

smaller tribes had disappeared, and the lizard kings had become

even  stronger.  The  lizardfolk  tribes  that  existed  outside  the

lizard kings spheres of in uence (more than half of Faerns

Outlook

Violent, cruel, and often despotic, lizard kings combine the worst

features of lizardfolk and demons. But although the blood of

demons  ows in their veins, they feel responsible for the tribes

entrusted to them. Their Abyssal heritage gives them the ambi-

tion, intelligence, vision, and power to bring their tribes up from

savagery and create stable, enduring civilizations. Lizard kings

rarely desert a tribe once they have ruled it, and their chaotic

natures almost never express themselves as wanderlust.

Lizard King Society

Lizard king society is inextricably entwined with that of stan-

dard lizardfolk, with some notable differences. Because of their

voracious  appetite  for  humans,  the  lizardfolk  of  their  tribes

constantly  raid  caravans  and  try  to  capture  travelers  passing

through the nearby areas. The lizard kings make every effort

to keep such raids well away from civilized regions, understand-

ing that if stories of them were to reach the human cities, the

elven settlements, and the dwarven strongholds, they and their

people would be hunted down and either forced into hiding or

destroyed outright.

In standard lizardfolk tribes, the strong use force to rule over

those weaker than themselves. Lizard kings  t into this system

very well, since their enhanced strength makes even the weakest

of their kind more powerful than the strongest adult lizardfolk.

Should the strongest lizardfolk in a tribe turn out to be more

powerful than its lizard king, the lizardfolk is nevertheless ex-

pected to support the lizard king. Should the lizardfolk attempt

to seize power, the clergy of Sessinnek and many of the elite

lizardfolk warriors wage a lopsided battle against the would-be

usurper. It is completely unheard of for a lizardfolk to defeat a

lizard king in personal combat.

Only one law unites lizard kings, and that is that each tribe

can have only one ruling lizard king and only one adult lizard

king heir. Before this law was adopted, young lizard kings not

chosen  as  heirs  sometimes  led  rebellions  that  fractured  their

tribes  and  needlessly  cost  lives,  and  others  abandoned  their

tribes, only to return and work against them later.

By their very nature, lizardfolk are more civil toward other

lizardfolk than they are toward many of the other scaly races.

Tribes under the rule of the lizard kings are no different, al-

though they tend to be more warlike. Even if they are unhappy

with the rule of a lizard king, they almost never rebel against

him. Lizardfolk are simply too easily led by strong individuals,

and  they  lack  the  power  to  organize  on  their  own  against  a

lizard king without alerting him that something is amiss.

Most  lizardfolk  from  the  outside  that  are  absorbed  into  a

tribe under the control of a lizard king are never given the same

respect as the natives. The newcomers are usually the last to eat

and the  rst to be sent to defend their settlements from intrud-

ers. The only exception is a lizardfolk warrior who has proven

his valor on the  eld of battle or performed deeds that saved

members of the tribe. Such newcomers are accorded a degree of

respect, albeit grudgingly.

Upon reaching maturity, the remaining lizard king offspring

are gathered in a Ceremony of Choosing and judged by the cur-

rent tribal ruler. The one deemed strongest and most  t to rule

is named heir; the rest are sacri ced in Sessinneks name and

consumed by the tribe. The only exception is a lizard king that

opts to become a cleric of Sessinnek rather than a tribal leader

before it reaches maturity. Despite the fact that such an option

could potentially save the lives of countless lizard kings, it

is a choice rarely made because of these creatures violent

and arrogant tendencies.

of  a  tribe  of  lizardfolk,  they

are  not  usually  suitable

Magic of the Lizard Kings

Most lizard kings use magic items that they have taken in trib-

ute from conquered tribes or won in combat. Few, however, make

their own, though tribal clerics keep the lizard kings supplied

with healing items.

Deities of the Lizard Kings

Lizard  kings  worship  the  demon  Sessinnek.  Since  most  are

not  clerics,  they  appoint  lizardfolk  within  their  tribes  as

priests and shamans to see to the spiritual needs of their peo-

ple. All members of a tribe under the control of a lizard king

must  worship  Sessinnek  and  no  other.  But  Sessinnek  needs

still more worshipers in order to ascend to true godhood, so

lizard kings do their best to increase their patrons following.

When a tribe expands because of conquest, the survivors are

offered the option of joining the conquering tribe and wor-

shiping Sessinnek, or death. Clerics from opposing faiths are

slain on sight.

Sessinnek requires regular sacri ces in his name, but little

else. Because this simple form of worship is not greatly differ-

ent from that practiced by the faithful of the World Serpent,

lizardfolk absorbed from other tribes often  nd it easy to con-

vert to the worship of Sessinnek. Those that have dif culty

making the transition are savagely beaten until their faith in-

creases. Those caught worshiping another deity after claiming

conversion are sacri ced.

The compulsion for lizard kings to eat the  esh of creatures

from the Material Plane is supported by religious ceremony.

Twice a week, the lizard king holds a late-night ceremony in

which a prisoner is brought to a dais in the temple. The victim

is  rmly secured and kept conscious throughout the ceremo-

ny. The clerics lead the tribe in a prayer to Sessinnek. While

the lizardfolk continue to chant and pray, the victims heart

is  cleaved  from  its  chest  and  presented,  still  beating,  to  the

lizard king, who promptly eats it. The clerics then divide up

the corpse, presenting the largest portion to the lizard king

for consumption.

Lizardfolk with a bent toward divine magic often become

druids. While druidic lizardfolk are not forbidden, lizard kings

strongly encourage devotion to Sessinnek. Thus, lizardfolk that

pursue a druidic path are usually shoehorned into the clergy of

Sessinnek, and their divergent abilities are explained to the rest

of the lizardfolk as following a different path of faith. In

truth, they venerate their own deities to the same extent as the

rest of the lizardfolk venerate Sessinnek, but they remain with

the clergy to gain the support of the king. Lizardfolk druids

that speak out against this arti cial structure are challenged

by the lizard king and the clergy of Sessinnek, then quickly

subdued, sacri ced, and eaten.

Relations with Other Races

Lizard kings see humans, elves, dwarves, and other humanoids

as  food,  not  as  allies  or  neighbors.  Most  scaly  creatures  are

also  not  welcomed  as  allies  by  tribes  under  the  rule  of  the

lizard kings. Because lizard kings dont worship any aspect of

the World Serpent, they consider any creatures that do so as

enemies  of  the  tribe.  Khaastas,  who  also  worship  Sessinnek,

are viewed as elite soldiers  ghting for the same cause. Lizard

kings  may  also  permit  trade  with   renewts,  and  short-term

alliances may form between the two races to deal with threats

from other species. But lizard kings fear the  renewts elemen-

tal nature, so they keep such allies well away from combustible

items and structures.

Lizard King Equipment

Lizard kings always use the  nest equipment available, usually

of masterwork quality or better.

Troglodytes and Trens

Troglodytes and trens are similar creatures that inhabit the same

environments and often live together in the same  settlements.

Both prefer cold, moist areas deep underground.

Overview

The  sarrukh  of  Mhairshaulk  created  troglodytes  to  explore

subterranean  areas  and  guard  their  underground  strongholds

against incursions by Underdark races. The trens were the magi-

cally enhanced results of yuan-ti breeding experiments between

troglodytes and lizardfolk that took place long after the fall of

the sarrukh.

Both races regularly attack creatures passing through their

territories. The trens  ght in the front lines, keeping their op-

ponents occupied, while the troglodytes throw javelins from a

distance or employ other ranged weapons.

Troglodytes encountered without trens usually prepare am-

bushes for their foes. Their front ranks attack with clubs, while

the others move in to  ank opponents and attack with natural

weapons. Meanwhile, troglodyte javelin throwers attempt to hit

any enemies who try to use magic.

Trens  encountered  without  troglodytes  usually  prefer  to

make  a  frontal  attack  against  their  enemies  with  martial

weapons,  while  archers  behind  their  own  lines  take  aim  at

whichever opponents seem easiest to hit.

Description

The two races are physically very similar, though the trens tend

to be stronger, more imposing, and less intelligent. A troglodyte

is  shorter  than  a  typical  human  and  has  long  arms.  It  walks

erect on squat legs and has a long, narrow tail that it uses for

creatures  for  favors  and  magic.  Ultimately,  the  trens  odor

proved too offensive to their new masters, so almost all were

set free. The yuan-ti also kept a large number of the trens,

which still serve them.

The trens that had been released from service formed mer-

cenary groups, many of which set out in search of troglodytes

to serve. The troglodytes were initially suspicious, but when it

became apparent that the trens would be willing to follow trog-

lodyte leaders and not attempt to take control of

settlements, they were welcomed and fully

incorporated  into  many  troglodyte

communities.

Outlook

Both  troglodytes  and  trens  perceive  the

world  as  a  cold  and  hostile  place   lled

with creatures that are bent on destroy-

ing them. This viewpoint is not entirely

incorrect, since they are hated by both

good-  and  evil-aligned  creatures  be-

cause of their senseless attacks. The only

race  that  seems  to  have  a  use  for  either

of them is the yuan-ti, and the vrael olo

generally prefer the trens because they are

more capable in battle. Rejected by nearly

every other creature because of their rela-

tive weakness and overpowering stench, the

troglodytes take comfort in isolation and

try  to  destroy  any  other  intelligent

creatures within their reach.

Because  both  the  troglodytes  and  the

trens have been servitor races in the past,

they  prefer  to  follow  the  most  powerful

creature  that  wishes  to  rule  them.  Since

most  other  creatures  avoid  them,  their

Troglodyte cleric

and tren monk

leaders are usually the strongest among their own kind.

Troglodyte and Tren Society

A troglodyte tribe follows the most powerful individualmale

or female. This chieftain appoints the next most powerful war-

riors as subchiefs, who in turn lead bands of warriors on raids.

The chieftain rules the tribe until either she is slain in battle

or her health declines to a point where she can no longer  ght

effectively.  At  that  time,  the  tribe  selects  a  new  leader,  often

discarding all the old subchiefs in favor of younger warriors who

have recently proven themselves in battle.

Noncombatants  are  few  in  troglodyte  society.  The  females

battle alongside the males and are no less ferocious. The young

join raiding parties consisting of twenty to thirty troglodytes

as soon as they are able to hold weapons. Each tribe, however,

does have designated hunters and gatherers. These troglodytes

balance.  A  tren  is  slightly  larger  than  a  troglodyte  but  more

muscular. Its tail is longer and wider than a troglodytes, and its

limbs are more proportionate to its body. Troglodyte statistics

appear on page 246 of the Monster Manual; tren statistics are

provided on page 87.

Racial History

The  sarrukh  of  Mhairshaulk  originally  used  troglodytes  to

explore  the  region  of  the  Underdark  now  called  the

Serpent Deeps. These agents brought back useful

reports  on  the  civilizations  of  aboleths,  il-

lithids,  and  other  creatures  that  could

potentially  pose  a  threat  to  the  sar-

rukh.  Alarmed  at  this  information,

the sarrukh sent the troglodytes deep

underground  to  act  as  sentries  and

warn them should any major invasions

forces appear.

The  denizens  of  the  Underdark  were

eventually  dismissed  as  minor  threats,

since they proved unable to cooperate in

large enough groups to mount a reason-

able  offense  against  the  sarrukh.  A  few

attempts were made to claim sarrukh

territory, but they all failed thanks to

the troglodytes early warnings.

When  the  sarrukh  empire   nally

fell, the troglodytes disappeared from

Mhairshaulk  into  the  depths  below.

From  there,  they  spread  throughout

most  of  Faern,  establishing  settlements

near  underground  water  sources  where  they  could  prey

on the various wild creatures that lived in the Underdark.

Their settlements prospered to such an extent that troglo-

dytes eventually ranked among the most common creatures

in the Underdark.

When the yuan-ti rose to prominence under the leadership

of Sseth, they sought a servitor race to aid them in becoming

the new masters of Faern. Many groups of troglodytes were

rounded up and forced to serve in the armies of Serpentes.

Soon, however, it became clear that although the troglodytes

had been successful in the Underdark, their physical power

left  much  to  be  desired.  Thus,  the  yuan-ti  decided  to  try

altering them. The sarrukh magic that had allowed the trans-

formation of scaly creatures into other forms had long since

been lost, so the yuan-ti bred the strongest troglodytes with

the most powerful lizardfolk and treated the eggs daily with

the bulls strength spell. The result was the tren, a creature

more physically powerful but less intelligent than either of

its parent races.

The yuan-ti used the trens to defend and expand Serpen-

tes. After its fall, many trens were traded to other powerful

45

LIZARDS

rarely engage in combat on the front lines. Instead, they track

prey through the Underdark, lead packs of warriors on hunting

expeditions, or bring their tribes food when they are not engaged

in a raid.

Troglodyte lairs are normally caves or underground cav-

erns  with  multiple  chambers  in  which  the  troglodytes  can

move about freely. Most are normally  lled with all manner

of waste and  lth, and many feature standing bodies of brack-

ish water. Troglodytes other than the chieftain dont call any

part of the lair home, and they make a practice of bedding

down in a different room, surrounded by different troglodytes,

every night.

RELATIONSHIPS

Troglodytes remain with their mates as long as both are alive,

but  they  take  new  ones  when  widoweda  state  that  occurs

frequently.  Troglodytes  and  trens  can  interbreed  freely  and

with no stigma attached. Close friendships between individuals

are rare, but each troglodyte treats all members of its tribe

as family.

LIFE CYCLE

After a female troglodyte lays her eggs, they are secured inside a

leather mesh net and placed in the tribes waterway to incubate.

A day or two before a clutch of eggs is due to hatch, the trog-

lodytes remove them from the water to dry, so that their shells

become brittle enough for the young to break.

When troglodytes interbreed with trens, each offspring has

an  equal  chance  to  be  of  either  race.  The  tren  offspring  are

separated  from  the  troglodytes  immediately  to  prevent  them

from inadvertently injuring the growing troglodytes with their

greater strength.

Both  tren  and  troglodyte  young  are  raised  by  the  entire

tribe rather than by their biological parents. The young can

walk and hold weapons at two years of age. From that point

until they reach maturity, they are given practice weapons and

encouraged  to   ght  one  another.  When  they  become  older,

they are given steel weapons and sent on hunting expeditions

with the tribal hunters.

Most troglodytes eventually die in combat. Those who dont

are considered tribal elders and are valued for the wisdom they

are assumed to have accumulated over the years. One such elder

is usually chosen to offer advice to the chieftain.

FUNEREAL CUSTOMS

After each battle, the troglodytes gather their dead for a  nal

blessing from the tribes clerics. Afterward, the corpses are eaten

in a ceremony called as The Renewal in which the meat of the

deceased is returned to the tribe.

Troglodyte and

Tren Characters

Troglodytes and trens make interesting characters. Not only do

their odors offend the senses of even the most accepting of the

other  races,  but  their  penchant  for  eating  their  slain  victims

can be revolting to civilized races as well. Nevertheless, some

characters  are  willing  to  accept  them  in  adventuring  parties.

They may feel that the bene ts of the odor outweigh the nega-

tive aspects of traveling with such a foul-smelling creature, or

they may simply have no sense of smell.

Troglodytes most often advance in the cleric class, though

many choose to be  ghters. Their penalties to Intelligence and

Dexterity do not automatically preclude rogue or wizard char-

acters,  but  culture  and  a  lack  of  exposure  to  those  character

classes ensure that most troglodytes do not take levels in them.

Troglodytes separated from their subterranean settlements are

often interested in the new types of creatures they meet, so they

choose to go down alternate paths.

Trens are most commonly barbarians or monks, though they

too can take other classes if they wish. The wizard class is a dif -

cult option for a tren because of its 4 penalty to Intelligence.

Magic of the

Troglodytes and Trens

Members of these two races rarely learn arcane magic, and even

clerics are somewhat rare. Thus, troglodytes and trens have never

developed any new spells or magic items of their own.

Deities of the

Troglodytes and Trens

Since troglodytes were originally created by the sarrukh, they

initially worshiped an aspect of the World Serpent. After the fall

of the sarrukh empires, they shifted their worship to the bloated

Laogzed. This foul deity, believed to be part demon, exists solely

to  consume  foodnamely,  anything  made  of   esh  and  blood

that can be ingested. Laogzed prefers to swallow his food alive,

so that he can feel it move as he digests it.

The  love  of  food  pervades  the  worship  of  Laogzed,  and

every  occasion  is  cause  for  a  feast.  After  a  victory,  the  trog-

lodytes  feast  upon  the  corpses  of  their  enemies.  In  order  to

hold great feasts as often as possible, they often overhunt the

creatures in the surrounding areas, thus depleting their regular

sources of food.

Clerics are useful to the troglodytes because they are capa-

ble of dealing out damage in combat and can heal themselves

when wounded. With the low standards for worship Laogzed

imposes  on  his  followers,  the  troglodytes   nd  it  remarkably

easy to be religious.

46

620_96566_SerpentKing32-53.indd   46

5/12/04, 2:55:11 PM

LIZARDS

Trens  seldom  choose  to  become  clerics,  since  they  gener-

ally prefer combat-oriented roles. Thus, in purely tren tribes,

clerics  are  considered  valuable  and  irreplaceable.  For  that

reason,  tren  clerics  are  kept  from  combat  most  of  the  time

and given less dangerous duties, such as guarding the eggs and

preparing food. Because of the limited role they are allowed

to play in tren settlements, they tend to advance more slowly

than the warriors. Thus, they can provide less healing for the

wounded combatants returning from a battle than the clerics

of a   troglodyte tribe.

Other than feasting, the deity requires little

from his worshipers. Unlike many of the evil

deities,  Laogzed  does  not  require  sacri ces,

although he does not reject them either. Troglo-

dytes believe that every time they eat, they

are sending the consumed food to Laogzed,

who enjoys it again. By this dogma, the

very act of eating is a religious ritual.

Laogzed grants them spells in return

for their worship and the constant

feasts they provide for him.

Trens  that  are  on  their  own

tend  to  be  godless.  They  may

know  of  Laogzed,  but  they

feel  no  compulsion  to  worship

him.  Trens  under  the  control

of  the  yuan-ti  give  their  wor-

ship  to  whichever  deity  their

masters  require.

Relations

with Other Races

As evil as their progenitors, troglodytes and trens attack

any creature entering their territory, and they often raid

settlements of other nearby creatures without provoca-

tion, either to gain supplies or out of pure aggression. Troglodytes

dont question their leaders motives when ordered to attack their

neighbors, they simply do as they are commanded.

Troglodyte and Tren

Equipment

Troglodytes are obsessed with steel. Since they lack the technical

understanding  necessary  to  forge  weapons,  they  often  mount

expeditions to pillage steel armor and weapons from various Un-

derdark ruins. They also gain steel from raiding neighbors who

do have the technology to forge steel. Steel weapons and armor

gained  from  such  expeditions  are  given  to  the  most  powerful

warriors  rst, so the less-accomplished members of a tribe are

the last to get good-quality gear.

Though  trens  have  the  same  instinctual  lust  for  steel,  the

only items they keep are steel greatswords. The rest they happily

turn over to the troglodytes.

Lizard Race

Encounters

Player  characters  can  encounter  members  of  the  lizard  races

individually  or  in  groups  almost  anywhere,  often  sup-

ported  by  small  groups  of  followers.

Most  settlements  are  found  in

remote locations, though some can

be  surprisingly  close  to  humanoid

communities.

Ready-to-Use

Villains

and Allies

The  lizard  races  often  pursue  prestige

classes  of  various  kinds,  particularly

those that enhance their combat ability.

The following  renewt character can be

woven  into  adventures  or  encountered

individually.

CHASSAN

Chassan is the leader of the Ackta tribe of

 renewts in the Peaks of Flame. During the

Time of Troubles, Chassan served as Kossuths

avatar.  The  Flamelords  divine  essence  was  too

much for his mortal form, and all that was left of the

 renewt after the gods departure was a blackened husk.

After Kossuth returned to the Elemental Plane of Fire,

however, he transformed the charred remains of Chassan

into a death ame. (The death ame template is the same as the

death knight template, except that it can be applied to monstrous

humanoids.) Now Chassan is the overlord of his tribe, but by

Kossuths decree, the clerics are also answerable to him.

Following  his  transformation  into  a  death ame,  Chassan

called for a war against the other nearby tribes inhabiting the

Peaks  of  Flame.  While  war  is  not  uncommon  between  tribes

of   renewts,  Chassan  easily  conquered  all  the  tribes  within  a

100-mile  radius  by  following  a  series  of  complex  battle  plans

laid out by Kossuth himself. Rather than putting the conquered

 renewts to the sword, as was customary, Chassan instead gave

them a choicejoin his tribe or die. Three-quarters of the con-

quered  renewts chose to join, expanding his tribe signi cantly.

Now Chassan is making plans to march to Mezro and conquer

it in Kossuths name.

LIZARDS

Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 10 minutes, Chassan can

breathe  re on an opponent within 5 feet. This attack deals 1d6

points of  re damage (Re ex DC 11 half).

Command  Undead  (Su):  Chassan  commands  undead  as  a

6th-level evil cleric.

Poison Use (Ex): Chassan is skilled in the use of poison and

never risks accidentally poisoning himself when applying poison

to a blade.

Smite Good (Su): Chassan may attempt to smite good with

one normal melee attack. He adds +1 to his attack roll and deals

8 extra points of damage. Smiting a creature that is not good

has no effect but uses up the ability for that day.

Touch Attack: Chassan deals 1d8+1 points of damage plus 1

point of Constitution damage with a successful touch attack. A

successful DC 19 Will save halves the damage and negates the

Constitution damage.

Aura of Despair (Su): Chassan radiates a malign aura that

causes every enemy within 10 feet of him to take a 2 morale

penalty on all saving throws.

Aura of Evil (Ex): Chassan radiates a strong aura of evil.

Dark  Blessing:  Chassan  applies  his  Charisma  bonus  to  all

saving throws (already  gured into the statistics given above).

Detect  Good  (Sp):  Chassan  can  use  detect  good  at  will  as

the spell.

Fiendish Servant: Chassan does not presently have a  endish

servant.

Summon  Mount  (Su):  Chassan  can  summon  a  mount

(typically a nightmare) with up to 8 HD.

Turn Immunity (Ex): Chassan cannot be turned, though he

can be banished with a holy word as if he were an evil outsider.

Undead  Followers:  Chassan  has  34  Hit  Dice  worth  of

skeletons, ghouls, ghasts, wights, and zombies as followers.

Undead  Traits:  Chassan  is  immune  to  mind-in uencing

effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects or is harmless. He is not subject to critical

hits,  nonlethal  damage,  ability  damage  to  his  physical  ability

scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from  massive  damage.  He  cannot  be  raised,  and  resurrection

works only if he is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.

Blackguard  Spells  Prepared  (3/2/2/1;  save  DC  13  +  spell

level):  1stcause  fear,  cure  light  wounds,  doom;  2ndbulls

strength, darkness; 3rdcontagion, cure serious wounds; 4th

in ict critical wounds.

Possessions: +3 chainmail, heavy steel shield, +5  aming burst

unholy longsword, +5 longbow, 50 arrows.

Currently, there is growing uncertainty within the combined

 renewt tribe about Chassans ability to lead them because of

his  status  as  a  death ame  and  his  long-term  plans,  which  he

has failed to explain to them. Many of the  ghters would like

to band together against him, but they have seen him in battle

and doubt that they have the power to destroy him. Worse yet,

the clerics fully support Chassan, so his rivals cannot count on

any magical support within the tribe.

Those opposed to Chassan have begun secretly enlisting help

from outside the tribe, though doing so has not been easy. Most

races of Chult know about the brutality of the  renewts and

want nothing to do with them on any level. Others agree to

help, but require a price so high that only the tribes gold statue

of Kossuth would be suf cient to pay them.

Chassan is aware of the plots against him, but he remains

unconcerned. He knows that he is supported by his clerics and

most of his army, and that he would stand a good chance of

winning a battle against the entire tribe, if necessary. Chas-

san  would  be  happy  to  execute  those  who  plot  against  him

right now, but he has stayed his hand so far because he is sure

that they will reveal themselves to the rest of the tribe soon

enough. At that time, he can execute them without the risk of

making them martyrs.

The  races  known  as  the  hidden  folk  exist  outside

ordinary society in the Serpent Kingdoms and can

pose serious threats to neighboring creatures. The

one common feature of the Hidden Folk, aside from their Scaled

Ones designation, is the fact that they do not wish to be found.

Ophidians

Most often servants of nagas or yuan-ti, ophidians exist wher-

ever their masters are. Many dwell in the Serpent Hills, serving

their yuan-ti masters; others live in isolated southern regions in

the service of nagas and other Scaled Ones.

Overview

Once  human  Netherese  servants

of  House  Orogoth,  ophidians  re-

tain no hint of their humanity and

no  aspirations  to  a  lifestyle  other

than  servitude.  They  are  happy

to carry out the orders of more

powerful serpentfolk, includ-

ing dark nagas, spirit nagas,

and  yuan-ti.  Ophidians  al-

most  never  act  independently  of

their masters.

Ophidians

Description

An  ophidian  has  a  wide,  serpentine  torso  with  short,

stubby legs and humanoid arms ending in clawed hands. Its head

is  lizardlike,  and  its  tail  is  short  in  proportion  to  its  body.  It

walks upright and can climb in a sort of half-slither, like a snake.

Its scales are typically mottled green and yellow, with brown,

black, and red also appearing in some individuals. An ophidians

scales change color to help it blend into wooded or subterranean

surroundings. Ophidian statistics appear in the Fiend Folio.

Racial History

Ophidians  date  back  to  the  Sil-

ver  Age  of  Netheril,  when  the

wizards  of  House  Orogoth  in-

advertently  unleashed  the  Serpent

Curse  on  their  servants.  After  centu-

ries of dragon worship, the

savage ophidian tribes

of  the  High  Moor

and  the  Serpent  Hills

migrated to the Forest of Wyrms and

discovered the ruined sarrukh city of

Ssthartissssun. Under the guidance

of a ha-naga king and its sum-

moned  yuan-ti  nobility,  the

ophidians  established  Najara,

the  Kingdom  of  Snakes,  after

the fall of Netheril.

When Najara fell to the Shadowk-

ing  of  Ebenfar  in  the  Year  of  Moor

Birds  (90  DR),  most  of  the  surviving  ser-

pentfolk  ed north into the Serpent Hills to rebuild

their realm. The Kingdom of Snakes reemerged, based in

the Serpent Hills and ruled by its  rst dark naga king, in the

Year of the Prowling Naga (142 DR). During the centuries that

followed, the power of the serpentfolk grew slowly in the face

of hostility from the Scaleless Onesin particular, the Shoon

Imperium, the Kingdom of Cormyr, the Tri-Crowned Kingdom

of Phalorm, the Kingdom of Delimbiyran, and the  Principality

of Boareskyr.

HIDDEN FOLK

Although  most  ophidian  tribes  migrated  north  into  the

Serpent  Hills  after  the  fall  of  Najara,  some   ed  to  warmer

lands  to  the  south.  Most  of  their  descendants  now  dwell  in

isolated southern wilderness regions, often led by a handful of

powerful nagas.

Outlook

Ophidians perceive the world as a pairing of masters and slaves,

and they happily assume the latter role. An ophidian considers

it  a  privilege  to  carry  out  any  order  from  a  more  powerful

serpentfolk, whether that master is cruel or kind.

Ophidian Society

Ophidians have little in the way of society. They live to serve

the yuan-ti and never worry about building their own culture.

Ophidians  perform  much  of  the  unpleasant  labor  for  the

yuan-ti,  and  they  serve  on  the  front  lines  whenever  danger

from the outside threatens their masters.

Ophidians that lose their yuan-ti masters immediately seek

some other powerful Scaled One to serve. Should such a master

not  be  immediately  available,  they  simply  wander  aimlessly,

 ghting with one another and any other creatures they happen

to encounter.

RELATIONSHIPS

Yuan-ti often select mates for their ophidian slaves as part of

breeding programs to improve the race. Ophidians feel no special

bond to mates or peers within their own race; their strongest

bond is to the one they serve.

LIFE CYCLE

Ophidian  females  lay  their  eggs  in  any  convenient  place  and

then  abandon  them.  No  ophidian,  male  or  female,  feels  any

connection to its young, or indeed any need to care for them

unless so ordered.

When  the  young  ophidians  hatch,  they  swarm  aimlessly

in search of food until an older ophidian or other serpentfolk

gives them direction. Ophidians are raised in servitude, receiv-

ing  ever  more  complex  orders  in  keeping  with  their  age  and

physical power.

Ophidian Characters

Ophidian  characters  are  extremely  rare,  since  these  creatures

devote  their  lives  to  servitude  rather  than  self-improvement.

However,  an  ophidian  might  join  an  evil  party  if  it  can  be

convinced that at least one party member is a suitable master.

Magic of the Ophidians

Despite  the  magic  that  spawned  their  race,  ophidians  have

neither  talent  for  nor  interest  in  magic.  They  rarely  become

spellcasters, since doing so represents not only a degree of ambi-

tion that is almost unknown in their race but also a talent for

judging the best use of power.

Deities of the Ophidians

Like many other slave races, ophidians worship whatever deities

their masters tell them to. Masterless ophidians sometimes wor-

ship nagas, dragons, or other powerful reptiles.

Relations with Other Races

Ophidians are malicious creatures that delight in the torture and

destruction of other races. Despite their innate cruelty, they are

fawning and servile in dealings with more powerful Scaled Ones.

Ophidian Equipment

Ophidians  use  whatever  equipment  their  masters  provide,  but

they  make  none  of  their  own.  Masterless  ophidians  often  use

scavenged weapons.

Pterafolk

Created by the sarrukh of Mhairshaulk, pterafolk have always

lived almost exclusively on the Chultan Peninsula.

Overview

These violent and primitive lizardkin live in loosely organized

tribal  communities.  The  tendency  for  each  pterafolk  to  place

her own needs above those of the others results in a confused

and often violent society in which the strong feel free to tread

upon the weak.

Description

A pterafolk resembles a larger-than-normal lizardfolk with no

tail. Its small, smooth scales range in color from olive green to

shades of tan. Its hands and feet are long and thin, ending in

sharp talons. Ordinarily it does not have wings, but when it has

need of  ight, it can either turn its arms into leathery wings or

assume the form of a pteranodon. Pterafolk statistics appear in

Monsters of Faern.

Racial History

The sarrukh of Mhairshaulk used the lizardfolk as the base crea-

ture for creating the pterafolk. They gave their new creations

 ight and the ability to shift forms to improve their versatility

in combat. They also made the pterafolk more aggressive than

standard lizardfolk in order to make them more eager warriors.

But while this alteration did indeed produce more effective kill-

ers, it also made them dif cult to manage. When added to the

armies of Mhairshaulk, pterafolk units enhanced their killing

ability at the cost of poorer control.

HIDDEN FOLK

LIFE CYCLE

A pterafolk female lays her eggs on a high mountain peak within

her own clans territory, and both parents tend them until they

hatch. As soon as the young are capable of  nding their own

food, the parents introduce them to their clan.

Most pterafolk die in battle. Their corpses are looted by their

own clans and then left to rot where they fall, since there is no

bene t to any individual in elaborate funereal customs.

ORGANIZATION

A pterafolk tribe is usually led by a spirit naga chieftain. The

pterafolk take their requests and disputes to the spirit naga, who

is expected to have the wisdom or raw might to satisfy everyone.

But the chieftains, who are normally more interested in satisfy-

ing  their  own  desires,  make  alliances  with  the  pterafolk  who

can best help them do so and ignore the requests of others. A

pterafolk clan that feels slighted by the chieftain may attempt

to kill it and replace it with a more responsive one. Laws exist

at the discretion of the spirit naga chieftain and are enforced by

the individual who has been wronged.

The criteria used to measure the power of each clan include

established loyalties,  ghting prowess, size, and possessions. Of

these, loyalties tend to be the most important. Several families

within a tribe may form an alliance, agreeing to help one another

promote their own interests. Such alliances may focus on the res-

olution of internal dif culties, or they may simply be agreements

to help one another in raids. In the latter case, the agreement

The pterafolk stayed primarily under the control of the sar-

rukh until the fall of Mhairshaulk. At that time, many of the

races that had opposed the sarrukh made an effort to track down

and destroy all the pterafolk settlements, thus forging an enmity

that has lasted for tens of thousands of years.

Outlook

Pterafolk rarely play major roles in the con icts of Faern for

two reasonsthey are almost completely unable to trust anyone

who approaches them with offers of work, and they are too ag-

gressive (even toward one another) to work effectively in groups.

For the most part, the natives of Chult regard them as simply

one of many threats to society. The one notable exception oc-

curred when Kaverin Ebonhand assaulted the Chultan city of

Mezro in the Year of the Wyvern (DR 1363). Ebonhand some-

how managed to enlist several dozen pterafolk into his army,

and  they  fought   ercely  against  the  inhabitants  of  the  city.

When  their  human  commander  was  slain  in  battle,  however,

they disbanded and  ed.

Pterafolk Society

Pterafolk dont function as a group unless they are conducting

raids or engaging in other activities that bene t individuals at

least as much as the whole group. Within a tribe, pterafolk are

separated into clans, each of which normally consists of imme-

diate family members. Often, clans are interrelated to such an

extent that a tribe is nothing more than an extended clan.

RELATIONSHIPS

Most pterafolk are loyal to their immediate families and to

other clans with which they have forged alliances, but not

to anyone else. Betrayal and in ghting are common within

the greater pterafolk society.

Pterafolk

HIDDEN FOLK

normally includes a de ned method (though not necessarily an

equitable one) for splitting the spoils. Clans that have established

numerous  links  with  other  individuals  and  clans  within  their

tribes are considered powerful but not always trustworthy.

Fighting prowess varies from one clan to another. Some clans

care little for combat training and prefer to  ght by instinct.

Others are more organized, requiring their members to undergo

regimented combat training. Members of such clans normally

have levels of   ghter,  barbarian, or ranger.

The size of a pterafolk clan factors into its overall standing

centers around the belief that the ultimate agents of creation

are those of destruction and chaos. Because these forces are con-

stantly at work within their society, the pterafolk  nd it easy to

worship this deity.

While the spirit naga chieftains form the religious focus of

their society, the pterafolk themselves spend little time in wor-

ship. Instead, they act as agents of Shekinesters will, sewing the

seeds of destruction wherever they happens to be. The pterafolk

often pray only before or during a battle or raid, or on the rare

occasions that they seek divine intervention, which their

because a clan with numerous members has the raw

power to overwhelm others that are competing

for the same resources. Pterafolk often  ght

amongst themselves, and whether or not an

outright battle begins is often determined

by one clans ability to stand against an-

other. Possessions include the territory

the clan has staked for itself, as well as

equipment and structures.

Pterafolk

Characters

A pterafolk may join an adventuring party if

its goals happen to match those of the group. Such

alliances  are  normally  short-lived,  ending  either  when

the  pterafolk  has  made  enemies  within  the  group,  or  when

everyones objectives are realized and they part ways. Pterafolk

that  are  raised  by  races  other  than  their  own  sometimes

overcome  their  natural  penchant  for  violence  and  adopt

alignments  other  than  evil.  Such  situation  are  rare,

however, since pterafolk are almost never trusted by hu-

manoid civilizations and are usually driven off or slain

in the same way that other hostile invaders would be.

Magic of the Pterafolk

Pterafolk  dont  trust  magic,  so  only  a  rare  few  ever  become

spellcasters  of  any  kind.  Divine  spellcasters  are  somewhat

more  common  than  arcane  ones,  since  spirit  naga  chieftains

sometimes take on pterafolk students, whom they later place in

positions of prominence.

This general distrust of magic gives rise to a hatred of arcane

magic items among the pterafolk. Given the chance, pterafolk

steal such items and destroy them at their earliest convenience.

Unlike the dragonkin, however, the pterafolk are not innately

compelled to seek magic items.

Deities of the Pterafolk

Like most of the scaly races of Faern, the pterafolk original-

ly worshiped the World Serpent. When that deity fragmented,

they transferred their worship to Shekinester, the deity of their

spirit naga chieftains. For the pterafolk, worship of Shekinester

Relations with

Other Races

The pterafolk pose a serious threat to

all the major races surrounding their

settlements,  including  humans  and

batiri  (goblins).  They  regularly  con-

duct  raids  on  the  villages  and  towns

of  Chult  and  assault  supply  caravans

and  travelers  passing  through  the  area.

The  nearby  settlements  have  grown

weary of pterafolk raids and are cur-

rently working to  nd the creatures

strongholds in order to chase them

out of their territory.

Pterafolk

Equipment

Pterafolk prefer armor that

does not cover their arms and equipment

that  can  easily  be  carried  on  a  bandolier,  so

that  they  can  transport  it  while  in  pteranodon

form. They often make their own weapons and armor to ensure

that it meets their needs.

Hidden Folk Encounters

Player characters can encounter hidden folk individually or in

groups almost anywhere. Ophidians are nearly always in service

to more powerful creatures, but pterafolk may be encountered

in warbands or as individuals.

Ready-to-Use Villain

The  hidden  folk  have  access  to  most  of  the  same  classes  as

humanoid characters. The following pterafolk character can be

encountered alone or with his tribe.

KRRZAALT

Krrzaalt is the chieftain and spiritual leader of the Kronikl

tribe of pterafolk. Following the untimely death of its spirit naga

HIDDEN FOLK

chieftain at the hands of adventurers, the tribe was in shambles.

Krrzaalt, who had been taught the dogma of Shekinester by

the old chieftain, decided to assume control of the tribe when no

other leaders emerged.

Several  months  after  he  appointed  himself  chieftain,  the

tribe  encountered  a  group  of  spirit  nagas  on  their  way  to  a

meeting known as the Great Conclave. They invited Krrzaalt

to attend, and he accepted. At the end of the conclave, he was

deemed worthy to lead his tribe.

Krrzaalt now regularly attends the Great Conclave and is

the only pterafolk there. Many of the spirit nagas are not happy

with this arrangement, and some have been plotting to assume

control of the Kronikl tribe. Krrzaalt is aware of these plots,

but he does not know that some of his own people are conspiring

to overthrow him.

VASSK

served  Sasyk  Vatoros,  a  pureblood  yuan-ti  wizard  working  for

House Eselemas in Lushpool. However, Sasyk was caught trad-

ing magical secrets to House SeSehen and  ed Lushpool with

his belongings and Vassk in tow. Assassins sent by the Eselemaa

caught up with Sasyk and Vassk near Hlondeth. They managed

to kill Sasyk before Vassk chased them off. Now, Vassk wanders

the land in search of a new masterpreferably another yuan-ti,

Its skin grows scaly, its legs begin to shrink and fuse together,

and its tongue becomes forked. After two weeks, the victim is

fully  transformed  into  an  ophidian,  with  no  memory  of  its

previous existence. To stop the transformation, the victim must

receive a remove disease or remove curse spell before the process

One  of  the   ve  original  progenitor  races

(also  called  creator  races)  of  Faern,  the

sarrukh  built  and  maintained  empires

across most of the continent in the distant past. These ancient,

evil creatures are now all but gone, and even the name of their

race has long been lost to the ages. Most sages who know of their

past glory refer to them simply as the saurians, or the progeni-

tors of the Scaled Ones.

The sarrukh have, however, left a lasting legacy: the racial

diversity of Faerns scaled races. It was the sarrukh who took

the  scaly  animals  and  monsters  native  to  Toril  and  modi ed

them  into  sentient  beings  such  as  yuan-ti,  nagas,  pterafolk,

and others.

Overview

At one time, the sarrukh dominated all of Faern. Their mighty

empiresthe  rst in the worldencompassed the jungles along

the shore of Azulduth, the eastern shore of the Narrow Sea, and

the Chultan Peninsula. The sarrukh enslaved or sacri ced other

creatures in the name of their god, the World Serpent.

Eventually, problems of their own making caused the sar-

rukh empires to crumble. In the vacuum created by the fall

of the sarrukh, their created races rose to prominence, estab-

lishing power centers of their ownmany of which are still

active today. Amazingly, however, the sarrukh have managed

to remain relevant even in modern-day Faern. Despite their

small  numbers,  they  can  still  command  the  loyalty  of  the

races they once created. But an immense rift has opened up

between the surviving sarrukh clans, and the enmity among

them  could  lead  to  a  period  of  open  warfare  between  the

scaled races.

Description

Sarrukh bodies come in two shapes: bipedal and snakelike. The

latter  resemble  certain  yuan-ti  abominations,  with  snakelike

bodies and heads as well as powerful arms that end in vicious

claws. The bipedal sort has a humanoid upper torso, humanoid

arms  and  legs,  and  a  snakelike  lower  body.  All  sarrukh  have

distinctive, gleaming red eyes that strike fear into the hearts of

all the scaly races.

Racial History

The   rst  signi cant  civilizations  of  Toril  were  the  empires

of the sarrukh, which rose and fell between 35,000 DR and

33,500 DR. This race of intelligent scaled creatures  rst ap-

peared in the area known as Okoth, south of Mulhorand. The

development of the sarrukh was relatively uncontested in their

homeland, and their population quickly surpassed the level sus-

tainable by the local resources. Thus, the sarrukh were forced to

expand. They spread rapidly throughout much of Faern, con-

quering other lands and sowing the seeds for civilization as they

went. They encountered short-lived and disorganized resistance

from the savages that inhabited the lands, but the fact that the

sarrukh had already learned to smelt iron for steel weapons and

armor made them virtually invincible. Within a hundred years,

most of Faern was theirs.

The  Mhairshaulk  Empire  arose  in  34,800  DR  on  the

Chultan  peninsula,  and  the  Isstossef  l  Empire  followed  in

34,500 DR, based in what is now the Great Desert of Anau-

roch. Okoth, the  rst of the sarrukh empires, still encompassed

the races original homeland. Lesser realms, including the city

of Ssthartissssun (in what is now the Forest of Wyrms) and

the city of Ilimar (which is split between the Great Swamp of

Rethild and the Gulthmere Forest) sprang up outside of these

SARRUKH

two great empires. These regions constituted the major hubs of

sarrukh civilization, and the  rst stable portals in Faern were

created to connect them.

As  the  sarrukh  spread  out,  they  discovered  that  the  sha-

mans  of  the  chaotic  races  living  in  certain  wilderness  areas

held  magical  lore  that  they  had  not  yet  encountered.  After

studying these primitive forms of magic, the sarrukh consoli-

dated their discoveries into a series of tomes. Upon completion,

the books where brought to Oreme, the capitol of Isstossef  l,

for study. The most magically gifted among the sarrukh and

their servitor races pored over these tomes, which contained

both easily researched magical knowledge and obscure infor-

mation. The empires of the sarrukh didnt last long enough to

gather the full fruits of their work, but this collection of minds

eventually  grew  into  its  own  secret  organization,  which  was

called  the  Baetith.  The  members  of  this  group  consolidated

and extrapolated the bounds of their newly found knowledge,

penning  the  Golden  Skins  of  the  World  Serpent  (otherwise

known as the Nether Scrolls) many thousands of years after

the fall of the empires.

The empires continued to grow until the sarrukh had con-

quered so many races that they became the minority in their

own  empire.  Thousands  of  other  races  ful lled  their  needs

and satis ed their every desire. The sarrukh savored the  nest

meats, surrounded themselves with gold, gems, and other  nery,

and enjoyed all the luxuries of a civilization at its height. But

as with so many empires since, their increasing dependence on

other races and their growing indolence spelled the beginning

of the end.

Okoth was the  rst empire to fall, collapsing about 34,100

DR  after  a  century  of  civil  strife  that  drove  many  sarrukh

to  the  planes.  Isstossef  l  followed  suit  around  33,800  DR

when, during a war with the phaerimms, its leaders rerouted the

Narrow  Sea,   ooding  the  Underdark  and  precipitating  clima-

tological changes that doomed their own realm. Mhairshaulk

was the last to fall, sliding into a slumber from which it never

emerged circa 33,500 DR.

Although most of the sarrukh died in the collapses of their

great empires, many survived. The sarrukh of Isstossef  l re-

treated into lichdom in the depths of Oreme where, protected

by the asabis they had created, they sleep safely to this day. The

sarrukh of Mhairshaulk, faced with starvation, began a cycle in

which thousand-year hibernations alternated with brief periods

of activity, during which food gathering and procreation could

take place. The great clans of Okoth wandered the planes for

millennia but never found a plane where they wished to remain

for more than a generation. This nomadic existence hardened

them, turning them inexorably toward evil.

As the sarrukh of Okoth increasingly embraced their darker

natures,  a  few  dissenters,  despairing  of  their  kindreds  push

toward evil, broke off from the main group. They entreated

Jazirian, a fragment of the World Serpent, for succor, and it

responded  by  transforming  them  into  couatls.  A  bitter  war

ensued, but the couatls held their own against the more numer-

ous  Okothian  sarrukh  until  Merrshaulk,  a  darker  fragment

of the World Serpent,  nally slew Jazirian. At that point, the

couatls were forced to  ee to Abeir-Toril, where they eventu-

ally settled in Maztica. The god Qotal embraced them as his

The Creator Races

The  ve creator races (or Iqua-TelQuessir, in the language

of  the  Fair  Folk)  dominated  Faern  during  the  Days  of

Thunder.  All  are  considered  native  to  Abeir-Toril,  as  are

their descendants and creations. Most historians agree that

the creator races were the sarrukh (known as sauroids, or cre-

ators of the serpentfolk and scalykind), the batrachi (known

as amphibioids, or creators of the bullywugs, doppelgangers,

kopru, kuo-toa, locothah, sivs, tako, and other shapeshifting,

amphibious, or piscine races), the aearee (known as avians, or

creators of the aaracokra, kenku, other birdlike humanoids),

the  fey  (known  as  sylvans,  or  creators  of  korreds,  sprites,

and  pixies),  and  humans.  Other  sages  leave  out  the  aearee

but  include  dragons  in  the  list.  Elves,  dwarves,  and  some

human ethnic groups were immigrants to Abeir-Toril from

other worlds.

Although  ve creator races existed in Faern, only four

forged empires in the earliest days of recorded history (known

today as the Days of Thunder), and only three contributed to

the creation of the items now known as the Nether Scrolls.

The  sarrukh,  batrachi,  and  aearee  each  dominated  Faern

in turn, creating or producing as offspring a host of lesser

races and recording the magic of more primitive peoples. The

fey have never dominated the continent; they chose instead

to  rule  Faerie,  an  otherworldly  realm  loosely  connected  to

Faern. Humans, the last of the Iqua-TelQuessir, did not rise

to rule Faern until after the Time of Dragons and the elven

and dwarven empires.

Except for the humans, the fate of the creator races is

largely unrecorded. A few sarrukh lurk in ancient ruins and

southern  jungles,  but  most  of  their  kindred  departed  for

other  planes  millennia  ago.  The  batrachi  may  be  extinct,

although a few scholars believe they  ed to Limbo, where

they became known as slaadi. The aearee  ew westward to the

great continent north of Maztica, and nothing is known of

their fate. The fey still rule Faerie, although the ties between

their realm and Faern are growing faint. Humans continue

to thrive, as do crossbreeds with partial human ancestry, such

as the yuan-ti.

his prison and oppose the Okothian sarrukh. Toward that goal,

the Mhairhshaulk sarrukh have begun working to re-energize

the long-slumbering yuan-ti empire known as Serpentes.

In Okoth, the Cult of Set is growing in strength under the

leadership of Pilitith, the legendary albino sarrukh leader. The

cults membership consists primarily of Scaled Ones, but a few

others have joined its ranks as well.  Opposing  the  cult  are  the

khaastas, which have begun appearing in the Lakes of Salt re-

gion. Battles between these two ancient foes have given rise

to strange reports of tremendously powerful lizard races

openly  ghting one another.

The sarrukh have not forgotten the heights

to which their race once climbed, but

they also know that many other  races

would happily eradicate the last few

sarrukh should they learn of their

continued  existence.  Thus,  they

choose to remain in hiding, quietly

seeking  to  increase  their  numbers

so  that  they  can  one  day  rebuild

their  ancient  empires.   Occasionally

the sleeping sarrukh of Mhairshaulk

awaken and draw the yuan-ti to them,

but  even  these  former  servitors  have

since  found  their  own  leaders  in  the

form  of  anathemas.  On  the  rare  oc-

casions  that  sarrukh  do  become

involved  with  the  outside  world,

they work to help the scaled  races

that they created.

Outlook

The sarrukh are well aware that

their  race  has  fallen  far  from

the  heights  it  achieved  just  after

the  dawn  of  time.  Though  they

are  individually  powerful,  their

low  numbers  now  force  them

to rely upon the races that serve

them,  creating  a  high  degree  of

vulnerability.

During  the  heyday  of  their

empires, the sarrukh became lazy

and domineering. Rather than become

directly  involved  with  the  rest  of  the

world, they delegated their building and

 ghting  to  the  lizardfolk  and  the  super-

vision of those activities to the yuan-ti, who

also  acted  as  their  personal  servants.  To  the

nagas they delegated the tasks of magical research,

exploration,  and  guarding  individuals  and  places  of

divine minions, and they acknowledged him as Jazirian reborn.

Most remained there, but a few couatls eventually returned to

Faern to deal with the fell legacies of their kindred in the

Jungles  of  Chult.  This  splinter  group  embraced  Ubtao  as  its

patron deity.

After the war with the couatls, the sarrukh began to explore

the Barrens of Doom and Despair, where they happened upon

the  khaastas.  Believing  these  creatures  to  be  inferior  and

weak reptilians, the sarrukh attempted to enslave

them. Much to the invaders surprise, not only

were the khaastas extremely resistant to

serving, but they also had powerful de-

monic allies willing to aid them. Thus

began a centuries-long war between the

sarrukh and the khaastas, which the sar-

rukh ultimately lost. To escape the wrath

of  the  victorious  khaastas,  the  sarrukh

secretly  returned  to  Faern  and  began

skulking around the ruins of Okoth, on

the shores of Azulduth.

Before  the  Fall  of  the  Gods,  the

Okothian  sarrukh  realized  that  Sseth

had  sunk  into  some  sort  of  hibernation

and  was  barely  answering  their  prayers.  To

complicate  matters  further,  the  khaastas

had   nally  tracked  them  to  Faern

and  were  seeking  to  obliterate  the

last few of them. Lacking the full

support of a divine patron, the sar-

rukh once again found themselves in

danger of extinction.

Then,  during  the  Time  of  Trou-

bles, Sseth stopped answering prayers

from  the  Okothian  sarrukh  alto-

gether. Clerics of Okoth felt the need for

action, so the approached the minions

of Set and bargained with the Lord of

Evil. Set agreed to answer their prayers

if they in turn aided him in binding Sseth

to eternal slumber. The deal was struck, and

at the conclusion of the Avatar Crisis, Set

claimed  Sseths  portfolio.  About  eleven

years  after  the  Time  of  Troubles,  Set

began  answering  the  prayers  of  all  his

newly  acquired  worshipers  (including

the  yuan-ti,  who  still  believed  their

divine power to come from Sseth).

The treachery of the Okothian sarrukh

has resulted in unintended consequences. Be-

set  by  nightmares,  Sseth  has  begun  thrashing  against

his bonds, awakening the serpentfolk elsewhere in Faern.

The sarrukh of Mhairshaulk are emerging from hiberna-

tion, seeking a means by which to liberate their god from

How the mighty

importance. The sarrukh withdrew within the walls of their pal-

aces and never emerged without heavy protection.

Despite  the  fall  of  Isstossef  l,  Mhairshaulk,  and  Okoth,

the attitude of the sarrukh has changed very little. They have

an interest in knowing what is happening in the world, but they

still choose to remain separate from it. Rather than go out and

explore, they send out their yuan-ti servants or small groups of

nagas to learn what they can and report back to them.

Preserving  each  and  every  living  sarrukh  is  now  the  most

important consideration for the race. Because none are expend-

able, sending one out into humanoid society is always a critical

decision, even if there is much to be gained by doing so. In the

past, a few sarrukh have used magic to take human form and

in ltrate the leadership structures of human societies, posing as

advisors or other important of cials.

Sarrukh Society

At  its  height,  sarrukh  civilization  was  as  grand  as  that  of

any  humanoid  empire  that  has  risen  since.  The  arts   our-

ished, and anything was available in the great markets of the

sarrukh empires.

Relationships

Sarrukh form lasting friendships unmarred by the petty jeal-

ousies  and  bickering  that  mark  many  of  their  servitor  races.

They take mates for life and treat other sarrukh with respect.

In  the  days  of  the  empire,  one  or  two  sarrukh  constitutes  a

household, but circumstances have since forced many to live in

communal groups.

Life Cycle

Sarrukh hatch from eggs that are protected and tended by both

parents until they hatch. A sarrukh can live up to a thousand

years,  or  much  longer  if  it  undergoes  periods  of  hibernation.

This deathlike sleep, which can last for years at a time, preserves

the sarrukhs body and temporarily eliminates its need for food,

water, and other valuable resources.

Beyond  these  facts,  little  is  known  about  the  life  cycle  of

these creatures. Few creatures living today have had occasion to

study the race up close, and the sarrukh, for their part, arent

willing  to  share  their  secrets  with  lesser  beings.  Thus,  they

have remained godlike in their obscurity.

Organization

While the three great empires thrived, the sarrukh were orga-

nized into several great clans that lived in relative peace with

one another. The clans that commanded the most troops and

held  the  most  political  power  (by  virtue  of  either  wealth  or

social  standing)  made  up  the  leadership  structure.  The  acting

leadership body of each empire was called the Sharrim and con-

sisted of  ve to eight sarrukh drawn from the great clans. This

group elected an emperor, called a kudzar, from its membership.

The Shsarrim from the three great empires occasionally came

together in Okoth to form a council called the Kazim, but that

body had authority over the entire race only when a unanimous

vote could be achieved.

The khuzdar provided spiritual, strategic, and social leader-

ship for the rest of the sarrukh. The two most famous khuzdars

were Ghizkith, founder of Mhairshaulk, and Pilitith, the albino

sarrukh who drove Ghizkith from Okoth. Pilitith ruled Okoth

until its fall, then used powerful magic to prolong his life into

the modern day. (Pilitith remains the leader of the Okothian

sarrukh, but he no longer wields any authority over the sarrukh

in Serpentes or Anauroch.)

Sarrukh  law,  which  was  administered  by  judges  known  as

kleigmasters, was strict but  exible. Penalties were stiff, and the

burden of proof fell to the accused rather than the prosecutors.

The sarrukh disliked jailing citizens, so the preferred methods

of punishment were death for more serious crimes and dis g-

urement for minor ones. Incarceration occurred only when the

leaders felt that the offender had something important to con-

tribute to the realm, despite his crime.

Penalties  were  assigned  on  a  case-by  case  basis  for  greater

 exibility, but the system became corrupt over the years. The

same crime might result in death for one defendant and only

dis gurement for the next. In any case, even the highest-ranking

kleigmaster could be bribed into setting free the worst-offending

defendant if enough money changed hands.

Slavery

The sarrukh began keeping slaves even before they had any

dealings  with  other  species.  Enslaving  their  own  kind  was

viewed  as  right  and  proper,  as  long  as  the  slaves  received

proper care and fair treatment. Sarrukh slaves lived in their

masters homes, received good food, and were not overworked.

Occasionally  they  were  sold  or  traded  from  one  sarrukh  to

another, but for the most part, slaves remained with the same

family  for  life.  When  a  slave  became  too  old  to  work,  he

might be freed, or assigned to rear the masters young, or be

sacri ced to the World Serpent, according to his own wishes

and his past performance.

Upon  discovering  the  other  progenitor  races,  the  sarrukh

quickly realized that such creatures would make passable ser-

vitors  and  enslaved  them.  Since  the  sarrukh  felt  little  social

responsibility  for  creatures  of  other  races,  nonsarrukh  slaves

were not treated nearly as well as sarrukh slaves. A Scaleless

One might be starved for days at a time and then beaten for her

inability to work. In the early days of the sarrukh expansion,

Scaleless Ones were not even viewed as worthy sacri ces for the

World Serpent. This abysmally low status meant that they could

be killed with impunity and eaten by their masters.

SARRUKH

By the founding of Isstossef  l and Mhairshaulk, the sar-

rukh  had  enslaved  so  many  creatures  that  they  had  stopped

keeping  sarrukh  slaves  at  all.  Each  sarrukh  lived  in  comfort,

surrounded by the  nery that had once been reserved for their

leaders. Eventually, the sarrukh stopped  ghting their own wars

and trained their slaves to  ght for them, promising that the

best warriors would be freed to enjoy the same lifestyle as the

sarrukh. Occasionally they actually kept this promise and freed

a  particularly  powerful  warrior  as  an  example  to  the  others.

The lure of freedom and wealth created an enormous and loyal

 ghting  force  that  helped  the  sarrukh  maintain  control  over

their empires.

Eventually, Scaleless Ones were deemed suitable sacri ces for

the World Serpent, thereby freeing the sarrukh from the need to

choose sacri ces from among citizens of supposedly equal rank.

Though the World Serpent did not object to the decision, it did

violate  his  original  agreement  with  the  sarrukh.  To  maintain

the letter of the agreement while accommodating the changing

needs and demands of his worshipers, the World Serpent split off

an aspect of himself that was called Mdaess, whose task was to

purify the souls of unclean sacri ces and make them equivalent

to sarrukh.

The Scaled Races

Part of the reason that nonscaled slaves were treated so poorly

was the fact that their masters actually loathed them. They found

the  Scaleless  Ones  odor  offensive,  their  primitive  languages

grating on the nerves, and their smooth skins  unsettling.

While  exploring  Faern,  the  sarrukh  encountered  numer-

ous scaly animals in the wilds, including dinosaurs, snakes, and

lizards. Some of these animals were developing along the same

lines as the ancestors of the sarrukh had, but they hadnt evolved

to the point of sentience yet. The sarrukh collected thousands of

such creatures in hopes of breeding one or more new intelligent

races to serve them.

Realizing that breeding programs alone would not be enough,

the  sarrukh  began  magical  experimentation  on  the  creatures

they had collected. They combined a few of their scaly specimens

with humans to see whether a single servitor race that was less

offensive to them could be formed. Their earliest experiments

resulted  in  badly  deformed  creatures  that  didnt  survive  long.

But through selective breeding and more subtle forms of magical

manipulation, the sarrukh  nally managed to create viable races

that were much more to their liking.

Their  rst successes were the asabis, the lizardfolk, and the

pterafolk. Though not as intelligent as humans, these creatures

had the same bipedal form and were relatively easy to manipu-

late.  Once  they  had  reassured  themselves  as  to  the  loyalty  of

these races, the sarrukh began handing off fairly easy tasks to

them. At  rst they were trained as personal servants, then as

warriors.  Finally,  entire  groups  of  them  were  planted  in  the

wilds of Faern in the hopes that they would multiply and con-

quer the surrounding territories.

The next successful experiment produced the nagas. Though

the sarrukh approved of the serpentine form with a humanoid

head, the nagas proved dif cult to control. Rather than destroy

their creations, however, the sarrukh allowed those who posed

little threat to remain in their service as guards, explorers, and

magical researchers. The rest were freed.

Their  naland perhaps  nestcreation was the yuan-ti,

developed  by  the  sarrukh  of  Mhairshaulk.  This  race  repre-

sented  the   rst  truly  successful  cross  between  human  and

sarrukh,  with  a  touch  of  serpent  thrown  in.  The  yuan-ti

came  in  several  different  physical  forms,  depending  on  the

amount  of  sarrukh  blood  used.  Though  not  as  obedient  as

the lizardfolk subraces, the yuan-ti were more biddable than

the nagas, and highly intelligent besides. Because they greatly

enjoyed being in charge of Scaleless Ones, the yuan-ti became

the slavemasters, military leaders, and managers of the sar-

rukh empires.

With so many highly skilled servitors, the sarrukh were no

longer forced to  nd their own food, build their own cities, or

even  care  for  their  own  slaves.  The  sarrukh  of  Mhairshaulk

slowly withdrew from the cares of the world as they turned over

more and more of their responsibilities to the yuan-ti. For their

part,  the  yuan-ti  appreciated  the  lifestyles  that  their  creators

allowed  them  to  have,  so  they  remained  mostly  loyal.  A  few,

however,  would  periodically  withdraw  from  sarrukh  society,

strike out on their own, and form their own groups. The sarrukh

knew of such defections but ignored them, knowing that yuan-ti

who were allowed to leave in peace would go out into the world

and create their own societies, which the sarrukh could later call

upon for aid.

Dwellings

The  sarrukh  lived  in  stonework  buildings,  which  were  typi-

cally  adorned  with  the  holy  symbols  of  the  World  Serpent.

Icons  set  into  the  walls  depicted  the  sarrukh  concept  of

divine  creatures,  which  often  appeared  demonic  by  modern

standards.  Statues  of  sarrukh  in  plazas,  courtyards,  and

along the roadways depicted either the noble sarrukh leaders,

resplendent  in  their   owing  robes,  or  armored  sarrukh  in

dramatic battle stances.

Sarrukh Characters

Because  they  are  extraordinarily  powerful  creatures,  all  sar-

rukh with class levels are automatically epic-level characters.

While  the  Epic  Level  Handbook  is  not  necessary  to  under-

stand  and  use  the  statistics  presented  in  these  pages,  DMs

wishing to let their players run sarrukh characters will  nd it

immensely helpful.

SARRUKH

Magic of the Sarrukh

The sarrukhs magical research resulted in two major contribu-

tions to the development of magic in Faern: the Nether Scrolls

and the secret of physically manipulating other creatures.

The  Nether  Scrolls  were  the  results  of  sarrukh  efforts  to

compile, deconstruct, and extrapolate the magic gleaned from

the savages that inhabited most of Faern during the early days

of the sarrukh empires. Penned by the Baetith long after the

sarrukh empires had fallen, these scrolls remain an invaluable

reference today.

The  second  major  contribution  of  the  sarrukh  was  the

discovery of permanent transforming magic that affects the

bodies of other creatures. This technique allowed the sarrukh

to permanently transform a creatures physical body and also

grant it new extraordinary and supernatural abilities. Further-

more, such characteristics were invariably passed along to the

next generation when the altered creatures bred with members

of their original races. Eventually, the sarrukh found a way

to imbue themselves with the ability to use this magic at will.

Unfortunately, this technique has been lost to the ages and now

resides only in the remaining sarrukh, though portions of it

are  embodied  in  the  ability rip and  trait removal  spells  (see

Chapter 11.)

Deities of the Sarrukh

According to sarrukh mythology, the World Serpent came to the

sarrukh when they were still savages, offering to teach them the

secrets of magic, civilization, and power. All that he demanded

in return was that they worship him and offer sacri ces to him.

The sarrukh agreed to his terms and were rewarded for their

loyalty with great knowledge and power.

During the heyday of their empires, all sarrukh worshiped

the World Serpent. As they expanded outward into Faern, they

forced the populations they conquered into the worship of the

World Serpent as well. This practice made enemies not only of

the dominated races, but also of their gods.

Sacrifice

Sacri ce is an important aspect of the World Serpents dogma.

(See Chapter 2 in Book of Vile Darkness for the speci c rewards

attainable  from  sacri ces.)  The  World  Serpent  was  especially

demanding  on  the  subject  of  suitable  sacri ces,  insisting  that

the victim be not only intelligent (Int 3 or higher) but also an

actual sarrukh. In most cases, religious zealots readily gave their

lives for their god, so only rarely was the sacri ce a criminal or

a social derelict.

Sacri ces  initially  occurred  on  a  weekly  basis.  The  priests

gave the designated victim whatever he desired for a period of

three days. Any food, drink, or indulgence of the  esh was pro-

vided on demand, and the victim was permitted to stay in any

accommodations desired, including the various imperial strong-

holds in Okoth. The victim was watched closely by security but

otherwise treated as royalty.

Upon the night of the sacri ce, the sarrukh gathered the

community together to pray to the World Serpent. After treat-

ment with incense, the sacri cial victim carved his own heart

from his chest with a ceremonial dagger. With the still-beating

heart in his hands, the high priest smeared the blood of the

sacri ce on his own body and those of the other clergy, then

all the priests withdrew to their temples.

As the practice of sacri cing Scaleless Ones to the World

Serpent  in  place  of  sarrukh  gained  in  popularity  and  the

number  of  conquered  races  increased,  so  too  did  the  number

of weekly sacri ces. Scaleless Ones were rarely given the royal

treatment that sarrukh had been, and few were really willing.

Thus, the sacri ces took on the aspects of wholesale slaughter.

At the height of the sarrukh civilization, up to a hundred sen-

tient creatures might be rounded up and sacri ced on any given

night at each temple. The priests assumed the duty of removing

the hearts of the victims, since nonsarrukh really could not be

depended upon to carry out this essential task themselves. Be-

cause the blood of these creatures had an odor they considered

foul, the sarrukh priests discarded the ritual of smearing the

spilled blood on themselves.

After the fall of their empires, the sarrukh no longer had

other  races  under  their  control,  and  their  own  population

was  so  low  that  they  could  not  afford  to  throw  their  own

lives  away.  Worse  yet,  the  yuan-ti  who  had  served  them  in

Mhairshaulk  were  no  longer  willing  to  sacri ce  themselves

on behalf the sarrukh. Nevertheless, the World Serpent still

demanded obedience and sacri ces. To appease him, the sar-

rukh sacri ced either lizardfolk or other creatures that their

servants brought to them. The number of sarrukh sacri ces

dropped drastically in the aftermath of the empire because of

both the lack of available sacri ces and the sarrukhs lengthy

hibernations.

The Fragmentation of

the World Serpent

At the height of the sarrukh empires, the World Serpent liter-

ally fragmented into an entire pantheon, each deity of which

was  a  different  aspect  of  himself.  Sages  agree  that  this  event

was precipitated by the con icting needs and demands of an ever

more diverse base of worshipers.

Following the fall of the sarrukh empires, the worship of the

World Serpent almost completely vanished, although he contin-

ued to supply spells to the creatures that still worshiped deities

embodying portions of his essence. See the Appendix for com-

plete information on the deities worshiped by the Scaled Ones.

SARRUKH

Relations with

Other Races

The  sarrukh  consider  themselves  far  better  than  the  vermin

known as humans, who have somehow managed to become the

most  powerful  species  in  the  world.  They  nurse  a  deep-seated

hatred for the dragons and the phaerimms, and they  nd other

powerful creatures (such as aboleths, illithids, and beholders) to

be little more than annoyances.

Sarrukh

Equipment

The  sarrukh  prefer  magic  items  to

other  equipment,  though  many  do

employ personal weapons of various

kinds.  In  general,  however,  servitor

races  still  constitute  the  sarrukhs

best tools and weapons.

Sarrukh

Encounters

The  following  villain  could  oppose

heroes seeking to unlock the secrets of

the serpent kingdoms or thwart the

sarrukhs plans for world  conquest.

Pilitith

Pilitith

The snake-bodied sarrukh named Pilitith

was the last emperor of Okoth, and by dint of

powerful magic, he remains alive to this day.

Pilitith  is  an  albinoin  fact,  he  is  the  only

albino  sarrukh  currently  alive  in  Faern.  Because  of  the  lack

of pigment in his scales, he must remain in complete darkness.

If exposed to direct sunlight, he takes 1d4 points of nonlethal

damage per round.

After the fall of Okoth, Pilitith remained the leader of the

great clans that took to the planes. While in the Outer Planes,

he  had  the  audacity  to  seek  out  the  fragment  of  the  World

Serpent known as Merrshaulk to ask for his guidance. When he

arrived at Merrshaulks home plane, the god was deep in slum-

ber, and his serpent guards refused to admit the sarrukh to his

stronghold. Pilitith, however, de ed the guards and stirred the

god from his slumber.

Merrshaulk  would  have  destroyed  most  mortals  for  dis-

turbing him, but he recognized Pilitith and granted him an

audience. He thanked the sarrukh for overseeing the creation

of the serpent races of Faern that had come to worship him.

He then commanded the albino to lead the remaining sarrukh

to a place where they could establish a homeland. Once they

60

were settled, the god promised to watch over them and help

them to rebuild.

Pilitith,  having  grown  old  after  his  nearly  eight  hundred

years of life, begged Merrshaulk for one additional favor. In re-

turn for his active promotion of the gods interests, he asked to

be raised to the status of a Chosen. Merrshaulk had never taken

a Chosen before because such an act required the expenditure of

a great deal of divine power. Nevertheless, recognizing the bene t

of having such a strong follower, he granted Pilitiths request.

The Chosen of Merrshaulk led his sarrukh followers from the

gods home and wandered the planes, looking for an ideal

location in which to start again. A misguided attempt

to enslave the khaastas turned the barbar-

ic,  nomadic,  lizards  into  mortal  enemies

of the sarrukh, who eventually had to  ee

back to Faern. Pilitith remained in charge

of the Okoth stronghold while his followers

hid  from  the  vengeful  khaastas.  The  next

crisis  came  when  Sseth  (the  reborn  aspect

of  Merrshaulk)  abruptly  stopped  answering

prayers during the Time of Troubles.

Pilitiths leadership was suddenly in jeop-

ardy  after  he  had  ruled  over  generations  of

sarrukh. For weeks he hid the fact that he was

unable to contact Sseth, but  nally he declared

that  either  Sseth  was  either  dead  or  he  had

turned his back on his people. In either

case, they needed a replacement de-

ity. Pilitith had heard of the god

Set, whom he had always (incor-

rectly) assumed was a fragment

of the World Serpent. He had

learned that Set was still grant-

ing spells (albeit only to those who

visited him directly) and was in con-

tact with his followers. Pilitith arranged a dialogue with

the Lord of Evil and convinced the god that his people were

willing to follow him if he would grant them spells.

Pilitith introduced Set to his followers, claiming that the

Mulhorandi  god  was  Sseths  successor.  The  sarrukh  of  Okoth

were satis ed with this arrangement but, as the Avatar Crisis

drew to a close, Set revealed to Pilitith that the Okothian sar-

rukh  would  have  to  help  bind  Sseth  into  eternal  slumber  in

return for his favor. After they complied, Sseth began to thrash

against  his  bonds.  In  so  doing,  he  awoke  many  Mhairshaulk

sarrukh  and  Serpentes  yuan-ti  and  energized  them  to  extend

their dominion over the Scaleless Ones of Faern once more.

Sseths only conscious action thus far, however, has been to strip

Pilitith of his title and power as Chosen.

Pilitith has remained leader of his tribe, though his bodys

clock  has  started  up  once  again,  bringing  him  ever  closer  to

death.  He  is  the  only  sarrukh  that  still  remembers  the  great

empire his people once controlled. Despite the setbacks he has

endured, he still intends to re-establish some measure of control

over the world, and he intends to retain his position as leader.

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, Pilitith can create an aura

of fear in a 10-foot radius. This effect is otherwise identical with

the fear spell (caster level 14th; save DC 23). A creature that

succeeds on the save cannot be affected again by Pilitiths fear

aura for 24 hours. Other sarrukh are immune to this aura.

Manipulate  Form  (Su):  At  will,  Pilitith  can  modify  the

form of any Scaled One native to Toril, except for aquatic and

undead creatures. With a successful touch attack, he can cause

one alteration of his choice in the target creatures body. The

target  falls  unconscious  for  2d4  rounds  due  to  the  shock  of

changing form. A successful DC 23 Fortitude negates both the

change and the unconsciousness.

Pilitith may use this ability to change a minor aspect of the

target creature, such as the shape of its head or the color of its

scales.  He  may  also  choose  to  make  a  much  more  signi cant

alteration,  such  as  converting  limbs  into  tentacles,  changing

overall body shape (snake to humanoid, for example), or adding

or removing an appendage. Any ability score may be decreased to

a minimum of 1 or increased to a maximum equal to Pilitiths

corresponding score. Pilitith may also grant the target an ex-

traordinary ability or remove one from it.

The change bestowed takes effect immediately and is perma-

nent. Furthermore, the alterations are automatically passed on

to all the creatures offspring when it breeds with another of its

unmodi ed kind.

Poison (Ex): Bite, injury, Fortitude DC 23; initial and second-

ary damage 1d6 temporary Con.

PILITITHS CONSORTS

A yuan-ti slave who pleases Pilitith in life continues to serve

him in death as a dread wraith. Eight undead consorts currently

haunt  Pilitiths  royal  chambers.  These  yuan-ti  abominations

successful attack, the dread wraith gains 5 temporary hit points.

Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid or monstrous humanoid

slain by a dread wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. Spawn

serve the wraith that created them and remain enslaved until de-

stroyed. They do not retain any of the abilities they had in life.

Daylight Powerlessness (Ex): Dread wraiths are utterly pow-

erless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and  ee

from it.

Lifesense (Su): A dread wraith notices and locates living crea-

tures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

It also senses the strength of their life force automatically, as if

it had cast deathwatch.

Unnatural  Aura  (Su):  Animals,  whether  wild  or  domesti-

cated, can sense the unnatural presence of a dread wraith at a

distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than

that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long

as they are within that range.

A creature that resembles a giant pit viper raises two heads,

one at each end of its body. Small horns above each eye give

it a diabolical appearance.

An amphisbaena is an aggressive pit viper about 13 feet long

with  a  head  at  each  end  of  its  body.  Small  horns  above  each

eye help the creature to rip the skin that bunches at its middle

when it molts. The coloration of its scales is as varied as that

of vipers.

Short  distances  are  navigated  with  an  odd  sidewinding

motion similar to that of many other snakes. The creature typi-

cally  travels  longer  distances  by  retracting  its  fangs,  grasping

one of its necks with the other mouth, and rapidly rolling along

like a hoop.

Combat

An amphisbaena can attack with both its heads simultaneously,

and each head may strike a separate target if desired. Moreover,

an amphisbaenas two heads give it an advantage over normal

snakes  in  that  it  can  feed  and  defend  against  threats  at  the

same time.

Poison  (Ex):  Bite,  Fortitude  DC  15,  initial  and  secondary

damage 1d8 Constitution. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Hardened  Corpse  (Su):  Just  before  death,  an  amphisbaena

attempts to bite one head with the other. If it succeeds, its body

turns to hardened stone upon death.

Skills:  An  amphisbaena  has  a  +4  racial

bonus on Hide and Tumble checks, a +8

Amphisbaena

An immense shape slithers through the branches that

form a canopy over the forest  oor. Its dark green form

is nearly invisible against the leaves, but its serpentine eyes,

unblinking and yellow, track its prey with cold precision.

In the Realms

In the Battledale town of Chariton, a clutch of amphisbaenae

hatched  some  years  ago.  Finding  the  young  somewhat  docile,

the  citizens  left  them  alone.  But  after  hibernating  and  grow-

ing to immense proportions (as most specimens of the Ashaba

strain do), the amphisbaenae devoured nearly all of the towns

residents,  leaving  Chariton  a  ghost  town.  The  amphisbaenae

have since moved on to the forests near the Pool of Yeven, the

Deeping Stream, and Lake Sember.

Many  horri c  tales  tell  of  a  single  deathcoils  devouring  an

entire party of adventurers, one by one. This mighty constric-

tor snake likes to lurk on forest fringes, where wild herd animals

stray from the plains to dine on tree foliage. The creatures abil-

ity to hibernate for months at a time enables it to survive even

the coldest winters.

A deathcoils eats carrion, all other snakes, and fresh prey of

all kinds. It even attacks its own kind on sight unless the oppo-

nent is clearly larger. The smaller deathcoils usually  ees from

such a confrontation, and the aggressor rarely pursues for long.

A deathcoils is a dark green, snakelike creature with round

black and brown markings that help it hide in forest settings. It

can grow up to 80 feet long.

MONSTERS

Combat

Deathcoils are aggressive, relentless hunters. Those that live near

water often drag their prey underwater to drown it. They usually

save their breath weapons for defense against numerous foes, or

to slay formidable opponents.

Deathcoils have the intelligence to plan ambushes, and they

often collect treasure from victims and scatter it near a cave or

a good ambush area to lure prey off a trail. They have also been

known to drive animals into ravines and over precipices, then

leave their broken bodies for later feasting while they hunt

other creatures.

Constrict  (Ex):  On  a  successful  grapple  check,  a

deathcoils deals 1d8+10 points of damage.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,

a  deathcoils  must  hit  an  opponent  up  to  one

size category larger than itself with its bite

attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity. If

it wins the grapple check, it establishes

a  hold  and  can  constrict.  A  deathcoils

often drags grabbed prey underwater

to  drown  (see  page  304  in  the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

Poison  Breath  (Ex):  Twice  per  day,

a  deathcoils  can  breathe  a  60-foot  cone

of  poisonous  gas  (inhaled,  Fortitude  DC

16,  initial  damage  sleep  for  2d4  hours  or

until  damage  is  taken,  secondary  damage

1d6 Con).

Skills:  A  deathcoils  gains  a  +4  racial

bonus on Hide, Listen, and Spot checks

and a +8 racial bonus on Balance

and Climb checks.

A deathcoils can always choose

to take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.

A deathcoils can use either its Strength or its Dexterity modi-

 er for Climb checks, whichever is higher.

A deathcoils has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to per-

form some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

In the Realms

Known  in  forests  all  over  Faern,  the  deathcoils  is  a  legend-

ary  foe.  Tales  credit  it  with  more  intelligence  than  it  really

possesses, but deathcoils have deliberately sunk boats on forest

rivers  and  pinned  them  down  with  boulders  so  as  to  create  a

larder  of  drowned  victims  for  later  dining.  They  commonly

chase  foes  that  have  eluded  or  wounded  them  for  miles,  and

64

they often leave forests by night to attack nearby penned herds

of livestock.

Certain pieces of furniture owned by Calishite satraps (and

royalty across Faern) are covered in deathcoils skin, which re-

tains its supple sheen for centuriesthough its scales are both

hard and slippery. Deathcoils blood is a secret ingredient of the

yuan-ti osssra (see Chapter 10) known as duthlahhass.

Dinosaur

Dinosaurs,  or  terrible  lizards,  are  ancient

reptilian beasts that may be related to dragons.

Among  the  traits  that  the  typical  preda-

tory  dinosaur  shares  with  many  dragons

are  sharp  teeth,  a  savage  disposition,  a

well-developed sense of territory, and a

ruthless drive to hunt. The herbivorous

dinosaurs  are  not  usually  aggressive

unless  wounded  or  defending  their

young,  but  may  attack  if  startled

or harassed.

Dinosaurs  most  often  live  in

rugged  or  isolated  areas  that

humanoids  seldom  visit:  remote

mountain  valleys,  inaccessible

plateaus, tropical islands, and the

densest jungles.

MONSTERS

This massive predators body displays its incredible strength.

Turning  its  head  on  its  S-shaped  neck,  the  creature  peers

through the underbrush in search of prey.

The  ceratosaur  derives  all  its  nourishment  from  meat.  When

hungry, this massive predator is the bane of any creatures in

its way.

Measuring  between  24  and  30  feet  from  nose  to  tail,  the

ceratosaur walks on two strong legs and has a bulky body, heavy

bones, and a massive tail. Its strong, serpentine neck supports

a lizardlike head with a short horn protruding from its snout.

Its eyes are large, and it has two short brow ridges plus several

bony knobs above its eyes and on the top of its head. Its arms

are short, ending in four- ngered hands.

COMBAT

The ceratosaur is not subtle in combat. It tries to catch prey by

surprise, then relies on its speed and its powerful jaws to make

the kill. If a pair of ceratosaurs is hunting together, one usually

makes its presence known, causing prey to bolt into the waiting

clutches of its partner.

Rend  (Ex):  A  ceratosaur  that  wins  a  grapple  check  after

a  successful  bite  attack  establishes  a  hold,  latching  onto  the

opponents  body  and  shaking  it  to  tear  the   esh.  This  attack

automatically deals 2d8+10 points of damage.

IN THE REALMS

Like most dinosaurs, the ceratosaur is native to the jungles of

Chult and is not regularly encountered anywhere else. Though

many have tried at the cost of their lives, no one has yet tamed

a ceratosaur.

This  large,  birdlike  reptile  has  a  long,  toothy  beak,  a  thin

headcrest, sharp talons, and small claws at the joints of its

leathery wings. Its eyes are large and yellow, and its scaly skin

sprouts small tufts of downy feathers.

Pteranadons  are  large  pterosaurs  occasionally  used  as   ying

mounts.

COMBAT

Pteranadons are  shers, used to hunting their prey on the wing.

They  do  not  generally  like  to   y  into  a  raging  melee  on  the

ground, but are more comfortable in the swoops and dives of

aerial combat with other  ying creatures or mounts.

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light  load  for  a  pteranadon  is  up  to

300 pounds; a medium load, 301600 pounds; and a heavy load,

601900 pounds. A pteranadon can drag 4,500 pounds.

IN THE REALMS

Like  most  dinosaurs,  the  pteranadon  is  native  to  the  jungles

of Chult and is not regularly encountered anywhere else. Some

of the more powerful creatures of Chult train pteranadons to

actively hunt those who would intrude on their territory.

TRAINING A PTERANADON

Training a pteranadon to bear a rider requires six weeks of work

and  a  DC  25  Handle  Animal  check,  and  an  exotic  saddle  is

needed to balance upon the creatures back. A pteranadon can

 ght  while  carrying  a  rider,  but  the  rider  cannot  also  attack

unless a Ride check is successful.

This immense creature walks on four short but massive legs.

Two rows of bony plates line its back, and its tail is covered

in long, bony spikes. Its head is relatively small, and its mouth

ends in a powerful beak.

The stegosaurus is an immense yet stupid herbivore often found

in the plains and jungles, where it feasts on grasses, plants, and

leaves.  These  creatures  are  most  often  encountered  in  herds,

which are vicious enough as a group that only the most brazen

predators dare attack them.

The stegosaurus has a small head and a tiny brain. Its mouth

is a powerful beak, and its thick legs end in round feet studded

with hoo ike claws. Its hind legs are longer and stronger than its

front ones, allowing it to rear up to get at leaves high above the

ground. The two rows of bony, leaf-shaped plates along its neck,

back, and tail are used for the collection and dispersion of heat.

These plates give way to vicious spikes at the end of an unusually

muscular tail.

COMBAT

The stegosaurus is by and large a peaceful animal, but it is quick

to defend itself from predators and hunters. When threatened,

it uses its two front hooves to kick opponents while swinging its

mighty tail about, catching its enemies with the vicious spikes.

Powerful Charge (Ex): A stegosaurus typically begins a battle

by charging at its opponent. In addition to the normal bene ts

and hazards of a charge, this tactic allows the creature to make

a single slam attack with a +17 attack bonus that deals 4d8+12

points of damage.

Trample (Ex): Re ex DC 27 half. The save DC is Strength-

based.

IN THE REALMS

Like  most  dinosaurs,  the  stegosaurus  is  native  to  the  jungles

of Chult and is not regularly encountered anywhere else. These

fearsome creatures are hunted by many jungle creatures because

they provide an abundant source of meat.

Although the name jaculi is sometimes used as a collective

term for tree-dwelling snakes (including the boomslang and

the  emerald  tree  boa),  the  jaculi  of  Faern  is  a  particular

kind of creature.

A jaculi looks like a snake with mauve to dark purple scales.

Its bony, arrowhead-shaped head is studded with stubby but sharp

parallel horns that point straight forward toward its nose.

Jaculi

Combat

Jaculis are intelligent hunters that never forget past expe-

riences.  They  are  wise  enough  to  attack  isolated  creatures,

avoid falling onto pointed objects or obvious weapons, and

seek  out  sleeping  prey.  A  jaculi  typically  uses  its  animal

trance ability to lure small birds or furred forest creatures

into a nest or den, then slithers inside and uses its body to

block the exit.

Against formidable foes, a jaculi begins combat by launch-

ing  itself  from  a  high  spot  (a  tree  branch  or  even  the  roof

of a building) for a  ying gore attack. Should it face attacks

from more than a single foeor a hard  ght from its chosen

victimit springs to the nearest tree and climbs out of reach.

If pursued, it jumps from tree to tree to get away, seeking a

place to hide, then turns and follows its foes unseen, attacking

again when conditions are advantageous.

Jaculis  usually  swallow  small  prey  whole,  but  they  can

also bite and chew, savaging prey too large to swallow. Unless

they are starving, they eat only prey they have killed them-

selves less than two days ago. When feeding hungry young,

a jaculi sometimes slays a large beast and hides in or under

67

Flying Gore (Ex): A jaculi can

hurl  itself  down  on  an  oppo-

nent like an arrow from a point

30  feet  or  more  above.  This

 ying  gore  attack  (+10  melee)

deals  1d8+6  points  of  piercing

damage from the jaculis horns

and  does  not  provoke  attacks

of opportunity.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use

this  ability,  a  jaculi  must  hit

with its bite attack. It can then

attempt to start a grapple as a

free  action  without  provoking

an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it estab-

lishes a hold and can constrict.

If  it  takes  10  or  more  points

of  damage,  it   ees  to  seek

easier prey.

Chameleon  Power  (Sp):  At

will,  a  jaculi  can  psionically

change  the  coloration  of  its

body  as  a  standard  action  to

match its surroundings, gaining

a  +10  circumstance  bonus  on

Hide checks.

Spring (Ex): A jaculi can gather its coils and then launch

itself in a jump. The Jump DCs for both long jumps and high

jumps  are  halved,  and  no  running  start  is  required.  Further-

more, when jumping down, the jaculi takes damage as if it had

dropped 70 fewer feet than it actually did.

Skills: A jaculi has a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, and

Spot  checks  and  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Balance,  Climb,  and

Jump checks.

A jaculi can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.

A  jaculi  uses  either  its  Strength  modi er  or  its  Dexterity

modi er for Climb checks, whichever is higher.

A jaculi has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform

some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to

take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in

a straight line.

In the Realms

Jaculis inhabit all of Faern except arctic and subarctic areas.

They can roam for miles while hunting, but they usually hunt in

favorite areas that they have come to know well, moving on only

when food becomes scarce. Jaculis arent territorial; they ignore

others of their kind except in the spring, when they mate.

Jaculis have very long lifespans and sometimes form wary

alliances with long-lived creatures that they know they cannot

defeat.  With  the  aid  of  magic,  jaculis  can  sometimes  be

trained as guardians.

This  humanoid  creature  is  covered  in  dark  green  scales.

Menacing red eyes gleam from its head, and black, batlike

wings sprout from its back. Long, sleek horns that begin at its

browline are swept back behind its head.

Lizard  kings  (or  lizard  queens,  as  the  females  are  called)  re-

sult from breeding demons with lizardfolk. When a lizard king

breeds with other lizardfolk, about 20% of the offspring are liz-

ard kings; the rest are ordinary lizardfolk. When the young

lizard  kings  in  a  tribe  reach  adult-

hood,  all  but  the  strongest  are

sacri ced.

A lizard king resembles a lizardfolk, al-

though its scales are a darker shade of

green, and it always has distinct de-

monic features. A typical lizard king

leads its own tribe of lizardfolk.

Lizard kings speak Draconic.

Combat

Lizardfolk tribes ruled by lizard kings

are  more  advanced  than  other  tribes,

and  they  typically  use  sophisticated

tactics, ambushes, and traps. Lizard kings

dont  shy  away  from  battle,  but  they

keep their  ercest warriors nearby and

almost  never  enter  combat  alone.

While  most  lizardfolk  are  disor-

ganized  in  combat,  those  led  by  a

lizard king stand by their ruler at

all costs.

Smite  Good  (Su):  Once  per

day,  a  lizard  king  can  make  a  nor-

mal melee attack to deal 2 extra points

Lizard queen

of damage against a good foe.

Spell-Like Abilities: Darkness 3/day. Caster level 2nd.

Hold Breath: A lizard king can hold its breath for a number

of  rounds  equal  to  four  times  its  Constitution  score  before  it

risks drowning (see page 304 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Skills: Because of its tail, a lizard king has a +4 racial bonus

on Balance, Jump, and Swim checks. The skill modi ers given

in the statistics block include a 2 armor check penalty (4 on

Swim checks) for carrying a heavy shield.

Note: A lizard king is simply a lizardfolk with the half- end

template applied. A lizard king with class levels gains additional

spell-like abilities and special qualities as a half- end of the same

character level would.

In the Realms

Lizard  kings  are  the  direct  results  of  the  war  between  the

sarrukh and the khaastas. The demon lord Sessinnek sent his

demonic  legions  to  Faern  to  control  the  lizardfolk,  hoping

to  weaken  the  sarrukhs  base  of  support  on  their  homeworld.

MONSTERS

The war dragged on for centuries, and the demons were eventu-

ally recalled to the Barrens of Doom and Despair, leaving their

offspring, the lizard kings, to rule in their stead.

Only  four  out  of  ten  lizardfolk  tribes  are  ruled  by  lizard

kings  today.  Such  tribes  are  highly  aggressive,  often  warring

with  civilized  settlements  as  well  as  other  lizardfolk,  though

they almost never battle other tribes under the control of lizard

kings. While lizardfolk are normally not evil, those tribes under

the leadership of lizard kings are.

Wereserpent

A wereserpent is a humanoid or giant that can transform itself

into a snake form and a hybrid snake-human form. Its bite can

af ict other humanoids or giants with this kind of lycanthropy.

swallowing creatures whole.

MONSTERS

In  humanoid  form,  a  wereserpent  is  slender,   ne-featured,

and lithe, moving as  uidly as an elf dancer. It typically has dark

eyes and hair and dresses in skin-revealing clothing with large

openings. A wereserpent usually does not have body piercings,

and it avoids jewelry thats af xed to the body rather than to

garments.

Combat

Wereserpents in human form tend to  ght with knives or spells,

usually  as  a  last  resort  when  open  con ict

cant be avoided. In snake form, they  ght

as constrictors. A wereserpent in hybrid form

can cast spells or wield weapons with its human-

oid  arms  and  hands,  constrict  with  its  coils,  and

bite.  Changing  from  any  of  its  forms  to  another

is  a  standard  action.  Except  as  noted  below,

wereserpents  function  the  same  as  other

lycanthropes (see the Lycanthrope entry

in the Monster Manual).

Alternate  Form  (Su):  A

were serpent can assume the

form of a Medium constric-

tor snake or a snake-human hybrid.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a

wereserpent in snake or hybrid form deals 1d3+6

points of damage.

Curse  of  Lycanthropy  (Su):  Any  hu-

manoid or giant hit by the wereserpents bite

attack in animal or hybrid form must succeed on a DC

15 Fortitude saving throw or contract lycanthropy.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a wereserpent

must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and

can constrict.

Serpent Empathy (Ex): Communicate with serpents and ser-

pentfolk, and +4 racial bonus on Charisma-based checks against

serpents and serpentfolk.

The wereserpent presented here is based on a 1st-level human

warrior who is a natural lycanthrope, using the following base

ability scores: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

In the Realms

Wereserpents can be found anywhere in Faern, although they

hide  their  natures  as  much  as  possible.  Theyre  particularly

common around established yuan-ti settlements where snake and

human breeding experiments have been going on for centuries,

and in cities (especially tropical ports) where yuan-ti slavers and

agents operate.

70

Wereserpents

Many wereserpents of Faern are rogues or arcane spellcast-

ers, and most of them hate nagas and yuan-ti (but not snakes).

Wereserpents that can cast arcane spells tend to be either soli-

tary stalkers and slayers of yuan-ti orvery rarelyfriends or

allies of the Coiled Cabal (see Chapter 1).

At least one fallen noble family of Tethyr consists entirely

of wereserpents. The Janor clan, whose members are now scat-

tered up and down the Sword Coast, crave obscurity despite their

success as merchants, and they use a variety of false names and

guises to protect the family secret.

meat, and they suffer no ill effects from ingesting  esh tainted

with their own poison.

Mlarrauns are best known for their ability to assume a stone-

like form as a kind of torpor when targeted by spells or magical

effects. These stone snakes are often placed as traps by yuan-ti

and other Scaled Ones.

A mlarraun resembles a dark brown or black serpent with an

arrowhead-shaped head.

Combat

Though  mlarrauns  are  quite  effective  at  stalking

their prey, they are neither cunning nor capable

of anticipating danger. Many are trampled by

the hooves of beasts that are unaware of their

presence.

Poison (Ex): Bite or spit, injury or con-

tact,  Fortitude  DC  11,  initial  damage

blindness  2d6  hours,  secondary

damage  blindness  4d6  hours  and

1d4  points  of  damage.  The  poison

need  not  touch  the  eyes  to  cause

blindness.

Stone  Torpor  (Su):  Any  spell  or

magical  effect  that  speci cally

targets  a  mlarraun  causes  it  to

instantly  lapse  into  a  torpor  that

lasts for 1d100 days. Its scales become hard

and gray, though its body remains  exible. Contact

with  magic  weapons  or  other  magic  items  that  do  not

speci cally target the mlarraun does not trigger this change.

While in this state, the mlarraun can be posed by manually

adjusting its body. Enterprising artisans and trap designers some-

times  shape  the  creature  into  handles  for  chests,  ornamental

scrollwork,  and  the  like.  Such  adjustments  do  not  wake  the

mlarraun. In this form, the creatures natural armor bonus rises

to +10.

Damage in excess of one-half its original hit points awakens

the mlarraun instantly, as does any spell that targets it. When

it awakens, naturally or by other means, it bites or spits poison

at the nearest creature.

Skills: A mlarraun has a +4 racial bonus on Hide, Listen,

and  Spot  checks  and  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Balance  and

Climb checks.

A mlarraun can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check,

even if rushed or threatened.

A mlarraun uses either its Strength modi er or its Dexterity

modi er for Climb checks, whichever is higher.

A mlarraun has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to per-

form some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

In the Realms

Mlarrauns are most numerous in the open lands south of the

Sea  of  Fallen  Stars,  but  they  have  been  carried  elsewhere  by

humans both as curiosities and for alchemical purposes. In ear-

lier centuries, merchants often sold them as ornaments and even

toys, unaware that they could revive.

A few clients have hired adventurers to capture stone snakes

for use in traps against thieves or as deadly gifts for foes. Little

use has been made of them for this purpose, however, since their

periods of torpor can vary considerably.

A  rustling  in  the  marsh  weeds  brie y  reveals  itself  as  a

waddles forward on partially webbed rear feet, then darts

back  into  the  undergrowth,  its  mottled  hide  blending  with

Muckdwellers  are  bipedal  amphibians  that  dwell  in  swamps,

marshes, and mud-bottomed bodies of still water. Many serve

kuo-toa or lizardfolk tribes, surviving on the periphery of such

societies and venerating their gods.

Muckdwellers are omnivorous, but they prefer fresh, warm

meat to plants, insects, and aquatic animals. They dwell below

the water but maintain muddy, above-water areas for resting,

eating,  and  hoarding  shiny  objects.  Though  they  are  not  tool

users, they do occasionally build rafts of reeds, twigs, and mud

on which to  oat and hunt, as well as shelters where they can

hide from predators. Muckdwellers hibernate during the winter

months in temperate or colder climes.

A muckdweller looks like a miniature bipedal dinosaur with

mottled gray and brown scales and a pale yellow underbelly. Its

short tail is used for balancing and swimming. It has partially

webbed rear feet and small, weak, prehensile foreclaws.

Muckdwellers speak Draconic.

Combat

Muckdwellers  ee unless cornered or certain

of an easy kill. Packs of the creatures lurk

below the waterline, waiting in ambush

for potential prey. Before closing with

a  foe,  muckdwellers  employ  their  spit

attacks to blind their opponents.

Squirt  (Ex):  A  muckdweller  can

squirt a jet of water into the eyes of

a  target  up  to  25  feet  away.  Anyone

hit by this attack must make a DC 13

Re ex save or be blinded for 1 round. The

save DC is Dexterity-based.

Skills:  A  muckdweller  has  a  +8

racial bonus on any Swim check

to  perform  some  special  action

or avoid a hazard. It can always

choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim

check,  even  if  distracted  or

endangered.  It  can  use  the  run

action  while  swimming,  provided  it

swims  in  a  straight  line.  A  muckdweller  uses

its  Dexterity  bonus  instead  of  its  Strength  bonus  for

Swim checks.

In the Realms

Muckdwellers  live  in  the  shadow  of  lizardfolk  tribes  across

Faern, from the Mere of Dead Men to the Great Swamp of

Rethild,  and  from  the  Lizard  Marsh  to  the  Surmarsh.  The

lizardfolk  of  Kalran  in  the  northern  Serpent  Hills  keep  a

large number of muckdwellers as slaves. The creatures are also

prevalent  in  the  subterranean  cities  of  the  kuo-toa,  including

Gathgoolgapool, beneath the heart of the Chultan Peninsula.

Naga

Nagas are highly intelligent and independent creatures with a va-

riety of magical powers. They are the masters of all they survey,

and their subtle wards and clever traps keep most intruders from

disturbing their peace.

A nagas has a long, snakelike body covered with glistening

scales and a more or less human face. It ranges in length from

10 to 20 feet and weighs between 200 and 500 pounds. The eyes

of a naga are bright and intelligentburning with an almost

hypnotic inner light.

Combat

Nagas favor spells over other forms of combat. Because they are

almost always found in places that they have guarded for many

years and know well, they can usually arrange encoun-

ters to suit their wishes.

In the Realms

Nagas of every subspecies are found across

the length and breadth of Faern. Most

favor  ancient  ruins  of  long-fallen

empires  as  lairs.  Dark  nagas  are

most  common  in  the  Serpent

Hills and the Dalelands region,

whereas  guardian  nagas  favor

lost ruins along the Sword Coast and

the  northern  shore  of  the  Shining

Sea.  Spirit  nagas  inhabit  marshes  in

the lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars and

mangrove  swamps  on  the  Chultan  Penin-

sula.  Large  numbers  of  water  nagas

lair in the depths of the Naga ow and

the Nagawater. The distribution of the

lesser-known  naga  races  is  discussed  in

their entries below.

hideous head bears a mockery of

a human face, its mouth ringed by

tiny, wormlike growths.

Banelar nagas are evil, nagalike

creatures whose mastery of spells

and  magic  items  makes  them

deadly opponents.

A banelar naga has a snakelike

body  covered  in  dark,  purple-green

scales  and  an  oversized  humanoid

head.  Its  eyes  are  green-white  and

glistening with malice, and tiny tentacles

grow in a ring about its mouth. Its brown tail

ends in a wicked-looking stinger.

Banelar naga

Although its tentacles are too weak to wield weapons,

they can be used to wear, manipulate, or carry minor

items such as rings, keys, wands, and bits of food. Banelar nagas

can breathe air or water with equal ease.

Banelar nagas speak Common, Draconic, and Orc with their

horrid, hissing voices.

COMBAT

A banelar attacks with its bite and the stinger at the end of its

tail, both of which inject venom. In addition, the creature can

choose  from  a  wide  rage  of  magical  abilities  to  complement

these attacks.

Poison (Ex): Bite or sting, injury or contact, Fortitude DC

18, initial damage 2d4 Con, secondary damage unconsciousness

for 1d3 hours. As a side effect of the poison, the victims skin

turns blue around the wound until the secondary damage ends.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spells: A banelar casts spells as a 6th-level cleric with access

to  the  Evil,  Magic,  and  Water  domains  and  as  a  6th-level

wizard. It can cast a single spell every round as a free action

while attacking.

Typical  Cleric  Spells  Prepared  (5/4+1/4+1/3+1;  save  DC

person*, mage armor, magic missile, shield; 2ndfoxs cunning,

mirror  image,  Tashas  hideous  laughter*,  touch  of

idiocy*; 3rdhaste, lightning bolt, suggestion*.

Because of the Spell Focus (enchantment)

feat, the DC for saves against these spells is

14 + spell level.

Magic  Items:  Banelar  nagas  col-

lect magic items and use them freely.

Their  tentacles  can  wear  or  ma-

nipulate  amulets,  rings,  wands,  rods,

potions, and similar small items.

Resist  Petrification  (Ex):  A

banelar  gains  a  +3  racial  bonus

on saving throws made to resist

petri cation.

Skills:  A  banelar  has  a  +8  racial

bonus  on  any  Swim  check  to  per-

form some special action or avoid a

hazard. It can always choose to take

10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

IN THE REALMS

Though named for the many alliances they have made with

priests  of  Bane,  these  monsters  worked  with  the  church  of

Cyric  during  the  fourteen  years  when  Bane  was  dead.  Upon

the return of the Black Lord, some banelar nagas decided to

continue  their  allegiance  to  the  Dark  Sun,  while  others  re-

turned to their former alliance with the church of Bane. Two

prominent Cyricist temples in Faern, the Twin Towers of the

Eternal Eclipse in Amn and the House of Cyric in Skullport,

have banelar allies. Banelar nagas are also known to be work-

ing with the Cyricist western Zhentarim based in Darkhold,

but  whether  they  do  so  with  loyalty  or  as  agents  of  Fzoul

Chembryl is unknown.

Bone Naga

A bone naga is a skeletal undead creature created from a naga

by a spellcaster (usually of its own race). A create undead spell

can produce a bone naga from any naga subject with fewer Hit

Dice than the creator.

MONSTERS

A bone naga looks like a serpentine skeleton and typically mea-

sures about 12 feet long. Its skull bears an eerie resemblance to that

of a human, except that it sports long fangs. A cold, cruel light

burns in the creatures eye sockets, giving it an air of unspeakable

hatred and malice. Its tail ends in a vicious bone stinger.

Thought  it  despises  servitude,  a  bone  naga  unswervingly

obeys its creator, attacking even other nagas if so commanded.

Should its master die, the bone naga becomes free-willed and can

choose its own destiny.

Sample Bone Naga

This skeletal creature looks like a giant undead snake, except

for its humanlike skull and long, deadly fangs. Its tail ends

in a bony stinger.

Created by a rival hundred of years ago as a guard, this bone

naga despises both its master and its condition.

COMBAT

This bone nagas master is still alive and has ordered it to guard

the underground chambers where it performs magical research.

The bone naga always scans the minds of intruders to determine

their strengths and weaknesses before joining combat. It often

begins by trying to intimidate its enemies with telepathic taunts.

Thereafter, it resorts to spellcasting to soften up the more pow-

erful-looking opponents. When it  nally enters melee, it focuses

its attacks on living opponents rather than undead or constructs,

since the living are susceptible to its poison.

Poison (Ex): Bite, injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial and second-

ary damage 1d4 Str; or sting, injury, Fortitude DC 17, initial

and secondary damage 1d4 Con.

Spells: This bone naga casts spells as a 13th-level sorcerer.

Detect Thoughts (Su): The bone naga can continuously use

detect thoughts as the spell (caster level 9th; Will DC 17 negates).

This ability is always active.

Guarded Thoughts (Ex): The bone naga is immune to any

form of mind reading.

Resistance to Charm: The bone naga has a +2 racial bonus

on saving throws against all charm effects.

Undead Traits: A bone naga is immune to mind-in uencing

effects, poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death

effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it

also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical

hits,  nonlethal  damage,  ability  damage  to  its  physical  ability

scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death

from  massive  damage.  It  cannot  be  raised,  and  resurrection

works only if it is willing. Darkvision 60 ft.

A human-headed snake of immense size and power slithers

forth,  its  scales  nearly  identical  in  color  to  the  stones  that

surround it. Hatred gleams from its dark, penetrating eyes.

The  Faernian  ha-naga  is  a  massive  and  powerful  naga  lord,

often worshiped by spirit nagas as a god. It prefers to make its lair

in the ruins of an ancient civilizationspreferably one that it has

personally brought low. It usually establishes its nest in a former

center of society, such as a temple, a throne room, or a coliseum.

In this place, the ha-naga gathers together the treasures of the

lost society, piling up art,  ne jewelry, and the recorded history of

the civilization as tributes to its own devastating prowess.

A Faernian ha-naga is a gigantic snake with the head of

a classically beautiful human and a body that measures 100

feet or more in length. It has no set color; rather, its scales

adopt  the  hues  and  shades  of  its  surroundings,  much  like  a

chameleons do.

Ha-nagas speak Abyssal and Common.

COMBAT

Though it has no wings, a Faernian ha-naga can  y, winding

and  coiling  through  the  air  in  a  manner  similar  to  a  water

snakes motion. It uses this ability to its advantage in combat,

swirling  above  and  around  foes  while  using  its  gaze  attack  or

casting spells. Like its smaller serpentine cousins, a Faernian

ha-naga prefers to use spells in combat, resorting to melee only

when absolutely necessary. When it does engage foes directly, it

uses its coiled body like a whip, stings with its tail, and constricts

with its body.

Charming Gaze (Su): A Faernian ha-nagas gaze functions

like the mass charm spell against creatures within 90 feet (Will

DC 35 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Constrict  (Ex):  A  Faernian  ha-naga  deals  4d6+12  points

of damage with a successful grapple attack against a Huge or

smaller opponent.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a Faernian ha-naga

must hit with its coil whip attack. It can then attempt to start

a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

constrict.

Poison (Ex): Sting, Fortitude DC 33, initial and secondary

damage 2d8 Con. The save is Constitution-based.

Spells: A Faernian ha-naga can cast spells as a 21st-level

sorcerer, and can also cast spells from the cleric list and from

the Chaos and Evil domains. The cleric spells and domain spells

are considered arcane spells for a Faernian ha-naga, meaning

that it does not need a divine focus to cast them.

Typical  Spells  Known  (6/10/9/9/9/9/8/8/8/8;  save  DC  23

+10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

Flight  (Su):  A  Faernian  ha-naga  can   y  as  though  with

COMBAT

Like  a  hydra,  a  nagahydra  can

attack with all its heads at no pen-

alty, even if it moves or charges

during the round.

A  nagahydra  can  be  killed  ei-

ther  by  severing  all  its  heads  or  by

slaying its body. To sever a head, an opponent

must make a successful sunder attempt with a

slashing  weapon.  (The  player  should  declare  where  the  attack

is  aimed  before  making  the  attack  roll.)  Making  a  sunder  at-

tempt provokes an attack of opportunity unless the foe has the

Improved Sunder feat. An opponent can strike at a nagahydras

heads from any position in which he could strike at the nagahy-

dra itself because its heads writhe and whip about in combat. An

opponent can ready an action to attempt to sunder a nagahydras

head when the creature bites at him.

Each of a nagahydras heads has hit points equal to the crea-

tures full normal hit point total, divided by 5. Since a normal

nagahydra has 174 hit points, 34 or more points of damage

severs a head (174  5 = 34.8, rounded down to 34). A natu-

ral re ex seals the neck shut to prevent further blood loss. A

nagahydra can no longer attack with a severed head but takes

no other penalties. A severed nagahydra head grows back from

a stump in 1d4 rounds. The application of at least 5 points of

acid or  re damage to a stump (touch attack required to hit)

prevents  a  stump  from  regrowing  for  24  hours.  A   aming

weapon (or similar effect) deals its energy damage to the stump

in the same blow in which a head is severed. Fire or acid dam-

age from an area effect (such as a  reball or dragon breath)

may burn multiple stumps in addition to dealing damage to

the nagahydras body. A nagahydra does not die from losing

its heads until all of them have been cut off and the stumps

seared by  re or acid.

A nagahydras body can be slain just like any other crea-

tures,  but  nagahydras  possess  fast  healing  and  thus  are

dif cult to defeat in this fashion. Any attack that is not (or

cannot be) an attempt to sunder a head affects the body. For

example, area effects deal damage to a nagahydras body, not to

its heads. Targeted magical effects cannot sever a nagahydras

heads (and thus must be directed at the body) unless they deal

slashing damage and could be used to make sunder attempts.

Poison (Ex): Bite, injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial and second-

ary damage 1d12 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spells:  Nagahydras  cast  spells  as  15th-level  sorcerers,  and

can also cast spells from the cleric list and from the Destruc-

tion and Scalykind domains. A nagahydra can cast one spell per

round per head, but all spells come from the common pool of

spells available.

A nagahydra has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to per-

form some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose

to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a

straight line.

Feats: A nagahydras Combat Re exes feat allows it to use all

its heads for attacks of opportunity.

IN THE REALMS

Nagahydras  are  most  frequently  encoun-

tered in the depths of the Jungles of Chult

and the Mhair Jungles. Recent reports of

a nest of nagas haunting the depths of the

Qurth  Forest  may  in  fact  stem  from  the

presence  of  a  nagahydra  lairing  in  the

ruins of an overgrown city.

wild  and  as  pets.  Scalykind  creatures  often  employ  niferns  as

hunters, trackers, and loyal guardians.

A nifern is a scaled quadruped with a head that looks like an

odd cross between a lizards and a canines. It has no eyes, and its

oversized jaws are studded with sharp fangs. Its tail looks similar

to that of an ordinary dog except that it ends in a stinger and is

carried above the back, like a scorpions.

Naturally blind, a nifern uses its other senses to provide the

information that eyes normally would. Its keen sense of smell

not only aids in tracking, but also helps it differentiate friends

from foes on the battle eld.

Niferns  are  normally  kept  in  small  groups,  although  they

have  been  known  to  form  packs  of  thirty  or  more

individuals  in  the  wild,  menacing  all  who  enter  their

territory. The largest and strongest nifern normally leads

a pack. A niferns drive for food and its voracious

appetite  lead  it  to  attack  nearly  everything  it

encounters.

Combat

Niferns  prefer  to  attack  their  prey

in  numbers,  but  their  tactics  are

fairly  straightforward.  They  rush

head-on  into  battle  and  sting  to

immobilize  their  prey.  Creatures

that  prove  resistant  to  the  poison

are  attacked  with  vicious  claws  and

powerful jaws.

Niferns are the scaly equivalents of hunting dogs. Though native

to the Underdark, many of them exist aboveground, both in the

Hold  Breath  (Ex):  A  nifern  can  hold  its  breath  for  a

number  of  rounds  equal  to  four  times  its  Constitution

Skills: *Because of its keen sense of smell and natural instinct

for  tracking,  a  nifern  receives  a  +5  racial  bonus  on  Survival

In the Realms

Niferns are the hunting animals of choice among scalykind, fa-

vored by lizardfolk, troglodytes, dragonkin, and others. Because

niferns can also bond with Scaleless Ones, they are also popular

throughout the Underdark, where they are employed as trackers

by the illithids, a few drow, and members of other notoriously

evil races.

A snake with the upper torso of a human weaves in place,

its red eyes gleaming with menace. It clutches a trident in its

clawed hands.

The sarrukh constitute one of the  ve original progenitor races

of Faern. In their three great empires, the sarrukh created a

plethora  of  scaly  races,  including  the  nagas,  the  yuan-ti,  and

the lizardfolk.

MONSTERS

An individual sarrukhs body may be either bipedal or snake-

like. A snakelike sarrukh has a serpentine body and head, plus

two powerful arms that end in vicious claws. A bipedal sarrukh

has a humanoid upper torso, head, arms, and legs with a snake-

like lower torso. The gleaming red eyes of a sarrukh strike fear

into the hearts of all other Scaled Ones. Both variants share the

same statistics.

Sarrukh speak their own language, called Sarrukhar, which

bears some similarities to Draconic. Any creature that speaks

Draconic  can  make  a  DC  15  Intel-

ligence  check  to  communicate  with  a

sarrukh.  Failure  indicates  only  partial

understanding.

Combat

Because of their slowly shrinking numbers, the sar-

rukh believe that the survival of each individual

is absolutely essential. This outlook causes them

to avoid combat at all costs and surround them-

selves with other scaled creatures that can  ght

for them. Since not a single sarrukh is expendable, any

creature that kills one makes enemies of them all.

When   ghting  is  unavoidable,  a  sarrukhs

primary focus is always escape rather than

victory. It typically begins combat with

a spell-like ability that deals damage

to a number of combatants simul-

taneously reball  if  the  area  is

relatively open, or lightning bolt

if its opponents are approaching

from a hallway or some other con-

 ning area. It follows with a wall of

force to prevent opponents from reach-

ing it, then attempts to teleport away as soon

as possible thereafter. If teleport isnt an option,

a sarrukh may use polymorph to change into a small animal

and scurry away from the battle. Sarrukh enter melee combat

only if death appears to be unavoidable.

Sarrukh

Fear Aura (Su): As a free action, a sarrukh can create an aura

of fear in a 10-foot radius. This effect is otherwise identical to

the fear spell (caster level 14th; save DC 21). A creature that

succeeds on the save cannot be affected again by that sarrukhs

fear aura for 24 hours. Other sarrukh are immune to this aura.

The DC is Charisma-based.

Poison (Ex): Bite, injury, Fortitude DC 22, initial and second-

ary damage 1d6 Con.

Manipulate Form (Su): At will, a sarrukh can modify the

form of any Scaled One native to Toril, except for aquatic and

undead creatures. With a successful touch attack, it can cause

one alteration of its choice in the target creatures body. The

target  falls  unconscious  for  2d4  rounds  due  to  the  shock  of

changing form. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save negates both

the change and the unconsciousness. Sarrukh are immune to

this effect.

A sarrukh may use this ability to change a minor aspect of

the target creature, such as the shape of its head or the color of

its scales. It may also choose to make a much more signi cant

alteration,  such  as  converting  limbs  into  tentacles,  changing

overall body shape (snake to humanoid, for example), or adding

or removing an appendage. Any ability score may be decreased

to a minimum of 1 or increased to a maximum equal to the

sarrukhs  corresponding  score.  A  sarrukh  may  also  grant  the

target  an  extraordinary,  supernatural,  or  spell-like  ability  or

remove one from it.

The change bestowed takes effect immediately and is perma-

nent. Furthermore, the alterations are automatically passed on

to all the creatures offspring when it breeds with another of its

unmodi ed kind.

Typical physical alterations that sarrukh often bestow with

this ability include the following.

Arm: The touched creature sprouts a humanlike arm that

ends in a viciously clawed hand. The sarrukh may, at its option,

change an already existing appendage (such as a tentacle) into

an arm, or cause a new arm to sprout from a spot of its choice.

The  creature  can  manipulate  small  items  and  wield  weapons

with the new appendage as effectively as a normal human can

with a hand. The creature also gains a claw attack as a natural

attack (base damage 1d8 for a Medium creature). The claw is a

secondary attack if the subject already has a different primary

attack, or primary otherwise.

Leg: The touched creature sprouts a humanlike leg. The sar-

rukh may, at its option, change an already existing appendage

(such as a tentacle) into a leg, or cause a new leg to sprout from

a spot of its choice. A pair of such legs gives the creature the

ability to walk upright, and four legs give it the ability to move

like a quadruped. The creature loses any ability it previously had

to constrict with its lower body. Its speed remains the same as it

was before the alteration unless it now has more than two legs.

In that case, it moves at a speed typical for a quadruped of its

size category.

Tentacles: The touched creature sprouts a tentacle. The sar-

rukh may, at its option, change an already existing appendage

(such as an arm) into a tentacle, or cause a new tentacle to sprout

from  a  spot  of  its  choice.  The  subject  can  now  wield  a  melee

weapon  in  each  tentacle  acquired.  Furthermore,  the  creature

gains a slam attack as a natural attack (base damage 1d8 for

a Medium creature). The tentacle is a secondary attack if the

subject already has a different primary attack, or primary oth-

erwise. The subject also acquires the improved grab special attack

if it didnt already have it.

Humanoid  Torso:  A  humanoid  torso  replaces  the  subjects

previous  torso.  The  subject  loses  any  special  attack  or  special

quality  dependent  on  its  previous  torso  (such  as  constrict  or

improved grab).

Snake  Torso:  A  snake  torso  replaces  the  subjects  previous

torso, granting it the constrict and improved grab special attacks

if it didnt already have them. Its speed remains the same as it

was before the alteration.

Wings:  The  subject  sprouts  feathery  wings  from  its  back.

These appendages grant it the ability to  y at its previous land

speed with average maneuverability.

Omnidirectional Eyes: The subject can move its eyes indepen-

dently from one another and visually process all the information

so acquired. The creature gains a +4 bonus on Spot checks but

takes a 2 penalty to Charisma.

Increase or Decrease Size: The subjects size category changes

by one step. All the usual bonuses or penalties for such a change

apply normally (see page 291 in the Monster Manual).

Spell-Like  Abilities:  3/daydisrupt  undead,  identify,

invisibility, knock, magic missile, misdirection (DC 16), see in-

visibility, sleep (DC 15); 2/dayconfusion (DC 18),  reball (DC

17), lightning bolt (DC 17), polymorph; 1/dayteleport (DC 19),

wall of force. Caster level 14th.

In the Realms

The  sarrukh  were  the  overlords  of  the   rst  civilizations  ever

to  rise  in  Toril.  In  cities  both  above-  and  belowground,  they

altered the lesser scaled races via breeding and magic to create

numerous servitor races.

The  many  experiments  that  the  sarrukh  performed  upon

their  nest creations, the yuan-ti, resulted in the wildly diver-

gent forms of that race. The lizardfolk and the other lesser races

were rarely the subjects of magical experimentation, though they

performed the bulk of the hard labor.

Today, thousands of years after the fall of their mighty civi-

lizations, the sarrukh are all but extinct. The few that remain

spend  much  of  their  time  in  hibernation,  but  when  they  do

interact with the outside world, they usually work to advance

the welfare of the creatures they created, which now thrive in

their stead.

This automaton like a grisly assortment of decaying serpentine

body parts grafted together into a gruesome form. Its massive

arms end in wicked claws, and it smells of decaying meat.

Serpent esh golems are often created by spellcasters with grudg-

es  against  the  Scaled  Ones.  Such  individuals

take a cruel pleasure in forcing serpents

to bend to their will, even if it is only

after death.

A  golem  of  this  sort  is  a  scaly,

vaguely humanoid creature that has

been crafted from the body parts of

various Scaled Ones. It bears a super cial

resemblance to a  esh golem in that the points

where the  esh of different creatures has been joined

are usually obvious. A serpent esh golem has a snake

torso with massive arms that end in clawed hands

and either a tail or a pair of humanlike legs.

COMBAT

A serpent esh golem is more dexterous than

most other golems, and it uses this speed to

advantage  in  combat.  It  typically  begins  a

battle  with  slam  attacks  using  either  its

arms  or  its  tail.  It  saves  its  bite  attack

for opponents that prove resistant to its

raw brutality.

Construct Traits: A serpent-

breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage

for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal.

If the amount of healing would cause the serpent esh golem to

exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary

hit points. For example, a serpent esh golem hit by a lightning

bolt heals 3 points of damage if the attack would have dealt 11

points of damage. It gets no saving throw against attacks that

deal electricity damage.

Construction

The parts for a serpent esh golem must all come from normal

scaly corpses that have not decayed signi cantly. At least one

body is needed per desired limb, plus one for the torso and one

for the brain. Special unguents and bindings worth 500 gp are

also required. Each additional arm beyond two raises the cost

by 5,000 gp and 100 XP. Creating a serpent esh golem requires

casting a spell with the evil descriptor.

Assembling the body requires a DC 13 Craft (leatherwork-

ing) check or a DC 13 Heal check.

CL  8th;  Craft  Construct  (see  page  303  in  the  Monster

Manual), animate dead, bulls strength, geas/quest, limited wish,

caster must be at least 8th level; Price 20,000 gp; Cost 10,500

gp + 780 XP (or more, see above).

In the Realms

Much  less  common  than   esh  golems,  serpent esh  golems

almost always serve evil masters as guardians. The yuan-ti, the

sarrukh, and other serpent races consider them perversions and

almost never use them. Anyone creating a serpent esh golem is

likely to be attacked by other serpent races when the creatures

existence is discovered.

Snakes

The Serpent Kingdoms are home to a wide variety of snakes,

some of which are seen only rarely.

Skills:  A  snake  has  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide,  Listen,

and Spot checks and a +8 racial bonus on Balance and Climb

checks.

A snake can always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even

if rushed or threatened.

A  snake  uses  either  its  Strength  modi er  or  its  Dexterity

modi er for Climb checks, whichever is higher.

A brown, unpleasant-looking snake clad in a layer of slime

rests atop a dung heap, its tongue  icking in and out.

Dung snakes thrive amid muck and decay. In cold conditions,

they  burrow  deep  into  compost  piles,  cesspools,  and  similar

sources  of  warmth,  emerging  only  when  disturbed  or  when

warm weather returns. This habit gives dung snakes a fearsome

folk reputation.

A  dung  snake  is  a  water-dwelling  constrictor  snake  with

brown scales. It exudes a slimy, odoriferous substance that gives

its body a sheen.

Dung snakes are among the creatures that a spellcaster can

take as a normal (not improved) familiar. A dung snake familiar

grants its master a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease.

COMBAT

The dung snake kills by holding its prey underwater while con-

stricting.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a dung snake

deals 1d3+4 points of damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a dung snake must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Environmental Adaptation (Ex): Dung snakes can exude a

protective slime around themselves, protecting them from non-

lethal cold damage.

Skills:  In  addition  to  the  racial  skill  bonuses  noted  for  all

snakes above, a dung snake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided

it swims in a straight line.

A brown-furred serpent leaps forth to sting a hapless animal

with its tail, then bites with a ring of fearsome teeth around

its mouth.

The internal processes of this rare, furred reptile keep it warm

enough to function in snow and ice. A fearless predator of the

glaciers, it comes down into the lowlands only during severe win-

ter weather. There is no such thing as a satiated glacier snake; the

creature eats endlessly as long as food is available. If unchecked,

a single snake can devour every member of an adventuring band

or nomadic tribe without stopping.

A glacier snakes 12-foot body is covered with a thick, brown

pelt of fur instead of scales. Its razor-sharp teeth surround its

mouth in a ring, and it has a bony stinger at the tip of its tail.

The thick, soft pelt of a glacier snake is prized by garment

makers.

COMBAT

A  glacier  snake  has  no  venom,  but  its  tail  ends  in  a  bone

stinger that it uses to stab enemies in combat. When wounded,

it  depends  on  its  fast  healing  ability  to  remain  alive.  Many

adventurers  have  been  surprised  to  see  its  blood  escaping  as

steam from a wound.

IN THE REALMS

Glacier  snakes  are  most  common  amidst  the  mountains  of

the Spine of the World, in the Cold Vale of northern Luruar,

on the High Ice of Anauroch, and along the southern edge

of  the  Great  Glacier.  In  addition,  they  have  recently  been

spotted on the Glacier of the White Worm by the monks of

the Monastery of the Yellow Rose, but it is unclear whether

the creatures are long-standing inhabitants of that region or

recent introductions.

Thin  as  a  flower  stem,  a  delicate-looking  viper  slithers

through the long grass of the plain.

Reed snakes spend most of the day below thick grass cover, hunt-

ing only at night. They sometimes attack sleeping humanoids,

often killing them with their unusually virulent poison.

A reed snake measures between 2 and 4 feet in length. Its

incredibly thin body is covered with dull green scales.

Reed snakes are among the creatures that a spellcaster can

take as a normal (not improved) familiar. A reed snake familiar

grants its master a +2 bonus on saving throws against poison.

COMBAT

The  reed  snake  relies  on  its  venomous  bite  to  kill  prey  and

defend itself.

Poison  (Ex):  Bite,  Fortitude  DC  12;  initial  and  secondary

damage 1d6 Constitution. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A  dun-colored  serpent  moves  slowly  through  the

swamp  muck,  its  oversized  fangs  gleaming  in  the

moonlight.

Sewerms are water snakes that have adapted to living in sewers

and swamps. They feed on warm blood in a fashion similar

to leeches.

A sewerm has tan and brown scales in a reticulated pattern and

a mottled green underbelly. It can grow to a length of 8 feet.

Sewerms are among the creatures that a spellcaster can take

as a normal (not improved) familiar. A sewerm familiar grants

its master a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause

pain (such as a symbol of pain).

COMBAT

Unless threatened, sewerms attack only warm-blooded creatures.

A sewerm typically attaches to a victims limb (preferably one

that extends underwater) with a bite attack, then wraps its body

around  the  limb.  Once  so  secured,  it  begins  draining  blood.

Because of the anesthetic secretions a sewerm secretes from its

fangs and skin, most victims are unaware of its presence. The

creature can also coil itself up and spring out of the water to

strike a target that cannot be attacked below the water (such as

a humanoid wearing hip boots).

Attach (Ex): If a sewerm hits with a bite attack, it latches

onto the opponents body and is effectively grappling its prey.

The sewerm loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of

14. A sewerm has a +16 racial bonus on grapple checks (already

 gured into the Base Attack/Grapple entry above).

An attached sewerm can be struck with a weapon or grappled

itself.  To  remove  an  attached  sewerm  through  grappling,  the

opponent must achieve a pin against it.

Blood Drain (Ex): A sewerm drains blood, dealing automatic

bite damage in any round when it begins its turn attached to a

victim. Once it has dealt 30 points of damage, it detaches and

 ees to digest the meal.

Poison (Ex): A sewerms venom is actually an anesthetic

oil  secreted  through  its  skin  and  fangs.  This  oil  pre-

vents  its  target  from  feeling  pain  at  the  point  of

contact, even if it is taking hit point damage. The sewerm uses

this oil to prevent its victims from noticing its presence while

it feeds.

Bite, injury or contact, Fortitude DC 11; initial and second-

ary damage anesthetic. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Skills:  In  addition  to  the  racial  skill  bonuses  noted  for  all

snakes above, a sewerm has +8 racial bonus on Jump checks, and

its racial bonus on Hide checks is +8 instead of +4. It also has

a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some special

action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run

action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

IN THE REALMS

Sewerms are often found in the sewers of Waterdeep and the

fouled, fetid waters of the swamps in the northern Sword Coast

(including Mere of Dead Men and Stump Bog). The creatures

are  considered  dangerous  nuisances  by  Waterdeeps  Cellarers

and  Plumbers  Guild  but  are  highly  prized  by  the  Guild  of

Apothecaries and Physicians for the pain-deadening effects of

their venom.

A  faint  hissing  sound  and  a  slithering  movement  suggest

the presence of an unseen serpentine predator. Suddenly, the

 ash of fangs from a leafy branch reveals the location of the

crawling death.

Many different sorts of tree-hunting constrictors are called tree

pythons, but the most numerous in Faern is the one native to

the Serpent Hills.

The natural hue of this intelligent, tree-lurking constrictor

snake is a dull, greenish-brown, but its chameleon power allows it

to blend in constantly with its surroundings. Its hue alters swiftly

and  automatically  to  match  its  surroundings,  scale  by  scale.

Thus, its protruding head might be sky blue, its midsection the

green of leaves, and its rear the brown shade of a branch. These

colors alter as it moves, keeping pace with its backgrounds.

COMBAT

Tree pythons are intelligent hunters that never forget previous

experiences. They are wise enough to drop onto the last creature

in a passing group, choose isolated targets, and avoid falling onto

glinting metal. Tree pythons usually hunt by night and sleep by

day, but they have been known to follow promising prey tire-

lessly, keeping pace and attacking it later while it slumbers.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a tree python

deals 1d3+4 points of damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tree python must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Chameleon Scales (Ex): Because of its ever-changing scales,

a  tree  python  blends  in  with  its  surroundings,  gaining  a  +10

circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

Spring  (Ex):  A  tree  python  can  gather  its  coils  and  then

launch itself in a jump. The Jump DCs for both long jumps and

high jumps are halved, and no running start is required. Fur-

thermore, when jumping down, the tree python takes damage as

if it had dropped 90 fewer feet than it actually did.

Skills:  In  addition  to  the  racial  skill  bonuses  noted  for  all

snakes above, a tree python has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided

it swims in a straight line.

IN THE REALMS

Though they are most common in the Serpent Hills, tree py-

thons have spread quickly throughout Faern. They seize any

opportunity to drop onto a passing wagon, ride cargo lashed

to packbeasts, and even cling to ropes with their jaws so as to be

dragged along. Some have even ridden the harnesses of  ying

steeds  in  this  manner.  Tree  pythons  dont  seem  to  suffer  any

pain or disability from holding on with their jaws for hours or

even  days,  though  extreme  cold  causes  them  to  drop  off  and

search for warmer surroundings.

Tree pythons are smart enough to know when theyre vulner-

able. When wounded or in an exposed position, they seek to  ee

and hide rather than face certain death.

An  up-and-down,  whiplike  motion  reveals  the  presence  of  a

brown, serpentine creature moving through the marshland.

This  slender  constrictor  snake  sometimes  moves  through

tangled growth or across mud or quicksand by  ailing its coils

in the rapid, arching, wriggling movement from which it gained

its name. This creature is unrelated to the similar but smaller

snakes that live in the deserts and warm plains, and the so-called

striped whipsnakes that dont constrict.

A whipsnakes scales are primarily brown, with a mottling of

deep green and black. Its head is angular and broad.

COMBAT

Whipsnakes usually lurk on sturdy tree branches, ready to drop

or  slither  onto  creatures  passing  underneath.  However,  they

have also been known to lie on the ground, stretched across a

trail amid fallen tree branches, waiting to coil around the legs

of creatures using the path and trip them. A whipsnakes  rst

attack is always a coil slam.

Coil Slam (Ex): A whipsnake can whip its body against an

opponent (+5 melee), dealing 1d4 points of damage on a success-

ful hit. In addition, the target must make a DC 12 Re ex save

to escape the coils. Failure means the opponent lands prone in its

square, and the whipsnake automatically establishes a hold on it

and can constrict as if it had made a successful grapple check.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a whipsnake

deals 1d6+4 points of damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a whipsnake must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Skills:  In  addition  to  the  racial  skill  bonuses  noted  for  all

snakes above, a whipsnake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can

always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or

endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided

it swims in a straight line.

IN THE REALMS

Whipsnakes are common in the Serpent Hills area of Faern

and are rapidly spreading to other regions as well. They have

resilient scales that dont dry out after they are shed, so their

hides are often salvaged for use in covering belts, purses, and as

trim for clothing. Most serpent-scale fabric consists of whip-

snake-hide that has been oiled, painted, and then heated to bake

the painted hues and oiled iridescence into the scales.

Resembling  a  lizardfolk  but  much

more powerful, this scaled human-

oid stands with a greatsword at

the ready.

The  yuan-ti  created  the  powerful,

semi-aquatic  trens  by  crossing  lizard-

folk  with  troglodytes.  The  results  were

stronger  than  typical  specimens

from  either  race.  Trens  prefer

to  live  underground  in  envi-

ronments  that  are  dark,

cold, and wet, often in

the  same  settle-

ments  with

troglodytes.

A  tren  is

a  lizardlike  creature  about  the

same height as a human. It has muscu-

lar  limbs  and  walks  erect,  trailing  a  long,

slender  tail  behind  it.  Its  lizardlike  head

features a wide jaw and a mouth  lled

with razor-sharp teeth.

Combat

Trens  prefer  to

wear light armor

and  use  steel

weapons.  Their

melee  weapon  of  choice

is  the  greatsword,  though

most  also  carry  longbows

for  striking  from  a  distance.

Though they prefer melee com-

bat  to  ranged,  they  typically

attack in organized formations, adjust-

ing their tactics to suit their environment. Because they

almost never possess magic, one or two archers normally

stay behind the  ghters to distract spellcasters.

Tren

Stench (Ex): When a tren is angry or frightened, it secretes

an oily, musklike chemical that nearly every form of animal life

 nds  offensive.  Every  living  creature  (except  other  trens  and

troglodytes) within 30 feet of a tren must succeed on a DC 14

Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. A creature subject-

ed to stench from multiple trens makes only one saving throw,

though  a  separate  save  is  necessary  for  any  troglodyte  stench

present. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by

the same trens stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize

poison spell removes the effect. Creatures immune to poison are

unaffected, and a creature resistant to poison receives its normal

bonus on the saving throw.

88

Skills:  The  scales

of  a  tren  can

change  color,  al-

lowing it to blend in with its

surroundings  like  a  chameleon  and

conferring a +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks.  *In  rocky  or  subterranean  set-

tings,  this  bonus  improves

to +8.

In the Realms

Trens  can  be  found  in

a  number  of  differ-

ent  locations.  They  are

accepted  in  many  trog-

lodyte  communities  and

treated as equals there, al-

though  they  almost  never

become tribal leaders. They

are often kept as slaves, pri-

marily by illithids and other

Underdark races that need guards,

fighting  forces,  or  assassins.

Trens  can  also  be  found  serving

their  creators,  the  yuan-ti.  On

their  own,  they  sometimes  form

small  mercenary  bands  or  raid-

ing  parties.

The  holy  guardian  is  rare  kind  of  yuan-ti

bred  to  guard  temples  and  altars  of  Sseth.

Unless  ordered  to  do  something  else  by  a

yuan-ti cleric of Sseth personally known

to  them,  holy  guardians  defend  the

sacred  places  and  property  placed

in  their  trust  with  alert  diligence

and  dedicationto  the  death  if

necessary.

A holy guardian resembles a yuan-ti half-

blood with its serpent head, human arms,

and serpent tail. It stands about 7 feet tall

when rearing upright and weighs about

270 pounds. Its dark scales lighten

only  slightly  toward  the  tail

and are always of uniform hue,

never patterned or lighter on the

underbelly.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  At  willanimal  trance  (DC  15),

cause fear (DC 15), entangle (DC 15); 3/daydeeper dark-

ness, dispel magic, neutralize poison (DC 18), resist energy (self

only), suggestion (DC 17); 1/daybaleful polymorph (DC 19;

into  snake  form  only).  Caster  level  11th.  The  save  DCs  are

Charisma-based.

Venomous Tentacles (Sp): Once per day, a holy guardian can

produce an effect that functions like the Evards black tentacles

spell, except that the tentacles also deliver poison (contact, Forti-

tude DC 21, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con) during each

round of grappling. This ability is the equivalent of an

8th-level spell.

Alternate Form (Sp): A holy guardian

can  assume  the  form  of  a  Tiny  to

Large  viper  (see  the  Snake  entry  on

page 280 of the Monster Manual) as

a psionic ability. This ability is similar

to a polymorph spell (caster level 19th), but

the  holy  guardian  doesnt  regain  any  lost

hit  points  by  changing  form  and  can  take

only viper shapes. The holy guardian loses its

constrict ability in viper form but uses its own

poison for its bite attack.

Chameleon  Power  (Sp):  A  holy  guardian  can

psionically change the coloration of itself and

its equipment to match its surroundings,

gaining a +10 circumstance bonus on

Hide checks.

Detect Poison (Sp): A holy guard-

ian can use detect poison as the spell

(caster level 6th) at will.

Skills: A holy guardian receives

a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks

and can always choose to take 10

Holy  guardians  speak  Abyssal,  Common,  Draconic,  and

Yuan-ti.

Combat

A  holy  guardian   ghts  cunningly,  seeking  cover  and  ceding

areas as needed in order to encircle, out ank, or otherwise trap

intruders.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a holy guard-

ian deals 1d6+6 points of damage.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  holy  guardian

must  hit  with  its  bite  attack.  It  can  then  attempt  to  start  a

grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of oppor-

tunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can

constrict.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Yuan-ti holy guardian

on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened.

A holy guardian has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check

to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endan-

gered.  It  can  use  the  run  action  while  swimming,  provided  it

swims in a straight line.

In the Realms

Holy guardians are occasionally sent on hunting expeditions

to  nd food for clerics of Sseth or supplies for a temple, or to

recover stolen temple wealth. Otherwise, they are found only

in holy sites. Their typical standing orders are to capture in-

truders if possible so that the clergy of Sseth can interrogate

them. Should capture prove infeasible, intruders are slain with-

out hesitation.

Holy  guardians  are  trained  from  hatching  to  obey  clerics

of Sseth  rst, and family or tribal elders second. Unlike most

yuan-ti, they do not spend the majority of their time scheming

against others, but they arent stupid either. Holy guardians of-

ten discuss among themselves the prudence of (and philosophy

behind) orders that theyve been given, as well as the motives

and worth of their superiors.

These yuan-ti disobey clerics of Sseth only when their orders

are clearly against temple teachings, or foolishly endanger other

clergy or holy items. If faced with con icting orders from differ-

ent clerics of Sseth, they obey the cleric they believe to be wiser

or more worthy, regardless of rank.

Holy guardians are not magically or psionically compelled

to obey anyone, and they are considered apart from tribal hi-

erarchy and authority. Thus, in practice, they are above the

orders of even tribal leaders. Holy guardians are reluctant to

attack or discipline other holy guardians and refuse to do so

unless they personally believe the offender has gone rogue

never merely because a cleric of Sseth orders it. (Such a cleric

is obviously mistakenly ordering the destruction of holy prop-

erty, which Sseth himself trusts and expects holy guardians to

guard). A holy guardians preferred class is yuan-ti cultist (see

Savage Species).

A serpent with human arms and a human head rears back,

its serpent eyes glittering with malice. A streak of eldritch

energy streams from its outstretched  nger.

Mageslayers were bred by certain yuan-ti elders concerned about

the rising magical vigor of humans in Faern. Believing that the

vrael olo needed their own spellcasters to effectively  ght the

menace  stemming  from  every  stinking  Scaleless  One  having

spells enough to blast down scores of us, they produced a kind

of yuan-ti with innate spell ability.

A mageslayer looks like a slightly larger version of a yuan-ti

halfblood with human arms and a serpent tail. A typical speci-

men has a human head, though its tongue is forked and its eyes

have vertical pupils, like a serpents. It stands about 7 feet tall

when rearing upright and weighs about 270 pounds. Mageslay-

ers have a wide variety of scale patterning and hues in their

natural states.

Mageslayers  speak  Abyssal,  Common,  Draconic,  and

Yuan-ti.

Combat

Yuan-ti mageslayers are trained for spell battles by the Coiled

Cabal even if they arent members, and they thoroughly under-

stand the side effects and unorthodox uses of their spells. Theyre

used to hurling spells so as not to endanger allies in a fast-mov-

ing fray, and they are quick to set up traps and take advantage

of cover and deception where possible.

The  Coiled  Cabal  teaches  that  a  mageslayer  life  lost  is  a

wound felt by all vrael olo, a waste that weakens the race and

must therefore be avoided. As cabal leaders put it, A valiant

hero is a human fool. Thus, a mageslayer saves its own scales

 rst,  eeing to  ght another day.

Mageslayers typically arrange ambushes so their dimension

door  abilities  can  whisk  them  to  a  waiting  boat,  inaccessible

cave mouth, balcony, or cliffside ledge for easy escape should a

 ght go against them. Though ruthless in battle, they follow

orders when it comes to capturing prisoners alive, recovering

items, and avoiding damage to the surroundings. Like other

yuan-ti, they admire the skulker more than the tower-toppling

 reball- hurler.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a mageslayer

deals 1d6+6 points of damage.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a mageslayer must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can constrict.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 16, initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willanimal trance (DC 15), cause

fear  (DC  15),  conceal  thoughts  (self  only),  entangle  (DC  15);

3/daydeeper darkness, greater dispel magic, neutralize poison

(DC 18), protection from energy (self only), suggestion (DC 17);

Detect Poison (Sp): A holy guardian can use detect poison as

the spell (caster level 6th) at will.

Skills:  A  mageslayer  receives  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even

if rushed or threatened.

A mageslayer has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to

perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a  hazard.  It  can  always

choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endan-

gered.  It  can  use  the  run  action  while  swimming,  provided  it

swims in a straight line.

In the Realms

Yuan-ti mageslayers are the strike leaders of the Coiled Cabal.

Thanks to the wide variety of cabal missions and interests, they

may be found anywhere in Faern. They always

receive the best of intelligence from other

yuan-ti  about  the  laws,  politics,  and

current events of any area they venture

into, and they behave accordingly.

Mageslayers  often  hide  when

they  must  go  among  humans  by

wearing  plate  armor  or  extensive  ban-

dages  that  leave  their  heads  exposed.

Many pretend to be mortally wounded

heroes  kept  alive  magically  so  that

they can ride home to die.

Mageslayers  are  often  sent  to

deal  with  humanoid  spellcasters

who are harming or threatening

vrael  olo  or  their  intrigues  and

businesses.  At  least  one  mageslayer

is  always  present  at  any  open  battle

between humans and yuan-ti in which

the scaly side has had time to prepare

its forces.

1/daybaleful polymorph (DC 19; into snake form only), di-

mensional anchor (DC 15), dimension door (self and equipment

only), protection from spells. Caster level 14th. The save DCs are

Charisma-based.

Spells: A yuan-ti mageslayer casts arcane spells as an 8th-

level sorcerer, but its effective caster level is 14th. It may not

take any spellcasting prestige class.

Typical Sorcerer Spells Known (6/7/7/6/3; save DC 13 + spell

level): 0acid splash, arcane mark, dancing lights, detect magic,

mage hand, message, open/close, read magic; 1stalarm, burn-

ing hands, disguise self, mage armor, unseen servant; 2ndbulls

strength,  cats  grace,  invisibility;  3rddispel  magic,   reball;

4thscrying.

Venomous Tentacles (Sp): Once per day, a mageslayer can

produce an effect that functions like the Evards black tentacles

spell, except that the tentacles also deliver poison (contact, For-

titude DC 21, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con) during

each round of grappling. This ability is the equivalent of

an 8th-level spell.

Alternate Form (Sp): A mageslayer can assume the

form of a Tiny to Large viper (see the Snake entry

on page 280 of the Monster Manual)

as a psionic ability. This ability

is  similar  to  a  polymorph  spell

(caster level 19th), but the mag-

eslayer  doesnt  regain  any  lost

hit points by changing form and

can  assume  only  viper  shapes.

The  mageslayer  loses  its  con-

strict  ability  in  viper  form  but

uses  its  own  poison  for  its  bite

attack.

Chameleon  Power

(Sp):

A  mageslayer  can  psionically

change  the  coloration  of  itself

and  its  equipment  to  match  its

surroundings, gaining a +10 cir-

cumstance bonus on Hide checks.

Mageslayers  can  control  this

power  far  more  precisely  than

other yuan-ti, and they often use

it to make a badge appear on their scales when

participating in complex battles or missions, or to shift the hues

of their scales so as to give mute signals (agreed-upon beforehand

with their fellows), such as Enemy near, or I sense magic.

the gamut from desolate swamps claimed by small

bands of lizardfolk to the remnants of the vast and

decadent empire of the yuan-ti. This chapter describes some of

the most notorious, important, and incredible realms of Scaled

Ones. In many of these areas, Scaled Ones rule openly, not from

Hlondeth

(City of Serpents)

Capitol: Hlondeth

Population: 453,600 (humans 84% [Chondathans 56%, Turami

41%, Shaarans 3%], kobolds 15%, yuan-ti 1%)

Government: Monarchy

Religions:  Cult  of  the  Dragon,  Ilmater,  Llira,  Talona,  Talos,

Tempus, Tyr, Varae (Sseth [now Set])

Imports: Slaves, timber, weapons

Exports: Basalt, green marble, seafood, statuary, wines

Alignment: N, LN, LG, LE, NE, CE

The City of Serpents lies on the northern shore of the Vilhon

Reach, opposite Sespech, in the shadow of Mount Ugruth. This

port city is linked to Alaghn via the Halondar, and to Ormath

via the Pikemans Folly. Hlondeth claims all the lands within 50

miles of the citys walls, including a dozen or so minor villages

and seemingly endless vineyards.

Life and Society

Despite  the  omnipresent  in uence  of  the  serpentfolk,  life  in

the City of Serpents is not unlike that in other cities along the

shores of the Vilhon Reach. Trade is king, ritualized combat is

glori ed, nature (particularly all things serpentine) is accorded

its  due,  and  arcane  spellcasters  are  regarded  with  suspicion.

Members of the kobold underclass are treated as either slaves

or vermin.

Hlondeth is ruled with a light hand by Dediana Extaminos

(LE  female  halfblood  yuan-ti  sorcerer  10),  the  matriarch  of

House Extaminos, who has a snakes tail and no legs. Her current

mate is First Consort Ssibalentanamas (CE spirit naga cleric 11

of Sseth [now Set]), also known as First Keeper of the Sacred

Eggs. Ssibalentanamas slithers through the length and breadth

of Hlondeths catacombs, guarding yuan-ti brood chambers.

Dedianas heir is Dmetrio Extaminos (LE male pureblood

yuan-ti   ghter  7),  who  is  af anced  to  Glsena  Foesmasher,

eldest daughter of Baron Thuragar of Sespech. Besides serving

as  Hlondeths  ambassador  to  Sespech,  Dmetrio  secretly  leads

the Hlondethan cell of the Cult of the Dragon. He uses the cult

to undermine his mothers rule and increase his personal power

so that he can one day seize control of Hlondeth and the sur-

rounding region. A recent attempt to extend the cells in uence

to Surkh failed, thanks to the Cult of Tiamat active in that city.

The Hlondethan cell has been far more successful creating ur-

broodguards (broodguards with the dread warrior template plus

one or more levels of barbarian).

Major Geographical Features

The area around the City of Serpents is particularly rugged.

Churning Bay: The city of Hlondeth lies at the head of a

froth- lled, narrow gulf. Its powerful tides challenge even skilled

navigators except at slack tide. Numerous wrecks line the  oor

92

of Churning Bay, attracting brave explorers who are willing to

risk the dangerous waters.

Mount  Ugruth:  This  long-smoldering  volcano  looms  high

above the City of Serpents. Despite a few rumbles in the Year

of the Serpent (1359 DR), Mount Ugruth has not erupted since

the Year of the Speaking Mountain (257 DR). Nevertheless, the

recent volcanic activity was suf cient to brie y open a portal to

the Elemental Plane of Fire and release dozens of magmins into

the volcanos steaming heart. Some of these creatures emerge to

cause havoc in the surrounding area from time to time. At the

base of the volcano is a prominent Talassan temple called the

Sacellum of Slumbering Fire.

Southsands:  This  beach  south  of  Hlondeth  is  the  site  of

quadrennial mock wars between representatives of Turmish and

Chondath. The winner of this Shieldmeet contest, which dates

back  to  the  Year  of  the  Late  Sun  (300  DR),  receives  certain

trading privileges, initial resource claims, and a tithe of slaves.

Important Sites

Hlondeth has been the recipient of some of the most beautiful

art and architecture that the yuan-ti have ever produced.

Aviary of Extaminos: This great aviary, which took nearly

two decades to construct, is now home to all manner of exotic

birds, most of them native to the Black or Mhair Jungles. Be-

cause  many  of  these  birds  are  quite  dangerous,  visitors  must

submit to a protection from avians spell before entering. Senior

members of House Extaminos are secretly permitted to hunt

within the aviary when the facility is closed.

Cathedral of Emerald Scales: Dedicated to Varae, a beast cult

power of snakes and aspect of Sseth, the Cathedral of Emerald

Scales thoroughly dominates the religious, political, and architec-

tural life of Hlondeth. Constructed over the course of thirteen

centuries by the Extaminos family, the structure served  rst as

the family villa and then as a small shrine to Ilmater on the

periphery of the family compound. When the Extaminos family

shifted its allegiance to Varaes cult, its members expanded the

shrine into a small chapel and reconsecrated it. Although nearly

everyone in Hlondeth realizes that Varae is simply an aspect of

the yuan-ti god Sseth, the priests of the cathedral still maintain

the faade of venerating Varae.

The leader of Varaes clergy is Emerald Boa of the Vilhon

Medusanna Mhairdaul (CE female yuan-ti abomination cleric

17  of  Sseth  [Set])  of  the  SeSehen  tribe,  whose  human  head

sports  countless  poisonous  snakes  in  lieu  of  hair.  Medusanna

personally loathes the relatively cold climate of Hlondeth, the

citys inhabitants, and House Extaminos, and the feeling is re-

ciprocated. This mutual dislike only exacerbates the already high

tensions  between  the  SeSehen  tribe  and  the  ruling  family  of

Hlondeth. The Knights of the Forked Tongue defend the temple,

and the clergy consists of ophidians, yuan-ti purebloods, tainted

ones, and halfbloods.

The  Wall  of  the  Amphisbaena  encircles  the  temple.  This

defensive barricade was sculpted in the form of a giant, two-

headed snake, with the two heads serving as gate towers. Within

the  wall  lies  the  Shrouded  Jungle,  a  mist-shrouded  fragment

of the Black Jungles that is much larger than the space would

apparently  permit.  At  its  heart  is  the  Emerald  Canopy,  a

semitranslucent hemisphere of emerald marble and steel-hard

green glass that sits atop of the Forest of Serpentsa thicket

of  columns  carved  to  resemble  intertwined  snakes.  A  giant

constrictor snake carved from serpentine stone wraps its coils

around the entire dome. Bejeweled statuary and guardian jaculi

 ll  the  Forest  of  Serpents,  and  the  whole  area  is  inundated

with constant rain. Just north of the Emerald Canopy stands

Semoravs Tower, home to Semorav of the Cobras Hood (LE

male pureblood yuan-ti necromancer 14).

A massive, open pit in the center of the cathedral leads down

to the armories, brood chambers, laboratories, prison pantries,

and residences below.

Hlondeth (Metropolis, 45,360): Towering walls of emer-

ald marble encircle the city, and its architecture is marked by

tall,  graceful  arches  and  coils  of  verdant  stone.  Ramps  and

poles have replaced stairs, and at night, the city glows green

because of the interaction between magical lighting and the

emerald-hued stone.

Scaled  Halls  of  Varae:  In  the  deepest  catacombs  beneath

Hlondeth lies an ancient temple, built when one of the Twelve

Cities  of  the  Sword  stood  here  on  the  shores  of  Jhaamdath

Bay.  In  the  early  days  of  the  realm,  Jhaamdathan  explorers

brought back the worship of Varae from the Black Jungles and

constructed the Scaled Halls of Varaea nearly identical copy

of the Pit of Vipers in the ruins of Ssintheessaree. The temple

was abandoned after the destruction of Jhaamdath in the Year

of Furious Waves (255 DR), only to be rediscovered centuries

later (after 527 DR) by the scions of House Extaminos. The

Scaled Halls have been largely neglected since House Extaminos

began openly ruling Hlondeth in the Year of Smoldering Spells

(1020  DR).  It  is  now  visited  only  by  complacent  state  clerics

who are more loyal to House Extaminos than to the yuan-ti as

a whole.

The  Serpent  Sibyl  (see  page  140),  chosen  avatar  of  Sseth

during Time of Troubles, appeared in the Scaled Halls in the

Year of the Wild Magic (1372 DR). Since then, she has built up

a cult of serpentfolk followers who worship at the long-neglected

altar. So powerful has her cult become that she now schemes to

unite yuan-ti holdings across Faern into a grand empire on a

par with Mhairshaulk at its height. The Sibyls Chosen are grow-

ing rapidly in strength and number, and they may soon pose a

threat to the primacy of House Extaminos.

Regional History

The heart of ancient Jhaamdath now lies beneath the waters of

the Vilhon Reach. The Twelve Cities of the Sword were smashed

in the Year of Furious Waves (255 DR), after Jhaamdath Bay

was inundated by a gargantuan tidal wave raised by the elven

High Mages of Nikerymath (now the Chondalwood). This event

reshaped the coastline into the contours of the Vilhon Reach

known today.

The survivors attempted to refound the realm in the wake

of Jhaamdaths fall, but such efforts faltered in the face of con-

tinued skirmishing with the elves of Nikerymath. Most of the

surviving humans migrated north across the Sea of Fallen Stars

to settle the lands along the southern slopes of the Earthfast

Mountains. The  rst of these settlements was Proeskampalar

(later  Procampur),  founded  in  the  Year  of  the  Starry  Shroud

(153 DR).

The founding of Iljak in the Year of Fallen Fury (20 DR)

marked the end of the large-scale Jhaamdathan exodus and the

beginning of efforts to build a human realm along the shores of

the Vilhon Reach. By 50 DR, humanity had founded the cities

of  Arrabar,  Asple,  Daroush,  Mussum,  Samra,  and  Torl.  The

port city of Hlondeth was founded in the Year of Dark Venom

(37 DR), at the western end of the Turmway (now known as the

Halondar) from Alaghn. Such Vilhonese efforts nearly came

to naught when plague wracked the Vilhon Reach in the Year of

Clinging Death (75 DR), killing more than half of the popula-

tion in less than a decade.

For nearly a century, Hlondeth was ruled by a succession of

warlords from House Gestin. During this period, the humans of

House Extaminos rose to prominence, quarrying green marble

from the Osraun Mountains and trading it at ports throughout

the Vilhon Reach and the rest of the Sea of Fallen Stars. In the

Year of the Pirates Port (145 DR), Dempster Turmish marched

Alaghns armies down the Turmway to besiege Hlondeth. The

citys ruling warlord prevailed by enlisting various pirate ships

to attack Alaghns navy in exchange for the promise of a safe

port. This tactic enabled the city to bring in supplies by sea and

thereby outlast the besieging army. Hlondeth defeated Dempster

Turmish again the following year, thanks to the invoker Riliton

Mandleweave  and  the  Company  of  the  Howling  Harpoon.  A

third attack planned for the Year of the Lost Library (150 DR)

collapsed after the death of Dempster Turmish.

The  century  that  followed  is  known  as  the  Calmwaters

because  civilization  in  Turmish  and  along  the  Vilhon  Reach

 ourished  during  this  period.  The  increased  trade  throughout

the  Reach  greatly  enhanced  the  fortunes  of  the  human  Ex-

taminos clan, and a succession of Extaminos patriarchs slowly

expanded their primary villa, transforming the original manor

house into an opulent shrine to Ilmater.

In  the  Year  of  the  Speaking  Mountain  (257  DR),  Mount

Ugruth erupted, and the resultant popular backlash led to the

fall of House Gestin. But before House Extaminos could seize

power in Hlondeth, House Illistine, whose members ruled Chon-

dath, seized the so-called jewel of the Vilhon. For nearly three

centuries,  House  Illistine  ruled  Hlondeth  as  well  as  the  rest

of the Vilhon Reach, while House Extaminos turned inward,

focusing on trade and hedonistic pastimes. During this period,

the Extaminos compound was ringed in a wall of emerald-hued

marble, and Ilmaters shrine was encircled by a lush garden of

exotic plants harvested from distant jungles. Small outbuildings

throughout the walled compound house a menagerie of exotic

beastsprimarily reptiles.

In the Year of the Tatters (527 DR), Hlondeth was besieged

by kobolds of the Tattered Cloth Legion that had been secretly

dispatched by Nathglaryst, drow queen of Undraeth. The rulers

of  Chondath  did  nothing,  but  Lord  Shevron  Extaminos  wel-

comed  all  who  managed  to  escape  the  kobold  army  into  his

familys  compound.  During  the  subsequent  siege,  Shevron  re-

ceived a vision from Ilmater that caused him to dispatch swarms

of pet snakes from his gardens against the kobolds, routing

Nathglarysts host. Shevron himself was killed in the battle, but

no defender of House Extaminos was slain by the serpents.

After Lord Shevrons death, House Extaminos reawakened

from  its  centuries-long  indolence  and  lethargy.  Many  of  the

younger  family  members  began  adventuring  in  the  long-ne-

glected  sewers  of  Hlondeth,  ostensibly  seeking  their  escaped

pets  and  the  connection  to  the  Underdark  through  which

the  kobold  army  had  gained  access  to  the  city.  In  the  citys

catacombs, the young Extaminos nobles uncovered a long-for-

gotten temple of Varae, as well as Lord Sheverons lost army

of snakes.

Discounting the former lords dedication to Ilmater, the next

generation  of  House  Extaminos  began  to  resurrect  the  long-

dormant cult of Varae. Following ancient rituals described on

tablets in the temples vaults, the humans of House Extaminos

made contact with the SeSehen tribe via an ancient portal net-

work linking the Scaled Halls of Varae to the Pit of Vipers in

the ruins of Ssintheessaree. After forging an alliance with the

serpentfolk there, they began to interbreed with SeSehen in the

nearby Osraun Mountains in an attempt to literally join with

the snakes they venerated. They also began secretly extending

their familys political in uence through all levels of the gov-

ernments hierarchy. Eventually, they acquired enough in uence

to engineer a series of rebellions against Chondaths unwanted

rule. Hlondeth  nally regained its independence in the Year of

the Shattered Scepter (614 DR).

While  House  Extaminos  did  not  directly  seize  power  in

Hlondeth  after  Chondaths  governor  was  overthrown,  its

members ruled from behind the throne for the next four cen-

turies. Within a decade of Hlondeths reclaimed independence,

Ilmaters  shrine  in  the  Extaminos  family  compound  was  re-

named the Chapel of Emerald Scales and consecrated to Varae.

Hlondeths citizens accepted this alteration with little fuss, since

House Extaminos was still highly regarded for its past bene -

cence and bravery.

In  the  Year  of  Smoldering  Spells  (1020  DR),  House  Ex-

taminos  began  openly  ruling  Hlondeth  with  little  opposition.

By  this  time,  the  aboveground  temple  of  Varae  had  been  ex-

panded  vefold, the adjoining compound of House Extaminos

had sprawled throughout much of the nobles district, and the

bloodline of the ancient ruling house had become fully and com-

pletely yuan-ti. From this point forward, House Extaminos was

considered a great yuan-ti tribe in its own right, wholly distinct

from the SeSehen tribe, with the city-state of Hlondeth  rmly

constricted in its coils.

Plots and Rumors

Hlondeth has always been a hotbed of yuan-ti intrigue. The fol-

lowing plot is only one of many that can be investigated here.

Plague  of  Serpents:  Leaders  of  the  Plague-Mothers  Chil-

dren, a human cult based in Hlondeth and dedicated to Talona,

have forged an alliance with the Sibyls Chosen. Together, the

two groups aim to create tainted ones on a vast scale. Dediana

Extaminos is working in secret to oppose their plot, fearing the

power it would give the Serpent Sibyl. The Serpents Secession,

a secret society of humans led by Gonthril Astinar (NG male

Chondathan  human   ghter  7/rogue  5)  also  opposes  the  plot,

since its members are sworn to actively resist the spreading in u-

ence of the serpentfolk.

secrets were destroyed by the phaerimms and the folly of the

Isstossef  (as  the  inhabitants  were  known),  scattered  by  the

Netherese, and buried by the drifting sands of Anauroch. In

its  heyday,  the  Land  of  the  Lost  Sea  ran  along  the  eastern

shores of the old Narrow Sea, encompassing the fertile lands

that  stretched  from  what  is  now  the  Saiyaddar  to  the  High

Ice and from the waters edge to the Plain of Standing Stones.

Today, all that remains of this once-great empire is the buried

city of Oreme.

Life and Society

The sixty sarrukh liches of Oreme are ancient even by the stan-

dards of most undead. Only one, always known as King Oreme,

is  awake  at  any  given  time  to  ful ll  the  duties  of  monarch.

The remainder lie in repose in the Crypt of Dreaming Lizards,

dreaming  of  lands  long  lost  and  awaiting  their  turns  to  rule.

Ancient contingency spells ensure that all the liches wake up if

any real danger threatens the city, or if the currently awake lich

is destroyed or incapacitated. The current ruler can also awaken

all of his companions at once with a single mental command.

The current King Oreme spends his time in much the same

way as his predecessors did, scrying events of interest to reptiles

in  Faern  and  recording  his  observations  in  the  citys  vast

library. The asabis that guard the city are largely left to rule

themselves, although the currently awake lich can be persuaded

to intervene if the tribal council cannot reach agreement about

an issue.

The asabis and stingtails that make up the vast majority of

the population are organized into tribal mercenary companies.

Each tribe is controlled by an asabi chief, who gains control

by allying with the tribes most powerful stingtails. All the

chiefs serve on the Council of Chiefs, which answers only to

King Oreme.

The liches of Oreme keep only enough asabis and stingtails

in  the  city  to  ensure  its  defense  and  maintain  a  viable  breed-

ing  population.  Excess  tribes  are  dispatched  into  Faern  with

instructions to support themselves by any means necessary (usu-

ally mercenary work) and ensure a steady  ow of news reports

back to the capitol.

Major Geographical Features

Though not completely featureless, the area where the Isstossef-

  l Empire once stood now appears largely lifeless and barren.

The Frozen Sea: During the Days of Thunder, the old Narrow

Sea ran like a sword along the eastern  anks of the Greypeak

Mountains, stretching from the future site of the dwarven sea-

port Ascore to the city of Oreme, but the sea was never more

than 100 miles in width. After the Isstossef reshaped the land

in their war with the phaerimms, the Narrow Sea  owed from

west to east, stretching from what would become Ascore to the

Tortured Lands.

After countless millennia, little evidence remains of the ter-

rain-shaping magic employed by the sarrukh. The icy dunes of

the Frozen Sea on the western border of Anaurochthe result

of rainfall that runs down the eastern slopes of the Greypeaks

and freezesgive mute evidence of the ancient sea that once

lay here.

Today, the Frozen Sea is a breeding ground for many birds in

the spring, but it is otherwise almost empty of inhabitants. Only

those foolish enough to search out the lost cities of Anarath,

Ascore (seaport of dwarven Delzoun), Bhaulaea, Hlaungadath

(a crashed Netherese  oating city), and Oreme ever come here.

The  Phaerlin:  The  Buried  Realms  of  Anauroch  are  the

dominion  of  the  phaerimms,  and  those  who  can  resist  the

master of the Phaerlin are few and far between. The deepest

catacombs of Oreme connect directly with the Underdark and

have  been  the  site  of  repeated  battles  between  the  asabis  of

Oreme and the mind-slaves of the phaerimms. Long ago, the

sarrukh liches erected a barrier around Oreme similar to the

Sharnwall. Thus far, the barrier has prevented the phaerimms

from directly invading the city, but the wards do not prevent

the passage of other races, including the thornbacks minions.

Elsewhere in the Phaerlin, asabi tribes dominate the catacombs

beneath  the  ruined  city  of  Rasilith  and  the  caverns  beneath

Azirrhat.  The  former  group  is  under  the  direct  control  of

the phaerimms, while the latter is nominally free but secretly

controlled by the phaerimms.

Important Sites

Only ruins now break the landscape of this bleak region. Some

of those ruins, however, are rich enough to result in a steady

stream of adventurers.

Anarath:  The  ruined  City  of  Statues  lies  in  the  northern

reaches of the Frozen Sea, in the shadow of the High Ice. Aban-

doned  in  the  dying  days  of  Isstossef  l,  Anarath  was  picked

over by early Netherese explorers. Today, it is the haunt of Iym-

rith (female ancient blue dragon sorcerer 7), the Doom of the

Desert. Iymrith does not know the name of the city in which

she  lairs,  but  she  has  found  the  accommodations  suitable.  No

one dwells in Anarath except the dragon, her legion of gargoyle

constructs, and the Company of Flame Spiders (an enslaved Ath-

katlan  adventuring  company  that  the  dragon  uses  to  explore

nearby  Netherese  ruins).  In  recent  years,  word  of  Anaraths

discovery has reached the serpentfolk of Najara, and they have

begun  making  regular  pilgrimages  to  this  ancient  ruin.  Since

none  have  dared  enter  the  city  so  far,  Iymrith  tolerates  their

offerings, just as she does those of certain Bedine tribes.

Bhaulaea: In the western reaches of the High Ice, near the

old bed of the Narrow Sea, lies the ruined City in Ice. Aban-

doned by the sarrukh during their war with the phaerimms, it

now lies encased in glacial ice at the bottom of the High Ice,

forgotten by all except the liches of Oreme. Unless the denizens

of  Shade  resume  the  melting  of  the  High  Ice,  the  only  way

to reach Bhaulaea is an ancient portal that links the ruins of

Ssyintiasaminass with an intact remnant of the city preserved

in a bubble of glacial ice. Since the portal key to return differs

from the one needed to reach the City in Ice, however, would-

be  explorers  who  do  not  take  special  precautions  are  usually

trapped there. The frozen corpses of seven yuan-ti and their

deinonychus steeds in the center of the ice cavern bear mute

witness to just such a miscalculation.

Crypt  of  Hssthak:  Hssthak  (LE  male  sarrukh  mummy

sorcerer 10/archmage 5), who believes himself to be the last of

the Isstossef, rests within this ancient tomb guarding two of the

Golden Skins of the World Serpent (Nether Scrolls). Although

his crypt has remained undiscovered for countless millennia, he

waits patiently for the day that he can pass on the wisdom of

the sarrukh to their lesser progeny.

Circa 6000 DR, the elves of Evereska stumbled across Hsst-

haks tomb and recognized the threat it posed. A half dozen elves

volunteered to become mummies themselves so that they could

guard the tomb for all eternity. Once they had been placed in posi-

tion, the tomb was resealed and buried by elven magic. Because the

crypt lay beneath otherwise unremarkable  atlands, the Netherese

never  chanced  upon  it.  Recently,  however,  the  walls  of  a  deep

sinkhole at a desert oasis on the eastern edge of the Frozen Sea

crumbled, revealing the front of the ancient structure. Already a

band of lizardfolk and the Company of the Golden Sands have

explored parts of the tomb, so it is only a matter of time before

someone recovers the powerful sarrukh magics that lie within.

Hall of Mists: In the depths of the High Forest, beneath

the towering Grandfather Tree, lies a truly ancient ruin known

96

620_96566_SerpentKin92-135.indd   96

5/12/04, 4:10:45 PM

REALMS

only as the Hall of Mists. The elves who  rst discovered this

ancient structure more than 13,000 years ago recognized it as

a fell legacy of the Iqua-TelQuessir (creator races). So great

was the evil contained within it that the elves summoned an

arakhor  (an  Elven  term  that  translates  loosely  as  one  who

protects the forest or tree warden) to guard the site. This

creature,  known  as  the  Grandfather  Tree,  has  protected  the

Hall of Mists ever since.

Akin in some respects to elementals, the arakhora draw life,

energy,  and  intelligence  from  the  forests  in  which  they  dwell

and repay the debt by serving as the caretakers and guardians

of these places. Writings preserved from this era by the church

of Labelas Enoreth suggest that the arakhora were a form of

elder treant (treat as advanced elder treant)perhaps even the

progenitors of the modern treants. With the exception of the

Stone  Stand  cutting,  the  Grandfather  Tree  is  the  last  known

arakhor alive in Faern today.

Unbeknownst to anyone except the remaining sarrukh, the

Hall of Mists is the ancient stronghold of the Baetith, an or-

ganization that began in Isstossef  l but outlasted that empire.

The group was later dominated by the sarrukh of other realms,

then by the batrachi, and then by the aearee before it vanished

during the waning Days of Thunder. The Baetith studied the

primitive  forms  of  magic  practiced  by  the  various  races  of

Faern and, over thousands of years, codi ed them in the form

of  the  Golden  Skins  of  the  World  Serpent,  which  were  later

known as the Nether Scrolls.

Today, the Hall of Mists is infested with a colony of giant red

ants that were spawned in the Year of the Fell Firebreak (883

DR) by an eddy of magical chaos emanating from Hellgate Keep.

These ants opened tunnels to the Hall of Mists for the  rst time

in eons, and at least one adventurerMintiper Moonsilverhas

since explored the subterranean ruin. Word of this discovery has

 nally reached the sarrukh of Serpentes, and at least one band

of yuan-ti adventurers has been dispatched to the far North to

explore the site.

Oreme: The ruined City of White Towers lies some 200 miles

east of the Weathercote Wood, on the edge of the empty sands

of the Frozen Sea. Once a city of artisans ruled by sarrukh wiz-

ards and sorcerers, Oreme was largely abandoned during the fall

of Isstossef  l. In the bowels of the city, however, the few dozen

sarrukh  who  chose  to  remain  behind  transformed  themselves

into liches and have clung ever since to the remnants of their

empire, ruling the asabis who stayed behind to guard them. The

rest of the asabi population from that era  ed into the Under-

dark, only to be enslaved by the phaerimms.

The  ruins  of  Oreme  remained  unknown  to  the  surface

world  for  more  than  30,000  years  after  the  citys  towers  had

been buried in debris from the dustbowl that had once been the

Narrow Sea. But once the phaerimms returned to the upper Un-

derdark of the Buried Realms and began to plague the Netherese,

they quickly discovered the remnants of their ancient foes. The

liches  of  Oreme  were  forced  to  withdraw  even  farther  behind

their magical wards, conceding all but the citys catacombs and a

few surrounding caverns to the minions of the phaerimms.

Regional History

During   rst  era  of  the  Days  of  Thunder  (more  than  35,000

years ago), the reptilian sarrukh ruled over all Faern. Their

Battle in Anarath

population was concentrated in three major empires, plus a host

of lesser realms. The northernmost empire of the sarrukh was

Isstossef  l, which lay along the western edge of what is now

called Anauroch. At that time, the Narrow Sea ran along the

eastern slopes of the mountains known as the Greypeaks.

Like  their  kin  in  Mhairshaulk  and  Okoth,  the  Isstossef

created many races in their own image. It was they who devel-

oped the asabis (also known as laertis) and stingtails, as well as

other reptilian races capable of dwelling in the depths of the

Underdark.  During  their  explorations  of  the  Realms  Below,

the  Isstossef  encountered  such  alien  races  as  aboleths  and

phaerimms, although whether those races had dwelt there all

along or were inadvertently summoned by the Isstossef remains

a matter of conjecture.

The fall of Isstossef  l dates back to an ancient war with

the phaerimms, circa 33,800 DR. In an effort to drown the

Phaerlin (known today as the Buried Realms) and dispatch their

enemies in one masterful stroke, Isstossef wizards rerouted the

Narrow  Sea  so  that  it  ran  from  east  to  west,  inundating  the

land  around  the  chain  of  hills  known  today  as  the  Tagorlar

with  water.  Although  the  Isstossef  succeeded  in  driving  the

phaerimms  deep  into  the  Underdark,  the  massive  ecological

change resulting from their weavings of the Art caused their

empire to collapse.

A  handful  of  Isstossef  spellcasters  embraced  a  form  of  li-

chdom  in  an  effort  to  preserve  the  legacy  of  their  empire  at

any cost. They then retreated into the bowels of Oreme while

the empire crumbled about them. To their surprise, these few

remaining  Isstossef  discovered  that  the  phaerimms  had  not

been  destroyed,  and  they  were  hard  pressed  to  erect  wards

around their subterranean home in time to hold off the invad-

ers. During all the millennia since, the sarrukh liches of Oreme

have observed the world around them, scrying on the activities

of their progeny, without ever venturing from the con nes of

their ruined city. They observed the rise and fall of Netheril, the

formation of the Great Desert, and most recently, the return of

Shade and the sharp check dealt to the phaerimms. It is unclear

what it would take to convince the remaining Isstossef to emerge

from their ancient home, but if these events do not provide suf-

 cient motivation, perhaps nothing would.

Plots and Rumors

The recent events in this area provide several interesting con-

cepts for adventuring.

Return of the Asabis: The defeat of the phaerimms in the

recent war with Shade and Evereska has released large numbers

of asabis from indentured servitude. Although many of these

creatures are now seeking work as mercenaries outside of An-

auroch, a signi cant minority has begun migrating toward the

Frozen Sea. Perhaps the liches of Oreme have at last summoned

home  their  wayward  progeny,  or  perhaps  the  asabis  are  being

drawn there for some other reason. In either case, their activities

are likely to draw a new wave of treasure seekers to the ancient

ruins of Oreme.

Alignment: LE, NE

The  Lapal  League  is  a  confederation  of  city-states  along  the

southeastern  shore  of  the  Shining  Sea.  Loosely  ruled  by  the

Overking of Sheirtalar, these small realms are sometimes known

as the Cities of the Seabreeze, though that phrase technically

also includes Narubel, Tashluta, Ormpur, and the ruins of Pro-

calith. Lapaliiya stretches from the eastern end of the Delphin

Mountains to the Sheir Peninsula, and from the shores of the

Shining  Sea  to  the  northern  edge  of  the  Mhair  Jungles,  the

Great Wall of Halruaa, the western edge of the Bandit Wastes,

and the peaks of the Dun Hills.

Life and Society

The inhabitants of Lapaliiya are zealous warriors and industri-

ous merchants who place tremendous value on personal honor

and propriety. Duels and feuds over slights that folk of other

lands might readily dismiss are common. Almost all positions of

power are dominated by Tashalans, despite their minority status

in the country as a whole.

Ophiophobia is common here. Serpentfolk are slain on sight

if they reveal themselves as such, and overt dealings with them

are  punishable  by  death.  Nevertheless,  the  serpentfolk  wield

considerable  in uence  in  Lapaliiya,  and  of cials  routinely

overlook suspicious dealings involving persons with signi cant

political strength.

Each city-state in the Lapal League has a civic deity, and

its citizens discourage all other faiths. Con ict (whether overt

political disagreements or covert skullduggery) occurs more fre-

quently within the confederation than with its neighbors. Clerics

and monks enjoy positions of respect and authority in Lapaliiya,

while  arcane  spellcasters  are  viewed  with  some  suspicionan

attitude  that  dates  back  to  the  Rage  of  Wizards  (1142  DR).

The dark god of Lapaliiyan myth is Amphisbaena the World

Serpent, who has wrapped the world in his coils and is slowly

crushing it into pulp as he devours himself.

In centuries past, Lapaliiya was a nation only in name, ruled

by an essentially powerless Grand Council made up of the satraps

of the  ve most powerful city-states. The union of the ruling

houses of Sheirtalar and Lushpool in the Year of Glad Tidings

REALMS

(1147 DR), occurring as it did in the immediate aftermath of

the  Rage  of  Wizards,  led  to  the  installation  of  a  rulerthe

Overking of Lapaliiya. In addition to ruling the cities of Sheirta-

lar and (through the heir to the throne) Lushpool, the overking

theoretically governs all of Lapaliiya with the consent of the

Grand Council, which can vote yea or nay but not initiate its

own decrees. In practice, however, the overking must still secure

unanimous consent from the representatives of Sammaresh, Ith-

mong,  Lushpool,  Sheirtalar,  and  Uzurr,  which  usually  means

negotiating  with  the  reigning  Shoonsar  of  Ithmong  and  the

satraps of Lushpool.

Major Geographical Features

The area around Lapaliiya features a variety of terrain types

and points of interest.

Bandit  Wastes:  In  the  shadow  of  Halruaas  North  Wall,

the fertile vineyards of Lapaliiya give way to the desolate bar-

rens known as the Bandit Wastes. This region has traditionally

provided a home for outlaws  eeing the reach of Halruaan or

Lapaliiyan justice. At present, the worst such group is the Blood

Screamers,  a  band  of  savage  gnome  dire  weremoles  led  by  a

gnome  vampire  called  the  Blood-Curdling  Scream  (CE  male

rock gnome vampire illusionist 9). This group maintains a lair

in a warren of tunnels dug by giant ants in the barrens east of

Lapalgard, and its members raid as far a eld as the Rathgaunt

Hills and the Nath.

Dolphingulf, The: Known as the Delphingulph in the local

vernacular,  this  long,  shallow  bay  is  frequented  by  pods  of

dolphins drawn here by the bountiful schools of  sh. A tribe

of aquatic elves dwells in the underwater hills that mark the

northern  edge  of  the  bay,  and  its  members  frequently  sell

rare  treasures  from  the  sea   oor  in  the  markets  of  Sam-

maresh.  According  to  legend,  an  ocean  striderxMM2  protects

the  Dolphingulf,  although  no  reliable  reports  attest  to  the

creatures existence.

Dun Hills, The: This low stretch of hills shelters the Misty

Vale from the coastal lands along the Shining Sea. The western

slopes support scattered groves of olive trees, but little else in

the way of vegetation. Small herds of goatssome wild, some

notwander  this  area.  The  central  hills  house  many  tombs,

and undead continue to plague the region despite the efforts of

Kelemvors priesthood. The mist-shrouded eastern slopes of the

Dun Hills are covered with trees that are nearly as impenetrable

as the Misty Forest.

River Talar: Much of the Shaar drains into this wide, slow-

moving river. For the last 10 miles of its length, the waters roar

through a narrow, high-cliffed gorge, making the ever-churning

river mouth nearly unnavigable. This gorge is home to a tribe of

merrow (aquatic ogres) and scrags (aquatic trolls) whose mem-

bers hunt in the depths of Sheirtalar Bay. Repeated efforts by

Lapaliiyas army to dislodge them have ended in failure.

The only bridge over the River Talar for hundreds of miles

is the Mouth of Istishia, a natural arch wide enough for three

carts to pass each other safely. Well-armed troops garrison small

towers on both sides of the bridge to ensure that no one inter-

feres with traf c across this crucial artery.

Sheir Peninsula: Surrounded by cliffs more than 20 feet high,

this granite outcropping juts out into the Shining Sea. It is home

to scattered thorps of shepherds, who are generally impoverished

by the high rents they must pay the Overking to use the land.

Inhabitants of this region avoid going anywhere near the Shin-

ing Sea, for fear of the harpies that inhabit the cliff faces and

prey on passing ships.

Important Sites

Lapaliiya is a busy area with many important trading centers.

Abreon (Large Town, 4,680): The low, rolling hills around

this  inland  town  are  dotted  with  vineyards  and  groves  of

olive trees.

The civic deity of Abreon is Lliira, and a council of wealthy

farmers rules the town. More than  fteen centuries ago, Abreon

was the site of a great battle between the armies of Serpentes

and  the  beleaguered  defenders  of  Lapaliiya.  Ancient  barrows

dating  back  to  that  battle  are  scattered  across  the   elds,  and

from  time  to  time  a  few  serpentine  and  humanoid  undead

emerge from them to terrorize the local population.

Dungar  (Small  Town,  931):  Dungar  lies  along  the  trade

route  between  Halruaas  Talath  Pass  and  Lapaliiyas  coastal

cities. Numerous vineyards and olive groves encircle the settle-

ment, which is populated largely by farmers.

The local civic deity is Chauntea, and the town is ruled by a

family that traces its roots back to Felingar, a legendary Lapali-

iyan bandit lord. Felingars crypt lies beneath the rolling hills

of Dungar and is reputed to contain the dowry of a long-dead

Ormpurian chansreena (princess) who was stolen en route to her

wedding to a prominent Halruaan archmage.

Ilyaport (Small Town, 1,923): Founded about 100 DR, this

ancient town grew up around the Umberlant temple known as

the Shell House. After the temples destruction during the Rage

of Wizards, Ilyaport began to decline. Today, this once-grand

town is little more than a simple  shing village overshadowed

by the city of Ithmong to the north.

The Bitch Queen is still the civic deity of Ilyaport, and the

town is ruled by the highest-ranking Umberlant in permanent

residencecurrently  Dread  Wavelord  Dumai  Arachneie  (CE

male Tashalan human cleric 7 of Umberlee/waveservant 1 [see

Faiths and Pantheons]). Adventurers are the most frequent visi-

tors here because the ruins of Umberlees temple are said to hold

many treasures as yet undiscovered.

Ithmong  (Metropolis,  46,729):  The  Stormwracked  City

of  Ithmong  bears  the  brunt  of  most  storms  that  rage  across

the Shining Sea. Even so, the city is second only to Sheirtalar

in wealth, population, and political power, thanks to the large

volume of goods that  ows through its port from Halruaa and

the Lapaliiyan hinterlands. The Stormwracked City lies at the

head of Ithmong Bay, atop a 50-foot-high cliff. The docks are

built inside a dozen linked seacaves that collectively serve as the

citys subterranean port district.

REALMS

The civic deity of Ithmong is Bhaelros (Talos), and the ruler

is the hereditary shoonsar, a title currently held by Darhost the

Mongrel Tharsuir (NE male Tashalan human  ghter 14).

Lapalgard (Large Town, 3,701): The Fortress of Lapalgard

was built in the decade after the founding of Lapaliiya, to mark

the unity of the Lapal tribes in opposing the serpentfolk of the

jungles. Today, this ancient stronghold stands just as strong as it

did a millennium ago, although it has not seen war since the fall

of the Shoon Imperium. Lapaliiyan troops based in Lapalgard

spend  as  much  time  patrolling  the  Bandit  Wastes  as  they  do

the northeastern Mhair Jungles. Caravans passing to and from

Halruaa via the Talath Pass account for the prosperity of the

town that now surrounds the fortress.

The  civic  deity  of  Lapalgard  is  Tempus,  and  the  Knight-

Commander of the Fortress rules the town.

Lhazantal (Small Town, 925): The City of Smiths is actu-

ally a small town that lies along the Lapal Way near one of the

few iron mines in resource-poor Lapaliiya. Most of its businesses

involve metalworking, and its craftspeople produce serviceable

suits  of  mail,  stout  weapons,  various  farm  implements,  and

ironmongery.  Most  Lapaliiyan  gnomes  who  do  not  dwell  in

Zashuma  live  here.  The  civic  deity  is  Gond,  and  the  towns

leader is an exiled master smith from Lantan named Lambrac

Dinelstrand (CG male Lantanna human expert 9).

Lushpool (Large City, 17,265): The City of Shimmering

Pools  lies  in  the  sheltered  lee  of  the  Ithmong  Peninsula,  by

the mouth of Talar Bay. Lushpool is built on a seven-terraced

hillside,  with  the  lowest  terrace  serving  as  the  citys  wharf

district and the topmost one as the exclusive preserve of the

Prince Royal.

Lushpools  civic  deity  is  Eldath,  and  the  city  is  renowned

for its moss-draped pools and beautiful hanging gardens. These

pools are used to raise several rare kinds of freshwater  sh whose

roe is a gourmet delight throughout Faern. It is this product

more than any other that has brought Lushpool its prosperity.

The Prince Royal of Lapaliiya is the titular ruler of Lush-

pool,  although  a  council  of  satraps  handles  the  day-to-day

governance  of  the  city.  Since  nine  of  the  sixteen  satraps  are

yuan-ti  purebloods  from  the  Hazimtar  clan  of  the  Eselemas

tribe, Lushpool is effectively in the hands of the yuan-ti, as it

has been for more than two centuries.

It was the Hazimtar who brought in the breeding stock for

Lushpools rare, pool-bred  sh, which are native to the depths

of Lake Lemas and thus largely unknown to humans. A two-

way portal below the Palace of the Prince leads to the ruins of

Ssdathinssatath,  on  the  western  shore  of  Lake  Lemas.  All

passage through the portal requires a keyin this case a snake-

skin, which may be shed, on a live snake, or part of the body of

a serpentfolk. Lapaliiyas rulers and closest advisors are aware

of the source of Lushpools prosperity and the true nature of

the Hazimtar, but they have turned a blind eye to both facts

for generations.

Malaxer  (Large  Town,  4,103):  Woodcutters  and  hunters

who dare the northern edges of the Mhair Jungles live here,

along  with  a  handful  of  wild  dwarves  who  have   ed  their

homelands for one reason or another. Most expeditions into

yuan-ti territories begin in Malaxer because the town boasts

the greatest concentration of skilled guides-for-hire in Lapali-

iya. Of course, a not-insigni cant fraction of those guides are

yuan-ti agents on the watch for adventurers who might pose a

threat to the serpentfolk or possess any items that the yuan-ti

might desire.

The  civic  deity  of  Malaxer  is  Silvanus.  High  Lapalyth

(baron) Tormar o the Axe (LN male Tashlutan human ranger

7) rules the town.

Mierskar (Small Town, 1,617): This small farming town lies

in the shadow of Lushpool. Mierskar is known for its library,

which rivals any on the Tashtan Coast. During the reign of the

Shoon Imperium, a far-sighted imperial satrap ordered all extant

lore regarding the yuan-ti to be assembled in a single place of

learning. Mierskar was selected to house the collection because a

prominent school of wizardry dominated the town at the time.

Although the school was destroyed during the Rage of Wizards

in 1142 DR, the Great Library of Mierskar remains inviolate.

The library is open to all Scaleless Ones, and anyone perusing

the stacks for at least an hour receives a +5 circumstance bonus

on  all  Knowledge  and  bardic  knowledge  checks  related  to  the

yuan-ti and their history on the Chultan Peninsula.

The  civic  deity  is  Deneir,  and  the  town  is  a  vassal

of  Lushpool.

Ormpur  (Large  City,  24,612):  Also  known  as  Ormpar  in

the  local  vernacular,  the  City  of  Saffron  lies  at  the  head  of

Ormpur  Bay  on  the  eastern  end  of  the  Shining  Sea.  Ormpur

has long been a powerful and independent city-state, thanks to

a long-standing alliance with a clutch of chromatic wyrmlings.

This alliance allowed the city to fend off the lizardfolk armies

of Serpentes while the rest of Lapaliiya fell to the Scaled Ones.

Even during the era of the Shoon Imperium, Ormpur retained

its  nominal  independence  via  careful  diplomatic  maneuvering

in the court of the qysars and the unspoken threat posed by its

wyrmling-mounted cavalry.

In the Year of Thunder (1306 DR), on a day known to Orm-

purrans as Bloodsword, Chansreena (Princess) Maerildarraine,

foster daughter of High Suikh (king) Askulder, slew her father,

who was known as the Hand of Tiamat. After proclaiming her-

self queen, she ordered her knights to set the royal temple of the

Dragon Queen a re. This act precipitated a holy war that even-

tually cost Maerildarraine her throne and her life and reduced

Ormpur from a great city to the lesser community it is today.

Although it still retains its nominal independence, Ompur is in-

creasingly falling under the sway of the Overking of Lapaliiya.

Ormpur  Bay  is  the  only  spot  in  Faern  where  the  crocus

 ower  needed  to  produce  saffron  grows  in  abundance.  Unlike

Lapaliiya  to  the  south,  the  majority  of  the  human  popula-

tion  here  is  of  Tashlutan  origin.  The  difference  in  ethnicity

stems from the fact that Ormpur has never been conquered by

Shaaran nomadsprimarily because those folk have always been

welcomed in the citys markets.

Ormpur is now ruled by High Suikh Helbareim the Storm

Wind  Alanasker,  who  overthrew  Queen  Maerildarraine  with

the backing of the church of Tiamat. Alanasker is the last of

his  line,  now  that  his  only  daughter  and  heir  is  missing.  The

tradition of a civic deity is less strong in Ormpur than in the

cities to the south, but Tiamat is accorded that title in the City

of Saffron thanks to her churchs backing of Helbaerim.

Sammaresh  (Large  City,  21,912):  The  City  of  Dancing

Dolphins  lies  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  Dolphingulf,  nestled

among three low hills that spill out into a wide, sandy beach.

This  community  marks  the  western  frontier  of  Lapaliiya,

although  the  border  technically  extends  to  the  foothills  of

the  Hazur  Mountains.  Sammareshs  docks  extend  out  nearly

a half-mile into the shallow bay, since only there is the draft

deep enough to accommodate ships. Sammareshs economy is

based on  shing and the harvesting of emerald oysters, which

produce brilliant green pearls (base value 500 gp) unlike those

found anywhere else.

The  civic  deity  of  Sammaresh  is  Selne,  and  its  populace

makes regular pilgrimages to the Abbey of Tharynd, which lies

just across the border in lands claimed by the Tashalar.

Sammaresh is ruled from the Mantimera Throne by Lady

Ilnara  Mremman  (CG  female  Tashlutan  human  sorcerer  11/

archmage 1). Traditionally, a creature known as the Whisper-

ing  Serpent  acts  as  advisor  to  the  ruler.  Said  to  be  the  ghost

of  a  fallen  couatl,  the  Whispering  Serpent  is  actually  a  LG

male couatl sorcerer 16 employing ethereal jaunt. This creature

seeks to marshal the defenses of western Lapaliiya against the

omnipresent threat of the yuan-ti. From time to time, the Whis-

pering Serpent manifests before a band of adventurers and asks

them to perform a dangerous task designed to counter the plots

of the yuan-ti.

Sheirlantar  (Small  City,  7,306):  The  Tomb  City  of  Sheir-

lantar lies on the western slopes of the Dun Hills, along the

road that runs from Sheirtalar to Kormul. Wealthy, upper-class

Lapaliiyans have always buried their favored dead in the hills

above Sheirlantar, and this region of the Dun Hills is now lit-

tered with crypts dating back many centuries.

The  civic  deity  of  Sheirlantar  was  originally  Myrkul,

but  Kelemvor  now   lls  that  role.  (The  town  elders  never

did acknowledge Cyric.) The Keeper of Crypts, traditionally

a high-ranking priest of the god of the dead, rules the city,

serving  at  the  pleasure  of  Lapaliiyas  overking.  Currently,

that of ce is held by Antara o Bones (LN female Shaaran

human  cleric  5  of  Kelemvor/Doomguide  4  [see  Faiths  and

Pantheons]).

Sheirtalar (Metropolis, 52,135): The Shining City by the

Sea sits at the head of Sheir Bay on the northern end of the

much  larger  Talar  Bay,  which  is  located  at  the  foot  of  the

Sheir  peninsula.  The  land  slopes  sharply  down  to  meet  the

waters, allowing those arriving on ships to see almost all of

the city at once. The citys apt nickname arises from the fact

that most of the prominent buildings are domed and leafed in

silver and gold.

REALMS

Sheirtalar is the capitol of Lapaliiya and the largest and most

powerful of the confederated city-states. Its ruler is the Overking

of Lapaliiya, Shaliim Wyrmslayer (CN male Tashlutan human

 ghter 5/sorcerer 5/eldritch knight 7). The Domed Palace of the

Overking,  the  most  prominent  of  Sheirtalars  landmarks,  sits

atop a granite outcropping in the upper third of the city. Because

most  trade  goods  exiting  the  Shaar  for  western  Faern  pass

through this port, it has become one of the most cosmopolitan

cities in the South.

The seedy Liongirt District, which lies along the eastern edge

of Sheirtalar, is named for the long-vanished tower of Onsilur

Maerdrathom, who styled himself The Ruling Magister from

321 DR to 326 DR. Onsilur forced the imperial satraps of the

Tashtan  Coast  to  give  all  arcane  spellcasters  legal  protection

and  quell  the  worst  of  their  skirmishing.  His  in uence  was

signi cant but short-lived. Shortly after Onsilurs victory with

the satraps, Q ysar Shoon VII demanded that his vassals hire a

large number of mages to slay the Ruling Magister, thus ensur-

ing that the Cities of the Seabreeze would return to squabbling

and not pose a uni ed threat to his throne. Even today, however,

the district has a reputation for hidden portals and unexpected

spell-triggerings.

The civic deity of Sheirtalar is Waukeen, and her Gilt House

of Gleaming Coins is second only to the Palace of the Overking

in over-the-top opulence.

Untisczer: Once one of the Cities of the Seabreeze, Untisczer

now  lies  in  ruins.  Its  remains  are  located  on  a  now-drowned

point of land east of Tashluta that once extended north of the

Lapaliiyan city of Malaxer. A terrifying display of military and

magical might by troops of the Shoon Imperium destroyed the

city  during  the  Tashalar  Campaigns  in  the  Year  of  Wasteful

Pride  (285  DR).  Most  of  Untisczers  tumbled  and  plundered

stones  have  since  been  carried  away,  but  some  still  lie  about

a mile offshore, choked in shallow mud. The haunt of scrags,

sharks, morkothsMM2, giant octopi, and other monsters, this site

is rumored to hold a great deal of drowned treasure.

Uzurr  (Small  City,  10,305):  The  City  of  Toiling  Monks

sprawls across three hilltops on the west side of the Lapal Way.

Ilmatari  missionaries  from  Calimshan  founded  the  Cloister

of St. Uzurr on this spot during the Shoon Imperium. In the

centuries  since,  the  city  of  Uzurr  has  grown  up  around  the

walled monastery.

The Order of St. Uzurr strives to further the Crying Gods

teachings along the Tashtan Coast while supporting itself through

the production of olives, wine, and various spices. The Abbot of St.

Uzurr, Kadar al Ilmater (LG male Calishite human monk 14) is

the titular ruler of Uzurr, and Ilmater is its civic deity.

Zashuma  (Small  Town,  1,399):  Zashuma  lies  along  the

Lapal Way, overshadowed by the city of Ithmong to the north.

Like  many  inland  towns  in  Lapaliiya,  Zashuma  is  a  farming

community specializing in the production of wines and olives.

The fact that the majority of its citizens are rock gnomes sets

it apart from the many similar communities in this area. The

ruler of the town is Clanlaird Burinn Rivenstone (NG male rock

gnome warrior 5), and the civic deity is Garl Glittergold.

Regional History

The  great  couatl-led  migration  of  humans  to  the  Jungles  of

Chult in 2809 DR prompted the long-enslaved human tribes

of the eastern jungles, known as the Lapal, to rebel against their

serpentine masters. In 1732 DR, after centuries of intermittent

clashes with the ruling yuan-ti, the Lapal  ed north and east

from  their  villages  along  the  shores  of  the  great  inland  lake

that  now  bears  their  name.  They  settled  on  the  southeastern

shores of the Shining Sea and in the lands that would one day

become Halruaa.

In  the  Year  of  Fragile  Beginnings  (690  DR),  threatened

by  renewed  attacks  from  the  yuan-ti,  the  Lapal  tribes  along

the  Shining  Sea  came  together  and  established  the  nation  of

Lapaliiya,  naming  the  city  of  Sheirtalar  as  its  capitol  and

designating  the  Fortress  of  Lapalgard  as  the  symbol  of  the

citizens common cause. Dwarfed by the empires of Calimshan

and Jhaamdath to the north and the omnipresent threat of the

yuan-ti to the southwest, Lapaliiya remained a barbaric back-

water on the southern shores of the Shining Sea, known only

for warlike tribesmen who harried the Calimshans easternmost

colonies during the  rst half of that realms Third Age (-900 to

200 DR).

In  the  Year  of  Silken  Sabers  (569  DR),  Calishite  trading

ships laden with unknown luxuries docked at Sheirtalars docks

for the  rst time. This event ushered in an era of trade and pros-

perity along the shores of the Shining Sea. The in uence of the

Calishites had a civilizing effect on the northern Lapal tribes,

transforming their tribal encampments into cities. In the Year

of Plentiful Wine (553 DR), Tashluta was founded by Calishite

merchants and Lapal  eldhands.

Lapaliiyas golden age came to a close in the Year of Clutch-

ing Dusk (375 DR), when the same rat-laden Calishite ships

that had brought prosperity two centuries before introduced the

Empire  Plague.  Almost  30%  of  Lapaliiyas  population  died

within a matter of months, and the realm all but collapsed. As

a  result,  when  Merrshaulks  avatar  Sseth  founded  the  yuan-ti

empire of Serpentes in the Year of Erupting Crypts (304 DR),

human  resistance  was  weak  and  disorganized.  By  the  Year  of

Sunned Serpents (189 DR), the lizardfolk armies of Serpentes

had conquered all of Lapaliiya except the city of Ormpur and

brought in large numbers of Shaaran nomads as slaves.

Lapaliiya remained part of the Serpentes Empire until 34

DR, when it became part of Tashtan (34 DR to 285 DR). It

thereafter  became  part  of  Shoon  Imperium  (285  DR  to  450

DR), although its cities were effectively independent during the

reign of Qysara Shaani (367 DR to 427 DR). (See the histories

of Serpentes and the Tashalar for details on these eras.)

In the Year of Willing Sacri ce (435 DR), the towns along

Lake Lhespen and the River Shaar rose up in rebellion against

the puppet rulers installed by the Shoon and the imperial gar-

risons  that  backed  them.  These  colonies  were  the   rst  in  the

empire  to  defy  the  rule  of  distant  Shoonach,  and  for  a  short

time (436 DR to 437 DR), no Shoon troops ruled over the cen-

tral Shaar or the costal city of Sheirtalar. In response, Q ysar

102

REALMS

Amahl Shoon VII dispatched seventeen troop ships to quell the

uprising. During the Seven Burnings campaign, imperial troops

rampaged  through  Sheirtalar,  Sheirlantar,  Kormul,  Lhesper,

Sebben, Rethmar, and Channathgate. However, the last qysars

death at the hands of Tethyrian rebels in the Year of the Corrie

Fist (450 DR) marked the fall of the Shoon Imperium, and the

imperial garrisons were  nally driven from the Shaar and the

Chultan Peninsula by the end of the Year of Unleashed Fears

(451 DR).

The satraps of Lapaliiyas city-states remained in power after

the departure of the Shoon legions, having wisely allied them-

selves  with  their  local  populations  several  decades  before  the

Shoon Imperiums fall. In the two centuries that followed, the

merchants of Lapaliiya traded with other ports along the Shin-

ing Sea, growing wealthy and content during their nations silver

age  while  Calimshan  and  the  cities  of  the  Arnaden  struggled

to rebuild.

In the Year of the Fanged Beast (640 DR), Yeenoghus cult

rose to rapid prominence among the gnoll tribes of the Shaar,

largely displacing the worship of Gorellik. This increase in power

among  the  savage  humanoids  precipitated  a  sharp  increase  in

attacks against towns in the Lake Lhespen region during the

decades that followed. The rise of the gnolls indirectly uni ed

the cities of Lapaliiya, and the Lapal League was initiated in

the Year of Peaceful Seas (656 DR). Once again, Sheirtalar was

named its capitol. Thanks to the outbreak of intertribal strife

amongst  the  gnolls,  the  confederation  continued  even  after

the threat posed by the gnoll raiders faded in the Year of the

Shrouded Slayer (671 DR).

In  the  centuries  that  followed,  Lapaliiya  was  periodi-

cally  attacked  by  tribes  of  barbaric  Shaaran  nomads.  Every

few  decades,  a  new  Shaaran  tribe  rose  to  prominence  and

marched  on  Lapaliiya.  More  often  than  not,  the  barbarian

hordes would conquer the coastal cities, only to be absorbed

as citizens while the merchants of Lapaliiya continued their

lucrative trade. Over time, Shaarans became the predominant

human ethnic group of Lapaliiya, and the Tashalans (the ad-

mixture  of  Lapaliiyans,  Calishites,  Chultans,  and  Shaarans

who had inhabited Tashtan) became a minority in their own

land. Nonetheless, rulership of Lapaliiyas cities remained in

the hands of satraps who could trace their lineage back to the

era of Shoon viceroys.

In the Year of the Swords Oath (1142 DR), after centuries

of somnolence, the pureblood yuan-ti arcane spellcasters of the

Coiled Cabal attempted to take Sammaresh as the  rst stage of a

plan to reconquer the Cities of the Seabreeze. The plot foundered

when their actions indirectly unleashed the heretofore-inhibited

ambitions of more than two dozen Tashlutan and Lapaliiyan

archmages.  In  a  season-long  orgy  of  spell  battles  along  the

Tashtan Coast, the so-called Rage of Wizards in icted wanton

destruction on the cities of Lapaliiya and the Tashalar, but failed

to gain any wizard (including the yuan-ti) a single throne. It did

however, elevate the respect with which Lapaliiyans treated the

clergy, leading to the rise of civic faiths. This event also paved

the way for the rulers of Sheirtalar and Lushpool to claim the

newly  created  title  of  Overking  of  Lapaliiya   ve  years  later.

Together,  these  two  developments  led  to  Lapaliiyan  political

divisions  that  mirrored  the  enmities  and  alliances  among  the

cities divine patrons and an ill-fated invasion of Halruaa in the

Year of the Broke Blade (1260 DR).

Shaliim, the Prince Royal of Lapaliiya, returned to Lush-

pool in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), after four years of

adventuring with a band of Waterdhavian wildblades. On one of

the worlds that the group had visited via a network of portals,

Shaliim and his companions encountered the Black Wyrms, a

band of aged black dragons who ruled a kingdom of humans

and dwarves. These dragons captured the newcomers handily,

but the band fought its way to freedom in a battle that culmi-

nated with Shaliim leaping into the mouth of one wyrm and

slaying it from within.

In the decade since his return, Shaliim has battled numerous

thieves  who  coveted  the  treasures  he  brought  back  with  him.

When his aged father  nally died of heartstop in the Year of the

Unstrung Harp (1371 DR), Shaliim succeeded him. The newly

ascended overking continues to search for a wife, but he has yet

to  nd a woman who is his equal in swordplay and sorcery.

Plots and Rumors

The rich lore of Lapaliiya provides a wide variety of opportuni-

ties for adventure.

Black Wyrms Revenge: Although Shaliim returned safely

from  the  world  of  the  Black  Wyrms,  the  great  dragons  did

not  so  readily  forget  the  thieves  who  had  plundered  their

hoard. After a decade of searching, the dragons  nally located

the  wildblades  homeworld  and  have  been  quietly  slaying  the

members of the group that invaded their world. One by one,

Shaliims  old  adventuring  companions  have  vanished.  Word

of  the  disappearances  has   nally  reached  Lapaliiyas  latest

overking,  along  with  reports  of  a  black  wyrm  swimming  in

the depths of Talar Bay. Shaliim is now holed up in his palace,

desperately  seeking  a  solution.  His  inability  to  represent  the

kingdom openly is hurting Lapaliiyas mercantile interests and

generating  numerous  whispered  discussions  at  court.  In  des-

peration, Shaliim has decided to hire a band of adventurers to

penetrate the Mhair Jungles and see whether any lore remains

from the ages past, when the yuan-ti battled the great dragons

of Faern.

Missing  Princess:  Once  a  strict,  almost  tyrannical  father,

the High Suikh (king) of Ormpur is now a broken man. He has

already expended much of his citys treasury in a series of failed

attempts to recover his missing daughter, Chansreena (Princess)

Alabhansree Alanasker. The chansreena disappeared in the Year

of the Prince (1357 DR), along with a large quantity of saffron

and many magical blades that were to serve as her dowry. At

 rst, Helbareim suspected half a dozen or so infamous thieves,

then he hired a succession of adventuring bands to rescue her

from the slave pits of Llurth Dreier, a drow city beneath the

Shaar, based on reports that later proved untrue. No hint has

ever reached Ormpurs ruler that Alabhansree actually escaped

with  her  lover,  the  pirate  Cairak  Redbeard,  or  that  the  pair

now  dwells  in  a  small  tower  in  the  Moonshaes.  Their  haven

sits  in  a  snug  harbor  at  Eiresse,  a  tiny  pirate  cove  near  the

southwestern tip of Corwell, facing the eastern capes of the isle

of  Flamsterd.

Agents of the SeSehen tribe have observed the High Suikhs

obsession and consequent decline, and the tribal elders feel that

the  time  is  right  to  extend  their  in uence  into  his  court.  In

the  past  year  alone,  two  highly  ranked  courtiers  have  been

secretly abducted and transformed into tainted ones, and both

now have Helbareims ear and con dence. But the yuan-ti will

have to  ght the beholders of the Alimir Hive (outcasts from

the subterranean city of Zokir beneath the Almraiven Penin-

sula of Calimshan) as well as the elders of House Eselemas for

in uence over Ormpur. At least one Ormpurian noble family is

actually a group of beholder magesemploying magic to appear

in human form.

Serpentine  Suffering:  A  few  years  ago,  the  Abbot  of  St.

Uzurr  learned  about  the  horri c  yuan-ti  practice  of  creating

tainted ones and broodguards. Ever since then, he has been con-

sumed with discovering a means to reverse the process, since he

views restoring full humanity as the only way to relieve the vic-

tims suffering. Although he has not yet succeeded, an Eselemaa

mole within the order has reported that he is drawing close to

his goal. Thus, yuan-ti purebloods working on behalf of all the

tribes have begun in ltrating Uzurr to assassinate the abbot.

Najara, the Kingdom of Snakes, is an ancient realm of serpent-

folk that encompasses the eastern reaches of the High Moor, the

Serpent Hills, the Forest of Wyrms, the Marsh of Chelimber,

and the river valleys that meander through the area. Centuries

ago, Najara was centered in the western reaches of the Forest of

Wyrms, around the now-ruined capitol city of Ssthartissssun.

Now, however, the epicenter of this realm has shifted decidedly

north into the Serpent Hills (once the exclusive territory of the

lizardfolk kingdom of Kalran), and the serpentfolk are strongly

in uential in the surrounding lands.

Najara  is  arguably  the  largest  and  most  powerful  king-

dom of the Western Heartlands, yet its existence as a realm

is  almost  unknown,  even  to  its  nearest  neighbors.  The  ser-

pentfolk do not post guards along the kingdoms borders, or

attack every humanoid that passes through their holdings, or

extract  tariffs  from  passing  caravans.  No  gnome-dug  mines

dot  the  landscape,  and  no  great  cities  attract  visitors  from

miles  around.  The  region  is  known  to  be  dangerous,  but  its

neighbors do not believe that its monstrous inhabitants are or-

ganized in any real sense. Those who stumble across the truth

are rarely seen again, and those who return to human-ruled

cities  knowing  the  truth  often  vanish  before  their  tales  can

gain any credence.

Life and Society

The king of Najara is the dark naga Ebarnaje, a direct descen-

dant of the ha-naga Terpenzi (see page 31), who founded the

kingdom  and  served  as  its   rst  ruler.  Ebarnaje  is  served  by  a

noble  caste  composed  of  dark  nagas  (known  as  collectively  as

the  nagara),  spirit  nagas  (relatively  recent  immigrants),  and

yuan-ti. The majority of the population consists of lizardfolk,

muckdwellers, and ophidians.

LIZARDFOLK

The lizardfolk native to this area believe themselves to be citi-

zens of the independent kingdom of Kalran. In truth, however,

the rulers of Kalran have been vassals of the kings of Najara for

many generations. King Amiskal (CE male lizard king  ghter

15), the present ruler of Kalran, retains that same relationship

with Ebarnaje.

The typical lizardfolk of the northern Serpent Hills are pri-

marily brown, with striking green markings along the arms and

upper chest and limbs that are more humanlike than those of

other tribes. These alterations re ect the breeding experiments

of the Najaran yuan-ti.

Kalran has a militaristic culture in which the strongest war-

riors serve as chieftains (essentially nobles), and artistic pursuits

are  held  in  low  esteem.  The  lizardfolk  of  Kalran  trade  with

their kin in the Marsh of Chelimber but often battle with their

serpentine neighbors. Ebarnaje secretly encourages this state of

perpetual low-grade warfare to strengthen the combat-readiness

of both groups.

NAGAS

The nagas of Najara form the ruling caste of the Kingdom of

Snakes. The dark nagas and free-willed bone nagas are all descen-

dants of Terpenzi, and each is accorded the status of a prince of

the realm. Upon the death of the king, the most powerful living

dark naga can claim the throne by ritual combat.

Traditionally, approximately a dozen spirit nagas serve the

King of Najara. By dint of an ancient pact dating back to the

Nejizars accession to the throne, each spirit naga functions as a

protector of and servitor to the royal line, answering directly to

the reigning monarch. Some serve as guardians, others inspect

ongoing activities in population centers, and the rest function

as inquisitors.

OPHIDIANS

The ophidians of Najara, known locally as snakemen, have hides

mottled with green and deep yellow, although they can adjust

their  coloration  to  blend  with  their  surroundings.  Ophidians

have  simple,  snakelike  bodies  with  arms  and  hands  similar  to

those  of  humans,  and  they  lack  the  cobra  hoods  of  southern

tribes. Najaran ophidians make up the laborer and warrior castes

of the Kingdom of Snakes. They spend their time raising herd

animals, hunting, digging tunnels, building subterranean cities,

and  ghting. Although some ophidians command their fellows,

all must answer to the naga and yuan-ti nobility. The religious

caste  of  Najara  is  dominated  by  yuan-ti,  but  a  few  ophidian

priestesses  are  permitted  within  the  ranks  of  the  Ssethssar.

In  general,  Najaran  ophidians  are  much  more  religious  than

members of the ruling castes.

YUAN-TI

With the exception of histachii and tainted ones, all Najaran

yuan-ti are members of the Hssta  tribe. The dispassionately

intellectual yuan-ti make up the administrator, merchant, and

religious castes of the Kingdom of Snakes. Although they never

perform physical labor, they supervise most ophidian activities

and act as advisors to the ruling nagas. Yuan-ti tainted ones are

equal to ophidians in rank and are included in the warrior and

merchant  castes.  Yuan-ti  histachii  are  considered  little  more

than bestial slaves.

Najaran society is cold and lacking in emotional vibrancy.

The logical and precise serpentfolk enjoy puzzles, mind-expand-

ing exercises, and games that simulate the strategy of war. They

favor art that features elaborate, repetitive patterns and eschew

representative art. Such attitudes lend themselves to the study

of the Art, and many Najarans pursue the path of sorcerer or

(more rarely) wizard.

MUCKDWELLERS

Muckdwellers  are  the  slaves  of  the  lizardfolk,  who  are  in

turn  secretly  controlled  by  the  serpentfolk.  Primitive  packs

of  muckdwellers  dwell  in  muddy  pools  and  streambeds  across

the  northern  Serpent  Hills,   ghting  an  unending  battle  with

the snakes of the region. From time to time, the lizardfolk of

Kalran  call  on  the  muckdwellers  to  supplement  the  ranks  of

their  armies,  but  otherwise  muckdwellers  are  largely  ignored

or eaten.

Major Geographical Features

The  major  features  of  Najara  are  known  to  humanoids  in

the  area,  though  few  know  them  as  well  as  the  Najarans

themselves.

Backlands, The: Named by coast-dwelling humans for its

location  relative  to  them,  the  area  known  as  the  Backlands

encompasses the sparsely settled region east of the Serpents

Tail Stream, the Forest of Wyrms, and the Trielta Hills, which

are north of the River Reaching, west of the desert Anauroch,

and south of the Greypeak Mountains. Fertile Netherese farms

once covered this region, but now it is home to all manner of

fearsome monsters. Yuan-ti and naga hunting parties, guarded

by  bands  of  ophidian  warriors,  often  wander  the  Backlands

seeking new types of prey. The serpentfolk have been known to

hunt humanoidsparticularly cocky bands of  adventurers

for sport.

Forest of Wyrms: The Forest of Wyrms is one of the last

remnants of the great forest that once stretched from the Sunset

Mountains  to  the  Sea  of  Swords,  and  from  the  western  and

southern edge of the High Moor down to the Cloud Peaks. De-

spite the incredibly rocky terrain, the great redwoods and thick

pines of this forest soar to incredible heights, suggesting that

at least parts of this woodland may have been magically grown

by the elves of Shantel Othreier. Logging the forest is almost

impossible due to its formidable terrain and the creatures that

dwell within.

The  Forest  of  Wyrms  has  been  home  to  all  manner  of

snakes since the arrival of the yuan-ti in Ssthartissssun. Some

of the more dangerous varieties include deathcoils, jaculis, and

tree pythons. In addition, the Forest of Wyrms is home to at

least a half-dozen immature green dragons. Descended from the

legendary Agyrtclughwaur, these creatures effectively rule the

forests depths. Dragon slayers often come here to hunt, but no

one has yet recovered the fabled hoard of the Forest Wyrm.

Marsh  of  Chelimber:  This  vast  marsh  is  home  to  thou-

sands of lizardfolk, bullywugs, muckdwellers, and sivs. Their

numbers were sorely depleted in the Year of Wild Magic (1372

DR), when beholders enslaved many tribes to  ght on behalf

of the phaerimms, but the populations have since rallied. The

marsh-dwelling  tribes  battle  constantly  amongst  themselves,

uniting  only  to  repel  incursions  of  serpentfolk  from  the

Serpent Hills.

King Kront (CE male lizard king barbarian 13) nominally

rules  the  lizardfolk,  bullywug,  and  muckdweller  tribes,  but  in

practice his in uence rarely extends farther than his immedi-

ate  attendants.  The  siv-dominated  Order  of  the  Frog  is  the

real  power  of  the  marsh,  although  individual  beholders  of

the  shattered  Greypeaks  Hive  are  given  wide  berths,  and  the

catoblepasesMM2 are feared by all.

The marsh was formed when the Principality of the Snarling

Boar (457 DR to 692 DR), named for the legendary adventurer

Boareskyr, was inundated by water elementals in the aftermath

of a spell battle between two powerful archmages. Today, many

of the Boareskyrn ruins that still dot the marsh are inhabited

by brotherhoods of monastic sivs. Other ruins are too magical or

intimidating for the marsh inhabitants to tamper with.

The waggishly named Dunkapple Castle, which hangs upside

down with its spires in the muck at the head of the Winding

Water, was once the abode of the Wizard of the Crag but is now

home to a huge thirst of stirges. The most famous ruin is the

Keep of the Drowned Prince, which once served as the royal seat

of Boareskyr. The realms last ruler, Prince Chelimber the Proud,

has become a powerful wight, guarding his riches in the depths

of the  ooded keep. His courtiers, a ravenous pack of lacedons,

attend him there.

River Catherine: This small stream winds through the south-

ern Serpent Hills until it joins with the Serpents Tail Stream

and, eventually, the Winding Water. This waterway is home to

many of the same creatures as the Serpents Tail Stream. The

central arch of the Great Petri ed Serpent spans the River Cath-

erine at its widest point.

Serpent Hills: These rocky hills roll along a great expanse,

broadening to the west until they become the High Moor. The

Serpent Hills average 500 feet in height, with the tallest just

below 1,000 feet. This region gets more rainfall than the moor,

and its scrubby growth and groves of hardy trees provide cover

for the regions innumerable snakes. Many streams, the largest

of which is the River Catherine, emerge from freshwater springs

and then carve their way through the rocky hills to join with

the Serpents Tail Stream.

Most  of  the  rock  faces  have  been  carved  or  quarried,  and

the landscape is dotted with ruins, many of which are Anaurian

crypts that date back to the era immediately following the fall

of Netheril. The hills themselves are primarily granite, though

deposits of iron and silver ore, veins of salt, and pockets of  ne

marble make them a rich resource. Much of the exposed marble

has  already  been  quarried,  but  many  deposits  remain  under-

ground. Only a few shallow caves lie directly beneath the hills,

but some of them connect with the more extensive limestone

caverns that make up the uppermost reaches of the Underdark.

In addition to lizardfolk, nagas, ophidians, and yuan-ti, the

Serpent Hills support a colony of black caimans (crocodiles), a

school of bulettes, a handful of beholder variants with vipers

in  lieu  of  eyestalks,  dinosaurs  (deinonychus,  known  locally  as

razortails, and small stegosauruses, known locally as spiketails),

 redrakes, giant frogs, muckdwellers, urds (treat as kobolds with

the winged template; see Savage Species), and strange monstrosi-

ties bred by the yuan-ti. The harmless forms of wildlife include

frogs, at least four varieties of skinks, snake-necked turtles, and

toads. All manner of snakes make their homes here as well, in-

cluding adders (Small vipers), loopsnakes (amphisbaena), striped

boalisks,  tree  pythons,  two-headed  adders,  whipsnakes,  winged

vipers, and other harmless varieties.

Known dragons include Borcher (male adult bronze dragon),

Chellewis  (female  adult  copper  dragon),  Girac  (male  old  brass

dragon), Janic (female old brass dragon), Narbdy (female young

adult brass dragon), Nusas (female adult bronze dragon), Naelere

and  Thyka  (female  old  bronze  dragons),  Kasidikal  (female

mature adult black dragon from Orogoth), Landillew (female

very old red dragon), Mejas and Miteach (male young copper

dragons),  Topher  and  Sivert  (male  adult  brass  dragons),  and

Troberdene (male red wyrm).

Serpents  Tail  Stream:  Winding  along  the  eastern  edge  of

the  Serpent  Hills,  the  Serpents  Tail  Stream  is  fed  by  count-

less streams as well as the River Catherine. Like the Winding

Water to the south, which it eventually joins, this small river

serves as a hunting ground for the black caimans (crocodiles)

and many swimming snakes that live along its banks. Ophidian

hunters often  sh from the western bank of the river, regularly

landing scaled salmon and horned trout. Periodic  oods cause

the Serpents Tail to rise high above its banks, and from time

to time the rising waters reveal the entrance to a long-forgotten

Anaurian crypt.

Eastern High Moor: The eastern reaches of the High Moor

are desolate and rocky. The small ravines and narrow ridges that

mark this portion of the wilderness gradually rise up to form the

Serpent Hills. The moors due west of the central Serpent Hills

are home to numerous hobgoblin tribes, most of which venerate

one of the resident wyrms of the region and war intermittently

with the serpentfolk. The moorlands to the west of the northern

Serpent  Hills  are  home  to  savage  human  tribes  of  Tethyrian

heritage, descended from the long-ago union of House Orogoths

Netherese servitors with scattered clans of primitive humans.

The human tribes have long warred with the ophidians of the

Serpent Hills, but in recent years pureblood yuan-ti interlopers

have transformed many of their human chieftains into tainted

ones in order to keep the barbarians in check.

Tor  of  Swords:  This  granite  upcropping  stands  just  east

of  the  most  northeasterly  loops  that  the  ever-twisting  Wind-

ing  Water  makes.  Named  for  the  quintet  of  Anaurian  blades

entombed within the hill before the erection of the Standing

Stone, this tor is often confused with the nearby Dungeon of

Swords and hence rarely visited by adventurers.

The hill once marked the northern border of the Helbryn,

the great hunting preserve of the long-ago dwarven kingdom of

Oghrann. Caverns hewn from the base of the tor form Endar

Aglandtor, the Sword Grotto, which serves as an abbey of Haela

Brightaxe. The ablest swordswomen of Haelas Host now wield

the magic blades for which the tor is named, often clashing with

the serpentfolk who venture down from the hills to plunder the

battle elds where dwarf warriors fell in ages past.

Upper Winding Water: The upper reaches of the Winding

Water  wend  from  the  heart  of  the  Marsh  of  Chelimber  to

Boareskyr Bridge. Above the bridge, the rivers water is potable,

but many intelligent creatures avoid it anyway for fear of con-

suming Bhaal water. The Winding Water is slow and turbid,

making  its  way  along  a  wide  and  marshy  bottomland  and

leaving small swamps and oxbow lakes in its passing. Black cai-

mans (crocodiles) and swimming vipers are the most common

predators along the river, but many monsters haunt its banks

as well.

Important Sites

The Serpent Hills feature numerous sites of interest to travelers

and adventurers.

Anaurian  Crypts:  Ancient  tombs  of  the  Netherese  dating

back to the time of Anauria (339 DR to 111 DR) are scat-

tered  throughout  the  Serpent  Hills.  Each  of  these  crypts  is

linked to the rest via a network of portals, with the lower levels

of  the  Dungeon  of  Swords  serving  as  the  portal  nexus.  One

portal in the Dungeon of Swords leads to an empty tomb in the

Evermoors, and at least one other exits in the undercroft of a

vanished temple of Jergal beneath the shifting sands of what was

once Anauria, in the eastern reaches of Anauroch.

More  than  half  of  Anaurias  tombs  remain  undiscovered,

or  at  least  unbreached.  Lurking  within  are  sword-wielding,

spell-hurling  mummies  that  practice  the  ancient  traditions

of  Anaurian  battlemages.  The  serpentine  inhabitants  of  the

Serpent Hills have plundered most of the breached crypts, and

many now serve as armories or garrisons for small companies of

ophidian warriors. The ophidians have linked the lower levels of

most plundered tombs to the network of Serpent Tunnels that

extends  beneath  the  hills.  Although  each  tomb  is  thought  to

contain at least one portal, most of them remain undiscovered,

even in tombs that have already been plundered.

Boareskyr Bridge (Small Town, 1,112): Great Prince Boares-

kyr, the Snarling Boar, was a noted adventurer and the founder

of the realm that bears his name. Boareskyr built the  rst bridge

over the Winding Water at this site to attack the rampaging orcs

of the Bloody Tusk in the eponymously named year (661 DR).

Over the centuries since Boareskyrs overwhelming victory,

the bridge has been rebuilt several times. The most recent ver-

sion, made of black stone, dates back to the Time of Troubles,

when its predecessor was destroyed in a battle between Bhaal and

Cyric. Statues to the two gods now guard the way across.

The Bridge, a near-permanent tent city of caravanners, usu-

ally lines the road south of the Winding Water. This settlement

was  abandoned  during  the  Phaerimm  War  (1372  DR),  but  it

has since reappeared as a local hub for commerce. Yuan-ti pure-

bloods, tainted ones, and even ophidians frequent the tent citys

markets, selling Najaran artifacts and making careful note of

travelers passing along the Trade Way.

Dungeon of Swords: The Dungeon of Swords lies in the heart

of the southern Serpent Hills. The only access is via a natu-

ral cavern that opens on the shadowed face of a small hill.

From  there,  a  narrow  shaft  leads  down  to  a  se-

ries of worked mining tunnels and small rooms

carved decades ago by the rock

gnomes of Clan Argentum.

adventuring bands to take up residence in the gnome clans for-

mer living chambers and explore deeper into the crypt. A careful

study of the tombs inscriptions by the second company that en-

tered revealed that it was the Tomb of Thausimbel Thardresk,

the greatest king of the distant and now-fallen realm of Anau-

ria, which was renowned for swordmaking and gems.

In  the  Year  of  the  Unstrung  Harp  (1371  DR),  agents  of

the Cult of the Dragon drove out the last of the adventuring

bands and began to mount their own forays into the Dungeon

of Swords. After battling many lizardfolk and other reptilian

horrors  that  had  crept  down  from  the  surface  and  taken  up

residence in the catacombs over the years, the Dragon Cultists

discovered that the Tomb of Thausimbel Thardresk was but a

false front for many hidden levels and additional crypts below.

An  initial  foray  into  these  lower  levels  revealed  the  presence

of  numerous  portals  but  eventually  proved  disastrous  because

of the many Underdark creatures that had migrated up from

below (including a mature adult deep dragon). After slaying the

wyrm, the Dragon Cultists were forced to retreat from its mate

through a randomly chosen portal that deposited them amongst

some ancient, sunken ruins in the depths of the Evermoors.

Great Petri ed Serpent (Large Town, 2,730): In the midst

of  the  Serpent  Hills,  astride  the  upper  reaches  of  the  River

Catherine, the petri ed body of a gigantic serpent lies mostly

buried in the ground. One coil of its immense body forms an

arch over the  owing waters, while its head and tail protrude

from the rocky ground some 500 feet apart.

No one knows whether this massive statue was once a living

snake that was petri ed by some powerful working of the Art,

or whether it is the remnant of some ancient golem. In either

case, if it traveled in a straight line to get to this point, its must

have come directly from the village of Serpents Cowl on the

In  the  Year  of  the  Gate

western edge of the Forest of Wyrmsand hence the ruins of

Ssthartissssun.

Ere the death of Terpenzi,  rst king of Najara, the yuan-ti

took over the Great Petri ed Serpent and transformed it into a

fortress. The tail had already been hollowed out by a Netherese

archwizard during the Netherese Age of Discovery (1205 DR

to 696 DR) and turned into a sorcerers tower (now home to

Ssenstyr Sresshin, CE male halfblood yuan-ti sorcerer 16 of

the  Coiled  Cabal).  Deep  beneath  the  serpents  tail,  ophidian

craftsmen have since fashioned a stunning palace built around

a pool that has magical healing propertiesa favorite retreat

for wounded nagara.

The  central  arch  of  the  serpent,  which  spans  the  River

Catherine, has been hollowed out to serve as both a covered

bridge and a merchants trading area. Beneath the serpents

head,  one  tunnel  leads  away  into  some  ancient,  gnome-dug

salt mines, which now serve as waystations for visiting yuan-ti

and connect to the network of tunnels that crisscrosses the

Serpent  Hills  region.  Lower  still,  another  level  serves  as  a

subterranean prison.

The mouth of the great petri ed serpent is the destination

of a one-way portal from the outskirts of Surkh, and the obser-

vatory atop the tip of the tail holds a skull-shaped portal that

leads to Skullport (speci cally the bowels of Zstulkk Ssarmns

private residence) when used with the correct key (a live snake

or snake and skull). The wrong key (a disembodied skull alone)

deposits the unwary in the Barrens of Doom and Despair. The

two portals are now part of a network linking the Black Jungles,

the  outskirts  of  Surkh,  the  Serpent  Hills,  and  the  depths  of

Undermountain. The portal to Skullport, however, dates back

to  the  era  of  the  Netherese,  when  it  connected  a  Netherese

demesne with the Sargauth Enclave.

Harkstag: The ruined village of Harkstag lies northeast of

neighboring  Serpents  Cowl.  Because  it  lacked  the  protective

wards of Ssthartissssun, Harkstag was destroyed in the Year

of the Snarling Dragon (1279 DR) by one of the green dragons

living in the Forest of Wyrms.

Before  its  destruction,  the  village  was  home  to  Garshond

of  Helm  and  his   edgling  temple-keep,  the  Watch-Tower  of

the  Vigilant.  Backed  by  the  merchant  families  who  attended

his Council of Helm, Garshond founded the Vigilant Riders to

protect the roads linking Waterdeep, Baldurs Gate, and Irieabor

in the Year of Flowers (1265 DR). Garshonds efforts incited the

brigands and goblin tribes of the region, uniting them against

him in a series of battles that became known as Garshonds War

(1266 DR to 1268 DR).

Today, the ruins of Harkstag and the Watch-Tower serve as

a secure base for the yuan-ti of Najara. From there, the serpent-

folk can keep a close eye on events in and around Serpents Cowl,

the Trade Way, and the banks of the Winding Water.

Heartwing Estate: Heartwing Estate is a pegasus-breeding

farm  owned  by  Aluena  Halacanter  (N  female  human  wizard

9/Harper mage 3), one of three adventurers who used to main-

tain order in the tent city south of Boareskyr Bridge. With the

departure of her companions and the rising threat of the yuan-ti

in the forest, Aluena is so preoccupied with keeping her holdings

and the village of Serpents Cowl safe that she can spare little

time for policing the tent city downstream. She continues to sell

trained pegasi to wealthy adventurers for 5,000 gp each.

Illitharear: In the eastern reaches of the Forest of Wyrms

lies  the  Redwood  Ring,  an  ancient  druid  circle  thought  to

date back to the height of Shantel Othreier. Unlike most such

circles, which consist of stone menhirs, the Redwood Ring is a

circle of living redwood trees, each of which has a rune-graven

menhir embedded in the depths of its trunk. This abandoned

druidic  circle  is  barely  identi able  as  such  because  so  many

other  trees  have  grown  up  in  and  around  the  original  ones.

Potent  weavings  of  the  Art  still  linger  amidst  the  trees  of

Illitharear, but the jaculis that infest the region quickly devour

most interlopers.

Ithkyxans  Lair:  Ithkyxan,  one  of  the  twelve  spirit  nagas

currently serving King Ebarnaje, is also the appointed guardian

of a pair of portals linking the border of the High Moor and

the Serpent Hills with the depths of Halasters Halls. The portal

from the Slitherswamp level of Undermountain opens onto an

area of rolling grasslands in the shadow of the Serpent Hills.

Some 3 miles away, in a bowl-shaped valley between two rocky

ledges, lies an ancient Anaurian tomb that Ithkyxan plundered

two decades ago. Now guarded by a company of  fty yuan-ti

warriors,  the  old  tomb  opens  onto  the  subterranean  Lake  of

Bones, which is fed by an underground waterfall from a spring

deep in the hill. An ancient shrine to Mask lies in the depths,

near a portal that has two keyed destinations. One key operates a

one-way portal that opens in the depths of Skull Pool on Level

Three of Undermountain; the other opens a two-way portal to

the  Dungeon  of  Swords.  Only  Ithkyxan  and  its  fellow  spirit

nagas know the secret of the portal keys.

Keep  of  the  Lizard  King:  King  Amiskal  rules  the  lizard-

folk  and  muckdwellers  of  the  Serpent  Hills  from  an  ancient

Anaurian tomb that, once plundered, was converted into living

quarters. The former crypt is carved into a hillside in the north-

ern reaches of the Serpent Hills, and Amiskals throne rests atop

the dais where the sepulcher once lay. A secret portal somewhere

in the crypt connects with the portal network centered on the

Dungeon of Swords.

Lyrans Hold: Due east of Boareskyr Bridge, on the western

edge of the Forest of Wyrms, lie the ruins of a stronghold built

by Lyran, a well-known bandit lord. The ravages of time and

several battles between green dragons in search of lairs long ago

destroyed the keep itself. All that remains is a dark, overgrown

stone tower atop an extensive underground complex of storage

caverns and passagesnow monster-infested.

Harpers and other heroes used to journey to the forest to

battle  a  fallen  archlich  who  lived  here,  but  two  adventurers

 nally  slew  him  and  occupied  the  tower  in  the  Year  of  the

Prince (1357 DR). Durg Earthforge (NE male shield dwarf

rogue 10) and Songya of Baldurs Gate (LE female Tethyrian

human  cleric  11  of  Loviatar),  now  the  self-styled  lords  of

the  hold,  nurse  ambitions  of  controlling  the  lucrative  trade

that passes over Boareskyr Bridge. Skeletons and zombies, still

following their dead masters instructions, patrol the surround-

ing forest, and serpentfolk are said to inhabit the catacombs

beneath the ruins.

Netherese Villas: The ruins of Netherese villas dot the hill-

tops along the Serpent Hills. Dating back to the Silver Age of

Netheril (2758 DR to 2207 DR), most of these villas have

been claimed by the ruling nagas and yuan-ti of Najara. The new

owners typically leave the surface structures in ruins but make

extensive changes to the dungeons that lie beneath. Many such

subterranean complexes are linked via the Serpent Tunnels to

sites elsewhere in the Serpent Hills.

Orogoth: Founded in 2482 DR, the ruined villa of House

Orogoth dates back to the Silver Age of Netheril and has long

been  a  beacon  for  treasure  seekers.  The  Netherese  wizards  of

this  family  sought  to  acquire  draconic  powers  as  well  as  the

ability to assume dragon form. The elder wizards disappeared

to live elsewhere as dragons (or so rumor holds), leaving their

gigantic, sprawling abode to their decadent descendants. These

latter-day Orogoths magically compelled dragons (possibly their

elders in draconic  form) to seize treasure from  the  hoards of

fellow wyrms and other sites across Faern and bring it back for

their amusement.

Almost  inevitably,  the  cruel  scions  of  House  Orogoth

destroyed one another in 2211 DR in a great battle that in-

volved pitting dragons against their kin. The great villas towers

toppled, and the survivors  ed for their lives. Exactly what the

Orogoths  battled  over  is  unknown,  but  in  the  Year  of  Moor

Birds (90 DR), the yuan-ti of Ssthartissssun recovered a host

of artifacts dating back to the empires of the sarrukh (including

at least one tome of ancient spells) from the ruins.

Today, the ruins of Orogoth are home to the Old One, a

black dracolich great wyrm, and the offspring of its great-grand-

son, Wastirek (black wyrm). Wastireks mate is Vilholin (black

wyrm), and their children include Awsidorg and Woklef (male

adult black dragons), Cheleen (female young adult black dragon),

and  Kasidikal  (see  the  Serpent  Hills).  Efforts  by  adventurers

and the Cult of the Dragon to plunder Orogoths treasures have

come  to  naughtthose  who  dare  try  are  slain,  transformed

into  beast  shape,  or  sent   eeing  across  the  High  Moor.  The

serpentfolk of Najara have linked the depths of Orogoth with

the Serpent Tunnels beneath the Serpent Hills, and yuan-ti ex-

plorers continue to haunt the ruins despite the dragons efforts

to drive them away.

Serpents Cowl (Village, 795): This small village sits on the

western edge of the Forest of Wyrms just upstream of Boares-

kyr Bridge, where the waters are safe enough to  sh. Named for

the ruins of Ssthartissssun on which it stands, Serpents Cowl

consists of a handful of cottages clustered around a small square.

The  only  guesthouse  is  the  Dusty  Dragon,  whose  owner  sells

food to visitors. The populace consists primarily of woodcutters,

hunters, farmers, and  shermen.

Local  legend  deters  the  villagers  from  digging  cellars  or

pits,  for  fear  of  opening  a  route  into  the  ruins  below.  The

villagers  continue  to  live  amidst  the  dangerous  ruins  because

of  the  protection  provided  by  the  Netherese  wards  that  still

cloak Ssthartissssun. These wards were designed to prevent the

passage  of  Scaled  Ones,  dragons,  and  all  other  reptilian  hor-

rors. But unbeknownst to the Cowlers, the wards have started

to fray, and Medium and smaller serpentfolk and scalykind can

now enter the lower ruins through subterranean tunnels aligned

with apertures in the lower wards. Should a large hole in the en-

circling ward ever open aboveground, one of the dragons living

in the Forest of Wyrms is sure to make a quick snack of the

villages inhabitants.

Serpent Tunnels: A subterranean network of tunnels links

the holdings of the serpentfolk in this area. With Ssessethenaa

at its nexus, the tunnel network serves as an underground high-

way  system  for  much  of  the  Serpent  Hills.  Beyond  the  heart

of Najara, the Serpent Tunnels extend under the southern and

eastern  fringes  of  the  High  Moor  to  give  access  to  the  Lair

of  Ithkyxan  and  the  ruins  of  Orogoth.  They  also  lead  under

the  Forest  of  Wyrms  to  connect  with  Ssthartissssun  and

Sszuraassnee, and out to the caverns beneath Mount Hlim, at

the southern tip of the Greypeaks Mountains.

Ssessethenaa  (Large  City,  24,372):  The  City  of  Sunning

Serpents lies at the heart of the Serpent Hills, atop and within

the largest tor of the chain. Ophidian laborers have constructed

a host of gardens, chapels, and shrines on the spiraling terrace

that  winds  its  way  up  the  hill,  making  seven  full  revolutions

before reaching the top. At the apex of the tor lies a sprawling

temple  complex  to  Sseth,  shaped  like  a  massive  serpent  head.

The yuan-ti and ophidian clerics who rule the city live here, and

the rest of the inhabitants live within the twisting tunnels and

chambers that honeycomb the hill.

Since Ssessethenaa is the nexus of the Serpent Tunnels, a

great deal of traf c passes beneath its terraced slopes. At the

heart of the city lies a two-way portal to the Elemental Plane

of  Earth.  Ophidian  miners  pass  through  it  each  day,  mining

the rich vein of gems adjacent to its terminus and fending off

elemental predators.

Sskhanaja  (Small  City,  5,278):  Located  in  the  western

Serpent Hills near the border with the High Moor, the city of

Sskhanaja (also known as the Snake Pit) is the modern capitol

of Najara. Beneath a small valley surrounded by hills, the city

encircles a narrow shaft that descends deep into the Underdark.

A  spiraling  ramp  coiling  down  the  walls  offers  access  to  side

chambers  every  quarter  revolution.  The  shaft  is  warded  with

a permanent levitate spell that allows the citys inhabitants to

navigate its many levels with ease. At the bottom of the shaft

(more than a mile beneath the surface), water that drips down

from above passes through a one-way portal to the Elemental

Plane of Water.

Sskhanaja  is  a  restricted  city,  inhabited  only  by  Najaras

ruling  dark  nagas,  their  attendants,  and  their  guards.  Small

family groups of yuan-ti and individual dark nagas live in sub-

terranean chambers that line the central shaft, each attended by

a host of ophidian servants. The primary palace of Ebarnaje lies

about thirty revolutions below the surface, surrounded by the

palatial abodes of the highest-ranking nagara. Six spirit nagas

and Terpenzi (see page 31), the bone ha-naga who was Najaras

 rst king, constantly attend Ebarnaje.

Slaves garrisoned elsewhere in the Serpent Hills regard the

Snake Pit with well-deserved horror. The decadent serpentfolk

who dwell therein are well known for the gruesome experiments

they perform in their ongoing attempts to recreate the ancient

practices of the sarrukh.

Sskowlynraa (Small Town, 1,573): The City of Spellskins

dates back to the reign of Terpenzi, when Ssthartissssun was

the capitol of Najara. Long the preserve of serpentfolk wizards

interested  in  rediscovering  and  advancing  the  ancient  magics

of  the  sarrukh,  Sskowlynraa  was  abandoned  in  the  Year  of

the Vanished Tattoo (92 DR), following Najaras defeat by the

Shadowkings forces two years before. In the Year of the Gri-

moire (1354 DR), yuan-ti wizards of the Coiled Cabal reoccupied

the City of Spellskins, making it a base for their explorations of

neighboring Ssthartissssun.

Sskowlynraa lies within the southern reaches of the Forest

of  Wyrms,  in  the  depths  of  an  overgrown  ravine  lined  with

cavemouths. Each cluster of caverns is now home to a different

school of magical inquiry, and magic-hewn tunnels link them all

together. The subterranean reaches of Sskowlynraa are linked

via the Serpent Tunnels to the depths of Ssthartissssun and the

Serpent Hills to the north. Ophidian-driven caravans of pack

lizards regularly bring fresh supplies to the City of Spellskins

and pick up recovered relics for transport elsewhere.

Ssthartissssun:  The  ruined  City  of  Fountains  dates  back

more than thirty millennia to the era of the sarrukh empires,

although it was one of the lesser realms of that age. Built as a

temple-city by the cult of Ssharstrune, it was abandoned after

the death of the god and left for eons to the guardianship of the

bone ha-naga Terpenzi. Thousands of years later, Ssthartissssun

was rebuilt by ophidian followers of Terpenzi as the capitol of

Najara, then transformed once again by the yuan-ti they had

magically  summoned.  In  the  Year  of  Moor  Birds  (90  DR),

Netherese wizards in the employ of the Shadowking destroyed

the city for a second time, and its serpentine inhabitants  ed

north into the Serpent Hills.

Today, the ruins of Ssthartissssun lie at the western edge

of  the  Forest  of  Wyrms,  beneath  and  around  the  village  of

Serpents  Cowl.  Flickering  Netherese  spell  barriers  that  were

erected  by  agents  of  the  Shadowking  to  expel  the  serpentfolk

still deter most would-be explorers. The Coiled Cabal, however,

 nally penetrated the magical wards in the Year of the Serpent

(1359 DR).

At  the  heart  of  Ssthartissssun  lies  the  Shrine  of  Cowled

Serpents, a temple of Ssharstrune that was rededicated to Sseth

after the arrival of the yuan-ti. This buried shrine contains the

legendary Naja Fountain, which served as the lair of the bone

ha-naga  Terpenzi  while  it  guarded  the  legacy  of  the  sarrukh

before the arrival of the ophidians.

The  ruins  of  Ssthartissssun  are  home  to  all  manner  of

monsters, many of which were summoned as guardians from the

southern jungles by the arcane spellcasters of the Coiled Cabal.

Ti-khana dinosaurs, bone dark nagas, and sword spiders guard

treasures dating back to the sarrukh and the  rst Kingdom of

Snakes, as well as Netherese artifacts plundered from Orogoth

and other ruins throughout the Serpent Hills.

Sszuraassnee  (Large  City,  17,998):  The  City  of  Abomi-

nations  lies  in  the  depths  of  the  northern  Serpent  Hills,

about  one-half  mile  below  the  lizardfolk  kingdom  of  Kalran.

Sszuraassnee is situated along a dry subterranean riverbed that

once  drained  runoff  from  the  southern  Greypeaks  into  the

depths. The serpentfolk have carved the citys walls to resemble

the  digestive  tract  of  a  massive  snake.  This  disturbing  image

is  reinforced  by  the  faint  acidic  tang  that  clings  to  the  air,

making  breathing  uncomfortable  for  creatures  unused  to  this

environment.

Sszuraassnee  serves  as  the  serpentfolks  primary  trading

link with the Underdark. The yuan-ti who rule this place still

honor a centuries-old alliance with the illithids of  Llacerellyn,

which lies in the Middle Underdark north of the Serpent Hills.

As a result of the good relations between these races, numer-

ous  yuan-tillithids  (half-illithid/half-yuan-ti),  with  their

distinctive,  viper-headed,  scaly  tentacles,  roam  the  City  of

Abominations. Drow merchants from Eryndlyn (beneath the

northern High Moor) and Sshamath (beneath the Far Hills)

are  frequent  visitors  to  Sszuraassnee,  as  are  derro  traders

from  Tsenviilyq,  which  lies  in  the  lower  Underdark  beneath

the  border  between  the  High  Moor  and  the  Serpent  Hills.

Grimlocks  from  the  Underdark  settlement  of  Reeshov  also

frequent the City of Abominations.

Regional History

During the Silver Age of Netheril (2758 DR to 2207 DR),

the  Netherese  began  establishing  outposts  in  the  wild  lands

to the west, which are now known as the Western Heartlands

and the North. Some of these pioneers sought badly needed re-

sources, while others set up isolated bases from which to perform

their magical experiments. A handful of outposts established in

the southern reaches of the High Moor and the area now known

as the Serpent Hills were linked by a network of portals with the

heartlands of Netheril.

The Netherese wizards of House Orogoth built a forti ed

villa in the southern reaches of the High Moor in 2482 DR,

near the northern edge of the Serpent Hills. Several genera-

tions  of  Orogoths  sought  the  power  of  Faerns  wyrms,  and

legend has it that some eventually obtained itat least after a

fashion. One early byproduct of House Orogoths research was

the Serpent Curse, a magical malady that transformed humans

into  a  snakelike  race  that  Orogoths  elders  named  ophidians.

Many  of  House  Orogoths  Netherese  servants  succumbed  to

this  plague  and  were  driven  into  the  hills  to  the  west  circa

2300 DR. Unable to rid the place of the curse, the wizards

eventually replaced their former servants with constructs and

undead servitors.

In the centuries that followed, the ophidians organized into

savage tribes. These clans battled each other, the nearby clans of

lizardfolk, the barbaric descendants of Orogoths exiled human

servants, and the scattered tribes of gnomes that had settled the

hills after their emancipation by the Netherese in 2387 DR.

During this era, many of the ophidian tribes began venerating

dragons,  perhaps  in  keeping  with  House  Orogoths  obsession

with the great wyrms.

In  the  Year  of  Bold  Pioneers  (461  DR),  the  phaerimms

beneath Netheril began casting the lifedrain spells that would

eventually transform all of Low Netheril into the Great Desert

of Anauroch. While High Netherils nobles conducted business

as usual in their sky cities as if nothing of import were occur-

ring,  the  rich  farmlands  that  employed  and  fed  the  bulk  of

Netherils populace quickly fell barren. The residents of Low

Netheril began migrating west and south, felling great swaths

of  the  Far  Horns  Forest  within  just  a  few  generations.  The

Netherese settlers put increasing pressure on the eastern ter-

ritories  of  the  ophidians  and  lizardfolk,  forcing  the  reptilian

races to retreat farther south and west. Eventually, the Scaled

Ones had to concede the eastern slopes of what the Netherese

called the Serpent Hills.

In the Year of Mageserpents (361 DR), a band of ophidians

stumbled  across  the  ruins  of  an  ancient  sarrukh  city,  hidden

beneath what is now the western end of the Forest of Wyrms.

During  their  explorations,  the  ophidians  discovered  the  Naja

Fountain,  an  ancient  artifact  of  the  sarrukh  inhabited  and

guarded by a powerful ha-naga named Terpenzi. Claiming to be

the prophet of the World Serpent, the creature proclaimed itself

King of Najara and began a decades-long campaign to subjugate

the scattered tribes of ophidians to its rule.

In the Year of Sundered Webs (339 DR), the fall of Netheril

precipitated a  nal and nearly wholesale exodus of humans from

the lands of Low Netheril. Many Netherese migrated south and

west  into  the  area  now  known  as  the  Backlands.  This  exodus

in turn prompted the remaining free tribes of ophidians to

migrate  to  Ssthartissssun,  leaving  the  Serpent  Hills  to  the

scattered clans of lizardfolk and gnomes. Unbeknownst to both

groups,  Netherese  from  the  distant  realm  of  Anauria  began

constructing  tombs  beneath  the  hills,  accessing  them  via  the

ancient portal established during the Silver Age of  Netheril.

Under  the  tutelage  of  Terpenzi,  the  ophidians  studied  the

ancient  magics  of  the  sarrukh  and  learned  to  summon  all

manner  of  reptilian  monsters.  Anticipating  the  rising  power

of the Netherese survivor states, the ophidians summoned the

Hssta  tribe of yuan-ti from the southern jungles of Faern in

the Year of Netted Dreams (320 DR). While Terpenzi plotted,

the yuan-ti built a great temple at the heart of the city, with the

Naja Fountain at its core, and  rmly established themselves as

Najaras ruling caste.

Meanwhile, to the north, the scattered clans of rock gnomes

were  forced  to  withdraw  to  the  Trielta  Hills  by  the  growing

power of the lizardfolk, who had formed the tribal confedera-

tion of Kalran in the central and northern Serpent Hills. By

the   rst  century  Dalereckoning,  the  Kingdom  of  the  Snakes

had emerged as a regional power in its own right alongside such

human states as the Tal rian- and Netherese-ruled Duchy of

Indoria (located in the area known today as the Fields of the

Dead), the Tal rian city of Talis in the depths of the Reaching

Woods, and the Netherese-ruled subterranean realm of Philock,

which lay just east of the Wood of Sharp Teeth (now known as

the Netherese Caverns).

In the Year of Purloined Power (34 DR), a Tal rian bard

named Verraketh Talember discovered the Shadowstar, a mys-

terious artifact that fell like a shooting star into the High Moor.

While the artifact slowly transformed him into the Shadowk-

ing, Verraketh gathered an army of shadow-spinners and began

forcibly assimilating the Netherese and Tal rian realms of the

Chionthar river valley into the empire of Ebenfar.

In the Year of the Faithful Oracle (89 DR), the heretofore

immortal Terpenzi foresaw its own death at the hands of the

Shadowking. In response, it ordered its subjects to seek out the

magics of ancient Netheril while it searched for a mate. In the

Year of the Moor Birds (90 DR), the serpentfolk plundered the

ruins of Orogoth and brought back many Netherese artifacts,

while Terpenzi hid its dark naga offspring in a secret hold in the

Serpent Hills. Thus prepared, Terpenzi assembled a great army

of ophidians commanded by yuan-ti to attack the growing might

of Ebenfar.

The serpentfolk might well have prevailed had it not been

for  a  band  of  Netherese  wizards  in  Verrakeths  employ,  who

teleported  into  great  temple  of  the  serpentfolk  and  expelled

Terpenzi from the Naja Fountain. Although the ha-naga and

its followers escaped, the armies of Ebenfar destroyed the city of

Ssthartissssun, cloaked its ruins in powerful warding spells, and

scattered the serpentfolk of Najara. Terpenzi led its remaining

111

armies into battle with the Shadowking but was destroyed. The

surviving serpentfolk  ed the battle eld (now called the Fields

of  the  Dead)  with  their  kings  remains,  but  the  Kingdom  of

Snakes was no more.

In the centuries that followed, scattered tribes of ophidians

battled  the  lizardfolk  of  Kalran  for  control  of  the  Serpent

Hills, all the while harried by the Shadowkings armies. But un-

beknownst to the humans of Ebenfar, the followers of Terpenzi

were plotting the rebirth of their realm. The surviving yuan-ti

labored  in  the  depths  of  their  secret  hold  to  raise  Terpenzis

brood and school the young dark nagas in the ways of magic.

One of the ha-nagas offspring, Jacinica, became the new king-

in-exile of Najara in the Year of the Prowling Naga (142 DR).

As its  rst of cial act, Jacinica ordered the remains of Terpenzi

to be transformed into a bone naga and enslaved to the bearer

of the artifact known as the Marlspire of Najara.

The greatest obstacles to the resurgence of Najara were the

empire  of  Ebenfar  and  the  kingdom  of  Shavinar,  which  lay

between  the  Troll  Hills  and  the  River  Chionthar.  Shavinar

eventually fell to trolls in the Year of Broken Flame (277 DR),

and Ebenfar collapsed after the imprisonment of the Shadowk-

ing in the Year of the Miscast Shadow (323 DR), thus clearing

the way for a new regime. But before the rulers of Najara could

establish much in uence, both the Shoon Imperium and the

Kingdom of Cormyr decided to extend their in uence into the

Western  Heartlands  in  the  Year  of  the  Fearless  King  (361

DR). Among the immigrants in the ensuing wave of human

migration  were  some  Varae-worshipers  from  the  Shining

Plains  who  came  north  in  search  of  Ssthartissssun.  When

these humans unleashed an artifact created by House Orogoth

and left behind by the yuan-ti, they were transformed en masse

into ophidians.

The collapse of the Shoon Imperium in the Year of the Corrie

Fist (450 DR) once again left the way clear for the serpentfolk.

But the sudden death of Jacinica in the Year of Rolling Heads

(452 DR) precipitated a decades-long power struggle among the

nagara that lasted until the Year of the Fortress Scoured (511

DR),  when  Nejizar   nally  ascended  to  the  throne  of  Najara.

The new dark naga king established its rule over the serpentfolk

in  the  Year  of  Trials  Arcane  (523  DR),  thanks  in  large  part

to its alliance with a dozen spirit nagas. By then, however, the

Tricrowned Kingdom of Phalorm had claimed the High Moor

and begun constructing a chain of fortresses along the western

border of the Serpent Hills.

Since Najara was too weak militarily to confront the Realm

of Three Crowns directly, Nejizar sent yuan-ti in ltrators south

to the Reaching Woods in the Year of the Alabaster Mounds

(577 DR). Their mission was to incite the hobgoblin tribes of

the region to march northward in a great horde. But in ltrators

dispatched  by  Phalorm  dealt  the  hobgoblins  a  sharp  check  at

the Battle of Notched Axes, then ensured the victory of King

Ruardh Lightshivers armies at the Battle of Blunted Fangs by

assassinating the serpentine provocateurs. This defeat forced the

serpentfolk of Najara to retreat into the Serpent Hills.

The  Principality  of  the  Snarling  Boar  was  destroyed  in

the Year of the Slain Mountain (993 DR), when a great spell

battle  erupted  at  the  head  of  the  Winding  Water  between

Taskor the Terrible of Irieabor and the Wizard of the Crag.

After both archmages vanished, imprisoned water elementals

ran  amok,  inundating  Boareskyr  and  leaving  behind  the

Marsh  of  Chelimber  in  their  wake.  Many  of  the  lizardfolk

tribes that had long inhabited the northern Serpent Hills took

advantage of this development to migrate eastward into the

newly  forming  marsh.  Those  left  behind  were  too  weak  to

oppose the armies of Najara, which had grown strong since

the fall of Delimbiyran, the Kingdom of Man, in the Year of

the Shrouded Slayer (671 DR). Thus, the lizardfolk kingdom

of  Kalran  soon  became  a  vassal  state  of  the  Kingdom  of

Snakes in all but name.

Over the next three centuries, Najara slowly grew in power

under the guidance of various dark naga kings counseled by the

nagara and the yuan-ti nobility. Cognizant of the risks posed

by humanity and its allies, the serpentfolk of Najara contented

themselves with claiming the Serpent Hills and continuing to

in uence the rest of western Faern from the shadows. One by

one, the human-ruled successor states to Ebenfar that had once

ruled the Western Heartlands were undermined by yuan-ti in l-

tration. Eventually, the Winding Water river valley was devoid

of major human settlements, and the Western Heartlands were

free of human-ruled realms larger than city-states.

Since its ascension to the throne in the Year of the Orm-

serpent (1295 DR), the dark naga Ebarnaje has continued the

cautious strategy of its predecessors, but it dreams of reclaiming

the  city  of  Ssthartissssun  as  its  seat  of  power.  Although  its

forces  could  easily  conquer  the  village  of  Serpents  Cowl,  the

dark naga king is well aware of the response such an outright

attack  would  provoke  from  the  Lords  Alliance.  Instead,  the

dark  naga  king  has  dispatched  a  succession  of  agents  to  the

village with orders to gradually transform its inhabitants into

tainted ones. The king has also backed the Coiled Cabals efforts

to explore the ruins below Serpents Cowl. The dark naga king

believes that such a two-pronged campaign will eventually bring

the region under its direct control without any outside challenge.

In anticipation of the day that Najara must wage war with its

neighbors, Ebarnaje has backed the rise of the Cult of the Dark

Naga,  a  far-wandering  organization  of  dark  nagas  pledged  to

recover all manner of spells and magic that might advance the

power of Najara.

Plots and Rumors

Najara is rich with opportunities for adventure by virtue of its

many inhabited areas and the factions that control them.

Cult of the Dark Naga: The Cult of the Dark Naga is a

loose-knit organization run by a septet of Najaran dark naga

nobles known as the Seven. The group is discreetly backed by

Ebarnaje, the king of Najara. Long allied with Manshoon and

the Zhentarim, the Cult of the Dark Naga arrived in force in

the Dalelands after the Year of Moonfall (1344 DR) to plun-

der the ruins of Myth Drannor.

Such  plans  quickly  ran  afoul  of  the  phaerimms,  whose

subtle hand had guided the nagara to the City of Beauty in the

 rst place. To gain control of the nagara, the Myth Drannan

lich  Druth  Daern  perpetrated  a  complex  deception.  Speaking

through a wraithlike apparition that he created above a certain

Myth Drannan altar, he claimed to be Ssharstrune, the Ghost

Nagaa  long-dead  naga  god.  With  Daerns  unseen  help,  the

Ghost Naga revived the nagara who had not survived the thorn-

backs  as  bone  nagas  to  serve  their  living  kin.  Since  then,  the

Ghost Naga has been guiding the Seven in a hissing whisper and

creating a veritable army of undead nagas. Now that the Myth

Drannan phaerimms have  nally been severely weakened, if not

destroyed, the Ghost Nagas followers (and hence Druth Daern)

are  actively  contesting  with  the  resident  devilkin  for  control

over the citys ruins.

Subversion of Serpents Cowl: Aluena Halacanter and some

older residents of Serpents Cowl believe they have a sacred duty

to watch the area lest the yuan-ti return. They grow nervous

about the increasing number of ophidians approaching the mer-

chants at Boareskyr Bridge, apparently hoping to purchase any

Netherese artifacts unearthed from nearby ruins. They also fear

the rising numbers of snakes and snakelike creatures within the

Forest of Wyrms.

But  the  brave  defenders  of  Serpents  Cowl  remain  com-

pletely unaware of the true threat to their city, which has little

to do with ophidian traders or mutant serpents. The yuan-ti

of the Serpent Hills have recently developed a technique for

infecting  humans  with  a  tiny  portion  of  their  corrupted  es-

sence to create a new kind of servitor called a tainted one. Such

altered humans can pass freely through the wards that encircle

the village. In recent years, numerous villagers have been way-

laid  during  furtive  forays  outside  the  wards  and  turned  into

tainted ones, who now carry out missions within the village

for their yuan-ti masters. Others have disappeared from the

village altogether and now serve as broodguards in the yuan-ti

brood chambers.

The ancient sarrukh empire of Okoth collapsed millennia ago,

only to be slowly reborn over the last several centuries. Today,

the  Empire  of  the  Shimmering  Sun  encompasses  the  entire

Lake of Salt, including the salt  ats along Azulduths edge that

are revealed during the hot season. A loophole in the ancient

treaty between Mulhorand and Unther left the waters of the

Lake of Salt unclaimed. Thus, hints of the sarrukhs renewed

presence in the heart of their ancient homeland have been ig-

nored by the slumbering Old Empires, even though Mulhorand

now rules much of Unther.

Okoth  is  ruled  by  the  remnants  of  the  Okothian  sarrukh,

who have for now put aside the differences that shattered their

empire long ago in a civil war. The bulk of the realms populace

consists of wereserpents and werecrocodiles (immigrants from

the  ruins  of  Sekras).  Okoths  inhabitants  spend  most  of  their

time  lurking  in  ancient  caverns  and  ruins  beneath  the  salt

 ats (or the waters edge, depending on the time of year). They

venture forth only to battle extraplanar khaasta raiders and to

recover ancient Okothian artifacts from the surrounding lands.

Life and Society

Though the Lake of Salt is one of Faerns harsher environ-

ments, this dry, hot region is perfect for the reptilian races of

Okoth.  The  inhabitants  live  furtive  lives,  sneaking  about  the

southern reaches of Mulhorand and Unther to avoid drawing

the ire of the God-Kings of the Old Empires and their servants.

Both  the  wereserpents  and  the  werecrocodiles  spend  much  of

their time in animal form, allaying the suspicions of the Mulan

while adding to the dangerous reputation of the regions wildlife.

When  so  directed,  however,  they  assume  humanoid  form  and

in ltrate the surrounding communities.

Although the lords of the Great Clans nominally rule Okoth,

in truth the fractious Okothians are held together by the iron

will of Pilitith, the albino sarrukh lord of Clan SarRuuss (see

page  60).  Pilitith  lairs  amidst  the  ruins  of  SarRukoth,  the

ancient seat of his clan and now the capitol of the realm. From

there,  the  albino  sarrukh  directs  the  escalating  war  with  the

khaastas and entertains emissaries from the Church of Set.

Major Geographical Features

Only  two  waterways  break  the  vast  desert  above  and  around

Okoth.

Azulduth:  The  Lake  of  Salt  is  a  shallow,  highly  salinated

body of water drained by the River of Swords in the southeast-

ern reaches of Mulhorand. During the hot season, large portions

of  Azulduth  dry  up,  forming  salt   ats  for  months  at  a  time.

Azulduth is home to the sarrukh clans of Okoth, wereserpents

members of the Cult of Set, and increasing numbers of were-

crocodiles from Sekras.

Green  Sword  River:  The  River  of  Swords  has  formed  the

boundary  between  Unther  and  Mulhorand  since  the  First

Mulhorand-Unther  War  (1967  DR  to  1961  DR).  The

Green Sword River, its eastern tributary, serves as a pathway

for  werecrocodiles migrating upstream to Azulduth from the

ruined  city  of  Sekras,  which  lies  at  the  junction  of  the  Blue

Sword and Green Sword Rivers.

Important Sites

Though Okoth appears featureless, the old empire of the sarrukh

still boasts several points of interest to adventurers.

Azun (Small Town, 1017): On the western shore of Azulduth

lies the small town of Azun. Built as a waystop along the cara-

van  trail  from  the  Council  Hills  to  Durpar  and  the  Golden

Water,  the  town  hosts  a  steady  stream  of  Durpari  merchants

heading north and west to the lands along the Inner Sea. Azuns

inhabitants also derive small incomes from  shing in the Lake

of Salt and mining the salt  ats during the summer months.

One  of  Azuns  most  frequent  visitors  is  Baylox  (LN  male

Mulan human wizard 14/archmage 3), Master Mage of Shussel,

the  reigning  authority  on  Okothian  magics  and  oft-consulted

sage.  Intrigued  by  increasing  reports  of  reptilian  activity  in

and  around  Azulduth,  Baylox  continues  to  collect  evidence

for  his  secret  theory  that  the  ancient  inhabitants  of  Okoth

have returned.

Buldamar (Village, 578): On the desolate eastern shore of

Azulduth  lies  the  village  of  Buldamar.  This  settlement  grew

up around a series of semipermanent camps established by ad-

venturers exploring the sprawling Okothian ruins known as the

Vaults of Record. The fortunes of the villagers have ebbed and

 owed for centuries when such delvings came into and out of

vogue. When adventurers are few, the villagers eke out a subsis-

tence living by mining salt and  shing for the few  sh that still

swim in Azulduths depths.

Today the town is bustling anew, although few suspect that

many of the bands of adventurers based here are not what they

seem. The Okothian sarrukh have recently begun sending bands

of wereserpents and werecrocodiles in human form into the ruins

to search for any artifacts that might have escaped centuries of

plunderers. Other Okothian agents are poring over the towns re-

cords in hopes of learning what items were removed in centuries

past and by whom. Pilitith intends to employ human members

of the Cult of Set to track down the missing artifacts and return

them to their rightful owners. This plan, should it come to frui-

tion, is likely to result in a wave of mysterious thefts and killings

in the elite quarters of Mulhorands  northern cities.

Nezrams Tower: On the outskirts of Azun lie the ruins of

Nezrams Tower. Torn apart nearly seven centuries ago by the

young  green  dragon  Chaathuuladroth,  Nezrams  Tower  was

largely looted of its treasures rst by the dragon and then by

Nezrams descendants who now live in the town of Nezras on

the eastern slopes of Mulhorands Sword Mountains. Neverthe-

less, adventurers continue to visit the site, hoping to recover the

hidden magics of the legendary Archtransmuter.

SarRukoth: This ancient ruin lies buried in the heart of a

low hill in the southern salt  ats of Azulduth. The hill becomes

an island in the colder months, when the lower catacombs  ll

with saltwater.

SarRukoth  is  the  ancient  steading  of  Clan  SarRuuss,  the

most powerful of the surviving great clans of ancient Okoth.

The stronghold now serves as the capitol of New Okoth and the

seat of power for Pilitith, its albino sarrukh ruler.

The  surrounding  ruins  house  several  dozen  Okothian

sarrukh,  plus  several  hundred  wereserpents,  werecrocodiles,

and  emissaries  of  the  Church  of  Set  who  attend  them.  Most

Okothian artifacts recovered by the sarrukh are brought back

here for analysis and, should any prove useful, replication.

Vaults of Record: The Vaults of Record are ancient Okothian

ruins on the outskirts of Buldamar, a desolate village far from

civilization.  Discovered  in  the  early  days  of  Mulhorand  and

Unther,  the  vaults  were  plundered  of  their  treasures,  which

were used to build the magical might of Mulans twin empires.

Today they lie empty, though they still draw a steady stream of

adventurers hoping to turn up long-lost treasures.

Regional History

During   rst  era  of  the  Days  of  Thunder  (more  than  35,000

years ago), the sarrukh ruled over all Faern, centering their

power  in  three  major  empires.  The   rst  and  easternmost  of

these was Okoth, founded circa 35,000 DR along the forested

shores of Azulduth, which was then the largest freshwater lake

in Faern. Like their kin in Isstossef  l and Mhairshaulk, the

Okothians  created  many  races  in  their  own  image,  including

lizardfolk and others long since vanished.

Okoth crumbled after less than a millennium, when a devas-

tating civil war forced its feuding great clans to  ee across the

planes. The races they had created were left behind to  nd their

own homelands and survive as best they could.

During  their  plane-walking,  the  Okothian  sarrukh  expe-

rienced  alternating  periods  of  growth  and  decline.  Several

millennia  ago,  in  the  Barrens  of  Doom  and  Despair,  they

chanced upon a reptilian race known as the khaastas, which

they incorrectly assumed to be descended from their own liz-

ardfolk  creations.  An  ill-considered  attempt  to  enslave  these

creatures resulted in a war between the two races that raged

for centuries. When the tide turned in favor of the khaastas,

the Okothian sarrukh  ed across the planes with their foes at

their heels.

In the Year of the Nesting Harpy (643 DR), Nezram the

Transmuter, author of the famed spell tome boastfully entitled

Unique Mageries, left his tower on the western shore of Lake

Azulduth to explore the outer planes. Nearly forty years later,

most of his Mulan descendants were scattered or slain when a

young  green  dragon  named  Chaathuuladroth  tore  apart  Nez-

rams Tower in the Year of the Zombie Lords (681 DR). The

victorious dragon  ew off to the lonely, mountainous regions to

the west with most of Nezrams treasures.

Unbeknownst  to  anyone  else,  Nezram  had  spent  a  great

deal  of  time  studying  the  ancient  legacies  of  Okoth  and

knew of the sarrukh. When he discovered an ancient portal

in the depths of Azulduth, he passed through it in hopes of

discovering what had become of these once-mighty creatures.

Nezrams fate is not recorded, but an ancient warding spell

alerted the scattered sarrukh clans to the use of their long-

forgotten portal and prompted at least one group to return

secretly to Faern in the Year of the Rampaging Raaserpents

(699 DR) to investigate.

In  the  centuries  that  followed,  increasing  numbers  of

Okothian sarrukh returned to their ancient homeland in hopes

of  evading  the  vengeful  armies  of  the  khaastas.  Amidst  the

ruins of their former empire, the Okothians hoped to recover

their  long-buried  weapons  and  hide  long  enough  to  rebuild

their strength.

The latter wish came to naught when the  rst khaasta raid-

ing  party  passed  through  the  portal  in  the  Year  of  the  Gate

(1341 DR). Although the sarrukh managed to close the ancient

portal and destroy the raiders before they could alert their fel-

lows, the disappearance of this group drew additional bands of

khaastas to Faern in subsequent years.

During  the  Time  of  Troubles  (1358  DR),  the  Okothians

secretly approached the divine minions of Set with a brazenly

treacherous offer: In exchange for assisting Set in binding their

god Sseth into eternal slumber, the Mulhorandi Lord of Evil

would  grant  the  sarrukh  spells  and  aid  them  in  their  ancient

battle with the khaastas. Set accepted their proposal and created

the  rst wereserpents to mark the agreement. He also convinced

his sometimes-ally Sebek to send a host of werecrocodiles up the

River of Swords to serve in the Okothians army.

Today, the Okothian sarrukh and the khaastas have reached a

dtente of sorts. The khaastas continue to dispatch raiding bands

to Faern, but the Okothian sarrukh continue to hold them off,

thanks to their newfound patron and an army of lesser allies.

Frustrated by their inability to take Okoth, the khaastas have

recently begun appearing elsewhere in Faern, hoping to learn

more  about  the  world  of  their  ancient  enemies  and  discover

other sarrukh enclaves and ruins.

Plots and Rumors

Though many of its treasures have been plundered, the ancient

realm of Okoth still holds many secrets.

Legacies  of  Nezram:  Nezras,  grand-nephew  of  Nezram

the Transmuter, arrived in Myth Drannor in the Year of the

Tainted Troll (683 DR) to study at the Six Tyryl Towers. Explor-

ers of the ruined City of Beauty have recently recovered some

letters  that  Nezras  wrote  to  his  elven  wife,  a  fellow  student

named  Raejiisa  Sicafei,  whom  he  married  in  the  Year  of  the

Unshriven (686 DR). Penned in the Year of Portents Perilous

(707 DR) during a visit Nezras made to Mulhorand, the letters

discuss  reports  of  powerful  serpentfolk  haunting  his  grand-

uncles ruined tower and give an accounting of his inconclusive

spell battle with one of them. These letters are among the few

sources of  rsthand information about the sarrukh that exist in

Faern today. Baylox, noted sage of Okothian lore, has learned

of their existence and is now seeking a party of adventurers to

recover them for him.

Nightmares of the Slumbering Serpent: By betraying their

god Sseth, the Okothian sarrukh acquired a more active divine

patron and a host of new servitors. But the bound Sseth slum-

bers restlessly, and his nightmares have roused serpentfolk across

Faern from centuries of somnolence. Led by the yuan-ti and

sarrukh of Serpentes, the serpentfolk have begun plotting anew

against the Scaleless Ones who have plundered their ancient trea-

sures and stolen their rightful lands. A few also plot against the

Okothians, who some suspect are responsible for Sseths recent

troubled state.

Return of the Khaastas: The khaastas, having  nally traced

the  eeing Okothian sarrukh back to their ancient homeland,

are now seeking to annihilate their ancient foes once and for all.

To that end, the khaastas have dispatched scouting parties across

Faern  to  seek  out  the  ruins  of  the  ancient  sarrukh  empires.

Scattered  skirmishes  between  the  khaasta  scouts  and  various

serpentfolk and scalykind creatures have given rise to rumors of

a reptile war.

Wyrm  Hatchery:  As  a  result  of  the  strong  rains  during

the  past  few  seasons,  water  has  seeped  into  lower  portions  of

Azulduths  salt  bed,  causing  several  magically  preserved  eggs

of wyverns and dragons to hatch. The wyrmlings proceeded to

crawl and  y north, eating whatever they could  nd. Enterpris-

ing wizards in Mulhorand are trying to catch these creatures

while young in hopes of training them as guardians or as mar-

tial aid in the conquest of Unther. The Mulan do not suspect

that the rain-summoning spells of the sarrukh are behind these

developments; instead they blame the Red Wizards of Thay for

their infamous weather-controlling spells.

Samarach

Capitol: Samargol

Population: 434,510 (humans 99% [Tashalans 80%, Chultans

19%, Halruaans (Nimbrese) 1%], yuan-ti 1%)

Government: Monarchy (vassal state of Nimbral)

Religions: Leira (Cyric), Squamata the Black (Sseth [now Set])

Imports: Weapons

Exports: Pearls, salt, spices

Alignment: CN, CE

The Hidden Kingdom of Samarach lies along the southern shore

of the Chultan Peninsula, between Thindol and the Jungles of

Chult. Although independent of Nimbral, Samarach is a vassal

state of the Seahaven ruled by one of the twelve Nimbral Lords.

Mountain  passes  leading  to  Samarach  are  cloaked  in  veils  of

illusion (treat as widespread hallucinatory terrain effects made

permanent), and the kingdoms settlements are protected by high

walls and overlapping permanent images.

Life and Society

The ophiophobic inhabitants of Samarach are consumed with

the  fear  that  traitors  lurk  in  their  midst.  Trust  is  rare,  even

among family members, and lying is the cultural norm.

While all adults are expected to contribute to the defense of

the realm, those who practice spellcastingparticularly spells

from the school of Illusionare most highly regarded. A sharp

cultural split divides the Nimbrese nobles from the Chultan and

Tashlutan commoners. Although there has been no hint of re-

bellion, cultural and class differences continue to rankle a sizable

percentage of the populace.

Samarach is governed by an individual known as the High

Phantasmage. The position rotates among Nimbran archmages,

each of whom assumes the title and rules from a few years to

a few decades before surrendering the rulership to another. The

current ruler, High Phantasmage Meleghost Zoaster (CN male

human  illusionist  20/archmage  5),  has  already  governed  for

many  years,  and  whispers  among  the  Nimbrese  nobility  sug-

gest that he has no intention of returning to Nimbral. Some

attribute this decision to the burgeoning power of the Leiran

(Cyricist)  priests,  who  settled  in  Samarach  in  large  numbers

after the Time of Troubles, when the Nimbral Lords banned

any state religion or organized priesthood in the Seahaven.

Samarach is extremely unwelcoming to outsiders. In fact, its

nobles often use scrying to spy on unwanted visitors and then

af ict them with nightmares from afar until they leave. Any

outsiders who seem to pose a true danger are attacked repeat-

edly from the shadows by phantasmal killers. Although foreign

merchants are not permitted in the Hidden Kingdom, a handful

of Samarachans who have approval from the High Phantasmage

to act as merchants occasionally set sail from the port of Sa-

margol or travel overland via the Sormarl Pass. Despite all these

precautions,  the  Hidden  Kingdoms  inhabitants  are  consumed

with ophiophobia, and pogroms against suspected agents of the

serpentfolk are not uncommon.

Major Geographical Features

Numerous natural landmarks dot the realm of Samarach.

Beacon Rocks: This cluster of a dozen or so barren islets lies

in the Great Sea, almost midway between the Snout of Omgar

and  the  Seahaven  of  Nimbral.  On  the  largest  of  these  rocks

stands  the  Beckoning  Tower  of  Shoon  (formerly  the  Beacon

Tower  of  Shoon),  which  was  built  as  a  lighthouse  during

the reign of Shoon IV. Like the Sea Towers of Irphong and

Nemessor, its better-known cousins in the Nelanther Isles, the

Beckoning Tower is 40 feet high and 25 feet across. A wooden

door at the base leads to a winding stair along the outer wall,

which gives access to three levels of empty chambers. At the

top of the tower shines a continual  ame effect that is visible

for miles.

After the fall of the Shoon, an unknown spellcaster attached

a powerful effect similar to a sympathy spell (caster level 20th)

to this tower, and now any human who sees the structure or its

light is magically drawn toward it. Efforts to dispel this effect

have come to naught, and now the light that once guided ships

to safe passage far from the shores of the Wild Coast instead

forces vessels rounding the Horn of Chult to hug the peninsulas

southern coast or risk foundering on the Beacon Rocks.

Narubel  Pass:  This  all-but-forsaken  pass  connects  the

city-state of Narubel with the town of Taruin by way of the

depths  of  the  Samarlogh.  Even  if  trade  were  still  permitted

between the two cities, the dangers of the Samarlogh make such

travel infeasible.

River Samar: This peaceful river arises from a con uence

of creeks near the town of Taruin and winds its way to the

Bay of Omgar, draining the Sanrach Basin. The banks of the

river are lined with small farming hamlets, and  at-bottomed

merchant scows ply its waters. Because the populace lives in

fear that water-dwelling serpentfolk might swim up this vital

artery,  massive  dwarf-forged  nets  block  the  mouth  of  the

river,  and  smaller  versions  are  raised  and  lowered  at  check-

points spaced approximately 10 miles apart between Samargol

and Taruin.

Samarlogh, The: Northwestern Samarach includes the Sa-

marloghthe southeasternmost tip of the Jungles of Chult,

which is cut off from the rest of the great forest by the western

Sanrach Mountains. Samarachan legends speak of Squamata

the  Black,  the  embodiment  of  the  ever-encroaching  jungle

that swallows up anyone who dares the dark depths of the Sa-

marlogh. Although Samarachan warriors regularly patrol the

jungles borders, the depths of the Samarlogh are true wilder-

ness areas inhabited by  ocks of corollaxesMM2 and carnivorous

forest  slothsMM2,  as  well  as  countless  other  monsters.  A  few

abandoned strongholds of the Sauringar yuan-ti tribe also lie

within its depths.

Sanrach Mountains: This semicircular mountain chain par-

tially surrounds the Sanrach Basin, nearly dividing the Jungles

of Chult from the rest of the Chultan Peninsula. The heavily

forested  eastern  slopes  of  the  western  Sanrach  Mountains

form the western edge of the Samarlogh. These jungle-covered

foothills support scattered populations of blood apesMM2 and

cloaked apesMM2.

Snout of Omgar, The: This rocky, uninhabited peninsula ex-

tends south into the Great Sea, separating Samar Bay from the

waters of the Wild Coast. The Snout is named for the great sea

serpent (treat as a sea drakeFF advanced to 36 HD) that lairs in

a large sea cave on the western side of its tip. Omgars outrageous

toll varies according to the beasts whim, but most ships quietly

pay it regardless of amount, since ships that stray too far away

from land risk foundering on the Beacon Rocks. The areas lesser

caves are home to tribes of yurians (known locally as aldani, or

lobster-men).

Sormarl Pass: This narrow pass winds through the south-

western  reaches  of  the  Sanrach  Mountains,  connecting  the

Thidolian  town  of  Samagard  with  the  Samarachan  town  of

Sorl.  The  pass  is  cloaked  in  hallucinatory  terrain  spells,  and

only heavily armed caravans dare to traverse it. From time to

time,  an  individual  vanishes  from  a  passing  caravan,  leaving

only an eerie, high-pitched whine in his wake. This phenomenon

has given rise to rumors that at least one ethereal marauder

haunts the area.

Important Sites

Samarach boasts several signi cant towns and cities.

Mines of Selgol: First established in the waning days of the

Shoon Imperium, the mines of Selgol are among the most pro-

ductive salt mines of the Chultan Peninsula. Their output has

been shipped east and north to the lands bordering the Shining

Sea and the Lake of Steam for centuries.

In the Year of Writhing Darkness (572 DR), deep-digging

Thindolese  miners  broke  through  to  the  Underdark  region

known  as  the  Firelands.  In  the  centuries  since,   renewt  ma-

rauders and salamanders from the Burning Rift have plagued

the mines of Selgol, and they still pose a constant threat to the

doughty miners.

Rassatan  (Small  City,  10,936):  The  City  of  Gilded  Pearls

nestles  in  a  steep-sided  bowl  at  the  head  of  Rassatan  Bay.  A

high stone wall divides the city from the docks below. A single

gate leads through the center of the wall, and a well-patrolled

tunnel leads through the back of the bowl to another forti ed

gatehouse overlooking the  elds of the Sanrach Basin. The in-

habitants  of  Rassatan  dwell  in  small  burrows  carved  into  the

terraced  walls  of  the  bowl.  The  City  of  Gilded  Pearls  is  best

known for the oyster beds that lie beneath the shallow waters of

the bay. These proli c beds produce the highest-quality golden

pearls available in Faern.

Samargol (Metropolis, 105,731): On the eastern bank of the

River Samar, at the head of Samar Bay, is the City of Veils, the

home of nearly a quarter of Samarachs population. Although

most of the citizens (both male and female) do wear masks or

veils in public, the citys name actually stems from the count-

less  illusions  woven  by  the  Nimbrese.  These  dweomers  make

the city appear to be little more than a handful of shacks and

a small lords keep from the outside and the grandest city in all

of Faern from the inside.

A heavily forti ed double ring wall protects this sprawling

city. The inner wall encircles a low hill on which most of the

Nimbrese  aristocrats  dwell,  including  the  High  Phantasmage.

The  majority  of  the  citys  real  wealth  is  concentrated  in  this

district. No gates mar the inner walls strength, so at least in

theory, only those who can  y (either magically or mounted on

pegasi) can enter or escape this isolated enclave. In fact, a hand-

ful of tunnels penetrate the foundations of the wall, but their

use is illegal, as are attempts to climb the wall.

The outer wall encircles the bulk of the city and is pierced by

only three tiny gates. One leads north to Taruin, another leads

east to Rassatan and Sorl, and the third opens onto the river.

The city docks lie outside the walls within arrow range of the

guards atop them. All traf c into or out of the city is physically

and magically searched. This high degree of security results in a

general scarcity of most goods and prices that are double those

elsewhere in Faern.

Sorl (Large Town, 4,612): This garrison town protects the

western end of Sormarl Pass. Built into the walls of the steep-

sided gorge that marks the western end of the pass, the town

is divided into two halves: Northface and Southface. The cave

117

mouths  that  honeycomb  both  sections  are  linked  by  narrow

stone staircases carved into the rock. Northface serves as living

quarters for the legion of troops based here, while Southface is

home to the merchants who cater to the needs of the soldiers

and their families. A pair of stout, forti ed walls known as the

Westgate and the Eastgate block the western and eastern ends

of the gorge, respectively.

Taruin (Large City, 23,899): The City of Seven Spices lies

near the con uence of the creeks that form the

River Samar. Many of the rare spices for which

Samarach is known are gathered in the  elds sur-

rounding  Taruin,  and  salt  caravans  from  the

mines of Selgol regularly pass through

this walled town on their way to

the  scows  that  will  transport

their  cargo  to  Samargol.

A  large  contingent  of

Samargols  army  is

based  in  Taruin,  and

its leaders use the city as

a  staging  area  for  extended

patrols along the borders of

the Samarlogh.

Flying Hunt

Regional

History

The isolated realm of Samarach was

once the western half of Thindol. At that time, its

populace was dominated by Tashlutan immigrants who settled

the Sanrach Basin after the Tashalar Campaigns (circa 300 DR).

(See the Regional Histories of the Tashalar and Thindol, below,

for more details.)

In the Year of Many Serpents (605 DR), the Thindolese in

both the Chultan-dominated east and the Tashlutan-dominat-

ed west unmasked a host of yuan-ti in ltrators in their midst.

During the months of anarchy that followed this event, roving

bands of ophiophobes attacked anyone they suspected of possess-

ing serpentine ancestry. Unlike the eastern Thindolese, the folk

of western Thindol  ed en masse, marshaling a great  otilla of

ships and sailing for the fabled isle of Nimbral.

After  a  great  storm  dashed  much  of  this  slapdash   eet

against the Beacon Rocks, a legion of pegasi-mounted Knights

of the Flying Hunt appeared above the remnants of the  eet and

ordered the Thindolese to return to their homes. After listen-

ing to their pleas for mercy, Lord Samar, a Nimbral Lord and

the commander of the Nimbran legion, agreed to return to the

Chultan Peninsula with the refugees and drive the yuan-ti from

the Sanrach Basin.

Once  the  survivors  returned  home,  the  archmage  Samar

cloaked the mountain passes and roads of the realm in veils of

illusion, then began a decades-long hunt for the agents of the

yuan-ti.  In  time,  the  western  Thindolese  began  calling  their

isolated land Samarach, after the  rst Nimbral Lord to rule it

118

actively, and the inhabitants of the realm came to consider it a

vassal state of distant Nimbral.

Plots and Rumors

Despite the tight security of Samarach, rumors abound of ser-

pentfolk plots.

Harim of the Jahi: Rumor holds that a debauched, hedonistic

cult of serpent-worshiping

sorceresses  known  as  the

Harim  of  the  Jahi  dwells  in  the  jun-

gles depths. Any woman who vanishes

in the jungle is assumed to have joined the

cult, and any man who disappears is said to have

fallen prey to its members.

In truth, the Harim of the

Jahi  is  a  cabal  of  pureblood

yuan-ti  from  the  Sauringar

tribe.  Its  leader  is  an  undead,

three-headed  serpent  known  as

a  jahiMM2  that  embodies

the  unful lled  desires  of

the  yuan-ti  to  reclaim

the  Chultan  Peninsu-

la.  The  jahis  current

chosen  one  is  Ssent-

enna  DiNastassa  (CE  female

pureblood  yuan-ti  cleric  5  of  Sseth/

sorcerer 5/mystic theurge 8), a snake-tongued

seductress of unparalleled beauty.

Capitol: Ssintheessaree

Population: 126,487 (yuan-ti 58%, wild dwarves 41%, sarrukh

Religions: Sseth (now Set) (sarrukh, yuan-ti), Thard Harr (wild

Alignment: LE, NE

The Serpentes Empire once stretched from the Lhairghal (Hal-

ruaas West Wall) to the Peaks of Flame, and from Sheirtalar

to the Snout of Omgar. Now, however, its leaders openly rule

only in the Black Jungles. Still rent by the ancient tribal feuds

that laid the empire low, Serpentes has only recently reawakened

from centuries of somnolence and begun to reassert its authority

over the Chultan Peninsula.

Life and Society

Of the  ve great yuan-ti tribes in the Chultan Peninsula, only

three have signi cant holdings in the Black Jungles. At present,

620_96566_SerpentKin92-135.indd   118

these tribes are openly contesting with each other for the throne

of Sseth. Two of those tribes, House Eselemas and House Jennes-

tas, have forged a loose alliance. In reality, however, that pact is

more an acknowledgement of shared weakness against the more

powerful SeSehen tribe than a sign of unity of purpose.

Each tribe claims a number of overgrown steadings in the

depths  of  the  jungle,  from  which  its  members  dominate  the

surrounding terrain. Since the ever-encroaching jungle threat-

ens  any  building  left  untended,  most  such  habitations  remain

semi-ruined, even though gangs of slaves do their best to keep

them habitable.

Until recently, the bulk of the serpentfolk in this area dis-

played a curious apathy that left them content to hunt, exploit

and torture their slaves while dreaming of ancient glory. Since

the Time of Troubles and the brief appearance of Sseths avatar,

however, centuries of such somnolence have given way to a new-

found energy. Much of that energy is directed at undermining

the plots of rival tribes and investigating the mystery of Sseths

condition, but the yuan-ti of Serpentes have also begun to work

in concert against their common foehumanity. In accordance

with the Sacred Way of Sseth, the yuan-ti have begun placing

their agents into positions of power so as to weaken neighboring

realms from within. This strategy is in part one of necessity,

since the human kingdoms currently possess far more military

might than the yuan-ti do, but it also ties in with a prophecy.

Yuan-ti legends speak of the rebirth of Sseth in mortal form

heralding  the  rise  of  Serpentes,  and  no  tribe  wishes  to  move

prematurely before the god (or his successor) returns.

Like yuan-ti elsewhere, the inhabitants of Serpentes are di-

vided into three primary castes: abominations, halfbloods, and

purebloods. The abominations rule through the halfbloods, who

in turn command the purebloods. Tainted ones and broodguards

are relatively new castes that rank below purebloods but above

slaves.  Anathemas  are  considered  divine  minions  of  Sseth,  so

they stand apart from the normal caste system. Holy guardians

and mageslayers (see Chapter 6) also hold unique ranks outside

the caste system, although most are accorded the privileges of

clerics  and  arcane  spellcasters,  respectively.  The  few  surviving

sarrukh are treated with reverence and their direct orders are

always  obeyed,  but  they  lack  the  power  to  unite  the  tribes  or

truly rule them.

Major Geographical Features

The Serpentes Empire encompasses a wide range of geographi-

cal features.

Black  Jungles:  So  thickly  canopied  that  the  jungle   oor  is

cloaked in near-darkness (treat as shadowy during the day), the

Black Jungles are home to thousands of animals, plants, and in-

sects. So great is the diversity here that several hundred kinds of

creatures may reside in each acre. Of the trees known elsewhere

in Faern, mangroves, silverbarks, suth trees, and zalantar trees

are most common. All kinds of predators stalk the Black Jungles,

but carnivorous plants, dinosaurs, giant constrictor snakes, and

winged vipers are most common. The southwestern reaches are

dominated by tribes of primates, including apes, blood apesMM2,

cloaked apesMM2, and gambolsMM2, as well as girallons, gorillas

(treat as paci stic apes), and monkeys. The yuan-ti rule supreme

here, patrolling the jungles regularly and driving the most dan-

gerous predators east into the Mhair Jungles to protect the ruins

of Mhairshaulk.

Remnants  of  the  past  glory  of  Serpentes  are  everywhere,

though most such ruins are overgrown with jungle plants. Stone

statues of long-dead yuan-ti abominations and crumbling walls

are the most common signs of past habitation, but larger ruins

can be found as well. Ancient caches of building stones, pottery,

glass, and metalwork are sometimes revealed when giant trees

fall  in  storms.  Those  who  dig  beneath  such  troves  may   nd

ancient catacombs stretching deep into the earth.

Lake  Lemas:  This  small,  freshwater  lake  forms  part  of

the  border  between  the  Black  and  the  Mhair  Jungles.  Fed  by

innumerable  streams  and  two  small,  unnamed  rivers,  it  sends

its  waters  to  the  River  Lemas  and  thereby  to  the  Lapal  Sea.

Lake Lemas lies at the heart of the Eselemas tribal lands, and

numerous overgrown holds dot its western shore. The lake itself

is home to a clutch of elder tojanidas, which the Eselemas clerics

called  forth  from  the  Elemental  Plane  of  Water  long  ago  to

defend the tribe.

Lapal Sea: The Lapal Sea is actually a freshwater lake sur-

rounded by junglethe Black Jungles to the west and the Mhair

Jungles  to  the  east.  The  cool  breezes  blowing  over  the  water

break  the  suns  unforgiving  heat  and  disperse  the  swarming

clouds of gnats and biting insects that hover about the area.

The  lake  is  fed  by  four  riverstwo  originating  in  a  spur

of the Hazar mountain range to the north, and the other two

bubbling up in the midst of the Mhair Jungle. Water from the

lake then  ows gently toward the Great Sea to the south. Boats

are almost unknown on the Lapal Sea, since the yuan-ti of the

Sseradess  tribe  prefer  to  swim,  and  those  of  other  tribes  ride

harnessed  elasmosaurusesMM2.  Herds  of  wild  elasmosauruses

dominate the Lapal Sea, although ahuizotlsFF, chuuls, and dark-

tentaclesMM2 are numerous as well.

Lapalgulph: At the mouth of the River Lapal is a brackish

bay that drains the Black and Mhair Jungles into the Great Sea.

The Jennestas tribe keeps careful watch over these waters from

the jungle-covered hills on the western side of the Lapalgulph,

and a Gargantuan dragon turtle (advanced to 30 HD) guards the

waters below in exchange for regular offerings from the yuan-ti.

The eastern edge of the Lapalgulph marks the beginning of a

vast mangrove swamp that stretches almost to Mhairhetel. This

area is the preserve of numerous solitary sword spiders.

Mhair Jungles: The Mhair Jungles lie between the Lapal Sea

and the West Wall of Halruaa. This dark, tropical forest con-

tains all manner of plant and animal life, most of it unknown

anywhere else. Large numbers of carnivorous plants, duskwoods,

phandars, shadowtops, silverbarks, suth, and zalantars grow in

this jungle, along with a profusion of less dangerous plant life.

Once  the  center  of  the  sarrukh  empire  of  Mhairshaulk,

the Mhair Jungles are now home to all manner of monsters.

Because the yuan-ti of Serpentes consider this land sacred, they

119

come here only to hunt, scour the ruins of Mhairshaulk, and

drive off intruders. The northern Mhair Jungles are the pre-

serve of dire tigers, digesters, and many nomadic tribes of wild

dwarf  hunters.  Except  for  the  absence  of  yuan-ti  tribes,  this

area bears a strong resemblance to the Black Jungles. The wetter

southern reaches eventually give way to vast mangrove swamps

hunted by solitary sword spiders and nagahydras.

Yuan-ti anathemas dwell in and among the most important

ruins of Mhairshaulk, attended by lesser yuan-ti who have fore-

sworn  their  tribal  allegiances.  Other  major  ruins  are  claimed

by  solitary  Faernian  ha-nagas  and  nagahydras.  Lesser  ruins

are  uncommon  on  the  surface  because  the  jungle  growth  has

wholly devoured them over the course of millennia. Scattered

sinkholes throughout the Mhair Jungles lead into the Serpent

Deeps, and explorers are advised to watch out for sinkhole traps

set by dwarven hunters.

River Amarast: This sluggish watercourse wends deep into

the  heart  of  the  SeSehen  tribes  territory.  The  river  is  home

to  the  ti-khana  elasmosaurusesMM2  that  some  yuan-ti  employ

as steeds.

River Chun: This fast-moving river races through a narrow

gorge in the heart of the Jennestas tribes territory. The river

is too shallow for waterborne travel, but the limestone walls of

the gorge are honeycombed with caverns that serpentfolk of all

tribes employ as crypts. Several of the deepest tunnels are said

to connect with the Serpent Deeps, and individual sarrukh oc-

casionally arise from hibernation far below the surface and make

their way to this region to forage.

River Lapar: Forming the southern boundary between the

Mhair and the Black Jungles, the River Lapar marks the eastern

edge of the Jennestas tribes territory (with the exception of the

Mhairhetel enclave). Mangrove swamps line both banks of the

river, making it dif cult to discern where the waterway ends and

the jungle begins.

About halfway between the Lapal Sea and the Lapalgulph,

seven stone pillars rise from the depths of the river to 40 feet or

more above the waterline. The Pillars of the Sarrukh, as they are

called, are inscribed with well-worn Draconic runes that detail

the  history  of  ancient  Mhairshaulk  under  both  sarrukh  and

yuan-ti rule.

River  Lemas:  The  River  Lemas  drains  Lake  Lemas  into

the  Lapal  Sea  and  marks  part  of  the  boundary  between  the

Mhair and the Black Jungles. It also marks the eastern border

of the Eselemas territories, so its banks are often patrolled by

yuan-ti. Somewhere along the rivers length lies the shattered

keel of a Halruaan skyship that was protected from decay by

ancient preservative magics. No one knows what cargo it carried

or what became of its crew, but the fact that Halruaan explorers

continue to search for it suggests that the ruined ship may yet

contain a priceless treasure.

River  Mhair:  The  River  Mhair  once  wound  through  the

heart of Mhairshaulk, and most of the remaining sarrukh ruins

in this area lie along its banks. From time to time, the river

adjusts its course to reveal new ruins, but for the most part, this

waterway is as wild as the enveloping jungles.

River Tharynd: This short and wild river plummets south

from the Delphin Mountains to the northernmost bay of the

Lapal Sea. An ancient trail from the Abbey of Tharynd (see

below)  winds  along  its  western  bank,  and  the  SeSehen  tribe

patrols that area regularly to guard against treachery from the

Eselemas tribe as well as foolhardy interlopers.

Serpent Deeps: The Serpent Deeps lie beneath the Black and

the Mhair Jungles, forming a vast subterranean network of cav-

erns that stretches from Lapalgard to Mhairhetel to Delselar.

At the heart of this extensive cavern system is the Lapal Un-

dersea, which is fed by water leaching from the lake above. The

Serpent Deeps are home to warring tribes of troglodytes, a few

Mhairshaulk sarrukh, and trenslizardfolk-troglodyte hybrids

bred at the height of Serpentes. Although hibernating sarrukh

have carved out small complexes throughout the Serpent Deeps,

most are clustered around the Lapal Undersea. From time to

time, the yuan-ti send emissaries to consult with their creators,

but such requests for aid are usually ignored.

Important Sites

Serpentes encompasses numerous thriving cities and towns, as

well as hundreds of ruins.

Mhairhetel (Small City, 9,782): At the southern tip of the

Mhair Jungles lies the City of Renegades. This isolated redoubt

is home to outcasts from nations all along the Great Sea. Be-

cause  ships   ying  any   ag  (or  even  none  at  all)  are  welcome

at  Mhairhetels  docks,  the  city  has  become  a  port  of  call  for

pirates from Narubel and Yaulazna (the hidden Bay of Pirates

in southeastern Halruaa), as well as a haven for slavers and dis-

reputable merchants. The citys reputation as a pirate port has

so far protected it well against attacks from the sea.

Hetel  Hastalhorn,  a  prominent  Halruaan  archmage  who

sought  to  exploit  the  hidden  riches  of  the  Mhair  Jungles,

founded the City of Renegades in the Year of Banished Wisdom

(125 DR). Within a year, Hetel had vanished and the settle-

ment  was  all  but  abandoned.  But  every  year  thereafter,  new

immigrants arrived seeking a home far from the lands of their

birth, and Mhairhetel slowly grew into a viable city.

For  centuries,  the  yuan-ti  tribes  of  Serpentes  have  found

Mhairhetel  useful.  Until  the  recent  alliance  of  the  SeSehen

tribe with the Rundeen merchant consortium, the City of Ren-

egades offered the only marketplace through which the yuan-ti

could trade with distant lands. Moreover, most humans of the

Great  Sea  lands  who  are  interested  in  exploring  the  Mhair

Jungles begin their journeys from this porta fact that makes

them easy to observe and track.

However, the yuan-ti have always ensured that one of their

own rules the City of Renegades, and that agents of the serpent-

folk control all the hidden levels of power. The current ruler

of Mhairhetel is Istas s Nsaran (NE male pureblood yuan-ti

 ghter 7), a member of the Jennestas tribe.

Ssdathinssatath:  Built  along  the  western  shore  of  Lake

Lemas,  Ssdathinssatath  was  once  the  provincial  capitol  of

the territory stretching from Sheirtalar to the Lapal Sea and

120

620_96566_SerpentKin92-135.indd   120

5/12/04, 4:21:16 PM

REALMS

from the Delphin Mountains to Talath Pass. Most of the city

has  fallen  into  ruin,  but  the  remaining  structures  house  the

bulk  of  the  Eselemas  tribe.  The  builders  of  Ssdathinssatath

favored wall carvings over statues, so the faades that have not

yet  crumbled  are  adorned  with  bas-reliefs  depicting  writhing

serpents and nagalike faces.

Ssintheessaree: The sprawling, ruined city of Ssintheessaree

lies on the northwestern shore of the Lapal Sea. Once the capitol

of Serpentes, Ssintheessaree fell into ruin after the disappear-

ance of Sseths avatar in the Year of Dreams (10 DR) and the

subsequent feuding among yuan-ti tribes over who would succeed

him as emperor. After centuries of intertribal skirmishing, the

SeSehen tribe  nally cemented its control over Ssintheessaree

in the sixth century Dalereckoning. Since then, members of this

tribe have used their slaves to clear the ruins of debris and re-

build wherever possible. Without the support of the other tribes,

however, the SeSehen can hope for little more than to keep the

jungle from reclaiming more of the ruins.

A  central  area  known  as  the  Pit  of  Vipers  still  forms  the

center of yuan-ti power in the Black and Mhair Jungles. Priests

of Ssethand most other yuan-ti, regardless of tribeconsider

the Pit of Vipers the most holy location on the face of Faern.

A vast egg chamber, tended by broodguards, lies under its cen-

tral altar. Deep in the bowels of the temple, a portal links the

priests of the SeSehen with their greatest allies, the yuan-ti of

Hlondeth.  Before  the  holiest  altar  of  Sseth,  where  the  avatar

himself coiled while he ruled Serpentes, lies a shallow pit full

of writhing snakes. In the center of this pit stands a raised dais

on  which  no  snakes  crawl.  Inscribed  with  a  mystical  pattern

formed of snakelike shapes, the dais serves as a keyless portal

that activates 5 rounds after any creature sets foot on its surface.

Yuan-ti accessing the portal use that time to assume postures of

reverence and respect. The portal transports all creatures stand-

ing on the dais at the instant it activates to an identical temple

in Hlondeth called the Scaled Halls of Varae. Because the two

temples are exact images of each other, users are often unaware

that they have gone anywhere at all.

Ssyintiasaminass: Situated midway between the head of the

River  Chun  and  Dolsel  Pass,  Ssyintiasaminass  was  once  the

provincial capitol of the southern Black Jungles and the Thindol

Basin. The yuan-ti who dwelled in this city experimented upon

the various primate species native to the region in hopes of cre-

ating a perfect slave race, but that effort was abandoned after

the fall of Serpentes. Today, the surrounding region is overrun

with  the  progeny  of  those  experimental  primates.  Thus,  in  a

sense, Ssyintiasaminass is the legendary City of Apes that

most Thindolese tales incorrectly place in the Guth Mountains.

In  recent  centuries,  the  Jennestas  tribe  has  claimed  the  ruins

of Ssyintiasaminass as its base, seeking to recover the ancient

beast-shaping magics that their creators once employed. Rather

than  repeat  the  failures  of  their  ancestors,  however,  the  Jen-

nestas have begun experimenting on human and hal ing slaves.

The  latter  were  abducted  from  the  borders  of  the  Southern

Lluirwood and brought back to the Black Jungles by way of a

two-way portal.

Regional History

The  southernmost  empire  of  the  sarrukh  was  Mhairshaulk,

which was founded about 34,800 DR and extended westward

from the Lhairghal to the Jungles of Chult. The Mhairshaulkans

are believed to have created nagas, pterafolk, and troglodytes, as

well as numerous other races long since lost. The yuan-ti were

the results of experiments that joined primitive humans with

the sarrukh of Mhairshaulk, with varying amounts of serpent

blood added to the mix.

Unlike such contemporaries as Isstossef  l and Okoth, sar-

rukh-ruled Mhairshaulk declined gradually, sinking slowly into

somnolence circa 33,500 DR. The sarrukh slowly dwindled in

number,  and  one  by  one,  the  remaining  individuals  entered  a

cycle  of  extended  hibernation  alternating  with  brief  periods

of  activity.  As  the  great  clans  of  the  sarrukh  withdrew  from

the daily governance of their realm, Mhairshaulk increasingly

became  the  preserve  of  the  yuan-ti.  Although  the  theocratic

vrael  olo  ruled  the  heart  of  Mhairshaulk  for  millennia,  the

rising  empires  of  the  batrachi  and  aearee  ensured  that  the

yuan-ti would never achieve the dominance that their creators

had enjoyed.

By the close of the Time of Dragons (circa 24,000 DR),

yuan-ti-ruled  Mhairshaulk  had  all  but  collapsed,  thanks

to  repeated  assaults  on  its  cities  by  the  great  wyrms  of  the

south. Around this time, an army of winged serpents known

as couatls appeared in the Jungles of Chult from lands to the

west,  called  into  service  by  the  god  Ubtao.  In  the  centuries

that  followed,  these  rival  creations  of  the  sarrukh  battled

each other for control of the peninsula. Time and again the

yuan-ti were forced to concede their westernmost holdings to

the couatls, until the war ended in a stalemate with the Hazur

Mountains as the dividing line.

For  millennia  thereafter,  the  Chultan  Peninsula  remained

the  preserve  of  powerful  individual  serpentfolk,  but  no  orga-

nized  empires  existed  there.  Around  the  time  of  Netherils

founding, the couatls began to decline precipitously in number,

so they decided to seek out another race to keep the western end

of the Chultan Peninsula free of yuan-ti in uence. Eventually,

they settled on the human tribes of a distant continent to the

southwest and preached to them the teachings of Ubtao. The

Eshowe, the Tabaxi, and the Thinguth tribes, as well as several

others that accepted Ubtaos message, followed the winged ser-

pents  in  a  great  pilgrimage  across  the  seas  to  the  Jungles  of

Chult in 2809 DR.

The tribes landed on the Wild Coast and marched inland to

the Peaks of Flame, where the avatar of Ubtao welcomed them.

After all but a handful of winged serpents had withdrawn from

southwestern Faern, the Father of Chults avatar founded the

great city of Mezro in 2637 DR. He dwelt there for a time

among the Tabaxi, the greatest of the tribes, while the other

tribes scattered throughout the jungles. Eventually the Father

of Dinosaurs withdrew, but not before imbuing Chult itself with

a portion of his essence. As an unintended consequence of this

action, a shadow of Ubtao was released into the ground.

121

Without the direct rule of the Father of Chult, a great war

broke out among the tribes, lasting from the Year of Dripping

Daggers  (438  DR)  to  the  Year  of  Unleashed  Sorrow  (122

DR).  During  the  con ict,  the  Eshowe  released  the  Shadow

Giant from the  oor of the Valley of Lost Honor. After nearly

destroying  Mezro  and  the  Tabaxi,  the  giant  (who  was  called

Eshowdow) turned on the Eshowe and nearly annihilated them.

The  remaining  tribes  (except  the  Eshowe  and  the  Thinguth)

were  assimilated  into  the  Tabaxi  tribe,  whose  diverse  peoples

became known collectively as Chultans.

The  arrival  of  the  Chultans,  who  lived  free  of  oppression,

indirectly inspired a revolt among the Lapal tribes that had been

serving the yuan-ti as slaves. After centuries of scattered upris-

ings, the Lapaliiyans  nally escaped in 1732 DR,  eeing north

and east to the lands now claimed by Lapaliiya and Halruaa.

Deprived of their slave race, the yuan-ti were forced to capture

tribes of lizardfolk from the Great Swamp of Rethild and bring

them back to the shores of the Lapal Sea and the Thingulph.

In the Year of Netted Dreams (320 DR), the Hssta  tribe

of yuan-ti was magically called to the ruins of Ssthartissssun

by the ophidians of Najara. The tribes disappearance from its

traditional holdings on the western shores of the Lapal Sea upset

the  long-standing  status  quo  among  the  neighboring  yuan-ti

tribes,  precipitating  two  decades  of  intense  warfare  amongst

the remaining yuan-ti in Mhairshaulk. When civil war threat-

ened  to  destroyed  the  ranks  of  his  remaining  worshipers,  the

long-somnolent Merrshaulk responded by dispatching a winged

avatar  named  Sseth  through  one  of  the  portals  beneath  the

Peaks of Flame in the Year of Erupting Crypts (304 DR).

Under the guidance of Sseth, the yuan-ti forged the empire

of Serpentes on the ruins of Mhairshaulk. Because the Lapal

states had been severely weakened by the Empire Plague (375

DR), the yuan-ti tribes had no trouble conquering all the lands

from  the  Lhairghal  to  the  Peaks  of  Flame  by  the  Year  of

Sunned  Serpents  (189  DR).  Sseths  reign  as  emperor  of  Ser-

pentes abruptly ended in the Year of Dreams (10 DR), when he

vanished beneath the Peaks of Flame. Some say that his disap-

pearance resulted from a failed attempt to unleash Dendar the

Night Serpent and thus end the world; others say he withdrew

deliberately to undergo apotheosis. Whatever the reason for his

departure, the clergy of Sseth began to venerate their vanished

emperor as Merrshaulk reborn. The once-allied tribes of yuan-ti

began to feud over who should succeed their one and only em-

peror while the empire collapsed around them.

In the centuries since the fall of Serpentes, the yuan-ti tribes

have continued to dominate the Mhair and the Black Jungles,

and to a lesser extent the lands now claimed by Samarach and

Thindol. Nominal rule of the peninsula, however, passed to the

nation of Tashtan, then to the Shoon Imperium, and then to

the individual kingdoms of Lapaliiya, Samarach, the Tashalar,

and Thindol. Although the yuan-ti have never agreed upon a

new  emperor  of  Serpentes,  the  tribes  have  begun  to  work  in

concert once again, collectively exerting in uence over many

of the surrounding states.

The Time of Troubles brought new energy to the serpent-

folk  when  the  avatar  of  Sseth  reappeared  brie y  above  the

waters  of  the  Lapal  Sea  just  before  battling  the  dinosaur-

avatar of Ubtao on the eastern edge of the Jungles of Chult.

But after the Avatar Crisis, Set and the traitorous Okothian

sarrukh bound the Great Serpent in a slumber of endless night-

mares. Once again the yuan-ti are actively seeking to subjugate

the human realms of the Chultan Peninsula and the Shining

Sea. At the direction of the Mhairshaulk sarrukh, small bands

of serpentfolk have also begun wandering Faern in search of

clues about the nature of Sseths unending slumber and how it

might be ended.

Plots & Rumors

Serpentes is in a constant state of  ux, with its inhabitants vying

for power and position.

Tribal  Warfare:  Since  the  Time  of  Troubles,  the  SeSehen

tribe has grown signi cantly in power and in uence, primarily

at the expense of the Eselemas and Jennestas tribes. As their

growing armies of broodguards attest, the SeSehen have been

readying themselves for a war of conquest, which they believe

will begin as soon as Sseth returns to reclaim his empire.

The abominations of the other two tribes are all in favor of

taking back Serpentes, but not if doing so means subordinating

themselves  to  the  SeSehen.  Rather  than  initiate  a  civil  war,

which  they  would  ultimately  lose,  agents  of  both  lesser  tribes

have begun spreading rumors about lost treasures throughout

the cities of the South in hopes of drawing human adventurers

into  SeSehen  lands.  Through  such  traitorous  acts,  they  hope

to weaken the SeSehen tribe just enough to raise themselves to

prominence before the emperor reclaims his throne. Of course,

their plan runs the risk of drawing too many Scaleless Ones into

the jungles and thus setting back the plans of all the tribes, but

for now the treachery continues.

Surkh

Capitol: Surkh

Population: 9,770 (lizardfolk 99.9%, lizard kings 0.1%)

Government: Monarchy

Religions: Semuanya, Tiamat

Imports: Gladiators, weapons

Alignment: LE, NE

The City of Lizards lies on the northern shore of the Deep-

wash,  in  the  shadow  of  the  Deepwing  Mountains.  Although

Surkh  maintains  cordial  relations  with  the  Emerald  Enclave,

Lachom (an agricultural community between the Deepwash and

the Vilhon Reach), Lheshayl, and Nimpeth, it remains largely

isolated from its neighbors. Surkhs inhabitants make their liv-

ings by  shing in the Deepwash, and they fear only the ancient

dragon turtle that dwells in the depths.

Life and Society

The lizardfolk of Surkh have attained a degree of civilization

unmatched by their kindred elsewhere in Faern. Despite their

isolationism, however, their practice of eating both humanoids

convicted of serious crimes and the losers of deadly gladiato-

rial  battles  engenders  fear  among  the  Scaleless  Ones  in  the

surrounding city-states.

Surkhites evince a high degree of loyalty for their monarch,

King Grisstok (CN male lizard king barbarian 9). Grisstok re-

mains an enigma to outsiders because he receives nonlizardfolk

visitors only if they speak Draconic, and then only rarely. A coun-

cil of tribal chieftains advises the king, but since he can promote

or demote them as desired, they usually accede to his will.

Although traditional clan and tribal distinctions remain in

force  in  Surkhite  society,  Grisstok  actively  discourages  such

loyalties,  regularly  issuing  edicts  that  force  various  clans  and

tribes to unite or divide to weaken their importance. Surkhites

are expected to settle their individual and collective differences

through ritualized gladiatorial combat at the Arena of Scales.

Gladiators can be hired to serve as proxies for one or both parties

to a dispute, but the battles outcome must be honored whether

or not the principals physically participate.

Most Surkhites dwell in houses fashioned of baked mudbricks

that are built around shaded, communal pools. Labor is con ned

to the early morning and late evening hours so that most Surkh-

ites can retreat to the cooling waters during the hottest portion

of the day. Many of Surkhs inhabitants work as  sherfolk, har-

vesting the bounty of the sea, and most of the remainder are

employed as soldiers or gladiators.

Major Geographical Features

Surkh  claims  some  of  the  most  beautiful  landmarks  in  all

of Faern.

Deepwash:  So  named  for  its  unplumbed  depths,  the  Deep-

wash is the largest freshwater lake between the Shining Sea and

the Sea of Fallen Stars. Its clear, cold water teems with count-

less kinds of  sh in suf cient quantity to feed most of Surkh

without  seriously  depleting  the  supply.  Drained  by  tributaries

 owing from the Cloven, Deepwing, and Snow ake Mountains

and from Impresk Lake, the Deepwash is drained in turn by the

Wintercloak River.

The Deepwash is the home of an immense dragon turtle

(advanced to 36 HD), which is known only as the Dragon of

the Deeps. Surkhite  sherfolk regard death in the creatures

jaws as an honor, though not one that they actively seek. Some

sects within the city respect the Dragon of the Deeps to the

point of worship and make periodic offerings to it, though the

beast has never acknowledged such veneration in any way. The

dragon  turtle  lairs  in  a   ooded,  subterranean  cavern  system

that winds its way deep beneath the Spines of Surkh, opening

into  the  lake  several  hundred  feet  below  the  surface.  Some-

where within this maze lies the terminus of a one-way portal

from the Dragon Eyrie.

The western arm of the Deepwash, known as Shalane Lake,

is much shallower than the rest of the lake and largely free of

the  dragon  turtles  depredations.  Humans  from  the  Shining

Plains and Erlkazar usually con ne their  shing expeditions to

this end of the Deepwash.

Spines  of  Surkh:  The  southwesternmost  peaks  of  the

Deepwing  Mountains,  which  overlook  and  encircle  the  City

of  Lizards,  are  known  as  the  Spines  of  Surkh.  Because  the

Surkhites bury their dead amidst these mountains, the region is

littered with shallow tombs. Semuanyas clerics are somewhat lax

about erecting wards around such crypts, so many of them have

become  home  to  scaled  undead  creatures,  particularly  ghouls.

At  least  three  of  the  crypts  in  this  area  house  the  bodies  of

Okothian sarrukh. Crypt looting is a crime in Surkh, and anyone

caught in such an enterprise is consumed alive.

Important Sites

Only a few points of interest stand out from the generally peace-

ful land of Surkh.

Arena  of  Scales:  This  vast  amphitheater  in  the  heart  of

Surkh  is  rivaled  only  by  those  in  Manshaka  and  Reth.  The

structure is fashioned to resemble a circle of carved stone dino-

saurs with their necks, limbs, and tails intertwined. Gladiatorial

events are held here twice each tenday, drawing large crowds on

a regular basis. Although the majority of the gladiators are liz-

ardfolk, other races (particularly humans) can earn good money

 ghting on the Scaled Field as proxies of the various factions.

Most combats are not to the death; they simply end when one

side or the other yields. However, should any participant or spon-

sor demand a battle to the death, the loser is eaten by the king

or one of his nobles.

Deepwing  Portal:  In  the  Spines  of  Surkh,  high  above  the

City of Lizards, stands a portal in the form of a stone slab with

serpentine symbols inscribed on its eastern side. This portal links

the Vilhon Reach with the mouth of the Great Petri ed Serpent

in the Serpent Hills. Although the lizardfolk of Surkh lay claim

to this region, several yuan-ti in the employ of the Serpent Sibyl

have recently built a small fort around the portal, which they

have defended against repeated assaults.

The portal activates only when the early-morning sunlight

touching the stone is drawn through the portal and deposited

in  the  petri ed  serpents  mouth  in  the  midst  of  the  Serpent

important, since traveling yuan-ti typically arrive at the stone

several hours before it can operate and need a safe place to wait

for dawn.

and number. At present, the cult controls most of the illicit

activities in Surkh, including trade in slaves and black market

goods. Members of the cult must still keep their faith secret,

but the day is coming when they will be able to challenge the

primacy of the church of Semuanya. The Cult of Tiamat is

 ercely opposed to the Cult of the Dragon and recently fought

off an attempt by its Hlondethan cell to establish a base in the

City of Lizards.

Regional History

The  City  of  Lizards  began  as  a  nameless  human   shing  vil-

lage much like Elupar and Ulkan are today. It was settled by

emigrants from Lachom and Nimpeth in the Year of the Deep

Wellspring (167 DR).

In  the  Year  of  the  Cloven  Stones  (1159  DR),  a  dragon

turtle pursued a band of Okothian sarrukh from the Dragon

Eyrie through a portal into a  ooded cavern system beneath the

Spines of Surkh. The sarrukh  ed into the Deepwash and then

onto the nearest shore, which was coincidentally the site of the

aforementioned  shing village. There the dragon turtle  nally

slew them, destroying much of the village in the process and

causing the few human survivors to  ee in terror.

In  the  years  that  followed,  increasing  numbers  of  lizard-

folk  migrated  to  the  site,  drawn  by  reports  that  servitors  of

Semuanya had been seen battling a great wyrm of the depths.

The  rst tribes discovered the bodies of the sarrukh and interred

them  with  honor  in  the  peaks  above  the  village.  Their  tribal

leaders began studying the skins (scrolls) that the sarrukh had

left  behind,  and  in  time  they  began  to  ape  their  creators  in

custom and practice.

In the Year of the Claw (1299 DR), Grisstoks grandfather

 nally  united  the  tribes  and  declared  himself  king.  He  estab-

lished the system of gladiatorial combat that serves even today

in lieu of normal intertribal and interclan feuding. His son es-

tablished the precedent that the most powerful offspring of the

current king must establish his or her right to become the heir

through gladiatorial combat.

Plots and Rumors

Surkh  is  a  relatively  peaceful  place,  but  occasional  events  can

draw interest from outside the realm.

Wyrmlings Exodus: A clutch of black dragons has emerged

in Surkh via the portal from Dragon Eyrie and  ed into the

depths  of  the  Deepwash.  The  wyrmlings  seem  to  be  hunting

somethingpossibly  an  artifact  stolen  by  the  sarrukh  from

Tiamats  hoard.  Although  the  dragons  are  not  yet  a  threat,

King Grisstok has sent word of his need for brave adventurers

to  nearby  cities,  fearing  that  the  wyrmlings  will  threaten  his

realm when they grow up. Surkhs monarch dares not employ

lizardfolk for such a task because they might establish cults to

Tiamat instead of destroying her followers.

Tashalar, The

Capitol: Tashluta

Population: 889,920 (humans 94% [Tashalans 83%, Calishites

12%,  Chultans  3%,  Shaarans  1%],  lizardfolk  4%,  yuan-ti

1%)

Government: Merchant oligarchy

Religions: Amphisbaena the World Serpent (Sseth [now Set]),

Chauntea, Malar, Savras, Talona, Waukeen

Imports: Beef, calantra, fruit, silver, slaves

Exports: Calantra wood carvings, cheese, crossbows, dyed fabric,

glass, olive oil, olives, seafood, ships, spices, wine

Alignment: CN, N, NE

Although many use the term the Tashalar to broadly refer to

the Tashtan Coast, which stretches from Narubel to Sheirtalar,

in truth it refers only to the Tashalar Basin, which is encircled

by the peaks of the Hazur Mountains. The Tashalar is a verdant

coastal area full of bountiful vineyards, gardens, and groves of

olive trees. Tashalaran harvests are shipped north to ports in

Calimshan and along the Lake of Steam, and from there to the

rest of Faern. Tashalaran grapes are so perfect that even the

worst vineyard of the region produces wines worth 100 gp or

more in Waterdeep.

Life and Society

Tashalarans are famed for their skilled craftsmanship, hunting

prowess,  shipbuilding,  exotic  spicy  cuisine,  and  winemaking,

and they have adopted much of the high culture of Calimshan

over the years. Tashlutans (as inhabitants of the capitol city are

known) are warm and welcoming to strangers, and many speak

foreign tongues. Attitudes quickly change in the smaller settle-

ments of the countryside, however.

Most  of  the  Chultans,  lizardfolk,  and  Shaarans  living  in

the  Tashalar  are  slaves  purchased  in  foreign  markets.  But

slaves comprise only a small percentage of the total popula-

tion, despite the willingness of Tashalaran merchants to traf c

in  sentient  lives.  Most  Tashalaran  commoners  labor  in  the

 elds, groves, or vineyards, although some work as sailors, ship-

wrights,  sailmakers  and  provisioners.  The  wealthy  merchant

families  dwell  in  ostentatious  palaces,  dividing  their  time

between their country estates (most of which include a hamlet

just outside the villa walls) and the elite districts of Tashluta.

Hunting is a popular sport among the merchant nobility, and

the bravest hunters seek out the deadly denizens of the Black

Jungles (albeit in the tamer reaches north of the Tashan Gap)

as trophies.

The merchants of the Tashalar defend their country with a

 eet of fast ships, most of which have fallen under the in uence

of a consortium of aggressive traders known as the Rundeen.

This  group,  based  in  Tashluta,  effectively  controls  the  ruling

Tashalaran oligarchy and dominates all trade into and out of

the Tashalar. Despite the loss of their monopoly on shipping on

the Shining Sea, the Rundeen also dominate Calishite shipping

through a recently revived partnership with the Knights of the

Shield, a secretive organization of spies active in Amn, Calim-

shan, and Tethyr.

Major Geographical Features

The Tashalar is a widely varied region that supports a variety

of geographical features.

Cape  Talath:  This  prominent  cape  is  known  for  its  tower-

ing cliffs and the  erce tides that endanger any ship that dares

the surrounding waters. The centuries-old subterranean passage

known as Labrands Folly (see below) gives rise to these surging

waves, and all navigators of the Tashtan Coast give this promon-

tory a wide berth.

Delphin  Mountains:  The  eastern  spur  of  the  northern

Hazur Mountains, east of the Tashan Gap, is known locally as

the Delphin Mountains. Nominally forming the eastern border

of the Tashalar, the peaks of this range are the demesne of a

tribe of short-tempered stone giants. From their enormous rock

mansions  situated  on  remote  peaks,  they  trade  gems  for   ne

wine, and access to ancient serpentfolk ruins and lore for dragon

turtle meat.

Hazur  Mountains:  The  Hazur  Mountains  form  a  natural

border  between  the  Tashalar,  Thindol,  and  the  Black  Jungles.

The scattered gold and iron mines in the northwestern Hazur

Mountains produce suf cient minerals to support the economies

of both the Tashalar and Thindol. The mines on the northern

and eastern slopes are operated by Tashalarans, while those on

the southern and western slopes are owned by small communi-

ties of Thindolese gold dwarves. Clusters of salamanders emerge

periodically from abandoned mineshafts that lead down into the

Burning Rift in the Underdark, beneath the Jungles of Chult.

Soldiers from Thindol patrol the western slopes in the southern

half  of  the  range,  while  the  eastern  slopes  are  stalked  by  the

SeSehen and Jennestas yuan-ti tribes of the Black Jungles. In

the center of the range, deep shafts lead down into the depths,

delivering  blasts  of  fresh  air  to  the  subterranean  waterway

known as Labrands Folly.

Labrands Folly: In the Year of the Whipped Cur (336 DR),

a Halruaan wizard named Labrand came into possession of the

Crown of the Mountain, an ancient artifact now worn by Va-

lamaradace, the Dragon Queen of the Silver Marches. He used

the powers of the crown to carve a subterranean waterway from

the tip of Cape Talath to the head of the Thingulph in Thindol.

Airshafts dot the tunnel at random intervals, opening up in the

heights of the western Hazur Mountains (including the bottom

of one old quarry).

Exactly what Labrand hoped to accomplish by carving the

tunnel  is  unclear,  although  most  suspect  that  he  intended  to

create a lucrative trade route between the Shining Sea and the

Great  Sea  that  would  negate  the  need  for  a  long  sea  voyage

around  the  Horn  of  Chult.  Whatever  Labrand  intended,  his

passage has become home to the water-dwelling yuan-ti of the

Sseradess tribe and the kuo-toa of Gathgoolgapool (a city-state

in the middle Underdark, located midway between the Shining

Sea and the Great Sea and between the Firelands and the Ser-

pent Deeps). If ease of shipping was Labrands goal, he failed,

since the  erce tides that rage through the tunnel as a result of

the airshafts render it all but impassable to ships. Furthermore,

the surging waters that boil from the passage also make naviga-

tion  around  Cape  Talath  and  near  the  head  of  the  Thinguth

extremely treacherous.

Tashalar Basin: The Tashalar Basin lies at the heart of the

Tashtan Coast, encircled by the Hazur Mountains. Dotted with

groves of olive trees and vineyards and blessed with warm and

sunny weather, the Tashalar Basin is a lovely and fertile vale.

Outside  of  Tashluta,  the  basin  supports  a  few  small  farming

villages in the central valley and several large merchant estates,

most of which are located on the  anks of the encircling peaks

and along the northern shore. Most monsters native to the area

have been long since slaughtered or driven south into the Black

Jungles, although agents of the yuan-ti lurk in most communi-

ties. Periodic incursions of scaled and scaleless undead emerging

from  the  many  barrows  that  dot  the  region  are  perhaps  the

greatest threat to security, but ancient weapons are sometimes

recovered from such barrows after their former inhabitants have

been put to rest.

Tashan  Gap,  The:  The  Tashan  Gap,  with  its  low,  jungle-

covered peaks, divides the Delphin Mountains from the rest of

the Hazur chain. This section of the Black Jungles is actually a

montane cloud forest, perpetually cloaked in mist. All travelers

moving between the Tashalar Basin and the Lapal Sea must pass

through the Tashan Gap, since the surrounding mountains are

too rough and steep for passage.

This section of the mountains is home to a small tribe of fog

giants who have long been allied with the SeSehen tribe. The

giants lair in the ruins of an unnamed fortress built millennia

ago during the Couatl-Yuan-ti Wars.

Important Sites

The Tashalar features several sites of interest to adventurers.

Abbey  of  Tharynd:  In  the  mountains  east  of  the  Tashan

Gap,  the  followers  of  Selne  have  established  a  subterranean

abbey in a great natural cavern. At the center of the cavern is

the Moonshaft Pool, which lies directly beneath a great natural

shaft that opens to the sky above. Side caverns lead off into the

Underdark, and dangerous monsters occasionally emerge from

below to attack the Moonmaidens followers. The Pool of Thar-

ynd is said to have many magical powers, and waters taken from

it retain the properties of moondraught (see Magic of Faern)

for at least a day.

Many pilgrims from the city of Sammaresh travel to and

from the abbey, despite the hazards that such trips entail and

the need to cross into the Tashalar from Lapaliiya. Because of

the popularity of this journey, the Moonmaidens followers have

established a series of waystations along the path that threads

through the mountains. Pilgrims are granted free passage along

the trail, but others must pay a small toll. The trail turns south

and leads into the Black Jungles just beyond the abbey, but that

125

part of the trail is wholly unsecured and guarded by yuan-ti of

the SeSehen tribe.

Crypt of Anthilar: Anthilar, the legendary Archmage of

Untisczer,  escaped  the  destruction  of  his  city  by  the  Shoon

Imperium in the Year of Wasteful Pride (285 DR) and  ed to

a secret lair in the mountains west of the Tashan Gap. There

he became a lich, working in secret to control the merchants

of Tashluta.

In  the  Year  of  the  Laughing  Dead  (1056  DR),  Anthilar

suddenly  reappeared  in  the  streets  of  Tashluta  and  unmasked

the leading oligarch as a yuan-ti abomination in disguise. The

resultant spell battle killed the abomination and incapacitated

the lich, although his phylactery was never found. Before the lich

could reawaken, his body was encased in a massively armored

metal lichs cof n and shipped north for study by the senior

priests of the Skullspire in Tulmon. But the cof n never reached

the  Myrkulyte  Conclave  of  Doom.  Instead,  it  passed  through

many  hands  before  coming  to  rest  in  the  hoard  of  Tostyn

Alaerthmaugh, a young adult male mercury dragon lairing in

the depths of Everlake, in the heart of the Evermoors. There it

lies to this day, still unopened.

Today, many adventurers search for the legendary Crypt of

Anthilar, hoping to retrieve the spellskins of Mhairshaulk it re-

portedly contains. Few, if any, have ever returned. Some believe

that Anthilar can manifest as a ghost from afar, and that he

returns periodically to ensure that his lair remains inviolate.

House  of  Nights  Embrace:  This  forti ed  temple-palace

towers over the rest of Tashluta from its position on the west-

ern ridge of the citys caldera. The House of Nights Embrace

is currently the Lady of Poisons preeminent temple in Faern.

Led by Lady Doom Thalaera Indlerith (CE female Tashlutan

human cleric 12 of Talona/Divine Disciple 10 of Talona), the

House is defended by an army of black-masked guards assisted

by gargoyles and golems. In its secretive depths, the Priestesses

of the Ladys Night make poison, potions that spread disease,

and antidotes to both, which they sell at high prices.

Agents of the Nights Embrace tour wealthy houses, noble

country  seats,  and  royal  courts  throughout  Faern,  posing

as purveyors of  ne wines and perfumes. Their true calling,

however, is an open secret. Many of the priestesses employed

in this duty dabble in local politics (and love lives) for their

own entertainment.

House of the All-Seeing Orb: Since Savrass release from

the Scepter of Savras, this ancient edi ce on the eastern ridge

of  Tashlutas  caldera  has  regained  the  preeminence  it  once

held among the temples of the All-Seeing One. This sprawling

complex is administered by the Farseer (LN male Tashlutan

human cleric 8 of Savras/diviner 10/mystic theurge 10), argu-

ably  the  most  powerful  diviner  in  Faern  after  Zalathorm,

the Wizard-King of Halruaa. Home to more than a thousand

scholars, the temple houses the College of Divination, the Ce-

lestial Observatory, and the Library of Ultimate Truth. Many

of the scrying devices used in Faern and quite a few of the

newer arcane divination spells were constructed or researched

at this temple.

Procalith:  The  ruins  of  Procalith,  founded  in  the  Year  of

Distant Thunder (16 DR), lie at the foot of the Delphin Moun-

tains, overlooking the Dolphingulf. In its heyday, Procalith was

ruled by a succession of kings, many of whom were installed by

the Shoon Imperium or the Tashalars ruling oligarchs. It was

destroyed by a sorcery-driven storm during the Rage of Wizards

in the Year of the Swords Oath (1142 DR).

Some  explorers  come  to  the  ruins  in  search  of  the  Seer

of  Procalith  (see  page  28),  a  mysterious  sage-diviner  with  a

nigh-encyclopedic  knowledge  of  Mhairshaulk,  Serpentes,  and

the  history  and  magic  of  the  serpentfolk.  Treasure  seekers

are lured by tales of the Rod of Auglad, a unique Netherese

scepter  thought  to  have  been  hidden  in  the  city  by  Nasana

Melnuthquel, who was Magister from 293 DR to 297 DR, and

also Auglads lover. Whether or not the Rod exists, Procaliths

ruins still contain a fair amount of treasure, as well as a large

number of outlaws who have claimed portions of the ruins for

their own.

Tashluta (Metropolis, 51,522): The City of Slithering Vines

lies in the center of the Tashtan Coast, right in the middle of

the Tashalar Basin. Built on the inner slopes of a  ooded cal-

dera that serves as the citys harbor, Tashluta is a natural port,

a wealthy mercantile city, and the capitol of the Tashalar. The

Stormwall, a thin, curving island, protects the harbor from the

storms of the Shining Sea. Stormwall Keep runs the length of

the islands ridge, protecting the harbor against pirate raids and

naval assaults. The depths of Tashlutas harbor are unplumbed,

and the  ooded lava tubes of the ancient volcano stretch all the

way down into the Serpent Deeps (see above).

Tashlutas  skyline  is  dominated  by  sprawling  edi ces  along

the ridges of the ancient caldera. To the west lies the temple of

Talona known as House of Nights Embrace, and to the east lies

the House of the All-Seeing Orb, a temple to Savras. Along the

southern ridgeline stand the mansions of Tashlutas mercantile

elite, and below these are the smaller homes of Tashlutas middle

and lower classes. In general, proximity to the harbor is regarded

as a mark of low status.

The capitol of the Tashalar is the common port for visitors

to the Chultan Peninsula because only here do the locals learn

many foreign tongues. Tashlutans enjoy playing jokesusually

involving  incredibly  spicy  foodon  foreigners.  Because  the

populace is ever fearful of encroachment by the yuan-ti, snakes

of any sort and most other reptiles are immediately killed.

Regional History

Tashluta and the Tashalar were  rst settled by Lapal  eld hands

from Lapaliiya and Calishite merchants in the Year of Plentiful

Wine (583 DR). The Tashalar quickly grew to rival its easterly

neighbor in wealth, thanks to its lucrative vineyards and olive

groves, although both realms coexisted peacefully.

In the Year of Clutching Dusk (375 DR), rat-laden Cal-

ishite trading ships spread the Empire Plague throughout the

ports  of  the  Shining  Sea,  wiping  out  more  than  half  of  the

Tashalars population. Thus, when Sseth founded the Serpentes

126

5/12/04, 4:22:10 PM

REALMS

Empire  in  the  Year  of  Erupting  Crypts  (304  DR),  human

resistance against the newly resurgent serpentfolk was weak and

disorganized. By the Year of Sunned Serpents (189 DR), the

lizardfolk armies of Serpentes had conquered all of the Tasha-

lar, and most of the wealthy Calishite expatriates had  ed back

to their native land.

After  Sseths  disappearance  in  the  Year  of  Dreams  (10

DR), in ghting among the yuan-ti tribes enabled the enslaved

Tashalarans  to  overthrow  their  yuan-ti  satrap  and  drive  the

SeSehen tribe from the Tashalar over the next ten years. The

resurgent  Tashalarans  then  marched  eastward,  liberating  the

Cities  of  the  Seabreeze  one  by  one.  In  the  Year  of  Purloined

Power (34 DR), the Oligarchs of Tashluta proclaimed the Con-

federation of Tashtan and claimed dominion from the town of

Narubel to the Sheir Peninsula, plus all the Shining Sea coastal

lands in between. The diverse Lapalians, Calishites, Chultans,

and Shaarans dwelling in these areas became known collectively

as Tashalans.

For two centuries, the merchants ships of Tashtan plied the

warm waters of the Lake of Steam and the Shining Sea, making

their owners fat and wealthy. This period of prosperity came to

an end during Ergith Klavulgruns reign as Magister (276 DR

to 278 DR), when the Kingslayer slaughtered nearly a dozen

merchant lords of Tashalaran cities and neighboring realms. The

resulting leadership crisis left Tashtan ill-prepared to handle de-

mands  from  Qysara  Shoon  V  (281  DR  to  300  DR)  that  the

Cities of the Seabreeze each garrison a legion of imperial troops.

A failed uprising in Untisczer in the Year of Wasteful Pride (285

DR) was all the excuse the qysara needed to initiate the long-

planned Tashalar Campaigns.

After  destroying  Untisczer  in  a  show  of  imperial  might,

the  qysaras  troops  quickly  installed  military  governors  in

every city along the Tashtan coast. The reach of the Shoon

Imperium was then extended westward into the savage land of

Thindol, which had long been claimed by the barbaric humans

of the Thinguth tribe and certain warring tribes of lizardfolk

(loosely controlled servitors of the yuan-ti tribes in Serpentes).

The Lizard Wars in Thindol marked the end of the Tashalar

Campaigns and sharply reduced the number of lizardfolk on

the central Chultan  Peninsula.

By the death of Qysara Shoon V in the Year of the Late Sun

(300 DR), Shoon satraps ruled greater Thindol, the Tashalar,

the  cities  of  Lapaliiya,  and  all  the  major  settlements  of  the

Shaar as far east as the Landrise. A steady stream of tribute

 owed west and north to the coffers of Shoonach. Less than a

century later, the crumbling of the Imperium under the careless

reign of Qysara Shaani (367 DR to 427 DR) left the Shoon sa-

traps all but independent. Of all the Shoon Imperiums southern

holdings, only Tashluta remained strictly loyal, largely because

the wife of the reigning satrap was Shaanis youngest daughter.

Despite the increasingly unstable situation, trade still  owed be-

tween the Chultan Peninsula and the heart of the Imperium to

the north, thanks in large part to the alliance of the Tethyr- and

Calimshan-based Knights of the Shield with a local Tashlutan

merchant corporation known as the Rulnadeen.

When the Shoon Imperium fell in the Year of the Corrie Fist

(450 DR), a quick death for the reigning viceroy of Tashluta and

his haughty Shoon wife marked the Tashalans return to inde-

pendence. Backed by the Rulnadeen, the merchants of Tashluta

quickly  formed  a  ruling  oligarchy  to  administer  the  Tashalar

and  keep  the  peace.  Soon  afterward,  angered  by  the  Knights

efforts  to  take  over  the  Rulnadeen  (and  hence  the  Tashalar),

leaders of the Tashlutan-based faction confronted the Knights

and  demanded  that  they  sever  all  ties  with  one  group  or  the

other. Most stayed with the Rulnadeen.

The  Tashlutan  merchant  consortium,  which  had  became

known as the Rundeen, then began extorting protection money

from ships sailing the Shining Sea. All who resisted were coin-

cidentally set upon by pirates from the independent city-state

of Narubel, which was secretly  nanced by the Rundeen. By the

Year of the Crawling Vine (502 DR), the Rundeen had estab-

lished a monopoly on all trade entering or leaving the ports in

Calimshan and the Chultan Peninsula, as well as all slave trade

along the southern shores of the Shining Sea.

Rundeen-backed  rule  by  the  wealthiest  merchants  of  the

Tashalar continued for centuries, although the Rage of Wizards

brie y threatened the status quo in the Year of the Swords Oath

(1142 DR). In the Year of the Bridle (1349 DR), the Harpers

succeeded in killing three Rundeen leaders and  fty lesser agents.

This Treacherous Stab broke the Rundeen monopoly in Chult

and  Calimshan  but  left  the  organizational  heart  in  Tashluta

whole. Today, Rundeen-backed merchant ships still dominate the

traf c across the Shining Sea, but the Rundeens centuries-old

monopoly on such shipping and its control of Calishite ports has

been shattered.

Eager to regain control of Calimshans port cities, as well

as Lapaliiya and the cities of the Lake of Steam, Rundeen has

recently  begun  to  take  a  more  active  and  visible  role  in  the

regions affairs. To that end, the ruling Yrshelem (leaders of the

Rundeen) have reforged their old alliance with the Knights of

the Shield. In a deal of unprecedented treachery, the Rundeen

has also forged a trade pact with the yuan-ti of the SeSehen

tribe and admitted several yuan-ti into its rank-and- le.

Plots and Rumors

The unstable trade situation in the Tashalar may give rise to a

number of adventuring opportunities.

Troubled  Scryings:  The  clergy  of  the  House  of  the  All-

Seeing  Orb  have  a  long-standing  rivalry  with  the  House  of

Nights  Embrace  and  often  work  to  expose  the  evil  schemes

of  Talonas  priestesses.  In  recent  years,  however,  the  temples

diviners  have  found  hints  of  a  greater  danger  brewing  in  the

neighboring  jungles,  so  they  have  been  hiring  adventurers  to

investigate. The truth of the matter is that the yuan-ti tribes of

Serpentes, led by the SeSehen tribe, have recently begun emerg-

ing from centuries of somnolence. Spurred by the sighting of

Sseth during the Time of Troubles and the subsequent thrashing

of the bound and slumbering god, the serpentfolk now seek to

reestablish their ancient domain. To that end, they have been

The Realm of Running Waters encompasses the entire Thindol

Basin. Its lands are encircled by the Hazur Mountains to the

east  and  north,  the  Tching  Mountains  to  the  northwest,  and

the Sanrach Mountains to the west. At the heart of Thindol

lies the Thingulph, a large sheltered gulf that is fed by six major

rivers and opens onto the Great Sea. The  atlands of Thindol

are covered by tall grass and scattered orchards, and the Hazur

Mountains contain productive veins of gold and iron suf cient

to meet the local need.

Life and Society

The  realm  of  Thindol  is  rent  by  divisions  along  geographic,

racial,  ethnic,  class,  and  political  lines.  The  northern  city  of

Narubel is all but independent, and the northwestern third of

the  country  is  part  of  Thindol  in  name  only.  Lizardfolk  are

barely tolerated here, and kuo-toa and serpentfolk are killed on

sight. The gold dwarves of the Hazur Mountains are considered

autonomous, so they are given no say in the governance of the

realm  as  a  whole.  The  human  population  is  divided  into  two

ethnic groups: the Tashalans and the Chultans. The Guthland, as

the eastern shore of the Thingulph is known, is poor and back-

ward. Dominated by Chultans, it remains semi-autonomous. The

western half of the kingdom is wealthy and dominated by ethnic

Tashalans. Each major city gets one vote in the ruling council.

Since Tashalans have slim majorities in most of the cities, they

effectively rule the realm despite their minority status in the

population as a whole.

Mounts are almost unknown in Thindol, so transportation

is usually by boat or on foot. Endless battles rage in the Hazur

Mountains  between  the  gold  dwarves  and  the  kuo-toa,  and

the  yuan-ti  continually  test  Thindols  defenses  from  within

and  without.  Ophiophobia  is  rampant  among  the  human

inhabitants,  and  eternal  vigilance  against  the  serpentfolk  is

the cultural norm. Most Chultans appease a handful of dark

powers (such as Talona and Umberlee) and nominally venerate

Ubtao. The Tashalans hold the same beliefs as their cousins

in  the  Tashalar,  but  they  tend  to  favor  appeasing  the  dark

Major Geographical Features

Thindols diverse geographical features provide a rich environ-

ment for its equally diverse peoples.

Dolsel Gap, The: The jungle-covered peaks of the Dosel

Gap divide the higher Guth Mountains from the rest of the

Hazur  chain.  Like  the  Tashan  Gap  to  the  north,  this  sec-

tion of the Black Jungles is actually a montane cloud forest,

perpetually  cloaked  in  mist.  All  travelers  moving  between

the Thindol Basin and the Lapal Sea must pass through the

Dolsel Gap, since the surrounding mountains are too rough

and  steep  for  passage.  Thindolese  warriors  patrol  the  west-

ern  end  of  the  gap  with  unceasing  vigilance,  turning  away

anyone who tries to enter their kingdom by this route, and

the  yuan-ti  of  the  Jennestas  tribe  keep  a  similarly  careful

watch on their end.

In addition to roving troops of gambolsMM2, the Dolsel Gap is

home to a thirst of crimson deathsMM2. These voracious undead

are  the  tortured  spirits  of  Lapal  slaves  who  were  slaughtered

many centuries ago in a vile ceremony by the yuan-ti. They now

hunt serpentfolk, humans, and other sentient races indiscrimi-

nately, although they always attack yuan-ti  rst should a choice

present itself. The defenders of Thindol are well aware of the

danger these monsters pose, yet they have left them unmolested

as another defense against yuan-ti incursions.

Guth  Mountains:  The  Dolsel  Gap  separates  the  south-

ernmost spur of the Hazur Mountains from the rest of the

chain. These low, heavily forested peaks are home to colonies

of blood apesMM2 and clusters of girallons. Legends speak of

a  City  of  Apes  somewhere  amidst  these  mountains,  but  no

evidence  of  such  a  place  has  ever  come  to  light.  (In  truth,

the  only  City  of  Apes  is  Ssyintiasaminass  in  the  Black

Jungles.)

Guthland,  The:  The  eastern  shores  of  the  Thingulph  are

known as the Guthland. This term dates back to an era (1732

DR to 189 DR) when the lizardfolk population of the west-

ern Thindol Basin swelled so much that the Thinguth human

tribe was forced to withdraw to its easternmost holdings. The

Thinguth tribe has now spread across all of Thindol and Sama-

rach, thanks in part to the dictates of the yuan-ti during the

heydey of Serpentes, but the Guthland remains their ancestral

homeland. In this region, Chultans make up 92% of the total

human population.

The  Guthland  is  dotted  with  scattered  hamlets,  each  sur-

rounded by bountiful orchards of mango, papaya, and pineapple

trees. Delselar is the only city of any size, and its inhabitants

are much poorer than people living elsewhere in Thindol. The

eastern  frontier  of  the  Guthland  is  heavily  forti ed,  and  its

watchtowers line the foothills of the Hazur and Guth Moun-

tains as well as the western edge of the Dolsel Gap.

River Dolsel: The River Dolsel is the heart of commerce

in the Guthland. Originating in the heart of the Dolsel Gap,

128

it  eventually  drains  into  the  Thingulph.  Slow-moving  scows

transport produce along this wide, peaceful river to the mar-

kets in Delselar. From time to time, swimming snakes (both

living and undead) emerge from the Black Jungles to prey on

the unwary. Local lore correctly attributes their attacks to the

yuan-ti.

River  Guth:  The  River  Guth  marks  the  northern  edge  of

the  Guthland.  Arising  in  the  heart  of  the  Hazur  Mountains

and  rushing  down  to  the  Thingulph,  the  River  Guth  is  only

navigable a few miles above its terminus. No bridges cross this

waterway, and the only ford lies at the point beyond which most

boats cannot pass.

The  gold  dwarves  of  the  Hazur  Mountains  have  carved  a

steep-pitched cart road along the northern banks of the river,

and  their  mule-pulled  carts  are  a  common  sight  along  its

length. Dwarven watchposts, carved into cliff faces above the

road, guard the entire length of the river. Since the Stout Folk

cannot spare enough of their number to keep all the watchposts

fully manned, many humans (usually lower-class Chultans from

the Guthland)  nd gainful employment in dwarf-led teams of

trail guards.

River Gur: The River Gur bubbles forth from the depths of

the eastern Sanrach Mountains, curves near the base of Sormarl

Pass, and  nally drains into the Thingulph. Before the division

of Samarach from Thindol, boat traf c on the River Gur was

heavy. Goods of all sorts were ferried upriver to Sormarl Pass,

where they were of oaded onto wagons and shipped westward.

Today, this river is much quieter, and the small settlements that

once lined its northern shore have fallen into disrepair.

River Lundeth: Also known as the Cascades, this very short

and wild river arises in the western Hazur Mountains and plum-

mets  down  to  the  Thingulph  in  a  series  of  small  waterfalls.

Although  the  inhabitants  of  Lundeth  have  tamed  the  river

mouth with a series of watermills, most of the watercourse is

the preserve of a pool of fossergrimsMM2 and a tumble of galeb

duhr. Hierophant Dezelyna Goldeagle (N female Chultan human

druid 12/hierophant 5) reportedly makes her home somewhere

near the highest cascades to ensure their continuing sanctity.

River Salban: The River Salban originates in a subterranean

spring  at  the  heart  of  the  eastern  Sanrach  Mountains,  winds

through the depths of the range, and then emerges from a cliff

face  high  above  the  grasslands  of  western  Thindol  to  form  a

towering waterfall known as Salban Falls. The lower reaches of

the River Salban are broad and slow, and this section is usually

 lled with heavily laden scows taking produce from local farms

down to the markets in Thindar.

According to legend, a side passage leading away from the

main watercourse gives access to the mines of Selgol, and from

there to the Firelands beneath the Jungles of Chult. Many have

sought this secret path, but none have returned to tell the tale.

River  Tching:  The  River  Tching  and  the  River  Lundeth

are the only two wild rivers remaining in the Thindol Basin.

These  two  waterways  lack  the  merchant  traf c  and  bankside

settlements of the other Thindolese rivers.

Formed from a con uence of creeks arising in the Tching

Mountains, the River Tching drains into the Thingulph between

Lundeth and Thindar. The  owing river gives way to stagnant

marshes at several points along its length, and its mouth forms

a delta several miles across.

The remaining lizardfolk tribes of Thindol lurk along this

rivers length. Their human neighbors tolerate them as long as

they limit their activities to the rivers immediate environs, but

relations are not cordial. These lizardfolk are in regular, secret

contact with the Sseradess tribe of yuan-ti, and they regularly

ferry messages and goods between the Thingulph and Narubel

on behalf of their serpentine masters.

Tching  Mountains:  This  isolated  range  in  northwestern

Thindol rises up between the Hazur and Sanrach Mountains

and overlooks the Tashtan Coast. The Tching mountains are

largely devoid of wildlife, thanks to the presence of a chaos

rocMM2 that lairs atop a windswept peak. This colossal avian

preys on nearly anything that moves in the surrounding region

and  has  been  known  to  attack  ships  that  venture  too  close

to shore.

Thingulph, The: At the heart of Thindol lies the Thingulph,

a  Y-shaped  bay.  Its  shallow,  shimmering  waters  conceal  an

abundance  of  sea  life.  In  addition,  numerous  yuan-ti  from

the  Sseradess  tribe  make  their  homes  in  the  depths  of  West

Thingulph, about 10 miles south of Thindar. There they have

constructed Khassinsara, a coral fortress that is all but unrecog-

nizable as such, even to those who know its there. Other yuan-ti

dwell in the tunnel known as Labrands Folly (see above). With

increasing frequency, kuo-toa raiders from Gathgoolgapool (see

Labrands Folly) have begun attacking small settlements along

the Thingulphs shores as well as lightly manned watercraft on

its waters.

Important Sites

Thindol is home to numerous human and gold dwarf settlements,

as well as a variety of sites important to the serpentfolk.

Aztul  (Large  Town,  4,631):  This  unremarkable   shing

town lies at the base of the Guth Mountains. Wealthy Thin-

dolese have been coming here in recent years to mount hunting

expeditions  for  blood  apesMM2,  since  their  pelts  have  become

status symbols among the Thindolese elite. More than a few

treasure seekers visit Aztul as well, drawn by stories of a City

of Apes in the depths of the mountain range. Though such

stories persist, no evidence has been found that such a city ever

existed here.

Delselar  (Metropolis,  76,412):  Also  known  as  Dolselar  in

the local vernacular, the City of Succulent Jewels is named for

the  large  volume  of  delectable  fruits  that  passes  through  its

markets. Delselar is a 3-mile-long, unwalled town that stands on

the southern embankment above the River Dosel. Because most

of its buildings lie within a stones throw of the waters edge,

countless punts are available for hire to transport residents and

visitors from place to place in town.

129

REALMS

In  recent  years,  agents  of  the  Jennestas  tribe  have  man-

aged to introduce a wide variety of predatory snakes into the

grasslands south of the city while placing a number of variant

sympathy-like effects within the city to attract them. Increasing

numbers of Delselars inhabitants have fallen victim to attacks

by snakes and wereserpents, but all efforts to avert the incur-

sions  have  failed,  primarily  because  of  the  citys  narrowness

and length.

Deltar (Large Town, 2,863): Home to clammers,  sherfolk,

and deep sea divers, Deltar is notorious for the large number

of submerged islets that lie just offshore. Resident rogues row

out  with  lanterns  during  storms,  deliberately  trying  to  make

ships heading for the Thingulph founder. Because of this prac-

tice, numerous wrecks dot the local depths. Many still contain

lost treasures, since the large number of aquatic monsters that

choose to lair in them deters plunderers.

Gurdeth  (Large  City,  17,991):  The  City  on  Stilts  is  built

atop a large island at the mouth of the River Gur. Most of its

buildings stand on poles above the ground and are lashed to their

neighbors  for  support  against  periodic   oods.  Because  of  this

unusual arrangement, most of the citys roads lie underneath the

structures and thus are always dark and shadowy, even during

the day.

Like their counterparts in Thindar across the bay, the ruling

merchants of Gurdeth are quite wealthy, though much of their

wealth  was  acquired  by  disreputable  means.  Those  who  walk

the citys underroads are advised to go armed, and those who

dare  Gurdeths  Byzantine  politics  had  best  expect  a  dagger  in

the back.

Lundeth (Large City, 23,791): The City of Whirring Waters

lies at the foot of the Cascades, where the River Lundeth has

been  harnessed  to  operate  a  series  of  small  watermills.  These

devices power all manner of technological contraptions, includ-

ing  a  set  of  presses  that  can  each  create  up  to  one  hundred

swords per day. Despite the involvement of gold dwarf overseers,

weapons produced in this fashion are still quite shoddy. Such a

weapon commands less than 10% of its normal price, and its

break DC is one-half that for a normal specimen. Nevertheless,

efforts to re ne the process continue. A small number of Lan-

tanna expatriates have recently settled in this city, bringing with

them missionary priests of Gond.

Narubel (Small City, 11,301): Nominally the northernmost

city of Thindol, the City of Seasnakes lies at the western end of

the Tashtan Coast, near the eastern edge of the Jungles of Chult.

The city is built into the sea caves that honeycomb the walls of a

small natural harbor surrounded by steep cliffs. Narubel claims

the territory that stretches from the eastern edge of the Jungles

of Chult to the Tching Mountains and from the northern slopes

of the Sanrach Mountains to the Shining Sea, although most of

that land is unsettled wilderness.

Founded  by  Tashlutan  merchants  seeking  to  plunder  the

Jungles  of  Chult  in  the  Year  of  the  Carved  Cliffs  (29  DR),

the City of Seasnakes is now an independent city-state ruled

by yuan-ti purebloods of the Sauringar tribe. When the city

was in the hands of humans, overland trade  owed north from

Thindar to the docks of Narubel, bypassing the dangerous seas

around the Jungles of Chult. But the Sauringars, who had been

driven out of the Sanrach Basin in the Year of Hounds (293

DR), came to power in Narubel by allying themselves with the

spirit nagas of the Chultengar. The nagas deliberately isolated

the city from the rest of Thindol by arranging targeted attacks

on overland caravans by the pterafolk tribes in their charge.

These constant attacks ended all caravan traf c more than a

century ago.

Since  then,  the  City  of  Seasnakes  has  become  the  home

port for most of the pirate ships that stalk the Shining Sea.

All efforts to muster a  otilla against the pirates from the

navies of the Tashalar, Lapaliiya, and Calimshan have come

to  naught,  thanks  in  large  part  to  the  whispered  words  of

yuan-ti agents in the courts of those realms and the in uence

of the Rundeen. In payment for the long-ago service rendered

by  the  pterafolk  and  their  spirit  naga  leaders,  a  fraction  of

every cargo seized by the pirates of Narubel is sent into the

Chultengar as tribute.

Psamma  (Small  Town,  1,936):  This  river  town  lies  along

the southern banks of the River Gur, almost at the midpoint of

the triangle formed by the ports of Deltar and Gurdeth and the

fortress-town of Samagard.

Aside from its role as the local trading center, Psamma is

notable for what lies beneath the streets. Two decades ago, ef-

forts to sink a new well revealed a series of natural caverns that

the yuan-ti had used as tombs in ages past. The  rst explorers

brought  back  a  handful  of  serpentine  artifacts,  but  the  town

council  quickly  banned  any  further  exploration.  Despite  the

continuous presence of armed guards blocking entrance to the

well shaft, however, a small number of such bibelots continue to

surface for sale, suggesting that one or more other connections

have been dug in secret.

Samagard (Large Town, 4,106): Built across the River Gur

from a small keep that defends the eastern end of Sormarl Pass,

Samagard is the only Thindolese settlement in which Samara-

chan merchants can exchange their wares for coin or bartered

goods.  Once  a  great  deal  of  trade   owed  through  the  pass  to

what was then western Thindol, but today that commerce is a

mere fraction of what it once was. Nevertheless, the merchants

of Samagard earn a tidy sum supplying their neighbors to the

west with trade goods at exorbitant prices.

Unbeknownst  to  either  country,  the  yuan-ti  have  success-

fully inserted several agents high in the ranks of the local trade

consortiums.  Their  primary  mission  is  to  learn  about  both

countries weaknesses by observing what each needs to acquire

in trade, but they also work to exacerbate tensions between the

two realms in order to prevent them from uniting against their

common foe.

Tchinggult  (Large  Town,  3,413):  Once  a  waystop  along

the  road  from  Thindar  to  Narubel  along  the  banks  of  the

River Tching, Tchinggult fell into disrepair when trade along

the route declined and a chaos rocMM2 began to hunt the area.

Today,  only  human  outlaws  and  small  bands  of  lizardfolk

inhabit  this  ruined  town.  At  least  three  major  gangs  and  a

130

host  of  minor  ones  vie  for  control  of  the  streets,  and  war-

fare between them is a nightly occurrence. During the day, a

handful of open-air markets operate after a fashion, offering

any and all items that are outlawed in the rest of Thindol for

sale. Those who dare visit such bazaars, however, must be well

prepared to defend themselves.

Thindar (Metropolis, 98,662): This sprawling, unwalled

city was built on the site of a filled-in marsh. The surround-

ing grasslands and neighboring waters meld together beneath

the shimmering sun, resembling one giant, enveloping sea.

This phenomenon, combined with its low-lying construction,

earned  Thindar  its  nicknameCity  in  the  Waves.  Domi-

nated by wealthy Thindolese of Tashlutan heritage, Thindar

is the main trading center of the Thindol Basin and often

the last port of call for ships sailing westward around the

Horn of Chult.

Each major storm eats away a little more of the citys port

district, and most new construction is on the north side. Thus,

most of Old Thindar now lies beneath the waves. Although

adventurers attempt to plunder the submerged ruins from time

to time, most do not return. The majority of such disappear-

ances are attributable to the yuan-ti, who scour the ruins for

any advantage they can  nd in their covert battle to reclaim

the Thindol Basin.

Regional History

Once  considered  part  of  Mhairshaulk,  the  central  jungles  of

the areas now claimed by Samarach and Thindol were largely

abandoned  by  the  yuan-ti  about  24,000  DR,  during  their

centuries-long  war  with  the  couatls  (see  Serpentes,  above).

For  millennia  thereafter,  the  jungles  of  the  central  penin-

sula  remained  the  preserve  of  savage  wildlife  and  individual

serpentfolk  (either  yuan-ti  or  couatls)  who  forged  their  own

short-lived domains.

At  the  end  of  the  great  couatl-led  migration  of  human

tribes from the continent far to the southwest in 2809 DR,

the  central  jungles  of  the  Sanrach  and  Thindol  Basins  were

settled by the Thinguth tribe (see Serpentes, above). Centuries

later,  the  Lapal  tribes  living  alongside  the  Lapal  Sea   nally

escaped their yuan-ti masters, and the serpentfolk were forced

to import tribes of lizardfolk slaves from the Great Swamp of

Rethgild to the east. Upon reaching the shores of the Lapal Sea,

many of these lizardfolk either escaped or were released into the

territory claimed by the Thinguth. This event led to centuries

of skirmishing between humans and lizardfolk that eventually

reduced both groups to barbaric tribal enclaves.

Over  time,  the  Thinguth  were  forced  to  withdraw  from

their  western  territories,  conceding  much  of  what  is  now

Samarach  and  western  Thindol  to  the  lizardfolk,  who  later

expanded into the Jungles of Chult as well. This division of

territory geographically isolated the inhabitants of the Guth-

land from the rest of the migrant tribes that had settled in

the  Jungles  of  Chult.  Thus,  when  the  great  war  broke  out

between  the  Tabaxi  and  Eshowe  tribes  (438  DR  to  122

DR),  the  isolated  Thinguth  of  the  Guthland  were  the  only

Chultans not wholly absorbed into the Tabaxi and ruled from

the capitol city of Mezro.

In the Year of Shattered Havens (289 DR), the Thinguth

were  enslaved  by  the  yuan-ti  of  the  Sseradess  and  Sauringar

tribes and dispersed across all of greater Thindol, which at that

time included lands now claimed by Samarach. Their liberation

came  in  the  Year  of  Hounds  (293  DR),  when  soldiers  of  the

Shoon  Empire  defeated  the  lizardfolk  tribes  that  had  battled

the  Thinguth  during  the  Lizard  Wars  at  the  tail  end  of  the

Tashalar Campaigns. The Sseradess tribe remained untouched in

the depths of the Thingulph, and the Sauringar retained their

holdings in the depths of the Samarlogh. Without their armies

of lizardfolk, however, neither yuan-ti tribe dared continue to

rule openly.

In the decades that followed, a succession of Shoon satraps

brought civilization to the Thinguth, and many natives found

employment  denuding  the  Thindol  Basins  of  its  prized  ma-

hogany and teak trees and shipping them back to the heart of

the  Imperium.  During  this  period,  many  Tashalans  migrated

southward from the Tashtan Coast to settle the unclaimed ter-

ritories west of the Thingulph. They took control of the lumber

trade, while the Chultans retained their primacy in the eastern

region known as the Guthland.

After  the  Shoon  Imperium  collapsed  in  the  Year  of  the

Corrie Fist (450 DR), the Thindolese achieved independence

for the  rst time in centuries, albeit under the subtle in uence

of the yuan-ti agents who had in ltrated the ruling corridors

of power. By chance, in the Year of Many Serpents (605 DR),

a minor scandal in Thindols royal court led to the unmask-

ing of hundreds of yuan-ti in ltrators, including none other

than the reigning monarch and his family. All of Thindol de-

scended into near anarchy, and for months after the incident,

anyone even suspected of possessing serpentine blood was sum-

marily  executed  by  roving  bands  of  ophiophobes.  This  civil

war ended the monarchy and slaughtered thousands of inno-

cents, but it also greatly reduced the in uence of the yuan-ti.

By the time it was over, Western Thindol had declared itself

the  independent  realm  of  Samarach,  and  all  the  mountain

passes and roads in that new realm had been cloaked in a veil

of illusion.

In the centuries since the War of Unmasking (605 DR to

606 DR), a Council of Cities has ruled Thindol and vigilantly

guarded its borders against serpentine interlopers, never suspect-

ing that the Sseradess tribe lurks beneath the waters in the heart

of the realm. Ophiophobia still results in periodic purges of sus-

pected serpentfolk, although most are now expelled rather than

executed. Thindolese merchants make a good living trading with

Halruaa, Dambrath, the Tashalar, and (to a much lesser extent)

Samarach. However, the century-old decline in cross-peninsula

trade from Thindar to Narubel has reduced the  ow of coins

into the realms coffers, and Samarach is a part of the realm

only in name.

Plots and Rumors

Ophiophobia  is  still  rampant  in  Thindol,  and  many  rumors

circulate about the possible presence of serpentfolk.

Poisoned  Waters:  In  the  city  of  Gurdeth,  the  Sseradess

tribe has been poisoning the citys wells with a diluted version

of the potion needed to create tainted ones (initial Fortitude

DC 5). This tactic has created a handful of tainted ones and

numerous broodguards, most of which have been slain by the

local constabulary after brie y running amok. Although some

of the tainted ones have already been exposed and executed, a

few have escaped detection and are now serving as agents of

the yuan-ti.

Other Holdings

The  regions  listed  above  include  only  the  most  important

and  powerful  holdings  of  the  serpentfolk.  Other  areas  where

the reptilian races exert their in uence in different ways are

detailed below.

Chultengar, The

The Chultengar is the easternmost of the Jungles of Chult. This

narrow  band  of  tropical  rain  forest  lies  between  the  Sanrach

Mountains and the Luo Peaks (a continuation of the Peaks of

Flame stretching eastward toward the town of Narubel).

In  addition  to  scattered  tribes  of  batiri  (goblins),  roosts

of wyverns, and a few bands of wild dwarves, the Chultengar

is  home  to  one  of  the  largest  settlements  of  pterafolk  in  the

Jungles of Chult. Those that dwell on the mountain slopes over-

looking the Chultengar prefer to hunt in the jungle and on the

northern plains of Thindol to the east.

Each pterafolk tribe answers to a spirit naga chieftain. These

spirit nagas and others gather annually in a great Conclave of

Spirits held in the depths of the Chultengar and led by a trio of

ha-nagas. Only the juvenile male bronze dragon named Felgolos

and  the  late  Thongameir  Stormspells  Halargoth  have  ever

seen the Conclave of Spirits and survived.

The spirit nagas (and thus, indirectly, the pterafolk) are allied

with the Sauringar tribe of Narubel. Small bands of yuan-ti reg-

ularly travel between the City of Seasnakes and the Chultengar

bearing goods seized by the pirate ships that frequent Narubels

harbor. This tribute is offered as payment to the spirit nagas for

their aid in keeping Narubel isolated from the rest of Thindol

for the past century.

Ilimar

Like  the  legendary  Shandaular,  the  ruined  city  of  Ilimar  is

divided between the two ends of a portal. The portals northern

terminus lies in the western reaches of the Gulthmere Forest,

near the southern shore of the Lake of the Long Arm. This set

of ruins is the domain of giant spiders and serpent-bodied lamia

nobles descended from the infamous Nessmara, who recovered

the Maguscepter and reigned as Westgates queen from 615 DR

to 616 DR. The portals southern terminus lies on the eastern

slopes of Muaroghal (the East Wall of Halruaa), north of the

Great Swamp of Rethild. This portion of the ruined city is ruled

by a circle of spirit nagas who are worshiped as gods by the liz-

ardfolk tribes of the Great Swamp.

Millennia ago, Ilimar was founded by a minor clan of sar-

rukh  whose  members  served  as  slave  procurers  for  the  great

empires of Isstossef  l and Mhairshaulk. Three Ilimari sarrukh

who have been in hibernation since before the drow conquest of

Dambrath still lie buried amidst the southern ruins. Just as the

lizardfolk venerate the nagas as divine beings, the spirit nagas

revere the long-buried sarrukh as gods and patiently await their

next awakening.

Kethid

The Great Swamp of Rethild pools around the eastern end of

Halruaas Wall, marking the western border of Dambrath. Its

borders mark the boundaries of Kethid, a lizardfolk kingdom

ruled  by  King  Ghassis  (CE  male  lizard  king  sorcerer  15),  a

shrewd, well-traveled leader. Ghassis is unique among the lizard-

folk because he has secretly acquired and mastered at least three

Halruaan skyships, which some claim he has employed to sail

amongst the stars.

Under  the  leadership  of  his   eld  commander  Sladdis  (CE

male  lizardfolk   ghter  12),  Ghassis  dispatches  companies  of

lizardfolk  mercenaries,  known  collectively  as  the  Servants  of

the  Royal  Egg,  to   ght  in  distant  wars.  Most  recently,  the

Servants have been active in Tethyrs War of Reclamation and

the  Jungles  of  Chult.  Members  of  this  company  exhibit  little

initiative but lots of single-minded determination and an intense

sense of group identity, so strong leadership is vital in achieving

the desired results. Ghassis is rather indifferent about the fate

of his Servants, but he is willing to use their talents to his own

bene t as long as it is convenient to do so.

Lhesper

The  ruins  of  Lhesper  lie  along  the  northern  tip  of  Lake

Lhespen in the heart of the Shaar. The town was founded in

the Year of the Whispering Stones (373 DR) by Lapal migrs

 eeing the Empire Plague that had beset Lapaliiya two years

before.  Lhesper  remained  independent  until  the  Year  of  the

Wailing Mothers (297 DR), when the imperial armies of Qysara

Shoon V marched across the Shaar, conquering all the territory

between the Shining Sea and the Landrise.

Although Lhesper regained its independence in 437 DR and

again in 451 DR, its freedom did not last long. In the Year of

the Fanged Beast (640 DR), Yeenoghus cult rose to rapid promi-

nence among the gnoll tribes of the Shaar. Lhesper, one of the

 rst towns to bear the cults wrath, was left in ruins. The few

survivors, still ethnically pure Lapal, migrated north to found

the town of Shaarmid.

For  centuries,  the  ruins  of  Lhesper  served  as  hunting

grounds for gnoll warriors, but now they are once again inhab-

ited. The latest occupants are members of the Coiled Cabal who

are searching for the legendary Emeralds of Merrshaulk, a set

of  massive  gemstones  inscribed  with  the  ancient  divine  spells

of Mhairshaulk. The stones were stolen when the Lapal tribes

 rst  ed the Lapal Sea to found what would one day become

Lapaliiya. In the waning days of the Empire Plague, they were

taken to Lhesper for safekeeping, only to be lost when that town

was overrun by gnolls.

Whether or not the Coiled Cabal succeeds in locating the

Emeralds  of  Merrshaulk,  the  strategic  location  of  this  base

makes  the  expense  of  maintaining  it  more  than  worth  the

while.  Therefore,  the  yuan-ti  have  exerted  their  power  over

the human bandit tribes of the region, forcing them to bring

any  human  travelers  they  capture  back  to  ruined  Lhesper

for sacri ce to Sseth or transformation into broodguards or

tainted ones.

Nagalands, The

The Nagalands encompass the upper reaches of the Naga ow,

the  southern  half  of  the  Nagawater,  the  plains  of  Serpents

Holding,  and  the  Naga  Plains.  Although  the  Nagalands  lack

any sort of formal government, this region is uncontestably the

collective  domain  of  the  nagas,  and  no  other  realm  controls

this region.

The  Naga ow  is  a  long,  lazy  river  that  originates  in  the

heart  of  the  Chondalwood,  broadens  into  a  deep,  freshwater

lake  known  as  the  Nagawater  upon  joining  with  the  Win-

tercloak  River,  then  drains  into  the  Vilhon  Reach  in  the

shadow of Nimpeth. The southern half of the Nagawater is

the domain of numerous water nagas and increasing numbers

of banelar nagas. The upper reaches of the Naga ow are the

spawning  grounds  for  all  the  naga  subraces.  In  addition,  a

Yuan-ti anathema named Phelriss secretly uses the area as a

lair. Phelriss is attended by a cult of dark and spirit naga fol-

lowers who venerate it as a god.

Between the Naga ow and the River Arran lie the Golden

Plains,  named  for  their  tall,  golden  grasses.  These  plains  are

home to centaurs, the Talu-min tribe of Lion warriors (Cal-

ishite  humans),  and  gnolls.  The  western  edge  of  the  Golden

Plains, along the eastern shore of the Nagawater, is known as

the  Naga  Plains.  This  region  is  inhabited  by  guardian  nagas

who dwell in hollow trees and other hidey-holes, and by spirit

nagas who dwell in subterranean caves exposed by the waters of

the Naga ow.

The band of plains between the Nagawater and the Winter-

wood has been named Serpents Holding by the Brada-min tribe

of Lion warriors (Calishite humans) and the inhabitants of the

forti ed village of Nagarr. Countless varieties of snakes, includ-

ing a spitting snake known as the mlarraun, lair in this hilly,

rolling terrain.

Two disconcerting rumors have emerged from the Nagalands

in recent years. One holds that agents of Teldorn Darkhope of

Mintar have rediscovered a means of transforming water nagas

into  banelar  nagas,  and  that  the  increasing  numbers  of  the

latter subrace in the Nagawater are the results of such magi-

cal transformations. The other rumor holds that a dark naga

named  Calliope,  consort  of  Pristoleph  the  Purple  (LE  male

Chondathan human wizard 12), has hatched a clutch of dark

nagas with arms in the depths of the Chondalwood. Her progeny

are said to be growing to maturity even now in the catacombs of

Pristal Towers in Innarlith. (In fact, the arms of these nagara

are Yuan-ti grafts placed on them by Phelriss.)

Peaks of Flame

Three  volcanic  peaks  rise  from  the  depths  of  the  Jungles  of

Chult,  spewing  smoke  and  ash  into  the  skies.  The  Peaks  of

Flame, as these volcanoes are known, are linked via a network

of lava tubes to a region of the Underdark known as the Fire-

lands that lies just below the Jungles of Chult. In the heart of

the Firelands is the Burning Rift, site of many portals to the

Elemental Plane of Fire.

Azers, hell hounds,  amesnakes, magmins, salamanders, and

other  ery creatures have all migrated to the Firelands via such

portals  and  then  made  their  way  to  the  lava-strewn  slopes  of

the Peaks of Flame. Red dragons and pyrohydras are naturally

drawn to the range and are commonly encountered here as well.

But by far the most numerous inhabitants of both the Peaks of

Flame and the Firelands are tribes of  renewts and their giant

strider mounts.

Morndin  Vertesplendarrorn,  the  Emerald  Crater,  is  the

shattered remnant of a fourth peak, which lies just north and

west of the three active volcanoes. The wild dwarf tribes of the

region make regular pilgrimages to this truncated cone, which

is sacred to Thard Harr. Since its creation in the Year of the

Quivering  Mountains  (77  DR),  the  Emerald  Crater  has  been

home to Esmerandanna, an emerald great wyrm known as the

Resplendent Queen and guardian of the most sacred carvings of

the dur Authalar.

Legend has it that the Peaks of Flame stand over a pair of

doors leading to the Fugue Plain. When the doom of the world

approaches,  Dendar  the  Night  Serpent  (an  elder  eternal  evil

that  feeds  on  the  unremembered  nightmares  of  all  creatures)

will  break  down  these  doors  and  escape  into  Abeir-Toril.  The

god Ubtao stands guard against that day because if he does not

defeat her, the Night Serpent will swallow the sun.

Slitherswamp, The

Located deep beneath the city of Waterdeep, the Slitherswamp

is a largely unexplored sublevel between Levels Four and Five

of  Undermountain.  Halaster  stocked  the  Slitherswamp  with

abductees  from  Najara  in  the  Year  of  the  Sighing  Serpent

(1289 DR), and it is still populated primarily by dark nagas,

ophidians, and snakes of all sorts. Contact between the Slith-

erswamp and Najara was not reestablished until the Year of

the Serpent (1359 DR), when a dark naga dwelling in Under-

133

620_96566_SerpentKin92-135.indd   133

mountain  discovered  a  portal.  This  particular  portal  linked

the  Slitherswamp  with  an  area  of  rolling  grasslands  in  the

shadow of the Serpent Hills some 3 miles west of what is now

Ithkyxans Lair (see Najara, above).

More than half of the Slitherswamps inhabitants vanished

via a second portal during Halasters Higharvestide in the Year

of the Gauntlet (1369 DR). This group is now imprisoned in

the depths of the Nameless Dungeon in the High Forest, and

no contact has been made to date.

Skullport

The  Port  of  Shadows  is  a  teeming  hive  of  evil  that  lies  deep

beneath Waterdeep, on Level Three of Undermountain. In the

wretched  heart  of  this  subterranean  citys  mercantile  district,

among the stone columns of the lower Trade Lanes, a magni -

cent structure stands out among the nearby homes and taverns.

Its walls are carved with images of serpents and scales, and two

powerfully  muscled,  snake-tailed  Yuan-ti  (CE  male  halfblood

yuan-ti  ghter 4) stand guard at its gates. Called the Snake Pit

by its wary neighbors, this imposing edi ce is the residence of

Zstulkk Ssarmn (see page 142), a prominent slaver of the Iron

Ring consortium.

Disturbing sounds emanate from within the structure at all

hours, and odd, spicy odors leech through its walls. A company

of pureblood and halfblood yuan-ti is always on hand to deal

with intruders, along with a host of charmed Large constrictors,

monitor lizards, Large vipers, and other reptiles that patrol the

interior corridors. The  oors are dotted with concealed pits  lled

with vipers, and hidden chutes that lead directly to a temple of

Sseth below the structure.

In the heart of Zstulkks mansion, a coiled ramp leads down

into the stone below. At its bottom lies a cavern lit with lurid

red  ame. Magic heats pools of water and causes small geysers

to erupt around the cavern  oor, making the air steamy. The

resulting  atmosphere  is  reminiscent  of  the  southern  jungles,

though no trees or ferns grow this far underground. From the

cavern  oor, a small step pyramid rises like a coiled serpent, its

stone walls carved with more reptilian imagery. At this temple,

Zstulkk  Ssarmn  leads  his  Yuan-ti  brood  in  worship  of  Sseth

(now Set), preaching that the Great Snake will lead his people

back to the power they held during the height of Mhairshaulk

and Serpentes.

This cavern is the terminus of the skull-shaped portal in

the tail of the Great Petri ed Serpent that lies in the Serpent

Hills.  Travelers  emerge  from  thin  air  right  in  front  of  the

entrance  to  the  templeand  right  under  the  watchful  eyes

of  two  halfblood  guards.  The  guards  greet  Yuan-ti  visitors

from  the  Serpent  Hills  formally  and  invite  them  to  refresh

themselves in the warm pools until Zstulkk Ssarmn can meet

with them. They swiftly attack any other creature that passes

through the portal, but they try to take captives rather than

kill  intruders  outright,  so  that  Zstulkk  can  interrogate  the

prisoners at his leisure.

A carved snakes head juts out above the temple doorway, and

its ruby eyes serve as a scrying mechanism for Zstulkk Ssarmn.

A mirror hanging on the wall of his sleeping chamber in the

mansion above constantly shows what the snakes gemstone eyes

can see. In this way, he keeps track of all visitors approaching

the temple via the portal.

Although  his  origins  and  original  tribe  are  unknown,

Zstulkk  Ssarmn  is  an  important   gure  in  Skullports  thriv-

ing slave trade and a founding member of the Iron Ringa

consortium  of  slavers  that  keeps  the  slave  business  running

in the city. The abomination has only recently completed his

temple to Sseth, and he is now working hard to increase the

numbers  of  yuan-ti  in  his  employ.  Zstulkk  encourages  his

underlings  to  operate  vigorous  breeding  programs  and  keeps

the  resulting  eggs  safe  in  the  subterranean  temple.  He  also

accepts new recruits from the Chultan Peninsula, Najara, and

Hlondeth, but he does not allow any Yuan-ti to remain in the

city without joining his organization and swearing loyalty to

him. So far, the only Yuan-ti to escape from under his thumb

is  his  own  nephew  and  sworn  enemy,  Nhyris  DHothek  (see

page 143), who sometimes frequents the cellars of the Dizzy

Drake tavern to plot his revenge. Zstulkk dreams of bringing

all of Skullport under Yuan-ti domination and converting the

city into a serpentine city-state, with himself as priest-king. In

such a manner, he hopes to found not only a city but also a

great tribe of his own.

In addition to the yuan-ti who travel to Skullport via the

portal, Zstulkk Ssarmn happily welcomes pureblood and tainted

one spies from Chult who arrive via merchant ships operated

by  the  Rundeen.  Zstulkk  commands  legions  of  spies  through-

out Skullport and even in Waterdeep because he has come to

realize that information is truly the most valuable commodity

in Skullport.

Skullport lies along the subterranean river Sargauth. Over

the  centuries,  several  portals  large  enough  for  entire  ships  to

pass  through  have  been  built  in  the  cavern  walls  along  this

waterway. One such portal, about 400 feet east of Skull Island,

is only faintly visible as a scratched outline in the stone. (A suc-

cessful DC 30 Spot check enables a character to notice it from a

ships deck. A character actively scanning for it can  nd it with

a successful DC 20 Search check.) Triggering the portal requires

no  special  keyjust  extraordinary  con dence  on  the  part  of

the ships pilot, since the vessel must be steered bow- rst into

the wall. When the bowsprit makes contact with the portal, the

vessel and all its contents are transported instantly to the middle

of the Lapal Sea.

Fleeing the Peaks of Flame

620_96566_SerpentKin92-135.indd   135

5/12/04, 4:23:11 PM

Its certainly possible to construct and run a FORGOTTEN

REALMS campaign in which all of the PCs are yuan-ti,

and  their  foes  are  yuan-ti  of  rival  tribes,  Scaleless

Ones, and every other sort of creature in Faern. This chapter,

however, discusses approaches for using the yuan-ti as the main

villains in a more typical campaign dominated by human, elf,

dwarf, and hal ing adventurers.

Making  the  yuan-ti  the  main  villains  doesnt  mean  that

bloodthirsty armies of yuan-ti must slither up to menace PCs

upstairs, downstairs, and everywhere else. Rather, it means that

Yuan-ti of a particular tribe, cult, or local area can serve admi-

rably as the prime movers of evil in campaign play, even if they

stay in the background much of the time.

DMing to a Storyline

The yuan-ti are combat geniuses, but they are also dedicated to

the  Sacred  Way  of  Sseth.  Their  approach  can  be  summed  up

in  the  advice  that  one  wise  old  Yuan-ti  offered  centuries  ago

to young and eager kin who were about to enter an unfamiliar

human city: Always skulk, strike unseen, and glide softly. Let

your  targets  think  of  others  as  their  foes,  and  become  their

unexpected doom. Manipulate before  ghting, and ride unfold-

ing events so that your part in them can escape the notice of

humans and others as much as possible. Brutes they may be, but

to do things their way is to become as they are. We are better

than that, and Sseth expects us to show it.

In  keeping  with  the  Sacred  Way  of  Sseth,  an  organized

Yuan-ti foe continually recedes from the PCs rather than con-

fronting them directly. PCs menaced by yuan-ti are likely to be

framed for bad deeds, and their names may be subtly smeared

in  whispered  rumor  campaigns.  Their  unattended  goods  may

be  stolen  and  their  property  vandalized.  Their  servants  and

mounts  may  disappear  without  reason.  Almost  every  useful

contact the characters make when buying goods or gathering

information vanishes shortly afterward. Yuan-ti plants (such

as  fangs  of  Sseth  in  wholly  human  form)  may  replace  a  few

of these people, feeding the PCs false information that could

well lead them into traps. The majority, however, become un-

fortunate victims of the yuan-ti and end their days as slaves,

sacri ces, or snake food.

As their plots progress, the yuan-ti arrange local shortages

of goods and investment opportunities, foster rumors, and oth-

erwise manipulate the characters. Eventually, the manipulations

become  continual,  and  the  characters  live  in  an  increasingly

staged world that makes them easier and easier for the yuan-ti

to  manage.  Whenever  the  PCs  move  on  from  a  community,

certain Yuan-ti move with them, using the characters presence

as cover for their own dark deeds.

But the yuan-ti must do much more than react to the adven-

turers in their midst. As masterminds of evil, they must have

their own long-term planideally one hatched by you as the DM

before the PCs ever make contact with them. Though the char-

acters may be regular pawns in such a plot, it should not depend

entirely on them. This grand plan shouldnt be carved in stone;

rather, it should continually alter as the yuan-ti take advantage

of changing opportunitiesjust as adventurers shift their plans

to re ect changing situations and new  opportunities.

If the PCs manage to uncover some Yuan-ti activities, the in-

troduction of an NPC sage learned in local history could afford

the players a chance to discuss what theyve learned in charac-

ter.  With  the  help  of  the  sage,  they  can  speculate  as  to  what

the yuan-ti might do next, or how many more dark deeds and

slithering in uences remain as yet unrevealed in the area. The

yuan-ti may well eavesdrop on such a discussionin fact, the

sage himself may be a disguised Yuan-ti. In that case, he should

be careful to draw out all PC knowledge and suspicions regarding

Yuan-ti plans so that he can judge what manner of threat they

pose. Thereafter, the sage is likely to steer the characters into

136

5/13/04, 7:45:55 AM

YUAN-TI CAMPAIGN

traps or convince them to attack foes of the yuan-ti by intimat-

ing that such persons are covert agents of the serpentfolk.

The  yuan-ti  are  masters  at  spotting  other  local  plotters

(such as dopplegangers, agents of the Red Wizards of Thay or

the Zhentarim, and cabals of dissatis ed nobles or merchants),

and they tend to leave such organizations in place rather than

attacking  them  or  frustrating  their  efforts.  The  presence  of

such schemers provides Yuan-ti with masks to hide behind and

additional people to manipulate. In fact, the PCs could battle

such lesser foes for years without realizing that the yuan-ti stand

behind them. As the monk Sathaerus of Candlekeep warned cen-

turies ago: Remember that there are other secret rulers of the

world besides old and crazed evil wizardsand some of these are

far better schemers.

The Insidious Plot

Though the long-term goal of the yuan-ti is to enslave all other

creatures,  the  vrael  olo  are  taught  from  birth  that  this  goal

cannot be reached in their lifetimes. Thus, success for a Yuan-ti

lies  in  advancing  the  races  agenda  in  a  way  that  pleases  the

tribal elders and Sseth and retiring in luxury.

The Nature of the Plot

Yuan-ti plots always involve gaining power, but they vary in scale.

A small-scale plot might involve corrupting a wealthy family or

dominating a village in order to draw pro ts from its businesses

and snatch away a few sacri ces for Sseth. A larger plot might

require covertly seizing control of a trading coster, not only to

skim monetary pro ts, but also to use its caravans, ships, and

traders to move messages and goods around Faern to further

other Yuan-ti plans. Major goals usually involve ruling a human

kingdom, city, port, or market town, preferably from behind the

throne, thereby gaining access to all the areas resources.

The  yuan-ti  see  it  as  only  right  that  all  rulers  and  other

formidable  individuals  (such  as  powerful  wizards  and  highly-

ranked  priests)  in  human  societies  be  the  dupes  of  the  vrael

olo, and their lesser schemes are usually geared to contribute to

such long-term goals. The yuan-ti may arrange the deaths of

unbiddable rulers, nobles, or courtiers, take over local slave and

drug trades, or even instigate wars between human landsall

to further their secret schemes.

But while some human deaths are often necessary to advance

a plan, the destruction of all humans is not part of their ulti-

mate  goal.  Rather,  the  yuan-ti  view  humans  as  livestock  that

should be tended carefully, bred, and altered judiciously for the

maximum yield. Seizing wealth and power in the short term and

slaying others recklessly is the folly of lesser races that are ruled

by greed and short-sightedness.

This  attitude  explains  why  the  yuan-ti  never  want  to  rule

openly in human society. To do so would make them targets and

occupy  their  time  with  worries  about  personal  security.  They

much prefer to control rulers and those close to them through

drugs, blackmail, or the advice of disguised purebloods. Openly

coercing  a  human  is  considered  unforgivably  clumsy.  Rather,

controlled humans are kept ignorant of whos really pulling the

strings, so that any vengeance they may take simply eliminates

other expendable creatures rather than the yuan-ti who are truly

to blame.

A typical Yuan-ti plot might unfold in any number of ways,

but it always involves many  lters between the yuan-ti and their

victims. For instance, a blackmail threat to a noble may come

from a rival noble, a courtier, or even a rich merchant, who in

turn is being blackmailed by another human into making the

threatwhich he doesnt really mind doing because he hates the

target in question or stands to make a tidy pro t. The human

blackmailing the blackmailer may be a minor mage whos part

of a secret society dedicated to the overthrow of those in power.

Should  anyone  trace  the  plot  back  to  the  minor  mage,  the

blame will fall on the secret society because the mage herself

believes that a contact within the organization put her up to it.

The  secret  society  doesnt  actually  know  anything  about  this

little matter, because the one who issued the order isnt part of

the organization at all. Meanwhile, other Yuan-ti are at work

manipulating other members of the secret society so that none

of them can be absolutely sure that the whole situation wasnt a

society plot.

Even if the PCs make swift and bloody work of snatching

aside the deceptions and charge relentlessly through the web of

intrigue, much interesting play can ensue along the way. And

further  Yuan-ti  misdirections  at  each  step  are  likely  to  lead

adventurers astray, and even cause them to make enemies who

have nothing to do with the yuan-ti.

Slithering into a New Area

When entering a new humanoid community, Yuan-ti typically

lurk in disguise for some time. During this period, they devote

their energies to learning who wields power, who has wealth, how

trade functions, where goods  ow, and who the important and

in uential individuals are. Only when they are satis ed that they

understand the community well enough to manipulate local crea-

tures and events with precision do they begin their operations.

The  yuan-ti  typically  start  by  spreading  rumors,  which

accomplishes  three  main  goals.  First,  it  tests  the  speed  and

effectiveness of the local grapevine and reveals how much dis-

tortion and embellishment occurs along the way. Second, rumors

lure local criminal types with whom the vrael olo are interested

in dealing to the doorsteps of their agents. And  nally, rumors

are the  rst step in shifting local attitudes to favor the trade

practices that the yuan-ti intend to establish.

Next, the yuan-ti make contacts with local criminals, either

through  agents  or  in  disguise,  and  start  working  with  them.

Such  joint  operations  are  always  conducted  in  a  way  that  en-

tirely conceals Yuan-ti involvement and allows them to judge the

character and resources of their new allies. Once their contact

networks are established, the vrael olo gradually begin increasing

their in uence in shady affairs, perhaps by becoming the best

customers of local fences or establishing a network of thugs who

slay or beat up others for hire. Soon the yuan-ti have eyes and

ears in every tavern, festhall, and other place where criminals

137

620_96566_SerpentKi136-143.indd   137

5/13/04, 7:46:02 AM

YUAN-TI CAMPAIGN

gather. At that point, they can extend their in uence still more

by gaining control of warehouses, hiding-caches, and wagons or

ships used in illicit trade.

At the same time, other Yuan-ti agents work to establish them-

selves locally as successful merchants or nobles relocating from

elsewhere. They take pains to become personally acquainted with

local rulers, high-ranking priests, and other in uential individuals

while learning all they can about the affairs of such persons. Once

they know the weaknesses of those in power, they secretly loan

funds to those who need it,  x problems for those in trouble, and

otherwise make the important folk beholden to them.

Those the yuan-ti identify as foes are eliminated in accidents

or framed for crimes. When a local business is ruined in the course

of such operations, a Yuan-ti agent is always on hand to buy out

or seize the property of the unfortunate citizen. If winning over

a strong-minded individual suits their purposes better than slaying

him, the yuan-ti set to work with drugs (see Lords of Darkness

and Book of Vile Darkness for information on drugs).

Once  they  are  established,  the  yuan-ti  begin  looking  for

long-term ways to exploit local resources without drawing too

much  attention  to  themselves.  The  vrael  olo  are  particularly

skilled at milking communities for decades while keeping their

economies and citizens healthy. After all, a happy,  ourishing

town whose activities enrich everyone (including the yuan-ti) is

a much better asset than a dying, fear-ruled community whose

resources  have  been  completely  drained  by  greedy  overlords.

Toward that end, the yuan-ti spirit any troublemakers away into

slavery, invest in local businesses, and continually re-evaluate the

uses to which their human farms can be put.

The yuan-ti also groom and foster the local rumor mill as a

means  of  in uencing  human  behavior.  The  vrael  olo  and  their

agents steer the rumors they have planted to keep the inevitable

growth  and  distortion  heading  in  the  desired  direction.  For  ex-

ample, a rumor about hidden gold in a certain location might be

twisted to many evil folk guard ill-gotten riches hereabouts or

many folk have died without revealing just where they hid their

gold, but it must be close by, and were only now starting to realize

just  how  much  there  must  be.  The  second  version  is  appropri-

ate  for  drawing  adventurers,  speculators,  and  other  greedy  folk,

especially if augmented by tales of a few young innocents  nding

staggering amounts of gold. When newcomers arrive to investigate

the rumors, the yuan-ti cull out any uncontrollable evil creatures

and use their agents to hire craftworkers and establish trade deal-

ings with merchants they want to keep in the community.

Should  the  yuan-ti  actually  wish  to  shatter  a  community,

they  can  do  so  with  the  greatest  of  ease.  They  can  taint  the

water  supply,  start  the  right  fearful  rumors  when  the  bodies

start to pile up, ruin businesses, and leave foes isolated in their

homes  or  keeps  without  food  or  aid.  With  the  resources  they

have at their disposal, they can turn a thriving community into

a ghost town in a tenday or less. Thereafter, they can use agents

to plant rumors that a particular beast or fell organization was

responsible for the disaster in order to lure adventurers, priests,

or rulers to the location to set things right. When the interlopers

arrive, the yuan-ti can capture or slay them with ease.

Into the Open

Adventurers  are  the  exceptional  individuals  in  any  campaign,

and player satisfaction revolves around accomplishment. Thus,

with good planning and a bit of luck, the PCs should be able

to uncover a little of whats really going on early in the game.

A  few  interconnected  adventures  may  reveal  that  Yuan-ti  are

lurking under their very feet, or behind the walls of a familiar

palace,  shop,  or  festhall.  Actually  coming  to  grips  with  their

scaly foes, however, should require years of work.

Nevertheless, the time may come when you as DM want an

open confrontation between the PCs and the yuan-ti every bit

as much as your frustrated players do. But you dont have to be

obviousletting the PCs hear hissing and so that they can just

burst  in  on  an  enclave  of  serpentfolk.  Instead,  you  can  stage

such an event in any number of ways that offer long-term play

possibilities and enhance the mystery and intrigue that youve

worked so hard to build in your campaign.

PCs in the Middle

Perhaps  Yuan-ti  from   ercely  opposed  tribes  or  organizations

(such as the SeSehen tribe and the Coiled Cabal, or the SeSehen

and Eselemas tribes) both move into an area where the PCs are

and start to  ght each other. If the parties involved hate one

another enough, the con ict might rapidly escalate to the level

of  ghting in the open, regardless of who might see.

All  the  yuan-ti  are  likely  to  view  PCs  who  get  caught  be-

tween the warring forces as either agents of the opposing side

or stooges upon whom the open battles can be blamed. (Those

serpentfolk  ghting in the streets? They were brought here by

the reckless spells of those no-good outlander adventurers! You

can never trust folk like that, I warn you! Sooner or later, they

always bring trouble, and folk get killed! Killed dead! ). Desper-

ate Yuan-ti may try to gain the PCs aid by offering them deals.

Once the characters have been swept into the con ict, agents

working for the other side are likely to attack them whenever

the time or situation seems favorable. If the PCs survive, Yuan-ti

from the side that recruited them may covertly show up, asking

them to perform a little mission in return for a certain reward.

Such  continued  contact  with  the  yuan-ti  can  give  the  PCs  a

glimpse of the labyrinthine plots and counterplots that underlie

the local community, nearby lands, and all of Faernif they

live that long.

Avenging Snakes

Yuan-ti  can  come  into  the  open  for  other  reasons  as  well.

Though they are ruthless creatures who are notoriously slow to

make friends, even among their own kind, their need for love

and  companionship  is  no  less  strong  than  that  of  any  other

intelligent being. Occasionally one Yuan-ti manages to develop a

close partnerships with one or more fellow Yuan-ti. More often,

however, a vrael olo silently idolizes an older, more successful

Yuan-ti (often an elder of her tribe or an ahass) from afar.

YUAN-TI CAMPAIGN

If  such  a  love-mate  or  idol  is  harmed  or  slain  by  another

Yuan-ti, the furious or grieving survivor is likely to develop a per-

fect plot for vengeance, then patiently and cold-bloodedly carry it

through. But if the perpetrator is a Scaleless One, a vrael olo may

give in to her rage, bursting into the open with all the agents,

allies, magic, and aid she can muster, intent on slaughtering any

creature even remotely connected to the affront. The yuan-ti still

isnt likely to attack recklessly, but she may throw away the lives

of her agents and allies without hesitation and then wade into

battle herself instead of seeking to strike covertly.

Religious Differences

Another cause of open Yuan-ti activity outside of the jungles

is  the  strife  between  Set  and  Sseth,  which  has  resulted  in  an

ever-growing restlessness in both the yuan-ti and the sarrukh

populations. Some Yuan-ti have been driven to almost human

impatience,  and  many  want  to  lash  out  at  their  foes.  A  few

entertain  themselves  with  orgies  of  hunting  and  slaughtering

slaves in walled hunting preserves (country estates), but others

may boil up out of the cellars of cities on dark or foggy nights

to  personally  rend  a  few  humans  before  slithering  back  into

hiding again.

The Old Trick

In keeping with their love of subtlety, Yuan-ti often use irresist-

ible tacticsploys that creatures cant help but react to, even if

they have some suspicion about what is going on. As the wizard

Vangerdahast, Mage Royal of Cormyr, once said of a favored

tactic, Old and obvious this may bebut the old tricks are old

for one inescapable reasonthey work.

The  particular  old  trick  of  which  Vangerdahast  spoke  is  a

favorite of the yuan-ti. In a land or city-state rife with tension

and competing powers, the vrael olo covertly place several agents

to support the ruler, and several others to aid his strongest rebels

or opponents. Their goal is not to overthrow the ruler, but to

 ush  out  malcontents  by  pushing  the  rebels  into  prominence.

Those who join their cause while it seems to have a chance of

success can then be identi ed for later removal.

If  the  ruler  truly  feels  threatened  during  the  crisis,  the

yuan-ti  rush  agents  forward  as  timely  allies  to  rescue  him,

thereby  winning  his  gratitude  along  with  suitable  rewards.  If

the PCs  ght on behalf of the ruler, the yuan-ti arrange  for

them to take orders from their agents. This tactic ensures that

the yuan-ti can keep abreast of PC deeds, aims, and attitudes.

If by luck and boldness the rebels actually manage to seize

the throne, the yuan-ti still pro t because their agents in that

group rise to power. However, they try to arrange for the rebels

to fail so that those opposed to the ruler can all be swept away

at once.

Another example of an irresistible tactic is the spreading of

a  false  plague.  They  simply  introduce  drugs  that  temporarily

alter the appearance of human skin into food or water supplies,

then buttress the impression of illness with rumors and a few

spells. The yuan-ti in ict the false sickness on trade rivals or

foes who know of their presence, then let fearful neighbors do

the shunning, slaying, casting out, or burning of persons and

property for them. Many PCs who slaked their blades in Yuan-ti

blood have awakened the next day to  nd their skin green and

fearful folk attacking them with crossbows and pitchforks.

Orders of the Faith

Immediately upon becoming active in a new area, the yuan-ti

establish a local altar to Sseth. Eventually, such altars become

temples,  and  from  time  to  time  both  altars  and  temples  ac-

quire new priests. On such occasions, the clergy of Sseth often

demand something more of the worshipers than a steady supply

of sacri ces and adherence to the Sacred Way of Sseth. Most

commonly,  the  special  offering  they  have  in  mind  is  at  least

one local creature that is not a Yuan-ti (usually a human) who

willingly converts to the worship of Sseth.

Eventually  such  a  creature  must  be  convinced  to  worship

at the temple, and at some point to willingly engage in Yuan-ti

breeding experiments (almost certainly with a creature not of

her kind). Care of the utmost quality is always provided in such

cases, since Yuan-ti arent interested in breeding failures or wast-

ing the life of a possible breeder. Nevertheless, the process can

easily  kill  or  maim  female  creatures,  thus  depriving  Sseth  of

one  of  his  humanoid  faithful.  Such  risks  force  the  yuan-ti  to

seek  additional  converts  within  the  humanoid  community  to

ensure that the death of one creature doesnt altogether negate

the humanoid worship of the Slitherer Supreme.

Ful lling such religious dictates may force Yuan-ti to contact

humans  in  ways  they  otherwise  wouldnt,  and  to  befriend  or

even seduce them rather than seizing them as sacri ces, slaves,

or  food.  When  they  use  such  direct  tactics,  they  often  try  to

corrupt an entire familypreferably one of wealth and in u-

ence,  since  such  worshipers  are  considered  better  offerings  to

Sseth than members of a poor, backstreet clan. If at all possible,

Yuan-ti try to acquire several families of worshipers and keep

them apart from (and ignorant of) each other. This tactic en-

sures that discovery of one group by the authorities doesnt lead

to the unmasking of the others.

Many human worshipers of Sseth are used as Yuan-ti agents

for years. Eventually, their vrael olo contacts come to regard

them  as  favorite  pets,  aiding  and  indulging  them  whenever

possible. Ultimately, a human worshiper of Sseth can become

a prized sacri cein fact, one who goes willingly to the altar

is considered almost as holy as an accomplished and respected

Yuan-ti who willingly offers himself.

Snake Companions

Unsurprisingly,  snakes  are  by  far  the  most  favored  familiars,

companion creatures, and pets of yuan-ti. Some individuals even

wear snakes coiled or draped around their bodies, taking com-

fort in their company and the feel of scales upon scales. Others

use serpents as spies, lookouts, and guardians.

139

5/13/04, 7:46:15 AM

YUAN-TI CAMPAIGN

Some snakes, known as the Holies of Sseth, are sancti ed in

temple rituals. These creatures perform such functions as car-

rying the bodies of sacri ces to the altars and guarding temple

relics and supplies.

The yuan-ti alter some snakes by means of magic and drugs,

raising their intelligence until they have enough awareness to

become truly evil (usually granting them Intelligence scores of

at  least  4).  Such  altered  snakes  may  also  grow  to  tremendous

size,  advancing  to  maximum  Hit  Dice  during  the  treatment.

The half- end template may be applied as an acquired template

to such creatures to re ect their augmented powers.

Familiars

A  typical  yuan-ti  familiar  (a   endish  Tiny  viper)  appears  on

page 201 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. Flying snakes (detailed

in Races of Faern) may also serve powerful Yuan-ti spellcasters

as familiars, carrying out tasks such as spying, delivering mes-

sages, and snatching small, light items such as herbs and gems.

Deathfangs  (also  described  in  Races  of  Faern)  are  employed

by many tribal elders, anathema cult leaders, and senior Coiled

Cabalists as guardians for treasure caches and prized slave stor-

age areas. Necromancers also use them as familiars.

A yuan-ti spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat (see

Chapter 9) can use a jaculi, mlarraun, or whipsnake as a familiar,

as well as a spitting crawler, lizard, a muckdweller, a deathfang,

or  a   ying  snake.  One  without  that  feat  may  choose  a  dung

snake, reed snake, or sewerm in lieu of a viper.

Yuan-ti  have  domesticated  and  trained  a  great  variety  of

creatures as servitors, salable slaves, hunting companions, and

guardians. Several doglike creatures and snake-dog crossbreeds

serve the yuan-ti as guards and hunters, most notably the nifern

of the Underdark (see Chapter 6). The vrael olo are constantly

breeding and cross-breeding newly captured creatures to see what

results. Canines seem to produce optimal crossbreeds, whereas

feline breeding experiments usually fail.

Most yuan-ti breeding experiments produce twisted, helpless

creatures  of  horrible  aspect  (often  with  multiple  heads)  that

soon perish, and almost all are sterile. A few of these monsters

see service as guardians, and others are unleashed on humanoid

communities that have dared to defy the yuan-ti.

Occasionally,  when  such  a  nightmare  creature  proves  con-

trollable, it is set up as a god for jaded or gullible city-dwelling

humans to worship in underground cults. The yuan-ti can then

command  believers  among  the  cultists  to  undertake  tasks  for

their faith.

Secret Organizations

Yuan-ti love to organize cabals and societies, both among their

own  kind  and  for  the  manipulation  of  lesser  beings.  Humans

are especially drawn to the mystery of such organizationsgive

humans a secret sign and a password to make them think theyre

special, and theyll do just about anything! Some secret societies

are little more than fronts and misdirections, but others dedicate

themselves to particular goals and become political powers in

their own right. Chapters 1 and 7 outline many of the more

powerful and lasting of these organizations, but every anathema

and  abominationand  about  every  fourth  or   fth  ambitious

purebloodtries to set up at least one such group.

Most  yuan-ti  secret  organizations  are  controlled  by  an

inner circle of six or fewer yuan-ti founders, each of whom

recruits up to three members with promises of hefty rewards.

Because recruitment is conducted in disguise, the newcomers

never  know  the  true  identities  (or  even  the  true  natures)  of

their superiors.

The  second-rank  members  are  then  instructed  to  recruit

their own underlings, though never more than three per indi-

vidual. Their superiors tell them to choose carefully, since theyll

be held responsible for their underlings actions. Spying on and

testing recruits is encouraged, and the second-rank members are

warned to reward (and scare) their underlings enough to cement

loyalty. Any who demonstrate the slightest sign of weakness or

treachery must be ruthlessly eliminated. The inner circle then

suggests that third-rank members also be encouraged to recruit

their own underlings to run in the  eld, and so forth.

Once recruitment is in full swing, the inner circle begins to

spy on members, seeking to learn who is part of the organization

for several rungs down. Inner circle members issue false orders

from time to time to see whether there are any leaks. Once they

are satis ed as to security, the organization sets to work.

Many  senior  yuan-ti  are  members  of  two  or  three  differ-

ent  organizations  and  inner-circle  members  of  another  three

or more. They derive much of their pleasure from keeping all

their schemes separate and subtly advancing.

Most  humans  cant  conceive  of  trying  to  keep  so  many

deceptions  going  at  once.  Doing  so  successfully  requires  the

yuan-ti outlook on life, a bit of luck, a good network of spies,

the ability to judge individuals shrewdlyand sometimes, sheer

brute force.

Major Yuan-ti NPCs

As examples of how powerful the successful leaders of shadowy

yuan-ti organizations can be, three yuan-ti bosses are presented

below.

THE SERPENT SIBYL

The offspring of a yuan-ti abomination and a marilith demon,

the Serpent Sibyl believes herself to be a reincarnation of Sseth,

the avatar who ruled Serpentes a thousand years ago. Her fol-

lowers believe so, too.

Though the Serpent Sibyl is coldly arrogant, cruel, and des-

potic, she has the ability to inspire her followersstirring them

with glowing descriptions of their ancient empires and spurring

them on to regain that lost glory. She also believes wholeheart-

edly in that vision and imagines herself ruling a new, grander

yuan-ti empire for centuries, just as Sseth did.

The  presence  of  Sseth  overwhelmed  the  Serpent  Sibyls

mind during the Time of Troubles and left her with imperfect

memories of what occurred. She recalls a feeling of great personal

might when she looked down on the Pit of Vipers (see Serpen-

tes in Chapter 7) from high above the Lapal Sea, and she also

remembers using that power to battle a great-jawed reptile that

was a re with divine power. Some yuan-ti have told her that she

battled Ubtao, who had taken the form of a great, carnivorous

lizard, and she is eager to accept that explanation. But whatever

the truth of what befell her in the Time of Troubles,

the  Serpent  Sibyl  knows  that  during  that  dark

time,  Sseth  possessed  her  and  used  her  as  his

avatar.  Because  that  possession

strengthened  her  body  rather

than  rending  or  withering  it,

she knows that she could serve as

Sseth Reborn at any timeand

the  past  history  of  Serpentes

might well be repeated.

YUAN-TI CAMPAIGN

Constrict  (Ex):  The  Serpent  Sibyl  deals  1d6+12  points  of

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, the Serpent Sibyl

must hit a Large or smaller creature with its bite attack. It can

then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provok-

ing  an  attack  of  opportunity.  If  it  wins  the  grapple  check,  it

establishes a hold and can constrict.

Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 19, initial and secondary

damage 1d6 Con.

Produce Acid (Sp): The Serpent Sibyl exudes acid from her

body, dealing 3d6 points of acid damage to the next creature

she touches, including a creature hit by her bite attack. If she

is grappling, constricting, or pinning a foe when she uses this

power, her grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, the Serpent Sibyl can make

a normal melee attack to deal 20 extra points of damage to a

good foe.

Alternate Form (Sp): The Serpent Sibyl can assume the

form of a Tiny to Large viper (see the Snake entry on page

280 of the Monster Manual) as a psionic ability. This abil-

ity is similar to a polymorph spell (caster level 19th), but she

doesnt regain any lost hit points by changing form and can

take only viper shapes. The Serpent Sibyl uses her own poison

for her bite attack or that of the form she assumes, whichever

is more potent.

Chameleon Power (Sp): The Serpent Sibyl can psionically

change  her  own  coloration  and  that  of  her  equipment  to

match  the  surroundings,  gaining  a  +10  circumstance  bonus

Description: The Serpent Sibyl has a 14-foot-long, snakelike

body covered with thick black scales. Four humanoid arms, also

covered in scales, protrude from her body below the neck. She

uses two arms for spellcasting and wields a massive spiked chain

in the other two. Two great leathery wings, like those of a ptero-

dactyl, sprout from her back near her shoulders. Her eyes glow

red with malevolence.

Zstulkk Ssarmn

Zstulkk Ssarmn hails from the city of Hlondeth, though he isnt

related to its ruling Extaminos family. For most of his adult life,

he has made his fortune in Skullport in the slave trade.

Even in the cutthroat world of Skullport, Zstulkk is a slaver

without peer, and he remains one of the strongest members of

the Iron Ring consortium that he helped found. His gangs of

halfblood  and  pureblood  yuan-ti  thugs  and  overseers  are  well

known throughout Skullport. These jailers, as they are called,

are  constantly  stalking  alleyways  in  search  of  easy  marks  or

escorting chained slaves into the city.

10 minutes. Affected creatures must stay at least 20 feet away

from any snake or yuan-ti. A subject unable to move away takes

a 4 penalty to Dexterity until the effect wears off or the sub-

Description: The master of Skullports slave trade looks like

a  10-foot-long  snake  with  mottled  gray  and  black  scales.  His

handsome human face bears many scars. He has dark hair, and

his black eyes usually twinkle with malicious amusement.

Nhyris DHothek

A nephew of Zstulkk Ssarmn, Nhyris served as a sullen, lazy, but

ruthlessly capable jailer in his uncles organization. Eventually,

he happened upon the powerful artifact known as the Crown

of Horns, which was imbued with the essence of the fallen god

Myrkul. Realizing that it was an object of great power, he wore

it for a time.

The crown transformed Nhyris into a lichlike creature. The

changes it wrought drove him into an open split with Zstulkk

Ssarmn  and  his  organization,  and  his  uncle  immediately  set

about hunting him down.

Zstulkk hired many powerful mages to destroy his nephew,

but the young pureblood escaped each time. Eventually, Nhyris

was forced to  ee into Undermountain and thence into the wider

Underdark. From there, he reached the surface world of Faern,

wherein he has traveled widely.

Somewhere along the way, Nhyris lost the Crown of Horns,

but he retains the mental and physical changes it wrought upon

him. Secretive, brooding, and power-hungry, he is unwilling to

accept commands from others but eager to wield power in a far

less subtle way than the yuan-ti who follow the Sacred Way of

Sseth. Nhyris delights in manipulations, malicious destruction,

slave-dealing, and slaughter. He is always eager to seize magic

items, and he doesnt hesitate to lurk in tombs, using undead to

keep his foes from seeking him.

Nhyris always shifts into snake form and  ees when seriously

threatened. He would rather take his revenge another day than

 ght fairly and openly, thereby risking destruction. He delights

in forming short-lived organizations of humans and renegade

yuan-ti, slaying or framing those who betray him, and treating

all underlings as disposable.

of the way toward undeath while the crown was in his posses-

sion. His skin has become black, his limbs have grown thin, and

his hands and feet have withered into black, bony claws. His red,

slitted eyes have gone dull. Six bone horns grow from his skull,

and  he  wears  long,  cowled  robes  to  conceal  his  appearance  in

public. He also employs powerful perfumes to quell the odor of

decomposition that wafts from him.

Many  feats  of  a  serpentine  or  lizardly

nature, including those dealing with ex-

pectorating, poisoning, and constricting,

are available to Scaled Ones.

Feat Descriptions

Many of the feast described in this chapter belong to the category

of monstrous feats. Only creatures with a monstrous form or one

or more monstrous abilities meet the prerequisites to select these

feats. See Savage Species for additional feats of interest.

Barbed Stinger [Monstrous]

Your stinger is unusually dif cult to dislodge.

Prerequisite: Sting attack.

Bene t: You gain the improved grab special attack with your

sting. If you hit an opponent of any size with your sting attack,

you can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity. If you win the grapple check,

you establish a hold and deal automatic sting damage (including

poison, if applicable) each round that the hold is maintained.

Body Pouch [Monstrous]

You can open a cavity in your body without harm to yourself

and use it to carry or conceal items or creatures.

Prerequisite: Scaled One.

Bene t:  You  can  part  your  scales  to  reach  a  hidden,  scale-

lined,  exible cavity in your body that can accommodate objects

or  creatures.  The  pouch  can  hold  a  maximum  volume  equal

to that of a creature two or more size categories smaller than

yourself, and its maximum weight capacity is one-half your own

weight. Opening or closing the pouch requires a move action, and

removing an item from it or placing one inside requires another

move action. If you adopt a different body shape or size via any

ability that allows a change of shape, everything in your body

pouch is immediately expelled onto the ground at your feet.

If you carry a sharp-edged or pointed object (unless sheathed,

wrapped,  or  otherwise  guarded)  in  this  cavity,  you  take  2d4

points of damage for each round in which you fall, engage in

combat,  change  shape,  or  make  any  other  violent  movement,

or 1d4 points of damage for any round in which you make any

other move action.

Placing a living creature inside your pouch requires a success-

ful grapple check if it chooses to resist. Any creature inside your

body pouch remains alive and comfortable for up to 24 hours

unless you choose to attack it.

You may constrict your pouch as an attack action, dealing

1d4+1  points  of  damage  per  round  of  constriction  to  each

creature  or  object  inside.  A  creature  inside  the  pouch  dies  of

asphyxiation after being constricted for a number of consecutive

rounds equal to 2 per Constitution point it possesses. A creature

inside the pouch can cut its way out by using a light slashing or

piercing weapon to deal one-quarter of your normal hit point

total in damage to the pouch (AC equals your touch AC).

Chameleon Hide [Monstrous]

You can alter the hue of your scales to match the surrounding

terrain.

Prerequisite: Scaled One.

Bene t: As a full-round action, you can alter the color of

your scales to match your surroundings. Doing so grants you a

+2 bonus on Hide checks and a +1 circumstance bonus to Armor

Class as long as you do not move from the square.

Special:  Any  creature  that  already  has  a  racial  bonus  on

Hide checks stemming from a chameleon-like ability (such as

an ophidian) gains no bene ts from this feat.

You are immune to charm effects.

Prerequisites: Racial bonus on saving throws against charm

effects, Charm Resistance.

Bene t: You are immune to all charm effects.

Charm Resistance [General]

You can resist charm effects better than you otherwise could.

Prerequisite: Racial bonus on saving throws against charm

effects.

Bene t: You gain a +3 bonus on saving throws against charm

effects.

You can extend the skin of your neck into a cobra hood.

Prerequisite: Serpent or serpentfolk.

Bene t: As a move action, you can dilate the skin on both

sides of your neck to form a  at disk, in the manner of a cobra.

While you display this hood, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimi-

date checks, and the save DC for each of your spells, spell-like

abilities, and supernatural abilities that causes fear increases by

+1. Furthermore, any creature with an Intelligence score of 2

or below perceives you to be one size category larger than you

actually are. You can retract your skin and resume your normal

appearance as a free action.

Deadly Poison [Monstrous]

Your poison attack deals more damage than normal.

Prerequisites: Con 19, poison special attack that deals ability

damage as secondary damage, Ability Focus (poison).

Bene t: Your poison attack has the potential to deal more

secondary damage than it otherwise could. If the target of the

attack fails the secondary saving throw, the poison deals double

its normal secondary damage.

Deadly Spittle [Monstrous]

Prerequisites: Spit Venom, spit attack, or spittle attack.

Bene t:  You  can  spray  your  spit  in  a  15-foot  cone-shaped

145

620_96566_SerpentKi144-167.indd   145

5/13/04, 7:48:39 AM

FEATS

Bene t: Because of the enticing nature of your voice, you gain

a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. Furthermore, the save DC for each

of your spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that

creates a charm effect through verbal means increases by +1.

Gape of the Serpent [Monstrous]

Like  a  snake,  you  can  stretch  your  mouth  to  an  outlandish

extent to accommodate immense prey.

Prerequisite: Swallow whole special attack.

Bene t: You can swallow a creature of up to your own size

category. Swallowing a creature as big as yourself, however, is a

time-consuming process. Once you have established a hold against

such a creature, you make a new grapple check as usual, but success

indicates only that you have begun to swallow. On the following

round, you must make an additional grapple check to complete the

swallowing. The held creature can  ght or try to break the grapple

as normal while you are attempting to swallow it.

Normal: Unless otherwise noted, a creature can swallow op-

ponents up to one size category smaller than itself.

Special: Your gullet can hold one creature of the maximum size.

Other maximum numbers of swallowed creatures remain the same.

Graft Yuan-ti Flesh

[Item Creation]

You can apply yuan-ti grafts to other living creatures or to yourself.

Prerequisites: Yuan-ti, Heal 10 ranks.

Bene t:  You  can  create  yuan-ti  grafts  (see  Yuan-ti  Grafts

in Chapter 10) and apply them to other living creatures or to

yourself. Creating a graft takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its

price. To create a graft, you must spend 1/25 of its price in XP

and use raw material costing one-half of this price.

Greater Multigrab [Monstrous]

You can grapple enemies effortlessly with your natural weapons.

Prerequisites: Str 19, Dex 15, improved grab special attack,

Multigrab.

Bene t: When grappling an opponent with only the part of

your body that made the attack, you take no penalty on grapple

checks made to maintain the hold.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature takes a 20 penalty (or a

10 penalty with Multigrab) on grapple checks made to maintain

a hold with only the part of its body used to make the attack.

Improved Familiar [General]

Refer to the Improved Familiar feat on page 200 of the Dun-

geon Masters Guide. In addition to those choices, the following

familiars are available in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign.

Improved familiars do not grant any special abilities to theri

masters other than the Alertness feat, an empathic link, and hte

ability to share spells with the familiar.

You can spit farther than normal.

Prerequisites:  Precise  Shot  and  Spit  Venom,  spit  attack,  or

spittle attack.

time you take the feat, the range of your spit attack increases by

an amount equal to its original range.

Irresistible Gaze [Monstrous]

Your gaze attack is more potent than normal.

Prerequisite: Gaze attack.

Bene t: The saving throw DC for your gaze attack increases

by +2.

Special:  The  bene t  of  this  feat  stacks  with  that  of  the

Ability Focus feat (see Monster Manual).

Multigrab [Monstrous]

You can grapple enemies more  rmly than normal with your

natural attacks.

Prerequisites: Str 17, improved grab special attack.

Bene t: When grappling an opponent with the part of your

body  that  made  the  attack,  you  take  only  a  10  penalty  on

grapple checks made to maintain the hold.

Normal: Without this feat, a creature takes a 20 penalty on

grapple checks made to maintain a hold with only the part of its

body used to make the attack.

Narrowed Gaze [Monstrous]

Your gaze attack has a limited  eld of effect.

Prerequisites: Int 13, gaze attack.

Bene t:  You  may  choose  to  limit  your  gaze  attack  to  an

active gaze. Doing so prevents you from accidentally affecting

friends with your gaze.

Normal:  A  gaze  attack  functions  constantly  on  all  those

within range, and it can also be used actively as an attack action.

Pervasive Gaze [Monstrous]

Your gaze attack is more effective than normal.

146

620_96566_SerpentKi144-167.indd   146

5/13/04, 7:48:45 AM

Special: This feat does not affect eye rays, such as those of a

beholder.

Bene t:  You  can  use  your  tail  as  an  extra  hand.  It  can

grasp  melee  weapons  and  use  them  in  combat,  although  the

normal  penalties  for  using  an  off-hand  weapon  apply.  If  you

have two hands, your tail counts as a third hand for the purpose

of the Multiweapon Fighting feat and all other feats for which

it is a prerequisite.

You can also use your tail to assist with grapple checks and Climb

checks. You gain a +2 competence bonus on all such checks.

Petrification Immunity

[General]

Prerequisites: Racial bonus on saving throws against petri -

cation effects, Petri cation Resistance.

 cation effects.

Piercing Gaze [Monstrous]

Your gaze attack has a greater range than normal.

147

Puff Torso [Monstrous]

You can puff out your skin to appear larger and more threatening.

Prerequisite: Serpent or serpentfolk.

Bene t: As a move action, you can dilate the skin along your

torso in the manner of a puff adder. While your body is thus

distended, you gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks. You can

reduce your body back to its normal size as a free action.

Rending Constriction [Monstrous]

You can pull grappled enemies apart.

Prerequisites:  Str  19,  Dex  15,  constrict  special  attack,  im-

proved grab special attack, Greater Multigrab, Multigrab, two

limbs capable of grappling.

Bene t:  If  you  maintain  a  hold  on  an  opponent  with  more

than one appendage, you can make an additional rend attack in the

same round as you constrict. This attack automatically deals double

the base damage for your constrict attack, plus 1-1/2 times your

Strength bonus. The held creature is automatically released on its

next action, so you must reestablish the hold to constrict again.

Spit Venom [Monstrous]

You can spit venom in the manner of a spitting cobra.

Prerequisite: Poisonous bite attack.

Bene t: You can spit your venom up to 30 feet as ranged

touch attack. Your poison functions as a contact poison in addi-

tion to its usual delivery method. The effects are otherwise the

same  as  if  you  had  delivered  it  in  your  normal  fashion.  This

attack requires a standard action.

Tail Rattle [Monstrous]

Your tail gains a rattle like that of a rattlesnake.

Prerequisite: Serpent or serpentfolk.

Bene t: As a free action, you can create an ominous rattling

noise by shaking your tail in the manner of a rattlesnake. During

any round in which your tail rattle can be heard, you gain a +2

bonus on Intimidate checks, and the save DC for each of your

spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that has the

sonic  descriptor  increases  by  +2.  You  can  use  this  ability  even

while you are holding a weapon or other item in your tail.

5/13/04, 7:48:52 AM

Though many Scaled Ones can use the same equip-

ment  as  humanoids  and  other  Scaleless  Ones,

many  serpentfolk  have  developed  a  variety  of

equipment,  both  mundane  and  magical,  of  their  own  design.

These items are available in the markets of the various serpent

realms, as well as in humanoid citiesif the buyer knows where

to look.

Armor

Humans  in  areas  menaced  by  Scaled  Ones  have  learned  to

manufacture a variety of special kinds of armor to aid against

such foes.

Armor Descriptions

The types of armor found on Table 101: Armor are described

below (in alphabetical order), along with any special bene ts they

confer on the wearer.

TABLE 101: ARMOR

Chameleon Leather: Made from the hide of an ophidian, this

armor is common only in human communities near the Serpent

Hills. Serpentfolk who encounter a Scaleless One wearing such

armor never begin with an attitude better than unfriendly.

The breastplate and shoulder protectors of a suit of chame-

leon leather have been stiffened by boiling in oil. The rest of

the armor is softer and more  exible. Chameleon leather retains

some  of  the  ophidians  color-changing  capacity,  granting  the

wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Hide checks.

All  chameleon  leather  is  of  masterwork  quality,  since

preserving  the  hides  chameleonlike  properties  requires  the

craftsmanship of a master leatherworker.

Serpentscale Mail: This armor consists of a coat, leggings,

gauntlets, and a skirt of tanned snake hide on which the scales

have  been  carefully  preserved.  Serpentscale  mail  can  be  fash-

ioned from the hide of any serpentine creature at least one size

category larger than the intended wearer.

All serpentscale mail is of masterwork quality, since the dif-

 culty of its construction requires a master leatherworker.

Thunderhide Armor: Named for the legendary Thunderers

(dinosaurs) from which it is normally made, this armor is pre-

pared from multiple layers of tanned reptile hide. Thunderhide

armor  is  relatively  supple  compared  to  other  types  of  hide

armor. It is favored by druids from the Jungles of Chult, the

Lizard Marsh, and the Serpent Hills.

osssra  oils)  even  have  bene cial  effects  on  members  of  those

races. All, however, are baneful to Scaleless Ones.

Weapon Description

The weapon detailed on Table 102: Exotic Weapons is described

below.

Tail Scythe: A tail scythe consists of a long, curved blade that

is designed to be strapped to a serpentine tail. In fact, the weapon

is usable only by creatures possessing such an appendage, since it

does not have a handle that lends itself to a humanoid hand. The

design of the tail scythe focuses tremendous force on the sharp

point while still allowing devastating slashes with the blade edge.

Because of a tail scythes shape, you can also use it to make

trip attacks. However, if you are tripped during your own trip

attempt, you cannot drop the tail scythe to avoid being tripped.

Donning or removing a tail scythe takes 1 round with the ben-

e t of hands or assistance, or 3 rounds without.

Special Substances

The  following  special  substance  is  prized  by  Scaled  Ones

everywhere.  It  can  be  made  by  a  character  with  the  Craft

(alchemy) skill.

TABLE 103: SPECIAL SUBSTANCES

Item

Blood ower salve

Cost  Weight  Craft (Alchemy) DC

10 gp  

20

Blood ower  Salve:  Blood owers  are  red-leafed  wild owers

with  magical  properties.  Once  prevalent  on  open  plains  that

had been used as battle elds, blood owers are now found only

in the depths of the Jungles of Chult and the Mhair Jungles.

Blood ower  salve  must  be  rubbed  onto  the  body  before

damage  is  taken.  Thereafter,  it  delivers  the  bene t  of  a  cure

minor  wounds  spell  when  anyone  within  25  feet  speaks  a

command word speci ed during the creation of the salve. Blood-

 ower salve remains active until the command word is spoken

or until washed off with at least a quart of liquid.

Poisons

Almost all the serpentfolk and lizardkin use poisons from time

to time. These substances vary widely in origin, use, and effect.

Many have no effect at all on Scaled Ones, and some (such as

149

Lizardfolk Poisons

Though not as brilliant at crafting subtle means of death as the

yuan-ti, the lizardfolk have developed the skill to extract various

poisons  from  their  environment  and  render  them  into  forms

stable enough to use against foes.

Blue Frog Paste: The otherwise harmless bright blue frogs of the

Serpent Hills secrete a unique poison that the lizardfolk of Kalran

have learned to harvest. Mixing it with other natural substances

produces a highly toxic oil suitable for applying to weapons.

Sleep Poison: The lizardfolk have developed a technique for

distilling the extract of several jungle plants to produce a poison

that renders enemies unconscious.

Yuan-ti Poisons

The yuan-ti normally coat their weapons with either their own

poison or that of the vipers they keep as pets and guardians,

but a few have also experimented with distilling and combin-

ing poisons. Since snake venoms are notoriously unstable when

mixed, the result is usually a milky  uid that has no harmful

effects beyond mild acidity. Nevertheless, at least two successes

have been achieved: sssartisss and tsous.

Both of these substances are clear, sticky  uids that develop

a hard surface when in contact with air but remain viscous be-

neath this outer sheen. Thus, they can retain their virulence for

decades. Scaled Ones are immune to the effects of both poisons.

Those  familiar  with  both  can  tell  them  apart  by  odor  when

wet and by sheen when dry.

Sssartisss:  A  distillate  of  the  venoms  of  several  kinds  of

poisonous serpents, sssartisss has a bitter tang when wet and a

scaled or furrowed texture when dry.

Tsous: This substance is a mixture of cobra venom and the

extracts of several poisonous plants. It smells like overripe fruit

when wet and dries clear.

Osssra

The creations of yuan-ti spellcasters, osssra oils are mixtures of

substances that produce pungent, colorful smoke when burned.

Osssra smoke confers bene ts on all Scaled Ones but functions

as  an  inhaled  poison  for  all  other  creatures.  In  some  cases,

direct contact with the oil in either ignited or unignited form

is necessary to receive the bene t.

Yuan-ti typically immerse small pieces of  rewood in osssra

oil  for  1d4  days  and  then  burn  them  to  create  the  smoke.  A

single vial of oil can treat enough wood to  ll a 50-foot-square

room with smoke for at least 4 hours. If ignited directly, the

smoke  lls the same area but lasts only 5 rounds. Once ignited

by either method, osssra oil emits a cloud of colored smoke that

moves outward from its source as a spread at the rate of 1 foot

per round, to a maximum diameter of 60 feet. Osssra smoke is

heavily scented, but it does not cause coughing, choking, or any

other effect associated with tainted or insuf cient air.

Yuan-ti  avoid  combining  different  kinds  of  osssra  smoke

because their effects negate each other wherever they overlap.

Pools  of  unignited  osssra  oil  dont  affect  osssra  smoke  with

which  they  come  into  contact.  Mixing  two  unignited  osssra

oils ruins both, resulting in a  ammable mixed oil that has no

special effects on either reptiles or nonreptiles.

If two different osssra oils are poured together while  am-

ing, the result is a thick, strong-smelling smoke that is toxic to

any creature inhaling it. In addition to its poisonous effects (see

Table 104), this smoke has the effect of a fog cloud spell (caster

level 10th).

The secrets of making osssra oils are guarded by yuan-ti tribal

elders, and most humans know too little about them to distin-

guish one from another. In large cities or pirate ports where there

is little scrutiny from authorities, merchants often sell osssra oils

as cooking oils or scents. Some sellers arrange small demon-

strations, using slaves or aging pack-beasts as models on which to

demonstrate the precise effects of their wares.

Although some osssra effects closely resemble those of spells,

they are not magical effects. Thus, they cannot be dispelled or

prevented by spell resistance.

Amasstartae:  The  green  smoke  produced  by  this  oil  is

shot  through  with  twinkling  silvery  metallic   ecks  that  re-

semble sparks. Its smell is often described as prickle-nose spicy.

Amasstartae oil is produced by combining sap from the leaves

of the silverthorn weed with a distillate of crushed and boiled

scales from any salt-water  sh.

Amasstarte oil grants the bene t of a cure light wounds spell

to any Scaled One who pours a vial of it into a bath and soaks in

the resulting mixture for at least 1 hour. The effects are cumula-

tive for multiple hours.

Battasss: The ruby-red smoke emitted by this oil  ickers with

random darker threads and smells like scorching milk. Bat-

tasss oil is made from palm oil and the petals of the tiny white

wild ower known as fallen snow.

When  inhaled  by  a  Scaled  One,  battasss  smoke  produces

extreme  clarity  of  mind.  During  this  time,  the  Scaled  One

requires  no  Concentration  check  to  perform  any  action,  re-

gardless of distractions or combinations of effects that might

ordinarily  impair  spellcasting  or  performance.  Furthermore,

the affected reptile gains a +5 bonus on Will saves. These ef-

fects persist for as long as the Scaled One inhales the smoke

and for 3d6 minutes thereafter.

Duthlahhass: This oil produces a bright amber smoke with a

smell similar to that of sizzling seaweed or burnt moss. Human-

oids sometimes describe the scent as  ery or nose-clearing.

EQUIPMENT

Duthlahhass  oil  is  prepared  from  mint,  the  bark  of  certain

tropical trees, and the sap of the greater jungle clingvine.

In Scaled Ones, duthlahhass smoke induces dreamsleepa

deep, relaxed slumber in which they receive visions from their

own subconscious minds and occasionally their deities. The ef-

fects  of  dream  or  suggestion  spells  cast  upon  them  by  other

beings  may  also  manifest  during  such  a  sleep.  Dreamsleeping

Yuan-ti can retrieve memories (such as where or how they hid

something  long  ago,  or  snatches  of  overheard  conversation)

with crystal clarity. A dreamsleeper awakens immediately upon

taking damage; otherwise the sleep lasts for 2d4 hours after the

initial  duthlahhass  contact  (regardless  of  whether  or  not  the

smoke is gone).

Ektharisss: The dark purple smoke generated by this oil is

highlighted by occasional puffs of a slightly lighter blue color.

Its smell is reminiscent of fresh-cut lemons or limes. Ektharisss

oil is distilled from the sap of the nightshadow jungle plant,

which  can  be  easily  recognized  by  its  shield-sized,  brilliant

purple leaves.

Ektharisss alters the body density of Scaled Ones in contact

with its smoke, enabling them to use levitate as a spell-like abil-

ity at will for as long as they are in contact with the vapors

(maximum  weight  200  lbs.).  Yuan-ti  often  use  this  ability  to

reach high ledges, doors, or openings leading to treasure storage

areas. Some also use it to rest, study, or work above the reach of

distractions or hostile beings. Extreme care is required, however,

since normal weight returns the instant contact with ektharisss

smoke is lost, making falls quite likely. As with the spell, the af-

fected creature must be willing to rise, and objects can be lifted

only by a Scaled One in contact with the smoke.

Faele: This oil produces a deep blue smoke laced with occa-

sional streamers of bright emerald hue. Its reek is similar to the

sickly-sweet death smell of rotting human or elf  esh. Faele oil

consists of human or elf blood mixed with a distillate of boiled

boar brain.

Faele smoke grants a Scaled One a +4 circumstance bonus on

all Fortitude saving throws. Furthermore, any hit point damage

taken by a Scaled One under its effects is reduced by 1 point per

die, or by 1 point per attack if no die roll is involved. These ben-

e ts persist for 1d4 hours from initial contact with faele smoke.

Continued contact after that period does not extend the effect,

nor does any new contact with it renew the bene ts until 24

hours have elapsed from the expiration of the previous effect.

Hooloond:  This  oil  generates  a  yellow-green  smoke  shot

through with momentary jets of red smoke that resemble licks

of  ame. The scent of hooloond smoke is often likened to the

minty smell of fresh-cut jungle vines or melons, though it is

much stronger. Hooloond oil contains the blood of a constrictor

snake and the venom of a viper.

At  least  3  minutes  of  continuous  contact  with  hooloond

smoke heals a Scaled One of 1d4+2 points of damage. An indi-

vidual can gain this bene t twelve times in swift succession if

opportunity permits, but the smoke wont affect that particular

reptile again for a full 24 hours after its last healing. Yuan-ti

often  plan  their  battles  so  that  they  can   ght  in  continuous

contact with hooloond smoke (for example, inside a smoke cloud

or smoke- lled room). Doing so allows them to receive this heal-

ing automatically every 3 minutes.

Jalasss:  This  oil  produces  white  smoke  shot  through  with

short-lived, rainbowlike bands of iridescence. Its smell is like that

of burning paint or strongly dyed fabric. Jalasss oil is a distillate

of crushed snails and the sap of the launteenean edible plant

native to the wild  oral hotlands.

Jalasss smoke instantly and permanently banishes the effects

of all enchantment spells from the minds of Scaled Ones in con-

tact with it and makes them immune to such effects for 1d4 hours

after contact ceases. Contact with ignited jalasss oil for 1 round

maximizes this extension but deals damage as burning oil.

Laerisss: The brown smoke generated by this oil smells like

burning olives. Laerisss oil contains certain crushed insects and

the roots of several  oating swamp plants.

Laerisss smoke causes a quickening of reactions in a Scaled

One that manifests as a +2 bonus on all Re ex saves. This effect

lasts for 3d6 minutes from initial contact. The same individual

cannot be affected again for 1d4 hours, even if it remains in

contact with the smoke.

Ruusstantar: The green smoke produced by this oil is shot

through with ribbons of purple vapor, and its scent is like that

of freshly crushed grapes. Ruusstantar oil contains a distillate of

snakeskin and crushed dragon bone.

Any  Scaled  One  in  contact  with  ruusstantar  smoke  gains

1d12  temporary  hit  points  that  last  for  1d4  hours.  A  Scaled

One that pours the ignited oil over her body instead gains 2d12

temporary  hit  points  and  take  no  damage  from  the  burning

oil. These effects do not stack. Once affected by ruusstantar, a

Scaled One cant gain the bene ts from either the smoke or the

oil again until 2d4 full days have elapsed.

Ulathlasss: The dull, heavy, green smoke generated by this oil

 ows over  oors and then up walls and furnishings as though it

were a lazy serpent. Its smell is similar to that of roasting boar.

Ulathlasss oil is made from the internal juices of both carrion

crawlers and centipedes.

Ulathlasss smoke renders Scaled Ones immune to all effects

related to extremes of heat and cold (including natural torpor

and natural or magical damage), but not the effects of natural

or magical  re and ice, which deal half damage. This bene t

lasts for as long as the Scaled One is in contact with the smoke

and for 2d6 minutes thereafter.

Contact with ignited ulathlasss oil has the same effects on

reptiles  as  contact  with  the  smoke,  except  that  the  user  also

becomes immune to damage from natural and magical  re and

ice, and all bene ts persist for 3d6 minutes after contact with

the oil ceases. Ulathlasss confers no protection against lightning

or any other electricity-based effect in any of its forms.

Magic Items

Many magic items in common use today were once exclusively

associated with Scaled Ones. Common and rare examples include

daggers of venom, hands of the mage*, necklaces of natures teeth*

(constrictor  and  viper  versions),  venomous  python  rods*,  viper

daggers*, and viper rods. The following Art-crafted objects are

still almost exclusively associated with the Scaled Ones.

See Magic of Faern.

Weapons

Scaled Ones can make use of a wide variety of magic weapons.

A  few,  however,  have  developed  magic  weapons  to  meet  their

own particular needs.

MAGIC WEAPON SPECIAL ABILITIES

In addition to an enhancement bonus, a weapon can have one or

more special abilities. A weapon with a special ability must have

at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Viper: Upon command, a viper weapon transforms its blade

or lash into a viper one size category smaller than the wielder

for which it is sized. For example, the blade of a greatsword sized

for  a  Large  character  temporarily  becomes  a  Medium  viper,

while the blade of a dagger sized for a Small character temporar-

ily becomes a Tiny viper.

The wielder of a viper weapon uses his own attack bonus or

that of the viper, whichever is higher, when making an attack

with  the  transformed  weapon.  The  damage  dealt  is  always

equivalent to the base damage for the bite attack of the appro-

priate kind of viper, plus the weapons enhancement bonus and

any other applicable modi ers. A successful attack also delivers

the vipers poison. When thus transformed, viper weapons are

always treated as piercing weapons.

This ability can be applied up to three times to a scourge, with

each application converting one lash into a viper. When a viper

scourge is used with an attack action, only one viper can attack;

when it is used with a full attack action, all three can attack.

Only bladed weapons (including daggers and swords), scourges

(see  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  Campaign  Setting),  and  whips  can

become viper weapons. (If this special ability is rolled randomly

for an inappropriate weapon, reroll.) All weapons with this spe-

cial ability are emerald-green in hue and covered in scales.

A typical bladed viper weapon is crafted with a ring-pommel

that allows the bearer to hang it from a belt, tie it to his wrist

for use in mounted combat, or lower it on a cord through trap-

doors onto intruders below. (This last usage always employs the

vipers attack bonus for attacks.)

Moderate  conjuration;  CL  6th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, summon monster I (Small or smaller weapons), summon

monster II (Medium weapons), or summon monster III (Larger

or larger weapons); Price +1 bonus.

SPECIFIC WEAPONS

The following speci c weapons are usually preconstructed with

exactly the qualities described here.

Manyfang Dagger: This +1 dagger looks like a normal mas-

terwork dagger, but when it hits, three phantom blades brie y

whirl into existence around the main blade, stabbing and slicing

the same target, then winking into nothingness again. A many-

fang dagger thus deals quadruple damage on each successful hit,

or quintuple damage on a critical hit.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  10th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor; major creation, Price 32,302 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Scourge of Fangs: Favored by the yuan-ti and drow clerics of

Lolth, this +2 scourge has a handle made of adamantine and  ve

serpentine constructs as lashes. The snakes are extensions of the

wielders will that hiss and writhe in response to her thoughts and

emotions. The weapon deals damage normally, and in addition, at

the wielders mental command, the serpents can attack as sepa-

rate and independent creatures, using the statistics below. If the

wielder chooses to attack only with the snakes, she can substitute

her own base attack bonus for that of the snakes in their attacks.

The enhancement bonus of the scourge ion already included in

the attack bonuses of the snakes in the statistics below.

When a scourge of fangs is used with an attack action, only

one serpent lash can attack; when it is used with a full attack

action, all  ve can attack. If a good-aligned character tries to

wield the scourge, the snakes attack the wielder instead of the

intended target.

If a serpent lash is slain, it falls off the whip. The remaining

heads continue to function normally until all are destroyed.

Skills and Feats: Hide +11; Weapon Finesse.

Pain (Su): Anyone hit by a serpent lashs bite attack takes

a 4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for

2d4 rounds because of the wracking pain its venom produces. A

successful DC 11 Fortitude save reduces the penalty to 2.

Construct  Traits:  A  serpent  lash  has  immunity  to  poison,

sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,  disease,  death  effects,  necro-

mancy effects, mind-in uencing effects (charms, compulsions,

phantasms,  patterns,  and  morale  effects),  and  any  effect  that

requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also  works  on  objects  or  is

harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, abil-

ity damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain.

Cannot heal damage, but can be repaired. Darkvision 60 ft. and

low-light vision.

Scourge of Tiamat: This +1 corrosive viper scourge is favored

by the Dark Scaled Ones (high priests of Tiamat) in the city of

Unthalass. The weapons date back to the height of Okoth, the an-

cient sarrukh realm located in what is now southern Mulhorand.

Most  of  the  existing  scourges  of  Tiamat  have  been  recovered

from the scattered remnants of that civilization.

In  addition  to  its  normal  properties,  each  viper  head  of  a

scourge of Tiamat can spit its corrosive venom up to 30 feet as

a ranged attack. A target hit by this attack is affected by the

poison of the viper and also takes 1d6 points of acid damage for

Rings

The image of a snake eating its own tail lends itself well to

magic  rings,  so  the  serpentfolk  are  understandably

fond of such items.

Ring  of  the  Viper:  Fashioned  of  green  ser-

pentine stone, this ring is carved in the shape of

a tiny viper biting its own tail. When the wearer

makes a successful unarmed attack, the viper releas-

es its tail and automatically bites the same target. The

wearers attack deals 1 extra point of damage and in-

jects venom into the target (injury, Fortitude DC 11,

initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con).

Moderate conjuration and necromancy; CL 7th;

Forge  Ring,  poison,  summon  monster  I;  Price  8,000

Serpent Ring: Fashioned of plain brass and shaped

to resemble an open-mouthed snake wrapped around

its own tail to form a band, serpent rings are often

used as pass tokens by serpentfolk, scalykind, and

cultists of Tiamat, Set, Sseth, and Varae. (They are

especially  common  in  the  Sauringar  tribe  of  the

yuan-ti.) Spell wards in temples dedicated to these

deities are often keyed to allow passage by the bearer

of such rings. An openly displayed serpent ring attracts

immediate, suspicious attention from those who venerate

serpentkind.

The wearer of a serpent ring is immune to all serpent

venom and gains a +3 bonus on saving throws against

poison  or  acid  damage.  In  addition,  a  viper  weapon

never attacks the wearer of a serpent ring, whether

or not it is openly displayed.

Wondrous Items

The Scaled Ones have created a profusion of wondrous items, but

only a few are known outside their realms.

Circlet of Seven Serpents: Fashioned by a bard from a single

piece of serpentine stone, a circlet of seven serpents is carved to

resemble a septet of intertwined snakes, each devouring the tail

of another. The serpents eyes are tiny emeralds, and silver  ligree

sets off each snakes individual scales. Thought to be originally of

Jhaamdathan origin, such circlets have been employed by the na-

gas of the Eastern Heartlands since the founding of Sembia.

A circlet of seven serpents reveals its powers to anyone who plac-

es it upon her brow. It is considered a headband, hat, or helmet for

153

the purpose of limitations on magic items worn. The

wearer of the circlet can use charm monster and true

strike once per day each, and mage hand and open/

close at will (range 25 feet for both).

Moderate  enchantment;  CL  7th;  Craft  Won-

drous  Item,  charm  monster,  mage  hand,  open/close,

true strike; Price 14,400 gp.

Eye of Sseth: This yuan-ti device resembles a thick,

heavy gold coin about 2 inches in diameter. One side of it

is usually graven with numerals and a device such

as  a  crown,  a  monarchs  head,  or  the  arms  or

badge of a country. The other side, however, is

a jet-black, glossy serpents eye. When handled

by any Scaled One, an eye of Sseth has no effect

but any other creature that touches it is immediately

dosed with poison (contact, Fortitude DC 20, initial

and secondary damage 1d6 Con). The poison is gone

after one creature handles the coin.

If the last yuan-ti who touched that particular eye

of Sseth is still alive, he instantly becomes aware when

the eye is  rst handled by a creature other than a

Scaled One, even if it is on another plane. Fur-

thermore, he knows the approximate distance and

direction to the spot where the handling occurred

and receives a mental vision of the speci c crea-

ture that touched the eye of Sseth (but not its

companions or surroundings). If an eye of Sseth

is seized by human adventurers, passed from hand

to hand, and then spent in town, the yuan-ti who

placed it receives impressions of only the  rst adven-

turer  who  touched  it.  Eyes  of  Sseth  are  commonly

placed  with  scatterings  of  real  coins  as  warning

lures inside the entrances of yuan-ti temples, to warn

the inhabitants of intrusion.

Moderate  necromancy;  CL  7th;  Craft  Wondrous

Item; poison. Price 1,500 gp; Weight 1/10 lb.

Fang Bead: The surface of this small, lusterless black

sphere  is  graven  with  a  pair  of  fangs.  The  user  can

throw it up to 60 feet with no range penalties. If both

fangs  are  touched  simultaneously  (a  free  action)  just

before  the  bead  is  hurled,  it  bursts  upon  sharp  impact,

transforming into eight Tiny vipers (see Monster  Manual)

that wriggle to attack the nearest living creatures other than

the thrower. The snakes  ght until slain or until no living crea-

tures  other  than  the  thrower  remain  within  120  feet  of  the

beads  impact  point.  Producing  the  vipers  destroys  the  bead,

though it can be thrown or struck any number of times with-

out effect if the fangs arent triggered.

Major Artifact Descriptions

The  following  unique  items  were  produced  by  Scaled  Ones  of

great power for speci c purposes.

EQUIPMENT

Marlspire  of  Najara:  When  the  Hssta   tribe  was  trans-

ported to the Forest of Wyrms, its members brought with them

one of the few naga crowns known to exist in Faern. To mark

their oath of fealty to Terpenzi, the ha-naga king of Najara, the

tribal elders gave him the crown, intending that it should serve

as the crown of state. Since that time, the Marlspire of Najara,

as it came to be known, has passed from one naga king to the

next, and today it rests atop the brow of Ebarnaje.

In  addition  to  the  standard  powers  of  a  naga  crown  (see

below),  the  Marlspire  of  Najara  has  acquired  one  additional

property: The Guardian of Najara cannot regain its free will so

long as this item exists. Moreover, whoever wears the crown can

command the current guardian as if he or she were its creator.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Weight .

Naga Crown: These powerful items were actually created by

the yuan-ti; naga crown is merely a popular name. Each naga

crown is a silvery metal circlet with three points or spines. It re-

veals its powers to the wearer as soon as it is placed on the head.

The wearer can use see invisibility at will. With the proper

command word, he can create a repulsion or spell turning effect.

Furthermore, the wearers daily allotment of arcane spells doubles

for all spell levels. (This bene t does not stack with that of a ring

of wizardry or any other effect that grants extra arcane spells.)

Once per day, the wearer can dominate all Scaled Ones with

Intelligence scores of 2 or below within a 1,500-foot radius for 1

hour. This ability otherwise functions like the dominate monster

spell. The wearer can issue telepathic commands to all controlled

creatures in the area or to any single creature or group within

range and line of sight.

No Scaled One with an Intelligence score of 2 or below can

directly  attack  the  wearer,  even  if  attacked  by  the  wearer  or

controlled by another naga crown. Scaled Ones already under

the  wearers  control  cannot  be  affected  by  another  charm  or

compulsion effect, even from another naga crown. A Scaled One

with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher can attack the wearer,

but it takes a 3 morale penalty on attack rolls.

Strong enchantment; CL 15th; Weight .

Naja  Fountain:  The  Naja  Fountain  lies  in  the  depths  of

Ssthartissssun in the Shrine of Cowled Serpents, near the main

altar  to  Ssharstrune.  Its  large  pool  is  encircled  by  the  carved

statue of an amphisbaena with both pairs of jaws interlocked.

Small  snake  statuettes  rear  up  from  the  heart  of  the  pool,

spitting streams of water into the air. For millennia, the Naja

Fountain was the lair of the ha-naga Terpenzi, but it has lain

untended since the Year of Moor Birds (90 DR).

The effective arcane caster level of anyone who bathes in the

Naja Fountain permanently increases by +3. This bene t can be

gained  only  once  per  creature.  Furthermore,  immersion  in  the

fountains  waters  confers  the  bene ts  of  a  heal  spell  for  every

round of immersion. Finally, any living creature in contact with

the fountains water is immortal and does not age, though these

bene ts are lost if the creature ceases contact with the water. The

water loses all magical powers when removed from the fountain.

Overwhelming  conjuration;  CL  21st;  Weight:  N/A

(immovable).

Yuan-ti Grafts

Yuan-ti grafts are serpentine body parts that can be attached to

the body of another corporeal creature.

Acquiring a Yuan-ti Graft

Since the monstrously powerful Yuan-ti anathemas can create

Yuan-ti grafts quickly, they are the primary users of such magic.

Other Yuan-ti that work closely with humanoid agents or cult-

ists often learn the Graft Yuan-ti Flesh feat so that they can

enhance their minions with grafts.

Added Tail: An added tail extends from the recipients tailbone

rather than replacing its legs, granting it a natural swim speed

equal to one-half its land speed. Like any creature with a natural

swim speed, the grafted creature need not make Swim checks to

move at its swim speed underwater and gains a +8 racial bonus

on Swim checks made to perform some special action or avoid

a hazard. The grafted creature can always chose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if rushed or threatened when swimming, and it

can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight

line. The grafted creature also gains a +4 racial bonus on Balance

checks  and  can  constrict  creatures  one  or  more  size  categories

smaller than itself, dealing 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage plus

1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on a successful grapple check.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Graft Yuan-ti Flesh; Price

6,000 gp.

Poison Fangs: These long, sharp fangs allow the grafted crea-

ture to deliver poison (injury, Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 grafted

creatures character level + grafted creatures Con modi er, ini-

tial and secondary damage 1d6 Con) with a successful bite attack.

A grafted creature that did not previously have a bite attack can

bite only a helpless opponent or a grappled foe (delivering the

poison with a successful grapple check to pin the creature).

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Graft Yuan-ti Flesh; Price

8,000 gp.

Replacement Tail: This graft replaces the recipients legs or

rear limbs. The grafted creatures land speed is reduced by 10

feet,  but  it  can  climb  and  swim  at  one-half  its  original  land

speed. The creature can constrict creatures of its own size cat-

egory or smaller, dealing 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage plus

1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on a successful grapple check.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Graft Yuan-ti Flesh; Price

12,000 gp.

Scaly Skin: This piece of yuan-ti skin improves the grafted

creatures natural armor bonus by +3.

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Graft Yuan-ti Flesh; Price

36,000 gp.

Many  spells  in  common  use  today  were

once  exclusively  associated  with  ser-

pentfolk or scalykind. Examples include

blinding spittlePGtF, greater mage handMoF, greater

magic fang, gutsnakeMoF, mage hand, magic fang,

many  jawsPGtF,  poison,  snakebiteMoF,  and  vipergout PGtF.  The  fol-

lowing spells are still exclusively (or nearly so) associated with

the Scaled Ones.

ABILITY RIP

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Targets: Two living creatures

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  rip  a  supernatural  ability  of  your  choice  away  from  one

creature and transfer it to another. The two creatures must be

within 30 feet of each other and remain conscious throughout

the  casting  of  the  spell.  In  exchange  for  this  new  ability,  the

recipient permanently loses a supernatural ability it already pos-

sesses. If it has none to exchange, it instead loses two class levels

(or 2 Hit Dice if it has no class levels).

Class features cannot be transferred by means of this spell.

The spell fails if used to transfer an ability to a creature that

lacks the proper body parts, size, or other criterion for its use,

or if the target creature has fewer than 2 Hit Dice and no super-

natural abilities to trade. Either subject may negate the transfer

with a successful Fortitude save.

Material Component: A caterpillar in a cocoon.

ERUPT

Transmutation [Fire]

Level: Cleric 9

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Touch

Area: Burst with a radius of 100 ft./level

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You draw molten lava up through the ground. Every creature

within the area that fails a Fortitude saving throw takes 10

points of  re damage per caster level and catches on  re (see

Catching on Fire, page 303 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Furthermore,  anyone  wearing  metal  armor  who  fails  the

saving throw is also affected as though by a heat metal spell.

A successful saving throw negates the heat metal effect and

halves  the  damage.  Structures  and  unattended  objects  auto-

matically  take  full  damage  (no  save).  Erupt  leaves  its  entire

area a blackened ruin incapable of supporting plant or animal

life for a full year.

FANG TRAP

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, DF/M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

SPELLS

While casting this spell, you physically trace the area or handle

the object to be trapped. A fang trap functions like a glyph of

warding, except that it cant be made to activate on the basis

of  faith  or  alignment,  and  you  cant  be  caught  in  your  own

fang trap.

A fang trap is usually cast on a speci c spot, such as a door-

way  or  an  area  of   oor.  It  can  be  set  to  distinguish  between

humans and Scaled Ones, or between beings wearing particular

items and those who are not. The trigger cant be a symbol, but

it may be one or more speci c items (for example, six metal

rings on digits, no more and no less).

When a fang trap discharges, the subject is held immobile for

1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw frees the subject

after that period without further effect. A failed save means the

subject takes 1d4 points of piercing and bludgeoning damage per

caster level from the bite of a pair of unseen jaws.

Material Component: A fang from any snake.

HANDFANG

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

You create a fanged, biting mouth in the palm of your hand.

When you lay your hand upon a creature by making a touch

attack, the mouth deals 1d8 points of damage.

If you scored a crtical hit with your touch attack, you may

start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of

opportunity. If you establish a hold, the fanged mouth sinks its

teeth into the targets  esh and continues to bite for an addi-

tional 1d6 points of damage each round until the hold is broken

or the spell ends.

LAOGZEDS BREATH

Level: Cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: Cone

Duration: Instantaneous

As stinking cloud, except that the nauseating vapors persist for

10 rounds.

LAVA MISSILE

Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]

Level: Cleric 2, druid 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Targets: Up to  ve creatures, no two of which can be more than

15 ft. apart.

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: No

A missile of lava darts forth from your  ngertip and strikes its

target,  dealing  1d4  points  of   re  damage.  The  missile  strikes

unerringly if the target has less than total cover or concealment.

Speci c parts of a creature cant be singled out. A target that

fails its saving throw catches on  re (see Catching on Fire in the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

For  every  two  caster  levels,  you  gain  an  additional  mis-

siletwo  at  4th  level,  three  at  6th  level,  four  at  8th  level,

and the maximum of  ve at 10th level or higher. If you shoot

multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or

several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature.

You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance

or roll damage.

A lava missile cures  renewts of 1d4 points of damage. This

spell was  rst used by  renewt clerics of Kossuth.

LAVA SPLASH

Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]

Level: Cleric 5, druid 4

Components: V, S, DF, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: Cylinder (20-foot radius, 20 feet high)

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: No

This spell creates a wave of lava that rises up and showers the

designated area. Each creature in the area takes 1d4 points of

 re damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

Lava  splash  acts  as  a  cure  moderate  wounds  spell  to   re-

newts. This spell was  rst used by  renewt clerics of Kossuth.

Focus: A  st-sized lump of volcanic rock.

holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on

the strength of the quarrys odor, the number of creatures, and

the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the

DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for

the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of

surface conditions and poor  visibility.

Arcane  material  Components:  A  sprinkle  of  mustard  and

pepper, and a drop of sweat.

Your scales become razor-sharp. While this spell is in effect, you

deal lethal instead of nonlethal damage when grappling.

If are not a Scaled One, this spell automatically fails.

Material Component: A thin-bladed

razor.

SCENT

Transmutation

Level:  Druid  2,  ranger  2,  sorcerer/

wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  give  the  target  an  enhanced  sense  of  smell,

equivalent  to  the  scent  ability  of  some  mon-

sters.  This  ability  allows  the  creature  to  detect

approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by

sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify

familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of

smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet;

if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or

rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above.

Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench,

can be detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location is not re-

vealedonly its presence somewhere within range. The creature

can take a partial action to note the direction of the scent. If

it moves within 5 feet of the source, the creature can pinpoint

that source.

A creature with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell,

making  a  Wisdom  check  to   nd  or  follow  a  track.  The  typi-

cal DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface

SERPENT ARROW

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: Up to eight wooden projectiles,

all of which must be in contact with each

other at the time of casting

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You imbue wooden arrows or darts

with  the  potential  to  turn  into

Tiny  vipers  (see  the  Snake

entry, page 280 of the Monster

Manual  for  statistics).  These

missiles remain rigid and harm-

less  until   red  or  hurled.  They

need not be used by the caster.

Serpent arrow

If a serpent arrow hits, the snake

automatically bites the target creature,

dealing 1 point of damage plus poison

(injury,  Fortitude  DC  11,  initial  and

secondary damage 1d6 Con). The missile remains in snake form

for the remaining duration of the spell, attacking their original

opponents to the best of their ability, continuing to bite it even if

the target dies. If the serpent arrow misses its target or the des-

ignated opponent moves outside of the snakes ability to attack

(such  as  via   ying  or  teleportation),  the  creature  attacks  the

nearest opponent. If you can communicate with the viper, you

can direct it to attack particular enemies. When the duration

of the spell expires, any focus that became a viper melts away,

leaving nothing behind. Focuses that did not turn into serpent

arrows retain their natural form.

Material Component: A scale from any sort of snake.

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates (harmless)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You temporarily remove one extraordinary or supernatural abil-

ity of your choice from the target creature. This spell does not

work on constructs, oozes, or undead.

Material Component: A pinch of ash.

VENOM BOLT

Evocation [Acid]

Level: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 100 ft.

Area: 100-ft. line

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half, Fortitude partial (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

You release a beam of fell energy from your eye, mouth,  nger-

tip, or tail tip that travels in a straight line. Every creature in

its path takes 2d8 points of acid damage, though the beam is not

actually composed of any acidic substance. A successful Re ex

save halves this damage.

Furthermore, every creature in the path of the venom bolt

must also make a successful Fortitude save or be paralyzed for

1d4+1 rounds. Success means the subject is slowed for 1 round.

Creatures  do  not  block  the  beam,  but  walls  and  other  solid

barriers do.

Yuan-ti and their creations (such as tainted ones and brood-

guards) are immune to the effects of this spell, as are creatures

with  the  Snake  Blood  feat  (see  Feats  in  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign  Setting).  Other  Scaled  Ones  are  immune  to  the

paralysis effect and need not save against it.

Material  Component:  A  drop  of  venom  from  any  sort  of

poisonous snake.

You  cause  the  subjects  venom  to  become  caustic,  dealing  an

additional 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level with each

use. This spell has no effect on creatures that do not naturally

produce poison.

Material Component: A drop of acid.

WHIRL OF FANGS

Evocation [Force]

Level: Cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Wall or plane of darting jaws up to 20 ft. long/level, or a

ringed wall of whirling jaws with a radius up to 5 ft./2 levels;

either form 20 ft. high

Duration: 1 min./level (D)

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create an immobile curtain of snapping, serpent-fanged jaws

shaped of pure force. You can choose to orient this barrier at any

angle from vertical to horizontal at the time of casting. The force

jaws race to bite at any creature other than you that comes into

contact with them. Any creature passing through the curtain takes

12d4 points of damage, with a Re ex save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are,

each  creature  takes  damage  as  if  passing  through  the  curtain.

Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of

its choice, where feasible) and thus take no damage by making a

successful Re ex save. A successful Re ex save means the creature

has reached either side of the wall without taking any damage.

A creature inside a whirl of fangs takes 2d4 points of damage

(Re ex save for half) on its turn each round that it remains in

contact with the effect. You can move through or remain within

your own whirl of fangs without taking damage. Accordingly,

many Yuan-ti spellcasters wear this spell as a sort of immobile

cloak when  ghting formidable foes.

Scaled Ones have access to a number of prestige classes

that take advantage of their unique abilities. The fol-

lowing prestige classes are speci c to certain races of

Scaled Ones, or to those who hunt such creatures.

Ancient Master

Most Yuan-ti grow forgetful and sleepy as they age, but a few

of the most powerful and strongest-willed abominations grow

mightier of mind while their bodies are failing. They acquire

additional  psionic  powers  and  gradually  become  recognized  as

the ancient masters of the race. Some become

religious  zealots,  founding  new  temples  or

taking  over  existing  ones  and  fanati-

cally  furthering  whatever  aims  Sseth

shows  them  in  dream-visions.  Others

withdraw  from  Yuan-ti  tribal  politics

and  then  society  as  a  whole  to  live

in  isolated  seclusion,  much  the  way

many  study-obsessed  human  wizards

do.  Like  human  mages,  such  Yuan-ti

typically  build  or  take  over  fortresses  in

which to carry out their business.

These ancient masters often engage in

truly ambitious breeding experiments, or

take up strange hobbies with astonishing

vigor and enthusiasm. One tale tells of an

ancient master who crafted full-sized,

blown-glass  replicas  of  attractive

humans. Another describes one who

stole all the tomes from Candlekeep,

translated  them  into  other  tongues,

and then covertly returned them.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become an ancient master, a character must ful ll

all of the following criteria.

Race: Yuan-ti.

Alignment: Any evil (usually chaotic evil).

Base Attack Bonus: +9.

Skills:  Concentration  15  ranks,  Knowledge  (arcana)  10

ranks.

Special:  Access  to  an  extensive  magical

library, a tutor of any race who possesses

at least fourteen sorcerer or wizard class

levels,  or  any  psionic  powers  or  psionic

class levels.

Class Skills

The  ancient  masters  class  skills  (and

the  key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Ap-

praise (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft

(any) (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowl-

edge (all skills taken individually) (Int),

Speak  Language,  and  Spellcraft  (Int).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level:  4  +  Int

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Ancient  masters  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield.

Attraction  (Sp):  An  ancient  master  can  plant  a  compelling

attraction in the mind of any subject within 25 feet of her. The at-

traction can be toward a particular person, object, action, or event.

The target takes all reasonable steps to get close to the person,

 nd the object, attend the event, or perform the action designated,

though it does not suffer from blind obsession and does not take

extreme risks to do so. The subject can recognize danger but does

not  ee unless the threat is immediate. If the ancient master speci-

 es herself as the object of the attraction, she cannot command

the subject indiscriminately, though the subject does listen to her

(even if it disagrees). This ability grants the ancient master a +4

bonus on Charisma checks made to in uence the subject for the

duration of the effect. Attraction lasts for 1 hour. This ability is

usable once per day at 1st level and an additional once per day

every three ancient master levels thereafter (twice per day at 4th

level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at

10th level). This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

Conceal Thoughts (Sp): At 2nd level, an ancient master can

protect her own thoughts (but not those of any other creature)

from analysis. She gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against

divination effects that reveal emotions or thoughts and a +20

circumstance  bonus  on  Bluff  checks  made  to  oppose  Sense

Motive checks. This ability is always active.

Body Equilibrium (Ex): A 3rd-level or higher ancient master

can adjust her body density to match that of any solid or liquid

she stands on. Thus, she can walk on water, quicksand, or even a

spiders web without sinking or breaking through. (This ability

does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs.) She

can move at her normal speed, but she cannot run on an un rm

surface without sinking or breaking through. If she falls while

using this ability, damage from the impact is halved. This ability

is usable at will.

Levitate (Sp): Upon reaching 4th level, an ancient master

can use levitate (caster level equals ancient master level) once

per day. She gains one additional use per day of this ability at

7th level and another at 10th level.

Dimension Door (Sp): At 5th level, an ancient master can

use  dimension  door  (caster  level  equals  ancient  master  level)

once per day. She gains one additional use per day of this ability

at 8th level.

Shadow Concealment (Su): At 6th level, an ancient master

gains the ability to take on shadow form for 1 minute per an-

cient master level. While in this state, she becomes incorporeal,

appearing as a shadowy image of herself. She gains a +10 circum-

stance bonus on Hide checks while this ability is in effect. The

ancient master gains one additional use per day of this ability at

9th level.

Baleful Teleport (Sp): At 7th level, an ancient master can

disperse miniscule portions of a target creature or object weigh-

ing no more than 300 pounds. The target takes 9d6 points of

damage from this attack. A successful Will save (DC 10 + an-

cient master level + ancient masters Cha modi er) halves the

damage. A target under a dimensional anchor effect is immune

to baleful teleport. This ability is usable once per day at 7th level

and twice per day at 10th level. This ability is the equivalent of

a 5th-level spell.

Claws of the Vampire (Sp): When an ancient master reaches

8th level, she can cause the  ngers on both her hands (if she

has any) to grow to wicked, 2-inch-long points. She gains a claw

attack (base damage 1d8 points) that does not provoke an attack

of opportunity. Whenever she uses this attack, she heals one-

half the base damage that she deals with claws of the vampire.

She can use this ability in conjunction with feats, abilities, or

spells that allow additional attacks in the same round. This effect

lasts for 1 hour per ancient master level and can be used once

per day. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Mind Probe (Sp): Once per day, a 9th-level or higher ancient

master can read the thoughts of any one living creature within

30 feet that fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ancient master level

+ ancient masters Cha modi er). All the targets memories and

knowledge are accessible to her, from memories deep below the

surface to those easily called to mind. She can learn the answer to

one question per round, to the best of the targets knowledge. She

can also probe a sleeping target, though it may make a Will save

(DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient masters Cha modi er) to

wake after each question. Targets that do not wish to be probed

can attempt to move beyond the abilitys range unless somehow

hindered.  The  ancient  master  poses  the  questions  telepathically

and the answers are imparted directly to her mind. She and the

target do not need to speak the same language, though less intel-

ligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in

answer to her questions. Creatures protected by mind blank are

immune to this ability. Mind probe lasts for 1 minute per ancient

master level. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.

Disintegrate  (Sp):  A  10th-level  ancient  master  can  use

disintegrate (caster level 10th) once per day.

Coiled Cabalist

Standing  apart  from  the  priests  of  Sseth

but careful never to draw their collective

ire  by  openly  opposing  them,  the  mem-

bers of the Coiled Cabal pursue the arcane

arts  largely  in  secrecy.  The  creed  of  this

shadowy organization holds that true power

can be obtained through mastery of magic that

has nothing to do with gods. After all, magic has

worked well as a weapon for the puny humans, so

theres no reason that it shouldnt also be part of

the vrael olo arsenal.

Cabalists  work  in  oumkathusssmall

groups of no more than a dozen individuals.

Each  oumkathuss  reports  to  up  to  three

overhoods,  who  in  turn  report  to  high-

er-ranking  overhoods  within  a  hidden

hierarchy.  Rank  in  the  Coiled  Cabal  is

not closely tied to level or magical mas-

tery, but it is linked to achievements. A

typical  member  is  a  sorcerer  or

wizard with enough experience

and prestige to have attracted

half a dozen apprentices.

spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class

that granted access to 3rd-level spells before he became a coiled

cabalist,  he  must  decide  to  which  class  he  adds  each  level  of

coiled cabalist for the purpose of determining spells per day and

spells known.

Handfang (Sp): At 1st level, a coiled cabalist can use hand-

fang (caster level equals arcane caster level; see Spells in Chapter

11) once per day. The Fortitude save DC for the poison is 10 +

coiled cabalist level + coiled cabalists Cha modi er.

As he advances in the prestige class, the coiled cabalist can

cal  knowledge  to  produce  other  effects  instead  of  poison,

according to the table above.

Spell Turning (Sp): Three times per day, a

2nd-level  coiled  cabalist  can  produce  an  effect

identical  to  that  of  the  spell  turning  spell

(caster  level  equals  character  level),  except

that he can turn back only 1d4 spell levels

per round. The number of spell levels he can

turn  back  per  round  increases  to  1d4+2  at

6th level and to 1d4+4 at 10th level.

Fang of Sseth

The Vipers Fangs is a secretive order of spies

that  operates  throughout  Faern  on  behalf  of

the  yuan-ti.  Its  membership  is  largely  made  up

of humans and yuan-ti pureblood thieves, assassins,

and thugs. Members refer to each other as Vipers and

follow a fraternal code thats been known to override

the orders of powerful Yuan-ti priests, coiled cabalists, and

tribal leaders. The code is a simple one: Dont harm or steal

from other Vipers.

fang of Sseth gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such

as rogue levels) the bonuses on damage stack. Furthermore, fang

of Sseth levels stack with any other appropriate class levels (such

as rogue or assassin) for the purpose of overcoming improved un-

canny dodge.

Poison Resistance (Ex): Because a fang of Sseth trains with

all sorts of poisons (not just reptile venoms), she becomes increas-

ingly resistant to their effects. A 1st-level fang of Sseth gains a

+1 bonus on saves against all poisons. This bonus increases by +1

for every two additional fang of Sseth levels gained (to +2 at 3rd

level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).

Poison Use (Ex): Fangs of Sseth are trained in the use of

poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when

applying poison to a blade.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, the fang of Sseth gains the Snatch

Arrows feat as a bonus feat if she does not already have it. If she

already has Snatch Arrows, she instead gains Shot on the Run.

If  she  already  has  that  feat,  she  instead  gains  Manyshot.  She

need not meet the prerequisites to gain her bonus feat. A fang of

Sseth who already has all three feats gains no bene t.

Serpent  Shape  (Su):  A  3rd-level  fang  of  Sseth  gains  the

psionic ability to change into a Medium viper at will as a full-

round action. A fang of Sseth who already possesses this ability

(such as a Yuan-ti) instead gains the ability to assume completely

human form. This ability functions like a polymorph spell (caster

level  19th),  except  that  the  fang  of  Sseth  regains  no  lost  hit

points. When in viper form, a fang of Sseth with a poisonous

bite uses either her own venom or that of her viper form, which-

ever is more potent. She can remain in viper form for as long as

she desires and resume her normal form as a full-round action.

Spider Climb (Su): A 5th-level or higher fang of Sseth can

use spider climb (caster level equals fang of Sseth level) at will.

163

Favor of Sseth (Sp): Upon attaining 8th level, the fang of

Sseth receives a visit from Sseth in her dreams, during which

the god bites her. His venom imparts a special giftthe ability

to move about without fear of detection by normal means. This

ability functions like the greater invisibility spell (caster level

equals fang of Sseth level), except that the fang is hidden from

hearing and scent as well. She radiates silence to a radius of 5

feet, does not leave a scent, and cannot be detected by the scent

ability. This effect lasts for 8 hours, though the fang of Sseth

may end it earlier as a free action. This ability is the equivalent

of a 6th-level spell.

Ex-Fangs of Sseth

A fang of Sseth who ceases to be evil, or who betrays Sseth or

the Coiled Cabal loses all special abilities of the prestige class and

may not progress any farther in levels as a fang of Sseth. She

regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for

her violations (see the atonement spell description in the Players

Handbook), as appropriate.

Master of Vipers

Most vrael olo work within their tribes, but a few become loners,

rejecting  the  collective  scheming  and  rising  religious  strife  that

marks yuan-ti tribal life. Some of these individuals embrace hu-

man society, trying to conceal their true natures and dwell among

humans. Others go wild, becoming independent wilderness ex-

plorers and jungle hunters. A rare handful recognize and follow a

deepening af nity for their lesser kinthe venomous snakes. Such

yuan-ti choose to dwell in wild places frequented by such creatures,

such as sunny rock faces riddled with caverns, overgrown jungle ru-

ins, and the like. These outcast yuan-ti eventually learn to hunt not

only to feed themselves, but also to spread destruction far and wide

for the pure pleasure of it. Tales among both yuan-ti and human

adventurers call such individuals masters of vipers.

A master of vipers is always a lone Yuan-ti. He never joins

adventuring parties and travels with nonvipers only to hide from

pursuers or to scout potential prey.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a master of vipers, a character must ful ll

all of the following criteria.

Race: Yuan-ti.

Alignment: Any evil (usually chaotic evil).

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skill: Knowledge (nature) 8 ranks.

Feat: Great Fortitude.

Class Skills

The master of vipers class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),  Disguise  (Cha),  Escape  Artist

an Intelligence score of 3 or higher may attempt a Will save

(DC 10 + master of vipers level + master of viperss Cha modi-

 er) to negate the effect.

Ward  Serpents  (Su):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  a  master  of

vipers can hold serpents at bay. This ability functions like a pro-

tection from evil spell (caster level equals master of vipers level),

except that the de ection and resistance bonuses apply to attacks

from serpents, and summoned serpents cannot touch the master

of vipers. This ability is usable once per day at 3rd level and one

additional time per day for every two master

of  vipers  levels  gained  thereafter  (twice

per day at 5th level, three times per day

at 7th level, and four times per day at

9th level).

Charm  Serpent  (Sp):  At  4th  level,

a  master  of  vipers  can

use  a  limited  form  of

charm animal  (caster

level  equals  master  of

vipers  level)  that  affects

only  serpents.  Any  subject

with an Intelligence score of 3 or

higher  may  attempt  a  Will  save

(DC  10  +  master  of  vipers

level  +  master  of  viperss

Cha modi er) to negate the

effect.  This  ability  is  usable

one additional time per day for

every two master of vipers levels gained

(twice per day at 6th level, three times per day at 8th level, and

four times per day at 10th level).

A master of vipers

Serpent  Dart  (Sp):  At  5th  level,  a  master  of  vipers  can

produce serpentlike darts from his pointing  ngers. This ability

functions like the magic missile spell (caster level equals master

of vipers level), except that the missiles produced are Tiny vipers

that deliver poison (injury, Fortitude DC 10 + master of vipers

level  +  master  of  viperss  Con  modi er,  initial  and  secondary

damage 1d6 Con) in addition to the spells damage. The serpent

darts vanish after striking their targets. This ability is usable

three times per day at 5th level, four times per day at 7th level,

and  ve times per day at 9th level.

Serpent  Reach  (Ex):  Three  times  per  day,  a  5th-level  or

higher master of vipers can transform his wrist into a  exible,

serpentine  form  that  can  expand  2  feet  per  master  of  vipers

level. This effect lasts for 2 rounds per master of vipers level.

This ability enables the master of vipers to deliver touch spells

at a distance and, when combined with handfang, to bite distant

opponents. However, the serpentine wrist lacks the strength to

constrict or entwine a foe. The master of vipers can expand or

retract his wrist as a free action.

Summon Serpents (Sp): At 6th level, a master of vipers can

call any sort of serpent he has previously seen to  ght or work

for  him.  Two  serpents  of  the  same  kind  appear  and  obey  the

characters commands. For each new master of vipers level at-

tained, an additional snake appears (three at 7th level, four at

8th level,  ve at 9th level, and six at 10th level). The summoned

serpents are all the same kind. This ability otherwise functions

like a summon natures ally spell.

Viper  Swarm  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  a  7th-level  or  higher

master of vipers can summon a viper swarm (see Fiend Folio

page 172) that moves as he directs. Use of this ability instantly

ends any ward serpents, charm serpent, or summon serpents abili-

ties that the character may have active.

Great Serpent (Su): At 8th level, a master of vipers gains the

chameleon power and scent abilities of a yuan-ti halfblood if he

did not already have them. Furthermore, his alternate form

ability is no longer limited to the shapes of vipers. He can

now take the form of any Huge or smaller serpent that he

has seen before.

Swarm  Shape  (Su):  When  the  master  of

vipers  reaches  9th  level,  his  alternate  form

ability  expands  to  allow  the  form  of  a  vi-

per swarm (see Fiend Folio page 172).

This  ability  enables  the  master  of

vipers to move through tiny holes

where a foe cannot follow, as well

as attack as a swarm.

Translocate  Serpent  (Sp):

At 10th level, a master of vi-

pers can use a limited form

of  teleportation  either  to

move a Medium or smaller

serpent to a desired location,

or  to  move  himself  to  any

spot  within  5  feet  of  a  ser-

pent or the physical remains

of one. This ability otherwise

functions  like  the  dimension

door spell.

A naga overlord

Naga Overlord

Naga  overlords  are  evil  masterminds  who  operate  in  secret,

usually behind cults of devoted followers. They seek to enslave

lesser races and use them to dominate whole communities. Naga

overlords tend to be extremely vain, power-hungry, and obsessed

with negating any threats to their safety and comfort. Many

even exhibit powerful god complexes.

Most naga overlords are banelar nagas, dark nagas, ha-na-

gas, or spirit nagas, although rare evil representatives of other

naga types are not unknown. Banelar overlords typically have

levels in mystic theurge, while dark nagas, ha-nagas, and spirit

nagas that become naga overlords usually are power-

ful  sorcerers.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a naga overlord, a charac-

ter must ful ll all of the following criteria.

Race: Naga.

Alignment: Any evil.

Skills: Bluff 4 ranks, Diplomacy 4 ranks,

Intimidate  4  ranks,  Sense  Motive  4

ranks.

Feats:  Extend  Spell,  Skill  Focus  (In-

timidate), Spell Focus (enchantment).

Spellcasting:  Able  to  cast  dominate

person as a spell.

Class Skills

The  naga  overlords  class  skills  (and

the key ability for each skill) are Bluff

(Cha),  Concentration  (Con),  Diplomacy

Knowledge  (all  skills  taken  individually)

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Class Features

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  naga  overlord

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Naga  overlords  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new naga overlord level

is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane

spellcasting class he had (or could cast spells as) before he added

the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or

item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for

an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means

that he adds the level of naga overlord to the level of whatever

other arcane spellcasting class he had, then determines spells per

day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class

before he became a naga overlord, he must decide to which class

he adds each level of naga overlord for the purpose of determin-

ing spells per day and spells known.

Enslave (Su): A naga overlord can attempt to enslave any one

living creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Will

save (DC 10 + 1/2 naga overlords character level + naga overlords

Cha modi er) or be affected as though by a dominate person spell

(caster  level  equals  naga  overlords  arcane  caster  level).  An  en-

slaved  creature  obeys  the  naga  overlords  telepathic  commands

until freed by remove curse, and it can attempt a new Will save

every 24 hours to break free. The control is also broken if the naga

overlord dies or travels more than 1 mile from its slave.

This ability is usable once per day at 1st level, twice per day

at 4th level, and three times per day at 7th level.

Augment Followers I (Su): The naga overlord can augment the

abilities of its followers. The following spells automatically function

as if affected by the Extend Spell feat when cast by a 2nd-level or

higher naga overlord: bears endurance, bulls strength, cats grace,

eagles splendor, foxs cunning, mass bears endurance, mass bulls

strength, mass cats grace, mass eagles splendor, mass foxs cunning,

mass owls wisdom, and owls wisdom. These spells do not occupy

higher spell slots or require additional casting time.

Tap Slave (Su): At 3rd level, a naga overlord can leech the

lifeforce of any one enslaved follower within 1 mile as if using

the  vampiric  touch  spell  (caster  level  equals  naga  overlords

arcane caster level), except that he need not actually touch the

target. This ability is usable once per day at 3rd level, twice per

day at 6th level, and three times per day at 9th level.

Augment Followers II (Su): The range of the following spells

automatically becomes close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) when they are

cast by a 5th-level or higher naga overlord: bears endurance, bulls

strength, cats grace, eagles splendor, foxs cunning, mass bears en-

durance, mass bulls strength, mass cats grace, mass eagles splendor,

mass foxs cunning, mass owls wisdom, and owls wisdom.

Augment Followers III (Su): The following spells automati-

cally function as if affected by the Extend Spell feat when cast

by an 8th-level or higher naga overlord: bears endurance, bulls

strength, cats grace, eagles splendor, foxs cunning, mass bears

endurance,  mass  bulls  strength,  mass  cats  grace,  mass  eagles

splendor,  mass  foxs  cunning,  mass  owls  wisdom,  and  owls

wisdom. These spells do not occupy higher spell slots or require

additional casting time.

Enslave  Monster  (Su):  At  10th  level,  a  naga  overlords

enslave  ability  functions  like  dominate  monster  rather  than

dominate person.

Serpent Slayer

Any  intelligent  being  who  learns  what  the  yuan-ti  are  up  to

can be considered a foe of the vrael olo, but some individuals

devote their entire lives to thwarting the serpentfolk. Certain

alert  Harpers  and  Red  Wizards  fall  into  this  category,  as  do

high-ranking priests of human deities who have glimpsed the

true might and nature of the yuan-ti. Such characters view the

Slithering  Ones  as  the  ultimate  doom  of  humankind  if  their

power is not broken soon.

In  recent  decades,  certain  priests  of  Helm  took  vows  to

smash  the  yuan-ti  and  thereby  became  the   rst  true  serpent

slayers. But this path is by no means limited to followers of the

Vigilant Oneor to clerics.

Serpent slayers arent part of a formal organization, but they

do  aid  each  other  whenever  possible.  They  sometimes  scratch

small recognition marks on stone or in dirt to denote the loca-

tion of a cache, hidden route, or suspicious feature. Their sign

PRESTIGE CLASSES

individual can be distinguished only if the serpent slayer has

previously  touched  her.  This  ability  is  usable  twice  per  day  at

4th level, and one additional time per day for every two serpent

slayer levels thereafter (three times per day at 6th level, four

times per day at 8th level, and  ve times per day at 10th level.

Neutralize Poison (Sp): At 5th level, a serpent slayer can use

neutralize poison (caster level equals serpent slayer level) three

times per day.

Ward Serpents (Su): Beginning at 6th level, a serpent slayer

can hold serpents at bay. This abil-

ity functions like a protection from

evil spell (caster level equals serpent

slayer level), except that the de ec-

tion  and  resistance  bonuses  apply

to  attacks  from  serpents,  and  sum-

moned  serpents  cannot  touch  the

serpent  slayer.  This  ability  is  us-

able once per day at 6th level and

one  additional  time  per  day  for  ev-

ery  two  serpent  slayer  levels  gained

thereafter  (twice  per  day  at  8th

level and three times per day at

10th level).

A serpent slayer

Witherscales  (Su):  At  7th

level, a serpent slayer can deal

2d4 points of damage to any

Scaled One with a melee touch

attack.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Serpent slayers gain no

pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check

penalties  for  armor  heavier  than  leather  apply  to  the  skills

Balance,  Climb,  Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,

Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor

check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new serpent slayer level

is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting

class he had before he added the prestige class. He does not, how-

ever, gain any other bene t a character of that class would have

gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin

abilities, and so on), except for an increased effective level

of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the

level of serpent slayer to the level of whatever oth-

er spellcasting class he had, then determines

spells per day, spells known, and caster

level accordingly.

If  a  character  had  more

than  one  spellcasting  class

before  he  became  a  serpent

slayer, he must decide to which

class he adds each level of serpent

slayer for the purpose of determining

spells per day and spells known.

Venomguard (Ex): A serpent slayer gains

a +4 bonus on saving throws against the

venom of all Scaled Ones.

Detect Poison (Sp): At 2nd level, a ser-

pent  slayer

gains the psionic ability to use detect poison (caster level equals

serpent slayer level) at will.

Poison  Immunity  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  serpent  slayer  be-

comes immune to all poisons.

Locate  Serpent  (Sp):  A  4th-level  serpent  slayer  gains  the

ability to sense Scaled Ones nearby. This ability functions like

the locate creature spell (caster level equals serpent slayer lev-

el), except that it detects only Scaled Ones. The serpent slayer

can determine the kind of Scaled One detected, but a speci c

Strike of the Serpent (Sp): Once per day, an 8th-level serpent

slayer can use true strike (caster level equals serpent slayer level)

to augment an attack against any Scaled One. He gains another

daily use of this ability at 10th level.

Smite Serpent (Su): Once per day, a 9th-level or higher ser-

pent slayer can attempt to smite a Scaled One with one normal

melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack

roll and deals one extra point of damage per serpent slayer  level.

If  the  serpent  slayer  accidentally  smites  a  Scaleless  One,  the

smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

The  following  adventures  feature  Scaled  Ones  of

all  sorts.  You  (the  DM)  need  the  D&D  core

rulebooks,  including  the  Players  Handbook,  the

Dungeon Masters Guide, the Monster Manual, and the Fiend

Folio. As always, feel free to adapt the material presented here as

you see  t to make it work with your campaign.

To get started, read through the scenario you wish to use at

least once to familiarize yourself with the situation, NPCs, and

challenges. Make adjustments as necessary to  t the storyline

into your campaign.

Black Viper Altar

Although many humans think of a Yuan-ti temple as a snake-

festooned, ruined city hidden deep in some remote jungle, most

vrael olo actually worship in much smaller places. The temple

site presented here is little more than a concealed altar. Many

similar places of worship can be found in the cellars and sewers

of human cities, forest clearings, and other sites where Yuan-ti

conceal their presence.

Background

The Black Viper Altar lies beneath the overgrown, long aban-

doned ruins of a human town in a jungle area. Beneath the stone

foundations that once supported homes is a spiral tunnel that

leads to a central altar chamber.

Lizardfolk guard the temple against intruders, reset its traps,

maintain the trails leading to the ruins, and keep the area clear

of all jungle creatures except snakes. The lizardfolk withdraw

into their lair (area 3) if intruders approach by day, but they

emerge at night to make stealthy attacks on those who camp

and sleep in the ruins.

This adventure is suitable for 6th-level characters.

1. Broken Hall

At the center of the ruins lies its largest chamber.

Stone pillars support the vine-choked fragments of what

was once a vaulted roof covering this vast chamber. Rubble

and jungle plants litter the cracked paving that forms its

 oor, but something seems to have kept certain areas clear

of the spreading vines that sprawl and entwine everywhere

else. Ten broad stone steps descend from one clear area to a

wall where three closed stone doors stand in a row.

The staircase is 70 feet wide, and the descent is 20 feet. Each of

the doors in the stone wall is 10 feet high and 10 feet wide, hinged

on the left, with a pull-ring mounted on the right-hand edge.

Stone Doors (3): 4 in. thick, hardness 8, hp 60, break DC 28.

1A. RIGHT AND CENTER TUNNELS (EL 6)

The center door and the one on the right both open into long,

dark, tunnels.

Thick cobwebs beaded with moisture cover the walls of this

dark, stone-lined tunnel. Here and there, encrustations of

creeping mold are visible, and the shriveled bodies of spi-

ders, each the size of a human hand, litter the  oor.

Each  10-foot-by-10-foot  tunnel  extends  60  feet  straight  back

and slightly downward. Then it curves 180 degrees (the center

tunnel to the left and the rightmost one to the right) within the

second 60 feet of its length and starts a steep descent. Both then

remain straight and level for another 40 feet before ending in

rockfalls that choke them off entirely. No amount of digging

can uncover any feature of the treasure chambers into which

they once led.

168

620_96566_SerpentKi168-192.indd   168

5/13/04, 7:56:12 AM

ADVENTURES

The only creatures still inhabiting these tunnels are harmless

spiders no larger than a human  ngernail.

Traps:  The  corridor  walls  are  lined  with  2-inch-diameter

holes, one every 10 feet, at varying heights off the  oor (six-

teen  per  tunnel).  These  openings  are  hidden  by  cobwebs  and

dangling threads of mold that, if burned, shrivels and gives off

wall-clinging, concealing smoke. Whenever a creature in contact

with the  oor moves past one, a poisoned arrow springs forth.

Each  of  these  holes  contains  a  spring  mechanism  that  resets

with a distinct click when an arrow is thrust into it.

Poisoned Arrow Traps: CR 1; mechanical; location trigger;

manual reset; Atk +12 ranged (1d6 plus poison, arrow); poison

(Huge viper venom, DC 14 Fort save resists, 1d6 Con/1d6 Con);

Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 20. Market Price: 1,600 gp.

At the end of each tunnel, the yuan-ti have placed an ad-

ditional  trap.  An  unlocked  treasure  chest   res  eight  poisoned

arrows in a cone-shaped arrangement when opened.

Poisoned  Arrow  Chest  Trap:  CR  5;  mechanical;  location

trigger; manual reset; Atk +12 ranged (8d6 plus poison, arrow);

multiple targets (all within 10 ft. of chest); poison (Huge viper

venom, DC 14 Fort save resists, 1d6 Con/1d6 Con); Search DC

21; Disable Device DC 20. Market Price: 8,000 gp.

Treasure:  Each  chest  contains  four  stone  pendants  carved

with wriggling serpents, but these are merely adornments with

no powers. The lizardfolk and yuan-ti do not hesitate to attack

anyone  wearing  or  displaying  one,  since  they  know  the  items

come from a trap.

1B. LEFT TUNNEL

The leftmost door opens into a long, dark, stone-lined tunnel

that is similar at  rst glance to the other two, though it is

cleaner.  Read  or  paraphrase  the  following  aloud  when  the

characters look inside.

The door on the left opens into a dark, stone-lined tunnel

that immediately turns sharply left. The walls are smooth

and well maintained.

This  10-foot-by-10-foot  passage  is  free  of  cobwebs  and  mold.

After the turn, it becomes a steep stone staircase that descends

70 feet. Read or paraphrase the following aloud if the PCs de-

scend the stairs.

The staircase ends in a 10-foot-square, empty stone room

with  a  single  closed  stone  door  (8  feet  wide  and  12  feet

high) directly ahead. The wriggling outline of a snake in

a caduceus pose has been skillfully scratched into the door.

The walls and  oor are clean.

Both  side  walls  of  this  chamber  can  be  swung  out  like  huge

doors  to  reveal  other  areas  if  certain  combinations  of  widely

separated  stones  are  depressed  simultaneously  (Search  DC  30

to discover the unlatching combinations). The wall on the left

opens into the lizardfolk lair in area 3, and the one on the right

Ledge groove

begins.

ADVENTURES

allows entry to a rough- oored, spiral tunnel that descends to

the temple proper (area 4 and beyond).

2. The Serpent Door (EL 6)

The serpent-marked door is an elaborate trap. Opening it reveals

a shallow niche that leads nowhere.

Trap: When the door opens, ten poisoned arrows spring forth

from a metal frame. Five of them are aimed up the stairs, three

 re straight ahead, and the remaining two are angled to either

side of the chamber. The trap  res once, after which the lizard-

folk must restock it with arrows and reset it by closing the door.

The arrow- ring mechanisms can be removed with a successful

DC 20 Disable Device check, but failure causes the entire metal

frame to topple over onto anyone in front of the door, dealing

1d4+3 points of damage. A successful DC 20 Re ex save allows

a character to jump clear and avoid the damage.

Poisoned Arrow Door Trap: CR 6; mechanical; location trig-

ger; manual reset; Atk +12 ranged (10d6 plus poison, arrow),

poison (Huge viper venom, DC 14 Fort save resists, 1d6 Con/

1d6 Con); Search DC 21; Disable Device DC 20. Market Price:

9,600 gp.

3. Lizardfolk Lair (EL 6)

The lizardfolk guards spend their time here when they are not

out hunting for food, patrolling and tending temple areas, or

standing guard in the ruins. Read or paraphrase the following

when the characters enter.

Piles of gnawed bones from a variety of creatures (includ-

ing humans) are placed at intervals along the walls. Nine

human  skulls  hang  upside  down  from  the  wall  at  widely

separated locations. Numerous arrows, carefully placed with

their tips against the wall, occupy one corner.

Sixty-eight  arrows,  all  poisoned,  lean  against  the  wall.  These

serve as ammunition for the various traps in the complex.

Creatures:  Nine  lizardfolk  are  resting  here  when  the

PCs arrive.

Lizardfolk  (9):  hp  11,  12,  12,  13,  13,  13,  14,  14,  15;  see

Monster Manual page 169.

Tactics: The lizardfolk attack the intruders on sight. If it ap-

pears that the PCs are winning, three of the lizardfolk attempt

to win their way past the intruders and warn the yuan-ti.

Treasure: The nine skulls on the wall serve as bowls to hold

each lizardfolks share of the coins gleaned from previous vic-

tims. Each skull contains 14 gp, 6 sp, and either 17 cp or 16 cp.

(The spoils thus far havent quite worked out evenly.)

4. Tunnel Trap (EL 4)

A  trap  set  into  this  curving  tunnel  discourages  unauthorized

visitors to the temple.

About 40 feet along the steadily descending tunnel, shallow

grooves begin in the walls at  oor level and slowly climb

until  they  form  2-inch-deep  ledges  about  5  feet  high  on

both walls.

The ledges are bare and empty, except for a few human  nger

bones (marked with little holes so they can be used as dice) in a

little heap on the left-side ledge, about 60 feet from the point

where the grooves began (Spot DC 15). At the spot marked 4 on

the map, a coiled serpent has been deeply carved into the rough,

 ssured stone  oor.

Trap: Approximately 20 feet beyond the coiled-serpent carv-

ing  is  a  trapdoor  that  conceals  a  pit.  A  10-foot-long  section

of  the  tunnel   oor  covering  the  entire  width  of  the  passage

collapses  as  soon  as  any  Small  or  larger  creature  steps  on  it.

The  trap  has  a  hidden  switch  bypass  that  allows  safe  passage.

Depressing a thumb-sized stone set into the ledge on the left

tunnel wall beside the coiled-serpent carving deactivates the trap

for 1 minute. Thereafter, it resets itself.

Trapdoor Pit: CR 4; mechanical; location trigger; automatic

reset; hidden switch bypass (Search DC 30); DC 24 Re ex save

avoids; 30 ft. deep (3d6, fall); Search DC 28; Disable Device DC

26. Market Price: 23,600 gp.

Development:  Close  examination  (Search  DC  14)  of  the

carving  reveals  that  its  eyes  can  be  depressed  slightly.  Doing

so releases a catch, causing the entire carving to pop up like a

poorly seated lid. Opening this hinged piece of stone reveals a

1-foot-deep, 2-foot-diameter circular storage niche in the  oor.

The niche is empty.

5. The Altar Chamber

(EL Variable)

The  altar  chamber  was  once  a  storage  cellar,  but  the

yuan-ti  have  made  several  upgrades  to  render  it  suitable  for

their  purposes.

The curving tunnel  nally ends in a large room carved

out  of  bedrock.  Directly  in  front  of  the  tunnel  mouth,

about  5  feet  into  the  room,  stands  a  gigantic  statue  of

a  serpent  carved  from  glossy  black  stone.  Its  coils  are

wrapped in rings behind it, and dozens of smaller serpents

with gaping mouths sprout from its scales. Among them

rises a single pair of humanlike arms, their hands raised

high with palms out.

The center of the chamber is dominated by a huge, cir-

cular disc of dark stone with a shallow bowl carved into its

top. Scores of snakes intertwined in a random pattern are

carved all around its sides. On the ceiling of the chamber,

directly  above  the  disc,  is  a  relief-carved  boss  depicting

many  intertwined,  coiling  snakes.  A  pile  of  stone  rubble

occupies  the  center  of  the  wall  directly  across  from  the

entrance tunnel.

170

620_96566_SerpentKi168-192.indd   170

5/13/04, 7:56:25 AM

ADVENTURES

The altar chamber is 50 feet square and 20 feet high, and the

tunnel opens into the central 10 feet of one wall. The pile of

stone rubble marks the location of the human access tunnel that

once led down to this cellar.

Trap: The entire statue is coated with malyss root paste, a

strong contact poison.

Poisoned Statue: CR 3; mechanical; touch trigger (attached);

manual reset; poison (malyss root paste, DC 16 Fortitude save

resists,  1  Dex/2d4  Dex);  Search  DC  22;  Disable  Device  20.

Market Price: 4,400 gp.

Development:  The  humanlike  hands  of  the  statue  are  16

feet off the  oor and positioned as though to hold small items,

but they are empty. The coils of the statue conceal an unlocked

door that opens to reveal a small storage niche. Inside are sixteen

human skulls (relics of memorable sacri ces).

CEILING BOSS

Examination  of  the  ceiling  boss  (Search  DC  10)  reveals  that

most of it is covered with a  ne layer of soot, probably from

altar  res. The only portions of the boss that remain clean are

several carved snake bodies that arch down to form handles of a

sort. Numerous small holes artfully concealed within the design

can also be seen.

Anyone  grasping  the  handles  can  rotate  the  boss  counter-

clockwise, though it moves slowly and with considerable creaking.

This motion releases a catch that allows the boss to swing down-

ward on stone hinges. A counterweight block, positioned above

the boss to prevent it from falling down the circular hole, moves

with  in  tandem  with  it  by  virtue  of  six  smooth-carved,  oiled

stone spheres that serve as wheels. Moving the boss arouses the

vipers that are resting atop the counterweight block (see Crea-

tures, below).

Creatures:  Eight  Small  vipers  rest  atop  the  counterweight

behind the ceiling boss.

Small  Vipers  (8):  hp  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4;  see  Monster

Manual page 200.

Tactics: The vipers thrust their heads out of the concealed

holes to strike at anyone within reach.

Treasure: When the boss swings down, it reveals a circular

hole in the ceiling that offers access to a storage chamber above,

where the counterweight block turns. The DMs choice of temple

treasure may be found here. Alternatively, the temple complex

may be expanded with additional chambers, tunnels, and foes.

BLACK VIPER ALTAR

The stone disc in the middle of the room is an altar to Sseth.

The Black Viper Altar stands 4 feet high and measures 12 feet

in diameter. Several circular depressions are carved around the

6-inch-wide lip of the bowl, and in one of these is a heap of six-

teen glossy red stones. Though they resemble gemstones, they are

merely pieces of red glass bearing a spell. Disturbing any one of

the stones causes it to vanish and be replaced by a Huge viper

that appears within 20 feet of it. If the entire heap of stones is

swept into a sack, all sixteen snakes appear simultaneously, some

positioned so as to block access to the tunnel mouth.

Creatures:  There  are  no  creatures  present  when  the  PCs

arrive, but their actions may summon sixteen Huge vipers.

Huge Vipers (16): hp 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 33, 36, 36,

36, 36, 36, 38, 44, 50; see Monster Manual page 200.

Tactics: Each viper immediately moves to attack the creature

that disturbed its stone. If that individual dies or moves beyond

reach,  the  snake  attacks  any  other  non-Yuan-ti  in  the  altar

room.

Concluding the Adventure

Once the PCs overpower the resident lizardfolk and locate the

treasure behind the ceiling boss, the complex contains nothing

else of interest. If they desecrate or destroy the altar, they may

be  rewarded  by  their  own  churches  (if  appropriate),  but  they

will certainly draw the ire of the yuan-ti, who will go to great

lengths to hunt them down and destroy or enslave them.

Adderposts

In the town of Essembra in northern Battledale, just a few hun-

dred feet south of the central Battle Court (marshaling ground),

stands the infamous junk and pawnshop known as Adderposts.

Named for its odd, serpentine-carved, spiraling door pillars, this

notorious  shop  nominally  deals  in  secondhand  goods,  though

its proprietor makes most of his money by serving as the local

fence for stolen property. Customers come to Adderposts from

as far away as northern Sembia to conduct shady transactions

outside  the  purview  of  their  peers  and  to  purchase  mordayn

powder for conversion into the drug known as dreammist (see

Lords of Darkness page 183).

This adventure is suitable for four 13th-level characters.

Background

Millennia  before  the  founding  of  Essembra,  Adderposts  was

the  site  of  a  minor  sarrukh  temple  of  Sssthasiness,  and  the

catacombs beneath it still hold several dark relics of that evil

god. After the fall of Myth Drannor, a chance discovery of the

long-buried  sarrukh  ruins  led  to  the  open  establishment  of  a

temple of Sssthasiness in which the long-forgotten deity was

venerated as a totem of venomous creatures, including scorpions,

snakes, spiders, and the like. (In truth, it was Talona, the Lady

of Poison, who backed the beast cult.) The temples motto, The

Serpent Never Sleeps, has since entered the local lexicon of Bat-

tledale, although it has lost its original attribution. This phrase is

now understood to mean the forces of evil never rest.

The  cult  of  Sssthasiness  faded  away  within  a  few  decades

of its establishment. Its former temple, which had come to be

known as Adderposts, was used for a variety of other purposes

in the years that followed, until at last it became the shop it

is today. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Duskar Flame-

haern,  proprietor  of  Adderposts,  chanced  upon  a  secret  door

leading to the catacombs below and began using them to store

the stolen goods he had agreed to fence.

171

620_96566_SerpentKi168-192.indd   171

5/13/04, 8:12:51 AM

ADVENTURES

Three years later, in the Year of the Serpent (1359 DR), a

spirit naga named Ssensariith stumbled through a portal that

Duskar had never found and claimed the catacombs for its own.

Employing a potent mixture of Art, charisma, and narcissism,

the spirit naga convinced Duskar and his family to venerate it

as the divine incarnation of Sssthasiness. Under Ssensariiths

direction, Duskar slowly expanded his illegal activities to include

selling drugs and capturing slaves.

Today, Adderposts is the center of a small but active cult

of Battledarran snake worshipers who control most of the il-

licit activities in Essembra under the direction of Ssensariith.

Although  some  Battledarrans  suspect  that  shady  activities

occur at the pawn and junk shop, none realize the extent of

the cults activities.

Major NPCs

The following NPCs live or work in the area of Adderposts and

may be encountered at various points during this adventure.

DUSKAR FLAMEHAERN

The  proprietor  of  Adderposts  is  a  soft-voiced  human  of  few

words and nocturnal habits. He dwells above the shop with his

three daughters: Esvele, Lhareene, and Rowan. He is present at

the shop for a time each day, but he keeps very late hours for

discreet meetings with unsavory allies. Duskar is a self-taught

disciple  of  Sssthasiness  who  venerates  the  forgotten  deitys

beast  cult  aspect  as  the  Lord  of  Venom.  Regular  patrons  of

Adderposts know that Duskar keeps a loaded hand crossbow at

the ready at all times.

In addition to acting as a local fence, Duskar has established

a  lucrative  arrangement  with  certain  Yuan-ti  slavers  based  in

the Underways of Oeble (see encounter 3, below). Duskar and

his daughters discreetly capture lone travelers passing through

Essembra and other humanoids not likely to be missed and send

them to Oeble via the portal beneath Adderposts. In exchange,

the yuan-ti send him urns of mordayn powder that is made in

the Black Jungles and shipped northward via Lushpool.

Duskar deliberately avoids selling mordayn powder to local

Battledarrans for fear that its presence would draw too much

attention from the local authorities. Instead, he reserves it for

out-of-town patrons who know of its availability. Sembian agents

of the yuan-ti posing as decadent scions of the merchant nobil-

ity frequently recommend that their fellows pay a quick visit to

Adderposts for a bit of mordayn powder. Thereafter, they exploit

the  drugs  effects  and  the  ensuing  addictions  to  extend  their

control of Sembian trade activities.

ESVELE, LHAREENE, AND

ROWAN FLAMEHAERN

Duskars three daughters are tall, thin, beautiful women with

black curly hair that almost sweeps the  oor when they unbind

it. Rumor holds that all three are excellent forgers and limners

who can paint holes, nailheads, and seams where none exist, and

only the closest examination can uncover the deceit. In truth,

all three women have been converted into tainted ones to serve

the yuan-ti, and they are even more ruthless than their father.

The three often lure amorous travelers into situations in which a

bit of drugged wine can lead to easy robbery at best and a quick

introduction to slavery at worst.

Relocating the Adventure

Adderposts can easily be placed in any large town or city

north or east of the Border Kingdoms. The location should

make sense as the  rst stage of a slaving route that leads

into the depths of the Black Jungles and have a ready market

for the drug known as dreammist.

ADVENTURES

Poison Kiss (Ex): While grappling, a daughter of Duskar can

choose to smear her opponent with poisonous saliva instead of

dealing damage. This poison kiss can be used only while grap-

pling a foe with exposed skin. The daughter makes an opposed

grapple check instead of an attack and takes a 4 penalty on the

check. If she wins, she successfully applies the poison (contact,

Fortitude  DC  14,  initial  and  secondary  damage  1d4  Con)  by

kissing, licking, or lightly biting her opponent.

Psionics  (Sp):  3/daypolymorph  (snake  or  snakelike  form

Possessions: +2 leather armor, +1 short sword, dagger, master-

work artisans tools, ring of protection +1, 3 potions of cure light

SSENSARIITH

Hatched near the head of the Naga ow, Ssensariith wandered

south and west upon reaching maturity and eventually settled in

the Border Kingdoms. Several decades ago, it was involved in a

legendary altercation known as the Night of Seven Nagas that

unfolded in the Underways of Oeble. During that battle, Ssen-

sariith survived the concerted attacks of two iridescent nagas by

stumbling through a portal that led to a series of long-buried

catacombs beneath the Battledarran town of Essembra.

Ssensariith spent many years discovering all the secrets of its

new home and establishing itself as a local drug and slave king-

pin in the heart of the Dalelands. Today, it leads a small band

of human and once-human followers in Essembra, who venerate

it as the divine incarnation of Sssthasiness. (In truth, both the

naga and its followers worship a minor aspect of Talona.)

Content to let Duskar Flamehaern lead the day-to-day activi-

ties of the cult, Ssensariith spends most of its time attempting to

develop gems that hatch as though they were eggs to release any

of several magical varieties of serpent. The naga spends the bulk

of the offerings it receives from the cult on rare ingredients for

its research, but so far it has had no success. Should the spirit naga

succeed, however, it would control a new and potentially lucrative

trade item of great interest to serpentfolk throughout Faern.

ADVENTURES

HENDAR SWORDSHATTER LHORGHIN

Hendar  is  a  member  of  the  Lords  Men,  a  small  group  of

men-at-arms based in Essembra and led by War Chancellor

Ilmeth  (LN  male  Chondathan  human   ghter  11).  Hendar

has  long  been  friends  with  Duskar  Flamehaern  and  was

the   rst  convert  to  the  Cult  of  Sssthasiness  outside  the

Flamehaern family.

Hendar ensures that the Lords Men turn a blind eye to the

ongoing illegal activities at Adderposts. In exchange, Duskar en-

riches his friend with a steady stream of coin, which he promptly

loses gambling and wenching.

Adventurers investigating Adderposts are unlikely to encoun-

ter Hendar unless they interrupt an actual worship ceremony.

DHESSA O THE FISH

Dhessa is an aging tavern wench at the Four Flying Fish and, of

late, the sometimes lover of Duskar Flamehaern. Dhessa was the

second convert to the Cult of Sssthasiness outside of Duskars

family.  Although  she  was  initially  reluctant,  she  has  enthusi-

astically embraced the cults teachings in recent weeks. Dhessa

keeps an ear to the ground in the Four Flying Fish, listening for

information of interest to the cult.

Adventurers investigating Adderposts are unlikely to encoun-

ter Dhessa unless they interrupt an actual worship service.

1. Adderposts

This rectangular building is constructed of mortared stone and

has a sloping slate roof. A trio of steps leads up to stout double

doors,  anked by the serpentine-carved, spiraling door pillars for

which the shop is named.

1A. SHOP

This  section  of  Adderposts  was  once  the  main  room  of  the

old temple.

The shop portion of Adderposts consists of a large main

room  heaped  with  assorted  merchandise,  including  a  fas-

cinating  jumble  of  old  masks  and  some  pieces  of  armor

heaped up in huge pails. Four sets of rickety stairs ascend

to  overhead  chambers.  Lamps  dangle  in  profusion  from

bars that can be lowered by means of pulleys, and clothes

hang  on  shoulder  racks  from  every  tread  of  the  various

ascending stairs.

Adderposts  is  the  place  to  come  if  you  need  something  in  a

hurryparticularly  a  disguise  that  involves  a  certain  type  of

armor  or  uniform.  Duskar  stocks  specimens  of  every  sort  of

military garb from the Moonsea and Dragon Reach lands.

Only Duskar can quickly  nd anything in the chaos of his

shop, but he knows where everything is. Browsers who pick up

merchandise, carry it around for a while, and then set it down

elsewhere absolutely enrage him.

Duskar has a unique system for foiling thieves, at least as far

as cash is concerned. He pours the coins that he takes in payment

into one of a dozen or so speaking tubes standing against pillars

here and there around the shop, and these in turn funnel their

contents down to unknown regions below. Change is brought to

customers by one of Duskars daughters. Thus, any coinage in

the shop proper is in the possession of customers.

1B. DUSKARS BEDROOM

Accessible only via a rickety stair leading up the west end of the

north wall, Duskars bedroom contains a large bed and chest,

as well as many items that once belonged to his late wife. The

secretive  proprietor  is  careful  to  store  nothing  incriminating

here. This chamber connects with his daughters rooms via the

topside of the shops uneven plank ceiling.

1C. ESVELES BEDROOM

A rickety stair leads up the east end of the north wall to this

chamber. Esveles bedroom contains a narrow bed and a chest

with a false bottom (Search DC 20).

Treasure: The niche thus concealed hides a small collection

of jewelry (worth a total of 69 gp) that Esvele has stolen from

travelers passing through town.

1D. LHAREENES BEDROOM

Lhareenes bedroom is furnished in a fashion similar to those of

her sisters. It is accessible by the same sort of rickety stairway,

which leads up the west end of the south wall.

Hidden behind the headboard of the bed is a small, leather-

bound tome that serves as Lhareenes diary. In it, she records the

name of every man she seduces, including those that she later

dispatches through the portal to Oeble. PCs who are searching

for  someone  abducted  into  slavery  by  the  cult  may   nd  the

name herein.

1E. ROWANS BEDROOM

Like her sisters chambers, Rowans bedroom contains a bed and

a chest. The rickety staircase that leads up to it is at the east end

of the south wall.

Unbeknownst to her father or sisters, Esvele has become ad-

dicted to dreammist. She hides a small stash of mordayn powder

(2 doses, worth 200 gp each) wrapped in the glossy leaves of

some exotic southern tree beneath her mattress.

1F. KITCHEN

This room was added long after Adderposts was constructed.

It  features  a  large  hearth,  plenty  of  cooking  implements,  a

table  for  food  preparation  and  dining,  several  chairs,  and  a

variety  of  foodstuffs.  The  only  oddity  is  a  cage   lled  with

mice, which re ects the newfound penchant for living rodents

evinced by Duskars daughters since their transformation into

tainted ones.

1G. GARDEROBE

Duskar and his daughters perform their daily ablutions in this

small chamber.

2. Catacombs of Sssthasiness

The catacombs beneath Adderposts once served as the undercroft

and private chapel for the temple above. All the corridors in this

area are fashioned of hewn stone blocks, which have been artfully

set to create an arching roof between 10 and 12 feet high. All the

doors here are strong wooden ones, but none are locked.

2A. NARTHEX (EL 13)

This  small,  10-foot-cube  served  as  the  narthex  for  the

temple. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters

approach.

This small, cubic chamber is built of hewn stone blocks. In

the ceiling is a trapdoor, and an archway in the east wall

leads into darkness. The  oor is tiled with a mosaic depict-

ing  a  swarm  of  scorpions,  snakes,  and  spiders.  Runes  are

carved into the other three walls.

The  trapdoor  in  the  ceiling  leads  into  the  Adderposts  shop

(area 1A), emerging just behind the counter. The archway leads

into the rest of the catacombs. The runes on the walls are in

Draconic, and they read, The Serpent Never Sleeps.

Trap: Anyone standing on the  oor of the narthex triggers a

trap that  lls the room with poisonous gas. Ssensariith and the

cultists are aware of the trap and get past it with a hidden switch

bypass located high up on the north wall, where it is reachable

from either entryway to the narthex. In addition, the spirit naga

usually casts alarm centered on the top of the archway to warn

it when guests (welcome or not) arrive. The spells radius is suf-

 cient to alert the naga to the presence of customers in the store

above as well.

Fortitude  save  resists,  1  Con  drain/3d6  Con);  Search  DC  30;

Disable Device DC 30. Market Price: 21,100 gp.

2B. STOREROOMS (EL 10)

These chambers were once used by the cult of Sssthasiness to

hold temple goods, but Duskar now uses them to hold purloined

goods he intends to fence.

Treasure: At any given time, as much as 800 gp worth of

stolen property is stored in each of these four rooms. However,

such  items  are  usually  bulky  and  hard  to  dispose  of  without

drawing unwanted attention from the local authorities.

Buried  amidst  the  junk  in  the  southeast  room  is  a  small,

trapped  coffer  containing  eight  packets  of  mordayn  powder

(worth 200 gp each).

2C. SSENSARIITHS NEST (EL 15)

Ssensariith dwells in this chamber. Read or paraphrase the fol-

lowing when the PCs enter.

This 20-foot square chamber contains all manner of debris,

arranged in the fashion of a large nest.

The junk on the  oor gives cover to anyone who crouches down

behind it. Moreover, anyone attempting to navigate the room

can do so only at normal speed and must make a Balance check

(DC 5) each round to make progress.

Creature: This nest is home to the spirit naga Ssensariith,

who spends most of its time here experimenting with magical

processes.

Ssensariith: See Major NPCs section, above.

Tactics: If Ssensariith has received warning of the PCs pres-

ence from its alarm spell or by any other means, it prepares

for the encounter by casting detect thoughts, darkness, protection

from energy (  re), and mage armor. Then it hides behind the

debris in the room to gain cover. When the PCs enter, the naga

uses its sleep ability  rst, followed by a suggestion that they turn

around and leave. If these tactics fail to get rid of the intruders,

it uses its charming gaze on one and tries to make that character

defend it. When Ssensariith joins combat, it leads off with magic

missile, then uses cloudkill and its other offensive spells to best

advantage. If forced into melee, the naga uses its poisonous bite.

If Ssensariith is losing the battle, it  ees toward the portal and

tries to escape to Oeble.

Development: If captured, the naga pretends to be just an-

other cultist and tries to convince the PCs to go through the

portal arch (area 2D) after the leader of the cult. It lies about the

key to ensure that the PCs trip the trap if they seem inclined to

leave the naga behind; otherwise it tells the truth and provides

them with the correct key so that they can deliver themselves

to the slavers on the other end.

Treasure: Hidden in and among the detritus are gems worth

500 gp in total, plus eight attuned gems (a gem of alarm, a gem

of Horizikauls boom, a gem of shout, a gem of suggestion, and

three gems of summon swarm.

2D. PORTAL ARCH (EL 7)

The portal to Oeble is an archway  lled in with stone and en-

graved with vaguely serpentine glyphs. This two-way keyed portal

connects the catacombs beneath Adderposts with the Underways

of Oeble (see below). The key required for passage to Oeble is a

stinger  from  a  scorpion  (dead  or  alive).  The  key  required  for

returning to Essembra is a rattlesnake rattle (which Ssensariith

inherently possesses, thanks to its Tail Rattle feat). Both keys

are known only to Ssensariith, who guards its thoughts with its

amulet of mind shielding, although the yuan-ti of Oeble would

dearly like to acquire knowledge of them.

Trap: Attempting to employ the portal from this direction with-

out the proper key triggers a trap that summons a swarm of vipers.

The  summoned  swarm  attacks  any  living  creature  it  encounters

(including Ssensariith and its followers, if they are present).

Summon  Natures  Ally  VI  Trap:  CR  7;  magic  device;

proximity trigger (alarm); automatic reset; spell effect (summon

Disable Device DC 31. Cost: 38,900 gp, 3,112 XP.

Viper Swarm (1): hp 27; see Fiend Folio page 172.

2E. CHAPEL OF SSSTHASINESS (EL 13)

This chamber is the main worship area for the cult.

This round chamber has a slightly concave roof and  oor.

Lifelike depictions of writhing serpents, scuttling spiders,

and   erce-looking  scorpions  have  been  carved  into  the

walls,   oor,  and  ceiling.  In  the  center  of  the  chamber

stands a stone altar carved in the shape of a coiled serpent

with its head tilted back and its jaws opened impossibly wide.

Several misshapen reptilian creatures stand guard to either

side of the altar.

A successful DC 15 Spot check reveals that many of the carved

serpents  seem  to  collectively  assume  a  humanoid  form.  The

serpents mouth forms a wide,  at bowl large enough to hold the

body of a Medium creature, and its throat is a narrow tube that

drains blood from sacri ces. If Sssthasiness (Talona) is pleased

with a sacri ce, the response is typically a swarm of centipedes,

spiders, or vipers that pours forth from the serpents throat into

the bowl. The swarm then acts at the behest of the person who

offered the sacri ce. (See the Book of Vile Darkness for more

details about sacri ces to dark gods.)

Creatures: The altar is guarded by sixteen broodguards. One

of these was once Duskars wife, who is thought to have died

of a wasting disease by most Essembrans. The other was a lone

traveler  recruited  as  a  guinea  pig  to  test  the  distillation  of

ADVENTURES

yuan-ti venom, herbs, and roots supplied by the yuan-ti of Oeble

for creating tainted ones.

If the PCs are searching for an NPC and you want to end

the adventure here, this latter broodguard is that missing NPC.

Otherwise, assume the person they seek was sent on to Oeble as

a slave.

Broodguards (16): hp 26, 26, 25, 25, 24, 24, 23, 23, 22, 22,

22, 20, 20, 19, 19, 19; see Monsters of Faern, page 96.

Treasure: Several dark relics used in dark rituals sit atop the

altar. They include a snakeskin bag containing religious scripture

af xed  to  a  leather  cord  (a  phylactery of faithfulness)  and  an

ebony dagger with a serrated edge (a +1 dagger).

2F. COLLAPSED TUNNEL

This tunnel once continued on to the east, but it has since col-

lapsed. If you want to expand the adventure, this tunnel could

lead  to  heretofore  undiscovered  vaults  which  might  contain

additional  treasures  of  the  cult,  undead  remains  of  the  long-

vanished  cultists,  or  even  the  mummi ed  remains  of  one  or

more sarrukh.

3. Oeble

Oeble-town is located near the center of the Border Kingdoms,

straddling the River Scelptar west of the Qurth Forest. Home

to all manner of rogues, outlaws, and folk unwelcome elsewhere,

the citys multiracial populace includes a Yuan-ti ssrath (lesser

tribe, see Chapter 1) of House Eselema. The serpentfolk dwell in

the Underways of Oeblean ever-growing labyrinth of passage-

ways beneath Oeble-town that is home to most of the monsters

that reside in the city.

Members of the ssrath traf c in slaves, shipping them south

to the Eselemas tribal lands in the southern Black Jungles via

Lushpool. They also deal in mordayn powder, shipping it to agents

across Faern to further the schemes of House  Eselemas.

One source of slaves is the two-way portal linking Essem-

bra (speci cally the catacombs of Adderposts) with Oeble. The

southern terminus of this portal opens in a deserted cul-de-sac

of the Underways near the subterranean tavern known as the

Talondance. The yuan-ti keep a close eye on the portal so that

they can quickly round up any slaves from Essembra.

Inspiration  regarding  Oeble  and  its  resident  Yuan-ti  ssrath

may be found in The Black Bouquet, by Richard Lee Byers.

Sarrukh Ruin

Sarrukh Ruin is a short adventure designed for 7th-level char-

acters that can be placed anywhere within Faern. The season,

time of year, and the weather are irrelevant, since the majority

of the adventure is subterranean.

Background

In their search for living sarrukh, the khaastas have unearthed

dozens of ancient ruins from the old empire. Occasionally, such

efforts have revealed a few living sarrukh, deep in hibernation,

which the khaastas have immediately slain. In most cases, how-

ever, the ruins are simply empty.

Though the khaastas normally try not to interfere with na-

tives  of  Faern,  they  tend  to  be  overzealous  about  defending

sarrukh ruins that have not yet been fully explored. Recently, a

small expeditionary force of khaastas unearthed this location,

and  its  members  are  presently  working  to  unravel  the  secrets

that it holds.

Once a sarrukh outpost, this settlement has long since been

abandoned. Within its ruins, however, are items that are worth

a  fortune  if  salvaged.  Furthermore,  an  immense,  four-sided,

gray obelisk at the center of the settlement is a two-way, keyed

portal  to  any  plane  speci ed  by  the  creature  that  activates  it.

The sarrukh once used this portal as a means of exploring the

multiverse. Such a device could prove invaluable to the khaastas,

making  them  less  reliant  upon  the  charity  of  their  demonic

allies for planar transport.

Adventure Synopsis

The khaastas assume that any creatures in this area, including

Scaleless  Ones,  are  working  with  the  sarrukh  and  have  valu-

able knowledge about their whereabouts. Thus, they attempt to

capture the PCs as soon as they notice the intrusion and torture

information out of them. Should the PCs prove dif cult to cap-

ture, the khaastas have no qualms about killing them instead.

The  party  can  interact  with  the  khaastas  in  a  number  of

ways. They could simply drive the creatures away, acquire the

relics  they  have  unearthed  from  the  sarrukh  settlement,  and

then  deal  with  the  obelisk,  or  they  could  enter  the  ruins  by

stealth,  disable  the  obelisk,  and  return  without  engaging  the

khaastas in combat.

Though the PCs may not realize it, the most important ele-

ment  of  this  adventure  is  keeping  the  khaastas  from  gaining

access to the power of the obelisk. Thus far, the reach of these

aggressive  and  militant  creatures  has  been  largely  limited  by

their inability to access other planes easily. A portal such as this

one that provides access to nearly any plane in the multiverse

would transform them into a major threat. The khaastas realize

the probable function of this device, so more will be sent if this

force  is  slain  or  driven  off.  Destroying  the  obelisk  provides  a

much safer way to contain the threat.

Beginning the Adventure

From  the  surface,  the  ruins  appear  as  nothing  more  than  a

rather large, foliage-covered hill. Originally, this underground

settlement could be reached only via a tunnel leading from a

system of caves that begins a mile away. But a long-ago earth-

quake collapsed a vital tunnel connection, cutting off that access

route. Now only a deep hole recently dug into the top of the

hill by the khaastas provides access to the entrance cavern. The

adventure begins when the PCs discover this hole.

ADVENTURES

THE SETTLEMENT

The PCs should be able to move around freely as long as they

take  care  to  minimize  the  noise  they  make.  Because  khaastas

 ght  amongst  themselves  periodically,  minor  disturbances  do

not immediately alarm the khaasta leader. A signi cant amount

of noise, however, causes him to dispatch four khaastas to inves-

tigate the disturbance.

Because they have been sheltered from looters and the ele-

ments, the structures within the hill have been well preserved.

Most are two-room dwellings made of stone, their outer walls

decorated with carved images of intertwined snakes or upright,

walking serpents. The average house still contains 1d8 works of

art, statues, rugs, or other ornaments of value (DMs choice),

each worth 3d20 gp on the open market, or twice that amount

to anyone interested in antiquities.

1. Entrance (EL 5)

The entrance hole is partially concealed by foliage from anyone

more  than  20  feet  away,  but  the  two  khaasta  guards  can  be

spotted normally.

Two scaly creatures resembling human-sized lizards stand

atop this hill, their eyes scanning the horizon.

Creatures: The two khaastas on guard on the hilltop are assigned

to alert their comrades below to any potential intrusion as well

as to defend the entrance.

Khaastas (2): hp 19, 21; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics:  Unless   rst  silenced,  one  of  the  khaastas  barks  a

warning into the hole, then rushes to attack the party. If out-

numbered, the two are happy to  ght the  rst party members

that approach them.

If one of the khaastas falls in combat, or if they both fall

below  one-half  their  original  hit  points,  or  if  the  battle  lasts

more than 4 rounds, one guard drops a gong into the chamber

below,  alerting  those  within  to  imminent  enemy  penetration.

Should  this  alarm  sound,  the  khaastas  stationed  within  the

ruins move to reinforce the area around the entrance and ready

themselves for combat.

Development: Once the guards have been defeated, the PCs

can enter the ruins. The entry hole is 5 feet in diameter and

extends  15  feet  down  through  the  earth  before  opening  into

a large, dark cavern. The spot marked 1 on the map is the

point on the cavern  oor (200 feet below) that is directly un-

derneath the entrance. Since this spot lies slightly behind the

main portion of the ruins, only the khaastas in areas 2 and 3

are permitted Spot checks to notice the party descending.

2. Large Residence (EL 6)

The khaastas have been using this house as a guardpost to watch

the entrance hole and the nearby tunnel.

This structure appears to be a larger version of the stan-

dard stone residences within these ruins. The exterior of the

building is made of dark-colored stone and decorated with

prominent engravings of snakes and other lizards.

Creatures:  Three  khaastas  stand  guard  outside  this  sarrukh

residence.  Because  the  group  has  been  exploring  this  ruin  for

the  better  part  of  a  week  without  incident,  the  guards  here

have grown lax. Thus, unless the characters draw attention to

themselves in some way, these khaastas detect them only with a

successful DC 20 Spot check.

Khaastas (3): hp 19, 20, 25; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics:  The  guards  are  initially  disorganized  and  simply

attack  the   rst  PCs  they  can  engage.  If  they  survive  more

than 2 rounds, they seek to gain support by withdrawing to the

nearest position controlled by other khaastas.

Development: This structure encompasses more than 3,000

square feet in six large rooms. The valuables have already been

looted and brought to area 5.

3. Fountain (EL 5)

This  plaza  once  served  as  a  public  gathering  place  for  the

sarrukh.

Water trickles from a vaguely humanoid-shaped fountain

encrusted with layer upon layer of rock-hard minerals in

the  center  of  this  stone  plaza.  Stone  benches  and  purple

phosphorescent  clumps  of  fungus  surround  the  fountain

in an artful array. Two bipedal, lizardlike creatures stand

guard over the plaza.

Creatures: The two khaastas stationed here attack anyone ap-

proaching them.

Khaastas (2): hp 20, 22; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics:  If  these  guards  were  not  previously  aware  of  the

party,  they  immediately  withdraw  to  area  5.  If  they  have  al-

ready received warning of imminent invasion, they try to lure

the characters to area 4 by taking a circuitous route that leads

through there and eventually ends up in area 5.

Development:  Despite  the  fact  that  the  sarrukh  have  not

been active here for more than 30,000 years, this fountain con-

tinues to pump water. Mineral deposits have formed a hard crust

over the marble serpent statue, making it impossible to discern

its original form. The pool that the water  ows into has fared

much better than the statue, as have the benches that encircle

the fountain. The water is potable and possesses no magical or

otherwise unusual properties.

Treasure:  The  mineral-covered  statue  is  crafted  of  white

marble. Although it weighs 500 pounds, it would fetch 2,000

gp  on  the  open  market  or  twice  that  amount  from  anyone

interested in antiquities.

ADVENTURES

4. Thiefs Trap (EL 12)

As the dominant creatures in their various kingdoms, the sar-

rukh  gathered  more  treasure  than  most  and  thus  were  often

victims  of  theft.  To  protect  themselves  against  larceny,  they

often set tantalizing traps, such as this one.

This stone-and-mortar building is twice as tall as it is wide.

Some 30 feet above the ground is a section that is open on

all sides, save for the corner columns supporting the roof.

Within this space rests what appears to be an emerald the

size of the average humans head. Rays of light glint from

it in all directions.

The building is 20 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 40 feet tall, built

of  stacked  and  mortared  stones.  Approximately  30  feet  above

the ground is an open area shaded by a sloped roof that is sup-

ported by four thick columns, one in each corner. Within this

open area is a silent image depicting a green gem the size of a

humans head. The ray of light that shines through the gem is

part of the illusion.

Trap: Walls of force springs into existence between each pair of

pillars 1 round after any creature enters the open chamber. A ru-

kanyr is summoned into the area 1d4 rounds later. The walls of force

remain in place until either the invader or the rukanyr is slain.

Wall of Force/Summon Monster VIII Trap: CR 12; magic

device; proximity trigger (alarm); automatic reset; multiple traps

0     25     50 Feet

(six  wall  of  force  traps  and  one  summon  monster  VIII  trap

that summons a rukanyr); spell effect (wall of force, 15th-level

wizard); spell effect (summon monster VIII, 15th-level wizard,

rukanyr); Search DC 34; Disable Device DC 34. Cost 83,500 gp,

6,680 XP.

Note: This trap is really six traps that create walls of force

and a seventh trap that summons a rukanyr in the same area. If

all succeed, the rukanyr appears inside the ring of walls of force.

These effects are independent of each other.

Rukanyr: hp 85; see Fiend Folio page 144.

Tactics:  Regardless  of  the  opponents  it  faces,  the  rukanyr

begins combat with a sundering roar and then concentrates its

initial attacks on any creatures not affected by it. If forced to

choose between targets, it attacks anyone who appears to be a

spellcaster in preference to others.

Development: The chamber is empty aside from the horribly

mutilated bodies of two khaastas that tripped the trap during

their investigation of the site.

5. Loot (EL 7)

The goods already salvaged from many of the sarrukh dwellings

have been piled up here.

A pile of gold and other assorted items stands in this open

area. Four scaly creatures stand guard around the pile.

ADVENTURES

The khaastas keep their treasure far from the command post

to  limit  access  to  it.  Such  an  arrangement  helps  to  keep  the

more valuable items from disappearing before the treasure can

be evenly divided.

Creatures: The pile of loot is guarded by four khaastas with

orders  to  attack  any  creatures  (including  other  khaastas)  that

come closer than 20 feet. Depending on the PCs actions up to

this point, the guards from area 3 may also be here.

Khaastas (4): hp 18, 22, 22, 26; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics: Because they consider melee combat to be the most

glorious way to  ght a battle, the khaastas here engage other

melee combatants before spellcasters. If any spell obviously af-

fects more than half their number, however, they attempt to

bring  down  the  spellcaster  immediately,  provoking  attacks  of

opportunity if necessary.

Development: If the battle turns against them, the khaastas

attempt to withdraw to area 6.

Treasure: The pile of treasure consists of 1,250 gp in coins, a

 nely wrought small gold bracelet (25 gp), a carved bone statu-

ette in the shape of a sarrukh (250 gp), a silver comb set with

moonstones (10 gp), vestments with cloth made of gold (700

gp), a solid gold snake idol (500 gp), a harp carved from exotic

wood, inlaid with ivory and set with zircon gems (1,500 gp), a

gold cup set with emeralds (50 gp), a  re opal pendant on a  ne

gold chain (75 gp), and a silver chalice set with emeralds and

rubies (50 gp).

6. Command Post (EL 9)

The twenty khaastas that embarked upon this mission are using

this  location  as  their  command  center.  While  it  might  make

greater tactical sense to use one of the structures, the khaastas

are  accustomed  to  outdoor  living  and  believe  that  remaining

inside a structure decreases their awareness of their surround-

ings. Thus, they prefer to remain in the open.

Three camp res form a tight triangle just outside a particu-

larly large building. Around them lie twenty bedrolls and a

collection of general supplies, including the carcasses of two

slain deer,  rewood,  ve bullseye lanterns that are currently

unlit,  ve shovels, and two large buckets.

Creatures: Rakhtil, the 4th-level khaasta cleric who leads this

party, is here with four khaasta guards.

Possessions: +2 breastplate, +1 light steel shield, +2 heavy mace,

Tactics: When the PCs approach, the guards engage them in

melee combat while Rakhtil casts cause fear. The next round,

Rakhtil casts protection from good if his fellow khaastas seem to

be holding their own, or enters the fray otherwise. His preferred

targets are enemy spellcasters. If he can remain out of combat,

he concentrates on curing wounded khaastas and using his other

spells to advantage.

Development: Should the party win this battle, any remain-

ing khaastas in the area promptly leave if given the chance. The

PCs can then move about the ruins unmolested.

7. Rakhanaali Obelisk

The obelisk stands unguarded at the center of the sarrukh ruins.

An immense, four-sided obelisk carved out of gray stone

rises some 60 feet from the cavern  oor. All four sides slope

toward the center, coming to a point at the top. The stone

appears absolutely featureless.

The khaastas have investigated the obelisk, but have so far they

can only surmise that it functions as a portal. They intend to

return to the Barrens of Doom and Despair and report its exis-

tence to their superiors so that they can dispatch some demonic

allies to investigate it.

Development: The key to activate the portal from this di-

rection is a sarrukh scale, which must be placed into a hidden

crevice (Search DC 30) 6 feet above the ground on any side. The

terminus points on the other planes are simply open areas. The

return key is the heart of any Scaleless One slain within the past

hour, which must be placed on the open ground while uttering

a prayer to the World Serpent.

Concluding the Adventure

If the PCs defeat the khaastas, they can investigate the obelisk

and loot the ruins to their hearts content. Any khaastas that

escape  return  immediately  to  their  leaders  and  report  their

 ndings,  prompting  their  leaders  to  dispatch  a  vrock  (see

Monster Manual page 48) to investigate. If the khaastas fail

to report within 2 more weeks, a force of thirty khaastas led

to this group.

have yet to enter that room, and they suspect that something of

great value lies within.

The Defiled Temple

of the World Serpent

The De led Temple of the World Serpent is a short, site-based

adventure for 7th-level characters that can be placed within any

swamp  in  Faern.  The  season  is  unimportant  as  long  as  the

prevailing weather is warm to hot.

Background

Originally built by the sarrukh of Mhairshaulk, this structure

was once a temple to the World Serpent. During the centuries

that it sat unused, it gradually sank into the mud of a swamp in

the southern Mhair Junglesa region considered sacred by the

yuan-ti that live in the surrounding area.

Because it was once a holy place of the sarrukh, claiming this

structure was a major victory for the faithful of Sessinnek. A

group of lizardfolk, led by the lizard king Khaghassta and a few

of his khaasta allies located the temple some weeks ago. They

immediately moved into the structure, de led all the statues and

religious artifacts the sarrukh considered sacred, and converted

the place into a temple to Sessinnek. Despite their apparent suc-

cess, however, access to one chamber (area 9) eludes them. They

In fact, this ancient sarrukh temple is the resting place for a

legendary weapon called Serpents Fang, the weapon of one of

the  most  famous  warriors  the  sarrukh  empire  ever  produced.

This greatsword was crafted for Ilniktu, one of the few sarrukh

who  chose  to  become  a  warrior  rather  than  grow  lazy  while

servitors defended the empire. Thousands of years ago, Ilniktu

led the yuan-ti and other scaly races against their enemies while

the sarrukh empire was falling. He is regarded as a hero by both

the yuan-ti and the sarrukh even to this day.

The sarrukh and their allies have been trying to locate this

lost temple of the World Serpent for quite some time because

they desperately desire to regain Ilniktus weapon as an inspi-

ration for their people in their continuing struggle to reassert

dominance. Not only do they wish to recover Serpents Fang,

they would also like to re-establish the temple as a place of wor-

ship. By doing so, they could claim a moral victory against the

khaastas and their demonic allies.

The khaastas and their allies also know of the blade and are

actively looking for it. Should they  nd it  rst, they intend to

taunt  their  enemies  with  it  by  allowing  their  best  warrior  to

wield it in battle against the sarrukh. Such a display would surely

deal a serious blow to sarrukh morale.

The humans of the area know nothing of the dire con ict

between the evil reptilian folk of the area, but the lizard kings

hunger  for  human   esh  has  engendered  a  situation  that  may

provoke discovery of the temple by adventurers. The occupying

tribe has been actively seeking out and capturing humansboth

travelers and residents of nearby villages. During the past couple

of weeks, residents of the surrounding settlements have become

aware that people are disappearing, and they have decided to seek

aid in  nding them.

The glass that once allowed light to  lter into the cham-

ber is still in place, but the exterior is covered with dirt and

foliage,  allowing  only  a  few  shafts  of  light  to  penetrate.

Piles  of  rubble  litter  the  chamber,  and  a  ledge  protrudes

from the wall 15 feet above the  oor.

Adventure Synopsis

The PCs must enter the temple and explore it, overcoming the

lizardfolk and the khaastas in the process. Assuming they suc-

cessfully penetrate the temple, they may be able to gain access

to area 9 and recover the sought-after blade.

Beginning the Adventure

The temple is made of basalt and lies buried under many feet

of mud. The ceilings in most sections of the temple are 40 feet

above the  oor, although they rise to a height of 60 feet in the

domes areas. Despite its age and degree of immersion in swamp

muck, the temple is remarkably well preserved.

1. Entrance (EL Variable)

Dense foliage conceals the temple so well that anyone who fails a

DC 15 Spot check mistakes it for yet another vegetation-covered

mound in this jungle. When the PCs have noticed it, read or

paraphrase the following.

A structure made of basalt stones has sunk several feet into

the marshy ground. Vines crawl up the side of the building,

and mangroves lean up against it. A pair of ornate double

doors with snakes engraved upon them constitutes the only

apparent entrance.

This pair of doors is the only entrance to the temple. A lock of

amazing quality once secured them, but it has long since rusted

through and no longer functions.

Creatures:  At  any  time,  a  few  lizardfolk  are  outside  the

temple hunting.

Lizardfolk  (1d4):  hp  12  each;  see  Monster  Manual  page

169.

Development: Closer examination reveals that the mud im-

mediately in front of the doorway has been removed, allowing

the doors to swing outward. Continue with the following when

the PCs open the doors.

1A. ENTRANCE HALL (EL 6)

This chamber once received worshipers of the World Serpent.

This immense chamber is shaped like a rectangle melded to

a semicircle. The double doors open into the center of the

semicircular portion, and on the opposite side of the room

is a single door set just to the left of center. A domed ceiling

rises some 60 feet above the smooth  oor.

Years ago, numerous marble statues of the World Serpent deco-

rated this room, but the lizardfolk and their allies have smashed

those to rubble. Hidden handholds (Search DC 15) in the walls

allow access to the ledge.

Creatures:  Two  khaastas  and  three  lizardfolk  stand  guard

over this room. When the PCs arrive, they are hiding within

patches of darkness toward the rear of the chamber.

Khaastas (2): hp 19, 23; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Lizardfolk  (3):  hp  11,  12,  14;  see  Monster  Manual  page

169.

Tactics: The khaastas and lizardfolk immediately attack any

intruders  who  do  not  appear  to  be  of  their  own  races.  If  the

guards are aware of the PCs for at least 1 round before they enter,

the  lizardfolk  are  already  standing  upon  the  ledge.  Otherwise,

they  begin  by  taking  a  move  action  to  climb  up  to  the  ledge

using the tiny handholds. Once atop it, the lizardfolk throw their

tipped javelins, which are coated with sleep poison (see Poisons in

Chapter 10) at the characters. Meanwhile, the khaastas engage

the party in melee combat. Extra javelins have been left on the

ledge, giving each combatant access to a total of  ve.

Each  khaasta  carries  in  its  mouth  a  dried  chicken  bladder

 lled with the same poison that coats the lizardfolks arrows.

Once  during  the  combat,  each  of  them  can  bite  the  chicken

bladder as a free action, spraying the poison on all opponents

within  a  10-foot  quarter-circle.  The  khaastas  are  immune  to

the poison.

If the characters use the handholds to climb the walls, the

lizardfolk use their javelins to trip them. A tripped character

falls  to  the  ground  below,  lying  prone.  If  the  PCs  manage  to

climb  up  to  the  ledge  level,  the  lizardfolk  attempt  to  grapple

them and jump from the ledge, taking the battle to the  oor.

Two lizardfolk then engage the PCs in melee combat while the

third runs to the nearest guardpost (area 2) for reinforcements.

Development: Any PCs who fall in combat are locked up in

area 3 to be eaten later.

2. Guardposts (EL 5)

The  temple  contains  several  nearly  identical  rooms  that  now

serve as guardposts. The furnishings are spartan, consisting of

four hard chairs and a table in each chamber.

Creatures: Three lizardfolk and one khaasta are on guard in

each of these chambers.

Khaasta (1): hp 22; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Lizardfolk  (3):  hp  11,  12,  14;  see  Monster  Manual  page

169.

Tactics: The guards in these rooms have orders to prevent in-

truders from going any farther into the temple. The lizardfolks

javelins are tipped with sleep poison (see Poisons in Chapter 10),

182

ADVENTURES

as are the barbs on the khaastas net. The khaasta is not pro -

cient with the net, so she takes a 4 penalty on her attack rolls

with that weapon.

Development: If at any time the main force in the temple

is alerted to the presence of invaders, the guards in the nearest

two rooms leave their posts to investigate the disturbance. Any

captured or slain PCs are taken to area 3, where they are held

for Khaghassta to eat later.

3. Cold Storage

This  chamber  is  for  prisoners  being  saved  for  Khaghasstas

meals and for corpses that the lizardfolk and khaastas can dine

upon. The door is locked (Open Locks DC 23). Read or para-

phrase the following when the characters enter.

This chamber is dark and extremely cold. Five frightened-

looking humans sit on the  oor. The foul smell of rotting

meat permeates the room, rising from a half-eaten human

corpse the  oor.

Because  of  the  angle  at  which  the  temple  has  sunk  into  the

earth,  this  corner  room  is  buried  deeper  in  the  ground  than

most  of  the  rest  of  the  temple.  Because  of  this,  it  stays  cold

despite the heat outside.

The key to this chamber is among Khaghasstas possessions.

Creatures:  Five  human  prisoners  sit  unbound  within  this

room.

Prisoners (5): Male and female human commoner 5; CR 4;

Medium humanoid; HD 5d4+5; hp 17; Init +1; Spd 30 ft.; AC

12, touch 11,  at-footed 11; Base Atk +2; Grp +4; Atk +4 melee

(1d3+2, unarmed strike); Full Atk +4 melee (1d3+2, unarmed

strike); AL NG; SV Fort +2, Ref +2, Will +3; Str 15, Dex 12,

Con 13, Int 8, Wis 14, Cha 10.

Skills  and  Feats:  Craft  (any)  +4,  Profession  (hunter)  +8,

Swim  +7;  Far  Shot,  Point  Blank  Shot,  Precise  Shot,  Simple

Weapon Pro ciency (longbow).

Possessions:  Padded  armor,  torch,  waterskin,  trail  rations,

bedroll.

Development: The prisoners are traumatized but willing to

tell the PCs all they know. Each was captured on the road near

the marsh within the past three days. Each day, the lizardfolk

come and take one or two people out, who never return. Once

the prisoners tried to overpower the guards as a group but did

not succeed. The half-eaten corpse was left there as a lesson to

them after that incident.

Any  party  member  brought  here  for  imprisonment  is  dis-

armed and locked in this chamber with the other prisoners for 12

hours. At that point, he or she is taken to area 5 to be sacri ced.

4. Khaasta Chambers (EL 7)

The khaastas have converted this room into their lair. While

they  normally  prefer  to  camp  outdoors,  they  know  that  this

temple is in enemy territory, so they remain inside.

Eight large rocks are spaced evenly throughout this room.

Aside from the rocks, there are no furnishings in view. Four

scaly creatures take their ease here.

Creatures: If the temple is not yet on alert, four khaatas are

resting here.

Khaastas (4): hp 20, 22, 25, 30; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics: Unless the party has made a great deal of noise in

a nearby area, or the temple has been alerted to the presence

of  intruders,  the  khaastas  are  asleep  when  the  PCs  enter.  It

takes them 1 round to awaken and another round to grab their

weapons. If given the chance, they call for help from room 2.

Development: If captured and interrogated, these khaastas

can reveal the name of the lizard king (Khaghassta) and the

reason for their occupation. (The place is an old sarrukh temple.)

They do not know there is anything especially valuable here.

5. Ceremonial Chamber (EL 5)

This room was once the ceremonial chamber for honoring the

World Serpent.

At  the  center  of  this  square  room  stands  a  20-foot-tall

statue of a snake-bodied humanoid that is missing its head

and arms. The head lies on the  oor next to the base of the

statue, and bits of rubble are scattered nearby. At the base

of the statue is a dais bearing a brown-stained altar. Nearby

stands a large piece of stone, still formless and unworked.

Four lizardfolk, one wearing ceremonial robes, are laboring

over it with sharp tools.

The desecrated statue depicted an aspect of the World Serpent.

Its arms have already been smashed to bits, and the rubble from

them litters the  oor. The larger pieces, however, have already

been  gathered,  crushed,  and  mixed  with  other  ingredients  to

make a new piece of stone.

The lizardfolk have been using the sacri cial altar at the base

of the vandalized snake statue to sacri ce prisoners to Sessinnek

so that Khaghaasta can satisfy his urge to eat.

Creatures: Currently, three ordinary lizardfolk and a cleric of

Sessinnek are carving the reconstituted rock into a new statue

of their demon-god.

Lizardfolk  (3):  hp  11,  12,  13;  see  Monster  Manual  page

ADVENTURES

Skills and Feats: Balance +0, Concentration +6, Diplomacy

+2, Jump +3, Knowledge (arcana) +3, Spellcraft +4, Swim 3;

Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Multiattack.

Hold Breath (Ex): Kssla can hold her breath for 56 rounds

before  she  risks  drowning  (see  page  304  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Cleric Spells Prepared (4/4; save DC 12 + spell level): 0

create water, cure minor wounds, detect magic, purify food and

drink; 1stcause fear, command, cure light wounds, protection

from law*.

Domain  spell.  Deity:  Sessinnek.  Domains:  Chaos  (cast

chaos  spells  at  +1  caster  level),  Darkness  (Blind-Fight  as  a

bonus feat).

Possessions: +1 scale mail, heavy steel shield, +1 heavy mace,

masterwork  light  crossbow,  10  crossbow  bolts,  potion  of  cure

moderate wounds, 2 potions of cure light wounds, backpack, wa-

terskin, trail rations, bedroll, sack,  int and steel, wooden holy

symbol.

Tactics: Because Kssla has not been able to bypass the arcane

lock on the door to area 9, she would rather make a deal with any

intruders than  ght them. If the PCs do not immediately attack,

she offers them two rubies from Khaghasstas treasure chest to

help her bypass the door and allow her people to take the items

within. If the PCs refuse, she gives her companions the signal

to attack.

On  Ksslas  command,  the  lizardfolk  attack  the  PCs  with

their javelins, which are coated with sleep poison (see Poisons

in Chapter 10). If possible, Kssla calls out for aid, then casts

protection from law on the  rst round of combat, followed by

cause fear the next. Therafter, she tries to stay out of combat

and heal her allies. If forced into melee combat, she  ghts using

her heavy mace.

Development:  If  the  characters  accept  Ksslas  offer,  she

leads  them  to  area  9.  If  they  slay  all  the  lizardfolk  in  the

chamber, they can continue to explore on their own.

Chaos Beast: hp 55; see Monster Manual page 33.

Tactics:  The  chaos  beast  is  hiding  among  the  bookshelves

when the characters arrive. It attacks when a good opportunity

presents itself and changes forms often during combat.

7. Lizardfolk Chambers (EL 6)

The majority of the lizardfolk inhabiting the temple stay in this

room when they are not manning the guardposts or hunting

for food.

On the  oor along the east wall of this domed, quarter-cir-

cular chamber are  fteen bedrolls tightly packed together.

Near the opposite wall is pile of discarded food and waste.

Nine scaly humanoids are gnawing on what appears to be

human body parts.

The lizardfolk in this room spend the majority of their time

eating or sleeping, though  ghts occasionally break out when

they become bored.

Creatures:  Nine  lizardfolk  are  currently  dining  on  the  re-

mains of a human prisoner in this chamber.

Lizardfolk (9): hp 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 14, 15; see

Monster Manual page 169.

Tactics: Unless the party has made a great deal of noise in

a nearby area, or the temple has been alerted to the presence

of  intruders,  the  lizardfolk  are  unprepared  for  intruders.  It

takes them 1 round to grab their weapons. If given the chance,

they call for help from the nearest guard room (area 2). Each

lizardfolk has a javelin tipped with sleep poison (see Poisons in

Chapter 10) and two barbed nets treated with the same poison

(see area 2). They are not pro cient with the nets, so each takes

a 4 penalty on attacks made with them.

Development:  Characters  who  fall  in  battle  here  are  dis-

armed and imprisoned in area 3.

6. Lair of the Chaos Beast

(EL 7)

This  chamber  was  once  a  library,  but  it  is  now  the  lair  of  a

chaos beast that has been a servant of these lizardfolk since long

before they came to this temple.

8. Khaghasstas Chamber

(EL 8)

This room once belonged to the sarrukh cleric in charge of this

temple, but the lizard king Khaghaasta has claimed it for his

own.

This domed, quarter-circle room is lined with bookshelves

 lled with dusty, ancient-looking, leather-bound books. The

windows overhead are covered with vegetation, so only a few

shafts of light illuminate the darkened chamber. Bones of

various kinds litter the  oor.

The books on the shelves are so ancient that their pages disinte-

grate when touched. The bones are from humanoid and animal

victims that the chaos beast has dragged here to consume.

Creature: A chaos beast currently resides here, although it is

allowed out of the temple to prey on other creatures at will.

Within  this  opulent-looking  bedchamber  stands  a  power-

fully built lizard-man with dark coloration and wings. Four

other scaly humanoid creatures attend him.

This room is furnished with a bed that has recently been restored

and with a chest that the lizard king brought with him.

Creatures: The lizard king is accompanied by four khaasta

guards at all times. Should he hear the sound of  ghting, he

leaves this room to investigate the disturbance.

Possessions:  + 1  breastplate,  +2  greatsword,  longbow,  20

arrows, 5 cold iron arrows, 2 potions of cure moderate wounds,

potion of neutralize poison, cloak of resistance +1, climbers kit.

Khaastas (4): hp 25, 30; see Fiend Folio page 115.

Tactics:  When  the  PCs  open  the  door  to  this  room,  the

khaastas rush to block their path, standing side-by-side in the

doorway. Khaghassta takes to the air and tries to stay out of

sight until the characters have managed to  ght their way into

the room. At that point, he drops down,  ies into a rage, and

attacks. His preferred target is any character who appears to be

an arcane spellcaster.

Development: If the battle does not go well for Khaghassta,

he attempts to  ee the temple with any lizardfolk and khaastas

that are still alive and mobile.

Any  characters  that  fall  in  battle  here  are  disarmed  and

taken to area 3 to await sacri ce.

Treasure: The chest is locked (Open Lock DC 25). It contains

540 gp, two rubies (2, 250 gp each), dust of disappearance, and

a folding boat.

9. Serpents Fang (EL 9)

This room is the  nal resting place of the sarrukh hero Ilniktu,

wielder  of  Serpents  Fang.  An  arcane  lock  secures  the  door.

The lizardfolk inhabiting the temple do not currently have the

means to bypass the spell, so they have not yet penetrated this

chamber.

Trap: Opening the door activates a spell placed by the sar-

rukh and summons a piscoloth. The piscoloth immediately casts

stinking cloud on the party and then dives into melee, using its

pincers and tentacles. If the battle goes poorly for the creature, it

summons four skeroloths to keep the attackers busy, then uses its

meld into stone ability to hide for 1d3 rounds, hoping to surprise

its foes when it emerges.

Summon Monster VIII Trap: CR 9; magic device; proximity

trigger (alarm); automatic reset; spell effect (summon monster

VIII,  15th-level  wizard,  piscoloth);  Search  DC  33;  Disable

Device DC 33. Cost: 60,500 gp, 4,840 XP.

Piscoloth: hp 65; see Fiend Folio page 196.

Skereloths (4): hp 22, 25, 27, 35; see Fiend Folio page 197.

In the center of this room stands a stone platform bear-

ing the body of a scaly creature in ceremonial armor. The

corpse holds an immense sword that is clearly well crafted.

Carvings  of  writhing  serpents  decorate  the  walls  of  the

chamber, but it is otherwise unadorned.

Ilniktu was a legged sarrukh of great strength. His body has

been preserved with a permanent gentle repose spell.

Development: Ilniktu is truly dead and does not animate if

his sword is removed from his hands.

Treasure: The only treasures within this room are Serpents

Fang (a +2 viper greatsword) and the suit of +3 full plate armor

that Ilniktu wears.

Concluding the Adventure

If the characters leave the temple with Serpents Fang, the sar-

rukh eventually learn of its whereabouts and send their minions

to retrieve it. If the PCs destroy the blade, the sarrukh may seek

vengeance if they  nd out, but they have so many other worries

that they make no more than a couple of attacks.

If the PCs open area 9 and allow the lizardfolk to take the

sword, they let the characters leave in peace. Shortly thereafter,

Khaghassta presents the blade to the khaasta leaders, who de-

clare the lizard king and his tribe honorary members. They use

the sword in their ongoing struggle against the sarrukh, and the

morale blow to the enemy gives the khaastas the upper hand, at

least temporarily.

Should  the  party  leave  the  temple  without  clearing  it  or

retrieving  Serpents  Fang,  the  sarrukh  discover  the  location

two  weeks  later.  Unlike  the  lizardfolk  and  the  khaastas,  they

do have the magic necessary to enter area 9 and retrieve the

sword. The legendary blade motivates their followers to attack

the khaastas in several locations throughout Faern. Their raids

are so successful that they gain the upper hand in the struggle,

at least temporarily.

Deities of the

Scaled Ones

The deities worshiped by the various Scaled Ones are summa-

rized in the table on the next page. Details of their origins and

histories are provided in the paragraphs that follow.

Essylliss

After  the  creation  of  the  lizardfolk,  the  World  Serpent  created

an aspect of himself in their image. The god felt the need to give

these simple creatures a deity they could call their own, lest they be

distracted by the plethora of other deities. The worship of Essylliss

lasted two thousand years after the fall of sarrukh-ruled Mhair-

shaulk. Ultimately, however, the splintered factions of the lizardfolk

began worshiping Semuanya. Today Essylliss is worshiped by a hand-

ful of lizardfolk, and barely a trace of him remains.

Mdaess

The issue of nonsarrukh sacri ces was the  rst major point of divi-

sion for the World Serpent. When the sarrukh made the decision

that members of their own race were too important to sacri ce to

their god, they violated one of the earliest and most fundamental

doctrines of their religion. Though the World Serpent agreed in

principle that Scaleless Ones made acceptable sacri ces, he couldnt

reconcile changing the agreement with the sarrukh. Rather than

back down from his demands or force them to hold to the original

187

agreement (and thereby risk their defection to another deity), the

World  Serpent  created  an  aspect  of  himself  called  Mdaess,  the

snake-mother, whose task was to purify the souls of the unclean

who  were  sacri ced  in  the  World  Serpents  name,  thus  making

them equivalent to sarrukh souls in the eyes of their god.

Merrshaulk

Upon the fragmentation of their primary deity, the sarrukh chose to

venerate the aspect embodied by Merrshaulk. This cruel and despotic

deity set the sarrukh on the path toward absolute evil. Merrshaulk

cared little for the plight of the serpent races, as long as they contin-

ued to worship him. He inexplicably sank into a deep slumber that

lasted for thousands of years. Ultimately, he was reborn in the form

of his avatar Sseth, the deity that the yuan-ti now venerate.

Parrafaire

The Naga Prince is the guardian of magical secrets and hidden

places far below the ground. His goal is not to prevent access

to such secrets, but to test the wisdom and resourcefulness of

those  who  come  seeking  them.  Parrafaire  delights  in  creating

clever traps, decoys, diversions, and mazes, and in offering cryp-

tic clues. His religious teachings are presented in the form of

riddles and puzzles to be deciphered by the worshiper.

The  Prince  of  Hidden  Secrets  has  few  worshipers  and  no

established church, although almost all nagas pay him at least

indirect homage.

Semuanya

The lizardfolk currently embrace Semuanya, an unfeeling and

uncaring fragment of the World Serpent. Semuanya promotes

only survival and teaches that any action taken in the pursuit

of  that  goal  is  acceptable.  He  dismisses  the  majority  of  the

struggles that take place in Faern, including the plight of his

followers, as completely irrelevant. Semuanya has no allies, and

his only enemy is the demon lord Sessinnek.

Shekinester

Shekinester is a complex, pragmatic goddess with  ve aspects:

the Acquirer (LE), the Empowerer (LG), the Seeker (CG), the

Weaver (CE), and the Preserver (N). Each aspect is represented

and venerated as a separate goddess.

The Acquirer: This aspect of the goddess represents the urge

to control and possess. She is often represented as a harsh-faced,

shrewish female naga clinging desperately to her failing youth.

As the Acquirer, the Five-Faced Queen seeks to hoard knowledge

and wisdom that is in danger of being lost or forgotten.

The Empowerer: In her role as guardian of the young and

uninitiated, the Empowerer is a bestower of wisdom. Represented

with  the  head  of  a  beautiful  young  maiden,  she  is  generally

viewed as kindly and merciful. As the Empowerer, Shekinester

actively seeks opportunities to grant wisdom to those who have

620_96566_SerpentKi168-192.indd   187

5/13/04, 8:16:16 AM

APPENDIX

not  even  realized  they  have  need  of  such.  This  aspect  of  her

nature can also make her an unwelcome messenger who forces

followers into initiations that can cause them growing pains.

The Seeker: Often represented as a childlike naga, the Seeker

is  lled with curiosity. This aspect of Shekinester drives the need

to explore and study.

The Weaver: This aspect of the Five-Faced Queen is the princi-

ple of active destructiona crone-faced naga who destroys in order

to make room for new life. However, she is also the embodiment of

connections, bringing together disparate strands of knowledge to

create new understanding. As the Weaver, Shekinester seeks to de-

stroy anyone who enters the lost and decaying places she guards.

The Preserver: Seen as a middle-aged female naga, this aspect

of the goddess is the keeper of the  ame in the Court of Light

and the great maintainer of existence. She also has jurisdiction

over the spirits of the dead, greeting them with water, fruit, and

bread and protecting them from harm. As the Preserver, Sheki-

nester provides sustenance for mortals threatened by extinction,

overwhelming force, or some other terrible threat.

Sseth

Around the time of Netherils collapse, a charismatic Yuan-ti

with  feathery  wings  emerged,  proclaiming  himself  to  be  the

avatar of Merrshaulk, who had long been in a state of somno-

lence. Serpentes, a great Yuan-ti kingdom, was forged under the

rule of this new leader, who called himself Sseth. The yuan-ti

and the few remaining sarrukh began to worship him as the new

incarnation  of  Merrshaulk.  Ultimately,  Sseth  too  sank  into  a

long slumber, which eventually caused the sarrukh of Okoth to

transfer their allegiance to the Mulhorandi deity Set.

Ssharstrune

Another fragment of the World Serpent was Ssharstrune, a ser-

pent god worshiped primarily by evil nagas. Ssharstrune, who

embodied the acquisitive, power-hungry natures of some nagas,

was ultimately swallowed by Shekinester, inadvertently causing

her to assume multiple aspects.

Sssthasiness

Another aspect of the World Serpent, Sssthasiness was an evil

deity  once  worshiped  by  yuan-ti,  dark  nagas,  and  a  few  other

Scaled Ones. He appeared to his followers as a writhing swarm

of  coiled  serpents  in  a  crude  humanoid  shape  and  typically

communicated through the heads of countless smaller snakes.

Sssthasiness  was  ultimately  destroyed  by  one  of  the  elf  gods

around the time that the Vyshaantaar rose to power in Aryvan-

daar. Talona has since assumed his aspect.

Varae

A  nomadic  beast  cult  made  up  of  humans  in  the  Shining

Plains began worshiping the god Varae during the Fifth Age of

Calimshan ( 200 DR to 270 DR). A group of pureblood yuan-ti

from the Chultan Peninsula in ltrated the cult and spread its

in uence across Faern. One group of cultists migrated north

in search of Ssthartissssun, only to be transformed en masse

into ophidians when they unleashed an artifact created by House

Orogoth and left behind by the yuan-ti.

1Poison Kiss (Ex): While grappling, a tainted one can choose to smear her opponent with poisonous saliva instead of dealing damage. This poison kiss can be

used only while grappling a foe with exposed skin. The tainted one makes an opposed grapple check instead of an attack and takes a 4 penalty on the check. If

she wins, she successfully applies the poison (contact, Fortitude DC 13 + tainted ones Con modi er, initial and secondary damage 1d4 Con) by kissing, licking,

or lightly biting her opponent. (This ability replaces the poison bite ability given in Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faern.)

of history and game information on several races of

serpentfolk and lizardkin. Now designer Darrin Drader updates and

expands the information about another lizard race known as the sauri-

als.  These  creatures  were  previously  described  for  D&D  v.3.0  in  an

article by Sean K Reynolds in Dragon Magazine292.

Several  saurial  subraces  exist,  although  only  fournamely  blade-

backs,  finheads,  flyers,  and  hornheadsare  known  to  dwell  in  the

world  of  Toril.  Hornheads  are  as  large  as  ogres  and  flyers  are  as

small as halflings, but the other two subraces are similar to humans

in height and weight.

All saurials are generally humanoid in shape. Each has two arms

that end in clawed hands, two legs, and a lizardlike tail. A member

of the flyer subrace also has two wingsactually flaps of skin that

extend from its wrists to its waist that allow it to fly. The scales that

cover a saurials body are primarily green, with patterns of yellow

on its back. Very rarely, a pure white saurial is hatched, but this col-

oration carries no stigma, and the event is not considered an omen.

Somewhere near the Dalelands, in a hidden place known as the Lost

Vale,  lies  a  colony  of  intelligent  reptilian  humanoids  said  to  hail

from  another  world.  These  creatures,  known  as  saurials,  were

stranded in Faern by the actions of an evil deity. More intelligent

than lizardfolk and inclined to be peaceful and civilized, the saurials

have maintained a thriving community in near-complete isolation

for nearly fifteen years. Tales of these so-called dragonfolk pervade

many cultures, but few humans have actually seen them.

Racial History

The saurials of Faern are community-minded creatures that were

kidnapped from their home on an alternate Material Plane by the

imprisoned deity Moander and transported to the Lost Vale. There

they  worked  as  slaves,  corrupting  and  destroying  the  plants  and

Whatever  their  sources,  these  two  factors  ensure  that  as  a  race,

saurials favor good over evil. Lawful saurials tend to be exceedingly

protective, while chaotic ones tend to be more aggressive. All, how-

ever, favor open discussion of how good aims should be achieved and

maintain that personal freedoms should share space with the will of

the majority. Saurial leaders are usually wise individuals who employ

good judgment to achieve these ideals.

Saurial Society

The saurials of Faern have banded together into a group known as

the Lost Vale Tribe, which originally consisted of 110 adult sauri-

alsprimarily because Moander made a point of slaying the tribes

young.  In  the  years  since  their  release,  the  saurials  have  produced

many new hatchlings, and the tribe now numbers 485 individuals,

104  of  which  are  original  members.  The  leader  of  the  Lost  Vale

Tribe  is  Grypht  (NG  hornhead  saurial  wizard  15),  who  has  three

apprentices (NG saurial wizard 3). The spiritual leaders of the com-

munity are Sweetleaf (NG bladeback saurial cleric 9 of Chauntea),

Copperbloom (CG finhead saurial cleric 5 of Finder Wyvernspur),

and their eight acolytes (NG or CG saurial cleric 2 of Chauntea or

Finder Wyvernspur).

In a typical saurial village, each member of the tribe learns a skill

that  suits  him,  such  as  blacksmithing,  weaving,  farming,  hunting,

carpentry,  masonry,  or  the  like.  Saurials  prefer  to  build  single-

family  stone  dwellings,  although  they  have  been  known  to  live  in

thatched huts if material or time is in short supply.

A saurial village usually incorporates more than one subrace, and

its  members  treat  each  other  as  equals  and  value  one  anothers

unique  contributions  to  the  community.  The  different  subraces

cannot crossbreed, so the members of a given saurial household are

normally all the same subrace.

Finheads  are  the  most  common  saurials.  Bladebacks  and  horn-

heads require more food than the other subraces, so they deliberately

keep their numbers low to avoid depleting the villages resources.

Language

Saurials speak Draconic, punctuating their speech with scents that

indicate  their  emotions.  Their  voices  are  pitched  too  high  for

humanoids to hear, but those who can detect the scents and under-

stand  their  meaning  can  gain  a  general  understanding  of  a  given

saurials  mood.  The  emotions  corresponding  to  the  stronger  scent

cues are given on the following table.

EEmmoottiioonn

Anger

Confusion

Nervousness or worry

SScceenntt

Baked bread

Brimstone

Ham

Honeysuckle Tenderness

Lemons

Roses

Tar

Violets

Wood smoke Devotion or piety

Pleasure or joy

Sadness

Danger or fear

Dragons and fey can hear saurials perfectly (although fey dont nec-

essarily  understand  Draconic),  and  they  generally  understand  the

scent cues whether or not they can follow the vocal content of the

message.  Saurials  can  understand  other  creatures  that  speak  Dra-

conic, although their speech tends to seem dull and tired without the

2

creatures of that region to facilitate Moanders return to full deity

status.  The  saurials  finally  gained  their  freedom  with  the  aid  of  a

former Harper named Finder Wyvernspur (who slew Moander and

absorbed his divine energy, thereby ascending to godhood himself),

a  saurial  paladin  known  as  Dragonbait,  and  a  female  adventurer

named  Alias.  Elminster  suggested  that  the  saurials  remain  in  the

Lost Vale and work to repair the damage they had caused, and they

have done so, using this time to recover physically and spiritually

from the harsh treatment they endured as slaves.

Outlook

Saurials  are  generally  peaceful  and  contemplative  creatures.

Although  they  are  trying  to  expand  their  numbers  to  ensure  the

races survival, they have no desire to conquer new lands or to influ-

ence the world around them. Though they are not particularly xeno-

phobic,  they  tend  strongly  toward  isolationism.  Many  young

saurials, however, are curious about the world beyond their village,

and as those hatched in the Lost Vale reach adulthood, some may

choose to explore the world around them. Some of these youngsters

are likely to fall in with adventurers, since their strong community

ties  make  traveling  alone  uncomfortable  for  themespecially  if

they  havent  honed  their  language  skills  enough  to  communicate

easily with other races.

Saurials get along well with other open-minded creatures, partic-

ularly those that respect nature. Since they have remained isolated

from the other communities in the Dales, visiting saurials are likely

to  react  with  surprise  at  the  many  shapes  and  colors  of  other

humanoids.  A  saurials  initial  impression  of  a  stranger  is  likely  to

color her perception of the individuals race as a whole.

Saurials are generally good-natured, and each seems to know from

a very young age what role she will play in her own community. At

the same time, however, all saurials support the right of an individ-

ual  to  seek  out  and  learn  whatever  she  wishes  wherever  she  can.

Some sages speculate that this attitude may be a form of rebellion

against the slavery that the saurials once endured under Moander.

A Serpent KingdomsWeb Enhancement

proper scent cues. Saurials can learn to speak languages (including

Draconic)  normally  with  study,  although  few  bother  to  do  so.

Because of the difficulty of speaking the deep tongues, saurials can

understand  the  bonus  languages  they  select  but  cannot  actually

speak them unless they devote skill points to learning them.

Saurials  make  written  records  by  carving  lines  on  sticks.  Nor-

mally,  however,  written  communication  is  used  only  for  magical

writing or to record important events.

Relationships

Saurials mate for life, and the bond between mates is far stronger

than it is in most humanoid pairings. Siblings likewise share partic-

ularly strong bonds and do their best to protect one another from

harm.  Saurials  make  friends  quickly  and  enemies  slowly,  though

they do not hesitate to protect their loved ones from obvious harm.

Life Cycle

Assuming favorable conditions for nesting, a mated pair of saurials

can produce one or two eggs per year. The parents share the duties

of protecting the eggs and rearing and training the young.

Hatchlings grow to adult size within five years, but they require

another  ten  to  fifteen  years  to  reach  the  mental  and  emotional

maturity level of adults. Saurials have the same life expectancy and

use the same age categories as dwarves.

Saurial Traits

All  of  the  saurial  subraces  share  the  following  traits.  For  other

information specific to each subrace, see the monster statistics in the

Appendix.

CCoolldd TToorrppoorr ((EExx)):: Saurials are warm-blooded creatures, but they

retain heat poorly in cold environments. Thus, a saurial takes a 5

penalty on Fortitude saving throws made to avoid nonlethal damage

from cold environments, and it takes double the normal amount of

nonlethal damage for failing such a saving throw.

In  cooler  climates,  saurials  can  easily  die  from  exposure  in  an

environment that a human would find merely uncomfortable. Thus,

they usually bundle up to keep warm.

PPrrootteeccttiioonn ffrroomm SSoonniicc AAttttaacckkss ((EExx)):: Because a saurials earholes

are well protected, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws

against sonic effects and attacks.

SScceenntt ((EExx)):: Saurials have the scent special quality, as described in

the Monster Manual.

VVuullnneerraabbiilliittyy  ttoo  GGaass  AAttttaacckkss  ((EExx)):: A  saurials  metabolism  and

reliance  on  scent  make  it  vulnerable  to  attacks  conveyed  through

gas,  including stinking cloud, cloudkill,  and  poisonous  gas.  It  thus

takes  a  -4  penalty  on  saving  throws  against  gas-based  effects  and

attacks.

Magic of the

Saurials

Saurial Characters

Bladebacks, finheads, flyers, and hornheads are the only four saurial

subraces  known  to  live  in  Faern,  although  others  might  come

through a portalnow that a connection has been made to their home

world. All four subraces are suitable for use as player characters.

Saurials  are  quick  to  adapt  to  their  surroundings,  and  since  their

arrival on Toril, they have become interested in magic of all kinds.

Bladebacks and finheads have a natural aptitude for divine magic,

and hornheads make excellent wizards.

The  saurials  make  and  use  the  same  kinds  of  magic  items  that

humanoids  do,  though  they  have  a  slight  preference  for  defensive

items. No unique spells have thus far emerged from the saurial culture.

A Serpent KingdomsWeb Enhancement

Deities of the

Saurials

Even  on  their  homeworld,  saurials  were  a  spiritual  people.  The

majority of those brought to Faern as slaves now worship Finder

Wyvernspur  because  of  his  role  in  freeing  them  from  Moanders

rule.  Others  have  converted  to  the  worship  of  Faernian  deities

equivalent  to  those  of  their  ancestors  (predominantly  Tyr  and

Tymora).

Relations with

Other Races

Though they are generally friendly and good-natured, saurials have

little interest in interacting with other races. Few visitors are per-

mitted within their village in the Lost Vale, and the saurials leave

only  to  protect  their  homes  or  to  acquire  needed  goods  that  they

cannot make themselves. This policy of isolation might change in

the next year however, when the first generation of saurials hatched

in Faern reaches maturity and becomes curious about the rest of

the world.

Saurial elders have long cautioned the young ones against reckless

wandering, knowing that the people of the outside world often fear

the unfamiliar and are inclined to take offense at perfectly innocent

actions.  But  the  saurials  are  not  a  timid  people,  and  such  cautions

cannot dim the spark of independence and the innate curiosity that

has  allowed  them  to  survive  and  thrive  despite  their  previous

enslavement.

Saurial Equipment

Saurials favor the same kinds of weapons and armor as lizardfolk do,

though their equipment tends to be of higher quality. Most saurials

utilize  their  natural  attacks  in  conjunction  with  their  weaponry

where possible.

Saurial Encounters

Few saurials go adventuring, so most encounters with them occur in

or  near  the  Lost  Vale.  However,  exceptions  do  exist,  and  one  of

these is the saurial paladin known as Dragonbait.

Dragonbait

On his homeworld, the saurial paladin called Champion served the

god of justice. While on an extraplanar quest, he was captured by the

demon  Phalse,  but  the  actions  of  a  luck  goddess  freed  him  and

brought him to Faern. Shortly thereafter, he was captured by the

minions of a sorceress named Cassana, who planned to sacrifice him

and use his soul to power an artificial being that she was creating.

But somehow this creature, known only as Alias, became alive on her

own,  before  Cassana  could  sacrifice  Champion.  With  the  help  of

Finder Wyvernspur (who at the time was still a mortal), Champion

and  Alias  escaped  from  Cassanas  clutches  and  began  traveling

together.

Alias distrusted Champion at first and said that if he made one

wrong move, he would be dragonbait. Since he didnt understand any

language that Alias could speak, Champion accepted this term as his

name in this world. The two were captured again, but together they

finally eliminated their captors and won true freedom.

Some  time  thereafter,  this  strange  couple  began  investigating

rumors  about  the  return  of  Moander,  an  evil  god  of  rot  and  cor-

ruption who had been imprisoned for some time. With the aid of a

Harper, Dragonbait and Alias discovered that Moander had brought

some saurials to Faern, placed them in the Lost Vale, and enslaved

them. At his bidding, they were performing tasks that would facili-

tate Moanders full return to the world. Delving deeper with the aid

of magic, they realized that Finder Wyvernspur was the key to free-

ing the saurials and foiling Moanders evil plot.

When  Dragonbait  and  Alias  teleported  to  Finders  refuge,  they

found him and a halfling ally battling one of Moanders beholder

minions  and  a  cadre  of  orc  troops.  The  two  heroes  immediately

joined the battle and helped the embattled Finder emerge victorious.

Afterward,  the  group  went  to  the  Lost  Vale,  where  the  enslaved

saurials were working. Using cold magic to make the saurials slug-

gish, the heroes defeated them without serious harm on either side.

Finder and an allied mage then traveled to another plane and per-

manently destroyed Moander. The slain deitys divine power settled

on Finder, and he became a god in his own right.

Elminster  encouraged  the  saurials  to  remain  in  the  Lost  Vale,

and Dragonbait and Alias also stayed there for some time. But they

could not refuse when adventure called, and they quested together

throughout Faern for many years.

During one of their later adventures, Dragonbait and Alias trav-

eled to Westgate to acquire a powerful magic item that would help the

saurials watch their borders more easily. When they arrived, the lead-

ers of Westgate solicited their aid in breaking the back of the Night

Masksa secret society that controlled crime in the city. After unrav-

eling a complex web of payoffs, intrigue, and false identities, the two

heroes  defeated  the  leader  of  the  Night  Masks,  a  mysterious  being

known  only  as  the  Faceless.  This  action  opened  the  way  for  one  of

Manshoons clones to take over the organization a year later.

Eventually, Dragonbait and Alias returned to the Lost Vale and

settled down. Dragonbait learned how to speak Common and took a

mate  named  Copperbloom.  He  now  spends  most  of  his  time  pro-

tecting his people and raising his children, but he is always ready to

defend  his  homeland  against  threats.  Although  he  still  serves  his

original  deity  (known  to  Faernians  only  as  the  god  of  justice),

Dragonbait  acknowledges  the  Faernian  deities  and  receives  his

divine spells from Tyr.

Dragonbait might be encountered almost anywhere in the Dale-

lands. He is often accompanied by Alias or by saurial warriors and is

usually on a quest for information, resources, or aid for the saurials

of the Lost Vale.

smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the

LLaayy oonn HHaannddss ((SSuu)):: Dragonbait can heal wounds (his own or those

of others) by touch. Each day, he can heal 40 points of damage. He

may choose to divide his healing among multiple recipients, and he

doesnt have to use it all at once. Alternatively, he can use any or all

of  this  healing  to  deal  damage  to  undead  creatures.  Using  lay  on

This bipedal lizard looks taller and stockier than a human; in fact, its

built much like a half-orc. A line of sharp scales runs down its spine

from its head to the tip of its tail, which is about as long as its body.

Bladebacks are the most straightforward and trusting of the saurial

subraces. Highly social, they mix well with all kinds of saurials, and

even with creatures from outside the Lost Vale. Slow to anger, blade-

backs work hard to understand the motives of others, but they are

passionate  once  they  have  been  pushed  to  the  point  of  aggression.

Bladebacks often become village leaders or advisors to those in power.

Like most saurials, bladeback adventurers are usually motivated

by curiosity about the world around them. However, their trusting

and  open  nature  sometimes  gets  them  into  trouble  that  they  can

escape only through the use of force.

Bladebacks  speak  Draconic.  They  understand  (but  do  not  speak)

Common, Elven, Sylvan, and Celestial.

COMBAT

Bladebacks  seldom  initiate  battle  because  they  would  much  rather

learn about the creatures they meet. If attacked, however, they can

employ their claws and tails with deadly efficiency.

CCoolldd  TToorrppoorr  ((EExx)):: Bladebacks  are  warm-blooded  creatures,  but

they retain heat poorly in cold environments. Thus, a bladeback takes

a  5  penalty  on  Fortitude  saving  throws  made  to  avoid  nonlethal

damage  from  cold  environments,  and  it  takes  double  the  normal

amount of nonlethal damage for failing such a saving throw.

PPrrootteeccttiioonn  ffrroomm  SSoonniicc  AAttttaacckkss  ((EExx)):: Because  a  bladebacks  ear-

This reptilian creature stands slightly shorter than a typical human

and has roughly human shape and proportions. Its tail measures

slightly more than half its body length, and a pronounced fin

crowns its head.

Alert, bright, active, curious, and emotional, finheads are good with

their hands and willing to perform almost any sort of hard labor.

Most see the world in black-and-white terms and believe in absolute

concepts such as good, evil, and truth.

Finheads  are  enthusiastic  about  new  tasks  and  adventures,  and

they often leap into dangerous situations before fully understanding

them.  Even  so,  their  ability  to  think  quickly  on  their  feet  allows

them to assess situations within moments.

Finheads  speak  Draconic.  They  understand  (but  do  not  speak)

Common, Elven, Sylvan, and Celestial.

COMBAT

Finheads are apt to attack at the drop of a hat if they perceive their

foes to be dangerous or particularly loathsome in some way. They

seldom let obviously evil creatures pass without a fight. Like blade-

backs, finheads prefer to fight with their claws and tails.

CCoolldd TToorrppoorr ((EExx)):: Finheads are warm-blooded creatures, but they

retain heat poorly in cold environments. Thus, a finhead takes a 5

penalty on Fortitude saving throws made to avoid nonlethal damage

from cold environments, and it takes double the normal amount of

nonlethal damage for failing such a saving throw.

PPrrootteeccttiioonn ffrroomm SSoonniicc AAttttaacckkss ((EExx)):: Because a finheads earholes

are well protected, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws

against sonic effects and attacks.

SScceenntt ((EExx)):: Finheads have the scent special quality, as described in

the Monster Manual.

VVuullnneerraabbiilliittyy  ttoo  GGaass  AAttttaacckkss  ((EExx)):: A  finheads  metabolism  and

reliance on scent make it vulnerable to attacks conveyed through gas,

including stinking cloud, cloudkill, and poisonous gas. It thus takes a

4 penalty on saving throws against gas-based effects and attacks.

This reptile is about the size of a halfling and has similar propor-

tions. It has a short tail and a flap of scaly skin beneath each of its

arms. These primitive wings stretch from its wrists to its waist.

Flyers are the noisiest and most nervous of the saurials, and mem-

bers of other races often find them somewhat irritating. They love

gossip and enjoy spending time with people who are interested in lis-

tening to them.

Because of its wings, a flyer has difficulty wearing normal cloth-

ing, armor, or even a backpack. Thus, their accoutrements are typi-

cally custom-made.

Flyers usually act as scouts and messengers in a saurial commu-

nity,  although  several  important  saurial  heroes  have  been  flyers.

Those  that  become  adventurers  often  do  so  by  accident  or  out  of

necessity,  since  their  roles  in  saurial  society  often  put  them  in

harms way.

Flyers  speak  Draconic.  They  understand  (but  do  not  speak)

Common, Elven, Sylvan, and Celestial.

COMBAT

If threatened, flyers are more likely to flee than fight. When they

do decide to enter combat, they usually stay in the air, making flyby

attacks whenever possible to catch their foes by surprise. Otherwise,

they attack by alternately diving and withdrawing.

This bipedal lizard is as big as an ogre and has a tail longer than its

own body. Sharp horns protrude from its head, and a bony plate pro-

tects its neck.

Hornheads tend to be careful, rational planners. They choose their

words  carefully  and  avoid  taking  action  without  prior  contempla-

tion. Most are interested in alchemy, engineering, and other mental

pursuits,  and  many  also  enjoy  physical  tasks  requiring  discipline,

such as blacksmithing and weaponsmithing.

Most adventuring hornheads are consumed by a desire to under-

stand  the  particulars  of  the  world  around  them.  Some  choose  to

study the laws of other cultures, some the philosophical underpin-

nings  of  a  religion,  and  some  the  arcane  secrets  of  new  spells.  A

hornheads favored class is wizard, although some choose to develop

an innate talent for sorcery instead.
