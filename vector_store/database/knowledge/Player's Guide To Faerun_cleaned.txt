Mighty  heroes  stride  across  the  land  of

Faern,  forging  new  legends  with  their

strivings  and  their  triumphs.  Stalwart

shield  dwarf  warriors  battle  against  the  blood-

maddened orc hordes of the North. Sun elf mages

from distant Evermeet study the secret arts of elven High Magic.

Quick-witted Calishite rogues roam the alleyways and bazaars of fan-

tastic cities. The opportunities for adventure are virtually  limitless.

Players  Guide  to  Faern  offers  a  broad  overview  of  races,

prestige  classes,  feats,  spells,  magic  items,  monsters,  and  rules

expansions available in a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign. The book

has two primary purposes. First, it provides a v.3.5 update for the

FORGOTTEN  REALMS  setting.  Second,  it  serves  as  a  players  single

best collection of Faernian lore and arcana for building an in nite

variety of characters.

How to Use This Book

in Your Campaign

Players Guide to Faern gives you everything you need to create

and play FORGOTTEN REALMS characters.

Chapter  1,  Regions  and  Feats:  This  chapter  presents  a  new

reorganization of character regions and an updated regional feat

system,  plus  revisions  of  existing  feats  for  v.3.5.  Dozens  of  new,

more speci c character regions are included here to better represent

the disparate cultures and lands scattered across Faern.

Chapter  2,  Prestige  Classes:  The  prestige  classes  presented  in

Chapter 1 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting are revised

to v.3.5 here. In addition, a number of new prestige classes (such as

the Eye of Horus-Re) are introduced.

Chapter 3, Domains and Spells: This chapter updates the Toril-

speci c domains and spells found in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting and revises a number of spells originally

presented  in  the  Magic of Faern supplement.  It  also  includes  a

number of FORGOTTEN REALMS spells from earlier editions of the

game that had not previously been updated for the new DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS game.

Chapter 4, Magic Items: A broad selection of magic items from

previous FORGOTTEN REALMS products appears in this chapter. Also

featured  are  some  items  from  Magic  of  Faern  that  have  been

revised to be fully compatible with v.3.5 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.

Chapter  5,  Epic  Levels  in  Faern:  This  chapter  examines  epic

material speci c to the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting.

Chapter 6, The Cosmology of Toril: This chapter describes the

arrangement of the planes in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting.

Chapter 7, Campaign Journal: This chapter discusses the major

ongoing story elements currently active in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

game  setting  and  offers  some  tips  on  incorporating  these  events

into your own game.

Appendix:  Expanded  Play: The  section  provides  Toril-speci c

feats  and  prestige  classes  that  incorporate  material  from  the

Psionics Handbook, Book of Vile Darkness, and Book of Exalted

Deeds, as well as variant level adjustments for popular races.

What You Need to Play

To  make  the  best  use  of  Players  Guide  to  Faern,  you  should

have  the  Players  Handbook  v.3.5,  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide

v.3.5,  the  Monster  Manual  v.3.5,  and  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign Setting.

This  book  updates  signi cant  portions  of  several  other

FORGOTTEN  REALMS  products,  including  Races  of  Faern  and

Magic of Faern.

Finally, Players Guide to Faern addresses the interaction of

several other rulebooks with the FORGOTTEN REALMS game setting.

Information on speci c applications of the Psionics Handbook, Epic

Level  Handbook,  and  Manual  of  the  Planes  for  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS setting is presented where applicable.

Previous Forgotten

Realms Products

While  the  version  3.5  revisions  to  the

DUNGEONS  &   DRAGONS  game  included  a

number  of  relatively  minor  changes  and

updates to the game system, the majority

of  your  existing  3rd  Edition  FORGOTTEN

REALMS  supplements  and  accessories  are

still perfectly usable in your game.

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set-

ting:  Chapters  1  through  3  of  Players

Guide  to  Faern  update  and  supersede

Chapters  1  and  2  of  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting. The rest of the

Campaign Setting is unchanged by the v.3.5

revisions  to  the  DUNGEONS  &  DRAGONS

game.  However,  Chapter  7  of  this  book

(the  Campaign  Journal),  offers  some

updates  on  major  story  develop-

ments  re ected  in  the  Return  of

the Archwizards and War of the Spider

Q ueen novel series.

Monster  Compendium:  Monsters  of

Faern:  A  free  web  supplement  updates

the  Faernian  monsters  described  in  the

Monster Compendium.

Magic  of  Faern:  Unless  a  feat,

prestige  class,  spell,  or  magic  item

from Magic of Faern has been revised

in Players Guide to Faern, you can still

use  it  as  it  was.  Chapters  3,  4,  and  5  of

this  book  revise  a  signi cant  amount  of

material from Magic of Faern.

Lords  of  Darkness:  As  with  the  FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, most

of the material in Lords of Darkness has

not been signi cantly affected by the core

rulebook revisions.

INTRODUCTION

Faiths  and  Pantheons:  Many  of  the  deity  descriptions  are  af-

fected by the core rulebook revisions. (For example, changes to the

ranger class affect any deity with levels in ranger.) Most of these

changes are relatively minor, and the deities can be used as previ-

ously  presented  without  serious  problems,

although  you  may  need  to  identify  spell

names that have changed in the Players

Handbook v.3.5. (See the free download for

Deities and Demigods on the Wizards of

the Coast website for detailed information

about  how  to  convert  deity  statistics  to

conform to the v.3.5 revision.)

The  prestige  classes  described  in

Chapter 4 should be usable as they stand,

although  you  should  watch  out  for  no-

menclature  changes,  such  as  spell  names

or skill names.

Silver  Marches:  Very  little  of  this

book  is  affected  by  the  revisions  to  the

core  rulebooks  or  the  material  in  the

Players Guide to Faern.

City of the Spider Q ueen: You can still

play the adventure as is, but youll proba-

bly want to take advantage of the new class

features, spells, feats, and monsters in the

core rulebooks. If you want to play the City

of the Spider Q ueen adventure using the

v.3.5 revisions, spend some time converting

speci c monsters and NPCs.

Recent  Books:  Races  of  Faern  and

Unapproachable  East  anticipated  most

of the changes in the v.3.5 revision, and

Underdark  actually  came  out  after  the

revision  of  the  D&D  core  rulebooks.

You should be able to use all the material

from these three sourcebooks without dif-

 culty,  although  Chapter  1  of  this  book

presents  some  minor  updates  to  regions

and regional feats  rst released in Races

of Faern and Unapproachable East.

Vhaeraun and Selvetarm Do Battle

Whats This Book For?

In general, the v.3.5 revisions to the D&D core rulebooks do not

invalidate previous products. However, they do introduce enough

minor changessuch as the adoption of the Stealthy feat in the

Players Handbook, or the change in how hit points are calculated

for constructs, or the differences in how feats and skills are de-

termined for monstersthat it seemed appropriate to spell out

exactly how D&D v.3.5 affects the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting.

The  Players  Guide  to  Faern  incorporates  the  rules  changes

presented in the D&D v.3.5 core rulebooks and updates key in-

formation about the setting for the newest version of the rules.

The designers also searched out the best 1st and 2nd Edition

FORGOTTEN REALMS material that had not yet been updated for

3rd Edition D&D and brought much of it forward into v.3.5. If

youre a longtime fan of the setting, youll  nd that many old

favorites  appear  here  for  the   rst  time  in  many  years.  A  few

entirely new monsters, spells, prestige classes, and magic items

have been included as well, just to give you more Faern-speci c

features with which to expand your FORGOTTEN REALMS game.

Feats

regional feats, but others represent conditions or capabilities unique

to Faern, such as the Shadow Weave.

Character Region

One of the de ning characteristics of a speci c campaign setting is

that every character is from somewhere. In fact, the folk of many

of  Faerns  kingdoms,  cities,  and  wilderness  areas  are  renowned

for  their  regional  characteristicsthe  languages  they  speak,  the

weapons they favor, and the special tactics or capabilities they are

known to possess.

This book consolidates numerous race, region, and feat options

that  have  appeared  in  previous  3rd  Edition  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

supplements,  such  as  the  Altumbel  region  from  Unapproachable

East and the character races introduced in Underdark. Many of

the feats introduced in Races of Faern and Unapproachable East

are  included  on  the  region  tables  so  that  you  can  make  full  use

of those supplements with the revised region rules presented here.

However, each character region also has several feat selections that

do not rely on the previously published supplements, so you do not

need other publications to create FORGOTTEN REALMS characters.

New races from other supplements have not been reprinted here,

so if you want to play an orog or an aarakocra, for example, youll

still need to refer to Races of Faern. However, these races have

been included in the tables so that you could take advantage of the

revised region rules when using characters of these races.

How to Choose A Region

The regions described in this chapter are organized by character

race.  For  example,  if  you  are  creating  a  dwarf  character,  you

should peruse Table 13: Dwarf Regions to  nd a region suitable

for your character.

RECOMMENDED SUBRACE OR ETHNICITY

If  your  characters  homeland  is  Narfell,  shes  quite  likely  a  Nar.

The recommended subrace or ethnicity entry on the region table

indicates the speci c subrace or ethnic group usually found in that

Hundreds  of  different  cultures  sprawl  across

Faern, each marked by its own language, his-

tory, mores, technology, and magic. Both the

Nars and the Uthgardt are known as  erce barbarians, but the Nars

are mounted plains nomads who raise the hardiest horses in Faern,

while the Uthgardt are masters of the forests and mountains of the

North. A human barbarian might look very different depending on

whether he grew up in the steppes of Narfell or beneath the mist-

wreathed branches of the Cold Wood.

The system of regions offers players an opportunity to ground

their  characters  in  Faern  by  describing  the  special  advantages

and  distinguishing  characteristics  of  various  potential  home-

lands. Just as you choose a subrace or ethnic origin for your

charac ter, you can also assign a character region to describe the

characters homeland.

The choice of region answers several questions about a character.

It determines what languages he knows and provides access to spe-

cial regional feats that represent some of the particular strengths

and qualities of his people. As you become more familiar with the

FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, your characters choice of homeland

also  offers  additional  opportunities  to  develop  and  roleplay  the

character. The folk of Rashemen have a longstanding enmity with

the wizards of Thay, so a player whose character is native to Rashe-

men can roleplay a deep-seated suspicion of any Thayan character

he meets or an unreasonable fear of Thayan magic. On the other

hand, he might become determined to set aside his natural preju-

dices and judge Thayans based on their individual acts rather than

on the aggressive history of their homeland.

Since regions and feats are closely tied, this chapter also presents

the feats available to a Faernian character over and above those

in the Players Handbook. Many of the feats in this chapter are

REGIONS AND FEATS

region.  You  should  check  with  your  Dungeon  Master  before  you

assign your character a region that doesnt  t his subrace. Doing

so is not against the rules; indeed, despite the prevalence of certain

races  in  certain  areas,  Faern  is  a  diverse  land  with  many  well-

integrated cities and kingdoms. It would not be unreasonable, for

example,  for  a  gold  dwarf  character  to  have  the  human  region

of Cormyr as his native region. However, such an unusual origin

probably deserves some explanation in your characters backstory.

Perhaps the character is descended from a family of Great Rift mer-

chants or armorers who set up shop in Suzail a generation or two

ago so that they could sell their wares or handiwork to the humans

of the kingdom. Dont ignore the race recommendations entirely,

thoughif none of the characters in the campaign come from the

traditional homelands of their races, then there isnt much point

in choosing character regions to begin with.

CREATING NEW REGIONS

There is no reason you cant create additional character regions to

add greater detail to your campaign or make more options available.

The Marsh Drovers of the Marsh of Tun arent very much like the

industrious merchants and worldwise adventurers usually found in

the Western Heartlands region, so it would make sense to describe

the Marsh Drovers as a region of their own. Any population with

its own unique combination of language, talents, or technology can

constitute a region.

Region Bene ts

Choosing a region de nes a characters starting languages known

and  available  bonus  languages.  It  also  provides  two  additional

bene ts: access to regional feats and bonus equipment.

LANGUAGES

All player characters know Common. In addition, each character

knows the automatic languages listed for her region.

A  character  with  an  Intelligence  score  of  12  or  better  may

choose  bonus  languages  during  character  creation.  A  character

is entitled to one bonus language per point of initial Intelligence

bonus, so a starting Intelligence of 16 (+3 bonus) would entitle her

to three bonus languages. Bonus languages must be selected from

the list given for the characters home region.

A  character  can  always  choose  to  learn  additional  languages

beyond her automatic and bonus languages by purchasing ranks in

the Speak Language skill. Refer to Chapter 3 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting for a list of languages commonly used

in Faern.

REGIONAL FEATS

Regional  feats  represent  particular  strengths,  talents,  or  charac-

teristics  of  the  people  who  inhabit  a  region.  These  arent  bonus

featsyou can choose a regional feat only as one of your characters

1st-level  feat  choices.  You  are  not  required  to  choose  one  if  you

dont want to. You can select only one regional feat, even if you

would  normally  be  entitled  to  multiple  feat  choices  at  1st  level.

Thus, even though a 1st-level human  ghter has three feat slots

available, he may pick only one regional feat. The other two feat

slots must be  lled by nonregional feats. You may not choose re-

gional feats at character levels beyond 1st.

BONUS EQUIPMENT

Each region entry includes two options for bonus equipment. You

may choose either at 1st level, but not both. You may well  nd,

however, that neither equipment option is very enticing for your

character based on his class. This kind of situation simply re ects

the fact that some lands are known for their wizards, while others

are known for their  ghters or rogues. If you decide not to take

either package, you may take an additional 100 gp in starting funds

instead. An asterisk (*) indicates a masterwork item.

Regions and Skills

Regions also serve one additional function in a FORGOTTEN REALMS

campaignthey  de ne  how  far  the  knowledge  a  character  gains

with the Knowledge (local) skill actually extends. They also provide

the opportunity for specialization in other Knowledge skills.

When you take ranks in Knowledge (local), you must designate

the  region  to  which  your  local  knowledge  pertains.  Most  of  the

following regions can be found on Table 12: Human Regions, but

Why Regions Changed

The revision to the D&D core rulebooks incorporated several

of  the  feats  that  were  previously  exclusive  to  speci c  char-

acter  regions  (such  as  Stealthy)  into  the  Players  Handbook,

thus  making  them  available  to  all  characters.  In  addition,

experience has shown that the complicated interaction of race,

preferred class, and character class made it dif cult for players

to navigate the regional feat system and  nd the right character

combination to choose the feats they wanted.

The  revision  to  the  character  region  system  presented

here  incorporates  four  major  improvements  to  the  previ-

ous version. First, the cross-referenced tables make it much

easier  to  locate  region  and  feat  correlations  you  want  for

your character. Second, the elimination of the preferred class

step should reduce the number of false starts that resulted

from the previous region system. Third, additional regional

information  from  several  other  3rd  Edition  FORGOTTEN

REALMS supplements (such as Races of Faern, Unapproach-

able  East,  and  Underdark)  has  been  incorporated  into  the

system.  Finally,  regional  feats  have  deliberately  been  made

more attractive choices than corresponding nonregional feats

in order to reward you for grounding your character in the

FORGOTTEN REALMS setting.

some (such as Evermeet or the Smoking Mountains) are primarily

nonhuman. Thus, they appear on the region tables for other races.

The  Underdark  is  broken  up  into  seven  regions  representing

large, contiguous areas of Faerns subterranean world. A character

familiar with the Underdark beneath Halruaa would not necessarily

know much about what to  nd below the Spine of the World. These

Underdark regions are described at greater length in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS supplement Underdark.

Knowledge Synergy: If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge

(local) for a particular region, you gain a +2 bonus on all other

Knowledge skill checks pertaining to that region. For example, if

you have 5 ranks in Knowledge (Cormyr local), you gain a +2 bonus

on Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (nobil-

ity and royalty), and all other Knowledge checks made relating to

topics or questions that have to do with Cormyr.

This rule supersedes the Regional Focus rule on page 9 of the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

Region De nitions

Regions are by their very nature broad and poorly de ned. A char-

acter who grew up in a small village on the western shore of the

Dragonmere might be considered a native of Cormyr, the Dragon

Coast,  or  possibly  even  the  Western  Heartlands.  The  following

de nitions  brie y  illustrate  the  central  theme  and  assumptions

that form the basis for each region, so that you can make a more

informed choice about which is right for your character.

Some  regions  appear  in  more  than  one  racial  entry.  For  ex-

ample, the Great Glacier is both a dwarf region and a human region.

The two are not identicalthe dwarf Great Glacier region offers

access to different regional feats and equipment than the human

Great Glacier region does. The two regions represent two distinct

cultures that happen to share the same geographic area.

Information from other supplements is designated through-

out  this  chapter  with  the  following  superscript  codes:  Races  of

Faern (RAC), Unapproachable East (UNA), Underdark  (UND), and

the  FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting (FOR).

Knowledge  (Local):  Regions  that  are  contained  within  other

geographic areas, or closely tied to another geographic locale, are

represented on Table 11 by parenthetical notes that indicate which

9

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   9

12/18/03, 11:06:09 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

region they are included within for the purpose of purchasing ranks

in Knowledge (local). For example, the Forest of Lethyr elf region

is closely tied to the Great Dale human region. Therefore, its not

necessary for a character to purchase ranks in Knowledge (Forest

of Lethyr local)he or she can instead take ranks in Knowledge

(Great Dale local), which encompasses both the Forest of Lethyr

and the larger surrounding area of the Great Dale.

Humans dont see it that way. Their greatest heroes outshine the

deities themselves and sometimes become deities in their own right.

Unfortunately, the same could be said of humanitys greatest vil-

lainsand therein lies the challenge facing any human adventurer.

As with anything of value, power comes at a cost.

Racial Abilities: Human characters, regardless of region, have all

the human racial traits described in the Players Handbook.

Humans

Compared to most of the nonhuman races, whose members tend to

get along reasonably well with others of their own kind, the humans

of Faern are divided into innumerable competing nations, states,

sects, religions, bandit kingdoms, and tribes. Humans argue about

anything,   ght  about  whatever  they  argue  about,  and  hold  dear

among their many deities quite a few who actively encourage that

type of behavior.

The longer-lived elves and dwarves respect individual humans,

but they do not necessarily respect the entire race. The elves have

dif culty  forgetting  that  the   rst  human  empires  of  Netheril,

Raumathar, Narfell, and other ancient lands were built upon magi-

cal secrets borrowed or looted from their ancestors. The fact that

those early human empires invariably corrupted themselves with

evil magic does not reassure the elves. The dwarvesparticularly

the shield dwarves of northern Faernrespect humans as  erce

warriors but fear that there would be little room for dwarves in a

world dominated by humankind.

Human Ethnicities

Unlike  the  other  humanoid  races,  humans  are  not  divided  into

easily identi able subraces with distinct racial traits, though they do

vary greatly in appearance and cultural heritage. Any distinctions

among human ethnicities are inevitably muddled because centuries

of settlement and conquest have ensured that no division is abso-

lute.  Nevertheless,  seven  major  human  ethnic  groups  are  widely

recognized: Calishites, Chondathans, Damarans, Illuskans, Mulan,

Rashemis, and Tethyrians.

Calishite: These humans, descended from the slaves of Calimshans

ancient genie lords, form the primary racial stock of the Border King-

doms, the Lake of Steam cities, the Nelanther Isles, and Calimshan.

Shorter  and  slighter  in  build  than  most  other  humans,  Calishites

have  dusky  brown  skin,  hair,  and  eyes.  They  regard  themselves  as

the rightful rulers of all lands south and west of the Sea of Fallen

Stars, and they look upon northern cultures as short-lived barbarian

kingdoms barely worthy of notice. Most Calishites seek nothing more

than a lifestyle of comfort and the respect of their peers.

Chondathans: Descended from the natives of the Vilhon Reach,

these hardy folk have spread to settle most of the western and central

Inner Sea region and much of the Western Heartlands. Chondathans

form the primary racial stock of Altumbel, Cormyr, the southern

Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great Dale, Hlondeth and both

shores of the Vilhon Reach, the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, Sembia,

and Sespech. They are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair

that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and

have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. The

Chondathan  domination  of  central  Faern  came  about  largely  by

virtue of extensive trade and settlement rather than by force of arms.

Many Chondathans are merchants of one sort or another, and they

are not afraid to take risks, travel, or settle new lands.

Damarans: Proud and stubborn, these humans were born from

some  scattered  remnants  of  Narfells  fallprimarily  groups  of

Nars, Rashemis, and Sossrims who struggled to survive while waves

of Chondathan emigrants settled in the lands of the Easting Reach.

These four populations gradually coalesced into a new ethnic group

that now makes up the primary racial stock of Damara, Impiltur,

Thesk, and the Vast. Damarans are of moderate height and build,

with  skin  hues  ranging  from  tawny  to  fair.  Their  hair  is  usually

brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is

most common. Damarans see the world in stark contrastsunspeak-

able evil (often stemming from the hubris of long-fallen empires)

opposed by indomitable and uncompromising good. Most Damarans

are farmers, loggers, or miners in a harsh and unforgiving land.

Illuskans:  The  seagoing,  warlike  people  of  the  Sword  Coast

North, the Trackless Sea, and the Dessarin river valley, Illuskans

are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Among the

islands of the Trackless Sea and Icewind Dale, their hair color tends

toward blond, red, or light brown. On the mainland south of the

Spine  of  the  World,  however,  raven-black  hair  is  most  common.

Illuskans are proud, particularly of their ability to survive in the

harsh environment of their northern homelands, and they regard

most southerners as weak and decadent. Illuskans make their livings

as farmers,  shers, miners, sailors, raiders, skalds, and runecasters.

Mulan: Members of this ethnic group have dominated the eastern

shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars since the fall of ancient Imaskar. At

various times in their long history, they have made up at least the

ruling elite of Ashanath, Chessenta, the Eastern Shaar, Murghm,

Rashemen,  Semphar,  Thay,  Thesk,  and  the  Wizards  Reach  cities

south of the Yuirwood. Mulan are generally tall, slim, and sallow-

skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black

to dark brown, but all nobles and many other Mulan routinely shave

off all their hair. As a race, Mulan are arrogant, conservative, and

convinced of their cultural superiority over the rest of Faern.

Rashemis: These humans are tough, sturdy, and well adapted to

life  in  the  harsh  and  dangerous  northeastern  reaches  of  Faern.

They are descended from the nomadic tribes that won the Orcgate

Wars and built the empire of Raumathar. Not only do Rashemis

16

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   16

12/18/03, 11:10:25 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

dominate  Rashemen  and  Thay,  they  also  form  signi cant  mi-

norities in Aglarond, the Endless Wastes, Thesk, and the Wizards

Reach region. Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular, and

they usually have dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick, black hair. They

cherish their strong ties to their land, appreciating its beauty while

respecting its harshness. They display little of the arrogance that

marks other groups whose ancestors once ruled empires.

Tethyrians: The Tethyrian culture is a melting pot of Calishite,

Chondathan, Illuskan, and Low Netherese elements. This unique

background  makes  Tethyrians  among  the  most  tolerant,  though

 ercely independent, ethnic groups in Faern. They inhabit a vast

territory stretching from Calimshan to Silverymoon, and from the

Sea of Swords to the Sea of Fallen Stars. Tethyrians are of medium

build  and  height,  with  dusky  skin  that  grows  fairer  the  farther

north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies widely, but brown

hair and blue eyes are the most common. Tethyrians are proud of

their diverse heritage and protective of their freedom, so they tend

to distrust powerful kingdoms and empires.

Other  Human  Ethnicities:  Other  human  groups  in  Faern  in-

clude the Bedine nomads of Anauroch, the tall tribes of Chult, the

Durpari of the Shining South, the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles, the

Gur nomads of the Western Heartlands, the Halruaans, the ancient

Imaskari, the Lantanna people of the southern islands in the Sea

of  Swords,  the  Maztican  peoples,  the  Nar  descendants  of  ancient

Narfell, the ancient Netherese peoples, the Raumvirans of the Lake

of Mists region, the Shaaran nomads of Shaar, the Shou and other

peoples of KaraTur, the Sossrims of the far northeast, the lost Tal r

of  the  Western  Heartlands,  the  Tashalan  people  of  the  Tashtan

Coast,  the  Tuigan  nomads  of  the  Endless  Wastes,  the  Turami  of

Turmish, the Ulutiuns of the farthest northern reaches, the Vaasans

of the Moonsea and Vaasa, and the native people of Zakhara.

HUMAN REGIONS

Most  human  regions  are  described  at  length  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Aglarond: The humans of Aglarond dwell along the northern

shores of the peninsula, leaving the green Yuirwood to the elves and

half-elves.

Altumbel: Populated by clannish humans and merchant-pirates,

Altumbel lies near the center of the Sea of Fallen Stars. Knowledge

(Aglarond local).

Amn: The northernmost realm of the Lands of Intrigue, Amn

is  a  populous  and  powerful  mercantile  country  that  is  currently

dealing with an infestation of monsters.

land of noble knights and great lords.

The  Dalelands: Scattered  beneath  the  branches  of  the  ancient

forest of Cormanthor, the Dales are a series of small cantons with

a tradition of  erce independence.

Damara:  North  of  Impiltur  lies  Damara,  now  a  young  and

prosperous kingdom after decades of war against the Witch-King

of Vaasa.

Dambrath: Settled centuries ago by Nars and a small number

of Illuskans who wandered through portals in the Council Hills,

Dambrath  fell  under  the  rule  of  the  drow  city  of  Tlindhet  and

the cult of Loviatar. Humans with no drow blood are considered

servants at best.

The Dragon Coast: Home to a handful of wealthy and sophis-

ticated  city-states,  such  as  Starmantle  and  Westgate,  the  Dragon

Coast is the crossroads of Faern.

The Golden Water: The eastern lands of Estagund, Durpar, Var

the Golden, and Ulgrath lie on the shores of the Golden Water, far

to the south.

The Great Dale: Stretching for hundreds of miles between the

Forest of Lethyr and the Rawlinswood, the Great Dale is home to

reclusive clanfolk and mighty druids.

skillful hunters and nomads who survive where few others can. To

the east lies the isolated nation of Sossal, home to the cold-loving

Sossrim.

of the wizards art, Halruaa lies on the southern coast of Faern.

The Hordelands: Also known as the Endless Wastes, the Horde-

lands are home to the  erce Tuigan tribes.

Impiltur: A prosperous kingdom on the northern shore of the

Inner Sea, Impiltur has a history of con ict with the warlike hu-

manoids  of  the  nearby  mountains  and  the  forgotten  demons  of

ancient empires.

The Lake of Steam: The bustling city-states of the Lake of Steam

are wealthy and strong, but the shadow of evil gods lies over them.

Lapaliiya: The inhabitants of the Lapal League dwell along the

southeastern  shore  of  the  Shining  Sea  between  Sammaresh  and

Ormpur. Their territory reaches as far inland as the Mhair Jungles,

the Bandit Wastes, and the Dun Hills.

Lantan: Fabled as a land of mechanical wonders, Lantan lies

north of the Chultan peninsula.

The Moonsea: A grim land of smelters, foundries, and mining

camps, the Moonsea is home to the sinister cities of Zhentil Keep

and Mulmaster.

The  Moonshae  Isles: West  of  Faern  lie  the  Moonshae  Isles,

whose  population  is  divided  between  the  native  Ffolk  and  the

invading Illuskans.

Mulhorand: This ancient land lies at the eastern end of the Sea

of Fallen Stars. For many centuries, undying god-kings have ruled

as pharaohs here.

REGIONS AND FEATS

to Llorkh and from Red Larch to Mirabar. The folk of Neverwin-

ter, Luskan, and Baldurs Gate are described by the Sword Coast

region, Silverymoon describes the people of the Silver Marches, and

Waterdeep includes the lower Dessarin Vale.

Nimbral:  This  mysterious  land  of  Halruaan  expatriates  is

cloaked in a veil of illusion. The Land of the Flying Hunt is best

known for its glass-armored, pegasus-mounted warriors.

Rashemen: A wild and beautiful land of the distant east, Rashe-

men is home to  erce berserkers and mysterious masked spellcasters

known as the Witches of Rashemen (referred to as the wychlaran

by the Rashemis themselves).

The  Ride:  North  of  the  Moonsea  and  south  of  the  Tortured

Land lies the broad green swale known as the Ride, which is home

to numerous roaming barbarian tribes.

Samarach: In the Sanrach basin on the southern shore of the Chul-

tan  peninsula  lies  the  xenophobic  nation  of  Samarach,  a  vassal

state of Nimbral.

Sembia:  Perhaps  the  wealthiest  and  most  powerful  kingdom

west of the Inner Sea, Sembia is a sophisticated land of duelists,

merchants, and thieves.

The Shaar: This vast savanna stretches for more than 1,000

miles  across  southern  Faern.  The  Shaar  is  home  to  numer-

ous  nomadic  tribes,  though  it  also  supports  a  handful  of  more

permanent settlements.

Shadovar: The folk of the City of Shade are known as Shadovars.

Their  ying city is currently grounded on the shores of the Shadow

Sea in the heart of Anauroch.

Shou  Expatriate:  Many  strange  kingdoms  and  empires  lie  far

to the east of Faern, at the end of the Golden Way. From these

distant lands, a small number of merchants, settlers, and diplomats

have come to Faern in search of new opportunities in the West.

Knowledge (Thesk local).

Silverymoon: Often called the Gem of the North, Silverymoon is

a city of magic and learning on the Rauvin River in the far North.

It is the leading city of the Silver Marches, a league of human cities

and dwarf citadels.

The Sword Coast: Stretching from Luskan in the north to Baldurs

Gate in the south, the Sword Coast is a region of isolated city-states,

 ercely competitive in commerce and prone to open brigandage.

Tashalar: Located on the northern shores of the Chultan penin-

sula, Tashalar is a sun-soaked land of olive groves, vineyards, and

powerful merchant houses. It is threatened by the insidious yuan-ti

of the nearby jungles.

Tethyr: This large kingdom of noble knights and great lords was

recently reunited under the rule of a king and queen after a terrible

civil war.

Tharsult: The island nation of Tharsult serves as a center for

shipborne trade across the Shining Sea.

Thay: A forbidding and mysterious realm of the Unapproachable

along the Golden Way, Thesk is plagued by the Shadowmasters of

Tel amm, a powerful thieves guild.

Thindol: On the southern coast of the Chultan peninsula lies this

merchant nation populated by  eet-of-foot Tashalans and Chultans.

Turmish:  A  prosperous  land  on  the  northern  shores  of  the

Vilhon Reach, Turmish is dominated by the Turami.

Underdark (Old Shanatar): Generations of humans from Calim-

shan and the Lake of Steam have been enslaved by the beholders

of  Zokir  and  the  drow  of  Guallidurth.  Many  escaped  into  the

Underdark  wilds,  led  by  Ibrandul  the  Skulking  God.  However,

they continue to make their homes in the lightless lands that have

become their home.

Unther:  One  of  the  three  Old  Empires  of  southeast  Faern,

Unther was ruled for centuries by the evil god-king Gilgeam, who

perished  in  the  Time  of  Troubles.  Now  Unther  is  disintegrating

from the twin pressures of a Mulhorandi invasion and the squabbles

of its own nobles and priests.

Uthgardt Tribesfolk: The Uthgardt barbarians roam the forests

and hills of the North. Knowledge (North local).

Vaasa: A cold, hard land formerly ruled by the terrible Witch-

King, Vaasa is no longer a bastion of evilbut neither is it a place for

those who arent ready to defend themselves with sword and spell.

The  Vast:  Home  to  small,  independent  city-states  such  as

Tantras and Ravens Bluff, the Vast is renowned as a land where

adventurers can make names for themselves.

The Vilhon Reach: Dominated by the old and decrepit realm of

Chondath, the Vilhon Reach is a land of contradictions. A constant

con ict simmers between sophisticated merchant-lords and a power-

ful druid circle that is determined to limit human expansion.

Waterdeep:  Known  as  the  greatest  city  of  the  Sword  Coast,

Waterdeep  is  a  cosmopolitan  metropolis  of  bustling  commerce,

skulking  rogues,  and  mighty  wizards.  It  sits  above  the  dread-

ful  maze  known  as  the  Undermountain,  which  has  long  been  a

destination of interest for adventurers.

The Western Heartlands: Stretching from the Dragon Coast to

the lower reaches of the Chionthar Vale, the Western Heartlands

is home to scattered settlements and homesteads as well as caravan

cities such as Iriaebor and Scornubel.

The  Wizards  Reach:  Along  the  southern  coast  of  the  Aglar-

ondan peninsula lie the cities of the Wizards Reach, a group of

independent city-states long coveted (and contested) by Chessenta,

Unther, and Thay.

DWARF REGIONS

Most of Faerns dwarves hail from one of the following areas.

Chult: The wild dwarves reside in the Jungles of Chult, as well

as in the nearby Mhair Jungle.

The Galena Mountains: Flanked by Impiltur, Damara, and the Vast,

the Galena Mountains (and the nearby Earthspur Mountains) are home

to numerous shield dwarf delvings. Knowledge (Damara local).

The Great Glacier: The fabled Inugaakalikurit, or arctic dwarves,

dwell in the icebound mountain ranges of the Great Glacier.

The Great Rift: Mightiest of all dwarf realms, the Great Rift is the

ancestral homeland of the gold dwarves. Knowledge (Shaar local).

Oldonnar: The fabled kingdom of Oldonnar, home of the rare

urdunnir (or orecutter) dwarves, lies beneath the Alamir Moun-

tains. Knowledge (Underdark [Old Shanatar] local).

volcanic  res of the Smoking Mountains and the Black Ash Plain

The  Spine  of  the  World:  Home  to  some  of  the  most  famous

shield dwarf kingdoms of the North, this region includes strong-

holds  such  as  Citadel  Adbar,  Citadel  Felbarr,  and  Mithral  Hall.

Knowledge (Silver Marches local).

The  Sword  Coast:  Many  shield  dwarf  merchants,  smiths,  and

weaponmakers live in human cities such as Mirabar and Neverwin-

ter along the Sword Coast.

Turmish: The Aphrunn Mountains and Orsraun Mountains are

home to many shield dwarves.

Underdark  (Darklands):  Dunspeirrin,  a  powerful  duergar  city

below the Orsraun Mountains, is one of the oldest and strongest

gray  dwarf  realms.  A  gray  dwarf  from  any  city  revering  Deep

Duerra could choose this region, particularly if he is interested in

the study of psionics.

Underdark (Earthroot): Deep beneath the Earthspur Mountains

lie the remnants of the shield dwarf kingdom called Earthfast.

Underdark (Northdark): Gracklstugh, the Deepkingdom of the

duergar, lies below the Evermoors. Any gray dwarf native to a city

where Laduguer is worshiped in preference to Deep Duerra could

select this region.

Underdark (Old Shanatar): Ancient Shanatar, once the homeland

of  the  shield  dwarves,  fell  many  centuries  ago.  But  Iltkazar,  the

Mithral Kingdom, still remains.

Waterdeep: Several large and prosperous shield dwarf clans in-

habit Waterdeep and its immediate environs, including the Forlorn

Hills and the Sword Mountains.

REGIONS AND FEATS

ELF REGIONS

Countless  elves  have  retreated  to  the  seclusion  of  Evermeet,  but

many others still remain in Faern.

The Chondalwood: Once home to the green elf realm of Nikery-

math, the Chondalwood is now the home of several roving tribes

of wild elves.

Cormanthor Drow: Drawn by the promise of ancient surface elf

magic, the drow of House Jaelre and the Auzkovyn Clan have occu-

pied old strongholds deep in the forest. Knowledge (Dalelands local).

Elven Court: Not all of Cormanthyrs surface elves have aban-

doned their ancient home. Many moon elves, wood elves, and wild

elves still remain in places such as Semberholme, Tangled Trees, and

the old Elven Court itself. Knowledge (Dalelands local).

Evereska:  Laid  waste  by  the  onslaught  of  Anaurochs

phaerimms,  this  realm  of  moon  and  sun  elves  is  slowly  recover-

ing from the furious battles of the last year. Knowledge (Western

Heartlands local).

Evermeet:  Far  over  the  western  ocean  lies  the  fabulous  isle

of Evermeet,  nal refuge and stronghold of the gold, silver, and

green elves.

The Forest of Lethyr: Tribes of wood elves hide deep in the for-

ests of the Unapproachable East. Knowledge (Great Dale local).

The High Forest: Once divided among the ancient elf kingdoms

of  Eaerlann,  Siluvanede,  and  Sharrven,  the  High  Forest  is  now

home to the most numerous and vigorous populations of moon and

wood elves remaining in northern Faern.

The Inner Sea: Dozens of aquatic elf settlements, including the

great city of Myth Nantar, lie scattered through the waters of the

western and central Sea of Fallen Stars.

Menzoberranyr:  The  city  of  Menzoberranzan,  located  miles

below  the  upper  Surbrin  Vale,  is  perhaps  the  most  notorious  of

Faerns drow realms. A drow from any Lolth-dominated city could

choose this region. Knowledge (Underdark [Northdark] local).

The Outer Sea: West of Faern lies the Trackless Sea, and south

of Faern lies the Great Sea. Both are home to many aquatic elves.

Sildyuir:  The  extraplanar  realm  of  Sildyuir,  located  in  the

depths of the Yuirwood, is home to the reclusive star elves. Knowl-

edge (Aglarond local).

Silverymoon: Also  known  as  the  Gem  of  the  North,  the  city

of Silverymoon is a beacon of hope, safety, and learning amid the

wilds of the North. It is home to a large number of moon elves.

Knowledge (Silver Marches local).

Snow Eagle Aerie: The hidden refuge of the avariels lies beyond

the  frozen  peaks  of  the  Icerim  Mountains  in  northeast  Faern.

Knowledge (Sossal local).

Waterdeep: Many moon elves reside in the forests and hills of

the lower Delimibiyr and Dessarin Vales. They frequent the bus-

tling human city of Waterdeep.

The Wealdath: Home to wild elves and wood elves, the Wealdath

makes up a large part of the human country of Tethyr.

The Yuirwood: Though many of the Yuirwoods elves are star

elves  who  shelter  in  Sildyuir,  the  Yuirwood  itself  is  home  to  a

number of wild elves. Knowledge (Aglarond local).

GNOME REGIONS

Sometimes referred to as the Forgotten Folk, gnomes are found in

many places across Faern, though their population is signi cant

in only a handful of spots.

The Great Dale: Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are common

in the Unapproachable East.

Lantan: Home to the largest population of gnomes in Faern,

Lantan  is  an  island  nation  of  wondrous  invention  and  bustling

commerce that lies north of the Chultan peninsula.

Thesk: The city-state of Milvarune and the surrounding Drag-

onjaw Mountains are home to many large clans of rock gnomes.

Underdark (Northdark): A svirfneblin city now in ruins, Bling-

denstone lies beneath the lower Rauvin Vale in the North. Smaller

deep gnome settlements are scattered throughout the northern Un-

derdark. A deep gnome from any city similar to what Blingdenstone

was before its ruin could choose this region.

The  Western  Heartlands:  Scattered  gnome  villages  and  settle-

ments exist throughout the vales of the River Chionthar and the

Winding Water.

HALF-ELF REGIONS

A half-elf raised by one parent or the other could reasonably call

any elf or human region home. However, the following regions are

known for their half-elf populations.

Aglarond: The Yuirwood is home to the largest population of

half-star elves and half-wild elves in Faern.

The  Dalelands:  While  half-elves  are  common  in  many  of  the

Dales, the land of Deepingdale is home to more half-moon elves and

half-wood elves than any other place for hundreds of miles around.

Dambrath: A human nation conquered by drow centuries ago,

Dambrath is now home to a large number of half-drow.

The Dragon Coast: Small numbers of half-aquatic elves can be

found in almost any of the lands around the Sea of Fallen Stars,

but more of them dwell off the shorelands of Cormyr, the Dragon

Coast, and Sembia than elsewhere.

The High Forest: The High Forest and the city of Loudwater

are home to many half-moon elves and half-wood elves descended

from citizens of the ancient elf kingdoms of Eaerlann, Siluvanede,

and Sharrven. A handful of half-drow dwell in the High Forest in

the ruined city of Karse.

Silverymoon: Heir to the long-lost elf kingdoms of the North,

Silverymoon is home to many who have both moon elf and human

blood. Knowledge (Silver Marches local).

Waterdeep:  Elves  and  humans  have  lived  side  by  side  on  the

Sword  Coast  for  many  centuries,  so  half-moon  elves  are  fairly

common in the City of Splendors.

REGIONS AND FEATS

HALFLING REGIONS

Hal ings  roam  throughout  Faern,  settling  in  various  human-

dominated lands for short periods before moving on. True hal ing

homelands include the following regions.

Amn: The hal ing realm of Mieritin once stood on the east-

ern shore of Lake Esmel. Many lightfoot hal ings still inhabit

this region.

Calimshan: Lightfoot hal ings were brought to Calimshan mil-

lennia ago as slaves of the djinn, and many still inhabit this region.

Channath Vale: Between the western Shaar and the myste-

rious land of Halruaa lies the valley of the River Channath

and the Forest of Amtar. Ghostwise and strongheart halflings

are common in the small villages of this region. Knowledge

(Shaar local).

The  Chondalwood:  Homeland  of  the  ghostwise  hal ings  for

more  than  a  thousand  years,  the  Chondalwood  is  a  large,  warm

woodland south of Chondath and Chessenta.

Luiren:  The  southerly  nation  of  Luiren  is  the  home  of  the

strongheart hal ings and the origin of all of Faerns hin.

The North: Lightfoot hal ings settlements dot the banks of the

lower Delimbiyr Vale, though they are most concentrated around

the village of Secomber.

The  Western  Heartlands:  Hal ing  settlers  can  be  found

throughout the Western Heartlands, primarily in the vale west of

the Far Hills.

ORC AND HALF-ORC REGIONS

Like half-elves, half-orcs can be found in small numbers almost

anywhere. Half-orcs dont have any realms they can truly call their

own, but large and stable populations of this  erce folk can be found

throughout central and northern Faern.

Amn: Amn has long been plagued by humanoid raiders who lair

in the mountain ranges surrounding the country.

Chessenta: The cities of Airspur and Reth, as well as the nearby

mountains,  are  home  to  many  orc  tribes  that  have  warred  and

traded with the humans of Chessenta for centuries.

The Hordelands: The gray orcs of the east can be found in roving

bands from the Great Glacier to the borderlands of Murghm.

REGIONS AND FEATS

Impiltur: Nar demonbinders brought many demons to the East-

ing Reach, and the tie ing progeny of those visitors can now be

found in the hinterlands of Impiltur.

Mulhorand: Ruled by incarnations of their deities for thousands

of years, many of the folk of Mulhorand have a trace of the divine

in their heritage.

The Silver Marches: Demons ruled Hellgate Keep for centuries,

and their tie ing descendants can now be found across the Silver

Marches and upper Delimbiyr Vale.

Thay:  For  centuries,  the  powerful  wizards  of  Thay  have  bred

their slaves with outsiders of various types in an effort to create

the perfect servitors.

Unther: Like the folk of Mulhorand, the people of Unther were

ruled by incarnate gods who often took mortals as spouses.

The  Western  Heartlands:  Since  the  opening  of  a  portal  to  the

Nine  Hells  in  the  Year  of  the  Worm,  increasing  numbers  of

devil-spawned  tie ings  have  been  encountered  in  the  vicinity  of

Dragonspear Castle.

OTHER RACIAL REGIONS

The following regions are provided for the more unusual character

races, such as those introduced in Races of Faern, Unapproachable

East, or Underdark.

Feats

Characters  in  a  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign  have  access  to  a

number of unique feats that re ect the special talents, tricks, and

lore  of  Faerns  people.  All  the  feats  described  below  follow  the

format of feats in the Players Handbook.

Regional Feats

A regional feat is a feat that represents a special, exclusive ca-

pability  or  talent  found  among  the  people  of  a  particular  place,

ethnicity, or other specialized grouping. Regional feats are identi ed

by the Regional designation following the name of the feat.

Each  regional  feat  speci es  one  or  more  character  race  and

region  combinations  as  prerequisites.  To  select  such  a  feat,  your

character  must  meet  one  such  set  of  prerequisites.  For  example,

to select a feat whose regional prerequisite is Dwarf (Spine of the

World), your character must be a dwarf whose home region is the

Spine of the World.

When you choose a home region during character creation, you

can select one regional feat from the list available to characters of

your homeland. Even if you can choose more than one feat at 1st

level (a human or strongheart hal ing gets two feats at 1st level),

you can never have more than one regional feat.

Regional feats are not bonus feats; you must use normal feat slots

to select them.

Arcane Preparation [General]

You  can  prepare  an  arcane  spell  ahead  of  time  just  as  a  wizard

does. When you do so, you need not take any extra time to apply

metamagic feats upon casting that spell.

32

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   32

12/18/03, 11:23:59 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

Prerequisite: Ability to cast arcane spells without preparation.

Bene t: Each day, you can use one or more of your spell slots to

prepare spells you know. (Usually, you do this in order to apply a

metamagic feat to the spell.) Thereafter, you can cast that spell as

a standard action even if you apply a metamagic feat to the spell

as you cast it. Preparing a spell uses a slot of the appropriate level.

Once the spell is prepared, you cant use that spell slot for anything

else until you cast the prepared spell.

Normal: A sorcerer or bard who applies a metamagic feat to a spell

must cast it as a full-round action instead of a standard action.

Arcane Schooling [Regional]

In your homeland, all who show some skill at the Art may receive

training as arcane spellcasters. Thus, many characters know some-

thing of the ways of the bard, the sorcerer, or the wizard.

Prerequisite: Deep Imaskari (Underdark [Deep Imaskar]), human

(Chessenta, the Golden Water, Halruaa, Lantan, Mulhorand, Nim-

bral, Unther, or the Wizards Reach), or planetouched (Chessenta).

Bene t: Choose one arcane spellcasting class (bard, sorcerer, or

wizard). You can activate spell trigger magic items as if you had 1

level in the selected class. The selected class also becomes a favored

class  for  you  in  addition  to  any  other  favored  class  you  have  or

select. For example, a multiclass human  ghter/rogue who selects

wizard for this feat could add levels of wizard without taking any

experience penalty for multiclassing in three classes.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Artist [Regional]

Your people are renowned for their skill at story and song.

Prerequisite: Elf (Sildyuir or Snow Eagle Aerie), Gnome (Thesk

or  the  Western  Heartlands),  half-elf  (the  Dalelands),  or  human

(Chessenta, Waterdeep, or the Western Heartlands).

Bene t: You gain a +2 bonus on all Perform checks and on checks

with one Craft skill that involves art, such as calligraphy, painting,

sculpture,  or  weaving.  In  addition,  if  you  have  the  bardic  music

ability, you may use it three additional times per day. For example,

a 3rd-level bard with this feat could use her bardic music ability six

times per day.

Normal: A bard can use her bardic music ability once per day per

bard level.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Axethrower [Regional]

You have learned how to hurl heavy weapons to deadly effect.

Prerequisite: Dwarf (the Great Glacier), human (the Great Glacier,

the Moonshae Isles, the North, or Vaasa), lizardfolk (Surkh), or orc

(the Moonsea or Underdark [Northdark]).

Regional Feats and Previously Published Material

The  region  system  described  here  updates  and  replaces  the

region  system  and  regional  feats  described  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS  Campaign  Setting.  However,  additional  regions  and

regional feats have also appeared in Races of Faern and Unap-

proachable East. Any feat from either of those publications that

includes a Region line should be considered a regional feat and

is subject to the same selection restrictions as other feats with

the Regional designation.

The region system in this book limits each character to one

and only one regional feat that must be selected at 1st level. This

rule  replaces  the  one  on  page  28  of  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign  Setting  that  allows  a  character  to  learn  another

regional  feat  for  each  2  ranks  in  Knowledge  (local)  she  has.

The regional feats presented herein are designed with the intent

that a character has access to only one. Allowing a character to

choose more than one may unbalance the system.

If you examine the region tables that follow in this chapter,

youll  nd that all feats identi ed as regional feats in previous

material  appear  on  the  tables  in  the  appropriate  regions.  The

region and feat assignments given in this book supersede those

in all previous publications. For example, the Shadow Shield feat

from Races of Faern gives the Tethyrian human and Western

Heartlands regions as its prerequisites. In this book, it appears in

33

the Western Heartlands region as a potential regional feat selec-

tion. Theres no reason you cant choose Shadow Shield as one

of your regional feats, provided that you meet the requirements

spelled out in this book. However, not all the feat descriptions

from other publications have been reprinted here, so youll need

to refer to Races of Faern for information on that feat.

Unless speci cally replaced or addressed in this book, most

feats  from  other  previously  published  supplements  are  usable

without alteration. The exceptions are as follows.

Berserker  Lodge  Feats  and  Rashemi  Elemental  Summoning

(Unapproachable  East):  As  long  as  Rashemen  is  your  home

region, you can select berserker lodge feats or Rashemi Elemental

Summoning,  provided  that  your  character  meets  the  other  re-

quirements. These feats dont count as regional feats, but you must

be able to select regional feats from Rashemen to learn them.

Stoneblood (Races of Faern): Remove the region requirement

from this feat; its available to any urdunnir dwarf.

Stonewalker  Fist  (Races  of  Faern):  Remove  the  region  re-

quirement from this feat; its available to any urdunnir dwarf.

Swarm ghting (Races of Faern): The wild dwarf description

incorrectly identi es Swarm ghting as a regional feat. You can

choose it if you meet the prerequisites, regardless of your race

or region.

choosing.

Prerequisite: Any other metamagic feat.

speak of city folk.

hal ing  (Amn),  or  human  (Amn,  the

Dauntless [Regional]

You can stand up to greater punishment than

most and still keep on going.

Prerequisite:  Dwarf  (the  Galena  Mountains,  the  Smoking

Mountains,  Turmish,  Underdark  [Earthroot],  or  Underdark  [Old

Shanatar]),  human  (Damara,  the  Great  Dale,  Impiltur,  or  the

Moonshae Isles), lizardfolk (Surkh), orc (Amn, Chessenta, or Vaasa),

or slyth (Underdark [Fluvenilstra]).

Bene t: You gain +5 hit points.

Special:  You  may  not  select  this  feat  more  than  once,  but  its

bene t stacks with Toughness. You may select this feat only as a

Daylight Adaptation [Regional]

You  have  accustomed  yourself  to  the  painful  sunlight  of  the

surface world.

Prerequisite: Dwarf (Underdark [Northdark]), elf (Cormanthor

Drow), kuo-toa (Underdark [Sloopdilmonpolop]), or orc  (Chessenta,

the Hordelands, the North, or Thesk).

Bene : Unlike other members of your race, you are not dazzled

or blinded by exposure to bright light or sunlight. However, spells

Daylight Adaptation

Bene t: A delayed spell doesnt activate until 1 to 5 rounds after

you   nish  casting  it.  You  determine  the  delay  when  you   nish

casting  the  spell,  and  it  cannot  be  changed  once  set.  The  spell

activates just before your turn on the round you designate. Only

personal or touch range spells and those with areas can be affected

by this feat.

Any decisions you would normally make about the spell (includ-

ing attack rolls, designating targets, or determining or shaping an

area) must be made when the spell is cast. Any effects resolved by

the subject (including saving throws) are determined when the spell

triggers.  If  conditions  change  between  casting  and  triggering  in

such a fashion as to make the spell impossible (for example, if the

target you designate leaves the spells area or moves out of range

before it goes off), the spell fails.

A  delayed  spell  may  be  dispelled  normally  during  the  delay

period, and spells such as detect magic can detect it normally in

the area or on the target. A delayed spell uses up a slot three levels

higher than the spells actual level.

Dreadful Wrath [Regional]

You are terrible to behold in battle, and few foes have the heart to

Prerequisite:  Human  (Rashemen),  kuo-toa  (Underdark  [Sloop-

dilmonpolop]),  or  planetouched  (Impiltur,  the  Silver  Marches,

1/2 your character level + your Cha modi er) or be shaken for 1

all your future classes. You may also select two Knowledge skills to

those skills. If you select a Knowledge skill in which you do not yet

have ranks, you gain no immediate bene t, since Knowledge skills

can  be  used  only  with  training.  But  the  selection  still  represents

your improved potential for that skill.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Ethran [Regional]

as a member of the Ethran (the untrained).

10 feet. This bene t applies only when you are wearing no armor or

modifying your speed for any load carried.

Special: If a feature of your character class also improves your

land speed, the speed increase for Fleet of Foot stacks with that

provided by the class feature.

You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You may

have only one regional feat.

Foe Hunter [Regional]

In a land threatened by  erce raiders, you have learned to  ght

effectively against certain foes. You know their ways and how to

12/18/03, 11:28:02 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

Bene t: Choose a spell that you know. You can now use this spell

three times per day as a spell-like ability. If the innate spell has an XP

cost, you pay that cost each time you use the spell. If it has a focus,

that amount to use as a focus for the spell-like ability. Otherwise, you

need no components to use the innate spell as a spell-like ability.

You must permanently assign one spell slot of the appropriate

spell level to the innate spell. You cant use this spell slot for any-

thing elsethat is, you can cast one fewer spell per day at that spell

level than you could if you didnt have an innate spell. For example,

if you could normally cast three 3rd-level spells per day and you

choose  reball as your innate spell, you can now cast only two 3rd-

level spells per day, but you gain three uses per day of  reball as a

spell-like ability.

Special: You can choose this feat more than once, selecting a dif-

ferent innate spell each time.

Inscribe Rune [Item Creation]

You can create magic runes that hold spells until triggered.

Prerequisites:  Int  13,  appropriate  Craft  skill,  divine  spellcaster

level 3rd.

Bene t: You can cast any divine spell you have access to as a rune.

You must have prepared the spell to be scribed and must provide any

material components or focuses the spell requires. If casting the spell

would reduce your XP total, you pay that cost upon beginning the

rune in addition to the XP cost for making the rune itself. Likewise,

material components are consumed when you begin writing the rune,

but focuses are not. See Rune Magic in Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting for details on runes and rune magic.

A  single  object  of  Medium  size  or  smaller  can  hold  only  one

rune. A larger object can hold one rune per 25 square feet of surface

area. Runes cannot be placed on creatures, although they can be

drawn on equipment a creature carries.

The rune has a price equal to its spell level  caster level  50 gp.

(A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 level.) You must spend 1/25 of the

price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half the price to

inscribe the rune.

Note: The rune cost multiple given here (50 gp) supersedes the

one given in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting (100 gp).

creatures employing spells or spell-like abilities are considered Weave

users unless they possess the Shadow Weave Magic feat.

This bene t does not extend to spells you cast from the schools

of evocation or transmutation.

Prerequisite:  Bugbear  (the  Earthfast  Mountains),  chitine  (Un-

derdark  [Yathchol]),  goblin  (the  Earthfast  Mountains),  half-elf

hobgoblin  (the  Earthfast  Mountains),  human  (Anauroch,  Dam-

brath,  the  Lake  of  Steam,  or  the  Sword  Coast),  orc  (Thesk),  or

planetouched (Chessenta).

Bene t: You can use a light weapon to attack your opponent in

a grapple with no penalty on the attack roll. In addition, you need

not win a grapple check to draw a light weapon while grappling,

although you still must use a move action to do so. If your base

attack  bonus  is  +6  or  higher,  you  can  make  a  full  attack  with  a

light weapon while grappling, provided that you already have your

weapon drawn.

Normal: A character in a grapple takes a 4 penalty on attack

rolls when attacking the grappled opponent with a light weapon. A

character in a grapple must win a grapple check in order to draw a

weapon and cannot make a full attack in the round she does so.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

come through.

wood),  gloamingUND  (Sphur  Upra),  half-elf  (Aglarond),  hal ing

Weave users to detect.

Prerequisite: Shadow Weave Magic.

Bene t: Any Weave user who employs a divination spell (such as

detect magic), spell-like ability, or magic item that could detect the

magical aura of one of your spells must make a successful level check

(DC 11 + your caster level) to succeed. Similarly, a Weave user at-

tempting to reveal the effects of one of your spells via a divination

spell (such as see invisibility) must make a caster level check to succeed.

The Weave user may check only once for each divination spell used, no

matter how many of your spell effects are operating in that area. All

Magic in the Blood [Regional]

You have a knack for getting the most out of your innate magical

abilities. You can use them more often than others of your race can.

Prerequisite:  Dwarf  (Oldonnar  or  Underdark  [Darklands]),  elf

(Menzoberranyr),  gnome  (the  Great  Dale,  Thesk,  or  Underdark

wizard  (your  choice,  so  long  as  you

have a score of at least 10 in the

ability  that  controls  the  spell-

casting  for  that  class).  You  must

make this decision when you  rst take the

feat. Thereafter, you have an arcane spell

failure  chance  if  you  wear  armor  and

are treated as a sorcerer or wizard of

your arcane spellcaster level (minimum

1st) for the purpose of determining level-based

variables of the spells you cast.

If  you  choose  to  cast

spells  as  a  sorcerer,  the

DC for saves against your

spells is 10 + your Cha modi er.

You know two 0-level spells of your

choice from the sorcerer/wizard list.

If you choose to cast spells as a wizard, the DC

for saves against your spells is 10 + your Int modi er. You have a

spellbook with three 0-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer/

a +1 insight bonus to Armor Class.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

REGIONS AND FEATS

Bene t:  You  are  a  native  outsider,  not  a  humanoid.  You  have

darkvision out to 60 feet. Furthermore, you gain a +2 bonus on all

Diplomacy checks.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

be aware of the mere presence or absence of the thing detected, but

you must still concentrate to gain additional information as normal.

Concentration  on  such  a  spell  is  a  standard  action  that  does  not

provoke an attack of opportunity. A persistent spell uses up a spell

slot six levels higher than the spells actual level.

Pernicious Magic [Metamagic]

You  can  use  the  Shadow  Weave  to  make

your  spells  harder  for  Weave  users  to

resist.

Prerequisite: Shadow Weave Magic.

Bene t:  You  gain  a  +4  bonus  on

caster  level  checks  made  to  defeat

a  Weave  users  spell  resistance.  All

creatures  employing  spells  or  spell-

like  abilities  are  considered  Weave

users  unless  they  possess  the  Shadow

Weave  Magic  feat.  This  bene t  stacks

with those from the Spell Penetration and

Greater  Spell  Penetration  feats,  but  it  does

not extend to spells you cast from the schools

of evocation or transmutation.

Persistent Spell

[Metamagic]

You can make a spell last all day.

Prerequisite: Extend Spell.

Bene t:  A  persistent  spell  has  a

not concentrate on spells such as detect magic or detect  thoughts to

Otherworldly

Portal Master [Item Creation]

You  are  especially  pro cient  at  creating  portalspermanent

magic devices that instantaneously transport those who know

their secrets from one locale to another. Faern is riddled

with portals.

Prerequisite: Craft Wondrous Item.

Bene t: When you build a portal, you pay only

50% of the normal cost to create the device. This

bene t does not stack with that provided by the

Magical Artisan feat.

In  addition,  you  know  how  to  pass  through

dangerous  portals  safely.  As  a  standard  action,

you can attempt to stabilize a malfunctioning

portal  temporarily.  Make  a  Spellcraft  check

and add the check result to the d% roll for

the effect of the malfunctioning portal (see

Table  22  in  Chapter  2  of  the  FORGOTTEN

Changes to Feats from the Campaign Setting

In addition to overhauling the regional feat system, this chapter

also introduces a small number of changes to other feats from the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. Most of these alterations

are minor changes to the wording for clarity, but some of the key

changes include the following.

Courteous Magocracy: The name of this feat has changed to

Spellwise, since its revision doesnt have much to do with cour-

tesy.

Create Portal: Portals are now considered wondrous items and

are  built  with  the  Craft  Wondrous  Item  feat.  The  new  Portal

Master feat makes it easier for a character to build a portal.

Forester:  The  bene t  of  the  Forester  feat  was  incorporated

into Self-Suf cient, which appears in the Players Handbook. The

version appearing here now works differently.

Greater Spell Focus: This feat is not included here because its

in the Players Handbook.

Greater  Spell  Penetration: This  feat  is  not  included  here  be-

cause its in the Players Handbook.

Improved Counterspell: This feat is not included here because

its in the Players Handbook.

Improved Familiar: This feat is not reprinted in its entirety

here because it appears in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Stealthy:  This  feat  has  been  incorporated  into  the  Players

Handbook. The Swift and Silent feat replaces it here.

42

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   42

12/18/03, 11:36:26 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

Bene t: Once per round, you can counterspell an opponents spell

even if you have not readied an action to do so. This counterspell

action  takes  the  place  of  your  next  turn.  You  cant  use  this  feat

when you are  at-footed.

Normal: Without this feat, you must ready an action each round

that you wish to use a counterspell.

Resist Poison [Regional]

Your people have become inured to many deadly substances through

controlled exposure or the simple hostility of your home environ-

ment. You can shrug off poisons that would kill someone else.

Prerequisite: Bugbear (the Earthfast Mountains), chitine (Under-

dark  [Yathchol]),  dwarf  (Underdark  [Northdark]),  goblin  (the

Earth fast Mountains), hobgoblin (the Earthfast Mountains), human

(Dambrath or Lapaliiya), or orc (the Moonsea or the North).

Bene t: You get a +4 bonus on Fortitude saving throws against

poison.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Saddleback [Regional]

Youve  spent  endless  hours  learning  how  to  handle  a  mount  in

a  ght.

Prerequisites: Human (Cormyr, Dambrath, the Hordelands, Narfell,

Nimbral, the North, the Western Heartlands).

Bene t: You can take 10 on Ride checks, even if you are rushed

or threatened.

If either you or your mount fails a Re ex save while mounted,

you  can  attempt  a  Ride  check  to  succeed  on  the  saving  throw

anyway.  The  save  is  successful  if  your  Ride  check  result  is  equal

to or greater than the spells save DC. (Essentially, you can sub-

stitute your Ride check result for your Re ex save if the former is

higher.) You can attempt this substitution once per round for either

yourself or your mount. If both you and your mount fail a Re ex

save against the same effect (for example, a  reball spell or dragon

breath  that  catches  you  and  your  mount  in  its  area),  your  Ride

check result applies to both your save and your mounts save.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Shadow Weave Magic [General]

You have discovered the dangerous secret of the Shadow Weave.

Prerequisite: Wis 15 or patron deity Shar.

Bene t:  From  now  on,  your  spells  tap  the  Shadow  Weave  in-

stead of the Weave. You can also activate magic items that use the

Shadow Weave without taking damage.

The saving throw for every spell you cast from the schools of

enchantment, illusion, and necromancy increases by +1. You also get

a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with

spells from these schools.

The Shadow Weave proves less than optimal for effects involving

energy or matter. Your effective caster level for spells you cast from

the schools of evocation or transmutation (except spells with the

darkness descriptor) is reduced by one. A 1st-level Shadow Weave

user cannot cast spells from these schools at all.

You can no longer cast spells with the light descriptor. No matter

what school they are from, such spells automatically fail. Your abil-

ity to use magic items that produce light effects is also limitedyou

cannot invoke an items light power if its activation method is spell

completion or spell trigger.

From now on, any magic item you create is a Shadow Weave item

(see Chapter 2 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting).

Signature Spell [General]

You are so familiar with a mastered spell that you can convert other

prepared spells into that spell.

Prerequisite: Spell Mastery.

Bene t:  Choose  one  spell  that  you  have  mastered  with  the  Spell

Mastery feat as your signature spell. You may now convert prepared

arcane spells of that spells level or higher into your signature spell, just

as a good cleric can spontaneously cast prepared spells as cure spells.

Special: You can gain Signature Spell multiple times. Each time

you take the feat, it applies to a different mastered spell.

Silver Palm [Regional]

Your culture is based on haggling and the art of the deal.

Prerequisite:  Dwarf  (the  Great  Rift,  Turmish,  or  Waterdeep),

hal ing (Amn), or human (Amn, the Dragon Coast, the Golden

Water, Sembia, Tharsult, Thesk, the Vilhon Reach, or Waterdeep).

Bene t:  You  get  a  +2  bonus  on  all  Appraise,  Bluff,  and  Sense

Motive checks.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Smooth Talk [Regional]

Your people rarely have to draw their weapons to deal with poten-

tial adversaries. There are few problems that you cant talk your

way out of.

Prerequisite:  Elf  (Waterdeep),  gloamingUND  (Sphur  Upra),

gnome  (Thesk),  half-elf  (Waterdeep),  or  human  (Silverymoon,

Thesk, Waterdeep).

Bene t: You take only a 5 penalty if you attempt a Diplomacy

check as a full-round action.

Normal: A Diplomacy check usually requires at least 1 minute.

You can attempt a rushed Diplomacy check as a full-round action,

but you take a 10 penalty.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Snake Blood [Regional]

The taint of the yuan-ti runs in your veins. No outward signs give

away your heritage, but you are something moreor lessthan

human.

12/18/03, 11:37:16 AM

REGIONS AND FEATS

Prerequisite: Human (Chult, the Lake of Steam, Lapaliiya, Sama-

rach, Tashalar, Tharsult, Thindol, the Vilhon Reach, or the Western

Heartlands).

Bene t: You gain a +2 bonus on Re ex saving throws and a +2

bonus on Fortitude saves against poison.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Prerequisite:  Elf  (Evermeet)  or  human  (Calimshan,  Halruaa,

Nimbral, Samarach, Shadovar, or the Wizards Reach).

Bene t: You receive a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (arcana) and

Spellcraft checks. You also get a +2 bonus on saving throws against

illusion spells or effects.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Spell Thematics [General]

Your spells manifest with a distinct theme or appearance.

Prerequisite: Arcane spellcaster level 1st.

Bene t:  Due  to  the  unusual  appearance

of  your  spells,  the  DC  of  any  Spellcraft

check made to identify a spell you have

cast increases by +4. In addition, you may

designate one spell you know per spell level

as a thematic spell and cast it at +1 caster

level.  As  you  gain  access  to  new  spell  levels,

you  can  designate  new  thematic  spells;

you dont need to select this feat again to

acquire new thematic spells.

Nearly any theme is possible, so long

as you can describe a visual link for uni-

 cation.  For  example,  your  theme  might  be

lightning,  spheres,  or  screaming  skulls.  If  you

choose spheres as your theme, your magic missiles might

take the form of glowing spheres of light, and your summoned

monsters might emerge from mysterious rainbow-colored globes.

If your theme is lightning, your haste spell might manifest as a

bright green spark that leaps from ally to ally.

You cant use this feat to make your spell manifestations invis-

ible, nor do your spell thematics change the type of damage a spell

deals, regardless of its appearance.

This feat supersedes the version found in Magic of Faern.

Spellcasting Prodigy [General]

You have an exceptional gift for magic.

Bene t:  For  the  purpose  of  determining  bonus  spells,  treat  the

ability score that controls your spellcasting (Charisma for bards and

sorcerers, Wisdom for divine spellcasters, or Intelligence for wizards)

as 2 points higher than its actual value.

Special: You can gain Spellcasting Prodigy multiple times. Each

time you take the feat, it applies to a different spellcasting ability

score. You can take this feat even if you dont have any levels in a

spellcasting class yet.

You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character.

Spellwise [Regional]

You were raised in a land where mighty wizards are common. Ev-

eryone in your homeland knows something about magic, and you

have learned that things are sometimes not as they appear.

You bear the powerful magical tattoos of a Red Wizard of Thay.

Prerequisite: Specialized in a school of magic, human (Thay) or

planetouched (Thay).

Bene t:  The  saving  throw

DC for any spell you cast from

your specialized school increases

by 1. You also gain a +1 bonus

on caster level checks made to

overcome a creatures spell resis-

tance when you cast spells from that

school.  In  addition,  you  are  capable  of

participating in Red Wizard circle magic.

Special: You may select this feat only as a

1st-level  character.  You  may  have  only

one regional feat.

Tenacious

Magic [General]

You can use the Shadow Weave to

make  your  spells  harder  for  Weave

users to dispel.

Prerequisite: Shadow Weave Magic.

Bene t:  Your  spells  resist  dispelling

attempts made by Weave users. All crea-

tures employing spells or spell-like abilities

are considered Weave users unless they pos-

sess the Shadow Weave Magic feat. When

a Weave user makes a dispel check to dispel

one of your spells (including using dispel magic to counterspell

a spell you are casting), the DC is 15 + your caster level. This

bene t  does  not  extend  to  spells  you  cast  from  the  schools  of

evocation or transmutation.

Thug [Regional]

You  have  a  knack  for  getting  the  jump  on  the  competition  and

pushing other people around. While others debate, you act.

Prerequisite:  Centaur  (the  Plateau  of  Thay),  dwarf  (Under-

dark  [Northdark]  or  Waterdeep),  gnoll  (the  Plateau  of  Thay),

grimlock (Underdark [Reeshov]), human (the Dragon Coast, the

Moonsea, the Nelanther Isles, Unther, the Vast, or the Vilhon

Reach), orc (Amn, Thesk, or Underdark [Northdark]), or plane-

touched (Impiltur, the Silver Marches, Unther, or the Western

Heartlands).

Bene t: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus

on Appraise and Intimidate checks.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

REGIONS AND FEATS

Thunder Twin [Regional]

You are one of the generation of dwarf twins born after Moradins

Thunder Blessing in the Year of Thunder.

Prerequisite: Dwarf (the Galena Mountains, the Great Rift, the

Smoking  Mountains,  the  Spine  of  the  World,  the  Sword  Coast,

Turmish, Underdark [Old Shanatar], or Waterdeep).

Bene t: You have a twin brother or sister (fraternal or identical). If

your twin is alive and on the same plane, you may attempt a DC 12

Wisdom check to sense his or her direction. If successful, you can note

your twins direction with a move action any time you take the time to

do so during the next hour. You can retry this check once per hour.

You  also  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  Diplomacy  and  Intimidate

checks.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level

character. You may have only one regional feat.

Tireless [Regional]

You  dont  know  the  meaning  of  the  word

quit.

Prerequisite: Dwarf (the Galena Moun-

tains, the Sword Coast, or Underdark

[Old Shanatar]), human (the Horde-

lands, the Ride,

Thindol, or

Vaasa),

lizardfolk

(Surkh), orc

(the Horde-

lands),

or wemic

(the Shaar).

Bene t:

You reduce

the  effects

of  exhaustion  and  fatigue  by  one  step.

You cannot become exhausted. If you are

exposed to an effect or condition that would normally make you ex-

hausted (such as the spell waves of exhaustion), you become fatigued

instead. If an effect or condition (such as the end of barbarian rage)

would normally make you fatigued, that effect is negated.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Treetopper [Regional]

Your  people  are  at  home  in  trees  and  high  places.  You  can  dare

climbs that few other folk would care to try.

Prerequisite:  Elf  (the  Chondalwood,  the  High  Forest,  or  the

Yuirwood),  half-elf  (Aglarond  or  the  High  Forest),  hal ing  (the

Chondalwood), or human (Aglarond).

Bene t: You get a +2 bonus on Balance and Climb checks. You do

not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing, and attackers

do not gain any bonuses to attack you while you are climbing.

Normal:  A  climbing  character  loses  his  Dexterity  bonus  to

Armor Class while climbing, and an attacker gains a +2 bonus on

attack rolls made to hit him.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

Twin Spell [Metamagic]

You can cast a spell simultaneously with another spell just like it.

Prerequisite: Any other metamagic feat.

Bene t: A spell altered by this feat takes effect twice, as

if  you  were  simultaneously  casting  the  same  spell  two

times on the same location or against the same target.

Any variables in the spell (such as targets, shaping

an area, and so on) apply to both of the resulting

spells. The target suffers all the effects of both

spells individually and receives a saving throw

for each.

In  some  cases,  such  as  a  twinned  charm

person, failure of both of the targets

saving throws results in redundant

effects, although any ally of the

target  would  have  to  succeed

on two dispel checks to remove

the  effect.  As  with  other

metamagic  feats,  twinning  a

spell  does  not  affect  its  vulner-

ability  to  counterspelling.  (For

example, countering with an un-

twinned spell doesnt negate just

half of the twinned spell.)

A twinned spell uses up a spell slot

four  levels  higher  than  the  spells

You have mastered a defensive style based on wielding a blade in

each hand.

Prerequisites: Elf (Menzoberranyr or Waterdeep), half-elf (Wa-

terdeep), or human (Sembia or Waterdeep), pro cient with martial

weapons.

Bene t: When  ghting with two blades (dagger, longsword, rapier,

scimitar, or short sword, in any combination), you can designate a

melee opponent during your action and receive a +2 shield bonus to

your Armor Class against attacks from that opponent. This bonus

stacks with the shield bonus from a buckler or animated shield. You

can select a new melee opponent as a free action on your turn. You

lose this bonus if you are caught  at-footed or lose your Dexterity

bonus to AC for any reason.

Special: You may select this feat only as a 1st-level character. You

may have only one regional feat.

The prestige classes in this book are described in three

chapters. Chapter 2 contains the generally available

prestige classes for Faernian characters. Epic prestige

classes are in Chapter 5 with other Toril-related epic material, and

vile and exalted prestige classes are in the Appendix with the other

material relating to Book of Vile Darkness and Book of  Exalted

Deeds.  Table  21,  below,  gives  a  comprehensive  list  of  prestige

classes in this book and the chapters in which they appear.

and  other  combat-focused  characters  can  continue  advancing  in

their basic training or sign up with a mercenary guild or national

Arcane Devotee

Although  clerics  and  druids  make  up  the

majority of spellcasters within the hierarchies

of Faerns churches, they by no means hold

a  monopoly.  Many  pious  sorcerers  and

wizards, and even a few bards, choose

to  devote  themselves  to  a  deity  as

thoroughly as the most devout of cler-

ics. These arcane spellcasters gain an

insight into divine magic that often

baf es their less religious peers.

Arcane devotees are most common

among the worshipers of Azuth and

Mystra,  with  the  former  attracting

more  wizards  and  the  latter  more

sorcerers.  Bards  sometimes  become

arcane  devotees  of  Lliira  or  other

musically

inclined  deities,  and

rumors persist of assassins serving as

arcane devotees of Bane.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  an  arcane  devo-

tee, a character must ful ll all the following

criteria.

Skills: Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks, Spellcraft 8 ranks.

Feat: Enlarge Spell.

Spells: Able to cast 4th-level arcane spells.

Patron Deity: An arcane devotee must have a patron deity, and it

must be the one he serves as an arcane devotee.

Arcane Devotee

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new

arcane devotee level is gained, the character

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as

if he had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class

granted him access to 4th-level arcane spells before he added the

prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other bene t

a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or

item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for

an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means

Whats Changed in v.3.5?

Along with several new prestige classes for FORGOTTEN REALMS

characters,  this  chapter  presents  revisions  to  many  of  the

prestige  classes  originally  printed  in  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign  Setting.  In  most  cases,  these  revisions  are  fairly

minorrevised skill lists, incorporation of errata, and so on.

Only  two  classesthe  Harper  scout  and  the  hathranhave

drastically changed. The Harper scout (now called the Harper

agent) has more skill points and advances in an existing spell-

casting class rather than having its own spell list. The abilities

of the hathran have been reworked to be more in keeping with

the  avor of the Rashemi wychlaran.

Players looking for revised versions of the archmage, hiero-

phant, and Red Wizard prestige classes will  nd them on pages

178, 188, and 193 of the Dungeon Masters Guide v.3.5.

that he adds the level of arcane devotee to the level of whatever

other  arcane  spellcasting  class  granted  him  access  to  4th-level

arcane  spells,  then  determines  spells  per  day,  spells  known,  and

caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that

granted access to 4th-level spells before he became an arcane devotee,

he must decide to which class he adds each level of arcane devotee for

the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Reach of the Holy (Ex): At 1st level, the arcane devotee may

apply the effects of the Enlarge Spell feat to any spell he casts.

He does not need to prepare it as an enlarged spell in advance, and

the use of this ability does not increase the casting time or use a

higher-level spell slot. The arcane devotee may use this ability a

number of times per day equal to 1 + his Cha modi er (minimum

once per day).

Sacred Defense (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, the arcane devotee

gains  a  +1  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  divine  spells,  as  well

as  the  spell-like  and  supernatural  abilities  of  outsiders.  When  he

reaches 4th level, the bonus increases to +2.

Divine Synergy (Ex): At 3rd level, the arcane devotee learns to

harmonize his magic with that of his deitys worshipers. Any time

he is the target of a harmless spell cast by a divine spellcaster of

his patron deity, the spell functions as if affected by the Empower

Spell feat, if applicable. The spell must be cast by another charac-

tereven if the arcane devotee has levels in a divine spellcasting

class,  he  does  not  gain  this  bene t  for  divine  spells  he  casts  on

himself. A spell that cannot be affected by the Empower Spell feat

gains no further bene t from this ability.

Divine Shroud (Sp): Once per day, a 5th-level arcane devotee may

surround himself with a shroud of glowing divine power that pro-

tects him against hostile spells. This ability functions like the spell

resistance spell (caster level equals arcane devotee level), except that

the divine shroud is of a color appropriate to the arcane devotees

patron. An arcane devotee of Tyr, for example, is surrounded by

a  steady,  rose-purple  glow,  while  an  arcane  devotee  of  Cyric  is

wrapped in a pulsating cloud of purple and black.

churches, a divine champion can take up the banner of any deity, re-

gardless of alignment or ethos. Rivalries between divine champions

of opposing faiths have been the stuff of legends told by bards for

centuries. These holy warriors are loved by their patrons worshipers

and hated by the churchs enemies in equal measure.

Most divine champions come from a combat or military back-

ground.  Barbarians,   ghters,  paladins,  and  rangers  are  the  most

common candidates, though monks, clerics, and the more militant

druids frequently pursue this path as well. Many divine champions

of evil gods are also blackguards, and divine champions of all align-

ments often have levels in prestige classes unique to their churches.

Bards, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards rarely become divine champi-

ons unless they are unusually militant.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a divine champion, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skill: Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.

Feat: Weapon Focus (deitys favored weapon).

Patron Deity: A divine champion must have a patron deity, and

it must be the one he serves as a divine champion.

CLASS SKILLS

The divine champions class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),  Intimidate

(Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Behind the Curtain: Revised Prestige Classes

The  most  common  and  important  change  to  the  prestige

classes  in  this  chapter  is  a  new  de nition  of  the  spell  power

ability. As with the Red Wizard and archmage prestige classes,

which originally appeared in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting and were revised in the Dungeon Masters Guide v.3.5,

prestige classes that grant spell power now increase the effective

caster level for spells, not their saving throw DCs. Before the

revision, it became clear that saving throw DCs were increasing

at a pace that far outstripped characters and creatures saving

throw  modi ers.  As  a  result,  the  effects  of  Spell  Focus  and

Greater Spell Focus were reduced to their new values, and the

spell power ability was changed. A few DC-increasing effects,

such as the Shadow Weave Magic feat, still remain in the game,

but that feat comes with enough limitations that it remains bal-

anced, and the shadow adept prestige class no longer escalates

that effect.

Deific Grudge Matches

Although  the  opposed  alignment  system  works  just   ne  for

determining  a  divine  champions  enemies,  there  are  many  dei-

ties in Toril that, while not diametrically opposed in alignment,

hate  each  other  with  a  passion.  The  following  table  lists  the

most commonly worshiped gods of Faern and several of their

enemies.  Each  divine  champion  should  choose  one  foe  of  her

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Improved Turning, Quick Draw, Weapon Focus. He must meet any

prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Sacred Defense (Ex): At 2nd level, the divine champion gains a +1

bonus on saving throws against divine spells, as well as the spell-like

and supernatural abilities of outsiders. When she reaches 4th level,

the bonus increases to +2.

Smite In del (Su): Once per day, a divine champion of at least 3rd

level may attempt to smite a creature that has a different patron

deity  (or  no  patron  deity  at  all)  with  one  normal

melee  attack.  She  adds  her  Charisma

bonus (if any) to the attack roll and

deals  1  extra  point  of  damage  per

divine champion level. For example,

a  4th-level  divine  champion  armed

with  a  longsword  would  deal  1d8+4

points of damage, plus any additional

bonuses  from  high  strength  or

magical effects that would normally

apply. If a divine champion acciden-

tally smites a creature that is not of

an opposing alignment or deity, the

smite has no effect but is still used up

for that day.

If  the  divine  champion  has  a

smite  ability  from  another  source

(such  as  cleric  or  paladin  levels),

she may instead use that ability one

extra time per day.

Divine Wrath (Su): Once per day, a

5th-level divine champion can chan-

nel  a  portion  of  her  patron  deitys

power  to  greatly  enhance  her  own

battle  prowess.  She  gains  damage

reduction  5/  and  a  +3  bonus  on

attack rolls, damage, and saving throws

for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modi er

(minimum 1 round). These modi ers are sacred bonuses if

the divine champions patron is of good alignment, or profane

bonuses if her deity is of evil alignment. If the patron deity is

neutral, the divine champions alignment determines whether the

bonuses are sacred or profane. If both the divine champion and her

patron are neutral, the character chooses whether the bonuses are

sacred or profane when she  rst gains the ability.

Divine Disciple

Among  the  disciples  of  any  religion  are  a  rare  few  individuals

whose devotion to their deity goes far above and beyond the norm.

A divine disciple is the living embodiment of her patron deity on

Toril, and at the height of her power, she actually ascends to some-

thing more than mortal. At that point, whether she continues to

serve her deity in Faern or departs the mortal coil to bask in the

actual presence of her god, a divine disciple is the epitome of an

intelligent creatures personal relationship

with its deity.

All  divine  disciples  come  from  the

ranks  of  divine  spellcasters.  Clerics

and druids are the most common can-

didates,  but  especially  pious  paladins

and  rangers  sometimes  pursue  this

path. In the dark churches of evil gods,

blackguards sometimes rise to become

divine disciples.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a divine disciple,

a character must ful ll all the follow-

ing criteria.

Skills: Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowl-

edge (religion) 8 ranks.

Spells:  Able  to  cast  4th-level

divine spells.

Patron  Deity:  A  divine  disciple

must have a patron deity, and it must be

the one she serves as a divine disciple.

CLASS SKILLS

The divine disciples class skills (and the

key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Concentration

(Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis),

Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int),

Knowledge  (nature)  (Int),  Knowledge  (the  planes)  (Int),

Knowledge  (religion)  (Int),  Profession  (Wis),  Spellcraft  (Int),

and Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are features of the divine disciple prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Divine disciples gain no pro -

ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new divine disciple level is

gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever divine

spellcasting  class  granted  her  access  to  4th-level  divine  spells

before  she  added  the  prestige  class  level.  She  does  not,  however,

gain any other bene t a character of that class would have gained

(improved  chance  of  turning  or  rebuking  undead,  and  so  on),

except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essen-

tially means that she adds the level of divine disciple to the level of

whatever other divine spellcasting class granted her access to 4th-

level divine spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and

caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that

granted access to 4th-level spells before she became a divine disciple,

she must decide to which class she adds each level of divine disciple

for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Divine  Emissary  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  a  divine  disciple  can  com-

municate telepathically with any outsider within 60 feet that has

the same alignment as she does or serves her deity. The telepathy

function of this class feature is a supernatural ability.

The character also gains a bonus equal to her divine disciple level

on any Charisma-based skill or ability checks she makes when deal-

ing with outsiders that share her alignment or patron.

Sacred Defense (Ex): At 2nd level, the divine disciple gains a +1

bonus on saving throws against divine spells, as well as the spell-

like and supernatural abilities of outsiders. At 4th level, this bonus

increases to +2.

Imbue With Spell Ability (Sp): A 3rd-level divine disciple can use

imbue with spell ability (caster level equals divine disciples caster

level). Since it is a spell-like ability, the divine disciple does not need

to devote a 4th-level spell slot to its use, though the imbued spells

themselves take up her lower-level spell slots, as usual. This ability

is usable once per day.

Domain: At 4th level, the divine disciple may choose a domain

from those that her deity grants access to. If she already has two

domains as a cleric, she gains a third in addition to those. Regardless

of her original divine spellcasting class, she gains the granted power

of the new domain, adding her divine disciple level to her cleric level

(if any) to determine level-based effects. If the divine disciple has

cleric levels, she also gains a third spell choice with which to  ll

her domain spell slot at each level. Druids, paladins, and rangers

gain no extra spell slots for domain spells, but they can prepare the

domains spells in their normal spell slots.

Transcendence  (Su):  At  5th  level,  thanks  to  her  frequent  con-

tact with outsiders and her deitys direct intervention, the divine

disciple sheds her mortal form and becomes an outsider with the

native subtype. This apotheosis grants her immunity to any spell

or effect that does not affect outsiders (for example, charm person

cannot affect her) as well as darkvision out to 60 feet, if she does

not  already  have  it.  Because  of  her  native  subtype,  however,  the

divine  disciple  must  still  eat,  breathe,  and  sleep,  and  she  can  be

reincarnated, raised, or resurrected normally. She also gains any

alignment subtypes that match alignment components she has in

common with her deity. Thus, a chaotic neutral divine disciple of a

chaotic evil deity gains the chaotic subtype, and a divine disciple of

a neutral deity gains no additional subtypes.

Divine Seeker

Even  the  gods  have  need  of  secrecy  from  time  to  time.  When

stealth  and  discretion  are  more  suitable  for  a  given  task  than

combat prowess or holy spells, the divine seeker steps in to perform

missions for her deity. Depending upon the church to which she

belongs, a divine seeker might be called upon to retrieve a holy relic

from lands controlled by enemies of the church, covertly spy upon

the priests of a rival faith, or even assassinate heretics who speak

out against her deity. Subtlety is the divine seekers stock in trade,

and she can often accomplish her task without the slightest evidence

of her churchs involvement.

Divine seekers can come from any character class, but monks,

rangers, and rogues are the most common candidates. Barbarians

and bards sometimes have enough skills to become divine seekers,

but they tend to lack the subtlety necessary for success. Sorcerers

and wizards sometimes become divine seekers, but they often have

dif culty accumulating the requisite skills.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a divine seeker, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks, Move Silently

10 ranks, Spot 5 ranks.

Feat: Stealthy.

Patron: A divine seeker must have a patron deity, and it must be

the one she serves as a divine seeker.

Evereskan

Tomb Guardian

Few  things  are  more  sacred  to  the  elves

of Evereska than the bodies of their dead.

Countless  great  leaders,  heroes,  and

scholars  of  the  Fortress  Home  are

buried  in  tombs  scattered  throughout

the region, and the elves consider these

sites  inviolable.  Unfortunately,  the

tombs  also  contain  priceless

magic  treasures  crafted  by  the

elves  of  old,  and  the  thought  of

such  booty  leads  many  looters  to  test

the  elves  defenses.  The  Evereskan  tomb

guardians are on hand to ensure that these

defenses are very good indeed. Each tomb

guardian  swears  a  solemn  oath  to  track

grave  robbers  to  the  ends  of  Faern  and

beyond, and never to rest until the de lers

Thwart Magic Trap (Ex): At 1st level, the divine seeker gains a

+3 bonus on all Disable Device and Search checks made to locate,

disable, or bypass magic traps.

Sacred  Defense  (Ex):  Beginning  at  2nd  level,  the  divine  seeker

gains a +1 bonus on saving throws against divine spells, as well as

the spell-like and supernatural abilities of outsiders. At 4th level,

the bonus increases to +2.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This ability functions like the rogue ability of

the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 2nd

level, and again at 5th level. If a divine seeker gets a sneak attack

bonus from another source (such as rogue levels) the bonuses on

damage  stack.  Furthermore,  divine  seeker  levels  stack  with  any

other  appropriate  class  levels  (such  as  rogue  or  assassin)  for  the

purpose of overcoming improved uncanny dodge.

Divine seeker

have been slain.

Rogue/sorcerers and ranger/sorcerers are far and away the most

common candidates for tomb guardians, though monks, sorcerers,

and wizards sometimes  nd themselves drawn to this path as well.

Fighters,  clerics,  and  paladins  tend  to  have  trouble  meeting  the

spellcasting requirement, and barbarians are too violent.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  an  Evereskan  tomb  guardian,  a  character

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level:  4  +  Int

modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the Evereskan tomb guardian prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:

Evereskan  tomb  guardians  gain  no

pro ciency  with  any  weapon,  armor,

or  shield.  Armor  check  penalties  for

armor  heavier  than  leather  apply  to  the  skills  Balance,  Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new Evereskan tomb guard-

ian level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells

known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever

arcane  spellcasting  class  granted  him  access  to  2nd-level  arcane

spells before he added the prestige class level. He does not, however,

gain any other bene t a character of that class would have gained

(bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard or assassin abilities,

and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

This essentially means that he adds the level of Evereskan tomb

guardian  to  the  level  of  whatever  other  arcane  spellcasting  class

granted him access to 2nd-level arcane spells, then determines spells

per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that

granted access to 2nd-level spells before he became a tomb guardian,

he must decide to which class he adds each level of tomb guardian

for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Sacred  Duty  (Su):  The  Evereskan  tomb  guardian  gains

a  +2  sacred  bonus  on  Gather  Information,  Hide,  Move

Silently,  and  Survival  checks  made  inside  the  region  of

Evereska. While inside an Evereskan tomb, he also gains

a  +2  sacred  bonus  on  attack  rolls  and  a  sacred  bonus

equal to his tomb guardian level on damage rolls.

Devoted Pursuit (Ex): While pursuing the robber of an

Evereskan tomb, a 2nd-level or higher tomb guard-

ian retains his bonuses on Gather Information,

Hide,  Move  Silently,  and  Survival  checks  from

the sacred duty ability even while outside of

Evereska. He also retains the bonuses he

gained  from  that  ability  on  attack  and

damage rolls, but these apply only to at-

tacks made against the tomb robber.

Dodge Bonus (Ex): Beginning at 2nd

level,  an  Evereskan  tomb  guardian

receives a +1 dodge bonus to AC while

wearing light or no armor. This bonus

increases to +2 at 4th level.

Swift  Tracking  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,

the tomb guardian no longer takes a 5

penalty on Survival checks for tracking

at his normal speed. Furthermore, he takes only

a 10 penalty (instead of the normal 20) when moving at up to

twice normal speed while tracking.

Silent Guardian (Ex): At 5th level, the tomb guardian can attune

himself to the look and sounds of his surroundings. After concen-

trating  for  10  minutes  to  familiarize  himself  with  the  area,  he

gains a +4 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, and Spot checks

as long as he remains within 100 feet of the spot where he  rst

attuned himself.

Eye of Horus-Re

Following the Time of Troubles, the chief deity of the Mulhorandi

pantheon began to take a greater interest in combating the agents

of Set beyond the political realm of Mulhorand. Horus-Re began to

inspire paladins to serve this cause, and numerous clerics have also

joined the crusade. Perfect channels for the holy radiance of their

deity, these clerics are known as the eyes of Horus-Re. They are

champions of good, sworn enemies of Set, and bane to undead.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

All eyes of Horus-Re are clerics of that deity, though some have

paladin levels as well. Cleric/ ghters are also fairly common, and

some cleric/wizards use their limited arcane spells to supplement

their divine magic in Horus-Res service.

In stark contrast to most of the clergy of Horus-Re, the eyes

choose  to  ignore  strictly  political  matters  in  Mulhorand.  Rather

than reporting to the pharaoh of that land, they maintain their

own hierarchical structure. NPC eyes of Horus-Re can be found

wherever the minions of Set or undead creatures walk the land, and

some are showing increasing interest in the activities of

the yuan-ti in Hlondeth.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an

eye of Horus-Re, a char-

acter must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Lawful good.

Region: Mulhorand.

Skills: Knowledge

craft (Int), and Spot (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  eye  of  Horus-Re

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Eyes of Horus-Re gain no pro-

 ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  Beginning  at  2nd  level,  when

a new eye of Horus-Re level is gained, the character gains

new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he

had also gained a level in cleric. He does not,

however, gain any other bene t

a character of that class would

have  gained  (improved  chance

of  turning  or  rebuking  undead,

and so on), except for an increased

effective level of spellcasting. This

he  adds  the  level  of  eye

In  addition

turning ability, an eye of Horus-Re can use greater

a  number  of  times  per  day  equal  to  three  plus  his

Charisma modi er.

Radiance (Su): When an eye of Horus-Re casts any spell with the

light descriptor, the resulting light is brighter than normal. The

were one level higher than it actually is for all purposes, including

determining whether it can counter or dispel a darkness spell. Thus,

a daylight spell cast by an eye of Horus-Re sheds light in a 120-foot

radius and is treated as a 4th-level spell. It can counter or dispel any

darkness spell of 4th level or lower.

Turn Undead (Ex): The character adds his eye of Horus-Re levels

to his cleric levels for all purposes related to turning undead.

Everlight (Ex): At 2nd level, an eye of Horus-Re gains darkvision

out to 60 feet and low-light vision, allowing him to see in most

conditions.

Touch of the Sun (Su): When the eye of Horus-Re reaches 3rd

level, his attacks with any weapon or an unarmed strike are treated

as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Domain: At 5th level, an eye of Horus-Re gains access to one

additional  domain  of  his  choice  from  among  those  offered  by

Horus-Re.  He  gains  the  granted  power  of  the  domain  and  can

choose  from  its  spell  list  as  well  as  those  of  his  other  domains

when selecting his domain spells for the day. He can still cast only

one domain spell at each level (1st through 9th) per day, but now

he has three choices instead of two at each spell level.

Piercing Sight (Su): At 6th level, an eye of Horus-Re gains greater

visual acuity. He ignores the miss chance created by darkness spells

or  effects  and  gains  Blind-Fight  as  a  bonus  feat.  In  addition,  he

gains a +5 sacred bonus on Spot checks.

Positive Energy Burst (Su): In lieu of two daily uses of his turn-

ing ability, an eye of Horus-Re who is at least 8th level can create

a positive energy burst that affects all undead creatures within 100

feet  of  him.  This  effect  deals  1d6  points  of  damage  per  eye  of

Horus-Re level to every undead within range. Each affected undead

may attempt a Re ex save (DC 20 + the eye of Horus-Res Cha

modi er) to halve the damage.

True Seeing (Su): A 10th-level eye of Horus-Re sees all things as

they truly are, as though he were continually under the effect of a

true seeing spell.

Hammer of Moradin

Within the halls of Citadel Adbar in the icy North, an elite order

of warrior-priests stands ready to defend the dwarven people against

the onslaught of fell giants, dark elves, and goblinoids. Called the

hammers of Moradin, they serve as Citadel Adbars rallying point

against the incursion of dark creatures that haunt the North. The

regular army, known as the Iron Guard, defends the city capably,

but the hammers actively strike out against the monsters farther

a eld, bringing the righteous fury of the Soul Forger to their en-

emies very doorsteps.

Fighter/clerics and paladins make up the bulk of the members of

this prestige class, though cleric/monks are not unheard of. While

rangers  and  cleric/rogues  are  quite  capable  of  qualifying  for  the

hammer of Moradin prestige class, most gravitate instead to the

Deepscouts, another branch of Citadel Adbars army. Members of

other classes very rarely become hammers of Moradin.

Paladins  of  Moradin  can  freely  multiclass  as  hammers  of

Moradin.

Hit Die: d10.

hammer as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. He

takes no additional penalties for using the weapon in this fashion.

Goblinkiller (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, the hammer of Mora-

din may imbue any warhammer with the goblinoid bane property

as a move action. This ability may be used once per day, and the

effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the hammer

of Moradins Charisma modi er.

Hammer  Return  (Su):  When  the  hammer  of

Moradin  reaches  2nd  level,  any  warhammer  he

throws  gains  the  returning  special

ability. A returning warhammer  ies

through the air back to the hammer

of  Moradin,  returning  just  before  his

next turn, so that it is ready to use again in

that turn.

Catching the warhammer when it

comes back is a free action. If the

hammer of Moradin cant catch it,

or if he has moved since throwing

it,  the  warhammer  drops  to  the

ground  in  the  square  from  which  it

was thrown.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex):  At  3rd

level, the hammer of Moradin gains

damage reduction 2/. His damage re-

duction increases to 4/ at 6th level,

and to 6/ at 9th level.

Powerful  Grip  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,

the  hammer  of  Moradin  gains  a

bonus equal to one-half his Strength

bonus (rounded down) on damage rolls when

wielding  a  warhammer  in  melee.  Thus,  his

bonus  on  damage  rolls  with  this  weapon  equals  1-1/2

times his Strength bonus when he wields it in one hand

and twice his Strength bonus when he wields it in two hands.

Far Shot (Ex): At 4th level, the hammer of Moradin gains the

bene t of the Far Shot feat when throwing his warhammer. This

bene t increases the range increment for his thrown hammer to

30 feet.

Quake  (Su):  By  striking  his  warhammer  violently  against  the

ground (a standard action), a 4th-level or higher hammer of Mo-

radin creates a shock wave that violently shakes the earth in front

of him. Each creature touching the ground in a 60-foot cone from

the point of impact must make a successful Re ex save (DC 10 +

hammer of Moradin level + hammer of Moradins Str modi er)

or be knocked prone.

Drowbasher (Su): When a 5th-level or higher hammer of Mo-

radin uses the goblinkiller ability to imbue his warhammer with

the goblinoid bane property, it also gains the drow bane property.

This  ability  does  not  confer  any  additional  uses  per  day  of  the

57

goblinkiller ability and it does not extend the duration of the effect;

it merely makes each use more versatile.

Power  Strike  (Su):  At  5th  level,  the  hammer  of  Moradin  can

strike his foe so hard that his blow leaves the opponent dazed. To

use this ability, the hammer of Moradin makes a normal attack

roll. (The player must declare that he is using this power before

making the attack roll; thus, a miss ruins the attempt.) The attack

deals normal damage if successful. In addition, any foe damaged by

this attack must make a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC 10

+ hammer of Moradin level + hammer of Moradins

Str  modi er)  or  be  dazed  for  1  round.  Constructs,

oozes,  plants,  undead,  incorporeal  creatures,  and

creatures immune to critical hits cannot be

dazed. This ability is usable twice per day

at 5th level and four times per day at

10th level.

Chaos Crusher (Su): At 7th level, the

hammer of Moradin may imbue any war-

hammer with the axiomatic special ability as

a move action. This ability may be used once per

day, and the effect lasts a number of rounds equal to

the hammer of Moradins Charisma modi er.

Stalwart  (Su):  Hammers  of  Mo-

radin  are  renowned  for  their  ability

to  stand  strong  in  the  face  of  a  hail

of  arrows,  or  wade  into  a  throng

of  shrieking  goblins  and  emerge  un-

touched.  At  7th  level,  the  hammer  of

Moradin  may  add  his  base  Will  save

modi er  to  his  AC  once  per  day  as

a  free  action.  This  bene t  lasts  for  1

round per hammer of Moradin level.

Giantslayer  (Su):  When  an  8th-level

or  higher  hammer  of  Moradin  uses  his

goblinkiller ability, his warhammer gains the

giant  bane  property  in  addition  to  the  goblinoid

bane and drow bane properties. This ability does not

confer any additional uses per day of the goblinkiller

ability and it does not extend the duration of the effect; it merely

makes each use more versatile.

Thunder Strike (Ex): When the hammer of Moradin reaches 8th

level, his blows are so mighty that armor not only offers little pro-

tection from them, but it also acts as a conduit for the force of the

blow, causing his opponent even more pain. When wielding his war-

hammer, the hammer of Moradin gains a bonus on melee damage

rolls equal to his foes armor bonus (not including shield bonus or

enhancement bonus). Thus, a hammer of Moradin striking a crea-

ture wearing a breastplate gains a +5 bonus on his damage roll.

Power Throw (Su): At 9th level, the hammer of Moradin can

hurl his warhammer with such force that it plows on past creatures

struck by it. When throwing his hammer, the hammer of Moradin

makes a single ranged attack roll and checks the result against the

AC of all creatures in a 60-foot straight line from his position. He

then rolls damage against each creature that the weapon hits.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Bones of the Earth (Sp): When the hammer of Moradin reaches

10th level, he gains a powerful blessing from Moradin himself. This

bene t  functions  like  the  shadow  walk  spell  (caster  level  equals

hammer of Moradins divine caster level), except that rather than

traveling along the edge of the Shadow Plane, the character travels

along the edge of the Elemental Plane of Earth. Both the origin

and destination points must be within 5 feet of solid, natural stone.

This ability is usable once per day.

EX-HAMMERS OF MORADIN

A hammer of Moradin who violates his alignment or

betrays either Citadel Adbar or the Hammers of Mo-

radin as a whole loses all spell-like and supernatural

abilities gained from this prestige class. He regains

his abilities and advancement potential if

he  atones  for  his  actions  (see  the  atone-

ment spell on page 201 of the Players

Handbook).

Harper

Agent

The  semisecret  or-

ganization  known  as  the

Harpers  has  members  scat-

tered all across Faern. These

individuals are dedicated to battling

evil,  discovering  and  preserving

forgotten  lore,  and  maintaining

the  balance  between  nature  and  civilization.

Harper agents are the  eld agents of the Harper orga-

nization, acting directly to gather intelligence and eliminate

threats to the greater good. Equally adept at operating alone or in

small groups, Harper agents display a versatility that few others

can match.

Bards  are  the  most  common  candidates  for  the  Harper  agent

prestige class, but they are by no means the only quali ed charac-

ters. Rangers, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards all possess the diversity

of skill and ability necessary to become Harper agents. Clerics, espe-

cially of Deneir, Lliira, and Tymora, are occasionally found in the

ranks of this prestige class, as are druids and monks. Barbarians,

 ghters,  and  paladins  rarely  become  Harper  agents  because  they

lack the subtlety for the work.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Harper agent, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Skills: Diplomacy 8 ranks, Knowledge ([any one region] local) 4

ranks, Sense Motive 2 ranks, Survival 2 ranks.

Feat: Negotiator.

Special: The candidate must be sponsored by a member in

good standing of the Harpers and win approval from the

High  Harpers.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Harper agent prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Harper agents are pro cient with

all simple weapons and with light armor. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level, when a new

Harper agent level is gained, the

character gains new spells per day

(and  spells  known,  if  applicable)

as if he had also gained a level in

a spellcasting class he belonged to

before he added the prestige class.

He  does  not,  however,  gain  any

other bene t a character of that

class  would  have  gained  (bonus

metamagic or item creation feats,

improved chance of turning or re-

buking undead, and so on), except

for  an  increased  effective  level

of  spellcasting.  This  essentially

means  that  he  adds  the  level  of

Harper agent to the level of some

other spellcasting class the char-

acter has, then determines spells

per day, spells known, and caster

level accordingly.

If a character had more than

one  spellcasting  class  before  he

became a Harper agent, he must

decide to which class he adds each

level  of  Harper  agent  for  the

purpose  of  determining  spells

per day and spells known.

Hathran

level, the Harper agent can access knowledge in the same manner as

a bard can. This ability functions like the bardic knowledge ability,

except that the bonus for the check equals the characters Harper

agent level + her Int modi er. If the Harper agent has another such

lore ability from another source (such as bard or loremaster levels),

his Harper agent levels stack with levels of all other classes that

grant such an ability for the purpose of Harper knowledge checks.

Deneirs  Eye  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  the  Harper  agent  gains  a  +3

sacred bonus on saving throws against glyphs, runes, and symbols.

Lliiras  Heart  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  the  Harper  agent  gains  a

+2 sacred  bonus  on  saving  throws  against  compulsion  and  fear

effects.

Tymoras Smile (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a Harper agent gains

a +2 luck bonus on any single saving throw of his choice once per

day. This bonus can be added after the die is rolled and the success

or failure of the save has been determined.

Lurues Voice (Sp): At 4th level, the Harper agent may use speak

with animals (caster level equals Harper agent level) three times

per day.

Mystras Boon (Su): At 5th level, the Harper agent gains a +2

sacred bonus on all saving throws against spells.

EX-HARPER AGENTS

Any Harper agent who violates the code of the Harpers, endangers

other Harpers through negligence or deliberate action, or intention-

ally turns away from the Harpers quickly gains a reputation in the

organization.  Such  an  individual

can  no  longer  progress  in  the

Harper  agent  prestige  class.

Furthermore,  he  can  no  longer

use  the  Deneirs  eye,  Lliiras

heart,  Lurues  voice,  Mystras

boon, or Tymoras smile abilities.

A petition to the High Harpers,

ful llment of a suitable quest set

by that group, and an atonement

spell from a deity chosen by the

High Harpers brings the former

Harper  agent  back  into  good

standing.  Thereafter,  he  regains

the  use  of  all  class  abilities  and

may once again gain levels in the

prestige class.

Hathran

In the distant and exotic land of

Rashemen,  a  sisterhood  of  pow-

erful  spellcasters,  both  arcane

and  divine,  battles  to  protect  its

people  from  the  depredations  of

Thay and to guide their spiritual

lives. These hathrans, or Witches

of  Rashemen,  as  they  are  more

commonly known, are the power behind the throne in their home-

land far to the east, and their mystical prowess there is extremely

potent. Hathrans traveling outside Rashemen always wear masks to

conceal their faces from the outside world.

Most  hathrans  are  drawn  from  members  of  the  sorcerer  or

cleric classes. Bards, wizards, and druids are rare but not unheard

of among hathrans, but paladins and rangers are practically non-

existent within the sisterhood. Regardless of their original classes,

hathrans consider rivalry between spellcasters to be utterly foolish,

and they hold no grudge against any of their sisters for the origin

of their spells.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a hathran, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good.

centration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (all skills,

taken  individually)  (Int),  Perform  (Cha),  Profession  (Wis),  Swim

(Str), Speak Language (none), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the hathran prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Hathrans gain pro ciency with

the whip, but not with any other weapons, nor with any armor or

shields. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply

to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Si-

lently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor

check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new hathran level is gained,

the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if appli-

cable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class

granted her access to 4th-level spells before she added the prestige

class. She does not, however, gain any other bene t a character of

that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation

feats,  improved  chance  of  turning  or  rebuking  undead,  and  so

on),  except  for  an  increased  effective  level  of  spellcasting.  This

essentially means that she adds the level of hathran to the level

of whatever other spellcasting class granted her access to 4th-level

spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level

accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class that granted

access  to  4th-level  spells  before  she  became  a  hathran,  she  must

decide to which class she adds each level of hathran for the purpose

of determining spells per day and spells known.

Additionally, a small number of spells are added to the hath-

rans  class  list  for  any  spellcasting  classes  in  which  she  can  cast

4th-level spells.

Leadership Bonus (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, the hathran gains

a +2 bonus to her Leadership score for the purpose of recruiting a

cohort, with the following restriction: The cohort must be Rashemi

and must either be a female with the Ethran feat or a male with at

least one level in barbarian.

Rashemi Spirit Magic (Ex): A hathrans training in the unique

magic of her homeland gives her uncanny versatility. Beginning at

1st level, a hathran who prepares spells may choose to spontane-

ously cast any spell she knows in place of any spell of the same level

that she has prepared, even if it is not on the same spell list as the

substituted one. If the hathran normally does not prepare spells, she

may instead utilize metamagic feats without the additional casting

time  normally  required,  though  a  spell  so  altered  still  uses  up  a

higher-level spell slot, as normal. The hathran must be within the

boundaries of Rashemen to use this ability, and there is no limit to

the number of times she may do so.

Taboo: In Rashemi society, the crafting of magic items is left

strictly to male spellcasters. With the exception of the Scribe Scroll

feat, no hathran may select item creation feats.

Spirit Speech (Su): At 2nd level, the hathran gains the ability to

speak to and understand any creature with the spirit subtype. This

ability functions regardless of the language that the hathran and

the  spirit  actually  use  to  converse.  The  hathran  also  gains  a  +2

bonus  on  any  Charisma-based  skill  or  ability  checks  made  when

dealing with spirits.

Awe of the Wychlaran (Ex): At 3rd level, the hathran radiates

such  power  and  authority  that  her  fellow  Rashemi   nd  it  dif -

cult to act against her. Any character from the Rashemen region

whose character level is lower than or equal to that of the hathran

takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls and opposed skill checks made

against her. This penalty increases to 4 at 7th level and to 6 at

10th level.

Universal Spirit Magic (Ex): At 3rd level, the hathrans af nity

for spirit magic is such that she can commune with spirits outside

of Rashemen. Once per day, she may use her Rashemi spirit magic

ability  outside  of  Rashemen.

The  hathran  can  use  this

ability  twice  per  day  at  6th

level and three times per day

at 9th level.

Spirit  Concordat  (Ex):  At

4th  level,  the  hathran  casts

all  spells  in  the  planar  ally

spell chain at +1 caster level.

Circle  Leader  (Ex):  At  5th

level, the hathran can become a

circle leader and act as the focus

for  Rashemi  circle  magic.  See

page  59  of  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS  Campaign  Setting

for details on circle magic.

Spirit  Dominion:  At  8th  level,

the  hathran  casts  all  spells  in  the

planar binding spell chain at +1 caster

level.

Great Circle Leader (Ex): By the time

the  hathran  reaches  10th  level,  she  has

mastered the art of circle magic and can lead

a great circle. A great circle can have a total of

nine assistants instead of  ve.

Hathran Spell List

The  following  spells  are  added  to  the  hathrans

class spell list for any arcane or divine spellcasting

class that allows her access to 4th-level spells.

0 Level: Naturewatch.

1st Level: Low-light vision, scatterspray.

2nd Level: Flame dagger, moonbeam, one with the land.

3rd Level: Flashburst, moon blade.

4th Level: Land womb, lesser planar ally.

5th Level: Lesser planar binding, moon path.

6th Level: Planar ally, planar binding.

8th Level: Greater planar binding.

EX-HATHRANS

A hathran who violates her alignment, commits an act of treason

against  Rashemen  or  the  wychlaran,  or  takes  any  item  creation

feat  except  Scribe  Scroll  can  no  longer  advance  in  the  hathran

prestige class. Furthermore, she loses the bene ts of her Leader-

ship bonus, Rashemi spirit magic, and other abilities of the prestige

class that relate to Rashemi. An atonement spell cast by a cleric of

an appropriate deity is suf cient to restore her class abilities and

61

advancement potential. If the violation involved an item creation

feat, the hathran must swear a solemn oath never to use the feat.

Incantatrix

Incantatrixes  are  the  de nitive  practitioners  of  metamagic  in

Faern, devoting themselves to the study of spells and techniques

that  affect  other  spells.  They  deal  with  magic  in  its  raw  form,

shaping  it  according  to  their  own

desires rather than any external

laws  of  magic.  They  can  apply

their  deep  understanding  of

metamagic  to  alter  spells

their allies cast, spells they

cast  from  wands  or  staffs,

and even spells that have already

been cast.

incantatrixes  were

Most

pre viously skilled wizards or sor-

cerers, although a few bards also

study this type of magic. Divine

spellcasters  rarely  adopt  this

classperhaps,  as  the  incanta-

trixes say, because their magic is

tinged  with  divine  in uence  and

therefore less pure than arcane

magic.  Most  incantatrixes  are

female;  the  rare  males  who

take  up  this  class  are  known

as incantatars.

Incantatrix  NPCs  usually

act  independently,  but  some-

times they join together to solve

a  common  problem.  Since  they

dislike extraplanar intrusions on

the  Material  Plane,  they  see  the

destruction  of  active  portals  to  other

planes  as  their  responsibility.  Thus,  an

incantatrix is usually a knowledgeable source of information

on functional portals in the area. Because incantatrixes have little

offensive combat magic that is effective against normal creatures,

they prefer to avoid combat or travel with companions who balance

their shortcomings.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become an incantatrix, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Skills:  Concentration  4  ranks,  Knowledge  (arcana)  8  ranks,

Spellcraft 8 ranks.

Feats: Iron Will, any one metamagic feat.

Spellcasting: Able to cast 3rd-level arcane spells.

Special:  The  candidate  cannot  have  abjuration  as  a  prohibited

school.

gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever arcane

spellcasting  class  granted  her  access  to  3rd-level  spells  before

she  added  the  prestige  class.  She  does  not,  however,  gain  any

other bene t a character of that class would have gained (bonus

metamagic  or  item  creation  feats,  bard  or  assassin  abilities,  and

so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This

essentially means that she adds the level of incantatrix to the level

of whatever other arcane spellcasting class granted her access to

3rd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and

caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that

granted access to 3rd-level spells before she became an incantatrix,

she must decide to which class she adds each level of incantatrix

for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Bonus Metamagic Feat: At 1st level, and again at 4th, 7th, and

10th level, the incantatrix may select any metamagic feat as a bonus

feat. She must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Focused  Studies  (Ex):  At  1st  level,  the  incantatrix  gives  up  a

school of magic so as to focus more on the remaining schools. She

must choose a school of magic other than abjuration or divination

as a prohibited school. This prohibited school is in addition to any

others already chosen due to school specialization. Thus, a special-

ized wizard taking this prestige class has three prohibited schools

instead of two.

Cooperative Metamagic (Su): At 2nd level, an incantatrix gains

the  ability  to  apply  any  metamagic  feat  she  possesses  (except

Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell) to a spell being cast by

a willing allied spellcaster. The caster need not prepare the spell

in metamagic form or in a higher-level spell slot; the incantatrix

simply modi es the spell during the casting. Using this ability is

a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, just like

casting a spell, though the incantatrix can use the Concentration

skill with this ability as though she were casting defensively. The

incantatrix  must  ready  an  action  to  use  cooperative  metamagic

when her ally begins casting and must be adjacent to the caster. The

incantatrix must make a Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3  modi ed

spell  level])  to  succeed.  Modi ed  spell  level  is  the  level  of  the

spell slot that the spell would occupy if it were prepared with the

metamagic feat applied. Any spell level increases from metamagic

feats that the caster applied also count toward the modi ed spell

level. For example, if an incantatrix applies the Maximize Spell feat

to an allys chain lightning spell, the modi ed spell level is 9th (6th

for the spell, +1 for the Maximize Spell feat), and the DC is 18 +

(3  9) = 45. If she applies the same feat to an allys silent chain

lightning spell, the modi ed spell level is 10th and the Spellcraft

DC is 48. An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per

day equal to 3 + her Int modi er.

Metamagic Effect (Su): At 3rd level, an incantatrix can attempt

to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to a persistent spell effect

that is already in place. For example, she could use Extend Spell

to  extend  the  duration  of  a  wall  of  force  or  Maximize  Spell  to

maximize the damage dealt by a cloudkill. To use this ability, the

incantatrix must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make

a successful Spellcraft check (DC 18 + [3  modi ed spell level].

Modi ed spell level is the level of the spell slot that the spell

would occupy if it were prepared with the metamagic feat applied.

Spell slot increases for metamagic feats that were applied to affect

62

PRESTIGE CLASSES

the spells casting (such as Still Spell, Silent Spell, or Quicken Spell)

do not count toward the modi ed spell level, but adjustments for

metamagic that change the spells effect (such as Empower Spell,

Enlarge Spell, or Widen Spell) do count.

For  example,  applying  the  Extend  Spell  feat  to  a  wall  of   re

gives it a modi ed spell level of 5th (4th for the spell +1 for the

Extend Spell feat), so the DC would be 18 + (3  5) = 33. If the

wall of  re had been cast with the Silent Spell feat applied, the DC

is still 33, since that feat applies to the spells casting, not its effect.

On the other hand, extending an empowered wall of  re would give

it a modi ed spell level of 7th and a Spellcraft DC of 39.

An incantatrix can use this ability a number of times per day

equal  to  3  +  her  Int  modi er.  Using  this  ability  is  a  full-round

action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Metamagic Spell Trigger (Su): At 5th level, an incantatrix gains

the ability to apply a metamagic feat she possesses to the effect of

a spell trigger item (generally a wand). To use this ability, she must

have the appropriate item creation feat to make the spell trigger

item she is using. Using metamagic spell trigger expends a number

of additional charges from the item equal to the number of ef-

fective spell levels the metamagic feat would add to a spell. For

example, an incantatrix can use Quicken Spell to modify a spell

cast from a wand by spending 5 charges (1 + 4 additional charges

for the spell slot increase). Alternatively, she can apply Empower

Spell to the effect by spending 3 charges, or trigger it silently by

spending 2 charges. The Still Spell feat confers no bene t when

applied to a spell trigger item.

An  incantatrix  cannot  use  this  ability  when  using  a  spell

trigger  item  that  does  not  have  charges,  such  as  a  strand  of

prayer beads.

Seize  Concentration  (Su):  At  6th  level,  an  incantatrix  gains

the ability to wrest control of a spell that requires concentration

(such as implosion, major image, or summon swarm) from another

spellcaster within 30 feet. If the target spellcaster is willing, this

transfer  of  concentration  occurs  automatically.  Otherwise,  the

incantatrix  and  the  target  spellcaster  make  an  opposed  caster

level check. A divine spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check.

If the incantatrix wins, she gains control of the spell for as long

as  she  maintains  concentration  or  until  the  original  spell  dura-

tion expires. The spell functions as though the incantatrix were

the caster (even if it is a spell she cannot cast), except that any

variables determined when the spell was cast (including its caster

level)  remain  as  determined  by  the  original  caster.  The  original

spellcaster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives a

+2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it. If

the incantatrix allows her concentration to lapse before the spell

duration expires, the original caster may reassert control over his

spell by making a successful caster level check (DC 15 + spell level).

If he fails to do so, no one controls the spell.

Instant  Metamagic  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  7th-level  or  higher

incantatrix  can  apply  a  single  metamagic  feat  she  possesses  to  a

spell  without  preparing  it  that  way  beforehand  (if  she  prepares

spells) or increasing its casting time (if she does not prepare spells).

Thus, a wizards prepared spell works as if she had prepared it with

the metamagic feat, but it does not use a higher-level spell slot. A

sorcerer or bards spell is cast without adjusting its casting time, but

it works as if he had cast it with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level

incantatrix can use this power twice per day.

Snatch Spell (Su): At 8th level, an incantatrix can attempt to

seize control over a persistent effect created by another spellcaster.

The effect must be one that does not depend on concentration but

still relies on or responds to the casters control (such as a summon

monster spell or spiritual weapon, but not a wall of  re or acid

fog). Furthermore, the effect (but not necessarily the spellcaster)

must be within 30 feet of the incantatrix. The target spellcaster

and the incantatrix make an opposed caster level check. A divine

spellcaster receives a +2 bonus on this check. If the incantatrix

wins,  she  gains  control  of  the  spell  until  its  original  duration

expires.  The  spell  functions  as  though  the  incantatrix  had  cast

it, except that any variables determined when the spell was cast

(including its caster level) remain as determined by the caster. The

original caster can be affected by his own spell, though he receives

a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw allowed against it.

If the spell is dismissible and the incantatrix wishes to dismiss it,

she must make a second successful opposed caster level check to

do so. If she fails, the spell remains in effect and control reverts

to the original caster.

Improved  Metamagic  (Su):  At  10th  level,  an  incantatrix  has

mastered  metamagic  to  such  an  extent  that  whenever  she  uses

a  metamagic  feat,  the  required  increase  in  spell  level  (if  any)  is

reduced by one (minimum +1 spell level). For example, a wizard

incantatrix could prepare a quickened  reball as a 6th-level spell

instead of a 7th-level spell.

This bene t also applies to the incantatrixs other class abili-

ties. Thus, the DC for using her metamagic effect or cooperative

metamagic ability is reduced appropriately for the metamagic feats

involved,  and  she  spends  fewer  charges  when  using  metamagic

spell trigger.

Justiciar of Tyr

As servants of the god of justice, priests of Tyr are expected to

be paragons of law and order who embody the principles espoused

by the Maimed God at all times. Justiciars are the very elite of

Tyrs  mortal  servants,  and  they  act  as  living  embodiments  of

their gods portfolio. They battle lawlessness and injustice with the

same fervor that paladins battle evil, neither asking nor giving

quarter in their quest to bring perfect, utopian order to Faern.

Some individual justiciars are permanently stationed in large cities

with a strong Tyrran presence to serve as judges or magistrates.

Others are assigned to travel frontier regions such as the North

and establish law and civil order in the small towns that dot the

wild  lands  of  Faern.  High-level  justiciars  sometimes  travel  to

the  planes  of  Chaos  to  strike  directly  against  outsiders  such  as

slaadi or demons.

Clerics and paladins make up the vast majority of justiciars, but a

fair number come from the ranks of multiclass  ghter/clerics, and

a few were rangers before taking up the prestige class. Rogue/cleric

justiciars  are  very  rare,  but  not  completely  unknown.  Multiclass

monks,  sorcerers,  and  wizards,  however,  are  all  but  unheard  of

among  the  ranks  of  the  justiciars.  Because  of  alignment  restric-

tions, barbarians, bards, and druids are never justiciars of Tyr.

Paladins of Tyr may freely multiclass as justiciars of Tyr.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a justiciar of Tyr, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills:  Diplomacy  7  ranks,  Knowledge  ([any

one  region]  local)  4  ranks,  Knowledge  (religion)

6 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast 2nd-level divine spells.

Patron Deity: Tyr.

CLASS SKILLS

The  justiciar  of  Tyrs  class  skills

(and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),

Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal

(Wis),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),

Knowledge  (local)  (Int),  Knowl-

edge (the planes) (Int),  Knowledge

(religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and

Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the justi-

ciar of Tyr prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Justiciars of Tyr

are  pro cient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,

but not with any armor or shields. Armor check pen-

alties  for  armor  heavier  than  leather  apply  to  the  skills

Balance,  Climb,  Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,

Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor check

penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new justiciar of Tyr level is

gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever divine spell-

casting class granted her access to 2nd-level spells before she added

the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item

creation feats, bard or assassin abilities, and so on), except for an

increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that

she  adds  the  level  of  justiciar  to  the  level  of

whatever other divine spellcasting class granted

her access to 2nd-level spells, then determines spells

per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spell-

casting  class  that  granted  access  to  2nd-level  spells

before she became a justiciar of Tyr, she must decide to

which class she adds each level of justiciar for the pur-

pose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Detect  Chaos  (Sp):  At  1st  level,  the  justiciar

of Tyr may use detect chaos at will (caster level

equals justiciar of Tyrs divine caster level).

Smite  Anarchy  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  1st-

level  justiciar  of  Tyr  may  attempt  to  smite

a  chaotic  opponent  with  one  normal  melee

attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any)

to the attack roll and deals 1 extra point of

damage per justiciar of Tyr level. For ex-

ample, a 4th-level justiciar of Tyr armed

with  a  longsword  would  deal  1d8+4

points  of  damage,  plus  any  additional

bonuses from high strength or magical

effects that normally apply. If a justiciar

of Tyr accidentally smites a creature that is

not chaotic, the smite has no effect but is still used up for

that day. The justiciar can use this ability twice per day at 5th

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Bureaucratic  Knowledge  (Ex):  Although  battling  the  forces  of

chaos is one of the primary functions of the justiciar, she is also

expected  to  have  a  thorough  grasp  of  legal  processes  in  civiliza-

tions all across Faern. Beginning at 2nd level, the character gains

a bonus equal to her justiciar of Tyr level on all Knowledge and

Gather  Information  checks  related  to  laws  or  legal  proceedings

(such as recalling whether carrying weapons is illegal in a certain

city or researching proper courtroom etiquette). She also gains the

same  bonus  on  Charisma-based  skill  or  ability  checks  made  to

argue legal matters.

Axiomatic  Spellcasting  (Ex):  When  the

justiciar  of  Tyr  reaches  3rd  level,  her

devotion  to  the  cause  of  law  infuses

and empowers her spells. The save DC (if any) for any spell

with  the  lawful  descriptor  that  she  casts  increases  by  +1.

This increase rises to +2 at 9th level.

Detect Lie (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, the justiciar of

Tyr may use detect lie (caster level equals justiciar of Tyrs

divine caster level) once per day.

Aura of Absolute Law (Su): Upon attaining 10th level, the justi-

ciar of Tyr has proven herself such a shining beacon of order and

justice that chaos cannot stand against her. She is surrounded by a

constant dispel chaos effect at all times. Driving a chaotic outsider

back to its home plane or dispelling a chaotic enchantment spell

temporarily discharges and ends this effect, but the justiciar may

reactivate it as a free action on her next turn.

EX-JUSTICIARS OF TYR

A  justiciar  of  Tyr  who  slips  into  a  nonlawful  alignment  or

willingly  commits  an  unjust  act  (such  as  robbing,  as-

saulting, or murdering an innocent) loses access to her

spellcasting  abilities  and  all  justiciar  class  features

except weapon and armor pro ciencies and bureau-

cratic  knowledge.  She  regains  her  lost

abilities  and  advancement  potential

if she atones for her actions (see the

atonement  spell  on  page  201  of  the

Players Handbook).

Maimed  Gods  Boon  (Su):  Tyrs  hand  shelters  his  most

faithful servants, protecting them from the ravages of dis-

order and anarchy. At 5th level, the justiciar of Tyr gains

a  bonus  equal  to  her  Charisma  bonus  (if  any)  on  all

saving  throws

against  spells

with the cha-

otic  descriptor

and  against  the

spell-like  and

supernatural

abilities of

chaotic  outsid-

ers.  This  bonus

stacks  with  that

provided  by  the

paladins  divine

grace  ability.  (Thus,  a  paladin/justiciar  adds  her  Charisma  bonus

twice to saving throws against chaotic effects.)

Orders Calm (Su): Once per day with her touch, a justiciar of at

least 7th level may negate any of the following effects: heroism,

rage, symbol of insanity, any fear effect, or a barbarians rage ability.

To use this ability on an unwilling target, the justiciar must make

a successful melee touch attack, and the target receives a Will save

(DC 10 + 1/2 justiciar of Tyr level + justiciar of Tyrs Cha modi er)

to avoid the effect.

Blade of Justice (Su): At 8th level, the justiciar of Tyr may imbue

her melee weapon with the raw power of justice. Once per day per

point of Charisma bonus (minimum once per day), the justiciar may

cause any melee weapon she is currently wielding to behave as an

axiomatic weapon (dealing an extra 2d6 points of damage against

chaotic  foes).  If  the  justiciars  weapon  already  has  this  enhance-

ment, it gains no further bene t. Each usage of this ability is a free

action, and the effect lasts for 1 round.

Monk of the long death

Monk of the Long Death

Scattered across Faern, the monks of the long death are

members of a macabre, secretive order of scholars seeking

to understand the true nature of death.

They do not care

about the soul or

the afterlifeonly

about  the  actual

process  of  death,

speci cally  its  effects  on

living tissue. Their organi-

zation is strongest in Thay,

but outposts are scattered throughout

Faern, even in the Silver Marches.

Monks make up the majority of the

candidates for this prestige class, but clerics of the dark gods of

death  (such  as  Velsharoon,  Kiaransalee,  and  even  the  dead  god

Myrkul) are fairly common as well. Necromancers, assassins, and

other  characters  who  are  fascinated  with  death  round  out  the

orders numbers.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a monk of the long death, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills: Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, Craft (poisonmaking) 7 ranks,

Heal 3 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks.

Base Will Save Bonus: +5.

Special: The candidate must be inducted into the monks of the

long death via a secret ceremony consisting of various morbid and

hideous acts designed to test his resolve.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the monk of the long death

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Monks of the long death gain

no  pro ciency  with  any  weapon,  armor,  or  shield.  Armor  check

penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand,

and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to

Swim checks.

Deathguard (Ex): At 1st level, the monk of the long death gains

a +1 bonus on saving throws against death effects. This bonus in-

creases by 1 at every odd-numbered level (to +2 at 3rd level, +3 at

5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).

Monk Abilities (Ex): A monk of the long death has the unarmed

damage, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus of a monk whose

level is equal to his monk of the long death level (see Table 310:

The Monk on page 40 of the Players Handbook). If he also has

monk levels, his levels in the two classes stack for the purpose of

determining these abilities.

Poison Use: Monks of the long death are trained in the use of

poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when ap-

plying poison to a blade.

Macabre Shroud (Ex): Monks of the long death are disturbing

and even frightening to most people, so those who see them tend

to forget them as quickly as possible. When a monk of the long

66

death reaches 2nd level, the DC of any Gather Information, bardic

knowledge, or similar check made to learn about him increases by

an amount equal to his monk of the long death level.

Death Knell (Sp): At 3rd level, a monk of the long death may

use death knell once per day (caster level equals monk of the long

death level).

Death  Attack  (Ex):  At  6th  level,  the  monk  of  the  long  death

gains the ability to make a death attack. This ability functions like

the assassin ability of the same name, except that the save DC is 10

+ monk of the long death level + the monk of the long deaths Int

modi er  (see  page  180  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide  for  more

information).

If the monk of the long death also has the death attack ability

from another class (such as assassin), levels of that class stack with

his monk of the long death levels for the purpose of determining

the save DC.

Death Touch (Su): Once per day, a 10th-level monk of the long

death may make a death touch attack. This ability functions like

the Death domains granted power, except that the required die roll

is 1d6 per monk of the long death level.

If the monk of the long death also has the death touch ability

from another class (such as cleric), levels of that class stack with

his monk of the long death levels for the purpose of determining

the save DC.

EX-MONKS OF THE LONG DEATH

Any monk of the long death who betrays the secrets of the order,

or even attempts to leave the organization, immediately becomes

the target of assassins. These assassins begin with a EL equal to the

monk of the long deaths character level (whether a single assassin

of the same level, or several of lower levels), but each failed assas-

sination attempt increases the EL of the next group sent out by

1. If the former monk of the long death survives an assassination

attempt by a group with an EL 5 higher than his character level,

the monks of the long death stop wasting their resources on him.

Morninglord of Lathander

The Church of Lathander is well known and highly respected across

Faern. A large part of that respect comes from Lathanders elite

priests, who are known as the morninglords. Morninglords are, in

many ways, the epitome of the classical cleric archetypethey are

kindly healers and advisors, stalwart protectors, and implacable foes

of the undead. Because morninglords believe it is their duty to bring

Lathanders light to all the dark places of the world, they often

travel the breadth of Faern, preaching the glories of their god to

any who will listen and smiting his foes wherever they appear.

Clerics  comprise  the  majority  of  morninglord  candidates,  but

paladins of Lathander frequently hear the calling as well. Multi-

class  ghters, and more rarely rangers, sometimes join the ranks of

the morninglords as well, but other classes are very rare.

Paladins of Lathander can freely multiclass as morninglords of

Lathander.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of

the morninglord of Lathander prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:

Morninglords  of  Lathander  gain  no

pro ciency  with  any  weapon,  armor,

or shield. Armor check penalties for armor

heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently,

Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal

armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new morninglord of

Lathander level is gained, the character gains new spells per

day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level

in whatever divine spellcasting class granted her access to 3rd-level

spells before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain

any other bene t a character of that class would have gained (im-

proved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for

an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means

that she adds the level of morninglord of Lathander to the level

of  whatever  other  divine  spellcasting  class  granted  her  access  to

3rd-level spells, then determines spells per day, spells known, and

caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that

granted access to 3rd-level spells before she became a morning-

lord of Lathander, she must decide to which class she adds

each level of morninglord for the purpose of determin-

ing spells per day and spells known.

Bane  of  the  Restless  (Ex):  The  characters

morninglord of Lathander levels stack with her

levels in any other class that grants the ability

to turn undead for the purpose of turning

attempts.

Lathanders  Light  (Su):  Whenever  a

morninglord casts a spell with the light

descriptor, its area is doubled.

Creative Fire (Ex): Morninglords are

creative,  expressive  people,

much  like  their  god.  At

2nd  level,  the  character

gains  a  bonus  equal

to  her  morninglord  of

Lathander  level  on  all

Craft and Perform checks.

Daylight  (Sp):  At  3rd

level,  the  morninglord  of

Lathander  may  use  daylight  once

per day (caster level equals morning-

lord of Lathanders divine caster level).

Searing Ray (Sp): A 4th level, a morning-

lord of Lathander may use searing ray once per

day (caster level equals morninglord of Lathanders

divine  caster  level).  If  this  ability  is  used  against  undead,  the

damage increases as if the Empower Spell feat had been applied.

Greater  Turning  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a  morninglord  of  at  least

5th level may use greater turning. This ability functions like the

granted power of the Sun domain. At 9th level, she may use this

ability twice per day. If the morninglord of Lathander already has

access to the Sun domain, she gains an extra use per day of greater

turning at 5th level and at 9th level.

Blessing of Dawn (Su): The sight of the morning sun is an in-

spirational  vision  for  all  morninglords.

Beginning at 6th level, a morning-

lord  of  Lathander  gains  a  +2

morale bonus on Will saves from

sunrise until noon. This ability is

in  effect  only  while  she  can  see

the  sun;  the  effect  is  suppressed

any  time  she  is  deprived  of  the

sight of it during this period.

Maximize  Turning  (Su):  Once

per  day,  a  morninglord  of  at

least 7th level can automatically

achieve  the  maximum  possible

result on a turning damage roll.

Rejuvenation  of  the  Morn

(Su): Dawn is a powerful symbol

of rebirth and renewal. Once per

tenday, a morninglord of at least

8th level may spend one uninter-

rupted hour before dawn praying

to Lathander. As soon as the sun

rises  after  this  prayer  ritual,  she

gains  one  bene t  of  her  choice

from the following list.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Purple Dragon Knight

The famed Purple Dragons make up the bulk of Cormyrs stand-

ing army. These highly trained soldiers, coupled with the fearsome

War Wizards of Cormyr, have defended the Forest Kingdom from

all manner of threats, from savage humanoids to the mysterious

shades. The Purple Dragon knight, one of the armys high-ranking

of cers, can command from ten to a hundred or more soldiers on

the battle eld. Being awarded the rank of Purple Dragon knight is

a great honor for any Cormyrian.

Fighters,  rangers,  and  paladins

make  up  the  majority  of  the

Purple  Dragon  knights,  but  a

few  are  bards,  clerics,  or  rogues.

Sorcerers  and  wizards,  while

not  outright  forbidden  from

joining  the  Purple  Dragons,

almost  always  join  the  War

Wizards,  Cormyrs  elite  brigade

of  combat-trained  spellcasters,

instead.  Barbarians,  druids,  and

monks  seldom  join  the  ranks  of

the Purple Dragon knights, being

either  too  undisciplined  or  too

uncivilized.

Having  levels  in  this  prestige

class  implies  at  least  a  nominal

degree  of  military  service  in

Cormyr, and thus the class might

not  be  appropriate  for  all

campaigns.

Hit Die: d10.

not restore ability damage or ability drain caused by poison or

disease.

TFull restoration of ability damage due to one poison or disease.

If  the  morninglords  prayers  are  interrupted  for  even  a  single

round, the attempt is ruined, and she must wait a full tenday to

try again.

Aura of Radiance (Su): When the morninglord of Lathander

reaches  10th  level,  the  light  of  Lathander  shines  perpetually

upon  her.  No  matter  how  dark  it  is,  the  morninglord  sees  as

though the conditions were identical to the outdoors at sunrise.

This ability functions like darkvision out to 60 feet, except that

the morninglord sees in color. The morninglord also gains a +2

sacred bonus on saving throws against spells with the darkness

descriptor and a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class against attacks

from undead creatures.

nonchaotic.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Purple Dragon knight

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Purple Dragon knights gain no

pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check pen-

alties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand,

and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies

to Swim checks.

Heroic  Shield  (Ex):  Beginning  at  1st  level,  when  the  Purple

Dragon knight uses the aid another action (see page 154

of  the  Players  Handbook)  to  improve  an

allys AC, his effort grants a +4 circum-

stance bonus instead of the normal +2.

day, a Purple Dragon knight can utter

a  powerful  shout  (usually  For

Cormyr!)  that  grants  him  a  +1

morale bonus on his next attack

roll  and  increases  his  land  speed

by 5 feet until his next turn.

These  same  bene ts  also

extend  to  each  of  his  allies

within  60  feet.  Traditionally,

the rallying cry is used when a for-

mation of soldiers is about to

charge.  Rallying  cry

is  a  mind-affecting

ability.

Inspire  Courage  (Su):

Once per day at 2nd level,

the  Purple  Dragon  knight

can  make  an  inspirational

speech  to  bolster  his  allies

and  himself  against  fear  and

improve the groups combat abili-

ties.  This  ability  functions  like  the

inspire courage function of the bardic

music  ability.  Each  affected  creature,

including  the  knight  himself,  gains  a  +2

morale bonus on saving throws against charm

or fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage

rolls. To gain these bene ts, an ally must hear the Purple Dragon

knight speak for 1 full round. The effect lasts as long as the ally can

hear the knight speak and for 5 rounds afterward. While speaking,

the Purple Dragon knight can  ght, but he cannot cast spells or

activate magic items by either spell completion (such as scrolls) or

command word (such as wands).

At 4th level, the Purple Dragon knight may

inspire courage one additional time per day.

Fear  (Sp):  Once  per  day,  a  3rd-

level  or  higher  Purple  Dragon

knight may evoke a fear effect

that functions like the spell

of  the  same  name  (caster

level equals Purple Dragon

knights character level).

Oath  of  Wrath  (Su):

At 4th level, the Purple

Dragon  knight  may  select

a single opponent within 60 feet and

swear  to  defeat  him.  For  the  duration

of  the  encounter,  the  knight  gains  a  +2

morale bonus on melee attack rolls, weapon

damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks

made  against  the  challenged

target. The effect is negated

immediately  if  the  Purple

Dragon  knight  attacks  or  targets  a

spell  against  any  hostile  creature  other

than  the  challenged  target.  Attacks

of  opportunity  and  spells  cast  on

allies do not count, nor do spells

such  as   reball  that  may  catch

other creatures in their areas. The

Purple  Dragon  knight  can  use  oath

of wrath once per day.

Final Stand (Su): Once per day, a Purple

Dragon knight of at least 5th level can inspire

his troops to a heroic effort. When he uses this

ability, the knight gains 2d10 temporary hit points,

and so does each ally within 10 feet of him. This ability

can affect a maximum number of creatures equal to the

characters Purple Dragon knight level + the Purple Dragon

knights Cha modi er, and the effect lasts for an equal number

of rounds.

Runecaster

Runecaster

Though originally developed by the dwarves and giants, the abil-

ity to create runes of power has spread far beyond the hills and

mountains.  Those  who  choose  to  master  this  ability,  known  as

runecasters,  can  create  incredibly  potent  symbols  that  last  for

multiple uses and can be triggered without so much as a touch. An

established runecasters belongings are usually adorned with many

runes, which make them not only impressive-looking items, but also

true threats to thieves.

Since a majority of those who practice this technique are dwarves

and giants, it is not surprising that most runecasters come from the

cleric or adept class. Some rangers and paladins have also chosen

to become runecasters, particularly since the Thunder Blessing has

resulted in many young dwarves leaving home to explore the wilder-

ness. A few rare druids have chosen the path of the runecaster as

well, although generally only in places where druids are so scarce

that they have to rely on runes to protect a large area. Runecast-

ing clerics and paladins use their abilities to protect their temples

and holy items, while ranger runecasters use them to guard trails,

protect lairs of threatened animals, and defend natural refuges.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a runecaster, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Skills: Spellcraft 8 ranks, Craft (calligraphy, gemcutting, metal-

working, stonecarving, or woodcarving) 8 ranks.

Feat: Inscribe Rune.

Spells: Able to cast 3rd-level divine spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The runecasters class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),

Knowledge  (arcana),  (Int),  Knowledge  (religion)  (Int),  Profession

(Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  runecaster  prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Runecasters gain no pro ciency

with any weapon, armor, or shield.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  When  a  new  runecaster  level  is

gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if  applicable)  as  if  he  had  also  gained  a  level  in  whatever  divine

spellcasting class granted him access to 3rd-level spells before he

added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other ben-

e t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of

turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased ef-

fective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the

level of runecaster to the level of whatever other divine spellcasting

class granted him access to 3rd-level spells, then determines spells

per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class that

granted access to 3rd-level spells before he became a runecaster, he

must decide to which class he adds each level of runecaster for the

purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.

Rune Craft (Ex): At 1st level, the runecaster gains a +1 bonus on

Craft checks made to inscribe runes. This bonus increases to +2 at

4th level and to +3 at 7th level.

to the base price of the rune.

Improved Runecasting (Su): As a runecaster rises in level, he gains

the ability to create runes that function more than once and have

70

12/18/03, 11:59:16 AM

PRESTIGE CLASSES

different kinds of triggers. These extra features increase the cost of

the rune, as shown on the table.

Works  When  Read  or  Passed: Any  attempt  to  study,  identify,

or fathom a runes meaning counts as reading the rune. Passing

through  any  portal  that  bears  a  rune  counts  as  passing  it.  To

affect a target, a rune must have an unbroken line of effect to it

and be within 30 feet of it.

A rune that is triggered when passed can be set for almost any

special  condition  the  runecaster  speci es.  Runes  can  be  set  to

trigger  according  to  physical  characteristics  (such  as  height  or

weight) or creature type, subtype, or race (such as drow

or  aberration).  They  can  also  trigger  based  on

good, evil, law, or chaos, or a creatures patron

deity. They cannot, however, be set to trigger by

class,  Hit  Dice,  or  level.  Runes  respond  to  in-

visible creatures normally but are not

triggered by creatures that travel past

them ethereally. When placing a rune

with  a  pass  trigger,  a  runecaster  can

specify a password or phrase that prevents

the rune from triggering.

ecaster  reaches  2nd  level,  his

runes  become  more  potent.

The  DC  for  all  attempts

to  erase,  dispel,  or  dis-

able his runes, and for

caster  level  checks  to

overcome  the  spell  resistance  of  their  targets,  in-

creases by 1. This increase does not apply to the DC of

the saving throw (if any) to resist a runes effect. This

increase rises to 2 at 5th level and to 3 at 9th level.

Maximize Rune (Ex): At 6th level, the runecaster can

create runes whose effects are maximized, as if by the Maxi-

mize Spell feat, without altering the level of the spell used to

create the rune. Maximizing a rune adds 5 to the DC of the Craft

check required to inscribe it.

Rune Chant (Ex): A 10th-level runecaster may cast any divine

spell to which he has access at +1 caster level by tracing a rune in

the air as an extra somatic component. For spells with a casting

time of 1 action, using this ability increases the casting time to 1

full round. The casting time for all other spells increases by 1 round

when rune chant is used. This ability cannot be used on stilled spells,

and it does not function with the maximize rune ability.

Shaaryan Hunter

Though they almost never leave their homeland, Shaaryans have

a  reputation  as  wily  bandits,  masterful  horsemen,  and  uncanny

hunters.  While  allegations  of  banditry  are  not  universally  true,

nearly every able-bodied Shaaryan is a capable rider, and a goodly

number of them are indeed trackers and hunters of no small skill.

On the backs of their swift horses, Shaaryan hunters can run down

even the fastest prey and either spear it with a lance or pelt it with

arrows from horseback. Most Shaaryan hunters stay within their

homeland, providing food and materials for their tribes, but a rare

few venture out into Faern to seek adventure. Such nomads usually

become wilderness guides or bounty hunters.

Rangers  and  barbarians  make  up  the  majority  of  Shaaryan

hunter  candidates,  but  rogues  are  reasonably  common  as  well.

Druids very rarely take up the life of the hunter, and members of

the other classes almost never have the wilderness survival skills

necessary for the prestige class.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Shaaryan hunter, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Region: The Shaar.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Handle Animal 4 ranks,

Ride 6 ranks, Survival 8

ranks.

Feats:  Animal

Af nity, Mounted

Archery, Mounted

Combat, Track.

CLASS SKILLS

The Shaaryan hunters class skills (and

the  key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Climb

(Str),  Craft  (Int),  Handle  Animal  (Cha),

Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowl-

edge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (Shaar local)

Profession  (Wis),  Ride  (Dex),  Search  (Int),

Spot  (Wis),  Survival  (Wis),  Swim  (Str),  and

PRESTIGE CLASSES

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the Shaaryan hunter prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Shaaryan hunters gain no pro-

 ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Ride Bonus (Ex): At 1st level, the Shaaryan hunter gains a +2

competence bonus on Ride checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th

level, to +6 at 7th level, and to +8 at 10th level.

Mounted Tracking (Ex): Shaaryan hunters are skilled at following

tracks from horseback. Beginning at 2nd level, a Shaaryan hunter

may move at one-half her mounts base speed without taking penal-

ties on Survival checks made to track. At 6th level, she may move

at her mounts full speed while tracking with no penalty on checks

made to track.

Burst  of  Speed  (Ex):  Beginning  at  3rd  level,  the  Shaaryan

hunter can urge her mount to move at double its normal speed

for 1 round. During this round, the mount charges at double the

new  speed  and  runs  at  quadruple  the  new  speed.  This  ability  is

usable once per day without danger to the mount. If the Shaaryan

hunter attempts to use the ability a second time in the same day,

her mount must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 20) or take

1d6 points of damage. Each additional time she uses the ability

in the same day, her mount must make a new Fortitude save at

the same DC, and the damage increases by 1d6 points over that

for the previous attempt. Thus, the third use of this ability in one

day deals 2d6 points of damage, the fourth use deals 3d6 points

of damage, and so on.

Mounted Accuracy (Ex): Shaaryan hunters are almost as skilled

as the legendary Tuigan Horde when  ring a bow from horseback.

Beginning at 4th level, the Shaaryan hunter gains a +2 competence

bonus  on  ranged  attack  rolls  made  from  horseback.  When  she

reaches 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Spirited Charge (Ex): At 5th level, the Shaaryan hunter receives

Spirited Charge as a bonus feat if she does not already have it. She

need not meet the prerequisites for this feat.

Long Riding (Ex): At 7th level, the Shaaryan hunter has learned

how to coax extra endurance from her mount so that she can ride

longer and at a higher average speed. When traveling overland, her

mount moves at 150% of its normal overland speed. This ability

does not increase the creatures speed in combat.

Born in the Saddle (Ex): When the Shaaryan hunter reaches 8th

level, her mastery of horsemanship enables her to perform unbeliev-

able stunts. Once per day while mounted, she may elect to make a

Ride check in place of any one attack roll, saving throw, or skill

check. She uses her total Ride modi er but gains no modi ers from

other sources (such as a weapons enhancement bonus or a feat that

increases her saving throw bonus).

Shadow Adept

Some spellcasters who discover the existence of the Shadow Weave

are cautious about using it, altering their magic slowly to take ad-

vantage of its effects. Others are more reckless, hurling themselves

into the abyss of the Shadow Weave immediately to acquire all the

gifts available to the casual student and discover secrets unavail-

able to all but the most dedicated. These latter spellcasters are the

shadow  adepts,  who  make  great  sacri ces  with  respect  to  some

aspects of the Art in order to reap greater bene ts elsewhere.

Most  shadow  adepts  were  previously  sorcerers  or  wizards,  and

these are the ones who stand to gain the greatest power from adopt-

ing this path. Any spellcaster can tap the Shadow Weave, however,

and a few bards, druids, and rangers have also been known to make

this choice. Among clerics, only the followers of Shar are common

in the ranks of the shadow adepts.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a shadow adept, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nongood.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Spellcraft 8 ranks.

Feats: Shadow Weave Magic, any one metamagic feat.

Spells: Able to cast 3rd-level arcane or divine spells.

CLASS SKILLS

The shadow adepts class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Disguise (Cha), Hide

(Dex),  Knowledge  (all  skills,  taken  individually)  (Int),  Profession

(Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the shadow adept prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Shadow adepts gain no pro ciency

with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties for armor

heavier  than  leather  apply  to  the  skills  Balance,  Climb,  Escape

Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and

double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new shadow adept level is

gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if

applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting

class granted him access to 3rd-level spells before he added the pres-

tige class. He does not, however, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation

feats, improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and so on),

except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially

means that he adds the level of shadow adept to the level of whatever

other spellcasting class granted him access to 3rd-level spells, then

determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

Shadow  Feats:  At  1st  level,  a

shadow adept gains Insidious Magic,

Pernicious  Magic,  and  Tenacious

Magic  as  bonus  feats  if  he  doesnt

already have them.

Low-Light  Vision  (Ex):  At  2nd

level,  a  shadow  adept  gains  low-light

vision if he doesnt already have it.

Shadow Defense (Ex): At 3rd level, a

shadow adept gains resistance to the kinds

of spells that are favored by the Shadow

Weave. He gains a +1 profane bonus on

saving throws against spells from the

schools  of  enchantment,  illusion,  and

necromancy, as well as spells with the dark-

ness descriptor. This bonus increases to +2

at 6th level and to +3 at 9th level.

Shield  of  Shadows  (Su):  A  shadow

adept  of  at  least  4th  level  can

surround himself with a globe of purple-

black  force  as  a  standard  action.  This  shield  of

shadows  functions  like  a  shield  spell,  granting  him  a  +4  shield

bonus to AC and absorbing magic missiles cast at him. In addition,

the  shield  of  shadows  provides  concealment  (20%  miss  chance)

against melee and ranged attacks. The shadow adept can see and

reach through the shield, so it does not provide cover or conceal-

ment to opponents.

The shadow adept may use a shield of shadows for up to 1 round

per caster level per day. This duration need not be consecutivethe

shadow adept may break it up into increments as small as 1 round

if he so desires. Creating or dismissing the shield of shadows is a

standard action.

When  the  shadow  adept

were  under  the  effect  of  a  spell

resistance spell.

Darkvision (Su): At 7th level, a

shadow adept can see in the dark

as though he were permanently

affected by a darkvision spell.

Shadow Walk (Sp): A shadow

adept of at least 7th level can use

shadow walk once per day (caster

level equals shadow adept level).

Shadow  Double  (Su):  Once  per

day,  a  10th-level  shadow  adept

can use a standard action to create

a  double  of  himself  woven  from

shadowstuff.  The  double  has  the

ability  scores,  base  AC,  hit  points,

saves,  and  attack  bonuses  of  its

creator,  but  no  equipment.  (Any

apparent  clothing  or  equipment

is  nonfunctional.)  Since  it  can  use

anything its creator can, the double

can attack the creators enemies if given

a weapon or item with which to do so. Alternatively, it

can function as the target of a project image spell, duplicating the

creators actions and functioning as the origin of the creators spells

when it is within his direct line of sight. Mentally commanding the

double is a free action. Using it as the originator of a spell counts as

an action of the sort needed to cast the spell for both the creator

and the double. Causing either the creator or the double to leave the

plane they share dismisses the double.

The double lasts 1 round per caster level. The death of the double

does not affect the shadow adept or vice versa. If its creator dies,

the shadow double still lasts until its duration expires.

Shadow Thief of Amn

The organization known as the Shadow Thieves is the largest and

most prosperous thieves guild in all of Faern. Its success is derived

from its system of interlocking guilds, each dedicated to the twin

goals of pro t and power. From the organizations stronghold in

Amn, this series of guilds controls the lions share of all criminal

operations along the Sword Coast, and it also reaches beyond that

area into many other parts of Faern. As a member of a Shadow

Thieves guild, a shadow thief of Amn knows only her own

minions,  her  coworkers,  and  her  superior.  This  web  of

secrecy  preserves  the  organization,

because any members who are cap-

tured can sell out only a few others.

Most shadow thieves of Amn were

previously  rogues,  although  specialists

in  some  criminal   elds  are  more  likely

to  have  backgrounds  as   ghters  or  rangers.

Clerics of evil deities (particularly Mask and

Shar)  take  up  this  path  to   ll  certain  roles  in

the  eld, and sorcerers and wizards also have

important roles. Shadow thieves excel at work-

ing  with  others,  intimidating  common  folk,

administering punitive beatings, and acquir-

ing important contacts.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  shadow  thief

of  Amn,  a  character  must  ful ll  all  the  following

criteria.

Skills: Bluff 3 ranks, Gather Information 3 ranks, Hide 8

ranks, Intimidate 3 ranks, Move Silently 3 ranks.

Feat: Persuasive.

Special:  The  candidate  must  be  a  member  of  a  Shadow

Thieves guild.

Profession  (Wis),  Search  (Int),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  Spot  (Wis),

and Use Rope (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the shadow thief of

Amn prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Shadow  thieves  of

Amn  gain  pro ciency  with  all  simple  weapons  and

with light armor. Armor check penalties for armor

heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Si-

lently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and  Tumble,  and

double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty

applies to Swim checks.

Doublespeak  (Ex):  A  shadow  thief  of

Amn is adept at talking her way out of tight

places. At 1st level, she gains a +2 bonus on all

Bluff and Diplomacy checks.

Sneak  Attack  (Ex):  This  ability  functions

like  the  rogue  ability  of  the  same  name.

The  extra  damage  dealt  increases  by  1d6

points at 1st level, by another 1d6 points

at 3rd level, and another 1d6 points at

5th  level.  If  a  shadow  thief  of  Amn

gets a sneak attack bonus from an-

other source (such as rogue levels)

the bonuses on damage stack. Fur-

thermore, shadow thief of Amn levels

stack with any other appropriate class levels

(such as rogue or assassin) for the purpose of overcoming improved

uncanny dodge.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level and again at 4th level, a shadow thief

of Amn gains a bonus feat of her choice from the following list:

Acrobatic, Agile, Alertness, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Deceit-

ful,  Deft  Hands,  Exotic  Weapon  Pro ciency  (hand  crossbow  or

shuriken), Improved Feint, Leadership, Lightning Re exes, Nego-

tiator,  Nimble  Fingers,  Persuasive,  Track,  Skill  Focus  (any  guild

thief class skill), Silent Spell, Stealthy, Still Spell, Weapon Finesse,

Weapon Focus (any). She must meet any prerequisites for a feat in

order to select it.

Uncanny  Dodge  (Ex):  At  2nd  level,  a  shadow  thief  of  Amn

gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would nor-

mally allow her to even be aware of it. She retains her Dexterity

bonus  to  AC  (if  any)  regardless  of  being  caught   at-footed  or

struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses any Dexterity bonus

to AC if immobilized.) If a shadow thief of Amn already has the

uncanny  dodge  ability  from  another  class,  she  gains  improved

uncanny  dodge  (see  the  rogue  class  description  in  the  Players

Handbook) instead.

Reputation (Ex): By the time she reaches 3rd level, a shadow

thiefs  infamy  grants  her  a  +1  bonus  to  her  Leadership  score

(see the Leadership feat description on page 106 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level and to

+3  at  5th  level.  Usually,  a  shadow  thief  of  Amn  who  has  an

interest in collecting followers maintains a permanent base of

operations within a city, which gives her an additional +2 bonus

to her Leadership score.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, a

shadow  thief  of  Amn  can  no  longer  be   anked,

since she can react to opponents on opposite sides

of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker.

This defense denies rogues the ability to use  ank at-

tacks to sneak attack the shadow thief of Amn. The

exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four

levels higher than the shadow thief can  ank her

(and thus sneak attack her).

If  the  shadow  thief  of  Amn  already  has  im-

proved  uncanny  dodge,  the  levels  from  any  other

classes granting uncanny dodge stack for the purpose

of determining the minimum rogue level required to

 ank her.

Spellguard

of Silverymoon

As the bastion of civilization in the savage North, the

city of Silverymoon attracts a great deal of attention

from the fell creatures that inhabit the snow-shrouded

forests. Evil giants, trolls, dark elves, and creatures of

an  even  fouler  bent  scheme  to  make  the  Gem  of  the

North  fall.  Fortunately  for  the  Silvaeren,  the  city  is

well  defended  against  such  threats.  The  Spellguard,

Silverymoons  elite  cadre  of  battle-trained  arcane

spellcasters,  protects  the  city  against  the  threat  of

hostile  magic  and  aids  the  Knights  in  Silver  against

more mundane threats.

Sorcerers and wizards are the most likely characters to become

spellguards. At present, there are no bards in the Spellguard, but

there is no reason why such a character might not join the organiza-

tion. Multiclass characters are rare in the Spellguard, but  ghters

and rogues with levels in arcane spellcasting classes are sought after

for their versatility in the  eld.

Having  levels  in  this  prestige  class  implies  at  least  a  nominal

degree of military service in Silverymoon. Thus, the class might

not be appropriate for all campaigns.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a spellguard of Silverymoon, a character must

ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Region: Silverymoon or Silver Marches.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Feats: Combat Casting, any one metamagic feat.

Spells: Able to cast 4th-level arcane spells.

Special: The candidate must be accepted into the

Spellguard.

CLASS SKILLS

The  spellguard  of  Silverymoons  class  skills  (and

the  key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Concentration

(Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge

(all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis),

Spellcraft (Int), and Spot (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All the following are class features of the spellguard

of Silverymoon prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Spellguards  of

Silverymoon gain no pro ciency with any weapon,

armor,  or  shield.  Armor  check  penalties  for  armor

heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of

Hand,  and  Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor

check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Spells  per  Day/Spells  Known:  When  a  new  spell-

guard of Silverymoon level is gained, the character

gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he

had also gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class granted

him access to 4th-level spells before he added the prestige class. He

does not, however, gain any other bene t a character of that class

would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, bard

or  assassin  abilities,  and  so  on),  except  for  an  increased  effective

level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the level

of spellguard of Silverymoon to the level of whatever other arcane

spellcasting class granted him access to 4th-level spells, then deter-

mines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class that

granted access to 4th-level spells before he became a spellguard of

Silverymoon, he must decide to which class he adds each level of

spellguard for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells

known.

Obligation:  The  Spellguard  is  a  military  unit,  not  just  a  loose

fraternity of mages. As such, each spellguard of Silverymoon must

spend at least two days out of every tenday on active duty, usually

either guarding the walls of Silverymoon itself or patrolling the

surrounding area with a detachment of the Knights in Silver.

Token:  As  a  member  of  the  Spellguard,  a  1st-level  spellguard

of Silverymoon receives an adrath tokena small metal disk that

allows him to cast spells that are normally forbidden by the mythal.

As long as he has this token in his possession, he may cast conjura-

tion (summoning) spells, evocation [ re] spells, and spells with the

teleportation descriptor within the wards of Silverymoon. He may

also freely use magic items that produce those effects.

This  token  does  not  magically  appear  in  the  spellguards  pos-

session;  he  must  return  to  Silverymoon  to  receive  it  from  his

superior.

Ward Attunement: Each 1st-level spellguard of Silverymoon is

inducted formally into the order through an elaborate ceremony

held in the High Palace of Silverymoon. This ceremony attunes the

spellguard to the mythal that surrounds Silverymoon without the

2,500 XP cost normally required. See the sidebar for information

on ward attunement.

Metamagic Feat: At 2nd level and again at 4th level, the spell-

guard may select any metamagic feat he does not already have as

a bonus feat. He must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to

select it.

Selective Spell (Su): Spellguards are speci cally trained to mini-

mize collateral damage when casting their combat spells. Once per

day  per  point  of  Intelligence  bonus  (minimum  once  per  day),  a

spellguard  of  at  least  3rd  level  may  designate  a  single  type  (and

subtype, if desired) of creature when casting a spell. When a single

creature type has multiple subtypes, the spellguard may choose to

count only one of the subtypes or all of them, at his discretion. At

the spellguards option, that type of creature is either the only type

affected by the spell or the only type unaffected by it. Inorganic

material, objects, and anything else that does not have a creature

type is affected normally. Casting a selective spell requires a full-

round action.

For example, suppose a spellguard is patrolling the forest around

Silverymoon  with  a  party  of  Knights  in  Silver  made  up  of  two

humans, an elf, and a dwarf. Suddenly, the group is rushed by gob-

lins. The spellguard uses his selective spell ability to cast a  reball,

designating humanoid (goblinoid) as the only creature type affected.

The  reball detonates in the midst of the melee, and although the

spellguards companions are within the area of the spell, they are

spared any ill effects.

At 5th level, the spellguard may designate multiple creature types

and subtypes for a selective spell. Each type or subtype so desig-

nated, however, uses up one additional use per day of his selective

spell ability.

Spellguard (Su): The Spellguard was originally formed to protect

High Lady Alustriel from personal attacks. Though that purpose

has largely become secondary to defending the city, spellguards still

receive some training in serving as bodyguards. At 4th level, the

spellguard of Silverymoon may cast any personal-range defensive

arcane spell on another character with a touch. For this purpose,

a defensive spell is one that improves AC, increases a saving throw

The Wards of Silverymoon

The city of Silverymoon is protected by a powerful magical effect

called a mythal. This potent form of elven high magic forbids the

casting of several types of spells, causes other spells to be perma-

nently in effect, and allows the denizens of Silverymoon to use

still other spells with a word. The mythals effects cover the city

itself, plus an area 1,000 yards beyond its limits in all directions

(even up into the sky and down into the earth).

Spells  with  the  death,  evil,  or  teleportation  descriptor,

conjuration (summoning) spells, and evocation [ re] spells are

all  forbidden  by  the  mythal  of  Silverymoon.  Any  attempt  to

cast such a spell fails automatically, though the spell slot is used

up normally.

The following spells are continually in effect throughout the

area of the mythal, much like a spell  xed to a hallow or unhal-

low effect: antipathy (to all evil-aligned demons, devils, dragons,

drow, duergar, giants, goblinoids, mind  ayers, orcs, and trolls),

detect scrying (all creatures within the mythal gain the bene ts

of this effect), invisibility purge, negative energy protection, and

protection from evil.

Finally, characters attuned to the mythal may activate any of

the  following  spells  by  command  word,  exactly  as  if  it  were  an

ability of a magic item in the characters possession: air walk, bless

weapon, bulls strength, cats grace, control water, discern lies, dispel

chaos, dispel evil, feather fall, lesser ironguard*, quench, remove

curse, remove paralysis, shield, shocking grasp, silence, and tongues.

See the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting

Becoming attuned to Silverymoons mythal requires a special

ceremony that lasts a full day, plus the expenditure of 2,500 XP.

Attunement also requires the aid and approval of Azuth, Mystra,

or one of the leaders of the city.

More  information  on  Silverymoons  wards  can  be  found  on

page 57 of The Silver Marches.

or by bestowing temporary hit points).

Spell Power (Ex): At 5th level, the spellguards effective caster

level increases by 1 for the purpose of determining level-dependent

variables and making caster level checks.

EX-SPELLGUARDS

A  spellguard  of  Silverymoon  who  is  derelict  in  his  duty,  betrays

Silverymoon or the Silver Marches, or otherwise acts in a manner

inappropriate for a military of cer of his stature is cast out of the

Spellguard. His ward token is deactivated, and his attunement to

the mythal is nulli ed. He retains all the other class abilities of a

spellguard of Silverymoon, but he can no longer advance in the

prestige class. He regains his abilities and advancement poten-

tial if he atones for his actions (see the atonement spell on

page 201 of the Players Handbook).

A character may at any time choose to retire from

the Spellguard. A retiree is expected to hand in his

adrath token, but he retains all other class abilities

except his obligation to serve. A retired spell-

guard may no longer gain levels

in  this  prestige  class.  Under

exceptional  circumstances,

however, a retired spellguard

may reenlist and regain the abil-

ity to advance as a spellguard of

Silverymoon.

Zhentarim Spy

The  Zhentarim  is  among  the

most  famed  and  feared  secret

organizations  in  Faern.  Its  members

have their hands in nearly every illicit

business imaginable, from assassination

to  drug  traf cking  to  slavery.  Though  there

are  many  diverse  character  types  within  its

ranks, the Zhentarim spy is probably the one Faernians

encounter most ofteneven if they never realize it.

Most  Zhentarim  spies  were  previously  rogues  or  bards,  but  a

small number of monks, sorcerers, and wizards also  nd the job

to  their  liking.  Fighters,  barbarians,  and  rangers  are  usually  too

unsubtle for the tasks of a spy, while the types of clerics and druids

the Zhentarim attract tend to have religious habits that make it

dif cult for them to blend in with others.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Zhentarim spy, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Zhentarim  spies  are  pro cient

with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with

shields. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply

to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Si-

lently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor

check penalty applies to Swim checks.

Cover  Identity  (Ex):  A  Zhentarim  spy  is  rigorously  trained  to

establish nearly  awless cover identities. For every distinct Craft or

Profession skill in which she has at least 2 ranks, she may have one

cover identity. Each cover identity must be a speci c person (such as

Jolan Turnbuckle, bread-baker for the town of Shadowdale), not

a generic description (such as baker). She may at any time end an

existing cover identity and establish a new one in its place.

While operating under any of her cover identities, she gains a +4

circumstance bonus on Disguise checks and a +2 bonus on Bluff and

Gather Information checks. For each additional 2 ranks (beyond the

minimum 2) that the Zhentarim spy possesses in a cover identitys

associated Craft or Profession skill, each of these bonuses increases

by  1.  At  the  DMs  discretion,  these  bonuses  may  be  reduced  or

eliminated in regions where the cover identity would seem out of

place (bakers from Shadowdale, for example, would attract suspicion

in the ruins of Myth Drannor).

Establishing a new cover identity or replacing an old one means

the  Zhentarim  spy  must  acquire  documentation  and  personal  ef-

fects, establish a place of business, and otherwise set up a believable

second life. This process takes 1d4 tendays, during which she may do

nothing else, and costs 6d10 gp. The Zhentarim spy does not need

to set up a cover identity immediately for every Craft or Profession

skill in which she has 2 ranks; she may wait until a good opportu-

nity presents itself if desired. For example, she might wish to hold

a cover identity option in reserve to take advantage of the unlikely

cover class ability (see below).

The cover identity ability does not provide any additional skills

that might be necessary to make a cover identity believable, such

as knowledge of the proper homeland, the ability to speak a foreign

language, spellcasting ability, or the like. Thus, Zhentarim spies gen-

erally pick cover identities that complement their existing skills.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This ability functions like the rogue ability of

the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by 1d6 points at

2nd level, and by another 1d6 points at 4th level. If a Zhentarim

spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue

levels), the bonuses on damage stack. Furthermore, Zhentarim spy

levels stack with any other appropriate class levels (such as rogue or

assassin) for the purpose of overcoming improved uncanny dodge.

Undetectable Alignment (Ex): At 2nd level, the Zhentarim spys

rigorous  mental  training  enables  her  to  cloud  even  divination

spells. This ability functions like the undetectable alignment spell,

except that it is always active and, as an extraordinary ability, is

subject to neither dispelling nor suppression by dead magic zones

and the like.

Poison Use (Ex): At 3rd level, a Zhentarim spy receives training

in the use of poison and never risks accidentally poisoning herself

when applying poison to a blade.

Unlikely Cover (Ex): At 3rd level, the Zhentarim spy may des-

ignate a number of cover identities equal to her Charisma bonus

(minimum  one)  as  unlikely  covers.  In  such  a  cover  identity,

she is disguised as someone drastically different from herselfa

member of the opposite sex or a different race, or someone with

a very different body shape. She may need to spend the time to

establish new cover identities if she does not have any appropri-

ate  identities  available.  While  she  operates  in  an  unlikely  cover,

her normal bonuses on Disguise, Bluff, and Gather Information

checks for a cover identity are doubled (to +8 on Disguise checks,

+4 on Bluff and Gather Information checks, and +2 per 2 extra

ranks on checks made with the cover identitys Craft or Profession

skill). Furthermore, the DC for Spot checks made to penetrate her

disguise increases by 4.

Slippery Mind (Ex): At 4th level, the Zhentarim spy gains the

slippery mind special ability (see the rogue class description on page

50 of the Players Handbook) if she did not already have it.

Deep Cover (Ex): At 5th level, the Zhentarim spy may choose

a number of new cover identities equal to her Intelligence bonus

(minimum one). These may be the same cover identities selected for

the unlikely cover ability, or they may be different ones, or they

may  be  a  mixture  of  both.  Unlike  her  unlikely  cover  identities,

however, the identities she selects for deep cover need not be new.

When the Zhentarim spy is operating within one of her deep

cover identities, her mind is so thoroughly trained and conditioned

to think like the person she pretends to be that any magical scry-

ing or mind reading at a power level short of dei c reveals nothing

about her true nature. Only the thoughts, alignment, and emotions

of the  ctitious persona can be detected.

12/18/03, 12:04:49 PM

Magical power infuses everything on Toril,

from  the  trees  of  the  High  Forest  to

the  sands  of  Anauroch.  Throughout

the history of Faern, this mystical energy has

in uenced the rise and fall of mighty empires,

empowered great deeds of sel ess heroism, and granted the desires

of  some  of  the  darkest  villains  the  cosmos  has  ever  seen.  With

the proper knowledge of the Weave, a character can call down the

wrath of nature, banish demons back to the pits of the Abyss, and

even bring the dead back from the grave.

With  such  powers  at  their  command,  it  is  small  wonder  that

many priests and mages have carved out their own personal king-

doms  across  Faern.  Ranging  from  benevolent  magocracies  such

as Halruaa and Silverymoon to cruel dictatorships such as Thay,

nations with strong ties to magic abound. Adventuring in such a

highly magical region is bound to be more memorable than the av-

erage dungeon crawl or tromp through the woodsthough perhaps

not in a good way.

Yet  for  all  that  magic  is  a  common  part  of  life  in  Faern,

it  remains  a  largely  mysterious  force.  Even  the  most  powerful

archmages can truthfully claim to understand no more than a

fraction  of  the  vast  mysteries  of  magic.  Clerics  can  commune

with  their  deities,  but  what  mortal  can  truly  understand  the

thoughts of a god? Even on the Material Plane of Faern, arcane

mysteries  abound,  from  the  power  of  elven  high  magic  to  the

long-lost arts of the Netherese. No matter how many secrets of

magic are revealed, there will always be dozens more lurking in

the shadows.

Deity-Speci c Spells

To some small extent, domain spells represent what makes clerics

of one deity different from clerics of another. Clerics of Kossuth

can cast burning hands, while clerics of Lolth can cast blacklight.

79

It is hardly a perfect distinguishing factor, however, since clerics of

Gond and Talos also have access to the Fire domain, and no less

than  fty-four deities grant access to the Good domain.

A unique characteristic that distinguishes at least some clerics

from others is the availability of deity-speci c spellsspells that

only certain deities grant. Only Cyric grants his clerics the skull

of  secrets  spell,  for  example,  and  only  Mystras  clerics  can  cast

holy star. A character can achieve this distinction by taking an

initiate feat, such as Initiate of Cyric or Initiate of Mystra, which

is available only to clerics of the speci ed deity. Most such feats

require some minimum cleric level as well. In addition to a general

bene t, an initiate feat adds deity-speci c spells to the clerics spell

list. Some feats also allow the addition of these spells to the spell

lists of other classes. If you have more than one class that quali-

 es for this addition, you must choose only one spell list to which

they will be added. No character can have more than one initiate

feat, since such a feat presumes a deep level of commitment to a

single deity.

Some  of  the  deity-speci c  spells  included  in  the  initiate  feats

previously appeared in Magic of Faern with a deity designator, but

there was no rule prohibiting their use by other clerics. If you use

initiate feats in your game, you should not allow clerics without the

appropriate initiate feat to cast those spells. See the Comprehensive

Spell Lists for the supplement that details each spell.

Most of the deity-specific spells in the following section are

described  later  in  this  chapter.  A  spell  name  followed  by  the

tag  FOR  indicates  a  spell  described  in  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Acid Storm

Evocation [Acid]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. +10 ft./level)

Area: Cylinder (20-ft. radius, 20 ft.

high)

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You cause acid to rain downward. The

acid deals 1d8 points of acid damage per

caster  level  (maximum  15d8)  to  each

creature in the area.

Material Component: A  ask of acid.

Ball Lightning

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./levels)

Effect: One lightning ball/two levels

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create one 3-foot-diameter ball of con-

centrated  electricity  per  two  caster  levels

(maximum  eight  balls).  Each  ball  sheds

light as a candle.

When you create the balls of lightning,

you  mentally  program  them  to  move  as

you  desire,  even  around  corners.  A  ball

can  move  up  to  100  feet  per  round  and

 ies  with  perfect  maneuverability.  Upon

striking  a  creature,  the  ball  stops  and

Ball lightning

human would under the ambient lighting

conditions (counting the light that the ball

itself sheds).

For  example,  you  could  program  one

lightning  ball  to  follow  the  left  wall  of

a corridor and strike the  rst creature it

sees,  another  to  follow  the  right  wall

and  do  the  same,  and  the  remainder  to

follow  5  feet  behind  you  in  a  semicircle.

The   rst  two  lightning  balls  would  turn

corners to follow the walls, even if doing

so  took  them  out  of  your  line  of  sight,

and each would strike the  rst creature it

saw, which would cancel its program and

leave it in its targets square. Programming

the balls is a free action in the round the

spell is cast and a move-equivalent action

in any other round.

A creature struck by a lightning ball

(or one that touches a ball with natural

or  melee  weapons)  takes  2d6  points  of

electricity  damage  (Re ex  saving  throw

for half damage). A creature that comes

into contact with multiple balls of light-

ning  takes  damage  individually  from

each and receives a saving throw for

each. A creature with spell resistance

makes a separate spell resistance check

against  each  lightning  ball;  success

means  that  ball  cannot  harm  the

creature.

Material Component: A handful of

copper and iron pellets.

Battletide

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Bane 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: You and up to one creature/

level, no two of which can be more

than 30 ft. apart

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You steal energy from others. Each target

other  than  you  takes  a  2  penalty  on

saving  throws,  attack  rolls,  and  weapon

damage rolls. As long as at least one enemy

is affected by the spell, you receive the fol-

lowing bene ts.

3You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and

Re ex  saves,  and  a  +1  dodge  bonus  to

AC.  Any  condition  that  causes  you  to

lose  your  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor

Class  (if  any)  also  negates  this  dodge

bonus.

3All of your modes of movement increase

by  30  feet,  to  a  maximum  of  twice

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   99

12/18/03, 4:20:58 PM

your  normal  speed  with  each  form  of

movement.  This  increase  counts  as  an

enhancement bonus.

3When using a full attack action, you may

make one extra attack with any weapon

you  are  holding.  You  make  this  attack

using  your  full  base  attack  bonus,  plus

any  modi ers  appropriate  to  the  situa-

tion. This effect is not cumulative with

similar  effects,  such  as  that  provided

by the haste spell or a weapon with the

speed special ability.

3If you do not make an extra attack, you

may  cast  any  0-level  or  1st-level  spell

you  have  prepared  as  a  free  action,  as

though  you  had  applied  the  Quicken

Spell  feat  to  it.  For  every  two  caster

levels  beyond  9th,  you  may  apply  this

bene t  to  a  spell  one  level  higher  (to

2nd-level  spells  at  11th  level,  3rd-level

spells  at  13th  level,  4th-level  spells  at

15th  level,  and  5th-level  spells  at  17th

level). The bene t cannot be applied to

spells higher than 5th level.

If  all  the  affected  enemies  are  freed

from  the  spell  (by  death,  entering  an

antimagic   eld,  receiving  a  successful

dispel  magic,  or  the  like),  the  spell  ends

immediately.

Black Talon

Necromancy

Level: Initiate of Cyric 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: No; see text

One  of  your  arms  transforms  into  a  re-

tractable,  rubbery  appendage  ending  in

a  taloned  claw.  You  can  attack  with  this

claw  as  if  your  natural  reach  were  5  feet

longer than it is. (Thus, the spell provides

a 10-foot natural reach for most Medium

casters.)  You  gain  a  +1  profane  bonus  on

attack rolls with the black talon, and this

bonus increases by 1 per four caster levels

(to +2 at 5th level, +3 at 9th level, and so

forth). The talon deals 1d6 points of slash-

ing  damage  +1  point  of  negative  energy

damage  per  caster  level  (maximum  +10).

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

A successful Will save reduces the negative

energy damage by half.

You  can  also  use  the  talon  to  make

touch  attacks,  and  the  profane  bonus  on

attack rolls applies to these as well. A suc-

cessful touch attack deals only the negative

energy  damage.  As  with  similar  effects,

the negative energy damage from this spell

heals undead creatures.

Blinding Spittle

Transmutation

Level: Druid 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One missile of spit

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  spit  caustic  saliva  into  your  targets

eyes with a successful ranged touch attack.

A  4  penalty  applies  to  the  attack  roll.

The spittle blinds the target until it can

wash  its  eyes  with  water  or  some  other

rinsing  uid.

This  spell  has  no  effect  on  creatures

without eyes or creatures that dont depend

on eyes for vision.

Blindsight

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 3, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This spell grants the subject the blindsight

ability out to 30 feet. (For details, see page

290 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.)

Bombardment

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Druid 8

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

100

Area: 15-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You cause a rain of rocks to fall from the

sky, burying your opponents. You designate

the  spot  on  which  the  burst  is  centered.

Each  creature  in  the  area  that  fails  a

Re ex  saving  throw  takes  1d8  points  of

damage per caster level (maximum 20d8)

and is buried under rubble (see Avalanches,

page  90  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide).

A  successful  save  halves  the  damage  and

avoids burial. Buried subjects are subject to

suffocation (see page 304 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide) until they climb out from

under the rocks (a full-round action).

Focus:  A  quartz  crystal  embedded  in

rock.

Briartangle

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Nature 4

This spell functions like entangle, except as

follows. The entangling plants are changed

to  tangled  briars  covered  with  sharp

thorns  that  grow  to  a  height  of  6  feet.

Each entangled creature takes 1d8 points

of piercing damage +1 point per two caster

levels  in  the  round  it  becomes  entangled.

In each subsequent round that it attempts

to  break  free  or  move  within  the  briars,

it takes a like amount of damage. An en-

tangled creature attempting to cast a spell

within  the  briars  must  make  a  successful

Concentration  check  (DC  20  +  the  spells

level) or lose the spell.

The  briars  are  thick  and  tall  enough

to  grant  cover  to  creatures  within  or

behind them.

Caligardes Claw

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Invisible claw of force

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   100

12/18/03, 4:21:41 PM

Caligardes  claw  creates  a  Medium  claw

of invisible force at any spot you designate

within  the  spells  range.  You  can  either

send the claw to attack one speci c target

or  order  it  to  guard  an  area.  The  claws

orders  may  be  switched  each  round  as  a

free action, if you so desire.

The claw has Strength 22, Dexterity 18,

AC 16 (+4 Dex, +2 for invisibility), and hit

points equal to one-half your full normal

total. It attacks at your base attack bonus,

applying modi ers for its own statistics as

appropriate (+6 for Str and +2 for invisibil-

ity). It can make multiple attacks per round

with a full attack action if your base attack

bonus is high enough to allow it. Since it

counts  as  an  invisible  attacker,  the  target

loses  its  Dexterity  bonus  (if  any)  to  AC

unless it has uncanny dodge. A Caligardes

claw  deals  1d6+6  points  of  damage  with

each  successful  attack.  The  claw  is  corpo-

real and can be destroyed, which ends the

spell. Since it is invisible, any attacks made

against it have a 50% miss chance.

If  ordered  to  attack  a  single  target,

the  claw  moves  from  its  current  position

toward the designated target at a speed of

90 feet, provided the target is within range

of  the  spell.  It  attacks  on  your  turn  and

continues to attack until it or its target is

destroyed,  or  the  spells  duration  ends,  or

you redirect it to a new target or to guard

duty. While it is assigned to attack a spe-

ci c target, the claw cannot make attacks

of opportunity.

If you order the claw to guard an area,

it  ies at a speed of 90 feet to any 5-foot

square  you  designate  within  the  spells

range  and  waits  there.  While  on  guard

duty, it does not attack on its own, but it

makes attacks of opportunity whenever a

foe performs an action that provokes such

an attack within 5 feet of its position. The

claw functions as though it had the Combat

Re exes  feat  for  this  purpose,  so  it  may

make a total of  ve attacks of opportunity

per  round.  A  claw  in  guard  mode  cannot

take attack actions or full attack actions; it

can only wait for an action that provokes

an attack of opportunity.

Material  Component:  A  small,  dried

claw from an animal.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Your   ngers  sprout  claws.  When  you

cast this spell, your hands become weapons

that  deal  1d8  points  of  damage  each  or

your normal unarmed damage, whichever

is greater. You are considered armed while

this spell is in effect.

Cloud of

Bewilderment

Evocation

Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 10 ft.

Area: 10-ft. cone

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  breathe  out  an  invisible  cone  of

noxious  air.  Each  creature  in  the  area  is

nauseated for 1d6 rounds.

Create

Magic Tattoo

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 day

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

a  similar  Craft  skill.  Inscribing  a  magic

tattoo  requires  a  successful  Craft  check.

The DC varies with the kind of tattoo, as

noted below.

If you are a 3rd- to 6th-level caster, you

can inscribe a tattoo that generates any one

of the following effects (Craft DC 10).

F+2 resistance bonus on one type of saving

throw (Fortitude, Re ex, or Will).

F+1 luck bonus on attack rolls.

F+1 de ection bonus to AC.

At 7th to 12th caster level, you can add the

following tattoos to the list that you can

inscribe (Craft DC 15):

F+2  resistance  bonus  on  all  saving

throws.

F+2 competence bonus on attack rolls.

When your caster level reaches 13th, you

may add the following to the list of tattoos

you can inscribe (Craft DC 20).

FSpell resistance equal to 10 + 1/six caster

levels.

F+2 enhancement bonus to any one abil-

ity score.

F+1 level of spellcasting ability. This effect

increases the subjects effective level, but

not the total number of spells. For ex-

ample, an 11th-level caster who receives

this  tattoo  functions  as  a  12th-level

caster  for  the  purpose  of  determining

level-based spell variables (such as range,

area, effect, and so on), but he does not

receive any extra spells.

A  single  creature  can  have  only  three

magic  tattoos  at  a  time.  Any  attempt  to

apply more than that automatically fails.

A successful erase spell removes a single

magic  tattoo.  A  successful  dispel  magic

spell can remove multiple magic tattoos if

targeted on the creature bearing them (see

the dispel magic spell description, page 223

of the Players Handbook).

Material  Components:  Tattoo  inks  in

appropriate colors costing at least 100 gp.

Focus: Tattoo needles.

This spell creates a single magic tattoo. You

determine the exact type of tattoo, though

the selection is limited by your caster level,

as indicated below. You must possess a mod-

icum of artistic talent to sketch the desired

tattooat least 1 rank of Craft (drawing),

Craft  (painting),  Craft  (calligraphy),  or

Dread Blast

Necromancy

Level: Initiate of Cyric 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

101

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   101

12/19/03, 2:11:45 PM

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Ray

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will half; see text

You  re a black ray of negative energy at a

single target as a ranged touch attack. Any

creature struck by this ray takes 4d8 points

of damage +1 point per caster level (up to

+20)  and  becomes  dazed  for  1  round.  A

successful Will save halves the damage and

negates the dazed effect. The spell has no

effect on constructs or inanimate objects.

Since  undead  are  powered  by  negative

energy,  this  spell  cures  them  of  as  much

damage as it would ordinarily deal.

Elminsters

Effulgent

Epuration

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One magic-absorbing sphere per

caster level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

When you cast this spell, you bring forth

one  oating, silvery sphere per caster level,

each  about  the  size  of  your  head.  These

spheres hover around you to provide pro-

tection from magical effects. As a standard

action, you may shift the spells effect (and

thus all the spheres) to any other creature

within range.

Each  of  these  spheres  can  absorb  and

completely  negate  any  spell  or  spell-like

ability,  regardless  of  level,  that  directly

targets the subject. The spheres do not auto-

matically absorb all spells; the subject may

choose whether or not to let them absorb

any given spell cast upon it. (This option

allows  the  creature  to  bene t  from  help-

ful  spells.)  Area  spells  and  spells  that  do

not actually have a target (such as Bigbys

interposing hand) cannot be absorbed. Once

a sphere has absorbed a spell or spell-like

ability,  it  simply  fades  away.  Only  spells

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

and  spell-like  abilities  of  dei c  power

can  overcome  the  protection  provided  by

Elminsters effulgent epuration.

Eye of Power

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Effect: Magical sensor

This spell functions like the 4th-level spell

arcane eye, except as follows. You may cast

any spell of 7th level or lower that has a

range other than personal through the eye.

Any spell so cast functions as though it had

been cast from the eye of powers location

rather  than  yours.  Casting  any  spell  of

higher than 7th level through the eye not

only  produces  no  effect  (though  the  spell

is still expended), but it destroys the eye of

power and ends the spell.

Unlike an arcane eye, an eye of power is

visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed.

The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 and

77 hit points. It uses your save bonuses for

saving throws.

Favor of Ilmater

Necromancy

Level: Initiate of Ilmater 4, paladin 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One willing creature

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

The target becomes immune to nonlethal

damage,  charm  and  compulsion  effects,

and  attacks  that  function  speci cally  by

causing  pain.  It  is  further  immune  to

effects  that  would  cause  it  to  be  dazed,

exhausted,  fatigued,  nauseated,  sickened,

staggered, or stunned. The target remains

conscious  at  1  to  9  hit  points  and  can

take  a  single  action  each  round  while  in

that state. If any of the above conditions

were in effect on the target at the time of

casting, they are suspended for the spells

duration.  (Thus,  an  unconscious  target

becomes conscious and functional.) When

the spell ends, any effects suspended by the

102

spell that have not expired in the interim

(such as fatigue, which normally requires 8

hours of rest to abate) return. Effects that

expired during the duration of this spell do

not resume when it ends.

In addition to these effects, the target

gains the bene t of the Endurance feat for

the duration of the spell.

Fiendform

Transmutation [Evil]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, M

Duration: 1 min./level

This spell functions like polymorph, except

as indicated. You may take the form of any

 endish creature, demon, or devil that can

be summoned by a summon monster I, II,

III, or IV spell. You can assume only one

form  with  each  use  of  the  spell,  but  you

gain all the assumed forms extraordinary,

spell-like, and supernatural abilities. Your

type  changes  to  outsider,  and  spells  and

effects  that  harm  or  ward  evil  outsiders

affect  you.  Any  effect  that  would  banish

you  to  your  home  plane  ends  this  spell

and  leaves  you  staggered  for  1  round

per caster level but does not send you to

another plane.

Material Component: A bone from any

 endish  creature,  half- endish  creature,

demon, or devil.

Fireward

Transmutation

Level: Druid 5, initiate of nature 5

Area: One 20-ft. cube/level (S)

Duration: 1 hour/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  functions  like  quench,  except

as  indicated  above.  In  addition,  it  has

the  following  effects.  While   reward

remains in effect, no magical  re effect

can  function  inside  its  area.  This  effect

is  similar  to  that  of  an  antimagic  eld,

but  only   re  spells  are  suppressed.  Any

nonmagical  re created inside or brought

into the spells area is immediately extin-

guished as well.

Necromancy

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action.

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This ghoulish spell affects the targets skel-

eton, causing excruciating pain by twisting

and  snapping  bones.  The  target  is  auto-

matically  stunned  for  1  round  (no  saving

throw).  In  the  following  round,  it  must

make a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points

of bludgeoning damage per caster level and

be nauseated by the pain for 1d4+2 rounds.

Material Component: A bone, which is

snapped during the casting of the spell.

Forceward

Abjuration

Level: Initiate of Helm 3, paladin 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: 10 ft.

Targets: You and any allies within a 10-

ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: No; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  an  unmoving,  transparent

sphere of force centered on you. The inte-

rior  of  the  sphere  and  everything  within

5 feet of its edge is illuminated with light

equivalent to that of a candle.

You  and  your  allies  may  enter  the

sphere at will. Any other creature that tries

to  enter  must  make  a  Will  saving  throw

to  succeed.  Any  creature  may  leave  the

sphere  freely,  but  a  creature  that  has  left

must make a successful Will save to enter

again, even if it is you or one of your allies.

Creatures within the area of the sphere at

the time of casting are not forced out.

While in the area of the forceward, you

and your allies each gain a +2 sacred bonus

on saving throws against effects created by

evil  creatures.  Creatures  within  the  area

that are not your allies gain no bene t.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

The forceward does not prevent spells or

objects from entering the area, so it is pos-

sible for two creatures on opposite sides of

the spheres edge to  ght without penalties.

A creature using unarmed attacks or natural

weapons in this manner, however, must still

make a Will save each round, or its attacks

cannot pass the forcewards boundary.

Gedlees

Electric Loop

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One creature/three caster levels,

each of which must be adjacent to

another target

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You create one small stroke of lightning that

targets one creature per three caster levels

you  possess  (maximum  four  creatures).

Each target must be in a square adjacent to

another  target.  The  spell  deals  1d6  points

of  electricity  damage  per  two  caster  levels

(maximum 5d6) to each target. A creature

that fails its Re ex save must make a suc-

cessful Will save or be stunned for 1 round.

Material Component: A loop of copper

wire and a magnet.

Glory of the Martyr

Abjuration [Good]

Level: Initiate of Ilmater 4

Components: V, S, F, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One creature/level

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Like shield other, this spell wards the sub-

jects, creating a mystic connection between

them and you that transfers some of their

wounds  to  you.  Each  subject  gains  a  +1

de ection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance

bonus  on  all  saving  throws.  In  addition,

103

each subject takes only one-half the normal

hit point damage from any attack, and you

take  the  remainder.  Forms  of  harm  that

do  not  involve  hit  points,  such  as  charm

effects, ability damage, level draining, and

disintegration, are not affected. If a subjects

hit points are reduced because of a lowered

Constitution score, that reduction is not split

with you because it is not hit point damage.

When the spell ends, any subsequent damage

is  no  longer  divided  between  you  and  the

subjects,  but  the  damage  you  took  for  the

subjects is not reassigned to them.

If you die while glory of the martyr is

in effect, the spell ends in a burst of posi-

tive energy that restores 1d8 hit points to

each subject.

If a subject dies or moves out of range

of  the  spell,  that  subjects  connection  to

you  is  severed,  but  the  spell  remains  in

force with respect to other subjects. If your

connection with all subjects is severed, the

spell ends.

Focus: A platinum ring worth at least

50  gp  worn  by  you  and  each  subject  of

the spell.

You  surround  your  hand  with  winking

motes  of  light  that  resemble  a  cluster  of

constantly renewed sparks. The lights can

be  any  color  you  choose,  but  the  color

cannot  be  changed  once  the  spell  is  cast.

Hand re  provides  illumination  equal  to

that of a candle, but it does not give off

heat and cannot ignite objects.

Hand re  can  be  used  as  a  melee

touch  attack  up  to  once  per  two  caster

levels. Against a living creature, this

attack  deals  1d8  points  of  damage

+1  point  per  caster  level  (maximum

+5). Against undead, hand re deals

2d6 points of damage +1 point per

caster  level  (maximum  +5).  It  has

no effect on targets that are neither

living nor undead (such as constructs).

Level: Initiate of Mystra 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: Protective star of energy

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

You create a glowing mote of energy that

stays  near  your  shoulder,  providing  light

equal to that of a candle. This star has the

following three functions, and you can des-

ignate which function to activate as a free

action on your turn.

Spell Turning: The holy star can turn a

total of four to seven (1d4+3) spell levels

as  the  spell  turning  spell.  Any

turning  potential  depleted

through  this  use  remains  so

for  the  duration  of  the  spell;

Handfire

the holy star does not return to full capac-

ity every time you choose this function. If

its entire spell turning capacity is expended,

this  function  no  longer  works,  but  the

others do.

Protection: The holy star gives you a +10

circumstance bonus to AC without affect-

ing your actions.

Fire Bolt: The holy star lashes out with

a beam of energy as a ranged touch attack

against a creature up to 90 feet away. This

attack uses your attack bonus and deals  re

damage equal to 1d6 points per two caster

levels (maximum 10d6).

Howling Chain

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature within range

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell summons a shimmering, blood-

red chain of pure force that winds around

the  target,  hampering  its  movement  and

attacking  it.  The  spell  is  named  for  the

unearthly  howl  the  chain  emits  while

constricting its victim. The noise is so loud

that each creature within 100 feet of the

chain takes a 2 penalty on Listen checks.

The chain does not hold its victim fast, nor

does it prevent the target from acting, but

the target takes a 2 penalty on all attacks,

saves,  and  skill  checks  and  must  make  a

Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level)

to cast any spell with somatic components.

Each  round,  the  chain  attacks  its  target

twice (+13/+8 melee), dealing 3d4 points of

bludgeoning damage per hit. Additionally,

if the target of the howling chains attacks

attempts to cast a spell during a round in

which both of its attacks hit, the Concen-

tration DC increases by 5.

When  the  howling  chain  spell  is   rst

cast,  the  target  may  make  a  Re ex

save  to  evade  its  constricting  coils.

A  successful  save  means  that  the

chain manifests somewhere within 5

feet of the target. (Use the rules for missing

with a thrown weapon on page 158 of the

Players Handbook to determine where the

chain actually appears.) Assuming that the

target does not move away, the chain once

again  attempts  to  ensnare  its  designated

target  on  your  next  action,  requiring  an-

other Re ex save. If the designated target

is no longer adjacent to the chain, it moves

toward its quarry each round at a speed of

20 feet, attacking as soon as possible.

The  howling  chain  is  a  Medium  object

with AC 12 and 33 hit points, and it uses

your save bonuses for saving throws. How-

ever,  all  damage  dealt  to  the  chain  also

applies to the target of the howling chain

spell. The target may make a Fortitude save

This  spell  transforms  a  quantity  of

ice  into  a  long,  deadly  lance,  which  is

then  magically  propelled  at  a  target

you designate. You must succeed on a

ranged attack to strike a target. A +4

bonus applies to your attack roll. If you

hit, the icelance deals 5d6 points of

damage to the target. Half of this

damage  is  piercing  damage;  the

rest  is  cold  damage.  In  addition,

the  target  must  make  a  Fortitude

save  or  be  stunned  for  1d4  rounds.

Regardless of the result of the attack, the

icelance shatters upon its  rst use.

Material  Component:  At  least  10

pounds  of  ice  or  snow.  Most  mages  cast

this  spell  in  an  area  with  natural  ice  or

snow, but in a pinch the ice left over from

an ice storm spell will suf ce.

Inferno

Transmutation [Fire]

Level: Druid 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You cause one creature to burst into  ames.

The target of the inferno takes 6d6 points

of   re  damage,  and  its  clothing,  items,

hair, and  esh burn with ferocity. In each

round thereafter, the  re deals 1d6 fewer

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

points  of  damage  (minimum  1d6)  until

the  spell  ends  or  the  subject  manages  to

extinguish the  ames. Thus, the  re deals

5d6 points of damage in the second round,

4d6 points in the third round, and so forth.

Flammable,  nonmagical  items  carried  by

the target automatically fail their saves to

resist this damage.

After the  rst round, the target can at-

tempt a DC 15 Re ex save as a full-round

action  to  extinguish  the   ames  before

t a k i n g  additional  damage.  Rolling  on

the  ground  allows  the  target

a +2 bonus on this save.

Inferno

Leaping  into  a  lake  or  magically  extin-

guishing  the   ames  automatically  ends

the effect.

Material Component: A gob of beeswax.

Lawful Sword

Evocation

Level: Paladin 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Weapon touched

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

105

This  spell  works  like  holy  sword,  except

as  follows.  The  weapon  functions  as  a  +5

axiomatic weapon (+5 enhancement bonus

on attack and damage rolls, lawful-aligned,

deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against

chaotic opponents). It emits a magic circle

against chaos effect (as the spell).

Lightning Ring

Evocation [Electricity]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Personal; see text

Effect: Two lightning bolts/round or eight

lightning bolts all at once

Duration: 1 round/two levels or

instantaneous; see text

Saving Throw: Re ex half; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell conjures a crackling ring of

bright white lightning that hovers around

you at chest height. The ring moves with

you  and  does  not  interfere  with  your

spellcasting  or  attacks,  or  with  others

attacking you. As long as the lightning

ring is in effect, you gain resistance to

electricity 20. Each round on your

action,  the  lightning  ring  emits

two  lightning  bolts,  exactly  as  the

lightning bolt spell (caster level 5th), in

any directions you choose. Each bolt may

be aimed separately. A creature struck by

one  of  these  bolts  may  make  a  Re ex

save for half damage. The DC for this

save  is  calculated  for  an  8th-level

spell, even though the bolts mimic

a 3rd-level spell.

Alternately,  you  may  choose  to  release

the lightning rings power all at once. When

you complete the casting of the spell, you

unleash eight lightning bolts that travel in

all directions. (See the diagram for missing

with thrown weapons on page 158 of the

Players  Handbook  for  an  illustration  of

the directions these bolts travel.) This use

of the lightning ring spell has an instanta-

neous duration. You must choose whether

to store the power of the lightning ring or

release it all at once when you cast it.

Material Components: A small glass ring

and a bit of fur from any animal.

Lively Step

Transmutation

Level: Bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Area: 30-ft.-radius emanation centered

on you

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This  spell,  whose  verbal  component  is  a

lively marching song, was commonly used

by  the  elves  of  Myth  Drannor  to  speed

their scouting parties home. Once the spell

is cast, as long as you perform only move

actions, you and all allies within 30 feet of

you move at a speed 10 feet greater than

normal.  In  addition,  you  and  your  allies

may  hustle  during  overland  movement

for  1  extra  hour  per  day  per  caster  level

(see  page  164  of  the  Players  Handbook).

Even  with  this  spell,  however,  you  still

suffer  the  ill  effects  of  forced  marching

if  you  attempt  to  walk  for  more  than  8

hours in a day.

Focus: A small drum.

Mace of Odo

Evocation [Force]

Level: Initiate of Helm 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: Mace of force

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  glowing  mace  of  force  that

appears  in  your  hand.  You  must  make  a

melee touch attack to strike a target with

the mace. If it hits, the mace of Odo deals

1d6 points of force damage per caster level

(maximum 10d6). An undead target takes

an additional +1 point of damage per caster

level (maximum +10). Any creature struck

by the mace must make a Fortitude save or

be paralyzed for 1 round. You may attack

once  with  the  mace  of  Odo  on  the  same

round that you summoned it.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

The mace occupies your hand but does

not disappear if you cast another spell. If

you are targeted with a spell while holding

the mace, you may choose to have the mace

absorb that spell.

When the mace strikes a creature, or is

used to absorb a spell, or is removed from

your grasp for any reason, it vanishes. The

point in space where it vanished glows as

though under the effect of a light spell for

the remainder of the duration.

Manyjaws

Evocation [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: One pair of disembodied,  ying

jaws per caster level (maximum ten

pairs)

Duration: 3 rounds

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

When  you  cast  this  spell,  you  summon

several pairs of mystical, disembodied jaws

that  y about and attack your foes. These

pairs of jaws may be commanded to attack

separate targets, or multiple pairs may be

sent to attack a single foe. The jaws origi-

nate at your location and  y out to attack

their targets, moving at a  y speed of 40

feet with perfect maneuverability. You may

redirect as many of the jaws as you desire

as a standard action.

Each round on your action, each pair of

jaws automatically hits its target and deals

1d4 points of damage, or half that amount

with  a  successful  Re ex  save.  A  creature

targeted  by  multiple  pairs  of  jaws  in  a

single round makes only one saving throw,

with success halving the total damage.

Material Component: A pair of teeth.

Mold Touch

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Initiate of Nature 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Effect: Patch of brown mold

Duration: Instantaneous

106

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  cause  a  5-foot-diameter  patch  of

brown  mold  to  appear,  centered  on  the

point you touch. You can cause it to appear

on a living target by making a successful

melee touch attack against that creature.

As  described  on  page  76  of  the  Dun-

geon Masters Guide, every living creature

within  5  feet  of  the  brown  mold  takes

3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage each

round.  Fire  brought  within  5  feet  of  the

patch  instantly  doubles  its  size,  and  cold

damage instantly destroys it.

Moonweb

Abjuration

Level: Initiate of Selne 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Effect: 10-ft.-high barrier of force in a

5-ft.-diameter circle or 10-ft.-long

line

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  an  immobile  barrier  of  force

that glows as though with moonlight. You

can  form  the  barrier  either  as  a  circular

shield 5 feet in diameter and 10 feet high

around a willing creature, or as a  at, 10-

foot-square plane placed either horizontally

(across  a  doorway,  for  example)  or  verti-

cally (covering a pit or trap door), as long

as it is anchored along at least one edge.

The  barrier  has  an  inside  and  an  out-

side. From the inside, it is transparent and

passable;  any  creature  can  move  through

it. From the outside, it is opaque and virtu-

ally impassableno creature or attack can

pass through from this direction. Creatures

inside  the  moonweb  have  cover  and  total

concealment against attacks that originate

on the outside.

Mystic Lash

Evocation [Electricity, Evil]

Level: Initiate of Bane 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   106

12/19/03, 2:15:19 PM

Range: 15 ft.

Effect: Electric whip

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  long  whip  of  ghostly  red

energy  that  emanates  from  your  hand

and  never  harms  you.  You  can  wield  this

weapon as if it were an actual whip and you

were  pro cient  with  it.  You  must  succeed

on a ranged touch attack with the mystic

lash to strike a target. Any creature struck

by it takes 1d6 points of electricity damage

per  three  caster  levels  (maximum  4d6)

and must succeed on a Fortitude save or be

stunned for 1 round. You gain a bonus on

damage rolls equal to your Charisma modi-

 er, but your Strength modi er does not

apply, since the lash is immaterial.

If you release the lash from your hand

after it hits a target, it continues to attack

that target automatically, leaving your hand

free. If the lashs target falls unconscious,

dies, or is destroyed, the lash returns to you

on its next action. If you do not grasp it on

the round it returns, it dissipates; otherwise,

you  can  use  the  lash  on  another  creature

and begin the cycle again.

As with a normal whip, you can use the

mystic lash to make trip or disarm attacks,

but only if you are actually wielding it. It

cannot make such attacks on its own.

Mystras Miasma

Abjuration

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 5 ft./level)

Area: 30-ft.-radius emanation, +5 ft./level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will partial; see text

Spell Resistance: No

This  potent  spell  conjures  forth  a  thick,

billowing  cloud  of  mist  that  functions

as  a  solid  fog  spell.  In  addition,  the  mist

creates a sinkhole in the Weave, greatly

reducing the power of spellcasters in that

spot.  Each  character  within  the  area  of

Mystras  miasma  takes  a  4  penalty  on

caster level checks when attempting to cast

spells.  A  successful  Will  save  made  upon

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

 rst  entering  the  miasma  negates  this

effect.  Creatures  who  access  the  Shadow

Weave to cast their spells are immune to

the  caster  level  check  penalty  unless  you

also call upon the Shadow Weave. In that

case, the spell is called Shars miasma and

Weave users are immune to the caster level

check penalty.

Material  Component:  A  small  piece  of

quilted  cloth,  which  must  be  soaked  in

water while the spell is cast.

Natures Balance

Transmutation

Level: Druid 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

(harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You lend some of your ability score points

to your target.

You take a 4 penalty to any single abil-

ity  score  of  your  choice,  and  your  target

gains an equivalent enhancement bonus to

the  same  ability  score.  You  get  no  saving

throw  to  avoid  the  loss,  but  your  target

may attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the

gain, if desired.

If  you  cast  this  spell  a  second  time

within  1  hour,  you  take  2d10  points  of

damage in addition to the normal effect.

Nybors Gentle

Reminder

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  has  long  been  popular  with

slave overseers and those wishing to make

their servants work a little faster. The Red

107

Wizards  now  employ  it  primarily  as  a

combat spell.

When the spell is cast, the subject suf-

fers  a  sharp,  agonizing  pain  that  leaves

it  dazed  for  1  round.  In  each  subsequent

round  for  the  duration  of  the  spell,  the

subject  takes  a  2  penalty  on  attacks,

saving  throws,  and  checks.  Furthermore,

a spellcaster targeted by Nybors gentle re-

minder is distracted by the pain and must

make a successful Concentration check to

cast  spells  while  under  its  effect  (see  the

Concentration skill description, page 69 of

the Players Handbook).

Focus: A stick at least 1 foot long.

Nybors Mild

Admonishment

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-

Affecting]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 3

Duration: 1 round/level

This  spell  functions  like  Nybors  gentle

reminder, except that the subject is dazed

for 1d4 rounds.

Nybors

Stern Reproof

Enchantment  (Compulsion)  [Mind-Af-

fecting]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: See text

This spell functions like Nybors gentle re-

minder, except that the target must make

a successful Fortitude save or die instantly.

A  creature  that  survives  this  effect  must

immediately  make  a  Will  save  to  avoid

further  effects.  Failure  leaves  the  subject

dazed for 1d4 rounds.

Nchasers

Glowing Orb

Evocation [Light]

Level: Cleric 4, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Effect: Magical, controllable light source

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   107

12/19/03, 2:15:53 PM

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  places  a  magical  light  source

inside  a  glass  sphere  roughly  the  size  of

a  human   st.  You  may  control  the  light

level generated by a Nchasers glowing orb

by mental command, provided that the orb

is  within  30  feet  of  you.  The  light  level

ranges from no light at all to illumination

within a 60-foot radius. There is no limit

to  the  number  of  Nchasers  glowing  orbs

you may possess, and you may control their

light levels independently or in concert.

If  a  Nchasers  glowing  orb  is  smashed,

the magic is lost. If you die, however, the

orbs retain their enchantment. Any cleric,

sorcerer, or wizard capable of casting 4th-

level  spells  may  gain  control  of  a  dead

characters orbs simply by touching them.

Focus: The glass sphere into which the

light  is  placed.  An  orb  usable  for  this

purpose  has  a  hardness  of  0  and  2  hit

points each.

Obedient

Avalanche

Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]

Level: Cold 9

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: 20-ft.-radius avalanche of snow,

centered anywhere within range;

see text

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half or Re ex

negates; see text

Spell Resistance: No

You summon an avalanche of snow out of a

rift in midair, burying your foes and send-

ing them to a frosty death.

The effect of an obedient avalanche on

a creature depends on where it is in relation

to the spells point of origin, as follows.

Within  20  feet  of  the  Point  of  Origin:

Each creature in this area takes 1d8 points

of damage per two caster levels (maximum

10d8), plus an additional 1d6 points of cold

damage  per  two  caster  levels.  A  creature

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

that fails its save is also buried (as described

on page 90 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

All squares within 20 feet of the point of

origin are covered in heavy snow (see page

94 of the Dungeon Masters Guide), which

persists as long as ordinary snow would.

Between 20 feet and 40 feet of the Point

of  Origin:  A  creature  in  this  area  takes

half  as  much  damage  from  the  impact

of the avalanche as one nearer the point

of  origin  takes  (Re ex  save  negates).  On

a failed save, the snow has the additional

effect of a bull rush, with a +13 bonus (+5

for an effective Strength of 20 and +8 for

an effective size of Huge) on the requisite

check.  With  a  successful  bull  rush,  it

pushes  creatures  away  from  the  point  of

origin of the spell. All squares in the ring

20 feet to 40 feet from the center point

are covered in snow, which persists as long

as ordinary snow would.

Terrain and Structures: The avalanche

uproots  small  trees  and  other  vegetation

automatically, and it leaves a trail of light

rubble (as described on page 91 of the Dun-

geon  Masters  Guide)  even  after  the  snow

has melted. A structure hit by an obedient

avalanche takes 1d610 points of damage.

An obedient avalanche extinguishes all

 ames it touches.

Pact of Martyrdom

Necromancy [Good]

Level: Initiate of Ilmater 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One willing creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  exchange  hit  point  totals  with  a

target  that  has  fewer  hit  points  than

you  do.  If  the  target  was  unconscious

and  dying,  you  become  unconscious  and

dying.  If  the  target  was  unconscious  but

stabilized,  you  become  unconscious  but

stabilized. The spell transfers only actual

hit points, not temporary hit points. Pact

of  martyrdom  does  not  function  if  you

have  fewer  hit  points  than  the  target

when you cast the spell.

108

Possess Animal

Necromancy

Level: Initiate of Malar 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One animal

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You project your spirit into the body of an

animal, forcing it to behave as you direct.

The target must be a normal animal (not

a magical beast, vermin, or other monster

type), and your caster level must exceed its

Hit Dice. The animals soul remains in its

body but has no control over it while your

spirit is there. Your own body lies comatose

for the duration of the spell.

While  in  the  animals  body,  you  keep

your  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  Charisma,

level, classes, base attack bonus, base save

bonuses,  alignment,  and  mental  abilities.

You  can  cast  spells  while  you  possess  the

animal only if you have the Natural Spell

feat or an equivalent ability, and you cant

activate the bodys extraordinary or super-

natural abilities. Furthermore, for every 2

points of damage taken by the animal body

while you are possessing it, you take 1 point

of  damage.  If  the  animal  body  is  killed

while you are possessing it, you must make

a DC 10 Fortitude save or die as well.

If  your  body  is  destroyed  while  your

spirit is in the animals body, you die at the

end of the spells duration.

Material Component: A bowl of incense

and  a  morsel  of  food  appealing  to  the

target animal.

This  spell  conjures  1d4  glowing  motes  of

electricity,  which  gather  and  spin  around

you  in  the  manner  of  a  faerie   re  spell.

You  may  immediately  direct  any  number

of the motes to  y off and attack targets

within  the  spells  range.  Multiple  motes

may  be   red  at  the  same  target,  or  each

may be sent against a separate target. You

must succeed on a ranged touch attack with

a  mote  to  strike  a  target.  Any  creature

struck by a mote takes electricity damage

according to the following table.

If  you  do  not  immediately   re  all  the

motes created by the spell, you may choose

to  re as many of the remaining ones as

you  wish  as  a  standard  action  during  the

next round. If a round passes in which you

do  not   re  one  of  your  motes,  the  spell

ends and all remaining motes vanish.

Evocation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Magical eye

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: Yes

A  target  struck  by  a  ray  suffers  the

effect  of  one  beam  of  a  prismatic  spray

spell  (roll  1d8  to  determine  the  effect,

rerolling  any  result  of  8),  except  that

the  save  DC  (if  applicable)  is  19.  After  a

particular color ray has been used, it is no

longer available to the eye. Once all seven

rays have been  red, the eye remains until

the  spells  duration  expires.  You  can  still

move it, but it can  re no more rays.

The  eye  is  a  Fine  object  with  AC  18

(+8 size) and 9 hit points. It uses your save

bonuses for saving throws.

Focus:  A  polished,  rainbow-hued  aba-

lone shell.

You  create  a  visible  orb  that  can  produce

ray effects duplicating the beams of a pris-

matic spray spell. You can move the eye up

to your speed as a move-equivalent action,

but it cannot go beyond the spells range.

Starting in the round the eye appears,

you can command it to  re a ray (50-foot

range) as a free action once per round. You

must succeed on a ranged touch attack with

a ray to strike a target, but each ray uses a

 at +6 bonus on attack rolls instead of your

ranged attack bonus.

You  cause  the  target  to  glow  with  a  soft,

faint,  rosy  radiance  equal  to  candlelight.

This glow grants the subject a sacred bonus

equal to +1 per caster level (maximum +10)

on saving throws against effects that work

by  causing  pain  (such  as  Nybors  gentle

Target: One natural or magical hazard;

see text

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

From  your   ngertips  springs  a  thin  line

of bright red light that can negate any of

several magical or mundane hazards. Each

version of this spell can target one of the

hazards described below and correct it in

the  manner  described.  Unless  speci cally

stated otherwise, this spell affects magical

and mundane hazards of the indicated type

equally. For example, a ruby ray of rever-

sal can eliminate the webs of a monstrous

spider or the effect of a web spell.

FAny trap targeted by the ray is sprung.

This  version  of  the  spell  may  have

adverse  effects  on  creatures  standing

within a traps area. You must be aware

of  a  trap  to  cast  ruby  ray  of  reversal

on it.

FThe spell unties knots and causes chains,

manacles,  and  similar  restraining  de-

vices to fall away. Entangle and similar

magical effects are dispelled. Doors (or

chests, drawers, cabinets, and so on) that

are locked, barred, or under the effect of

an arcane lock spell are opened.

FA hole with a radius of up to 1 foot is

created in a wall of force, forcecage, or

similar spell or effect. This function of

the  spell  does  not  destroy  the  targeted

effect,  but  creatures  trapped  by  it  may

be able to wriggle free.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

FA  creature  that  has  been  polymorphed,

turned  to  stone,  or  otherwise  trans-

formed from its natural state is returned

to its natural form.

FA  magic jar  spell  is  dispelled  if  a  ruby

ray of reversal targets the crystal hold-

ing the casters soul.

FWebs,  slime,  grease,  and  other  substances

that would hamper movement are destroyed

in an area with a radius of up to 20 feet.

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Re ex negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

Sometimes  called  trollkiller,  this  spell

causes  a  single  creature  to  burst  into

 ames,  taking  2d6  points  of   re  damage

immediately  upon  a  failed  saving  throw.

Each  round  thereafter,  throughout  the

spells  duration,  the  target  takes  another

2d6  points  of   re  damage.  In  any  round

when  the  target  takes  a  move  action  to

douse  the   ames,  it  can  attempt  a  new

Re ex save. Success on any save after the

 rst round causes the  ames to die out and

ends the spell.

In  addition  to  the  above  effects,  the

target  shoots  off  gouts  of   ame  every

round  that  it  remains  on   re.  Any  crea-

ture within 10 feet of the target takes 1d4

points of  re damage per round. A success-

ful Re ex save negates this damage.

Material Component: A pinch of saltpe-

ter, a small piece of phosphorus, and a scrap

of lace cloth or a spiderweb.

Simbuls

Spell Matrix

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Effect: Matrix that holds one of your

spells

Duration: 10 min./level (D)

You prepare a magical matrix that allows

you to store one of your spells and use it

later as a free action.

In  the  round  after  you  cast  Simbuls

spell matrix, you may cast one spell of up

to 3rd level to be stored in it. The matrix

closes  after  1  round,  whether  or  not  you

have stored a spell in it. Only a spell that

can  be  altered  by  the  Quicken  Spell  feat

can be placed in the matrix, and any spell

stored there is treated as a prepared spell.

Casting  Simbuls  spell  matrix  deals  1d6

points of damage to you, and this damage

cannot be healed by any means while the

matrix exists.

While the matrix is active, you can cast

the spell stored in it as a free action. Once

cast from the matrix, the spell is gone.

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   110

12/19/03, 2:17:58 PM

A  dispel  magic  spell  that  successfully

dispels  the  matrix  also  dispels  the  spell

held inside it. If you are affected by an an-

timagic  eld, the duration of the matrix is

interrupted, but the spell does not activate.

The matrix becomes active again when you

emerge from the antimagic  eld. If you die

while the spell is still held in the matrix,

both  the  spell  and  the  matrix  dissipate

harmlessly.

Focus: A piece of amber with a mini-

mum value of 500 gp.

Simbuls

Spell Sequencer

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 7

Effect: Matrix that holds two of your

spells

This  spell  functions  like  Simbuls  spell

matrix,  except  that  you  can  store  up  to

two spells of up to 3rd level, and you take

2d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon

casting.  The  matrix  closes  after  2  rounds

and  no  more  spells  can  be  added,  even  if

it is not full.

In addition, you may decide to link the

two spells stored in the matrix into a spell

sequence if both are 2nd level or lower. You

may  then  discharge  the  two  linked  spells

as a single free action, just as if you were

casting the lone spell from a Simbuls spell

matrix.

A  dispel  magic  spell  that  successfully

dispels  the  matrix  also  dispels  all  the

spells  held  inside  it.  If  you  are  affected

by an antimagic  eld, the duration of the

matrix is interrupted, but the spells do not

activate. The matrix becomes active again

when you emerge from the antimagic  eld.

If you die, all spells in the matrix dissipate

harmlessly.

Focus:  A  sapphire  with  a  minimum

value of 1,000 gp.

Simbuls

Spell Trigger

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 9

Effect: Matrix that holds three of your

spells

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

This  spell  functions  like  Simbuls  spell

matrix,  except  that  you  can  store  up  to

three spells of up to 3rd level, and you take

3d6 points of damage instead of 1d6 upon

casting.  The  matrix  closes  after  3  rounds

and  no  more  spells  can  be  added,  even  if

it is not full.

In addition, you may designate one spell

or  one  spell  sequence  held  in  the  matrix

to come into effect under a condition you

dictate when casting Simbuls spell trigger.

This  function  works  much  like  a  contin-

gency spell. The spell (or sequence of spells)

to be activated by the triggering condition

must  be  of  a  type  that  affect  your  own

person, such as levitate or feather fall. The

conditions required to bring the desired spell

or spells into effect must be clear, although

they can be general. In all cases, Simbuls

spell trigger immediately brings into effect

the  designated  spell  or  sequence  of  spells,

which  is  cast  instantaneously  when  the

designated circumstances occur. You cannot

choose to have the spell or spells not acti-

vate when the triggering event occurs.

Focus:  A  diamond  with  a  minimum

value of 1,500 gp.

Skull of Secrets

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Initiate of Cyric 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Intangible skull

Duration: Permanent until discharged

Saving Throw: None; see text

Spell Resistance: No

You create an intangible image of a  oating

skull that trails black  ames. The skull and

its  ames are illusory, so they neither deal

damage nor take damage from attacks. The

skull has a  y speed of 40 feet (perfect), but

it cannot move more than 20 feet from its

point of origin. It simply  oats about aim-

lessly but threateningly within its available

space until the spell is discharged.

Upon  casting  this  spell,  you  set  two

triggering  conditions  for  the  skull.  The

 rst  activates  a  message  that  the  skull

delivers  as  if  it  were  a  magic mouth.  The

second  causes  the  skull  to  spit  a  line  of

 ame  10  feet  long  that  deals  1d8  points

111

of  re damage per two caster levels (maxi-

mum 5d8) at the creature that triggered it.

A target can attempt a Re ex saving throw

for half damage. Anyone failing this save

must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw

or be dazed for 1 round.

The  triggering  conditions  for  the  two

effects can be different, or they can be the

same. In the latter case, the skull would spit

 ame  and  speak  its  message  at  the  same

time.  Once  the  triggering  conditions  for

both effects have been met, the skull dis-

appears. The skull can produce each effect

only  once,  so  if  it  has  already  spoken  its

message, it does not speak it again even if

the message trigger occurs a second time.

Skull Eyes

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Cyric 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/three levels

Saving Throw: None; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You gain a gaze attack out to close range

(25  ft.  +  5  ft./2  levels)  that  lasts  for  the

duration of the spell. Each creature within

range that can see you must attempt a Will

saving throw every round at the beginning

of its turn to avoid the effect. In addition,

you can actively gaze as an attack action by

choosing a target within range.

Depending  on  the  foes  Hit  Dice,  the

gaze attack may have either of two effects,

as follows.

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   111

12/19/03, 2:18:27 PM

Range: Touch

Target: One humanoid skull

Duration: 1 hour/level or until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The  skull  affected  by  a  skull  watch  spell

 oats gently 5 feet off the ground, facing

a direction you choose. It monitors an area

20 feet wide by 90 feet long, though walls

and  other  solid  barriers  can  curtail  this

area. If any living creature enters the area

guarded  by  the  skull,  it  emits  a  piercing

shriek  that  can  be  heard  up  to  a  quarter

of a mile away and falls to the ground, its

magic  expended.  Every  creature  within

60 feet of the skull when it shrieks must

make a Fortitude save or be deafened for

1d6 rounds. Whether or not you can hear

this  audible  alarm,  you  instantly  become

aware when one of your skull watch spells

has been triggered, provided you are on the

same plane as it is.

The skull can be moved from its origi-

nal  position  by  anyone  who  can  get  to  it

without  entering  its  monitored  area.  The

skull  has  an  AC  of  12,  a  hardness  of  1,

and  1  hit  point  per  caster  level.  You  are

not  magically  made  aware  of  the  skulls

destruction if it has not been triggered.

Skull  watch  can  be  made  permanent

with  the  permanency  spell.  A  permanent

skull  watch  resets  1d4  rounds  after  it  is

triggered.

Focus: The humanoid skull upon which

skull watch is cast.

Spectral Stag

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Initiate of Malar 2

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 0 ft.

Effect: One quasi-real staglike creature

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: No

You conjure a quasi-real, staglike creature

that you can direct to either attack a target

or simply carry you on its back. When you

cast the spell, you decide whether you want

the  stag  to  appear  next  to  you  or  form

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

underneath  you  so  that  you  may  ride  it

immediately.

The stag has a speed of 60 feet and can

act  as  soon  as  it  appears,  moving  as  you

direct. Controlling the stag is a free action.

It can move through the air as if it were on

 rm land, as a phantom steed spell (caster

level  12th).  It  can  bear  its  riders  weight

plus up to 10 pounds of additional weight

per caster level.

The  stag  is  a  Large  creature  with  an

Armor  Class  of  18  (1  size,  +4  natural

armor,  +5  Dex)  and  7  hit  points  +1  hit

point per caster level. If it loses all its hit

points, the spectral stag disappears.

If  directed  to  attack  a  creature,  the

stag charges its target and initiates a bull

rush. It has an effective Strength of 18 for

this purpose. The stag cannot be attacked

or damaged, but if you are riding it when

it attempts a bull rush, the defender may

use her attack of opportunity against you

instead of the stag. If the bull rush fails,

the  stag  (and  you,  if  you  are  riding  it)

moves 5 feet straight back to where it was

before it moved into the targets space. If

the bull rush succeeds, the stag moves the

defender  the  maximum  distance  possible.

The defender must also make a Fortitude

saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.

When the spell ends, the stag vanishes.

If you were riding it at the time, you land

safely on the ground.

Spell Enhancer

Transmutation

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round

This spell enhances the next spell you

cast,  making  it  more  dif cult  for  targets

to resist. After you cast this spell, you can

cast another in the same round (as if it had

been quickened) at +2 caster level.

Spellmantle

Abjuration

Level: Initiate of Mystra 6

Components: V, S

112

Casting Time: 1 full round

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 min./level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You create a magical aura around the sub-

ject that protects it against certain spells.

Upon casting, you must designate one spell

of 4th level or lower per four caster levels

you possess. These choices cannot be spells

delivered by touch attacks.

When  the  subject  of  this  spell  is  the

target of or within the area of one of the

designated  spells,  the  spellmantle  absorbs

the  incoming  spells  energy  completely.

The target can then direct this energy to

one of the following two purposes.

Healing:  The  subject  immediately

receives  a  cure  wounds  spell  of  the  same

level  as  the  spell  that  was  absorbed.  The

cure  spell  functions  as  if  you  had  cast  it

upon  the  target.  If  the  subject  is  uncon-

scious, the incoming spell is automatically

converted to a cure spell.

Receive  Spell:  The  incoming  spells

energy  can  immediately  trigger  another

spell  upon  the  target.  To  allow  the  sub-

ject  this  option,  you  must  designate  one

spell of 4th level or lower that you have

prepared  at  the  time  of  casting.  This

spell must be one that affects the targets

person. Designating one of your spells for

this  purpose  does  not  cause  you  to  lose

the  prepared  spell,  either  now  or  when

the effect is triggered. If the level of the

incoming spell is lower than that of your

designated  spell,  the  subject  cannot  acti-

vate this effect. Otherwise, if the subject

chooses this option, your designated spell

functions as if you had cast it. The dura-

tion of this triggered spell can outlast that

of the spellmantle itself.

For example, you could designate light-

ning bolt as one of the spells the spellmantle

absorbs and choose magic circle against evil

to be the spell the target receives. In that

case, every time the subject is in the area

of  a  lightning  bolt  (or  any  other  spell  of

3rd level or higher that you designate), it

can choose to be immediately protected by

magic circle against evil.

The spellmantle can absorb from three

to nine spell levels (1d4 +1 per four caster

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   112

12/19/03, 2:18:55 PM

levels)  of  incoming  spells.  If  the  spell-

mantle lacks suf cient capacity to absorb a

spell, the absorption does not occur. Once

it has absorbed its capacity, it dissipates.

Spell Phylactery

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Mystra 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Scroll touched

Duration: Permanent until triggered

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You  create  a  set  of  triggering  conditions

for a scroll that bears a spell on your spell

list. The spell must be one that affects your

person, and it must be of a level no higher

than one-fourth your caster level (rounded

down, maximum 5th). Any limitations that

would  normally  apply  to  your  reading  of

the scroll (such as a minimum ability score

or a caster level check) still apply.

The  conditions  needed  to  bring  the

spell into effect must be clear as de ned by

the contingency spell description, although

they can be general. For example, a spell

phylactery  used  with  a  scroll  of  water

breathing  might  prescribe  that  any  time

you are engulfed in water or any similar

liquid, the water breathing spell instantly

comes  into  effect.  Or  a  spell  phylactery

used with a feather fall scroll could trig-

ger  any  time  you  fall  more  than  4  feet.

Complicated or convoluted conditions may

cause  the  spell  phylactery  to  fail  when

called  upon.  The  scroll  is  activated  based

solely on the stated conditions, regardless

of your wishes at the time.

When the stated conditions are met, the

spell on the scroll is cast upon you as if you

had spent a standard action to use the scroll

yourself. If the scroll contains a spell that

is not on your spell list, or limitations on

the spell that would prevent you from cast-

ing it at the time, it is not cast when the

triggering condition occurs, and the magic

of the spell phylactery dissipates.

The  scroll  prepared  with  this  spell

must  be  bound  to  your  arm  or  forehead

(usually rolled tightly or placed in a small

box for this purpose), and it counts as a

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

bracer or headband in terms of space limi-

tations for magic items. This spell must be

cast once for each spell you wish to effect

on a scroll.

If another person wears the spell phy-

lactery, the magic of this spell ends. You

may remove and replace the spell phylac-

tery without penalty, but if 24 hours pass

without you wearing it, the magic of the

spell phylactery ends. The termination of

this spell does not harm the spell on the

scroll.

Stone Walk

Conjuration [Teleportation]

Level: Initiate of Bane 6

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Stone touched

Duration: Permanent until discharged

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

You magically link one location to another

so that you or someone else may speak a

command  word  at  one  end  and  be  tele-

ported to the other end.

Before casting this spell, you must pre-

pare  the  ends  of  the  link,  both  of  which

must be areas of stone 5 feet square. This

preparation  takes  1  hour,  and  they  serve

for repeated castings of the spell as long as

the stones are not damaged.

When  you  cast  stone  walk,  you  des-

ignate  a  command  word  and  touch  one

of  the  stones.  Both  stones  then  become

attuned to the command word you desig-

nate. Thereafter, any creature that speaks

the  command  word  while  standing  upon

one of the stones is teleported (as though

by  greater  teleport)  to  the  other  stone

instantaneously. The stones function once

for  every  four  caster  levels  you  possess,

and each usage can transport one willing

Medium or smaller creature plus one addi-

tional willing Medium or smaller creature

(each  carrying  gear  or  objects  up  to  its

maximum load) or its equivalent per three

caster  levels.  A  Large  creature  counts  as

two  Medium  creatures,  a  Huge  creature

counts  as  two  Large  creatures,  and  so

forth. All creatures to be transported must

be in contact with each other.

Because  of  the  special  link  between

the  stones,  travel  by  means  of  this  spell

is not impeded by abjurations such as di-

mensional lock or forbiddance. A gate seal

spell cast upon either stone suppresses the

stone walk effect.

Material  Component:  Preparation  of

each end of the link requires a paste made

from  rubies  and  amber  worth  2,500 gp.

Casting the spell requires a 2,500-gp dia-

mond. Activating one of the linked stones

once the spell is cast requires no material

components.

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of Malar 4, initiate of

Selne 4

Components: V, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

This spell functions only if you are a lycan-

thrope, and it bene ts you only while you

are in your humanoid form. While under

the  effect  of  this  spell,  you  gain  certain

characteristics of your animal form while

remaining in humanoid form. You gain the

same damage reduction you have in animal

form (normally 5/silver  or 10/silver), the

scent  special  quality,  and  the  feats  you

have access to in animal form. In addition,

you gain one-half the adjustment for each

ability score that you gain in animal form,

rounded  down  to  the  nearest  multiple  of

2. For example, if you are a werebear, you

gain  Str  +8  (half  of  your  animal  forms

+16) and Con +4 (half of +8), but no ad-

justment to your Dexterity because half of

+2, rounded down to the nearest multiple

of 2, is +0.

If you must make a Control Shape check

while  under  the  effect  of  this  spell,  you

take a 4 penalty on your check.

Focus: A lock of hair from your animal

form.

Area: 5-ft.-radius burst

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex partial; see text

You  create  a  burst  of  dazzling  light  that

is  equivalent  to  natural  sunlight.  Any

harmful or unnatural is blinded and takes

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   114

12/19/03, 2:19:50 PM

4d6 points of damage; every other creature

in the area is blinded and takes 2d6 points

of damage. A successful Re ex save negates

the  blindness  and  halves  the  damage  in

either case.

An  undead  creature  caught  within  the

burst  takes  1d6  points  of  damage  per

caster  level  (maximum  10d6).  A  success-

ful  Re ex  save  negates  the  blindness  and

halves  the  damage.  The  ultraviolet  light

generated  by  the  spell  also  deals

damage  to  fungi,  molds,  oozes,

and  slimes  just  as  if  they  were

undead creatures.

Sunrise  dispels  any  darkness

Abjuration

Level: Repose 8

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 min./level

This  spell  protects  you  against

some  conditionsuch  as  being

immersed in boiling oil or being

buried under an avalanchethat

would  ordinarily  cause  certain

death.  You  can  protect  yourself

only  against  a  natural  occur-

rence or a nonmagical condition,

not against a spell or the direct

attack  of  a  creature  (such  as  the  breath

of a dragon or the swords of a group of

bandits). At the time of casting, you must

specify  the  condition  against  which  you

wish  to  protect  yourself.  Should  you  be

subjected to that condition during the du-

ration of the spell, you feel no discomfort

and take no damage from the condition,

though  the  spell  does  not  protect  any

items carried on your person. If you are

still  subject  to  the  condition  at  the  end

of the spells duration, you suffer its full

normal effects.

Material  Component:  An  ointment  of

peach syrup and cinnabar.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

Sword and

Hammer

Evocation [Force]

Level: Initiate of Tyr 4

This spell functions like spiritual weapon,

except as indicated here. When you cast the

spell, two weapons made of force come into

Sunrise

being: a longsword and a warhammer. Both

weapons  grant  you  a  +1  bonus  on  attack

rolls. If you direct the weapons to attack

the same foe, they  ank that opponent, and

each  gains  the  appropriate  bonus  (+2)  on

attack  rolls  for   anking.  The  weapons  do

not deal sneak attack damage even if you

have levels in a class that grants the sneak

attack ability.

Sword and

Hammer, Greater

Evocation [Force]

Level: Initiate of Tyr 6

115

This  spell  functions  like  sword  and

hammer,  except  as  indicated  here.  The

longsword  and  warhammer  are  sized  for

Large creatures, and each deals 2d6 points

of force damage +1 point per three caster

levels (maximum +10) on a successful hit.

Each weapon grants a +2 bonus on attack

rolls. Furthermore, each threatens critical

hits  as  if  you  had  the  Improved  Critical

feat  (the  longsword  on  a  roll  of  1720,

and  the  warhammer  on  a  roll  of

1920).

Thorn Spray

Transmutation

Level: Initiate of nature 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2

levels)

Target: Up to one creature/level

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  hurl  a  thorny  plant  in  the

direction  of  the  targets.  The

spell transforms the plants small

thorns into a spray of thorns that

deals  damage  to  the  targets  you

select.

You  make  a  normal  ranged

attack  against  each  target  sepa-

rately,  taking  no  penalty  for  lack

of  pro ciency.  The  thorns  deal  a

total of 1d6 points of damage per

caster level (maximum 20d6), but you can

divide this damage among the targets you

select. You must choose how to divide the

damage  before  making  your  attack  rolls.

Thus,  an  8th-level  caster  can  target  a

single  creature  with  an  attack  that  deals

8d6 points of damage on a successful hit,

two  creatures  for  4d6  points  of  damage

each,  four  creatures  for  2d6  points  of

damage  each,  and  so  on.  You  may  divide

the damage as you wish.

A creature that takes damage from the

thorns is wracked with pain as though its

body  were  covered  with  stinging  nettles,

and  it  is  also  sickened  for  2d4  rounds.  A

successful Fortitude save negates the sick-

ened effect.

Symbol

Abjuration

Level: Rune 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Magic symbol touched

Duration: 10 minutes or until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  place  a  protective  spell  upon  your

hand  that  allows  you  to  touch  an

untriggered  magic  sigil  (such  as

a  glyph  of  warding  or  a  symbol

of  death)  without  setting  it  off.

The  touched  sigil  is  removed  from  its

location and held as magical potential

on  your  hand,  as  though  it  were  a

touch spell.

To  pick  up  the  spell  in  this

manner, you must make a success-

ful  caster  level  check  (DC  20

+  spell  level).  Failure  indicates

that  you  have  triggered  the

glyph or symbol. If you success-

fully  transfer  the  sigil  to  your

hand,  you  can  use  a  standard

action  to  place  it  on  a  surface

(not  a  creature)  of  the  sort

on  which  it  can  normally  be

scribed.  The  transferred  sigil

works  normally  thereafter  and

retains all its original triggering

conditions, although its current

location might make its triggers

dif cult or impossible to achieve.

You can maintain the magic sigil on

your hand as long as you concentrate. If

your  concentration  lapses  or  the  spell

duration  expires  while  the  sigil  is  thus

stored  as  potential,  it  immediately  trig-

gers upon you (and only you), even if you

normally would not meet its trigger con-

ditions.  The  effect  has  the  same  saving

throw and spell resistance aspects as the

original  spell  did.  The  only  safe  way  to

rid yourself of the stored spell it to place

it upon a suitable surface.

Focus:  A  piece  of  slate  that  has  been

scoured bare and smooth on one side.

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

Tree Healing

Conjuration (Healing)

Level: Initiate of nature 5

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal and touch

Targets: You and one tree

Duration: 1 day (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

Thorn spray

You  enter  a  normal  tree,  which  must  be

large  enough  to  accommodate  your  body

in  all  three  dimensions.  You  can  remain

hidden within it for as long as you desire,

up  to  1  day.  While  you  remain  inside  it,

the tree nourishes and heals you. You have

no need to breathe or eat, and you regain

a number of lost hit points equal to your

character level for each hour spent in the

tree.  If  you  remain  inside  for  an  entire

day, you receive the bene t of a heal spell.

The  tree  also  grants  you  total  cover  and

protects  you  from  extreme  heat  or  cold,

rain, sunlight, snow, and all other environ-

mental conditions. You can hear but not see

116

what occurs outside the tree. Minor physi-

cal damage to the tree does not harm you,

but  its  partial  destruction  (to  the  extent

that you no longer  t within it) expels you

and deals you 5d6 points of damage. If the

tree is totally destroyed (by a forest  re or

a blight spell, for example), you are expelled

from the tree and instantly slain unless you

succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save.

Triple Mask

Illusion (Shadow)

Level: Initiate of Cyric 7

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Three shadow duplicates

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will disbelief

(if interacted with)

Spell Resistance: No

You create three shadow dupli-

cates of yourself. These images

look, sound, and smell like you

but  are  intangible.  You  can

switch  your  perceptions  to

any shadow or your own body

as a free action on your turn.

When you use the perceptions

of  a  shadow,  it  mimics  your

actions  (including  speech)

unless  you  concentrate  on

making it act differently. Any

shadows  you  are  not  control-

ling  remain  motionless  and

unreactive. If you desire, any

spell you cast whose range is

touch or greater can originate from a con-

trolled shadow instead of from you. (The

shadows are quasi-realjust real enough to

cast  spells  that  you  originate.)  A  shadow

can  cast  only  spells  that  affect  shadows

on itself.

The  shadows  behave  like  the  servant

conjured by an unseen servant spell. They

are  mindless,  so  while  they  can  perform

simple  tasks  such  as  opening  doors,  they

cannot  perform  complex  tasks  such  as

puzzle solving.

A  controlled  shadow  can  also  be  pro-

grammed to move in a particular direction

or  to  a  location  you  know.  It  moves  at

manner until either it reaches its destina-

tion or you shift your perceptions to it and

program it to go somewhere else.

If  you  use  dimension  door,  teleport,

plane shift, or a similar spell that removes

you from the same plane as the shadows,

even momentarily, the spell ends.

Normally this spell is used to give you

several false bodiesone that acts as a safe

haven for casting spells (similar to project

image) and the other two as distractions.

Undead

Bane Weapon

Transmutation

Level: Paladin 3

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Weapon touched

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You give a weapon the undead bane special

ability  in  addition  to  any  other  magical

or  mundane  properties  it  has.  Against

undead,  your  weapons  enhancement

bonus (if any) is +2 higher than normal,

and it deals +2d6 points of bonus damage.

The  spell  has  no  effect  if  cast  upon  a

weapon that already has the undead bane

special ability. If you are caster level 9th

(paladin level 18th) or above, the weapon

gains a +1 enhancement bonus if it is not

already a magic weapon.

Alternatively, you can affect up to  fty

arrows,  bolts,  or  bullets  with  this  spell.

These  projectiles  must  be  of  the  same

type,  and  they  must  be  together  (in  the

same quiver, piled in the same spot, or the

like). Projectiles (but not thrown weapons)

lose  this  effect  after  an  attack  has  been

made with them.

A  weapon  affected  by  this  spell  is

considered good-aligned, so it has special

effects on certain creatures. Any weapon

affected by this spell glows with a serene

gray radiance that sheds as much light as

a candle.

Undeath

after Death

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Initiate of Bane 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 10 minutes

Range: Touch

Target: Willing living creature touched

Duration: Permanent until discharged

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  tear  off  a  piece  of  a  creatures  life

force, corrupt it with negative energy and

the power of undeath, then bind it back to

the same creatures body. This process ini-

tiates a blasphemous transformation when

the creature dies.

The subject of this spell loses 2 points

of Constitution upon casting. When it dies,

the  corrupted  life  force  initiates  a  slow

change in its body, causing it to animate as

a crypt spawn at the next sunset (see Chap-

ter 6 in Monstrous Compendium: Monsters

of  Faern).  If  the  creatures  remains  are

destroyed,  the  undeath  after  death  spell

cannot bring it back as an undead.

Even if the spell is dispelled before the

subject dies, it still does not regain its lost

Constitution points.

Material Components: A piece of obsid-

ian shaped like a heart, which is placed on

the  subjects  chest,  and  a  black  onyx  gem

worth  at  least  50  gp  per  HD  the  subject

creature  possesses  at  the  time  the  spell

is  cast.  This  gem  must  be  placed  in  the

subjects mouth.

You  grant  one  or  more  creatures  special

abilities  that  allow  them  to  effectively

destroy undead.

Each subject of this spell functions as

if  affected  by  negative  energy  protection,

except that a +10 sacred bonus applies to its

resistance roll against such attacks. It also

gains a +4 de ection bonus to AC against

attacks by undead and is immune to special

attacks by undead that deal ability damage

or ability drain, or af ict the target with

disease  or  poison.  The  subject  can  make

melee and ranged attacks against ethereal

ghost touch weapons and ignore any damage

reduction an undead opponent may have.

You gain an intuitive insight into the weak-

nesses and  aws of mechanical objects. You

can  make  untrained  Disable  Device  and

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell summons 1d4+3  endish (chaotic

evil)  or  celestial  (chaotic  good)  Medium

vipers (snakes), which leap forth from your

mouth to attack your enemies. Starting in

the round you complete the spell, you may

spit three vipers as a standard action or one

viper as a move action. (Thus, if you move

and then cast this spell, you may not spit

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   117

12/19/03, 2:21:42 PM

any vipers until your next turn, but if you

cast  this  spell  without  moving,  you  may

spit  forth  one  viper  as  your  move  action

in  that  round.)  Spat  vipers  land  at  your

feet  in  an  adjacent  square  of  your  choice

and act on the same round, on your turn,

just as creatures summoned by a summon

monster spell do.

The  snakes  are  not  actually  present  in

your mouth, and they do not interfere with

your  breathing.  However,  until  you  have

brought forth all the snakes summoned by

the spell, you cannot speak, cast spells with

verbal components, or activate items that

require  speech.  When  the  spells  duration

expires,  all  the  vipers  disappear,  and  any

not yet brought forth are lost.

When  you  use  a  summoning  spell  to

summon  an  evil  or  good  creature,  it  is  a

spell of that type.

Material Component: A snakeskin.

Wall of Moonlight

Evocation [Good, Light]

Level: Initiate of Selne 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Vertical plane with an area up to

one 5-ft. square/level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

An  immobile,  shimmering  tapestry  of

swirling,  pearl-white  light  springs  into

existence. This wall need not be anchored

to  any  surface,  and  creatures  can  readily

pass through it. Any undead creature that

comes  into  contact  with  the  wall  takes

4d12 points of damage. A creature of evil

alignment,  or  any  creature  carrying  the

holy  symbol  of  Shar  or  Umberlee,  takes

2d10 points of damage. Magic items that

come into contact with the wall glow with

a red faerie  re effect for 1d4+1 rounds.

The wall sheds bright light for 20 feet

in all directions and creates shadowy illu-

mination in a 40-foot radius. The wall of

moonlight  counters  and  dispels  any  dark-

ness spell of 4th level or lower within 40

feet of any part of it.

If  you  evoke  the  wall  so  that  it  ap-

pears  in  a  spot  occupied  by  creatures,

DOMAINS AND SPELLS

each creature takes damage as if passing

through the wall.

Wall of moonlight can be made perma-

nent with a permanency spell by a caster of

at least 12th level at a cost of 2,000 XP.

Any open, unprotected  ame thrust into

the wall of sand is instantly extinguished.

Arcane Material Component: A handful

This spell heightens the subjects senses and

awareness of danger. The subject gains a +4

and gains uncanny dodge for the duration

of the spell, retaining its Dexterity bonus

Divination

Level: Initiate of Gond 1

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 min./level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

This  spell  imbues  the  subject  with  a

touch  of  divine  guidance,  granting  it  a

+5  competence  bonus  on  a  skill  check  of

your  choice.  A  subject  that  has  no  ranks

in  the  designated  skill  functions  as  if  it

had 1/2 rank in the skill and therefore is

considered trained in it, even though this

1/2 rank adds nothing to checks made with

that skill.

Alternatively,  the  subject  may  gain

pro ciency  with  a  single  weapon  (simple,

martial,  or  exotic)  or  armor  (light,

medium, heavy, or shield) that you desig-

nate, as if it had the appropriate feat.

Wall of Sand

Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]

Level: Cleric 4, druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, M/DF

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Effect: Sand wall whose area is up to one

5-ft. square/level (S)

Duration: Concentration + 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

This  spell  conjures  up  a  viscous,  opaque

wall  of  swirling  sand.  The  spell  must  be

cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once

cast,  the  wall  is  immobile.  The  sand  is

suf ciently  thick  to  block  ranged  attacks,

providing normal cover appropriate for its

size,  but  creatures  may  attempt  to  force

their  way  through  it.  Moving  through

the  wall  of  sand  is  dif cult,  requiring  a

full-round action and a Strength check. A

creature  moves  5  feet  through  the  wall

of  sand  for  every  5  points  by  which  its

Strength check result exceeds 15.

Creatures within the wall of sand are

considered blinded and deafened, and they

are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they

may  begin  to  suffocate  if  they  remain

within the wall too long (see page 304 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide). Spells with

verbal components cannot be cast within

the  wall,  and  any  other  spell  requires  a

successful Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level).

It is possible to attack a character inside

or on the far side of the wall of sand with

a melee weapon, provided that the follow-

ing  criteria  are  met.  First,  the  attacker

must have a general idea where the target

is within the wall (that is, she must have

seen  her  target  enter  the  wall  recently).

Secondly, the target must be no deeper into

the  wall  than  the  reach  of  the  attackers

weapon (or, in the case of creatures on the

far side of the wall, the wall itself must not

be deeper than the attackers reach). Even

then,  the  target  bene ts  from  cover  and

Mag c

tems

In  a  magic-rich  setting  such  as  Faern,  items  of  great

power often  nd their way into the hands of heroes and

villains alike. This chapter presents a number of magic

items, ranging from lowly potions to world-shattering artifacts, to

add more magic to your FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign.

Armor Special Ability

The following armor special ability supplements those described in

Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Death Ward: This armors magic confers a death ward effect on

the wearer once per day for a duration of 7 minutes. The protection

automatically takes effect the  rst time the wearer is exposed to a

negative energy or death effect in the course of a day.

This armor property replaces both the death ward and the nega-

tive energy protection special abilities described in Magic of Faern.

Moderate necromancy; CL 7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

death ward; Price +2 bonus.

Magic Armor

and Shield

The following speci c armor and shield supplement those described

in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Captain Aerads Shield: Once wielded by a legendary dwarf hero

of Ammarindar, this shield is currently believed to rest in Hellgate

Keep. Legends say that Captain Aerads shield could shatter any

weapon that struck it, but in fact it is merely a +3 heavy steel shield.

Its legendary weapon-breaking prowess was a function of the crude

bronze weapons that Aerads foes wielded against him, not of power-

ful magic.

Moderate abjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

creator must be 9th level; Price 9,170 gp; Cost 4,670 gp + 360 XP;

Weight 15 lb.

dar, this dwarf-sized suit of armor is +1 red dragonhide scale mail.

In addition to its normal protective properties, it bestows resistance

to  re 10 upon its wearer.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, resist

energy; Price 25,400 gp; Cost 12,900 gp + 1,000 XP; Weight 30  b.

Weapon

Specal Abilities

The following weapon special abilities supplement those described

in Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Dispelling: Once per day as a free action, the wielder of a dispel-

ling weapon can use a targeted dispel magic effect upon a creature

the weapon strikes. The wielder can decide to use this power after

the blow has landed, but the dispel magic must be used in the same

round that the weapon strikes.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, dispel

magic; Price 6,000 gp.

Dispelling,  Greater:  Three  times  per  day  as  a  free  action,  the

wielder of a greater dispelling weapon can use a targeted greater

dispel magic effect upon a creature the weapon strikes. The wielder

can  decide  to  use  this  power  after  the  blow  has  landed,  but  the

greater  dispel  magic  must  be  used  in  the  same  round  that  the

weapon strikes.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

greater dispel magic; Price 79,200 gp.

Domineering:  A  creature  hit  by  a  domineering  weapon  must

make a DC 16 Will save or become shaken.

MAGIC ITEMS

Moderate  enchantment;  CL  11th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, fear; Price +2 bonus.

Doomwarding: Weapons with this ability are sometimes bestowed

on adventurers favored by the church of Tymora. Typically, each is

created with 7 charges. The wielder can spend 1 charge on his turn

(as a free action) to make an extra attack with the weapon. She can

also use 1 charge at any time, but no more than once per round, to

reroll any die. The wielder can decide to spend a charge to reroll a

die after learning the result of the original die roll.

Strong transmutation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

limited wish; Price 38,500 gp; Cost 14,000 gp + 3,220 XP.

Spellblade: The wielder of a spell-

blade weapon is immune to a single

spell chosen at the time the weapon

is created. The selected spell must

be one that is targeted against the

wielder,  not  one  that  affects  an

area  or  creates  an  effect.  When

the wielder is next subjected to the

chosen  spell,  the  weapon  absorbs

it. On his next turn, he can opt to

either let the spell drain harmlessly

away or direct it at a new target as

a free action.

Strong  abjuration;  CL  13th;

Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

spell turning; Price 6,000 gp.

Sure  Striking:  A  sure  striking

weapon  overcomes  damage  reduc-

tion  as  though  it  were  aligned

chaotic,  evil,  good,  or  lawful

whichever  is  most  appropriate  for

the foe.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL

6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

align weapon; Price +1 bonus.

All of the baneblades are +4 holy, evil outsider and undead bane

swords. Each sheds light equivalent to that of a torch, though the

wielder may suppress this light with a mental command. The in-

dividual blades also have their own additional powers, as described

below. Unless otherwise noted, each power of a baneblade is acti-

vated by command word.

Evaelathil: This short sword is sized for Small wielders and usable

only by hal ings. It glows with a soft green light when drawn.

In addition to the standard baneblade abilities, Evaelathil grants

its wielder resistance to  re 10 and allows her to use charm person

and locate creature once per day each.

Baneblades of Demron

Magic

Weapons

The following speci c weapons supplement those described in Chap-

ter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Baneblades  of  Demron:  The  six  powerful  swords  known  as

the baneblades of Demron were created over the course of 300

years. Though the archmage Demron receives the credit for their

creation,  the  weapons  were  actually  cooperative  efforts,  created

jointly  by  all  the  races  that  inhabited  Myth  Drannor  before

its fall. Each of the blades was keyed to one particular type of

wielder. (In game terms, only members of a speci c race or class

may use a given baneblade.) The baneblade functions as a mas-

terwork, nonmagical weapon if the wielder is of an inappropriate

race and/or class.

120

impressive

greatsword is sized for a Medium creature. Unlike its predecessors,

Morvian is not limited to users of a single race. The only restric-

tion upon its use is that the wielder must be lawful good. When

drawn from its scabbard, Morvian glows with a  erce yellow light

like that of the sun.

Morvian has the standard  properties of all baneblades, and it

is also an axiomatic weapon that allows its wielder to use daylight

once per day.

lawful  good;  Price  158,389  gp;  Cost  79,369  gp  +  6,321  XP;

Weight 8 lb.

Faervian: This longsword is sized for Medium creatures and may

be wielded only by an arcane spellcaster. Faervian looks as though

it were forged from one solid piece of burnished steel, and it glows

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   120

MAGIC ITEMS

a deep purple when drawn. The craftsmanship of this blade, unlike

the others, is distinctly elven.

Faervian has the standard powers described above, and it is also

a spell storing weapon. Furthermore, it allows its wielder to cast up

to three spells each day as if using the Still Spell metamagic feat.

Strong  evocation  (plus  aura  of  stored  spell)  [good];  CL  12th;

Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,  holy  smite,  Still  Spell;  Price

134,970 gp; Cost 67,642 gp + 5,386 XP; Weight 4 lb.

Dragathil: This slightly curved rapier is sized for Medium crea-

tures. It has a row of small rubies down the center of the blade and

a large basket hilt in the form of roses twined around three harps.

Dragathil glows with a  erce red light when drawn, but despite its

fearsome appearance, it is designed to subdue opponents peacefully

rather than smite them with arcane  re or razor-sharp steel.

Dragathil has the standard baneblade properties, and it is also a

merciful weapon that allows the wielder to use hold person once per

day. Only a character skilled at persuasion and negotiation (one who

possesses at least 5 ranks of Diplomacy) may wield Dragathil.

Strong  evocation  [good];  CL  12th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, cure light wounds, hold person, holy smite, creator must be

good; Price 125,720 gp; Cost 63,020 gp + 5,016 XP; Weight 2 lb.

Keryvian: The last of the baneblades, Keryvian was also the most

powerful of Demrons swords. This bastard swords blade is tinted a

light shade of blue, and its hilt is shaped in the likeness of a great

blue  dragon  clutching  the  blade  in  its  teeth.  When  wielded  in

battle, Keryvian glows and crackles with blue energy. Only a  ghter,

paladin, or ranger of good alignment may wield it. Keryvian has

the standard baneblade powers, and it is also a keen weapon that

allows its wielder to use jump, feather fall, and alarm at will. The

alarm is always of the audible variety, and it is triggered only when

someone other than Keryvians owner touches it. Furthermore, each

time Keryvian scores a critical hit, it bestows one negative level on

the target. The wielder receives 1d6 temporary hit points that last

for 24 hours each time a negative level is bestowed. One day after

being struck, the victim must make a DC 16 Fortitude save for each

negative level or lose a character level.

Strong  evocation  [good];  CL  12th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, alarm, enervation, feather fall, holy smite, jump, spell turn-

ing; Price 207,070 gp; Cost 103,692 gp + 8,270 XP; Weight 4 lb.

Cheldaorn Katar: This +1 punch dagger, carved from the tooth

of a black dragon, functions identically to a dagger of venom. The

 rst of these weapons was crafted by a renegade elf assassin from

the city of Ascalhorn, which is now known as Hellgate Keep. Since

Hellgate Keeps destruction, copies of this weapon have begun ap-

pearing in the hands of hired killers across Faern.

Faint  necromancy;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

poison; Price 8,302 gp; Cost 4,302 gp + 320 XP; Weight 1 lb.

Craemmols Hammer: Owned by a dwarf warrior legendary for

both his battle prowess and his greed, this +3 warhammer sheds

bright yellow light equivalent to that of a torch. Whenever a drow

comes within 60 feet of the wielder, the weapon makes a loud ring-

ing  sound  like  a  tremendous  bell.  If  the  wielder  concentrates  on

the hammer for 1 full round, she learns the precise location of the

nearest  drow  and  the  total  number  of  drow  that  are  within  the

weapons detection radius.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  11th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, true seeing; Price 43,312 gp; Cost 21,812 gp + 1,720

XP; Weight 5 lb.

Heartcleaver: Originally wielded by the nycaloth lord Gaulguth,

this  fearsome  +2  vorpal  battleaxe  is  sized  for  a  Large  creature.

Heartcleavers blade constantly drips a foul, greenish ichor, which

inhibits magical healing of the wounds it in icts.

Any character attempting to cast a conjuration (healing) spell

on a creature that has been struck by Heartcleaver must make a

DC 20 caster level check, or the spell has no effect. This inhibiting

effect wears off once a creature wounded by Heartcleaver has been

restored to full normal hit points (either through rest and natural

healing or through magical healing that overcomes the weapons

special power).

Heartcleaver was last seen in the hands of a great hero who died

at the Final Stand on the Evening Star, when the city of Myth

Drannor fell. It is believed to lie somewhere within the rubble of

the city.

Strong  evocation;  CL  18th;  Craft  Magic  Weapon,  circle  of

death, keen edge, bestow curse; Price 314,320 gp; Cost 157,320 gp

+ 12,560 XP; Weight 12 lb.

Lashing Sword of Samos the Skullreaver: This peculiar +1 short

sword, once owned by a dwarf undead hunter, trails a luminous

arc of blue energy that resembles a whip from its pommel. This

whip  harmlessly  and  insubstantially  passes  through  most  crea-

tures, but it is devastating to undead. The wielder of the lashing

sword may use this energy whip to make a touch attack against

an undead creature, which must make a DC 17 Will save or be

destroyed.  A  character  need  not  be  pro cient  with  the  whip  to

make this attack.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

disrupting weapon; Price 56,310 gp; Cost 27,310 gp + 2,160 XP;

Weight 2 lb.

Nychyaellas Healing Spear: This +2 spear has a shaft of shadow-

top-wood and a head of gleaming alchemical silver. Three times per

day on a successful attack, the wielder may drain hit points from

the victim and heal herself of the same amount of damage, as if

affected by a vampiric touch spell. She may elect to use this ability

after a successful attack has been made.

Moderate necromancy; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

vampiric  touch;  Price  44,392  gp;  Cost  22,392  gp  +  1,760  XP;

Weight 6 lb.

Rustblade: These +1 daggers always look pitted and rusted, though

they suffer no adverse effects of corrosion. Any object made of iron

or iron alloy that is touched by a rustblade crumbles away as if af-

fected by a rusting grasp spell.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL  7th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor,  rusting  grasp;  Price  58,302  gp;  Cost  29,302  gp  +  2,320

XP; Weight 1 lb.

Twinblades  Alight:  This  double-headed  battleaxe  is  forged  half

of cold iron and half of adamantine, allowing it to overcome the

damage reduction of creatures resistant to either material. In the

hands of a lawful good dwarf, it glows softly and functions as a +2

axiomatic holy battleaxe. When wielded by anyone else, it is simply

a +2 battleaxe and does not glow.

Tyrannys  Knell:  This  golden  warhammer  functions  like  a

dwarven  thrower  with  the  following  additional  abilities.  Once

per tenday, the wielder of Tyrannys Knell may strike the hammer

against the ground (a standard action) to create an effect identical

to that of the earthquake spell. Each time the hammer strikes a

creature of the giant type, the target must make a DC 16 Fortitude

save or be affected as if by a reduce person spell (even though that

spell normally affects only humanoids).

Rings

The following rings supplement those described in Chapter 7 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Akkabars  Battleblade  Ring:  On  close  inspection,  this  ring  of

twisted metal looks like an endless ring of swords, their blades inter-

twining like vines. Once per day, the wearer may speak a command

word and cause the ring to  y off his  nger, growing and expanding

into a curtain of slashing blades placed as the wearer designates, as

per the blade barrier spell. When the duration of the spell expires

or  the  wearer  dismisses  the  effect,  Akkabars  battleblade  ring

shrinks back to its normal size. It returns to its wearers  nger 1

round later, provided that he is alive and within 60 feet, and there

is no obstructing object that the ring cannot circumvent (such as a

wall or door) between him and the ring. If the ring cannot return

to the wearer, it instead drops to the ground at the location where

the blade barrier was centered.

Moderate evocation [force]; CL 12th; Forge Ring, blade barrier;

Price 25,920 gp.

Annulus Con agros: This twisted copper ring resembles a loop

of dancing  ames, and the rubies and topazes with which it is set

seem to re ect the different colors within a  re. Each annulus

con agros ring bestows resistance to  re 10 upon its wearer and

allows her to activate the following abilities with the appropriate

command words.

Pyrotechnics (at will)

Burning hands (3/day)

Fireball (2/day)

Wall of  re (1/day)

Moderate evocation [ re]; CL 6th; Forge Ring, burning hands,

 reball, pyrotechnics, resist energy, wall of  re; Price 92,340 gp.

Velsharoons Binding: This peculiar item is actually a pair of rings

designed to be worn on the pinky and index  ngers, though it still

counts as only one ring for the purpose of magic item limitations. A

 ne silver chain joins the two rings. The ring of Velsharoons bind-

ing protects its wearer against undead beings, as if via a protection

from evil spell, except that the bonuses are granted against undead

rather than against any evil creature. The wearer also gains a +3

resistance bonus on saving throws against spells of the necromancy

school.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  5th;  Forge  Ring,  halt  undead;  Price

33,500 gp.

Rods

The following rods supplement those described in Chapter 7 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Rod of Divergence: Each of these rods is engraved with various

protective runes and capped with a gem. The type of gem depends

upon the form of energy the rod of divergence is designed to protect

against (an emerald for acid, a sapphire for cold, a topaz for electric-

ity, a ruby for  re, or a diamond for sonic). When any effect of the

appropriate energy type is targeted at the wielder or at any point

within 10 feet of him, he may expend 3 charges from the rod as a

free action to redirect the attack to any point of his choosing within

60 feet. An area spell must be centered on a point within 10 feet of

the wielder to be subject to redirection. (In other words, a  reball

cast at a point 15 feet away could not be redirected, even though

parts of the effect would come within 10 feet of the wielder.) Ad-

ditionally, a rod of divergence can duplicate the effects of a faerie

 re spell. Use of this ability costs no charges. A rod of divergence

has 50 charges when  rst created.

Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Rod, faerie  re, spell turning;

Price 117,000 gp.

Rod of Spheres: Elminster reportedly designed the  rst of these

rare and strange rods, but wizards all over Toril have since made

many copies. The sole function of a rod of spheres is to create large,

transparent bubbles, each with a radius of 3 feet. These bubbles glow

softly, giving off light equivalent to that of a candle. The bubbles

 oat along gently at a speed of 20 feet per round as directed by the

wielder of the rod, and each can hold up to 140 pounds of creatures

or  items.  Any  object  within  a  bubble  is  protected  from  exposure

to the elements (rain, wind, snow, or the like, though the bubbles

provide no special bonuses or resistances against energy attacks) and

is affected as if by a feather fall spell should it fall more than 10

feet. The bubbles last up to 8 hours or until ruptured.

A bubble is not a prison; any intelligent being that is not securely

bound  can  break  a  bubble  with  ease.  The  rod  of  spheres  has  50

charges when it is created, and the formation of each bubble costs

1 charge.

Moderate  evocation  [force];  CL  9th;  Craft  Rod,  feather  fall,

Tensers  oating disk; Price 25,000 gp.

Staff

The following staff supplements those described in Chapter 7 of the

Dungeon Masters Guide.

Thunderstaff: At least a dozen thunderstaffs are known to exist,

including one in the possession of Khelben Blackstaff Arunsun.

Each thunderstaff is a 6-foot length of duskwood capped at the

head with a mithral casting of a blue dragons head and at the base

122

with a long mithral spike, which allows the staff to be used as a

spear in emergencies. A thunderstaff holds several spells related to

thunder, lightning, and weather control, usually one spell of each

level. It is rumored that each thunderstaff has a unique suite of

powers. The following set of spells is only one example of what a

thunderstaff might hold.

Shocking grasp (1 charge)

Gedlees electric loop (1 charge)

Lightning bolt (1 charge)

Thunderlance (2 charges)

Ball lightning (2 charges)

Chain lightning (2 charges)

Great thunderclap (3 charges)

Lightning ring (3 charges)

Shapechange (blue dragon only) (3 charges)

Wondrous Items

The following wondrous items supplement those described in Chap-

ter 7 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Aquamarine  of  Spell  Extending:  This  blue  stone  is  mounted  in

the center of a gold and silver hourglass. Once per day, the owner

can gain the bene ts of the Extend Spell feat on any spell of 6th

level or lower that she casts. The affected spell uses its normal spell

slot (not a slot one level higher, as use of the feat would require). A

caster who does not prepare spells still must pay the penalty of an

extended casting time when using this item. The item must be held

in the casters hand while the spell is cast to gain this bene t.

Strong  (no  school);  CL  17th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  Extend

Spell; Price 3,700 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Gauntlets  of  Weaponry  Arcane:  These  heavy  leather-and-silver

gauntlets  cover  the  wearers  hands  and  lower  forearms.  Ornate

silver  stitching  decorates  the  leather  armguards  and   ngers,  and

each link of the silver chainmail that reinforces the palms is etched

with intricate runes. Any weapon (even a nonmetallic one such as

a quarterstaff) that the wearer grasps while wearing the gauntlets

overcomes damage reduction as if it were a magic silver weapon.

If the weapon is already magic and silver, the gauntlets have no

additional effect.

Faint  transmutation;  CL  3rd;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  magic

weapon; Price 9,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Glove of Taarnahm the Vigilant: This chainmail gauntlet allows

the wielder to hurl any melee weapon he carries as though it had

the throwing and returning special abilities.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, magic

stone, telekinesis; Price 10,000 gp.

Instrument of the Winds: This  ne instrument is a masterwork

lute  (+2  circumstance  bonus  on  Perform  [string  instruments]

checks). Once per day, the user can attempt to play a certain tune

on  the  instrument.  If  she  succeeds  on  a  DC  15  Perform  (string

instruments) check, the instrument of the winds summons a Large

air elemental, as though with the summon monster VI spell.

Moderate Conjuration; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, summon

monster VI; Price 22,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.

Kiira NVaelahr: These bright green gems, each about the size

of a mans  st, were created for the most skilled spies serving the

city of Myth Drannor before it fell. When placed against the skin,

a  kiira  NVaelahr  embeds  itself  painlessly  into  the   esh  where

it touches,  xing itself so  rmly that it cannot be removed. Tra-

ditionally,  such  a  gem  was  placed  over  the  heart,  but  it  may  be

bonded anywhere the owner desires. Once implanted, the gem may

be moved along the users body through mental concentration. A

bonded kiira NVaelahr grants the following powers.

LThe  kiira  NVaelahr  acts  as  a  sort  of  recorder,  storing  the

memories of its current owner automatically. The stored memo-

ries can be replayed as a vision. Such a review of the information

is visible and audible only to the bearer of the kiira unless he

uses another of its abilities (see below) to make it visible to others.

These memories encompass sight and sound only, and they are

somewhat hazy and dif cult to focus on. (Attempts to see or hear

a particular event in the vision take a 2 penalty on Spot and

Listen checks.) The gems owner may, as a standard action, will

the gem to record memories in greater detail. The gem can hold

up to 10 hours of such detailed memories, which impose no skill

penalties on later readings. At the owners option, these detailed

memories may include his thoughts and feelings as well.

LThe  owner  may  use  detect  thoughts  at  will.  He  may  also  send

telepathic  messages  (including  memories  stored  in  his  kiira

NVaelahr, if desired) to anyone whose thoughts he is currently

reading.

LThe bearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on Will saves.

LThe  gems  owner  may  use  major  image  once  per  day.  Only

memories  stored  in  the  kiira  NVaelahr  may  be  projected  in

this manner.

LThe gems owner may use overland  ight once per day.

Moderate divination, illusion, and transmutation; CL 7th; Craft

Wondrous  Item,  detect  thoughts,  major  image,  overland   ight;

Price 75,040 gp.

Mantle Stone of Vhyridaan: This small gem resembles an ioun

stone in most respects. It  oats in a loose orbit 1d3 feet from its

users head and can be separated from its owner only by snatching

or netting it. The mantle stone of Vhyridaan has AC 26, 10 hit

points,  and  a  hardness  of  5.  Three  times  per  day,  the  user  may

speak a command word to gain protection from spells. This effect

functions  like  the  spell  turning  spell,  except  that  a  mantle  stone

always absorbs  ve spell levels before being discharged rather than

the usual 1d4+6.

Additionally, the owner of the mantle stone may imbue it with up

to three spell levels each day, as if it were a vibrant purple ioun stone

(as described on page 260 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

Strong abjuration; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, imbue with

Najjars Cloak of Weaponry: Created by a Calishite  ghter/wizard

to aid him in battle against his rival Vycaena, this gauzy-looking

cloak  of  white  linen  is  lined  with  the  tanned  pelt  of  a  displacer

beast. Once per round, the wearer may reach into the cloaks folds

and withdraw a single weapon that has been stored there. Najjars

cloak of weaponry  functions  like  a  bag of holding,  except  that  it

stores  only  25  pounds  of  nonliving  material  of  a  volume  that

would reasonably  t beneath a 6-foot-long cloak. Most two-handed

weapons  do  not   t,  unless  they  can  be  coiled  or  folded  in  some

way, but the cloak can easily hold light or one-handed weapons or

other items of comparable size. Since the cloak was designed to hold

weapons, it does not suffer the ill effects from puncturing

that a bag of holding does.

Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous

Item, Leomunds secret chest; Price 2,500 gp.

Pegasus Helm of Kloeth Ironstar: This mag-

ni cent winged helmet allows its wearer to

summon a celestial pegasus twice per day

to serve as a mount or aid in battle. Each

summoning  requires  a  command  word,

and the creature summoned remains for

up to 3 hours, though the wearer may cut

the duration short if desired.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft

Wondrous  Item,  summon  monster  IV;

Price 20,160 gp.

Ruehars  Flute:  This   nely  crafted

silver  ute resembles a rolled-up spell

scroll, with its holes lining the edge

of  the  parchment.  It  has  seldom

been  seen  outside  the  possession  of

the  descendants  of  Ruehar,  a  green

elf  wizard  who  lived  during  the  days  of  Myth

Drannor.

When  two  short  notes  in  any  key  are  played

on the  ute, it emanates light, as the spell, and

automatically dispels any of the following effects within the light

effects radius: acid fog, cloudkill, fog cloud, obscuring mist, solid fog,

and stinking cloud.

The  utes second ability is activated by a command word known

only to Ruehars descendants. When this word is spoken, the  ute

unrolls like a scroll, revealing a small spellbook capable of hold-

ing  twenty  spell  levels.  The  original  Ruehars   ute  contains  the

following  spells:  1stcolor  spray,  magic  missile,  Tensers   oating

disk,  ventriloquism;  2nddaze  monster,  glitterdust,  lively  step;

3rdLeomunds tiny hut, phantom steed; 4thpolymorph. Ruehars

descendants may, however, have manufactured more  utes since his

death, and those spellbooks may contain different spells or simply

remain blank. Any wizard who has deciphered the spellbook within

Ruehars  ute (see pages 178 and 179 of the Players Handbook)

may study and prepare these spells normally.

Faint  transmutation;  CL  3rd;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  gust  of

wind, light; Price 15,000 gp.

Pegaus helm of

Kloeth Ironstar

Shroudcrown:  This  agate-studded  bronze  circlet  holds  consider-

able power over undead. The wearer of the shroudcrown can turn

undead as a 10th-level cleric, and she gains a +2 resistance bonus

on all saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities of undead

creatures. Furthermore, the wearer is constantly affected as if by a

hide from undead spell. Though the shroudcrown is not actually

cursed in any way, its owners have an unfortunate tendency to meet

messy ends at the claws of the very undead creatures against which

it protects.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, hide from

undead, resistance, creator must be a cleric

of at least 10th level; Price 113,600 gp.

Symrustars  Choker:  This  ornate

choker,  sized  and  designed  for  an  elf

womans throat, functions as a spellbook.

As  long  as  a  wizard  character

wears  it,  she  may  study  and  pre-

pare any spell scribed in the item.

Symrustars  choker  may  store  a  total  of

thirty-six spells, but no more than four of

each  level.  The  choker  is  treated  like  a  wizards

spellbook  for  the  purpose  of  deciphering  spells

contained  therein,  scribing  new  spells,  and  so

forth.  To  determine  randomly  how  many  spells

are stored in a given choker, roll 1d41 for each

spell level, then roll randomly as if generating a

scroll to  nd the exact spells.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Won-

drous Item, secret page; Price 15,000 gp.

Tasmias  Heart:  This  elaborate,  high-necked

bustier is laced and lined with black silk and adorned

with sapphires and beljurils. It functions as both a helm

of  underwater  action  and  a  ring  of  freedom  of  move-

ment. It also extends the wearers life span, doubling the

number of years in each remaining age category of the

characters life, as well as her maximum age. For exam-

ple,  a human adult who dons Tasmias heart would reach middle

age at 70, old age at 106, venerable age at 140, and maximum age

2d202 years after that. Tasmias heart counts as a shirt for the

purpose of magic item limitations (see page 214 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, free-

dom of movement, water breathing, creator must be at least 10th

level; Price 127,000 gp.

Weirdstone:  These  innocuous-looking,   st-sized  pieces  of  fac-

eted glass are among the most highly sought-after items in all of

Faern. Mages who like their privacy and evil beings who prefer to

keep their plans secret are particularly fond of these items, and they

often dispatch minions or adventurers to retrieve them.

When placed upon a  at surface and activated by mental com-

mand,  a  weirdstone   oats  about  3  feet  into  the  air,  glowing  and

chiming softly. While active, it blocks out all of the following within

a 6-mile radius (including into the air above and the ground below).

The weirdstone hampers only effects that manifest within its area.

Spells or abilities activated within the weirdstones area that target

an  area  outside  its  6-mile  radius  are  unaffected.  For  example,  a

wizard  standing  right  next  to  a  weirdstone  could  cast  a  scrying

spell to spy on a creature more than 6 miles away, but she could not

teleport across the room because the weirdstone blocks teleportation

magic within its radius.

Ynloeths Bracer: Owned by Coronal Ynloeth of Shantel Oth-

Unique Magic Weapons

Unlike  the  speci c  magic  weapons  described  in  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide, the weapons in this section are uniqueonly one

Calathangas, for instance, exists in all of Faern. Some of these

unique weapons are intelligent (see the rules for intelligent items on

page 268 of the Dungeon Masters Guide), while others are not.

Black Sword: This item is a +3 bastard sword created at the height

of the Imaskari Empire to overthrow the emperor. Its statistics are

as follows:

AL  LN;  Int  10,  Wis  14,  Cha  14;  Speech,  120-ft.  vision  and

hearing; Ego score 15.

Lesser Powers: Darkness 3/day, silence 3/day.

Greater Power: Dispel magic 3/day.

Special Purpose: Overthrow tyrants.

Dedicated Power: Wielder gets a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls,

saves, and checks.

Personality: The black sword is haughty and single-minded. It

does  not  like  to  be  wielded  by  creatures  it  thinks  are  beneath  it

(which includes most characters), and it speaks little when it is in

such unpleasant circumstances. If placed in a position of being able

to  ght a tyrant, however, it grows extremely excited and constantly

urges its wielder on.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

darkness, dispel magic, divine favor, silence; Price 131,335 gp; Cost

55,835 gp + 5,240 XP.

Calathangas: Also called the rat blade and the sting of Xerastos,

this +1 rapier  rst appeared in the Dalelands nearly a century ago.

Any humanoid who wields it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save

each tenday that the blade is in his possession; failure indicates that

he  has  contracted  lycanthropy  and  become  an  af icted  wererat.

Likewise, any humanoid hit by the blade must succeed on a DC 15

Fortitude save or contract lycanthropy of the same sort.

Calathangas glows only when there are rats within 50 feet of it.

Once per day, the wielder can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms or a pack

of 3d6 dire rats as a standard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6

rounds and serve the wielder for up to 1 hour.

Moderate conjuration; CL 6th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

summon  natures  ally  III;  Price  15,800  gp;  Cost  8,060  gp  +

620 XP.

Dyerwaen:  Forged  by  the  elves  of  old  Myth  Drannor,  this  +2

bastard sword was given as a token of friendship to the  rst human

settlers in the Dalelands. It grants a number of magical abilities

to its wielder. In forest settings, a character carrying Dyerwaen is

camou aged, gaining a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. In

addition, she can use pass without trace at will in such an environ-

ment  and  intuit  direction  at  will  anywhere.  She  also  gains  a  +2

competence  bonus  on  Survival  checks.  On  command,  Dyerwaen

can produce a hide from animals effect (usable at will) and a speak

with plants effect (usable once per day). Finally, the wielder gains

a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks against elves, fey, and

woodland creatures of good alignment. Dyerwaen is a chaotic and

good  weapon,  so  it  can  bypass  the  damage  reduction  of  certain

lawful or evil outsiders.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; creator must be a druid; Price

29,335 gp; Cost 14,667 gp and 5 sp + 1,173 XP.

Elqillar: A Calishite illusionist named Akhir Ahad, who intended

it to help him escape assassination at the hands of political rivals,

crafted this +1 scimitar. At the wielders command, Elqillar can

transform into a scimitar, dagger, kukri, or sword of any kind sized

for  a  Small,  Medium,  or  Large  creature.  Whatever  its  guise,  it

retains its +1 enhancement bonus, and multicolored runes spelling

its name appear on its blade.

A character who has Elqillar on his person can use disguise self

at will. When holding the weapon in his hand, he is immune to

detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern

his alignment, as though he were wearing a ring of mind shielding.

Finally, when Elqillar strikes a creature that is in any form other

than its natural one, that creature must make a DC 18 Will saving

throw or immediately revert to its natural form (humanoid or giant

is the natural form for both af icted and natural lycanthropes).

Strong illusion; CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,  disguise

self, nondetection, polymorph; Price 167,315 gp; Cost 83,815 gp +

6,680 XP.

Evithyans Blade: This +3 longsword was fashioned in Myth Dran-

nor by the ancient elf hero whose name it carries, then used to  ght

the drow in the Underdark. Similar to a bane weapon, Evithyans

blade becomes a +5 longsword against drow. Rather than dealing

extra damage as a bane weapon would, however, it deals 2d4 points

of Constitution damage to any drow it hits. A DC 20 Fortitude save

reduces the Constitution damage by half.

Minor Artifact

This  artifact  is  unique  to  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  setting.  The

secrets of its construction have long ago been lost.

Shattering Swords of Coronal Ynloeth: This artifact is actually

a pair of +5 holy speed longswords, which were once owned by a

Coronal  of  Shantel  Othreier  during  the  Crown  Wars.  Though

many ancient elven ballads and epics mention Coronal Ynloeth

and his mighty blades, the ultimate fate of the swords remains

uncertain.  It  is  known  that  the  blades  were  wielded  in  several

major  battles  of  the  Crown  Wars,  including  the  Battle  of  the

Gods  Theater  in  10,700  DR.  Ynloeth  himself  died  mysteri-

ously in 10,600 DR, shortly before Shantel Othreier fell to the

Vyshaantar Empire. The ultimate fate of the shattering swords is

not known for certain, but they are believed to lie somewhere in

the region of Hellgate Keep.

When  wielded  individually,  the  shattering  swords  of  Coronel

Ynloeth function as mere +2 longswords. If wielded simultaneously,

they take on their full abilities as described above, and the wielder

may unlock the blades greatest power. Once per year, the blades

may be struck together in a speci c manner and shattered. The

shards of the swords multiply into a storm of razor-sharp steel,

which scours a 500-foot-radius burst centered on the wielder, slay-

ing any creature that fails a DC 30 Re ex save. Success indicates

that the creature takes 15d6 points of damage instead. Unfortu-

nately, this effect also slays the wielder of the shattering swords

(no save) and destroys his body to the extent that a true resurrec-

tion spell is required to bring him back. The shattering swords of

Coronal Ynloeth reform at a random location somewhere in Faern

24 hours after being shattered.

Strong transmutation; CL 20th; Weight 4 lb. each.

Ilbratha, Mistress of Battle: This +1 longsword was forged at the

behest of King Azoun I of Cormyr, but it was subsequently lost

in a storm at sea. In addition to its enhancement bonus, Ilbratha

allows the wielder to use jump three times per day, blink once per

day,  and  mirror  image  once  per  day  with  the  proper  command

words. It also rings like struck chimes when it touches spell effects

or magic items.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

blink,  detect  magic,  jump,  mirror  image;  Price  31,115  gp;  Cost

15,715 gp + 1,232 XP.

Nightwatcher:  This  adamantine  +3  longsword  is  a  relic  of  an-

cient Netheril. Its blade is black and its pommel is silver, worked in

ivory and set with a large black pearl. Nightwatchers bearer gains

low-light vision, and the blade disperses magical darkness within

30 feet if it succeeds on a caster level check (as if casting dispel

magic). When planted  rmly into the ground, Nightwatcher hums

loudly if anyone with intent to harm its owner approaches within

60 feet.

Moderate  evocation;  CL  9th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

alarm,  dispel  magic,  light;  Price  89,315  gp;  Cost  44,815  gp  +

3,560 XP.

Shazzellim: This +1 keen scimitar was created by the Red Wizards

of  Thay  to  combat  the  Harpers.  Its  crosspiece  has  an  ornament

shaped like a pair of rearing serpents. Its statistics are as follows.

AL NE; Int 17, Wis 10, Cha 17; Speech and telepathy, 120-ft.

darkvision and hearing; Ego score 17.

Lesser Powers: Detect magic at will, locate object 3/day, 10 ranks

in Search (total modi er +13).

Special Purpose: Slay members of the Harpers.

Dedicated Power: Fireball (10d6  re damage).

Personality: Shazzellim is mean and dour. It almost seems to

resent its existence and sentience, and it certainly loathes the poor

quality of care it has received since its forging, as demonstrated by a

few nicks in the blade and some damage to the ornament of its cross-

piece. Shazzellim speaks Common, Orc, Abyssal, and  Infernal.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

detect magic,  reball, locate object; Price 92,415 gp; Cost 46,365 gp

+ 3,684 XP.

Taragarth,  the  Bloodbrand:  This  +1  short  sword  was  forged  in

Silverymoon  in  the  early  days  of  the  North  and   rst  wetted  in

battle against the trolls of the Evermoors. While holding it un-

sheathed, the wielder gains resistance to  re 10 and is immune to

detect thoughts, discern lies, and any attempt to magically discern

her alignment.

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, nonde-

tection, resist energy; Price 42,310 gp; Cost 21,310 gp + 1,680 XP.

S ince  the  release  of  the  Third  Edition  DUNGEONS

&  DRAGONS  game,  a  number  of  supplements  have

expanded the choices available in a D&D campaign.

Books  such  as  Epic  Level  Handbook,  Manual  of  the  Planes,

Psionics Handbook, Book of Vile Darkness, and Book of Exalted

Deeds  present  a  wide  spectrum  of  new  rules  and  information,

in most cases without offering guidelines for incorporating that

material into a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign. This chapter, the

next  one,  and  the  appendix  of  this  book  expand  those  options

into  the  land  of  Faern,  presenting  Faern-speci c  rules  for

epic-level  play,  planar  adventuring,   psionics,  and  campaigning

with mature themes.

Epic Prestige Classes

This section offers epic progressions for all the ten-level prestige

classes in Chapter 2 of this book. Also presented here are two

epic prestige classes that are unavailable to characters below epic

levels. Each epic prestige class offers a list of bonus feats that

a character who progresses to epic levels may choose to  ll his

bonus feat slots. See the Dungeon Masters Guide and the Epic

Level  Handbook  for  descriptions  of  any  feats  not  detailed  in

this  book,  the  Players  Handbook,  or  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS

Campaign Setting.

Epic Eye of Horus-Re

The epic eye of Horus-Re is the embodiment of light and his deitys

devotion to battling evil.

An  epic  eye  of  Horus-Re  should  concentrate  on  his  ability  to

wreak havoc on undead and other evil creatures by focusing on epic

feats such as Positive Energy Aura, Chosen Weapon Specialization,

and Planar Turning. He is always happy to improve his spellcasting

as  well,  with  feats  such  as  Divine  Spell  Penetration,  Improved

Alignment-Based  Casting,  Bonus  Domain,  Spontaneous  Domain

127

Access, and feats that improve his use of metamagic. A good selec-

tion of defensive feats, such as Epic Devotion and Armor Skin, is

also useful.

The epic eye of Horus-Re should increase his Wisdom as much

as possible, though he also needs Charisma for turning undead.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic eye of Horus-Res caster level increases by 1 for

every level higher than 10th. His spells per day and spells known

do not increase after 10th level, unless the sum of the class levels

contributing to his caster level equals 20 or less.

Positive Energy Burst: The DC for this ability increases by 1 for

every two levels higher than 10th.

Bonus Feats: The epic eye of Horus-Re gains a bonus feat, selected

from the list below, for every two levels higher than 10th. He must

meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic Hammer of Moradin

The epic hammer of Moradin is a mighty champion of the dwarf

racethe very image of his deity on the battle eld.

An epic hammer of Moradin has a dual focus: He should improve

his spellcasting ability on a regular basis while also augmenting his

sheer  combat  prowess.  The  Chosen  Weapon  Specialization  feat

makes use of his religious devotion, while a whole array of combat

feats from Epic Weapon Focus to Overwhelming Critical can in-

crease  his  effectiveness  in  battle.  Divine  Spell  Penetration,  Epic

Devotion,  and  Improved  Alignment-Based  Casting  highlight  his

role as a champion of law and good. Armor Skin, Damage Reduc-

tion, Epic Endurance, and Epic Toughness suit the dwarven idiom

as well.

Strength,  Wisdom,  and  Constitution  are  all  important  to  the

epic hammer of Moradin, and not necessarily in that order. Better

attacks, better spells, better hit pointshe needs them all, so he

should try to increase these three abilities nearly evenly.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic hammer of Moradins caster level increases by 1

for every two levels higher than 10th. His spells per day and spells

known do not increase after 10th level unless the sum of the class

levels contributing to his caster level equals 20 or less.

Bonus Feats: The epic hammer of Moradin gains a bonus feat,

selected from the list below, for every two levels higher than 10th.

He must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic Hathran

As  far  as  outsiders  know,  there  are  no  hathrans  above  the  rank

of othlor among the Witches of Rashemen. But the outsiders are

wrong.  Those  few  hathrans  who  exceed  this  level  of  power  keep

their identities secret and often disappear from public view. They

may continue to work from behind the scenes, but more likely they

travel incognito to distant lands or planes of existence in search of

greater knowledge.

The  epic  hathran  has  perhaps  the  widest  array  of  bonus  feats

available to any class. Her choice of feats depends largely on her

spellcasting  preference  (arcane  or  divine).  Former  clerics  might

select Bonus Domain or Improved Alignment-Based Casting, while

hathrans who were once arcane spellcasters probably lean toward

improving their metamagic capabilities. Regardless of a hathrans

background, general feats such as Epic Spell Focus and Epic Spell

Penetration come in very handy, and she cant go wrong with Im-

proved Spell Capacity.

An epic hathran should focus on increasing the ability score that

controls her spellcasting, whether that is Intelligence, Wisdom, or

Charisma. Since hathrans are multiclass spellcasters, an occasional

bump  to  her  secondary  spellcasting  ability  score  is  a  reasonable

second choice.

Hit Die: d4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic hathrans caster level increases by 1 for every

level higher than 10th. Her spells per day and spells known do not

increase after 10th level.

Universal Spirit Magic: The epic hathran gains one additional use

per day of this ability for every three levels higher than 9th (four

times per day at 12th level,  ve times per day at 15th level, and six

times per day at 18th level).

Bonus Feats: The epic hathran gains a bonus feat, selected from

the list below, for every two levels higher than 10th. She must meet

any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic Hathran Bonus Feat List: Augmented Alchemy, Automatic

Quicken Spell, Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Bonus

Improved Metamagic further augments the incantatrixs prodi-

gious metamagic abilities, and its bene t stacks with that provided

by her class ability of the same name. Any of the epic metamagic

feats (such as Improved Heighten Spell) are also likely to come in

handy for her.

The epic incantatrix should focus her ability score increases on

the ability that controls her spellcasting (typically Intelligence

or Charisma). Beyond that, either Dexterity or Constitution is a

 ne choice.

Hit Die: d4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic incantatrixs caster level increases by 1 for every

level higher than 10th. Her spells per day and spells known do not

increase after 10th level unless the sum of the class levels contribut-

ing to her caster level equals 20 or less.

Instant  Metamagic  (Su):  The  incantatrix  gains  one  additional

use per day of her instant metamagic ability for every two levels

higher than 9th. Thus, she can use it three times per day at 11th

level, four times per day at 13th level,  ve times per day at 15th

level, six times per day at 17th level, and seven times per day at

19th level.

Bonus  Feats:  The  epic  incantatrix  gains  a  bonus  feat,  selected

from the list below, for every three levels higher than 10th. She

must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic  Incantatrix  Bonus  Feat  List:  Augmented  Alchemy,  Au-

Epic Justiciar of Tyr

A champion of law  rst and good second, the epic justiciar of Tyr

is very similar to the epic paladina champion of righteousness

and justice whose sword brings woe to the wicked.

The epic justiciar of Tyrs faith powers her combat prowess. Axi-

omatic Strike is the logical outgrowth of her smite anarchy ability,

and Great Smiting improves that ability as well. Chosen Weapon

Specialization is another good combat feat for the epic justiciar, and

both Epic Leadership and Legendary Commander suit this paragon

of justice well.

Charisma, Strength, and Wisdom are all good choices for ability

score increases.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic justiciar of Tyrs caster level increases by 1 for

every level higher than 10th. Her spells per day and spells known

do not increase after 10th level unless the sum of the class levels

contributing to her caster level equals 20 or less.

Smite Anarchy (Su): The epic justiciar of Tyr gains one additional

use per day of her smite anarchy ability for every  ve levels higher

than 10th. Thus, she can use it four times per day at 15th level and

 ve times per day at 20th level.

Bonus Feats: The epic justiciar of Tyr gains a bonus feat, selected

from the list below, for every three levels higher than 9th. She must

meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic Monk of the Long Death

Shrouded  in  an  aura  of  death,  the  epic  monk  of  the  long  death

has achieved a level of peace with the concept of death that most

mortals will never  nd.

Epic monks of the long death have most of the same options

available  to  them  as  standard  monks  do,  including  a  variety  of

ways to improve their unarmed combat ability, superior defenses,

and speed. Monks of the long death who come from different back-

grounds  should  consult  the  epic  paths  for  their  other  classes  for

more options.

A monk of the long death needs to keep improving most of

his ability scores. Since his death attack relies on his Intelligence

score, Charisma is the only ability score that he shouldnt care too

much about.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Death  Attack:  The  save  DC  for  this  ability  increases  by  1  for

Epic Morninglord of Lathander

Shining  with  the  rosy  light  of  dawn,  the  epic  morninglord  of

Lathander is a ray of hope in a dark and dangerous world.

Much like clerics, epic morninglords should concentrate on im-

proving their spellcasting, their turning ability, and their healing

talents. Because they are highly creative people, many epic mornin-

glords take Epic Skill Focus (Craft or Perform).

An  epic  morninglord  should  improve  her  Wisdom  for  spell-

casting and her Charisma for turning.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic morninglord of Lathanders caster level increases

by 1 for every level higher than 10th. Her spells per day and spells

Epic Runecaster

Epic runecasters are particularly common among the dwarves and

giants, who originated this form of magic. A runecaster of epic level

is likely a legend among his people, and the power of his runes is

beyond comparison.

The epic runecaster should pick up Inscribe Epic Rune (new feat;

see page 135) as soon as possible. Beyond that, any feat that makes

his spellcasting more powerful is a good choice, from Enhance Spell

to  Improved  Metamagic  to  Spell  Stowaway.  Epic  Toughness  is  a

good choice for epic runecasters who want to emulate their dwarf

or giant teachers. Players could also work with their DMs to create

rune-based epic feats that mimic metamagic feats.

If  the  epic  runecasters  divine  spellcasting  relies  on  Wisdom,

thats the best choice for his ability score increases. Constitution

is a solid second choice, since many runecasters take pride in their

physical toughness.

Hit Die: d8.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells: The epic runecasters divine caster level increases by 1 for

every level higher than 10th. His spells per day and spells known

do not increase after 10th level.

Rune Craft: The epic runecasters bonus on Craft checks made to

inscribe runes increases by 1 for every three levels higher than 10th

(to +4 at 13th level, +5 at 16th level, and +6 at 19th level).

Rune Power: For runes created by the runecaster, the save DC for

all attempts to erase, dispel, or disable the rune, and for caster level

checks made to overcome the spell resistance of a target, increases

by 1 for every three levels higher than 9th (to +4 at 12th level, +5

at 15th level, and +6 at 18th level).

Crafting Epic Runes: An epic runecaster cant create a rune with

a  spell  level  above  10th  or  an  effective  caster  level  above  20th

without using the Inscribe Epic Rune feat.

Bonus Feats: The epic runecaster gains a bonus feat, selected from

the list below, for every three levels higher than 10th. He must

meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

tomatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Bonus Domain, Chosen

Epic Shaaryan Hunter

The epic Shaaryan hunter is one with her mount. She is a rider,

tracker, and survivalist of unrivaled skill.

An epic Shaaryan hunter should focus on feats related to riding

and archery, which are her two greatest strengths. Legendary Rider

and Skill Focus (Ride) improve her riding ability and help her make

Ride checks at high DCs for tasks such as attacking while hanging

down  alongside  her  mount.  Combat  Archery,  Distant  Shot,  Im-

proved Manyshot, Swarm of Arrows, and Uncanny Accuracy all

improve her prowess with a bow.

The  Shaaryan  hunter  should  improve  her  Dexterity  regularly.

Constitution should be her second focus for ability score increases.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modi er.

Ride  Bonus:  The  epic  Shaaryan  hunters  competence  bonus  on

Ride checks increases by 2 for every three levels higher than 10th

Epic Shadow Adept

The bene ts of the Shadow Weave are as potent as they are tempt-

ing. A rare few who follow this path attain epic levels, and those

who know their names dare mention them only in whispersand

even then only in bright daylight.

As a spellcaster, an epic shadow adept should focus on gaining

feats that bolster his spellcasting power, such as the ever-popular

Improved Spell Capacity. Epic Spell Focus, particularly in enchant-

ment,  illusion,  or  necromancy,  also  serves  him  well.  Improved

Low-Light Vision boosts the epic shadow adepts visual acuity in

the shadowy conditions he loves.

An  epic  shadow  adept  who  is  satis ed  with  his  spellcasting

prowess might consider picking up feats that accentuate his other

abilities. If he has the prerequisites, Self-Concealment  ts in well

with the shadow adepts motif. Spectral Strike is another interest-

ing choice for shadow adepts who were clerics before embracing the

Shadow Weave.

As with any epic spellcaster, an epic shadow adept should im-

prove the ability score that controls his spellcasting. Other than

that, Dexterity is a good choice, particularly if he typically goes

without armor.

Hit Die: d4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modi er.

Spells:  The  epic  shadow  adepts  caster  level  increases  by  1  for

every level higher than 10th. His spells per day and spells known

do not increase after 10th level.

Shadow Defense: The epic shadow adepts profane bonus on saves

against spells from the schools of enchantment, illusion, and nec-

romancy, as well as spells with the darkness descriptor, increases by

1 for every three levels higher than 9th (to +4 at 12th level, +5 at

15th level, and +6 at 18th level).

Bonus Feats: The epic shadow adept gains a bonus feat (selected

from the list below) for every four levels higher than 10th. He must

meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it.

Epic Shadow Adept Bonus Feat List: Automatic Quicken Spell,

Automatic Silent Spell, Automatic Still Spell, Enhance Spell, Epic

Netherese Arcanist

The  archwizards  of  ancient  Netheril  were  arguably  the  greatest

human  spellcasters  in  all  of  Faerns  history,  though  the  elves

often point out that the Netherese learned all they knew from elf

wizards.  But  even  so,  the  spellcasters  of  Netheril  were  renowned

for the mighty magic under their controlspells that could shear

the tops from mountains and levitate them in the air to serve as

 oating enclaves. Some say that these archwizards even had access

to a spell that could make a man into a god.

The Netherese arcanist is a pioneer of epic spellcasting who fo-

cuses his efforts on mastering the secrets of spells that go beyond

ordinary  limits.  Most  members  of  this  prestige  class  died  when

their  oating enclaves plummeted from the sky and their mighty

empire crumbled into the desert of Anauroch, though at least one

still survives as a lich. But two means remain by which modern-

day wizards and sorcerers can approach the techniques of ancient

Netheril. They can explore lost Netherese ruins and  nd records

of the arcanists forgotten secrets, or they can visit the living heirs

of  those  powerful  spellcastersthe  shades.  Among  the  shades,

Netherese arcanists are once again rising to a level of prominence

in society, to the great concern of their neighbors.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a Netherese arcanist, a character must ful ll

all the following criteria.

Race: Human (including human undead) or shade.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 25 ranks, Spellcraft 25 ranks.

Feats: Improved Metamagic, Improved Spellcasting.

Spells: Able to cast 13th-level arcane spells.

Special: Traditions of Netheril: The candidate must have access

to  the  ancient  magical  traditions  of  Netheril.  A  lich  or  a  shade

character from the Empire of Shade meets this criterion, or (at

the DMs discretion) another character who has unearthed ancient

Netherese lore might also qualify.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class

features  of  the  Netherese

arcanist.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:

Netherese  arcanists  gain  no  pro -

ciency  with  any  weapon,  armor,  or

shield.  Armor  check  penalties  for

armor  heavier  than  leather  apply  to

the  skills  Balance,  Climb,  Escape

Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move

Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,

and Tumble, and double the

normal armor check penalty

applies to Swim checks.

Epic  Spellcasting:  At  1st

level,  the  Netherese  arcanist

gains Epic Spellcasting as a bonus

feat if he does not already have it.

Netherese arcanist

Field  Specialization:  Every  Netherese  arcanist  chooses

one  of  three   elds  of  magicinvention,  mentalism,  or  varia-

tionfor his major  eld of specialization. He also chooses one of

the remaining two  elds as his minor  eld. He cannot cast spells

based on seeds from the third  eld.

The epic spell seeds covered by each  eld are given in the table

below.

Field8Seeds

Invention  af ict, armor, conjure, destroy, energy, slay, summon

Mentalism  banish, compel, conceal, contact, delude, foresee, reveal

Variation

form, transport, ward

133

The base Spellcraft DC for developing spells in the arcanists major

 eld of specialization is reduced by 5, as though it were within the

casters specialist school. If it already is within the casters specialist

school, there is no additional bene t.

Spell Focus (Epic): At 2nd level, the saving throw DC for each of

a Netherese arcanists epic spells increases by 1, but the Spellcraft

DC does not increase.

Backlash Resistance (Su): At 3rd level, a Netherese arcanist gains

resistance 5 to backlash damage from casting epic spells. Each time

he casts an epic spell with a backlash, that damage is reduced by 5

points. If the backlash damage continues for more

than  1  round,  the  reduction  is  5  points  each

round.

Epic  Spell  Artisan:  At  4th  level,  a

Netherese  arcanist  gains  the  ability  to

develop  epic  spells  with  less  expense  in

time  and  resources.  When  determining

the cost of raw materials for researching

an epic spell, he multiplies the Spellcraft

DC  by  7,000  gp  instead  of  the  usual

9,000  gp  and  reduces  the  development

time and XP cost accordingly.

Greater  Spell  Focus  (Epic):

At 5th level, the saving throw

DC  for  each  of  a  Netherese

arcanists  epic  spells  increases

by  1,  but  the  Spellcraft  DC

does  not  increase.  This  increase

stacks with that provided by his Spell

Focus  (epic)  ability,  for  a  net  in-

crease of +2.

Spell re

Herophant

While  many  characters  may

call  themselves  master  of

spell rethe  raw  energy  of

the Weavesuch individuals are

mere students compared to the spell re hierophant. This master of

the Weave learns new methods of controlling and shaping spell re

that lesser mortals barely comprehend.

A spell re hierophant can come from almost any background,

though most have some previous training in the use of spell re.

The spell re channeler prestige class (see Magic of Faern) provides

the lions share of the candidates for this prestige class; otherwise,

spellcasters have the easiest time qualifying.

Considering  the  generally  solitary  nature  of  spell re  wielders,

its no surprise that spell re hierophants tend to exist outside of

normal  society.  Those  few  who  venture  from  their  hidden  lairs

in the wilderness or on other planes usually rely on disguises and

subterfuge to accomplish their goals.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the spell re hierophant

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro ciency:  Spell re  hierophants  gain  no

pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check pen-

alties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand,

and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to

Swim checks.

Greater  Charged  Item  Drain  (Sp):  A  spell re  hierophant  can

drain a number of charges from a touched charged item (includ-

ing  single-use  items  such  as  potions  or  scrolls)  and  convert  that

energy into stored spell re energy levels. She can drain a number

of charges equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1), but she cant

drain more charges than the item has remaining. (Each spell on a

scroll counts as 1 charge.) A fully drained item has no magical prop-

ertiesa potion becomes water, and a scroll becomes blank paper.

A creature holding or carrying such an item may attempt a Will

save (DC 20 + 1/2 spell re hierophant level + spell re hierophants

Cha modi er) to prevent the item from being drained.

Ranged Healing (Su): At 2nd level, the spell re hierophant can

release stored spell re energy levels to heal at a range of up to 25

feet + 5 feet per two caster levels. Using this ability requires a suc-

cessful ranged touch attack. The amount of healing is normal for

the character (either 2 points per spell re energy level expended,

or 1d4+1 points per spell re energy level expended if the character

has the improved healing class feature of the spell re channeler).

Haste (Su): Once per day, a spell re hierophant of 3rd level or

higher can expend spell re energy levels to accelerate her actions,

just as if she had cast haste on herself. She must decide how many

levels to spend upon activation of the ability. Each spell re energy

level she spends allows her to function as though affected by a haste

spell for 1 round, and she sparkles with light while this ability is in

effect. The spell re hierophant can use this ability twice per day at

6th level and three times per day at 9th level.

Bonus  Feats:  At  4th  level  and  again  at  8th  level,  the  spell re

hierophant  gains  a  bonus  feat  selected  from  the  following  list:

Energy  Resistance,  Epic  Skill  Focus  (Concentration),  Epic  Spell-

 re  Wielder**,  Epic  Toughness,  Epic  Weapon  Focus  (spell re),

Exceptional De ection*, Fast Healing, In nite De ection*, Re ect

Arrows*. She must meet all of a feats prerequisites in order to select

it, except as noted below.

The  spell re  hierophant  can  ignore  the  prerequisite  of  Im-

proved Unarmed Strike for these feats.

*New epic feat; see page 135.

Greater Permanent Item Drain (Sp): At 5th level, a spell re hi-

erophant can drain power from permanent magic items by touch as

a standard action. An item that creates a spell effect (such as boots

of speed) loses that function for 24 hours, and the spell re hiero-

phant gains spell re energy levels equal to the items caster level.

A creature holding or carrying such an item may attempt a Will

save (DC 20 + 1/2 spell re hierophant level + spell re hierophants

Cha modi er) to prevent the item from being drained. If all of an

items permanent abilities are drained, it is still a magic item for

the purpose of making saving throws when damaged, and so on.

Spell re  Reserve  (Ex):  At  7th  level,  the  spell re  hierophant

learns how to store spell re energy levels in deep reserve. These

energy levels dont count as part of her normal storage capacity,

calling them out of reserve. Spell re energy levels in reserve dont

detect  as  magical,  so  a  spell re  hierophants  true  nature  cannot

be  determined  by  detecting  them.  Placing  any  number  of  stored

her spell re hierophant level plus her Constitution bonus (if any)

Spell re Burst (Su): At 10th level, the spell re hierophant can

substitute a spell re burst for a normal spell re blast. The range

remains the same, but instead of requiring a touch attack, the spell-

 re  energy  explodes  in  a  5-foot-radius  burst  at  the  target  point,

dealing appropriate damage to all creatures in the area. Each af-

fected creature may attempt a Re ex save (DC 20 + 1/2 spell re

as she would normally  re in a round, but she can use the ability

for only 1 round per day. For every 5 levels gained thereafter, the

spell re hierophant can use this ability for 1 additional round per

day (2 rounds at 15th, 3 rounds at 20th, and so on).

If the character also has the maelstrom of  re class feature of

the spell re channeler, the area of the burst is a 10-foot radius.

the Epic Level Handbook, including the unstated prerequisite that

a character must be at least 21st level to take an epic feat.

center of effect) as if you were casting the spell yourself, even if

you cant normally cast that spell. For example, you can change the

radius of a ring-shaped wall of  re, but you cannot change its point

of origin.

You can substitute your own caster level for the spells original

caster level if you choose. You can also shape the effect as you desire

within the parameters of the spell. As with the metamagic effect

ability, you must be adjacent to or within the spell effect and make

a Spellcraft checkin this case against a DC equal to 30 + (3  the

spells level).

You can use this ability and your metamagic effect ability a total

number of times per day equal to 5 + your Intelligence modi er.

Like metamagic effect, using this ability is a full-round action that

provokes attacks of opportunity.

Axiomatic Strike [Epic]

Your attacks deal incredible damage to chaotic creatures.

Prerequisites: Smite anarchy class feature, any lawful alignment.

Bene t: Any weapon you wield is treated as an axiomatic weapon

(lawful-aligned,  deals  an  extra  2d6  points  of  damage  against

creatures  of  chaotic  alignment).  If  the  weapon  already  has  an

alignment, this feat has no effect on it.

Chosen Weapon

Specialization [Epic]

You  deal  more  damage  than  normal  when  wielding  your  deitys

chosen weapon.

Prerequisites:  War  domain,  Epic  Prowess,  Weapon  Focus  with

deitys chosen weapon.

Bene ts:  You  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  weapon  damage  rolls  when

wielding your deitys chosen weapon.

Divine Spell Penetration [Epic]

Choose one component of your alignment (chaotic, evil, good, or

lawful). Any divine spells of that alignment that you cast are more

capable of defeating spell resistance than normal.

Prerequisites:  Wis  21,  Improved  Alignment-Based  Casting,

domain of chosen alignment, alignment matching chosen compo-

nent, ability to cast 9th-level divine spells.

Bene ts: When casting spells of the chosen alignment, you gain a

+4 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance.

Enhance Effect [Epic]

You can change the characteristics of a persistent spell effect that

is already in place.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 30 ranks, Spellcraft 30 ranks,

Skill Focus (Spellcraft), metamagic effect class ability.

Bene t: You can change any variables of a persistent spell effect

that  is  already  in  place  (except  its  point  of  origin  or  the  spells

Epic Counterspell [Epic]

You can counterspell any number of spells each round.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 30 ranks, Combat Re exes, Improved

Counterspell,  Improved  Initiative,  Quicken  Spell,  Reactive

Counter spell.

Bene t: Any number of times per round, you can counterspell

an opponents spell even if you have not readied an action to do so.

Such a counterspell doesnt count against your later actions for the

round. You can even use this feat when  at-footed.

Normal: Without this feat, a character must ready an action in

each round that she wishes to use a counterspell. A character with

the Reactive Counterspell feat can counterspell an opponents spell

if she hasnt readied an action, but only once per turn and not when

 at-footed.

Special: This feat should be considered part of the epic bonus feat

list for any class that grants access to spells of at least 6th level as

part of normal (nonepic) class progression (such as bards, clerics,

druids, sorcerers, and wizards), as well as for any prestige class that

grants a +1 level of existing class spell progression at all levels.

Epic Devotion [Epic]

Choose  an  alignment  component  (chaotic,  evil,  good,  or  lawful)

that you do not possess. You are particularly resistant to spells with

that descriptor.

Prerequisites: Wis 21, Iron Will, alignment different from the

chosen component, patron deity who does not accept clerics with

the chosen component.

Bene t: You gain a +4 divine bonus on saves against spells of the

chosen alignment component. For instance, a lawful good paladin

of Helm who selected chaos would gain a +4 divine bonus on saves

against  chaotic  spells.  That  paladin  could  not  select  good  or  law

because  they  are  part  of  her  own  alignment.  She  also  could  not

select evil because Helm accepts evil clerics.

Special: You can take Epic Devotion more than once. Each time

you take the feat, you must select a new alignment component.

Epic Spell re Wielder [Epic]

Your can store more spell re energy levels than normal.

Prerequisites:  Concentration  20  ranks,  Endurance,  Spell re

Wielder.

Bene t:  For  the  purpose  of  determining  your  limit  of  stored

spell re energy levels, treat your Constitution score as if it were 4

points higher than it is.

Normal: Without this feat, a spell re wielders limit of stored

spell re energy levels is equal to her Constitution score.

Special:  You  can  select  Epic  Spell re  Wielder  multiple  times.

Each time you take this feat, your limit of stored spell re energy

levels increases by 4.

Improved Cooperative

Metamagic [Epic]

Your ability to enhance an allys spell during casting is expanded.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 30 ranks, Silent Spell, Still Spell, Quicken

Spell, cooperative metamagic class feature.

Bene t: You can use your cooperative metamagic ability to apply

the Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell feats to your allys spell.

If you apply the Quicken Spell feat to the spell, both your action

and the casters are free actions. You must still ready an action to

use this ability when your ally begins casting, but you can ready a

different standard action as well.

In addition, you can use your cooperative metamagic ability an

extra two times per day.

Normal: Without this feat, a character cannot use cooperative

metamagic to apply the Silent Spell, Still Spell, or Quicken Spell

feats to an allys spell.

Improved Snatch Spell [Epic]

When you take over a spell from another spellcaster, you gain more

control over its effect.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 40 ranks, Spellcraft 40 ranks,

Epic Skill Focus (Spellcraft), snatch spell class ability.

Bene t: When you use your seize concentration or snatch spell

ability, you can enhance and control the spells effect as though you

had cast it yourself. You can substitute your own caster level for

the original caster level if you wish, and you can change any other

variables determined by the original caster.

Improved Spellpool Access [Epic]

You  can  use  your  spellpool  access  to  call  spells  of  greater  than

normal power.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 30 ranks, Spellcraft 30 ranks,

ability to call spells from a spellpool.

Bene t: The chance of a desired spell being available in the spell-

pool in any given 24-hour period is equal to 90% minus 5% per

spell level (minimum 5% for spells of 17th level or higher).

Normal: The chance of a spell being available is equal to 65%

minus 5% per spell level (minimum 5% for spells of 12th level or

higher).

Special: This feat should be considered part of the epic bonus feat

list for any class that grants its members spellpool access.

Inscribe Epic Rune [Epic]

You can inscribe runes of epic power.

Prerequisites: Int 19, Craft (any appropriate for runecasting) 24

ranks, Inscribe Rune.

Bene t: You can inscribe runes that exceed the normal limits (see

Runcaster prestige class). For instance, you could inscribe a rune

with a spell greater than 9th level, or a rune with a caster level

greater than 20th.

Even this feat does not allow you to inscribe a rune with an epic

spell (see Chapter 2: Epic Spells in the Epic Level Handbook). Such

magic  de es  the  power  of  the  written  word  and  thus  cannot  be

scribed into runic form.

New Epic Spells

These new epic spells include some of the vast and powerful reper-

toire of the archmages of Netheril and the high mages of the elves.

A few spells that are more generally useful for epic spellcasters in

Faern are included as well.

As indicated in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting, the planar cosmology that includes the

world of Toril is different and separate from the

standard D&D cosmology described in the Dungeon Masters Guide

and Manual of the Planes. While the D&D cosmology is easily

compared to a great wheel, Torils planes are arranged more like a

tree with many branches.

The Material Plane, the Plane of Shadow, and the Ethereal Plane,

which are coexistent with each other, form the trunk of this tree.

Its branches are the Inner Planes (the elemental and energy planes)

and the Outer Planes. Almost every outer-planar branch has smaller

branches of its own, which are the divine realms of the deities dwell-

ing there. These realms are almost like distinct demiplanes.

In the D&D cosmology, the Astral Plane surrounds all the other

planes in a shapeless cloud, allowing astral travel directly from one

plane to any other. But Torils Astral Plane shares the treelike shape

of the cosmology as a whole. Because of this arrangement, it is dif-

 cult (though not completely impossible) to jump from branch to

branch of the treethat is, to cross directly from one Inner Plane

or  Outer  Plane  to  another.  (See  Traveling  the  Planes,  below,  for

more  information.)  It  is  more  naturaland  far  saferto  travel

between  the  Inner  Planes  or  Outer  Planes  by  way  of  the  trunk

(the Material Plane). As part of its ability to alter the nature of

its realm, a deity can forge a direct connection to any other deitys

realm, so long as both deities agree. Apart from divine in uence,

however, such direct connections are impossible.

Three of the planes in Torils cosmology stand out as unusual:

the Abyss, the Nine Hells, and Blood Rift. None of these planes

are home to any deities (although some refer to the arch ends who

reside there as deities, or at least near-deities), and the three planes

are coterminous to each other. In effect, these  endish planes form

one unusual branch of the planar cosmologythe site of an eternal

war raging between the native creatures of the Nine Hells and the

Abyss, namely devils and demons, respectively. The yugoloth natives

of Blood Rift serve as mercenaries in the eternal war while pursuing

their own mysterious ends.

139

The  Dungeon  Masters  Guide  provides  enough  information

about planar travel to allow you to use this section in a FORGOTTEN

REALMS campaign. Manual of the Planes, however, includes con-

siderable plane-related material, from spells and prestige classes to

monsters, that can enhance adventures among the planes of Toril.

This chapter provides additional Toril-related information that will

aid you in using the material from Manual of the Planes.

Traveling the Planes

Torils  unique  Astral  Plane  makes  planar  travel  simultaneously

simpler  and  more  complicated.  Getting  from  the  Material  Plane

to another plane is simple enough, and the process works exactly

the way it does in the standard D&D cosmology. A character need

only cast the appropriate spell (plane shift or astral projection) to

get onto the Astral Plane, follow it to a color pool leading to the

desired plane, then pass through that pool to the destination plane.

The  only  difference  is  that  once  a  character  heads  out  toward  a

given plane, only color pools leading to that one plane appear on

her  path.  This  effect  is  similar  to  a  channeled  Astral  Plane,  as

described in Manual of the Planes. Once a character has set out

toward  a  certain  plane,  she  cannot  change  her  mind,  backtrack,

and then set out toward a different one. To alter her course, she

must actually reenter the Material Plane, then set out astrally for

a different plane.

Travel from one Outer Plane to another is slightly more com-

plicated.  Normal  astral  travel  cannot  take  a  character  directly

from one plane to another except by way of the Material Plane.

A character or monster can use plane shift to move directly from

the Material Plane to any other plane or vice versa, but not from

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   139

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

one Inner Plane or Outer Plane to a different Inner Plane or Outer

Plane.

As  described  in  Manual  of  the  Planes,  the  Plane  of  Shadow

constitutes the primary link between Torils planar cosmology and

those of other worlds. The Plane of Shadow connects Torils Mate-

rial Plane with those of other worlds, including the default world

for the D&D core booksthe World of Greyhawk. Naturally, in

a land as full of magical portals as Faern is, unusual portals that

connect to other Material Planes via conduits through the Plane of

Shadow almost certainly exist. Some sages point to such connections

as the source of spells named after the great wizards of Greyhawk,

such as Ottos irresistible dance, Otilukes freezing sphere, Tensers

transformation, and the various Bigbys hand spells.

Cross-Planar Features

Certain planar features actually cross from one plane to another,

forming a connection that de es the treelike structure of the Astral

Plane.  Ironically,  one  of  these  features  is  a  treethe  so-called

World  Tree  that  connects  all  the  celestial  planes.  The  other  is  a

riverthe River of Blood, which  ows among most of the  endish

planes. This waterway is similar to the River Styx, as described in

Manual of the Planes.

THE WORLD TREE

This cosmic tree connects many celestial branches of the astral

tree. From its roots in Arvandor and Dwarfhome, the World Tree

rises through all the celestial planes to the very Gates of the Moon.

Brightwater, Golden Hills, and the House of Knowledge are con-

nected  to  the  World  Trees  trunk,  while  its  lower-lying  branches

extend into Dweomerheart, the House of the Triad, and Green Fields.

Brave planar travelers can use the World Tree to travel among the

celestial planes without passing through the Material Plane, as the

angel servitors of good deities are thought to do. But this path is dan-

gerous, since the tree is sentient and apparently dislikes being used as

a planar ladder. Would-be travelers have encountered celestial treants

and dryads bent on blocking their path, but even these guardians

have been known to let travelers pass for good reasons.

THE RIVER OF BLOOD

A vast and fetid river  ows through most of the  endish planes,

providing  a  connection  similar  to  the  one  that  the  World  Tree

provides for the celestial planes. Its spring is said to lie somewhere

in the Abyss, and it  ows most strongly through that plane, Blood

Rift,  and  the  Nine  Hells.  It  also  winds  through  the  Barrens  of

Doom  and  Despair,  Clangor,  Furys  Heart,  Hammergrim,  and

Nishrek before spilling into the murky waters of Fated Depths. Of

the  endish planes, only the Supreme Throne and the Demonweb

Pits are untouched by the River of Blood. As with the World Tree,

canny travelers can use the River of Blood to get from one  end-

ish plane to another, but the dangers are great. All sorts of  ends

swim in the river or lurk near its banks in hopes of snaring unwary

travelers,  and  some  even  pilot  small  craft  on  the  rivers  viscous

surface. Any mortal who falls into or swims in the River of Blood

loses all memory.

primarily by alignment, Torils Outer Planes are identi ed solely

by the deities who call them home. Each plane is the demesne of a

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

deity. A planes alignment traits, if any, derive from the deities who

live there, and not the other way around.

In addition to the types of planar traits detailed in the Dungeon

Masters Guide, nearly every plane in Torils cosmology has a faith

trait, often in place of an alignment trait. On a plane with a mild

faith trait, any visitor who does not claim one of the deities that

lives on the plane as her patron takes a 2 penalty on all Charisma-

based checks. On a plane with a strong faith trait, the same penalty

applies. Furthermore, a character who worships a deity opposed to

the residents of the plane (as speci ed in the planes description)

takes the same penalty on Intelligence- and Wisdom-based checks

as well.

Plane Descriptions

This  section  provides  a  brief  description  of  each  plane  in  Torils

cosmology, including its planar traits (as described in the Dungeon

Masters Guide) and a list of creatures from the Monster Manual,

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, and Monsters of Faern

that are native to that plane. A few monsters from other sources are

included in some entries as well. These are noted separately from

the other monsters in their own paragraphs.

Torils Ethereal Plane and its Inner Planes are identical to those

detailed in the Dungeon Masters Guide, so they do not have entries

here. Likewise, the Astral Plane differs primarily in its shape, as

described  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter.  The  only  functional

difference between the Astral Plane as described in the Dungeon

Masters Guide and the one in the Toril cosmology is that direct

travel from one plane to another without passing through the Ma-

terial Plane is not possible in the latter version.

The elemental lords Grumbar, Akadi, Istishia, and Kossuth have

realms on the elemental planes.

The Abyss

The  Abyss  features  an  endless  variety  of  evillayer  upon  layer,

world upon world in which the very air, earth, and water reek of

toxic corruption. The home of Torils demons is as varied as the

demons  themselves,  with  each  layer  offering  a  unique  landscape

apparently designed to in ict as much pain and torment as possible

on those who pass through it.

Unlike most of Torils planes, the Abyss is not a single common

area  with  divine  realms  branching  from  it.  Rather,  it  is  an  ap-

parently  in nite  number  of  layers,  each  with  its  own  unique

characteristics. No central trunk or neutral area connects these

realms.  Travelers  might  enter  any  layer  of  the  Abyss,  and  they

might encounter portals there to any of the other layers. Each layer

is coterminous to some number of others, but these relationships

seem  to  change  continually,  like  a  mass  of  bubbles  settling  and

shifting around each other. The only constant in this chaotic jumble

is the presence of the adjacent Blood Rift, where the demons  ght

their mortal enemies, the devils.

The proximity of Blood Rift to both the Abyss and the Nine

Hells allows the demons to make unceasing war upon the devils.

While  Blood  Rift  always  touches  a  particular  layer  of  the  Nine

Hells (the  rst layer, called Avernus), the ever-shifting nature of

the Abyss brings different layers into proximity with Blood Rift at

different times, allowing the demons to bring new forces to bear

constantly in the so-called Blood War.

The Abyss has the following traits.

ABYSS TRAITS

?Normal gravity. Some layers of the Abyss feature different grav-

ity traits.

?Alterable morphic.

?Mixed elemental and energy traits. These traits vary widely from

layer to layer. In the Abyss as a whole, no one element or type of

energy constantly dominates, though a given layer may have a

dominant element or energy, or a mixture of two or more.

?Mildly chaos-aligned and mildly evil-aligned.

ABYSS LINKS

Various layers of the Abyss include portals to the Demonweb Pits,

Beshabas realm in the Barrens of Doom and Despair, Hruggeks

realm in Clangor, the realm of Urdlen in Hammergrim, and the

Fugue Plane. In addition,  portals frequently open to connect the

Abyss  with  Deep  Caverns  and  Fated  Depths.  The  spring  of  the

River of Blood is said to lie somewhere in the Abyss, and tributaries

 ow from many Abyssal layers to feed its putrid waters. The River

of Blood links the Abyss to most other  endish planes.

ABYSS INHABITANTS

First  and  foremost,  the  Abyss  is  the  home  of  the  demons.  Any

demon from the Monster Manual or any other source dwells in the

Abyss. Other denizens of the Abyss detailed in the Monster Manual

include bodaks, night hags, and nightmares.

Fiend  Folio:  Abrian,  Abyssal  ghoul,  bloodthorn,  demon esh

golem, ironmaw, living holocaust, Abyssal ant swarm, blood end

locust swarm, varrangoins (all), vorr, vultivor (canomorph).

Abyssal  Petitioners:  When  demons  steal  souls  from  the  Fugue

Plane and bring them to the Abyss, those souls become petitioners

called manes. A mane has pale white skin, cruel claws, sharp teeth,

sparse hair, and white eyes. Often, maggots visibly squirm through

its bloated  esh. Manes that survive for many years are sometimes

promoted to lesser demon types, though they retain no memory

of their former lives. Manes have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, poison.

Resistances: Acid 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Acidic vapor, no planar commitment.

Acidic Vapor (Su): When a mane is slain, it discorporates into

a cloud of noxious vapor. Every creature within 10 feet of a slain

mane must make a successful DC 20 Re ex save or take 1d6 points

of acid damage.

No  Planar  Commitment  (Ex):  Unlike  most  other  petitioners,

manes can leave the plane they call home.

FEATURES OF THE ABYSS

Use the Random Abyssal Layers table on page 161 of the  Dungeon

Masters  Guide  to  generate  the  characteristics  of  any  Abyssal

layer.

The Abyss has no divine realms, and no true deities make their

homes there. However, a great many demon princesprobably as

many as there are layers of the Abyssvie for power and territory

on  this  plane.  Prominent  demon  princes  include  Demogorgon,

Eltab, Yeenoghu, Orcus, Grazzt, Baphomet, and Kostchtchie, most

of whom are described in Book of Vile Darkness.

Arvandor

The home of the Seldarine (the elven pantheon) is a place of lush

natural  beautyverdant  forests,  towering  mountains,  crystal

streams,  azure  lakes,  and  a  deep  green  sea.  Each  of  the  various

deities of the elven pantheon has its own realm within this scenic

landscape, but these dei c realms  ow seamlessly into one another,

with no clearly de ned borders and no barriers.

ARVANDOR TRAITS

Arvandor has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly good-aligned and mildly chaos-aligned.

?Mild faith (elven pantheon and Eilistraee). Eilistraees realm has

the strong faith trait, so followers of the other deities from the

drow pantheon take greater penalties there.

ARVANDOR LINKS

Hanali Celanil maintains a portal to Sunes realm in Brightwater,

and Erevan Ilesere maintains one that leads to the realm of Hlal

in Dragon Eyrie. A portal to the House of Nature, maintained by

the whole pantheon, stands at the shore of the Sparkling Sea. The

eladrins have a portal to the Gates of the Moon as well.

ARVANDOR INHABITANTS

The celestial realms of Arvandor and the Gates of the Moon are

the only two planes where the el ike eladrins dwell in signi cant

numbers. The eladrins of Arvandor are not servants of the elven

pantheon, though they respect the elf deities and generally cooper-

ate with them in everyday matters as well as urgent ones. But when

the elf deities require powerful servants to travel to other planes,

they usually call upon angels rather than eladrins, so all varieties

of angels dwell here as well.

Arvandor Petitioners: The petitioners of Arvandoreven those

few who were not elves in their mortal livesall appear as hand-

some elves here. These petitioners have even more of a fey look

about  them  than  elves  from  the  Material  Plane  do,  since  their

elven  features  are  slightly  exaggerated.  These  petitioners  spend

their  days  feasting  on  Arvandors  bounty  and  communing  with

its unblemished nature. Arvandors petitioners have the following

special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, poison.

Resistances: Cold 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Damage reduction 5/cold iron, elf traits

(as described in the Monster Manual).

FEATURES OF ARVANDOR

Arvandor is a vast, apparently in nite expanse of pristine wilder-

ness stretching from a boundless ocean to a range of snow-capped

mountains. While each deity of the elven pantheon has carved out

a personal realm from this wilderness, most of the plane is actu-

ally held in common by the pantheon as a whole and shared with

the eladrins.

Aerdrie Faenya: This goddesss realm, called the Aerie, is a glit-

tering palace of clouds  oating high in the otherwise crystal-clear

skies above the forests and mountains of Arvandor. Celestial eagles

and rocs share this realm with elf and avariel petitioners, celestial

elves, and angels.

Corellon Larethian/Sehanine Moonbow: Metaphorically if not lit-

erally at the center of Arvandor is the great palace called Crescent

Grove, the home of Corellon Larethian and Sehanine Moonbow.

A perfect union of nature and artistry, Crescent Grove unites white

marble pillars and walkways with towering, white-barked trees. A

tall tower at its heart, called the Overlook, offers a breathtaking

view of the whole plane. The planes residents come to Corellons

palace when they want to be alone in quiet contemplation. Here

visitors can take in the majesty of the view from the Overlook, walk

among the pillars and trees, or simply bask in the re ected glory of

Corellons and Sehanines presence here.

Deep  Sashelas:  The  Dolphin  Prince  lives  in  the  shallow  green

ocean  of  Arvandor,  which  is  called  the  Sparkling  Sea.  Celestial

dolphins and whales, great schools of  sh, and tritons swim along-

side the sea elf petitioners of this plane. Deep Sashelas dwells in a

palace built of coral, gold, and veined marble. Called Elavandor,

this magni cent edi ce is located at the bottom of a chasm in the

Sparkling Sea.

Eilistraee:  Eilistraee  makes  her  home  in  Arvandor  with  her

cousins of the Seldarine. Her realm here is small, since some of

her divine energy is bound up with her near-abandoned realm in

the Demonweb Pits. Within the borders of Eilistraees realm, it

is always night, and a full moon shines brightly in the midnight-

blue sky.

Erevan  Ilesere:  One  of  the  vast  roots  of  the  World  Tree  lies

in  Arvandor,  stretching  up  from  its  fertile  soil  to  link  with  the

celestial planes in its great trunk. A community of celestial elves

lives near the great root in a village called the Gnarl. Near this

village, Erevan Ilesere maintains a sprawling, shifting palace made

of wood, stone, crystal, and a variety of other natural materials.

But the god rarely visits his own realm, preferring instead to wander

the planes making mischief and playing pranks. His palace is well

guarded in his absence by perhaps the greatest collection of traps

and tricks anywhere on the planes.

Fenmarel Mestarine/Shevarash: Nestled in the rough mountains

of Arvandor is Fennimar, the realm of the Lone Wolf. This quiet

glade of deserted woods, quiet valleys, and clear streams is a perfect

place for those who seek solitude and refuge. Hermits and celestial

animals, plus a small contingent of rangers who serve Fenmarel,

are the only inhabitants of the realm aside from its divine ruler.

143

12/19/03, 2:50:21 PM

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

The god Shevarash, who has no established realm of his own, often

stays here in solitude as well.

Hanali  Celanil:  At  the  center  of  a  lake  called  Evergold  stands

Hanali  Celanils  Crystal  Palace,  a  beautiful  structure  of  perfect

design and  awless material. A single candle placed properly within

the  palace  can  illuminate  the  entire  structure.  The  heart  of  the

Crystal Palace is a fountain, also called Evergold, which is said to be

the source of youth and beauty. This fountain actually exists on two

planes simultaneouslyhere and in Sunes domain on Brightwater.

By virtue of its dual-planar existence, the fountain acts as a portal

between the two realms, though usually only Hanali Celanil, Sune,

Sharess, and their servants can use it.

Labelas Enoreth: One of Arvandors more mysterious features is

the Vanishing Tower, which is said to be the realm of Labelas Enor-

eth. Most of the time, the tower cannot be seenperhaps it is simply

invisible, but more likely it exists in some demiplane or pocket di-

mension. When it manifests, it can appear anywhere in Arvandor

except within another deitys realm. Its arrival is often considered

an omen of portentous events, if not a harbinger of trouble.

Rillifane  Rallathil:  Among  the  wild  woods  of  Arvandor  is  a

stand of enormous and ancient oak trees called Oak Grove. This

is the realm of Rillifane Rallathil, though no structure or mark-

ing indicates its borders. The god of the wood elves dwells in total

harmony with the oaks, imposing no craft of any sort on their

natural perfection.

Solonor Thelandira: In the thickest part of Arvandors woods,

a magni cent white tree with silver leaves towers above even the

surrounding redwoods. The Pale Tree, as it is called, is the realm

of Solonor Thelandira, though he travels widely and never stays

long in his home. Platforms and ropes have been built unobtru-

sively  among  the  branches  of  the  Pale  Tree  to  provide  homes

for the petitioners and others who choose to dwell in the Great

Archers realm.

The Barrens of

Doom and Despair

On  a  plane  such  as  the  Abyss,  the  environment  itself  seems  to

conspire against life. The Barrens of Doom and Despair are not

so much hostile as simply inhospitablethe place is so bleak that

life could never thrive there. The plane consists of vast expanses

of black sand, great plains of featureless granite, and bleak can-

yons ringed by sheer cliffs of knife-sharp obsidian. Except for the

River of Blood, no water even trickles through its wastes, and no

sun shines despite the oppressive heat. No plants grow, and noth-

ing wholesome lives here. Black clouds cloak a glowering red sky,

swathing the land in darkness.

BARRENS OF DOOM AND DESPAIR TRAITS

The Barrens of Doom and Despair have the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly evil-aligned.

?Mild faith.

BARRENS OF DOOM AND DESPAIR LINKS

Portals connect the Barrens of Doom and Despair with Hammer-

grim, allowing the achaierai to raid that plane periodically. Blood

Rift regularly intersects with the Barrens of Doom and Despair,

periodically allowing the Blood War of the demons and devils to

spill out into its wastes. The demons and devils dont seem to mind

the wasteland of the Barrens, and many of them remain here even

after the war has moved on. The deities of the Barrens, for their

part, seem to  nd some amusement in the Blood War and its par-

ticipants,  so  they  leave  the  combatants  alone  unless  their  battle

strays too near. The divine realms are scattered widely across the

Barrens, leaving plenty of empty space for the  ends to explore.

The River of Blood  ows through the Barrens of Doom and De-

spair, providing one of its only notable landmarks. Travelers who use

this waterway to reach other  endish planes are in for a very long

journey because its brackish waters  ow slowly, wind across a nearly

in nite distance, and are inhabited by many dangerous creatures.

Beshabas Realm, the Blood Tor, contains a permanent portal to

the Abyss.

BARRENS OF DOOM AND DESPAIR INHABITANTS

As be ts the name, the Barrens of Doom and Despair are home to

some of the most loathsome creatures in the planes. In addition to

demons, devils, and yugoloths  eeing the Blood War (and punish-

ment for their cowardice), creatures such as achaierai, hell hounds,

and hellwasp swarms dwell in the wasteland of the Barrens.

Monster Manual II: Bladeling, vaporighu.

Fiend  Folio:  Abrian,  bloodthorn,  bonespear,  chronotyryn,

gathra, haraknin (canomorph), ironmaw, living holocaust, phiuhl,

steel predator, varrangoins (all), vorr, vultivor (canomorph).

Barrens of Doom and Despair Petitioners: Each malicious mortal

spirit that comes to the Barrens of Doom and Despair becomes a

special form of petitioner called a larva. Larvae appear as Medium

worms  with  heads  that  resemble  those  of  their  mortal  bodies.

Larvae  serve  as  the  currency  of  the   endish  planes,  especially

among night hags, liches, demons, devils, and yugoloths. Most are

used as food as to power spells, but occasionally a larva is promoted

to some kind of  end, usually a lemure or dretch. Larvae have the

following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold,  re.

Resistances: Acid 10, electricity 10.

Other  Special  Q ualities:  Disease,  infernal  wound,  no  planar

commitment.

Disease (Ex): Any creature wounded by a larva must make a DC

17 Fortitude save after the battle or contract devil chills.

Infernal Wound (Ex): Every time a larva hits with a bite attack

(its only attack form), it causes a persistent wound. Any creature so

injured loses 1 additional hit point each round. The wound does not

heal naturally and resists magical healing. The continuing hit point

loss can be stopped by a Heal check (DC 11 + larvas Con modi er),

a  cure  spell,  or  a  heal  spell.  However,  a  character  attempting  to

cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a creature damaged by a larvas

bite must succeed on a caster level check against the same DC as

the Heal check, or the spell has no effect. A successful level check

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

automatically stops the continuing hit point loss and restores hit

points as normal.

No  Planar  Commitment  (Ex):  Unlike  most  other  petitioners,

larvae  can  be  removed  from  the  Barrens  of  Doom  and  Despair.

Often, they are taken elsewhere to serve as food, barter goods, or basic

soulstuff for  endish projects that require an esoteric component.

FEATURES OF THE

BARRENS OF DOOM AND DESPAIR

As if it were Arvandors evil re ection, the Barrens of Doom and

Despair  appears  much  like  an  endless  wilderness  expanse,  except

that in place of lush forests and a sparkling ocean, it has wasted

deserts, arid badlands, blasted heaths, and frozen tundra. Each of

the   ve  deities  living  here  has  carved  out  a  realm,  but  the  vast

majority of the plane is simply the Barrens. The deities do not care

what happens in the lands between their realms, though they watch

with  amusement  when  the  Blood  War  erupts  there  or  travelers

struggle to survive.

Each of the divine realms in the Barrens is marked by a grand

and sinister palace at its center. At times, it seems as though the

 ve resident deities strive to outdo each other in the horrible mag-

ni cence of their dwellings.

Bane: At once the most grand and the most horrible palace in

the Barrens is Banes fortress, the Black Bastion. A towering edi ce

of adamantine, obsidian, ebony, and jet, it seems to suck what little

light there is out of the sky, casting a pall over the land all around

it. Bane rules over his realm as an iron- sted tyrant, seated on his

throne of skulls. Nevertheless, soldiers from across the planes, par-

ticularly devils,  ock to serve under his despotic rule. The purpose

of all these soldiers is not quite clear, although since Bane has tried

before to usurp supreme power, his plans can be easily surmised.

Bane is, after all, a god of strife, so he can hardly be expected to

gain any satisfaction from simply watching terrestrial con ict.

Beshaba: The Maid of Misfortunes realm, known as the Blood

Tor, is marked by a rocky hill near the banks of the River of Blood.

A single granite tower at the peak of the hill serves as the goddesss

palace. Rivulets of blood, said to be the blood of all who have lost

their lives in deadly accidents in Faern,  ow down the side of the

hill to merge with the river.

Hoar: Compared to the majestic malevolence of the Black Bas-

tion,  the  Doomcourt  of  Hoar  seems  rather  unimpressive.  Heads

mounted on pikes, each representing someone who slighted the god

of vengeance, surround the palace, giving it an air of despair and

horror. The structure is not built for war the way the Black Bastion

is; rather, it is a coolly elegant building. The marble walls of the

Doomcourt are limned with frost, and its cavernous halls amplify

every footstep. Little worship comes to Hoar from Faern these

days, and the realm seems to be shrinking in on itself.

Loviatar: The wastes grow colder and colder as one travels from

Hoars realm to Loviatars, until snow and ice stretch as far as the

eye can see and  endish dire wolves howl, thirsty for blood. Travelers

lost in this wilderness might  nd hope in the sight of a beautiful

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

aurora dancing above a glittering ice palace, but no succor awaits here.

This building is the Palace of Pain, the seat of Loviatars power. Her

realm is as beautiful as she is, and just as cruel. Though her palace is

spectacular to the eye, its surfaces are as sharp as a wall of razors.

Talona:  The  Lady  of  Poisons  home,  known  as  the  Palace  of

Poison Tears, is far from the realm of her rival, Loviatar. The hot

and humid fen that surrounds the structure is infested with para-

sites and infectious agents of all varieties. Mosquitoes and biting

midges swarm in the air, and every substance, from water to air,

is toxic. The pyramid-shaped palace squatting in the midst of the

marsh echoes Talonas triangular symbol.

Blood Rift

Named for the River of Blood that  ows across the plane through

a miles-deep canyon, Blood Rift is more important for its unique

role among the planes than for its inhabitants. Cosmologically ad-

jacent to both the Nine Hells and the Abyss, Blood Rift serves as

the main site of the eternal con ict of the demons and devilsthe

Blood War.

Blood Rift is a perfect battleground for the scheming, treacher-

ous  ends that wage the Blood War. Great barren plains alternate

with rocky badlands strewn with boulders, mesas, and box canyons

to form an ideal setting for ambushes and traps. The geographical

similarity of Blood Rift to certain areas of the Barrens of Doom

and Despair has led some to suggest that it was once a part of that

plane, but was split off when the divine rulers of the Barrens tired

of having a  endish war raging at the gates of their realms. This

theory might also explain Blood Rifts most distinctive featureits

ability to connect to other  endish planes, allowing the Blood War

to spill out into other evil lands from time to time.

BLOOD RIFT TRAITS

Blood Rift has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic.

?Strongly evil-aligned.

BLOOD RIFT LINKS

Because Blood Rift is coterminous with both the Nine Hells and the

Abyss, it serves as an eternal battleground for the devils and demons

that live on those planes. In addition, Blood Rift  oats among the

Lower Planes, becoming coterminous at different times to many of

them,  including  the  Barrens  of  Doom  and  Despair,  Clangor,  Deep

Caverns, the Demonweb Pits, Fated Depths, Furys Heart, Hammer-

grim, Nishrek, and the Supreme Throne. Whenever Blood Rift adjoins

one of these planes, the Blood War spills out onto it, at least until its

divine inhabitants take action to stop the carnage in their domains.

The fact that the River of Blood  ows strongly within Blood Rift

might somehow facilitate its connections to other  endish planes.

BLOOD RIFT INHABITANTS

The native inhabitants of Blood Rift are yugoloths. All the varieties

described in Manual of the Planes, Monster Manual II, and Fiend

Folio are represented here.

Fiend Folio: Slasrath.

Blood Rift Petitioners: The petitioners of Blood Rift are identical

to those of the Barrens of Doom and Despair.

FEATURES OF BLOOD RIFT

Blood Rift has no divine realms, and no deities make their homes

here.

Brightwater

No  less  beautiful  than  Arvandor,  Brightwater  is  a  well-settled

realm full of quaint cottages and elegant manors. While a planar

traveler  might  spend  days  in  Arvandor  without  seeing  another

sentient being, Brightwater is bustling with activityall of it fun.

The realm is devoted to joy, good fortune, and beauty, and this focus

shines in every face and from every building.

The plane as a whole is permeated with a sense of freewheeling

adventure  and  frolicsome  activity.  Brightwater  is  a  place  to  take

chances,  to  seize  the  day,  and  to  live  life  to  the  fullest.  Though

expressions such as these might be spoken only with cynicism in

Faern, they express the very essence of Brightwater.

BRIGHTWATER TRAITS

Brightwater has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly good-aligned and mildly chaos-aligned.

?Mild faith.

BRIGHTWATER LINKS

Sune maintains a portal to Hanali Celanils realm in Arvandor, and

Tymora keeps a portal to Green Fields. Sharess has a small realm in

Heliopolis, and a portal links her two domains as well. Brightwater

is connected to the trunk of the World Tree, and through it to all

the other celestial planes.

BRIGHTWATER INHABITANTS

The only outsiders native to Brightwater are the hosts of angels

that serve the  ve goddesses dwelling here. However, all types of

celestials and many other planar creatures frequent Brightwater to

enjoy the planes many and varied delights.

Fiend Folio: Bacchae.

Brightwater Petitioners: The petitioners of Brightwater, like the

bacchae  detailed  in  the  Fiend  Folio,  are  eternal  revelers  caught

midway  between  their  humanity  and  a  purely  bestial  nature.  At

least as chaotic as they are good, these petitioners savor their eter-

nal life to the last drop. They have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, polymorph.

Resistances: Acid 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Entice.

Entice (Su):  A  traveler  within  100  feet  of  a  mob  of  Bright-

waters petitioners must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the

number of petitioners within range; maximum DC 20) or join

the party. While partying with the revelers, those who failed their

saves drink, eat, and engage in all manner of pranks and foolery.

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

However, such celebrants take no sustenance, so they suffer the

effects of going without food and water. This condition lasts for

101  days  or  until  the  enticed  character  collapses  from  lack  of

sustenance.  Moving  an  affected  character  more  than  100  feet

from the party ends the effect on him, but he does not leave the

revelers willingly.

FEATURES OF BRIGHTWATER

Like a large city on the Material Plane, Brightwater is divided into

neighborhoods or wards, each the realm of a deity.

Lliira: Our Lady of Joys realm is the Quarter of the Orange

Lanternsa place of continuous celebration where life is like one

long festival. Feasts, music, dancing, drinking, and general carous-

ing are unceasing here. During the day, petitioners picnic on the

wide lawns or dance in the great halls that line the streets. At night,

the quarter blossoms into a loud carnival packed with musicians,

dancers, and revelers.

Sharess: Rapture, the realm of the Dancing Lady, lies between

Lliiras and Sunes realms both geographically and philosophically.

Rapture  is  the  citys  darkest  quartera  district   lled  with  dark,

twisting alleys and somewhat shady establishments.

Sune:  The  Heart re  Quarter  is  Sunes  realm.  Quieter  than

most places in Brightwater, this section of town is made up of

small rooms and hidden courtyards, where incense and candle-

light  ll the night air. The Heart re Quarter is also a place of

quiet mystery, where contemplatives seeking something beyond

love or physical pleasure are drawn by the secretive smile of Lady

Firehair.

Tymora:  The  Quarter  of  the  Great  Wheel  is  Tymoras  Realm.

Gambling, racing, games of chance, and tests of luck abound here.

The streets are broad and well kept, the buildings are elegant and

grand, and the inhabitants are boldand sometimes reckless.

Waukeen: The Marketplace Eternal, home of the goddess Wau-

keen,  lies  at  the  center  of  Brightwater.  The  only  district  of  the

plane that is dedicated to businesses other than pleasure, the Mar-

ketplace Eternal is devoted to commercial enterprise. Its streets are

packed, day or night, with buyers and sellers in a clamoring throng.

Commerce is an intoxicating pleasure in its own right, at least in

Waukeens realm.

Clangor

Like Blood Rift, Clangor is a battle eld. Unlike the primary site of

the Blood War, however, the armies that clash on Clangor are all

native to that plane. Home of the goblinoid deities Maglubiyet and

Hruggek and the kobold deity Kurtulmak, Clangor rings with the

sounds of endless battle. Vast armies of petitioners swell and break

upon each other,  ghting to bitter and bloody death, only to rise

with the next red dawn to resume their endless war.

Clangor is a landscape of iron, pitted with rust in some places

and carved into warrens and barracks in others. Its battle elds are

dusty plains of rust under blood-red skies. The tromp of soldiers

boots combined with the screams of dying warriors and tortured

prisoners produces an almost constant din.

CLANGOR TRAITS

Clangor has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly evil-aligned.

?Minor Positive-Dominant: Clangor is not a place where many

things can live, but those who battle on its killing  elds are suf-

fused with positive energy. Every creature on the plane gains fast

healing 2 and can even regrow lost limbs in time. Additionally,

those slain in the never-ending con icts on Clangors battle elds

rise each sunset fully healed and ready to  ght anew, as if they

had received the bene t of a true resurrection spell. Even peti-

tioners, who as outsiders cannot normally be resurrected, awaken

fully healed. Only those who suffer mortal wounds on Clangors

battle elds  get  the  true  resurrection  effect;  dead  characters

brought to this plane dont spontaneously revive.

CLANGOR LINKS

Both  Maglubiyet  and  Kurtulmak  maintain  portals  to  the  Nine

Hells, and Hruggek guards one leading to the Abyss. The denizens

of those destination planes are only too happy to allow their own

Blood War to overlap the war on Clangor, and they enjoy serving

as advisors to all sides in the con ict. The River of Blood also

 ows through Clangor, connecting it with most of the other  end-

ish planes.

CLANGOR INHABITANTS

The only outsiders native to Clangor are the goblin- ends called

barghests.  These  creatures  frequently  command  units  of  goblin

petitioners. Other creatures found on Clangor include many kinds

of  endish wolves, particularly worgs and winter wolves, which are

used as mounts by goblin cavalry.

Clangor  Petitioners:  Almost  all  the  petitioners  of  Clangor  are

goblinoids (including hobgoblins and bugbears as well as ordinary

goblins) and kobolds. Each has the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Acid, cold.

Resistances: Electricity 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF CLANGOR

On this vast planar battle eld, divine realms frequently shift their

boundaries, and even the seats of divine power look more like fron-

tier forts than permanent palaces.

Hruggek: Hruggekolohk is the realm of the bugbear deity Hrug-

gek. Its name means simply Hruggeks Place. Hruggekolohk is a

warren of caves worn from the iron of the plane over millennia.

Its  interior  is  red-brown  with  rust,  and  stagnant  pools  dot  the

 oors, interspersed with piles of bones and garbage. The bugbear

petitioners  that  stalk  these  tunnels  are  far  less  regimented  than

their  goblin  cousins,  and  they  tend  to  congregate  in  small  vil-

lages, each of which might boast a single building or a temporary

shelter.  The  bugbear  petitioners  are  no  less  inclined  to  war  than

the goblinsthey simply have a different view of it. Stealth and

ambush are their favored combat techniques, and since the caves of

147

12/19/03, 2:52:47 PM

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

Hruggekolohk seem to stretch underneath the entire plane, such

tactics serve the bugbears well.

Kurtulmak: Draukari, home of the kobold god Kurtulmak, is

another  warren  of  caverns,  though  its  tunnels  are  narrow  and

short.  The  twisting  warrens  of  Draukari  are  muddy  and  reek

of  death,  and  they  twist  so  maddeningly  upon  each  other  that

those not accustomed to them are doomed to get lost. Any visitor

larger than a hal ing must crawl through the mud, which often

hides unpleasant surprises. Like the bugbears of Hruggekolohk,

the kobolds of Draukari prefer stealth over brute force, though

kobold sorcerers are plentiful and offer a magical advantage over

the goblinoids.

Maglubiyet: The goblin gods capital is a fort called Grashmog, the

Heart of Battle. Usually far from the lines of battle, Grashmog is a

temple-city that serves as a training camp for the elite forces of the

goblin and hobgoblin army. Clerics from Grashmog advise generals

on upcoming battles, and the elite warriors trained here (called the

Steelbiters)  are  respected  throughout  the  plane  for  their  combat

prowess and their bonds with their  endish winter wolf mounts.

Cynosure

Also  known  as  the  Hall  of  Meeting,  Cynosure  is  the  only  truly

neutral  ground  among  the  planes.  Unclaimed  by  any  deity  and

uninhabited by any native race, Cynosure is nothing more than a

small demiplane in the shape of a huge, majestic hall, adorned with

soaring pillars and open to a star- lled sky. Surrounding the hall

are portals leading to every divine realm in Torils cosmology. This

plane is the place where the gods come to meet when some pressing

business demands a degree of communication among them. Whether

the meeting involves two deities hoping to cement an alliance or the

whole Faernian pantheon, Cynosure is a safe meeting place.

CYNOSURE TRAITS

Cynosure has the following traits.

?Finite size. Cynosure contains a great hall large enough for all

of Faerns deities. The plane extends no farther than the walls

of that hall.

?Static.

?Dead magic. The only magic that functions in Cynosure is the

magic of the portals that lead to the deities realms.

CYNOSURE LINKS

As noted above, the great hall of Cynosure is surrounded by portals,

one of which leads to the realm of every deity in the Faernian

pantheon. Each is a two-way portal with a simple prerequisite for

operation: It can be triggered only by a being with a divine rank of

0 or higher. No mortal can activate the portals in either direction,

though a deity can command a portal to allow a particular mortal

through if desired.

Cynosure exists outside the normal cosmology of Toril. Its con-

nection to the Astral Plane is tenuous at best, and travel in and out

of it is feasible only by means of the special portals. It is impossible

for a mortal or even a deity to set out from the Material Plane

through the Astral Plane and arrive in Cynosure, since no color

pools leading to this plane exist on the Astral Plane.

CYNOSURE INHABITANTS

Cynosure has no native inhabitants.

FEATURES OF CYNOSURE

The  heart  of  Cynosure  is  a  great  meeting  hall  furnished  with  a

grand  table  and  a  seat  for  every  Faernian  deity.  The  walls  are

decorated with images of Faerns dead deities, reaching back as far

as ancient Netheril and possibly even farther.

Deep Caverns

A  solid  mass  of  stone  permeated  with  winding  tunnels,  yawning

chasms, and great caves, the plane of Deep Caverns is like an in -

nite Underdark. Visitors to this utterly lightless plane  nd it more

horrifying in some ways even than the Abyss, where at least some

light appears in the sky from time to time. Here there is no sky and

no natural light, and the cavern walls seem to close in on unwel-

come travelers. Indeed, sometimes they do close in, leaving behind

no trace of any unlucky trespasser crushed between them.

DEEP CAVERNS TRAITS

Deep Caverns has the following traits:

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Strongly evil-aligned.

DEEP CAVERNS LINKS

Deep Caverns is permeated with portals to other planes, primarily

the Abyss.

DEEP CAVERNS INHABITANTS

In some areas of Deep Caverns, an unearthly wind howls through

the  endless  tunnels.  It  is  perhaps  this  feature  that  most  attracts

howlers (native to the Supreme Throne) to this plane. Other crea-

tures  of  earth  and  evil  also  dwell  here,  though  few  of  them  are

widely known on the Material Plane.

Monster Manual II: Dune stalker, rukarazyll, vaporighu.

Fiend Folio: Kaorti.

Deep Caverns Petitioners: The petitioners of this plane are behold-

ers, mind  ayers, and troglodytesnone of which are friendly to

the others. All of these creatures appear and behave much as they

did in life. They have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, sonic.

Resistances: Acid 10, cold 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Spell resistance 10.

FEATURES OF DEEP CAVERNS

The various sections of Deep Caverns are dif cult to distinguish

from  one  other,  and  the  three  divine  realms  located  here  are  so

widely separated that their boundaries are impossible to de ne. The

caverns themselves seem to know where a deitys realm begins and

ends, though. In fact, the walls respond to the will of the power in

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

chargeshifting,  opening  and  closing,  and  trapping  unfortunate

travelers at the deitys whim.

The Great Mother: This area, called the Realm of a Million Eyes,

is home to the Great Mother of the beholders. Laced with vertical

shafts, it is perfectly suited to the  oating petitioners of this realm.

The  Great  Mother  herself  dwells  in  a  vast  cavern  far  below  all

the sinkholes, endlessly spawning more beholders in solitude. Any

creature  that  comes  near  her  spawning  chamber  becomes  food,

including any of her own offspring that dont leave fast enough.

Certain beholder petitioners, apparently the oldest and meanest of

the lot, bear most of the responsibility for policing her realm. These

enforcers also control the tunnels here, since the Great Mother is

unconcerned with such matters.

Ilsensine: The Caverns of Thought

are the realm of Ilsensine, god of the

mind   ayers.  This  area  echoes  with

stray  thoughts  that  are  inaudible  but

nevertheless  clear  to  any  sentient

mind. Most of these thoughts are so

horrible that creatures lingering too long

near the caverns are quickly driven mad.

Laogzed:  The  Rotting  Plain  is  a  vast

cavern  dotted  with  putrid  lakes  that  are

fed  by  the  River  of  Blood.  A  million

tunnels  of  various  sizes  empty  into  this

cavern,  carrying  the  refuse  of  the  planes

for the troglodyte god Laogzed to devour. A

virtually mindless creature, Laogzed eats any-

thing and everything he  ndsliving, dead,

or  inorganic.  Many  denizens  of  the  planes

have discovered that they can easily get rid of

an item that should never be found by leaving

it on the Rotting Plain.

The Demonweb Pits

Like  a  monstrous  spiderweb  spun  across  the  very

fabric of the planes, the plane known as the Demon-

web Pits is formed of interwoven strands of planar matter.

Between these strands is nothingnesspits of in nite depth and

formless void. Unwary travelers who get stuck on the strands often

become the prey of  endish spiders, myrlochars, demons, or crea-

tures that are even worse.

DEMONWEB PITS TRAITS

The plane known as the Demonweb Pits has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly chaos-aligned and strongly evil-aligned.

?Strong  faith.  Followers  of  the  Seldarine  take  greater  penalties

here.

DEMONWEB PITS LINKS

Several portals to various layers of the Abyss open from the De-

monweb Pits, sometimes at random.

149

DEMONWEB PITS INHABITANTS

Frequent  visitors  from  the  Abyss  make  the  name  of  this  plane

at  least  partially  accurate,  though  Lolths  predivine  status  as  a

demon prince is the true origin of the appellation. Lolth is served

by demons of many sorts, primarily yochlol (detailed in Monstrous

Compendium:  Monsters  of  Faern),  but  also  glabrezus,  succubi,

mariliths, bebiliths, and retrievers.

Monsters of Faern: Myrlochar, yochlol (demon).

Fiend Folio: Abyssal ghoul, blood  end (demon).

Demonweb  Pits  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  the  Demonweb

Pits spend their afterlives just as they did their mortal onesslav-

ishly  obeying  Lolths  whims  while  engaging  in  endless  treachery

and deception. As petitioners, they take on a decidedly  endish yet

wretched appearance, though they

are still clearly droweven those

few who were not drow as mortals.

These creatures have the follow-

ing special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, poison.

Resistances: Acid 10,  re 10.

Other  Special  Q ualities:  A  petitioner

in the Demonweb Pits lies so often and so

well that it receives a +10 competence

bonus on Bluff checks.

FEATURES OF THE

DEMONWEB PITS

The  divine  realms  of

Ghaunadar,  Vhaeraun,

Kiaransalee,  and  Sel-

vetarm  are  strung

like

tiny  baubles

on  the  fabric  of  the

Demonweb.  The  De-

monweb itself belongs to

Lolthonly a fool would

try  to  deny  itthough  her

realm is actually separate from

Demonweb Pits

the web.

Ghaunadar: The Cauldron of Slime, a foul

nest of ooze and muck at what can only be described as the bottom

of  the  Demonweb,  is  Ghaunadars  domain.  Oozes,  puddings,  and

fungi dominate this vile realm, and a sickly, phosphorescent glow

suffuses the place with garish colors.

Kiaransalee: The Lady of the Dead claims a small and desolate

patch  of  the  Demonweb  as  her  realm.  The  sole  edi ce  here  is  a

tower  made  of  bones.  Kiaransalee  calls  the  structure  Thanatos,

after  the  layer  of  the  Abyss  she  stole  from  Orcus  and  then  lost

when the demon prince returned to life.

Lolth: The realm of the Queen of Spiders has always been de-

scribed as a great iron fortress shaped like a spider, which constantly

clambers over the strands of the Demonweb. At present, however, no

spider fortress wanders the Demonweb, at Lolths command or oth-

erwise. Somewhere amid the tangled strands of the web, Lolth has

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   149

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

woven an impenetrable barrier of planar fabric. No servant enters,

and no word from the spider goddess goes forth. The scheming of

the other drow deities has intensi ed since Lolths mysterious re-

treat, but so far little has come of itat least on the Demonweb. In

Faern, much has come of it, particularly (though not exclusively) as

a result of Kiaransalees plotting. (See the City of the Spider Q ueen

adventure and Chapter 7 of this book for more information.)

Selvetarm: Though he normally shares Lolths realm, Selvetarm

now stands guard outside the spider goddesss retreat.

Vhaeraun:  The  Masked  Lords  small  realm,  called  Ellaniath,

amounts to little more than a hiding place where the god can hole

up when Lolths patience with him runs out. He keeps his hatred of

Lolth hidden behind his mas, but he constantly and subtly schemes

against her. Lolth is no foolshe encourages this kind of behavior

in her servants, and she expects no less from her own child.

Dragon Eyrie

As its name suggests, Dragon Eyrie is an enormous mountaintop

surrounded  by  wispy  clouds  and  crowned  with  an  eternal  cap

of  snow.  Around  it   y  the  spirits  of  departed  dragons,  keeping

to  themselves  as  much  as  possible.  No  city  or  village  mars  the

perfect crags of the mountaintop, though some nondragons that

come here in search of solitude build small shelters in which to

live  out  their  hermitic  existences.  The  dragons  do  not  tolerate

any more extensive settlements, and they put up with the hermits

only grudgingly.

DRAGON EYRIE TRAITS

Dragon Eyrie has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mild faith.

DRAGON EYRIE LINKS

Hlal  maintains  a  portal  here  that  leads  to  the  realm  of  Erevan

Ilesere on Arvandor.

DRAGON EYRIE INHABITANTS

Most of the native inhabitants of Dragon Eyrie are celestial and

 endish dragons and draconic petitioners.

Monsters of Faern: Abishai (in Tiamats realm).

Fiend Folio: Khaasta.

Draconomicon:  Planar  dragons  (all  varieties).  Although  these

creatures are native to many different planes, they all at least visit

the Dragon Eyrie from time to time.

Dragon Eyrie Petitioners: The petitioners of this plane are the

spirits of dragons, half-dragons, dragonkin, and all other forms of

dragonkind.  For  dragons,  the  afterlife  represents  an  opportunity

to  strive  toward  a  perfection  that  was  unattainable  in  life.  Such

perfection, however, is best pursued in silence and solitude. Though

they are no longer great hoarders of treasure, dragon petitioners are

still hostile to intruders who would invade their privacy, and they

remain among the most arrogant creatures on any plane. Dragon

Eyrie petitioners have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunity: Cold.

Resistances: Acid 5, electricity 5,  re 5.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF DRAGON EYRIE

Dragon Eyrie is divided into four broad bandsthe dark roots, the

lower reaches, the middle crags, and the peak. With the exception

of the peak, which is entirely Nulls divine realm, no divine realm

occupies the entire expanse of an altitude band. Most of the moun-

tain is open territory claimed by no deity, where the petitioners of

the plane seek their solitude.

Hlal:  The  lower  reaches  of  Dragon  Eyries  great  slope  include

the divine realm of Hlal, the trickster and messenger deity of the

dragons.  Brass  and  copper  dragon  petitioners  tend  to  congregate

near  this  realm.  These  lower  slopes  are  warm  and  dry,  at  least

near Hlals domain, so they attract blue dragon petitioners as well,

though the blues try to stay far away from the brasses and coppers.

Other, wetter areas of the lower reaches are favored by green and

black petitioners.

Null: The summit of Dragon Eyrie is the domain of Null, the

draconic god of death. White and silver dragon petitioners are at-

tracted to the cold of his realm, and in a way these two kinds of

dragons represent the two very different views of this mysterious

deity. The crude and bestial white dragons admire Nulls role as a

taker of life and revere him as a force of violence and power. The

silvers, on the other hand, worship him as the guardian of dead

spiritsthe  one  who  brings  draconic  souls  to  their  rest  in  the

Dragon Eyrie and, ideally, leads them toward perfection once they

have arrived.

Task: Tasks realm lies in the middle reaches of Dragon Eyrie, in

a region known as the Furnace because of its volcanic activity. Task

dwells in a rocky cave  lled with a vast treasure hoard. Red, gold,

and bronze dragon petitioners live in this area, attracted to its hot

springs and  owing lava.

Tiamat: Tiamats realm, known as the Cave of Greed, lies deep

underground,  at  the  dark  bottom  of  Dragon  Eyrie.  Many  chro-

matic dragon petitioners choose to make their lairs near hers (but

not too near), and deep dragon and shadow dragon petitioners tend

to favor this subterranean region as well.

Dwarfhome

Like Dragon Eyrie, Dwarfhome is a great mountain, though its

roots and foothills are also part of the plane. And while Dragon

Eyries skies only occasionally feature a dragon in  ight, Dwarf-

home teems with lifespeci cally with dwarf petitioners. A hive of

industry and a marvel of artisanship, Dwarfhome serves as a model

of the dwarven ideals of life, labor, and home.

DWARFHOME TRAITS

Dwarfhome has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly good-aligned.

?Mild faith.

DWARFHOME LINKS

No portals are known to connect Dwarfhome with any other plane.

However, one of the roots of the World Tree extends from Deep-

shaft Hall (Dumathoins home) up through Erackinor (the realm

of Moradin and Berronar Truesilver), and from there to the other

celestial planes.

DWARFHOME INHABITANTS

Besides the petitioners of the plane, the only natives of Dwarfhome

are the angels that serve the dwarven deities. Perhaps out of respect

for the powers here, the angels are often short and stout, resembling

dwarves more than humans.

Monster Manual II: Durzagon (half- end).

Dwarfhome  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  this  planeeven

those few who were not dwarves in their mortal livesappear as

sturdy dwarves here. Dwarfhomes petitioners have the following

special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Fire, poison.

Resistances: Acid 10, electricity 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Because Dwarfhomes petitioners can

spend eternity perfecting their crafts, each gains a +10 competence

bonus  on  all  Craft  checks.  In  addition,  each  possesses  the  dwarf

racial traits described in the Monster Manual.

FEATURES OF DWARFHOME

Dwarfhome is an impossibly huge mountain, large enough to con-

tain whole worlds. Great halls are carved into its sides, with gigantic

doorways  big  enough  to  admit  even  the  largest  dragon  with  its

wings spread wide. Caverns extend far into the mountains roots,

and majestic citadels are erected on its sides. Erackinor, the realm

of Moradin and Berronar Truesilver, lies at the top of Dwarfhome.

The closer a deitys relationship to those two deities, the nearer its

realm is to the summit of the great mountain. Thus, Abbathors

realm lies far below the mountain, while Thard Harrs is located

on a distant plateau.

Abbathor: The sole evil member of the dwarven pantheon who

has not been banished to Hammergrim lives far underneath the

halls of Erackinor in a realm called the Glitterhell. The walls of

Abbathors domain sparkle with gemstones and mithral.

Berronar  Truesilver/Moradin:  Erackinor,  the  realm  shared  by

Moradin  and  Berronar  Truesilver,  combines  the  grandest  of  all

stone-carved halls with endless mine shafts full of gold, gems, and

mithral. At the heart of Erackinor is the Soul Forge, the mighty

furnace where Moradin hammered out the  rst dwarves. Even now,

he still shapes the souls of dwarves here before sending them to the

Material Plane.

Clangeddin Silverbeard: Just in the shadow of Erackinor is Mount

Clangeddin, home of the Father of Battles. Though it is a mighty

mountain  in  its  own  right,  it  is  small  next  to  Moradins  home.

The great halls of Mount Clangeddin seem to have been carved

to imitate those of Erackinor, but they have been turned to a far

more military purpose. If Erackinor is an artisans delight, Mount

Clangeddin is a dwarf soldiers paradise. Regimented and orderly, it

serves as the barracks and armory of Dwarfhomes defenders as well

as the realm of Clangeddin Silverbeard.

151

Dugmaren  Brightmantle/Dumathoin/Vergadain:  Three  realms

are carved into the sides of Dwarfhomes great mountain. Soot

Hall, the realm of Dugmaren Brightmantle, is a place of constant

invention. Dumathoins realm, known as Deepshaft Hall, consists

almost  entirely  of  mineshafts,  though  it  still  includes  enough

unexplored tunnels and unhewn rock to keep the most driven ex-

plorer happy for an eternity. Strongale Hall is Vergadains realm,

a place of commerce, gambling, and the pleasures of good food

and strong drink.

Gorm  Gulthyn:  Built  atop  a  foothill  even  more  distant  than

Sharindlars, Watchkeep is the realm of Fire Eyes. Gorm Gulthyn

is said to keep watch constantly from the top of his tower, where he

can see the entire plane, so that he will know immediately if any

portal  opens  into  Dwarfhome.  Many  dwarven  defenders  hope  to

have the chance to stand guard at Watchkeep after deatha privi-

lege they believe is granted to those who die while  ghting superior

forces in the line of duty.

Haela Brightaxe/Marthammor Duin: These two somewhat reclu-

sive dwarven deities have realms in remote caverns tucked into the

foothills of Dwarfhome. Haela Brightaxes pleasant grotto is called

Findar  Endar,  while  Marthammor  Duins  cave  is  known  as  the

Cavern of Rest. Both deities wander Dwarfhome and other planes

frequently, leaving trusted lieutenants to guard their realms.

Sharindlar: Sharindlars realm, the Merciful Court, is a circle of

standing stones on a foothill near Dwarfhomes towering bulk. Its

position enables Sharindlar to act as an intermediary between Mo-

radin and the other dwarven deitieseven the likes of Abbathor

and the duergar gods of Hammergrim. The Merciful Court is the

site of nightly dances in honor of the Shining Dancer.

Thard Harr: The most reclusive member of the dwarven pan-

theon is Thard Harr, who dwells on a heavily forested plateau near

the edge of the plane. Called the Forbidden Plateau, this realm has

much in common with the jungles of Chult, where Thard Harrs

followers reside. Like its Material Plane counterpart, the Forbidden

Plateau even boasts a large population of resident dinosaurs.

Dweomerheart

If  the  universe  held  a  plane  of  magic,  Dweomerheart  would  be

it. Home of Faerns deities of magic, Dweomerheart is charged

with magical energy that courses through any spellcaster who sets

foot there.

DWEOMERHEART TRAITS

Dweomerheart has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mild faith.

?Enhanced magic: All spells cast on Dweomerheart are extended,

enlarged, and empowered, as though by the corresponding feats,

though they do not require higher-level spell slots or longer than

normal casting times. Mystra, however, has the ability to prevent

anyone she wishes from casting spells on this plane.

DWEOMERHEART LINKS

No portals are known to connect Dweomerheart to any other plane.

However, low-lying branches of the World Tree extend into Dweo-

merheart, connecting it with the other celestial planes.

DWEOMERHEART INHABITANTS

As guardian of the laws of magic, Mystra is also the creator of the

inevitablesconstructs of law that are charged with enforcing the

most fundamental and inescapable laws of the universe. In addition to

the inevitables, various angels serve the deities of Dweomerheart.

Manual of the Planes: Mercane.

Dweomerheart  Petitioners:  Almost  all  the  petitioners  of  this

plane were wizards or sorcerers in life, and they retain the merest

glimmer of their old aptitude for magic. These individuals have the

following special qualities.

Immunities: Petri cation, polymorph.

Resistances: Acid 10,  re 10.

Additional Special Q ualities: Damage reduction 5/magic, spell

resistance 10.

FEATURES OF DWEOMERHEART

Set on a high plateau, Dweomerheart is a glittering city adorned

with glamers and built from pure magical energy.

Azuth: The domain of the Patron of Mages is carved into the

plateau below the city, in a series of caverns that are collectively

called Azuth, after their chief resident. An air of ritual and mystery

pervades this realm, and if the city of Dweomerheart is where those

who want to learn about magic should go, Azuth is the place where

those who want to learn to be wizards should go. The distinction

may be subtle, but it makes all the difference in the portfolios of

Mystra and Azuth.

Mystra: The realm of the Lady of Mysteries encompasses the

whole  of  the  city  and  the  surface  of  the  plateau.  The  city  itself

resembles a university or a school of magic. Petitioners and planar

visitors who are hungry for magical knowledge can choose no better

place in all the planes to  nd what they seek.

Savras: Adjacent to Azuths realm is a smaller series of caverns

called The Eye that is home to Savras. It is said that all of the gods

knowledge about the past and future is recorded here, but the truth

is that items as prosaic as books and scrolls could never hold such a

depth of knowledge. Rather, the place rings with thoughtsmaking

it eerily similar to Ilsensines realm in Deep Caverns. These echoing

thoughts might contain deep insight into past, present, or future,

but it would take a remarkably strong mind to sort through them.

Velsharoon: Far below the realms of Azuth and Savras lies a musty

crypt called Deaths Embrace, which is the realm of the Vaunted.

All the secrets of necromancy are contained in Velsharoons crypt.

Fated Depths

A place of black water and crushing pressure, Fated Depths is where

the  River  of  Blood  deposits  its  viscous  water,  along  with  all  the

jetsam of the  endish planes. Its inhabitants are hungry as sharks

and  as  cruel  as  sahuagin,  and  the  plane  itself  seems  hungry  for

souls to consume.

FATED DEPTHS TRAITS

Fated Depths has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Water-dominant. The water of Fated Depths is unholy water that

damages any celestial that enters it.

?Strongly evil-aligned.

FATED DEPTHS LINKS

Fated Depths contains portals to the watery layers of the Abyss as

well as the Elemental Plane of Water. A portal also connects this

plane with Umberlees realm in Furys Heart. The River of Blood

spills into the waters of Fated Depths, connecting it with most of

the other  endish planes.

FATED DEPTHS INHABITANTS

Aquatic  creatures  of  chaos  and  evil  are  the  natural  inhabitants  of

Fated Depths. Most are rarely seen on the Material Plane, though

 endish  sharks  (and  dire  sharks),  giant  squids,  octopi,  and  krakens

sometimes appear there. Half- end sahuagin are surprisingly common

in Fated Depths, and half- end kuo-toa are somewhat less so.

Fiend Folio: Myrmixicus (demon), piscoloth (yugoloth), skulvyn

(demon), wastrilith (demon).

Fated  Depths  Petitioners:  Sahuagin  and  kuo-toa  petitioners  are

the primary inhabitants of Fated Depths. Both types of petitioners

appear unchanged from their living forms. They have the following

special qualities.

Immunities: Cold,  re.

Resistances: Acid 10, electricity 10.

Additional Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF FATED DEPTHS

Fated  Depths  is  an  almost  featureless  expanse  of  dark  saltwater

with neither surface nor bottom.

Sekolah: Sekolah, one of the two powers that lives in the dark

waters of Fated Depths, has no realm. The god rules where it is, and

no creature dares challenge it.

Blibdoolpoolp: The Drowning Goddess, on the other hand, does

have  a  realma  spherical  temple  that  resembles  a  small  moon

drifting  through  the  unholy  waters  of  the  plane.  Fiendish  crus-

taceans  and  kuo-toa  petitioners  share  this  enormous  structure,

serving their increasingly irrelevant deity.

The Fugue Plane

When mortals die, their souls are drawn to the Fugue Plane. The

vast majority of this plane is  at, gray, bland, and nondescript, with

no notable topographical features.

FUGUE PLANE TRAITS

The Fugue Plane has the following traits.

?Static. The static nature of the plane allows the devils to torment

the petitioners without ever ending their suffering.

?Impeded magic: All spells are impeded.

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

FUGUE PLANE LINKS

Like Cynosure, the Fugue Plane exists outside the normal cosmol-

ogy of Toril. Souls naturally travel from the Material Plane to the

Fugue Plane at death, but they cannot leave of their own volition.

Divine  servants  can  travel  here  from  the  realms  of  their  deities

and  bring  souls  back  with  them,  as  long  as  those  souls  properly

belong to the deities they serve. Portals from the Nine Hells open

into the Fugue Plane because of the devils agreement with Kelem-

vor, and demon lords sometimes create portals leading here from

the Abyss. In both cases, the  ends can carry souls back to their

home planes through these portals. Any other travel to or from

the Fugue Plane is impossible. Mortals cannot travel to the Fugue

Plane while their bodies live, and no color pools leading here exist

on the Astral Plane.

FUGUE PLANE INHABITANTS

The  Fugue  Planes  only  inhabitants  are  the  souls  of  the  dead

awaiting  transport  to  the  planes  of  their  deities.  These  souls  are

petitioners  with  no  planar  traitsno  immunities,  resistances,  or

special  qualities.  The  souls  of  the  Faithless  form  a  living  wall

around  the  City  of  Judgment,  while  the  souls  of  the  False  are

sentenced to servitude within the city, where they are sometimes

tortured by devils.

Fugue  Plane  Petitioners:  The  False  are  the  petitioners  of  the

Fugue Plane, since they are its only permanent residents (except the

Faithless, who are doomed to be dissolved into the substance of the

plane). The False have no immunities, resistances, or other special

qualities, but they are protected to some extent by the unchanging

nature of the plane.

FEATURES OF THE FUGUE PLANE

The only feature of this generally featureless plane is the Crystal

Spire, the shared realm of Kelemvor and Jergal, which stands in the

middle of the City of Judgment. The city is a gray, bland, tightly

packed metropolis populated by the judged dead.

Jergal/Kelemvor: The Crystal Spire is a glittering tower of trans-

parent rock. When Cyric was god of the dead, this tower was called

the Bone Castle, but Kelemvor transformed it as a symbol of his

commitment to open and fair judgment of the dead.

Furys Heart

Furys Heart has a certain similarity to the Barrens of Doom and

Despair in that both planes are desolate landscapes with little life

and no redeeming qualities. But while the Barrens are still, lifeless,

and desolate, Furys Heart is a turmoil of storms, howling winds,

crashing waves, biting blizzards, and wild beasts. The Barrens re-

fuses to support life, but Furys Heart actively seeks to crush life.

FURYS HEART TRAITS

Furys Heart has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Strongly evil-aligned.

?Mild faith.

?Winters Hall, Aurils domain, has the cold-dominant trait. Each

creature who enters this realm takes 3d12 points of cold damage

in each round that it lacks shelter of some kind.

FURYS HEART LINKS

Umberlees domain contains a portal to Fated Depths. The River

of Blood  ows through Malars domain (and a branch pours into

the Blood Sea), connecting Furys Heart with most of the other

 endish planes.

FURYS HEART INHABITANTS

The natives of Furys Heart are creatures of evil, and many are

bestial  creatures  that  resemble  terrestrial  animals.  Nightmares

and yeth hounds fall into the latter category, while night hags and

vargouilles simply live here for the evil.

Manual of the Planes: Ice paraelementals, cold element creatures

(Winters Hall).

Fiend Folio: Abrian, bloodthorn, ironmaw, khaasta, phiuhl, var-

rangoins (all), vorr, vultivor (canomorph).

Furys  Heart  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  Furys  Heart  are

cruel, callous, and wrathful spirits. Some take on an almost elemen-

tal form, such as the cold spirits of Winters Hall and the sentient

lightning of the Towers of Ruin. Others, such as the weresharks

that swim with Umberlee in the Blood Sea, appear just as they did

in  life.  Malars  petitioners,  and  some  of  Umberlees  as  well,  are

transformed into animal forms, appearing as particularly  erce and

primitive  versions  of  normal  animals.  Furys  Hearts  petitioners

have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold, electricity.

Resistances: Fire 10, sonic 10.

Special Attacks: Any petitioner of Auril or Talos deals an extra

1d6  points  of  damage  (cold  or  lightning,  respectively)  on  a  suc-

cessful melee attack. A petitioner of Malar or Umberlee gains the

ability to rage once per day as a 1st-level barbarian.

Other  Special  Q ualities:  A  petitioner  of  Auril  or  Talos  gains

certain elemental traits, while a petitioner of Umberlee or Malar

has damage reduction 10/silver.

FEATURES OF FURYS HEART

Like  several  other  planes,  Furys  Heart  is  an  enormous  expanse

of wild terrain, from Umberlees Blood Sea, to Malars Land of

the Hunt, to the distant, frigid tundra of Aurils realm, which is

known as Winters Hall. Violent weather is the norm throughout

the plane. The wind force is rarely below severe (31 mph or more),

and storms are nearly constant.

Auril: Across the Land of the Hunt from the Towers of Ruin,

the  land  grows  colder  and  colder  until  all  terrain  dissolves  into

an ever-present covering of ice. This realm is Winters Hall, the

Frostmaidens domain, and there is no colder place on all the planes.

Aurils palace is formed of shaped wind walls that are bitterly cold,

and her throne is made of frozen blue  re.

Malar:  Malars  realm,  the  Land  of  the  Hunt,  stretches  for

uncounted miles from the shore of the Blood Sea. A great, open

plain stocked with abundant wildlife (including souls stolen from

the Fugue Plane and transformed into innocuous animal forms as

GATES OF THE MOON LINKS

The  eladrins  maintain  a  portal  to  Arvandor  here.  The  topmost

branches of the World Tree extend into the Gates of the Moon, al-

lowing travel to other celestial planes. The In nite Staircase, which

connects to Selnes palace, is another conduit to other

planes, though it is far less predictable. See Features

of the Gates of the Moon, below.

GATES OF THE MOON

INHABITANTS

The servitors of Selne are planetars

called shards. These female angels are

said to have been created from equal

parts of  re and moonlight. Lillends

and  other  kinds  of  angels  are  also

common  in  the  Gates  of  the  Moon,

and  the  eladrins  have  their  faerie

court here.

Gates  of  the  Moon  Petitioners:

following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Acid,  re.

Resistances: Electricity 10, sonic 10.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF THE GATES OF THE MOON

Though she shares the plane with two other deities, Selne is the

undisputed mistress of the Gates of the Moon.

Finder  Wyvernspur:  The  demigod  Finder  Wyvernspur  has

taken up permanent residence within Selnes palace. He is still

growing  accustomed  to  divinity,  having  only  recently  ascended

at the end of the Time of Troubles. His chambers are always full

of music, and works of art created by his petitioners decorate all

of Selnes hall.

Selne:  The  home  of  Selne  is  a  shining  hall  of  silver  called

Argentil,  which  is  located  in  the  middle  of  the  plane.  The  hall

is a place of quiet beauty, where all sound seems muf ed and the

moonlight appears to cling to creatures and objects, suffusing them

with a soft silvery glow.

prey for hunters), the Land of the Hunt is the only region of Furys

Heart where the weather is occasionally hospitable. The Beastlord

roams his realm with his petitioners, all of whom take the forms

of large carnivorous animals, to savor the thrill of the hunt. When

unwelcome visitors enter the plane, Malar and his companions glee-

fully turn their attention away from helpless prey and begin to stalk

the intruders instead.

Talos:  Toward  one  edge  of  the  Land  of  the  Hunt,  the  plains

begin to rise into steep, rocky hillsa sign that Malars

realm has ended and Taloss has begun. Atop one

of the hills in this realm stands the Storm

Lords palace, the aptly named Towers of

Ruin.  The  towers  that  comprise  this

structure  are  now  little  more  than

rocks  precariously  stacked  together,

so  often  have  they  been  battered

by lightning strikes and hurricane-

force winds. At the borders of Taloss

realm,  the  winds  are  always  severe,

blowing out from the center of the

realm  toward  the  edges.  Closer  to

the center, the wind force gradually

increases until it reaches hurricane

levels around the Towers of Ruin.

Periodically, and at Taloss command,

the wind is supplemented by sting-

ing rain and carefully directed bolts

of lightning, ensuring that few un-

welcome visitors arrive here.

Umberlee: The Blood Sea is an ex-

panse of saltwater constantly beaten

by  storms.  Gale-force  winds  (severe

wind  force)  sweep  over  foam-capped

waves,  torrential  rain  pours  from  the

blackened  sky,  and  lightning  demolishes  any-

thing that breaks the surface of the water. The Queen of

the Depths swims through the reddish water of her realm, accom-

panied by native creatures such as  endish squids and myrmixicus

demons. Petitioners, including weresharks and humanoids given the

forms of sharks or similar beasts, also accompany Umberlee.

The Gates of the Moon

Surrounded  by  a  boundless  ocean  of  shimmering  light,  like  an

aurora  in  liquid  form,  a  rocky  island  rises  up  in  the  moonlight,

crowned by a shining hall of silver. It is always night here but rarely

dark, since the light waxes and wanes with the ever-present moon.

Lycanthropes who come to the Gates of the Moon can change

shape freely. They are always completely in control of the change

and of their behavior in animal form. Af icted lycanthropes who

are knowledgeable about the planes sometimes journey to the Gates

of the Moon to seek sanctuary from their af iction.

GATES OF THE MOON TRAITS

The Gates of the Moon has the following traits.

154

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   154

12/19/03, 2:57:17 PM

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

The In nite Staircase is a strange conduit that appears within

Selnes hall of silver when the moon is full and the fog creeps up

from the water. Stories say that it leads from Argentil to all the

cities that exist on any plane, or to all the cities that ever were or

will befrom the cities of the angels to the darkened halls of the

Nine Hells. The staircase leads not just up and down, but also in

all directions, and its gravity changes from one landing to another.

Why this conduit is connected to Selnes realm is a mystery, but it

might actually be a function of Shaundakuls presence on the plane

rather than the Moonmaidens.

Shaundakul: The Rider of the Winds also calls the Gates of the

Moon home, insofar as he can call any place home. Shaundakul has

no hall to rival Argentil, but he travels from place to place on this

plane and among all the planes.

Golden Hills

Golden Hills is a plane that consists of seven rolling hills, one for

each of the gnome deities who reside there. Everything in Golden

Hills is lightly tinted or highlighted with gold, and its burnished

sheen glows in the light of the setting sun.

GOLDEN HILLS TRAITS

Golden Hills has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mildly good-aligned.

?Mild faith.

GOLDEN HILLS LINKS

Flandal Steelskin maintains a portal to the realm of Gond in the

House of Knowledge. Golden Hills is connected to the trunk of the

World Tree, and through it to the rest of the celestial planes.

GOLDEN HILLS INHABITANTS

Besides the gnome petitioners, the only inhabitants of Golden Hills

are the angels that serve the gnome deities.

Golden  Hills  Petitioners:  All  the  petitioners  of  Golden  Hills

even those few who were not gnomes in their mortal livesappear

as healthy, happy gnomes here. Each Golden Hills petitioner has

the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold,  re.

Resistances: Electricity 10, sonic 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Gnome racial traits (as described in the

Monster Manual).

FEATURES OF GOLDEN HILLS

The leadership and guidance of Garl Glittergold pulls the gnome

pantheon into a uni ed whole, and it could be said that he does

the same for Golden Hills, uniting the seven realms of the gnome

deities into a single plane.

Baervan Wildwanderer: The Masked Leafs realm is called Whis-

perleaf, after the great oak planted on top of the hill. Baervans

spear is cut from the wood of this oak tree and carries the same

name as his realm. The cozy cottage nestled beside the tree looks

small from the outside, but its large enough within to hold all of

Baervans petitioners and servants.

Baravar Cloakshadow: The Sly Ones realm, known as the Hidden

Knoll, is full of tricks and nonlethal traps, swathed in illusion and

designed around deception. Like Baravars church, his petitioners

are loosely organized, dwelling in small settlements scattered across

and within the Hidden Knoll.

Callarduran Smoothhands: The realm of the Master of Stone is

called the Deep, and though it appears to be the smallest hill of the

seven, its caverns extend far below the earth. Svirfneblin petitioners

usually end up in this realm whether they speci cally revere Cal-

larduran or not, simply because the terrain seems most like home

to them.

Flandal Steelskin: The Mithral Forge is the Master of Metals

domain. This realm of  re and heat is concealed beneath a hill that

shakes with every blow of Flandals hammer. A portal leading from

the Elemental Plane of Fire provides the heat for this forge.

Gaerdal Ironhand: Stronghaven, the realm of Gaerdal Ironhand,

is aptly named, since it is the most forti ed of the gnome deities

realms. This military fortress forms the  rst line of defense for the

entire plane, and it is surely the last it will ever need. Stronghaven

is also the one place in the Golden Hills where practical jokes are

frowned upon and laughter is seldom heard.

Garl Glittergold: Though the leader of the gnome pantheon has a

hill of his own here (Glitterhome, the largest of the seven hills), he

prefers to spend his time roaming the plane as a watchful protector.

Segojan  Earthcaller:  The  Earthfriends  realm  is  known  as  the

Gemstone Burrow, and it is home to many burrowing animals as

well as gnomes. The Gemstone Burrow consists of an endless bundle

of  earthen  tunnels,  and  the  petitioners  who  live  there  dig   ne,

comfortable burrows of their own.

Green Fields

In  the  pleasant  realm  of  Green  Fields,  hal ing  petitioners  while

away their existence in peaceful meditation and hard work, enjoying

the fruits of their labors and the company of their fellows. A place

of safety and repose, Green Fields is basically a collection of hal ing

settlements among gently rolling hills.

GREEN FIELDS TRAITS

Green Fields has the following traits.

?Divinely morphic.

?Mild faith.

GREEN FIELDS LINKS

A  portal  to  Tymoras  domain  on  Brightwater  lies  somewhere  in

Green Fields, but only Brandobaris knows its locationand hes not

telling. Lower branches of the World Tree also extend into Green

Fields, connecting it with the rest of the celestial planes.

GREEN FIELDS INHABITANTS

Besides the hal ing petitioners, the only inhabitants of Green Fields

are the angels that serve the hal ing deities.

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

Green  Fields  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  Green  Fields  all

appear as hal ings, even those few who were not hal ings in life.

They have a vibrant, healthy look about them, as though they were

bursting with life. They have the following special qualities.

Immunities: Electricity, polymorph.

Resistances: Acid 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Damage reduction 10/magic, resonance

 eld.

Resonance  Field  (Ex):  Any  creature  that  causes  damage  to  a

petitioner  on  Green  Fields  through  any  form  of  attack  suffers

wounds identical to those it in icts and takes identical damage. If

a single attack causes damage to multiple petitioners (a  reball, for

instance), the attacker takes damage equal to the total in icted on

all petitionersfar more than the damage dice indicate. The reso-

nance  eld is a property of the plane, not the petitioners, which is

why it is noted as an exceptional ability.

FEATURES OF GREEN FIELDS

Fittingly for a pantheon that places such emphasis on community

and racial unity, most of the hal ing deities share Green Fields

as  a  divine  realm  and  do  not  carve  their  own  realms  from  its

planar fabric.

Arvoreen/Cyrrollalee/Sheela Peryroyl/Yondalla: These four deities

hold the realm in common, dwelling where they choose. They often

move among the settlements of the plane with the seasons or at

their own whims. The settlements themselves are as impermanent

as  any  hal ing  encampment  on  the  Material  Plane,  and  their

residents  happily  wander  from  lakeshore  to  riverside,  and  from

cultivated  elds to pastoral hills.

Brandobaris: The Master of Stealth, who wanders even more than

the other deities, does not limit his travels to Green Fields. He is

welcome in the plane, though he really takes no part in maintaining

it as a divine realm.

Urogalan: The Lord of the Earths realm is a cavern beneath the

lush grass of Green Fields. Few petitioners remain there for long,

though it is the entry point to the plane for the spirits of all dead

hal ings.  Urogalan  is  respected  more  than  he  is  worshiped,  and

most petitioners are happy to leave his realm and move closer to

their deities of choice.

Hammergrim

Hammergrim  is  a  realm  of  gray  light,  gray  stone,  and  somber

clothinga grim plane suffused with the pessimism and despair of

the duergar. But for all that, it is also a place of great artisanship,

where duergar smiths perfect the art of forging weapons and armor

both mundane and magical.

HAMMERGRIM TRAITS

Hammergrim has the following traits.

HAMMERGRIM LINKS

The only maintained portal here is the one linking Urdlens realm

to  the  Abyss.  Portals  leading  from  the  Barrens  of  Doom  and

Despair  open  with  disturbing  frequency  here,  allowing  achaierai

and other  endish creatures to raid Hammergrim for fresh prey.

The River of Blood connects Hammergrim to most of the other

 endish planes.

HAMMERGRIM INHABITANTS

Aside from the duergar petitioners, unwelcome visitors from the

Barrens of Doom and Despair make all too frequent appearances

in Hammergrim.

Monster Manual II: Durzagon (half- end).

Fiend Folio: Maug.

Hammergrim  Petitioners:  The  gray  dwarf  petitioners  of  Ham-

mergrim  have  come  through  Laduguers  forge  of  adversity  and

become stronger than steel. They retain their earthly forms, except

that their skin is steely gray and hard, though still supple enough

to allow free movement. They have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, sonic.

Resistances: Cold 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Damage reduction 5/adamantine.

In addition to the majority of gray dwarf petitioners, some few evil

gnome followers of Urdlen come to Hammergrim as petitioners as

well. These spirits do not retain their earthly shapes, appearing as

Small, blind moles instead. Such a petitioner makes natural attacks

with its adamantine claws, dealing 1d6 points of damage per attack.

In addition, each has the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold, sonic.

Resistances: Electricity 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Spell resistance 10.

FEATURES OF HAMMERGRIM

Hammergrim is an immense fortress with windowless walls a mile

thick. Inside, its halls ring with the blows of weapon- and armor-

smiths, who are known as among the  nest on all the planes.

Deep Duerra: The Queen of the Invisible Arts has her own hall

in Hammergrims vast courtyard. Her realm is called the Citadel

of Thought.

Laduguer:  The  Gray  Protectors  hall  within  Hammergrim  is

known as Forgegloom. Its walls are built of armor pieces, shields,

swords,  axes,  and  other  martial  debris.  It  has  no  doors  or  other

means of entrance unless Laduguer wills it.

Urdlen: The gnome deity Urdlen tunnels through the ground of

Hammergrim,  completely  unconcerned  with  his  petitioners,  who

dig in the tunnels he leaves behind. The evil gnome petitioners who

follow Urdlen have no society whatsoever; they simply pursue their

own greed in the ore-rich earth below the duergar fortress-plane.

desert winds grind stone into sand.

HELIOPOLIS TRAITS

Heliopolis has the following traits.

?Enhanced  magic.  Within  Sets  realm  of  Ankhwugaht,  spells

from  the  school  of  necromancy  are  empowered  and  extended,

applied,  though  they  do  not  require  higher-level  spell  slots  or

longer than normal casting times. This effect does not extend to

the rest of the plane.

HELIOPOLIS LINKS

No known portals exist on Heliopolis.

HELIOPOLIS INHABITANTS

A variety of creatures native to other planes make homes in He-

liopolis as well. Lillends serve some of the good deities of the plane,

as do angels. In Sets realm of Ankhwugaht, diverse creatures such

as  chaos  beasts,  howlers,  night  hags,  and  yeth  hounds  haunt  the

dark wilderness.

Heliopolis Petitioners: Almost all the petitioners of Heliopolis

are  Mulhorandi  in  origin.  They  appear  as  they  did  in  life,  at

their healthiest and most robust. They have the following special

qualities.

Additional Immunities: Acid, sonic.

Resistances: Cold 10, electricity 10.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF HELIOPOLIS

Heliopolis is an arid realm, irrigated only by the River Isis that

 ows through it. Beyond the rivers immediate vicinity, the land

is  sandy  desert.  Great  monumentspyramids,  sphinxes,  obelisks,

temples,  and  mausoleumsdot  the  landscape  across  the  entire

plane, and the seats of the many divine realms are the greatest of

these monuments.

Anhur: Netaph is Anhurs realm. Its placement on the border

between the fertile valley and the dry desert suggests that it guards

the  populace  against  threats  from  the  wilderness.  Anhurs  great

temple-palace stands at the very center of the realm.

Geb: The mountain range that rises in the middle of the desert

is the source of rock for all the planes monuments. Gebs realm is

here, and his palace stands in the Caverns under the Stars, a great

cave complex at the roots of the mountains. His petitioners mine

the mountains for precious gems and cut stone for monuments.

Hathor: The Nurturing Mothers realm is a village within the

fertile valley called Succor. In this place of refuge and peace, chil-

dren and mothers are protected from all danger. If the matriarchs

of Succor, or Hathor herself, swear their protection to any visitor,

no harm can come to that creature as long as it remains in Succor.

Despite a regular in ux of refugees seeking sanctuary, Succor re-

mains a quiet town.

Horus-Re:  The  Lord  of  the  Suns  realm  is  actually  the  sky

above the plane, since he pilots his solar barge across the sky every

day. His petitioners live in the city of Thekele-Re, which is one of

the few settlements that thrives beyond the fertile valley of the

River Isis.

Isis: Not far from Succor lies the city of Gizekhtet, also known

as  Quietude  or  the  City  of  Moderation,  where  Isis  makes  her

home. The petitioners here embrace balance and moderation in

all matters. The River Isis  ows right through the center of the

town, bestowing its blessings on the  elds and the people alike.

The land around the city is the most fertile and lush anywhere

in Heliopolis.

Nephthys: The realm of Amun-thys belongs to Nephthys. It lies

in the fertile valley but is not well cultivated. It holds more tombs

and temples than houses or  elds, and these resting places for the

dead are rumored to hold great riches.

Osiris:  The  realm  of  Osiris,  called  Memphiria,  is  a  great  ne-

cropolis in the midst of the desert. Rows of mausoleums surround

the gods great sepulcher, and his petitioners walk the streets in the

form of corporeal undead, even though they are never evil.

Thoth: The Lord of Magics realm, the city of Thebestys, lies

in a marshy area on the banks of the River Isis. This magni cent

city holds the Great Library, which is perhaps the most extensive

collection of knowledge outside the House of Knowledge. Thoths

estate includes the city and several smaller villages in the wetlands.

All who seek knowledge are welcome here.

Set: The dark realm of Set, known as Ankhwugaht, is a region of

desert that is completely closed to Horus-Res light and goodness.

Harsh winds blow across its poisonous sands, serpents hiss in the

endless night, and  endish monstrous scorpions devour any who

dare to trespass here. A great black pyramid rises high above the

desert  sands,  seeming  almost  to  scrape  the  blood-streaked  mid-

night sky.

Sebek: The Lord of Crocodiles has no realm in Heliopolis. He

spends  much  of  his  time  on  Toril,  and  the  rest  lurking  in  Sets

realm.

The House of Knowledge

Contrary to its name, the House of Knowledge is a wilderness of

ancient oaks and clear blue pools. At night, dancing constellations

of burning stars  ll the sky, and the music of harps echoes though

the  lonely  wood.  The  plane  is  dedicated  to  the  preservation  and

transmission  of  all  kinds  of  knowledgenot  just  ancient  secrets

in dusty scrolls, but the living knowledge of song and story, the

blessing  of  speech,  and  the  understanding  that  comes  from  deep

familiarity with other living creatures.

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE TRAITS

The House of Knowledge has the following traits.

?Divinely morphic.

?Mildly good-aligned.

?Enhanced  magic.  All  divination  spells  cast  in  the  House  of

Knowledge  are  extended  as  if  the  Extend  Spell  feat  had  been

applied,  though  they  do  not  occupy  higher-level  spell  slots  or

require longer than normal casting times.

HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE LINKS

Gond maintains a portal from Wonderhome to the Mithral Forge,

Flandal  Steelskins  domain  in  the  Golden  Hills.  The  House  of

Knowledge  is  connected  to  the  World  Trees  trunk,  and  through

the tree to the rest of the celestial planes.

HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE INHABITANTS

Aside from petitioners, the angels who serve the good deities of the

plane are the only native inhabitants.

Fiend Folio: Kuldurath, rilmani (all).

House of Knowledge Petitioners: The petitioners of the House of

Knowledge include former sages, bards, artisans, and loremasters. They

appear as they did in life and have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, polymorph.

Resistances: Acid 10.

Other Special Q ualities: As a special property of the plane, these

petitioners retain all of their Craft, Knowledge, and Perform skills,

though  they  do  not  retain  other  memories  of  their  lives.  Thus,

many of them possess knowledge without context.

FEATURES OF THE HOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE

The Library of All Knowledge is housed in several buildings scat-

tered  throughout  the  plane.  Together,  these  buildings  hold  every

spell, magic item, song, and fact about the entire universe. While

Oghma, Milil, Deneir, and Gond each favor certain buildings over

others, they do not have separate realms (as much as Gond might

like to have his own).

Gond: Wonderhome is the Wonderbringers favorite portion of

the library, and the nearest thing to a distinct realm that exists on

this plane. Wonderhome is a great workshop full of inventions

some known in Faern, and many more still undiscovered.

Oghma: The Lord of Knowledge maintains three springs that are

scattered throughout the woods, though they change location at his

whim. Any creature that drinks water fresh from any of these springs

receives the bene t of a heal spell. Each spring also has a unique ad-

ditional power. The Spring of Knowledge answers one question for

the imbiber, as if she had cast a commune spell. The Pool of Music

gives the drinker a +20 bonus on the next Perform check she makes

within one tenday of drinking from it. The Spring of Poetry grants

the imbiber the bene t of a tongues spell that lasts for 48 hours.

The House of Nature

Similar  to  Arvandor,  the  House  of  Nature  is  a  vast  expanse  of

natural wilderness. No building or craft spoils the pure beauty of

nature  here,  and  no  divine  palace  or  carved  hall  rises  above  the

trees or delves beneath the mountains. Animals roam unfettered

across the plane, sharing its bounty with the petitioners in peaceful

coexistence.

HOUSE OF NATURE TRAITS

The House of Nature has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Enhanced  magic.  Druid  spells  are  enlarged  and  extended  as

though the Enlarge Spell and Extend Spell feats had been ap-

plied, though they do not require higher-level spell slots or longer

than normal casting times.

HOUSE OF NATURE LINKS

The deities of the House of Nature cooperate to maintain a portal

to Arvandor. In addition, Nobanions realm contains a permanent

portal to the Gulthmere Forest in the Dragon Coast.

HOUSE OF NATURE INHABITANTS

The celestial race of guardinals is native to the House of Nature.

The animalistic character of these creatures exempli es the har-

mony of good and nature found throughout the plane.

Manual of the Planes: Bariaur, wood element creatures.

Fiend Folio: Fhorge.

House of Nature Petitioners: Most of the petitioners of the House

of Nature are humanoids, who live in small communities in utter

harmony with nature. They never build, cut stone or wood, or oth-

erwise alter the natural beauty of the plane. Though they appear

as  they  did  in  life  upon  arrival,  they  gradually  take  on  animal

traitstheir hair grows long in lustrous pelts, short horns sprout

from their foreheads, and some develop cats eyes or foxs ears. Over

the  course  of  centuries,  they  become  celestial  animals.  House  of

Nature petitioners have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, poison.

Resistances: Cold 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Fast healing 2.

FEATURES OF THE HOUSE OF NATURE

A  great  many  deities  reside  in  the  House  of  Nature,  including

Chauntea, Eldath, Gwaeron, Lathander, Lurue, Mielikki, Noban-

ion, Shiallia, Silvanus, and Ubtao. In addition, guardinal paragons

in great numberfar more than the Five Companions detailed in

Book of Exalted Deedshave the status of near-deities here, serv-

ing as patrons of speci c kinds of animals. By their very nature,

the realms of these deities and near-deities have  uid boundaries,

and one is often hard to distinguish from another.

Chauntea:  The  Great  Mothers  Garden  is  Chaunteas  realm,

though its name is something of a misnomer. The land is not

cultivated,  but  food  plants  grow  here  as  they  do  in  nature,  in

vast, abundant  elds that nurture thousands of different kinds

of plants.

Lathander: The realm called Morninglory belongs to Lathander.

Its natural beauty is tinted with the colors of dawnrubies, crim-

sons, scarlets, yellows, and pinks. A small mountain lake bordered

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

by a meadow and a stand of tall timber form Lathanders cathe-

dral here. Sleep spells and similar effects do not function within

Lathanders domain, and characters who rest here  nd themselves

fully refreshed in half the usual time.

Silvanus:  In  the  deepest  reaches  of  the  House  of  Nature,  the

vegetation grows thick. Here in the Oak Fathers realm, known as

the Deep Forest, grow the greatest of all trees. The canopy of their

leaves is so dense that it seems all light must surely be blotted out.

Eldath: The realm of the Goddess of the Singing Waters is called

the True Grove. It is marked by a ring of tall oaks surrounding

a  burbling  spring,  though  none  of  these  features  constitutes  an

actual boundary.

Mielikki:  The  Grove  of  the  Unicorns  is  the  Forest  Queens

realm. This stand of trees is unremarkable in itself but notable for

the celestial chargers and more mundane unicorns that frequent

the place.

Lurue/Gwaeron Windstrom: These two allies of Mielikki have no

realms in the House of Nature, but both wander freely both here

and throughout Faern.

Shiallia: The Dancer in the Glades has her own realm, adjacent

to the Grove of the Unicorns, called the High Glade.

Nobanion: The vast savanna known as the Pridelands is Noban-

ions realm. Unlike humanoid petitioners, his wemic followers retain

their mortal forms here. Groves of trees dot this great plain, and

one of them contains a permanent portal to the Gulthmere Forest

in the Dragon Coast.

Ubtao: The Labyrinth of Life, a mazelike jungle teeming with

life in the warmest region of the House of Nature, serves as Ubtaos

domain. In the midst of this vibrant rain forest rises the Forbidden

Plateau, where dinosaurs roam apart from all the other animals of

the plane.

The House of the Triad

A resplendent plane of majestic marble halls, gleaming palaces, and

heavenly radiance, the House of the Triad is the closest thing to

a heaven in Torils cosmology. Law holds slightly more sway here

than  good,  thanks  to  the  presence  of  Helm  and  Siamorphe,  but

most of the plane still exempli es the principles of good upheld by

law and order.

HOUSE OF THE TRIAD TRAITS

The House of the Triad has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Strongly law-aligned and mildly good-aligned.

HOUSE OF THE TRIAD LINKS

There are no known portals leading to or from the House of the

Triad. However, lower branches of the World Tree extend into this

plane, connecting it with the other celestial planes.

HOUSE OF THE TRIAD INHABITANTS

The archons, celestial embodiments of law and good, call the House

of the Triad home. Most live on the great mountain called Celestia,

but many serve Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr and dwell in their realms.

Angels serve the Triad as well, undertaking the lions share of mis-

sions to other planes. Formians inhabit the plane and serve both

Helm  and  Siamorphe  when  needed,  though  in  general  they  live

their ordered lives without divine disruption.

House  of  the  Triad  Petitioners:  Most  of  the  petitioners  of  the

House of the Triad are lantern archons, which are fully detailed in

the Monster Manual. These petitioners have no planar commit-

ment and can leave the House of the Triad at will. Those who serve

Helm or Siamorphe, or otherwise lean more toward neutrality than

good,  retain  the  forms  they  wore  in  life  and  have  the  following

special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, petri cation.

Resistances: None.

Other Special Q ualities: Damage reduction 10/chaotic.

FEATURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE TRIAD

The House of the Triad consists of three great mountains encircl-

ing a still-greater one. The central mountain, Celestia, is something

like a divine realm in itself, though no deity resides there. Divided

into seven layers, it exactly mirrors the plane of Celestia described

in  Manual  of  the  Planes  and  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide,  and

it  is  the  home  of  the  archons  and  the  archon  paragons  detailed

in Book of Exalted Deeds. The relationship between the archons

(particularly  the  paragons)  and  the  deities  who  maintain  realms

on the plane is not exactly clear. On the surface, it seems that the

archons serve the deities, and do so happily. Some have speculated,

however, that not even Tyr knows what lies within Zaphkiels Il-

luminated Heaven, though he seems to regard the mountain with

a great deal of respect.

The three mountains surrounding Celestia are crowned by the

realms of Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. The realms of Helm and Siamor-

phe lie around the bases of the mountains.

Helm: The domain of Helm, which is called Everwatch, seems to

move around the planes four great mountains. Any time a portal

opens in the House of the Triad from any other plane (including

color pools from the Astral Plane), Everwatch is therea watch-

tower manned by a forbidding guardian covered from head to toe in

mithral full plate armor. This guardian, whose name and nature are

unknown, unfailingly detects alignment and senses the purpose of

visitors to the plane. It can call Torms heavenly hosts in an instant

in the case of an invasion. Of course, Helm also lives within the

tower of Everwatch and is well equipped to deal with any threat.

Ilmater: Ilmaters realm, the mountain known as Martyrdom,

has a great, open-air temple at its heart. Here the petitioners of

Ilmater are rewarded in death for their endurance and perseverance

in lifeand in many cases, for their deaths as martyrs. No creature

in Martyrdom can feel any pain, fatigue, or exhaustion. Ilmaters

realm is a place of comfort and rest, known by planar travelers as

one of the most soothing spots on the planes.

Torm: The True Deitys realm is the mountain called Trueheart,

and his palace, located at the heart of the realm, resembles a mili-

tary fortress. Its walls are mithral, its battlements diamond, and its

gates adamantine. Hosts of archons and angels  y in and out of this

fortress at Torms command, serving the causes of law and good on

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

the Outer Planes. These servitors are particularly vigilant against

the plans of Bane.

Tyr: The Court crowns the third mountain in the ring around

Celestia. Tyr supervises the Court from a great marble hall very

much like a court of law. No lie can be spoken within this realm,

and Bluff checks automatically fail. Ilmater and Torm frequently

come to the Court to consult with the Maimed God.

Siamorphe: The realm of Siamorphe is nestled in a lush valley

between the Court and Celestia. Her Alabaster Palace is situated on

perfectly manicured grounds surrounded by sparkling fountains and

exquisite topiaries, and the squawking of peacocks rings through the

valley.

Jotunheim

Since  Jotunheim  is  the  land  of  giants,  it  stands  to  reason  that

everything  there  is  large.  Forests  of  pines  as  thick  as  watchtow-

ers cover the sides of the vast mountains of the plane. Rocs soar

through the skies, and winter wolves the size of elephants prowl

the frozen wastes.

JOTUNHEIM TRAITS

Jotunheim has the following traits.

?Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

?Mild faith.

?Surtrs realm is  re-dominant. Thryms has a special cold-domi-

nant trait. Each creature in his realm takes 3d10 points of cold

damage in each round that it lacks shelter of some kind.

JOTUNHEIM LINKS

Surtr maintains at least one portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire

within his  ery realm of Muspelheim.

JOTUNHEIM INHABITANTS

The native fauna of Jotunheim are unusually large but otherwise

normal  animals  and  magical  beasts.  Most  creatures  encountered

here  are  at  least  one  size  category  larger  than  normal,  with  all

the  attendant  changes  in  statistics  (see  page  291  of  the  Monster

Manual).

Fiend Folio: Fensir.

Jotunheim  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  Jotunheim  were  all

giants in life, and they retain their mortal forms here. They have

the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold,  re.

Resistances: Acid 10, electricity 10.

Other Special Q ualities: As a special property of the plane, these

giant petitioners retain more of their Hit Dice than most petition-

ers do. A Large giant petitioner has 4 HD, and a Huge one has 8

HD.

FEATURES OF JOTUNHEIM

Jotunheim, like many other planes in Torils cosmology, is an end-

less  expanse  of  wilderness,  dotted  with  structures,  menhirs,  and

other signs of giant civilizationor at least habitation. Its terrain

tends  to  extremesvolcanoes,  glaciers,  majestic  cloudscapes,  and

equally grand caverns resplendent with crystal formations. Jotun-

heim is the home of the giant deities, each of whom has a divine

realm here.

Annam: The reclusive head of the giant pantheon, Annam sits

alone in an endless domain called the Hidden Realm. This area is

rather like a demiplane or pocket dimension in that no other being

can  locate  or  enter  it  without  Annams  permission,  and  Annam

permits precious few visitors. No other beingsnot even petition-

erslive within the Hidden Realm, and a deep sense of loneliness

permeates the place. His great mansion features a crystal tower in

which models of stars and planets whirl in perfect, silent motion,

simulating the movements of the universe.

Grolantor: The god of the hill giants has a small realm located

in the foothills of the great mountains of Jotunheim. Called the

Steading, this realm is little more than an enormous wooden house

built for the greatest chief of the hill giants. Grolantors petitioners

roam the hills all around the Steading, preying on other petitioners

when they can catch them.

Hiatea: Woodhaven is Hiateas realm, located in the heart of a

great forest where oak trees grow larger than terrestrial redwoods.

There her petitioners hunt with their patron, returning in the eve-

nings to great longhouses where her gift of community and family

is celebrated every night.

Ialannis: The realm of Ialannis is Florallium, a place of quiet

gardens and crystal springs. By unspoken consent, Florallium has

become neutral territory for the deities and petitioners of Jotun-

heim, a place where peace can be negotiated in times of con ict and

joyful occasions can be celebrated in quieter times.

Memnor: Memnors realm is Thraotor, an enormous thunder-

head with a great palace of adamantine at its highest point, miles

above the ground. Thraotor  oats across the landscape, bringing

destructive  storms  wherever  it  goes.  At  a  whim,  Memnor  can

turn the ordinary rain or hail beneath his realm into a storm of

vengeance effect.

Skoraeus  Stonebones:  Like  Thrym,  Skoraeus  Stonebones  wan-

ders the mountains of Jotunheim but has no  xed dwelling. He

favors the roots of the mountains and the great caverns that yawn

within them.

Surtr:  Beyond  a  barrier  of  ever-active  volcanoes  lies  Surtrs

realm,  which  is  known  as  Muspelheim.  This  enormous  plain  of

burning earth stretches farther than the eye can see in all direc-

tions. At the shores of a lake of molten lead looms the Spire of

Surtra towering needle of dark stone in which the ruler of all

 re giants sits in state.

Thrym:  At  Jotunheims  opposite  end  is  Thryms  realm,  which

is called Fibulwinter, or sometimes simply Jotunheim. A region of

endless frost, snow, and ice, Thryms realm is more mountainous

than similar divine realms (such as Loviatars and Aurils). Thrym

wanders from glacier to glacier but does not maintain a permanent

palace anywhere in the plane.

Stronmaus: Stormhold, the realm of Stronmaus, is the mirror

image of Thraotor. Despite its ominous name, Stormhold rests on

a magni cent white cloud that only rarely brings rain or storms to

the land beneath. Though it casts an enormous shadow on the land,

160

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

the sun always shines brightly at its top, glittering on Stronmauss

palace of gold, platinum, gems, and marble. Within the palace is a

magical opal pool, which seems to be of endless size to swimmers

in its holy waters. Immersion in the waters of this pool grants the

effects of the heal, greater restoration, and regeneration spells.

Vaprak the Destroyer: The ogre deity lives in Shatterstone, a piti-

ful cave at the base of a great cliff. Vaprak and his petitioners are

despised by all the other inhabitants of the plane, and they hide

from the giants at all costs.

The Nine Hells

Nine  layers  of  embodied  evilgreat  realms  of  tyranny,  hatred,

and destructioncomprise the Nine Hells. In stark contrast to the

Abyss, this plane is a place of  erce regimentation in which the

resident devils carry out well-ordered lives and take pains to conceal

their endless schemes of betrayal and assassination.

Though the plane has nine layers, travelers always enter through

the top layer, Avernus, unless they use a portal that links to some

other speci c layer. Avernus abuts Blood Rift and is therefore is the

staging point for all of the devils campaigns against their demonic

enemies in the Blood War.

NINE HELLS TRAITS

The Nine Hells has the following traits.

4Alterable morphic.

4No elemental or energy traits. Elemental and energy in uences

are balanced, except on the layer of Phlegethod, which has the

 re-dominant trait. The layer of Cania is bitterly cold and has a

special cold-dominant trait. A creature there takes 3d10 points of

cold damage each round that it lacks shelter of some kind.

4Mildly law-aligned and mildly evil-aligned.

NINE HELLS LINKS

Portals to the Barrens of Doom and Despair are all too common

within  the  Nine  Hells.  Both  Maglubiyet  and  Kurtulmak  main-

tains planes that connect Clangor with the Nine Hells. The plane

is also coterminous with Blood Rift, an arrangement that allows

the legions of Avernus to march into eternal battle with their de-

monic foes. The River of Blood  ows through Avernus, and both

offshoots and tributaries of that foul stream appear on all nine

layers of this plane.

NINE HELLS INHABITANTS

The most numerous inhabitants of the Nine Hells are devils, but

the place is also home to hell hounds, night hags, nighmares, hell-

wasp swarms, and creatures unknown to the sages of Faernsuch

as giant maggotlike  ends, strange creatures with many mouths,

eyes, and limbs, and even more bizarre and horrible monsters.

Fiend Folio: Bonespear, gathra, haraknin (canomorph), hell re

golem, imps (all), maelephant.

Nine Hells Petitioners: The only petitioners found on the Nine

Hells are those stolen or lured there by devils doing their work on

the Fugue Plane. Souls brought to the Nine Hells become lemures,

which appear as revolting blobs of molten  esh with vaguely hu-

manoid torsos and heads. Lemures are despised by all other devils,

though  a  few  might  be  destined  for  promotion  into  some  other

form of devil. Lemures are mindless, though they are sensitive to

telepathic messages from other devils. They obey the mental com-

mands of the strongest devil in closest proximity to them. Lemures

have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Fire, poison.

Resistances: Acid 10, cold 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Mindless, damage reduction 5/silver or

good, spell resistance 5, no planar commitment.

Mindless  (Ex):  Lemures  are  immune  to  all  mind-in uencing

effects. Unless commanded, they behave as if under the in uence

of a feeblemind spell.

No  Planar  Commitment  (Ex):  Unlike  most  other  petitioners,

lemures can leave their home plane.

FEATURES OF THE NINE HELLS

The nine layers of this plane are detailed in the Dungeon Masters

Guide and Manual of the Planes. The Nine Hells encompasses no

divine realms, and no deities make their homes here. However, each

layer is ruled by an archdevil, and a few of these creatures certainly

rival minor deities in power.

Nishrek

Nishrek  is  the  home  plane  of  the  orc  pantheon.  On  this  great

battle eld, orc warriors clash nightly in devastating con ict, only

to rise again the next night to  ght again. Different tribes of orc

petitioners wage endless war upon each other, foregoing alliances

and diplomacy in favor of eternal carnage. By proving themselves

in battle, the orcs hope to win the favor of Gruumsh, who they

believe will one day identify a single tribe as his true children and

declare its members superior to all other orcs.

NISHREK TRAITS

Nishrek has the following traits.

4Alterable morphic. Each divine realm is divinely morphic.

4Mildly evil-aligned.

4Strong  faith.  Followers  of  the  dwarf  and  elf  pantheons  take

greater penalties here.

4Minor  positive-dominant.  Nishrek  is  not  a  place  where  many

things can live, but those who battle on its killing  elds are suf-

fused with positive energy. Every creature on the plane gains fast

healing 2 and can even regrow lost limbs in time. Additionally,

those slain in the never-ending con icts on Nishreks battle elds

rise each sunset fully healed and ready to  ght anew, as if they

had received the bene t of a true resurrection spell. Even peti-

tioners, who as outsiders cannot normally be resurrected, awaken

fully healed. Only those who suffer mortal wounds on Nishreks

battle elds  get  the  true  resurrection  effect;  dead  characters

brought to this plane dont spontaneously revive.

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

NISHREK LINKS

The River of Blood  ows through Nishrek, linking it with most of

the other  endish planes. In addition, Blood Rift often comes into

contact with Nishrek, allowing one endless war to spill out into the

midst of another.

NISHREK INHABITANTS

Hellwasps  are  said  to  be  native  to  Nishrek,  though  they  are

common on other  endish planes as well. Swarms of the creatures

are among the few distractions that can gain the temporary atten-

tion of Nishreks armies.

Nishrek  Petitioners:  Most  petitioners  of  Nishrek  are  orcs  and

half-orcs,  which  retain  their  earthly  appearances.  They  have  the

following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: Cold, electricity.

Resistances: Acid 10,  re 10.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF NISHREK

Nishrek is an endless plain dotted with fortresses and crisscrossed

with trenches in which whole communities of orc petitioners have

sprung up. The soldiers inhabiting these wretched settlements spend

their time awaiting the next assault from an enemy tribe.

Gruumsh/Bahgtru/Ilneval:  Gruumsh  watches  over  the  endless

battles on this plane from his Iron Fortress. Within its walls, any

orc or orc petitioner gains damage reduction 25/ and spell resis-

tance 30. Gruumsh often wanders the battle elds, aiding one side or

another apparently at his whim. The orcs are happy to return the

favor by occasionally seeking shelter within his fortress because of

its supreme defensive bene ts. Sometimes the god allows an army

to take cover in his fortress; sometimes he does not. Bahgtru and

Ilneval live in Gruumshs Iron Fortress as well. These two deities

 ght beside Gruumsh or at his bidding.

Luthic:  The  Cave  Mother  dwells  in  a  great  cavern  below  the

Iron Fortress, along with the female petitioners of the plane. The

females do not participate in the endless warfare above ground, but

they do sometimes tend to the wounded in the short time that it

takes them to recover.

Shargaas: In a gigantic cavern system elsewhere in Nishrek lives

Shargaas. Called the Night Below, this cavern realm is so dark that

no creature can see within its blackness. Since Shargaas and all his

petitioners have blindsight, however, they can function normally

within its depths.

Yurtrus:  Fleshslough,  a  mighty  hill  standing  above  the  great

battle elds, is the realm of Yurtrus. The petitioners of Nishrek

whisper that orcs who  ght poorly in the nightly battles are sent

by Gruumsh to Fleshslough, where Yurtrus frees their spirits from

their   esh.  This  process  represents  the  only  meaningful  death

on Nishrek, and thus it is the one that all orcs fear more than

anything.

Shadow

Coterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane, Torils

Plane of Shadow is more than just a transitive plane. While it

can  be  used  for  travel,  it  is  also  the  home  of  two  Faernian

deities, and thus it has some of the characteristics of an Outer

Plane.  It  also  holds  conduits  similar  to  those  found  on  the

Astral  Plane  that  link  Toril  with  other  Material  Planes  and

other worlds.

SHADOW TRAITS

The Plane of Shadow has the following traits.

4Magically morphic. Spells such as shadow conjuration and shadow

evocation modify the base material of the Plane of Shadow. The

utility  and  power  of  these  spells  within  the  Plane  of  Shadow

make  them  particularly  useful  for  explorers  and  natives  alike.

The Plane of Shadow is also divinely morphic, allowing the dei-

ties who dwell there to shape their realms by mere force of will.

4Mildly evil-aligned.

4Mild faith within divine realms; no faith trait elsewhere.

4Enhanced  magic.  Spells  with  the  shadow  descriptor  are  maxi-

mized,  as  though  the  Maximize  Spell  feat  had  been  applied,

though  they  do  not  require  higher-level  spell  slots  or  longer

than  normal  casting  times.  Furthermore,  speci c  spells  are

more powerful on the Plane of Shadow than they are elsewhere.

Shadow  conjuration  and  shadow  evocation  spells  are  30%  as

powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as op-

posed to 20%). Greater shadow conjuration and greater shadow

evocation are 70% as powerful as the originals (not 60%), and

a  shades  spell  is  90%  as  powerful  as  the  original  (not  80%).

4Furthermore,  within  the  divine  realm  of  Shar,  all  enchant-

ment, illusion, and necromancy spells, as well as spells with the

darkness descriptor, that are cast by characters with the Shadow

Weave Magic feat are maximized and extended, as though the

that produce light, are one-half normal on the Plane of Shadow.

4Within the divine realm of Shar, evocation and transmutation

spells are impeded, and spells with the light descriptor do not

function at all.

SHADOW LINKS

As a transitive plane, the Plane of Shadow is much like one in nite

link.  Travelers  can  enter  it  from  the  Material  Plane  by  casting

shadow  walk,  or  draw  its  substance  into  the  Material  Plane  by

means  of  any  illusion  (shadow)  spell.  The  Plane  of  Shadow  does

not  connect  to  the  Ethereal  Plane,  but  it  does  lead  to  alternate

Material Planes.

SHADOW INHABITANTS

The Plane of Shadow is home to a variety of foul creatures of dark-

ness. Nightshades, undead shadows, and shadow mastiffs are among

the  native  monsters  of  the  plane.  The  ancient  Netherese  city  of

Shade sojourned in the Plane of Shadow long enough to spawn a

new race, the shades (detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting), and some of these creatures remained in the plane even

after the citys return to Faern.

Manual of the Planes: Ephemera (all), shadow creature.

Fiend Folio: Darkweaver, shadar-kai, shadurakul (canomorph).

Shadow Petitioners: Petitioners of Shar and Mask that come to

the Plane of Shadow look much as they did in life, though their

coloration is darker. They have the following special qualities.

Additional Immunities: None.

Resistances: Cold 10.

Other  Special  Q ualities:  Darkvision  120  ft.,  low-light  vision,

shadow blend.

Shadow Blend (Su): In any conditions other than full daylight,

the petitioner can disappear into the shadows, gaining a high degree

of concealment (40% miss chance and a +10 circumstance bonus on

Hide checks). Arti cial illumination, even a light or continual  ame

spell, does not negate this ability, though a daylight spell does.

FEATURES OF SHADOW

Most  regions  of  the  Plane  of  Shadow  correspond  exactly  to  the

descriptions in the Manual of the Planes and the Dungeon Masters

Guide. Only the realms of Mask and Shar are exceptions.

Mask: Shadow Keep, a small castle built of raw shadowstuff, is

Masks realm. The castle is swathed in shadows and almost impos-

sible to see, even up close, against the background darkness of the

plane. Only a daylight spell or a spell of similar power can make

the castle stand out enough to be visible. Mask spends little time

even in this excellent hideout, however, because he prefers to move

about the planes, thieving and engaging in endless divine intrigue.

Shar: The Mistress of Night dwells in the Palace of Loss, a single

tower without windows or doors. Few visitors can  gure out how

to gain entry or exit, but Shars petitioners and servants can come

and go as they please. The only creatures con ned to the palace are

those who would miss their freedom the most. This arrangement

allows Shar to savor their pain more keenly.

The Supreme Throne

A ruined castle rises above a desolate landscape where the winds

howls can drive one mad. This plane is the realm of the Prince of

Liesthe  supreme  throne  from  which  Cyric  plans  to  rule  all

the planes. The Supreme Throne is as mad as the god himself and

nearly as evil. Because the laws of nature and magic follow Cyrics

ever-changing whims, the plane itself often seems bent on crush-

ing intruders, particularly those who refuse to bow before the one

ruler of this plane.

SUPREME THRONE TRAITS

SUPREME THRONE LINKS

The Supreme Throne has no known portals to other planes.

SUPREME THRONE INHABITANTS

The  inhabitants  of  the  Supreme  Throne  are  as  mad  as  its  ruler.

Howlers are the favorite creatures of Cyric, and packs of them roam

within and just outside his Shattered Castle. Chaos beasts and slaadi

also inhabit the Supreme Throne.

Fiend Folio: Demodands (all).

Supreme  Throne  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  the  Supreme

Throne appear much as they did in life, though they are bonier and

generally appear more drawn. Their madness is generally plain to

see in their eyes. They have the following special petitioner traits.

Additional Immunities: Electricity, sonic.

Resistances: Acid 10, cold 10.

Other Special Q ualities: None.

FEATURES OF THE SUPREME THRONE

The only feature of note here is Cyrics castle.

Cyric: The Shattered Castle is Cyrics seat of power. Though it

is nothing more than a crumbling ruin yanked from some other

plane, the Prince of Lies sees it as a magni cent palace be tting his

position as future ruler of the universe. Howlers roam its courtyard

and the blasted lands around it, while Cyric himself sits in its high-

est tower, hatching his mad schemes for planar domination.

Warriors Rest

The  raging  chaos  of  Warriors  Rest  erupts  in  constant  battles,

random shifts of terrain, and equally wild shifts in battle eld loyal-

ties. Like Clangor and Nishrek, Warriors Rest is full of petitioners

waging war upon each other. Unlike the situation on those planes,

however, the petitioners of Warriors Rest have no constant loyalty,

no single af liation, and no immunity to death. They do regenerate

like trolls, and one of the only rules of the constant engagement

is that when a warrior falls and rises again, he joins the team that

brought him down.

WARRIORS REST TRAITS

Warriors rest has the following traits.

4Highly morphic. Warriors Rest is constantly changing, though

not to the same degree as the plane of Limbo in the D&D cos-

mology. A given area can react to speci c spells or to force of

will. Left alone, it shifts slowly but continually. (See Controlling

Warriors Rest, below, for more information.)

4Mildly  chaos-aligned.  The  Red  Knights  petitioners,  the  only

lawful creatures on the plane, take some social penalties.

4Divinely morphic.

4Strongly chaos-aligned and mildly evil-aligned.

4Strong faith. All deities are the enemies of Cyric, so the follow-

ers  of  all  other  deities  take  greater  penalties  in  the  Supreme

Throne.

4Wild magic.

12/19/03, 3:05:00 PM

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

The basic terrain of Warriors Rest is similar to an area of rocky

badlands on the Material Plane. A creature with a high Wisdom

score can shape the terrain nearby, bringing speci c features into

being in order to provide cover or other advantages in battle. A

character can exert control over an area with a radius of 5 feet per

point of Wisdom bonus, centered on herself. Within this area, she

can use a full-round action to attempt to create or remove one of

the following terrain features. The DC for the required Wisdom

check is indicated in each entry.

Berm: Creating or removing a berm (see page 91 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide) requires a DC 22 Wisdom check.

Bridge: A character can create or remove a bridge of rock 5 feet

wide with a DC 22 Wisdom check. A 10-foot-wide bridge requires

a DC 25 Wisdom check.

Chasm: Creating or removing a chasm 50 feet deep, 20 feet long,

and 15 feet wide (see page 89 in the Dungeon Masters Guide) re-

quires a DC 20 Wisdom check. A 100-foot-deep chasm requires a

DC 25 check.

Elevation: The character can cause an area equal to or smaller

than her zone of control to rise above or sink below the surround-

ing terrain. Cliffs (Climb DC 15) surround the raised or lowered

area. The Wisdom DC is 15 + 2 per 10 feet of elevation.

Rubble: Creating or removing light rubble (see page 91 in the

Dungeon Masters Guide) requires a DC 18 Wisdom check. Dense

rubble increases the DC to 20.

Slope: The character can tilt the land within her zone of control

in any direction she desires, regardless of the surrounding terrain.

The area still merges seamlessly with the ground outside the zone

of control. The Wisdom DC is 15 for a gradual slope (see page 89

of the Dungeon Masters Guide) or 20 for a steep slope.

Trench: A character can create or remove a trench (see page 91

of the Dungeon Masters Guide) within her zone of control. The

Wisdom DC is 12 for a 5-foot-wide trench or 15 for a 10-foot-wide

trench.

WARRIORS REST INHABITANTS

Many titans are native to the plane of Warriors Rest, and they join

in the great melee with delight. The githzerai have built monaster-

ies amid the roiling chaos of the plane. The petitioners rarely dare

to  assault  these  structures  because  of  the  eternal  death  that  the

monks ki strike (lawful) can impart to them.

Fiend Folio: Khaasta.

Warriors  Rest  Petitioners:  The  petitioners  of  Warriors  Rest

are common soldiers, generals, strategists, barbarian raiders, and

other combat-oriented individuals. They appear as they did in the

prime  of  their  lives,  in  the  peak  of  physical  shape  and  glowing

with health. They seek union with their deities by participating in

endless battles.

Additional Immunities: Acid,  re.

Resistances: Cold 10, electricity 10.

Other Special Q ualities: Regeneration 5.

Regeneration  (Ex):  The  petitioners  take  normal  damage  from

lawful weapons. The will of Tempus can negate any petitioners re-

generation ability, and such a punishment is usually the immediate

precursor of a quick and  nal death. This fate is reserved for those

who show cowardice in battle.

FEATURES OF WARRIORS REST

Most of Warriors Rest is an enormous battle eld similar to a rocky

desert on Toril. Mesas and buttes tower above the otherwise  at

land, and outcroppings of rock jut upward in unusual formations.

Garagos: The Reaver proudly proclaims whatever region of the

plane he happens to be on as his own realm of Battle Garde.

The Red Knight: The Lady of Strategy has built a permanent

fortress called the Red Tower in Warriors Rest. It is one of the few

stable and permanent features of the plane, and its terrain cannot

be controlled by any other creature (except Tempus) within a 1-mile

radius of the Tower.

Tempus:  The  entire  plane  of  Warriors  Rest  is  considered  the

divine realm of the Lord of Battles, though he allows the other dei-

ties who live here to shape the plane according to their own desires.

He can always shape it back easily enough if he wishes.

Uthgar: The Battle Father prefers the colder regions of the plane,

which he calls Uthgardtheim. Though cold, these areas are no worse

than winter in the North of Faerna far cry from frigid realms

such as Loviatars or Aurils.

Valkur: The realm of the Captain of the Waves is the only one

that remains separate from the restprimarily because its terrain

is different. Called Safe Harbor, this realm is a placid expanse of

saltwater between the battle eld of the desert and a larger expanse

of water where naval battles rage.

Other Planes

The cosmology detailed in this chapter (and originally presented in

the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting) accounts for the homes

of the deities in the Faernian pantheon, various nonhuman pan-

theons (dragon, giant, goblinoid, orc, drow, dwarven, elven, gnome,

and hal ing), and the Mulhorandi pantheon. Toril is also home to a

number of additional faiths, and the gods of those faiths live in ad-

ditional planes connected to Toril. Little is known in Faern about

most of these planes, and the exact nature of their connection to

Faern is rather mysterious.

Toril actually connects to several different Astral Planes, each

one linking Torils Material Plane to the outer-planar homes of

a different group of deities. These Astral Planes are based on the

geographical  areas  of  control  held  by  the  different  pantheons.

The  Astral  Plane  known  to  characters  in  Faern  leads  to  the

planes  of  the  Faernian  pantheon,  as  well  as  the  nonhuman

pantheons (whose geographical area of control overlaps that of

the Faernian deities) and the Mulhorandi pantheon. Characters

in other areas can enter different Astral Planes with links to the

Outer Planes inhabited by their own deities. Ao is thought to su-

pervise the separate Astral Planes just as he adjudicates con icts

between the pantheons.

ZAKHARAN PLANES

The Astral Plane of Zakhara connects to the same elemental planes

that connect with Faern, as well as to a plane where the souls of

164

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   164

COSMOLOGY OF TORIL

the  righteous  are  rewarded  (the  Garden  of  Delight)  and  one

where the wicked are punished (the Place of Fire). The

many genies that are so active in Zakhara live

on  the  elemental  planes,

while  the  deities  of  the

Zakharan  faiths  live

either  on  the  Material

Plane  in  Zakhara  itself

or  on  some  other  plane

unknown  to  mortals  and

unreachable  from  the

Material Plane.

THE SPIRIT WORLD

The  Spirit  World  described  in  the

Appendix in Manual of the Planes

is coexistent with and coterminous

to the Material Plane, but only in

Kara-Tur. Each deity of Kara-

Turs Celestial Bureaucracy has

a small realm attached to the

Spirit World. Because it is a

transitive plane, the Spirit

World replaces the Astral

Plane in Kara-Tur.

Maztican Planes

The  Astral  Plane  of  Maz-

tica connects to the planes

of  the  Maztican  dei-

ties.  These  planes  can

be  visualized  as  many

planar layers stacked both

above  and  below  the  earth.

Each  celestial  layer  is  the

home  of  a  deity  and  a

sacred  bird;  each  under-

world layer is a challenge for

the souls of the dead, who

must  progress  all  the  way

to the bottom layer to  nd

their  eternal  peace.  These

planes  are  populated  by

outsiders as well as deities.

DEMIPLANES

As  in  the  standard  D&D  cosmology,

the  cosmology  of  Toril  is  rife  with

demiplanessmall,  homogeneous

planes with few inhabitants. Some

of  these  planes  were  created

by  powerful  spellcasters

or psions; others seem

to have formed spon-

taneously.  Both  Cynosure  and  the

Fugue  Plane  might  be  considered

demiplanesin  fact,  Cynosure  is

somewhat  similar  to  Common

Ground, as described in Manual of

the Planes. The Random Demiplane

Generator in Manual of the Planes

works as well for demiplanes in Torils

cosmology  as  it  does  for  the  standard

D&D cosmology, and the example

demiplanes  in  Manual  of  the

Planes  could  also  exist  in  Torils

cosmology. The malaugryms (described

in  Monstrous  Compendium:  Monsters  of

Faern) are native to a small demiplane at-

tached to the Plane of Shadow.

LOST PLANES

When deities or entire pantheons die, the

planes they called home apparently cease to

exist. One theory holds that they simply im-

plode without any divine power to sustain

them.  Another  theory  maintains  that

the Astral Plane expels them, and

they  drift  somehow  outside  it,

severed  from  their  connections

to other planes.

The  largest  of  these  lost

planes  is  Zigguraxus,  former

home of the Untheric pantheon.

With its demise or dis-

appearance,  Tiamat

has  relocated

to

Dragon  Eyrie.  The

planes  and  realms  of

the  dead  gods  have

also  vanished  from

Torils cosmology. These

include  Amaunators

Keep of the Eternal Sun,

Bhaals  Throne  of  Blood,

Ibranduls  Ibrandyllaran,

Leiras  Courts  of  Illusion,

and  Moanders  Offalmound.

Occasionally  a  slain  deitys

realm  is  taken  over  by  an-

other deity before it can vanish.

This  was  the  case  with  Myrkuls

Bone  Castle  on  the  Fugue  Plane,

which  is  now  inhabited  by  Kelem-

vor,  who  transformed  it  into  the

Crystal Spire.

The  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  setting  is  a  dynamic,  ever-

changing backdrop for a campaign. Characters and

their  deeds  do  not  exist  in  a  vacuum,  and  many

events  have  far-reaching  consequences  across  the  length  and

breadth  of  Faern.  Since  the  of cial  campaign  start  date  of

Shieldmeet,  1372  DR,  Faern  has  undergone  countless  changes,

including the siege of the elven city of Evereska by the phaerimms,

the trapping of Elminster in the Hells, and mysterious silence of

the drows dark spider-goddess. This chapter is intended to serve

as an addendum to Chapter 6: History in the FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting. The material presented here brings the timeline

up to the current campaign date of Kythorn 1, 1373 DR (the Year

of Rogue Dragons).

Using the Storyline in

Your Game

The recent events in Anauroch, Cormyr, and the Underdark have

had  several  far-reaching  effects  in  Faern.  The  City  of  Shades

sudden appearance has drastically altered the balance of power on

the surface world, and Lolths silence threatens to do the same to

the Underdark. New foes have arisen, and in some cases, the very

geography of the continent has been altered. Incorporating these

events into your game may seem like a daunting task, but the fol-

lowing notes should give you some ideas on how to go about it.

The  rst and simplest option is to simply have the events occur

off-screen  during  your  campaign,  exactly  as  they  are  described

in this chapter and in the novels concerning them. This method

works  best  if  your  current  game  is  set  somewhere  well  removed

from the events in questionafter all, PCs usually want to partici-

pate in major events that occur in their backyards. But even if you

choose to follow this path, be  exible. If your PCs come up with

some really ingenious (and plausible) means of lifting the siege of

Evereska  or  preventing  the  fall  of  Ched  Nasad,  let  them  try  it.

Otherwise, your players may begin to feel that their characters are

little more than spectators.

If  you  want  to  allow  your  PCs  to  have  some  impact  on  the

storyline, but still have the events happen more or less as described

here, you can design adventures that are tangential to the main

course of events. For example, the PCs might be asked to lead one

of Cormyrs guerrilla attacks against the shades, or they might be

hired on as mercenaries to  ght in the Battle of Ched Nasad. Since

designing a good adventure takes time, though, you might want

to ensure that your campaigns date lags a month or two behind

the  of cial  chronology.  This  tactic  gives  you  enough  lead  time

to design an adventure and insert it smoothly into the course of

campaign events.

Of course, theres no reason you have to stick to the of cial chro-

nology at all. If you feel so inclined, you are perfectly free to recast

the protagonists of the stories as your PCs, or even throw them out

altogether. Maybe in your campaign, Shade has succeeded in send-

ing a few dozen in ltrators from the Shadow Plane into Faern, but

the city itself remains trapped. Or perhaps Corellon Larethian or

Lathander has suddenly gone silent rather than Lolth. Ultimately,

its your game, and you should make whatever changes you think

will make it more fun and exciting for your gaming group.

Recent Events

Although  a  great  number  of  events  have  occurred  in  the  years

since the Shieldmeet of 1372, two have had far more impact on

Toril as a whole than the others. These events are the return of

the City of Shade and the mysterious silence of Lolth, the goddess

of the drow.

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL

Return of the Archwizards

Late in the winter of 1371 DR, the Year of the Unstrung Harp, a

band of Evereskan tomb guardians led by Galaeron Nihmedu dis-

covered a band of humans attempting to dig a tunnel through the

rock wall of an ancient elven burial chamber with the aid of a cap-

tive beholder. The invaders purpose was to reach the Sharn Wall,

the mystical barrier that kept the phaerimms trapped beneath An-

auroch, and rendezvous with a prince of the City of Shade named

Melegaunt  Tanthul.  Due  to  an  unexpected  interaction  between

Galaerons  Weave  magic  and  Melegaunts  Shadow  Weave  magic,

the battle tore a hole in the Sharn Wall, allowing the phaerimms to

break through and enter Faern in great numbers once more.

Galaeron,  Melegaunt,  and  Vala  Thorsdottir,  the  leader  of  the

human group, warned the Hill Elders of Evereska about the

situation, but because they refused to accept Melegaunts

aid, they were unable to repair the Sharn Wall

with their high magic. After the  rst skir-

mish with the phaerimms left the elves of

Evereska  soundly  defeated,  a  request  for

aid  was  dispatched  to  Khelben  Black-

staff Arunsun of Waterdeep.

While Khelben mobilized Waterdeeps

forces  to  come  to  Evereskas  aid,  Ga-

laeron,  Melegaunt,  and  Vala  traveled

to  the  Temple  of  Karse  in  the  High

Forest, seeking the aid that Melegaunt

claimed they could receive from the lich

Wulgreth. The trio battled through the

phaerimms  and  their  thralls  in  the

High Forest, and over the course of the

journey,  Galaeron  began  to  learn  the

mysterious  ways  of  the  Shadow  Weave.

Finally, the three gained access to Karse

and  the  lich  Wulgrethor  rather,  the

liches  Wulgreth.  In  fact,  two  beings  by

that name had established themselves in

Karse  over  the  millennia.  After  battling

the liches, the group succeeded in summon-

ing two of the Princes of Shade and acquiring

the  Karsestone,  a  potent  artifact  of  Netherese

magic  that  Melegaunt  hoped  could  return  Shade  to

Faern.  Although  Melegaunt  himself  was  slain  by  the

second Wulgreth, Galaeron completed the incantation and

summoned the City of Shade back from the Shadow Plane.

Meanwhile,  Khelben  Arunsun  led  a  contingent  of  Waterdha-

vian and elf soldiers to Evereska in hopes of establishing a portal

through  which  to  move  a  larger  army.  The  expedition  suffered

heavy losses in a battle with the phaerimms and their thralls on

the High Moor, but the troops managed to arrive in time to aid

the Swords of Evereska. But the aid came too late, and Rocnest was

lost to the phaerimms. Worse, Aubric Nihmedu, the Blade-Major

of Evereska, was slain during the battle.

167

Return of the

archwizards

Once Shade returned to Faern, the Shadovar acted quickly to

consolidate  their  power  and  oppose  the  phaerimms  that  had  al-

ready laid siege to Evereska. The Princes of Shade  rst used their

shadow magic to create a powerful shell of shadow, which cut off

the  phaerimms  around  Evereska  from  the  magic  of  the  Weave.

Though this tactic weakened the monsters, they were still strong

enough to maintain the wall of dead magic that prevented all com-

munication with Evereska, and the wall itself leached the vitality

out of the lands around the Fortress Home, dangerously weakening

its mythal.

The Shadovar wasted no time securing allies in the war against

the phaerimms, sending emissaries to most of the major powers

in the region. Waterdeep, while suspicious of the Shadovars mo-

tives,  reluctantly  agreed  to  work  with  the  City  of  Shade,  albeit

temporarily. Even the dracolich Malygris, the Blue Suzerain

of  the  Anauroch,  agreed  to  aid  the  City  of  Shade  in

return for freedom from the Cult of the Dragon.

Shade  troops,  moving  through  shadows

with  their  strange  magics,  engaged  the

phaerimms  in  several  skirmishes  and

wonit seemed apparent that Shadow

Weave  magic  was  the  greatest  weak-

ness  of  phaerimms.  Even  when  the

phaerimms attacked the very heart

of  Shade  itself,  the  Shadovars

potent magics defeated them.

The  next  major  engagement  of

the war came at the Winding Water,

when  a  Waterdhavian  relief  army

traveling to Evereska under the com-

mand of Laeral and Storm Silverhand

was ambushed by a force of bugbears,

beholders,  and  mind   ayers  led  by  a

small  group  of  phaerimms.  Though

it  seemed  certain  that  the  Chosen  of

Mystra  would  go  down  in  defeat,  the

Shadovar  called  in  the  services  of  their

ally Malygris, and a Flight of Dragons, led

by the Blue Suzerain himself, descended upon

the phaerimms forces and tore them apart.

At this point, the suspicions the Waterdhavians held

about the Shadovar came to a head, causing the weak alliance

that the cities shared to falter. Brian the Swordmaster, one

of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, insulted Prince Aglarel

of Shade when the latter appeared before the leaders of the city to

assure them that the dragons presented no threat to the Waterd-

havian relief army. Incensed by the lords accusations of treachery,

and insulted by Piergieron the Paladinsons refusal to demand an

apology, Aglarel withdrew Shades offer of a formal alliance and

rescinded the citys promise of any further aid to Waterdeep.

The  shades  then  turned  their  attention  to  the  ruins  of  Myth

Drannor,  which  had  long  been  home  to  a  small  enclave  of

phaerimms. The Shadovar covered the ruined city with a blanket

620_88647_PlayGuideFaru3.indd   167

12/19/03, 3:07:59 PM

CAMPAIGN JOURNAL

of  pure  shadow  and  sealed  it  off  to  ensure  that  the  phaerimms

could  not   ee.  Once  the  ruins  were  secure,  the  forces  of  Shade

began a slow, brutal cleansing of the ruins, working to destroy all

the phaerimms that dwelt there.

Despite  the  withdrawal  of  Shades  assistance,  Laerals  army

reached  Evereska  and  camped  just  outside  the  Fortress  Homes

boundaries. Laeral Silverhand and Khelben Arunsun, reunited once

more, prepared for the coming con ict, but the battle found them

instead. Thanks to the withdrawal of Shades forces and the appar-

ent failure of the scrying amulets worn by the armys sentries, the

phaerimms managed to slip in among the troops under the cover of

invisibility and use their mind-affecting magic to turn the soldiers

against one another. Though Laeral perceived what was happening

and managed to rally the troops, the damage had already been done.

The defenders of Evereska suffered a severe defeat and were forced

to retreat and regroup, and Laeral herself lost an arm in the battle,

proving that even the Chosen of Mystra are not invulnerable.

Meanwhile, Princess Alusair of Cormyr was entertaining Sha-

dovar emissaries and considering the bene ts of a possible alliance

between the Forest Kingdom and the City of Shade. But any pos-

sibility of such an alliance was destroyed by the unexpected arrival

of Galaeron Nihmedu. Though still struggling for control over the

dark side of his nature that his practice of Shadow Weave magic had

unlocked, the young elf bore proof that the Shadovar were using

potent magic to melt the High Ice, with the intention of render-

ing Anauroch fertile. When it became clear that the Shades cared

nothing about the years of  ooding and starvation that this action

would bring about in the rest of Faern, the Steel Regent ordered

the emissaries to leave Cormyr and began organizing an alliance to

attack Shade directly. Guided to the  oating city by Galaeron and

a Bedine witch named Ruha, Cormyrs Royal Magician, Caladnei,

established a base camp in a defensible network of canyons below

the city.

Aware that Cormyr was preparing for an assault on their city,

the Shadovar gathered as many of their troops as they could spare

and  marched  on  Cormyr  itself.  The  Cormyrans,  thanks  to  the

magical  capability  of  the  former  Royal  Magician  Vangerdahast,

were ready for the Shades and met them at Tilverton. During the

ensuing  battle,  Vangerdahast  released  a  potent  magical  weapon

against the Shade army, hoping to gain an edge in the coming war.

Unfortunately,  the  interaction  of  this  weapon  with  the  Shadow

Weave  magic  of  the  Shade  army  released  a  spectacular  surge  of

energy that utterly destroyed Tilverton.

In  the  months  that  followed,  the  alliance  fared  little  better.

Bereft  of  the  Shadow  Weave  magic  of  the  Shades,  Cormyr  and

its allies were largely unsuccessful in their engagements with both

the phaerimms and the Shadovar. With their economies crippled

and their soldiers going hungry because of the weather disruptions

created by the melting of the High Ice, the alliance was unable

to confront Shade in any meaningful way. When the phaerimms

demonstrated  that  they  could  easily  in ltrate  the  alliances  war

council and dominate its leaders, the morale of the allies dropped

even more. Surprisingly, the phaerimms then offered an unusual

proposition.  If  the  allies  would  agree  to  leave  Evereska  and  its

mythal to them, the phaerimms would come to their aid against

Shade. Needless to say, Alusair refused, but the phaerimms, deter-

mined to force the issue, chose to demonstrate the wisdom of

such an alliance by destroying one of the shadow blankets that was

melting the High Ice.

In Evereska, meanwhile, the situation remained uncertain. The

Waterdhavian relief army continued to push toward the city, while

the inhabitants of Evereska grimly held off the siege. The situation

began to look up when the mysterious shadow shell of the shades

 nally fell. Though this event restored much of the phaerimms

power, it also invigorated the ailing mythal and improved the elves

morale immeasurably.

Back in Cormyr, Galaeron Nihmedu, his stone giant companion

Aris, and Storm Silverhand hatched a daring plan to bring the City

of  Shade  downliterally.  They  hoped  to  in ltrate  the  city  with

several of the Chosen of Mystra,  nd their way to the  oating citys

mythallar, and destroy it, which should cause Shade to simply fall

from the sky. With Shade removed from the equation, the rest of

Faern could then unite against the phaerimms and eliminate them

once and for all. Using bizarre but powerful magic, the  ve Chosen

(Khelben  Arunsun,  Storm  Silverhand,  Laeral  Silverhand,  Dove

Falconhand, and Alustriel Silverhand) shrank themselves down to

minuscule proportions and allowed Galaeron and Aris to swallow

them so that they could enter Shade undetected. The plan was suc-

cessfulGalaeron and Aris were captured by the Blue Suzerain and

brought back to Shade shortly after they secretly left Cormyr. But

although the Chosen of Mystra managed to gain access to Shades

mythallar and actually damage it, they were unable to bring the

Lolths Silence

Lolths sudden disappearance from the hearts of her priestesses

has  baf ed  and  frightened  the  drow.  But  what  does  this  event

mean for your campaign?

In  game  terms,  any  divine  spellcaster  whose  patron  deity  is

Lolth cannot prepare new spells on a daily basis. (If such a char-

acter somehow still has spells prepared from prior to the 28th of

Eleasias, she may cast these normally.) Likewise, the character

cannot rebuke undead or access spell-like or supernatural abilities

gained from any divine spellcasting class or prestige class whose

requirements specify Lolth as a patron deity. Magic items, in-

cluding  spell  trigger  and  spell  completion  items,  still  function

normally, but since Lolths worshipers cannot cast spells, they

also cannot create new magic items.

The  drow  are  not  the  only  ones  affected  by  Lolths  silence.

Beings of any race that worship the Spider Queen also  nd them-

selves bereft of the goddesss favor.

 oating city down. Nevertheless, the attack was a partial success.

The loss of the Karsestone during the chaos of the battle at the

mythallar ensured that the Shadovar could not create any more of

their shadow blankets to continue the melting of the High Ice.

After regrouping from the assault on Shade, Galaeron and the

Chosen  of  Mystra  determined  that  their  energies  would  be  best

spent against the phaerimms that had, by now, breached Evereskas

mythal. Guided by the knowledge of the phaerimms that Galaeron

had received from Melegaunt Tanthul before his death, the defend-

ers  of  Evereska  devised  a  desperate  plan  to  restore  the  damaged

mythal and drive the phaerimms from Evereska once and for all.

Though  the  battle  was  hard-fought,  a  coalition  of  High  Mages

from Evermeet and Evereska managed to complete the repairs to

the  citys  mystical  defenses.  But  because  Galaeron  had  to  step  in

during the process and take up the role of a slain High Mage, the

new Evereska mythal was the  rst of its kind to be formed of both

Weave magic and Shadow Weave magic.

Once the mythals protective wards were active once more, the

 nal battle in the siege of Evereska quickly became a rout. With the

phaerimms army broken and Shade crippled by its battles with both

the phaerimms and the allied nations of Faern, the continent has

settled back into an uneasy peace. The return of the archwizards, as

the bards have already dubbed this series of events, has left much of

the Heartlands region in disarray. Evereskas army is all but totally

depleted, Cormyr is still reeling from the loss of Tilverton and the

aftershocks of King Azoun IVs recent death, and virtually every

nation in the region is now facing a severe drought and an economic

crisis.  Given  the  Shadovars  tenacity,  it  seems  unlikely  that  this

temporary peace can last much longer.

The War of the Spider Queen

Deep  beneath  the  surface  of  Faern,  in  sunless  caverns  ruled  by

the  dark  and  twisted  drow,  a  staggering  event  occurred  late  in

the summer of 1372 DR. Lolth had always been a  ckle patron,

often abandoning one of her servants for days or tendays at a time

because  of  some  perceived  slight,  but  in  the  waning  days  of  the

month of Eleasias, the high priestesses of Menzoberranzan came

to a startling realizationtheir goddess had completely abandoned

them.  Lolth  granted  no  spells,  answered  none  of  her  clergys

prayers, and sent no signs to show her pleasure or displeasure. The

Matron Mothers, while undeniably worried, merely assumed that

they had in some way offended the Spider Queen. So they made the

proper sacri ces, performed rituals of atonement, and waited for

the goddess to restore her favor.

When autumn came and Lolths clerics were still unable to call

upon  the  Spider  Queens  blessings,  they  began  to  grow  nervous.

Adding to their concern was the fact that several dozen male drow

of various Houses had simply vanished. Though it was not uncom-

mon for drow males to desert their families and join one of the

minor merchant clans or the Bregan Daerthe mercenaries, these

males had simply disappeared. The Matron Mothers suspected that

they must have had some knowledge of Lolths silenceafter all,

why else would they dare to risk the priestesses wrath?

The  Matron  Mothers  were  not  the  only  ones  to  notice  this

sudden  exodus.  Gromph  Baenre  noted  the  disappearance  of  the

males, and despite the warnings of the Matron Mothers, he com-

manded  Pharaun  Mizzrym,  a  Master  of  Sorcere,  to  investigate

the matter. Pharaun viewed the assignment as a death trap, since

he knew that Gromph would have him slain if he failed and the

priestesses would doubtless do the same to keep Lolths disappear-

ance a secret if he succeeded. Even so, he had no real choice but

to agree. Realizing that he would need signi cant aid in this task,

the  drow  wizard  turned  to  his  friend  Ryld  Argith,  a  Master  of

Melee-Magthere.  Though  Ryld  was  understandably  reluctant,  he

was  also  extraordinarily  bored  and  discontented  with  his  life  at

Menzoberranzans dueling academy, so he allowed Pharaun to talk

him into joining the investigation.

While the pair searched for leads in the lower levels of Men-

zoberranzan, even more plots were brewing in the higher halls of

power. Gromph Baenre, seeking to undermine his sister Quenthels

position  as  Mistress  of  Arach-Tinilith,  sent  several  demonic  as-

sassins in the guise of sendings from Lolth to murder heror at

least to convince the other priestesses that the Spider Queen was

displeased with Quenthel. Faeryl Zauvirr, an ambassador from the

drow city of Ched Nasad, was falsely accused of treachery, impris-

oned, and tortured for attempting to leave the city and discover why

Ched Nasad had sent no word and no caravans to Menzoberranzan

since Lolth had suddenly gone silent.

After a signi cant amount of digging in the seediest sections of

Menzoberranzan,  Pharaun  and  Ryld  discovered  that  the  missing

drow males were working with an alhoon (an undead mind  ayer)

to  spark  a  slave  uprising  that  would  bring  the  city  to  its  knees.

Although  the  alhoon  was  successful  in  instigating  the  rebellion,

Menzoberranyr  troops  were  able  to  put  down  the  uprising,  and

Pharaun and Ryld slew the creature.

Not entirely convinced that Lolths silence and the alhoons slave

uprising were unrelated, Triel Baenre, the Matron Mother of House

Baenre, ordered her sister Quenthel to lead an expedition to Ched

Nasad to determine why the City of Glimmering Webs had fallen

out of contact. Pharaun, Ryld, Faeryl Zauvirr, and Triels draegloth

son Jeggred traveled with Quenthel, and the mercenary scout Valas

Hune served as guide.

The band wasted no time setting out from Menzoberranzan, but

the road was far from an easy one. Before reaching Ched Nasad, the

drow had to pass through the ruins of Ammarindar below Hell-

gate Keep, battling Kaany Vhoks tanarruks the entire way. While

traveling through Ammarindar, Pharaun managed to attract the

interest of Aliisza, Vhoks half-succubus consort and aide.

Once  they  reached  Ched  Nasad,  the  situation  improved  very

little. Though Lolths silence had not become public knowledge in

the City of Glimmering Webs, there was a de nite sense of unrest

among the citys populationno doubt caused largely by the fact

that the Menzoberranyr had unwittingly arrived at the outset of

an attempted coup. The heads of several smaller Houses of Ched

Nasad, seeing Lolths silence as an opportunity to improve their

lot in life, hired a band of duergar mercenaries to assault the city.

In the confusion, the drow nobles hoped to seize the reins of power

themselves.

More  intrigue  followed  the  group  when  Quenthel  Baenre  and

Jeggred  attempted  to  ful ll  their  secondary  missionsecuring  a

caravan of goods from a merchant company owned by the Baenre

family.  Faeryl  Zauvirr  betrayed  the  Mistress  of  Arach-Tinilith,

taking both her and Jeggred prisoner and using the goods to help

fund  her  mothers  rebellion.  The  conspirators  then  attempted  to

capture Pharaun, Ryld, and Valas Hune, but their plans went awry

when the duergar mercenaries began their attack on the city. In the

ensuing confusion, the Menzoberranyr managed to  ght their way

free of their captors, recover Quenthel and Jeggred, and slay the

traitorous Faeryl while the city burned around them.

Unfortunately, the battle for Ched Nasad went considerably dif-

ferently than the conspiring houses had anticipated. The duergar

mercenaries  employed  an  alchemical  substance  that  burned  the

very stone from which Ched Nasad had been carved, and they used

it perhaps too vigorously during the battle. Between the duergars

stone re and the defending drows battle magic, Ched Nasad was

destroyed. The Menzoberranyr barely managed to escape through

a  portal,  along  with  two  refugees  from  Ched  NasadHalisstra

Melarn and her battle-captive Danifae. The exact number of survi-

vors from Ched Nasads fall remains uncertain, but given the total

annihilation of the city, it seems unlikely that any more than a few

hundred might have escaped alive.

The  portal  through  which  the  Menzoberranyr  escaped  led  to

an ancient Netherese ruin in Anauroch. After some debate, and a

 erce battle with the lamias that inhabited the ruin, the intrepid

signi cant rain to the Anauroch, severe droughts will occur across

the North and as far south as Amn and Tethyr.

The  Silver  Mythal:  Not  all  of  the  phaerimms  who  besieged

Evereska  were  destroyed.  A  handful  were  simply  driven  off,  and

now some of those fugitives have found their way as far north as

the Gem of the NorthSilverymoon itself. Eager to feast upon the

citys near-mythal, the phaerimms have resorted to mind control

and  beguiling  to  set  the  leaders  of  Silverymoon  at  each  others

throats, hoping to weaken the city enough that they can devour the

citys wards.

New Tilverton: Ever a hardy and pragmatic people, the Cormyran

peasants have begun to build a new town a few miles away from the

shadowy crater that marks the grave of Tilverton. Recently, though,

some strange beast has begun stalking the villagers by night, drag-

ging them away from their homes and leaving their maimed bodies

on the road to the site of old Tilverton. Is this some new ploy of

the  Shadovar,  or  something  that  came  out  of  the  darkness  that

engulfed Tilverton? Or could it be something else altogether?

Drow in the Forest: Since the Spider Queens sudden silence, many

more drow males have  ocked to the surface colonies in Corman-

thyr, seeking a better life than the harshly matriarchal society of

the Underdark drow can offer. This in ux has strained the resources

of the church of Eilistraee, and its clergy entreat the PCs to help

them keep the uneasy peace between the newly arrived drow and

the surface elves.

The Ruins of Ched Nasad: In the Underdark, space is always at

a premium, so it seems unlikely that the ruins of Ched Nasad will

remain vacant for long. Some sort of powerful monster, such as a

deep dragon, might choose to lair amid the rubble, or an Under-

dark race such as the kuo-toa or the mind  ayers might establish

a colony in the canyon, seeking a good beachhead from which to

attack Menzoberranzan.

Havoc  on  the  Planes:  The  battle  between  Vhaeraun  and  Sel-

vetarm might at any time spill out of the Demonweb Pits and into

the rest of the multiverse. The titanic forces brought to bear as the

two divinities battle cause the edges of the various planes to fray

and bleed together. The PCs must  nd a way to reverse this process

before something very unpleasant happenssuch as the edge of the

Nine Hells bleeding right into Faern. This adventure hook would

be best suited for high-level characters.

band elected to seek out a priest of Vhaeraun, in the hopes that

another god might be able to discover what had become of Lolth.

After  a  long  journey  through  the  Shadow  Plane  and  the  gray

dwarf city of Gracklstugh, the Menzoberranyr made their way to

Cormanthyr, where a large contingent of male drow who worshiped

the Masked Lord had set up a settlement. In return for recovering

an ancient magic tome from a beholder lairing nearby, the head

Vhaeraunite priest agreed to transport the Menzoberranyr to the

Demonweb Pits, so that they might attempt to locate the goddess

and question her more directly.

While the Menzoberranyr and their Vhaeraunite guide traveled

astrally  to  the  Demonweb  Pits,  Menzoberranzan  itself  faced  a

sudden three-pronged attack. A secret society of drow males called

the Jaezred Chaulssin had discovered Lolths absence shortly after

the priestesses themselves had. Since then, members of this group

had been acting behind the scenes to ful ll their goal of overthrow-

ing the matriarchal drow society and replacing it with a hierarchy

of their own. The Jaezred Chaulssin had been behind Menzober-

ranzans slave uprising, and its members had inadvertently helped

cause the destruction of Ched Nasad. Now, with an army of gray

dwarf mercenaries and Kaanyr Vhoks tanarruks in their employ,

the males laid siege to Menzoberranzan. Through treachery and

betrayal from within the city, they scored a great victory against

the Menzoberranyr, though they were unable to take the city as

they had planned.

Meanwhile, in the Demonweb Pits, a second threat to the drow

way  of  life  manifested  itself.  The  Vhaeraunite  priest  did  indeed

manage  to  guide  the  Lolth-worshipers  to  the  very  heart  of  the

Spider  Queens  realm,  and  they  found  Lolths  apparently  insen-

sate form at the nadir of the pit. The Vhaeraunite, however, had

planned  betrayal  from  the  start.  Using  his  magics,  he  created  a

gate and summoned Vhaeraun himself, who attacked the apparently

comatose Lolth and injured her terribly. The drow god Selvetarm,

drawn by the attack on his queen, appeared and attacked Vhaeraun.

The  two  gods  battled,  then  plummeted  from  the  webs  on  which

they  fought  into  the  emptiness  below.  What  effects,  if  any,  this

event may have on worshipers of either god remains unknown.

Plots and Rumors

The following adventure hooks are designed to take advantage of

the  recent  events  surrounding  the  return  of  Shade  and  Lolths

sudden silence. As DM, you can tailor these ideas appropriately to

 t your own campaign.

Stormy  Weather:  Although  the  Shadovar  were  thwarted  in

their efforts to melt the High Ice and irrigate the Anauroch, they

havent  given  up  on  restoring  the  region  to  its  former  fertility.

The  Princes  of  Shade  have  begun  to  pursue  dangerous  alliances

with the churches of Talos and other malign deities of storms and

weather. With their mastery of the Shadow Weave, they plan to

alter Faerns weather patterns radically. If they succeed in bringing

This appendix presents Faern-speci c material for use

with the Psionics Handbook, Book of Exalted Deeds,

and Book of Vile Darkness.

Psionics in Faern

Because magic is so prevalent in Faerun, the mental powers known

as psionics have never played an important role in its lore. Today

in Toril, most people regard psionics as an ability possessed only by

speci c monsters, such as mind  ayers and rakshasas. But in truth,

anyone suf ciently dedicated can learn to wield psionic powers.

Psionics and the Weave

Unlike spells, which derive their power from Faerns Weave (or the

Shadow Weave), psionic ability taps only the inner reservoirs of the

manifester. In a sense, each psionic creature is its own Weave, using

the magic of its own lifeforce and mind to create psionic effects.

Mystra and Shar have no ability to deny psionic creatures access to

powers, and they do not control the promulgation of psionic lore

and ability throughout the populace of Faern.

While psionics does not require the Weave to function, psionic

powers are magical in nature. Spells such as detect magic can also

detect psionic abilities at work, and spells such as dispel magic or

antimagic shell can negate, suppress, or completely cancel psionic

manifestations. In Faern, psionics and magic are not transpar-

ent to each other; they interact exactly as magic interacts with

other magic.

Psionic Organizations

Often mistaken for reclusive orders of diviners, enchanters, or other

arcane spellcasters, psionic organizations are uncommon in Faern.

Most of those described here are secretive (or at least circumspect)

and small.

THE KALIESHERAI

Based in the elven city of Evereska, the Kaliesherai is a loose as-

sociation of elves who have a measure of psionic ability. Because

many of them have been honing their mental powers for centuries,

the Hall of the Kaliesherai is one of the greatest stores of psionic

knowledge in all of Faern, and it is almost certainly the greatest

center of such lore beyond the reach of the mind  ayers.

Many members of the Kaliesherai spend their time in serene

contemplation  of  their  gifts,  but  a  faction  within  the  group  has

become  fascinated  with  psionic  items.  As  a  result,  the  members

of  the  Kaliesherai  are  so  keen  to  acquire  more  such  items  that

they will happily buy them or trade for them with any visitors to

Evereska. A subbasement in the hall of the Kaliesherai contains

many laboratories and vaults that hold psionic items ranging from

simple power stones to great psicrowns and crystal capacitors. Some

say it also holds prison cells where the Kaliesherai keep monsters

with psionic powers for study.

Campaign Hooks: You can adapt any of the following hooks to

draw the characters into contact with the Kaliesherai.

4Elf and half-elf characters with psionic classes might have been

trained by the Kaliesherai.

4PCs who come across a psionic item they cant use might seek a

buyer for it in Evereska.

4The Hall of the Kaliesherais basement makes a tempting target

for thievesor perhaps a group trying to rescue an imprisoned

couatl, rakshasa, or yuan-ti.

4By  accident  or  design,  thieves  in  the  Kaliesherais  basement

might set free some of the creatures held captive there to wreak

havoc on the city.

STRAY THOUGHTS

Led  by  Jacenelle  Traen  (a  16th-level  female  human  wilder),  the

Stray Thoughts is a Sembia-based adventuring company with about

two score members, all of whom have at least some psionic power.

The  members  of  the  Stray  Thoughts  call  a  seemingly  rundown

manor  on  the  outskirts  of  Selgaunt  home,  but  three-quarters  of

them are off on missions at any given time.

The  membership  of  the  Stray  Thoughts  tends  to  be  rather

stable  because  replacement  members  are  so  dif cult  to  come  by.

Members  of  the  group  get  access  to

the Selgaunt manor, which is actually

an effective stronghold warded by an

array of psionic traps but disguised to

look decrepit. Jacenelle herself is there

about half the time, organizing groups

to take on jobs ranging from caravan

guard  to  private  investigator  (often

of  merchant  activities  and  court  in-

trigues).  Shes  generally  willing  to

manifest her powers on the behalf of

Stray Thoughts members.

Jacenelle  is  keen  to  expand  the

Stray  Thoughts,  especially  beyond

the  boundaries  of  Sembia.  Becoming

a  member  of  the  organization  is  as

simple as excelling during a probation-

ary mission assigned by Jacenelle. She

always  instructs  a  senior  member  of

the  group  to  monitor  probationary

members  surreptitiously,  paying  close

attention to their professionalism.

Forak-Erach-Naek

Campaign  Hooks:  You  can  adapt

any  of  the  following  hooks  to  draw

the  characters  into  contact  with  the

Stray Thoughts.

4The  PCs  might   nd  themselves

working  at  odds  with  a  group  of

Stray Thoughts members, and a rivalry (good-natured or oth-

erwise) might develop.

4A psionic character might take on a probationary mission from

the Stray Thoughts, hoping to become a member.

4Jacenelle might ask higher-level PCs to establish a Stray Thoughts

chapter house in another part of Faern.

FORAK-ERACH-NAEK

This group of duergar soulknife/assassins is among the more feared

organizations in the Underdark. The members of the Forak-Erach-

Naek (Empty-Scabbard Killers in an obscure Dwarven dialect)

are assassins for hire willing to work for any patron who can meet

their price in gold.

The location of Forak-Erach-Naeks headquarters is a closely

guarded  secret,  but  would-be  employers  know  that  the  Cave  of

Twelve  Teeth,  on  the  shores  of  the  Darklake  near  the  duergar

metropolis  of  Gracklstugh,  is  the  place  to  hire  a  Forak-Erach-

Naek assassin.

173

Campaign Hooks: The most obvious way to introduce the Forak-

Erach-Naek into your campaign is to use one of its members as an

antagonist. You can adapt any of the following hooks to draw the

characters into contact with the Forak-Erach-Naek.

4Some dark power took out a contract on one or more PCs.

4The PCs are assigned to guard an important personage marked

for death by the Forak-Erach-Naek.

4The Forak-Erach-Naek has recently expanded its services to in-

clude kidnapping for ransom. A rescue mission to free a captive

in the secret fortress of this organiza-

tion would be an appropriate challenge

for a high-level party.

THE COLLEGE OF THE

ECLIPSE

Headquartered  in  the  Tethyrian

metropolis  of  Riatavin,  this  society

is  dedicated  to  the  advancement  of

psionic  abilities.  The  College  of  the

Eclipse  operates  openly  from  its

fortresslike headquarters. Most Teth-

yrians  believe  that  its  just  another

esoteric  order  of  arcane  spellcasters,

and  its  members  encourage  that

misconception.  The  college  admin-

isters  entrance  exams  designed  to

identify  psionic  aptitude  to  anyone

who  requests  entrance,  and  it  offers

inexpensive basic training in the Art.

More  advanced  students  can  also

rent living quarters and access to the

colleges laboratories and libraries to.

A  graduate  of  the  basic  course  is

equivalent to a 1st- or 2nd-level psion

and  is  called  a  fellow.  Almost  all

fellows of the college work in govern-

ment  or  the  skilled  trades.  Graduates  often   nd  work  as  oracles,

sages,  or  advisors  to  government  of cials  or  trading  companies.

Almost all are psions, although at least two of the colleges instruc-

tors are wilders.

The seven regents of the college (all high-level psions) are making

increasing efforts to keep tabs on the colleges fellows. Theyre con-

cerned about the public perception of psionics, and they dont want

wayward psions making life more dif cult for students of the Art.

Campaign Hooks: You can adapt any of the following hooks to

draw the characters into contact with the College of the Eclipse.

4A character who is ready to take a level in a psionic class can

study  for  a  few  tendays  at  the  college,  paying  for  tuition  but

receiving psionic items as awards and graduation gifts.

4The regents might hire adventurers to investigate or apprehend

a psionic graduate whos turned to evil.

4A  conventional  wizards  guild  in  Riatavin  might  hire  PCs  to

in ltrate the College of the Eclipse and learn the secrets of its

strange magic.

THE HALL OF MENTAL SPLENDOR

Beneath  Waterdeep,  in  the  sinister  town  of  Skullport,  stands  a

small keep known as the Hall of Mental Splendor, which is home

to a group of psionic spies-for-hire. Run by Vhondryl (a 14th-level

female human psion), the Hall of Mental Splendor provides dis-

creet espionage services for many of the factions vying for power

in the city above. Vhondryl is aggressively trying to get more jobs

from clients outside Waterdeep because she realizes that each job

creates a potential enemy, and shed rather not have her enemies

living right above her.

Many of the higher-level agents of the Hall of Mental Splendor

are cognition thieves (see below). Until about a month ago, Vhon-

dryl  kept  a  number  of  dopplegangers  in  her  employ.  But  after  a

heated dispute over a mission gone badly, all of them walked out

together. Since then, Vhondryl has been actively seeking agents who

have access to polymorph or other shapechanging magic, or even

superlative Disguise skills.

Campaign Hooks: You  can  adapt  any  of  the  following  hooks

to  draw  the  characters  into  contact  with  the  Hall  of  Mental

Splendor.

4An NPC whos tagging along with the characters might be an

agent of the Hall of Mental Splendor who has been assigned to

keep its members under surveillance or sabotage their efforts.

4The PCs might become subcontractors of the Hall of Mental

Splendor, especially for missions beyond the walls of Waterdeep.

4If the PCs are chasing a doppelganger enemy, his trail might take

them to Skullport, where they must contend with Vhondryl and

the Hall of Mental Splendor.

Psionic

Prestige Classes

All the prestige classes in the Psionics Handbook are appropriate for

use in Faern. In addition, the following prestige class is available

for characters of Toril.

Cognition Thief

These psionic agents of espionage specialize in delving deeply into

the minds of their targets to steal their very thoughtsand some-

times the ability to reason as well. They appear unassuming, using

neither powerful weapons nor  ashy spells to achieve their goals.

But a cognition thiefs subtle ability to worm her way into a targets

very consciousness makes her the ultimate secret agent.

Cognition thieves almost always come from the ranks of psions

or wilders, although sometimes a monster with the psilike ability

to emit a psionic blast becomes a cognition thief. Psions with the

telepath discipline are particularly prevalent.

Cognition thieves have all received training in Skullports Hall

of Mental Splendor (see above). Most still work for that group of

mercenary spies-for-hire, but some have since retired or severed ties

with the Hall.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a cognition thief, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Skills:  5  ranks  each  in  any  two  of  the  following  skills:  Bluff,

Disguise, Gather Information, Open Lock.

Feat: Inquisitor (Psionics Handbook).

Psionics: Able to manifest the psionic blast power (Psionics Hand-

book).

CLASS SKILLS

The cognition thiefs class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Autohypnosis (Wis), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Disable Device

(Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather

Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (psionics) (Int), Move

Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Profession (Wis), Psicraft (Int),

Sleight  of  Hand  (Dex),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  and  Stabilize  Self

(Con). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook and Chapter

2: Skills in the Psionics Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  cognition  thief

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Cognition thieves are pro cient

with all simple weapons and light armor. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Power Points per Day/Powers Discovered: At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th,

8th, and 9th level, the character gains new power points per day

(and  powers  discovered,  if  applicable)  as  if  she  had  also  gained  a

level in a psionic class she belonged to before she added the prestige

class level. She does not, however, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained (bonus feats, metapsionic feats or

item creation feats, hit points beyond those she receives from the

prestige class, and so on). She does gain the following bene ts: an

increased  effective  manifester  level,  additional  power  points,  and

effective  additional  levels  for  psicrystal  powers  (if  a  psicrystal  is

owned). This essentially means that she adds the level of cognition

thief to the level of some other psionic class the character has, then

determines power points per day, powers discovered, and manifester

level accordingly.

If a character had more than one psionic class that before she

became a cognition thief, she must decide to which class she adds

each level of cognition thief for the purpose of determining power

points per day and powers discovered.

Bonus  Powers  Known:  At  1st,  4th,  7th,  and  10th  level,  the

cognition  thief  learns  two  new  powers  chosen  from  the  telepath

discipline. She can choose any power from the list that she would

be  able  to  manifest.  Even  cognition  thieves  who  manifest  their

powers as wilders can choose from the telepath discipline list, which

is otherwise forbidden to them. These powers are acquired through

personal meditation, just as the new powers learned at each level in

a base psionic class are. Thus, they take no time and cost no XP

to learn.

Read Thoughts (Sp): At 1st level, the cognition thief can use read

thoughts (as the psionic power of the same name) once per day. The

save DC for this power is 10 + 1/2 cognition thiefs character level

+ cognition thiefs Int or Cha modi er, whichever

is higher. She can use this power twice per

day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th

level, and at will at 10th level.

Confusion (Sp): At 4th level, the cognition

thief can use confusion (as the spell of the same

name) once per day. The save DC for this ability

is  10  +  1/2  cognition  thiefs  character  level

+ cognition thiefs Int or Cha modi er,

whichever is higher. She can use this

power twice per day at 7th level and

three times per day at 10th level.

Mind  Probe  (Sp):  At  7th  level,

the cognition thief can use mind

probe (as the psionic power of the

same  name)  once  per  day.  The

save DC for this power is 10 + 1/2

cognition thiefs character level + cog-

nition thiefs Int or Cha modi er, whichever

is higher. She can use this power twice per day

at 10th level.

Insanity (Sp): At 10th level, the cognition

thief can use insanity (as the spell of the same

name)  once  per  day.  The  save  DC  for  this

ability is 10 + 1/2 cognition thiefs character

level + cognition thiefs Int or Cha modi-

 er, whichever is higher.

Exalted Deeds

and Vile Darkness

Book  of  Vile  Darkness  and  Book  of  Exalted  Deeds  introduce

mature themes of depraved evil and lofty good to a Dungeons

& Dragons game, and some of these themes might also be

appropriate for a FORGOTTEN REALMS campaign. Even if

you  are  not  using  those  books  in  your  game  and  have

no particular interest in bringing mature themes into

your  campaign,  you  can  still  make  use  of  the

prestige classes, feats, and other material in

this section, adjusting the prerequisites as

needed.

Feats

The feats in this section (as opposed to those

in  Chapter  1)  are  all  either  vile  or  exalted  feats.

Because such feats must be granted to a character by some powerful

entity of good or evil, they are essentially supernatural in character.

An unwritten prerequisite for every vile feat is an evil alignment,

and  likewise  a  good  alignment  is  required  for  every  exalted  feat.

Characters  who  fail  to  live  up  to  the  ideals  of  their  alignments

might actually lose the bene ts of their vile or exalted feats.

Like the other rules in this chapter, the new feats here are tied

to some of the most deeply evil or profoundly good entities and

organizations in Faern, including deities, societies, and even

speci c individuals. When the feats prerequisites imply a bar-

gain with an evil creature or some kind of arrangement with

a good one, it is the DMs prerogative to require characters

to perform a special ritual or negotiate a deal to acquire it.

For example, the Blessed of the Seven Sisters feat presumes

a personal connection to one of the Seven Sisters. Play-

ers should not simply assume that their characters can

acquire the appropriate connection outside the roleplaying context

of the game. The DM should allow only characters who have clearly

developed that kind of relationship to take that feat.

Blessed of the Seven Sisters

[Exalted]

As a result of a personal connection to one of the Seven Sisters, you

have a taste of Mystras special favor.

Prerequisite: Able to cast 6th-level arcane spells.

Bene t: You may add the following spells to the spell list of one

arcane spellcasting class that grants you access to 6th-level spells.

1st Level:  Ray of hope, vision of heaven.

2nd Level  Ease pain.

3rd Level:  Blessed sight.

4th Level:  Sword of conscience.

5th Level:  Crown of  ame, sacred guardian.

6th Level:  Crown of brilliance.

7th Level:   Righteous smite.

If you have a spellbook, you may add these spells to your spell-

book as normal. If you cast spells spontaneously in the manner of

a sorcerer or bard, you may immediately, as an additional bene t of

this feat, swap any one spell that you know for a spell of the same

level from the above list. After you take this feat, you may swap

spells known according to the usual rules for your class.

Favored of the Zulkirs [Vile]

Through  your  position  of  prestige  among  the  Red  Wizards,  you

have gained access to secrets of evil magic known to few outside

the zulkirs themselves.

Prerequisite: Red Wizard level 5th, Corrupt Spell (Book of Vile

Darkness).

Bene t: When you cast a corrupted spell, the ability damage you

take is reduced by 1 point.

Gift of Discernment [Exalted]

You can rely on your conscience to steer you away from evil deeds.

Bene t: If you take a moment (a free action) to contemplate an

action you are about to perform, you know with certainty whether

that action will adversely affect your alignment and standing with

your deity (if any). This knowledge is identical with that provided

by a phylactery of faithfulness.

Lliiras Blessing [Exalted]

Thanks to the favor of the goddess of freedom, you are dif cult

to restrain.

Prerequisite:  Escape  Artist  1  rank,  Nimbus  of  Light  (Book  of

Exalted Deeds).

Bene t: You gain a +2 sacred bonus on Escape Artist checks and

a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against any effect that would

cause  you  to  become  paralyzed,  held,  or  entangled.  If  you  fail  a

saving  throw  against  such  an  effect,  you  can  attempt  a  second

saving throw 1 round later. If you succeed on the second saving

throw, you are affected as though you had succeeded on the  rst.

Spider Bite [Vile]

You gain a poisonous bite like that of a spider.

Prerequisite: Verminfriend (Book of Vile Darkness), patron deity

Lolth.

Bene t: Your saliva is poisonous when ingested by or introduced

into the bloodstream of another creature. You can inject this venom

while grappling a foe that has exposed skin by making a successful

grapple check. The Fortitude DC to resist this poison is 10 + 1/2

your character level + your Con modi er. The initial and secondary

damage ratings are the same (1d4 points of Strength damage). Your

kiss is also poisonous, and you can use your saliva to poison food or

drink, though when the poison is ingested, the save DC is reduced

by 2.

Vasharans and Jerrens in Faern?

Book of Vile Darkness introduces two new subraces of the hu-

manoid type. These thoroughly evil versions of normal humans

and  hal ings  are  called  Vasharans  and  Jerrens.  Vasharans  are

featured prominently throughout Book of Vile Darkness, since

the magical artifact for which that book is named  gures into

their history. But the Vasharans are not a part of the history of

Faern, so integrating this material into a FORGOTTEN REALMS

campaign can cause some headaches for a DM.

One option is to incorporate the Vasharans and Jerrens into

Faern just as they are portrayed in Book of Vile Darkness, plac-

ing them in remote regions that would allow them to develop

apart from mainstream civilization for centuries. The plateau of

Vashar might lie somewhere in the Shining South, for example,

while the Jerrens might inhabit a particularly desolate stretch of

the Eastern Shaar.

Another option is to merge these races into existing cultures

of Faern. For example, the Vasharans might equate to the rulers

of the ancient Shoon Imperium in Calimshan, or to the Mulan

rulers of Thay. The Jerrens could be just a minor race of hal ings

in Luiren.

A third option is simply to ignore the Vasharans and Jerrens.

When spells or magical items are noted as originating among the

Vasharans, simply disregard that information and replace it with

an origin of your own design.

APPENDIX

Touch of Hate [Vile]

Because you are favored by Bane, you can transform animals into

evil minions.

Prerequisite: Vile Spell (Book of Vile Darkness), able to cast 5th-

level divine spells, patron deity Bane.

Bene t: Once per tenday, you can touch an animal and transform

it into a beast of Bane (same as the Beast of Xvim entry in Monster

Compendium: Monsters of Faern). The animal can have no more

Hit Dice prior to transformation than you have

cleric  levels.  The  target  creature  can  resist

the transformation by making a successful

Will  save  (DC  10  +  1/2  your  cleric  level

+ your Wis modi er). If the animal is

the  bonded  companion  of  another

character, it can use that characters

base Will save bonus instead of its

own, applying its own ability modi ers.

If  it  fails  the  save,  it  instantaneously

transforms  into  a  beast  of  Bane  and  fol-

lows your commands.

The beast of Bane that you create deals

vile  damage  with  its  smite  good  ability.

Vile damage can be healed only by magic

cast within the area of a consecrate or

hallow spell.

Classes

Black blood hunter

In contrast to the prestige classes in Chapter 2,

the classes in this section all rely to some extent on the rules in

Book of Vile Darkness and Book of Exalted Deeds. Some have vile

or exalted feats as prerequisites, others grant spells or other abilities

that are described in one of those books. All of them represent the

best and the worst that Faern has to offerthe heights of good

and the depths of evil.

Black Blood Hunter

The  People  of  the  Black  Blood,  as  described  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting, are lycanthropes united only by their

reverence  for  Malar,  the  Beastlord.  The  basic  credo  of  Malars

churchsurvival of the  ttest and winnowing of the weakis evil

in a dispassionate way, but the god grants exceptional

power  to  those  who  supplement  that  bestial

level of evil with torture, rape, and other

truly vile acts.

Black  blood  hunters  come  from  all

classes,  and  both  af icted  and  natu-

ral  lycanthropes  are  eligible  for  the

prestige class. Rangers, druids, and bar-

barians are common among the hunters,

but only because they are common among

the  People  of  the  Black  Blood.  Clerics  of

Malar often choose this path as well because

they enjoy having the ability to cast spells

in animal form.

Black blood hunters

have  no  organiza-

tional  structure.  Some

bands of People of the Black

Blood include hunters; others do not. Some of

the hunters have risen to leadership of their

packs, while others wish only to participate

in the hunt.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a black blood hunter,

a  character  must  ful ll  all  the  following

criteria.

Race: Any lycanthrope.

Skills: Control Shape 8 ranks (af icted lycanthrope only), Jump

6 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 4 ranks, Survival 6 ranks.

CLASS SKILLS

The black blood hunters class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str),

Knowledge  (nature)  (Int),  Listen  (Wis),  Move  Silently  (Dex),

Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str). See Chapter 4 of the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the black blood hunter

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Black blood hunters gain no pro-

 ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Greater  Curse  of  Lycanthropy  (Su):  The  DC  of  the  Fortitude

save required to avoid contracting lycanthropy from the charac-

ters bite attack increases by an amount equal to his black blood

hunter level.

Lycanthropic Spell (Ex): A black blood hunter with spellcasting

ability can cast spells normally in his animal or hybrid form, as

though he were a druid in wild shape using the Natural Spell feat.

Wild Items (Ex): A black blood hunter can use armor with the

wild special ability, a wilding clasp, or any similar item designed

for a druid to use while in wild shape. For the purpose of using

such items, all the black blood hunters lycanthropic forms count

as wild shapes.

Animal Aspect (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a black blood hunter

gains the ability to take on limited characteristics of his animal

form while remaining in his humanoid form. Once per day, he can

gain the Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution of his animal form

without actually adopting that shape. In addition, his natural armor

bonus increases by +2. All these changes last for 1 minute per black

blood hunter level. The black blood hunter can use this ability twice

per day at 4th level, three times per day at 6th level, four times per

day at 8th level, and  ve times per day at 10th level.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A black blood hunter of 2nd level or higher

can  use  body  language,  vocalizations,  and  demeanor  to  improve

the  attitude  of  an  animal.  This  ability  functions  like  the  druid

class feature of the same name, except that the character adds his

black blood hunter level to his 1d20 roll instead of his druid level.

Furthermore, he gains a +8 racial bonus (rather than the normal

+4) when using this ability with normal or dire animals of the same

kind as his animal form.

If the black blood hunter also has the wild empathy ability from

another class (such as druid or ranger), levels of that class stack

with his black blood hunter levels for the purpose of determining

the bonus on the wild empathy check.

Improved Hybrid Form (Ex): At 3rd level, a black blood hunter

gains the ability to use his animal forms special attacks while in

hybrid form.

Improved Vile Natural Attack (Su): At 4th level, a black blood

hunter deals an additional 1d4 points of vile damage with each suc-

cessful natural attack, rather than the 1 point that the Vile Natural

Attack feat allows. Vile damage can be healed only by magic cast

within the area of a consecrate or hallow spell.

When  he  reaches  8th  level,  the  vile  damage  he  deals  with  a

natural attack increases to 1d6 points.

Improved Damage Reduction (Su): When the black blood hunter

reaches 5th level, his lycanthropic damage reduction improves by 5

pointsto 10/silver if he is an af icted lycanthrope, or to 15/silver

if  he  is  a  natural  lycanthrope.  When  he  reaches  10th  level,  his

damage reduction can be bypassed only by magic silver weapons.

Faster Change (Ex): A black blood hunter of at least 6th level can

change to or from animal or hybrid form as a move action rather

than a standard action.

Quick Change (Ex): A 9th-level or higher black blood hunter can

change to or from animal or hybrid form as a free action.

Celebrant of Sharess

Sharess is a paradoxical deity. Originally, she was a war goddess of

the Mulhorandi pantheona champion in the war against Set and

his forces of evil. Now, however, she is a goddess of passion and sex

who is more often referred to as the Festhall Madam than as the

Foe of Set. Most of her priests forget her glorious past and spend

their time running brothels and celebrating the Endless Revel of

Life, a nearly constant parade of festivals in their goddesss honor.

But the celebrants of Sharess are different. They do not neglect

Sharess in her present aspect as the goddess of pleasure and lust,

but neither do they forget the ancient Foe of Set, who was Anhurs

lieutenant. Celebrants of Sharess are seducers and warriors, hedo-

nists and pious champions of good. While many of the goddesss

followers are chaotic neutral and some even lean toward evil, the

celebrants are an ever-present reminder that evil is the enemy, and

that pleasure is to be enjoyed and shared with all as an act of good.

Though celebrants of Sharess are not clerics, in many ways they

represent a truer embodiment of their deitys nature than many of

her clerics do.

Most  celebrants  were  previously  bards.  Clerics  who  adopt  this

prestige class forsake their advancement in divine spellcasting, so it

is not an attractive path for them. Sometimes barbarian/bards  nd

themselves drawn to the celebrants, and rogues are common among

their ranks as well.

Celebrant  NPCs  are  rare,  and  they   nd  little  welcome  in

the  decadent  church  of  Sharess.  The  celebrants  have  initiated

a  reform  movement  within  the  church,  challenging  the  estab-

lishment  to  change  its  interpretation  of  Sharesss  dogma  and

remember the good aspect of her alignment as well as the free-

wheeling chaotic one.

cast these spells. Celebrant of Sharess bonus spells are based

on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC

of 10 + spell level + the celebrants Charisma bonus (if

any). When the celebrant gets 0 spells per day

of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level

spells for a 1st-level celebrant), she gains

only  the  bonus  spells

she  would  be  entitled  to

based  on  her  Charisma  score  for

that spell level. The celebrants spell list appears below. A celebrant

of Sharess casts spells just as a bard does.

Upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after

that (8th and 10th), a celebrant of Sharess can choose to learn a

new spell in place of one she already knows. The new spells level

must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must

be at least two levels lower than the highest-level celebrant of Sha-

ress spell the character can cast. For instance, upon reaching 6th

level, a celebrant of Sharess could trade in a single 1st-level spell

(two spell levels below the highest-level celebrant spell she can cast,

which is 3rd) for a different 1st-level spell. At 8th and 10th

levels, she could trade in a single 1st-level or 2nd-level spell

(since she now can cast 4th-level celebrant spells) for a dif-

ferent spell of the same level. A celebrant of Sharess may

swap only a single spell at any given level, and she must

choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time

that she gains new spells known for that level.

Fascinate (Sp): A celebrant of Sharess can use her

 irtation ability (see below) to cause one or more crea-

tures to become fascinated with her. Each creature to

be fascinated must be within 90 feet of the celebrant

and be able to see, hear, and pay attention to her. The

celebrant must also be able to see the creature. The dis-

traction of a nearby combat or other danger prevents the

ability from working. For every three levels a celebrant

attains beyond 1st, she can target one additional crea-

ture with a single use of this ability (two at 4th level,

three at 7th level, and four at 10th level).

To  use  this  ability,  the  celebrant  makes  a  Perform

check.  Her  check  result  is  the  DC  for  each  affected

creatures Will save against the effect. If a creatures

saving  throw  succeeds,  the  celebrant

cannot  attempt  to  fascinate  that

creature  again  for  24

hours.  If  its  saving

throw  fails,  the  crea-

ture sits quietly and gazes at

the celebrant, taking no other

actions, for as long as she continues her

performance  and  concentration  (up  to  a

maximum of 1 round per celebrant of Sharess level). While fasci-

nated, a target takes a 4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions,

such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat (such as an

ally of the celebrant approaching the fascinated creature) requires

the celebrant to make a new Perform check and allows the creature

a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check

result.  Any  obvious  threat  (such  as  someone  drawing  a  weapon,

casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target) automati-

cally breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion),

mind-affecting ability.

Feline Familiar (Ex): A celebrant of Sharess can obtain a cat as

a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours but costs nothing (unlike the

summon familiar ability of a sorcerer or wizard). The cat serves as

a companion and servant. As the celebrant advances in level, her

familiar also increases in power. This cat familiar follows all the

rules for a sorcerers or wizards familiar, except that the celebrants

effective class level for the purpose of determining familiar bene ts

is twice her celebrant of Sharess level. Thus, a 3rd-level celebrants

familiar can speak with its master, as if the celebrant were a 6th-

level sorcerer or wizard.

A celebrant cannot have more than one familiar, and her cel-

ebrant  levels  do  not  stack  with  levels  of  any  other  class  for  the

purpose  of  determining  her  familiars  abilities.  If  she  has  levels

in another class that can summon a familiar, use either her level

in that class or twice her celebrant of Sharess level, whichever is

higher, to determine familiar bene ts.

Flirtation (Su): Once per day per celebrant of Sharess level, the

character can combine her Perform skill with her talents at  irta-

tion and seduction to produce magical effects similar to those of

the bardic music ability on those around her.

Starting a  irtation effect is a standard action. Some  irtation

effects require concentration, which means the celebrant must use a

standard action each round to maintain the effect. Even while using

a  irtation ability that doesnt require concentration, a celebrant

cannot cast spells or activate magic items by spell completion (such

as scrolls) or command word (such as wands).

Fury of the Tigress (Ex): At 2nd level, a celebrant of Sharess can

enter a state of rage, gaining phenomenal strength and durability

but becoming reckless and less able to defend herself. She temporar-

ily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and

a  +2  morale  bonus  on  Will  saves,  but  she  takes  a  2  penalty  to

Armor Class. This ability functions exactly like a barbarians rage.

A celebrant of Sharess can enter this state once per day at 2nd level,

twice per day at 6th level, and three times per day at 10th level.

Suggestion (Sp): A 4th-level or higher celebrant of Sharess can

make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that she has already fas-

cinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the celebrants

concentration  on  the  fascinate  effect  or  count  against  her  daily

limit on  irtation effects. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + celebrant

of Sharess level + celebrant of Sharesss Cha modi er) negates the

effect. This ability affects only a single creature. Suggestion is an

enchantment  (compulsion),  mind-affecting,  language-dependent

ability.

Pounce of the Tigress (Ex): At 5th level, a celebrant of Sharess

can make a full attack at the end of a charge.

Sanctuary (Sp): A celebrant of Sharess who is at least 7th level

can prevent creatures from attacking her or her allies in a manner

similar to the effect of the sanctuary spell. To use this ability, the

celebrant makes a Perform check. Her check result is the DC for

each affected creatures Will save against the effect. Any opponent

attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the celebrant or

any of her allies, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will

save. Success means the opponent can attack normally and is un-

affected by that use of the  irtation ability. If the save fails, the

opponent  cant  follow  through  with  the  attack,  that  part  of  its

action is lost, and it cant directly affect the celebrant or her allies

for the duration of the effect. Creatures not attempting to attack

remain  unaffected.  This  effect  does  not  prevent  opponents  from

using area or effect spells that would harm the celebrant or her

allies. If the celebrant attacks another creature, or her allies do so,

the sanctuary effect is broken.

Swiftness of the Tigress (Ex): When she reaches 8th level, a cel-

ebrant of Sharess can function as though affected by a haste spell.

This bene t lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to her cel-

ebrant of Sharess level. This duration need not be consecutivethe

celebrant of Sharess may break it up into increments as small as 1

round if she so desires. Ending the effect is a free action.

Inspire Desire (Su): At 10th level, a celebrant of Sharess can use

her  irtation ability to inspire love or desire in a creature she has

already fascinated. Using this ability does not break the celebrants

concentration on the fascinate effect, but it does count against her

daily  limit  on   irtation  effects.  A  Will  saving  throw  (DC  10  +

celebrant  of  Sharess  level  +  celebrant  of  Sharesss  Cha  modi er)

negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature.

The love effect of this ability causes the target to fall in love with

a speci ed creature, which must either be within sight of the target

creature at the time the effect is used, or else be speci ed only as

the next creature you see. The subject takes any opportunity to be

near the object of its affection and makes every effort to win that

creatures love.

APPENDIX

The  desire  effect  is  similar  to  the  love  effect,  except  that  the

target  seeks  any  opportunity  to  become  physically  intimate  with

the speci ed creature, short of causing it physical harm.

Inspire desire is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting

ability.

the  welfare  of  other  creatures  while  preventing  evil  forces  from

preying on innocents.

Most  Harper  paragons  have  training  as  rangers  or  Harper

agents, and many have also been bards. Clerics and paladins dedi-

cated to Deneir, Tymora, or Lliira also frequently pursue the path

of the Harper paragon.

Harper paragons are most common among the Harpers

working under Lady Cylyria in Berdusk. Only a few

can  be  found  in  the  ranks  of  the  politically

manipulative  Moonstars,  who  operate

under the leadership of Khelben Arunsun,

or the independent adventurers working

out  of  Shadowdale.  Harper  paragons

rarely experience any con icts of in-

branches of the organization.

Wizards, or the Zhentarim.

CLASS SKILLS

The Harper paragons class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy

(Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Gather  Information

(Cha), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (all) (Int), Listen (Wis),

Move  Silently  (Dex),  Perform  (Cha),  Pick  Pockets  (Dex),  Profes-

sion (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Speak Language (Int), Survival

(Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex). See Chapter 4 of the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  Harper  paragon

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Harper paragons gain no pro -

ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check penalties

for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When a new Harper paragon level

is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class

she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not,

however, gain any other bene t a character of that class would have

gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, improved chance

of turning or rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased

effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds

the level of Harper paragon to the level of some other spellcasting

class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known,

and caster level accordingly.

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she

became a Harper agent, she must decide to which class she adds each

level of Harper paragon for the purpose of determining spells per

day and spells known.

Aura of Good (Ex): The power of the characters aura of good

is equal to her Harper paragon level. If she has the aura of good

ability from another class, levels of that class stack with her Harper

paragon levels for the purpose of this ability.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a Harper paragon can use detect evil,

as the spell.

Harper Knowledge (Ex): At 1st level, the Harper paragon can

access knowledge in the same manner that a bard can. This ability

functions like the bardic knowledge ability, except that the bonus

for the check equals the characters Harper paragon level + her Int

modi er. If the Harper paragon has another such lore ability from

another source (such as bard, loremaster, or Harper agent levels),

her Harper paragon levels stack with levels of all other classes that

grant such an ability for the purpose of Harper knowledge checks.

Favored Enemy (Evil) (Ex): At 2nd level, a harper paragon gains

evil creatures of all kinds as a favored enemy. She gains a +1 bonus

on  Bluff,  Listen,  Sense  Motive,  Spot,  and  Survival  checks  when

using these skills against evil creatures. She also gains a +1 bonus on

weapon damage rolls against evil creatures. If the Harper paragon

has the favored enemy ability from another class (such as ranger)

and a particular evil creature also quali es as a favored enemy for

that class, the bonuses stack.

Celestial Spells (Ex): Upon reaching 3rd level, a harper paragon

can cast spells as if she were a celestial. Speci cally, she can learn

and cast any spell from Book of Exalted Deeds that has a celestial

component,  as  long  as  she  would  otherwise  qualify  to  cast  the

spell. (That is, the spell must appear on her spell list and be of a

spell level that she can cast, and the ability score that controls her

spellcasting must be high enough to allow her to cast spells of that

level. The Harper paragon can also cast spells that have the speci c

kind of celestial component that matches her alignmentarchon

if she is lawful good, guardinal if she is neutral good, or eladrin if

she is chaotic good.

Exalted Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a Harper paragon gains

Exalted Companion (see Book of Exalted Deeds) as a bonus feat if

she does not already have it. If she does not already have an animal

companion, she gains one now, as though she were a druid of a level

equal to her Harper paragon level. If she has the ability to summon

an animal companion from another class (such as druid or ranger),

her Harper paragon levels stack with levels of any classes that grant

this  bene t  for  the  purpose  of  determining  the  kind  of  exalted

companion she quali es for and its abilities.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 5th level and again at 10th level, the

Harper paragon may select one additional favored enemy from the

following list: the Church of Bane, the Cult of the Dragon, the Iron

Throne, the malaugryms, the Red Wizards, or the Zhentarim. The

Harper paragon gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive,

Spot, and Survival checks when using these skils agaisnt creatures

of its type. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls

against  such  creatures.  In  addition,  the  bonus  against  any  one

favored enemy of her choice (regardless of the class in which she

chose it) increases by 2.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a Harper paragon of at least 6th

level may attempt to smite an evil creature with one normal melee

attack.  She  adds  her  Charisma  bonus  (if  any)  to  the  attack  roll

and deals 1 extra point of damage per Harper paragon level. For

example, a 6th-level Harper paragon armed with a longsword would

deal 1d8+6 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high

strength or magical effects that would normally apply. If a Harper

paragon accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has

no effect but is still used up for that day.

The Harper paragon can use this ability twice per day at 8th

level and three times per day at 10th level.

Maiden of Pain

The goddess Loviatar is the divine embodiment of many of the

evil  acts  and  fetishes  described  in  Book  of  Vile  Darkness.  The

ultimate sadist and the patron of both sadists and masochists, the

Willing Whip is dedicated to pain and punishment. Loviatars most

dedicated servants, the maidens of pain, are depraved women who

literally make pain their meat and drink. They supplement their

addiction to dealing pain with an addiction to agonythe drug also

known as liquid pain.

Maidens of pain are drawn from the elite ranks of Loviatars

fundamentally twisted clergy, and they are the most warped of her

clerics. A few have levels in other classes besides cleric, most com-

monly rogue or assassin.

Maiden  of  pain  NPCs  work  outside  Loviatars  mainstream

church,  moving  from  place  to  place  to  ensure  that  the  goddesss

will is carried out. They serve as envoys, secret agents, and inquisi-

tors of the church.

Hit Die: d6.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a maiden of pain, a character must ful ll all

the following criteria.

Gender: Female.

Skill: Intimidate 4 ranks.

Feat: Violate Spell (Book of Vile Darkness).

Spells: Able to cast masochism and sadism as divine spells (Book

of Vile Darkness).

Patron Deity: Loviatar.

Special:  The  candidate  must  have  used  the  drug  agony  (liquid

pain) (Book of Vile Darkness).

CLASS SKILLS

The  maiden  of  pains  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Bluff  (Cha),  Concentration  (Con),  Craft  (Int),  Di-

plomacy  (Cha),  Gather  Information  (Cha),  Intimidate  (Cha),

Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowledge  (religion)  (Int),  Perform

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  maiden  of  pain

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Maidens of pain gain pro ciency

with  the  whip,  but  not  with  any  armor  or  shield.  Armor  check

penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand,

and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: Beginning at 2nd level, when a new

maiden of pain level is gained, the character gains new spells per

day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level

in cleric. She does not, however, gain any other bene t a character

of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or

rebuking undead, and so on), except for an increased effective level

of  spellcasting.  This  essentially  means  that  she  adds  the  level  of

maiden of pain to the level of cleric, then determines spells per day,

spells known, and caster level accordingly.

Agony Addiction (Ex): A maiden of pain gains a permanent ad-

diction to the drug agony, also known as liquid pain. However, her

addiction to the drug is mild and cannot grow worse. Each day that

she goes without a dose of agony, she takes 1d3 points of Dexterity

damage. In addition, the negative effects of the drug are blunted by

her intimate familiarity with pain. The initial effect of a dose of

agony is to stun her for 1d41 rounds and force her to take only a

single action each round for

1d4 minutes after that.

Extra Domain: A 1st-level maiden of pain gains access to the Pain

domain if she does not already have it, or another domain offered

by Loviatar if she does. She gains the granted power of this third

domain and can choose from its spell list as well as those of her other

domains when selecting her domain spells for the day. She can still

cast only one domain spell at each level (1st through 9th) per day,

but now she has three choices instead of two at each spell level.

Lasher (Su): A maiden of pain can use a whip to deliver touch

attacks. This ability effectively gives her 15-foot reach with a touch

spell or with her pain touch ability. If she desires, she can make a

normal attack with the whip when delivering a touch effect, but

in this case she must make a successful melee attack rather than a

touch attack. A maiden of pain can deliver a touch spell through

her whip even against creatures that are normally unaffected by

whip attacks.

Pain Touch (Su): Once per day, a 1st-level maiden of pain can use

a melee touch attack to deliver wracking pain to a single opponent.

If  she  succeeds  on  the  touch  attack,  the  opponent  must  make  a

Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + maiden of pain level + maiden

of pains Wis modi er). A creature that fails this saving throw is

stunned for 1 round, until just before the maiden of pains next

action. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and

creatures immune to critical hits cant be stunned. The maiden of

pain can use this ability twice per day at 4th level, three times per

day at 7th level, and four times per day at 10th level.

Improved  Trip  (Ex):  At  3rd  level,  a  maiden  of  pain  gains  the

bene ts of the Improved Trip feat when she is using a whip to make

the trip attempt. She need not meet the prerequisites for the feat,

but she can use it only when wielding a whip.

Improved  Disarm  (Ex):  A  6th-level  maiden  of  pain  gains  the

bene ts of the Improved Disarm feat when she is using a whip to

make the disarm attempt. She need not meet the prerequisites of

the feat, but she can use it only when wielding a whip.

Martyred

Champion of Ilmater

The church of Ilmater is well known both for the number of mar-

tyrs it generates and for the high degree of reverence it pays them.

It is the only church that has a saint called the Twice-Martyred,

and many of Ilmaters followers hope to follow the example of St.

Sollars. A martyred champion of Ilmater is halfway there. Having

already  offered  his  life  in  heroic  sacri ce  once,  he  perseveres  in

Ilmaters faith, ready and willing to be martyred again should the

circumstances demand it.

APPENDIX

Martyred champions of Ilmater come from all character classes,

since the path to martyrdom is universal. The class offers a mixture

of unique bene ts and advancement in a characters previous career.

Martyred champions stand outside of Ilmaters church hierar-

chy, since they are practically objects of veneration already. They

are free agents, utterly devoted to their deitys cause, and powerful

champions in the  ght against evil and suffering.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a martyred champion of Ilmater, a character

must ful ll all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Skills: Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, any one skill 9 ranks.

Feats: Endurance, Nimbus of Light (Book of Exalted Deeds).

Patron Deity: Ilmater.

Special: Must have died in heroic sacri ce and been returned

to life.

CLASS SKILLS

The martyred champion of Ilmaters class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int),

Heal (Wis), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Int), Ride (Dex),

and Spellcraft (Int). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the martyred champion

of Ilmater prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Martyred champions of Ilmater

gain no pro ciency with any weapon, armor, or shield. Armor check

penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance,

Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand,

and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: When the character attains an even-

numbered martyred champion level, he has a choice of bene t. He

can gain new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he

had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before

he added the prestige class, or he can gain a bonus feat of his choice.

He must meet any prerequisites for a feat in order to select it. If he

chooses the spellcasting level, he does not gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item

creation feats, improved chance of turning or rebuking undead, and

so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This

essentially means that he adds the level of martyred champion to

the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then de-

termines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

If  a  character  had  more  than  one  spellcasting  class  before  he

became a martyred champion of Ilmater, he must decide to which

class he adds each level of martyred champion for the purpose of

determining spells per day and spells known.

A  martyred  champion  of  Ilmater  is  free  to  choose  the  bonus

feat at one opportunity and the spellcasting level the next time the

decision arises, or vice versa. A character who is not a spellcaster

must choose the bonus feat.

Diehard (Ex): At 1st level, a martyred champion of Ilmater gains

Diehard as a bonus feat if he does not already have it.

Unarmed Strike (Ex): A martyred champion of Ilmater  ghts as

his deity doesunarmed. At 1st level, he gains Improved Unarmed

Strike as a bonus feat if he does not already have it. Like a monk,

a martyred champion can attack with either  st interchangeably,

or with elbows, knees, or feet. This ability allows him to make un-

armed strikes with his hands full and never as an off-hand attack.

Usually  a  martyred  champions  unarmed  strikes  deal  lethal

damage, but he can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with

no penalty on his attack roll. He has the same choice to deal lethal

or nonlethal damage while grappling.

A  martyred  champions  unarmed  strike  is  treated  both  as  a

manufactured weapon and as a natural weapon for the purpose of

spells and effects that enhance or improve either type (such as the

magic fang and magic weapon spells).

At 1st level, a martyred champions unarmed strike deals 1d6

points of damage if he is Medium, 1d4 if he is Small, or 1d8 if he is

Large. At 4th level, this damage increases to 1d8 if he is Medium,

1d6 if he is Small, or 1d10 if he is Large. At 8th level, his unarmed

damage increases again to 1d10 if he is Medium, 1d8 if he is Small,

or 2d8 if he is Large.

Fear Immunity (Ex): A 2nd-level martyred champion of Ilmater

is immune to fear (magical or otherwise).

Greater Endurance (Ex): At 3rd level, a martyred champion gains

a +4 sacred bonus on all the checks and saves improved by the En-

durance feat. Because this is a sacred bonus, it stacks with the bene t

of the Endurance feat.

Divine Grace (Su): At 4th level, a martyred champion of Ilmater

gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving

throws.

Holy Suffering (Su): Beginning at 5th level, whenever a martyred

champion of Ilmater takes at least 50 points of damage in a single

round and survives, he is surrounded by a radiant glow signaling

Ilmaters  favor.  He  gains  a  sacred  bonus  on  attack  rolls,  saving

throws, and skill checks equal to +1 for every 10 points of damage

he took in the previous round. This effect lasts for a number of

rounds equal to his martyred champion level. Although this effect

is similar to that of the masochism spell, this ability is not evil.

Damage  Reduction  (Su):  At  7th  level,  the  martyred  champion

gains damage reduction 10/evil. At 10th level, his damage reduc-

tion improves to 15/evil.

Communion (Su): Starting at 9th level, a martyred champion of

Ilmater is so intimate with his deity that he can ask a single ques-

tion each day as if casting a commune spell. Using this ability costs

10 XP.

Sustenance (Ex): A 9th-level martyred champion of Ilmater no

longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe. He still suffers hunger pangs

and burning lungs if he does not eat or breathe, but such sensations

are to be expected andlike most paindo not indicate a real need.

He takes no nonlethal damage and suffers no other ill effects from

hunger, thirst, suffocation, or drowning.

APPENDIX

Slime Lord

Though Ghaunadar is a member of the drow pantheon, he is not a

drow god at all. The Lord of Slime is a primordial deity of slimes

and  oozes,  revered  by  aboleths  and  ropers  as  well  as  outcast  and

rebellious  drow.  Slime  lords,  the  most  favored  of  Ghaunadars

servants,  are  not  clerics;  they  are  spies  and  in ltrators  who  can

change their shapes in order to move unnoticed among members

of any race. Though most begin their careers as humanoids, over

time they become increasingly similar to the aberration servitors

of Ghaunadar, which are known as ghaunadans.

Slime lords come from all backgrounds, but most were

once rogues or rogue/ ghters. Clerics of Ghauna-

dar sometimes give up their spell progressions to

become slime lords, and some merely dabble in the

slime lord class to supplement their divine magic.

Most slime lords are drow, though they can come

from any race. As servants of the god of outcasts,

they are outcasts in any societydrow,  surface

elf, or other. In the Underdark, they lead

small cults of Ghaunadars followers,

usually rebels against the rule of

Lolths clergy in drow cities.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  slime

lord,  a  character  must  ful ll  all

the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Skill: Disguise 6 ranks.

Feat:  Willing  Deformity

(Book of Vile Darkness).

Patron Deity: Ghaunadar.

CLASS SKILLS

The  slime  lords  class  skills  (and  the

key  ability  for  each  skill)  are  Ap-

praise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int),

Disguise  (Cha),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Forgery  (Int),  Hide  (Dex),

Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Move Silently

(Dex), and Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the slime lord prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Slime lords gain no pro ciency

with  any  weapon,  armor,  or  shield.  Armor  check  pen-

alties  for  armor  heavier  than  leather

applies to Swim checks.

Paralytic  Slime  (Ex):  A  slime

lords  pseudopods  are  coated

with  slime  that  can  paralyze

a foe. Any creature struck by

a  slime  lords  natural  attack

must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude

save (DC 10 + slime lord level +

slime lords Con modi er) or be

paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds.

Pseudopods (Ex): The physi-

cal  form  of  a  slime  lord  is

more  mutable  than  that

of  a  normal  creature  of  his

type.  As  a  move  action,  a

slime  lord  can  transform

his  hands  into  pseudopods

or  back  into  normal  hands.

He can make two natural at-

tacks  with  his  pseudopods

as  a  full  attack  action,  or

one  attack  as  a  standard

action.  Each  successful

attack deals 1d6 points of damage. The transformation lasts for up

to 1 round per slime lord level, though the character can change

his pseudopods back into hands before the expiration of the effect

as a move action.

The  slime  lord  can  use  this  ability  once  per  day  at  1st  level.

Thereafter, he gains one additional use per day for every two slime

lord levels. Thus, he can use the ability twice per day at 3rd level,

three times per day at 5th level, four times per day at 7th level, and

 ve times per day at 9th level.

Charming Gaze (Su): A slime lord of at least 3rd level can activate

a charming gaze for 1 round. Any creature that meets the slime

lords gaze must make a Will save (DC 10 + slime lord level + slime

lords Cha modi er) or be affected as if by a charm monster spell

(caster level equals slime lords character level). This ability is usable

once per day per slime lord level.

Sleep  Immunity  (Ex):  A  slime  lord  of  4th  level  or  higher  is

immune to sleep effects.

Alter Self (Su): A 5th-level or higher slime lord can change his

form as though he were under the in uence of the alter self spell.

He can use this ability at will, and any change to his form lasts until

he uses the ability again or chooses to revert to his natural form.

Damage Reduction (Ex): When the slime lord reaches 7th level,

his body is so mutable that he gains damage reduction 5/slashing

or piercing.

Polymorph Immunity (Ex): An 8th-level or higher slime lord is

immune to polymorphing.

Blindsight  (Ex):  When  the  slime  lord  reaches  9th  level,  his

whole body acts as a sensory organ, granting him blindsight out to

60 feet.

No Discernible Anatomy (Ex): A 10th-level slime lords form is

so amorphous that he is no longer subject to critical hits or sneak

attacks.  Furthermore,  he  gains  immunity  to  poison,  paralysis,

and stunning.

Yathrinshee

Because  she  is  a  goddess  of  undeath,  Kiaransalee  favors  servants

who combine their clerical mastery of the undead with arcane re-

search into negative energy and necromancy. Yathrinshees, the elite

ranks of Kiaransalees priests, are powerful masters of necromantic

magic, both arcane and divine.

In order to become a yathrinshee, a priestess must have access

to both divine and arcane magic. Virtually all yathrinshees were

clerics  and  wizards  before  adopting  the  prestige  class,  though  a

very  few  were  sorcerers  rather  than  wizards.  Most  are  specialist

necromancers rather than generalist wizards. The strict spellcasting

requirements  tend  to  keep  members  of  other  classes  out  of  the

yathrinshee class.

Yathrinshees  are  the  leaders  of  Kiaransalees  secretive  church

wherever it is found. They lead Kiaransalees followers in worship

and also in pursuing the churchs goalsplotting revenge against

the enemies of their goddess, killing her foes, and animating them

as undead.

Hit Die: d4.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a yathrinshee, a character must ful ll all the

following criteria.

Race: Drow.

Gender: Female.

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 7 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 7 ranks,

Perform (sing) 3 ranks.

Feats:  Lichloved  (Book  of  Vile  Darkness),  Spell  Focus  (necro-

mancy).

Spells: Able to cast animate dead as a divine spell and spectral

hand as an arcane spell.

Patron Deity: Kiaransalee.

CLASS SKILLS

The yathrinshees class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are

Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken indi-

vidually) (Int), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), and Spellcraft (Int).

See Chapter 4 of the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modi er.

CLASS FEATURES

All of the following are class features of the yathrinshee prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Pro ciency: Yathrinshees gain no pro ciency

with  any  weapon,  armor,  or  shield.  Armor  check  penalties  for

armor  heavier  than  leather  apply  to  the  skills  Balance,  Climb,

Escape  Artist,  Hide,  Jump,  Move  Silently,  Sleight  of  Hand,  and

City of the Spider Queen and Book of Vile Darkness

The  cult  of  Kiaransalee  is  on  the  rise  among  the  drow  of

Faern (as described, in part, in the City of the Spider Q ueen

adventure).  As  a  deity  of  undeath  and  revenge,  Kiaransalee

has much in common with the demon prince Orcus, whom she

once murdered and who remains, now that he has risen, her

most implacable foe. Followers of Kiaransalee make frequent

use  of  any  option  in  Book  of  Vile  Darkness  that  relates  to

undead, including the Lichloved feat, the lifedrinker prestige

class,  the  new  necromancy  spells,  and  the  new  undead  crea-

tures.

The yathrinshee prestige class is a new vile option for cler-

ics of Kiaransalee. If you are running the City of the Spider

Q ueen adventure, you could recreate both Irae Tsarran and

Cabrath  Nelinderra  as  yathrinshees  instead  of  single-class

clerics. Be sure to equip them with plenty of vile spells and

feats as well if you decide to do so.

APPENDIX

Tumble,  and  double  the  normal  armor  check  penalty  applies  to

Swim checks.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th

level,  the  character  gains  new  spells  per  day  (and  spells  known,

if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane and a

divine spellcasting class that she belonged to before she added the

prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other bene t a

character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item

creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective caster

level. This essentially means that she adds the level of yathrinshee

to  the  level  of  some  other  arcane

and  divine  class  the  character  has,

then determines spells per day, spells

known, and caster level accordingly.

For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rd-

level  wizard  who  takes  three  levels

in  yathrinshee  has  the  same  access

to  spells  as  a  7th-level  cleric  and

a  5th-level  wizard.  However,  her

wizard  familiar  doesnt  gain  any

new  abilities.

If a character had more than one

arcane  spellcasting  class  or  more

than  one  divine  spellcasting  class

before  she  became  a  yathrinshee,

she  must  decide  to  which  class  she

adds  each  level  of  yathrinshee  for

the  purpose  of  determining  spells

per day and spells known.

Rebuke  Undead  (Su):  The  charac-

ters  yathrinshee  levels  stack  with

her cleric levels for the purpose of

rebuking  or  commanding  undead.

For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rd-

level  wizard/2nd-level  yathrinshee

rebukes undead as a 7th-level cleric.

Necromancer  (Ex):  The  yathrinshee  has

unsurpassed power over death. When she casts

spells from the school of necromancy, all her spellcaster levels stack

for the purpose of determining her effective caster level. She does

not  gain  higher-level  spells  any  faster  than  normal  or  gain  any

additional  spells  per  day,  but  the  spells  she  casts  are  much  more

effective.

For example, a 5th-level cleric/3rd-level wizard/3rd-level yath-

rinshee has gained two effective level increases in both her cleric

class and her wizard class, giving her the spellcasting ability of a

7th-level cleric and a 5th-level wizard. Thus, when she casts any

necromancy spell, whether it is arcane or divine, her effective caster

level is 12th (cleric 7th + wizard 5th).

Threnody  (Su):  Once  per  day,  a

yathrinshee  of  2nd  level  or  higher

can sing a song of lament that can

unnerve opponents who are engaged

in combat with an undead creature.

In  effect,  any  undead  within  30

feet of the yathrinshee gains a gaze

attack  identical  to  the  unnerving

gaze of a chain devil. Any creature

that  meets  the  yathrinshees  eyes

must  make  a  Will  save  (DC  10  +

yathrinshee  level  +  yarthrinshees

Cha modi er) or take a 2 penalty

on  attack  rolls  for  1d3  rounds  be-

cause  it  sees  the  faces  of  departed

loved ones or bitter enemies.

If an undead creature actually is

the  animated  corpse  of  a  friend  or

companion of the yathrinshees op-

ponent, the save DC increases by 2

and the penalty is doubled (to 4).

Death  Ward  (Su):  A  yathrinshee

of 4th level or higher is immune to

death effects and negative energy as

though  protected  by  a  death  ward

spell.  An  undead  yathrinshee  instead

resistance.

Curse of the Revenancer (Su): Any creature slain by a yathrin-

shee of 5th level or higher rises immediately as a zombie under

her control.

Zone of Desecration (Su): At 7th level, the yathrinshee is continu-

ously surrounded by a 20-foot-radius aura of negative energy. The

effect is otherwise identical to that of the desecrate spell.

Keening (Su): At 10th level, the yathrinshee can keen once per

day. This ability works like the wail of the banshee spell, except that

it affects any number of creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread

centered on the yathrinshee.

Vile and

Exalted Deities

Faern is blessed (or cursed) with a large pantheon of deities, all of

whom who take a very active role in the course of the continents

history. Many of these deities embody the ideals of good and evil

in a variety of ways. Several of them have champions represented

among the prestige classes in the previous section or special feats

connected with their worship. Others manifest their vile or exalted

natures in the spells they grant to their clerics.

Many  of  the  domains  included  in  Book  of  Vile  Darkness  and

Book  of  Exalted  Deeds  are  appropriate  for  Faernian  deities  to

offer  to  their  clerics.  The  Faernian  pantheon  includes  several

close parallels to the vile and exalted deities described in those two

books. Malar, for example, is very similar to Karaan, the Beast God

described in Book of Vile Darkness, and it is quite appropriate to add

the Bestial domain to Malars list of available domains. The table

below indicates which deities of the Faernian and other pantheons

might  grant  access  to  the  vile  and  exalted  domains  presented  in

those two supplements.

Arch ends

and Paragons

The arch ends in Book of Vile Darknessthe demon princes and

archdevilsinhabit the layers of the Nine Hells and the Abyss just

as noted in that book. Of the demon princes described there, Orcus

and more recently Grazzt have probably played the most signi -

cant roles in Faern, while others not detailed there have occupied

more prominent positions than Demogorgon, Juiblex (whose name

and guise have been appropriated by Ghaunadaur in Faern), and

the others. These distinctively Faernian demon princes include Ba-

phomet, Eltab, Kostchtchie, Pazrael, and Yeenoghu. Outsider devil

princes include Gargauth (now a god) and Malkizid.

The paragons of Celestia described in Book of Exalted Deeds are

the rulers of the archons. In Faerns cosmology, archons dwell in

the House of the Triad, the home plane of Tyr, Torm, Ilmater, and

Helm. The paragon archons are the highest servants of these dei-

ties, and they are more subordinate to them than those described in

Book of Exalted Deeds are. Zaphkiel, the greatest of these archons,

is a  gure of mystery whose origin and true nature are unknown

to all except, legend says, to Tyr himself.

Talisid and the Five Companions, the paragons of the guardinals,

dwell in the House of Nature, along with a great number of dei-

ties whose portfolios are connected with nature. In a plane so well

populated  with  powerful  beings,  the  guardinal  paragons  tend  to

blend in with the crowd, but they retain their focus on protecting

their home plane from any incursion by evil forces.

Eladrins hail from two planes in Faerns cosmology: Arvandor

(home of the elven pantheon) and the Gates of the Moon, where

Selne resides. Queen Morwel resides in the Gates of the Moon with

her consort, Faerinaal, while Gwynharwyf wanders the two planes

independent of the eladrin court.

A cleric who has access to the Darkness domain can use either the

Darkness domain presented in Chapter 4 of this book or the one in

Book of Vile Darkness.

A draegloth cleric of Lolth can choose the Demonic domain as

one of her domains.

Variants: Races with

Level Adjustments8

What can you do if you want to play a genasi, a drow, or a svirf-

neblin, but your party is beginning at 1st level?

Under  the  basic  rules  for  playing  characters  with  level

adjustments,  you  cant  create  a  1st-level  character  of  a  race

powerful  enough  to  have  a  level  adjustment.  While  Savage

Species introduces monster classes that provide a way to play

nearly any intelligent monster from 1st level on up, it does not

cover the case of a humanoid race with a single racial Hit Die

(normally  supplanted  by  Hit  Dice  from  character  levels)  and

a level adjustment of +1 or higher. This situation pertains to

a number of the unusual races and subraces in the FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting.

Two  variant  systems  are  presented  in  the  following  sections.

Both provide ways of starting a character of a powerful race with

a 1st-level party of adventurers.U

Powerful Races at 1st Level8

Using this variant rule, you can create a 1st-level character using

any of the powerful races described in this book. Such a character

begins play with all of the normal characteristics for his race and

all of the normal class features for a 1st-level character of his class.

He also begins play with a number of negative level adjustments

equal to his races level adjustment. For each negative level adjust-

ment, he takes the following penalties.U

1 on skill checks and ability checks.

1 on attack rolls and saving throws.

1 on level checks (including caster level checks).

1 to the DC for any spell he casts or any other ability he uses

that allows a saving throw.

1 to any constant Armor Class bonus granted by race, such as a

natural armor bonus or the svirfneblins constant dodge bonus.

1 to racial level adjustment (to make the character effectively

1st level).U

When the character gains enough experience to advance a level,

he does not actually gain a class level. Instead, his negative level

adjustment  is  lessened  by  1  at  each  new  level  attained  until  it

reaches 0. At that point, the character has bought off his racial

level  adjustment.  He  has  one  class  level  and  his  full  racial  level

adjustment, so his effective character level (ECL) equals 1 + his

level adjustment.

For  example,  a  tie ing  has  a  +1  level  adjustment,  so  a

1st-level  tie ing  character  would  have  a  1  negative  level  ad-

justment. Her effective character level is 1st, since her negative

level adjustment cancels out her racial level adjustment. When

she gains 1,000 XP (enough to advance to 2nd level), she does

not gain a class level, but her negative level adjustment is elimi-

nated, making her the equivalent of a 2nd-level character (one

class level +1 level adjustment).

Likewise, a 1st-level drow character begins play with a 2 level

adjustment. When he gains 1,000 XP, his negative level adjustment

is reduced to 1. When he gains a total of 3,000 XP, it is eliminated

altogether. At that point, he is the equivalent of a 3rd-level charac-

ter, with one class level and a +2 level adjustment.U

Lesser Versions8

As an alternative to the use of negative level adjustments to offset

racial level adjustments at the lowest character levels, this variant

offers different versions of powerful races that arent as power-

ful. A lesser drow, for example, doesnt have all the traits and

abilities of a standard drow character, but she can be played as a

1st-level character right alongside characters of other races. Since

such characters never have to worry about level adjustments, they

are  sometimes  more  enjoyable  to  play  than  a  character  with  a

negative level adjustment, even if they lack some exciting features

of the race.

If  you  use  these  lesser  racial  versions  in  your  campaign,  you

should  use  them  across  the  boardfor  NPCs  as  well  as  player

characters. Thus, a party that includes a lesser drow should never

encounter drow from the Monster Manual in your game. Instead,

all the drow in your campaign should be lesser drow. Of course,

nobody calls them lesser drow, since all drow have the same racial

characteristics in the game.U

LESSER GRAY DWARVESU

Lesser duergar have the following racial traits.

Racial  Abilities:  These  traits  are  in  addition  to  the  standard

dwarf abilities in the Players Handbook, except where noted.U

+2  Constitution,  4  Charisma:  Lesser  duergar  are  extremely

withdrawn  and  guarded.  These  adjustments  replace  the  ability

adjustments given for dwarves in the Players Handbook.

Weapon Familiarity: Unlike other dwarves, lesser duergar do not

have weapon familiarity with the dwarven waraxe or dwarven

urgrosh.

+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, phantasms, and

paralysis: This trait replaces the dwarfs +2 racial bonus on saves

against poison, as given in the Players Handbook.

+2 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks: Lesser gray

dwarves excel at stealthy movement.

Spell-Like  Abilities:  1/dayenlarge  person.  Caster  level  equals

twice the lesser duergars class levels (minimum 3rd). These abili-

ties affect only the lesser duergar and whatever he carries.

Light Sensitivity: Lesser duergar are dazzled in bright sunlight

or within the radius of a daylight spell.U

APPENDIX

Darkvision:  Lesser  svirfneblin  can  see  in  the  dark  up  to  60

feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like

normal sight, and svirfneblin can function just  ne with no

light at all.

Stonecunning: This ability grants a lesser svirfneblin a +2 racial

bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as slid-

ing walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to

match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and

the like. Something that isnt stone but that is disguised as stone

also counts as unusual stonework. A lesser svirfneblin who merely

comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search

check as if he were actively searching, and a svirfneblin can use

the Search skill to  nd stonework traps as a rogue can. A lesser

svirfneblin can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth

underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.

Lesser svirfneblin have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate

ability that they get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone

in their underground homes.

+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like ef-

fects: Lesser svirfneblin are resistant to magic. This trait replaces

the +2 racial bonus on saving throws against illusions given for

gnomes in the Players Handbook.

+1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures: This trait

replaces the +4 dodge bonus against monsters of the giant type

given for gnomes in the Players Handbook.

Weapon Familiarity: Lesser svirfneblin may treat gnome hooked

hammers as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons.

Add +1 to the Dif culty Class for all saving throws against illu-

sion spells cast by lesser svirfneblin.

Spell-Like Abilities: 1/dayresistance, daze, lullaby. Caster

level  equals  one-half  character  level,  DC  10  +  spell  level  +

Cha modifier.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Hide  checks:  A  svirfneblin  is  an  expert  at

remaining unseen. This bonus improves to +4 underground.

Favored Class: Rogue. This trait replaces the favored class entry

for gnomes in the Players Handbook.U

LESSER DROWU

Lesser drow have the following racial traits.UQ

Racial Abilities: These traits are in addition to the standard elf

abilities in the Players Handbook, except where noted.U

+2 Dexterity, 2 Constitution: The lesser drow have ruthlessly

selected  for  agility  at  the  expense  of  hardiness  over  countless

generations.  These  adjustments  replace  the  ability  adjustments

given for elves in the Players Handbook.

Darkvision: Lesser drow can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Dark-

vision  is  black  and  white  only,  but  it  is  otherwise  like  normal

sight, and lesser drow can function just  ne with no light at all.

This ability replaces the low-light vision noted for elves in the

Players Handbook.

Weapon  Pro ciency:  Lesser  drow  are  automatically  pro cient

with the hand crossbow, rapier, and short sword. These pro cien-

cies replace those of standard elves.

+2  racial  bonus  on  Will  saves  against  spells  and  spell-like

effects.

Spell-Like Abilities: A lesser drow with a Charisma score of at

least  10  has  the  following  spell-like  abilities:  1/daydancing

lights, daze, touch of fatigue. Caster level equals the lesser drows

class levels.

Light  Blindness:  Abrupt  exposure  to  bright  light  (such  as

sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds lesser drow for 1 round. On

subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the

affected area.

Favored Class: Wizard (male) or cleric (female). This trait replaces

the favored class entry for elves in the Players  Handbook.U

LESSER PLANETOUCHEDU

All lesser planetouched have the following racial trait in common,

in addition to all the racial traits detailed elsewhere in this book.U

Planetouched: Planetouched are humanoids (not outsiders) with

the planetouched subtype. They are susceptible to spells and ef-

fects that speci cally target both humanoids or outsiders. Charm

person works against them, and so does banishment. This trait

replaces the outsider entry in each planetouched description.U

LESSER DEEP GNOMESU

Lesser svirfneblin have the following racial traits.UQ

Racial  Abilities:  These  traits  are  in  addition  to  the  standard

gnome abilities in the Players Handbook, except where noted.U

2 Strength, +2 Dexterity: Lesser deep gnomes are quick but not

terribly strong. These adjustments replace the ability adjustments

given for gnomes in the Players Handbook.

A Web Enhancement for the FORGOTTEN REALMS Players Guide to Faern Accessory

Monster

Update

Conversion  of  the  monsters  presented  in  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting and Monstrous Companion: Monsters of Faern is

fairly straightforward. This appendix summarizes the changes to mon-

ster  skills  and  feats,  damage  reduction,  type  and  subtype,  and  other

information required to bring all of the monsters presented in those

two books up to date with the latest version of the core rulebooks.

The statistics given here indicate the changes to existing statistics

required to update the creatures to v.3.5. They are not full statistics

blocks. Each entry provides the following revised information about

each monster.

MMoonnsstteerr:: Type  (Subtype);  Base  Attack/Grapple;  Space/Reach;

Damage Reduction; Skills; Feats; Level Adjustment; Notes. Entries

omitted from this list have not changed.

Special Attacks/Qualities

Typical Spells

These elements are as follows.

Space/Reach: Each monsters space/reach is indicated in its entry.

Base Attack/Grapple: Each monsters base attack and grapple are

indicated in its entry.

Damage Reduction:Each monster that has damage reduction has

a new entry that conforms to the new damage reduction rules. A few

monsters  that  did  not  have  damage  reduction  in  their  original

entries have gained it under the revised D&D rules.

Skills:A complete, revised skill entry takes into consideration new

skill point calculations, new synergy bonuses, and changed or deleted

skills.

Feats: A  complete,  revised  feats  entry  takes  into  consideration

new feat calculations and new feats.

Level Adjustment: A level adjustment is specified here for every

monster that could be appropriate as a player character or cohort in

a  D&D  campaign  below  20th  level.  As  in  the  revised  Monster

Manual,level adjustments are not included for monsters whose level

adjustments would make them epic-level characters, or for creatures

with  Intelligence  scores  of  2  or  below,  or  for  creatures  otherwise

deemed inappropriate for use as PCs or cohorts.

Notes: Any other change to the monster is indicated here. Such

adjustments  might  include  a  change  in  type  (since  the  Beast  and

Shapechanger  types  have  been  eliminated),  modified  statistics

because  of  changes  in  feats,  adjustments  to  energy  resistance,

reminders  about  changed  rules  that  the  monster  utilizes  (such  as

cold and fire subtypes), and, in a few cases, errata to the monsters

original entry.

Special Attacks/Qualities: Additions, deletions, or major changes

in these categories are indicated here.

Typical Spells:Any monster that uses spells has a typical spell list

given here.

In  addition  to  the  information  below,  remember  the  following

general rule: If a monster has a common special attack, special qual-

Phaerimms are evil magicians who would gladly erase all other beings

from  existence.  Thus  far  they  have  not  done  so,  probably  because

they  would  consequently  lack  for  serviceable  slaves  to  torture  for

sport.  Millennia  ago,  the  phaerimms  plotted  to  destroy  all  life  in

Faern. They succeeded in toppling the mighty Netherese empire and

devastating  the  area  now  known  as  the  Anauroch  desert,  but  they

were foiled by the intervention of the elder sharn. The sharn impris-

oned  most  of  the  phaerimms  in  a  magic  field  beneath  Anauroch.

Only a few escaped imprisonment. Some of these escapees now live in

Myth Drannor, squandering their power on internal political squab-

bles.  Others  have  conquered  the  beholder  city  of  Ooltul  and  are

attempting to break through the sharns barrier to free their fellows.

A phaerimm has a conical body and an ovoid head. The head disk

contains an immense, toothed maw and is surrounded by four clawed

arms.  Beneath  the  top  disk,  the  phaerimms  long,  sinuous  body

tapers down to a lethal stinger. At birth, a phaerimm is only a foot

or two long, but it can grow as large as 30 feet in advanced old age.

Along with its increasing size, a phaerimm develops its innate mag-

ical ability. A hatchling casts spells as a 1st-level sorcerer, while a

centuries-old revered elder is a 19th-level caster.

If phaerimms were less evil, they would be more alien and difficult

to  understand,  but  their  overwhelming  drive  toward  inflicting  pain

makes  them  somewhat  predictable.  They  communicate  with  one

another by varying the wind speed around their bodies and with others

using telepathy. They understand Common and several other languages.

Combat

Phaerimms can be dangerous combatants, but they view purely phys-

ical combat as a sign of weakness. A phaerimm that uses its stinger

or weapons to defend itself is assumed to have insufficient magical

abilities. Consequently, phaerimms make physical attacks only as a

last  resort,  even  at  younger  ages  when  they  lack  powerful  magic.

Young phaerimms do sometimes stoop to using masterwork swords,

and they suffer no disgrace for it so long as they use Tensers float-

ing disk to carry the weapons whenever they are out of combat.

As  spellcasters,  phaerimms  favor  charm,  command,  and  illusion

effects  over  direct  damage  spells,  but  they  are  not  shy  about  letting

loose  a  fireball  if  necessary.  Powerful  elder  phaerimms  often  have

charmed or dominated beings fighting for them. In fact, phaerimms

sometimes pick fights simply so that they can watch their enemies being

forced to hack apart their own friends. Phaerimms also enjoy summon-

ing  outsiders,  but  they  are  generally  too  proud  to  use  low-level  sum-

moning spells to call up common animals and other minor creatures.

IImmppllaanntt  ((EExx)):: As  a  standard  action,  a  phaerimm  can  use  its

stinger  to  lay  eggs  inside  a  paralyzed  creature.  The  young  emerge

about  90  days  later,  literally  devouring  the  host  from  inside.  A

remove disease spell rids a victim of the eggs, as does a successful DC

20 Heal check by someone with ranks that skill. If the check fails,

the healer can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals

1d4 points of damage to the patient.

PPooiissoonn ((SSuu)):: Stinger, Fortitude save (DC 15); initial damage paral-

ysis for 2d4 rounds, secondary damage paralysis for 1d3 hours. Par-

alyzed creatures levitate, helpless, a few feet off the ground.

SSppeellllss:: A phaerimm casts arcane spells as a sorcerer (caster level

equals phaerimms Hit Dice).

DDeetteecctt MMaaggiicc ((SSpp)):: A hatchling phaerimm can use detect magic

at will (caster level equals phaerimms Hit Dice).

FFlliigghhtt ((EExx)):: A phaerimms body is naturally buoyant, allowing it

to fly at a speed of 30 feet. This buoyancy also grants it a perma-

nent feather fall effect (as the spell) with personal range.

FFuullll VViissiioonn ((EExx)):: As it ages, a phaerimms natural ability to detect

magic  expands.  A  juvenile  phaerimm  can  see  invisible  or  ethereal

creatures  to  a  range  of  120  feet,  as  though  constantly  under  the

effect of a see invisibility spell. An adult phaerimm can see magical

auras to a range of 120 feet, as though constantly under the effect

of  an  arcane sight spell.  An  elder  phaerimm  sees  as  though  con-

stantly under the effect of a true seeing spell.

PPhhaaeerriimmmm MMaaggiicc:: Phaerimms cast their sorcerer spells as if they

were  spell-like  abilities.  Thus,  they  require  no  verbal,  somatic,  or

material components.

Phaerimm Characters

A phaerimms favored class is sorcerer. Its sorcerer levels stack with

its  base  spellcasting  ability  for  the  purpose  of  determining  spells

known, spells per day, and other effects dependent on caster level. A

phaerimm character likewise uses the sum of its racial spellcasting

levels  and  appropriate  class  levels  to  determine  the  abilities  of  its

familiar, though it cannot acquire a familiar until it takes at least

one level in the sorcerer class.
