Welcome to the Silver Marches! This is

a land like no other in Faern. Home

to  a  diverse  population  of  folk  dedi-

cated  to  carving  prosperity  and  order  from  the  forbidding

wilderness, the area remains a little-explored and largely un-

conquered territory inhabited by war-hungry orc hordes, hos-

tile giants, and an array of bloodthirsty monsters.

The  inhabitants  of  this  northern  land  share  their  terri-

tory  with  dangers  that  lurk  in  every  forest,  alpine  valley,

and mountain passes. Folk who leave the shelter of the city

walls must go armed and go carefully, lest they fall victim to

one  of  the  many  horrors  waiting  to  claim  its  next  victim.

And hanging over every tavern meal and every merchants

bargain is the unspoken fear that this might be the day that

King Obould Many-Arrows or some other great orc chief de-

cides  to  hurl  his  army  of  warriors  out  of  the  mountains

against the cities and homesteads of the Marches.

Feral  savages  and  prowling  monsters  are  not  the  only

perils  of  this  land.  Ice  and  snow  and  howling  winds  cold

enough to freeze the marrow of a red dragons bones wait to

claim the lives of the unprepared or unwary. In the foothills

of the Nether Mountains, a pleasant spring day can become

a raging blizzard in the blink of an eye, while strength-sap-

ping  frosts  can  settle  over  the  depths  of  the  Moonwood

overnight. The weather is often a travelers worst enemy in

these northerly lands, and those who fail to give nature the

respect that is her due soon find themselves at her mercy.

As if these dangers were not sufficient, the Silver Marches is

under daily threat from foes that its citizens cannot easily see.

Minions of evil organizations such as the Arcane Brotherhood,

the  People  of  the  Black  Blood,  and  the  Church  of  Shar  have

wormed  their  way  into  the  very  heart  of  the  confederations

greatest cities. These spies seek to bring about the downfall of the

Silver Marches for reasons that they do not share with outsiders.

Some  merely  desire  conquest  and  power,  while  others  have

age-old grudges to settle with the new Speaker of the Marches,

the High Lady Alustriel herself. Travelers must exercise due

caution,  for  they  cannot  know  whether  the  jovial  merchant

theyve just met is what he seems, or an agent for a ruthless power

intent on bringing down what the defense pact has wrought.

Yet despite all these dangers, there is still hope that the

Silver Marches may one day be free from the host of dan-

gers that beset the land. The civilized inhabitants of this land

are determined to fight for their survival, and the continua-

tion of their dream, despite the odds stacked against them.

Many are committed to making the Silver Marches a haven

for like-minded folk, and have dedicated themselves to pre-

serving what they have already achieved.

To  this  end,  Lady  Alustriel  strives  to  ensure  that  the

leaders  of  the  confederation  maintain  their  focus  on  re-

solving its mutual problems and concerns. Meanwhile her

allies strive to deal with the most pressing dangers arrayed

against  the  cities,  combing  the  wilderness  for  clues  and

hints to King Oboulds intentions and other, unseen threats

lurking  in  the  wilds.  The  power  of  the  dwarfholds  grows

steadily,  and  their  kings  are  well  aware  of  the  orc  threat

poised to sweep down upon them.

Introduction

Exploring the Wilds: The Silver Marches is not to be trav-

eled lightly. All manner of dangers and threats lurk in its dense

forests, rolling hills, and steep mountain passes. This chapter

details the flora and fauna of the area, and also examines how

the inhospitable climate of the Silver Marches affects charac-

ters and their activities. Random encounter tables and weather

tailored specifically to the region are included here.

Cities of the Silver Marches: This chapter takes a look at

the six members of the confederation (Silverymoon, Sunda-

bar,  Citadel  Felbarr,  Citadel  Adbar,  Everlund,  and  Mithral

Hall). It also covers three smaller settlements that enjoy the

leagues  protec-

tion,  or  at  least

its  benign  neg-

lect:  Deadsnows,

Quaervarr,  and

the  Zhent  settler

town of Newfort.

People  of  the

Silver  Marches:

This  chapter  is

about living, work-

ing,  and  adventur-

ing  in  the  Silver

Marches.  It  fea-

tures  a  detailed

look at the areas

recent  history

and a discussion

on  the  agree-

ment that formed

the league.

Politics  and  Power:

How  did  the  Silver

Marches become a polit-

ical entity? What are the

details  of  the  confedera-

tion, and how is it enforced?

Who  are  the  allies  and  ene-

mies of the Silver Marches? This

chapter  answers  these  questions

and provides detailed information on

the forces attempting to ensure that the

confederation does not achieve its goals.

Heroes  of  the  North:  This  chapter  pres-

ents  six  new  prestige  classes  common  to  the

Silver  Marches:  the  giant-killer,  the  horde-

breaker,  the  knight-errant  of  Silverymoon,  the

orc scout, the peerless archer, and the wild scout.

Monsters of the Marches: Four new monsters and three

varieties of animal common to the Silver Marches are pre-

sented in this chapter, including deer, elk, red tiger, branta,

giant raven, rock wyrm, and snowcloak.

Adventures in the North: The last chapter in this sourcebook

contains four adventures. Black Fury describes Claw Hollow, a

secret stronghold of the People of the Black Blood. Dead Orc

Pass deals with the dangers of Dead Orc Pass and the Torn-

skulls orcs who lurk there. Telkouns Tower details the hidden

vale of High Thorog and Telkoun, its sinister master. Finally,

Most  Faernians  think  of  the  North  as  a

savage,  untamed  wilderness  of  shrieking

blizzards,  snow-capped  mountains,  and

trackless forests, haunted by terrible mon-

sters and marauding hordes of bloodthirsty orcs. In hundreds

of blood-curdling tales of danger and hardship, the North is

a  cold,  lawless,  and  vast  landscape  no  one  will  ever  tame.

Grim  dwarfholds,  proud  barbarians,  and  half-legendary  elf

realms may stand for a short time in these fierce lands, but

none  will  last.  An  orc  horde  or  a  flight  of  dragons  could

sweep them all away tomorrow . . . leaving nothing but mile

upon unmapped mile of wilderness.

Or so say the folk of the South. Roads and soaring cities

and  prosperous  hedge-walled  farms  may  be  scarcer  in  the

Savage Frontier than in warmer lands, but to say that the

area is uncivilized and always has been is simply a mistake.

If  the  North  has  always  been  a  howling  wilderness,  who

delved all those abandoned mines, and who raised all those

ruined towers?

A Brief History

of the North

The lands that now comprise the Silver Marches looked very

different  thousands  of  years  ago.  In  those  days,  there  was  no

Anauroch desert yet. All lands but the coldest mountains and

rocky moors were covered in deep forest, split by rivers running

very  much  where  they  do  today.  Deep  in  the  mists  of  dawn,

elves raised their first and mightiest realms in this area: Ary-

vandaar, in the depths of the High Forest; Illefarn, along the

northern Sword Coast; and Miyeritar, which is now the blasted

High Moor. For many thousands of years these realms endured.

The dwarves of Delzoun conquered mountains and caverns

from the Spine of the World to the Narrow Sea, where the

western  edge  of  Anauroch  now  lies.  Goblins  flourished

everywhere, and orcs rose in the northernmost peaks and glaciers.

Humans,  too,  lived  in  the  North.  They  learned  magic

from elves, and humans and orcs fought over the ruins left

when the great elf kingdoms made war upon each other. The

first human realm of note was Illusk, now little more than

an  echo  in  the  city  of  Luskan.  Illusk  lay  along  the  Sword

Coast, though its true extent is only guesswork now. Where

the  dwarf  realm  of  Delzoun  reached  its  southeast  border,

Netheril began. This mighty empire, the second great human

land  in  the  North,  grew  about  the  Narrow  Sea  between

4,000 and 3,000 DR. In their arrogance, the humans of

Netheril thought to work greater, more reckless magics than

the elves had ever dared to master.

The wizards of Netheril harnessed the very power of the

Weave  itself,  using  its  unbelievable  might  to  give  life  to

wonders  and  terrors  never  before  seen  in  Faern.  Even  as

the wizards of Netheril feuded, the phaerimmsthe secret

enemy of Netherilcrafted a dire sorcery and poisoned the

heart of the human realm with a magical desert. Netherils

catastrophic  end  came  in  339  DR,  the  Year  of  Sundered

Webs,  when  the  archwizard  Karsus  attempted  a  spell  that

would transform him into a godbut failed, and in his fall

destroyed Mystryl, the goddess of magic, and any great work

sustained by the Art.

The survivors of Netheril scattered as orcs swept out of

mountains everywhere in the North in numbers never seen

before or since. The ancient dwarf realm of Delzoun fell in

100  DR.  Alone  among  the  realms  of  the  North,  the  elf

realm of Eaerlann held against the orc tide. Some of the de-

scendants of the Netherese founded or occupied the north-

ern  holds  that  would  become  Ascalhorn,  Silverymoon,

Everlund,  and  Sundabar.  Others  sank  into  barbarism,

mingled with the Illuskans, and became the Uthgardt peoples.

The Lay of the Land

Surviving  elves  of  Illefarn,  dwarves,  Netherese  descen-

dants, and Northlanders banded together against the attacks

of the reaver-races in 523 DR to form the short-lived realm

of Phalorm, also known as the Realm of Three Crowns. The

Fallen Kingdom, as it came to be known, held back the orcs

and  goblins,  only  to  be  swept  away  by  the  Horde  of  the

Wastes in 615 DR. Phalorms warriors and mages spent their

dying  days  lashing  out  against  all  the  reavers  they  could

reach,  depleting  the  ranks

of the giants and goblinkin

for some centuries.

In 882 DR, the haughty

wizard-lords  of  Ascalhorn

brought  about  the  citys

doom. First lured into dark-

ness by a secret incursion of

devils,  the  mighty  wizards

summoned demons to fight

off  the  threat  within,  and

the city fell to the demons.

The  demons  overran  the

citys  neighbors,  the  elf

realm  of  Eaerlann,  and  the

dwarf  realm  of  Ammarin-

dar.  With  Eaerlanns  fall,

the old realms of the North

were  no  more.  Of  the  old

lands,  only  Evereska  and  a

few of the dwarf citadels sur-

vived, isolated fortresses in a

hostile wilderness.

But new realms were rising

in place of the old. Near the

mouth  of  the  Dessarin,  Wa-

terdeep  rose  swiftly  to

become  the  anchor  of  the

North.  From  it,  settlers  re-

claimed  the  Dessarin  and

lower Delimbiyr valleys and

settled  Secomber,  Loudwa-

ter,  Llorkh,  Triboar,  and

Longsaddle.  Silverymoon,

founded in 574 DR at a fly-

speck  river  crossing,  grew

steadily into the Gem of the

North. Roads, trails, and trading

patterns  were  established,  and  the

North opened up.

Like their predecessors, these new cities and

kingdoms  also  struggled  against  the  hostile  hordes

and  monsters  plaguing  the  region.  In  1235  DR,  a

huge orc horde swept down from the north-

ernmost  peaks  south  over  all  the  lands  to

Calimshan,  besieging  Waterdeep  and  plun-

dering all other settlements in their path. Armies and wiz-

ards  hastily  gathered  to  put  a  halt  to  the  hordes

depredations before Calimshan was swept away. Though the

civilized hosts prevailed, orc raids continued across western

Faern until 1241 DR. In a year of determined orc-slaying,

the  armies  of  the  west  temporarily  exterminated  the

tuskers  in  southern  lands,  and  reduced  them  to  a  few

broken  bands  in  the  remote  North.  While  the  orcs  licked

their wounds, the shield dwarves of the North mustered for

a campaign aimed at recovering their long-lost lands. The

first generation of dwarf warriors born after the Thunder-

ing  of  1306  DR  grew  to  adulthood,  took  up  arms,  and

swelled  the  ar-

mies of the stout

folk.  The  first

significant  dwarf

conquest  of  this

great effort came

in  1356  DR,

when  Bruenor

B a t t l e h a m m e r

slew  the  shadow

dragon Shimmer-

gloom,  drove  out

its  servant  duer-

gar,  and  pro-

claimed  himself

the  Eighth  King

of Mithral Hall.

Yet  reavers

never  ceased  to

raid.  As  summer

drew  down  in

1367 DR, a horde

of  one  hundred

fifty  thousand

orcs  under  King

Greneire  charged

down  from  the

northern  ranges

and  struck  at  the

Citadel  of  Many

Arrows, held by King

four

months  the  two  orc

armies  clawed  at  each

other,  until  Obould  slew

Greneire  in  single  combat,

breaking his horde. Dwarves of Clan

Warcrown, bolstered by troops from Sil-

verymoon, attacked the exhausted Many

Arrows  orcs  and  seized  the  Citadel.

Obould fled north to hide in the Spine

of  the  World,  and  King  Emerus  War-

crown was enthroned in triumph in the Citadel,

Obould.  For

restored to its old dwarf name of Felbarr.

In  the  hard  winter  of  1368  DR,  troll  at-

tacks on the town of Nesm grew wild and fre-

quent. Something was driving the trolls out of

the  moors.  That  something  proved  to  be  warbands  of  fog

giants,  cloud  giants,  and  hill  giants,  themselves  displaced

from  their  homes  in  the  Spine  of  the  World  by  (among

others) Oboulds orcs. Later that year came the bold capture

of Hellgate Keep by the Blue Bear Uthgardt tribe.

Dire bears are best avoided

The Lay of the Land

In 1369 DR, fiends from Hellgate attacked Silverymoon

and  Sundabar.  They  burned  much  of  Sundabar  before  they

were forced out, but Alustriels magic defended Silverymoon.

Hellgate Keep promptly turned to attack the Citadel of the

Mists,  abode  of  the  mysterious  Mistmasterbut  he  man-

aged, by means of a great magic and Harpers who sacrificed

their lives to deploy it, to destroy Hellgate Keep in a great

explosion.  The  armies  of  Everlund,  acting  in  concert  with

the good folk of the High Forest, slaughtered the surviving

tanarri  of  Hellgate  Keep.  Turlang  of  the  treants  moved

swiftly to march the forest north and east, surrounding the

ruins of Hellgate Keep and incidentally closing the area to

human trade and commerce.

Over  the  last  three  years,  troll  and  giant  depredations

have  grown  ever  more  dangerous,  threatening  the  fragile

peace  of  the  North.  To  stand  against  the  forces  of  evil,

High Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon called the leaders of

all the important settlements to council in 1371 DR. From

Old  Delzoun,  the  Moonlands,  and  the  Rauvin  Vale  came

elf,  human,  and  dwarf  lords  to  seek  answers  to  their

common  troubles.  Out  of  that  oft-stormy  meeting  came

the  High  Ladys  Alliance,  a  confederation  of  city-states

known as the League of the Silver Marches.

Geographic Overview

Despite  maps,  scrying,  and  ever-better  communications,

few persons can hope to truly know the entire North. Its

mountains  and  forests  are  so  sparsely  settled  by  civilized

folk, and are such difficult, monster-haunted terrain, that

most experts know little more than major landmarks and a

few safe routes. There are good reasons why the area is still

popularly  known  as  the  Savage  Frontier.  A  more  reason-

able  aspiration  might  be  to  explore  the  Silver  Marches

proper,  since  the  region  represents  only  a  portion  of  the

North.  But  the  Silver  Marches  still  sprawls  almost  five

hundred  miles  from  the  Surbrin  to  Anauroch,  and  three

hundred miles from the depths of the High Forest to the

forbidding peaks of the Spine of the World.

Silver  Marches  itself  is  a  confusing  name.  Everyone

agrees that the area is anchored by the great city of Silvery-

moon, and it includes five other great cities and many lesser

settlementsbut just where, in a land where law and order

often extends only as far as the length of a swordblade, are

its borders?

The six major signatories in the league of the Marches are

Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Everlund, Mithral Hall, Sil-

verymoon,  and  Sundabar.  Their  leaders  all  swore  fealty  to

Alustriel, but still rule their own communities and command

their own guards, soldiers, and warbands. These forces see to

local gates, walls, and jails, and usually patrol the immediate

surroundings of their settlement to drive off or slay lurking

monsters, harry bandits and brigands, and prevent surprise

raids  and  attacks  against  local  homesteaders  or  travelers

passing through the region.

The  sages  of  Silverymoon  define  the  Silver  Marches  as

consisting of three main regions. First is the Rauvin Vale,

the  lands  along  the  River  Rauvin  from  where  it  joins  the

Surbrin to where it enters the Nether Mountains. Second is

Old  Delzoun,  the  region  north  of  the  Nether  Mountains

and south of the Cold Woods and the Ice Mountains. The

third part is the Moonlands (as the locals refer to it), the

lands north of Silverymoon between the River Surbrin and

the  Cold  Wood.  The  mountains,  moors,  and  forests  sur-

rounding  these  regions  form  the  farthest  borders  of  the

Silver Marches.

Lands and Features

The Silver Marches is made up mainly of three valleys and

three mountain ranges, all running in a generally east-west

direction. In the extreme north, the Spine of the World and

the Ice Mountains form a great wall protecting the Silver

Marches  from  the  rigors  of  the  tundra  and  ice  beyond.

Citadel Adbar is the most remote outpost of civilization in

this region.

Descending from these great, frozen peaks into the por-

tion of Old Delzoun between the Spine of the World and the

Rauvin Mountains, the traveler crosses the northernmost of

the Marches valleysa region sometimes known as the Cold

Vale. This portion of the Marches is virtually desolate. Great

forests and steep foothills that would be known as mountains

in lesser lands make travel in this area scarcely less difficult

than in the mountains to the north.

Dividing the northern portion of Old Delzoun from the

southern  are  the  Rauvin  Mountains,  a  barrier  almost  one

hundred  miles  long  and  thirty  miles  wide  at  its  greatest

extent.  Orcs  and  other  humanoids  infest  these  mountains,

making it dangerous to approach them too closely.

South of the Rauvin Mountains lies the heart of Old Del-

zoun, a great vale dominated by the city of Sundabar. Sund-

abar  and  its  environs  are  one  of  the  more  heavily  settled

parts of the Marches, although the freeholds and homesteads

thin out to nothing twenty miles or so from the city. The

vale narrows toward the east as the Nether Mountains veer

sharply  north  and  almost  meet  the  Rauvin  range  before

meeting  the  Cold  Vale  and  widening  out  to  a  single  broad

valley east of the Rauvins.

The Nether Mountains lie south of Sundabars valley, an

even more imposing rampart than the Rauvin Mountains on

the other side. The Nether Mountains consist of two mighty

ranges spanning more than three hundred miles from east to

west,  although  two  hilly  gaps  break  up  the  wall  of  peaks.

Dangerous  monsters  such  as  perytons,  dragons,  and  other

large predators haunt this range; most folk do not venture

into the maze of foothills, gorges, and jagged peaks.

South and west of the Nether Mountains lies the Rauvin

Vale, a broad and fertile valley along the course of the River

Rauvin.  Its  eastern  side  is  dominated  by  Everlund,  and  its

western reaches by Silverymoon itself. The stretch between

the two cities is wild and difficult, as the westernmost peak

of the Nethers broods over the river valley and the Silver-

wood presses in close on the far bank. The Rauvin Vale west

of  Silverymoon  and  east  of  Everlund  is  the  most  densely

populated region of the Silver Marches, though by the stan-

dards of more southerly lands such as Amn or Cormyr, its

scattered farms and holdings are still a wild frontier.

The Lay of the Land

The Arn Forest

A  stretch  of  pine  woods  and  muskeg  bogs  encompassing

about  one  thousand  square  miles,  the  Arn  Forest  lies  on

the northeast flank of the Nether Mountains. To the east,

its  trees  thin  out  to  scrub  pines  and  then  vanish  alto-

gether  with  the  encroachment  of  Anauroch.  In  a  region

where  folk  are  accustomed  to  traveling  long  miles  be-

tween  tiny  hamlets  or  freeholds,  the  Arn  Forest  is  re-

garded  as  empty  wilderlandwhich  means  that  it  is  a

truly remote and rarely traveled area.

In the drier eastern reach of the forest lies Graevelwood, a

small hidden clan of rock gnomes, whose home consists of a

warren of tunnels and workshops beneath a rocky crag. The

Graevelwood  gnomes  are  expert  trackers  and  scouts.  The

clanlord  is  an  experienced  trapper  and  scout  named

Mavheran Haerlskeel, who keeps her people hidden to avoid

the  disastrous  orc-war  she  is  certain  must  come  soon.  The

gnomes  trap  beaver  and  other  fur  animals  throughout  the

Arn, and sometimes trade their excellent furs and woodwork

with folk in nearby Deadsnows or Citadel Adbar. The gnomes

are careful to conceal their tracks when they return to their

home after such an expedition.

The western Arn is wetter and more swampy than the eastern

part. It is plagued by several large bands of kobolds, and holds

several mysterious ruins rumored to date back to old Netheril.

The Cold Wood

Ettins,  orcs,  Uthgardt  barbarians,  and  red  tigers  roam  this

wood, as well as at least one bebilith from the Abyss; how it

came to be there is a mystery. If folk have heard of the Cold

Wood at all, they know it stands in the shadow of mountains

that  spawn  huge  orc  hordes.  As  a  result,  woodcutters  and

would-be homesteaders alike avoid it.

Beneath its thick stands, the ground rolls gently in hills

smoothed by glaciers long ago. In the valleys between, mixed

hardwoods grow; the heights are covered almost exclusively

with  pine  and  spruce.  Chill  and  damp  keep  wildfires  to  a

minimumlightning strikes cut smoking swaths as they do

everywhere, but seldom burn far or consume many trees in

the Cold Wood. Groundwater is plentiful.

The Uthgardt wont fell any living tree in this forest, and

they build few fires in the Cold Wood for fear of attracting

monsters. A few overgrown ruins can be found in the forest

depths. The Uthgardt avoid those tombs haunted by undead,

but the rest were long ago plundered by the barbarians. Uth-

gardt of the Red Tiger tribe consider the southern reaches of

the Cold Wood their territory, but plentiful game hunting in

the depths of the forest draws outcast Uthgardt. These out-

casts  are  frequently  young  warriors  who  have  turned  away

from the teachings of their shamans, hungry for the wealth

of  decadent  civilized  folk.  Not  so  long  ago,  being  outcast

would  have  meant  despair  and  certain  doom.  Increasingly,

young Uthgardt see it as being granted freedom, a chance to

taste the delights that lie so temptingly within reach in the

Silver Marches.

Uthgardt  outcasts  dwelling  in  the  Cold  Wood  typically

wander in hunting bands, sleeping in trees or simple camp-

sites surrounded by deadfall traps of their own making. They

make no trails or dwellings, and have been known to harass

intruders not of their race.

THRADULFS CAMP

In the southwestern stretch of the Cold Wood lies the camp

of Thradulf, chieftain of the Red Tiger tribe. Gathered to-

gether, the Red Tigers would number more than a thousand,

but they live scattered in about ten to twenty large bands,

moving  from  campsite  to  campsite  as  the  seasons  change.

Thradulfs camp is the largest gathering of his folk. His fol-

lowers hunt, fish, and forage in this area during the winter

months.  During  the  short  summer,  they  move  north  into

the high dells above the Druarwood.

Thradulf became leader of the Red Tiger tribe four years

ago, succeeding Adalwulf Longfang, a wise leader who ruled

long  and  well.  Adalwulf  intended  for  his  son  Shinoras  to

follow him, but Shinoras was killed while out hunting, and

Thradulfthe  chiefs  nephew,  and  a  powerful  voice  in  the

tribebecame  his  heir.  Thradulf  is  a  black-hearted,  cruel

man, and the Red Tiger tribesfolk fear his wrath. Some sus-

pect that he had something to do with the death of Shinoras,

but no one dares accuse him of murder.

THE COLD VALE

Although  its  not  properly  a  part  of  the  Cold  Wood,  this

region is so wild and desolate that it is every bit as inacces-

sible.  Between  the  southern  eaves  of  the  Cold  Woods  and

the northern slopes of the Rauvin Mountains lies an empy

land of broken hills, swift cold streams, and mossy gorges.

Old  dwarf-paths  that  once  led  from  Citadel  Felbarr  to

Citadel  Adbar  wind  among  the  boulders  and  thickets,  but

the  stout  folk  have  long  forgotten  these  wayscaravans

from  one  hold  to  the  other  take  the  roundabout  route  to

the south of the Rauvin Mountains.

This is troll country, and bands of the foul creatures often

lair in deep ravines and spray-filled gorges. The region is also

home to a particularly large, clever, and vicious behir called

Grimlight  (NE  behir,  18  HD)  who  has  a  taste  for  dwarf-

flesh as well as dwarf-gold.

TULRUNS TENT

The  abode  of  the  reclusive,  long-lived  mage  Tulrun  (CN

male  tiefling  Wiz13/Acm4)  moves  about  the  forest  as  he

wills. From the outside, it looks like a gaily hued silk tent, un-

ruffled  by  weather,  perched  atop  a  plain  wooden  platform

that stands more than 30 feet above the forest floor on five

long, thin, wooden legs.

Though it can walk, the tent more often flies at Tulruns

behest. The tent, its platform, and its legs are extremely re-

sistent  to  physical  attack,  and  protected  by  a  spell  turning

effect. (The whole structure has hardness 20; the legs have

40 hit points each, the platform 100 hit points, and the tent

walls 20 hit points each.) Tulrun usually responds to attack

by simply commanding the tent to leave the area, although

determined attackers provoke his wrath.

Creatures entering the tent become lost in an extradimen-

sional  maze  of  stairs,  rooms,  and  corridors  composed  of

warm, glowing white mist. While they wander, Tulrun em-

ploys  various  detection  magics  to  determine  the  intruders

true nature and intentions. Then hell confront the intruders

with dismissal and banishment spells to hurl them back to a

random  location  in  Faern,  retreat  and  allow  various  con-

structs and summoned monsters under his command to deal

with them, or come forward to welcome them as guests to

the extradimensional chambers he inhabits.

Tulrun owns many magic items, from staffs to minor ar-

tifacts, and great numbers of scrolls and potions, and he has

most of them hidden in distant locales that he can readily

reach by extradimensional means. He usually wears bracers

of armor +5, a ring of shooting stars and a ring of regeneration,

and carries a rod of alertness. Tulrun is a slender, short man

with  short  white  hair,  fine  features,  graceful  movements,

and a soft, husky voice. His fiendish nature is apparent in his

red, fine-scaled skin and talonlike hands.

Tulrun likes to be left alone to devise new spells (of which

he knows many), but on whim aids adventurers from time to

time. Hes an expert on creating constructs, including three

beautiful servants who seem to be living female humans, but

are  really  extremely  lifelike  constructs.  Caerel,  Elsara,  and

Tionele are equal to flesh golems in terms of their abilities

and powers, but have the following ability scores: Str 21, Dex

13, Con , Int 15, Wis 11, Cha 14. They also do not suffer

from  the  flesh  golems  tendency  to  go  berserk  in  combat.

Tulrun has devised a means to link all three of his creations

to himself as if they were familiars and gains all the familiar

benefits due a wizard of his level. Tulrun cares for these three

remarkable constructs so much that he would do anything to

spare them serious harm.

The Druarwood

North of the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, the land rises

sharply toward the Spine of the World. Rank upon rank of

steep,  forest-covered  ridges  climb  from  the  Surbrin  Valley

and the rolling terrain of the Moonlands toward the wall of

mountains, always visible to the north as a rampart of icy

spears. The Druarwood is the name given to this thin, dwin-

dling forest of pine, spruce, and fir. As the land climbs to the

mountains and one travels farther north, the forest quickly

gives  way  to  cold,  barren  scrubland  and  heath  beneath  the

towering glaciers and peaks.

Like the Coldwood below it, the Druarwood has a reputa-

tion  as  a  place  likely  to  be  harrowed  by  orcs,  giants,  and

worse. The reputation is well deserved. From their icy fast-

nesses in the mountain peaks, bands of frost giant and hill

giant hunters come to this place in search of game, timber,

and  forage.  Orc  marauders  frequently  scavenge  these

forested  hills,  too.  The  Druarwood  is  known  for  its  roth,

dire  bears,  and  dire  wolverinescreatures  so  vicious  that

even frost giants think twice before tangling with them.

The upper portions of the Druarwood are also home to a

few  small  bands  of  arctic  dwarves,  recent  migrants  from

the  Great  Glacier  who  crossed  the  polar  ice  cap  to  settle

new  lands.  They  jealously  defend  their  hunting  grounds

from their neighbors to the north. The arctic dwarves have

tamed  a  number  of  dire  wolverines,  and  they  use  these

fierce creatures to help them in their hunting. They avoid

the giants when possible, but never pass up an opportunity

to fall upon marauding orcs with a blizzards fury. Unimak

Giantskull is the foremost spokesman for his folk. He leads

a band dwelling in a deep, ice-rimed vale by a stream known

as the Frostrill.

The Moonlands

Guides and merchants in the Silver Marches might describe

the Moonlands as anything north of the Rauvin, east of the

Surbrin,  and  north  of  the  Nether  Mountains,  at  least  until

you  get  to  Old  Delzoun  or  the  Cold  Wood.  Youll  know  it

when youre there. While thats not very precise, its as good

a definition as any. At the southern edge of the area, along

the Rauvin River, the Moonlands are densely settled, but as

soon  as  one  travels  more  than  a  few  miles  away  from  the

riverholds, the lands quickly grow wild. Meadowlands broken

by rolling hills and thick copses in

sheltered  areas  make  up  most  of

this area.

Traders  and  merchants  from  the  cities  are  welcomed  in

the  town  of  Beorunnas  Well,  but  the  journey  here  can  be

dangerous.  Many  traders  come  here  under  the  escort  of

THE LONELY TOWER

This strange tower of white stone seems impossibly slender

and  delicate,  given  its  location  deep  in  the  wilderness.  The

landscape around the tower is distinctly odd. A perfectly cir-

cular  area  of  jumbled,  volcanic  rock  with  deep-cloven

crevices  surrounds  the  towers  foot,  standing  out  from  the

gentle, turf-covered hillsides around, as if the tower had been

raised somewhere else and then deposited here, along with all

the scenery within a thousand yards or so.

The wizard Ssessibil Istahvar (LE male half-fiend yuan-

ti  Wiz19)  makes  his  home  here.  He  is  not  native  to

Faern, and he spends much time away from the tower en-

gaged in business on far planes. During his most recent ab-

sence of almost thirty years, the wizard Arbane penetrated

10

The  Moonlands  are  Uthgardt

territory.  The  ancestor  mound  of

the  Black  Lion  and  Red  Tiger

tribes  stands  at  Beorunnas  Well,

in the northern reach of this area,

while  the  ancestor  mound  of  the

Sky Pony tribe lies at One Stone in

the  southern  part  of  the  Moon-

wood.  The  folk  of  Silverymoon

leave  this  land  to  their  barbarian

neighbors, and few farms or hold-

ings  lie  more  than  a  few  miles

north  of  Alustriels  city.  Of  late

there has been trouble in this area,

as  Sky  Pony  Uthgardt  (see

Wolmads  Camp,  under  Old  Del-

zoun)  have  raided  several  dwarf

caravans  heading  south  through

the  Moonlands  from  Citadel  Fel-

barr  to  Silverymoon.  Never  ones

to  back  down  from  a  fight,  the

hot-headed dwarves of Felbarr are

muttering  about  driving  the  Sky

Pony  barbarians  away  from  the

areastrife  that  would  likely

cause both parties many dead and

much grief.

A Black Lion smith at work

About  halfway  between  Silverymoon  and  Rivermoot

stands the town of High Hold, so named because it perches

securely on a tall promontory opposite the Evermoors. The

Holdmaster and his folk are subjects of Silverymoon.

BEORUNNAS WELL

This  deep,  sunken  dell  holds  the  ancestor  mound  sacred  to

the Black Lion and Red Tiger Uthgardt. Under their chief,

Andar Heartwood, the Black Lions have given up their no-

madic  ways  and  settled  down  in  a  rough  stockade  town

nearby, trading timber, furs, and smoked meats (all gathered

from  the  nearby  Cold  Wood  and  the  lands  about)  to  the

larger  cities  of  the  Silver  Marches  for  civilized  goods.  The

Red Tigers dont think much of their kin for choosing to ape

the ways of the soft southlanders, and more than once quar-

rels between warriors of the two tribes have turned deadly as

Black  Lion  tribesfolk  respond  to  the  barbs  and  insults  of

their kin.

the  defenses  of  the  Lonely  Tower,  plundered  Ssessibils

hidden lore, and made himself master of the placeuntil a

band  of  adventurers  drove  out  Arbane,  clearing  the  way

for Ssessibils return.

Ssessibil  defends  his  privacy  with  terrible  elemental

guardians and many deadly spells, but he harbors few designs

on  the  Silver  Marches  (or  any  other  part  of  Faern).  The

Lonely Tower is for him a refuge and hidden citadel, a place

where enemies and rivals from his home plane cannot locate

or attack him.

The Moonwood

A large, dense forest dominated by evergreens, shadowtops,

and duskwoods, the Moonwood is home to few natural pred-

ators  and  no  orcs  or  goblinoids.  Its  southern  fringes  are

peaceful  enough,  home  to  small  bands  of  moon  elves  and

wood elves who roam its green depths and fair meadows, as

well as the rustic homes of a few woodcutters and trappers.

The  northern  depths  are  a  different  matterthere,  the

woods become darker, thicker, and more overgrown, and the

People of the Black Blood hunt.

CLAW HOLLOW

A  wild  dell  filled  with  brambles  and  brooding  trees  in  the

northern reach of the Moonwood, Claw Hollow is home to

one of the largest and most dangerous bands of People of the

Black Blood in the North. Some seventy strong, these Malar-

worshipers attack all who invade their territory. They also try

to  kidnap  humans  or  other  civilized  humanoids  in  order  to

hunt them to the death in High Hunts at least once a month.

While they prefer folk of the Silver Marches, captured Uth-

gardt or would-be adventurers provide good sport too.

The  Moonwood  Black  Bloods  are  led  by  Bloodmaster

Jarthon (NE male werebadger Rgr5). They hunt in a pack,

posting sentinels and roving scouts in the verges of the wood.

Jarthon  was  once  a  half-elf  of  Silverymoon  who  hunted

Black Blood lyncathropes in this forest to protect folk of the

city. Infected with lycanthropy after a werebadger attack, he

used  his  hunting  skills  to  become  the  leader  of  the  Black

Bloods. He dreams of ruining Silverymoon and overwhelm-

ing the Silver Marches with wild hunters.

This  tribe  marks  its  territory  with  splashes  of  blood

wine, captured wine boiled with the blood of kills of the

People. The blood wine anoints trees, stumps, and rocks be-

neath the tribes symbol: a stick figure of a humanoid with

a  large  claw  where  its  head  should  be.  The  Black  Bloods

consider all of the Moonwood to be their exclusive terri-

tory, and they will slay any human or humanoid entering

it. Though the Moonwood borders both the town of Quaer-

varr and the dell that holds the mysterious Heralds Hold-

fast, the Black Bloods dont dare to assault either of those

placesyet. They content themselves with capturing and

hunting  woodsfolk  or  travelers  in  the  vicinity  of  Quaer-

varr, seeking to stealthily depopulate the town as much as

possible before open conflict flares.

The adventure Black Fury, in Chapter 8 of this book, de-

scribes Claw Hollow and its inhabitants in more detail.

THE HERALDS HOLDFAST

The magically warded subterranean stronghold of the High

Herald  called  Old  Night  (Shalara  Swordshigh,  CG  female

human  Brd6/Rgr4),  the  Holdfast  is  a  secret  storehouse  of

learning and lore in the wilds of the North. The hold is con-

cealed beneath a squat, overgrown tower that can be magi-

cally  shielded  from  view  with  a  special,  persistent

hallucinatory terrain effect.

Beyond the tower is a succession of underground cham-

bers that preserve old banners, trophies, and writings in all

forms, many of them individually protected by many-lay-

ered magics. Chambers devoted to all the major races lead

back to a magnificent library sporting three balcony levels

and  comfortable  reading  tables.  It  holds  the  greatest  col-

lection of heraldry, genealogy, and tomes of record outside

Candlekeep.  Only  the  High  Heralds  are  familiar  with  all

the  defenses  of  the  Holdfast,  but  they  are  known  to  in-

clude  mold,  effects  that  inhibit  open  flame,  and  helmed

horrors  under  orders  to  attack  any  intruders  except  for

those who can provide certain passwords.

Many books and tables in the Holdfast are actually quies-

cent constructs, obedient to Old Nights commands. In addi-

tion,  some  books  hidden  among  the  shelves  contain  potent

magic  traps  such  as  glyphs  of  warding  and  symbols.  Old

Night customarily wears bracers of armor +4 and carries a

rusty iron sphere (iron bands of Bilarro) at her belt.

THE MOUTH OF SONG

A  days  march  north  of  Quaervarr  stands  a  treeless  hill  in

the middle of the forest. This place is home to a small temple

of Eilistraee. Worshipers of the Dark Maiden who hail from

Silverymoon  often  gather  here  to  dance  atop  the  hill  on

moonless  nights.  No  one  watches  over  the  site  when  Eilis-

traees followers arent present, but various magical defenses

and wards protect the temple from evil intruders.

ONE STONE

Once,  three  Uthgardt  tribes  worshiped  at  this  ancestor

moundthe Sky Pony, Golden Eagle, and Red Pony tribes.

Now only the Sky Pony people remain. One Stone is a single

massive  boulder  12  feet  high,  engraved  with  faint  tracery

whose meaning is lost with the dead tribes. A ring of stone

cairns surrounds the site at a distance of a hundred yards.

In the last few months, the lycanthropes of Claw Hollow

have taken to ambushing Sky Pony tribesfolk coming to One

Stone to pay their respects to their forebears. The Sky Pony

barbarians therefore attack strangers in this vicinity on sight.

Nether Mountains

A  range  of  dark,  brooding  peaks  that  once  marked  the

boundary  between  the  ancient  lands  of  Netheril  and  Del-

zoun,  the  Nether  Mountains  have  been  known  for  a  long

time  as  good  landmarks  to  stay  away  from.  Orcs  of  the

Thousand Fists tribe dwell on its southern slopes, and orcs

of the Ripped Gut tribe lair in caverns on the northern face

of the range. Until recently the two clans fought viciously

and continuously for control of Moon Pass; now the Ripped

Gut orcs have forged an uneasy truce with their rivals under

11

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 12

The Lay of the Land

the influence of a tanarukk emissary from some dark power

in the Hellgate Keep region.

The Morueme clan of blue dragons lairs high in the east-

ernmost  Nether  Peaks.  These  dragons  fly  forth  often  to

scour  the  mountainsides  and  surrounding  countryside  of

their favored foodorcs and ogres. When they are hungry

enough,  anything  is  fair  game;  during  one  long-ago  harsh

winter, a Morueme swooped low over Everlund and carried

off both livestock and the shouting, fleeing owners of those

hapless beasts, soaring off into the night. Due to the dragons

predations, both orc tribes have been reduced to a few hun-

dred tuskers each.

The mountains west of Moon Pass offer granite to those

daring  enough  to  quarry  it,  but  no  large  or  easily  reached

veins of ore. Gold, copper, and silver are abundant only far to

the east, along the north face of the range, where the town

of Deadsnows lies huddled in a mountain vale.

Legends  of  riches  such  as  caches  of  Netherese  magic  of

great power have always clung to the Nether Mountains, but

few folk have dared to go looking for such lures. One reason

for the reluctance of explorers and adventurers to search the

peaks of the range is the amazing abundance of monsters in

the  Nether  Mountains.  Perhaps  hidden  portals  link  the

mountains to other regions haunted by monsters, or maybe

deepspawn  lair  in  unexplored  mountain  caverns,  but  what-

ever the reason, monsters of many sorts seem to boil forth

daily on the high slopes of the Nether Peaks.

BARASKUR

Named for a great orc hero of the tribes past, this moun-

tainside stronghold of caves strung along a winding cliffside

road is the main settlement of the Ripped Gut orcs. Its lo-

cated  on  the  south  side  of  Orcsblood  Peak,  between  Dead-

snows and Sundabar. Raiding parties from Baraskur plague

Moon Pass to the west, Turnstone Pass to the south, and the

Fork Road to the north.

A  very  unusual  guardian  watches  over  the  Ripped  Gut

orcs.  Centuries  ago,  an  outcast  human  sorcerer  named  Au-

mathra  sought  refuge  with  the  tribe.  Aumathra  died  cen-

turies ago, but her spirit occasionally becomes restless. The

Ripped Gut orcs have found that they can placate Aumathra

(CE female human ghost Sor14) by providing a tall, slender

human woman with dark hair and skill at magicsomeone

resembling Aumathras own long-dead bodyfor the ghost

to possess. When the ghost grows restless, the orcs search for

a woman of the right appearance and go to great lengths to

capture her alive, in order to bring her before Aumathras

ghost in a dark ceremony.

Aumathra may possess her unfortunate victim for a few

days  before  abandoning  her  amusements  and  lying  quiet

again, or she may hold her host for months. The orcs refer to

the  host  as  the  Mouth  of  Aumauthra,  and  they  carefully

guard her during those times when the ghost is unable or un-

willing  to  assert  control.  During  the  time  when  Aumathra

possesses  a  body,  she  spends  much  time  ransacking  nearby

ruins  and  tombs,  searching  for  something  she  cannot  find

when she doesnt have a body, while commanding the Ripped

Gut orcs as if they were her abject slaves.

DALAGARS DAGGER

The  highest  peak  in  the  northeast  range  of  the  Nether

Mountains is topped by a sharp, daggerlike pinnacle. Over a

thousand years ago, the dwarf Dalagar lost his life climbing

the treacherous, crumbling lower cliffs of the peak, which

fall away in sheets when subjected to too much weight. The

mountain  is  still  considered  too  dangerous  to  climb.  For

still-mysterious  reasons,  many  aged  blue,  green,  and  black

dragons  come  here  to  die,  plunging  from  the  skies  to

impale  themselves  on  the  Dagger.  Their  bones  litter  the

shoulders  of  the  high  peak  below  the  pinnacle,  and  scat-

tered among these remains are the coins, gems, and jewelry

they coated their scales with in life.

This  treasure  remains  largely  undisturbed  because  the

Morueme dragons (who wont touch a ring or coin of it) fu-

riously defend the peak against aerial approach. They seem

to have some way of knowing when any creature draws close

to the Dagger. The Moruemes have twice torn apart wyrm-

lings who came not to die but to plunder. One of those drag-

ons  turned  out  to  be  a  human  mage  employing

shapechanging magicthe Morueme dragons took the trou-

ble to learn where he had dwelt, and publicly returned his re-

mains there as a warning to other ambitious wizards.

LADYPEAK

This small, nondescript peak at the westernmost end of the

Nether  range  holds  a  little-known  monastery  dedicated  to

Loviatar.  Until  recently,  some  ninety  human  and  half-elf

clergy called the fortified temple (and the caverns beneath

the abbey) home. They defended themselves against orc and

other  monster  attacks  by  means  of  lost  Netherese  magic

that  was  otherwise  kept  hidden.  The  monks  of  the  Ladys

Hand Monastery earned a dark name in the lands nearby, as

travelers along the nearby roads sometimes disappeared in

the vicinity.

The tower of the Ladys Hand was recently torn apart by

a  hungry  Morueme  dragon,  which  the  monks  then  blasted

12

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 13

The Lay of the Land

apart  in  midair  with  Netherese  weapons.  Other  Morueme

dragons then raked the monastery in rage. They opened sev-

eral caverns and ruined most of the monastery buildings but

failed to obliberate the monks, who retreated to the deepest

caves. The Moruemes then sent a small army of hobgoblins

to assault the monastery and root out the surviving monks,

but again the magic of the Loviatar worshipers prevailed.

High  Whipmistress  Lorthalae  Shamrass  (LE  female

human Clr12) now guides a clergy just over forty strong as

they seek to rebuild their fortress home. Winter may force

them to abandon their dark tower altogether.

MOON PASS

The  Nether  Mountains  are  split  into  eastern  and  western

ranges by this ancient gorge. River travel through the pass is

possible (as described in the River Rauvin entry later in this

chapter),  but  footpaths  clinging  to  the  shoulders  of  the

Rauvin  gorge  permit  travelers  on  foot  to  cross  the  moun-

tains here, too.

Despite  the  fact  that  the  Nether  Mountains  tower  on

either side, Moon Pass is an entirely different world. Melt-

water seeps into the mountains and freezes in winter, only to

thaw and drain away again, over the years opening many tall,

narrow caverns in the mountains on either side of the Pass.

Each  of  these  cleaverock  caverns  is  a  vertical  labyrinth,

some  thousands  of  feet  from  top  to  bottom,  but  isolated

from  its  neighbors  to  either  side.  The  caves  are  damp,  and

fungi of all sortsluminescent, edible, dangerous, and mind-

lessly  ambulatoryare  plentiful.  Links  to  the  Underdark

are  also  plentiful,  connections  to  the  surface  only  slightly

less so.

The result is a no-mans-land entered warily by humans,

orcs, dwarves, gnomes, duergar, Underdark monsters such as

driders,  and  even  drow.  Aballins  and  yuan-ti  have  recently

been encountered, and at least one group of illithids resides

in the vicinity. Ambushes are frequent, devourings common-

place, and fallen gear and goods lie everywheremany used

as lures by later predators. More than one party of adven-

turers  has  observed  that  something  seems  to  be  attracting

many Underdark creatures to the area.

The  town  of  Jalanthar  (see  Rauvin  Vale)  sits  near  the

southern  end  of  Moon  Pass.  The  village  of  Rauvincross

stands at the northern entrance of the pass, home to many

of the drivers and mule teams that work the towpaths of the

Moon Pass Gorge.

MORUEMES CAVE

The  mountain  known  as  Dragondoom  looks  out  over  the

cold northern reaches of Anauroch from the trackless east-

ern  reaches  of  the  Nether  Mountains.  Beneath  this  peak,

thousands of years of meltwater have eaten away at a thick

layer of soft limestone until little is left of it but a forest of

fanglike stalactites and stalagmites, with huge gaps between

them.  For  as  long  as  anyone  can  remember,  these  linked

caves  have  been  the  home  of  the  Blood  of  Morueme,  a

family of blue dragons descended from a common ancestor.

Morueme females are driven forth from the clan or slain

when they reach mating age; there are seldom more than

six dragons sharing the caverns at any time. Each dragon

maintains its own hoard and sleeping-cavern, building its own

staff of loyal (or cowed) hobgoblin servants. Five dragons in-

habit  the  caverns  just  now,  and  the  cumulative  treasure

they have inherited or won for themselves is staggering in

total amount (probably hundreds of thousands of coins per

wyrm, to say nothing of the heaps of gems they hold dear).

For  many  years,  the  Moruemes  were  ruled  by  Kizil-

pazar,  the  ancient  blue  patriarch  of  the  clan.  His  strong

and  ambitious  sons  Nahaunglaroth  and  Roraurim  turned

on their sire last year and destroyed him. They then drove

out  Kizilpazars  younger  mate  Idrizraele,  who  perished  in

her rash assault against the Monastery of the Ladys Hand.

Surprised  by  Idrizraeles  death,  the  two  brothers  reacted

swiftly to punish the monastery in order to make sure that

no one else would dare lift a hand against a blue dragon in

the Nether Mountains.

Nahaunglaroth and Roraurim are both male mature adult

blue  dragons  and  5th-level  sorcerers.  (Their  sorcerer  levels

increase their caster level from 7th, the normal for a mature

adult blue dragon, to 12th.) Eshaedra, an adult female from

the Nelanther, is the mate of Nahaunglaroth. They are child-

less,  but  Roraurim  and  Faenphaele  (a  mature  adult  female

whom  Roraurim  found  lairing  north  of  Turmish)  have  a

male  wyrmling,  whom  theyve  named  Arharzel  after  a

grandsire  of  fearsome  reputation.  Soon  it  will  be  time  for

him to hunt alone.

The  Morueme  dragons  have  learned  to  largely  avoid

humans. They hate orcs and ogres (except as meals), and they

devote their lives to increasing their mastery of magic. They

study  Aragrakh,  Chondathan,  Common,  Illuskan,  and

Netheresethe  latter  to  better  serve  them  in  their  use  of

the  many  powerful  ancient  spellbooks  that  are  their  most

valued (and best hidden) items of treasure. Though they need

not  study  to  memorize  spells,  perusing  the  tomes  inspires

and guides them in crafting new magics.

The  high  slope  of  Dragondoom  Mountain  holds  the

mouthlike  main  entrance  to  the  Morueme  lair.  The  rock

ridges below sport the rough turrets of Doomspire, a hobgob-

lin castle built into the side of the mountain and linked by

lesser caves to the Morueme lair. Here for the last few cen-

turies have dwelt hobgoblins of the Red Flayer tribe, serving

the Morueme dragons as fawning near-slaves. The Red Flay-

ers  suffered  heavy  battle  losses  in  the  attack  on  the  Lady-

peak,  and  now  number  some  six  hundred,  under  the

leadership of their chieftain Haurstagh.

Traditionally  mercenaries  for  hire,  the  Red  Flayers  de-

fend their castle with catapults and ballistae. Younger mem-

bers  of  the  tribe  chafe  under  Morueme  servitude,  and  will

soon either revolt or depart en masse, to seek their fortunes

as mercenaries in the wider world. These restless two hundred

or so lack a leader thus farbut when one arises, Haurstagh

knows a schism will follow soon behind.

In the meantime, each Morueme dragon except Arharzel

has forty to sixty personal Red Flayer servants, and can call

on many more to fight for it if its lair is invaded and it raises

an  alarm.  The  dragons  shared  caverns  sport  many  traps

arranged with a specific breed of intruder in mind: humans.

(Most are rockfalls, in which rocks joined in a webwork of

chains can be dropped from the cavern ceiling by a quick pull

13

on a nearby chain.) The cavern complex also sports several

sharp  bends  where  defending  Moruemes  can  readily  attack

intruding dragons.

SILVERYMOON

PASS

The  western  por-

tion  of  the  Nether

Mountains is divided

into  two  distinct

ranges,  both  running

more  or  less

eastwest  direction.  Be-

tween  these  two  ranges  lies  Silverymoon

Pass,  a  high,  rock-strewn  valley  of  jagged  cliffs

and  dark  bramble-thickets.  Snow  patches  linger

throughout  the  year  on  the  southern  side  of  the

pass,  protected  from  the  sun  by  the  shadow  of  the

mountains, and countless rills of icy water spill down from

the peaks above.

Through  this  forbidding  vale  climbs  a  road  linking  Sil-

verymoon  to  Sundabar.  The  road  is  often  closed  by  the

threat of avalanche in wintertime, but its generally clear

the rest of the year. Patrols from Silverymoon and Sunda-

bar regularly ride the length of the road to drive back mon-

sters and bandits intent on preying upon the roads traffic.

A small watchtower called Hawks Nest sits near the top of

the  pass,  manned  by  a  detachment  of  a  dozen  Knights  in

Silver  from  Silverymoon  during  those  months  that  the

pass is in heavy use. Many travelers press hard through the

high reaches of the pass in order to spend the night in the

shelter of the tower.

The  tiny  village  of

Khelb  sits  near  the

western  end  of  the

pass.

THE

THOUSAND

MAWS

These  widely  dis-

persed  caves  are  the

homes  of  the  Thou-

sand  Fists  orcs.

There  are  about  one

hundred  caverns  in

all.  Some  of  the

largest  caves,  such  as

Arraggar

(where

sixty-odd  orcs  dwell)

and  Oltho  (home  to

some

seventy

tuskers) are linked by

crudely  hewn  back-

tunnels.  Most  are

isolated  from  each

other,  spread  over

a  dozen  peaks  and

many miles of travel on

narrow,  winding  moun-

tain trails. The tribe posts

sentinels  with  warning

horns  overlooking  many

of  the  trails,  to  warn  of

any intrusion or of the ap-

proach  of  possible  prey.

Some of the caves are given

over  to  growing  mushrooms,

or  to  prison-pens  for  hapless

thralls  forced  to  labor  until

theyre  good  for  nothing  more

than  the  Thousand  Fists  cookfires.

Since  the  Morueme  dragons  began  scouring  the

high meadows, the Thousand Fists no longer graze or

try to breed captured livestock. Food is growing scarce as

the strength of the tribe swells againsoon it will be time

for the Fists to go to war once more, just to fill their bellies.

TELKOUNS TOWER

This  stronghold  of  a  little-known  wizard  stands  in  a  high,

peak-locked mountain valley infested with perytons. Two of

the peaks that ring the valley are Mount Thorog and Mount

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 15

The Lay of the Land

Ieldroun, the two tallest (but distant) mountains as one looks

east from the Moon Pass. These peaks are named for long-

ago orc chieftains; they stand about halfway between Stone

Stand and the site of Hellgate Keep. Telkoun keeps to him-

self,  but  perytons  from  High  Thorog  have  been  known  to

snatch both humans and beasts they would normally avoid,

carrying such prey back to the valley.

TOMBS OF DECKON THAR

The  Chieftains  in  Gold  were  a  group  of  notorious  bandits

who  dominated  the  western  Nether  Mountains  long  ago,

preying on caravan traffic between Silverymoon and Sund-

abar. For generations they grew rich, hoarding their gains in

a great keep and burying their lords in sinister barrows filled

with  riches.  The  seven  Tombs  of  Deckon  Thar,  named  for

the  first  bandit  chieftain  to  be  interred  there,  remain  un-

plundered on the western slope of a hidden canyon north of

Silverymoon  Pass.  Unfortunately,  those  buried  within  the

tombs have risen as wights under the cold rule of Vinjarak

the Mound King (LE wight, 8 HD).

TURNSTONE PASS

Unlike Moon Pass or Silverymoon Pass, both of which see

considerable  traffic,  Turnstone  Pass  is  little  more  than

wilderness  now.  Five  hundred  years  past,  a  road  wound

from Sundabar to Ascalhorn, in the days when that citadel

was a strong and vital city of elves and humans, but when

Ascalhorn fell and became Hellgate Keep, traffic through

Turnstone  Pass  virtually  ceased.  Nothing  but  wilderlands

and the crumbling ruins of forgotten lands lie south of the

Nether  Mountains  now.  The  region  has  a  bad  reputation,

and even after the destruction of Hellgate Keep it is whis-

pered that the daemonfey (feyri and half-fiends of House

Dlardrageth) haunt these lands.

The Night Trees

Between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood lie two small

forests,  together  known  as  the  Night  Trees.  Dark  and

silent,  these  woodlands  are  avoided  by  dwarf,  elf,  human,

and  orc  alike,  for  an  old  and  hostile  power  broods  in  the

gloom beneath the trees. Many plant monsters of terrible

ferocity  roam  the  woods,  including  assassin  vines,  dark

trees, shambling mounds, and tendriculoses. Some of these

are things normally found in the fetid jungles of the south,

but they seem strangely acclimated to the rigors of north-

ern lands.

The  Night  Trees  are  guarded  by  a  sinister  druid  known

only  as  the  Tree  Slaker  (NE  male  earth  genasi  Drd13  of

Grumbar),  who  often  sets  insidious  snares  for  intruders  in

the forest. When he catches someone, the Tree Slaker binds

the hapless victim to a nearby tree (often with a wood shape

or control plants spell) and opens the victims veins to satisfy

the dark, thirsty spirit of the forest. Over the years the Tree

Slaker  has  gathered  a  handful  of  acolytesevil  druids  and

rangers  eager  to  feed  the  blood  of  humanoid  creatures  to

their master.

In  the  northern  portion  of  the  forest,  a  strange  square

tower  overgrown  with  vines  stands  near  the  center  of  the

woods. Its rumored to be an old temple to Chauntea that was

poisoned by the evil taint in the Night Trees. Adventurers

trying  to  reach  the  tower  have  found  that  the  plant  mon-

sters of the Night Trees, and the Tree Slaker himself, guard

the site vigilantly.

Old Delzoun

Two great valleys make up the region known as Old Del-

zoun,  one  on  either  side  of  the  Rauvin  Mountains.  The

southern  valley  is  known  locally  as  Sundabar  Vale,  while

the northerly one is referred to as Adbar Run. In the east

these two vales meet between the Rauvin Mountains and

Anauroch in the area of the Fork. To the west, they meet

again in the Moonlands.

Sundabar Vale is home to a number of small holds and

settlements  in  the  vicinity  of  Sundabar,  one  of  the  great

cities of the Marches. The lands close about the city are one

of the more densely populated regions of the Silver March-

es, protected by the ramparts of the Fortress City. The set-

tlements quickly thin out along the Fork Road. Deadsnows

(described in Chapter 3) is the last settlement in this area,

standing a dozen miles or more away from any other settle-

ment of note.

Adbar  Run  is  true  wilderness.  No  permanent  settle-

ments lie between the Cold Vale and the Fork, unless orc

outposts  and  goblin  warrens  in  the  nearby  mountains

count. The Red Tiger and Sky Pony tribes of the Uthgardt

roam  this  area  at  infrequent  intervals,  but  only  in  small

and wary bands.

AUVANDELL

On  the  western  edge  of  Sundabar  Vale,  near  the  place

where the road through Silverymoon Pass descends out of

the  Nether  Mountains,  stands  an  old  dwarf  watchtower

from the days of Delzoun. A small town clusters about the

towers  gray  plinth,  a  stopping-place  for  people  traveling

between  Sundabar  and  Silverymoon.  This  is  Auvandell,

named  for  the  human  hero  Auvan  Arlandspyr,  who  was

said to have slain a dragon here in the service of the king of

Delzoun.  The  dwarf  tower  was  raised  over  the  wyrms

hoardor so its said.

Auvandell is like any of half a dozen other villages or set-

tlements scattered about this area, although its a large and

well-defended  one.  A  handful  of  towns  like  this  dot  the

Rauvin Vale and the southern portions of Old Delzoun, in-

cluding  Lhuvenhead,  High  Hold,  Rauvincross,  and  River-

moot. Auvandell is nominally part of the lands of Sundabar,

but in practice the town is left to govern itself.

The land in the vicinity of Auvandell is rugged and diffi-

cult to farm. Goatherds and shepherds make up most of the

towns agricultural base, and apple and cherry orchards do

well on the south-facing hillsides near the town. Two small

mines in the hills nearby account for most of Auvandells

industry; a smelter here turns out ingots of copper, lead, and

iron, which are sent down to Sundabar in sturdy carts pulled

by teams of oxen.

Auvandell is ruled by a High Sheriff, the former adven-

turer  Jortheyn  Serpentbane.  Helm  Dwarf-friend,  the  ruler

15

THE FORK

This lonely and wild spot seems like the end of Faern. Here

the Fork Road splits into the Adbar Road, which heads north

toward the dwarfholds of the Ice Mountains, and a nameless

track  heading  east  toward  the  ruins  of  Ascore.  Few  travel

that  way  anymore,  although  the  gnomes  of  Graevelwood

sometimes use the road.

Ghaurins  Hold:  Not  far  from  the  Fork  lies  a  ruin  of

moss-covered stone, once the keep of the ancient dwarf hero

Ghaurin.  Its  cellars  are  reputed  to  hold  Ghaurins  gold,  as

well as the restless spirit of the old dwarf himself.

The Wildlands Rest: While the Fork is not much of an in-

tersection these days, it is a landmark and frequent stopping

place  for  traffic  bound  to  or  from  Citadel  Adbar.  Last  year

two  old  adventurersIrvag  the  Bear  (CG  male  human

Rog2/Ftr4)  and  his  partner  Grumbelham  Goldhand  (N  male

gold dwarf Ftr5)set out to build a wayside inn at the Fork.

Marauding orcs have discovered more than once that the two

of them still know how to use their blades. Irvag and Grum-

belham have raised a stone-walled building that is more of a

blockhouse than an inn, but its a sound and safe place to rest

the  night.  The  two  entrepreneurs  are  constantly  expanding

their building and improving its furnishings.

SUNDABAR VALE

The  southerly  portion  of  Old  Delzoun  is  sometimes  called

Sundabar  Vale.  The  walled  city  of  Sundabar  sits  near  the

center of a bowl formed by a ring of mountains almost sixty

miles in diameter. Through this vale flows the River Rauvin,

spilling down from the Rauvin Mountains to the north of

the city and vanishing into the Rauvin Gorge in Moon Pass,

some twenty miles south of Sundabar.

Few farms or settlements lie west of the Rauvin, because

Citadel Felbarr was for many years in the hands of a power-

ful orc-host ruled by King Obould. His marauders plundered

almost everything between his keep and the walls of Sunda-

bar. With the overthrow of Obould and the renewal of dwarf

rule  at  Felbarr,  many  folk  are  now  resettling  this  area.

Squabbles over land rights in this fertile region occupy much

of Helm Dwarf-friends attention.

Sundabar  is  described  in  more  detail  in  Chapter  3  of

this book.

WOLMADS CAMP

On  the  northern  flanks  of  the  Nether  Mountains,  not  far

from  Citadel  Felbarr,  a  band  of  Sky  Pony  Uthgardt  has

taken up temporary residence. Under the guidance of a reck-

less but charismatic war-leader named Wolmad, these Uth-

gardt have turned to banditry under the guise of ruling the

land in the civilized manner. Wolmad harbors a longstand-

ing  grudge  against  dwarves  of  all  types,  and  he  singles  out

caravans from Felbarr for his special attentiona situation

the dwarves will not tolerate for much longer.

Wolmad  calls  himself  the  Lord  of  the  Vale,  and  he

maintains that the endless campaign he has fought against

the orcs of the Nether and Rauvin Mountains entitles him

to demand tolls and tribute from any passing through his

lands.  In  better  times  Wolmad  might  be  reined  in  by  a

strong  Sky  Pony  chief,  but  the  current  leader  of  the  Sky

Pony Uthgardt lies dying in a camp hundreds of miles to

the west, and Wolmad has no patience for the ties of tradi-

tion in any event.

Rauvin Mountains

This purple-hued mountain range dominates Old Delzoun, its

peaks rising seven to eight thousand feet above the surround-

ing vales. It is riddled with orcs. Tuskers have always infested

the caverns that honeycomb these peaks, boiling forth every

few  decades  to  raid  the  lands  around.  When  they  join  orcs

emerging from holds hidden in even more northerly peaks,

the dread orc hordes that scourge the North are born.

Three orc tribes lair in the heart of the Rauvin peaks.

The western end of the range is home to the Red Fangs,

the  center  is  held  by  the  Tornskulls,  and  in  the  eastern

16

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 17

The Lay of the Land

peaks  lair  the  Heart  Takersnames  rooted  in  favored

tribal  rituals  to  Gruumsh  (one  tribe  devours  bound  cap-

tives alive on the altars of their gods, another tears off the

heads of its captives, and the third cuts out, cooks, and eats

the  hearts  of  prey  dedicated  to  the  Savage  God).  In  the

wild  foothills  and  gorges  of  the  southern  slopes,  three

goblin kingdoms feud and squabble with each other as well

as their orc neighbors.

The  Tornskulls,  caught  between  two  rivals,  have  always

followed a shrewd policy of strike first, and strike hard. As a

result, they now outnumber their neighboring tribes two to

one (the Red Fangs can muster an es-

timated  1,200  fighting  orcs,

the  Heart  Takers  about

2,150,  and  the  Tornskulls

close to 4,900). Moreover, the

Red  Fangs  and  the  Heart

Takers fear the Tornskulls more

than any other mortal foe. Over

four hundred Red Fangs recently

chose to set forth west and south

in  the  hope  of  finding  another

home  close  to  rich,  weakly  de-

fended  landsbut  theyve  not

been  heard  from  since.  The  Red

Fangs elders suspect the wanderers

soon broke up into small, quarrel-

ing bands that came to a variety of

bad ends.

Its  increasingly  apparent  that

the  Rauvin  Mountains  simply

cant  feed  all  the  humanoids

dwelling in them. Soon starvation,

cannibalism,  and  war  will  come  to

the  Rauvinheart  caverns,  unless

other sources of food are found.

DEAD ORC PASS

Named by a human who saw the after-

math  of  a  great  battle  between  the

Heart  Takers  and  the  Tornskulls,  Dead

Orc Pass has seen many such battles, and has

been  featured  in  human  and  elf  ballads  aplenty.

Fierce storms often break over the Rauvin peaks,

raking  them  with  lightning  and  stinging,  freezing  rain

that  coats  everything  with  thick,  slick  ice.  Such  weather

makes surface-dwelling game, plants, and monsters scarce,

which means that the resident orcs are often hungry.

Honeycombing the mountain roots on either side of Rain-

bow Gorge, the Rauvinheart caverns stretch for many dark

and  secret  miles  from  Dead  Orc  Pass.  The  orc  tribes  feud

over the choicest caverns of this immense cave system, and

they hunt its depths for beasts coming up out of the Under-

dark  and  edible  fungi  .  .  .  but  theres  never  enough  to  go

around.

Rainbow  Gorge: Most  folk  believe  the  River  Rauvin

begins in Rainbow Gorge, between the central Rauvin peaks

of  Mount  Gaeram  and  Faerangs  Doom,  but  the  Rauvin

orcs know better. The river begins in the chill moors and

gorges  of  the  Cold  Vale,  north  of  the  range,  and  drains

south  under  the  mountains.  There  it  touches  some  deep

source  of  heat,  and  boils  up  inside  the  mountains  in  hun-

dreds of scalding geysers buried in deep clefts and trackless

caves.  The  water  warms  the  Rauvinheart  caverns  even  in

the  harshest  winters  and  eventually  emerges  in  the  Rain-

bow Gorge.

Old maps show the gorge cleaving through the mountain

range, but those who follow the Rauvin into the mountains

find this isnt so. An ancient, crumbling trail climbs the east

side  of  the  gorge,  then  turns  east  along  one  shoulder  of

Faerangs  Doom  at  the  gorge-head  to  reach  a  narrow  cleft

between Mount Jaws and Mount

Tolzrin  (where  the  human

prospector  Tolzrin  once  dis-

covered gold nuggets as large

as his head).

That  cleft  is  the  infamous

Dead Orc Pass. It offers a clear

trail down the north side of the

Rauvin rangeclear, that is, if a

traveler  can  win  through  the

Tornskull orcs dwelling in it.

Below the pass, the Rauvin rises

as  a  collection  of  waterfalls  arcing

out  of  high  cliff-faces.  The  river

plunges down chutes and whirlwater

basins on the sides of Mount Gaeram

and  the  knife-sharp  peak  known  as

Faerangs Doom (after the orc king

who  leaped  to  his  death  from  its

summit centuries ago, when trapped

by  rival  orc  tribes)  before  leaving

the Rauvin Mountains. The gorge is

named for its ever-present rainbow;

a mist thrown up by the river spray

hangs ceaselessly above the roaring

waters.

The  Tornskull  Orcs:  For  some

time,  the  Tornskulls  have  been

eyeing  Citadel  Felbarr  and  Sund-

abar, and wondering how to goad the

Red  Fangs  into  attacking  one  and  the  Heart

Takers into striking at the other. The Tornskulls

have  no  intention  of  weakening  their  own  ranks  when

other  tribes  can  be  duped  into  spending  their  strength

against the formidable might of the great bastions of the

North. But the Tornskull leaders reckon that hurling their

neighbors  against  the  Silver  Marches  must  turn  to  their

advantage.  Either  the  rival  tribe  will  be  broken  on  the

walls  of  Felbarr  or  Sundabarin  which  case  the  Torn-

skulls  can  swoop  in  to  conquer  the  survivorsor  theyll

overwhelm a major citadel and stumble into unimaginable

loot, in which case the Tornskulls can march to wrest away

the prize from their weakened rivals.

The great flaw in the plan, of course, is the obvious ques-

tion: How to force the fearful Red Fangs and Heart Takers

into action? A false message sent back from the four hundred

missing  Red  Fangs?  A  message  to  the  effect  that  Food  is

17

Rainbow Gorge

The Lay of the Land

plentiful, killing easy, but please come and break down the

walls of Sundabar without delay doesnt seem a credible mis-

sive, somehow. And so the leaders of the Tornskulls ponder,

time passes, and hunger gnaws.

The  leadership  of  the  Tornskulls  is  an  uneasy  triad  of

allies: the war-leaders Koront and Naurorin, and Baerzel, the

wife  of  the  tribes  chief,  Glorlarkh,  who  died  recently  in  a

cavern collapse that seems to have been nothing more than a

natural occurrence. Glorlarkh was in his day a mighty war-

leader, and over long years Baerzels wisdom, patience with

younger orcs, and cunning in battle strategies won grudging

respect  from  the  rest  of  the  tribe.  She  seems  to  have  no

desire to rule, or urge to crown or control a new chief. In-

stead, Baerzel simply wants to find whats best for the tribe

and accomplish it. Koront and Naurorin are natural rivals,

but Baerzel has convinced them both that to fight each other

would weaken the Tornskulls fatally, hurling away a chance

at greatness for the tribe.

Koront (LE male orc Bbn4/Ftr3) is a bald, gray-skinned,

much-scarred  orc  of  great  size,  famous  for  endurance  in

battle, whereas Naurorin (CE male orc Bbn3/Rog5) is faster

and  known  for  leading  daring  daylight  raids.  They  lead

almost  five  thousand  experienced  fighting  orcs,  equipped

with a variety of good weapons taken as battle-booty from

the other orc tribes. Glorlarkh devised the tactic of fighting

in  claws,  companies  of  eighty  orcs  with  veteran  leaders.

Each claw is assigned an additional six runner-orcs whose job

is to report movements and events in the fray to the chief.

As Baerzel once put it, Other orcs fight as mobs. We leap

into battle like aimed arrows.

Dead  Orc  Pass  and  the  Tornskull  orcs  are  described  in

more detail in Chapter 8.

THE GOBLIN HOLDS

The lower southern slopes of the Rauvin Mountains are in-

habited by countless goblins, who fight with each other con-

stantly, raid down into the surrounding lands, and consider

themselves  to  belong  to  at  least  three  kingdoms.  Each  so-

called  kingdom  consists  of  a  warrenlike  hold  of  caves  and

fortifications  under  the  foothills  of  the  Rauvins,  home  to

many hundreds of goblins. Nearby valleys are walled off as

crude livestock pens, and goblin workshops and armories fill

the air with the reek of smoke and the clamor of hammers

and metalwork.

The pretentions of the goblins dwelling below them vastly

amuse the orcs of all three Rauvin tribes. The orcs raid the

goblin warrens at will, bringing back scores of maimed and

helpless captives for their cook fires and stew pots.

Chalarstaukh:  The  largest  and  most  westerly  goblin

realm is ruled by portly King Asglarek and his seven sons.

Yellow,  edible  cave-worms  are  plentiful  in  the

Chalarstaukh  caverns,  so  these  goblins  are  inevitably

Worm-Eaters  to  their  fellow  Rauvin  orcs  and  goblins.

Delving  southwest  out  under  the  surrounding  lands,

Chalarstaukh  goblins  recently  breached  some  ancient

dwarf tombs, and now have some magic they hope to use

against their orc oppressorsif they can only learn how to

wield what theyve found.

Malauth: The  central  and  most  sinister  kingdom  is

ruled by Queen Nargharab. She is widely known to be the

puppet of seven powerful priests, collectively known as the

Malauthar,  who  defend  the  kingdoms  borders  with  sum-

moned  monsters.  The  Malauthar  love  mystical  invented

rituals, being feared and furthering that fear, and identify-

ing and following the true signs sent by Maglubiyet in

guiding  the  kingdom.  Most  Malauth  goblins  arent  eager

to follow these true signs; suspicion has been growing for

years that the Malauthar invent signs and their meanings

at whim.

Vaerluth: The easterly, smallest, and poorest goblin realm

is now ruled by the thirty-sixth King Vaerluth, who recently

murdered his predecessor in the usual local manner of suc-

cession.  Vaerluth  lies  in  foothills  and  shallow  cavern  net-

works infested with Huge monstrous spiders. The arachnids

are untamable and horrible to eat, though goblins can stom-

ach their gluey webs, boiled into soups and stews. After gen-

erations of exposure, Vaerluth goblins are immune to spider

venom  and  can  dwell  among  the  spiders,  where  all  other

Many  people  regard  the  Rauvin  Vale  as  the  heart  of  the

Silver Marches. Civilization follows the course of the River

Rauvin as it descends from its gorge in the Nether Moun-

tains and skirts the mountains feet, snaking west through

rugged hills, dense forests, and open fells. The rivers valley

ranges from two to ten miles or so in breadth, offering a

rare  combination  of  level  ground,  arable  land,  and  easy

communications.

Farms, holds, and small hamlets extend for hundreds of

miles, from the meeting place of the Surbrin and Rauvin to

the town of Jalanthar, in the shadow of Moon Pass. Most of

these  are  thorps  of  less  than  a  dozen  buildings,  but  Lhuv-

enhead,  roughly  forty  miles  upriver  from  Everlund,  is  a

prosperous river town whose ramshackle docks are crowded

with barges and keelboats throughout the year. Several tav-

erns,  taphouses,  and  festhalls  cater  to  the  rivermen  who

work on the Rauvin.

EVERLUND PASS

Between Silverymoon and Everlund, two of the great cities

of the Marches, lies the wildest stretch of the Rauvin Vale.

Despite the presence of two large cities close by each other,

travel  in  this  stretch  of  the  Rauvin  is  very  difficultthe

Nether  Mountains  loom  over  the  river  here,  and  the  east

bank consists of a fearsome tangle of cliffs, spires, and thick-

etlike forests in dark hanging dells. To the west lies the Sil-

verwood, an old forest rumored to lie under the protection of

Turlang the Treant. A handful of tiny freeholds cling to the

rare patches of level, clear ground in this area, but for the

most part it is deserted.

The  Everlund  Pass  is  a  rough  trail  snaking  along  the

Nether foothills above the Rauvin. In some places it marches

along  clifftops  hundreds  of  feet  above  the  river,  and  in

others  the  path  roams  far  inland  to  climb  saddles  between

otherwise  impassable  hills  closer  to  the  river.  Patrols  from

Silverymoon and Everlund keep the path clear, but monsters

from the higher peaks often wander down to prey on traffic

along this road.

JALANTHAR

This tiny settlement was formerly a riverbank way stop on

the  Rauvin  between  Moon  Pass  and  Everlund,  where  up-

stream-bound barges hired tow-beasts and expert handlers to

tow them through the pass. That service remains, housed in a

sod-barrow riverbank fortress, but persistent orc and barbar-

ian raids have forced the Jalantharren to move their hamlet

away from the south bank of the Rauvin, leaving behind sod-

roofed  cottages  reduced  to  little  better  than  rockpiles  by

decades of almost nightly fighting.

Their new homes in the foothills north of the river have

been  overrun  several  times,  but  the  hardy  Jalantharren

dwell in them anyway, retreating to cave-caches and hidden

strongholds in the Nether Mountains during the worst at-

tacks. The buildings in the new Jalanthar are half-buried in

the  ground,  and  often  look  like  small  grass  knolls.  Their

chambers are walled with thick stone and roofed with mud-

sealed timbers covered with turf to resist burning. The walls

are  then  packed  around  outside  with  earth,  and  quickly

sprout  shrubs,  creepers,  and  grasses.  Doors  are  built  to  be

braced  against  foes  battering  them  in,  and  each  home  has

many tiny breathing holes bored through the earth to the

outside (and typically hidden in the grass that cloaks them).

Vermin  can  readily  enter  through  these  holes,  so  pet  cats

are common.

Jalantharren  are  hard-working  trappers  and  hunters,  ac-

customed to living off the land and fighting off predators.

They miss the riverborne trade, but (except for the folk who

worked  the  towpath  in  Moon  Pass)  most  of  their  wealth

came from selling pelts and hiring themselves out as back-

country  guides.  This  they  still  do,  unfazed  by  the  ever-in-

creasing  monster  raids.  A  veteran  guide  of  Jalanthar

commands a fee of 1 gp per day, with a down payment of 50

gp to be paid in advance and left with kin.

Almost every Jalantharren knows the lay of the land for

a dozen miles around, and many have experience in fighting

orcs  and  other  marauders.  A  council  of  elders  governs  the

hamlet,  but  the  entire  community  works  together  in  an

arrangement they call the blood bond. To cheat or harm one

Jalantharren is to harm them alland all of them will seek

redress. In times of need or hesitation, Jalantharren spring

into action without pause for debate or lengthy arguments

over the best plan. Despite recent battle losses, their ranks in-

clude  many  adventurers  and  retired  adventurers,  about

whom wider Faern knows little.

Jalanthar boasts just one amenity for travelers: the Crow-

ing  Cockatrice  inn  and  tavern.  It  resembles  a  low-walled,

poorly  built  oval  stone  keep  standing  at  the  heart  of  the

hamlet. Inside, its central yard has been covered over with a

rickety, rusting metal roof (made of old shields and rusting-

to-scrap armor, pounded flat and held up with a profusion of

props and crossbraced poles) to make a stable of sorts. The

staff  is  welcoming  and  enthusiastic,  the  fare  simple  but

hearty,  and  the  accommodations  are  spartan.  Until  it  was

burned by the orcs for the third time and abandoned along

with the former village site, the Cockatrice was a sprawling

fieldstone roadhouse with many side wings and gables. Today,

its a refuge for all Jalantharren during raids. The Cockatrice

still serves Jalanthar Amber, the potent local cider it is justly

famous for.

Currently, a troop of fifty Argent Legion horsemen and

archers, mostly from Everlund, are camped in the remains

of  the  old  townsite.  Badel  Kilmander  (LN  human  male

Ftr5),  a  grim  old  veteran,  commands  the  troop  and  leads

them in aggressive patrols throughout the area.

RIVER RAUVIN

The Rauvin is often called the Road Through the Marches,

and it has always been a vital highway across the North. Its

clear,  icy  waters  are  navigable  as  high  as  its  meeting  with

the  Redrun  above  Sundabar,  though  strength,  experience,

and help from shore are vital to safely traversing the Moon

Pass  Gorge.  Trade-barges  and  timber  rafts  on  the  Rauvin

busily shuttle folk and goods around the North and to and

from  the  Sword  Coast  cities.  Despite  ever-growing  habita-

tion along its banks, the river remains drinkable and teems

with fish.

Shalass, lout, rock eels, river crabs, and turtles are all plen-

tiful  in  the  Rauvins  cold,  clear  waters.  Flatgills  are  the

rivers hidden treasurethin, broad, ugly fish that resemble

rectangular slabs of rotting pork or leather. They have white

underbellies and gills that open like rows of gashes in their

backs, and they taste wonderful when fried. A typical flatgill

is almost two feet long and feeds two humans. Flatgills blend

with the bottom-muck almost perfectly. Stepping on one and

feeling  that  somethings  not  quite  right  underfoot  is  the

usual way of discovering a flatgill.

Most travel on the Rauvin is accomplished by barges or

19

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 20

The Lay of the Land

keelboatsbroad,  flat-bottomed  boats  that  wallow  and

rock horribly but are capable of carrying great amounts of

goods.  Keelboats  have  high,  flat  sides,  raised  ends  for

poling and steering with oars, and masts for the rare occa-

sions  when  the  winds  are  right  and  a  sail  can  be  used  to

hasten travel.

Orcs and barbarians often fire flaming arrows at passing

barges  from  the  riverbanks.  Most  barge  crews  include  at

least  two  good  archers  or  crossbowmennot  so  much  to

return fire, but to drive off foes who might attempt to snag

or swarm the boat. Skiffs of various sorts, from kayaklike

daggers to round  coracles (floating cauldrons) are also

sometimes seen on the Rauvin, though the increase of bank

raiders has made travel for small groups in such small craft

increasingly dangerous.

Upstream-bound vessels are often towed on long lines by

mules,  horses,  or  oxen  driven  along  the  banks.  Well-worn

towpaths  flank  both  banks  of  the  river  in  places  from  Sil-

verymoon  to  Jalanthar,  and  overgrown  remnants  of  such

tracks can be seen below Silverymoon (to Surbrin-meet) and

just  south  of  Sundabar.  Only  usage  maintains  these  paths.

Brigands and raiders often lurk in concealment near them,

awaiting prey.

Harmun Rapids: Just out of sight of the docks of Sunda-

bar, heading downstream, a score of sharp, black rocks like

ripping fangs stand up out of the waters. They can be easily

seen  and  avoided  in  any  small  craft  with  someone  strong

aboard who can push with a pole, but larger craft have to

use either skilled tow-teams on both banks to hold them in

the  right  channel  to  get  through  the  rocks  unscathed,  or

steer skillfully as their vessel quickly picks up speed. Head-

ing  upstream,  the  route  is  obvious,  but  either  a  tenacious

team  of  polers  or  a  tow-team  is  needed  to  win  headway

against the force of the waters.

Moon  Pass  Gorge: The  Rauvin  cuts  through  the  Nether

Mountains  in  a  spectacular  sheer-sided  gorge  with  an  east-

west bend in the middle. Moon Pass Gorge is impassable with-

out  a  strong  tow-team  with  multiple  lines  (or  better,  two

tow-teams,  operating  from  both  banks),  or  magically  aided

locomotion of some sort. Rash travelers who lack such assis-

tance  typically  either  capsize  or  smash  their  vessel  on  the

rocks. Wiser ones unload and dismantle everything and carry

it on their backs through Moon Pass, returning to the waters

only above the Nether Mountains.

Towpaths  resembling  wide  ledges  (lacking  railings  or

handholds)  were  long  ago  cut  into  the  cliff  walls  by

dwarves  and  gnomes,  and  expert  tow-teams  maintain

riverside  encampments  above  and  below  the  mountains

for  ready  hire.  They  typically  charge  35  gp  per  trip  per

craft,  although  these  prices  rise  in  harsh  weather,  when

monsters  are  known  to  be  raiding,  or  for  particularly

large or heavy vessels.

The towpaths are too narrow for wagons, and run unbro-

ken  along  both  sides  of  the  gorge.  At  irregular  intervals

(where softer rock permitted), hollows have been dug in the

mountain walls to make wide spots allowing folk to wait or

pass each other on the paths.

No  wagon-road  traverses  Moon  Pass,  and  extensive

mountain tunneling would be necessary to make one, but

there are two high, treacherous mulepaths. Most nonwa-

terborne travel through the pass is afoot, carrying goods

in backpacks with tumplines. The mulepaths run close to

the  dangerous  caverns  in  this  area  and  are  frequently

closed by monster activity.

Trading costers and veteran bargemasters dont stint on

hiring tows, and usually send an armed force ahead on both

towpaths  to  guard  against  barbarians,  brigands,  orcs,  and

hunting monsters.

Staunt Pools: Along the south bank of the river perhaps

a days walk west of Jalanthar, the Rauvins bottom sports a

succession of deep holes that serve a freshwater giant squid

as  a  lair.  Several  bands  of  barge-guards  claim  to  have

slaughtered the squid when it attacked them, and some dis-

play trophies in proof, but others have been attacked by an-

other  identical  squid  when  they  returned  to  dive  into  the

holes seeking treasure.

No one knows what is replenishing the squids, but the tale

of the Treasure of the Holes is well known. Legend tells that

a  dwarf  treasure-barge,  heavily  laden  with  trade  bars  of

silver, lies in the deep muck of one of these pools. The pools

are named for the long-ruined village of Staunts Hold that

stands  on  the  south  bank  nearby,  its  docks  and  pilings  sag-

ging down into the water.

Striding Giant Rapids: Just far enough upstream of Ever-

lund to be out of sight of its walls is a snag caused by a statue

of  a  giant,  posed  as  if  striding  across  the  river.  At  second

glance,  beneath  the  bird  nests  and  droppings,  the  statue

seems very lifelikein fact, its a petrified hill giant. The ob-

stacle  remains  here  because  rumor  insists  that  a  terrible

curse will be unleashed on anyone shattering the giant or re-

leasing him from his stony state. No tales agree on who laid

the curse, or why.

The Silverwood

Between  the  Evermoors  and  the  Nether  Mountains,  the

Rauvin flows through the rugged foothills of the mountains.

The east bank is wild and next to impassable, threaded only

by  the  so-called  Everlund  Pass.  The  west  bank  offers  a

narrow valley floor of more or less level land broken by fre-

quent, steep-sided hills. From these river lowlands, the land

climbs up steeply again to the high, wet Evermoors, cut by

long fingerlike ridges reaching down from the moors. Over

this rugged terrain grows the Silverwood.

The Silverwood was once joined to the High Forest, but

over  centuries  loggers  working  the  woodlands  on  either

side  of  the  Evermoor  Way  (the  road  from  Everlund  to

Yartar)  have  carved  a  great  wound  through  the  forest,

almost twenty miles across. Bare hillsides littered with the

stumps of old trees line this gap. The Silverwood still sur-

vives  because  its  remaining  portion  is  a  tangled  mass  of

dark thickets, protected by the steep and treacherous ter-

rain. Many trolls and other monsters from the Evermoors

roam  this  woodland  in  search  of  game  or  the  occasional

unwary woodcutter.

Vordrorn Forest

North of the Fork in Old Delzoun lies one of the most dan-

gerous and rarely explored regions of the Silver Marches

the Vordrorn Forest. Like the Arn Forest to the south, its

made up largely of pine forest and muskeg bogs, but its prox-

imity to the towering Ice Mountains seems to shroud it in

endless  chill,  numbing  mists.  The  Vordrorn  is  sometimes

called the Ghostwood, because it is haunted by many undead,

particularly the incorporeal types such as wraiths, spectres,

and ghosts. Fortunately, these restless spirits seem bound to

the  confines  of  their  cold,  misty  forest  and  rarely  trouble

travelers who stay out of their desmesnes.

Beneath the Vordrorn lies a shallow but extensive maze

of caverns and dungeons, rumored to date back to the days

of  ancient  Illuskan.  A  cult  of  sorcerers,  death-priests,  and

warriors  with  skull-painted  faces  practiced  dark  and  evil

rites here, surviving the rise and fall of great empires and

the  depredations  of  ferocious  orc  hordes.  Over  time  they

died out (or so its believed), leaving behind a great store of

necromantic  knowledge  hidden  in  the  black  stone  towers

and ivy-grown crypts that lie half-sunken in the Vordrorns

depths, and potent curses and wards guarding their old re-

doubts and retreats.

At least one unusually powerful doomsphere (a ghost be-

holder,  this  one  a  Huge  specimen  of  22  HD)  wanders  the

Vordrorn, guarding its secrets.

The Border Areas

Four  great  natural  barriers  loosely  bound  the  Silver

Marches:  the  great  desert  Anauroch  to  the  east;  the  High

Forest  to  the  south;  the  Evermoors  to  the  west;  and  the

Spine of the World in the far north. The landmarks, sites,

and  perils  of  these  areas  are  not  truly  part  of  the  Silver

Marches,  but  travelers,  events,  and  dangers  from  these

border regions influence life in the Silver Marches on a daily

basis.  More  to  the  point,  adventurers  based  in  the  Silver

Marches frequently explore wilderlands and plunder forgot-

ten  dungeons  in  these  areassometimes  reaping  great  re-

wards,  and  sometimes  finding  nothing  but  horrible  deaths

far from home or kin.

Anauroch

Long  ago,  say  the  wisest  sages,  the  heart  of  forested

Netheril occupied this great swath of desert. Trees towered

above the land, archwizards crafted floating cities to hover

above  them,  and  then  worked  mighty  magics  that  altered

gravity,  the  weather,  and  even  the  hue  of  the  sky.  When

Netheril sank into decadence, its greatness lingered briefly

here as the verdant realms of Anauria, Asram, and Hlon-

dath . . . but its curse came in time to these lands too, in the

form  of  life-draining  magics  cast  by  the  foul  phaerimms

A ghost of the Vordrorn

21

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 22

The Lay of the Land

imprisoned  beneath  the  land.  By  their  art,  all  water  was

drained awayand where there is no water, there is desert.

The  lifeless  area  spread,  swallowing  up  Anauria  and  its

fellow  realms  despite  the  spells  worked  by  their  mightiest

mages.  Sand  blew,  dunes  formed,  and  the  Great  Sand  Sea,

Anauroch, was born.

For  ages  it  has  grown,  sundering  Faerns  Sword  Coast

northlands  from  the  Moonsea  North.  Few  folk  brave  the

scorching  heat  of  the  sands,  and  they  must  contend  with

fierce bands of asabis and the desert tribes of the Bedine.

Northernmost Anauroch is a frozen land of frost-rimed

rock and the black glacier known as the High Ice. Its mid-

dling  region  is  the  waterless  Plain  of  Standing  Stones,

where  winds  scour  jagged  rocks  amid  a  sea  of  gravel.  Its

most southerly part is the Sword, a hot, sandy desert. For

centuries intrepid explorers have tried to find a safe path to

link  the  Sword  Coast  and  the  Moonsea  with  the  shortest

possible trade route; most recently the Zhentarim of Zhen-

til  Keep  sought  this  path  to  riches,  and  with  great  labor

forged  the  route  known  as  the  Black  Road.  But  oases  are

few, and the heat, sandstorms, asabis, and human tribes are

still quite dangerous.

Very  recently,  Anauroch  was  transformed  again.  The

phaerimms escaped their prison, and a Netherese city, Shade,

returned from a long sojourn in the Plane of Shadow. The

folk  of  Shade  proved  mighty  in  magic.  They  swiftly  slew

many phaerimms, and with the same apparent ease flooded

the great salt flat known as the Shoal of Thirst with a great

storm-clouded lake known as the Shadow Sea.

Today, the black citadel of Shade stands on the northern

shore of a vast but shallow lake of fresh, cool water. Magic

keeps a dome of dark clouds above the sea, and mists cloak its

flanks, so that no shaft of sunlight might stab through for

more than a fleeting instant. Shade spells fight to keep the

howling sandstorms at bay and maintain the cloud, but thus

far  the  haughty  folk  of  Shade  have  largely  ignored  sur-

rounding lands and the remnants of the inhabitants of Anau-

roch. They consider all Anauroch theirs, but have thus far

made no move against other realms.

The Shadovars (denizens of the city of Shade) are known

to be warlike and suffer no opposition. Their wizards and sor-

cerers constantly scry and otherwise examine Faern around

them. It may not be long before they visit war on Cormyr,

Sembia, the Dales, the cities of the Moonsea, Iriaebor, Scor-

nubelor  the  confederation  of  the  Silver  Marches.  Some

among the wise doubt that any realms other than Halruaa

and Thay can muster magic enough to withstand the wizards

of Shade.

From this new City of Wizards, doomsayers whisper, the

Shadovars will conquer Cormyr, or the Dales, or the Silver

Marches, using the mountains and sands of Anauroch as de-

fenses to keep armies away from their city. The Great Sand

Sea  will  shortly  be  crawling  with  the  most  fearsome  mon-

sters power-crazed wizards can twist out of living beasts, and

all  too  soon  such  horrors  will  be  sent  forth  to  invade  the

lands around, spreading the tyranny of evil magecraft once

more. Expect flying, venom-spitting human skulls, they say,

wraiths that can hurl spells, and men who can become snakes

at will and back again. . . .

Whatever the truth, all who know the tales of Anauroch

agree  that  its  shifting  sands  have  uncovered  ruined  cities

before, and will do so again. Not a few of these places are the

lairs of lamias, liches, phaerimms, or worse, armed with relics

of  fell  magic  powerful  enough  to  give  even  the  Shadovars

cause  for  worry.  Some  observers,  with  grim  amusement,

await the moment when Anauroch awakens to administer a

lesson to the sneering archwizards of Shade.

Delimbiyr Vale

Travelers skilled and determined enough to make their way

through Turnstone Pass come into an upland known as the

Talonsa  region  of  steep  foothills  cut  with  many  deep,

swift  streams  flowing  to  the  south.  These  streams  join  to-

gether one by one to give rise to the Delimbiyr, one of the

great  rivers  of  the  North.  Delimbiyr  Vale  stretches  from

the  southern  foothills  of  the  Nether  Mountains  for  hun-

dreds of miles along the borders of the High Forest, flowing

beneath the shadow of the Graypeak Mountains as it slowly

winds west toward the sea.

Far  to  the  south,  the  middle  Delimbiyr  joins  together

cities such as Orlbar, Loudwater, and Secomber, but this is a

long way from the Silver Marches. The portion of Delimbiyr

Vale that lies near the Silver Marches is one of the most des-

olate regions of the North, consisting of the wild lands be-

tween  the  High  Forest  and  the  Far  Forest.  There  is  little

pressure  to  open  the  region  to  settlement  or  tradeits

simply  too  remoteand  so  this  vast  region  is  left  to  its

crumbling ruins, nameless monsters, and ancient secrets.

For centuries, the demonic forces of Hellgate Keep domi-

nated  this  area,  but  the  destruction  of  that  ancient  citadel

has  broken  their  power  over  the  region.  Nevertheless,

demonspawn  still  pose  a  great  threat  to  the  region.  In  the

Underdark caverns beneath this wild land, a demonic general

named  Kaanyr  Vhok  the  Sceptered  One  (CE  human  half-

fiend  Ftr7/Rog2/Wiz6)  gathers  an  army  of  tanarukks  and

fiendish beasts. Travel in this area is exceedingly dangerous.

The Evermoors

For  years  this  rocky  region  was  also  known  as  the  Troll-

moors,  but  recently  hill  giants  displaced  from  more

northerly  wilderlands  moved  in,  using  fire  and  sheer

strength and savagery to butcher the numerous trolls. The

southern verges of the Evermoors are still alive with hunt-

ing bands (typically five to eight strong) of the loathsome

monsters, but many trolls have been slain or driven south

right out of the moors, to roam the open lands and menace

traffic along the Evermoor Way.

Nesm is the sole human settlement of any size in the

moorlands.  The  Evermoors  are  studded  with  abandoned

steadings where humans once tried to raise sheep or roth

before they learned the true strength of the trolls (usually

the hard way). Barbarian human tribes have also raided the

Evermoors from time to time. Its not a land for the faint

of heart.

The moors are high rock plateaus, split here and there

by small, steep-sided stream-gullies. Though tors and rock

22

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 23

The Lay of the Land

outcrops are everywhere to be seen, most of the underlying

plateau rock is covered with a thin layer of soil. The result

is  an  open,  windswept  landscape  of  gently  rolling  grassy

hills, studded with only a few stunted trees. Sucking bogs

surrounded by a rich profusion of plants, including many

valued wild herbs, form in the hollows of the moors. Long,

sinuous  ridges  of  knife-sharp  rock  run  through  the  land-

scape  like  the  spines  of  buried  dragons.  Many  bogs  offer

shelter to dangerous plants that can drag down the unwary

traveler, and so now hold small hidden hoards of scattered

coins and valuables.

The tors of the Evermoors offer landmarks to travelers

and those few shepherds who raise livestock in this region.

The  Old  Man,  named  for  its  resemblance  to  a  craggy,

bearded  human  face,  stands  halfway  between  Nesm  and

the Laughingflow. Another, called Startop due to the way

moonlight  dances  on  its  distinctive  pointed  tip  on  clear

nights, is located due east of Nesm, exactly halfway across

the moorlands.

These tors often hide veins of very pure, rich ore, notably

copper, lead, and gold. The few miners who have worked the

moors say its rock is banded on edge, like slabs of soft cheese

laid between slates. Some of the layers can be dug out with a

blunt sword or even a fire-hardened stick, while other, darker

layers blunt the strongest pickaxes. Many miners resorted to

digging pits in the soft rock and building fires in them, so the

heat would crack the harder stones, allowing them to remove

great slabs and repeat the process.

Experienced miners say that natural caverns must riddle

the moor plateau, wherever water flows undergroundand

certainly  one  sizable  river,  the  Laughingflow,  rises  in  the

heart  of  the  moors.  A  few  claim  that  The  metals  there,

right enough, and in plenty, and only the depredations of

the trolls (and now the giants) have kept the moors from

becoming a mining area every bit as rich as the mountains

to  the  east  and  north  where  dwarves  raised  citadels.  It

should be remembered that one of the richest dwarfholds of

all, Mithral Hall, lies just to the north of the moors, across

the Surbrin.

The Evermoors are studded with old burial mounds, with

occupants ranging from Netherese humans to dwarves fallen

in battle to barbarian princes. Most moor-tombs are simple

arrangements  of  shallow-buried  bodies  beneath  slabs,  but

some yield more than the rusty remnants of what must have

been a greatsword or a war axe. Evermoor tombs have given

up magic wands and staffs in plenty over the years, and there

was a time when magic rings were so plentiful that they used

to wash down the Laughingflow in spring floods.

The  Laughingflow: Long  known  as  the  Trollflow  in

Nesm, this clear, fast-flowing river has a gravel bottom and

banks lined with felsul, laspar, and a few blueleaf trees. Its

water is drinkable but has a sharp mineral tang. The river is

home to many edible crabs, a few shalass (tasty, red-fleshed

fish that resemble trout, and grow up to 2 feet in length),

many schools of the small brown lout (a tasty but bony pan-

fish), and also slimy but edible black-and-green rock eels that

inhabit the river bottom.

Nesm: Nesm has always been a fortified trading town

under threat from raiding trolls and barbarians. Now its a

pale shadow of its former self, a crumbling fortress besieged

sporadically by furious giants. Nesm has lost fully one-fifth

of its inhabitants to frequent barbarian, troll, and now giant

raids. Since the coming of the giants, the Riders of Nesm

have been all but obliberated, their citadel on the west bank

of the Surbrin ruined and lost, along with its bridge, and the

docks, paddocks, and stock-pens of Nesm. The townspeople

have lost both their moor-grazed sheep and cattle, and any

hope of grazing anything on the Evermoors in the foresee-

able future. They subsist now almost entirely on vegetables

grown  within  the  walls,  and  lout  netted  from  the  cold

waters of the Surbrin.

The town looks like a large castle with battered, untidily

repaired walls; inside are many ruins interspersed with un-

damaged square stone houses. Most houses sport roof gar-

dens; their gently sloping roofs tend to leak in wet weather,

and  they  have  meltwater  cisterns  for  gathering  drinking

water. Many homes stand empty and are used as temporary

sleeping-shelters  by  visitors.  There  are  at  least  six  always-

roaring  forges  in  town.  Nesms  taverns  are  uniformly

badly lit, crowded, roaring places full of people looking for

a fight.

The First Speaker of the Council, the wizard Tessarin, was

voted into power after the fall of the previous government,

which was dominated by clerics of Waukeen promoting trade

and  growth.  Tessarin  has  become  the  de  facto  permanent

ruler of her ever-shrinking home. Once only somewhat law-

less,  Nesm  has  now  become  a  fortress  under  siege,  with

every  inhabitant  armed  and  all  folk  taking  turns  manning

the walls or heading out to escort trade-barges coming to the

broken bridge over the Surbrin. The much-battered walls of

Nesm still bristle with ballistae and heavy catapults.

Nesm was once seen as an ideal base from which to ex-

plore the many abandoned dwarfholds of the upper Surbrin,

but  few  come  here  for  that  purpose  anymore.  Most  folk

come  here  for  the  steel.  Natural  clefts  in  the  rock  of  the

moor plateau right underneath Nesm still yield rich iron,

and Nesm continues to be an important center for smelt-

ing  and  smithing.  Nesm  blades  are  the  solid,  dependable

swords of the North, but even more important to the local

economy  are  the  vast  numbers  of  pick-heads  and  shovel

blades still exported from here to just about every nondwarf

community of the North. Before the coming of the giants,

small but hardy Nesm horses were bred in ranches west of

the Citadel, but theyve all been eaten now. The only stock

left is scattered throughout the Silver Marches, in the hands

of many owners.

Nesm  is  desperate  to  become  a  member  of  the  Silver

Marches  and  gain  military  aid  to  slay  the  giants.  Alustriel

favors the idea, but she cant convince the present members

of the Marches to bring in an isolated town that will imme-

diately cost them dearly in gold and blood to defend. In the

meantime  she  has  been  sending  Tessarin  large  amounts  of

coin from her personal fortune, as well as any adventurers

she can recruit, through a portal linking a secret location in

Silverymoon with a chamber in the ruined temple of Wau-

keen, within the walls of Nesm.

This is a town on the verge of obliberation. If more giants

come south, or disease or a harsh winter besets the exhausted,

The Fallen Lands

For years this remote wilderland area has been the treasure

ground to folk gossiping in Waterdeep and the Sword Coast

North.  Myth  Drannor  may  harbor  wondrous  magic,  but

everyone knows of its great perils. Here, in the Fallen Lands,

lies  not  just  a  city,  but  an  entire  realm of  treasure-packed

ruins. To this day theres a brisk trade in Llorkh, Loudwater,

and  Secomber  in  treasure  maps  purporting  to  reveal  loca-

tions of artifacts of mighty magic, or treasure hoards of awe-

some value just waiting in the Fallen Lands for someone to

come along and pick them up.

Those who have actually ventured into the region say

its  rough,  rolling  bush  country,  where  many  monsters

lurk. Often, at night, weird glows arise here and there

for  these  lands  were  once  home  to  Netherese  not  magi-

cally powerful enough to craft their own flying cities or

great fortresses, but every bit as ambitious as the archwiz-

ards who ruled them. Recklessly powerful magic has a way

of surviving, albeit twisted and decaying, far beyond the

fools who crafted it.

Here still stand many ruins, spontaneously erupting from

time to time with chaotic magical effects. Many of these ruins

serve  as  the  lair  of  a  monster  (or  a  pack  of  wolves  or  other

predators), and no other place in Faern sports such a wild pro-

fusion of strange or variant beasts, such as wolves with lashing

tentacles  or  two  heads.  The  restless  magic,  it  seems,  changes

dwellers in the Fallen Lands. Those who have ventured deepest

into the region warn that phaerimms and swarms of beholders

roam the land, hunting adventurers avidly.

The  monsters  that  seem  to  be  most  common  on  the

verges of the Fallen Lands include (in roughly descending

order  of  frequency)  leucrottas,  wolves,  doppelgangers,

harpies, displacer beasts, gray renders, and krenshars. Gricks

and dark nagas are plentiful in ruins near the edges, but as

one goes in deeper and deeper, gibbering mouthers and in-

creasingly stranger monsters are found, including some ten-

tacled  thing  thats  large  and  powerful  enough  to  snatch

overflying dragons down from the sky.

STORMKEEP

Named  for  the  lightning  bolts  that  stab  upward  from  its

summit  at  any  passing  cloud,  this  dark,  fang-shaped  lone

tower  is  infamous  as  a  landmark:  It  stands  almost  in  the

center of the Fallen Lands. No doors or windows are visible

in its slender, tapering walls, and the entire structure seems

to be one gigantic piece of an obsidianlike substance. Some of

the  oldest  Fallen  Lands  tales  say  the  only  way  to  enter

Stormkeep is by straying onto the wrong stone nearby, which

holds an unmarked but continuously active portal.

Inside Stormkeep lie great tanks of glowing oils contain-

ing  body  parts  that  graft  themselves  onto  any  injury

theyre touched to. Some of these limbs sport barbed talons,

bone-spur rapiers or axe-blades, or suction-sucker pads for

easily climbing sheer stone walls. Injured intruders who im-

merse  themselves  in  the  oils  speedily  become  whole  once

more. Other tales insist that dragons come here to feed on

the  body  parts  or  avail  themselves  of  healing,  and  they

fiercely attack any intruders.

Still other tales speak of fell Netherese wizards, or strange

beasts altered by Netherese sorcery, who sleep away the ages

in  spell-cocoons  in  Stormkeep.  Those  who  free  such  long

sleepers are typically their first victims. Even wilder stories

describe  powerful  weapons  that  bond  to  the  wearer  and

thereafter can be hidden in extradimensional otherwhere,

to return to their owners hand in an instant, by speaking a

word or through mere thought.

All of the tales hint that Stormkeep was built for some

great,  awful,  as  yet  unrealized  and  mysterious  purpose.  All

who venture into it may well be marked in some unknown

way, for later summoning or sending-goaded tasks, when the

fulfillment of that purpose comes nigh.

WITCHFIRE

Wild  magic  and  dead  magic  areas  dot  the  landscape  of  the

Fallen  Lands.  One  of  the  most  peculiar  manifestations  of

24

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 25

The Lay of the Land

this Weave-torn landscape is the phenomenon of witchfire

crawling,  spitting  discharges  of  raw  power  that  sear  living

beings, recharge magic items, or infuse creatures with short-

lived roiling energies.

A ball of witchfire is typically 2d4 feet in diameter and

moves over the surface of the ground at a speed of 20 feet,

although it drifts over obstacles such as ground cover, water,

or sheer drops. When a creature comes into contact with a

globe of witchfire, roll d% and consult the following table.

fouled, but others survive as treacherous quaking bogs where

will-o-wisps  lurkand  the  occasional  chuul  waits  in  sub-

merged hiding to drag unfortunate creatures down.

The  eastern  verge  of  the  forest  is  more  lightly  wooded,

thanks  to  the  heavy  grazing  of  an  increasingly  numerous

herd of deer. The Far Forest also hides a handful of ancient

ruins.  Most  are  fallen  and  overgrown  beneath  roots  and

vines, but a rare few are still visible as thrusting turrets or

exposed walls of stone amid the greenery.

Veteran  explorers  of  the  Fallen  Lands  warn  that  witch-

fire  seems  attracted  to  permanent,  stable  magic,  such  as

magic items or spells fixed by the permanency spell. A ball

of  witchfire  automatically  moves  toward  the  creature

with the most powerful (measured by spell level) perma-

nent spell or magic item on his person within 100 feet of

its present location.

The Far Forest

Formerly  called  the  Far  Forests  before  its  scarred,  riven

woodlands rejoined into a single, unbroken forest, this wood

is named for its remoteness from civilized lands. Once home

to many sprites, the Far Forest is studded with small lakes

and  crisscrossed  by  ancient  game-trails.  Its  deepest  reaches

hold  giant  spiders  and  lurking  horrors  descended  from  the

results of Netherese beast-experimentations.

The  sprites  fled  or  were  slaughtered  when  fiends  out  of

Hellgate Keep infested the woods, corrupting its very trees

with  their  evil.  Almost  overnight,  the  woodlands  became  a

battleground of fiends slaying and devouring each other. The

Far Forest soon became dark and deadly, a place where tap-

roots strangled or drank blood, trees smothered each other,

and deadly webs were everywhere.

After the fall of Hellgate Keep, Turlang led a treant as-

sault, cleansing the northerly portion of the Far Forest. He

turned back from this prodigious labor, leaving some treants

behind to make the woods their own, when human clearances

of his own forest (the area men call Turlangs Wood) grew

too  great  to  go  unaddressed  any  longer.  Dryads  have  since

come to the Far Forest, and centaurs and satyrs are begin-

ning to explore its southern areas. A few dangerous trees and

plants, notably tendriculoses and assassin vines, remain along

the  forests  western  edge.  They  were  relocated  there  by

Turlang to remove them from the rest of the forest and to

discourage woodcutting.

Humans  wont  find  any  part  of  the  thickly  grown  Far

Forest  free  of  danger.  Owlbears,  ettercaps  and  spiders,

stirges, snakes, bears, and giant beetles all roam its wooded

ridges and rolling hills. Its lakes are small and some are still

MASULKS TOMB

Calishite  legend  tells  of  a  long-ago  vizar  stricken  with  an

incurable  withering  disease.  Masulk  the  Magnificent  lin-

gered in pain for many months, setting his affairs in order.

He  commanded  that  upon  his  death,  his  body  was  to  be

placed on his favorite flying carpet, and sent north to fly

as  the  breezes  take  me,  and  be  buried  where  it  comes  to

earth, with no coin, but with all the magics I have won

for none of my blood can be trusted with such power, lest

they do ill in their strivings. Let none hold back one ring or

scroll,  lest  they  suffer  my  secret  curse,  but  let  all  be  laid

with  me,  under  stone  and  under  root,  until  the  name  of

Masulk is as forgotten as it should be.

This  was  done.  His  servants  followed  the  dead  mans

carpet  on  another  and  dug  a  tomb  somewhere  in  the  Far

Forest, replanting trees and vines and shrubs to conceal it

before  they  departed.  One  decided  to  betray  the  others  in

order to steal his dead masters wealth. But when he turned

on his fellows, he was struck down by unseen magic, only to

rise almost immediately as an allip that tried again vainly

to slay his fellows as they trudged out of the forest. Other

servants met with misadventure on the long journey home,

and the tale of Masulks curse spread.

No  word  of  the  successful  plundering  of  the  tomb  has

ever  arisen,  and  no  record  remains  of  what  magics  were

buried with the vizar.

TAERYMDOOM

The  southeastern  reaches  of  the  Far  Forest  still  harbor  a

mysterious evil that spews forth cloakers and chaos beasts

from underground caverns. Those who have dared to enter

these natural caves say they stretch for miles underground,

and are guarded by vargouilles. Perhaps a deepspawn lairs

therein, or perhaps a portal disgorges these monsters from

elsewhere.

Named for an elf adventurer, Taerym, who met his death

under  persistent  cloaker  attacks  while  trying  to  battle  his

way  into  the  caverns  and  identify  what  evil  laired  there,

Taerymdoom remains a mysterybut its a peril known to

have claimed a Zhentarim exploring party and at least one

band of adventurers, the Darkblades of Esmeltaran. Worse

yet, its reach and boldness seem to be spreading.

Frost Hills

The southernmost spur of the mighty Spine of the World,

the Frost Hills combine with the Evermoors to the south to

form  the  western  border  of  the  Silver  Marches.  Rising  to

nearly 4,000 feet in elevation, these mighty ramparts serve

25

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 26

The Lay of the Land

to shield the Moonlands and the Rauvin Vale from the worst

of  the  weather  and  monsters  lurking  in  the  even  mightier

peaks to the north.

The Frost Hills are the site of one of the strongest dwarf-

holds of the North, Mithral Hall. They are also home to sev-

eral  roving  Uthgardt  tribes,  the  ever-present  orcs,  frost

giants, white dragons, and the occasional lich-lord moldering

in labyrinthine ruins under the ice and snow.

BLACK RAVEN CAMP

On  the  rock-strewn  summit  of  Dhaemangs  Head,  the

most southerly of the Frost Hills, a band of Black Raven

Uthgardt has set up camp. Dhaemangs Head commands

sweeping views over the confluence of the Surbrin and

Rauvin  rivers,  as  well  as  the  approaches  to

Mithral  Hall.  From  this  eyrie  the  Black

Ravens  spy  out  the  approach  of  river

traffic  or  landbound  caravans  and

plan  lightning-swift  aerial  raids

against  the  soft,  stupid  South-

landers.  When  not  planning

their  next  exploit,  the  Black

Ravens hunt the forests and mead-

ows  of  the  high  slopes  of  the  Frost

Hills, carefully watching for the

approach  of  flying  enemies

who  might  have  a  chance

of  reaching  their  hilltop

camp.

This  camp  is  led  by

Garamel  Talonhand,  a

seasoned  scout  and

bandit  who,  like  most  Black  Ravens,  views

anyone not of her tribe as a decadent weakling de-

serving  of  whatever  indignity  the  Black  Ravens

care  to  visit  upon  them.  Since  Dhaemangs

Head is a raider camp, there are few noncom-

batants  and  no  children  here;  the  barbarians  families  are

hidden in safer, less exposed villages far away.

Garadocs  Camp  (thorp):  Conventional;  AL  CN;  800  gp

limit;  Assets  1,960  gp;  Population  49;  Isolated  (humans

100%). Due to the success of their raids, the Black Ravens

are in possession of much more wealth than the size of the

camp would otherwise indicate.

Important  Characters:  Kelemoc  Ravenheart,  CN  male

All of the Black Raven warriors are mounted on giant raven

flights would suffice to move everyone in the camp to safety.

CASTLE OF ILLUSION

Hundreds  of  years  ago,  a  powerful  illusionist  raised  this

remote  keep  and  filled  it  with  subtle  and  deadly  puzzles,

traps, and glamers. After his death, a local tribe of orcs over-

ran the place and put the illusionists servants to the sword,

but the wizards deadly spells and wards slew many of the in-

vaders and drove even more mad. The place sat empty for

centuries, until a human wizard named Malcyon (NE male

human  Abj12)  carefully  unraveled  the  castles  secrets  and

made himself the master of the place.

Malcyon frequently summons powerful fiends and

bargains  with  terrible  powers  for  more  magical

knowledge. Devils guard his castle and roam the

lands nearby, while others tutor him in the dark

arts. The abjurer does not realize it yet, but he is

well on his way to making a second Hellgate

Keep  to  replace  the  one  destroyed  a  few

years ago.

DUNGEON OF

THE RUINS

Near  the  abandoned

dwarf  village  of  Settle-

stone  lies  the  Dungeon  of

the Ruins, said to be the re-

mains of an old wizards con-

clave  that  congregated  in  the

halls  of  an  old  keep.  The  Dun-

geon  of  the  Ruins  is  home  to  a

number  of  slaad,  including  a  minor

slaad lord (presumably unique) known as

Bazim-Gorag,  the  Firebringer.  No  one  sus-

pects that such a creature lurks in the Dun-

geon of Ruins.

The wizards who once lived in this place summoned the

slaad lord to destroy a great warband of trolls that threat-

ened their college, and Bazim-Gorag did sobut their spells

of binding failed, and the slaad lord turned his fire against

the wizards conclave, too. The survivors succeeded in trap-

ping  Bazim-Gorag  in  the  dungeons  beneath  their  ruined

home, and then abandoned the place. Bazim-Gorag remained

trapped for many years, but now other slaad have discovered

where he has been held for so long, and they are working on

freeing the Firebringer from his prison.

FELL PASS

Between the northernmost rampart of the Frost Hills and

the Spine of the World lies a high, cold pass that links the

Lurkwood to the upper vale of the Surbrin and the Moon-

lands beyond. Few come this way now; most who travel east

to  west  across  the  North  find  it  easierand  saferto

follow the course of the Rauvin, or skirt well to the south of

the  Evermoors.  But  a  few  bold  bands  of  Uthgardt,  orcs,

ogres, and other monstrous raiders occasionally make use of

this route.

In addition to the bitter climate and hard going, Fell Pass

A Black Raven takes to the sky

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 27

The Lay of the Land

is also haunted. Long ago a great battle was fought here, as

an army of Delzouns dwarves crushed an orc horde seeking

to  invade  the  dwarf  kingdom  by  this  difficult  path.  The

dwarves hid in an old, long-abandoned stronghold carved be-

neath the top of the pass and took the horde in the rear as

they passed over. Both dwarves and orcs are long gone, but

many  gargoylesincluding  several  strange  and  powerful

crossbreeds of types not seen elsewhereinfest the chambers

and  mines  of  the  old  stronghold,  preying  on  any  travelers

foolish enough to dare Fell Pass.

MITHRAL HALL

The  ancestral  home  of  Clan  Battlehammer,  this  famous

dwarfhold  fell  into  the  hands  of  a  sinister  shadow  dragon

almost  two  hundred  years  ago.  Its  folk  wandered,  disinher-

ited, for many long years, but in 1356 DR the hero Bruenor

Battlehammer  slew  the  dragon.  He  later  returned  to  drive

out  the  dragons  remaining  servants,  and  reestablished

Mithral Hall for his folk.

Mithral Hall is described in greater detail in Chapter 3:

Cities of the Silver Marches.

The High Forest

The wild, lush heart of the North is a vast wood, the rem-

nant  of  the  endless  forest  that  once  cloaked  these  lands

from  the  sea  to  the  rocky  heart  of  what  became  Anau-

roch.  No  greater  source  of  timber  and  wildlife  can  be

found near the Silver Marches, but few folk fell trees in

the  High  Forest  and  survive  unscathed.  Hunters  fare

better, though many of them become the hunted if they

venture deep into the endless treegloom. And no creature

who  kindles  fire  in  the  High  Forest  goes  unattacked  for

long.  Druids  say  Eldath  and  Mielikki  personally  bring

doom to such desecrators.

Many  works  have  been  written  about  the  strange

magics, gigantic creatures, and forgotten ruins of the deep

forest. Most folk in the Silver Marches regard such lore as

good entertainmentand a warning to stay far away from

the Great Wood. The High Forest is home to powerful tre-

ants, wild centaurs, and proud, stealthy wood elves deter-

mined  to  drive  out  the  evil  influences  that  lurk  in  the

forest depthsbands of orcs, drow, and the daemonfey of

House Dlardrageth.

CITADEL OF THE MISTS

Home of the enigmatic lord known as the Mistmaster (CN

human male Clr9 of Deneir/Ill16), this castle is a mysterious

hold  near  the  forests  northern  edge.  No  more  than  a  few

dozen  people  live  here,  most  the  retainers  and  servants  of

the Mistmaster. Several powerful adventurers who serve as

his agents and allies also can be found here.

When not veiled by its trademark mists, the citadel ap-

pears as a triangle of three slim towers joined by enclosing

walls. It is built over the ruins of an ancient elf fortress.

The  Mistmaster  generally  veils  the  location  of  his  home

with powerful illusions and the mists under his command,

but  the  castle  is  well  defended  by  spells  designed  to

summon  powerful  air  elementals  to  drive  off  intruders

who by luck or determination pierce his veiling magic.

Generally, the Mistmaster and his retainers have little to

do with the forest beyond their walls. On occasion they have

provided  shelter  and  hospitality  to  wanderers  in  desperate

circumstances.  In  1369  DR,  a  host  of  Blue  Bear  Uthgardt

and demons attacked the citadel but were driven off by the

Mistmaster, his allies and servants, and a host of fey assem-

bled by Turlang the treant.

ELVEN PORT

A  long  time  ago,  a  prosperous  elf  town  stood  here  on  the

verge of the High Forest, its docks and quays reaching to the

upper Delimbiyr River. As one of the most accessible of the

ruins of old Eaerlann, Elven Port has been explored many

times  by  adventuring  bands.  For  many  years  the  ruins  of

Elven Port harbored nothing more than the incidental ma-

rauders and predatory monsters that tend to lair in old ruins,

and  no  great  treasure  or  peril  was  found  within,  but  that

seems to have changedno adventurers have returned with

news of this place in six years or more.

The old tower of the towns lord has been occupied by a

powerful band of daemonfey, led by Vaerilmor Floshin (CE

male  feyri  Ftr2/Wiz9).  Vaerilmor  and  his  followers  have

been engaged in luring elf adventurers to this place and cor-

rupting them with foul magic, plotting the eventual seizure

of power over the elves of the High Forest.

GRANDFATHER TREE

Without a doubt the mightiest tree on the face of Faern,

the  Grandfather  Tree  is  sacred  to  several  forest  deities,  in-

cluding  Silvanus  himself.  It  stands  many  hundreds  of  feet

high, and its branches spread out to shade an immense area

of  the  forest  floor.  The  wood  elves,  Tree  Ghost  Uthgardt,

and other nonevil denizens of the forest venerate this loca-

tion and guard it carefully.

A  short  distance  from  the  Grandfather  Tree  lies  a  per-

manent camp of the Tree Ghost tribe. Its not a true settle-

ment, in that its residents come and go as the mood strikes

them,  but  at  any  given  time  a  couple  of  hundred  Tree

Ghosts live here.

HELLGATE KEEP

Now  buried  under  the  northeast  corner  of  the  forest,  this

citadel of evil was razed in 1368 DR. Turlang and his treants

moved to advance the borders of the forest and submerge the

old fortress in the depths of the trees. Adventurers seeking to

disturb the ruins are turned back by the treants.

LOST PEAKS

These  forested  mountains  dominate  the  northwest  corner  of

the High Forest. Many fey dwell around these peaks, as well as

a  large  tribe  of  centaurs  who  keep  a  careful  eye  on  human

hunters and woodcutters from Olostins Hold. A long-forgot-

ten  dwarfhold  lies  under  the  easternmost  of  the  Lost  Peaks.

More than a thousand years ago some terrible curse or plague

swept the place, killing all within. Their moldering remains still

lie where they fell, some by their forges, others in their homes.

Whatever evil thing happened here seems long overfor now.

LOTHEN OF THE SILVER SPIRES

This  long-ruined  elf  city  once  marked  the  southernmost

extent  of  Siluvanede,  a  sun  elf  kingdom  in  the  western

reaches of the High Forest. Its not far from the dwarf ruin

now known as the Hall of Four Ghosts. The city is overrun

by  orcs  of  the  Tanglethorn,  Sharpspike,  and  Horned  Lord

tribes, and is the strongest orc community remaining in the

High Forest. The orcs are said to worship Malar, and their

leaders are evil rangers and druids.

MHIILAMNIIR

In the north-central portion of the forest lies the ruins of

one  of  the  great  cities  of  old  Eaerlann,  the  temple  city  of

Mhiilamniir.  The  buildings  are  covered  in  moss  and  vines,

and  many  of  the  domes  and  minarets  have  long  since  col-

lapsed.  Wood  elves  used  to  come  here  often  to  reflect  on

their  past  and  seek  answers  to  the  future,  but  no  morea

green dragon named Chloracidara (old female green dragon)

lairs  in  the  central  temple,  beneath  the  fallen  dome.  Her

brood of wyrmlings hunts the forest nearby, growing strong

and wicked.

THE NAMELESS DUNGEON

Located near the old town now known as Elven Port, the

Nameless  Dungeon  is  another  ruin  of  old  Eaerlann.  Its

linked  to  Elven  Port  and  the  ruins  of  Mhiilamniir  by  an

overgrown  elf  highway  known  as  the  Old  Road.  The  dun-

geon  consists  of  an  ancient  citadel  in  which  were  hidden

many terrible elf artifacts. Access to the Nameless Dungeon

was long barred by the wood elves of the forest. Three years

ago,  in  Alturiak  of  1369  DR,  two  groups  of  monsters  in-

vaded the Nameless Dungeon, driving off the elf garrison.

The first was a strong company of tanarukks and half-fiends

calling  itself  the  Scoured  Legion  of  Hellgate  Keep.  The

second  was  a  powerful  band  of  nagas,  yuan-ti,  and  other

snakelike  creatures  that  arrived  through  a  mysterious

portal. The two bands vie for control of the dungeon.

NOANARS HOLD

Popular  with  nobles  and  wealthy  merchants  of  the  Sword

Coast, Noanars Hold is a village that grew up around one of

the  most  famous  hunting  lodges  in  the  North.  Stone  cot-

tages and well-kept stables ramble beneath the trees, not far

from the spot where the road from the Stone Bridge comes

up to meet the Evermoor Way. A small keep, home to the

Hunt Lords who rule the settlement, watches over the vil-

lage.  Dark  rumors  whisper  that  the  Hunt  Lords  arrange

hunts  of  a  particularly  sinister  sort  for  those  patrons  re-

questing such services, such as wanton slaughters, hunts of

sentient humanoids or forest creatures, or convenient acci-

dents as required.

Noanars  Hold  (hamlet):  Nonstandard;  AL  NE;  200  gp

OLOSTINS HOLD

The only human settlement of any size in the High Forest,

Olostins Hold is a fortified keep protecting a small village

of about two hundred people, and extending its protection to

as  many  as  six  hundred  more  farmers,  woodcutters,  and

homesteaders in the immediate area. The holds folk are very

careful not to anger the powers of the forest; the woodcut-

ters  take  only  dead  or  dying  trees,  sometimes  ranging  far

into the forest to find trees safe to bring down.

Of late the folk of Olostins Hold have been much trou-

bled by trolls driven south from the Evermoors. These ma-

rauding  monsters  have  made  the  YartarEverlund  road

much less safe than it used to be, and so less traffic passes

near Olostins Hold than did in previous years.

REITHEILLAETHOR

On  the  banks  of  the  Heartblood  River,  near  its  northern-

most bend, lies a large, well-defended village of wood elves.

Many of the elves come and go as they please, and so over

the course of seasons many new faces appear while familiar

ones  vanish,  seeking  new  dwelling  places  elsewhere  in  the

forest.  The  elves  of  Reitheillaethor  (pronounced  rye-thigh-

The Lay of the Land

THE STAR MOUNTS

Centers of mystery and wild tales for centuries, these moun-

tains rise from the heart of the vast High Forest. Cloaked in

clouds and vaguely menacing, they are half-legendary land-

marks to the folk of the Silver Marches. Glimpsed from the

lower vales of the Dessarin and Delimbiyr rivers, they serve

to mark direction for travelers skirting the southern edge

of the High Forest, and to foster many fireside rumors.

There  are  good  causes  for  such  talk.  The  Star  Mounts

sport  strange  gleaming  lights  on  clear  nights,  and  dragons

are  sometimes  seen  flying  to  or  from  them.  Fierce  winds

arise and blow from the mountains, forcing flying creatures

awayor  causing  them  to  veer  suddenly  and  dash  to  their

deaths against rocks.

The  elves  of  now-fallen  Eaerlann  mined  many  metals

from the Star Mounts, including nearly pure iron and nickel.

They  are  widely  believed  to  be  the  creators  of  the  strange

crystals found on the slopes of the Mountseerie construc-

tions that emit beams of light when touched by moonlight.

In at least four places the crystals once rose in huge clusters

like  castles  or  mountainside  villages,  though  theyve  been

smashed (perhaps by dragons), and now stand as heaps and

broken walls of crystal shards.

A few needlelike, lone stone towers perch on high spurs

and knobs of the rising Mounts. Most folk believe these are

the abodes of powerful wizards and sorcerers, for only beings

who command great magic could have built homes in such

remote  and  dangerous  places,  fighting  off  dragons  and  the

gods  know  what  else.  For  years  aarakocras  laired  among

these peaks, and both they and the dragons found shelter in

caverns in the flanks of the Star Mounts. The elf mines, too,

lie hidden within these peaks.

All of these features beckon with the promise of treasure

or great riches yet to be mined, but all of them also warn of

great  danger.  To  someone  in  the  Silver  Marches  desperate

for coin, the Star Mounts are a beacon of promise. To every-

one else, they seem a death trap for fools.

STONE STAND

Two rings of stone cairns mark the site of an Uthgardt an-

cestor mound here. An oak tree surmounts this mound, a cut-

ting  taken  from  the  Grandfather  Tree  long  ago.  Once  the

ancestor mound of the Blue Bear tribe, the Stone Stand also

served as the ancestor mound for the Tree Ghosts until they

rediscovered the Grandfather Tree a few years ago. The Blue

Bear  tribe  is  virtually  extinct  now,  and  no  one  comes  near

this place anymore. The mound is guarded by the ghosts of

several long-dead members of the tribe, each of whom was

known in life as a cruel and violent warrior. The place is now

considered sacred to Malar the Beast-Lord.

TURLANGS WOOD

Whatever  the  truth  about  its  nature,  the  High  Forest  re-

mains  deep,  green,  and  mysterious  to  most  humans.  Its

northwestern verges, closest to most of the Silver Marches,

are  ruled  by  the  great  treant  Turlang,  and  so  bear  (to

humans) the name Turlangs Wood.

Turlang believes that more than enough land in Faern

has been cleared and lost. He is determined to defend whats

left  of  the  existing  northwestern  edge  of  the  High  Forest

The Lay of the Land

against further encroachmentand wont hesitate to slay to

keep axes or fire at bay.

In  recent  years,  he  has  attempted  to  slow  the  destruc-

tion of his realm by expanding the forest (notably toward

Everlund) back to the banks of the Rauvin. Turlang does

not believe that hell be able to hold this reclaimed terri-

tory, and seldom attacks woodcutters working within it; to

him,  this  is  solely  a  defensive  tactic,  to  build  a  shield

around  the  true  wood  he  calls  his  own.  Humans  who  see

the  woods  advancing  like  a  silent  green  wall  tend  not  to

view this practice as defensive.

Turlang rules over a hundred treants with gentle but ab-

solute authority. He deploys sentry treants along the borders

of  his  realm.  Standing  still  and  silent,  mistaken  by  other

creatures for large, old trees, they watch for intruders. Hunt-

ers and forest beasts are left aloneonly beings who

cut  wood  or  awaken  flame  are  con-

fronted.  A  verge  of  about  a  quar-

ter-mile  in  depth  all  along  the

edge  of  the  forest  is  left  wild.

Shrubs,  thornbushes,  and  bram-

bles  are  encouraged  to  grow,

forming natural barriers to non-

woodland creatures, and foresters

are  free  to  cut  what  trees  do

manage  to  struggle  up  through

the clinging vines.

Alert intruders moving deeper

into the forest can detect the end

of this safe verge by the presence

of  lilypad-covered  forest  pools.

Treants  dig  these  pools  to  keep

water handy for firefighting, and

if  necessary  divert  water  by

means  of  taproots  from  else-

where  to  fill  them.  Sentry  tre-

ants will also roll on flames to

smother  them,  or  heap  loose

earth  atop  fires  and  then  call

up water to dampen the heaped

loam.  Sentries  prevent  all  cre-

ation of trails by stopping or cor-

rupting  attempts  to  make  blazes

or clear brush or trees.

Turlang the Treant

Within this defensive ring, Turlang governs

a  lush,  dimly  lit  forested  realm.  The  air  in  its  everpresent

tree-gloom  glows  blue.  This  weird  light  comes  from  amor-

phous,  mindless  and  slowly  ambulatory  luminescent  forest

floor  fungi,  and  from  glowing  moss  trailing  from  the

branches of dying trees. The treants carefully plant and tend

seedlings of all desired sorts of trees (everything nonparasitic

thats native to the High Forest). Turlang sees to it that rare

species are widely dispersed in forest ravines, so that no one

disaster or intruder attack can obliterate them.

Turlang  himself  meets  often  with  a  few  trusted  wood

elves and local hybsils, to keep abreast of events and doings

in the land around the High Forest. He trades gems and arti-

facts found in ancient human and elf forest-ruins for errands

and services. Turlang is otherwise quite tolerant of intruders,

and has even been known to visit adventurers campfires. He

puts  them  out,  of  course,  but  provides  glow-fungi  instead,

and trades forest tales for information about the intruders

intentions and current events in the world around. Turlang

is  forever  trying  to  corroborate  what  hes  heard  from  one

source, by querying others without revealing that hes com-

paring what he learns.

In  exchange  for  long  and  difficult  services  in  the  world

outside  his  wood,  Turlang  has  sometimes  healed  stricken

humans  and  other  humanoids  by  letting  them  drink  of

Turlangs Dew. The great treant is an accomplished druid,

and  caches  potions  of  cure  moderate  wounds,  neutralize

poison, remove disease, and other restorative spells in various

secret places in the forest.

At  least  six  of  the  senior  treants  of  Turlangs

Wood have augmented abilitiesnot as pow-

erful  as  the  Deeproot  himself,  but

stronger  than  most  treants.  They  are

Arauven,  Duthroan,  Eldrath,

Faelmeir, Houmril, and Raunthar.

THE UNICORN RUN

Claimed to be the most beautiful

place in Faern by those who have

seen  it,  this  river  (and  the  swath  of

huge, dark old trees and green glades along

its banks) is said by many druids to be the

sacred dancing ground or personal haunt

of several nature deities.

The  Unicorn  Run  is  a  clear,  pris-

tine,  slow-running  river.  Its  sweet

water is considered the very best

for use in medicines, magic po-

tions  and  processes,  healing

baths,  and  drinking.  Though

the water is not overtly magi-

cal,  something  attracts  uni-

corns  to  drink  from  the  Run.

Those  who  travel  along  the

banks of the Run say its gentle

waters provide superb fishing and

impart  serenity  unknown  else-

where, but few humans come here

brigands  imperil  the  southern  verges  of  the

High  Forest,  and  unfriendly  forest  creatures

lurk along the upper reaches of the river, if one strays away

from the sight and sound of its waters.

A  few  lucky  druids  venerating  Eldath,  Lurue,  Mielikki,

Shiallia,  or  Silvanus  have  had  visions  urging  them  to  visit

the  headwaters  of  the  Run,  known  as  the  Glade  of  Life.

Those who make such pilgrimages may receive divine guid-

ance  here,  charging  them  with  a  holy  mission,  such  as  re-

planting a wasteland to make it a forest once more.

The Ice Mountains

A  stark,  windswept  range  of  ice-clad  peaks,  glaciers,  and

barren,  rocky  valleys,  the  Ice  Mountains  are  reckoned  by

The Lay of the Land

as opposed to a mountain range in their own right. The dif-

ference is purely academic; both ranges share towering ram-

partlike peaks reaching 20,000 feet into the sky, permanent

snowpack at all but the lowest elevations, and infestations of

dangerous monsters.

While  the  Spine  of  the  World  (the  westerly  portion,

anyway)  generally  extends  for  a  greater  distance  and  has

more and higher peaks than the Ice Mountains, the weather

of the Ice Mountains is a thing of legend. Frigid winds howl

down  from  the  Endless  Ice  Sea  (north  of  the  Spine  of  the

World)  and  collide  here  with  the  unnatural  conditions  of

Anauroch. The chief result is windwind of a strength and

ferocity  unparalleled  anywhere  else  on  Faern.  On  a  clear

day,  plumes  of  ice  and  snow  twisting  away  from  the  high

peaks can be seen from a hundred miles away, wreathing the

mountains like smoke.

Some of the high valleys catch this endless blast, channel-

ing it through canyons and gorges scoured clean of snow and

gravel to nothing but bare black rock, in which no ground

cover higher than lichen can survive. In the worst gales, not

even the greatest and most powerful wyrms dare take wing,

and  nothing  that  goes  on  two  legsnot  even  a  full-grown

frost giantcan stand against the blast.

While the surface conditions of the Ice Mountains are in-

hospitable at best, their barren slopes and blasted vales con-

ceal  great  mineral  wealth.  Beneath  the  first  great  rampart

lies Citadel Adbar, the strongest dwarfhold of the North, a

foundry and armory for all the Silver Marches. Older, for-

gotten holds lie in the maze of mountains and passes beyond.

The  dwarves  who  delved  these  fortresses  are  long  gone,

driven out by monsters or simply dwindled away to nothing

in the long ages of the races decline, and dark, savage things

now lair in these frozen halls.

The Ice Spires

North of the Ice Mountains lie the Ice Spires, a range of per-

petually frozen peaks west of the High Ice of Anauroch and

south of the Endless Ice Sea. The Ice Spires are split into two

ranges,  separated  by  a  great  valley  of  frozen  plains,  pine

forests, and low, rolling hills. Hartsvale, a small kingdom of

humans, lies in this remote valley, surrounded by numerous

tribes of giants. Its said that the kings of this distant land

have  giants  blood  in  their  veins,  and  they  stand  against  a

great tribe of particularly clever and evil ogres.

The Lurkwood

This great forest is second only to the High Forest among

the woodlands of the North. Nestled at the feet of the Spine

of the World, it has a bad reputation in the lands nearby as a

forest hunted by fierce tribes of orcs, ettins, giants, and other

creatures  of  the  mountains.  The  reputation  is  largely  de-

served,  although  the  southern  verge  of  the  forest  is  safe

enough  to  attract  woodcutters,  trappers,  and  hunters  from

Mirabar, Nesm, and Longsaddle.

Several Uthgardt tribes roam large tracts of the forest

principally the Elk, Griffon, and Sky Pony tribes. One other

tribe hunts these lands, too. In the eastern Lurkwood, hard

under the hills climbing toward the Fell Pass, the Gray Wolf

Uthgardt hold sway. These feral barbarians have earned the

fear  and  respect  of  the  other  denizens  of  the  woodlands.

Small Gray Wolf encampments can be found throughout the

North, but in the Lurkwood a clan of more than fifty of the

lycanthropes are gathered together. They do not welcome in-

truders in their hunting grounds.

River Surbrin

The  northernmost  tributary  of  the  River  Dessarin  links

Waterdeep  and  the  towns  of  the  Dessarin  with  the  great

cities  of  the  Silver  MarchesSilverymoon,  Everlund,  and

Sundabarvia  the  River  Rauvin.  The  Surbrin  rises  in  the

high valleys of the Spine of the World, born of the glacier

pack known as the Endless Ice Sea.

The Surbrin was formerly bridged at Nesm, although the

Nesm bridge has been destroyed. The river is navigable to

the point where it meets the Rauvin, northeast of Nesm. At

the  junction  of  the  Rauvin  and  Surbrin  rivers  stands  the

town of Rivermoot, a tiny settlement protected on two sides

by the rivers and on the third by a stout palisade. While the

location is defensible, it is subject to destructive spring flood-

ing, and most of the buildings stand on stout pilings 10 feet

or more above the ground. Rivermoot is considered part of

Silverymoons lands.

The Spine of the World

Famous  in  Faernian  lore  as  an  endless,  unbreachable

wall  of  frigid  peaks,  the  Spine  of  the  World  marks  the

end  of  the  mortal  world.  All  bards  except  the  few  who

have  actually  visited  the  Frozenfar  (the  lands  around

Icewind  Dale)  claim  that  theres  nothing  north  of  the

Spine but the Endless Ice Sea.

Nothing,  they  say,  can  survive  in  this  wind-scoured,

frozen  waste  of  razor-sharp  waves  of  black  ice.  To  fare

across it requires great magicand those who do will find

their deaths in the white mists that lie beyond. Some sages

claim  that  white  dragons  lurk  among  the  mists,  while

others warn of amorphous, cloudlike vampiric predators.

Whatever  the  true  perils,  all  agree  that  no  mortal  has

ever successfully crossed the Realm of Mists to reach the

Realms of the Gods beyond.

Those  who  have  collected  firsthand  knowledge  of  the

mountains  instead  of  knowledge  gleaned  from  bard  tales

and sage mumblings know that the Spine of the World is a

range  of  eternally  snow-capped,  high  and  rugged  moun-

tains.  In  most  places,  the  range  stands  about  three  peaks

thick,  though  the  more  northerly  peaks  are  choked  in  ice

and  may  seem  mere  tors  or  needles  of  rock  to  someone

flying  past.  Icy  winds  howl  endlessly  among  them,  and

their flanks are prone to shed huge masses of rock. Locals

refer  to  this  as  when  the  mountains  stir  because  such

rockfalls are more like plunging hammer-blows than land-

slides. The rockfalls, the severe weather, and frequent mon-

ster raids combine to keep the lands just south of the Spine

sparsely settled.

There are lands of interest north of the Spine, Icewind

32

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 33

The Lay of the Land

Dale in particularand there are many ways through the

wall  of  mountains  to  reach  these  lands  of  the  Frozenfar.

All  such  routes  are  dangerous,  and  most  involve  delving

into  some  of  the  many  abandoned  dwarfholds  that  riddle

the peaks of the Spine. A few of these monster-haunted un-

derways  hide  tunnels  that  pierce  through  the  Spine,  to

reach the cold lands beyond.

Some of the mines in the Spine of the World were aban-

doned because their ore ran out, but most were vacated by

dwarves who died or fled in persistent monster attacks. The

mountains still hold possibly the richest veins of metal in

all  Faern  (witness  the  wealth  of  the  Mines  of  Mirabar),

but  are  also  home  to  monsters  galore.  Countless  tribes  of

giants, hobgoblins, orcs, bugbears, and goblins dwell in the

Spine,  holding  every  last  cavern  or  former  dwarf  delve

except those claimed as lairs by dragons. Hill giants roam

the mountain slopes, and the peaks and frozen high valleys

are  home  to  frost  giants  and  white  dragons,  while  fog

giants are common in the Lands Against the Wall and the

moors directly south of those forests.

The few intrepid adventurers who have penetrated to the

heart  of  the  Spine  of  the  World  spread  tales  that  the  ice

today  preserves  the  abandoned  ruins  of  what  seem  to  be

human cities, as well as the lairs of frozen dragons. In other

places,  stranger  creatures,  both  large  and  small,  are  frozen

forever in the icesome perched or standing, as if the cold

claimed them in mid-stride.

THOLVARR

Many  high  passes  in  the  mountain  range  are  walled  off

with  ice.  Most  of  the  icy  barriers  are  natural,  but  some,

particularly to the west of the headwaters of the Surbrin,

are  the  creations  of  frost  giants.  At  least  six  frost  giant

tribes, plus a dozen or so small outcast or rebel families, in-

habit the coldest, loftiest mountain peaks and vales. They

refer  to  the  area  they  inhabit  as  Tholvarr  (literally,  our

place in an ancient giant dialect), but its not a kingdom.

The  tribes  (the  Arthlarr,  the  Borumn,  the  Joront,  the

Klevvyn, the Turtorst, and the Yargray) have traditionally

feuded and fought each other.

A  capable  heir  has  arisen  in  one  tribe,  however,  who

plans  greater  things.  Gerti  Orelsdottr  (CE  female  frost

giant  Clr5  of  Auril/Rnc4;  see  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS

Campaign Setting), a devout cleric of Auril, has been teach-

ing the spells and the creed of the Frostmaiden to clerics

in  other  tribes,  and  thereby  gaining  great  popularity.

When her aging father Orel the Grayhand dies, Gerti will

become  jarl  of  the  Yargray  tribe  unless  a  few  hostile  old

warriors manage to arrange an accident to befall her. Gerti

dreams  of  a  council  of  jarls,  where  the  clerics  she  has

trained  could  work  magic  together  to  bring  a  winter  of

storms  to  the  Northand  extend  the  power  of  the  frost

giants far into the south. Clerics from all the major tribes

support  her  in  this  dream  of  conquest,  but  some  of  the

older  giant  warriors  see  the  rise  of  Aurils  power  among

their shamans and clerics as an insidious threat, and con-

sider ways to secure their own positions against Gerti and

her followers.

THE LANDS AGAINST THE WALL

The foothills along the Spine of the World consist of many-

ridged,  rocky  pine  forests  such  as  the  Druarwood,  broken

only by many small, narrow lakes known as talons because

of  their  shape.  Wild  deer  of  great  size  roam  here  in  vast

herds, preyed upon by hobgoblins, orcs, and the hardy, war-

like  Uthgardt  tribes.  Named  settlements,  permanent  struc-

tures,  roads  and  civilization  are  all  absent  here;  the  only

trails to be found are left by the herds of deer.

These  days,  very  few  adventurers  who  venture  close  to

the great wall of mountains are ever heard from again. Orcs

and other marauders hunt them as skillfully and doggedly

as any hunter has ever pursued prized game. Orc patrols are

now  very  numerous  in  the  Lands  Against  the  Wall,  espe-

cially in bands (or warfists) of veterans answering to King

Obould himself. A warfist usually consists of thirty veterans

shepherding a dozen or so green tuskers. They know the ter-

rain, are well armed, and are reckless in their bold eagerness

to slay. Most of the veterans are skilled archers, and in any

fray, a few of them hang back in hiding to observe. If the

patrol is wiped out, these hidden eyes flee to report back on

such formidable intruders.

DARK ARROW KEEP

After his defeat at the hands of Emerus Warcrown in the

Citadel  of  Many  Arrows,  Obould  Many-Arrows  led  a  few

hundred  of  his  toughest,  most  experienced  warriors  to  this

lonely  hold  in  the  high  vales  of  the  Spine  of  the  World.

Unlike many other castles and towers in these bitter moun-

tains, Dark Arrow Keep was raised by slave-driving orcs, who

built  a  fortress  to  stand  against  their  numerous  enemies.

While the original builders of the keep are long gone, wiped

out in some forgotten battle or another, the keep remains.

Obould and his warriors drove out the giants who occupied it,

and set about fortifying and repairing the old castle in a fu-

rious burst of effort.

Obould  (CE  male  orc  Bbn5/Ftr4;  see  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign Setting) named his new seat Dark Arrow

Keep.  It  may  not  be  as  well-made  as  a  good  bit  of  dwarf-

work,  but  what  it  lacks  in  craftsmanship  it  makes  up  for

with massive weights of stone, blind alleys, crude traps, and

confounding  corridors  raked  by  hidden  arrow  slits.  From

this  fortress  Obould  carefully  gathers  his  strength  for  his

next taskthe unification of the orcs of the mountains be-

neath  his  banner.  Obould  blames  the  loss  of  the  Citadel  of

Many  Arrows  not  on  a  few  short,  bearded  fools  (oppor-

tunistic  dwarves),  but  rather  on  the  huge  orc  horde  that

swept down to besiege him. That horde shattered the citadel

gates and sapped the strength of Oboulds defenders before

the dwarves attacked.

Another such horde is now building, and Obould is wait-

ing  for  it  to  burst  forth  and  shatter  the  battle-might  of

the  Silver  Marches  before  sending  his  own  Army  of

Arrows into the fray. He plots to regain the citadel and

the lands around, but is determined not to be overwhelmed

by this new horde, or by the allied armies and magic of the

Silver Marches.

Although  hes  determined  to  sit  on  a  throne  in  Many

Arrows once more before he dies, Obould dreams of ruling

33

620_088567_001_EN_Ch1a.qxd  4/26/02  1:48 PM  Page 34

The Lay of the Land

Silverymoon itself. If his tuskers can conquer all the lands

north  of  the  Rauvin,  that  might  be  enough  territory  to

divide among his eight restless sonsand keep them from

each  others  throats  long  enough  that  an  orc  empire,

Obouldar,  might  be  born.  Obould  only  hopes  he  can  keep

his oldest, fiercest spawn, Scrauth, and his brothers Araug

and  Brymoel,  from  raising  blades  against  him  while  he

waits  for  the  rising  (and  passing)  of  the  horde.  His  ener-

getic patrols are one way to keep his sons busy and to keep

most  of  his  warriors  well  away  from  their  whispering

tongues and ready bribes.

Every  day  Oboulds  skull-adorned,  horned  throne  seems

less solid under him, and with each passing month his spies

mutter of new treacheries and strange happenings among his

people. Rage and restlessness are growing in the Master of

Many  Arrows,  and  soon  it  will  be  time  for  a  bold  stroke,

horde or no. Soon he will have to be seen to do something de-

cisive,  or  murmurings  of  his  cowardice  and  weakness  will

arise around every Dark Arrow campfire.

Dark Arrow Keep is home to nearly two thousand of the

forty-five  hundred  orcs  under  Oboulds  rule.  The  orcs  who

dont live in or around Dark Arrow Keep dwell in caverns

and fortified mountain villages nearby, mustering warriors

at Oboulds command.

Oboulds chief advisor is the shaman of the Dark Arrows,

an  adept  of  Gruumsh.  Always  black-robed,  she  glides

through the orc-held caverns, a tall, close-lipped, and men-

acing figure. The warriors and common orcs fear and hate

her, but no one dares attack Lorog because the orcs fear the

wrath of Gruumsh, because she holds the power to heal, and

because  Lorog  always  carries  poisoned  throwing  daggers,

which she never hesitates to use. She favors large scorpion

venom and blue whinnis.

Lorog sees Obould as a great orc leader and the best hope

for the spread and rise in power of his people and of Gru-

umsh. She is careful to support him in all things, while in

truth looking out for herself first. With Oboulds permis-

sion, she tests and tries to awe and frighten every promis-

ing orc warrior of the tribe, threatening them with the dire

doom of Gruumshs disfavor if they betray their tribe or

king. Secretly, shes judging which of these future officers

in Oboulds army she can best controland hence, which

shell support as his successor if he should fall.

Lorog spends her time skulking among the Dark Arrows

orcs, making sure they see her keeping watch over them all.

She  also  likes  to  eavesdrop  unseen,  to  hear  what  theyre

really thinkingand to capture any hint of magical treasure

being  found.  Desire  for  more  magical  power  is  a  burning

hunger in her. Lorog and Obould dont trust each other, yet

they work together as if they doeach watching and waiting

for the time when the other will try to betray him or her.

The Underdark

Some  of  the  greatest  perils  to  the  cities  of  the  Silver

Marches lie not in the orc outposts of the distant north, or

the dangerous sands of Anauroch, but a mere mile or

two below the surface. The North is riddled with

the  caverns  of  the  Underdark,  a  realm  so

dark and dire that only a handful of sur-

face  adventurers  have  ever  returned  to

carry  tales  of  its  weird  civilizations  and

unnamed terrors.

unaware  of)  even  the  most  destructive  intrusions  into  its

body. However, Underdark explorers whisper that this is not

always the case. The Great Fungus possesses terrible weapons

should it choose to use themdeadly poisons, mobile mani-

festations similar to various ooze and slime monsters, insidi-

ous spores to dominate invaders, and molds that animate the

skeletal remains of the creatures they cling to. Some say that

the titanic creature possesses unimaginable psionic power and

is  capable  of  destroying  the  minds  and  wills  of  all  but  the

strongest creatures.

BLINGDENSTONE

For uncounted years a bulwark of good in the otherwise evil

Underdark, Blingdenstone was a city of the deep gnomes, or

svirfneblina  furtive,  cautious  folk  who  carefully  avoided

conflict  with  their  darker  and  more  powerful  neighbors.

Abandoning  their  careful  ways,  the  gnomes  allied  with

Mithral Hall when the dwarfhold came under attack

from  the  drow  city  of  Menzoberranzan  and

played  an  instrumental  role  in  defeating  the

drow onslaught. In doing so, they earned the

cold hatred of the great drow city and sealed

their own doom.

Entrances  to  the  Underdark  abound

in  the  Silver  Marches.  Many  of  the

dwarfholds,  both  occupied  and  aban-

doned,  feature  deep  descending  passages,

rifts,  or  staircasessome  thousands  of

feet longjoining the surface to the Un-

derdark.  Forgotten  portals  in  and  around

the  ruins  of  Old  Delzoun,  Eaerlann,  and

Netheril  also  link  otherwise  inaccessible

reaches  of  the  Underdark  with  lonely  sites

on  the  surface.  Drow,  duergar,  derro,  il-

lithids, and other deep-earth races use these

points  of  access  to  raid  the  surface  from

time  to  time.  Few  dare  to  pursue  such

raiders  back  into  the  endless,  monster-

haunted gloom of their homes.

ARAUMYCOS

Beneath  the  High  Forest  lies  a  great  and

terrible secret. Once the dwarves of old Am-

marindar delved deeply beneath the forest, held

at that time by the elf kingdom of Eaerlann, but now

their  mines  and  hold  are  overgrown  by  the  colossal  entity

known  as  Araumycosa  single  great  fungus  extending

through caverns and mines from one end of the High Forest

to the other.

Lorog

In 1371 DR, the Year of the Unstrung

Harp, the matrons of six of Menzober-

ranzans great houses set aside their dif-

ferences to take revenge on the gnomes

of Blingdenstone. Through the casting of

planar  ally  spells  (and  planar  binding

spells, cast by male wizards and sorcerers at

the  matrons  direction),  a  veritable  horde

of  bebilith  demons  was  conjured  and  loosed

on the gnome city. Behind these fiendish shock

troops,  silent  and  deadly  columns  of  drow

warriors  burrowed  in  to  complete  the  de-

struction.  Blingdenstones  population  was

virtually eradicated. Of the twelve thousand

gnomes inhabiting the city, less than three

thousand  avoided  death  or  enslavement.

Those who survived fled the city with little

more than the clothes on their backs.

The largest of these refugee bands num-

bered  about  five  hundred.  They  traveled  east

and climbed toward the surface, eventually reaching

a little-traveled region of the Underdark in the vicin-

ity of Silverymoon, where they settled. This small village is

governed by Burrow Warden Krieger (CG male deep gnome

Ftr5/Ill7), the highest-ranking svirfneblin known to have

escaped the sack and ruin of Blingdenstone.

Small sections of Araumycos are susceptible to all types of

physical  attacks,  and  can  be  easily  destroyed  by  acid,  fire,

poison, and other such means. The stuff stubbornly returns

sooner or later. Cuttings from the fungus do not survive in

other  areas;  it  seems  to  have  reached  its  greatest  possible

extent  and  no  longer  advances  through  the  Underdark.

From time to time, large growths of Araumycos wither and

decay, revealing ancient caverns and ruins long covered by

the fungus.

Araumycos is generally passive or quiescent, ignoring (or

THE DARKLAKE

This  vast  series  of  water-filled  caverns  lies  beneath  the

Evermoors.  Long  ago,  cascades  and  swift  torrents  joined

these caves together as water drained down from the Ever-

moors  to  unknown  depths  below,  but  the  dwarves  of  Am-

marindar built a series of dams and locks here in order to

clear  a  path  of  dry  caverns  for  travel.  These  old  dwarf-

works still function today.

The  upper  reaches  of  the  Darklake  are  home  to  many

strange  and  dangerous  aquatic  creatures,  including  scrags

(aquatic trolls), kapoacinths (aquatic gargoyles), and the oc-

casional kraken. More than one boat laden with trade goods

has been lost in these waters to monstrous attacks.

THE FARDRIMM

Consisting of most of the Underdark territory between Men-

zoberranzan and Anauroch, the Fardrimm rambles beneath

most  of  the  surface  region  known  as  Old  Delzoun.  At  the

height of the dwarf kingdoms strength, these deep tunnels

were  the  hidden  highways  of  the  land,  linking  the  great

citadels together as surely as the sea links the great ports of

the coast to each other.

With the fall of Delzoun and the centuries-long retreat of

dwarf  power  in  the  North,  most  of  the  Fardrimm  has  re-

turned  to  darkness  and  shadows.  Many  old  dwarf-delves,

strongholds,  hidden  armories,  and  great  temples  lie  forgot-

ten in these depths. Dwarf patrols from Citadel Adbar and

Citadel Felbarr keep a wary eye on the immediate surround-

ings of each city, and from time to time well-armed caravans

sally forth to trade with Underdark races willing to engage

in commerce.

GRACKLSTUGH

On the southwest shore of the Darklake stands the duergar

city  of  Gracklstugh,  the  City  of  Blades.  This  great,  dismal

warren is filled with the reek and smoke of foundries and ar-

mories. Gracklstugh is the capital of a duergar realm known

as the Deepkingdom, a powerful Underdark nation that con-

trols  the  tunnels  and  caverns  for  dozens  of  miles  around.

The  gray  dwarves  possess  one  of  the  largest  and  best-

equipped  armies  in  the  North,  surface  or  subsurface,  but

they  are  generally  content  to  defend  their  own  borders

while  pursuing  wealth  through  industry  and  trade  with

other Underdark cultures.

The city of Gracklstugh is currently undergoing a period

of severe civil unreast; the old king Tarngardt Steelshadow

has just passed away. Tarngardt was quite old, but many of

the leading lairds (high nobles) of the city suspect that his

passing was unnaturally hastened by the Crown Prince Hor-

gar  Steelshadow  (LE  male  duergar  Ftr9/Wiz9).  The  derro

savants who formerly ruled the city through the careful con-

trol of the king and the lairds have found that their subtle

exercise of power no longer suffices to shape the course of

events in the city. Horgar Steelshadow is quietly working to

win the support of duergar princes long under the control of

the  savants,  shaking  off  the  whispers  and  charms  of  the

citys  secret  masters.  Horgar  is  considering  whether  or  not

the council of savants can be quickly and quietly made to dis-

appear.  At  the  same  time,  the  savants  are  plotting  the  re-

moval of the Crown Prince in order to reassert their control

over the city.

MENZOBERRANZAN

The City of Spiders may be the greatest danger facing the

Silver  Marches  today.  While  the  drow  of  Menzoberran-

zan lack the sheer numbers of the orcs

and  humanoids  of  the

The Lay of the Land

World, or the raw power of a great wyrm like Klauth, vir-

tually  every  major  settlement  in  the  North  lies  within

their reach. Secret tunnels, trackless spiderwebs of caverns

and  passages,  and  old  portals  riddle  the  Underdark  for

many  miles  around  Menzoberranzan,  offering  ready

egress to drow scouts, spies, assassinsor armies. The exis-

tence  of  Menzoberranzan  and  the  threat  it  poses  to  the

surface  world  is  one  of  the  primary  reasons  behind  the

creation of the confederacy of the Silver Marches. Sund-

abar, Everlund, Silverymoon, and the great dwarf citadels

are  united  in  their  opposition  to  the  evil  realm  beneath

their feet.

Menzoberranzan lies beneath the upper vale of the Sur-

brin, between the Moonwood and the Frost Hills. It is close

to Blingdenstone, Mithral Hall, and the northern shores of

the Darklake. The city occupies a great cavern more than

two miles across and nearly a thousand feet in height. Tow-

ering  stalagmites  and  pillars  rise  from  the  floor  of  the

cavern, some hundreds of feet in height. With centuries of

painstaking work the drow have transformed these features

into  darkly  beautiful  spired  castles  carved  from  the  very

rock. Ledges and plateaus break up the cavern floor, sepa-

rating  the  drow  noble  houses  (whose  homes  are  found  on

the higher ledges) from the vast sprawl of the city and its

weird mushroom forests.

Menzoberranzan  boasts  a  population  of  more  than

thirty  thousand  sentient  creatures.  Drow  only  comprise

about  one-half  of  this  number.  Most  of  the  rest  are

slavesmainly  bugbears,  goblins,  kobolds,  ogres,  orcs,

minotaurs, quaggoths, and trolls. The smaller and weaker

of  these  slaves  perform  the  drudge-work  of  the  city  and

tend the surrounding mushroom-fields and roth pastures.

Larger  and  more  powerful  creatures  serve  as  slave-sol-

diers, vast levies of hulking brutes who form the bulk of a

drow  army.  Finally,  a  large  number  of  svirfneblin  cap-

tives  taken  in  the  sack  of  Blingdenstone  form  the  most

wretched caste of thralls in Menzoberranzan.

The  drow  are  quite  clever  in  playing  off  slave  races

against each other, using the bugbears and ogres as overseers

to keep the goblins and orcs in line, and in turn setting the

minotaurs and trolls over the bugbears and ogres. Disobedi-

ent  or  rebellious  slaves  are  killed  in  spectacularly  horrible

ways, and savage reprisals inflict similar fates on many of

their  fellowswhich  means  that  the  slaves  themselves

quickly smother most outbreaks of resistance to make sure

no  drow  ever  has  cause  to  order  such  reprisals.  The  drow

have quietly made it clear that no indignity or violence is

too great for the survivors of Blingdenstone, and the deep

gnomes are faring very badly indeed as slaves of the drow.

The  matrons  of  the  leading  noble  houses  rule  Menzo-

berranzan. Most of these are clerics of Lolth, since priest-

esses  of  the  Spider  Queen  have  long  held  the  highest

positions  in  drow  society.  Triel  Baenre  (CE  female  drow

Clr17 of Lolth) is the matron of House Baenre, the fore-

most of the houses of Menzoberranzan. House Baenre for-

merly  had  a  much  stronger  position  in  the  city,  but  the

disastrous  failure  of  the  attack  on  Mithral  Hall  and  the

death  of  Triels  mother  Yvonnel,  an  old  and  crafty  drow

who  exercised  her  power  with  complete  ruthlessness,

greatly  weakened  House  Baenres  eminence  in  the  city.

Triel Baenre must carefully court, intimidate, and bluff the

matrons of the lesser houses to maintain her position. Last

years  vengeful  strike  against  Blingdenstone  originated  in

Triels  desire  to  secure  her  position  by  leading  Menzo-

berranzan to victory against an external foe.

Due  to  the  chaotic  and  evil  nature  of  the  drow  and

Lolths  rule  through  her  priestesses,  the  great  houses  of

Menzoberranzan  spend  much  of  their  time  scheming

against each other. Pulling together to launch a major war

of  aggression  is  difficult  for  the  matron  mothers,  and

Triel is hesitant to call for another crusade. If her rivals

decide  to  oppose  her,  or  even  sabotage  the  war  effort

through  subtle  mismanagement  or  willful  disobedience,

she might precipitate Baenres final fall. In the meantime,

Menzoberranzan  bides  its  time  and  rebuilds  its  strength,

engaging  in  commerce  with  nearby  Underdark  powers.

Travelers from other settlements, or even the surface, can

expect  a  cool  welcome  in  Menzoberranzanso  long  as

they  come  to  trade,  stay  well  clear  of  noble  drow,  and

manage to show that they are not easy prey for the citys

slavers or monsters.

YATHCHOL

South of the Nether Mountains lies a realm of the chitines, a

cluster of tangled warrens and web-villages known as Yath-

chol.  Most  of  the  settlements  number  between  forty  and

sixty  chitines,  ruled  by  anywhere  from  three  to  six  chol-

driths. The chitines have carefully charmed and trained car-

rion crawlers to help guard their homes, as well as clean up

the remnants of chitine meals. Yathchol lies close to another

drow  city  known  as  Ched  Nasad,  the  City  of  Shimmering

Webs.  The  chitines  were  formerly  enslaved  by  the  nearby

drow,  but  the  drow  found  that  the  chitines  made  for  poor

slaves and drove out the chitines almost seventy years ago.

37

620_088567_001_EN_Ch2a.qxd  4/26/02  1:49 PM  Page 38

With that in mind, this chapter provides a glimpse into

how wilderness features, travel, scenery, and encounters can

take center stage in a campaign.

Animals and Plants

The rugged terrain of the Silver Marches provides a tremen-

dous variety of environments for the animals and plants of

the  area.  The  sheltered  vales  of  the  Surbrin  and  Rauvin

rivers are warmer, sunnier, and generally far more temper-

ate than the high passes of the Nether or Ice mountains. The

North  is  dominated  by  great  forests,  high  meadows  and

moors,  and  windswept  peaks.  Well  watered  by  year-round

rainfall and spring snowmelts, these lands can be more hos-

pitable  than  the  cold  temperatures  and  unforgiving  winds

might otherwise suggest.

Flora

For centuries the North has yielded timber for warmer set-

tled lands, and yet much of it still seems the same as it has

always beena land entirely cloaked in trees except where it

rises to snow-cloaked, rocky heights. In truth, phandars are

growing rare due to overcutting, and nowhere accessible in

the  North  can  one  find  the  gigantic  trees  common  only

three centuries ago.

The damp, cool climate and increased woodcutting have

helped to keep forest fires fewer and smaller than in previ-

ous years. Consequently, great dark forests still meet the eye

everywhere in the North. All manner of cold-loving plants

grow in profusion in the Sword Coast North, from horsetails

to lichens, but the low and small are easily overlooked when

trees soar skyward on all sides.

TREES

Various spruces and pines are the most common trees of the

Silver Marches. Most deciduous trees do not fare well except

in  the  lower  and  more  southerly  regions,  although  felsuls

can survive in surprisingly cold and rocky conditions.

Much of the North is lightly settled at best.

Travelers in many portions of the Silver

Marches spend days between towns or vil-

lages,  camping  in  sheltered  dells  or  the

stone ruins that dot these lands. Its more than one hundred

fifty miles from Silverymoon to Sundabar through the Sil-

verymoon  Pass,  a  journey  of  a  tenday  on  foot,  sometimes

two in bad weather. A traveler can expect to spend the night

indoors no more than three or four times during that trip

at the village of Khelb on the western edge of the pass, at the

watchtower in the center of the pass, at the village of Au-

vandell,  and  at  a  sturdy  walled  inn  called  the  Sign  of  the

Three Heroes, about halfway between Auvandell and Sund-

abar.  Even  at  that,  the  road  through  Silverymoon  Pass  is

considered a well-used track, compared to some of the true

wilderlands found in the Marches.

Adventurers setting out for some of the more remote sites

in and around the Silver Marches (the dungeons of the Fell

Pass, the vine-covered crypts of the Far Forest, or the buried

ruins of Anauroch, for instance) must resign themselves to

tendays  of  hard  travel  through  difficult  terrain.  Impene-

trable forests, unfordable rivers, and unclimbable mountains

confuse or discourage all but the most knowledgeable and de-

termined  travelers.  Dangerous  predators,  both  natural  and

unnatural,  lie  in  wait.  Bandits,  barbarians,  and  marauders

could  erupt  from  hiding  to  ambush  unwary  travelers.  Ex-

tremes of weather and terrain can weaken, injure, or even kill

the  unprepared.  In  areas  far  removed  from  the  safety  of

walled cities and patrolled roads, the Silver Marches and the

lands about can be a dangerous place to wander.

Exploring the Wilds

As one ventures south from the frigid mountains to the

River Rauvin, hardwoods steadily increase in numbers. The

most plentiful are blueleaf, duskwood, and shadowtop trees

(blueleaf  and  shadowtop  are  described  in  the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign  Setting).  Oaks  and  maples  also  appear,

giving way to birches and silverbarks in swampy areas. From

the  Rauvin  southward,  more  deciduous  species  appearno-

tably  ash,  chestnut,  hiexel,  ironwood,  laspar,  and  phandar.

Some foresters say almost every type of tree that doesnt re-

quire baking sun or bears juicy edible fruit can be found in

the  North,  if  one  looks  long  enough.  Details  of  the  most

plentiful or important species follow.

Duskwood: Named for the dark, eerie appearance of their

closely clustered stands, duskwoods grow arrow-straight up to

60 feet tall. Their smooth, bare, trunks are crowned by halos

of tiny, lacy branches. Duskwoods have black bark that turns

silvery gray when newly broken or peeled. The wood beneath

is smoky gray, and hard as iron.

Most  mast  spars  and  building  roof-beams  in  Faern  are

made  of  duskwood.  It  is  very  resistant  to  fire,  smoldering

rather  than  blazing.  Duskwood  trees  tend  to  survive  both

forest fires and the axes of firewood-seekers because of this.

Duskwood grows widely all over Faern.

Felsul: A poor excuse for a tree is the common judge-

ment of the felsul. Most folk agree when they first examine

these  gnarled,  twisted  trees  of  a  dusty  cinammon  hue  that

constantly  shed  flakes  of  rotting  bark.  Felsul-wood  readily

crumbles,  splits,  cracks,  burns  poorly,  and  is  too  weak  and

misshapen to be usable in building or furniture making.

Early each spring, felsuls burst briefly into bloom. A sack

of vivid yellow-and-purple felsul flowers fetches from 5 to

30  silver  pieces,  depending  on  the  size  and  lushness  of  the

blossoms in any particular year. The crushed petals of felsul

flowers  yield  an  expensive  perfume  prized  throughout

Faern.  Felsul-root  is  sometimes  favored  for  use  in  small

carvings such as holy symbols, figurines, and toys.

Felsuls favor cold and poor soil, and grow on crags, cliff-

edges, and clefts where few other trees can find purchase. In

many rocky places in the North, felsuls are the only trees to

be seen.

Hiexel: Upright oval trees usually 30 feet in height, hiex-

els can grow 70 feet tall in sheltered spots. They have gently

curved,  sparse  branches;  brittle,  green,  waxy  wood  (called

simply  hiexel);  and  silver-green  bark.  Hiexel  rots  easily

and produces profuse amounts of thick, oily smoke when ig-

nited.  This  brings  it  frequent  use  in  signal  fires  and  for

smoking meat or fish, or to drive beasts or foes out of an en-

closed  area.  Hiexel  bark  sees  use  in  bookbinding.  Its  also

used  to  seal  the  walls  of  wooden  buildings  against  damp,

stuck  down  with  wooden  pegs  and  sealed  with  mud  and

clumps of moss.

As  they  grow,  hiexel  trees  dry  out  unevenly,  so  wind-

storms often fell old or large specimens. Hiexel is unsuitable

for  sledges,  bridges,  and  other  hard  usages.  It  shouldnt  be

used  in  magic  items,  because  its  unstable  nature  will  cause

breakage after a few years at most.

Hiexel  trees  are  very  common  in  the  Dales,  growing  in

thickets  in  ravines  and  on  hillsides.  They  are  rarer  in  the

North, but can be found scattered there everywhere south of

the  Nether  Mountains,  particularly  in  the  Rauvin  and

Delimbiyr vales.

Laspar: Evergreens of a distinctive olive-green hue, las-

pars are sometimes mistakenly thought to be dead by pass-

ing travelers. Laspars look like squat cedars, rarely topping

30  feet  in  height,  and  have  thick  foliage  that  foils  most

searching eyes seeking to see under a single tree, let alone a

stand of them.

Laspar needles are flat and smooth-pointed. They grow in

spherical clusters (shags) at the ends of delicate branches

that swirl around a straight, strong central trunk. The trunks

have dusty green bark that tends to form a surface of many

small, interlocked concave plates. Under the bark is a golden-

hued wood thats as easily worked as pinebut is also pitchy,

spitting too many sparks for safe burning.

Crushed needles are used in making scents and are often

worked into torches and candles of superior quality. Laspars

grow  everywhere  west  of  Thay  thats  also  north  of  the

Forest  of  Tethir.  They  thrive  around  Turnstone  Pass,  and

down Delimbiyr Vale into the Far Forest.

Phandar: Phandars grow up to 60 feet high, with terrifi-

cally strong, springy curving boughs sprouting in great num-

bers  from  a  massive,  knobbly  central  trunk.  Triangular

leaves of mottled, varicolored green grow on branches that

form the rough shape of a horizontal egg, with its long axis

(the  tail  of  the  tree)  pointing  away  from  the  prevailing

wind, so that a stand of phandars all seem to be pointing in

one  direction.  Some  adventurers  say  they  greatly  resemble

the feared monsters known as ropers.

Phandar wood is greenish-brown striped with thin black

grain  lines  throughout,  which  when  cut  for  use  in  the

making  of  jewelry  form  striking  waves  of  curling  parallel

lines.  Tool    and  weapon  handles  and  bows  are  often  fash-

ioned of phandar wood, though its curving nature makes it

unsuitable  for  spears,  wands,  staffs,  and  other  uses  where

straightness is desirable.

Phandars are very hardy. Stumps often grow new trees,

and  even  cut,  fallen  boughs  may  sprout  seedlings.  This

quality has probably saved the tree from total extinction;

loggers  prize  phandar  trunks  because  theyre  strong

enough to support the heaviest roof, and they can be chis-

eled  to  accept  crossbeams  without  cracking  or  splitting.

Phandars are found across Faern, but are sparse north of

the  High  Forest.  They  are  increasingly  rare  everywhere

due to overcutting.

Silverbark: Silverbarks are thin and straight, seldom more

than a dozen feet tall. They are plentiful, and grow in thick-

ets. Silverbark wood is reddish and dries out thoroughly after

its cut, becoming very light but also very brittle after a year

or so. The silver bark is loose and easily torn away. Silverbark

leaves are waxy to the touch, deep red in color, large and oval

with pointed tips and tiny saw-toothed edges. They are strong

enough to carry game or kindling in.

Silverbark trunks serve the poor as staffs, poles, and (once

points have been whittled and hardened in a slow fire) as de-

fensive stakes. The weakness of the wood makes it unsuitable

for lance shafts, fence rails, or structural work. Silverbarks

flourish in wet ground throughout Faern.

Exploring the Wilds

SHRUBS

Although trees are more noticed and valued than shorter

wilderland plants, the latter are more numerous, cloaking

almost  every slope of open country in  the North.  Many

of  these  are  dismissed  as  annoying  thornbushes,  from

berry  canes  to  the  strong  spiny  creeper  that  many  a

forester has cut into lengths as a temporary substitute for

rope. Others, such as the ferns and horsetails common to

shaded,  sandy  areas,  are  dismissed  as  simply  useless

(though again, foresters often use horsetails to scrub pots

and pans clean).

However, a few shrubs deserve closer examination because

of their utility or domination of the landscape. One of these,

helmthorn, is detailed in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting. Others are described below.

Groundpine:  These  stunted,  many-armed  pines  seldom

grow more than 1 foot high, but spread out in all directions

like  spiders  turned  on  their  backs,  in  the  words  of  one

forester.  A  hazard  underfoot  to  horses,  groundpines  cloak

many hilltops or moors downslope in the North, flourishing

where  biting  winds  blow  and  less  hardy  species  struggle.

Their cones feed many small birds and furry creatures, and

their needles offer cover for both predators and traps placed

to  harm  or  capture  humans.  As  with  certain  spruces,

groundpine bark can be boiled to derive a searing-cool sweet

drink that refreshes but doesnt intoxicate.

Thumberry: This globe-shaped shrub of lime-green, ragged

leaves is studded year-round with white berries the size and

shape  of  human  thumbs.  The  edible,  fatty  berries  can  be

shaped into candles and burned, and they have kept many a

lost or hungry traveler alive, although their taste wins few

accolades.  Thumberry-root  can  be  boiled  to  yield  a  potent

slate-gray dye or ink.

Winterberry: These tangled vines are dusty brown in hue

and constantly shed ragged strips of bark. They customarily

form  spherical  coils  that  bulk  as  large  as  bushes,  and  are

often  overgrown  by  lesser  creepers  so  as  to  look  quite  sub-

stantial.  Winterberries  shed  their  silver-gray  leaves  in  fall,

but only after persistent freezing weather has come do the

apparently bare and lifeless vines split apart to reveal waxy,

white, sour-sweet berries. Many birds and small forest crea-

tures (and more than one hungry, desperate human) depend

on winterberriesbecause they can be eaten frozen, and deer

hate their taste and so let them be.

HERBS AND GROUND PLANTS

So  many  edible  or  medicinally  useful  plants  grow  in  the

North that even expert herbalists seldom know them all, or

the full range of their uses. From lichens and mosses to wild-

flowers, broadleaves, and tubers, the wilderlands offer a rich

harvest of spices, ingredients for healing salves and draughts,

and drugs that deaden pain or give sleep.

Amaunauth  (rare):  Also  known  as  greenflower  for  its

rich  green  leaves,  which  open  in  a  starburst  close  to  the

ground,  amaunauth  is  a  hardy  broadleaf  groundweed.  It

grows  across  colder  areas  of  the  North,  from  the  Dessarin

Valley north to where ice or snow always lies. If eaten raw,

amaunauth  is  harmful  to  humans,  elves,  orcs  and  all  gob-

linkin,  and  their  half-kin,  but  has  no  effect  on  dwarves,

gnomes,  halflings,  fey  creatures,  and  gnolls,  nor  on  horses,

goats, sheep, roth, and deer.

The poison called amaunauth is brewed from the sap or

internal juices of the weed. An herbalist can concoct amau-

nauth  by  crushing  the  leaves  of  the  plant,  boiling  whole

plants, or even dissolving the leaves in alcohol (Alchemy or

Knowledge [herbalism] check, DC 15, and one days work to

manufacture). A single plant can produce 1d4+2 doses.

Amaunauth: Injury  DC  19,  initial  damage  2d4  hp,  sec-

ondary damage unconsciousness, price 100 gp.

Embramaph (common): A tall flowering plant with irreg-

ular  petals  of  rich  purple,  embramaph  grows  in  sunny  soil.

Embramaph is an antidote to many poisons, diseases, molds

and rots, but its effects vary for each individual. Its leaves and

stems, eaten or crushed and rubbed on the skin, are effective

throughout the year. Also known as fairflower because of its

beneficial effects, embramaph has almost no market value,

since it loses its potency within a day of being harvested.

A dose of embramaph confers a +4 bonus on Heal checks

made to treat poison or treat disease. A single embramaph

plant yields 1d4 doses.

Varathar (uncommon): Also known as moonglow for

the  pale  silver-blue  radiance  it  shows  in  moonlight,

varathar is a unattractive, rare ground cover that looks like

shredded, rotting brown mushrooms. A character may ad-

minister  a  dose  of  varathar  with  a  successful  Heal  check

(DC 10); a creature treated in this fashion is healed of 1d4

points of damage. The DC of the Heal check to administer

varathar increases by +10 per dose taken per day, making it

difficult for a creature to benefit more than once or twice a

day from varathar.

Varathar retains its potency for 1d4+1 days after harvest-

ing, and commands a market price of 10 gp per dose. A single

varathar plant normally yields 1d4 doses.

Searching for Herbs

Locating a particular herb is not as simple as strolling

into the woods and plucking flowers. Searching for herbs

requires  a  successful  Wilderness  Lore  or  Knowledge

(herbalism) check, depending on how common the herb

is in the immediate vicinity.

DC 10

Common

Uncommon DC 20

Rare

DC 30

Not present Impossible

Any  character  may  attempt  to  locate  herbs  with  a

Search  check,  but  only  if  the  DC  for  the  particular

herb is 10 or lower.

Each  attempt  requires  10  minutes  and  covers  the

ground in an area roughly 100 feet square. A character

with the nature sense ability (a druid, for example) only

requires 1 minute per attempt.

Exploring the Wilds

Fauna

The North is a place where many monsters live, but a hunter of

moderate skill can be sure of game for the spit or stewpot every

night.  Despite  the  harsh  conditions  of  much  of  the  Silver

Marches, its sparsely settled nature keeps its creature popula-

tion thriving. Many die under the claws and jaws of other mon-

sters or fall prey to the unforgiving cold, but many more are

born.  Of  large  predators,  only  dragons  seem  to  survive  for

longorcs grow to huge numbers, starve themselves out of the

mountains, and sweep down south in hordes that may wreak

great slaughter, but ultimately decimate the orc population.

This is a deadly but natural cycle; many species in harsh

climates flourish and then die off, only to rise again. There

are two notable distortions of the normal cycles and balance

of  life  in  the  Silver  Marches,  however.  Magical  links  with

other  worlds  and  planes  are  surprisingly  numerous  in  the

North, and strange beasts and deadly aberrations from other-

worldly  places  frequently  migrate  through  them.  Another

distortion is the monster production of wizards and others

who might breed beasts for their own nefarious purposes, as

well as creatures such as the deepspawn, who vomit forth end-

less streams of duplicates of creatures they once devoured.

Wise predators, such as dragons, use deepspawn in isolated

areasinaccessible  mountain  valleys  and  river  islands,  for

instanceto  give  themselves  an  endlessly  renewed  food

source. Other creatures place them as monster producers to

drive out or ward away foes.

COMMON CREATURES

From most to least plentiful, the most common beasts in the

North are deer, klantars (reindeer), shagguns (untamable bison-

like beasts), ghost roth, rabbits, boars, moose, elk, rock rats (egg-

thieving  lizardlike  rodents),  tree-cats  (climbing  felines  that

behave like squirrels), bears, berrygobblers (chipmunklike scur-

rying rodents), mountain rams, and red tigers. Beaver, weasels,

foxes, and field mice are also common, but less frequently seen

than in the years before humans farmed in the Marches.

Though they tend to be noticed less, birds far outnumber

the  beasts.  The  most  numerous  avians  are  vultures,  wild

turkeys, snow crows, ducks, geese, flurrs (grouse), hawks, and

the tiny, loud warbler known as the tereep after its call. There

are many songbirds and owls, but aside from the tereep, no

one species is noticeably more prevalent than others.

Insects, of course, outnumber all other forms of life, but

also tend to escape noticeexcept for the stinging sorts and

the  giant  varieties.  Only  giant  wasps  and  various  oversized

beetles are plentiful in the North, where strong winds, damp,

and chill temperatures keep insects from flourishing.

In the Marches as everywhere, vipers and other snakes are

most  often  found  sunning  on  rocks.  In  the  icy  streams,

rivers, and swamps of the North, reptilian life is almost un-

known.  On  dry  ground  there  are  small,  largely  harmless

snow snakes that can change their skin hue to either white or

the mottled gray-dun of rocks and dead grass, but the waters

are almost entirely given over to fish. Shalass, louts, flatgills,

and other plentiful species flourish in the Rauvin, Surbrin,

and smaller rivers of the area. Most hungry human travelers

know how to identify the bluefin and silverfin, and how to

throw a net into water and kindle a fire under a skillet.

MONSTERS

Of primary interest to most civilized folk are the infamous

monsters of the North. The wilderlands are one of the last

frontiers where predators of all strange sorts can roamand

the Marches provides attractive food sources for such beasts

to  raid.  Stirge  flocks,  owlbears,  and  wolves  are  all  still  too

numerous, but most folk fear far more the solitary perils of

beholders,  dragons,  and  frost  wormsor  werefolk  dwelling

Wyrms of the North

No roll of the dragons of the North can hope to encom-

pass all the dragons that set out to raid, plunder, or rule

in  Faern.  However,  most  sages  agree  that  the  most

prominent  dragons  active  in  the  Silver  Marches  and

Savage  Frontier,  aside  from  those  mentioned  elsewhere,

include the following.

Arauthator,  the  Old  White  Death: An  old  male  white

whose domain includes the headwaters of the Surbrin and

the Spine of the World.

Arveiaturace: Also  known  as  Iceclaws  or  the  White

Wyrm, an ancient female white whose domain is the Sea of

Moving Ice.

Claugiyliamatar: An  ancient  female  green  who  lairs

somewhere along the Sword Coast between the Mirar and

the Dessarin.

Felgolos, the Flying Misfortune: An accident-prone juve-

nile male bronze who roams freely throughout the North.

Hoondarrh, the Red Rage of Mintarn: An ancient male

red who sleeps often but raids the upper Delimbiyr Vale,

Nether Mountains, and Old Delzoun when hungry.

Insyzor:  A  venerable  male  fang  dracolich  who  lairs  at

the head of the Whitewater River in the Graypeak Moun-

tains  and  roams  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  Fallen

Lands. Reputed to possess fantastic wealth, garnered from

the ruins of the dwarf realm of Ammarindar.

Iymrith,  the  Doom  of  the  Desert: An  ancient  female

blue  who  lairs  near  Ascore  in  Anauroch  but  forages  into

Delimbiyr Vale, the Ice Mountains, and Turnstone Pass.

Nurvureem,  the  Dark  Lady: An  adult  female  shadow

dragon who poses as a human lady on a ruined manor north

of Amphail but raids the Dessarin and Delimbiyr valleys.

Olothontor,  the  Minstrel  Wyrm: A  music-loving  an-

cient  male  blue  dragon  who  chases  music  over  all  the

North.

undetected in towns and cities and preying on their human

neighbors by night.

Thanks to decades of ballads and tavern-tales, the drag-

ons  are  the  best-known  monsters  of  all.  In  the  Marches,

this is fitting. While many folk in the North have been de-

voured by awesome wyrms such as Klauth (described in the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting) and the Morueme

dragons, Silverymoon probably owes its growth and stabil-

ity to dragonstwo specific dragons, in fact.

The  ancient  female  gold  dragon  Valamaradace,  the  Dragon

Queen  of  Silverymoon,  and  her  adult  male  silver  consort

Deszeldaryndun, watched over Silverymoon long before Alustriel

came to the Rauvins bridge. Together the two dragons dwell in a

mist-shrouded  floating  mountain,  from  which  Valamaradace

rules  a  domain  that  she  tends  as  assiduously  as  any  avid  gar-

dener. She has weeded out blights, predators, and evil creatures

and  nurtured  growing  things,  making  it  possible  for  Silvery-

moon to survive when it was most vulnerable, despite orc hordes

and hungry dragons. Her efforts may have made Silverymoon

the center of arts, beauty, and commerce that it is today. The

Silver and Gold have been the citys best guardians for centuries.

Dragons and wyverns are a steadily diminishing problem in

the Silver Marches, except for adventurers bold enoughsome

say foolish enoughto go seeking their lairs. Thats due largely

to the efforts of the sons of Alustriel, who recently dedicated

themselves to scouring the Marches and the near wilderlands of

the most rapacious monsters. They often warn away dangerous

monsters instead of rashly attacking, and from time to time

the creature approached chooses not to try its strength against

the Silver Marches and moves on to plague some other land.

The  same  cant  be  said  for  the  sort  of  monsters  who

gather in bands and set to raid, plunder, and murder any in

their  path.  Trolls,  bugbears,  goblins,  and  orcs  are  the  most

numerous  of  these,  but  hobgoblins,  giants,  gnolls,  kobolds,

ettins, and even dragonkin raid the Silver Marches, and are

growing bolder and more numerous as fast as or faster than

the Marches gain wealth, inhabitants, territory, and military

might. Affairs are swiftly building toward widespread war.

Wilderness

Encounters

One of the defining characteristics of an adventure in the Silver

Marches or the lands nearby is the constant threat of running

into unexpected trouble in the form of dangerous animals, ma-

rauders,  or  monsters.  Most  mundane  predatorswolves,  red

tigers, brown bears, and the likeare inclined to avoid parties of

three or four humans or humanoids. However, someone isolated

from the main body of a party, such as an advance scout or a

straggler, could easily run afoul of such an animal.

Encounter Chance

As a party of characters travels across the Silver Marches, there

is a chance per hour of travel that they may run into a wilderness

encounter. The first percentage in each entry on the following

table is the chance of an encounter for a single hour of travel in

that type of terrain; the second percentage (in parentheses) is the

chance of a single encounter in 8 hours of travel in that terrain.

If the party does not change its mode of travel in the course of a

day  (from  normal  travel  to  cautious  travel,  for  instance),  its

much easier for the Dungeon Master to roll a single check for

the days travel and then determine randomly at what point in

the days travel the encounter takes place.

Parties that are moving with unusual caution (half their best

gory. Parties that are stopped or camped may use the Open

Camping encounter chance. Parties that are camping in secret

or hiding may use the last encounter chance. A party camping

with a fire is never camping in secret unless it can somehow

hide the firelight or smoke.

Desolate areas are places that are not settled and generally

do not support great amounts of wildlife or monsters.

Wilderness  areas  are  not  settled  but  support  significant

wildlife or monsters.

Frontier  areas  are  lightly  settled,  but  communities  are

small and far apart.

Settled areas feature broad stretches of cleared land, a fair

number  of  small  villages  and  thorps  no  more  than  a  days

travel from each other, and some amount of patrols from

nearby  cities  or  fortresses.  The  Sundabar  and  Rauvin  vales

are  the  only  settled  parts  of  the  Silver  Marches,  and  even

large  portions  of  these  regions  (for  example,  the  difficult

stretch of the Rauvin between Silverymoon and Everlund)

might be considered frontier or wilderness areas instead.

For the purposes of this book, the Silver Marches and the

nearby terrain has been divided into seven encounter tables:

the Rauvin Vale and Sundabar Vale, the Moonlands and Cold

Vale,  the  Evermoors,  the  Cold  Wood  and  Moonwood,  the

High  Forest,  the  Nether  and  Rauvin  Mountains,  and  the

Spine of the World and Ice Mountains. These charts supplant

the  encounter  tables  from  the  FORGOTTEN REALMS DUN-

GEON MASTERs Screen, since they provide more localized en-

counter  possibilities  than  the  general  climate  and  terrain

tables in that product.

Encounter tables

Monsters  mentioned  on  these  tables  can  be  found  in  this

book,  Monster  Compendium:  Monsters  of  Faern, the  FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting, or the Monster Manual.

If no symbol appears next to the monster name, the creature

appears  in  the  Monster  Manual. Creatures  from  other

sources are identified as follows:

m From Monster Compendium: Monsters of Faern.

f From the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

s From Chapter 7 of this book.

Each  wilderness  encounter  table  includes  the  following

information.

d%: The result on percentile dice that will generate this

encounter. Use the Day or Night column, as appropriate.

Encounter:  The  type  of  creature  encountered.  Some  en-

counters are with groups of creatures, such as an orc patrol

or a merchant caravan.

Number Encountered: The number of creatures encoun-

tered. If the term see Groups appears here, refer to the sec-

tion  following  the  tables  for  the  exact  composition  of  the

encounter. On occasion, an encounter is with a natural phe-

nomenon (such as a forest fire or a mountain torrent) rather

than with one or more creatures. The Groups section also in-

cludes information on these natural phenomena.

GROUPS

Special groups called out in the preceding tables are described

here. If the class of a humanoid is not specified, assume that

it is a 1st-level warrior.

Argent  Legion  Patrol: 1d4+4  1st-level  warriors  and  1d3

leaders (level 1d4+1), mounted on light warhorses and armed

with  lances,  crossbows,  and  longswords.  To  determine  the

leaders  classes,  roll  d%:  0120,  cleric;  2160,  fighter;

6170,  paladin;  7180,  ranger;  8190,  sorcerer;  91100,

wizard. Argent Legion patrols are usually lawful neutral.

Avalanche/Landslide:  A  natural  hazard  threatens  the

characters;  see  the  Encountering  Natural  Hazards  sidebar

and Avalanches and Landslides, later in this chapter. Refer

also to Landslides and Avalanches in Chapter 3 of the DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide.

Arctic  Dwarf  Hunters:  The  hunting  party  consists  of

1d4+2 arctic dwarf War1, 1d2 arctic dwarf barbarians (level

1d3+2),  and  a  leader  of  level  1d4+3.  To  determine  the

leaders  class,  roll  d%:  0150,  barbarian;  5165,  cleric;

6675, druid; 7680, fighter; 8195, ranger; 96100, rogue.

Bandits: 1d6+1 1st-level warriors and 1d2 NPC leaders of

level 1d3+1. To determine the class of the leaders, roll d%:

0115, cleric; 1640, fighter; 4160, rogue; 6170, sorcerer;

71100,  warrior.  Bandits  are  usually  chaotic  evil.  For  the

race  of  the  bandit  group,  roll  d%:  0110,  dwarf;  1170,

human; 71100, half-orc.

Bugbear  Band: 1d10+10  bugbears,  1d3  bugbear  warriors

(level 1d3+1), and 1 bugbear fighter (level 1d4+3).

Dwarf Patrol: 1d4+4 1st-level shield dwarf warriors, 1d2

shield dwarf clerics (level 1d3), and 1 leader (level 1d4+2).

For  the  leaders  class,  roll  d%:  0115,  barbarian;  1635,

cleric;  3685,  fighter;  8690,  paladin;  9195,  rogue;

96100, wizard.

Forest Fire: In summer or fall, a forest fire endangers the

characters.  The  fire  covers  a  front  3d10500  feet  across,

centered  on  the  location  of  the  party  at  the  time  the  en-

counter was generated. See the Encountering Natural Haz-

ards sidebar and Forest Fires, later in this chapter.

In winter or spring, treat this as no encounter.

Ghast Pack: 1d3+1 ghasts and 1d6+1 ghouls.

Ghost: This  encounter  consists  of  1d4  ghosts  of  level

1d4+2. To determine the class of each ghost, roll d%: 0105,

bard;  0620,  cleric;  2160,  fighter;  6165,  ranger;  6680,

46

Exploring the Wilds

rogue; 8190, sorcerer; 91100, wizard. The ghosts are usu-

ally neutral evil. For the race of the ghosts, roll d%: 0125,

shield dwarf; 2640, moon elf; 4180, human; 8190, half-

orc; 91100, lightfoot halfling.

Gnoll Hunters: 1d4+2 gnolls, led by 1 gnoll ranger (level

1d3+2)  and  1  gnoll  adept  (level  1d4)  and  accompanied  by

1d2 dire wolves.

Goblin  Raiders: 1d4+4  goblins,  led  by  1  goblin  fighter

(level 1d4+1) and 1 goblin adept (level 1d4). All the goblins

are mounted on worgs.

Merchants: 2d4 1st-level commoners, 2d4 1st-level war-

riors, and 1d2 NPC leaders (level 1d4+1). To determine the

leaders  classes,  roll  d%:  0110,  cleric;  1135,  fighter;

3655,  rogue;  5660,  wizard;  6175,  warrior;  76100,

expert.  Merchants  match  the  normal  alignment  for  their

race (neutral if alignment is not specified). For the race of

the merchants, roll d%: 0120, shield dwarf; 2125, moon

elf; 2675, human; 7685, lightfoot halfling; 8695, half-

orc; 96100, rock gnome.

Mountain  Torrent:  The  party  encounters  an  unmarked

stream in its path with no obvious means of crossing. There

is a 50% chance that some kind of precarious crossing exists

(a  fallen  log,  or  chain  of  boulders)  that  can  be  employed

with  a  successful  Balance  check  (DC  15).  Failure  on  this

check means that the character falls in the water and may

be swept downstream; see Mountain Torrents under Floods

in the following section.

If the party is traveling along a road or trail, the stream is

bridged in some fashion. Treat this as no encounter.

NPCs: The NPC party consists of 1d3+2 individuals (level

2d4).  To  determine  the  alignment,  race,  and  class  of  each

character,  consult  Tables  228  through  232  in  the  DUN-

GEON MASTERs  Guide, or  use  the  corresponding  tables  in

the FORGOTTEN REALMS DUNGEON MASTERs Screen.

Orc Marauders: 1d10+5 orcs, 1d3+1 orc barbarians (level

1d3+1),  and  1  orc  adept  (level  1d6)  accompanied  by  1d2

dire boars.

Orc  Warband: 1d10+10  orcs,  1d3  orc  barbarians  (level

1d3+1),  1d3  orc  fighters  (level  1d3+1),  1  orc  adept  (level

1d6),  and  1  orc  leader  (level  1d3+3),  accompanied  by  1d2

dire boars. To determine the leaders class, roll d%: 0130,

barbarian;  3145,  cleric;  4680,  fighter;  8185,  ranger;

8690, rogue; 91100, sorcerer.

Uthgardt Scouts: 1d4+2 1st-level human warriors and 1d2

leaders (level 1d6+1). For the leaders classes, roll d%: 0150,

barbarian;  5165,  cleric;  6675,  druid;  7685,  ranger;

8690, rogue; 91100, sorcerer. There is a 30% chance the

group  belongs  to  the  Sky  Pony  tribe  and  is  mounted.  Uth-

gardt scouts are usually chaotic neutral.

Vampire  Troupe: 1d2  vampires  and  1d4+1  vampire

spawn.

Werewolf Raiders: 1d4+1 werewolves, 1d4+4 wolves, and 1

werewolf  leader  (level  1d6+1).  To  determine  the  leaders

class,  roll  d%:  0115,  cleric;  1625,  druid;  2660,  fighter;

6175, ranger; 7690, rogue; 91100, sorcerer.

Wood Elf Patrol: 1d4+4 1st-level wood elf warriors, 1d2

wood elf rogues (level 1d3+1), 1d2 wood elf sorcerers (level

1d3+1), and 1 leader (level 1d4+3). For the leaders class, roll

d%:  0110,  cleric;  1120,  druid;  2150,  fighter;  5175,

ranger;  7680,  rogue;  8190,  sorcerer;  91100,  wizard.

Some of these patrols may include moon elves or sun elves.

Weather: The

Invisible Enemy

When folk of other lands think of the Silver Marches, they

envision monsters and cold weather. People of the Marches

know theyre really the same thing. Death comes from the

claws of the land just as surely as from the claws of beasts.

As  one  might  expect,  the  weather  in  the  Silver  Marches

varies from place to place. The far northwestern reach of the

North is a wind-scoured frozen waste, held back from creep-

ing south by the titanic Spine of the World. North of those

peaks lie chill mining settlements that never get warm and

sunny enough to grow crops, and the seemingly infinite gla-

cier known as the Endless Ice Sea. Winter is a time of fre-

quent light, swirling snowfalls, for a total accumulation of 2

to 5 feet over the season.

Just south of the Spine lie the Lands Against the Wall, an

uncharted region of streams, lakes, and crags. Summers are

short and hot, and do little to drive off chill mists and warm

the  icy  waters.  In  these  well-watered  backlands  monsters

roam, and there are no roads or cities. Forests become deep

and thick as one travels south out of the alpine valleys into

lower, rolling hill country where rivers roar. This region is

where the Silver Marches lies.

Some folk divide the backlands from the wilderlands by

their  skies:  in  the  alpine  snow  sky  country,  cloud  cover

rarely  breaks  for  more  than  a  few  moments,  but  sunny

breaks are common in the Sundabar and Rauvin vales.

Both the backlands and the Marches proper see long, cold

winters  lasting  from  mid-Marpenoth  to  late  Tarsakh.

Winter blizzards are frequent, thaws are almost unheard-of,

and snowdrifts are often as high as 15 to 20 feet. The great

rivers  freeze  over  thickly  enough  to  support  sledges  and

draft animals, becoming highways of ice between the end of

Marpenoth and early Ches. Riverside settlements are not iso-

lated by winter, but in the spring, as the icepacks break up,

the rivers become impassable on foot or by boat.

The short but vigorous growing season also makes a good

harvest  crucial  to  avoid  starvation,  or  being  forced  to  go

hunting in the harshest depths of winter. Every house pos-

sesses deep and well-stocked root cellars, and many outlying

steadings  are  constructed  with  earthen  banks  against  the

walls and sit in the lee of stands of trees to deflect the worst

winter winds.

Spring in the Marches is a time of sucking mud, impassa-

ble  roads,  and  flooding  rivers.  Summers  are  short,  hot,  and

humid, with warm breezes coming from the south, lightning

storms  and  unpredictable  weather  everywhererain  can

become hail, sleet, or even snow without warning. To properly

prepared  folk  in  the  North,  heat,  hunger,  and  thirst  will

never be a problem unless theyre trapped in Anauroch, the

unfamiliar Underdark, or high on a bare rock mountainside.

The land provides abundant fare for those who know what to

eat and where to find it.

Exploring the Wilds

Natural Hazards

Hungry  monsters  and  rapacious  brigands  occupy  the

thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these

are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc-

currences  such  as  a  bitter  cold  snap  in  winter,  an  ill-timed

snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many

travelers  and  homesteaders  in  the  Silver  Marches  as  mon-

sters  do,  and  certainly  have  the  potential  to  inflict  much

greater damage to property.

AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The  combination  of  high  mountains  and  heavy  snowfalls

means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around

the  North.  The  Lands  Against  the  Wall,  the  Spine  of  the

World,  the  Rauvin  Mountains,  and  the  passes  through  the

Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the

Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall

than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high,

death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide.

The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely

weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks

throughout the year.

The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in

The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide.  The  typical  avalanche  or  landslide  has  a  width  of

1d6100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo-

site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half

as wide as the avalanches full width. To determine the pre-

cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll

1d620; the result is the number of feet from the center of

the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the partys

location.  Avalanches  advance  at  a  speed  of  500  feet  per

round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round.

THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even  in  the  summertime,  the  mountain  passes  and  high

slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in

the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and

are  wise  enough  to  stay  out  of  the  sort  of  weather  winter

clothing wont help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi-

tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan-

gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Cold Water: Characters who become soaked or drenched

in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream,

but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more

vulnerable  to  cold  damage.  Moderate  temperatures  are

treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated

as  extremely  cold  conditions  for  purposes  of  determining

whether  a  soaked  character  is  vulnerable  to  cold  damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character

changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec-

tion against cold damage.

Characters who remain immersed in cold water take 1d6

points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy-

pothermia.

Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con-

ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen

hard  a  foot  or  so  beneath  the  surface,  except  around  sun-

warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per-

mafrost  will  freeze  (though  stone  cairns  are  necessary  to

keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.

Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of

water  in  the  Silver  Marches  freeze  over.  Most  years,  the

freeze  comes  in  the  month  of  Marpenoth,  beginning

1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month

of  Ches,  disappearing  1d10+20  days  into  the  month.  The

thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or

not the water is flowing:

Encountering Hazards

An encounter with a natural hazard in motion, such as an

avalanche  or  a  forest  fire,  begins  in  a  particular  way  de-

pending on the type of hazard.

Avalanche/Landslide: An avalanche or landslide can be

spotted from as far away as 1d10500 feet by a character

who makes a successful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the

Spot check is modified by any of the conditions that apply

from Table 32 in the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. (Con-

sider  the  avalanche  to  be  a  Colossal  encounter,  meaning

that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all charac-

ters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter dis-

tance,  the  avalanche  moves  closer  to  them,  and  they

automatically  become  aware  of  it  when  it  closes  to  half

the original distance.

Its  possible  to  hear  an  avalanche  coming  even  if  you

cant  see  it.  Under  optimum  conditions  (no  other  loud

noises  occurring),  a  character  who  makes  a  successful

Listen check (DC 15) can hear the avalanche or landslide

when it is 1d6500 feet away. This check might have a DC

of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult

(such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

Forest  Fire: A  forest  fire  can  be  spotted  from  as  far

away as 2d6100 feet by a character who makes a success-

ful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modi-

fied by any of the conditions that apply from Table 32 in

the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. (Consider the fire to be a

Colossal  encounter,  meaning  that  the  DC  is  immediately

reduced by 16.) If all characters fail their Spot checks to

determine the encounter distance, the fire moves closer to

them, and they automatically see it when it closes to half

the original distance.

Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make

Spot  checks  can  feel  the  heat  of  the  fire  (and  thus  auto-

matically spot it) when it is 100 feet away.

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures.

Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice

may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea-

tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice

may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup-

ports creatures of any size.

Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too

heavy  for  the  ice  causes  a  break,  the  ice  collapses  in  a  circle

whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the

creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture

area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a

Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way.

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a

fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmers efforts to

climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer

must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea-

tures cant get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen  rivers  are  dangerous,  too.  Creatures  who  fall

through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the

hole  by  the  current  and  trapped  under  the  ice.  Apply  the

drowning  rule  (see  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide) as necessary.

FOREST FIRES

Most  campfire  sparks  ignite  nothing,  but  if  conditions  are

dry,  winds  are  strong,  or  the  forest  floor  is  dried  out  and

flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often

set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the

lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small

scorch-smolders  of  blackened  vegetation  are  the  usual

result, not conflagrations that spread for miles.

Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a

fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can

run  (assume  120  feet  per  round  for  winds  of  moderate

strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re-

mains so for 2d410 minutes before dying to a smolder.

Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three

dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

Heat:  Getting  caught  within  a  forest  fire  is  even  worse

than  being  exposed  to  abysmal  heat  (see  Heat  Dangers  in

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). Breathing the

air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round

(no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save

every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4

points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath

can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage.

Catching on Fire: Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at

risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes

them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch-

ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide.

Smoke:  Forest  fires  naturally  produce  a  great  deal  of

smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a

Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous

check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac-

ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points

of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one-

half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

FLOODS

In locales throughout the Silver Marches where heavy pre-

cipitation and steep slopes prevail, floods are common.

Rivers in Flood: In spring, the enormous snowmelt from

the  slopes  of  the  Nether  and  Rauvin  mountains  engorges

most  of  the  streams  and  rivers  in  and  around  the  Silver

Marches. During spring flood, rivers become wider, deeper,

and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during

the  spring  flood,  and  its  width  increases  by  a  factor  of

1d450%.  Fords  may  disappear  for  days,  bridges  may  be

swept  away,  and  even  ferries  might  not  be  able  to  manage

the crossing of a flooded river.

A river in flood adds +5 to the DC of any Swim checks that

characters  attempt.  For  example,  Striding  Giant  Rapids  on

the  Rauvin  might  normally  be  considered  rough  water  (see

the Swim skill description in Chapter 4 of the Players Hand-

book), which means that Swim checks to get across the river

are against DC 15. When this area is in spring flood, the DC

rises to 20. (The increase in water depth may make fords too

deep  for  most  travelers  to  wade  successfully,  so  swimming

may be their best option if crossing the river is necessary.)

Mountain  Torrent:  Innumerable  swift,  strong  streams

cascade down out of the mountains of the Silver Marches in

all seasons. In general, the typical mountain torrent is 5d6

feet in width and studded with boulders. Waterfalls 1d610

feet in height occur every 1d4 miles.

Unlucky or clumsy characters may find themselves in a

fast-moving gauntlet of icy water, deadly rocks, and sudden

waterfalls.  Refer  to  Water  Dangers  in  Chapter  3  of  the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. Characters swept away by the

torrent must attempt Swim checks (DC 15) every round to

avoid going under. If a character gets a skill check result of

5  or  more  over  the  minimum  necessary,  he  arrests  his

motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snaghe

is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water.

Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc-

cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested

by a rock, limb, or snag cant escape unless they strike out

into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

Flash  Floods: These  sudden,  short-lived  torrents  occur

after  heavy  rains  or  ice  breakups  in  spring.  A  flash  flood

typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.

Flash  floods  advance  at  a  speed  of  60  feet.  See  Flash

Floods  under  Weather  Hazards  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide.

FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist

and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat

The weather is everyones enemy

cant  get  too  lost,  of  course.  However,  fogbound  overland

travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies,

and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of

1d105  feet,  completely  foiling  normal  vision  and  darkvi-

sion  beyond  this  range.  Creatures  closer  than  the  absolute

limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment

(20% miss chance).

GETTING LOST

There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following

an  obvious  road,  trail,  or  feature  such  as  a  stream  or

lakeshore prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but trav-

elers striking off cross-country may become disorientedes-

pecially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

Poor  Visibility: Any  time  characters

cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevail-

ing conditions of visibility, they may be-

come  lost.  Characters  traveling

through  fog,  snow,  or  a  downpour

might easily lose the ability to see any

landmarks  not  in  their  immediate

vicinity. Similarly, characters travel-

ing at night may be at risk, too, de-

pending on the quality of their light

sources,  the  amount  of  moonlight,

and whether or not they have dark-

vision or low-light vision.

Difficult Terrain: Any character in

forest,  moor,  hill,  or  mountain  terrain

may become lost if he or she moves away from a trail, road,

stream, or other obvious path or track.

Chance to Get Lost: If conditions exist that make getting

lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed

at a Wilderness Lore check or become lost. The difficulty of

this  check  varies  based  on  the  terrain,  the  visibility  condi-

tions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area

being traveled through.

If the character leading the way has succeeded at an Intuit

Direction check for the day, he gains a +4 bonus on his Wil-

derness Lore checks to avoid becoming lost that day.

A character with at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (geogra-

phy) or Knowledge (local) pertaining to the area being trav-

eled through gains a +2 synergy bonus on this check.

Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local

or overland movement to see if travelers have become lost.

In the case of a party moving together, only the character

leading the way makes the check. (DM Tip: Make this check

in  secret,  since  the  characters  may  not  realize  that  theyre

lost right away.)

Effects  of  Being  Lost:  If  a  party  becomes  lost,  it  is  no

longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel.

Randomly determine the direction the party actually travels

in during each hour of local or overland movement. The char-

acters movement continues to be random until they blunder

into a landmark they cant miss, or until they recognize that

they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.

Recognizing  that  Youre  Lost: Once  per  hour  of  random

travel, each character in the party may attempt a Wilderness

Lore check (DC 20 1 per hour of random travel) to recog-

nize  that  they  are  no  longer  certain  of  their  direction  of

travel.  Some  circumstances  may  make  it  obvious  that  the

characters are lost; if they expected to reach a certain spot

within an hour but three or four hours pass by with no sign

of their destination, thats a bad sign.

Setting  a  New  Course:  A  lost

party is also uncertain of determin-

ing  in  which  direction  it  should

travel in order to reach a desired

objectiveeven  an  objective

such as the point where we left

the road and went off into these

dratted  woods.  Determining

the  correct  direction  of  travel

once a party has become lost re-

quires  a  Wilderness  Lore  check

(DC  15  +2  per  hour  of  random

travel).  If  a  character  fails  in  this

check, he chooses a random direction as

the  correct  direction  for  resuming

travel. (DM Tip: Again, this is a check you should make in

secret. The lost characters may think they know the way to

travel  after  regaining  their  bearings,  but  could  be  entirely

wrong again.)

Once the characters are traveling along their new course,

correct or incorrect, its entirely possible for them to get lost

again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to

become lost, check once per hour of travel as described under

Chance  to  Get  Lost  to  see  if  the  party  maintains  its  new

course, or begins to move at random again.

Conflicting Directions: Its possible that several characters

may  attempt  to  determine  the  right  direction  to  proceed

after becoming lost. Thats just fine. The DM makes a Wil-

derness Lore check for each character in secret, then tells the

players  whose  characters  succeeded  the  correct  direction  to

travel, and tells the players whose characters failed a random

direction they think is right. (DM Tip: A few extraneous die

rolls behind your screen might make it less apparent which

characters are right and which characters are wrong.)

Regaining  Your  Bearings:  There  are  several  ways  to  be-

come un-lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new

course  and  follow  it  to  the  destination  theyre  trying  to

reach,  theyre  not  lost  anymore.  Second,  the  characters

through random movement might run into an unmistakable

landmark.  Third,  if  conditions  suddenly  improvethe  fog

lifts, the sun comes up, or the travelers use know direction to

ascertain the correct direction of northlost characters may

attempt  to  set  a  new  course,  as  described  above,  with  a  +4

bonus on the Wilderness Lore check. Finally, more powerful

magic such as find the path may make their course clear.

MOUNTAIN TRAVEL

High  altitude  can  be  extremely  fatiguingor  sometimes

deadlyto creatures that arent used to it. Cold becomes ex-

treme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even

the most hardy of warriors.

Acclimated Characters: Creatures accustomed to high alti-

tude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature nor-

mally found in mountain terrain is considered native to the

area, and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters with the

Endurance feat, 4 ranks of Wilderness Lore, or 7 ranks of

Climb are also acclimated to high altitude.

Undead,  constructs,  and  other  creatures  that  do  not

breathe are immune to altitude effects.

Altitude Bands: In general, mountains present three possi-

ble altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.

Low  Pass  (lower  than  7,000  feet):  Most  travel  in  low

mountains takes place in low passes. Travelers may find the

going  difficult  (which  is  reflected  in  the  movement  modi-

fiers for traveling through mountains), but there are no un-

usual weather or altitude effects.

Low Peak or High Pass (7,000 to 20,000 feet): Ascending to

the  highest  slopes  of  low  mountains,  or  most  normal  travel

through high mountains, falls into this category. At these ele-

vations, creatures may be subject to high altitude effects (see

below). Temperatures at this level are one grade colder than the

prevailing  weather  would  indicatefor  example,  if  the  days

temperature is moderate, its actually cold at this altitude.

High  Peak  (more  than  20,000  feet):  The  highest  slopes  and

peaks of high mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these el-

evations, creatures may be subject to altitude sickness (see below).

Temperatures at this level are always two grades colder than the

prevailing weather indicatesfor example, if the days tempera-

ture is moderate, its actually extremely cold at this altitude.

High Altitude Effects: All nonacclimated creatures labor

to  breathe  in  the  thin  air  at  high  altitude.  See  Lack  of

Air/High Altitude, under Other Dangers in Chapter 3 of the

DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide.  Acclimated  characters  are  not

subject to high altitude effects.

Altitude Sickness: Any creature at an altitude higher than

20,000 feet is subject to both high altitude effects and alti-

tude sickness, as described under Lack of Air/High Altitude

in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide.  Creatures

acclimated  to  high  altitude  as  described  above  receive  a  +4

bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects

and  altitude  sickness,  but  eventually  even  seasoned  moun-

taineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.

QUICKSAND AND BOGS

In  moors,  marshes,  and  other  examples  of  sodden  terrain,

hidden,  water-filled  holes  await  the  unwary.  Obvious  bogs

are  not  very  dangerouseverybody  can  recognize  a  mud-

hole  or  a  scum-covered  pond.  However,  some  of  these

patches present a deceptively solid appearance and may trap

careless characters. A character approaching a hidden bog or

patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a Wilder-

ness Lore check (DC 8) to spot the danger before stepping

in, but charging or running characters dont have a chance

to detect a hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch

of quicksand or quaking bog is (1d4+1)5 feet in diameter;

the momentum of a charging or running character carries

him or her 1d25 feet into the bog.

Effects of Quicksand: Characters in quicksand must make

a Swim check (DC 10) every round to simply tread water in

place, or a Swim check (DC 15) to move 5 feet in whatever

direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by

5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown

whenever he can no longer hold his breath.

Characters below the surface of a bog may swim back to

the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15  +1 per con-

secutive round of being under the surface).

Rescue: Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can

be  difficult.  A  rescuer  needs  a  branch,  spear  haft,  rope,  or

similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one

end of it. Then he must make a Strength check (DC 15) to

successfully  pull  the  victim,  and  the  victim  must  make  a

Strength  check  (DC  10)  to  hold  onto  the  branch,  pole,  or

rope. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make an imme-

diate Swim check (DC 15) to stay above the surface. If both

checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety.

RAIN, SNOW, SLEET, AND HAIL

Precipitation  is  a  daily  occurrence  in  the  Silver  Marches

most  of  the  year.  Bad  weather  frequently  slows  or  halts

travel  and  makes  it  virtually  impossible  to  navigate  from

one spot to another.

Rain: Rain is all too frequent in the North. Rain affects

visibility, ranged attacks and Listen, Search, and Spot checks

as  described  in  Precipitation  under  Weather  Hazards  in

Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide. Characters

caught out in steady rain become soaked in 2d610 minutes,

which may make them more vulnerable to cold damage (see

The Claws of the Cold earlier in this chapter).

Downpours:  These  sudden,  heavy  rains  often  cause  flash

floods in hilly or mountainous country. Downpours have all

the properties of rain, except that visibility is reduced as de-

scribed below, and characters become soaked in 10 minutes,

rendering them more susceptible to cold damage.

Visibility in a downpour is limited to a range of 1d105

feet.  Creatures  closer  than  the  absolute  limit  of  visibility

gain one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

Hail:  The  effects  of  hail  are  described  in  Precipitation

under  Weather  Hazards  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON

MASTERs Guide. Hail in the North can be unusually heavy

and dangerousthere is a 10% chance that the hail deals 1

point of damage to all creatures caught in the open, and if

this happens, theres a 20% chance that hailstones the size of

a human fist (or bigger) fall. This extra-large hail deals 1d4

points of damage to any creature caught in the open.

Fallen hail reduces movement by half, just like a fall of

snow. In moderate or warm temperatures, it takes 1d4 hours

for fallen hail to melt. In cold temperatures, hail remains on

the ground for 4d4 hours.

Sleet: The ice storms of the North are legendary for their

destructive  power.  Sleet  has  the  same  effects  on  visibility,

ranged attacks, and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as rain,

and reduces movement by half.

Sleet hisses as it falls, and coats everything with ice, creat-

ing  slippery  conditions  for  any  skill  checks  affected  by  the

51

620_088567_001_EN_Ch2a.qxd  4/26/02  1:49 PM  Page 52

Exploring the Wilds

conditions of the surface (Balance and Climb, for example). This

slippery state lasts until snowfall covers the ice, or a thaw (one

day of moderate or higher temperatures) melts it. In addition,

sleet  soaks  characters  in  the  open  over  the  course  of  2d610

minutes, making them more vulnerable to cold damage.

Snow: Falling  snow  has  the  same  effects  on  visibility,

ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and reduces

movement  to  half.  A  day  of  snowfall  leaves  1d6  inches  of

snow  on  the  ground.  When  the  depth  of  the  snow  reaches

half a creatures height, movement is slowed to one-quarter

normal,  and  when  snow  reaches  a  creatures  height,  move-

ment is halved again.

Snow melts off at the rate of 4 inches per day of moder-

ate temperatures, 8 inches per day of warm temperatures, or

12 inches per day of hot temperatures.

Heavy  Snow:  Heavy  snowfall  has  the  same  effects  as

normal snowfall, but also restricts visibility as fog does (see

Fog, earlier in this section). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d3

feet  of  snow  on  the  ground.  Heavy  snow  accompanied  by

strong or severe winds may result in snowdrifts 1d45 feet

in depth, especially in and around objects big enough to de-

flect the prevailing winda cabin or large tent, for instance.

There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompa-

nied by lightning (see below).

LIGHTNING

Thunderstorms are common in the summer and early fall in

the Silver Marches. A mountain thunderstorm is nothing to

stand around and admire; it can be deadly. Lightning some-

times accompanies heavy snowfalls, too.

Thunderstorms: During a day in which thunderstorms appear,

creatures in the open encounter 1d3 distinct storms. Each storm

lasts for 2d610 minutes. There is a 20% chance per storm that

a bolt endangers a creature or group of creatures in the open.

Each lightning bolt inflicts 1d10 8-sided dice of damage

in a 10-foot radius. Roll randomly to determine which char-

acter is at the center of the strike. Any threatened character

(including the character at the center) is entitled to a Reflex

save (DC 15) to take only half damage.

SANDSTORMS

Thanks  to  the  dampness  of  the  North,  duststorms  are  un-

known in these lands, but sandstormsheavy particles driven

by furious winds from Anaurochoccur from time to time.

They seldom reach west of Sundabar. Sandstorms reduce vis-

ibility  to  1d105  feet  and  provide  a  4  penalty  on  Listen,

Search, and Spot checks. Sandstorms deal 1d3 points of subdual

damage  per  hour  to  any  creatures  caught  in  the  open,  and

leave a thin coating of sand (1d2 inches) in their wake.

Random Weather

Many different weather influences impact the Silver Marches.

The prevailing weather patterns in this part of Faern tend to

come from the Sea of Swords to the west, and the presence of

high  mountains  on  all  sides  often  creates  cloud  barriers

that force frequent precipitation. The presence of Anauroch

nearby also influences the weather in unpredictable ways.

52

Any particular days weather consists of three components:

the  temperature,  the  wind  strength,  and  the  precipitation.

Tables  28  through  211  provide  random  weather  combina-

tions based on each season, weighted toward more or less likely

results. A sudden thaw in the mountains is possible in winter, but

its not as likely as long stretches of bitter cold or heavy snow.

USING THE TABLES

Any given weather condition lasts for 1d6 days before a new

pattern sets in, so its only necessary to roll for new weather

when the previous pattern ends, not every day. The weather

tables are organized into three basic locations: river valleys,

open country, and northern or alpine areas. Apply the same

die roll to all three regions (this makes it less likely that the

mountains will be experiencing a rare thaw at the same time

the river valleys are suffering from a brutal cold snap).

River Valley: The Rauvin and Sundabar vales fall into this

category, as well as the eaves of the High Forest. Although

plagued by heavy fogs throughout the year, these regions are

more sheltered than other parts of the Silver Marches.

Open Country: The Evermoors, Moonlands, Old Delzoun

(except for Sundabar Vale), and the forests of the northern

Silver Marches fall into this category.

DEFINITIONS

Results from Tables 28 through 211 are described below.

Temp.: Temperature results fall into the following broad

categories.  Nighttime  temperatures  are  generally  10  to  20

degrees colder and may actually fall into the next colder cat-

The other citizens of Silverymoon are too numerous and

diverse to enumerate here.

Notable  Imports: Food  (especially  grain  and  livestock),

armor, weapons, footwear, textiles and clothing.

Notable  Exports: Books,  paper,  furniture,  herbs,  inks,

glass, glassware, furs, timber, valuable ores.

Silverymoon is that rarest of things, a bustling city dominated

by  trees  and  beautiful  stone  buildings.  Old  oaks,  shadow-

tops, and duskwoods compete with tall, thin spires to touch

Scattered through the sweep of wood and mountain,

like  islands  in  a  vast  sea,  the  cities  of  the  North

stand as bastions of civilization, home to those who

brave the challenges of the frontier. The great cities are cen-

ters of vital trade, seats of political power, and home to the

majority of the citizens who dwell in the Silver Marches.

This chapter details some of the most important communities

of the Silver Marches. Some, such as Silverymoon and Everlund,

are large cities; others, such as Quaervarr or Newfort, are little

more than rustic settlements. Most fall somewhere in between,

but each is unique in its construction, layout, and situation.

These  cities  are  the  starting  and  ending  points  for  most

Silver Marches adventures, because they offer the best oppor-

tunities  for  a  respite  from  the  unpredictable  northern

weather. Settled areas also represent the only locations where

characters can reliably gain access to many goods and services

necessary for success in the wilderness. The larger communi-

ties are centers for vital trade, and enable adventurers to ac-

quire magic items and rare local lore. And all settlements are

places  of  refuge  from  the  dangerous  predators  and  hungry

monsters of the wildlandsor most of them, anyway.

Silverymoon,

Gem of the North

The anchor of the Silver Marches and the most wealthy and

important  surface  city  of  the  North  next  to  Waterdeep

itself, Silverymoon is truly the Gem of the North.

the sky, and blueleaf trees shade flagstone sidewalks along

most  of  the  cobbled  streets.  The  prevailing  style  of

stonework  is  flowing  curves,  as  if  buildings  grew  rather

than  being  erected  block  by  block.  Many  older  buildings

are  clad  in  a  thin  layer  of  fused  royal  blue  or  emerald-

green glass.

Balconies  and  curving  stairs  are  everywhereand  win-

dowsills, railings, and newel-posts are all adorned with herbs

and flowers growing in sculpted bowls. Most dwellings have

grass paths leading to sheltered bowers. Many folk take time

every day to lift their harps, pipes, or voices to make music,

and  things  of  beauty  are  more  than  prized  and  admired

such design is expected.

Many places preserve lore, but in Silverymoon knowledge

is highly valued. Most folk find satisfaction in being well in-

formed in at least one area of expertise. The citizens of Sil-

verymoon, also called Silvaeren, love witty sayings, sharing

jokes, lore, music and readings of ballads, poems, and roman-

tic fiction; most attend revels or private dances and feasts

thrice per tenday. They tend to dabble in many interests, so

shops in the city appear and disappear with the seasonsbut

these small, cozy boutiques are always crammed with beauti-

ful, fascinating objects, small magics, books (including blank

tomes for writing use), and maps.

River Rauvin is linked to the newer environs on the south

bank by the famous Moonbridge, a magical construct of sil-

very force whose central span can be deactivated to protect

the city from invasion, or to allow tall-masted ships to pass.

It impresses the eye more than the many soaring spires of

the city, slender and graceful towers unmatched elsewhere

in Faern.

Unquestionably the foremost center of learning and cul-

ture in the North, Silverymoon is a happy place where folk of

many races dwell in peace together. Much of this feeling of

safety and goodwill is due to the influence of powerful local

mages and the Harpers. Both forces are joined in the person

of  the  lady  who  shaped  modern  Silverymoon,  the  kindly,

diplomatic mage Alustriel, known to Silvaeren as Lady Hope.

She encourages many feasts and revels; outlanders are warned

that her spies are everywhere at such diversions.

Alustriel  prefers  to  keep  people  happy  and  hopeful

through  enlightened  rule,  but  she  recognizes  that  in-

trigue, deception, and evil deeds are unavoidable, and long

since established and trained a cadre of personal agents to

guard against such things. Some of these individuals now

act  as  her  heralds  as  High  Lady  of  the  Silver  Marches,

but  others  remain  in  the  service  of  the  new  High  Mage

and serve Silverymoon first. The citys army, the Knights

in  Silver,  openly  patrols  the  land  for  seven  days  ride

around  the  city,  and  the  city  remains  a  member  of  the

Lords Alliance.

Visiting Silverymoon

Silverymoon looks more like a series of gardens or forest

glades  than  a  stone  city,  and  thanks  to  all  the  growing

things, it reeks less than most settlements a third its size.

Its  also  quieter,  thanks  to  the  gentle  breezes  and  sound-

muting  properties  of  the  citys  mythal,  which  also  pre-

vents surprise rainfalls, extremes of temperature, and the

harshest winter weather. A good series of dwarf-built cis-

terns,  pumps,  and  piping  ensure  that  the  city  has  both

flushed  privies  and  ample  fresh  water  both  for  drinking

and for gardening.

The lush beauty of the city and its many forest districts

makes it quite easy for visitors to become lost. Thankfully,

Silvaeren dont mind furnishing directions, and every cistern

cover in the cobbles of an intersection has an arrow graven

into it, denoting north.

Most  city  buildings  have  cellars,  and  four  or  even  five

floors  above  them,  but  the  trees  and  gently  rolling  land-

scaping make the spires of Silverymoon seem to loom over

passersby a  lot  less than the structures in most cities. The

older  part  of  the  city  is  Northbank,  and  the  newer,  still

swiftly expanding area is Southbank. Many folk have rushed

to buy and build in the new city and are short of coin. They

eagerly rent rooms or floors to strangers without question

or scrutiny.

NOTED TAVERNS

Many  excellent  alehouses,  taverns,  wine  cellars,  tap-

houses,  and  similar  establishments  grace  Silverymoons

shaded streets.

The Bright Blade Brandished: Located in Northbank, on

Sunset Lane in the westernmost angle of the Wallrun. All

are welcome at this friendly alehouse, which consists of two

floors of rustic charm, with curtained booths. Wizards down

on their luck can earn 1 sp per mage hand spell cast to whisk

tankards overhead to waiting hands.

The Dancing Goat: Also located in Northbank, on the east

side  of  the  Moonway  just  north  of  the  Moonbridge,  the

Dancing Goat is renowned for raucous revelry at all hours. It

is a site of endless, enthusiastic dancing and flirting, with a

remarkable cellar boasting hundreds of vintages. The Danc-

ing  Goat  sometimes  attracts  the  attentions  of  pickpockets

and other professionals.

The Hammer and the Helm: Found on Highaxe Lane

in  Northbank,  this  cheerful  barn  of  dwarf  revelry  also

welcomes  trusted  sword-companions.  Roast  fowl  wings

provide missiles when jests go bad, amid oceans of stout,

Strongbeard cider.

Helmers Wall: In Northbank, bridging Bowshot Ride at

its meeting with the Old Wall, stands this former city gate-

house  built  of  massive  beams  and  rough  stone  walls.

Helmers Wall boasts a superb wine cellar. It is quite popular

with  students  of  the  various  colleges,  both  scholarly  and

magical, who haunt these bare boards, alight with hope and

dreams  and  pompous  high-minded  speeches.  Such  activity

often makes for an entertaining evening, although the worst

speakers are often pelted from their perches.

Sorlars Smiling Satyr: Located in Southbank, on Auchtareen

Lane, this relatively new, bright maze of stained glass win-

dows, booths, curtains, and odd stairs makes difficult naviga-

tion for the tipsy. The establishment caters to females and

dignified or timid males escorting them. The proprietor is a

sorcerer of some skill who brooks no brawling.

The Stagstand: Located in Northbank, on the north side

of  the  Old  Wall  nine  doors  west  of  the  Market,  the  Stag-

stand features antlers everywhere and bright battle banners

lit by lanterns. This place is a dining house and dance hall

rather  than  a  simple  taphouse.  The  Stagstand  serves  veni-

son,  strange-tasting  eel  pie,  crusty  cheese-baked  river  crab,

an  assortment  of  spiced  breads,  hearty  darksmoke  roth

sausage, and the famous nut cheese of Silverymoon. Late in

the evening the large, empty dance floor often comes alive

with revelry.

MAJOR INNS

In  the  summertime,  passing  a  night  or  two  in  the  gardens

and  parks  of  Silverymoon  is  not  an  unpleasant  experience,

but at all other times of year most travelers find a good inn

advisable. Some of the more notable are described below.

The  Golden  Oak:  Located  in  Northbank  on  Dancers

Mask Lane, northeast off Rallowglass Ride, the Golden Oak

features cozy, rustic rooms, dim flagstone passages, fragrant

herbs,  and  windowbox  ferns,  reminding  guests  of  sleeping

outdoors  in  a  safe,  pleasant  corner  of  the  woods.  Meeting

rooms are available for rent upstairs, while a friendly cellar

taproom boasts entertaining gossip downstairs.

All the rooms in this inn open off a central atrium domi-

nated by a huge oak that rises up to the open sky, lanterns de-

pending from its branches to hang above tables. Dedicated to

the  goddess  Shiallia,  the  Golden  Oak  is  favored  by  druids,

rangers, elves, and those who like privacy or peace and quiet.

The  prices  are  stiff,  but  guests  can  expect  superb  personal

chamber service.

Wayward  House:  Found  in  the  northwest  corner  of  the

meeting of Bowshot Ride and the Ghostwalk, this inn was built

on the former site of the Inn of the Wayward Sages, a local

landmark.  That  building  was  destroyed  by  a  fire  and  subse-

quently replaced by the Wayward House, an inn less shabby

and less seedy than its predecessor. The Wayward House is the

new  popular  place  to  stay  for  visitors  not  concerned  with

trumpeting their wealth or importance. Chamberlains Havorr

Merendil  and  Jhalessa  Shorncrown  are  quick  to  recommend

local craftfolk, tutors, and repairers.

Brief History

Founded  on  a  place  sacred  since  time  immemorial  to  the

deities Mielikki and Lurue the Unicorn, Silverymoon grew

from a cluster of log steadings around the Moonsilver Inn,

near the holy groves at Silverymoon Fordone of the few

places  where  the  River  Rauvin  was  shallow  enough  to  be

forded  in  summer,  and  easily  bridged.  Moontree  became

Silver Village, and then Silverymoon Town.

The town developed slowly because its inhabitants built in

harmony with the forest, rather than clearing and burning

the land. Legends claim that Mielikki and Lurue visited the

Moonsilver Inn in human form and were so taken with the

56

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 57

Cities of the Silver Marches

folk  of  Silverymoon  and  their  sensitivity  to  the  land  that

they blessed the inn. Though the building later collapsed, its

stones  were  used  in  the  construction  of  the  city  gates  and

walls, and the promise of safety bestowed by the deities bless-

ing  is  thought  to  remain  in  effect,  holding  sway  over  the

entire city.

Silverymoon became a city in 637 DR, when its first set

of walls was completed and the first of the citys ruling High

Mages, Ecamane Truesilver, was elected. Truesilver and his

nine apprentices brought learning to their fellow Silvaeren

(many of whom were rough, unlettered trappers and loggers)

and founded a library to accompany their school. Successive

High Mages have pursued this goal of fostering learning and

culture. Through the excitement of artistic endeavor and a

feeling of refuge founded in various races dwelling together

in  harmony,  they  have  sought  to  make  Silverymoon  the

Myth Drannor of the North, a bulwark of civilization in

the  Savage  Frontier.  Throughout  Truesilvers  reign,  skilled

wizards and loremasters continued to come to the city from

elsewhere in Faern, and Silverymoon became an important

center of magical study.

In  712  DR,  Truesilver  died  and  was  succeeded  as  High

Mage by his nephew Aglanthol the Red. In 714 DR, Myth

Drannor  fell,  shaking  all  the  nations  of  northern  Faern.

Noble wizards and heroes of Silverymoon rescued a handful

of  Myth  Drannors  more  prominent  leaders  and  scholars

from the destruction, sacrificing themselves in the process. A

desire on the part of some Silverymoon mages to plunder the

ruins of Myth Drannor brought demons and devils into Sil-

verymoon, and Aglanthol died fighting them in 719 DR. He

was succeeded by Ederan Nharimlur, who took to wife the

elf princess Elnaril (one of those rescued from Myth Dran-

nor)  and  reigned  long  and  peacefully.  During  his  time  the

city doubled in size.

Upon Ederans death in 784 DR, his daughter Amaara

Nharimlur  became  High  Mage  of  Silverymoon.  In  815

DR, Elu Dualen, a human girl of great magical aptitude

(actually Alustriel, unknown to all) arrived in the city and

befriended Amaara and her sister Lynx. In 821 DR, Elu

and  Lynx  established  the  Ladys  College,  the  first  open

school for mages in Silverymoon to take students, not ap-

prentices,  and  as  payment  for  tutelage  required  an  equal

time of service in defense of the city. In 843 DR, Elu and

other  wizards  created  the  Moonbridge,  the  citys  most

famous landmark.

Elu became High Mage in 857 DR when Amaara and

her mother left for Evermeet. Elu and Lynx departed in

876  DR.  This  time,  the  High  Mages  seat  did  not  pass

peacefully.  Warlord  Lashtor,  commander  of  the  citys

army, took the opportunity to seize the city, slaughtering

wizards  in  the  streets  and  burning  magical  libraries.  His

reign lasted little more than a year before the mage Tana-

lanthara,  later  known  as  Lady  Wolf,  deposed  Lashtor

and  restored  power  to  the  High  Mages  seat.  She  in  turn

sacrificed  herself  in  882  DR,  helping  to  defend  Silvery-

moon from a fierce orc-horde.

The people of Silverymoon elected Tanisell the Cloaked,

a  humble  and  soft-spoken  wizard,  to  become  their  next

High  Mage.  In  his  time  the  wards  around  the  city  were

strengthened, and the great library known as the Vault of

the  Sages  was  built.  The  Keeper  of  the  Vault,  Nunivytt

Threskaal, succeeded Tanisell in 920 DR, beginning a long

and  peaceful  reign  that  ended  with  Threskaals  death  in

1050 DR. The next High Mage of the city was Orjalun, a

mage marked by Mystra at birth. His reign was marked by

the emergence of many great mages (including Ahghairon

of Waterdeep and Bowgentle), but also by a plague in 1150

DR  that  slew  half  of  Silverymoons  citizens.  Orjalun  ap-

pointed  his  former  apprentice  Sepur  as  his  successor  in

1230  DR,  but  that  wizard  abandoned  the  city  after  two

years. Sepurs departure led to a series of deadly spell-bat-

tles between resident wizards for rule of the city. In the ab-

sence of a worthy mage, the folk of Silverymoon elected a

mayor to rule the city.

In 1235 DR, the Silvermayor lost control of the city

to Warlord Khallos Shieldsunder as an orc horde besieged

the city. The orcs broke through the wallsthe first time

an  enemy  army  entered  Silverymoonbut  an  army  of

elves and Harpers led by Storm Silverhand and Alustriel

of  the  famous  Seven  Sisters  destroyed  the  invaders,  the

Warlord  Khallos,  and  the  self-proclaimed  High  Mage

Shaloss Ethenfrost as well, restoring peace and just rule

to the city.

Alustriel  became  the  first  High  Mage  of  Silverymoon

unanimously chosen by the people. As High Mage she ruled

long and well. Under her gently guiding hand (and mastery

of  subtle  intrigue  and  manipulation),  Silverymoon  truly

became  wealthy,  well  defended,  sophisticated,  clean,  and  a

beautiful  place  to  live.  In  1369  DR,  Alustriel  appointed

Taern  Hornblade  to  the  office  of  High  Mage  of  Silvery-

moon and turned her efforts to creating the Silver Marches.

She remains revered in the city, and commands the love and

loyalty of the great majority of the citys residents.

The  advent  of  the  confederation  known  as  the  Silver

Marches has reinvigorated Silverymoon as a base for adven-

turers eager to carve out their own holds and steadings, or at

least win their share of the fabled riches of the North. Sil-

verymoon  today  is  bustling,  but  Taern  is  working  hard  to

keep overcrowding to a minimum. He encourages settlement

in  the  surrounding  countryside  by  issuing  land  grants,  im-

proving trails and patrols, sponsoring (and guarding) travel-

ing  vendors  who  bring  trade  to  outlying  settlements,  and

establishing  palace  officers  who  regularly  visit  settlers  to

learn their concerns and problems.

The Wards of Silverymoon

Most folk in Waterdeep and the Heartlands have heard that

a  powerful,  ever-present  field  of  magic  guards  the  Gem  of

the  North.  An  even  more  powerful  shield  surrounds  the

palace, which only special persons can enter. Full details of

these  wards  are  known  only  to  High  Lady  Alustriel  and

High Mage Taern Hornblade, but many of their powers can

be summarized here.

The wards are founded on a mythal, one of the very few

such  devices  remaining  in  Faern.  The  boundaries  of  the

outer ward are 1,000 yards outside the newly expanded walls

of Silverymoon. The ward is a sphere extending through air

57

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 58

Cities of the Silver Marches

above and earth below, and governing that part of the River

Rauvin  that  flows  through  it.  The  boundaries  of  the  inner

ward are a dozen feet outside the walls of the High Palace

and the Star Court, encompassing both.

Most  folk  of  Silverymoon  know  that  Alustriel  and  a

small number of trusted allies control the wards, that per-

sons must carry a special token to enter through the wards of

the Palace, that the Moonbridge is linked to the wards, and

that the wards shield Silverymoon from the worst extremes

of the weather in these harsh lands. Only the Spellguard, the

commanders of the Knights in Silver, and a handful of other

trusted agents know more about specific magics empowered

or negated by the wards.

SECRETS OF THE WARDS

The wards obey certain indi-

viduals,  known  as  ward

initiates,  who  are  at-

tuned  to  them.  A

h i g h e r - r a n k i n g

ward  initiate  can

countermand  con-

trol  attempts  by

all  ward  initiates

of lower ranks, re-

gardless  of  their

numbers.  In  de-

scending  order  of

authority,  the  cur-

rent  ward  initiates

are  Alustriel;  her  six

Sisters;  Taern  Horn-

blade;  Jorus  Azuremantle,

leader  of  the  Spellguard;  Sernius

Alathar, commander of the Knights in Silver;

Galaerthus  Irymm,  Master  of  Harper  Hall;

Spellguard  members,  in  descending  order  of  rank;  and

Knights in Silver officers, in descending order of rank. Be-

coming a ward initiate requires one full day, the expendi-

ture of 2,500 experience points on the part of the creature

being  attuned,  and  the  aid  and  awareness  of  Alustriel,

Taern, or one of the deities of magic (Azuth and Mystra).

Silverymoons wards aroint (deny), prevail (apply continu-

ously), and vanguard (make available to ward initiates) cer-

tain spell effects, as described below.

An arointed spell or effect can be cast and exhausted in the

normal  manner  within,  or  into,  the  wardsit  just  doesnt

take effect at all. If any part of the effect impinges on the

wards, its energy is absorbed entirely. The spells arointed by

Silverymoons wards are known to include:

Spells with the death descriptor

Spells with the evil descriptor

Spells with the teleportation descriptor cast by creatures

not carrying a ward token (see below)

Conjuration (summoning) spells cast by creatures not car-

rying a ward token

Evocation  [fire]  spells  cast  by  creatures  not  carrying  a

ward token

Note that the ward against teleportation magic also blocks

the creation of new portals and the operation of existing ones

except for individuals carrying ward tokens.

A prevailing spell or effect functions much like a spell fixed

to  a  hallow  or  unhallow  spell.  The  prevailing spells  of  Sil-

verymoons wards are known to include:

antipathy to  all  evil-aligned  demons,  devils,  dragons,

drow,  duergar,  giants,  goblinoids,  mind  flayers,  orcs,

and trolls.

THE MOONBRIDGE

Control over the Moonbridge is a ward power restricted to

Alustriel, her six Sisters, Taern, Jorus, and Sernius. Any of

them  can  raise  the  bridge  (causing  it  to  rise  from  both

banks to meld at midriver), take it down (causing it to split

and recede into both banks), or erect a wall of force based

on any part of the bridge. Creatures can walk on unjoined

ends of the forming or receding bridge, and are moved with

it if its receding.

The  Moonbridge  is  a  gigantic  force  construct  akin  to  a

wall of forcea smooth, railless span of silver force. Its 14

feet  wide,  2  feet  thick,  and  has  no  apparent  weight  limit

(dragons have perched on it without incident). The Moon-

bridge rises in a gentle arc to a mid-span height of 60 feet

above the river.

THE INNER WARD

The inner ward of Silverymoon, also known as the Vaelun, has

the same properties as the outer ward, plus a few key additional

magics.

In addition to the prevailing spells and effects available in

the outer ward, zone of truth is a prevailing spell throughout

the Vaelun.

In addition to the vanguard spells and effects available in

the outer ward, cure moderate wounds and neutralize poison

are available to all ward initiates in the Vaelun. Forcecage,

heal, and prismatic sphere can be wielded as vanguard spells

by Alustriel or Taern only.

TOKENS

Silverymoons wards have four sorts of tokens, all of them

pierced  (for  wearing  with  necklaces)  silver  items  about  the

size of a large thimble. Its not known how many of

each  token  type  exist,  but  spares  arent  stored

where they can easily be found or reached, even

by  a  skilled  rogue.  No  ward  token  can  ever

physically  leave  the  wardsthe  instant  a

token leaves the wards, it crumbles into use-

less powder. This fate cannot be prevented by

extradimensional  transport  such  as  portals,

planar travel, or attempts to place tokens in ex-

tradimensional places.

Silvaeren  deemed  trustworthy  by

Alustriel  or  Taern  are  given  adrath

tokens  to  keep;  visitors  are  loaned

these tokens, for return upon depar-

ture.  Creatures  who  need  duraph

tokens  to  enter  the  city  must  sat-

isfy the senior officer at the entry

point as to their business, and come

under both armed escort and Spell-

guard  scrutiny  immediately.  Spell-

casters  with  business  inside  the

Vaelun  are  issued  lauthaul  tokens  at

guardposts  when  entering  only  if  a

Spellguard  officer  or  higher-ranking

initiate  deems  it  suitable,  and  those

spellcasters must surrender the tokens

when  leaving  the  inner  ward.  Indi-

viduals  who  need  a  duraph  token  will

never  also  be  allowed  a  lauthaul  token

unless  Alustriel  is  personally  present  to

grant permission.

Taern Hornblade

Adrath  Token: This  sort  of  token  allows

bearers  to  cast  conjuration  (summoning)

spells, evocation [fire] spells, and spells with the teleporta-

tion descriptor in the outer ward areas of Silverymoon, and

use items with those effects. Without the token, castings of

these types of spells are wasted. Adrath tokens are crafted in

the shape of unicorn heads.

Duraph Token: This sort of token negates the antipathy

and  detect  scrying  effects  otherwise  prevalent  in  Silvery-

moons wards. Duraph tokens are diamond-shaped.

Lauthaul  Token: This  token  functions  like  the  adrath

token, except it extends those effects into the inner ward. It

59

allows bearers to cast conjuration (summoning) spells, evoca-

tion [fire] spells, and spells with the teleportation descriptor

in the Vaelun. A small number of lauthaul tokens are keyed

to permit entry into otherwise barred portions of the palace.

Lauthaul tokens look like shields.

Thelbane  Token: Only  a  few  dozen  persons  know  these

tokens exist, and there are believed to be less than ten of the

tokens in existence. Alustriel and Taern carry one each at all

times when in Silverymoon, and several are in the safekeeping

of various Chosen of Mystra. Theyre kept as secret as possible

because bearers can suspend ward powers indefinitely (or rein-

state  them  instantly)  with  a  full-round  action.  Thelbane

tokens  look  like  tiny  six-pointed  stars  depending  from  one

horn of a crescent moon.

Important Sites

Silverymoons walls enclose many grand buildings. No-

table attractions include parks, open marketplaces, li-

braries  that  collectively  rival  Candlekeep,  temples

and shrines to many human, elf, and dwarf gods, and

the Conclave, a newly formed university composed of

schools of magic, music, and learning.

THE HIGH PALACE

A soaring, spired castle of thick stone clad in white

marble, the High Palace lies near the heart

of the city and draws the eye of all who

pass nearby. The merlons of its crenel-

lated  battlements  are  carved  in  the

likeness of unicorns heads. Inside,

the palace features lofty ceilings,

gleaming  marble  floors,  hang-

ing  plants,  tapestries,  and

white  relief-carved  walls

showing  scenes  of  flowers,

vines,  ferns,  and  trees.  The

ever-vigilant  High  Guard,  an

elite  group  of  ninety  palace

guards  in  distinctive  silvered

armor,  and  the  arcane  might

of the Spellguard protect the

High Palace.

The palace features four tall

towers.  The  northern  pair

houses the armories and quarters

of  the  High  Guard,  with  holding

cells beneath. The southernmost, Bright

Lady  Tower,  was  formerly  Alustriels

personal  residence  and  now  belongs  to  High  Mage  Taern.

The  central  tower,  Moonshield,  houses  the  Chambers  of

State in its lower floors and residences for high officials of

the palace in its upper stories.

Visitors  enter  Moonshield  through  the  Unicorn  Gate

in its west wall and ascend the Silver Stair to the Hall of

Greeting, where the steward and his staff greet them and

guide  them  on.  A  mighty  door  leads  east  into  the  lofty

Great Hall. Audience chambers, a banquet hall, and rooms

devoted to the Council of the Marches surround the Great

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 60

Cities of the Silver Marches

Hall.  Two  grand  arches  at  its  prow-shaped  eastern  end

lead to the Silver Throne and the Moon Seat. The High

Lady of the Silver Marches holds court from the Silver

Throne,  and  the  High  Mage  of  Silverymoon  rules  from

the  Moon  Seat.  Behind  the  Silver  Throne  is  the  newest

part  of  the  palace,  a  low  wing  that  houses  Alustriel,  her

heralds, and staff.

Beneath  the  ground-floor  rooms  of  the  palace  are

twelve underground levels. The upper four contain larders,

a superb wine cellar, prison cells, an armory, and Elnarils

Library.  The  fifth  level  holds  a  vast  collection  of  items

that may one day be useful, from keelboats to spire-tops to

long ladders, battering rams, and miles of cable. The sixth

level is the Crypt of the High Mages, where the ruling wiz-

ards of old Silverymoon lie entombed. Entrance to both

areas  is  possible  only  for  those  carrying  special,  keyed

This tall, graybearded mage is a longtime Harper. Until Alus-

triel chose him to succeed her as High Mage of Silverymoon,

he was the founder and leader of the Spellguard of the city.

Grave,  thoughtful,  and  deeply  in  love  with  Alustriel  (as  are

many Silvaeren), his careful conduct of today contrasts sharply

with his reckless youth. Taern tries to avoid confrontation,

reaching decisions through consensus and smoothing over all

that  can  be  smoothed  over.  His  nickname,  Thunderspell,

comes  from  the  deadly  battle-spells  for  which  he  became

known in long-ago magefair duels, and more recently in de-

fense of Silverymoon. Taern works hard at building friend-

ships  with  folk  great  and  unknown,  to  forge  alliances  of

people who can call on each others aid when crises arise.

The  Hornblade: This  famous  weapon  is  a  +3  dancing

spell storing longsword with three unusual properties. First,

as a standard action, the bearer can create a sending to up

to  five  individuals  of  the  bearers  choosing  at  the  same

time. The sending consists of a distinctive, warning horn-

call; no other message is possible.

Second,  the  Hornblade possesses  the  ability  to  store  two

spells, not just one. It otherwise functions as a normal spell

storing weapon. Taern customarily stores dispel evil and heal.

Finally, the blade is attuned to the ward initiates of Sil-

verymoon. In the hands of anyone other than a ward initi-

ate,  the  Hornblade is  only  a  +1  dancing  longsword. This

sword is good, and any evil character attempting to wield it

gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as

long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword

is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in

actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way

while the sword is wielded.

Caster  Level: 18th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms

and Armor, animate objects, imbue with spell ability, send-

ing; Market Price: 227,115 gp; Cost to Create: 113,715 gp

+ 9,072 XP.

lauthaul tokens personally prepared by Alustriel or Taern.

The lowest six levels comprise the High Mages Vault, a

vast  store  of  fabulous  treasure,  magic  items,  and  artifacts.

Only those carrying thelbane tokens can enter the vault, and

even then all other bearers of thelbane tokens are alerted to

the visit through an effect similar to that of an alarm spell.

Any attempt to force entry into the vault alerts all bearers

of thelbane tokens and activates magical defenses of an ex-

traordinarily thorough nature.

THE STAR COURT

A two-story stone building that looks like a gigantic, many-

spired kings crown set on the ground, the Star Court houses

many of the citys bureaucracies and officials. The most im-

portant  offices  found  in  this  grand  structure  include  the

Halls  of  Judgment,  Silverymoons  criminal  courts;    the

Rolls, which holds registration records of permits, land deeds

and transfers, citizenship and taxation, floor plans and sewer

plans of all buildings in the city, and genealogies of current

citizens; and the Halls of Converse, where citizens can com-

plain, debate civic matters, and petition officials for changes

in laws, for something to be done or undone, or that they be

recognized as citizens.

RAUVINWATCH KEEP

About fifteen miles west of Silverymoon, on a great spur of

rock overlooking the Rauvin, stands an old watchtower and

keep  that  dominates  the  river  below.  Raised  two  hundred

years ago to guard Silverymoon against the approach of ene-

mies  by  road  or  river  up  the  Rauvin  Vale,  the  keep  has

always  been  something  of  a  white  elephant,  never  manned

with a full garrison or maintained as well as it should have

been. It has found a new purpose as the headquarters of the

recently formed Argent Legion, the army of the confedera-

tion  of  the  Silver  Marches,  under  the  command  of  Alus-

triels son, High Marshal Methrammar Aerasum (LG male

half elf Ftr7/Wiz9).

More than four hundred soldiers, nearly half the strength

of the Legion, are housed and trained here. Most are Shield-

sar  from  Sundabar,  but  contingents  of  dwarves  from

Mithral Hall and Citadel Felbarr make up a significant por-

tion of the force. The Legion garrison joins with the Knights

in  Silver  in  patrolling  the  lands  west  of  Silverymoon,  but

they spend most of their time training.

MAJOR TEMPLES

The  folk  of  Silverymoon  believe  that  several  benevolent

deitiesMielikki  and  Lurue,  to  name  twowatch  over

their  city.  They  value  the  divine  teachings  and  support  of

both  clerics  and  druids.  Mighty  temples  stand  above  the

city,  their  spires  gleaming  in  the  sun,  while  sacred  groves

and glades lie hidden in the woodlands that still stand in and

around Silverymoon.

The  Halls  of  Inspiration:  A  magnificent,  rectangular

four-towered temple, this building is devoted to Oghma and

Milil.  Its  soaring  spires  hold  libraries,  study  rooms,  and

prayer  chambers,  with  silver  temple  bells  above,  and  guest

apartments  for  visiting  bards  and  worshipers  beneath.  An

open chapel with three levels of balconies joins the towers.

Here visitors can hear some of the most magnificent music

and  lore-tales  anywhere  in  the  North.  Songmaster  Beldor

Thrivvin (NG male human Clr14 of Milil) jointly presides

with  recent  arrival  Lorelord  Ormast  Keldellyn  (LN  male

human  Clr12/Dis3  of  Oghma)  over  a  clergy  dominated  by

skilled bards and loremasters.

The House Invincible: This temple consists of a stark, no-

nonsense keep built for battle, home to the enthusiastic wor-

shipers  of  Helm.  The  Watchers  worship  is  very  popular  in

the  Silver  Marches,  most  notably  among  the  Knights  in

Silver, the High Guard, and the Spellguard. The House Invin-

cible  thrives  under  the  able  guidance  of  Vigilant  Master

Baerim  Coraddor  (LN  male  human  Ftr4/Clr10),  a  charis-

matic,  vigorous  leader  who  ascended  after  his  predecessor

Erssler  Thamm  fell  in  battle  guarding  snowbound  pilgrims

against fiendish wolves. Baerim was marked on the battlefield

with the Hand of Helm, a glowing manifestation sent by the

god, and his fellow war-priests quickly took up his banner.

Mielikkis Glade: An open-air glade sacred to Mielikki, this

place consists of a ring of towering shadowtops surrounding

ferns  and  berry-bushes  that  give  way  to  a  central  floor  of

lush moss. One hollow tree holds a portal linked to a North-

bank house shared by temple clergy. Ladyservant Tathshan-

dra Tyrar (NG female human Clr10 of Mielikki), whose eyes

still  sparkle  despite  her  seventy  summers,  leads  services  in

the  glade  day  and  night.  The  glade  is  known  as  a  spot  of

serenity where divine presence is often felt.

Rhyesters  Matins:  Named  for  the  blind  prophet  who

founded it in 717 DR, this worship-house of Lathander fea-

tures an altar lit by rainbows every dawn, when the suns rays

lance through the stained glass windows in the eastern face

of the temple. Rocked by infighting over who should become

Mornmaster  over  the  temple,  the  congregation  seeks  its

rightful  leader.  Earlier  this  year,  a  thunderous  voice  spoke

from  the  Dawn  Altar  after  the  funeral  of  the  previous

Mornmaster, saying, Take for your leader the one who lays

upon this my altar the rightful sign from me.

Furiously arguing priests believe that the sign must be an

item, probably of great magical power, that is new or repre-

sents a new beginning, and clearly shows the guiding spirit or

personal touch of Lathanderbut what item, and where is

it? Rival claimants for the leadership of this wealthy temple

are busily sponsoring adventurers to scour the Marches for

the rightful signand spies to watch what other claimants

and their agents do. Almost every tenday a new adventuring

band  sets  forth,  and  many  of  them  fight  rival  bands  vi-

ciously in the wilderlands . . . while the faithful wait, and new

claimants, called by the Morninglord, arrive from distant

corners of Faern.

The  Temple  of  Silver  Stars:  A  beautiful  structure  of

curving stone inset with many crystal-and-silver star win-

dows,  this  temple  to  Selne  is  shaped  like  a  single-spired

tiara, its spire to the north and its roofline forming a cres-

cent  moon  when  seen  from  the  streets  around.  Its  clergy

have  been  directed  by  High  Moonmistress  Shalyssa  Luri-

alar  (CG  female  half-elf  Clr13)  to  aid  local  heralds,

Harpers,  and  priests  of  Deneir  in  mapping  the  Marches,

and  many  have  hired  adventurers  as  escorts  against  ma-

rauding monsters.

THE CONCLAVE OF SILVERYMOON

This new university is Alustriels creation, one of her last

acts as High Mage of Silverymoon before stepping down to

assume  broader  responsibilities  as  Speaker  of  the  Silver

Marches. She persuaded several formerly independent cen-

ters of lore and learning to combine into a single institu-

tion in order to share their learning more effectively and

make many fields of study available to their students. The

High Lady personally defrays the costs of housing and tu-

ition for promising students and also sponsors the esoteric

researches  of  a  number  of  loremasters,  allowing  them  to

concentrate on teaching and study.

The Conclave is not a single building or district within the

city. Some parts of the university are located near each other

in a Southbank campus, but other schools remain scattered

across the city.

Arkhens Invocatorium: A school of sorcery (as opposed

to wizardry), this is one of the few institutions of its type

in  all  of  Faern.  Students  study  under  the  infamously

strict  and  sarcastic  Arkhen  the  Icy  (NG  male  human

Sor13),  in  a  new  building  whose  many  furnishings  are

almost all animated constructs under the command of the

Master Sorcerer.

Everdusk  Hall: An  elf  temple  whose  upper  floors  con-

tain rooms upon rooms of genealogies, poetry, records, and

philosophy  of  the  elves,  this  hall  is  administered  by  the

Loremaster  Vadalathra  Rivermantle  (CG  female  sun  elf

Wiz7/Lor6).

The House of the Harp: Once known as the famous Fo-

cluchan  bardic  college,  this  school  stood  empty  for  over  a

century. It has just reopened, and there are plans to restore

its historic name once the Master Bard feels that it lives up

to  its  predecessors  legend.  Right  now,  the  House  of  the

Harp is little more than an endless live-in revel for musi-

cians,  orators,  minstrels,  and  bards,  under  the  guidance  of

the  Master  Bard  Forell  Flamebeard  Luekaun  (CG  male

human Brd11). He hopes this sharing of songs and tales will

enrich all attendees and yield him a faculty with which to

teach novices. Many Harpers are known to mingle with the

merry folk of the House.

The Ladys College: Considered by many to be the heart

of the Conclave, the Ladys College trains wizards not just

in  spellcraft,  but  in  the  history  of  magic.  The  tuition  is

steep500 gp plus 500 gp per wizard level, to a maximum

of 4,000 gp per year for a wizard of 7th level. Wizards of

8th level or higher are not accepted as students, but may

join the college as fellows at a cost of 5,000 gp per year.

Students (and fellows) of 5th level or higher who agree to

spend  half  their  time  serving  in  the  Spellguard  pay  only

half the normal tuition.

Students  are  provided  with  rooms  in  the  colleges  ram-

bling  housing-halls,  and  meals  in  the  colleges  refectory.  If

they elect to dwell off-campus, they of course must provide

their own meals and accommodations. Fellows are not enti-

tled to room and board in the college. The foodand partic-

ularly the wine that goes with itis surprisingly good, and

accompanied by dance, minstrelry, literary readings, or dis-

plays of entertaining illusions.

Many  of  the  Masters  of  Art  (tutors)  are  crusty  or

strange-minded,  but  the  college  teaches  tolerance,  coopera-

tion, and an appreciation for differing philosophies and ap-

proaches to magic. All students are exposed to every school

of spells, to see if they have the desire or aptitude to special-

ize. The college accommodates just over a hundred students

at  a  time,  with  an  ever-lengthening  waiting  list  to  get  in.

Naive hopefuls who show up at the gates are put on the list,

taken  in,  and  taught  to  do  cooking,  laundry,  cleaning,  and

repair  work  around  the  university.  If  they  continue  to  do

such tasks, theyll be given room and board and allowed to

peruse  limited  portions  of  the  Conclave  libraries  on  their

own, until their time comes.

The Map House: A soaring stone keep once owned by the

High  Heralds,  this  building  is  now  part  of  the  Conclave.

The  tower  once  housed  the  Vault  of  the  Sages,  and  it  re-

mains a storehouse of maps and genealogies, most of them

copies  of  precious  originals  kept  elsewhere.  The  general

College Benefits

Why  would  anyone  pay  thousands  of  gold  pieces  for  the

privilege  of  attending  a  wizards  college?  The  answer  is

simple: Attending a wizard college provides access to many

new  spells  (see  Adding  Spells  to  a  Wizards  Spellbook  in

Chapter  10  of  the  Players Handbook)  as  well  as  facilities

for creating items.

First, a student or fellow attempting to learn a new spell

gains a +2 bonus on her Spellcraft checks to do so, provided

she makes the attempt on the college grounds.

Second, once per quarter a student or fellow may add

a spell of her choice to her spellbook for free, just like

the  new  spells  gained  at  each  level.  She  must  spend  a

total of at least 4 hours per day for at least thirty days

during  the  quarter  attending  classes  and  studying  to

gain this benefit.

Third, a student or fellow may copy spells from the col-

leges spellbooks at any time, provided she pays a special fee

equal to half the market price of a scroll of that spell. For

example, a mage who wishes to copy haste from the college

library may do so for a cost of 188 gp.

Finally, a student or fellow may use the colleges labora-

tories  and  libraries  for  creating  magic  items  even  if  she

does not have the appropriate item creation feat. The char-

acter  must  pay  a  special  fee  equal  to  10%  of  the  market

price  of  the  item  she  creates.  The  wizard  must  meet  all

other requirements of the item to be created. For example,

a wizard who wanted to create a wand of lightning bolt de-

spite the fact she does not know the Craft Wand feat could

do so by using the colleges resourcesat a cost of 1,125 gp,

10% of the wands normal market price.

public (guided by the heralds-in-training studying here and

a staff of loremasters) is allowed to browse the maps and

records here for a fee of 5 gp per hour. Materials may not

be removed, and copies can only be ordered by application

to  the  Master  of  the  House.  Heraldry,  genealogy,  and

maps in this collection comprehensively cover all the sur-

face realms of the North and the Heartlands. Coverage of

other areas in Faern is spotty at best. The Map House is

now  presided  over  by  the  famous  sage  Esklindrar  (LN

human male Exp7/Div4), whom Alustriel persuaded to re-

locate  here  by  providing  him  with

personal  copies  of  everything  in

the collection.

bands,  and  gives  them  leads  to

where  old  treasure  may  lie.  In

return,  they  tell  him  what  they

saw  there  and  lend  him  any  writ-

ings  they  gained  so  he  can  make

copies.  He  is  a  personal  friend  of

Alustriel and several other power-

ful  Harpers,  who  would  certainly

take steps to avenge any harm vis-

ited upon him.

Utrumms  Music  Conservatory:

Relocated from the Northbank to a

large, rather nondescript building in

the Southbank campus of the Conclave, this

archive of written music and song scrolls also

houses over forty sound-shielded practice cham-

bers,  where  musicians  can  sing  and  play.  Many

practice alone, but some teaching takes place for

stiff fees. Utrumm is long dead, but the present

faculty of Masters of Music enjoys a good reputa-

tion.  Anyone  (not  just  Conclave  students)  can

rent a practice chamber, for a fee of 1 sp per 2

hours, but must agree to Masters and students lis-

tening in at will, from balconies in every chamber.

Paid  admission  performances  are  forbidden  in  the

Conservatory, but free recitals may be given in either of its

ground-floor Halls of Hearing.

The Vault of the Sages: This massive structure has the

shape  of  a  horseshoe  five  floors  high,  with  five  vast,

labyrinthine dungeon levels beneath. If Candlekeep is the

greatest storehouse of written lore in Faern, the Vault

is  its  greatest  assembly  of  knowledge,  in  the  form  of  a

staff of expert sages and its remarkable library. Its pro-

tected  throughout  by  full  Vaelun  ward  conditions,  with

one  addition:  Entry  beyond  the  Forehall  is  by  duraph

tokens  (regardless  of  alignment)  distributed  by  the

Keeper  of  the  Vault.  Intruders  who  dont  happen  to  be

Jorus, Taern, or Alustriel, or who dont carry a thelbane

or duraph token on their persons, are barred from entry

by an antipathy effect.

The Vault is maintained and guarded by priests of Deneir;

they  reshelve  materials  and  fetch  tomes  from  the  library

levels to examination rooms in the Forehall for a fee of 5 gp

per book. Books dealing with magic cost 10 gp to view, and

requests for spellbooks are met with the flat statement that

Any such volumes in the Vault are not available. No per-

sonal copying of manuscripts or maps is allowed; even carry-

ing in writing materials is forbidden, although Vault scribes

will  write  down  a  readers  brief  verbal

notes as part of the reading fee. Copies can

be ordered at a cost of 50 gp per map or 2

gp  per  page  of  text.  Maps  take  2  days  to

copy  unless  very  large,  and  texts  can  be

copied at 10 pages per day.

The  Keeper  may  offer  to  purchase

valuable  manuscripts  and  literary  frag-

ments  (200  gp  per  century  of  age  is  a

good  guideline  for  the  value  of  an  old

manuscript). If the vendor refuses to sell,

the  Keeper  requests  the  chance  to  copy

the  tome  for  half  the  price,  and  offers

free  room  and  board  in  luxurious  guest

apartments  elsewhere  in  the  Conclave

while the vendor waits for the copying to

be done.

Most  patrons  to  the  Vault  visit  the

open  book  (no  reading  fees)  galleries  on

the  ground  floor  and  the  floor  above  it.

Here  news  of  Faern  is  posted  on  broad-

sheets put up on the walls for all to view,

and  multiple  copies  of  popular  reference

works  such  as  Delbloods  Atlas  of

Faern,  Revendros  Roll  of  the

Passing  Years,  and  Gaurdronts

Guide to Monstrous Beasts are available.

The  third  through  fifth  floors  contain

workrooms  for  the  Vaults  scribes,  illumina-

tors,  and  bookbinders;  study  rooms  for  each

topic  of  learning  (such  as  magic,  history,

alchemy, zoology, and geography); and offices

where sages may be consulted. Sages are seen by

appointment only, and for stiff fees: 50 gp per

hour  of  general  consulting,  which  includes

learned guidance as to what books or experts to

consult and simple definitions and identifications, plus 500

gp  or  more  for  the  furnishing  of  each  specific,  detailed

answer to a difficult question.

The  current  Keeper  of  the  Vault  is  the  impressive  and

mellifluous Haliver Muorin (LN male human Wiz9/Lor7).

Hes assisted at all times by six priests of Deneir (LG human

Clr3 to Clr7) and two Vault guards (LN human Ftr7), and

can call on another pair of guards and 2d12 lesser priests of

Deneir in an emergency.

that  stand  out  as  particularly  splendid  or  useful  include

the following.

A  Handful  of  Stars: Located  in  Northbank,  on

Shadowstars Lane, this shop is staffed by Selnite clergy

and followers. Dimly lit and crammed, the shop is domi-

nated  by  a  glowing  star  chart  on  the  ceiling.  This  shop

sells navigational aids of all kinds, from Sembian astro-

labes  to  timed-burning  candles,  fathom  lines,  surveying

chains,  maps,  nautical  charts,  sunrods,  wands  of  light,

and  lanterns  of  all  sorts.  Maps  cost  40  gp  each  and  are

drawn on good vellum.

Prospectors,  explorers,  dreamers,  and  adventurers  can

always been found here, trading gossip and travel-tales with

the staff.

Optyms Blade: A superb arms shop located in Northbank

on  Many  Cats  Lane,  Optyms  carries  many  masterwork

weapons, especially axes of all sorts. A helmed horror under

the proprietors command guards the shop after hours, and

the proprietor himself suffices to keep order during the days.

Heliosturr Optym (NG male human Ftr4/Exp7) is an expert

knife-thrower,  and  he  stocks  a  huge  selection  of  throwing

knives  and  daggers.  Hes  calm  in  the  face  of  threats  and

danger, keeping a very even temper. Many targets hang in

all corners of the shop for Optym to practice on.

An  energetic  explorer  of  tombs  and  ruins  in  the  North,

Xara  hungrily  seeks  new  magic.  She  funds  such  hunts  by

casting  spells  for  hire  and  selling  potions.  She  enjoys  the

company of adventurers and seems quick to make friends,

but  Xaras  friendship  is  a  passing  thingshe  views  any

friend  as  an  ally  of  convenience  to  be  used  if  useful,

dropped if not, or betrayed if it becomes profitable to do so.

Xara likes to hire bands of adventurers to check out sites

that may or may not be promising, in order to build her

knowledge of places she might attempt to plunder herself.

She deals honestly enough with those she hires, but some-

times sends them into what she already knows to be deadly

peril to see if a little more of the challenges of a particular

site  might  become  known  through  a  partys  strivings  to

escape.  Naturally,  she  expresses  heartfelt  horror  and

sorrow to the survivors of any such expeditions.

Xara has sparkling, dancing green eyes and red-to-honey

hair.  When  dealing  with  customers  or  adventurers  she

hopes  to  hire,  she  favors  black  corsets  worn  over  plain

purple, green, or dark brown gowns. When shes working,

she likes to use alter self or polymorph self, in conjunction

with misdirection or nondetection, to completely change her

appearance and conceal her identity.

Cities of the Silver Marches

The  Shining  Scroll: The  crumbling  stone  steps  of  this

long,  narrow  shop  on  Brightbuckler  Street  in  Northbank

lead up to a royal blue circular wooden door painted with

many  complex  (and  meaningless)  runelike  silver  symbols.

Inside  is  a  stool  for  patrons  to  wait  on,  a  small  space  for

them to stand or pace in, and a counter with shelves of po-

tions  and  scrolls.  At  any  given  time  1d6+10  random  po-

tions and 2d6+10 random arcane scrolls (level 1d61) are

in stock.

The  friendly  proprietress,  Xara  Tantlor,  sits  behind  the

counter unless she has closed the shop to escort clients down

into her large cellar, where she casts spells for fees (see Table

79  in  the  Players  Handbook).  Her  familiar  Villynk,  a

raven, perches in odd spots in and around the shop and keeps

a wary eye on all customers.

Xara  and  her  familiar  are  not  what  they  appear  to  be.

While she poses as an industrious wizard who supports her-

self through her magic shop, she is actually an expert bur-

glar, tomb plunderer, and free agent for hireone who is

not particularly choosy about the jobs she takes. Villynk is

an imp, one of whose alternate forms happens to be that of

a raven. Xaras shop is more well defended than it appears,

too.  Though  she  protects  herself  primarily  with  her  spells

and personal magic items, Xara can slide back a section of

her countertop to reveal a symbol of hopelessness beneath. A

second sliding countertop section uncovers a symbol of sleep

(she obtained the symbols by way of payment for a danger-

ous job well done). Xara also has several scrolls of explosive

runes  and  sepia  snake  sigil  mixed  in  with  the  more  useful

scrolls for sale.

Sundabar

This  double-walled,  circular  fortress  city  is  famous  for  its

miners, master smiths, and woodcarvers. Its a harsh, treeless

place,  characterized  by  one  visitor  as  all  stone  and  suspi-

cion. A heavily guarded volcanic rift beneath Sundabar, the

Everfire, is the source of many magic weapons.

The other citizens of Sundabar are too numerous and di-

verse to enumerate here.

Notable  Imports: Food  (especially  grain,  livestock,  and

fruit, which is highly prized), lumber, and textiles.

Notable  Exports: Armor,  clay  wares  (mostly  pipes  and

tiles),  copper,  furniture,  gold,  lumber,  pelts,  silver,  tools,

weapons.

One of Faerns wealthiest and most warlike cities, Sundabar

is  a  former  dwarf  citadel  that  has  grown  into  a  frowning

fortress. Famed for wood and metal exports, it serves as the

military  bulwark  of  civilization  in  the  North.  Sundabar

boasts many defenses against the orc hordes that plague the

North, and has broken the onslaught of several major inva-

sions. First are its two ring-walls, bolstered by an icy moat

between them reputedly roamed by man-eating eels. Next are

the citys capable and well-armed defenders, the Shieldsar, a

standing  army  two  thousand  strong.  Beyond  the  Shieldsar

stand the citys numerous dwarf allies, stout warriors from

the  Fardrimm  beneath  the  Everfire.  Finally,  Sundabars

deep coffers are frequently used to hire mercenaries and ad-

venturers whenever necessary. Sundabar is well provisioned

against a siege of many months, as vast granary caverns lie

near  the  Everfire,  and  deep  city  wells  tap  the  clear,  fresh

subterranean lake Anfarra.

Vigilance is the watchword of Sundabarian life. Outsiders

are watched and viewed with suspicion. Those who seem too

inquisitive or travel about the city too energetically are ques-

tioned by the Stone Shields, the city watch. The Stone Shields

police the city under the command of the Watchblade, which

also oversees a shadowy network of spies known to citizens as

the  Watchful.  The  Stone  Shields  wont  hesitate  to  forcibly

escort  suspicious  persons  to  the  citys  two  large  temples,

where clerics of Helm or Tyr assist in the questioning with

spells such as discern lies or zone of truth.

Stone  Shields  and  Watchful  who  grow  careless,

overzealous,  or  too  friendly  with  shadier  citizens  are

transferred  to  the  Shieldsar.  In  turn,  the  armys  prob-

lem members are often transferred to the Watchblades

forces.  The  Shieldsar,  commanded  by  the  Warblade,  sees

to  wall  defenses  and  patrols  throughout  the  Sundabar

Vale.  A  Shieldsar  patrol  rides  the  wilderlands  in  full

armor, armed with longspears, swords, daggers, battleaxes,

and shortbows. They get to know their patrol areas very

65

Cities of the Silver Marches

well,  scouring  every  cave  and  hill-hollow.  Shieldsar  leaders

are  always  wary  of  being  outflanked  or  ambushed,  setting

scouts on all sides as they patrol.

Brief History

In the days of the dwarf kingdom of Delzoun, Sundabar was

a  mighty  dwarf  citadel.  The  dwarves  of  Delzoun  built  a

great underground city here sometime around 500 DR to

take advantage of the Everfire, a volcanic rift in the Un-

derdark.  Citadel  Sundbarr,  like  Adbar  to  the  north,  was

mostly subterranean, with only a few structures on the sur-

face.  The  heart  of  the  dwarfhold  lay  in  the  immense

foundries around the fiery rift, a source of heat so large and

intense that works of the most massive scale and most diffi-

cult alloys could be accomplished here.

Sundbarr.  Determined  not  to  break  his  holds  isolation  of

centuries,  the  ruler  of  Sundbarr  discovered  he  could  not

ignore the plight of the hopelessly outnumbered humans on

his doorstep. Dwarf and human joined together to drive off

the demons. During the battle, Prince Astalm gave his own

life to save the Forgemaster, and in gratitude the Forgemas-

ter offered the humans a home in the abandoned surface por-

tions of the citadel.

In  the  five  centuries  since  that  day,  human  and  dwarf

have  flourished  together.  The  humans  rebuilt  the  surface

keeps and  strongholds,  and  went  on  to  raise  mighty  walls

around their city. The trade and commerce they attracted

gave  the  dwarves  markets  for  their  handiwork  and  en-

riched all. Citadel Sundbarr, the insular dwarfhold, became

the city of Sundabar, a bulwark of military strength and

trade in the North.

Sundbarr survived the fall of Delzouns vast Underdark

realm in the Year of the Black Unicorn by turning the awe-

some  power  of

the  Everfire  to

the  citys  de-

fense.

Safe

behind  walls  of

molten  metal,

master

the

founders

iso-

lated themselves

from  the  lands

about.  Over

time, Sundbarrs

strength  dwin-

dled  as  its  folk

became  less  nu-

merous  and  the

mighty  lore  of

old  was  forgot-

ten.  Marauding

orcs  and  mon-

sters  plundered

the  surface  por-

tions  of  the  city

time and time again during the centuries between 329 DR,

the year in which Hlondath fell, and 882 DR, the year in

which Ascalhorn, Ammarindar, and Eaerlann succumbed to

an army of demons.

Orc  hordes  driven  from  their  homes  by  the  demons  by-

passed  Citadel  Sundbarr,  since  nothing  worth  destroying

stood  on  the  surface  and  the  underground  foundries  were

still guarded by the Everfire, impregnable to orc assault. In

the aftermath of Ascalhorns fall, Prince Simberuel Astalm,

one  of  the  high  captains  of  that  city,  gathered  up  a  small

number of the survivors and led them to safety. Threatened

on all sides by demons pillaging the Delimbiyr Vale, Astalm

turned  north  and  brought  his  people  over  Turnstone  Pass,

closely pursued by a flock of vrocks intent on finishing off

the refugees.

Near the buried dwarf citadel, Astalm and his men were

brought to bay by the pursuing fiends. Doom seemed certain,

but then an unexpected ally appearedthe Forgemaster of

66

As  the  human  population  grew,  Sundabars  strength

shifted  from  the  forgemasters  of  the  dwarf  city  to  the

master  mer-

chants  of  the

human  city.  A

Ruling  Master

of  the  guilds

and  merchants

came  to  wield

more

power

than the Forge-

master.  Today,

the  Forgemas-

ter is the leader

of  the  dwarf

community  in

Sundabar  and

an  important

advisor  to  the

Ruling  Master,

but  the  Ruling

Master  guides

the  city  for

good  or  ill.  Be-

neath  the  Ruling

Master,  wealthy  guilds  of  craftsfolk,  miners,  and  mer-

chants feud and squabble for advantage and more wealth.

Helm  Dwarf-friend  became  the  sixth  Ruling  Master  of

the  city  in  1355  DR,  after  his  predecessor  died  fighting

against orcs assailing the citys defenses. He has done much

to  curb  the  infighting  of  the  citys  guildmasters  and  clear

away the corruption of previous reigns.

Important Sites

Sundabar is a city of cobbled streets and slate-roofed, three-

story stone houses that have tall, narrow shuttered windows,

thick walls, and stout, ironbound doors that can be barred as

well  as  bolted.  Out  of  these  miniature  fortresses  rise  some

residences and at least one inn (Baldivers) that can function

as keeps if the city is ever invaded. Trees are few, windowbox

herb-gardens being the only visible growing things.

In  winter,  Sundabarian  houses  are  cold  and  damp.

Cities of the Silver Marches

Snow  heaped  high  in  the  streets  melts  in  the  sun  and

seeps into the stones and the earth beneath. Most house

cellars  hold  mushroom  crops  and  are  crammed  with

rodent-proof  food  casks;  older  Sundabarians  remember

hungry winters all too well.

Sawmills and paddocks lie outside the walls, but caravans

need  not  form  up  or  disperse  unprotected:  roads  lead

straight in from Rivergate (west), Eastgate (east), and Turn-

stone Gate (southeast) to a central location in the heart of

the city known simply as the Circle. No market stalls are al-

lowed  to  encroach  into  this  great  open  space  surrounding

the Masters Hall. Caravans assemble in the Circle, and if an

orc  horde  should  attack,  local  shepherds  can  drive  their

herds into the Circle, so the city will have food enough to

withstand a siege.

THE MASTERS HALL

The Masters Hall is a crowded cluster of huge round stone

towers, their battlements bristling with heavy catapults and

ballistae. Sundabar expects attacks and stands ready for them,

and calls itself the rock that shatters orc skulls and dragon

jaws alike (as the now-dead Master Thulntarn once put it).

An elite company of two hundred Shieldsar known as the

Masters Guard mans the Masters Hall. Offices of many dif-

ferent boards, guilds, and councils crowd the building. While

Helm has taken many steps toward simplifying Sundabars

confusing scheme of customs, regulations, and duties, he still

must  contend  with  hundreds  of  scheming  guildsfolk  who

hope  to  legislate  some  small  advantage  for  their  craft  or

trade through his offices.

THE EVERFIRE AND THE UNDERCITY

Steep, winding passages lead down and down to the Everfire,

a volcanic rift beneath the city. Once surrounded by mighty

foundries, the Everfire burns unchained nowmany of the

great forges that harnessed the rifts might were destroyed

more  than  a  hundred  years  ago  by  a  sudden  surge  of  the

buried  fires,  and  most  of  these  have  not  been  rebuilt.  The

The sixth Ruling Master of Sundabar is the former War-

captain of the Bloodaxe Mercenary Company. He won the

leadership  of  the  company  by  the  acclaim  of  his  fellow

Bloody  Blades  after  many  reckless  predecessors  died  in

battle or tavern brawls. His valiant fighting to defend the

city  brought  him  the  same  popularity  with  Sundabarians.

When  Master  Embaeris  died  of  his  wounds,  the  people

clamored for their hero, Helm.

For once, the popular choice turned out to be the right

one. Helm swept away a welter of corruption and confusing

laws  and  taxes  that  had  built  up  under  previous  Masters

(Mantrel  Darkdagger  in  particular),  and  established  the

Masters Take, a flat 5% sales tax. Merchants pay it will-

ingly  because  Helm  uses  every  copper  for  Sundabars  de-

fenses, patrols, and civic projects for the common benefit.

His firm hand and alert attention to looming problems has

led to a reputation as a firm, wise ruler.

A devout Mielikkian, Helm believes three trees should

be planted for every one cut, lest woodcarvers entirely con-

sume the forests they depend on. He also holds that hunt-

ing should be for the table, not sport, and done with care,

nurturing the land. Orcs are vermin, to be obliberated so

the natural balance can be restored. If humans dwell any-

where  in  numbers,  they are  inevitably  the  greatest  preda-

tors,  and  should  eliminate  others  (monsters)  so  that

lesser creatures dont become overhunted.

Firm  and  blunt,  Helm  is  an  ambitious  war-leader.  To

survive,  defenses  must  be  strongbut  to  flourish  in  the

North,  humans  must  establish  a  balanced  realm  of  mili-

tary, commercial, and spiritual strength. Helm seems to be

the man who can raise sword to make it happen, so he must

and shall.

Cities of the Silver Marches

dwarves of Sundabar give the Everfire plenty of room now,

and raise no permanent workshops or foundries too close to

the rift.

A  small  company  of  elite  dwarf  warriors  known  as  the

Vigilant guards access to the Everfire at all times, aided by

traps that harness that portion of the rifts power that is safe

to use. In strong halls beneath the city, clans of master forg-

ers, smelters, smiths, and armorers make up most of Sund-

abars dwarf population. In the past, there have been times

when dwarfhuman relations were strained in Sundabar, but

the dwarves trust Helm implicitly.

Citadel Felbarr

Pried from the filthy hands of warring orc tribes, this moun-

tain stronghold is racing against time to rebuild its defenses

before its enemies return.

The  citadels  mark  is  a  combination  of  the  kings  per-

sonal symbol and that used by his patron deity, Clangeddin

Silverbeard.  It  is  a  gold  crown  decorated  with  three  sap-

phires, resting atop the blades of a pair of crossed

dwarven waraxes.

NOTABLE BUSINESSES

Visitors  will  find  over  a  dozen  superb

woodcarvers  and  carpentry  shops

around the Circle. Sundabar boasts

dozens of workers in wood and as

many smiths who are capable of

masterwork. Its taverns tend to

be rough or rundown. Inns tend

to  be  spartan;  the  exceptions

here  are  Baldivers  (a  sprawl-

ing castle where old warriors

are  welcomed,  and  quiet

guests  preferred),  The

Firestar  Chariot  (a  place  of

loud  revelry  every  night),  Mal-

shyms  House  (a  quiet,  clean,  place

popular with visiting merchants), and The

Trumpet  (a  luxurious  place  where  guests

requesting  privacy  are  left  alone,  popular

with adventurers).

MAJOR TEMPLES

As one might expect, the worship of militant

deities  and  those  deities  who  stand  for  law,

strength, and duty is popular in Sundabar. Tem-

ples to most deities in the dwarven pantheon, par-

ticularly  Moradin,  can  be  found  in  the  hidden

halls of the undercity.

The  Hall  of  Everlasting  Justice: Sundabars  temple  to

Tyr  and  Torm  is  a  fortresslike  building  facing  on  the

Circle,  across  from  the  Masters  Hall.  The  clerics  serve

with the Shieldsar, providing healing and battle-magic for

the  soldiers  of  Sundabar.  Defender  of  Justice  Lathkiera

Morlund  (LG  female  human  Clr9  of  Tyr)  leads  the

temple.  She  recently  succeeded  Triandial  Truthammer  as

Defender, after her predecessor vanished while engaged in

a  perilous  adventure.  Morlund  is  known  as  Lady  Stone

locally for her cold, bitter manner.

The  Hall  of  Vigilance: The  local  house  of  Helm,  this

building  is  both  austere  and  imposing.  It  is  overseen  by

Winterlord  Senior  Steeleye  Mraskin  Thoelaunth  (LN

male human Clr10), who like Morlund of Tyrs temple re-

cently rose to his post after his predecessor left. Like his

counterpart  in  the  Temple  of  Tyr,  the  Winterlord  has  a

nickname  tooOld  Grimfist.  He  harbors  a  special

hatred for orcs, and does everything in his power to sup-

port adventurers willing to rout out orc lairs.

From its exterior, which is visible from much of the length

of the narrow roadway that winds upward through the south-

ern  reaches  of  the  orc-infested  Rauvin  Mountains,  Citadel

Felbarr appears to be little more than a large doorway cut

into  the  mountainside.  Its  simple  appearance  is  deceptive,

however,  for  the  approach  is  guarded  well,  and  behind  the

rune-carved  stone  gates  lies  a  once-beleaguered  dwarf-city

now well on its way to full recovery.

Brief History

The recent history of Citadel Felbarr is detailed in the FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign  Setting. Since  the  followers  of

King Warcrown freed the stronghold from the claws of the

orcs, they have devoted themselves to restoring their home

to its former stature. They rose to the challenge admirably,

repairing the damage caused by the former inhabitants while

simultaneously improving its defenses and security. So great

has been the industry of his followers that King Warcrown

was able to reopen some of the mines in the Felbarr Fields.

Since joining the league of the Silver Marches, Citadel Fel-

barr  has  enjoyed  the  additional  support  of  human  crafters

and soldiers, and with their help the king hopes that the re-

maining mines will soon be reopened as well. So far, none of

the many orc or goblin tribes that teem in the Rauvins have

tried the citadels renewed defenses, but every citizen of the

fortress knows that it is only a matter of time before they

will clash again with their ancient foes.

In  addition  to  the  dwarves  under  King  Warcrown,  a  de-

tachment of two hundred soldiers of the Argent Legion is

currently posted here. About half are sturdy dwarf infantry

from  Citadel  Adbar,  and  the  rest  are  Knights  in  Silver.

Under  the  command  of  the  paladin  Jandar  Starblade,  the

Argent  Legion  company  vigorously  patrols  the  nearby

Moonlands and the Rauvin foothills.

Important Sites

The  following  locations  are  among  those  that  adventurers

will most likely see and visit in Citadel Felbarr.

1. THE HAMMER

One  of  the  first  projects  that  the  dwarves  undertook  after

taking the fortress was the restoration of these two 40-foot-

high stone gate towers that straddle the road to the citadel

itself.  With  its  new  gate  in  place  and  its  walls  recently

strengthened,  the  Hammer  is  nearly  finished.  When  com-

pleted, it will once again be Felbarrs first line of defense.

Beyond the Hammer, the dwarves of Felbarr are raising

a second set of gates known as the Anvil. When completed

next summer, this pair of 30-foot-high gate towers will be

the  smaller  twins  of  The  Hammer.  The  west  tower  is  al-

ready finished and in use.

2. THE VIGILS

Not content to rely on towers and gates for defense, King

The battle for the citadel

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 70

Cities of the Silver Marches

Warcrown ordered the construction of these platforms high

on the eastern slopes above the approach road. Both feature

low protective stone walls, barracks for soldiers, and ranged

weaponry. The South Vigil is completed, and holds a battery

of heavy catapults and ballistae. The North Vigil is sched-

uled for completion before the first snow of this year (1372

DR)  and  currently  holds  only  a  single  ballista.  The  South

Vigil is connected to its mate via an underground passage.

The North Vigil is connected to the main citadel by means

of a stone bridge that spans the Felbarr Stream.

3. THE RUNE GATE

The dwarves greatest accomplishment following their reoc-

cupation  of  the  citadel  was  the  rebuilding  of  its  massive

stone  doorway.  A  pair  of  stone  doors,  each  20  feet  square

and 3 feet thick, rest on nested hinges within an inset door-

frame.  The  doors  and  doorframe  are  covered  with  runes

drawn by King Warcrown himself and imbued with deadly

spells by Unnal Hornwinder. There are a total of thirty-two

runes  on  the  doors  and  frame:  four  blade  barrier,  four

dictum, six hold monster, six holy smite, six holy word, and six

orders wrath. All the runes are permanent until dispelled,

and  are  triggered  by  the  passage  of  evil  goblinoids  or  orcs

(except for dictum and holy word, which are also triggered

by the passage of evil dragons and outsiders).

THE FELBARR FIELDS

The wilderness area in the vicinity of the citadel is known as

the Felbarr Fields. The gold and mithral mines, first opened

and  worked  many  dwarf  generations  ago,  are  scattered

throughout  the  Fields.  All  fell  into  disuse,  and  many  were

lost  completely  during  the  years  of  the  orcish  occupation.

King Warcrowns followers have reopened some of the more

easily located mines, and precious ore flows once again into

the gates of the citadel (and back out again, mostly via cara-

van to Citadel Adbar for refining).

THE LOWROAD

Carved  in  centuries  past  through  solid  bedrock  by

Netherese arcanists, a vast subterranean highway runs east

from the depths of Citadel Felbarr to Ascore and beyond

into  the  Buried  Realms  beneath  Anauroch.  Spurs  lead

north  to  Citadel  Adbar  and  south  to  the  depths  below

Sundabar.  The  western  reaches  of  the  Lowroad  are  still

used by dwarf caravans.

Citadel Adbar

This mighty redoubt is the northernmost signatory to the

confederation of the Silver Marches. Despite its remote lo-

cation, it is an active trading city. The citadels badge is the

personal  forge  mark  of  its  ruler,  King  Harbromm:  an  up-

right, single-bladed hand axe enclosed by a circle of flame,

inscribed in red on a silver field.

The citys army, the legendary Iron Guard, is one of the

strongest  bodies  of  soldiers  in  northern  Faern.  Patrols

mounted on warponies guard the surface approaches to the

citadel  for  a  days  travel  in  all  directions,  and  sometimes

range  even  farther  afield  to  secure  the  road  for  caravans

bound to or from Citadel Adbar.

The other citizens of Citadel Adbar are too numerous and

diverse to enumerate here.

The portion of this mighty stronghold that rises above the

surface of the ground is visible for miles around, due to the

stinking clouds of smoke and flame that belch forth from

the venting tower of its main foundry. Built atop a spur of

solid rock, the granite walls and towers of the upper levels

of  the  fortress  command  an  impressive  view  of  the  sur-

rounding  countryside,  making  it  difficult  for  enemies  to

approach undetected.

Huge, wicked barbs protrude from its uppermost towers as

a  deterrent  to  dragons  and  other  flying  opponents.  Con-

centric rings of deep pits and high walls, that can be defended

one-by-one, encircle the surface works. Dozens of defensive

platforms line the surface walls, from which defenders train

siege engines, fire crossbows, and cast spells down upon the

heads  of  would-be  assailants.  Overlying  all  is  the  constant

stink of hot metal. In short, it is clear even to the untrained

eye that Citadel Adbar is ready for war, and that its residents

do not welcome visitors.

The  subterranean  areas  of  the  fortress  are  no  less  well

defended, and a good deal more extensive. Countless miles

of  passages,  rooms,  chambers,  and  mines  (many  of  them

70

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 71

Cities of the Silver Marches

rigged  with  traps  to  contain  or  kill  intruders)  wind  and

twist their way under the solid rock into which the strong-

hold is built.

There is ample space for many thousands of dwarves to

live comfortably for extended periods of time in the under-

ground chambers. However, they were built by dwarves for

dwarves. Most other folk find the underground portions of

the city uncomfortable, not to mention cramped, and elves

find them positively depressing.

Brief History

The citadel is named after its builder, King Adbar, who con-

structed  the  place  over  a  thousand  years  ago  as  the  last

hurrah  of  Delzoun,  the  ancient  dwarf  Northkingdom.  The

stronghold has since then been besieged nearly one hundred

times by orc hordes, some reputedly as large as one hundred

thousand warriors strong. No enemy force has ever taken the

citadel, howeverKing Adbars folk built the stronghold to

withstand even prolonged sieges, and successive generations

of dwarves have only improved and modified the defenses of

the original builders.

Today  the  stronghold  produces  fine  metalwork  for

trade throughout the North. Its weapons, armor, tools, and

building materials are considered among the best available,

and it is a mark of status among some communities to bear

arms forged here. Adbar is remote and insular; the dwarves

of Citadel Adbar are seldom seen in other areas of the Silver

Marches, except when traveling on their kings business or

patrolling the mountain slopes near their home.

King  Harbromm  was  initially  opposed  to  conjoining

Citadel Adbar with the Silver Marches confederation. He

saw no benefit in it for Citadel Adbar and believed that he

could best safeguard his folk by maintaining a strict policy

of isolationism. He changed his opinion when a delegation

headed by Emerus Warcrown and Bruenor Battlehammer

visited him to illustrate the benefits to be gained from the

league.  Although  Harbromm  still  has  his  doubts,  Citadel

Adbar  is  now  the  primary  source  of  the  confederations

military  ordnance,  and  a  regular  (if  somewhat  reluctant)

participant in its government.

Important Sites

Citadel  Adbar  is  designed  to  keep  its  inhabitants  secure

against any attack an enemy might launch. Hence, many of

its most important locations are defensive features used in

times of siege or battle.

When he stands on the topmost levels of Citadel Adbar and

scans  the  encircling  mountains,  Harbromm  is  not  merely

taking  the  air  or  enjoying  the  awesome  grandeur  of  the

view. He is waiting for the savage hordes of the mountains

to appear before his home. Harbromm knows that he was

born for that day, for that battle, and until it comes he in-

tends to do all within his power to ensure that Citadel Adbar

is made ready for the fight. He has already started to instill

this philosophy in the minds of his twin sons, Bromm and

Harnoth, twins born in the wake of the Thunder Blessing.

It  is  this  conviction  and  determination  that  prompted

the dwarf-king to accept the invitation to join his holdings

to the Silver Marches. He intends to gain as much as he can

from the confederation while exposing his stronghold to as

little  risk  as  possible.  In  exchange  for  selling  arms  and

armor  to  the  confederation  signatories  at  preferential

prices, Harbromm gains valuable intelligence about what is

occurring  in  the  area.  So  far,  this  seems  an  acceptable

arrangement, particularly since it may one day give Citadel

1. THE CARAVAN DOOR

Far below the surface, a pair of massive iron doors opens into

the  endless  corridors  and  caverns  of  the  Fardrimm,  the

buried  heart  of  fallen  Delzoun.  Through  these  dark  miles

stretches an underground caravan route from the citadel all

the  way  to  Mithral  Hall  (and  from  there  on  to  Mirabar).

Another  tunnel  leads  to  the  Lowroad  that  stretches  from

Felbarr to the ruins of Ascore. The enormous entrance is un-

locked and opened only when caravans approach, and even

then the doors stand open only long enough for the wagons,

animals, and travelers to be ushered safely inside. There are

never less than thirty dwarf soldiers on guard duty here at

all times, including highly skilled

veterans  and  battle-ready  clerics

of  Clangeddin  Silverbeard  or

Gorm Gulthyn.

The guards welcome legitimate

caravans  and  known  friends,  but

all others are treated with a cau-

tion that borders on outright sus-

picion. Caravans led by merchants

who  have  never  called  at  the

citadel  before  are  subject  to  a

thorough  search,  and  may  be  re-

quired  to  depart  immediately

after  completing  their  business.

Many first-time visitors on legiti-

mate  business  never  see  more  of

the  citadel  than  the  rooms  and

passages  in  the  immediate  vicin-

ity of the caravan door.

Travelers  who  cannot  give  a

satisfactory  account  of  them-

selves  are  either  turned  away  or

obliged to cool their heels in one

of  the  many  lower  waiting

chambers  until  someone  in  au-

thority  decides  to  either  permit

them  to  enter,  turn  them  away,

or  execute  them  as  enemies  and

spies.  Adventuring  parties  with-

out  acceptable  credentials  have  been

known to remain in custody for as much as a

tenday before someone decides their fate.

tracking, and underground lore, the Deepscouts are the citys

first picket line against the approach of subterranean threats.

2. THE ORE MINES

The dwarf miners of Citadel Adbar delve for ores in a veri-

table catacomb of mines located deep under the lowest habi-

tats  of  the  fortress.  The  dwarves  convey  the  ores  they

retrieve  from  the  earth  upward,  to  the  foundry  and

smelter,  for  refining.  Visitors  and  nonresidentseven

those  whom  the  inhabitants  consider  trusted  associates

are never shown the entrance to the mines except in time

of  direst  emergency.  So  extensive  are  the  mine  workings

that  it  is  entirely  possible  for

the  unwary  or  unprepared  to

become hopelessly lost therein.

The  dwarves  have  prepared

secret  rooms,  passages,  and

chambers  (stocked  with  sup-

plies,  of  course)  within  the

mine  should  the  day  come

when they must use the work-

ings as a place of refuge.

3. THE FOUNDRY AND

SMELTERS

The  uppermost  levels  of  the

citadel  hold  the  vast  metal

smelters  and  foundry  in  which

the  dwarves  create  the  trade

goods for which they are justifi-

ably  famous  throughout  the

North.  This  place  is  seldom

quiet,  except  during  times  of

worship or special feast days.

The Great Wheel: A gigan-

tic  water  wheel  spins  end-

lessly  in  the  depths  of  the

citadel,  powering  the  machin-

ery  on  which  the  dwarves  rely

for  mining,  smelting,  and  de-

fense. A contingent of no fewer

than ten soldiers led by a cleric and a

veteran  captain  guards  the  wheel  against

saboteurs at all times.

Harbromm, Lord of Adbar

The  guards  are  capable  of  warning  the  stronghold  of

danger  by  using  an  ingenious  speaking  tube  device  that

carries their shouted voices into numerous other rooms on

this  level.  Dwarves  who  hear  the  warning  repeat  it  into

tubes located on their own levels. The entire citadel can be

altered to imminent danger in just 10 rounds.

The huge, vaulted chamber into which arriving caravans

are  directed  has  a  trapped  floor  which,  if  triggered,  drops

everything  standing  on  it  into  a  40-foot-deep  pit  that  fills

with water at the rate of 8 feet per round. Entire caravans

led by enemies have been admitted into the citadel only to be

destroyed in this fashion.

From  this  gate  the  Citadels  legendary  Deepscouts  set

forth  to  spy  on  the  surrounding  Underdark  domains.  An

elite force of veteran rangers and rogues skilled in stealth,

The Hall of Moradins Forge: Neat the Great Wheel lies

the Hall of Moradins Forge, the citys largest and most im-

portant  temple.  The  temple  is  virtually  a  fortress  within  a

fortress, guarded by mammoth gates and impenetrable walls.

Its  defenders,  an  elite  order  of  clerics,  paladins,  and  monks

known  as  the  Hammers  of  Moradin,  frequently  lend  their

holy strength to the Iron Guard in times of danger. Rorann

Stonehammer  (NG  male  shield  dwarf  Clr17  of  Moradin)

leads the Hall. He is one of Harbromms most trusted advi-

sors and companions.

4. DRAGONSPIKES

The  towers  of  the  citadel,  including  the  foundrys  venting

tower, are crowned with enormous iron spikes. These spikes,

sharpened to a fine point, are intended to discourage dragons

72

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 73

Cities of the Silver Marches

and  other  flying  creatures  from  landing  on  the  towers.  A

Large or larger creature that flies into a spike is subject to

attack. (The spikes are Gargantuan longspears braced against

a charge.)

Dragonspike: CR 6; no attack roll necessary (2d8+5 points

of damage, doubled if creature is charging or diving); Reflex

save (DC 20) avoids.

5. IRONBOOT TOWER

Even  during  the  strongholds  most  desperate  battles  and

blackest moments, its rulers have never deemed the need so

great that this awesome trap was activated. The entirety of

Ironboot Tower is riggedfastened to the main body of the

citadel by massive iron pins so that it can be separated from

and fall away from the rest of the citadel, burying creatures

beneath it under countless tons of stone and metal.

Activating the trap requires two dozen dwarves to simul-

taneously operate the machines that remove the pins. Five

minutes after the machines are set in motion, the pins are

pulled free and the tower plummets.

King  Adbar  himself  was  prepared  to  utilize  the  device

only once during his long reign, when an army of more than

thirty  thousand  orcs  besieged  the  fortress  with  the  aid  of

giants, trolls, and a pair of blue dragons. Sergeant Gulfwyr

Ironboot and his squad volunteered to remain in the tower,

firing their crossbows into the enemy troops below, so that

their opponents would not become suspicious (as they might

if  the  tower  were  evacuated  completely  in  preparation  for

springing  the  trap).  Ironboots  sacrifice  was  forestalled  by

the arrival of an allied army under the command of Sigrid

Giantflayer Rockhome that lifted the siege. But the tower

has borne the captains name henceforth, in memory of his

selfless bravery.

Falling Tower Trap: CR 20; treat as a landslide or ava-

lanche  (see  Chapter  3  of  the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide).

All  creatures  within  a  160-foot  radius  of  the  base  of  the

tower  are  considered  to  be  within  the  bury  zone;  and  all

creatures more than 160 feet but less than 220 feet away

from the base of the tower are considered to be within the

slide zone.

Deadsnows

Deadsnows is a large village situated in an alpine valley that

is located in the steep foothills on the northernmost side of

the Nether Mountains. From the Fork Road, travelers and

caravans take a narrow cart track that winds its way upward

through  the  wild,  craggy  foothills  and  ends  at  the  village.

Heavy snows sometimes make negotiating this pass difficult

in the winter months, but even when clear the path can be

treacherousdire  bears,  orc  brigands,  and  worse  creatures

infest this territory all year round.

The  towns  symbol  is  a  single  green  conifer  tree  on  a

white field.

The village of Deadsnows is discussed in greater detail in

Chapter 8. It is the focal point of the Blood and Gold

adventure.

The  village  consists  of  perhaps  two  hundred  wooden

buildings encircled by a stone wall that is in need of repair.

Outside  the  wall,  an  impromptu  collection  of  tents  and

other  makeshift  shelters  has  sprung  up  in  recent  months,

following the big gold strike (see below). Not far from the

town  walls,  the  valley  slopes  upward  dramatically,  quickly

giving  way  to  hillsides  that  alternate  between  stands  of

conifers  and  rocky  outcroppings  through  which  swift

streams plunge and race.

Nearer the village, the valley walls have been cleared to

created upland pastures for sheep and cattle. Beyond the hills

the Nether Mountains rear sharply into the sky, their mist-

shrouded  and  snowy  peaks  fully  visible  only  on  those  rare

days when the sun prevails in this cold land.

Brief History

Located  among  the  crags  of  mountain  country  near  the

trails left by dire wolves and hunting dragons sits an outpost

of  some  five  hundred  thirty  humans  and  dwarves.  Dead-

snows began its existence as the keep of a human lord who

dreamed  of  establishing  a  kingdom.  His  vision  was  crushed

under the weight of countless orc raids. The village is named

for  the  battle  that  killed  its  founder,  a  winter  skirmish  in

which the snows of the nearby fields ran red with the blood

of attackers and defenders alike.

The resident dwarves worship Marthammor Duin, an ad-

venturers  god,  while  the  humans  worship  Lathander.  The

73

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 74

Cities of the Silver Marches

Lathanderites  maintain  a  watchtower  and  temple  in  the

town, the dwarf clerics maintain a fortified abbey that pro-

vides shelter for travelers, and both contribute to a vigilant

watch  on  a  nearby  cavern  that  leads  into  the  Underdark.

Most  of  the  folk  who  are  not  directly  engaged  in  serving

either deity make their living from the limited amount of

timber cutting, hunting, and fur trapping they can accom-

plish when the weather permits.

When the spring thaw of 1372 DR eventually arrived, the

snowmelt swelled the high countrys streams as it does every

spring. This year, a discovery came with the torrents of swift

water: gold. A hunter returning to his home after an unsuc-

cessful day in the foothills emptied his waterskin into a basin

and saw tiny golden flecks sinking to the bottom. He lost no

time  in  retracing  his  path  back

to  the  mountain  stream  from

which he had filled his waterskin.

There,  not  three  miles  from

Deadsnows, he began prospecting

for  gold  and  was  rewarded  with

success  for  his  efforts.  Word

soon  spread  throughout  the  vil-

lage. Deadsnows is now a boom-

town,  and  will  probably  remain

so until gold is no longer found

in its vicinity.

The  villages  population  has

swollen by some three hundred

hopeful humans, dwarves, elves,

and  halflings.  The  better  part

of  these  newcomers  hope  to

find gold for themselves, while

the  others  intend  to  earn

money  by  supplying  goods  and

services  (both  legitimate  and

otherwise)  to  the  prospectors.

Naturally,  this  sudden  increase

in population and sudden influx

in wealth has created a variety

of challenges and problems for

the community, and its leaders

are  struggling  to  cope  with

these new circumstances.

This city of merchant traders and caravan teams is one of

Important Sites

All of the important locations in Deadsnows are detailed in

the adventure Blood and Gold, in Chapter 8 of this book.

Located  southeast  of  Silverymoon  and  situated  on  the

banks of the Rauvin River, Everlund is the second largest

city in the Silver Marches and one of its most active mer-

cantile  communities.  A  thick  stone  wall  rings  the  city,

74

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 75

Cities of the Silver Marches

pierced in five places by the citys gates. Like the spokes of a

wheel,  broad,  straight  streets  lead  from  each  gate  to  Bell

Market at the city center. The layout of these streets and

the  location  of  certain  city  features,  such  as  the  market,

many inns, and warehouses, are designed for the accommo-

dation  of  caravans  and  their  merchants.  Soldiers  of  the

citys standing army make a show of patrolling the walls in

strength,  both  to  provide  reassurance  to  citizens  and  visi-

tors, and to discourage attackers.

Like  many  of  the  communities  in  the  Silver  Marches,

Everlund traces its origins to a time before the ruin of pre-

vious  civilizations.  Since  its  humble  beginnings  as  a  forti-

fied  trading  outpost  and  bridgehead  on  the  Rauvin,  the

citys  population  and  importance  have  increased  to  the

point where it is one of the most important trading cities in

the  Silver  Marches,  and  the  North  as  well.  The  fact  that

nearly every single trade caravan that begins its journeys in

the  Marches  calls  at  Everlund  en  route  to  other  destina-

tions brings to the city a position of considerable economic

and social importance. The citys voice carries considerable

weight  among  its  peers,  for  nearly  all  are  dependent  to

some degree on Everlunds role as the main caravan station

in this region.

Everlund owes its survival to the thickness of its walls

(the citys leaders have never failed to keep its first line of

defense  in  good  repair,  nor  to  add  to  the  fortifications

whenever possible), some strategic alliances, and its ability

to keep Evermoor Way open to caravan traffic. Everlund

is one of Silverymoons traditional allies and has histori-

cally  sided  with  that  city  and  its  High  Lady  on  nearly

every important issue. The same looks to hold true today,

as  the  confederation  attempts  to  deal  with  issues  of

mutual  importance  to  its  signatories.  The  Council  of

Elders  joined  the  city  with  the  Lords  Alliance  several

decades ago and signed the Silver Marches articles of con-

federation with eagerness, hopeful of greater security for

its primary trading road.

Brief History

Like Silverymoon fifty miles to the north, Everlund was in

its  beginning  a  simple  crossing-place  over  the  Rauvin.

During the last centuries of the dwarf kingdom of Delzoun,

trade from the elf realm of Illefarn sometimes passed this

way,  particularly  when  monsters  or  bad  weather  made  the

river-passage up the Surbrin to the Rauvin unusually diffi-

cult or dangerous.

As the only crossing place for several days travel in either

direction, the Rauvin crossing here often attracted the atten-

tion  of  orcs,  barbarians,  and  other  raiders,  who  would  lie  in

wait  to  ambush  caravans.  Around  334  DR  the  dwarves  of

Delzoun  responded  by  raising  a  small  keep  overlooking  the

river crossing, and garrisoned the outpost with vigilant guards

to  protect  the  crossing.  Under  the  protection  of  the  keep,  a

tiny hamlet grew up to cater to travelers seeking the chance to

rest and refit in safety.

The  dwarf  keep  was  abandoned  in  104  DR  as  the  on-

slaught against Delzoun grew too great to allocate soldiers

to the protection of a distant river crossing. The first town

on  the  site  of  Everlund  was  quietly  abandoned  over  the

years as trade ceased along this route. Wood elves roaming

the  eaves  of  Eaerlann  sometimes  came  here,  camping  in

the forests along the south bank of the river, but otherwise

the site was empty.

Everlund rose again in 515 DR, as the folk of Ascalhorn

decided to refurbish the dwarf-keep and establish a perma-

nent  garrison  here.  The  citys  growth  had  brought  a  new

wave of settlement in the Rauvin Vale, and the princes of

Ascalhorn found that the people living near the Rauvins

bend  required  protection  against  trolls  from  the  Ever-

moors  and  goblinoids  from  the  Nether  Mountains.  The

lords of Eaerlann agreed to share in this duty, and elves of

the  Forest  Kingdom  joined  the  human  knights  of  Ascal-

horn  in  guarding  this  corner  of  the  High  Forest.  Once

again  a  small  town  grew  up  around  the  keep,  this  time  a

town  of  human  traders  and  elf  merchants  eager  to  find

markets  for  Eaerlanns  goods  in  the  burgeoning  cities  of

the Sword Coast.

The  fall  of  Ascalhorn  in  882  DR,  and  the  subsequent

collapse  of  Eaerlann,  left  the  small  settlement  at  Ever-

lund without a country. By the vagaries of campaigns and

battles,  Everlund  had  survived  the  terrible  onslaught  of

the Year of the Curse virtually unharmed, although many

of its human knights and elf archers had perished in dis-

tant battles. Many hundreds of refugees from Ascalhorn

flooded into the area and took shelter in the town. Here

they  rebuilt.  In  the  absence  of  the  lord  of  the  town  (a

prince  of  Ascalhorn  killed  fighting  there),  the  people

raised  a  council  of  six  wise  commanders  and  leaders  to

govern the towns affairs until something better could be

arranged.  Over  time,  the  Council  of  Elders  became  the

true rulers of the city.

Everlund  has  always  been  close  to  Silverymoon,  its

neighbor to the north. As more people have returned to the

Rauvin  Vale  and  Old  Delzoun,  both  cities  have  grown.

Here, as in Silverymoon, humans, elves, and other folk live

together more or less in peace. For the Elders of Everlund,

joining the league Alustriel proposed was simply a formal-

itythey  were  already  committed  to  standing  with  the

High Mage of Silverymoon against all threats to the peace

of the North.

Important Sites

Despite  its  size  and  constant  level  of  activity,  Everlunds

physical appearance is a testimony to both its founders and

current leaders. Though ready to withstand an attack at any

given moment, it is nonetheless a beautiful community that

does  not  look  like  a  city  of  war.  Everlunds  buildings  are

constructed mainly of stone and timber, and they show clear

influence of both elf and dwarf architectural styles. Build-

ings  are  arranged  in  discrete  sections  separated  by  green

space:  trees,  hedges,  bowers,  gardens,  and  flowerbeds  are

common sights in all parts of the city. The result is an im-

pression of calm and tranquility that belies the many dan-

gers lurking just beyond the citys walls.

The Rauvin flows through the heart of the city, crossed by

two bridgesthe Knightbridge and the Dwarfbridge.

Cities of the Silver Marches

THE FIVE GATES

The  city  has  five  gates,  each  giving  entrance  to  the  city

from  a  different  direction  and  leading  to  broad,  straight,

and well-maintained caravan routes. The gates are, in clock-

wise  order  from  the  north,  the  Silverymoon  Gate,  the

Mountain Gate, the Upriver Gate, the Bridge Gate, and the

Downriver Gate. Each of these gates is open from dawn to

dusk,  and  shut  at  all  other  times.  Caravan  masters  know

that gaining entry into the city after the gates close can be

a tiresome chore, requiring them to consent to tedious and

thorough searches of their goods by the citys guards. Most

dont  bother  to  go  through  the  routine  if  they  arrive  at

Everlund  after  sunset,  preferring  instead  to  avail  them-

selves of the hospitality to be found in any of a number of

inns and taverns that have established a thriving trade out-

side the city walls for just such occasions.

EVERMOOR WAY

Evermoor Way begins at the Bridge Gate and winds its way

southwest for hundreds of miles, passing between the Ever-

moors and the High Forest, north of the Dessarin Hills and

offering  the  most  direct  available  route  to  Waterdeep  and

the cities of the Sword Coast. Everlund has always been in-

strumental  in  keeping  the  roadway  safe  for  caravans  from

its walls all the way to Calling Horns, hiring numerous mer-

cenaries and adventurers to scour the route for monsters and

other dangers.

The  work  has  never  been  easy,  and  many  are  the  sell-

swords  and  intrepid  companies  that  have  fallen  to  the

trolls,  orcs,  and  other  marauding  creatures  that  have

preyed  on  the  highway.  In  recent  months  Everlund  has

been harder pressed than ever to maintain the security of

the  roadway.  Perhaps  emboldened  by  the  growing  rumors

of  war  between  King  Obould  and  the  cities  of  the  North,

orc raiding parties have been striking hard at southbound

caravans, and the depredations of giants based in the Ever-

moors  (now  depopulated  of  its  former  inhabitants,  the

trolls)  have  increased  to  the  point  where  caravans  are

taking  on  extra  guards  on  journeys  to  and  from  the  city.

Many caravan masters are paying a premium for caravan

guards who are also spellcasters, hoping that the additional

magical power will help keep their goods (and their skins)

safe.  These  are  tough  times  for  caravans,  but  profitable

times for ambitious adventurers.

MOONGLEAM TOWER

Built by a master dwarf engineer almost two hundred years

ago,  this  keep  of  black,  hard  stone  is  one  of  the  foremost

Harper holds of the North. It rises from one of the higher

knolls near the center of Everlund, visible from almost any

part of the city. Moongleam Tower consists of four narrow,

cylindrical towers joined together, surrounded by a dry moat

that can be quickly flooded by a cunning system of cisterns

and pumps. Its roof is crowned by an open turret, where a

signaling mirror shaped like a crescent moon stands.

Moongleam Tower isnt meant to hold a great number of

soldiers, but the keep is strong enough to put a stop to any

attack  made  without  heavy  siege  engines  or  great  magical

firepower.  At  any  time  anywhere  from  five  to  fifteen

Harpers may be in residence, attended by a loyal staff and a

garrison  of  twenty  elite  guardsmen.  Moonlord  Eaerlraun

Shadowlyn  (CG  male  half-elf  Rgr16)  is  the  master  of  the

tower. Eaerlraun is secretly sympathetic to Khelben Black-

staffs  Moonstars  but  on  the  surface  maintains  his  alle-

giance  to  the  Harpers  of  Twilight  Hall.  Should  the  High

Harpers  discover  his  loyalties  and  make  an  issue  of  them,

Eaerlraun  might  break  with  the  order  altogether  and  take

control of Moongleam Tower with him.

HALL OF THE ELDERS

The seat of Everlunds government is this low, circular stone

building located on the east side of Bell Market. The members

of the Council of Elders meet here regularly. The building is

defended by a detail of guards from the Army of the Vale;

four soldiers remain vigilant outside the buildings main en-

trance at all times, and during the periods when the hall is

open at least six more soldiers patrol the interior corridors.

The soldiers permit all those who have legitimate business

with the council to pass, but collect their weapons first. No

armaments of any kind are permitted within. To ensure that

no one steals or tampers with the weapons they hold in trust,

the  soldiers  place  the  arms  inside  locked,  iron-reinforced

wooden  chests:  Each  container  is  protected  by  a  glyph  of

warding that is triggered if a chest is opened without first

speaking the password.

To either side of the hall, two long, rambling wings of the

building  house  the  various  officials  and  civil  servants  who

comprise  Everlunds  government.  The  remaining  ten  sol-

diers  of  the  detail  watch  the  entrances  to  the  Hall  of

Records and the Hall of Redress (home to the citys courts

and magistrates).

The Elders of Everlund

For nearly five hundred years, Everlund has been ruled by

the Council of Elders. This group is always composed of the

people holding the most prominent positions in the city, al-

though from time to time debate breaks out over whether

another civic figure is important enough to merit a position

on the council.

The council is led by the First Elder of the Council, an

office granted by vote of the Elders. The First holds his

or  her  position  until  another  Elder  challenges  it.  Some

hold the post for many years, others no more than a few

days. Kayl Moorwalker, the High Captain, is the current

First Elder.

The High Priest of Corellon Larethian, considered the

leader of the elves of the city, is one of the Elders. Cur-

rently the High Priest is Yesheln Amrallatha (CG female

wood elf Clr10 of Corellon). Yesheln is a former adven-

turer  who  has  become  circumspect  and  cautious  in  her

role as an Elder of the city. For decades she worried that

the  humans  would  simply  swallow  the  elf  parts  of  the

town,  but  in  recent  months  the  unlooked-for  return  of

some elves from Evermeet has strengthened the elf com-

munity  and  charged  it  with  determination  to  thrive  and

grow once again.

The  Keeper  of  the  Bridges is  the  civic  official  charged

76

620_088567_001_EN_Ch3b.qxd  4/26/02  1:50 PM  Page 77

Cities of the Silver Marches

with overseeing the city watch and the conduct of commerce

in the city. Currently this post is held by Malvin Draga (LE

human male Rog8/Ftr3), a scheming man who uses his posi-

tion  to  enrich  himself  by  controlling  the  customs-taking

throughout the city and overseeing the growing corruption

of the city watch. The other Elders dislike Draga intensely,

but its long been the way of the city for Elders to avoid in-

terfering in each others selection in order to avoid civic con-

flict. Someone will have to catch Draga red-handed in order

for the Elders to remove him from the council and appoint

a new Keeper of the Bridges.

The  High  Captain,  commander  of  Everlunds  army,  is

Kayl  Moorwalker  (LG  human  male  Ftr4/Ari8)  a  haughty

nobleman  who  possesses  an  uncanny  head  for  tactics  and

strategy. Extremely intelligent, he wields troops of cavalry

and columns of infantry as deftly as a veteran duellist wields

a rapier. Kayl favors the interests of landed nobles over the

citys guilds and merchants. This makes him an unlikely ally

of  the  elves  on  the  council,  who  share  his  respect  for  the

ways of the past.

The High Sorcerer is a position held by the most powerful

elf mage willing to take on the duties of the council, wizard

or sorcerer. Currently this position is held by Vaeril Rhuid-

hen (NG male sun elf Wiz13), a quiet voice of moderation

and reason who keeps the peace between the councils more

fractious members.

The Master of Guilds, an official representing the mer-

chants  of  the  city,  is  an  extraordinarily  stout  halfling

named  Borun  Fendelben  (LN  male  lightfoot  halfling

Rog4).  Fendelben  is  a  very  successful  merchant  who  has

his eyes firmly fastened on the pursuit of wealth. He also

urges  aggressive  expansion  of  new  enterprises  into  the

wilderlands about, shouting down the cautioning words of

Yesheln and Vaeril. Fendelben has no real friends on the

council, since the Keeper of the Bridges is his natural op-

ponentthe Keepers agents collect taxes grudgingly paid

by the Masters fellow merchants.

The  Speaker  of  the  Town  is  the  final  member  of  the

Council of Elders, a citizen elected every seven years to rep-

resent  the  common  folk  of  the  city.  Currently  the  post  is

held by Sindyl Omoghael (CG female half-elf Brd4/Exp5), a

minstrel and maker of musical instruments who once trav-

eled  far  and  wide  as  an  adventurer.  In  the  past,  popular

Speakers have served many terms on the council; Sindyl is in

the middle of her second. She is the special enemy of Malvin

Draga  and  opposes  the  Keeper  at  every  turna  situation

Draga finds intolerable.

BELL MARKET

The  economic  and  social  center  of  Everlund  is  the  Bell

Market,  so  named  for  the  enormous  warning  bell  that

hangs  in  a  frame  in  the  open  space  between  the  Hall  of

Bruenor was only a young lad when Shimmergloom, a

shadow dragon, slaughtered all but a few hundred members

of the once populous Battlehammer clan and forced them

to flee their home. The survivors settled in the Ten Towns

region  of  Icewind  Dale.  Young  Bruenor  never  forgot  his

home,  however,  and  committed  himself  to  reclaiming

Mithral Hall from the evil forces that held it. He eventu-

ally made good on his intentions in 1356 DR, when he and

his companionsDrizzt DoUrden, Wulfgar, and others

led  a  host  of  dwarves,  barbarians,  wizards,  and  archers

(many from Silverymoon) against Shimmergloom, freeing

Mithral  Hall  from  the  shadow  dragon  and  duergar  who

held it. Following this victory, Bruenor claimed the title of

Eighth King of Mithral Hall.

Since then, King Bruenor ceded his crown to his ances-

tor, Gandalug, the First and Ninth King of Mithral Hall,

and  then  reclaimed  it  once  again  as  the  Tenth  King  of

Mithral  Hall  when  the  Patron  of  Clan  Battlehammer

became  infirm.  In  addition  to  restoring  Mithral  Hall,

Bruenors challenges have included fending off two attacks

from the drow of Menzoberranzan (he lost his right eye in

the first battle against the would-be invaders), getting the

mithral mines working again, and cleansing the lower halls

of monsters. Bruenor is the epitome of the dwarf monarch,

a gruff hero with a heart of gold, and the deeds of daring

adventurers fan his heart to flame.

Elders and the Barracks. The bell is sounded when the city

is under attack. In the middle of the market are a number

of open-air stalls and stands that offer fresh produce, poul-

try,  baked  goods,  and  livestock.  Around  the  edges  of  this

area are permanent stalls selling manufactured items, and

surrounding  the  market  is  a  ring  of  shops  that  vend  all

manner  of  trade  goods  and  a  variety  of  services.  The

market  is  open  from  one  hour  after  dawn  to  one  hour

before dusk, to ensure that the evenings and nights of the

residents  are  not  disturbed  by  the  noise  created  by  such  a

thronged mercantile area.

THE BARRACKS AND ARMORY

Not  far  from  the  Hall  of  the  Elders  stands  the  city

armory, a small, square keep built from dressed limestone

blocks. The place is evidently one of the older buildings in

Everlund,  but  parts  of  the  keep  have  been  recently  rein-

forced  and  repaired.  One  of  the  new

additions to the structure is a low stone

wall  that  prevents  anyone  from  ap-

proaching  closer  than  30  feet.  Soldiers

patrol  the  courtyard  inside  the  new

wall, prohibiting entry to anyone who is

not  a  soldier  or  is  not  on  on  official

government business.

Hard  by  the  armory  are  six  large

wood-frame  buildings  surrounded  by

another  low  wall.  The  sight  of  sol-

diers constantly moving in and out

of the buildings, and drilling in the

courtyard, marks this as the citys

main  barracks.  (There  are  five

smaller  barracks,  one  located  at

each  of  the  citys  gates.)  The  army

has set up a special station just inside

the  main  entrance  to  the  court-

yard, where mercenaries and ad-

venturers  may  obtain  work

patrolling  Evermoor  Way  and

keeping the route clear of monsters and

other threats.

MAJOR TEMPLES

Everlunds most prominent places of worship are the Keep

of  Vigilance  (Helm),  the  Evergreen  Hall  (Mielikki),  the

Starmeadow  (devoted  to  Corellon  Larethian),  and  the

Grotto (sacred to Shiallia). The folk of the city tend to be

devout  and  crowd  the  major  temples  on  the  first  day  of

every  tenday  to  worship  their  deities.  In  addition  to  the

major  temples,  Everlund  is  home  to  shrines  to  Oghma,

Shaundakul  (popular  among  the  caravan  masters),  and

Waukeen as well.

Mithral Hall

The most famous dwarfhold in the North, and probably in

the  Western  Heartlands  as  well,  earns  its  reputation  from

the  deeds  of  its  renowned  ruler.  King  Bruenor  has  adopted

the symbol of the Battlehammer clan (a foaming beer mug)

as the standard of his realm. The dwarves of Mithral Hall

wear the emblem proudly on their armor and battle flags.

Mithral Hall (large town): Conventional; AL NG; 3,000 gp

limit;  Assets  748,650  gp;  Population  4,991;  Mixed  (shield

dwarves  81%,  deep  gnomes  7%,  gold  dwarves  5%,  humans

Mithral Hall lies underground in the region known as the

Frost  Hills,  deep  beneath  Fourpeak  Mountain.  Its  main

entrance  is  in  an  alpine  valley  known  as  Keepers  Dale,

which lies north and west of the River Surbrin. The gen-

eral vicinity of the door is marked by a stand of ancient

stone monoliths. Since retaking the hold sixteen years ago,

Bruenor  Battlehammer  has  made  some  significant  alter-

ations to the towns original layout.

A  pair  of  massive  and  heavily  guarded  granite  portals

has replaced the secret door that was once the main gate.

The  halls  uppermost  levels  are  still  little  more  than  a

series of mazelike corridors and tunnels, designed to divert

intruders  away  from  the  inhabited  lower  halls,  and  to

78

Cities of the Silver Marches

channel  them  instead  toward  innumerable  traps.  The

dwarves  have  restored  many  of  the  older  traps  to  full

working order, and added new ones to make the upper halls

even more deadly to would-be invaders. The mid-level halls

include the mithral mines for which the hold is so famed,

and beneath them is the Undercity, living chambers that

can  potentially  hold  over  twice  as  many  dwarves  as  cur-

rently  reside  there.  The  dwarf-homes  are  built  into  the

rock of the mountains roots, and open onto rings of con-

centric ledges.

The dwarves have sealed the tunnels leading to the cavern

that was once the lair of the shadow dragon Shimmergloom,

and they take great care to tunnel around its vicinity as they

expand  their  mithral  mining  operations.  To  prevent  the

return of the duergar that once infested the hall, Bruenors

followers have created and manned a system of guardposts

that  serve  as  launching  points  for  routine  expeditions  of

warriors whose sole job is to scour the nearby Underdark for

potential enemies.

Brief History

The recent history of Mithral Hall is detailed in the FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. With the fall of Bling-

denstone  to  Menzoberranzan,  a  number  of  deep  gnomes

under the leadership of the Burrow Warden Belwar Dissen-

gulp have taken up residence in the city of King Bruenor.

Bruenor and his folk owe a great debt to the svirfneblin of

Blingdenstone,  and  the  king  gladly  offered  refuge  to  any

deep  gnomes  who  survived  the  sack  of  their  own  city.  So

far, about three hundred fifty of Blingdenstones survivors

have assembled in Mithral Hall.

Important Sites

While Mithral Hall is a signatory of the league of the Silver

Marches,  the  dwarfhold  does  not  necessarily  welcome  just

anyone inside. Bruenor and his folk are cautious in dealing with

strangers, especially vagabond adventurers who might or might

not be who they say they are.

SETTLESTONE

The main doors of Mithral Hall lie a half-days climb north

and east of Settlestone village. An oddity of dwarf architec-

ture,  Settlestone  was  built  entirely  above  ground,  its  struc-

tures  comprised  entirely  of  huge  stone  slabs.  Once  a  ruin

infested by monsters, the village was cleared and rebuilt by

Bruenors  followers,  turning  it  into  their  homes  public

face.  Travelers  bound  for  Mithral  Hall  must  first  pass

through Settlestone and seek permission from its appointed

officials  to  ascend  the  narrow  caravan  road  to  the  hall.  A

garrison of some two hundred dwarf warriors is stationed in

Settlestone. It is charged with keeping the surrounding area

free of monsters and defending the main road against hostile

arrivals. The road itself is also protectedentire sections are

rigged to be buried under deadly avalanches, fall away into

deep ravines, or be washed away under the onslaught of di-

verted mountain streams (these defenses are not automatic,

but rather are triggered purposefully by the defenders).

Quaervarr

This  isolated  logging  town  has  enjoyed  a  reputation  as  a

peaceful backwater in times past. In recent months evil crea-

tures that claim ownership of the Moonwood have come to

threaten the community.

Quaervarr had no official symbol and didnt see the need for

one until it joined the Silver Marches confederation. At that

time it decided to adopt the mark of its most notable landmark,

the  Whistling  Stag  inn.  Now  the  Quaervarr  pennant,  a  stag

rampant on a green field, flies proudly from the town walls.

Quaervarr (small town): Nonstandard; AL CG; 800 gp limit;

Assets  38,080  gp;  Population  952;  Mixed  (humans  68%,

half-elves 25%, shield dwarves 7%).

Authority Figures: Speaker Geth Stonar, NG male human

Exp3. In times of danger, the town turns to the local druids

for  guidance,  chief  among  them  Amra  Clearwater,  NG

female half-elf Drd7 of Silvanus.

Quaervarr is a rustic little community hidden in the south-

ern eaves of the Moonwood. Most of its visitors are traders,

hunters, or travelers on their way to the Heralds Holdfast.

It lies some thirty miles north of Silverymoon, at the center

of a network of crisscrossing logging roads and game trails.

The town itself is unimpressive, a collection of wood-frame

buildings sheltered behind a high wooden palisade. There is

but  one  gate,  constructed  from  huge  oak  beams  reinforced

with iron bands.

Visitors find the militia stationed at the towns only gate

to  be  suspicious.  They  grill  all  new  arrivals,  demanding  to

know names, points of origin, and intentions before admit-

ting  anyone.  Strangers  who  cannot  give  a  good  account  of

themselves  are  denied  entry  until  an  authority  figure  can

question them. Recent raids by the Malar-worshipers of Claw

Hollow have roused the town, and every guard on duty car-

ries ten silver-headed bolts for his or her crossbow and a half-

spear with a silver head.

Brief History

The towns first settlers arrived less than two centuries ago to

log the thick stands of shadowtops that grow in the vicinity.

Cities of the Silver Marches

Gradually  the  place  attracted  more  loggers,  and  a  small

number  of  woodworkers,  hunters,  timber  merchants,  and

other folk, until it became the modest town it is today. The

town  government  consists  of  a  Speaker,  elected  once  each

year  from  among  the  local  populace.  Quaervarr  has  never

been threatened by the goblinoids that plague the rest of the

region, but the Moonwood holds other dangers, and one of

those threatens the community now.

Jarthon  of  the  Moonwood  (NE  male  werebadger  Rgr5)

was once a half-elf who used to hunt lycanthropes to protect

the people of Silverymoon. After he became infected with ly-

canthropy, he used his hunting skills to become the leader of

a tribe of People of the Black Blood. Since then Jarthon has

become  a  thorn  in  the  side  of  the  people  of  the  Silver

Marches. In Kythorn of this year, he and his tribe abducted a

Quaervarr  woodcutter  and  used  him  as  the  prey  in  one  of

their infamous Wild Hunts. A search party found his body,

and pinned to the torn remains of his shirt was a note signed

by  Jarthon  insisting  that  the  town  cease  its  attempts  to

expand into the territory of the People. In the last month,

three  more  citizens  have  been  attacked  and  brutally  slain,

their  bodies  left  as  warnings.  Quaervarrs  citizens  have

scrambled to beef up their defenses, and have sent an appeal

for aid to the Silver Marches signatories. Tensions within the

town rise with every new murder, and its citizens are becom-

ing increasingly paranoid of strangersany newcomer could

be a spy for Jarthon, or even the villain himself.

Important Sites

Adventurers  often  launch  expeditions  into  the  Moonwood

from Quaervarr. There are few sites of notes in the town.

THE OAK HOUSE

Located  a  short  distance  from  the  town  in  a  stand  of  an-

cient, never-felled trees lies the Oak House, a temple sacred

to Silvanus. The structure is an open-sided pavilion or lodge

made from rough-hewn trunks that fell of their own accord,

never touched by axe or fire. Green fir boughs woven tightly

together between the trunks serve to keep out the rain. Nes-

tled  in  and  among  the  forest  surrounding  the  lodge  stand

several small dwellings, home to the clergy of Silvanus who

tend the site.

The  Oak  House  is  led  by  Amra  Clearwater  (NG  female

half-elf Drd7 of Silvanus). She and her followers watch over

the woodcutters and loggers of Quaervarr, advising them in

choosing which trees are to be taken and when. The loggers

of the town hold a deep respect (and not a little fear) of the

Oakfather  and  listen  attentively  to  the  druids  advice  to

avoid angering the deity of the forest.

In addition to Amra herself, three lesser druids, a cleric,

and  two  rangers  devoted  to  Silvanus  watch  over  the  Oak

House. They travel widely through the forest and are often

away from the temple.

THE WHISTLING STAG

Few adventurers can pass up a visit to the towns best known

and  most-beloved  landmark,  the  Whistling  Stag.  This  inn

and hunting lodge has been serving patrons for time out of

mind, and its generally acknowledged as one of the finest es-

tablishments  in  the  Silver  Marches.  The  rooms  are  filled

with stag heads, bear skin rugs, peryton antlers, and similar

trophies, and a magnificent tapestry depicting a hunt for a

dire boar graces the main dining hall.

Avid  hunters  come  from  all  over  the  North  to  avail

themselves of the expert services of Huntmaster Quickleaf,

the inns house guide. For a fee of 10 gp per day, Saernnus

takes  hunting  parties  out  into  the  wilderness  to  hunt  for

predators such as dire bears, dire wolves, owlbears, perytons,

and sometimes even more dangerous beasts. For 25 gp per

day, Saernnus will act as a guide for nonhunters who wish to

explore or journey through the Moonwood, with which he is

intimately familiar.

The  Stag  is  named  for  a  local  legend.  Old-timers  who

gather  around  the  massive  stone  hearth  in  the  inns

common  room  never  miss  a  chance  to  regale  newcomers

with the story of how a certain stag eluded the towns best

hunters during a day-long quest. The next morning, so the

story goes, the stag sauntered through the middle of town,

whistling  casually  and  casting  amused  looks  at  the  gaping

hunters  who  lined  the  streets  to  watch  him  pass  by.  Cur-

rently a heated debate rages between three of the eldest tale-

spinners about whether or not the stag winked at a hunter as

he walked through town. The issue is not likely to be settled

any time soon.

Newfort

Caught between the suspicions of its neighbors and the lethal

dangers of frontier life, the hamlet of Newfort struggles to

find both safety and acceptance in a harsh land.

Newfort  (hamlet): Nonstandard;  AL  LN;  100  gp  limit;

Assets 690 gp; Population 138; Mixed (humans 94%, half-

elves 2%, half-orcs 4%).

Authority  Figures: Trevis  Uhl,  N  male  human  Ftr9

(proprietor  of  the  Heros  Reward,  and  de  facto  mayor  of

the town).

Important Characters: Constable Gyreth Ilgarn, N male

human Ftr5 (close friend of Uhl, and self-appointed consta-

ble of the town); Guardian Nargroth, CN male half-orc Clr6

of Tempus (a constant thorn in the side of Trevis Uhl, in-

citing the settlers to take up arms and aggressively stake out

their lands); Deliyra Narm, NE female half-orc Ftr2/Rog5

(Zhentarim agent posing as the proprietor of a small trad-

ing post).

Sundabar  and  about  three  miles  south  of  the  road  that

leads through Sundabar Vale toward the Fork. The hamlet

consists  of  around  forty  wood-frame  structures  all  built

near a shallow, swift, mountain-fed stream that serves as

the settlements main source of water. Newfort is home to

more  than  a  hundred  settlers  from  the  Moonsea  region,

including thirty Zhent soldiers mustered out of their citys

service and their families.

The communitys most recognizable features are the twin

stockades that rise high above the hamlet. It is to these struc-

tures that the hamlets citizens retreat when danger threat-

ens.  The  major  advantages  of  this  construction  are  that  it

can be raised quickly, repaired easily, and constructed from

materials readily at hand. Its drawbacks include a susceptibil-

ity  to  fire.  The  settlers  plan  to  replace  their  fortifications

with  ones made of stone just as soon as an adequate source

can be located for purchase or quarrying.

Brief History

The first Newfort settlers arrived in the Silver Marches just

after  the  snows  of  last  winter  had  retreated  (Mirtul  1371

DR).  Two  retired  Zhent  officers,  Gyreth  Ilgarn  and  Trevis

Uhl, led the party to its new home. They established Newfort

by  the  banks  of  a  convenient  stream,  raised  shelters  and  a

crude palisade to protect themselves from enemies and the

environment, and struggled through their first winter. They

are  proud  of  what  they  have  accomplished  in  the  months

since they first arrived, and they are hopeful that Newfort

will continue to thrive.

Although  no  one  appointed  him  officially,  Trevis  Uhl

has become the settlements de facto leader and spokesman.

He works ceaselessly to support and guide his fellow New-

fort  citizens,  even  as  he  runs  the  hamlets  first  and  only

tavern, and acts as their representative to the Free Towns

and the rest of the Silver Marches. Gyreth Ilgarn is the only

inhabitant with an official title (Constable); he is responsi-

ble for the settlements defense, but he defers to Uhls judg-

ment in most matters.

Important Sites

The  following  locations  are  among  those  that  adventurers

will most likely see and visit. Refer to the accompanying map.

1. FORT

A small blockhouse made of thick, strong logs commands

the  whole  village.  The  fort  stands  on  a  large  mound  of

earth raised to a height of almost 20 feet, and is topped by

a  wooden  palisade.  Atop  the  forts  roof,  armed  warriors

scan  the  surrounding  woodlands  and  hills  for  signs  of

danger. The fort is surrounded by a 10-foot-high wooden

palisade wall, and the mound on which it rests is encircled

by  an  8-foot-deep  ditch  lined  with  sharpened,  fire-hard-

ened  stakes.  The  fort  is  the  command  post  of  Constable

Gyreth, who oversees the hamlets small but experienced

volunteer militia.

A wooden bridge over the intervening ditch connects the

Newfort  is  situated  approximately  fifteen  miles  east  of

fort and its palisade to the lower stockade.

Cities of the Silver Marches

2. LOWER STOCKADE

The  fort  is  connected  to  a  second,  larger  enclosure  by  a

wooden bridge. The mound of earth beneath the lower stock-

ade is approximately 10 feet high, and the palisade fence and

ditch of the lower stockade are the same dimensions as those

of the fort (see above). Within the lower stockade lie several

wood-frame structures: a granary, smithy, barracks, and com-

bination stable and barn.

A  wooden  drawbridge  over  the  encircling  ditch  guards

access to the lower stockade. In times of danger, one or two

members of the militia may be stationed here to draw up the

bridge before any attackers can storm the fort. The fort and

the  buildings  in  the  lower  stockade  are  considered  commu-

nity  property,  an  investment  by  each  settler  in  the  towns

common defense. Newforts farmers contribute a portion of

their crop and livestock to fill the granary and barn, the bar-

racks is provided for anyone on militia duty, and the smithy

is open for the use of anyone needing it.

3. NARMS EXCHANGE

A  small  trading  post  opened  by  a  half-orc  woman  named

Deliyra Narm (NE female half-orc Ftr2/Rog5), Narms Ex-

change  functions  as  Newforts  main  trading  post.  Deliyra

Narm purchases goods such as tools, clothing, and other sup-

plies  from  the  merchants  in  nearby  Sundabar  and  brings

them in to Newfort to sell to her neighbors. She also buys

the handcrafted goods produced in the settlementlumber,

tallow,  soap,  vegetables,  wool,  and  other  foodstuffs  and

simple goodsand takes them to sell in Sundabar. The post

provides her with a perfect cover; she is actually a Zhentarim

agent charged with spying out the strength of Sundabar and

the lands about.

Deliyra craftily pushes Uhl to assume more and more au-

thority, planning for a future accident to befall the towns

leader so that a true Zhent loyalist might be raised in his place.

She  hopes  to  use  Newfort  as  the  base  for  a  new  merchant

coster that will insinuate its way into Sundabar and come to

control the passage of goods through the Sundabar Vale, thus

extending the grasp of the Black Network just a little more.

4. THE HEROS REWARD

The few Silver Marches residents who have visited Newfort

since  its  founding  report  that  the  Heros  Reward  is  a  cozy

little  taproom  with  good  beer  (most  of  it  purchased  from

other Marches towns) and tasty, filling food. They also speak

of its proprietor, Trevis Uhl, in favorable terms. None of the

visitors  understand  that  the  taverns  name  is  an  inside  joke

among the Newfort inhabitants. Only they know that Trevis

was a tavernkeeper back in Zhentil Keep, or that the name he

chose for his new business is a wink to the other retired Zhents

who  are  all  too  familiar  with  the  manner  in  which  their

former employer frequently rewarded its employees. Trevis

is ably assisted by Deirdre, Talisan, and Emmi, the three bar-

maids who worked for him in Zhentil Keep and made the west-

ward journey with him to start new lives for themselves.

5. SHRINE OF TEMPUS

Since many of the settlers in Newfort are former Zhent sol-

diers,  the  Lord  of  Battle  is  highly  regarded  here.  The

Guardian  Nargroth  (CN  male  half-orc  Clr6  of  Tempus),  a

battered  old  half-orc,  runs  this  shrine.  Nargroth  marched

under the Zhent banner for many years before the rising in-

fluence  of  the  Zhentarim  and  the  rabid  worship  of  first

Bane, then Cyric, and then Xvim poisoned Zhentil Keep and

its armies against other deities. He was only too glad to quit

the Moonsea and head for lands where his deity was revered.

Nargroth is something of a troublemaker, in that he be-

lieves  that  the  people  of  Newfort  have  the  right  and  the

need  to  claim  and  defend  land  through  force  of  arms.  He

constantly exhorts the community leaders to take steps to at-

tract more settlers with skill at arms (ex-soldiers and former

mercenaries)  in  order  to  aggressively  tame  this  corner  of

Sundabar Vale. Trevis Uhl recognizes that mustering more

than a few dozen warriors or taking steps to assert Newforts

authority  in  place  of  Sundabars  patrols  or  the  Argent

Legion of the Marches wont be received well by Newforts

neighbors.  Nargroth  sees  things  in  simpler  terms,  and  hes

not afraid to say what he thinks.

6. STAUVINS MILL

One  of  Newforts  few  non-Zhent  residents,  Stauvin  Stone-

brace  (NG  male  human  Com3)  and  his  family  have  lived

here for years, raising goats and sheep in a small homestead

surrounded  by  miles  of  thinly  settled  or  abandoned  land.

Stauvin owned the land on which Newfort was raised, and

sold plots to the new settlers on arrival. He didnt get much

for his landafter all, the Silver Marches has plenty of un-

claimed land suitable for settlingbut by selling to Uhl and

his  settlers,  Stauvin  gained  a  number  of  new  neighbors  to

help defend the area. In turn, Uhl and his followers obtained

a crucial scrap of legitimacy, a legal right to live on the land

theyve settled.

Stauvin still holds large amounts of land on the east side

of  the  stream  running  through  Newfort.  He  has  expanded

and refurbished his old millhouse to serve the new commu-

nity. Hes the wealthiest man in Newfort, and more than a

few  of  the  new  settlers  have  grumbled  about  Stauvins  un-

abashed  efforts  to  separate  them  from  their  money.  Un-

known  to  anyone  else  in  the  village,  Stauvin  is  playing  a

more dangerous game than thathe quietly reports on New-

forts affairs to secretive Harper scouts and spies who stop by

to visit with him from time to time.

82

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 83

For most of the inhabitants of the Silver Marches,

life consists of going about their ordinary business

while  wondering  when  the  next  orc  horde,  angry

white dragon, or ravening troll band is going to upset their

routine. They are all aware of how dangerous and sometimes

fleeting life can be on this frontier, and this knowledge that

helps foster their sense of cooperation. When the people of

the  Marches  are  faced  by  orcs,  giants,  dragons,  and  worse,

the differences between dwarf and elf, or human and plane-

touched, just arent as important as they are in other lands.

The people of the Silver Marches are by and large a hope-

ful lot, but their outlook about their future has not blinded

them to the fact that they dwell within an easy walk of fell

beasts and ferocious enemies. The result is an odd sort of op-

timistic  pragmatism  that  people  in  some  other  lands  find

difficult to understand.

Life and Society

The folk of the Silver Marches fall easily into two groups:

Those who live in the relative safety of the great cities, and

those  who  do  not.  Entwined  by  history,  commerce,  and

common ideals, these two populations sometimes seem like

two coexistent countries that are invisible to each other.

One  country  is  a  frontier  land  of  hunters,  loggers,  and

miners  scattered  across  an  awesome  wilderness,  a  land  of

homesteaders and freeholders proud of their efforts to tame

the land and make a life for themselves free of kings, lords,

taxes, and the trappings of civilization. Its a rustic life, and

a hard one. These settlers are used to doing things for them-

selvesthey live in cabins they built themselves, tend fields

they cleared with backbreaking labor, wear clothes made of

homespun wool, burn candles and wash with soap manufac-

tured in their own homes.

The  other  country  consists  of  a  string  of  island-cities

rising  from  a  sea  of  darkness.  Within  their  walls  industry

and  craft,  learning  and  commerce,  thrive  and  grow,  shel-

tered  from  the  threats  outside  only  by  constant  vigilance

and military prowess. Where the frontier is about land, the

cities are about gold. The city-folk are specialized for indus-

try and trade. Skill at a craft, the ability to take the raw ma-

terials of the land and manufacture useful things and from

those wealth, take the place of the settlers determination to

fend for himself.

Of course, the city-folk and the settlers of the wild arent

completely ignorant of each other. Even the most fiercely

independent freeholder needs goods produced in the cities

tools, weapons, cloth, furnishings, or luxury items he cant

make himself. And the city-folk need food, timber, pelts, ore,

and the other resources of the wilderness in order to manu-

facture the trade goods they depend on for prosperity.

Economy

Trade is a topic that dominates much of the discussion be-

tween  the  confederation  leaders.  The  Silver  Marches  is  a

land  of  economic  opportunities  and  rich  natural  resources,

but those who desire to take advantage of them must con-

tend with the fact that all opportunities and resources coex-

ist  with  the  very  real  possibility  of  violent  death  in  the

howling wilderness. Silverymoon and Everlund are the com-

mercial gateways to the Silver Marches, though some dwarf

craftsmen insist that merchants who desire their wares (par-

ticularly  armor  and  weapons)  come  directly  to  their  home

cities if they wish to trade.

Lady  Alustriel  and  her  allies  work  to  ensure  that  trade

practices remain fair and that there is a reasonable opportu-

nity for newcomers to enter the existing markets. Individual

merchants sometimes clash with her efforts as they seek to

83

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 84

People of the Silver Marches

protect  their  own  interests.  Merchants  are,  as  a  group,  the

most likely to put pressure on the respective leaders of the

Silver Marches communities; the kings and councils of the

region can ill afford to ignore the requests and suggestions of

the merchant class. The topic currently at the head of many

merchants agendas is the new Zhent settlers in the Marches.

Many merchants would prefer that these folk not be allowed

to participate in trade, fearing that permitting them to do so

would be to give the Black Network an economic foothold in

the  Silver  Marches.  In  some  cases,  gangs  of  masked  horse-

men hired by unscrupulous (or frightened) merchants have

harried the new settlers, trying to intimidate them into re-

turning to the Moonsea.

Whether  or  not  the  Zhentarim  are  on  the  move  in  the

North, the plain truth is that theres wealth to be made by

anyone with a little determination and luck. The economy of

the  Silver  Marches  rests  on  four  principal  pillars:  agricul-

ture, fur, mining, and timber. Some places deal in more spe-

cialized  commodities,  but  the  resources  of  the  forests  and

mountains of the Savage Frontier are the magnets attract-

ing Sword Coast gold to these lands.

AGRICULTURE

The fertile fields of the Rauvin and Sundabar Vales feed

the  cities  of  the  North.  The  folk  of  the  Silver  Marches

ship  little  of  their  food  to  other  lands,  but  within  the

league,  foodstuffs  are  big  business.  The  great  dwarf

citadels have an insatiable demand for all kinds of food,

from  simple  grain  and  vegetables  to  beer,  cheese,  cured

meats,  and  other  such  products.  The  dwarfholds  can,  in

most  cases,  survive  for  years  on  subterranean  fungus-

fields and livestock kept in high mountain paddocks, but

unless theyre under siege they vastly prefer to buy fresh

food from the human farmers of the region.

With the exception of some of the dwarfholds, most small

settlements  have  sufficient  arable  land  to  see  to  their  own

food  needs.  Soil  in  the  area  is  fertile  but  often  rocky,  and

sometimes  limited  to  lowland  areas.  Alpine  communities

import food that they cannot grow or make for themselves.

The  larger  communities,  particularly  Silverymoon,  Sund-

abar,  and  Everlund,  are  surrounded  by  a  belt  of  farmland

that produces a surplus of food to sell at market.

ARMS AND ARMOR

The  finest  armor  and  weapons  available  in  the  North  are

crafted at Citadel Adbar and Sundabar. Indeed, the products

of  these  forges  are  known  and  respected  throughout  the

Western Heartlands, and beyond. Highly respected armorers

and  weaponsmiths  in  both  cities  routinely  produce  master-

work items to the exact specifications of their customers.

COINAGE

All  the  common  and  some  uncommon  coinages  and  trade

bars of Faern are accepted in Everlund, Silverymoon, Sun-

dabar, and the dwarfholds. Only the most common sorts of

coins  are  usable  in  the  smaller  towns,  and  in  the  smallest

People of the Silver Marches

communities of the Silver Marches barter is still an accepted

trade practice. The city of Silverymoon mints its own coin, a

shining gold crescent known as the moon (value 2 gp), which

is  accepted  throughout  the  Marches.  Old  coins  from  Del-

zoun, Ascalhorn, and other vanished realms still turn up in

monster hoards or tomb-plunder, but many merchants and

townsfolk regard these as unlucky and refuse to take them

at full value, anyway.

FISHING

The rivers, streams, and alpine lakes of the region teem with

fish,  though  getting  to  them  is  sometimes  difficult.  The

River Rauvin supplies most of the catch that makes its way

to  the  larger  markets  of  Silverymoon  and  Everlund.  The

most  common  fish  to  be  found  are  trout,  perch,  pickerel,

lout, and eels. The folk of Jalanthar favor a freshwater crab

they call the blueback, which is abundant in a stretch of the

Rauvin  located  just  as  the  river  makes  its  way  out  of  the

Moon Pass.

FURS

Fine  furs  from  the  Silver  Marches  are  carried  from  the

Sword Coast to all parts of Faern. Pelts are comparatively

high in value and low in bulk, thus making for an attractive

trade commodity. Bear, beaver, marten, mink, and sable are

the most prized pelts, bringing 2 gp to 8 gp each in the trad-

ing  posts  of  Everlund  and  Silverymoon.  Theyre  sold  for

twice  that  in  the  markets  of  Waterdeep,  Neverwinter,  or

Luskan.  Deer  skins,  wolf  pelts,  and  roth  hides  are  bulkier

and less valuable, bringing 1 gp to 4 gp apiece.

The  western  slopes  and  valleys  of  the  Nether  Moun-

tains are particularly rich with fur-bearing animals. Indi-

vidual trappers catch game and transport the carcasses to

trapping  camps,  which  are  small  communities  in  and  of

themselves.  Most  of  the  camps  are  nothing  more  than

crude  log  shelters  surrounded  by  long,  low  curing  sheds  in

which the furs are stretched out on wooden lasts and prepared

for market.

LIVESTOCK

There are a number of open grassy spaces and meadows in

the Silver Marches that can support small herds of livestock.

The most common domesticated herd beasts are cattle, goats,

pigs, and sheep. Most of these herds are relatively small, be-

longing  to  individual  shepherds  or  groups  of  three  or  four

that  work  together  to  produce  a  modest  business.  There  is

not  sufficient  grazing  land  to  allow  the  maintenance  of

major herds, however, and therefore there is not a thriving

wool or leather industry in the Marches; these items must be

imported. Most locally grown, spun, and dyed wool is avail-

able only in the form of ready-made garments and blankets,

and these are in limited supply.

MINERAL WEALTH

The mountains of the Silver Marches (the Nether, Rauvin,

and Ice ranges) hold rich deposits of minerals and gems. In-

dividual prospectors seek these treasures with single-minded,

almost  fanatical,  determination,  but  most  of  the  serious

mining is undertaken by the dwarves. Citadel Adbar, Citadel

Felbarr, and Mithral Hall all maintain major mining opera-

tions that make them among the most successful dwarfholds

in the Western Heartlands. Dwarves and their craft are al-

most universally less common in other parts of Faern than

in  the  Silver  Marches,  a  fact  that  brings  merchants  here

from all over the land.

Gold, silver, iron, and copper are the most abundant of the

ores  found  in  the  Marches,  and  the  trade  in  each  is  brisk

indeed.  Iron  is  not  worth  enough  to  ship  any  distance,  but

iron (or steel) tools, goods, and weapons are.

TIMBER

The Silver Marches seems to be an inexhaustible source of

timber. Vast tracts of lumber have yet to be harvested, but

much  of  that  is  difficult  to  reach,  and  exists  in  territory

plagued by dangerous creatures. Some of the larger cities in

the Marches, particularly Sundabar and Everlund, have al-

ready  harvested  or  cleared  the  lions  share  of  the  available

timber  in  their  vicinity.  Large-scale  timber-cutting  opera-

tions are not as common as the work done by small teams of

woodcutters. Those who venture deep into the wilderness in

search of fresh stands of timber often hire guards to protect

them from the wolves, dire bears, humanoids, and other dan-

gers. The one forest that remains largely untouched by the

timber-hungry  settlers  is  the  High  Forestits  simply  too

dangerous  to  take  living  trees  from  the  wood  without  per-

mission from its treant guardian.

TRADE AND TRAVEL

Because  the  population  of  the  Silver  Marches  is  scattered

across  an  enormous  wilderness  measuring  hundreds  of

thousands of square miles, travel is usually undertaken by

ordinary folk only when it is absolutely necessary. Most of

the traffic on what few roads exist in the Marches consists

of caravans and military forces. And even when obliged to

travel,  no  one  does  so  after  dark  (at  least  not  willingly).

The forests and hills are crawling with hostile orc scouting

parties, troll bands, hungry wolves, and even worse threats

to life and limb. Most folk wont leave the security of their

communitys walls once darkness settles over the land.

Some  of  the  common  trade  routes  and  travel  times

through the Silver Marches are summarized below.

Silverymoon to Everlund: 50 miles.

Silverymoon to Nesm by barge: 165 miles. Barges travel-

ing downstream can make 2 miles per hour, twice as fast as

their normal speed.

Silverymoon to Sundabar: 165 miles.

Silverymoon to Waterdeep via the Evermoor Way and the

Long Road: 600 miles.

Silverymoon to Yartar by barge: 375 miles. Again, barges

traveling downstream can make 2 miles per hour.

Silverymoon to Yartar via the Evermoor Way: 320 miles.

Sundabar to Citadel Adbar: 190 miles.

Sundabar to Everlund by barge: 170 miles.

Law and Order

The  Silver  Marches  articles  of  confederation  provide  that

each signatory member is responsible for maintaining order

85

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 86

People of the Silver Marches

in  and  enforcing  the  laws  of  its  own  community.  Nearly

every  community  in  the  Marches,  even  tiny  Jalanthar,

boasts some manner of organized watch. In the smaller set-

tlements,  such  duties  are  often  performed  by  an  all-volun-

teer militia. The leaders of these units are often people who

fulfill the obligation in addition to their civilian responsi-

bilities. These sturdy souls sometimes find themselves forced

to conduct militia business in the middle of pouring ale or

shoeing a horse, as the case may be.

Larger  towns  and  cities  normally  support  a  permanent

town guard or watch that is charged with keeping order in

the streets. Depending on the communitys size and level of

prosperity, it may also support a standing army to patrol the

walls, keep the surrounding area free of hostile people and

creatures, and fight off attackers.

The  Silver  Marches  is  one  of  the  more  socially  enlight-

ened locales in Faern. Its citizens are, by and large, commit-

ted to the notion that folk should be free to live their lives as

they please, that their lives should be free of oppression, and

everyone should enjoy a reasonable measure of equality. It is

sometimes  difficult  to  enforce  these  noble  ideals,  however,

because  few  people  interpret  them  in  precisely  the  same

manner. There is not yet a collective court or council with

the  authority  to  judge,  convict,  or  punish  individuals  who

may commit crimes against the confederation, such as trea-

son. Alustriel has proposed the creation of such a tribunal,

but  the  matter  is  bogged  down  in  serious  contention.  The

High  Mage  Taern  Hornblade  naturally  supports  the  idea,

but two of the dwarf monarchs, King Harbromm and King

Warcrown, are opposed to the measure, insisting that judicial

power  must  rest  solely  within  each  individual  signatorys

bailiwick.  King  Battlehammer  of  Mithral  Hall,  Helm

Dwarf-friend  of  Sundabar,  and  the  Council  of  Elders  that

rules Everlund remain as yet undecided.

Both Harbromm and Warcrown have been trying to per-

suade  Battlehammer  to  join  them  in  voicing  opposition  to

the  idea  of  a  confederacy  court,  appealing  to  his  sense  of

racial duty by pointing out that as a sovereign Bruenor has a

responsibility to his followers that overrides his well-known

friendship with the High Lady.

The  Council  of  Elders  is  undecided  because  of  an  even

split among its members on the merits of the proposal. The

Master of Guilds, the High Sorcerer, and the High Priest be-

lieve  that  a  court  of  the  nature  that  Alustriel  conceives

would strengthen the federation by making it impossible for

someone to commit a crime in one city and then elude justice

by fleeing to another. The Keeper of the Bridges, the Speaker

of  the  Town,  and  First  Elder  Kayl  Moorwalker  fear  that

giving up any judicial rights would weaken their city in the

long run and possibly open the door for league interference

in the commerce of the signatory cities.

Adventurers

Adventurers  are  a  common  sight  in  the  Silver  Marches,

both in the cities themselves, and on the roads and in the

wilderness.  The  territory  offers  a  truly  mind-boggling

array  of  opportunities  for  adventuring  parties;  the  sheer

number of enemies intent on causing woe to the people of

the confederation ensures a steady demand for those will-

ing to risk life and limb in return for cash rewards. Adven-

turers  have  been  instrumental  in  helping  the  Marches

thwart  numerous  threats.  They  have  helped  ferret  out

enemy  agents  spying  within  city  walls,  rescued  caravans

and travelers lost in the wilderness, provided reliable intel-

ligence on the movements of the orc hordes, and put a stop

to the depredations of brigands and monsters.

TOWNS AND ADVENTURERS

Many communities in the Marches have specific rules and

laws concerning adventurers.

Citadel Adbar: The stronghold does not welcome adven-

turers  any  more  than  it  does  other  visitors.  Adventuring

parties escorting caravans are tolerated, but most others are

sent on their way as quickly as possible. Freebooters and sell-

swords looking for employment will surely be disappointed.

The  only  exception  might  be  in  the  case  that  King  Har-

bromm  has  encountered  a  task  that  he  deems  either  too

unimportant  or  dangerous  for  his  warriors  to  undertake,

and in such cases he might be willing to authorize the hire

of adventurers.

Citadel  Felbarr:  King  Warcrown  needs  information  on

the strength and location of the goblinholds and orc caverns

of  the  Rauvin  Mountains,  looming  close  by  his  city.  The

dwarf  soldiers  under  his  command,  while  courageous  and

eager for battle, dont make for good infiltrators or scouts,

and  so  Warcrown  has  taken  to  sponsoring  small  parties  of

adventurers in this work.

Deadsnows: Among  all  the  communities  in  the  Silver

Marches, Deadsnows is perhaps most in need of adventurers

at this time. See the Blood and Gold adventure in Chapter

8 for more information.

Everlund:  Everlund  requires  that  all  adventurers  iden-

tify themselves as they enter through the city gates and pay

a tax of 2 gp per head upon entry. The officials collecting

the tax present the adventurers with a brass token that indi-

cates  they  have  paid;  armed  visitors  who  are  not  in  the

employ  of  a  recognized  merchant  or  caravan  leader  must

present these tokens or face a fine of 20 gp, incarceration,

or expulsion.

Despite this mandatory fee, Everlund has no shortage of

adventurers paying a call on the city. This important trading

center is popular with many adventurers because it offers a

wealth  of  amenities,  entertainments,  and  employment  op-

portunities. Rare is the day when a merchant caravan does

not  require  extra  guards  for  its  journey  along  the  roads  of

the  Marches,  and  nearly  any  adventurer  can  earn  coin

simply by making himself available at the caravan muster-

ing points in and around the city.

Quaervarr: Adventurers are welcome in this hamlet, pro-

vided  that  they  adhere  to  two  important  local  laws.  First,

adventurers are not allowed to compete with the Whistling

Stag for hunting party business; the inn has the towns ex-

clusive charter to provide guides to those wishing to use the

town as a base for game hunting. Second, the town prohibits

the public assembly of more than four well-armed persons

at one time without the sanction of the Speaker. The town

has  experienced  too  often  what  happens  when  a  party  of

86

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 87

People of the Silver Marches

well-equipped adventurers imbibes a little too much of the

Stags fine spirits and then wanders the streets, and it would

prefer to avoid such incidents if at all possible.

Quaervarr is currently caught up in a near panic because

of  the  threat  poised  by  the  lycanthropes  dwelling  in  the

Moonwood.  The  inhabitants  are  distrustful  of  strangers  at

the moment, because they fear that any unknown face could

be a spy or agent of the Black Blood. However, an adventur-

ing party that convinces the town government of its good in-

tentions  stands  an  excellent  chance  of  receiving  a

commission  to  help  protect  the  town  from  the  werebeasts

that lurk in the dense forest.

Silverymoon: All except drow are welcome in the Gem of

the North, and adventurers need pay no special fees for ad-

mittance  to  the  city.  The  citys  formidable  wards  help  to

limit the threat of evil infiltrators in the city. As with Ever-

lund, Silverymoon is a good place for adventurers to sign on

with  caravans  bound  for  cities  both  near  and  far.  In  addi-

tion, many adventurers come from all corners of Faern to

offer  their  swords  in  the  service  of  High  Lady  Alustriel,

drawn  by  stories  of  her  beauty,  wisdom,  and  grace.  Skilled

heroes of good heart can aspire to join the Knights in Silver,

the  Spellguard  (as  probationary  members,  anyway)  or  the

Argent Legion of the League with little trouble, although

theyre expected to spend at least half their time attending

to the duties of their new position. Joining the High Guard

is  somewhat  more  difficult,  since  years  of  loyal  service  in

the Knights in Silver is a prerequisite to moving on to the

palace guards.

Sundabar:  Adventurers  are  welcome  in  Sundabar,  but

they must report to and register with the office of a gov-

ernment  official  to  receive  permission  to  remain  in  the

city.  The  office  maintains  a  list  of  jobs  and  tasks  for

which  the  city  is  willing  to  hire  adventuring  bands.  The

most common jobs are clearing a specific area of hostile

creatures,  patrolling  areas  frequented  by  miners  and

prospectors,  and  escorting  outbound  caravans  through

Moon  Pass.  Adventurers  who  seek  employment  are  pre-

sented with a city charter that delineates their task and es-

tablishes  the  parameters  of  their  authority;  the  party

must  present  the  charter  on  demand  to  any  member  of

the  city  government  or  military  who  wishes  to  examine

the partys credentials.

Adventurers  are  paid  depending  on  the  nature  of  the

work they are engaged to perform. Rewards vary by season

(higher in the winter when there are fewer adventuring par-

ties  willing  to  risk  the  weather  hazards,  and  lower  in  the

warmer months), and the current perceived threat level to

the city (when an orc horde is massing, scouting and spying

can be highly lucrative). Finally, the charters stipulate that

adventuring  parties  that  acquire  treasure  in  the  course  of

their job must surrender 10% of the value of their loot to

the city as a fee for being granted a charter.

RUINS, TOMBS, AND DUNGEONS

Many of Faerns most famous dungeons are located in or

near  the  Silver  Marches.  Exploring  these  ruins  and  crypts

can  be  extremely  lucrative  .  .  .  and  extremely  deadly.  A

number  of  adventure  sites  are  described  in  Chapter  1  and

Chapter 8 of this book, in addition to the dungeons described

in Chapter 8 of the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting.

In  most  cases,  adventurers  are  entitled  to  explore  any

place they can reach and keep anything they find. There are

exceptions,  though.  Most  of  the  human  towns  in  the

marches  have  laws  against  despoiling  Uthgardt  mounds  or

trading in goods taken from Uthgardt burial sites. The Uth-

gardt  themselves  dont  bother  to  make  up  laws  about  such

thingsthey  just  do  everything  in  their  power  to  punish

anyone foolish enough to rifle through the resting places of

their dead.

The  shield  dwarves  of  the  Silver  Marches  generally

hold  that  anything  found  in  an  old  dwarf  structure  be-

longs  to  the  recognized  descendants  of  the  dwarves  who

once lived there. In some cases, such as the rumored mines

beneath the High Forest, no heirs are known to exist. On

the other hand, the dungeons beneath Fell Pass are held to

be the rightful inheritance of Clan Steelshield, currently

residing in Citadel Adbar. The Steelshield dwarves number

no more than a few dozen, and theyre mostly craftsmen

(armorers, to be precise), not warriors. But they claim de-

scent  from  Auvorshal  Steelshield,  the  old  hero  of  the

battle of Fell Pass, who once ruled as lord of the caverns

there. Should word reach the Steelshields today of anyone

plundering  the  dungeons  of  Fell  Pass,  they  will  demand

the return of their rightful treasureand Harbromm of

Citadel  Adbar  would  likely  to  be  forced  to  stand  behind

those  demands,  or  at  least  seek  some  kind  of  compensa-

tion for the Steelshields.

Defense and

Warcraft

The  people  of  the  Silver  Marches  are  familiar  with  war-

fare.  Even  if  they  dont  seek  war,  war  often  finds  them.

The  first  and  foremost  means  of  defense  in  the  North  is

the  community  itself.  Even  if  it  lacks  a  defensive  wall,  a

settlement  of  concentrated  structures  is  easier  to  defend

than  a  bunch  of  individual  buildings  separated  from  one

another.  Most  citizens  of  the  Silver  Marches  therefore

shelter behind walls whenever possible, and whether those

walls  are  constructed  from  stone  or  wood  or  earth  it  is

always among the communitys foremost priorities to keep

them  constantly  patrolled  and  well  maintained.  Its  also

customary  for  a  city  to  maintain  some  kind  of  warning

device, such as horns, gongs, or drums, with which to warn

the citizenry of an imminent threat.

The city watch or militia is the next link in a communitys

chain  of  defense.  Sometimes  these  groups  are  made  up  of

professional,  full-time  soldiers  and  sometimes  theyre  part-

time volunteers. The soldiers of these groups are almost uni-

versally trained and equipped with simple martial weapons,

usually some kind of sword; most of them are also proficient

with simple ranged weapons. Most Silver Marches communi-

ties  patrol  their  walls  day  and  night,  and  some  refuse  to

allow strangers to enter or exit after nightfall.

Strategies and Tactics

Collectively, the armies of the Silver Marches do not out-

number the sum total forces of their many enemies. Com-

bined, the sheer number of orcs, trolls, giants, gnolls, and

fell beasts wandering the land would probably overwhelm

the  mustered  forces  of  the  Marches,  despite  the  bravery

and magical support of the latter. Fortunately, the various

monsters and humanoids rarely, if ever, assemble under one

command. Thus the military leaders in the region can often

concentrate on just one or two foes at a time, making their

task much simpler (though by no means easy). Also work-

ing in their favor is the fact that their humanoid and mon-

strous  enemies  are  usually  disorganized  and  lack  magical

support, and can be defeated with less loss of life than if the

foe were a disciplined enemy armed with deadly and preva-

lent magic.

For the most part, the cities of the Silver Marches keep

the bulk of their forces close to home. Danger can descend

too quickly to risk being caught with defenders scattered in

small garrisons too far away to help. In times of great peril,

the cities of the Marches are sworn to send help to one an-

other, but its unlikely that more than half the soldiers of a

particular  city  would  be  dispatched  to  deal  with  a  threat

somewhere else in the Marches. Some fear that, when true

peril  threatens,  one  or  more  of  the  cities  might  fail  to

honor  their  obligation  and  refuse  to  send  off  troops  who

might be used in the defense of their own walls. When that

day comes, Faern will find out whether the league of the

Silver Marches will stand or fall.

To  make  up  for  this  conservative  concentration  of

troops  in  their  home  cities,  all  the  major  townsSilvery-

moon, Everlund, Sundabar, and the dwarf citadelsvigor-

ously patrol and scout the land for a two- to three-day ride

from  their  walls.  Patrols  often  undertake  sweep-and-clear

missions,  ranging  through  the  wilderness  outside  the  city

gates  and  exterminating  or  driving  off  hostile  creatures.

Squads or companies may be dispatched with orders to deal

with specific threats, such as a band of gnolls lurking too

near some farmsteads, brigands raiding an important trade

route, or a dire bear that hunts too close to a useful ford.

These missions are often augmented by spellcasters, partic-

ularly clerics, sorcerers and wizards, but sometimes by will-

ing bards, druids or rangers as well.

When  serious  danger  threatens  a  communitysuch  as

when a horde of orcs is on the marchthe local military

leaders post numerous scouts and call all militia members

into  service,  arming  them.  Typically  the  warning  devices

are  sounded  and,  if  possible,  ample  time  is  afforded  any

townsfolk outside the walls to get inside before the gates

are closed. Once closed, the gates are unlikely to be opened

while the hostile force is present, except to permit the exit

of defending troops. Citizens normally remain indoors at

such times, unless they are actively assisting the defenders

by  tending  the  wounded,  carting  supplies,  building  barri-

cades,  or  the  like;  otherwise,  they  are  only  in  the  way.

When things go badly for the defenders, however, civilian

volunteers  and  conscripts  may  become  necessary  compo-

nents of the towns survival.

from  the  six  signatory  cities  of  the  League  of  the  Silver

Marches: Citadel Adbar, Citadel Felbarr, Everlund, Mithral

Hall,  Silverymoon,  and  Sundabar.  Local  militias  and  town

watches defend their own homes and patrol no farther than

their own fields, for the most part.

The Muster of the North

The  cities  of  the  Silver  Marches  command,  between  them,

half a dozen standing armies, a patchwork of volunteer mili-

tias and town guards, and a handful of specialized fighting

units. This martial array is maintained for one purpose: to

defend  homes  and  citizens  against  the  ferocious  enemies

howling for blood.

One of Alustriels initiatives this year has been an attempt

to  persuade  the  league  signatories  to  create  a  common  de-

fense fund. Under her plan, the confederation council would

have discretion over the money in the fund, with the under-

standing that it is to be spent only on projects or activities

that  directly  benefit  the  safety  and  security  of  the  Silver

Marches. Alustriel believes that some of the money could be

used to help strengthen the physical defenses of those com-

munities in which such elements are in disrepair or lacking.

Examples of projects she thinks would be appropriate are re-

placing a towns wooden walls with stone, purchasing better

arms and armor for city soldiers, hiring more scouts, and ac-

quiring magic items with which to equip soldiers and spell-

casters who support them.

So  far  the  proposal  has  met  with  lukewarm  sentiment

from  the  larger  communities  (although  Bruenor  of

Mithral  Hall  enthusiastically  supports  the  notion).  The

great cities believe, with good reason, that their contribu-

tions will benefit the smaller Silver Marches communities

more  than  themselves.  These  cities  have  also  expressed

some concern about the process by which the money in the

fund might be allocated. Its clear that Lady Alustriel must

exercise  her  persuasive  powers  carefully  in  wooing  these

communities to her point of view.

Alustriel has conceived another use for the money in the

fund,  but  has  mentioned  it  thus  far  only  to  Bruenor  and

some of her most trusted counselors. The fund could also be

used  to  help  rebuild  cities  ravaged  by  war.  The  High  Lady

suspects that the confederation may not actually be able to

defend  every  member  community  in  the  event  of  a  major

attack by King Obould Many-Arrows or a similarly powerful

foe. It may well come to pass that when the orc kings horde

finally arrives, the confederation will be obliged to choose to

defend one city but not another, in effect sacrificing some so

that others can be saved.

Although  this  strategy  is  an  accepted  practice  in

wartime,  both  Alustriel  and  Bruenor  understand  that  the

rest of the Silver Marches wont take to it. Each commu-

nity would wish to be the one saved, and most would refuse

to  accept  that  another  was  more  valuable  to  the  leagues

long-term  survival.  Until  they  can  persuade  the  other

members of the pact to pay into the common fund, Alus-

triel and Bruenor plan to keep this aspect of the scheme a

private matter.

The  muster  of  the  North  gathers  most  of  its  strength

CITADEL ADBAR

King  Harbromm  commands  three  distinct  forces:  the  Iron

Guard, the Deepscouts, and the Hammers of Moradin. The

city watch and Harbromms personal guard are drawn from

the Iron Guard.

Iron Guard: 1,404 heavy infantry; 601 crossbowmen; 451

warpony cavalry.

The Deepscouts: 20 elite scouts, rogues and rangers of 4th

level or higher.

The  Hammers  of  Moradin:  27  clerics,  monks,  and  pal-

adins of 6th level or higher.

In  desperate  times,  Citadel  Adbar  could  muster  at  least

2,000 well-armed militia.

CITADEL FELBARR

Felbarrs troops are known as the Citadel Guards. The town

watch  and  King  Warcrowns  bodyguards  are  drawn  from

this body.

Citadel  Guards:  401  heavy  infantry,  250  crossbowmen,

and 131 warpony cavalry.

EVERLUND

First Elder Kayl Moorwalker, as the High Captain of Ever-

lund,  is  the  commander  of  Everlunds  army,  the  Army  of

the Vale. The City Watch is administered by Malvin Draga,

the Keeper of the Bridges.

Army  of  the  Vale:  201  heavy  infantry,  400  light  in-

fantry, 301 elf archers, 301 light cavalry, 151 heavy cavalry.

City Watch: 187 watchmen (committed to battle only in

extreme situations).

MITHRAL HALL

King  Bruenors  army  is  known  as  the  Host  of  the  Hall.

The Host provides the town watch in addition to defend-

ing  Mithral  Hall.  An  elite  Royal  Guard  follows  Bruenor

into battle.

The Host of the Hall: 380 heavy infantry, 103 crossbow-

men, 52 warpony cavalry.

The Royal Guard: 21 elite infantry, all of 4th level or higher.

SILVERYMOON

The Gem of the North is defended by the famous Knights in

Silver, under the command of Sernius Alathar, and the Spell-

guard, commanded by Jorus Azuremantle. The High Guard

of the palace rides to battle only when the High Mage him-

self decides to take the field. The Knights in Silver provide

the watch of the town.

Knights in Silver: 704 heavy cavalry.

The  Spellguard:  32  wizards  and  sorcerers  of  5th  level

or higher.

The High Guard: 90 elite palace guards, all of 6th level

or higher.

People of the Silver Marches

SUNDABAR

Helm  Dwarf-friend  has  integrated  his  former  mercenary

company with the Shieldsar, the army of Sundabar. His per-

sonal guard is drawn from mercenaries who once served with

him. The Stone Shields are the citys watch, and the Watch-

ful is a band of expert spies.

The Shieldsar: 626 heavy infantry, 308 archers, 325 light

cavalry, and 173 heavy cavalry.

The Stone Shields: 83 watchmen.

The  Watchful:  39  spies,  informants,  and  investigators,

most rogues, experts, and commoners of 3rd level or higher.

THE ARGENT LEGION

The  army  of  the  Silver  Marches  league  is  known  as  the

Argent  Legion.  It  is  composed  of  units  drawn  from  the

armies of each of the signatory cities. The Legion is head-

quartered in Rauvinwatch Keep, on the outskirts of Silvery-

moon, under the command of High Marshal Methrammar

Aerasum.    Most  of  the  Argent  Legions  forces  are  dis-

persed in garrisons and patrols throughout the territory of

the Silver Marches, providing for the first time a measure

of security to settlers and homesteaders who live far from

city walls.

The current commitments to the Argent Legion include

200 Knights in Silver from Silverymoon, 250 Iron Guard

from  Citadel  Adbar,  200  Shieldsar  from  Sundabar,  100

archers and cavalrymen from Everlunds Army of the Vale,

50  dwarves  from  Citadel  Felbarr,  and  50  from  Mithral

Hall, for a total strength of 850 troops. (These troops are

still  included  in  their  home  cities  descriptions,  since  com-

mitments  and  force  dispositions  vary  from  tenday  to

tenday). Some cities are in the habit of sending green troops

who arent considered too valuable to waste on League busi-

ness, but under Methrammar, the Argent Legions vigorous

patrols  and  skirmishing  are  making  veterans  of  even  the

most woeful troops in his command.

For now, the Legions forces are assigned as follows: 200

in  Citadel  Felbarr,  200  in  Sundabar,  50  in  Jalanthar,  and

400 in Rauvinwatch Keep. The High Marshal plans to send

another troop of 50 soldiers to Quaervarr soon in order to

provide  some  security  against  the  monsters  threatening

that town.

RANGERS AND SCOUTS

Counted  as  part  of  no  citys  muster,  the  wilderness  war-

riors of the North are few in number compared to the as-

sembled  armies  of  the  Silver  Marchesbut  taken

together, they may be as important to the defense of the

region as the martial might of Sundabar or Citadel Adbar.

Many  good  rangers  operate  in  the  Silver  Marches,  con-

tributing to the security and prosperity of the confedera-

tion  and  its  communities  in  a  variety  of  ways.  They

provide  invaluable  intelligence  about  the  movements  of

enemies such as King Oboulds forces, counter the under-

takings of orc marauders and scouts, deal with aggressive

beasts  and  monsters  before  they  threaten  civilized  areas,

and offer guidance to those whose work or plans take them

out into the trackless wilderness.

developments occurring in the regions beyond the city walls.

They frequently trade news with each other in order to cor-

relate  events  and  sightings  that  might  add  up  to  a  rising

threat of some kind, and then pass on their suspicions to the

folk  of  the  Marches.  Needless  to  say,  these  rangers  are  ac-

corded  great  respect  by  the  folk  of  the  Silver  Marches.  In

many  towns,  a  known  ranger  cant  pay  for  his  own  ale,

dinner, or room when he passes through.

Rangers are not the only characters who use their skill in

the  wilderness  to  guard  the  towns  and  settlements  of  the

Marches. Good-hearted Uthgardt barbarians rarely allow evil

creatures to threaten anyone, even the soft folk of the towns.

Druids, Harper scouts, and rogues with skills slanted toward

stealth and observation also scout in these lands. Chapter 6,

Heroes of the North, describes several prestige classes such as

the giant-killer, wild scout, and peerless archer who also serve

the Silver Marches in this vital capacity.

Armies and Militias

The  various  armies  and  soldiery  of  the  Silver  Marches

have had ample opportunity to gain an unusual amount of

experience  fighting  against  the  humanoids  and  monsters

that threaten the North. Compared to the standing armies

of most other lands, the soldiers of the Silver Marches are

hardened veterans. Unfortunately for them, so are many

of their enemies.

Most patrols and wilderness squads are mounted on light

warhorses (heavy warhorses are generally reserved for cav-

alry).  Those  on  foot  usually  carry  with  them  adequate  ra-

tions  and  equipment  to  enable  them  to  survive  at  least  a

tenday  in  the  wilderness.  Their  armor  and  weapons  vary

from community to community (see Typical Guards, below),

but it is rare for a member of these patrols to be without at

least  one  martial  melee  weapon,  and  a  simple  or  martial

ranged weapon (the crossbow and longbow are most favored).

Most  wear  leather,  studded  leather,  or  chain  shirt  armor.

Typical forces of the Silver Marches include dwarf heavy in-

fantry,  elf  archers,  human  light  infantry,  human  cavalry,

and human militia.

THE KNIGHTS IN SILVER

This intrepid fighting force earned its name courtesy of the

bard  Mintiper  Moonsilver,  who  coined  the  phrase  in  a

ballad that recounts the valor of the silver-clad knights as

they  faced  superior  odds  and  emerged  victorious.  Before

Mintipers  lyrics  became  popular,  Silverymoons  elite

squad of defenders seemed ridiculously small and lacking

in proper military discipline (particularly to the dwarves

of Citadel Felbarr). Now, however, the Knights are a wel-

come sight wherever they appear, and many communities

rely  on  their  assistance  when  danger  threatens  to  over-

whelm their defenses.

The Knights in Silver are

famed  for  their  noble  bear-

ing,  and  their  poise  in  the

heat  of  battle  is  legendary.

More  than  a  few  of  their

number have manners equal

to  those  of  a  seasoned

courtier,  and  a  number  of

songs  and  tales  extolling

their chivalrous virtues have

become  popular  in  the  tav-

erns  and  inns  of  the  North.

No  less  notable  is  the

number of battles they have

won,  often  against  superior

numbers  (admittedly  with

the frequent aid of Alustriel

and  other  allies,  such  as  the

Spellguard  or  the  Harpers).

The  Knights  have,  in  fact,

never  been  defeated  on  the

field,  a  reputation  that  in-

stills pride and a sense of re-

sponsibility in them.

When  not  actively  en-

gaged  in  defending  Silvery-

moon  or  an  allied  city

against  attackers,  members

of  the  Knights  in  Silver  un-

dertake  a  variety  of  missions

and tasks, all of which are connected in some way with the

defense of their city and homeland. One of their most fre-

quent  duties  is  to  patrol  the  countryside  in  a  fifty-mile

radius  from  the  city  walls.  These  patrols  are  typically  ac-

companied by a mage from the citys Spellguard (see below).

Members of the Knights are empowered to enforce all the

laws and policies of Silverymoon within their patrol terri-

tory, though they must often exercise their best judgment in

situations that are not specifically covered by the codes gov-

erning their home.

There  are  two  principle  means  of  becoming  one  of  the

Knights in Silver: volunteering, or receiving a commission

91

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 92

People of the Silver Marches

from  Taern  Hornblade.  The  former  is  by  far  the  more

common method. To volunteer for duty in the Knights, an

aspirant  presents  herself  to  Recruiting  Master  Mazillor

Shatterstave (LG male human Ftr7/Knight-errant 5) in the

city  of  Silverymoon.  Master  Shatterstave  receives  appli-

cants only once each month, so if an aspirant misses the re-

cruiting period in a given month, she must wait for the next

to come around.

Applicants must meet several criteria in order to be con-

sidered  for  acceptance,  including  experience  in  battle,  a

knowledge of the Silver Marches that suits Master Shatter-

stave,  and  a  certain  moral  fiber  (sometimes  checked  by

means of a detect evil spell). Characters without much expe-

rience (at 1st level, for example) can join if they are vouched

for by a member of the organization; many of the low-level

knights in the organization are native Silvaeren who hope to

gain experience, prestige, and a position of authority through

serving their city.

Outlanders can join the knights, too, under the same re-

quirements. Master Shatterstave is somewhat forgiving of a

lack of regional knowledge in the case of veterans who are

skilled fighters, but he makes sure that every such applicant

is a man or woman of good heart. All new knights begin as

knights-at-arms, which simply means that theyre not given

any kind of command until they prove themselves. Knights-

at-arms are paid a salary of 15 gp per month.

An experienced fighter who follows orders as a knight-at-

arms and shows any desire for leadership generally advances

quickly. Knight-sergeants lead squads of ten knights-at-arms;

knight-banners  lead  companies  of  fifty  to  one  hundred

knights-at-arms.  The  leaders  of  the  order  are  knight-com-

manders; earning this rank usually requires several years of

outstanding leadership as a knight-banner. Leaders are paid

10 gp per level per month.

An  unusual  institution  is  the  position  of  the  knight-

errant. A knight-errant commands no troops, but answers to

no  one  except  Knight  Grand  Commander  Sernius  Alathar,

leader of the Knights in Silver. A knight-errant is expected

to undertake any duties, tasks, or missions she deems impor-

tant to the safety and well-being of Silverymoon. If a knight-

errant  chooses  to  ride  patrol  or  stand  guard,  fine;  if  she

chooses to travel alone into the Spine of the World to spy on

frost giants, thats fine too.

Many  seasoned  adventurers  aspire  to  this  rank,  since  it

grants  them  the  freedom  to  tackle  any  task  they  deem

worthwhile  without  seeking  a  leave  of  absence  from  their

normal  duties.  Characters  who  take  a  level  in  the  knight-

errant of Silverymoon prestige class are automatically recog-

nized as knights-errant. Other Knights in Silver must apply

to Knight Grand Commander Alathar to be detached from

their  duties  as  knights-errant.  In  other  words,  not  every

knight-errant  must  take  the  knight-errant  prestige  class.

Knights-errant are granted a stipend of 10 gp per level per

month to defray expenses.

New  knights  are  inducted  during  a  ceremony  during

which the Knight Grand Commander reviews and commends

the citys newest defenders. Sernius Alathar personally con-

fers on new knights their badge of office and equipment. The

Knight  Grand  Commander  and  the  High  Mage  of  Silvery-

moon  jointly  preside  over  ceremonies  promoting  new

knight-commanders or detaching new knights-errant.

THE SPELLGUARD

Founded  in  1255  DR  by  Taern  Hornblade,  the  Spellguard

has served as Silverymoons mightiest weapon for more than

one hundred years. Originally Taern founded the order as a

magical  bodyguard  for  Alustriel,  but  as  the  Spellguards

numbers  grew  (and  the  members  proved  their  worth),  this

loyal body of wizards and sorcerers came to hold many more

responsibilities.  While  the  Spellguard  maintains  a  vigilant

watch over the High Palace, it also administers and monitors

the  citys  mythal-based  wards,  sponsors  Silverymoons  Con-

clave of colleges and sages, and rides forth to battle at the

side of the Knights in Silver.

Since  Taern  Hornblade  now  rules  Silverymoon  as  High

Mage, he has appointed his replacement: Jorus Azuremantle,

who carries the title of Lord Warder.

The  Spellguard  currently  numbers  thirty-two  arcane

spellcasters, each of 5th level or higher. All are volunteers,

and  they  are  free  to  resign  their  positions  at  any  time  (in

practice, few do, preferring to take a leave of absence if they

expect to be away from Silverymoon for a long time).

Aspirants  must  demonstrate  to  Jorus  Azuremantle  a

good command of battle-magic by casting several spells in

an audience with the Lord Warder, including at least one

arcane spell of 3rd level or higher. The responsibilities of

the Spellguard are too grave to entrust to a novice. Jorus

also takes steps to ascertain the alignment and true shape

of anyone seeking to join, summoning allied clerics to help

him  interrogate  aspirants  with  detect evil, detect thoughts,

discern lies, and true seeing. Clever and well-prepared spies

have  slipped  through  this  scrutiny  before,  but  the  Spell-

guard  membership  inquisitions  deter  all  but  the  most

daring of villains.

Most characters in the Spellguard are known simply as

Spellguards.  With  time  and  experience,  Spellguards  can

rise to Warders. Currently, seven Warders oversee the ac-

tivities  of  the  twenty-five  Spellguards.  At  least  one

Warder  and  two  Spellguards  are  on  duty  in  the  High

Palace at all times. Unlike with the Knights in Silver, no

Spellguard-errant role exists; any Spellguard is expected

to adhere to a duty schedule that requires her to remain in

the  city,  guarding  the  palace  or  patrolling  with  the

Knights  in  Silver,  for  two  days  out  of  every  tenday.

Warders are busier and generally must spend five days out

of every tenday on duty in or around Silverymoon.

Serving  as  a  Spellguard  is  frequently  a  requirement  for

young  mages  who  seek  to  attend  Silverymoons  wizardly

Conclave. By agreeing to a term of service, a mage can study

at  the  colleges  for  half  of  the  normal  tuition.  In  addition,

Spellguards in good standing draw a salary of 10 gp per level

per month (25 gp per level per month for Warders). As a

Spellguard  member,  a  character  becomes  a  high  official  of

the city and commands significant influence and authority

throughout the Silver Marches.

The Uthgardt

Tribes

The  Uthgardt  are  a  group  of  tall,  black-haired  and  blue-

eyed humans who have lived in the North for many gener-

ations. Each tribe has its own opinion on its exact ancestry,

but none of these tales agrees with the others. Loremasters

speculate that, given the members similar characteristics,

they must stem from common progenitors, most likely a

mix of Illuskans, Netherese, and perhaps one or two other

more  primitive  and  savage  tribes  that  once  roamed  the

high country of the North. Most of the tribes are semino-

madic, wandering through various stretches of the North

while  spending  the  harshest  winter  months  in  one  place,

most often a winter camp. A few tribes have broken with

this  tradition  and  established  permanent  settlements.

With  the  exception  of  the  Black  Lions  and  the  Griffons,

the  Uthgardt  survive  by  hunting,  gathering,  and  raiding

across the territory.

While  each  tribe  has  its  distinct  characteristics  and

idioms, all venerate one of the beast totems of Uthgar. The

barbarians believe that they take their name from Uthgar

Gardolfsson,  a  famed  warrior  of  Ruathym  who  became

known for his triumphs on the field of battle. Yearning for

greater  challenges,  Uthgar  Gardolfsson  set  out  to  conquer

the now-lost civilization of Illusk. While Uthgar succeeded

in  pillaging  Illusk,  the  other  civilized  folk  of  the  Sword

Coast  hastily  mustered  an  army  to  counter  the  North-

landers  invasion.  These  forces  attacked  his  camp  and  de-

stroyed  his  ships.  Cut  off  from  the  sea,  Uthgar  and  his

followers retreated inland; the Illuskans did not follow, con-

tent to believe that monsters would devour the barbarians

in the frozen wilderness.

Despite  the  hardships  they  faced,  Uthgar  and  a  sizable

portion of his army survived. The barbarians sustained them-

selves  by  raiding  settlements  in  the  northern  interior.  He

gained new followers from among the folk of the region he

raided. Some were impressed with his battle prowess; others

simply  preferred  to  join  that  which  could  not  be  easily  de-

feated. Eventually his forces grew so large and powerful that

he was able to exact tribute from many of the northern com-

munities, and most would pay rather than face the fury of

his barbarian horde. Uthgar and the last of his Ruathym fol-

lowers grew wealthy on the coins and goods they extracted by

threat of force.

As  evidenced  by  the  descendants  of  his  great  army,

Uthgar was a strong traditionalist and possessed of a streak

of savage nobility. He considered the villages and hamlets

that paid him tribute to be under his personal protection,

and it was this notion of feudal obligation that would even-

tually  kill  him.  During  the  later  years  of  his  life,  an  orc

horde swept down out of the Spine of the World. Uthgar

and  his  horde  met  the  creatures  in  a  battle  still  remem-

bered  in  the  tribes  oral  histories  and  war  chants.  Uthgar

and  many  other  warriors  died  in  the  battle,  but  they

stemmed the tide of advancing orcs so effectively that few

remained to flee back into their mountains.

Uthgars  followers  buried  their  fallen  chieftain,  along

with an honor guard of seven others who died on the battle-

field. They piled the ground high above his body and covered

the mound with stones to protect it from foraging beasts and

hungry crows, and then placed a single gigantic stone atop

the completed mound. The location of this sacred spot is be-

lieved to be what is now known as Morgurs Mound; it marks

not only the resting place of their founder but the start of a

traditional of burial that has endured to this day.

Tribes of the Silver

Marches

Ten  distinct  tribes  of  Uthgardt  barbarians  remain  in

Faern, but only fourthe Black Lion tribe, the Gray Wolf

tribe, the Red Tiger tribe, and the Sky Pony tribeactually

dwell within the Silver Marches. The other six are scattered

throughout the High Forest, the Savage Frontier, and the

Sword  Coast  North.  This  section  details  the  four  tribes

dwelling in the Marches proper, as well as the Black Ravens,

another tribe that characters are likely to meet while trav-

eling in the area.

THE BLACK LION TRIBE

Although this tribe retains its beast totem name, its mem-

bers no longer revere the Black Lion or Uthgar. Abandoning

their  former  wandering  lifestyle,  the  Black  Lions  con-

structed  a  permanent  settlement  near  Beorunnas  Well.

Likewise, they have turned away from raiding and hunting

as their primary means of support and toward a combination

of agriculture, herding, hunting, and gathering. Tribal clerics

now serve Helm, Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr. One cleric of the

tribe (Patreveni Onehand, CN human male Clr3 of Uthgar)

still serves Uthgar, but his pleas and warnings to his fellow

tribespeople fall on deaf ears. They have had enough of con-

stant warfare, and they long for a less violent and destruc-

tive way of life.

Most of the other Uthgardt tribes, particularly the Red

Tigers,  are  contemptuous  of  the  Black  Lions  decision  to

abandon  tradition.  The  tribes  rationale  for  undergoing

this marked change is explained by their chieftain, Andar

Heartwood  (CN  human  male  Bbn6):  War  with  the  orc

king is coming. Every day it grows nearer. When it finally

arrives, it will sweep everything before it, like the waters

of the spring flood. The Black Lions, too, will perish unless

we plan for our future.

To  this  end,  the  Black  Lions  have  started  to  trade  with

other folk, especially Quaervarr and Sundabar. Where once

the sight of Black Lions walking the streets of a trading city

would be considered rare at best, now it is merely uncommon.

Thus far the tribes economy is small, but agricultural and

herding  success  have  allowed  it  to  grow  rapidly.  It  is  the

chieftains  secret  hopeshared  with  no  one  thus  farthat

he may be able to prevail upon the signatories of the Silver

Marches to accept the Black Lions as a new member, giving

the tribe powerful allies when the orc horde attacks.

The  Black  Lions  town,  Beorunnas  Well,  is  described

in  Chapter  1  of  this  book.  Surrounded  by  a  low  wooden

93

620_088567_001_EN_Ch4a.qxd  4/26/02  1:52 PM  Page 94

People of the Silver Marches

palisade with pens for horses, sheep, and cattle just beyond

the  palisade,  it  might  pass  for  any  of  a  number  of  other

small frontier settlements. The tribe still hunts the forests

and hills near its settlement, but no longer depends solely

on game for survival.

THE BLACK RAVEN TRIBE

The  Black  Ravens  do  not  dwell  in  the  Silver  Marches,  but

they are known throughout the confederation as dangerous

raiders and incorrigible bandits. This ultraconservative tribe

is infamous as the scourge of caravans and travelers whose

journeys originate in the Silver Marches and take them west

toward the Sword Coast North. Riding their giant ravens, the

warriors of the tribe swoop down out of the sky to harry and

defeat  their  chosen  targets.  The  Black  Ravens  particularly

despise clerics who seek to spread their faith in the North,

and they target these enemies whenever possible.

The Black Ravens have earned their reputation as the most

unfriendly of the Uthgardt tribes. They do not tolerate visi-

tors in what they consider to be their territory. Encounters

with the Black Ravens in the Silver Marches are likely to be

with raiders mounted on giant raven steeds. Members of the

tribe are never encountered in any of the communities of the

Silver Marches, and they have nothing but contempt for the

Uthgardt tribes that have chosen to establish permanent set-

tlements. Warriors of the Black Raven tribe will go so far as

to attack Black Lions whenever they meet.

Like  most  antagonists  who  employ  aerial  steeds,  the

Black  Ravens  prefer  to  attack  their  targets  by  ambush

from above. Their preferred targets are fat merchant cara-

vans, and they like to catch these prizes when the victims

are  between  civilized  outposts.  The  stretch  of  Evermoor

Way between Yartar and Everlund is one of their favorite

hunting grounds, as is the eastern end of the Silverymoon

Pass  road  as  it  clears  the  Nether  Mountains  and  arcs

toward Sundabar. Most of the spoils gained from banditry

are sacrificed to their beast totem, because the loot repre-

sents  the  hated  taint  of  civilization.  Contrary  to  popular

belief,  the  Black  Ravens  acts  of  sacrifice  do  not  include

ritual destruction of this lootmerely denying the posses-

sion of these treasures to the rest of the world is sufficient

in their view. Hence, rather than burning or crushing the

spoils  of  their  raids,  the  Black  Ravens  hide  the  loot  away

from the world, storing it in a shrine near their ancestor

mound at Raven Rock.

The  tribal  chieftain  is  Ostagar  Tenfeather  (CN  human

male Bbn8). He is growing old, and many young warriors

are trying to make names for themselves with daring acts

in order to set forth a claim to leadership of the tribe when

he dies.

THE GRAY WOLF TRIBE

The Gray Wolf tribe shares the same ancestor mound as the

Black Ravens (Raven Rock), but its members seldom journey

there any more. All the members of this tribe are afflicted

with  lycanthropy.  Legends  speak  of  the  curse  being  the

wages of the tribes foolish decision to harbor refugees from

the lost city of Gauntlgrym, but the truth of the matter is

lost among the snows of too many winters past. The result is

a  tribe  that  is  now  more  bestial  than  human,  and  more

savage than any of its fellows.

Savagery  is  a  way  of  life  among  the  Gray  Wolves,  and

the tribal leaders teach the younger generations that their

curse of lycanthropy is in fact a mark of distinction, and

something  of  which  they  should  be  proud.  Tales  popular

from  Luskan  to  Citadel  Adbar  tell  of  the  bloodcurdling

rites  the  tribe  performs  under  the  full  moon,  howling

around  its  campfires  like  a  huge  family  of  monstrous

beasts. Prisoners unlucky enough to fall in the hands of the

Gray  Wolves  are  often  sacrificed  to  their  beast  totem  on

these  ceremonial  nights,  sometimes  at  Raven  Rock,  the

Gray Wolf ancestor mound.

Unlike  the  other  lycanthropes  native  to  the  Silver

Marches, the Black Blood, the Gray Wolves have no associa-

tion with Malar. In fact, the two groups give one another a

wide  berth.  The  Gray  Wolves  see  the  lycanthropes  of  the

Black  Blood  as  abominations  in  the  eyes  of  Uthgar.  It  is

almost certainly true that some of the depredations of Black

Blood lycanthropes have been blamed unfairly on the Gray

Wolves.  The  Gray  Wolves  live  primarily  by  hunting,  and

they range far and wide across the northern stretches of the

Marches, the Savage Frontier, and the Sword Coast North.

Encounters with them are rare, but apt to be hostile if the

Gray Wolves believe that they have been insulted or denied a

kill they think is rightfully theirs.

THE RED TIGER TRIBE

The Red Tigers are one of the more traditional of the Uth-

gardt tribes. When folk of the Silver Marches mention the

wild and savage nature of the Uthgardt barbarians, it is often

the Red Tigers to whom they are referring. Proud and fierce,

the tribe maintains no permanent settlements or camps, in-

stead pursuing a nomadic existence far to the north of civi-

lization. Members of the tribe are suspicious of that which

they do not understand, and many Red Tiger warriors would

prefer to fight unarmed than to wield a magic weapon that

came from the hands of an arcane spellcaster.

The tribe numbers approximately one thousand individu-

als,  who  roam  their  hunting  territory  in  small  groups  of

from eight to twenty persons each. Carrying all that they re-

quire with them on their sturdy hill-bred horses, they hunt

and gather throughout the Cold Wood, which they consider

to be their personal hunting grounds. Intruders in the wood

who run afoul of a Red Tiger hunting party are likely to be

attacked, unless they are a demonstrably superior force. The

Red Tigers are not stupid; if they observe a group of intrud-

ers  that  obviously  outclasses  them,  they  split  into  two

groups, one to shadow the enemys movements and the other

to warn the rest of the tribe.

The  Red  Tigers  ancestor  mound  is  Beorunnas  Well,

which they share with the Black Lions.

THE SKY PONY TRIBE

Members of this tribe seem to be constantly on the move,

riding their shaggy mountain-bred horses from their ances-

tor mound at One Stone (in the eaves of the eastern Moon-

wood) westward across the North as far as Icewind Dale. A

few legendary warriors of this tribe acquire pegasus mounts;

a common quest for a true Sky Pony hero is to seek out such

a mount. Unlike most of the other Uthgardt barbarians, the

Sky Ponies perceive their beast totem as a manifestation not

of  Uthgar  but  rather  his  frequent  ally  Tempus.  This  does

not seem to anger Uthgar, perhaps because the Lord of Bat-

tles has never espoused a dogma in which Uthgar could not

see  merit.  As  a  sign  of  its  devotion  to  the  deity,  the  Sky

Pony  tribe  makes  war  on  the  orcs  of  the  North  whenever

possible,  often  tracking  them  high  into  the  mountains  in

order to destroy their homes and erase their threat to the

southern lands.

Uthgardt Characters

Naturally, the Uthgardt tribes are the homelands of many

barbarians,  fighters,  and  rangers.  Rogues  specialized  in

scouting and stealth skills are also found among the bar-

barian  tribes  of  the  North.  While  most  of  the  Uthgardt

tribes are no friends to the civilized settlers of the Silver

Marches  or  the  folk  of  the  cities,  the  better  tribesSky

Pony, Elk, and Black Lionare not necessarily their ene-

mies, either. As long as the frontier stays where it is and

advances  no  farther  into  lands  roamed  by  the  Uthgardt,

these barbarians are likely to reserve their hatred for the

humanoids and monsters of the Spine of the World, hunt-

ing them down any time they venture out of their moun-

tain fastnesses.

Tigers Claws

The  Red  Tigers  consider  it  the  height  of  skill  and

prowess to hunt game armed only with the three-bladed

stone daggers they call tigers claws. These daggers fea-

ture  three  narrow,  very  sharp  blades.  A  strike  with

tigers claws is considered an armed attack.

People of the Silver Marches

An  Uthgardt  can  easily  discern  the  tribal  affiliation  of

another Uthgardt with a few moments of conversation, or a

somewhat  longer  period  of  observation  at  close  range,  by

noting  details  of  dress  and  equipment,  scarring  patterns  or

hairstyle,  and  mannerisms  of  speech.  Uthgardt  characters

can  attempt  to  conceal  their  tribal  affiliation  (a  Disguise

check  would  be  appropriate),  but  this  is  galling  to  most

tribesfolk.  For  non-Uthgardt  characters,  determining  the

tribe  of  a  particular  Uthgardt  barbarian  requires  a  Knowl-

edge (geography) check against DC 15.

BLACK LION CHARACTERS

A player who chooses the Black Lion as his barbarian charac-

ters home tribe should think about how the tribes abandon-

ment of tradition affects his characters outlook on life. Is he

angry with his chieftain for breaking with tradition, deciding

to venture forth into the world in order to carry on the old

ways? Or perhaps he approves of these changes, and seeks to

better understand the world by traveling through it and expe-

riencing what adventures it has to offer. The Black Lion bar-

barian  character  must  beware  members  of  other  tribes,

however. Most other Uthgardt, particularly the Red Tigers,

wont pass up any chance to mock or ridicule a Black Lion

they meet on the trail. Some warriors from other tribes may

even go so far as to attack a Black Lion they encounter out-

side his village.

BLACK RAVEN CHARACTERS

The Black Raven tribe may not be as desirable a homeland

for  a  barbarian  player  character  as  other  tribes.  The  Black

Ravens  are  so  traditional  and  consistently  hateful  toward

civilization that it is unlikely that such a personality could be

anything  other  than  a  hindrance  to  an  adventuring  party.

The  exception  might  occur  when  a  Black  Raven  character

has  left  his  tribe  under  a  cloud  of  some  sort,  and  has  no

choice but to interact with the civilized world.

GRAY WOLF CHARACTERS

A  player  character  barbarian  who  hails  from  the  Gray

Wolf  tribe  is  very  probably  a  lycanthrope,  and  that  pres-

ents some special challenges for most campaigns. The DM

should consult the Powerful Races section of the FORGOT-

TEN REALMS Campaign Setting (in Chapter 1) before per-

mitting  a  player  to  create  a  barbarian  character  that  is

Wulfgar is one of the most famous Uthgardt barbarians

ever to leave the North. He was the son of an important

leader of the Elk tribe in far-off Icewind Dale. His father

was  loyal  and  acted  from  a  devotion  and  loyalty  to  the

tribe as a whole, but did not support the chieftain himself.

Hoping to forge a better life for himself and his family,

Wulfgars father prepared to undertake a great quest that

would,  when  concluded,  enable  him  to  unseat  the  chief-

tain, but he was slain in battle before he could complete

his quest.

After  his  fathers  death,  Wulfgar  met  Bruenor  Battle-

hammer,  the  old  dwarf  who  would  become  his  lifelong

friend  and  adoptive  father,  when  the  united  barbarian

tribes tried to raid Ten Towns in Icewind Dale. The dwarf

defeated  Wulfgar  in  battle,  but  he  saw  something  intelli-

gent and significant in the boys demeanor and spared his

life.  Instead  he  claimed  five  years  of  servitude  from  the

barbarian.  Wulfgar  hated  the  bargain  at  first,  but  those

five years with Bruenor changed his life. The dwarf became

the  lads  mentor,  and  as  he  grew  he  learned  a  great  deal

about the world around him. Most important, he learned

from  Bruenor  the  value  of  patience  and  honor,  and  he

strove to instill these traits within himself.

After he and the famed Drizzt DoUrden slew the great

white  dragon  Icingdeath,  Wulfgar  challenged  the  Elk

chieftain for leadership of the tribe and slew him. He then

allied  his  tribe  with  the  folk  of  Ten  Towns  to  defeat  a

common  enemy,  finally  turning  leadership  of  the  tribe

over to a close friend he trusted.

Together with Bruenor and Drizzt, as well as compan-

ions Regis the halfling and Catti-Brie (whom he later mar-

ried),  Wulfgar  participated  in  numerous  adventures,

including  the  discovery  and  reconquest  of  Mithral  Hall.

His friends believed him dead after he apparently sacrificed

himself  to  save  them  from  a  handmaiden  of  Lolth,  but

they later discovered that Wulfgar had instead been taken

prisoner by a demon. Wulfgar has since escaped the Abyss

and now roams the North again, in search of adventure.

order to celebrate their holy days. Some make their winter

ous time of the year.

RED TIGER CHARACTERS

The Red Tiger tribe makes an excellent choice for a player

character barbarian. Though the Red Tigers are conservative

and  aloof,  it  is  possible  to  play  a

tribe  member  who  has  decided  to

strike  out  on  his  own  for  a  time.

Red  Tigers  who  join  adventuring

companies most often do so out of

a  sense  of  loyalty  or  gratitude

(often to repay a debt), and some-

times for the opportunity to match

their  battle  prowess  against  new

and different foes.

SKY PONY CHARACTERS

The Sky Pony tribe is another good

choice for a player interested in

running  an  Uthgardt  charac-

ter.  The  Sky  Ponies  are  some-

what less conservative than

the  Red  Tigers  and  more

likely  to  fit  in  well  with

adventuring  bands  from

civilized lands. Many Sky Pony

barbarians  choose  feats  and

skills  oriented

toward

mounted combat, and often

bring  their  excellent

warhorses  with  them  when

they  take  up  the  life  of

an adventurer.

Wulfgar

Ancestor

Mounds

These huge earth-and-stone mounds are the holiest of sites

to the Uthgardt. The mounds are the tribes sacred burial

grounds, and it is here that they inter the bodies of their

greatest chieftains, most heroic warriors, and most vener-

ated  spiritual  leaders.  Most  tribes  also  believe  that  the

bones of their founders rest beneath their respective ances-

tor  mounds,  and  it  is  this  belief  that  makes  the  sites  the

center of Uthgardt spiritual life. Many of the tribes return

to  their  ancestor  mounds  at  specific  times  of  the  year  in

All  the  ancestor  mounds  are  constructed  in  a  similar

manner.  Two  outer  rings  built  from  rocks

surround  a  single,  larger  altar  mound.

Both  the  outer  rings  and

the central mound func-

tion as cairns, and the

tribes  bury  the

bodies  of  their

honored  dead be-

neath  each.  The

outer cairn rings

are  for  the

mighty warriors

who  merit  bu-

rial  at  an  an-

cestor  mound  by

virtue of valorous deeds. The

altar  mound  is  reserved  for

the  great  chieftains  and

clerics  of  the  tribe.  Nor-

mally,  only  tribal  clerics

know  the  exact  location

of  the  remains  interred

within  the  mounds,  and

this

is

guarded  jealously.  The

burial  rites  themselves

vary  from  tribe  to

tribe. Among the Black

Lions, for example, the

entire tribe participates in

the  burial  service,  while

among  the  Red  Tigers,  only

the  clerics  may  perform  the

sacred  burial  rites  after  the  rest  of  the

knowledge

tribe has paid its final respects to the dead.

Most folk living in the Silver Marches give the ancestor

mounds a wide berth. Tales and legends concerning the grisly

fate of those who foolishly attempted to violate an ancestor

mound serve to heighten the aura of mystery and danger that

surrounds these sites. It is commonly believed that vengeful

spirits and ghostly forces guard the mounds against would-be

intruders or tomb robbers. In truth, the only guards at an an-

cestor  mound  are  those  placed  there  by  the  tribe.  In  some

tribes, such as the Red Tigers and the Black Ravens, defending

the ancestor mound against possible defilers is an honor.

and

Forlorn  dungeons  and  uncharted  wildernesses  are

not the only places where peril lurks in the North.

Alustriels league has many enemies in the neigh-

boring lands, both overt (such as the orc king Obould and

the  drow  of  Menzoberranzan)  and  covert  (such  as  the

Zhentarim and the Arcane Brotherhood). A strong and en-

lightened realm in the North would serve as a mighty bul-

wark  of  good  against  the  forces  that  seek  to  dominate  or

enslave Faern.

The Silver Marches has internal as well as external ene-

mies.  Old  rivalries  between  races,  cities,  and  deities  still

stand between true rapprochement among the cities of the

league.  Many  powerful  merchants  chafe  under  the  strict

guidelines against wanton logging, hunting, and mining of

the  Norths  resources  enforced  by  Alustriel  and  the  cities

friendly  to  her.  Some  entertain  schemes  of  replacing  gov-

ernments  strongly  influenced  by  the  faiths  of  various

nature deities with governments focused on the pursuit of

wealth and the growth of commerce. Haughty nobles rebel

at the idea of surrendering the sovereignty of their cities to

the leagues collective rule, and subjugating their own pres-

tige and influence to popular mandates.

The notion that justice must apply equally to all citizens

regardless  of  class  is  not  always  a  popular  one  among  the

landed  or  wealthy.  Alustriel  has  taken  few  steps  to  instill

these values in the league of the Silver Marches, but her op-

ponents look to Silverymoon as an example of how she has

ruled in the past. They fear that the principles on which the

Gem  of  the  North  was  built  may  be  rammed  down  their

throats under Alustriels league.

Recent History

The known history of the North is a violent succession of

battles,  orc  hordes,  dragon  raids,  severe  winters,  monster

rampages,  feuds  between  barbarian  tribes,  and  disputes  be-

tween rival wizards. Poor communications have made it dif-

ficult to see causes and effects or the broad sweep of events,

because so much simply goes unreportedthe victors con-

ceal what they have done, and the vanquished are dead.

A fragmentary summation of some major events of the

last half-dozen years can be woven, however, as follows.

1367 An  orc  horde  led  by  King  Greneire  descends  from

the  Spine  of  the  World  and  besieges  the  orc-held

Citadel  of  Many  Arrows  for  four  months.  King

Obould  of  the  Citadel  slays  Greneire,  but  the  ex-

hausted orcs of both armies are driven from the field

by  the  dwarves  of  Clan  Warcrown,  bolstered  by

knights from Silverymoon.

The  dwarves  seize  the  Citadel  and  restore  its  old

dwarf  name  of  Felbarr.  Emerus  Warcrown  pro-

claims himself King of Citadel Felbarr.

The Harpell family of Longsaddle opens a trade-

road  between  Longsaddle  and  Nesm,  hiring  many

adventurers

in  Waterdeep,  Neverwinter,  and

Mirabar to patrol it. A severe winter follows.

Zhent-sponsored  adventurers  break  into  the  Great

Worm  Cavern,  slaying  Elrem  the  Wise,  shaman

leader of the Great Worm Uthgardt tribe.

Nesm reports a dramatic rise in troll attacks. The

Evermoors  and  the  Harpell  trade-road  become  too

dangerous  for  most  merchants,  paved  with  the

troll-gnawed bones of Harpell hireswords.

The  Blue  Bear  tribe  marches  on  Hellgate  Keep.

Instead  of  being  slaughtered  by  its  fiends,  the  Blue

Bear win through, and their chieftan Tanta Hagara

becomes ruler of the keep, dumbfounding folk across

the North.

Politics and Power

1369 Demon  armies  out  of  Hellgate  Keep  attack

Silverymoon,  the  Citadel  of  the  Mists,  and

Sundabar. They breach the walls of Sundabar, set-

ting  fires  and  working  much  slaughter  before

being driven off.

With  the  aid  of  two  Harper  adventurers,  the

Mistmaster uses an item of great magic to collapse

the  wards  of  Hellgate  Keep,  destroying  the  place.

The treant Turlang leads an army of woodland crea-

tures,  aided  by  forces  from  several  cities  in  the

North, in battle against the last Hellgate army. The

demons are destroyed.

Giants appear in numbers on the Evermoors and

assault Nesm, battering the city. Trolls driven out

of the moors plague the lands to the south. A rela-

tively  mild  winter  fails  to  slow  the  giants,  or  the

troll  depredations.  Many  steadings  near  the  Ever-

moor Way fall.

1370 Turlang leads a march of the High Forest to the

north  and  east,  reclaiming  areas  cleared  in  recent

decades.  Treants  seal  the  ruined  cellars  of  Hellgate

Keep, to keep lurking evil inand foolish treasure-

seekers out.

Word of the keeps fall inspires a rush of adven-

turers  into  the  Delimbiyr  Vale,  seeking  magic  and

riches lying abandoned. Their forays into the moun-

tains  awaken  monsters  not  seen  for  years,  and  stir

fears of another orc horde soon appearing.

1371 After  four  years  of  intense  diplomacy,  Alustriels

dream bears fruit at last: The League of the Silver

Marches is proclaimed a realm by the High Heralds

across  Faern.  Its  nascent  army,  the  Argent

Legion, begins patrollingand small bands out of

Silverymoon  begin  to  map  its  territory.  Battles

with  trolls  and  orcs  are  many,  culminating  in

reports  of  organized  bands  of  lycanthropes  in  the

northwestern Marches, and strange monsters in the

far eastern Marches.

Trevis  Uhl  leads  a  band  of  ex-Zhent  soldiers  to

Sundabar Vale and founds the settlement of Newfort.

1372 Monster sightings increase, with stranger and more

fearsome  creatures  appearing  by  the  day.  Rangers

and  sages  report  an  apparent  restlessness  among

dragonkind,  leading  to  speculation  that  the  old

Spellguard prophecy about another Flight of Drag-

ons may soon be fulfilled.

Hammer: The City of Shade appears over the Direwood and

drifts east toward Anauroch. The Sharn Wall hemming the

phaerimms beneath Anauroch fails, leading to a fierce phaer-

imm onslaught against the city of Evereska.

Midwinter: The god Bane arises from the form of Iyachtu

Xvim.

Eleint:  Gold  is  discovered  in  the  mountain  streams  above

Deadsnows, setting off a gold rush in the region.

Marpenoth: As autumn falls over the Marches, a spectacular

duel between two gigantic but unidentified dragons enthralls

many as it rages through the skies across the North.

Articles of

conFederation

The League of the Silver Marches is changing rapidly from

the vision of its founding, but it remains the dream and work

of the Bright Lady, Alustriel. It is apparent to all in the civ-

ilized North that they will fall one by one to orc hordes and

other  perils  unless  they  remain  united  in  some  sort  of  al-

liance  with  common  defense,  reconnaissance,  roads,  com-

merce, and foreign relations.

Cooperation on these points is sometimes difficult, since

many  strong-willed  and  independent  rulers  guide  the  great

cities  of  the  North.  The  glue  that  holds  the  Marches  to-

gether  is,  and  has  always  been,  Alustriel.  Shes  the  only

person the bickering leaders could agree upon as a leader

and many folk believe that when she dies, departs, or relin-

quishes the Silver Throne to another, the Marches will fall

apart into independent, rival communities again.

The League of the Silver Marches is officially governed

by  its  council,  convened  every  six  months  (or  more  fre-

quently if needed) by Alustriel. Nine Peers sit on the council.

Each of the six signatory cities sends a representative, usu-

ally  its  ruler,  although  all  have  agreed  to  accept  as  proper

voting members any individuals sent by member communi-

ties, who shall have sole say in choosing their own Peer. The

Commander of the Argent Legion, leader of the new stand-

ing army of the Marches, is the seventh member. The Lord

(or Lady) Protector, the eighth member, represents all the

league protectorates, those communities that belong to the

Marches but are not vested with the power of a true signa-

tory  state.  Finally,  one  rotating  seat  is  reserved  for  a

Member at Large designated at the High Ladys discretion.

Currently the High Herald Old Night holds this position, al-

though Alustriel has promised Lady Icespear of Deadsnows

that she will hold the position next year.

From  these  nine  Peers,  a  High  Lord  (or  Lady)  is  desig-

nated to head the council. This post is currently held by Alus-

triel, who also holds the seat of Lady Protector. When her

term as High Lady is up, she will remain on the council in

that role.

League Bylaws

The  evolving  formal  rules  of  the  federation,  such  as  the

power  of  Alustriel  to  appoint  officers  or  speak  for  the

Marches, and the naming of community representatives, are

referred to as the Articles. These rules are growing so quickly

that only the council, Alustriel and her senior heralds, and

the clerks of member communities know just what the Arti-

cles say at any time. Here are some rules agreed upon to date.

Majority votes of the council decide league policy. The

High  Lady  votes  only  to  break  ties.  The  absence  of

Politics and Power

Peers  does  not  exempt  unrepresented  communities

from  being  bound  by  votes,  which  are  tallied  as  if

absent Peers had abstained.

High  Lady  Alustriel  has  the  sole  power  to  set  the

agenda  of  matters  for  the  councils  consideration,

although  any  Peer  can  propose  new  business  for  the

council. If she chooses not to put an item up for vote,

any  five  Peers  in  concert  may  require  her  to  take  a

vote on a matter of importance. Even if the council

does  not  have  enough  votes  to  put  an  item  on  the

agenda,  no  policy  matter  can  be  deferred  for  longer

than six tendays.

Policies shall be either throne decrees or common de-

crees.  All  league  members  shall  abide  by  and  apply

throne decrees throughout their territory and upon all

of their citizens. If they fail to do so and a complaint

is made by anyone, Alustriel shall be free to investi-

gate in any manner she sees fit. If found in violation,

the signatory has ten days to apply the decree, and is

then inspected; if the signatory refuses or fails inspec-

tion, it is ejected from the Marches. Adherence to the

violated  policy  is  a  requirement  for  reinstatement.

Adherence to common decrees (such as taxes and local

protocol) is optional.

Anyone, citizen or not, can complain or make sugges-

tions to Council on any matter, including urging that

any decree be modified or transformed from one sort

of decree to the other.

The High Lord or Lady of the league (holder of the

Silver  Throne,  currently  Alustriel)  is  the  final  judge

in legal disputes throughout the Marches, and shall be

free to make such orders or take such actions as he or

she sees fit to safeguard the Marches and facilitate its

daily  business.  He  or  she  must  fully  report  all  such

judgments, decisions, and actions to the council. These

decisions are subject to the review and countermand-

ing vote of council.

The High Lady shall not be ruler for life, nor estab-

lish  hereditary  or  blood  claim  to  the  Silver  Throne.

After seven years, the High Lordship shall be deemed

vacant.  Council  members  will  then  vote  to  select  a

new High Lord from their own ranks. Upon the death

or incapacitation of a High Lord or Lady, a designat-

ed alternate (currently Old Night) shall act as High

Lord  until  the  next  council  meeting,  which  shall  be

convened as soon as possible.

Weighty  matters  before  the  council  include  how  much

money poor communities should get from wealthy ones, who

should  oversee  the  federations  spending,  how  much  coin

each member should contribute to the Argent Legion, whom

the  Legion  should  report  to,  and  the  rights  of  citizens  ac-

cused of crimes in other member communities.

League Members

The federation led by Silverymoon is formally known as the

League of the Silver Marches. It consists of six signatories

and a number of protectorates.

The  signatories  of  the  league  are  Citadel  Adbar,  Citadel

Felbarr,  Everlund,  Mithral  Hall,  Silverymoon,  and  Sund-

abar. These are the strongest cities in the region, and as the

main source of the leagues soldiers, revenues, and strength,

they are entitled to a voice in its administration. Each signa-

tory state is entitled to a council seat.

Protectorates of the league are generally smaller commu-

nities that benefit from the common defense and trade prac-

tices of the league, but do not necessarily have real strength

or finances to support the league. Towns such as Quaervarr,

Jalanthar,  Rivermoot,  and  Auvandell  are  protectorates.

Alustriel  wanted  to  give  each  community  an  equal  vote  in

the governance of the league, but several of the big cities

Everlund, Sundabar, and Citadel Adbar, principallybalked

at any arrangement that weighted the  voice of a few hun-

dred people equally with their thousands. The protectorates

are collectively represented at the league council by the Lord

(or  Lady)  Protector.  This  is  Alustriels  title,  although  her

work as the High Lady, the leading council member, over-

shadows her actual seat.

The dividing line between a protectorate and a signatory

is not entirely clear. The league is not necessarily welcoming

of  additional  members  of  either  type,  because  a  new  signa-

tory would gain a vote on the league council, and a new pro-

tectorate would presumably have some call on the common

defense  of  the  Silver  Marches.  In  general,  any  community

big enough to be considered a large town (see Chapter 4 of

the  DUNGEON MASTERs Guide)  or  larger  could  enter  as  a

signatory,  while  smaller  settlements  would  enjoy  protec-

torate status.

How Things Really Work

From  the  beginning,  Alustriel  has  made  private,  informal

deals with various member rulers to create the league and to

hold it together; the seven-year limit on her rule is one such

agreement.  She  has  firmly  established  a  small  cadre  of

chosen heralds as her personal agents and envoys. Whoever

succeeds her on the throne may discover he or she sits alone

and uninformed unless that person employs his or her own

spiesand intrigues among bureaucrats have been the down-

fall of many realms in Faern before this.

How well the league succeeds in making the lives of its cit-

izens better and safer, and even the survival of the federa-

tion  itself,  rests  on  Alustriels  shoulders.  She  has  shown  a

ruthless  side  in  negotiations,  threatening  personal  retribu-

tion against rulers who play games with the Articles or mis-

behave to defy the authority of the throne or to demonstrate

their own perceived supremacy. Despite this ruthlessness, she

is  far  better  known  and  appreciated  for  the  charm  that

earned her the informal title the Queen of Courtly Love.

Simply put, Alustriel truly likes most people she meets; she

remembers  their  personal  likes,  dislikes,  aims,  and  worries,

and  guides  herself  accordingly.  She  works  hard  at  being  a

friend to alland intends to continue to do so when some-

one else takes the Silver Throne. She wants her dream of a

better life for everyone in the North to survive regardless of

whether the League of the Silver Marches does, no matter

who leads it.

Politics and Power

The Current Council

Many Peers behave differently in council meetings than in

public, but this is the heralds summation of their views, am-

bitions, and characters.

Citadel Adbar: The outspoken and aggressive King Har-

bromm is eager to succeed Alustriel as High Lord, because he

considers  himself  the  best  war-leader  in  the  Marches.

Enough talk of civil rights, roads, and protocol! Our league

should  bemust beengaged  in  building  an  empire  so

mighty  that  the  orcs  can  be  scoured  from  the  mountains

once  and  for  all.  If  this  council  stands  in  the  way,  well,

Citadel Adbar has little need to be burdened with the defense

of weaker cities.

Emerus  Warcrown  is  loud,

firm,  and  grim  in  council

dreams of empire are danger-

Harbromm in council

Moorwalker is haughty and proud, and can be cold and cut-

ting in council meetings when angered. Bluster, blades, and

more  warfare  in  the  distant  wilds  are  not  what  we  need.

Roads, trade, river docks, towpaths, wells, granaries, and bea-

cons are the things that benefit folk every day. Wont it be

easier  to  hire  mercenaries  when  we  need  them,  and  in  the

meantime work on giving them something decent to defend?

Buy  seeds,  irrigate,  build  reservoirs  and  houses,  recruit  set-

tlers, and build a realm!

Mithral Hall:  King  Bruenor  Battlehammer  is  calm  and

considered  when  speaking  at  council  meetings,  unless  Har-

bromm has gotten under his skin. He is perhaps the most far-

sighted  on  the  council  after  Alustriel,  but  speaks  seldom.

Bruenor  sees  trouble  ahead  when  Harbromm,  Warcrown,

and Helm contend for the Silver Throne. He hopes that by

supporting their bid for a strong Argent Legion and pushing

to base it in smaller communities, the league will be of some

use to him in fighting the giants, Uthgardt, and the orcs that

will inevitably come his way. If all dwarves of yore were as

self-centered as the Citadel Kings, no wonder Delzoun and all

the rest were swept away!

Silverymoon:  High  Mage  Taern  Hornblade  is  a  listener

on the council more than a talker, but steps in as a grave,

wise referee to outline and clarify positions, matters of dis-

pute, and to identify experts whom the council should con-

sult.  Show  me  Alustriels  will,  and  Ill  firmly  label  it  the

right  wayfor  so  it  is,  and  can  only  continue  to  be.  She

alone  can  see  the  right  way  to  forge  one  great  shield  that

will  let  the  North  grow  strong  behind  it,  and  we  must  do

whatever it takes to keep these warring rulers

together and let them see victory when

next  the  orcs  come,  and  we  stand

strong,  united.  That,  or  the

Silver Marches will be a brief,

bright flame in the lorebooks.

Sundabar:  Helm  Dwarf-

friend,  Lord  of  Sundabar,  is

firm  and  measured  in  his

speech,  which  is  heard  rarely.

He  has  no  time  for  levity,

polite  graces,  or  gentle  words,

and  believes  in  driving  on  to

the  decision,  setting  it  forth

clearly,  and  moving  on  to  the

next.  He  sides  with  the  citadel

kings  often.  There  are  better

ways  to  grow  old  than  sitting

around  a  table  talking.  Strong

blades held ready in many expe-

rienced  fists  must  be  the

anchor upon which anything is

built  in  the  North,  and  every-

thing  follows  from  that.  The

chief  danger  is  in  the  east,  so

our  army  must  gather  there,

not  disperse  to  patrol  roads.

Dreams  become  real  only  at

swordpoint!

The  Argent  Legion:

Methrammar  Aerasum  is  the  High  Marshal.  He  is  soft-

spoken  and  respectful  to  allbut  Harbromm  has  ques-

tioned his battle fitness to serve as High Marshal. I serve

best by stating in all truth whats best for the Legion and

our  task  of  defending  the  Silver  Marchesand  if  all

around  this  table  cleaved  to  the  truth  and  thought  hard

about whats best for the Marches, our work would be easier

and swifter far!

The  Member-at-Large: Shalara  Swordshigh,  the  High

Herald known as Old Night, says almost nothing in council,

except to provide lore and information about current situa-

tions in the North. She has demonstrated both perfect recall

and perfect mimicry in quoting the other Peers words back

at them, but appears to play no favorites, merely striving for

clarity in thought and argument. Other realms have stood

where we now stand. Do you not see how bold and bright this

is? And what glory if it succeeds? Do you care nothing for the

use you can make of what we forge together? Set aside your

differences, and we may build something far stronger than

the mightiest army, something that will outlast us all.

Enemies

and Threats

To reside in the Silver Marches is to accept that one is beset by

enemies  who  are  actively  seeking  ones  death,  and  who  are

making the imminent destruction of ones home a top prior-

ity.  This  section  takes  a  look  at  some  of  the  organizations,

powers, and individuals that currently threaten the safety of

the Marches. Its by no means an exhaustive list; there can be

no doubt other forces are at work whose machinations are not

yet identified.

The Arcane Brotherhood

The Arcane Brotherhood is a small but deadly group of allied

wizards and sorcerers residing in the port city of Luskan. It

is commonly believed throughout the Sword Coast and the

North  that  the  Brotherhood  actually  controls  Luskan

through  chosen  proxies.  From  its  headquarters  high  in  the

dreaded  Host  Tower  Arcane,  the  Brotherhood  directs  its

plans of conquest and control. It is from this awful, brooding

spire that the groups infamous master, Arklem Greeththe

Archmage  Arcane  himselflays  his  plans  to  gain  control

over all territory from the Sword Coast to Anauroch.

Unbeknownst  to  the  citizens  of  the  Silver  Marches,

Arklem  Greeth  has  decreed  that  the  fledgling  confedera-

tion  will  be  the  Brotherhoods  primary  target  in  its  cam-

paign to rule the North. It is the belief of the Archmage

that the youth of the Marches as a political entity makes it

more  vulnerable  than  some  of  the  more  established  king-

doms  and  cities  closer  to  Luskan.  After  the  Brotherhood

controls  the  Marches,  the  Archmage  intends  to  use  the

confederations  resources  (particularly  its  vast  mineral

wealth)  to  equip  and  fund  his  groups  further  conquests.

For a period of time the Brotherhood was largely inactive,

almost a nonentity, so crippled by infighting and open war-

fare between its members that its threat became negligible.

In  recent  months,  however,  the  organization  has  experi-

enced a complete revitalization, and it now pursues its goals

with ruthlessness and efficiency.

The individual who is currently tasked with directing the

Brotherhoods activities in and against the Silver Marches

is  Valindra  Shadowmantle  (NE  female  moon  elf  Wiz10),

who  was  born  in  the  High  Forest  just  over  one  hundred

forty-seven  years  ago.  One  of  the  Arcane  Brotherhoods

four Overwizards, her purview is the groups interests in all

of  the  North.  Valindra  receives  her  instructions  directly

from Arklem Greeth, and reports her progress exclusively

to him.

The sharp-minded elf wizard prides herself on using her

brain before her spells, and relying on her intellect to reach

her goals. She prefers talking with her opponents to trading

spells  with  them,  but  often  her  attempts  at  diplomacy  are

merely  crafty  bluffs  employed  to  put  her  foes  off  their

guard.  She  does  not  hesitate  to  kill  an  enemy  by  whatever

means necessary if the circumstances require it, but she is re-

luctant to expose herself through direct confrontation unless

its absolutely necessary. To that end, she prefers to disguise

her objectives through blinds and misdirection. If Valindra

wanted to spy on a given city, for example, she might pose as

a moon elf noble and then hire a merchant to hire the spies,

in order to make it more difficult for the deed to be traced

back to her should her agents be compromised.

Valindras first priorities are to gain information about

the  Silver  Marches  and  to  destabilize  its  economy.  To  ac-

complish the first objective, she has engaged the services of

perhaps a half dozen spies and sent them to dwell among

the  communities  of  the  Marches.  These  agents  report  to

her only through intermediaries, many of whom are mer-

chants traveling regularly between the communities of the

confederation. The merchants reporting to her are unaware

of her true identity and goals. If the information her con-

tacts  want  passed  to  her  seems  a  little  odd  (the  general

layout of towns and cities, names of persons in authority,

basic attitudes and habits of ordinary people), the gold and

magic items she offers for in return ease their consciences

sufficiently.

The use to which Valindra puts this information is not

nearly as innocent as her merchant dupes might suspect. She

employs (again, through proxies) brigands to raid any non-

Luskan caravans they catch on the roads within the Silver

Marches. It is her intent to make trade for the confedera-

tion  difficult  for  anyone  other  than  Luskan.  The  brigand

groups  are  small  (typically  from  five  to  eight  persons

strong)  but  highly  mobile  and  exceptionally  well  equipped

compared  to  ordinary  banditsa  fact  that  might  work

against Valindra should her raiders encounter intelligent ad-

venturers in the field.

Valindras  final  tactic  for  destabilizing  the  Marches  is

smuggling Thayan memory-loss drugs (acquired legitimately

from  Red  Wizard  enclaves)  into  Silverymoon  and  selling

them at cut-rate prices. It is her hope, as well as the Arch-

mages, that a number of citizens will become addicted to the

drugs, decreasing their ability to react as Valindra steps up

her plans for taking over the area.

People of the Black Blood

The Malar-worshiping lycanthropes of the Moonwood are

not the organized terror that many insist they are. That is

not to say that the People of the Black Blood are not dan-

gerousthey  are,  as  anyone  who  has  ever  fought  against

the group can attestbut they are not unified. Rather, the

organization  is  composed  of  many  small  tribes.  Some-

times  the  tribes  are  groups  of  similar  lycanthropes  (all

werewolves,  all  wererats,  and  so  on),  and  sometimes  they

are simply assemblies of like-minded individuals who have

found common ground.

102

620_088567_001_EN_Ch5a.qxd  4/26/02  4:28 PM  Page 103

Politics and Power

Some  of  the  attitudes  and  traits  that  may  bring  diverse

groups of lycanthropes together are a similar interpretation

of Malars dogma, a common political goal such as the de-

struction of civilization, or merely the desire to be left alone

by the outside world. Most of these tribes dwell in or around

the northern part of the Moonwood, but some stray farther

south  in  a  seminomadic  lifestyle  that  occasionally  brings

them  into  contact  and  conflict  with  the  folk  of  the  Silver

Marches.  For  their  own  part,  many  of  the  people  of  the

Marches are convinced that the werebeasts want nothing less

than to pull down all city walls and burn the settled areas to

the ground. They treat the Black Blood as enemies, and they

are likely to incarcerate or kill any individual members they

discover in their midst.

One such individual is Gerrin of Red Larch, a wererat who

is  spying  on  Sundabar.  Gerrin  belongs  to  the  Claw  Hollow

tribe of lycanthropes that is currently menacing Quaervarr

(see the adventure Black Fury in Chapter 8).

King Obould Many-Arrows

As  he  stands  atop  the  dark  battlements  of  his  mountain

home, orc chieftain King Obould Many-Arrows looks down

upon the lands that will, one day, all be his. There is no doubt

whatever in his mind that this conquest will come to pass;

the only question is when. It must be soon, he knows, if he

wishes to give his eight sons a legacy that will endure beyond

the span of his own lifetime.

The  folk  of  the  Silver  Marches  are  well  aware  that

Obould is out there, somewhere. His name is a watchword

for  vigilance  among  the  town  watches  and  guardsmen  of

the  North.  The  leaders  of  the  league  receive  new  reports

almost  daily  that  the  orc  hordes  that  have  so  often  shat-

tered the peace and prosperity hard won by their predeces-

sors are once again arming for war. Many of the regions

old-timers sagely note that the North is about due for an-

other orc invasion.

For his own part, Obould isnt waiting for the folk of the

lands to the south of his mountain fastness to prepare for

his coming. He intends to strike against them before they

can  make  ready  for  the  onslaught,  and  to  that  end  he  is

taking steps never dreamed of by the leaders who have come

before  him.  Even  now  his  scouts  are  carefully  observing

enemy  defenses,  making  maps  of  the  land  so  that  the  at-

tacking orcs might gain a strategic advantage, and occasion-

ally skirmishing against enemy patrols or units in order to

gauge their strength and observe their battle tactics. Mean-

while, his army grows daily and drills incessantly, and those

Gerrin isnt from Red Larch, but he figures that the place

is far enough away and sufficiently obscure that the odds of

meeting  someone  from  there  are  very  small  indeed.  An

agent  of  the  Black  Blood,  Gerrin  has  actually  made  his

home in Sundabar for the last six years, ever since he con-

tracted lycanthropy from a wererat he fought in the vicin-

ity of One Stone. He was discovered and befriended during

the confusion and terror of his first change by Jarthon, the

werebadger  who  currently  terrorizes  the  community  of

Quaervarr.  Since  then  Gerrin  has  been  one  of  Jarthons

loyal followers, and has put his talents as a ranger and his

advantages as a wererat to good use.

His current assignment for Jarthon is to spy on Sundabar,

where  he  has  successfully  infiltrated  the  household  of  a

wealthy and socially important merchant by posing as a mer-

cenary bodyguard. Once a month, Gerrin leaves Sundabar and

travels northwest to the Moonwood (under the pretense of

visiting his sick aunt in Quaervarr, a lie that the good-hearted

merchant employer believes) to report to Jarthon.

who understand such things are building siege machines for

use against the walls of the southern cities.

Other Humanoids

Orcs  are  not  the  only  humanoids  that  represent  danger  to

the  Silver  Marches.  The  vast  wilderness  of  the  territory  is

home to many others as well.

BUGBEARS

A particularly strong tribe of bugbears, whose name trans-

lates  into  Common  roughly  as

Spine Breakers, dwells in a cavern

complex  below  the  Ice  Mountains.

Dwarf  patrols  from  Citadel  Adbar

have  clashed  repeatedly  with  what

they  describe  as  the  biggest,  mean-

est,  and  most  tenacious  groups  of

bugbears they have ever seen. These

patrols also report that a number of

hobgoblins  fight  under  the  com-

mand of the Spine Breakers.

Hobgoblin  troops  from  Doomspire  in  the  Nether

Mountains  frequently  raid  north  and  south  along  Anau-

rochs edges. While few travelers come this way, hunters,

explorers, and adventurers have run afoul of the Doom-

spire hobgoblins in recent months.

TROLLS

These  fierce  predators  were  once  the  dominant  inhabi-

tants of the Evermoors. In recent years, giants from the

Spine  of  the  World  have  seized  much  of  the  Evermoors

and  claimed  it  as  their  own,  forcing  a  number  of  troll

bands  out  of  the  area.  (Rumor  has  it  that  at  least  one

dragon has joined the invading giants.) There is no doubt

that the folk of Nesm are hard-

est hit by the trolls flight, but

now scores of these horrid crea-

tures  roam  the  Rauvin  Vale,

seeking both prey and new lairs.

As  if  travel  along  the  Ever-

moor  Way  were  not  already

dangerous  enough,  caravans

must now be on guard against

marauding gangs of trolls.

GOBLINS

The  goblins  of  the  Silver  Marches

steer  clear  of  the  larger  communi-

ties. They pose a serious threat prin-

cipally  to  outlying  farms  and

homesteads, or to those who wander

mistakenly  into  their  underground

lairs.  They  are  most  populous  along

the  southern  edge  of  the  Nether

Mountains,  where  they  hunt

and  raid  in  the  wooded  valleys

between  the  River  Rauvin  and

the  High  Forest,  and  the

southern flanks of the Rauvin

Mountains, where three goblin

kingdoms  lie.  Rangers  in  that

vicinity have reportedly slain two

orc  scouting  parties  in  the  last

month,  and  they  were  concerned

to find that goblins were among

their  number,  suggesting  that

the  smaller  humanoids  may

be in league with their larger

kin to the north.

Gerrin of Red Larch

HOBGOBLINS

A self-styled hobgoblin chieftain, perhaps inspired by the ex-

ample  of  King  Obould  Many-Arrows,  is  actively  trying  to

unite several smaller tribes in the eastern flanks of the Frost

Hills. Great Chief Glargulnir (LE male hobgoblin Ftr5) is an

exceptionally large and strong example of his kind. The folk

of Quaervarr, beset as they are with the threat of the Black

Blood,  would  pay  well  for  reliable  information  about  Glar-

gulnirs doings.

House

Dlardrageth

The  members  of  House

Dlardragethor  the  Daemon-

fey,  as  they  are  sometimes

calledare  the  remnants  of  a

once-proud  elf  noble  house

that  mingled  its  bloodline

with  that  of  demons  to  pro-

duce  generations  of  infernal,

hybrid  offspring.  Though  now

few  in  number  after  being  sub-

jected  to  imprisonment  and

stasis  for  countless  centuries,

the  last  of  the  Daemonfey

were recently set free by the de-

struction  of  Hellgate  Keep.  Their

number includes several dozen feyri and an assort-

ment of mortal retainers and associates, all of

whom are led by a pair of half-fiends that re-

lentlessly pursue an agenda of bitter revenge.

All of the Daemonfey, but particularly their

leader  Countess  Sarya,  are  driven  by  an  over-

whelming desire to punish the elves for the terrible suffer-

ing  and  embarrassment  they  foisted  upon  House

Dlardrageth  in  ages  past.  Unfortunately  for  her  agenda,

the  Daemonfeys  numbers  are  simply  too  small  to  effec-

tively  pursue  vengeance  on  a  wide  scale  at  this  time.  The

Daemonfey are forced to hide themselves away in a subter-

ranean  lair  located  beneath  the  ruins  of  Lothen  of  the

Silver  Spires,  near  the  dwarf  ruin  known  as  the  Hall  of

Four Ghosts. From here the countess directs her organiza-

tion in several important activities, such as raiding hidden

620_088567_001_EN_Ch5a.qxd  4/26/02  4:28 PM  Page 105

Politics and Power

caches of weapons and magic, gathering intelligence on the

elves  of  the  North  and  their  allies,  and  increasing  the

groups numbers in preparation for future operations.

The eldest members of the Daemonfey know the location

of a number of underground sites scattered throughout the

North, particularly around the High Forest and the Silver

Marches, that still contain wealth and magic that has been

lost to memory for a number of generations. Sarya has dis-

patched a number of small parties numbering no more than

four or five Daemonfey apiece to locate and plunder the an-

cient caches. Once they are cleared and looted, the Daemon-

fey  then  transform  these  structures  into  boltholes  from

which they conduct further retrieval missions as well as re-

connaissance in the North.

Meanwhile,  individual  Daemonfey  have  made  serious

attempts to observe and understand the changes that have

occurred in the North during their long incarceration. If

they  hope  to  avenge  themselves  on  the  elves  of  the

region, they must come to grips with the events and dif-

ferences  that  shaped  the  territory  in  their  absence.  The

Daemonfey are hampered still by a lack of understanding

and firsthand knowledge about their once-familiar home-

land,  and  so  filling  this  gap  in  their  learning  is  one  of

their top priorities. Most members of the group are capa-

ble of disguising their true appearance through magic, and

they employ this tactic before entering the communities

of the Silver Marches.

The  problem  of  increasing  the  Demonfeys  numbers  is

perhaps  the  most  perplexing,  since  the  groups  agenda  of

hatred and revenge is unappealing at best to many. Sarya and

her  confederates  are  pondering  the  merits  of  approaching

the Arcane Brotherhood to propose an alliance in which the

Brotherhood  would  gain  the  North  in  return  for  allowing

the Daemonfey to wipe out or enslave every last elf in the

area. In the meantime, the countess has put another plan in

motion  to  gain  more  members.  The  Daemonfey  have  ab-

ducted several moon elves from the Silver Marches and are

holding them captive in a nearby bolthole in preparation for

forced breeding with summoned outsiders.

Eventually,  Sarya  will  have  all  the  new  recruits  she

needs to carry out her plans of vengeance against elfkind.

The  sweetest  thing  about  this  part  of  her  plan  is  that  it

heaps pain and suffering on the heads of the captured elves

as a prelude to the greater calamities she plans to inflict on

the race at large. Though they do not know it, elves travel-

ing in the Delimbiyr Vale are at serious risk of capture or

Cierre  is  tall  for  a  dark  elf,  with  an  athletic  build  that

speaks of the time she spends roving through the wilder-

ness. Her most distinctive feature is her eyes, pale amber

orbs that blaze almost orange when her anger is provoked.

When she is encountered in casual situations, her demeanor

is calm if somewhat reserved, though she displays a strong

curiosity  about  other  people  and  places.  She  claims  when

asked  (as  she  is  on  numerous  occasions)  to  have  been  in-

spired  to  leave  her  subterranean  home  by  the  stories  she

heard about the hero Drizzt DoUrden. She explains that

although the ranger is considered a traitor by many drow,

she found the stories of his exploits thrilling and believes

that his example is one that more drow should follow. She

does her best to appear non-threatening when among the

surface folk.

Cierre  is  in  fact  a  spy  for  Menzoberranzan.  A  com-

moner by birth, she was selected for her athletic prowess

and intelligence to train for missions on the surface. Cierre

wanders  from  community  to  community  in  the  Silver

Marches,  asking  questions  when  she  can,  keeping  her

mouth shut and observing carefully when she cant. Every

month  and  a  half  she  returns  to  a  particular  spot  in  the

Nether Mountains, just south of the middle of the Silvery-

moon Pass, to meet with her contacts and impart what in-

formation she has learned about the communities, peoples,

and politics of the confederation.

worse  at  the  hands  of  the  Daemonfey.  It  is  quite  possible

that any reports or rumors characters may hear about miss-

captives from their fate, provided that they can be located

before the Daemonfey complete their repulsive plan. Those

who travel in the company of elves, or who are obviously

allied with or friendly to them, also risk drawing the ire of

the Daemonfey.

For  more  information  about  House  Dlardragdeth,  see

Lords of Darkness.

The Drow

Far below the surface of the land lie the strongholds, cities,

and outposts of the dark elves. From time to time the drow

send forth scouts and spies to gather information about what

is happening on the surface world. Currently the

dark elves of Menzoberranzan have one

important spy at large in the Silver

Marches:  Cierre,  a  ranger  who

trades  on  the  reputation  of  an-

other famed adventurer of her

race and class.

The Giants

There  have  always  been  giants

in  the  region  now  known  as

the  Silver  Marches.  From

the  Spine  of  the  World  to

the  eaves  of  the  High

Forest, these huge folk have

been  a  factor  in  the  settle-

ment  of  the  area  by  other

races.  The  walls  surrounding

the communities of the North

were not raised only to discour-

age  the  orc  hordes,  but  also  to

offer  their  builders  some  measure

of protection against the monstrous

strength of the giants.

FROST GIANTS

Many people have heard the tales of bands

of trolls displaced from the Evermoors by the arrival of

giants. What the folk of the Silver Marches do not yet re-

alize,  however,  is  that  this  occurrence  is  entirely  at  the

design  of  Gerti  Orelsdottr,  a  frost  giant  princess  who

hopes to one day lead her tribe to victory over the people

of the North.

Gertis father is the frost giant jarl Orel the Grayhand. He

is dying, weakening slowly and not expected to live to see two

more winters. Gerti knows that she will inherit the leadership

of the tribe when her father passes away, but she is not will-

ing to wait until that day comes to pass to start preparing for

her reign. She serves Auril, the Frostmaiden, a deity whose

portfolio  of  cold  and  winter  reflects  Gertis  outlook  of

frozen  oppression.  When  she  inherits  her  fathers  mantle,

Cierre

106

Gerti intends to unite the frost giant tribes and lead them in

bringing an eternal winter to the lands of the North.

In  preparation  for  her  future  plans,  Gerti  has  sent  two

raiding parties of frost giants into the Evermoors to begin

transforming that rugged and desolate territory into a base

from which she and the tribe can launch attacks against their

enemies. This group of frost giants includes a total of twenty

warriors, seven noncombatants, eight winter wolves, and six

ogres.  The  overall  leader  of  the  two  bands  is  Snorri

Eivarrson (CE male frost giant Clr5 of Auril/Rnc1), whom

Gerti has trained personally and instructed carefully in the

worship and wishes of the Frostmaiden.

Thus  far,  Snorri  has  accomplished  Gertis  first  order:

Drive out the trolls and make them forever unwelcome in

the  Evermoors,  letting  them  terrorize  the  lands  beyond.

He was aided in this task by Rynnarvyx, Gertis pet dragon.

Snorri  is  now  hard  at  work  carrying  out  her  further  in-

structions, which are to select several suitable locations

among  the  rocky  crags  and  ridges  of  the

Evermoors  and  establish  defensible  out-

posts for the tribes use. Snorris troops

are fortifying these redoubts accord-

ing  to  Gertis  instructions  and

stocking them with supplies.

From these positions, more

frost giants will eventually

create  several  more  strong-

holds  in  the  moorlands.  By  the

time  Gerti  is  the  leader  of  the

tribe,  she  will  have  a  serviceable

bridgehead in the lands to the south.

HILL GIANTS

The  hills  of  the  Silver  Marches  are

havens  for  several  tribes  of  hill

giants.  The  most  populous  is  the

tribe  located  in  the  high  interior

foothills  of  the  Nether  Mountains,

due  west  of  Moruemes  Cave.  Hill

giant  raiding  parties  sometimes  stomp

out of these hills and into the settlements of

the Silver Marches. Deadsnows and Jalanthar have suf-

fered their depredations most recently, losing livestock and

defenders to the marauding creatures.

The native hill giants are not the only ones of their kind

in  the  area,  however.  A  small  band  of  six  hill  giants  cur-

rently works with Snorris troops in the Evermoors. Unlike

some  frost  giants,  Gerti  is  perfectly  willing  to  make  al-

liances with other kinds of giants if doing so serves her ends.

In this case, the hill giants are willing to support the frost

giants  efforts  if  it  means  better  food.  The  hill  giants  are

tasked with most of the hunting for the two giant outposts

established in the Evermoors.

The Shades

Once the greatest trading city of the lost dwarf kingdom of

Delzoun, Ascore is now little more than a sandswept ruin at

the northwestern edge of Anauroch. The desert sands have

620_088567_001_EN_Ch5a.qxd  4/26/02  4:28 PM  Page 107

Politics and Power

not yet claimed the place, but something else hasa force of

Shadovars from the dread City of Shade. Once the mightiest

mages of the destroyed human empire of Netheril, the enig-

matic shades escaped the apocalypse that brought down their

homeland by fleeing to the Plane of Shadow.

The Shadovars have not been idle since their sudden and

unlooked-for return to Faern. In addition to embarking on

a campaign of extermination against their ancient enemies,

the phaerimms, they have busied themselves with conduct-

ing  excavations  and  archaeological  expeditions  at  various

ruined  sites  across  the  Western  Heartlands.  The  Princes  of

Shade intend to reclaim their lost empire, and in support of

that desire they are reclaiming caches of ancient Netherese

magic and technology.

If the dwarves of Delzoun were aware that such treas-

ures  existed  in  what  was  their  most  important  merchant

city,  their  records  do  not  show  it.  Needless  to  say,  King

Harbromm  and  King  Warcrown  are  both  deeply  con-

cerned about what little they have heard about the shades

excavation. If it were not for the ever-present threat of an

orc  invasion  and  pressing  political  demands,  either

monarch might dispatch a sizable squad of dwarf soldiers

to  learn  what  may  be  happening  in  the  former  dwarf

stronghold. Harbromm wonders if there is any way a case

can be made that whatever lies buried under Ascore is the

rightful property of the dwarves, but given the reputation

of the shades and their powers, he is not certain that ad-

vancing  such  a  claim  is  worth  the  risk.  Both  sovereigns

have  let  it  be  known,  quietly,  that  they  are  willing  to

jointly  sponsor  an  expedition  of  their  own  to  determine

exactly what is happening at Ascore . . . and, more impor-

tant, if the shades intend to turn whatever they find there

against the Silver Marches.

The  Shadovars  also  have  inserted  a  limited  number  of

spies into several communities of the Silver MarchesJalan-

thar,  Silverymoon,  and  Sundabar.  These  agents  are  not

Shadovars,  but  paid  informants  who  have  been  engaged  to

help the Shadovars educate themselves about the land that

has changed so much since they last knew it. For now, these

shills  merely  watch  and  report  what  they  see,  particularly

about  troop  movements  and  military  defenses,  but  from

time  to  time  their  masters  may  request  that  they  take  a

more active role (such as acquiring a particular item or docu-

ment of interest to one of the princes, for example, or con-

ducting surveillance on adventurers who may prove a threat

to the shades plans of conquest).

For more information about the City of Shade, see the FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting and Lords of Darkness.

Minions of Evil Deities

erful evil deities of the land. Clergy, spies, and agents ven-

head.  It  affects  only  opponents  with  14  or  fewer  HD  or

Rynnarvyx  is  on  loan  to  Gerti  Orelsdottr  courtesy  of  the

deity Auril. The creature is a resident of the realms of evil,

and  serves  the  Frostmaiden  as  a  loyal  follower.  He  is

charged with protecting Gertis interests and doing her bid-

ding,  and  this  is  what  has  brought  him  into  the  Silver

Marches. He is attached to the parties of frost giants that

are establishing strongholds in the Evermoors, and it is his

task to help drive out the trolls and anyone else who might

stumble  across  these  locations.  Gerti  treats  Rynnarvyx

something  like  a  valued  pet,  and  provided  that  the  Gerti

continues  to  fulfill  Aurils  desires,  Rynnarvyx  sees  no

reason  not  to  enjoy  the  relationship.  During  combat,  he

enjoys pretending to be harmed by the fire-based magic that

enemies  (unaware  of  his  true  nature)  always  use  against

him, and then savoring their shock and horror when they

realize that he isnt nearly as hurt as he pretended to be.

through the land, engaged in all kinds of nefarious schemes

to advance their patrons causes, even in the very heart of

the Silver Marches. Some deities, such as Lolth and Malar,

are served by great numbers of evil creatures; the followers

of these deities are dealt with at great length elsewhere in

this book.

BANE

Given  Sundabars  reliance  on  strength  of

arms  to  preserve  its  existence  and

extend its dominion over the wild

lands,  Bane  has  always  found  a

small  number  of  supporters

within  Sundabar.  With  the  Black

Lords  return,  some  of  these  old

ways  are  returning  to  fashion  in

the  darker  quarters  of  the  city

and its army. The Dreadlord Holt

Burukhan  (LE  male  human

Ftr2/Clr9  of  Bane)  has  already

gathered  a  contingent  of  like-

minded Shieldsar to his dark

banner,  and  he  entertains

schemes  of  destroying

Helms  worship  in  the  city

in order to make room for

the Black Lords veneration.

In  addition  to  the  temple

hidden  within  Sundabar,  Banes

worship  also  grows  within  the

ranks  of  the  newly  arrived  set-

tlers  from  Zhentil  Keep.

Some  of  these  settlers  still

worship  Bane  and  con-

tinue to serve him here in

their  new  home.  For

now,  these  minions  are

but to watch and wait for

further  instructions,  and

they have been promised that support is

on the way.

CYRIC

The Prince of Lies is not welcome in the Silver Marches: His

church  is  outlawed  in  Silverymoon,  and  his  worshipers  are

not  viewed  with  benevolence  elsewhere.  Still,  more  than  a

few lurk in the Silver Marches, mostly in Everlund. There

the citys fiercely competitive commerce breeds lies, deceit,

and the occasional murder, to the delight of the Black Sun.

Gold  has  a  way  of  opening  doors  in  Everlunds  merchant

districts, and a handful of Cyrics followers have established

a secretive cult within the citys commercial heart. Cyrics

priests  dream  of  smashing  the  League  of  the  Silver

Marches  and  returning  the  whole  region  to  a  state  of

chaotic  feuding  and  squabbling.  They  have  already

achieved  their  first  goal  by  secretly  sub-

verting the Keeper of Bridges and gaining

a voice on the citys governing council.

SHAR

There  are  those  in  the  Silver

Marches who venerate Selne.

Therefore, there are also those

in the area who worship Shar.

Of  particular  interest  to  Shar

are  the  machinations  of  the

Arcane  Brotherhood,  and  it  is

likely  that  she  will  soon  in-

struct some of her minions to

make  contact  with  Overwiz-

ard  Valindra  Shadowmantle

in order to offer an alliance

to  the  mages.  The  Silver

Marches, and Silverymoon

in particular, has always en-

joyed Selnes blessingand

so Shar means to bring woe

to  those  who  revere  her

eternal enemy.

TALOS

Few  in  Faern  openly

venerate the Storm Lord,

but the Silver Marches is

one  of  the  places  where

Talosian priests gather in the

name of their destructive god. The

harsh  elements  and  rugged  terrain  of  the  area

demonstrate  the  strength  of  Taloss  hand.  His  thunder-

storms  split  the  summer  skies,  his  winds  scour  the  moun-

tains, his icy blizzards blind and freeze any foolish enough

to venture abroad. None of the major cities of the Marches

embrace  the  Storm  Lords  worship,  but  many  of  the

smaller settlements seek to placate his fury through the in-

tervention  of  Taloss  wandering  priests.  Shevael  Wild-

walker  (CE  female  air  genasi  Clr7  of  Talos)  haunts  the

Cold Vale at the head of a small band of dervishlike follow-

ers, threatening any nonbelievers who pass her way.

Many  unique  characters  range  over  the

wildlands  and  cities  of  the  Silver

Marches.  Giant-killers  seek  out  their

chosen  enemies,  wild  scouts  patrol  the

fringes  of  civilization,  and  hordebreakers  scatter  their

overwhelming  foes  to  the  four  winds.  Many  giant-killers

are,  of  course,  fighters  or  rangers  or  wizards  who  have

earned  their  fame  by  confronting  and  destroying  evil

giantsbut  a  small  number  of  doughty  warriors  make

giant-killing their career.

This chapter presents six prestige classes commonly found

in and around the Silver Marches: the giant-killer, the horde-

breaker, the knight-errant of Silverymoon, the orc scout, the

peerless archer, and the wild scout.

Giant-killer

Giant-killers  are  great  heroes  so  long  as  they  are  killing

giants.  When  they  are  not  out  doing  what  they  do  best,

giant-killers tend to drink a lot and pick fights with people

bigger than themselves. Some kindly giant-killers break the

stereotype,  but  everyone  expects  giant-killers  to  be  rude

and  boastful,  so  many  live  down  to  expectations.  Giant-

killers  are  found  most  frequently  in  regions  where  giants

are common.

Most giant-killers begin their careers as  barbarians, fight-

ers,  or  rangers,  but  clerics  of  certain  deities,  paladins,  and

rogues also choose this path. Not all giants are evil, and not

all giant-killers are good. There are a few sorcerers and wiz-

ards among their number, but hardly any druids.

As  NPCs,  most  giant-killers  prefer  to  operate  alone  or

with a small group of like-minded allies. Many of them have

sworn to avenge some past wrong or foul deed committed by

giants, such as the destruction of their homes or the murder

of  a  member  of  their  family.  Where  giants  gather  in

strength, several giant-killers sometimes pool their resources

in order to more effectively defeat their sworn enemies.

The recent invasion of giants in the Evermoor region,

and  the  subsequent  influx  of  displaced  trolls  into  the

Silver Marches, has resulted in a boom in the giant-killing

business.  Giant-killers  from  around  Faern  have  arrived

in the vicinity to ply their trade, offering their services to

the  highest  bidders.  Giant-killers  charge  whatever  the

market  will  bear,  and  the  more  unscrupulous  of  the  lot

often refuse the first offer from a prospective employer,

hoping  that  the  problem  will  worsen  and  result  in  a

better, more lucrative offer.

A bona fide giant-killer is an expert in his field, and sev-

eral of them have made themselves invaluable on the out-

skirts of the Evermoors and in the town of Nesm. There

are  also  native  giant-killers  among  the  dwarves  of  Citadel

Felbarr  and  Mithral  Hall,  but  while  the  latter  sometimes

make  themselves  available  to  other  communities,  those

living in the former most often serve the interests only of

their  own  home.  Lady  Alustriel  has  recently  appealed  to

King Warcrown on the matter, asking him to consider send-

ing one or two of his kingdoms giant-killers to help scour

the lands around the Silverwood for trolls, before the crea-

tures  become  an  even  worse  problem  for  the  farmsteads

outlying the city of Everlund.

Hit Die: d10.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a giant-killer, a character must fulfill

the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Dodge, Mobility, Toughness.

Skills: Hide 2 ranks, Wilderness Lore 4 ranks.

Special: The character must have already slain at least one

109

Heroes of the North

giant of any type. He need not have accomplished this alone,

but he must have damaged the giant with at least one melee

attack.

CLASS SKILLS

The  giant-killers  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill) are Climb (Str), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Move Silently

(Dex), Tumble (Dex), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chap-

ter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of

the giant-killer prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The

giant-killer is proficient with all simple

and martial weapons, but gains no profi-

ciency in any type of armor or shield.

Smite Big Folk (Su): Giant-killers know

how and where to hit their foes so that

every  blow  counts.  Once  a  day,  a

giant-killer  can  smite  a  foe  of  at

least Large size (provided the foe

is larger than the giant-killer) with

one  melee  attack.  He  adds  his

Wisdom modifier (if positive) to his

attack roll and inflicts 1 extra point

of damage per class level. The giant-

killer can only use this ability a cer-

tain  number  of  times  per  day  as

determined  by  his  level.  Barbarian

giant-killers can use the smite big folk

ability  when  raging.  Bonuses  from  the

smite  big  folk  ability  stack  with  ranger

bonuses for a favored enemy, and can be combined

with  a  smite  ability  conferred  by  another  class

(such as a paladins smite evil ability).

and information concerning his chosen foes. Beginning at

1st  level,  a  giant-killer  adds  this  bonus  to  skill  checks

used in situations that directly concern giants, such as a

Knowledge (local) check to determine where a giants lair

might be located, a Move Silently check to creep past a

sleeping giant, or a Wilderness Lore check when tracking

a giant.

Damage Reduction (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, a giant-

killer  gains  the  extraordinary  ability  to  shrug  off  some

amount  of  injury  from  each  blow  or  attacked.  Subtract

this  number  from  the  damage  the  giant-killer  takes

each time he is dealt damage. Damage reduction

can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

Diehard  (Ex):  At  4th  level,  if  reduced  to

from 1 to 9 hit points, a giant-killer may

remain  conscious  and  take  a  partial  action

each  round.  The  giant-killer  still  loses  1  hit

point each round when at negative hit points

(unless  stabilized),  and  dies  when  he

reaches 10 hit points. If he is stabi-

lized, the giant-killer is disabled.

At  8th  level,  a  giant-killer

may  act  normally  each  round

when  at  from  1  to  9  hit

points,  although  he  still  loses  1

hit  point  per  round  (unless  stabi-

lized) until dead at 10 or lower.

At  10th  level,  instead  of  dying  at

10 hit points or lower, he may make a

Constitution check (DC 10 + 1 per previ-

ous  check)  to  remain  alive  for  another

round.  He  dies  immediately  if  reduced  to

30 hit points or lower.

The giant-killer

Hordebreaker

Improved  Mobility: Sometimes  fighting  a  giant  within

range of the creatures mighty limbs is unavoidable. Fortu-

nately, the giant-killer learns how to make himself harder to

hit when he must be underfoot. This ability works exactly as

the Mobility feat, except that the giant-killers bonus to AC

is +8 instead of +4.

Giant Lore: The giant-killer is a repository of knowledge

Many folk of the Silver Marches harbor a special hatred for

the tribes and hordes of humanoids that constantly threaten

to destroy the civilized way of life in this region. This an-

tipathy is so great for some that it borders on paranoid ob-

session, and these folk sometimes swear enmity against one

or more races of humanoids that gather in large groupses-

pecially  those  that  gather  in  the  mountain  hordes.  In  the

opinion of these fanatics, there is no greater danger facing

the world than the ever-growing humanoid horde menace,

and they believe its up to them to fight it.

The  hordebreaker  is  a  person  who  makes  destroying  the

horde threat her lifes work. She trains long and hard to make

herself the perfect engine of orc destruction. Often such indi-

viduals have suffered personal losses at the hands of hu-

manoid  hordes.  Whatever  the

motivation,  the  horde-

breakers  mission  to  destroy

orcs and other such creatures

is her reason for living.

Most  hordebreakers  are

barbarians,  and  many  of

them  hail  from  those  Uth-

gardt tribes that consider the

orcs  their  traditional  ene-

mies,  particularly  the  Sky

Pony  tribe.  They  sometimes

work with other hordebreak-

ers,  but  they  tend  to  be

loners:  A  life  of  single-

minded  hatred  is  not  well

suited  to  close  companion-

ship.  Some  hordebreakers

attach  themselves  to  adven-

turing  parties  if  such  groups

are  likely  to  encounter  orcs

or  are  engaged  on  a  mission

that  will  undermine  an  orc

hordes plans.

Hit Die: d12.

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a horde-

breaker, a character must ful-

fill the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave.

Skills: Knowledge (local) 5 ranks, Spot 4 ranks.

CLASS SKILLS

The hordebreakers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowl-

edge  (local)  (Int),  Move  Silently  (Dex),  Search  (Int),  Spot

(Wis), Swim (Str), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4:

Skills in the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the hordebreaker prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A hordebreaker gains no

proficiency with any type of weapon or armor.

Horde Enemy: A hordebreaker selects a horde enemy

from  the  following  list  of  creatures:  bugbears,  gnolls,

goblins,  hobgoblins,  kobolds,  or  orcs.  Any  creature

type that the Dungeon Master determines gath-

ers in tribes or hordes in the campaign world is

also  acceptable.  This  ability  works  exactly

like  the  favored  enemy  ability  of  the

ranger  class.  If  a  hordebreaker  with

ranger  levels  chooses  a  horde  enemy

that  she  already  has  as  a  favored

enemy, the bonuses stack.

When  a  hordebreaker  reaches  3rd

level,  the  bonus  against  her  first

horde enemy increases to +2 and she

gains  a  new  horde  enemy  at  +1.

When  a  hordebreaker  reaches  5th

level,  the  bonus  against  her  first

horde  enemy  increases  to  +3,  the

bonus against her second horde

enemy  increases  to  +2,  and

she  gains  a  new  horde

enemy at +1.

Horde  Knowledge: A

hordebreaker  acquires  a

great  deal  of  information

and  knowledge  specific  to

the Silver Marches while in-

teracting  with  the  lands

denizens.  Beginning  at  1st

level,  a  hordebreaker  may

make  a  special  horde

knowledge  check  with  a

bonus  equal  to  her  hordebreaker  level  +  her  Intelligence

modifier to see whether she knows some relevant informa-

tion about local notable humanoid tribes or hordes, such as

their  legendary  places  or  items,  or  regional  politics.  This

check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may

give him a hint as to its general function. A hordebreaker

may not take 10 or 20 on this check. The Dungeon Master

determines the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to

the table below.

Type of Knowledge and Examples

Common, known by at least a substantial minority of

the  local  population.  Example:  King  Obould  Many-

Arrows is gathering an orc horde to crush the lands of

the south.

Uncommon but available, known by only a few people

in  the  area.  Example:  The  rivalry  between  King

Oboulds many sons.

Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. Example: A

secret  route  to  the  army  encampment  of  a  goblin

tribe, or the exact location of the tomb of a great hob-

goblin chieftain.

Extremely  obscure,  known  by  very  few,  possibly

forgotten  by  those  who  once  knew  it,  possibly

known  only  by  those  who  dont  understand  the

significance  of  the  knowledge.  Example:  The

exact  military  strategy  used  by  the  town  of

Deadsnows  to  defeat  the  orc  horde  that

tried to destroy it centuries ago.

Hold the Line: A hordebreaker trains herself

to  withstand  the  charging  might  of  enemies

hurling  themselves  into  battle  with  great

force.  At  2nd  level,  charging  into  an  area

threatened  by  a  hordebreaker  grants  the

hordebreaker  an  attack  of  opportunity.

The  hordebreakers  attack  of  opportunity

happens  immediately,  before  the  charge

attack is resolved.

Tough to Kill (Ex): Every hordebreaker knows

that sooner or later, she is going to get hurt. At

4th  level,  if  reduced  to  1  to  9  hit  points,  a

hordebreaker  may  remain  conscious  and  take  a

partial action each round. The hordebreaker still

loses a hit point each round when at negative hit

points  (unless  stabilized)  and  dies  when  she

reaches 10 hit points. If she is stabilized, the

hordebreaker is disabled.

Anvil of Doom (Ex): Once per day, a

hordebreaker  can  become  a  living

anvil  on  which  her  enemies  break  by

assuming a defensive stance. In this de-

fensive  stance,  the  hordebreaker  gains  ex-

traordinary strength and durability, but she

cannot move from the spot she is defending. She gains the

following benefits:

+2 Strength

+4 Constitution

+2 resistance bonus on all saves

+4 dodge bonus to AC

The increase in Constitution increases the hordebreakers hit

points by 2 per character level, but these hit points go away

at  the  end  of  the  defensive  stance  when  her  Constitution

score  drops  back  down  4  points.  These  extra  hit  points  are

not lost first the way temporary hit points are.

While defending, a hordebreaker cannot use skills or abili-

ties that would require her to shift her position, such as Move

112

Silently  or  Jump.  A  defensive  stance  lasts  for  a  number  of

rounds equal to 3 + the hordebreakers newly improved Con-

stitution modifier. The hordebreaker may end her defensive

stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of her de-

fensive  stance,  the  hordebreaker  is  winded  and  takes  a  2

penalty to Strength for the duration of the encounter. Invok-

ing anvil of doom takes no time itself, but a hordebreaker can

only do so during her action.

The  bonuses  conferred  by  anvil  of  doom  do  not  stack

with similar bonuses, such as the dwarven defenders defen-

sive stance.

Knight-errant of

Silverymoon

Charged with the safety of the city of Silvery-

moon  and  its  citizens,  the  professional  fight-

ing  force  known  as  the  Knights  in  Silver  is

often  all  that  stands  between  Silvery-

moon  and  the  dangers  of  the  frontier.

Consequently,  the  Knights  never  know

what  sort  of  mission  theyll  be  called

upon  to  undertake  next:  Warfare,  re-

connaissance,  disaster  relief,  and

diplomacy  have  all  been  among  the

tasks that the Knights have fulfilled

with  distinction  in  service  to  their

home.  Consequently,  members  of  this

prestige class master a wide variety of ca-

pabilities,  so  that  they  can  be  ready  for

anything when duty calls.

Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

Knight-errants of Silverymoon gain the following class features.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  knight-errant  of  Sil-

verymoon gains no proficiency with any kind of weapon or

armor.

Badge  of  Office: Regardless  of  what  personal  armor,

weapons, and accoutrements he may choose, each knight is

obligated to wear the silver cloak clasp that is his badge of

office. This clasp is shaped to resemble a longsword pierc-

ing a crescent moon. Each badge is also a brooch of resist-

ance  +1.  If  a  knight-errant  loses  his  badge  of  office,  he

must purchase a new one in Silverymoon (cost 1,000 gp) as

soon as possible.

Fighter  Feat: A  knight-errant  of  Silverymoon  gains  a

bonus feat at 2nd, 5th, and 9th level. These bonus feats must

be chosen from the list of bonus feats available to a fighter.

Marches  Knowledge:  A  knight-errant  acquires  a  great

deal  of  information  and  knowledge  specific  to  the  Silver

Marches  while  interacting  with  its  denizens.  Beginning  at

2nd level, a knight may make a special Marches knowledge

check with a bonus equal to his knight-errant level + his In-

telligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant

information about local notable people, legendary places or

items,  or  regional  politics.  This  check  will  not  reveal  the

powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general

function. The knight may not take 10 or 20 on this check.

The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by re-

ferring to the table below.

Type of Knowledge and Examples

Common, known by at least a substantial minority of

the Silver Marches population. Examples: King Har-

bromms hatred of King Obould; common ghost sto-

ries about the ruins of Ghaurin Mansion.

Uncommon but available, known by only a few people

in the area. Example: The rivalry between two schol-

ars at the University of Silverymoon.

20

25

Obscure, known by few, hard to come by. Examples: A

secret route down into the Everfire below Sundabar;

the  genealogy  of  Bruennor  Battlehammers  first

cousin.

Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly for-

gotten  by  those  who  once  knew  it,  possibly  known

only by those who dont understand the significance

of the knowledge. Example: Details about the battle

that gave the town of Deadsnows its name.

Sworn Enemy: At 1st level, a knight-errant declares a spe-

cific group of people or monsters as his sworn enemy. This is

a  much  narrower  category  than  a  rangers  favored  enemy.

Sworn  enemies  include  any  nationality,  group,  tribe,  or  or-

ganization, or type or subtype of creature that is known or

suspected to pose a threat to the Silver Marches. Suitable or-

ganizations  include  the  Arcane  Brotherhood,  the  Daemon-

fey, the People of the Black Blood, or the churches of Bane or

Talos. In general, monsters or creature types must be named

by  both  type  and  locationfor  example,  drow  of  Menzo-

berranzan, duergar of Gracklstugh, frost giants of the Spine

of  the  World,  hobgoblins  of  Doomspire,  orcs  of  the  Heart

Taker tribe, or the orcs of Dark Arrow Keep.

A knight-errant gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense

Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks when using these

skills  against  his  sworn  enemy,  and  a  +1  bonus  on  weapon

damage rolls against these creatures. This damage bonus does

not apply to damage against creatures that are immune to

critical  hits,  and  the  knight  does  not  gain  this  bonus  when

using a ranged weapon against a target that is farther away

than  30  feet.  A  knight  who  is  also  a  ranger  may  choose  a

sworn  enemy  that  is  a  subset  of  his  favored  enemy  (Dark

Arrow orcs, if his favored enemy was orc, for example), in

which case the bonuses stack.

At 7th level, a knight-errant may select a second sworn

enemy, and the bonus for his previous sworn enemy goes up

to +2.

Homeland: At 3rd level, a knight-errant gains a +2 bonus

on Diplomacy, Hide, Intuit Direction, Move Silently, Sense

Motive, and Wilderness Lore checks when within the city of

Silverymoon  or  within  fifty  miles  of  its  walls.  (Knights-

errant traveling in the Underdark or other strange environ-

ments such as underwater do not gain this bonus.)

Heroes of the North

Fast  March  (Ex): A  knight-errant  may  be  ordered  to

march  or  ride  nearly  anywhere  in  the  Silver  Marches  at  a

moments notice. So well does a knight-errant know the lay of

the land in the Silver Marches that at 5th level his overland

speed is 1 1/2 times the normal speed for his base movement

(or his mounts base movement) and

the  terrain  type.  A  knight-errant

can lead a party of additional trav-

elers,  conferring  this  advantage

on  a  number  of  additional  crea-

tures equal to his class level  his

Charisma  modifier  (if  positive),

or  a  minimum  of  one  creature

per knight-errant level.

Faultless  Navigation  (Ex):

At  7th  level,  a  knight-errant

knows the Silver Marches so well

that he gains a +10 bonus on any

Intuit  Direction  checks  in  the

Silver Marches or the lands imme-

diately bordering the league.

Expert  Rider:  A  knight-errant

no  longer  incurs  penalties  for

riding mounts different or very dif-

ferent from the type of mount des-

ignated in his Ride skill.

Loyal Heart (Su): At 10th level,

a  knight-errants  love  of  his  land

and  zeal  in  its  defense  confer  a  +3

morale  bonus  on  all  saving  throws

while  he  is  in  the  city  of  Silvery-

moon  or  within  fifty  miles  of  its

walls.  As  with  the  homeland  ability,

this  benefit  does  not  apply  in  the  Under-

dark or similar strange environments that lie within

fifty miles of the city but are visited by the Knights

in Silver only in the most unusual circumstances.

is visible not in the execution of his missions, but on the bat-

tlefield when the opponent realizes that the orc command-

ers know far more about them than they should.

Part  wilderness  warrior  and  part  spy,  the  orc  scout  is  a

hero to his people. His glory comes not

from  prowess  in  combat,  but

from  risking  his  life  to  bring

his  chieftain  accurate  intelli-

gence about the enemys activ-

ities. He prepares for this role

by training himself to survive

in  inhospitable  climes,  to

make clandestine observations

from  afar,  and  to  return

home  safely  with  his  knowl-

edge intact.

Most orc scouts are barbar-

ians,  fighters,  or  rangers  who

have  chosen  to  be  trained  for

special  missions  on  behalf  of

their tribe. Orc scouts normally

work  alone  or  in  pairs.  Rarely,

they gather in a triad when the

task  at  hand  is  too  demanding

for a solo mission or twin group.

Their  goal  is  to  spy  on  the

enemy  and  get  home  safely  to

tell what they know.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  an  orc

scout,  a  character  must  fulfill

all the following criteria.

The orc scout

Race: Orc, half-orc, or tanarukk.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Skills: Move Silently 6 ranks, Wilderness Lore 4 ranks.

Orc Scout

Slipping down from the wild, barren high country into the

more civilized lands of the south, the scout begins his work.

His task is not to fight the enemy directly, but rather to

gain  valuable  knowledge  about  the  enemys  strengths,

weaknesses,  and  movements.  With  the  scouts  help,  the

enemy will be destroyed, and he will play a valuable role in

that downfall. The scouts contribution to the foes demise

CLASS SKILLS

The orc scouts class skills (and the key ability for each skill)

are: Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Intuit

Direction  (Wis),  Jump  (Str),  Listen  (Wis),  Move  Silently

(Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Use Rope (Dex),

and  Wilderness  Lore  (Wis).  See  Chapter  4:  Skills  in  the

CLASS FEATURES

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  orc  scout  prestige

class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Orc scouts are proficient

in simple and martial weapons and light armor.

Fieldcraft (Ex): At 1st level, an orc scout gains a bonus on

a number of skill checks due to his intensive training in these

capabilities. The orc scout gains a +1 bonus on Climb, Heal,

Hide, Intuit Direction, Listen,

Move  Silently,  Search,  Spot,

and  Wilderness  Lore  checks

whenever  he  is  engaged  in  a

scouting  mission.  The  bonus

increases to +2 at 3rd level and

to +3 at 5th level.

Blend  into  Wilds  (Ex):  At

1st level, an orc scout learns to

blur  his  lines  with  the  aid  of

colored  body  paint,  carefully

chosen  clothing,  and  posture,

making  it  much  difficult  for

others  to  see  him.  This  tech-

nique requires 1 minute to im-

plement  but  grants  the  orc

scout a +10 competence bonus

on  his  Hide  check.  An  orc

scout can use this ability only

when he is in a wilderness area,

and only if he is not under ob-

servation by foes. If he moves

at  all,  he  loses  the  benefit  of

blending  and  must  make  his

Hide  check  normally  (see  the

Hide skill description).

Bonus  Feat: At  2nd  level

and again at 4th level, an orc

scout  gains  a  feat  from  the  following  list:

Blooded,  Forester,  Resist  Poison,  Survivor,

Toughness, Treetopper.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 2nd level, an orc scouts speed

improves to 40 feet, as shown on Table 64. An orc scout

in medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy

load,  loses  this  extra  speed.  At  5th  level,  the  orc  scouts

speed improves to 50 feet. Orc scouts with levels in barbar-

ian add that classs fast movement bonus to their orc scout

base speed.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Often an orc scout must strike an op-

ponent unawares in order to accomplish his mission. At 3rd

level, an orc scout gains the ability to execute a sneak attack

if he can catch an opponent unable to defend himself from

attack, striking a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the

orc scouts opponent would be denied his Dexterity bonus to

Armor Class (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or

not),  the  orc  scouts  attack  deals  +1d6  points  of  extra

damage. Should the orc scout score a critical hit with a sneak

attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision

and  penetration  to  hit  a  vital  spot,  so  ranged  attacks  can

only count as sneak attacks if the target is no farther than

30 feet away.

115

With a sap or an unarmed strike, an orc scout can make

a sneak attack that deals subdual damage instead of normal

damage. He cannot use a weapon that deals normal damage

to deal subdual damage in a sneak attack, not even at the

usual4 penalty, because he must make optimal use of his

weapon in order to execute the sneak attack.

An  orc  scout  can  only  sneak  attack  living  creatures

with  discernible  anatomiesundead,  constructs,  oozes,

plants,  and  incorporeal  creatures

lack vital areas to strike. Addition-

ally, any creature immune to criti-

cal  hits  is  similarly  immune  to

sneak  attacks.  The  orc  scout  must

be  able  to  see  the  target  well

enough to pick out a vital spot and

must be able to reach a vital spot.

An  orc  scout  cannot  sneak  attack

while  striking  at  a  creature  with

concealment  or  by  striking  at  the

limbs  of  a  creature  whose  vitals

are beyond reach.

If  an  orc  scout  gets  a  sneak

attack  bonus  from  another  source

(such  as  rogue  levels),  the  bonuses

to damage stack.

Peerless

Archer

Many  armies  boast  units  of  sol-

diers  who  use  a  bow  as  their  pri-

mary  weapon,  but  most  do  not

possess  the  discipline  to  gain  the

kind of expertise that the peerless

archer  has.  The  peerless  archer  devotes  her

life  to  perfecting  her  skill  with  the  bow.  All

other  concerns  are  secondary.  For  her,  the  perfect

moment in life occurs when the arrow is loosed and every-

thing depends upon the accuracy of her eye, the steadiness

of her hand, and her understanding of her chosen weapon.

For the most skilled archers, life is lived to its fullest in

that moment. Perfection is a bullseye, and everything else

is irrelevant.

Fighters  and  rangers  are  the  most  common  peerless

archers,  but  barbarians  and  paladins  sometimes  choose  to

follow this path of mastery. Monks are drawn to the almost

spiritual  nature  of  the  discipline.  Rogues  and  powerful  sor-

cerers  have  been  known  to  take  up  the  class  from  time  to

time, but it is rare. Druids and wizards are rarely tempted to

abandon  their  other  pursuits  to  devote  themselves  so  com-

pletely to a single weapon.

As NPCs, peerless archers are often mercenaries, hired by

military officers or noble rulers either to augment the field

units  or  undertake  some  special  task,  such  as  picking  off

spellcasters in the opposing armys ranks.

Hit Die: d10.

The peerless archer

620_088567_001_EN_Ch6b.qxd  4/26/02  1:54 PM  Page 116

Heroes of the North

REQUIREMENTS

To qualify to become a peerless archer, a character must ful-

fill the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +7.

Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 10 ranks.

Proficiency:  Longbow,  shortbow,  composite  longbow,  or

composite shortbow.

Feats:  Point  Blank  Shot,  Far  Shot,  Precise  Shot,

Quick Draw.

CLASS SKILLS

The peerless archers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (bowmaking)

(Int),  Hide  (Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Spot  (Wis),  Swim  (Str),  and

Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players

Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

The following are class features of the peerless archer pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A peerless archer gains

no proficiency with any weapon or type of armor.

Expert Bowyer: A peerless archer understands her weapon

on  a  fundamental  level  that  most  trained  soldiers  never

achieve. At 1st level, an archer gains a +3 bonus on all Craft

(bowmaking) skill checks.

Ranged Sneak Attack (Ex): When wearing light armor or

no  armor,  a  peerless  archer  can  draw  and  fire  in  a  split-

second, catching her targets unawares. She loses this special

ability  when  fighting  in  medium  or  heavy  armor.  At  1st

level, a peerless archer gains the ability to execute a ranged

sneak  attack  if  she  catches  an  opponent  unable  to  defend

himself  from  attack.  Any  time  the  peerless  archers  oppo-

nent  would  be  denied  his  Dexterity  bonus  to  Armor  Class

(whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the peer-

less  archers  ranged  attack  deals  +1d6  points  of  extra

damage.  This  extra  damage  increases  to  +2d6  at  4th  level,

+3d6 at 7th level, and +4d6 at 10th level. Should the peer-

less archer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra

damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration

to hit a vital spot, so her ranged attacks can only count as

sneak attacks if the target is no farther than 30 feet away.

A peerless archer can only sneak attack living creatures

with  discernible  anatomiesundead,  constructs,  oozes,

plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to strike.

Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is simi-

larly  immune  to  sneak  attacks.  The  peerless  archer  must

be  able  to  see  the  target  well  enough  to  pick  out  a  vital

spot. The peerless archer cannot sneak attack while strik-

ing at a creature with concealment (unless her sharp shoot-

ing  ability  overcomes  the  concealment;  see  below)  or  by

striking at the limbs of a creature whose vitals are not in

her line of sight.

If the peerless archer gets a sneak attack bonus from an-

other  source  (such  as  rogue  levels),  the  bonuses  to  damage

stack.

Sharp  Shooting  (Ex): A  peerless  archers  skill  with  her

bow allows her to strike accurately at foes, even when they

are attempting to take advantage of cover or concealment.

Beginning  at  2nd  level,  a  peerless  archers  targets  receive

cover or concealment one step worse than they should. For

example, a target with three-quarters cover is treated as if

he had one-half cover. At 5th level, a peerless archer ignores

two steps of cover or concealment, so the same target would

be  treated  as  if  he  had  one-quarter  cover  instead  of  three-

quarters cover. At 9th level, a peerless archer ignores three

steps  of  cover  or  concealment.  This  ability  has  no  effect

against foes with total cover.

Fletching  (Su):  At  2nd  level,  a  peerless  archer  gains  the

ability to create magic arrows (and only arrows) with a +1 en-

hancement bonus, as if she possessed the Craft Magic Arms

and  Armor  feat  and  met  all  other  requirements  for  the

arrow she wishes to make. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th levels,

the bonus of the arrows she can create with this ability in-

creases to +2, +3, +4, and +5, respectively.

Crafting Arrows: Crafting a masterwork arrow requires 5

gp in materials, a workshop of some kind, and two days per

arrow  (this  is  an  approximation  of  average  results  of  the

Craft skill; if you wish to calculate exactly how long it takes,

refer to the Craft skill description).

Enhancing  Arrows:  In  addition  to  the  arrows  to  be

crafted,  a  peerless  archer  must  use  materials  and  spend

XP  to  create  arrows  with  an  enhancement  bonus,  as

shown below.

XP is  the  amount  of  XP  it

costs  to  craft  one  arrow,  or

fifty.

Arrows per Day is the number

of arrows of that value that can

be crafted per day of work.

Power  Shot:  At  3rd  level,  a

peerless  archer  learns  how  to

make  devastatingly  powerful

bowshots.  On  her  action,  before

making any attack rolls, she may

choose  to  subtract  a  number

from all ranged attack rolls and

add  the  same  number  to  all

ranged  damage  rolls.  This

number may not exceed her base

attack bonus. The penalty on her

attack  rolls  and  bonus  on  her

damage  rolls  apply  until  her

next action.

Threaten: At 8th level, a peer-

less  archer  gains  the  ability  to

threaten  nearby  areas  with  her

bow  as  if  she  were  wielding  a

melee  weapon  when  wearing

light  armor  or  no  armor.  She

loses  this  special  ability  when

fighting  in  medium  or  heavy

armor.  Her  bow  functions  as  a

reach weapon, threatening anything

10 feet away but not immediately

adjacent to her. Any attacks of opportunity she receives be-

cause she threatens nearby areas are normal ranged attacks,

Wild Scout

Wild scouts are the spies of the wilderness, traversing the

open and wild country in search of valuable information.

They are a boon to whoever employs them, though their

services are often expensive. Good wild scouts seek out and

report  on  the  movements  of

evil creatures and forces in the

wilderness,  usually  on  behalf

of a noble or community. Evil

wild  scouts  do  the  same  for

their  employers,  but  it  is  the

forces  of  good  that  are  the

target  of  their  clandestine  ob-

servations.

Most wild scouts are barbar-

ians, druids or rangers. Some are

fighters  or  rogues  who  feel

more of an affinity for the wild

places than for urban areas. Sor-

cerers  and  wizards  are  rare

among their number.

As  an  NPC,  a  wild  scout  is

typically  in  the  employ  of  a

general,  noble,  or  community.

Characters  might  encounter

one  acting  as  the  extreme  ad-

vance guard for an approaching

army,  or  discover  that  they

themselves  are  under  a  wild

scouts scrutiny.

Hit Die: d8.

REQUIREMENTS

To  qualify  to  become  a  wild

scout, a character must fulfill the

following criteria.

Heroes of the North

Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Intuit Direction 4 ranks, Knowledge

(nature) 4 ranks, Move Silently 4 ranks.

CLASS SKILLS

The  wild  scouts  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for  each

skill)  are  Animal  Empathy  (Wis),  Climb  (Str),  Handle

Animal  (Cha),  Hide  (Dex),  Intuit  Direction  (Wis),  Jump

(Str), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently

(Dex), Spot (Wis), and Wilderness Lore (Wis). See Chapter

4: Skills in the Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

CLASS FEATURES

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  wild  scout  prestige

class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  wild  scout  is  profi-

cient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and

shields.

Improved  Track  (Ex): A  wild  scout  learns  the  art  of

tracking  creatures  accurately  without  sacrificing  speed.

This  ability  functions  as  the  Track  feat,  except  that  the

wild  scout  does  not  incur  any  penalty  to  movement.  In

other  words,  a  wild  scout  can  move  at  his  normal  speed

while  tracking,  and  does  not  incur  a  penalty  for  moving

more quickly than his base speed while tracking.

Home Turf (Ex): When in an area with which they are

intimately familiar, wild scouts are even more capable. At

1st level, a wild scout designates his home turf, an area no

larger than one hundred square miles (about ten miles by

ten  miles).  While  in  this  area,  the  wild  scout  gains  a  +4

bonus on Animal Empathy, Hide, Intuit Direction, Move

Silently,  and  Wilderness  Lore  checks.  The  wild  scouts

home  turf  expands  to  two  thousand  five  hundred  square

miles  (fifty  miles  by  fifty  miles)  at  4th  level,  and  to  the

entire region (as defined in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Cam-

paign Setting) at 8th level, reflecting the fact that he can

range far and wide in service to his employer.

Wild Feat: At 1st level and again at 10th level, a wild scout

gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Forester,

Resist Poison, Stealthy, Survivor, Toughness, Treetopper.

Fast March (Ex): A wild scout travels over diverse terrain

and makes arduous journeys without benefit of luxuries, and

speed is often of the essence. So well does a wild scout know

the lay of the land within his home turf that at 2nd level his

overland speed is 1 1/2 times his normal base movement (or

his mounts base movement) and the terrain type. The wild

scout can lead a party of additional travelers, conferring this

advantage on a number of additional creatures equal to his

class level  his Charisma modifier (if positive), or a mini-

mum of one creature per wild scout level.

Nondetection  (Sp): Starting  at  2nd  level,  a  wild  scout

learns to tap into the nature of the wilderness itself in order

to help him avoid attempts to divine his presence or actions.

This spell-like ability functions exactly like the spell of the

same name, but only while the wild scout is within his home

turf and not within an urban area.

Camouflage (Ex): A wild scout trains himself to make the

most of his surroundings when he wishes to remain unseen.

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever a wild scout uses natural el-

ements (foliage, trees, boulders, sand dunes, shrubbery, and so

forth) to gain cover or concealment, he increases the bene-

fit of his cover or concealment by one step. For example,

if the wild scout was hidden behind a tree conferring one-

half cover, he would actually gain the Armor Class bonus

and Reflex save bonus for three-quarters cover. If he was

concealed by dense foliage, normally three-quarters conceal-

ment and a 30% miss chance, he would actually gain the ben-

efit of nine-tenths concealment and a 40% miss chance. At

6th level, a wild scout receives the benefit of cover or con-

cealment  two  steps  better  than  his  actual  situation,  and  at

9th level three steps better. (He must have at least one-quar-

ter cover or concealment to receive any benefit, of course.

No cover does not improve to three-quarters cover, not even

for a 9th-level wild scout.)

Commune  with  Nature (Sp): Beginning  at  5th  level,  a

wild scout becomes so keenly attuned to the wilderness that

he can use the clues carried on the air and soil of the land

itself to divine the presence of other places and creatures in

the wild. Once per day, he may use commune with nature at

a caster level equal to his wild scout level. At 7th level, a

wild scout may use commune with nature twice per day, and

at 10th level three times per day.The wild scout may only

invoke this power when he is within his home turf.

Creatures of all types roam the Silver Marches

and  the  Savage  Frontier.  Most  of  the  more

dangerous  or  interesting  ones  are  already  de-

scribed  in  the  Monster  Manual  and the  FORGOTTEN

REALMS Campaign  Setting.  In  addition,  Monster  Com-

pendium:  Monsters  of  Faern  describes  a  number  of  crea-

tures  unique  to  Faern.  This  chapter  presents  a  small

number  of  creatures  prevalent  in,  or  unique  to,  the  Silver

Marches and the surrounding lands.

Deer: Given the number of monstrous and magical preda-

tors roaming the North, deer make up an important part of

the  ecology  of  the  Silver  Marches.  Female  deer  are  also

known  as  does  or  hinds,  while  male  deer  are  often  called

harts  or  stags.  Deer  flee  most  encounters,  and  fight  only

when trapped or in rut.

Skills: Deer receive a +2 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Elk: The largest members of the deer family, elk are also

favored by predators in the North. Elk flee most encoun-

ters,  but  may  turn  on  predators  or  hunters  smaller

than themselves.

Skills: Elk receive a +2 racial bonus

on Hide checks.

Red  Tiger:  A  variety

of  tiger  common  in

the  North,  the  red

tiger is also known

as  the  snow  cat.

The  animals

coat  changes

with  the  sea-

sons:  rust-red

in

autumn,

dappled  white

in  winter,  and

golden  brown  in  spring

and summer. The animal is somewhat

hardier and more aggressive than tigers common in

other lands.

Pounce (Ex): If a red tiger leaps upon an opponent during

the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it

has already taken a move action.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  the  red  tiger

must hit with a claw or bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can

rake.

Rake (Ex): A tiger that gets a hold can make two rake at-

tacks (+11 melee) with its hind legs for 1d8+3 damage each.

If the tiger pounces on an opponent, it can also rake.

Skills:  Red  tigers  receive  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Balance,

Hide, and Move Silently checks.

In  fall  or  winter,  the  Hide  bonus  improves  by  an

additional +4.

Challenge Rating: 2

Alignment: Always neutral

Advancement: 

Brantas are fleet-footed herbivores preyed

upon  by  many  northern  creatures.  Sure-

footed and sturdy, they bolt when they sense

danger.

Brantas have long necks

for browsing on high pine

boughs.  They  otherwise

resemble horses, except

for  their  thick,  pow-

erful legs, which seem

to  end  in  clublike

feet.  Large  folds  of

skin  around  the  a

brantas  hooves  increase

traction for walking on ice,

or  spread  out  its  weight  when  it

traverses deep snow. The top of a brantas head is a

massive ridge of bone, ending in two parallel nose-

horns. Its neck and shoulders are corded with muscle. Bran-

tas  are  strong  enough  to  uproot  and  knock  over  small

trees, and both gore and toss foes.

No one has succeeded in domesticating brantas, but both

orcs and dragons have walled in branta herds by blocking

off  mountain  valleys  to  trap  them.  Branta  flesh  is  tight,

light-hued,  nourishing  meat.  Found  wandering  in  all  but

the rockiest or most dense forest terrain, brantas prefer to

munch  on  high  vegetation,  where  their  raised  heads  can

survey their surroundings.

Combat

At any sign of approaching peril brantas spring into flight,

but if they see no clear route of escape, they rear, skid into a

tight turn, and lower their heads to charge.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  the  branta

must hit with a butt attack. If it gets a hold, it tosses its

opponent.

Toss  (Ex): Brantas  vigorously  shake  any  creature

caught  in  their  horns  and  fling  them  in  random  direc-

tions.  Resolve  the  toss  as  a  bull  rush  maneuver,  except

that  there  is  no  attack  of  opportunity,  since  the  branta

has  already  grabbed  its  foe  when  it  tries  to  toss  the

victim. The branta does not need to move with its foe in

order  to  throw  its  foe  more  than  5  feet.  If  the  tossed

victim  beats  the  brantas  Strength  check,  he  remains  in

his current square with no ill effects and is not grappled

any longer. Tossed victims take impact damage on landing

620_088567_001_EN_Ch7a.qxd  4/26/02  1:58 PM  Page 121

Monsters of the Marches

as if they had fallen a distance equal to the distance they

were tossed.

Cold  Subtype: Immune  to  cold  damage;  takes  double

damage from fire unless a saving throw for half damage is

allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and

double damage on a failure.

Surefooted (Ex): Brantas receive a +4 racial bonus on

Balance  checks  when  walking  on  ice  or  snow.  Brantas

ignore  all  movement  penalties  associated  with  snow  on

the ground.

Giant  ravens  are  intelligent,

mischievous  scavengers  that

d w e l l   a m o n g   t h e   h i g h

places of the North. The

creature  is  the  name-

sake of the Black Raven

tribe  of  the  Uthgardt

barbarians,  who  raise

the birds from the time

they  are  hatchlings  to

b e c o m e   u s e f u l   a e r i a l

steeds.  The  giant  raven  is  a

willful  and  mischievous  bird,

prone  to  crude  practical  jokes  (such  as

stealing its riders helmet

or weapon and hiding someplace where

the rider cant reach it).

Giant ravens born and living in the wild rarely attack other

creatures unless they feel threatened or they perceive that

their nests, young, or eggs are endangered. Young ravens can

be trained as aerial mounts, though they are less prized than

giant eagles, giant owls, or pegasi.

Combat

When  fighting  without  a  rider,  a  giant  raven  prefers  to

harry its enemy by swooping close to strike and then quickly

retreating, rather than enter a stand-up fight. The bird is ca-

pable  of  diving  onto  targets  from  a  great  height,  using  its

sharp  beak  and  daggerlike  talons  to  slash  at  an  opponents

face. A mated pair attacks in concert, fighting to the death

to  defend  their  nest,  young,  or  eggs.  Several  giant  ravens

sometimes  band  together  to  defend  their  nesting  grounds

against predators or egg raiders.

Evasion  (Ex):  If  exposed  to  any  effect  that  normally

allows a Reflex save for half damage, a giant raven takes no

damage with a successful saving throw.

Skills:  *Giant  ravens  receive  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Spot

checks during daylight hours.

Training a Giant Raven

Training a giant raven as an aerial mount requires

a  successful  Handle  Animal  check

(DC 23 for a young creature,

DC 28 for an adult) and that

the creature be willing. Mem-

bers of the Black Raven tribe

gain a +4 circumstance bonus

on  these  checks  due  to  their  close

affiliation with the birds.

Giant  raven  eggs  are  worth

1,500  gp  apiece  on  the  open

market,  while  hatchlings  are

worth  3,000  gp  each.  Profes-

sional  trainers  charge  1,000  gp

to  rear  or  train  a  giant  raven,

and  riding  one  requires  an

exotic  saddle.  A  giant  raven

can  fight  while  carrying  a

rider, but the rider cannot

also  attack  unless  he  suc-

ceeds  at  a  Ride  check

against  DC  10  (see  the

Ride  skill  description  in

Chapter  4  of  the  Players

Giant Raven

Handbook).

Carrying  Capacity:  A  light

load  for  a  giant  raven  is  up  to  150

pounds; a medium load, 151300 pounds; and a

heavy  load,  301450  pounds.  A  giant  raven

cannot fly with a heavy load.

wyverns,  but  they  tend  to  be

sly  and  cunning  ambushers

rather  than  wide-ranging

hunters. Since rock wyrms are

careful to slay and devour iso-

lated  victims  while  avoiding

groups of creatures, their kills

are  often  blamed  on  other

predators  or  brigands.  Some-

times  called  false  dragons,

rock  wyrms  have  rough  hides

of  mottled  gray  and  brown

scales, smallish wings that are

more suited for fighting than

flying,  and  blunt  faces  with

powerful  jaws  and  a  large

third  eye  in  the  middle  of  their  foreheads.  Rock  wyrm

foreclaws  are  nimble  enough  to  serve  as  hands  for  most

purposes, and their tails are long and powerful.

There are even rumors that these hunters work together,

skulking and spying, so as to better avoid armed bands and

guards and strike at unprotected and isolated targets.

Rock wyrms stash treasure (coins, gems, tools, and other

items taken from prey they deem useful for later trade or

personal  ransom)  in  rock  clefts  or  hollows  that  they  can

conceal  and  guard  with  clever  traps,  but  have  no  single,

true lair. They sleep in the same fashion that they hunt

lying  motionless  covered  by  their  wings,  with  their  scaly

hides  matching  their  surroundings  (usually  gray  rocks  or

white snow) in hue.

Rock wyrms speak Common and Draconic, and also master

small  working  vocabularies  in  many  other  languagesde-

pending on what prey they come into contact with.

Combat

Rock wyrms can spring into a pounce, take flight silently,

or emit their paralyzing ray, all from a statuelike state that

they can maintain for hours. Rock wyrms usually lurk near

trails or stalk prey deliberately,

awaiting  a  chance  to  pounce.

They  often  construct  traps  in

traveled areas and then strike at

captured  or  wounded  victims.

These  intelligent  hunters  can

mimic  a  wide  range  of  voices

and  can  recall  overheard

phrases  perfectly,  to  lure  prey

into their traps or reach.

Rock  wyrms  often  construct

traps (or lurk near traps created

by  others)  to  take  advantage  of

disabled  prey.  These  are  usually

simple or spiked 20-foot-deep pit

traps, concealed by woven brush.

Rock wyrms are also bright and

dexterous  enough  to  use  many

types of magic items. They espe-

cially  like  wands  with  spells  of

protection or concealment.

Paralyzing  Ray  (Su):  A  rock

wyrms third eye can emit a par-

alyzing  ray  once  every  1d4

rounds.  The  ray  has  a  range  of

75  feet.  The  rock  wyrm  must

succeed at a ranged touch attack

(+10  attack  bonus)  against  its

target. Targets struck by the ray

must make a Fortitude save (DC

17)  or  be  paralyzed  for  1d6+2

minutes.

Pounce (Ex): If a rock wyrm leaps upon a foe during the

first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it

has already taken a move action.

Rock wyrm

Rock wyrms are found in cold, mountainous areas across

Faern.  As  settlers  in  the  Silver  Marches  push  into  the

wilderness,  and  steadings  rise  in  many  long-uninhabited

places,  rock  wyrms  are  becoming  an  increasing  problem.

Fast Healing (Ex): A rock wyrm heals 1 point of damage

each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Mimicry  (Ex): Rock  wyrms  can  mimic  most  speaking

voices  perfectly,  plus  other  vocal  sounds  ranging  from

coughing and retching to high bird-trills or deep, thunderous

croakings.  They  can  remember  and  perfectly  reproduce

phrases  they  have  overheard,  and  they  have  a  knack  for

echoing vocal mannerisms and catchphrases.

Skills:  Rock  wyrms  can  change  the  reflectiveness,  color,

and apparent texture of their hides, allowing them to blend

into  their  surroundings  like  chameleons.  They  gain  a  +4

racial bonus on Hide checks. *In rocky areas, this bonus on

Hide checks improves to +8.

A rock wyrms mimicry ability confers a +4 racial bonus

on Bluff checks involving attempts to deceive foes by mim-

icking a particular voice or animal call.

Sometimes  called  snow  ghosts  because  of  their  ability  to

drift silently along in snowstorms to attack prey, snowcloaks

are flying predators of the Spine of the World that resemble

flying  rays  or  skates.  The  bane  of  prospectors  and  hunters

(who  dislike  becoming  the  hunted),  they  are  prized  by  al-

chemists as a source of poison.

Snowcloaks are slate gray on one side and creamy white

on the other; they habitually fly dark side down, flapping

their wings gently and gliding for long distances. A snow-

cloak has two long, sinuous necks ending in dark gray heads

studded with rows of silver-hued eyes. Each head has a long,

pointed jaw filled with rows of needle-sharp teeth.

Snowcloaks  are  wandering  predators  that  lack  lairs.

They  are  usually  encountered  lying  concealed  on  snow-

covered  slopes,  or  flying  low  along  the  ground  in  snow-

storms, seeking prey.

Combat

Snowcloaks  are  cunning,  patient  hunters,  often  drifting

along  after  dark  to  pounce  on  nocturnal  creatures  as  they

123

emerge  from  lairs  and

burrows.

Snowcloak

Snowcloaks  attack  by

landing  atop  prey  and  biting  it

or  clubbing  it  with  the  fearsome

bone  knobs  on  their  tails.  Snow-

cloaks often fly away from formidable foes

who have harmed them, avoiding dangerous prey. If

they  believe  a  foe  can  be  overcome,  snowcloaks  favor  an

extended  hit-and-run  battle,  slashing  quickly  among  their

enemies with flyby attacks and then moving off and using

their  regeneration  to  recover,  while  their  intended  prey

grows weaker and runs out of magic, missile weapons, and

will to resist.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willobscuring mist, blur; 3/day

invisibility,  magic  missile;  1/dayhypnotic  pattern.  These

abilities are as the spells cast by a 4th-level caster. In ad-

dition, a snowcloak can use dimension door twice per day

as an 8th-level caster.

Cold  Subtype: Immune  to  cold  damage;  takes  double

damage from fire unless a saving throw for half damage is

allowed, in which case it takes half damage on a success and

double damage on a failure.

Regeneration  (Ex): Snowcloaks  regenerate  2  points  of

damage  per  round.  Fire  and  acid  deal  normal  damage  to  a

snowcloak.

Poison (Ex): Wing claws, Fortitude save (DC 15); initial

damage 1d4 temporary Dexterity, secondary damage paraly-

sis. The duration of the paralysis induced by the snowcloaks

venom is 1d4 hours.

Immunities (Ex): Snowcloaks possess a bizarre physiol-

ogy. Among other features, a snowcloaks brain is distrib-

uted  in  nodes  throughout  its  winglike  body.  Snowcloaks

are not subject to critical hits and are immune to poison

and disease.

Skills:  *Due  to  their  coloration,  snowcloaks  gain  a  +4

racial bonus on Hide checks in snowy or icy conditions.

Here,  the  lycanthropes  tend  their  sick  and  wounded,  and

here they retreat when the Knights in Silver or other forces

for good seek to scour them from their forest.

If  faced  with  overwhelming  force,  the  People  abandon

any wounded and melt away in beast shape into the forest to

run  and  fight,  seeking  to  ambush  intruders  using  their

knowledge of the Moonwood and its natural cover.

The People of Claw Hollow

The residents of Claw Hollow include these individuals.

Bloodmaster Jarthon (NE male werebadger Rgr5)

Kuldus Droum (CE male werebear Clr6 of Malar)

Sarissa Duncastle (CE female wererat Rog4)

6 werewolf berserkers (CE Bbn3)

39 werewolves (CE Com1)

22 wereboars (CE Com1)

At any given time, roughly half of the tribe is away from

the stockade, hunting the Moonwood and surrounding lands

or simply lairing someplace else for a time. For a quick as-

sault, assume that the Bloodmaster, Sarissa, four berserkers,

twenty werewolves, and ten wereboars are present, occupying

the posts and rooms indicated in the following descriptions.

If the heroes raid Claw Hollow, leave, and return later, some

number of losses will have been offset by the return of hunt-

ing  parties.  Should  the  Bloodmaster  be  killed,  Kuldus

Droumout  hunting  in  the  Cold  Vale  during  the  heroes

first raidreturns and assumes the title of Bloodmaster.

Tactics: In human form, the lycanthropes fight wearing

little  more  than  tattered  clothing.  They  wield  light  cross-

bows,  javelins,  and  daggers,  all  recently  taken  from  a

weapons caravan. They also employ morningstars, a variety

of  weapons  from  victims,  and  throwing  nets.  Some  prefer

the claw bracer, Malars favored weapon.

All People armed with crossbows have 1d42 doses of amau-

nauth (DC 19, initial damage 2d4 hp, secondary damage uncon-

sciousness) on their person and poison their bolts accordingly. See

Flora in Chapter 2 of this book for full details on this poison.

Adventure  opportunities  abound  in  and  around

the  Silver  Marches.  For  some  unfortunate

travelers,  simply  finding  their  way  from  one

town  to  another  across  the  North,  in  the  face  of  hostile

weather and hungry monsters, may constitute a deadly dan-

gerous adventure all by itself. While the cities are home to

some  amount  of  intrigue,  murder,  and  espionage,  for  the

most  part  adventures  in  the  North  focus  on  the  vast,  un-

tamed wilderness and the ancient secrets of ruins, tombs, and

dungeons hidden beneath its endless green cloak.

This  chapter  details  three  short  adventure  sites  and  a

longer campaign adventure. Black Fury describes the were-

creature hold of Claw Hollow, a stronghold of the People of

the Black Blood in the northern reaches of the Moonwood.

Dead Orc Pass describes a small portion of the famous orc-

infested  trail  through  the  Rauvin  Mountains.  Telkouns

Tower details an evil sorcerers hold and the perilous valley

surrounding  his  abode.  Finally,  Blood  and  Gold is  a  cam-

paign adventure based in the town of Deadsnows. It consists

of several short adventure sites linked together by common

story threads, all tied to Deadsnows ongoing gold strike.

Black Fury

The daily haunts of the Moonwood Black Blood tribe consist

of several altars to Malar and a dozen hides (shelters and

lookout  posts  concealed  by  shrubs,  vines,  and  plants)  scat-

tered  across  the  northern  half  of  the  forest.  Deep  in  the

Moonwood is their refuge and rallying place, Claw Hollow.

Adventures in the North

The Stockade

The Peoples stronghold consists of a surface stockade built

in a double ring around a rocky lookout crag and a chain of

underground caverns.

The People defend Claw Hollow with crossbows firing poi-

soned bolts, javelins, and slung stones from the concealment

of the tangled vegetation atop the stockade. If attackers try

to mount the stockade to fight the People, the Malarites take

beast shape to do battle, and then seek to lure the intruders

into a fall into the moat.

to a scum-covered moat. The moat is about 25 feet wide and

about 15 feet deep in the center. Beneath the dark, still sur-

face of the water, the undead form of some misshapen giant

roams this enclosure. The zombie was animated years ago by

a now-dead mage elsewhere in the Moonwood as a passage-

guardian. It was discovered and lured into the moat by the

Malarites,  and  it  now  regards  the  moat  as  the  passage  it

must guard. It only attacks creatures that enter the moats

waters.

Gargantuan Zombie: hp 133.

1. STOCKADE

RINGS (EL 7)

These  old,  solidly  built

walls  of  blunt-topped

wooden  tree  trunks  have

been  reinforced  over  the

years  with  earth,  thorny

vines,  and  shrubs.  This

thick,  tangled  living  cam-

ouflage has made the rings

nearly

impenetrable,

though  the  People  know

where boughs can be read-

ily climbed and small areas

atop  the  walls  have  been

hollowed  out  to  allow  de-

fenders to crouch in hiding.

There  are  two  ring-walls,

resembling tangled hedges

and  banks  on  their  out-

sides.  On  the  sides  where

they face each other, both

walls fall sheer into a 30-

foot-wide,  swampy  moat

that lies between them.

3. PAVILION (EL 8)

This large, ramshackle build-

ing is no more than a sloping

roof  overgrown  with  moss

and  creepers  atop  stout  log

pillars.  If  battle  reaches  the

stockade  yard,  Black  Bloods

lie  or  crouch  on  the  roof,

awaiting chances to spring or

fire down on intruders below.

In  more  peaceful  times,

the  People  gather  to  work,

dine,  and  converse  at  the

pavilion.  It  gives  shelter  to

six  rough  log  trestle  tables,

each with two benches, and a

mound of firewood for the ad-

jacent  cook-pit.  On  one  table

are  seven  skinning  knives,  a

dozen wooden pegs, and three

mallets for staking out hides.

On  another  sit  two  small

carry-cages for small animals,

stolen on a long-ago raid on

a caravan.

Some  of  the  Malarites

can leap this moat in beast

form.  Others  cross  railless

bridges  (single  tree  trunks

with cross-planks nailed to

them) that are temporarily swung into place by fellow lycan-

thropes  on  the  innermost  ring,  and  dropped  into  grooves  on

either bank that prevent them from rolling under hurrying feet.

At any given time, two werewolves lie under cover in var-

ious hides around the perimeter of the outer stockade to keep

an eye out for trouble. Two wereboars stay under cover by

the main gate (a narrow gap between palisade logs, near the

western log bridge), watching for any direct attacks.

If the stockade sentries raise the alarm, Black Bloods near

the pavilion quickly drop whatever theyre doing and rally to

repel the attack.

Werewolves (2): hp 13 each.

Wereboars (2): hp 22 each.

2. MOAT (EL 6)

Between  the  stockade  walls,  two  narrow  strips  of  dank,

muddy ground by the foot of each palisade quickly give way

Nearby under the pavilion

roof  stand  two  wooden

curing frames for stretching

hides.  Sheltering  under  one

end  of  the  pavilion,  atop  a

row  of  wooden  boughs  to

keep it off the ground, is a large metal cage for transporting

captives  or  very  large  monsters.  It  has  a  fist-sized  padlock

and  chains,  and  two  long  wooden  trunks  for  use  as  carry-

poles. Dozens of snares, snapclaw traps, ropes, and throwing

nets are stored nearby.

At any given time, four werewolves, two wereboars, and a

werewolf  berserker  are  engaged  in  work  here.  They  attack

any intruders on sight, and they come running if the stock-

ade sentries call for help.

Werewolves (4): hp 13 each.

Wereboars (2): hp 22 each.

Werewolf Berserker: hp 28.

4. CLAW CRAG AND SPRING

Claw Crag is a rough pyramid of bare rock jutting skyward

in the center of the grassy stockade yard. Its tall enough for

someone on its summit to see over the stockade rings. High

125

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 126

Adventures in the North

on its southern side, cold, clear, drinkable water gushes from

a dozen small fissures. The water flows down the crag, into a

small  rock  pool,  and  then  runs  southeast  out  under  the

stockade rings via a pair of culverts. The culverts sport thick

forests of sharpened, fire-hardened stakes to dissuade intrud-

ers from wading in through themand the waters rushing

through are swift and cold.

Behind  the  cascade  is  a  hidden  cleft  in  the  crag.  The

narrow crawlway leads to a series of natural descending lime-

stone caverns enlarged and inhabited by the People. About 5

feet across, it rises, narrows, and then descends, running 60

feet north before widening into the guard cavern.

5. GUARD CAVERN

(EL 7)

Three  werewolves  are

always stationed here, shel-

tering  in  the  cover  af-

forded  by  two  walls  of

boulders.  They  have  two

cocked  and  loaded  cross-

bows each, and they fire at

any  creature  they  see  who

neglects to give the proper

growl,  before  roaring  an

alarm  and  snatching  up

javelins  from  the  walls.

The  berserker  blocks  the

narrow  opening  between

the boulder-walls while the

others  stand  back  and  fire

missiles at the intruders, or

go for help.

6. FALSE WAY (EL 6)

This tunnel narrows to a natural dead-end, but the lycan-

thropes have made it into a trap for intruders. They often

rub against its walls to leave hair and scent, but never go

in quite far enough to trigger a trap. The tunnel has two

rockfall traps, ceiling cavities filled with rocks kept up by

mud-smeared wooden doors that fall open when the trap

is  triggered,  spilling  their  loads  of  rocks  onto  the  crea-

tures below.

The first trigger is a 4-foot-tall log gate across the tunnel

that  bears  a  sign  (in  Common)  reading  Give  the  signal.

Three  rusty  iron  bells  hang  from  brackets  beside  the  sign,

126

and theres a little wooden shelf with a hand-sized rock on it,

obviously  intended  as  a  striker.  Anything  more  than  the

most gentle of contact with any part of the gate, its posts, or

the bells causes the gate assembly to fall back into the tunnel

beyond,  tugging  open  (by  means  of  a  rope  strung  along  a

cleft in the wall) the trapdoor overhead.

Rockfall Trap: CR 6; +15 melee (11d4) [strikes all charac-

ters in two adjacent squares]; Search (DC 20); Disable Device

(DC 25).

16

The second trap is identical with the first, except that its

trigger is a cats-cradle web of dust-covered ropes, crisscrossing

from anchor bolt to anchor bolt across the tunnel from floor

to  ceilingrather  than  a

gate.  Any  disturbance  of

the  ropes  will  trigger  the

rockfall.  Once  triggered,

these  traps  are  harmless

until the People laboriously

prop up the doors, scale the

tunnel  walls,  and  load  the

fallen  rocks  back  into  the

cavities (a process requiring

several hours).

7. PASSAGE WITH

ELBOW

This  natural,  rough-walled

passage leads to the Peoples

lair, but along the way has a

sharp  bend.  Normally  this

area  is  deserted,  but  if  the

People are warned of a seri-

ous  attack,  the  denizens  of

the  first  sleeping  cavern

(area  12)  muster  here

behind  the  elbow.  They

strike  at  foes  with  ranged

weapons  and  can  also  re-

lease  two  traps  onto  the

heads of intruders by releas-

ing tie-ropes secured behind

the elbow.

The trap consists of two

nets, one hung beneath the other. The lower net is a simple

net trap designed to entangle intruders; the upper net holds a

nasty  rockfall.  Once  the  lower  net  entangles  intruders,  the

contents of the second trap can be dumped on themor onto

other characters trying to free their entangled comrades! The

People wont hesitate to fire crossbow volleys into netted foes.

First  Net: CR  1;  +5  ranged  touch  (characters  in  10-ft.

ters in two adjacent squares]; Search (DC 20); Disable Device

8. GREAT CAVERN (EL 9)

This  large  living  and  working  space  leads  to  storage  and

sleeping caverns. It contains any recent booty the People are

Adventures in the North

examining,  and  sports  a  40-foot  by  80-foot  rotting  carpet

and  stone  throne  salvaged  from  a  ruin.  A  faint  cesspool

smell clings to the carpet, which shows many tears and holes.

This is another trap. The carpet covers a deep shaft that

falls 80 feet to a cavern below (area 9), where the People

dump  their  refuse.  They  turn  back  a  torn  part  of  the

carpet to expose the shaft when they want to dump refuse;

anyone  walking  across  the  hidden  shaft  will  fall  right

through the carpet.

Pit  Trap  (80  feet  deep): CR  4;  no  attack  roll  necessary

(6d6 damage plus 2d6 subdual damage); Reflex save (DC 20)

avoids; Search (DC 0); Disable Device (DC 0). Any character

who decides to search the rug before setting foot on it easily

detects the trap.

Creatures: While this cavern is often empty for hours at a

time, it is also heavily trafficked. For every

10 minutes that previously undetected in-

truders  remain  in  this  area,  there  is  a

30% chance that 1d3 werewolves and

1d31  wereboars  pass  through  on

their way to or from the sleeping

caverns (areas 1214).

During a quick assault (or if the

heroes have battled their way into

the caverns), you can assume that

Bloodmaster  Jarthon,  Sarissa

Duncastle,  a  werewolf  berserker,

and  two  werewolves  hold  this

chamber  against  attackers.  The

People  fight  furiously  here  and

make  full  use  of  the  trap,  trying

to bull rush or lure opponents into

a fatal fall. Note that the People

are  not  cornered  here  and  may

choose to flee in order to fight an-

other day.

Treasure: The  Bloodmaster

chooses to let his followers divide

partment (Search DC 20) under the

throne conceals Jarthons own stash:

a purse containing 220 gp, 90 pp, two gems worth 100 gp

each, a gold comb with rubies worth 400 gp; and two potions

of cure moderate wounds.

9. OTYUGH CAVERN (EL 4)

At the bottom of the shaft is a large, offal- and dung-heaped

natural  cavern  where  a  trapped  otyugh  lairs,  serving  the

People as carrion and waste disposal. They captured the otyugh

and forced it down the shaft years ago. Crippled in the fall, it

cant escape, is always hungry, and attacks any living creature

in this area aggressively. Theres no treasure here; the People

are quite careful about what they consign to the Devourer.

Otyugh: 33 hp.

10, 11. STORAGE CAVERNS

These  natural  cavities  contain  any  large,  useful-for-trade

booty  the  People  have  accumulated,  such  as  locks,  hinges,

bolts, saws, axes, wagon wheels, harness, and armor.

12, 13, 14. SLEEPING CAVERNS (EL 810)

These caves hold various cots and improvised beds (old cart

floors and the like), interspersed with sleeping nests made

of large piles of fragrant pine boughs covered with clumps

of moss.

Creatures: All of the Black Blood tribesfolk have pallets or

nests  in  these  three  rooms.  Only  about  a  third  of  each

caverns residents are present at any given time, since many

are  away  from  the  stockade,  standing  guard,  or  tending  to

routine tasks in the stockade yard.

Area  12  is  currently  occupied  by  two  wereboars,  three

werewolves, and one werewolf berserker.

Area 13 is occupied by two wereboars, three werewolves,

and Sarissa (if she is not encountered in area 8).

Area 14 is occupied by two wereboars,

four  werewolves,  and  Bloodmaster

Jarthon (if he is not encountered

in area 8).

Treasure: Each cavern contains

1d4  personal  hoardssmall,

valuable treasures such as keys,

jewelry, gems, or handfuls of

coins. Each of these personal

hoards  constitutes  a  1st-level

treasure;  refer  to  Table  74  in

the  DUNGEON MASTERs  Guide.

The  hoards  tend  to  be  well  hidden  on

high ledges or stashed in crevices in the

cavern  walls  (Search  DC  15).  Many

among  the  lycanthropes  have  their

own  small  caches,  most  in  the

form  of  purses  or  belt-pouches

taken from victims.

15, 16, AND 17. BACK

WAYS OUT

These  damp,  muddy  crawl-tun-

nels  have  been  laboriously  dug

and hewn out of rock by the People,

over long years of effort. They lead out

under  the  stockade  and  the  taproots  of

trees  for  as  much  as  a  quarter  of  a  mile  to

reach exits blocked by moss and dirt-covered boulders. These

are  for  emergency  use  only;  prybars  have  been  left  ready

inside each exit to shift the rocks. The tunnel exits are well

hidden from the outside (Search DC 25).

Bloodmaster Jarthon Drael

A clear-thinking, ruthless leader who reacts quickly to chang-

ing  situations  and  relishes  victory  by  stealth  and  wits  as

much as through battle, Jarthon is the leader of Moonwood

tribe.  His  animal  form  is  a  fast,  powerful  dire  badger.

Jarthon dislikes assuming badger form because in that form

he is prone to fly into a rage if injured, and he is too smart to

A  hulking,  silent  mountain  of  a  man,  Kuldus  Droum  was

born a werebear. He rarely speaks except to make clear the

when  it  seems  absolutely  necessary.  While  he  is  physically

strong  enough  to  challenge  Jarthon  and  probably  prevail,

Kuldus  recognizes  that  Jarthon  is  a  better  leader  than  he

Dead Orc Pass

Dead Orc Pass is one of the very few routes by which travel-

ers  can  hope  to  cross  the  storm-lashed,  icy  Rauvin  Moun-

tains. The pass is the most direct route from Citadel Felbarr

to Citadel Adbar, and its also open year-roundthe geother-

mal heat of Rainbow Gorge keeps the pass generally free of

snow. Rainbow Gorge and Dead Orc Pass comprise a low pass

through the Rauvin Mountains.

Many  civilized  folk  believe  that  this  infamous  locale  is

nothing less than a veritable city of orcs packed in shoulder

to shoulder, ready to burst forth at a moments noticebut

this is something of a misconception. Local guides, trappers,

prospectors,  and  Uthgardt  tribes  know  the  truth  of  the

matter. The Tornskull orcs claim the pass as their territory

and often harry parties in the area, but the Tornskulls home

caverns lie under peaks miles from Dead Orc Pass, and they

dont keep a constant watch on the trail.

The high saddle of the pass is desolate and windswept, a

place where even orcs dont like to linger unless theyve come

to  propitiate  Gruumsh  at  the  Fang  of  Skulls  or  to  wait  in

hopes of ambushing wayfarers using their road. Dead Orc

Pass is a little more than an outpost for the Rauvin Moun-

tain orcs, and one that frequently stands empty, especially in

the coldest depths of winter and the occasional long, bright

days of midsummer.

In recent months, the Tornskull orcs have established a

permanent  garrison  of  one  claw  (eight  talons  of  ten  orcs

apiece,  plus  a  handful  of  messengers  and  elite  leaders)  to

harry or drive off anyone trying to use the pass. A small

but well-armed party traveling quickly can sometimes slip

through without much trouble, but larger and slower par-

ties  are  likely  to  be  met  with  steadily  growing  resistance,

culminating  in  waves  of  furious  pursuit  following  down

from the saddle of the pass. War-leader Koront hopes that

by closing the pass completely he can goad the forces of the

Silver  Marches  into  a  rash  expedition  into  the  Rauvin

Mountains to reopen the trail.

Adventurers, explorers, and small fighting bands ventur-

ing into Dead Orc Pass find it defended as described below.

The  standpiles  and  rockheights  are  typical  of  orc-works

across the North. The only orcs known to be as organized in

battle as the Tornskulls are those in King Oboulds army in

Dark Arrow Keep.

Adventures in the North

The Claw of Vaug

Eighty  orc  warriors  now  hold  Dead  Orc  Pass,  along  with

their leaders and a handful of scouts and messengers. This

claw is under the command of Vaug the Strong (NE male

orc Rgr2/Ftr4), a fierce fellow who adheres to War-leader

Koronts party. As is the custom among the Tornskulls, the

claw is known by the name of its leader, so this is the Claw

of Vaug.

ORCS OF NOTE

Vaugs  lieutenant  and  chief  scout  is  a  wily  female  named

Anya (CE female half-orc Rog2/Ftr2). Few orc females win

the  chance  to  fight  alongside  the  males,  but  Anya  is  a  fa-

vorite of Baerzel, and she has killed more than one warrior

who thought to subdue her through strength and ferocity.

Vaug  also  has  the  support  of  Old  Puchk  (CE  male  orc

Clr5 of Gruumsh), a Gruumsh-priest who watches over the

Fang of Skulls and the altar regardless of whether a Torn-

skull claw holds the pass or not. Puchk often flies into fits of

frothing rage as he harangues the other orcs about their duty

to  their  one-eyed  god.  A  couple  of  junior  priests  help  Old

Puchk to tend Gruumshs holy site and guard the cleric.

GUARD ARRANGEMENTS

Three  talons  are  on  duty  at  any  given  time.  One  talon  is

stationed  at  the  west  standpile  (area  2),  one  at  the  east

standpile (area 10), and one splits into two groups to watch

over the rockheights overlooking the north and south ap-

proaches to the pass (areas 1 and 9). Of the five remaining

talons,  two  are  usually  out  foraging  down  the  Rainbow

Gorge and the lower reaches of the pass, while three more

are  generally  sleeping  or  eating,  one  in  each  of  the  cave

mouths (area 7).

The Pass

The orcs of Vaugs Claw are not especially vigilant, especially

during  the  painful  hours  of  daylight.  Word  has  gotten  out

that Dead Orc Pass is held in force by the Tornskulls, and so

few travelers have come this way in months. Orcs on watch

at  the  west  rockheight  (area  1)  watch  for  the  approach  of

anyone  up  through  the  head  of  Rainbow  Gorge.  The  trail

switchbacks up a boulder-field covered in green moss, which

is treated as scrub, brush, or bush for spotting distances (see

Table 31 in the  DUNGEON MASTERs Guide). The orcs in

areas  1  and  2  are  generally  well  hidden  in  the  rockheights

and standpiles (Spot DC 27 for approaching characters).

If  the  orcs  spot  a  large  force  approaching,  they  raise  a

general alarm by means of their torches and horns. If they

spot a small party approaching, they send runners to quietly

alert nearby talons and set an ambush in the pass, unless it

seems clear that theyve been spotted themselves, in which

case the orcs raise a general alarm.

The same rules apply for parties approaching from the east,

except that the orcs in the east rockheight (area 9) are respon-

sible for keeping watch in that direction. The upper reach of

the  trail  on  the  east  side  traverses  open  ground  with  little

cover, so travelers can be spotted from somewhat farther off.

1. WEST ROCKHEIGHT (EL 4)

On this high ledge the orcs have forced goblin slaves to hew

boulders out of the mountainsides and pile them ready for

rolling or hurling down the precipitous mountainsides into

the trail below. Each rockheight has a store of one hundred

suitably  sized  rocks,  averag-

ing  about  120  pounds  each.

The rockheight is about 100

feet higher than the trail, so

a boulder inflicts 5d6 points

of damage to anyone struck.

Each  orc  in  the  rock-

height  can  roll  one  boulder

every  three  rounds,  since  it

takes  two  full-round  actions

to hoist a boulder to the edge

of the ledge and make some

effort at aiming it. To attack

with a rolled boulder, an orc

makes a ranged touch attack

at an attack bonus of +0, ig-

noring all other modifiers

except  for  range  incre-

ment  and  the  targets

cover.  Rolled  boulders

have a range increment of

40  feet,  so  from  this  rock-

height there is a 6 penalty

on the orcs attack rolls. If a

rolled  boulder  misses,  treat

it  as  a  grenadelike  weapon

(see  Chapter  3  of  the  DUN-

GEON MASTERs  Guide).

Orcs  on  the  rockheights  are  also

armed with shortbows and melee

weapons  to  defend  themselves

against attackers who scale the slopes to get at them.

This rockheight is linked to the cave mouths (area 7) by

a small tunnel that winds back into the mountainside.

Orc Warriors (4): hp 4 each. Greataxe, shortbow with 20

arrows, rolled boulders (see above).

Talon Leader: hp 16.

2. WEST STANDPILE (EL 5)

This redoubt consists of a ring of sheltering stones. Its only

one  of  several  similar  constructions  in  the  pass.  The  west

standpile  is  garrisoned  by  a  talon  of  eight  orc  warriors,  a

runner, and a talon leader. It is equipped with a calling horn

and a beacon, a torch surrounded by a metal basket to hold

extra fuel that can be raised atop a 20-foot-long pole. If the

orcs spot intruders they think havent seen them, the talon

will wait to try a surprise volley of arrows.

The walls of the standpile are about 8 feet high and 5 feet

131

thick at the base. Fighting-steps 5 feet high on the inner side

allow  the  warriors  to  fire  over  the  parapet  with  one-half

cover.  Attackers  standing  on  the  ground  outside  the  ring

need reach weapons (or 10 feet of natural reach) to attack

orcs behind the parapet with melee weapons. Orcs on duty in

the standpile carry shortbows and longspears to use their po-

sition to its best advantage.

The standpiles have no entrancea Climb check (DC 15)

is necessary to scale the redoubts wall from the outside (the

orcs inside the wall usually toss over a knotted rope to help

comrades get inside). Anyone can jump out of a stand-

pile  from  one  of  the  fighting

ledges  as  a  move-equivalent

action, landing at the foot of the

wall without difficulty.

Orc  Warriors  (8): hp  4  each.

Longspear,  dagger,  shortbow

with 20 arrows.

Orc Runner: hp 4.

Talon Leader: hp 16.

3. BLACK POOL

This often ice-rimed pool is some

60 feet long and half that across

in most places. Its a steep-sided

hole  filled  with  foul,  black,

stinking  water  contaminated

with  blinding  sickness  (see  Dis-

ease  in  Chapter  3  of  the  DUN-

GEON MASTERs Guide).

At its bottom, 30 feet down,

are the remains of many crea-

tures slain by orc arrows over

the years. Amid the welter of

bones in the muck are 120 sp,

44  gp,  a  pair  of  30-gp  gems,  a

gold bracelet worth 90 gp, and a

ring  of  animal  friendship

(Search  DC  15  to  locate  the

ring).  Of  course,  any  intruder

diving  to  search  for  items  in  the

muck  will  probably  emerge  sur-

The Fang of Skulls

rounded by the warriors of Vaugs Claw.

4. VACANT ROCKHEIGHTS

These  four  ledges  resemble  area  1  in  most  details,  but  are

currently ungarrisoned. In the event of a serious attack, the

talons in area 7 could reach most of these locations through

winding tunnels deep in the mountainside.

5. VACANT STANDPILES

These five redoubts resemble area 2 in most details, but are

currently empty. In response to a serious attack, the talons in

area 7 could quickly occupy these strongpoints.

6. THE FANG OF SKULLS

This pinnacle is adorned with the yellowing skulls of many

Tornskull victims, some of them from massive tusked beasts.

The 40-foot-high fang of rock has been bound about with

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 132

Adventures in the North

many  hide  thongsnot  just  to  hold  the  crumbling  skulls

on, but to lash a crude ladder to the tor. Orcs use this as a

lookout point when intruders are known to be in the pass.

Rotten  bone  fragments  lie  scattered  for  some  distance

around  the  base  of  the  fang.  Many  adventurers  over  the

years have reported that a portal exists atop the summit of

the fangbut no one can agree on the destination it reaches.

7. CAVE MOUTHS (EL 4)

Entrances to the Raurinheart caverns lie on both the north

and the south side of the pass. Within each cave mouth, sev-

eral  rough  guard  chambers  serve  as  crude  barracks  for

Vaugs claw; at any given time one talon is in each cave. Sup-

plies, cookfires, and filthy sleeping pallets crowd each cave.

The  two  northern  cave  mouths  lead  through  a  mile  or

more of twisting, difficult passages to the nearest cavernhold

of the Tornskulls, beneath Mount Jaws. More than five hun-

dred orcs, including two claws of warriors, inhabit the steam-

ing  caverns;  a  claw  of  warriors  can  be  summoned  to  Dead

Orc  Pass  within  an  hour  in  the  event  of  a  major  attack.

Other  tunnels  from  these  guardrooms  lead  to  the  rock-

heights on the northern side of the pass (areas 1 and 9).

The southern cave mouth features two small tunnels that

ascend to the southern rockheights (area 4), and a larger pas-

sage  heading  south.  After  a  short  distance  this  reaches  the

Shrine of Gruumsh (area 11) and Vaugs chambers (area 12)

and then continues for about three miles before reaching an-

other cavernhold of the Tornskulls orcs.

Orc Warriors (8): hp 4 each.

Orc Runner: hp 4.

Talon Leader: hp 16.

8. OLD SKULL ALTAR

A  massive  stone  table  made  of  a  roughly  rectangular  flat

slab of rock 12 feet across and over 30 feet long, this place is

traditionally  used  by  Tornskulls  orcs  to  sacrifice  especially

valiant  foes  to  Gruumsh.  As  necessary,  Old  Puchk  publicly

flays or breaks disobedient orcs of the tribe. Because anything

laid  on  the  altar  belongs  to  Gruumsh  and  must  be  left  ex-

actly where it falls, beings are usually stripped before being

tormented on the altar.

Around the altar lie relics from occasions when this pre-

caution was not taken: rusting, useless weapons and scraps of

Orc Treasure

The  orcs  of  Vaugs  Claw  possess  a  small  amount  of

coinage and valuables. Each orc usually carries his coin

on his person.

Warriors  and  runners  normally  have  1d610  cp,

2d45 sp, and 1d6 gp each, carried in filthy belt-pouches

or purses.

Talon  leaders,  adepts,  and  underpriests  normally  have

about 2d410 cp, 2d65 sp, and 2d65 gp each. Leaders

carry a similar amount of coin and possess special items too.

armor, a handful of coins, and other knickknacks. The orcs

wont touch these objects or prevent anyone from snatching

them up if they try to do sofor they believe Gruumsh will

strike dead anyone who misuses what is his.

9. EAST ROCKHEIGHT (EL 4)

This ledge is identical to the west rockheight (area 1) and is gar-

risoned in a similar manner. Like the western ledge, this one is

equipped with one hundred rocks for rolling down on the trail

below. This rockheight is a little farther from the trail than the

western one, and is a full 150 feet away from the trail.

This rockheight is linked to the northern cave mouths (area

7) by a small tunnel that winds back into the mountainside.

Orc Warriors (4): hp 4 each. Greataxe, shortbow with 20

arrows, rolled boulders (see area 1 for details).

Orc Runner: hp 4.

10. EAST STANDPILE (EL 5)

This redoubt is identical to the west standpile (area 2). Like the

one at the other end of the pass, the east standpile is garrisoned

by a talon of eight orc warriors, a runner, and a talon leader. See

area 2 for details on orc tactics and defenses in the standpile.

Orc Warriors (8): hp 4 each. Longspear, dagger, shortbow

with 20 arrows.

Orc Runner: hp 4.

Talon Leader: hp 16.

11. SHRINE OF GRUUMSH (EL 6)

About  200  feet  farther  into  the  mountainside  from  the

southern  cave  mouth  lies  the  Shrine  of  Gruumsh,  a  low,

rough-hewn chamber lit by smoking braziers. Old Puchk and

his two underpriests reside here, although at least once a day

they visit the Fang of Skulls (area 6) and the altar (area 8) to

conduct Gruumshs rites out in the pass.

Old Puchk: hp 29. See below.

Orc Clerics: hp 4 each. See below.

12. VAUGS CHAMBERS (EL 7)

Vaug  the  Strong  appropriated  a  small,  spartan  group  of

rooms not far from the Shrine of Gruumsh as his personal

quarters and command chambers. Vaug has one room here,

Anya another, and Vaugs two adepts share a third room in

this area. The two runners assigned to the commander sleep

on the floor before his door and double as his bodyguards

not that Vaug needs much guarding, at least against the orcs

he  leads  in  battle.  Anya  is  usually  not  around;  she  spends

most  of  her  time  scouting  the  surrounding  area.  A  serious

fight in here will certainly bring Old Puchk and his under-

priests to investigate within a few rounds.

Vaug the Strong: hp 44.

Shamans (2): hp 10.

Runners (2): hp 4.

Treasure:  In  addition  to  the  personal  wealth  carried  by

each orc, these chambers hold some bulky goods taken from

unlucky traders who didnt know the Tornskulls had decided

to garrison the pass. Ten huge panniers from a dwarf mule-

train lie in one cavern, locked away behind a crude wooden

gate. (The orcs cooked and ate the mules.) The trains trade

goods  included  80  pounds  of  linen  (value  320  gp),  200

Telkouns Tower

Between Mount Thorog and Mount Ieldroun in the Nether

Mountains lies an inaccessible valley known as High Thorog.

From this remote spot fierce perytons swoop out to snatch

up  people,  mounts,  draft  animals,  and  even  pets,  bearing

them back to the hidden valley. Few such taken creatures

are  ever  seen  again;  they  join  the  vanished  dead  of  the

Nether Mountains.

Although  the  usual  orcs,  mountain  monsters,  and  even

hunting Morueme dragons imperil creatures venturing into

the mountains around High Thorog, there are several easy

passes through themreaching the vale is more a matter of

scrambling up rocks and hacking aside vegetation than rock

climbing.  The  easiest  entrance  to  the  vale  is  through  the

south, where a moraine dam between Mount Thorog and the

peak to the east traps a small tarn.

Adventures in the North

High Thorog

At  first  glance,  the  valley  seems  uninhabited,  filled  with  a

wild forest of conifers, blueleaf, duskwood, felsul, and shad-

owtops,  choked  underfoot  by  helmthorn  and  berry-bushes.

Several drinkable springs rise on the valeside peaks and me-

ander  down  to  the  mountain  tarn.  Except  for  the  black

double towerTelkouns Towerrising in a ring of shadow-

tops at the east end of the valley, High Thorog seems a ver-

dant, untouched wilderness.

In truth, High Thorog is a battleground of beasts, roamed

by starving monsters released from Telkouns Tower and left

to fend for themselves (for the sorcerer Telkouns entertain-

ment and study, and to serve as guardians against unwanted

intruders).  These  marauders  have  long  since  scoured  the

valley  clear  of  all  but  the

tiniest birds and forest life,

and  now  they  savage  each

other.  Even  the  perytons

have learned to fly off and

hunt  elsewhereif  one

dares  to  pounce  on  a  crea-

ture amid the trees of High

Thorog, its quite likely sev-

eral monsters will converge

to drag it down and tear it

apart  on  the  spot  with

fangs and claws.

Telkouns

Beasts

Several  monsters  freed

from  Telkouns  Tower  in-

habit  the  valley.  These  in-

clude  an  achaierai,  two

girallons, a trio of digesters,

a  six-headed  Lernaean

hydra, a gray render, and a

pair of owlbears. The mon-

sters roam the valley floor

more or less at random; for

every  5  minutes  that  in-

truders  spend  wandering

the  valley,  there  is  a  20%

chance that they encounter

one of these savage creatures. Consult the table below to de-

termine which monster the party meets.

Once killed or otherwise defeated, each monster or monster

group is removed from the table. Treat any subsequent result

indicating an encounter with that creature as no encounter

clearing around the tower.

The Xaos is a chaos beast of twice normal size, recently re-

leased  from  the  stasis  sphere  inside  Telkouns  Tower.  It  is

currently under the influence of the sorcerers charm mon-

ster spell. It simply drives the other monsters back into the

forest, keeping the area around the tower clear. If Telkoun

becomes aware of intruders in the valley, he orders the Xaos

to find them and attack. The Xaoss statistics can be found at

Mt. Teldroun

On  high  rock  ledges  over-

eleven  perytonsfour

mated  pairs  and  three

lonerswho  serve  Telk-

oun with utter loyalty. The

sorcerer  routinely  uses

largest  and  strongest,  and

backs  up  his  magical  per-

suasion  with  rich  rewards.

The  sorcerer  allows  his

of  the  treasure  from  the

caravans  and  travelers

they  raid,  and  aids  them

from  time  to  time  in

taking prizes the perytons

could  not  overcome  by

themselves.  At  any  given

time,  about  half  the  pery-

tons  are  off  in  the  neigh-

boring  mountains  and

passes,  searching  for  crea-

tures to snatch or caravans

to plunder. They are under

orders  to  watch  the  vale

and  report  intruders

movements  to  Telkoun,

but  they  do  not  attack  unless  the  intruders  seek  to  fly  or

climb up to the upper levels of the wizards tower.

mundane items, and 1d3 minor items. Some amount of pil-

laged trade goods litter each nest, too, such as furs, bolts of

cloth, sacks of flour, and so on. The perytons have little use

for such things, but constantly feud and squabble over whose

nest is decorated with the finest plunder.

Adventures in the North

Telkouns Tower

The sorcerers abode is a menacing double tower. Twin, joined

cylinders of black, fused stone topped by needle-sharp spires

soar tall and thin into the sky. A short yoke or waist joins the

two towers, giving a cross-section shaped a little like a bar-

bell. A door on the ground floor of the eastern tower pro-

vides  access  to  the  towers  interior.  Only  a  few  windows

pierce the tower walls, in the rooms specifically noted below.

Each window is a narrow slit about 4 feet high and 1 foot

wide, filled with glasslike crystal 3 inches thick.

The tower is defended by a handful of gargoyles, paid well

(and  charmed  when  necessary)  by  the  sorcerer  to  ensure

their loyalty.

1. THE TOWER DOOR (EL 6)

On the ground floor of the neck between the towers stands a

large entry door of iron plate, 8 feet tall and 5 wide, in an arch-

way  of  stone  carved  with  hideous  figures,  unlike  the  smooth

flanks of the rest of the tower. Two gargoyles stand guard here,

frozen against the background of the carvings around the door.

They take full advantage of their racial ability to remain per-

fectly still and blend in against worked stone. Telkoun routinely

casts bulls strength on the gargoyles guarding the tower door.

Gargoyles (2): hp 38 each.

The door is locked (Open Lock DC 30, break DC 28) and

Telkoun  carries  the  only  key.  However,  it  can  be  opened

from the inside. In those rare cases where Telkoun entertains

visitors,  he  simply  orders  the  gargoyles  in  area  2  to  admit

anyone who seems to have legitimate business with him.

2. THE EASTERN TOWER (EL 6)

From the hall inside the tower door, a simple wooden door

opens  into  a  central  open  shaft,  filling  the  whole  eastern

tower. The eastern tower is given over to a spiral stair around

the  central  open  shaft,  with  landings  at  every  floor.  Plain

wooden  doors  at  each  landing  open  into  the  western  tower.

Continual flame torches spaced every 20 feet along the stair-

case illuminate this dizzying chamber.

Seven gargoyles roost in area 5, the fifth floor of the western

tower. Two of these always stand watch outside area 1, while two

others stand watch in the eastern tower. They like to perch on

the second or third floor landings, where they can keep an eye

on the ground floor without being easily seen themselves.

Gargoyles (2): hp 38 each.

In the event of a serious incursion into the tower, one gar-

goyle on watch here goes to area 5 and summons the three

gargoyles in that room to join the fight, while the other gar-

goyle  on  watch  goes  to  area  7  to  alert  Telkoun.  Gargoyles

fighting in here are fond of attempting to grapple foes with-

out  melee  weapons  and  drag  them  off  the  stairs  or  drop

them down the shaft. They avoid grappling characters who

would receive an attack of opportunity against a grappler.

Fighting on Stairs: Characters who take damage while on

the stairs must make Balance checks (DC 5) to avoid falling

down the steps. Falling characters fall for 1d210 feet. If a

character falls 20 feet, he must attempt a Climb check (DC

10) or go over the side into the open shaft. Normal falling

damage  from  the  characters  current  height  applies  (each

floor of the tower is about 15 feet high).

3. GROUND FLOOR

This room contains a well (with two draw-buckets and rope),

and  seven  small  iron-bar  cages  to  hold  recently  captured

creatures. Six are empty, but one contains three beholderkin

eyeballs. Telkoun is not overly attentive to feeding the crea-

tures, and theyre inclined to blast anyone or anything enter-

ing the room with their ray of frost ability.

Beholderkin  Eyeballs  (3):  hp  3  each.  See  Monster  Com-

pendium: Monsters of Faern (or substitute shocker lizard).

4. SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH FLOOR

When the tower was first built, these rooms were reserved for

tower  guards  and  servants.  Now  Telkoun  has  rearranged

them  to  his  own  needs.  They  all  contain  large,  stout,  pad-

locked  cages  capable  of  holding  Large-sized  creatures.  Most

are empty and unlocked, sans key (Telkoun carries a common

key for all cages), but a cage on the third floor contains two

young adventurers: Osten (NG male human Clr3 of Tyr) and

Niema (CG female sun elf Wiz4). These two are the only sur-

vivors of a company of six adventurers who were exploring

the peaks nearby when Telkouns perytons swooped down on

them. Theyve been held in the tower for a little more than a

tenday,  and  gladly  join  any  efforts  to  defeat  the  evil  sor-

cereralthough all their gear has been taken away, and nei-

ther has been permitted to prepare any spells.

5. FIFTH-FLOOR CHAMBER (EL 7)

This room is the roost of the towers gargoyles. Seven of the

creatures inhabit the tower, although only three are here at

any given time. At the gargoyles request, Telkoun put in a

secret door at the neck, allowing them to fly in and out of

the tower. From the ground outside, the door is impossible to

spot,  but  a  flying  intruder  making  a  careful  search  of  the

area between the towers on the fifth floor can find it. The

door is not locked and opens with a simple catch.

Gargoyles (3): hp 32 each.

Treasure:  Telkoun  pays  the  gargoyles  well  for  their

service. Two heavy wooden chests against the wall contain

6,500 sp, 440 gp, a dragon-ivory statuette worth 380 gp, a

small pouch of gems (four worth 20 gp each, two worth 40

gp each, and one worth 300 gp), a masterwork breastplate,

a potion of endurance, and a potion of cure moderate wounds.

In  addition,  a  small  heap  of  equipment  lies  nearbythe

gear of the two adventurers in area 4. This includes a suit

of  +1  half-plate  armor,  a  +1  frost  dagger, a  masterwork

heavy mace, a scroll of neutralize poison, and two backpacks

stuffed with various supplies (rations, rope, and so forth).

6. SIXTH-FLOOR CHAMBER

This larder is lined with shelves crammed with all manner of

foodstuffs;  Telkoun  has  kept  the  perytons  busy  emptying

caravan  wagons.  The  room  doubles  as  a  kitchen  and  tool-

room. One wall is stacked with firewood, beneath a counter,

flanked by a sink. The outside wall has a hearth with outside

chimney, cauldrons and hooks. The other wall is lined with

workbenches overhung with shelves holding rope, wire, cof-

fers, pegs, hasps, hinges, and other common goods and tools.

Assume that there is a 50% chance that any common item

(items valued at 2 gp or less) from Table 77 in the Players

Handbook is  present  in  some  quantity,  and  a  10%  chance

that any rare or unusual item is present. A loose stone in the

floor conceals a small stone token, the key to the portal in

area 8 (search DC 20).

7. SEVENTH-FLOOR CHAMBER (EL 4)

The  door  leading  to  this  room  is  normally  locked  (Open

Lock DC 30). Again, Telkoun carries the only key. An elec-

tricity trap defends the hall leading from the landing to the

west tower. Anyone walking across the indicated portion of

the floor triggers the device, unless he carries a specific token

on his person. Telkoun carries one, of course, and he has five

extras he can give out to visitorsnot that he ever does.

Electrifed  Hallway  Trap:  CR  4;  hallway  (3d10);  Reflex

save  (DC  14)  for  half  damage;  Search  (DC  25);  Disable

Device (DC 25).

The sorcerer is usually found in here or in area 8. The sev-

enth-floor chamber comprises Telkouns living, dining, and

study room. It sports an armchair, a covered bed, a writing

Stasis Sphere

This device is a glowing, greenish sphere of crystal about 8 feet

in diameter. When touched by its owner and commanded, one

creature within 30 feet of the sphere may be placed in tempo-

ral stasis and imprisoned inside the sphere. The target is enti-

tled to a Will saving throw (DC 23) to resist the effect. The

sphere contains an extradimensional space in which as many

as fifty creatures of any size may be imprisoned. By a second

command, one imprisoned creature may be released. If the

spheres master does not specify by name, type, or accurate

physical  description  which  creature  is  to  be  released,  the

sphere releases one imprisoned creature at random.

If the stasis sphere is breached (hardness 20, 50 hp), all

trapped  creatures  are  immediately.  Once  the  stasis  sphere

has been used fifty times to imprison creatures (each time

using  up  one  of  the  items  charges),  it  can  no  longer  im-

prison new creatures. However, creatures inside can be held

in temporal stasis indefinitely. When the last prisoner is re-

leased and the sphere is out of charges, the device collapses

into a burned-out husk of smoky glass.

lined with various books on magic and magical lore.

Treasure: A small iron chest under the bed contains 5,400

sp, 1,100 gp, and 60 pp. By the hearth stands a beautiful old

harp inlaid with silver, worth 600 gp. On the nightstand lies

a silver platter, ewer, and two matched goblets, worth 180 gp

as a set.

8. EIGHTH-FLOOR CHAMBER (EL 14)

This imposing room is more than 30 feet high. It contains a

stone block cutting-table fitted with massive manacles capa-

ble of holding giants. An 8-foot sphere of glowing green crys-

tal pulses against the southern wall, and

several  gleaming  knives  and

needles,  each  as

long  as  a

arm,  lie

on  a  small

table  near  the

door.

The  monsters  of  the  vale,  the  perytons,  and  the  gargoyles

that  guard  Telkouns  tower  all  conform  to  the  normal  de-

Telkoun himself are described below.

was  left  in  the

tower by its pre-

vious  owner,

and  is  in  fact  a

relic  of  ancient

Net-heril  itself.

It has been used

to imprison thirty-

three  creatures,  although

Telkoun has freed eleven of them

(these are the monsters roaming High

Thorog).  Since  the  sorcerer  has  no  way  of

knowing  who  or  what  he  might  free  when  he  releases  some-

thing from the sphere, he approaches the process with no small

degree of caution. If attacked here, Telkoun retreats to stand

beside the sphere and uses its power to imprison any foes who

come within range. He knows there are a limited number of

charges left in the sphere and will seek to end hostilities after

imprisoning one or two attackers, hoping to ransom their re-

lease from their companions. In a completely desperate situa-

tion, Telkoun may resort to freeing random creatures in the

hopes of distracting his enemies while he escapes through the

portal to the north.

Against  the  northern  wall  of  this  room  stands  a  blank

stone archwaya keyed portal. It leads to a matching keyed

portal atop  a  wild  hilltop  not  far  outside  Scornubel,  where

Telkoun often used to go to trade. The key, worn by Telkoun

on his keyring, is a pierced stone shaped like a thimble. Sev-

eral spares are buried on the hilltop, and one is hidden under

a loose floor-stone in the kitchen (area 6).

Born of an evil sorceress and a powerful demon, Telkoun has

always hungered for magical power. As his sorcerous abilities

grew  stronger,  he  adventured  far  and  wide  across  Faern,

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 138

Adventures in the North

seeking the secrets of true power. Almost twenty years ago

he  and  his  companions  stumbled  across  the  perfect  strong-

hold, the old Netherese tower of High Thorog. After clear-

ing out the monsters inhabiting the place, Telkoun turned on

his companions and enslaved them all, making himself the

sole master of the tower.

Telkoun  has  spent  years  riddling  out  the  secrets  of  the

tower. The greatest and most dangerous of these is the stasis

sphere. He has come to believe that a demon lord is among

the creatures imprisoned within the sphere and is cautiously

experimenting with ways to identify the exact occupants of

the sphere before releasing them. He dreams of freeing the

spheres  secret  prisoner  and  extorting  a  great  and  dark

reward for his aid.

Corporeal  Instability: Any  creature  struck  by  the  melee

attack  of  the  Xaos  must  make  a  Fort  save  (DC  21)  or

become a spongy, amorphous mass. The affected creature is

unable  to  hold  or  use  any  object,  cannot  cast  spells  or  use

magic  items,  and  cannot  distinguish  friend  from  foe.  Its

speed is reduced to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever

is lower. It attacks as if blind. Each round in an amorphous

state deals 1 point of permanent Wisdom drain; if Wisdom

reaches 0, the creature becomes a chaos beast itself. The crea-

ture can regain its own shape for 1 minute with a successful

Charisma check (DC 15) and may attempt to reestablish its

normal form once per round until successful.

Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is

hard  to  remove.  A  shapechange or  stoneskin spell  does  not

cure the afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration

of the spell. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell re-

moves  the  affliction  (a  separate  restoration  is  necessary  to

restore any lost Wisdom).

Immune to Transformation: No spell or effect can change

the Adventure for information on adjusting this scenario for

parties of larger or smaller size and different levels).

Background

For the better part of its existence, the village of Deadsnows

has been a small, unremarkable community like many others

that dot the North. Its inhabitants braved the rigors of fron-

tier life, including orc hordes, wild beasts, and harsh winters.

These dangers have made the folk of Deadsnows both vigi-

lant and determined. They have managed to prevail over the

threats to their locale thus far, and to gain some measure of

relative stability for their community. That is, until now.

This  state  of  affairs  shifted  abruptly  when,  just  a  few

months ago, an unsuspecting hunter discovered gold in the

waters of a nearby stream. The settlements remote location

proved no hindrance to the spread of news and rumor related

to the gold strike, which ignited the interest of prospectors

and adventurers. Deadsnows is now the destination of choice

for explorers seeking their fortunes in the dangerous high-

lands above the town. Hard on their heels have come those

not interested in hunting for gold, but intent on exploiting

the situation. Some hope to earn coin by providing goods and

services to the prospectors and others with less savory activi-

ties such as confidence scams and outright thievery.

Adventure Synopsis

Blood  and  Gold  is  a  site-based  adventure.  It  differs  from

most scenarios of this type, however, in that the adventure

environment is not confined to one discrete location such as

a dungeon or a city. The player characters may visit not only

the  village  of  Deadsnows  itself,  but  three  adventure  sites

nearby (Death from Above, Orc Encampment, and The

Well of Darkness). Each of these locations contains a sepa-

rate, self-contained encounter that can be played without ref-

erence to the others, but common plot threads link some, so

that characters can involve themselves in a larger story.

Death from Above pits the characters against a pair of

wyverns  who  have  been  raiding  the  towns  flocks.  The

wyverns lair is only a couple of miles from the town.

Orc  Encampment describes  the  temporary  lair  of  Ur-

greth,  one  of  King  Oboulds  sons,  and  a  fierce  band  of  orc

warriors plotting mischief and murder in the town below.

The Well of Darkness revolves around a temple to Shar

the Xaoss form, including polymorphing and petrification.

hidden in an abandoned mine, not too far from the town.

Blood and Gold

Blood  and  Gold  is  a  small  campaign  set  in  the  Silver

Marches, a detailed milieu of rugged terrain, adventure sites,

and  dangerous  situations,  all  within  a  relatively  small  geo-

graphic area. The action takes place in the vicinity of the vil-

lage  of  Deadsnows.  All  the  adventure  sites  and  events  of

Blood and Gold are designed to stand alone, though all are

loosely connected.

All of the encounters within Blood and Gold are suitable

for four 5th-level player characters (see the sidebar Scaling

In  addition  to  these  adventure  sites,  two  event-triggered

encounters are presented here: The Blood Stalkers, an en-

counter with two vicious worgs who happen to be Urgreths

pets, and Claim Jumpers, an encounter with some of the

seedier gold-seekers who now crowd Deadsnows.

CHARACTER HOOKS

Why will your players want their characters to venture into

Deadsnows country? Remember that this is less a linear story

and more of a series of connected adventure sites. You can

start  the  adventure  at  any  convenient  location  within  the

given  area.  As  for  the  characters  motivations,  you  can

invent your own reasons for the player characters to travel

Adventures in the North

here, or you can choose from one of the following options.

Couriers:  The  party  is  engaged  to  carry  important  mes-

sages or documents from Silverymoon to Deadsnows. These

messages could be connected with the communitys current

problems, or they might be of a different nature altogether.

Gold Fever: News of the Deadsnows gold rush makes the

characters  heads  dance  with  visions  of  sudden  wealth.  In-

trigued by the opportunity to become rich, or by the chances

for employment the situation offers, the characters travel

to Deadsnows.

Law and Order: The party learns of the troubles besetting

Deadsnows and decides to lend a hand in restoring security

and order to the folk of the village. If the characters are al-

ready citizens of the Silver Marches, they might be prevailed

upon by the league to represent its interests in Deadsnows.

Duty  Calls:  Rumors  of  Arcane  Brotherhood,  orc,  or  kir-

lanan  activity  in  the  vicinity  of  Deadsnows  prompts  a  re-

sponse from the Harpers. A Harper agent suggests that the

party  make  itself  useful  by  reconnoitering  the  Deadsnows

area on behalf of the organization.

Deadsnows

Upon the characters arrival in the community, read or para-

phrase the following aloud to the players:

Nestled  in  the  northernmost  slopes  of  the  Nether

Mountains lies the small settlement of Deadsnows. The

surrounding  mountainsides  throw  deep,  cold  shadows

over the town. Sheep graze on the lower slopes, guarded

by  crossbow-armed  shepherds  as  they  nibble  at  the

coarse  grass  that  grows  between  rocky  outcroppings.

Beyond the grazing land, the land rises rapidly to rocky

crags  covered  sparsely  with  fir  trees,  and  then  to  the

mist-shrouded Nether Mountains rearing into the sky.

From these heights a swift, clear stream cascades down-

ward  over  several  shallow  falls  to  race  past  the  town

itself.  A  cluster  of  perhaps  two  hundred  wood-frame

buildings encircled by an ancient stone wall lies in the

lower part of this alpine valley. Outside the wall, a col-

lection  of  tents,  lean-tos,  and  other  makeshift  shelters

grows like a patch of wild weeds.

After they arrive in the community, its up to the characters

how to spend their time. Presumably theyve come to Dead-

snows for a specific reason, one that is either the result of

campaign play or supplied by the DM (see Character Hooks,

above). Consult the Deadsnows map to determine the loca-

tion of the important sites listed in this adventure.

BASIC NECESSITIES

Food and lodging are a little difficult to come by in Dead-

snows at the moment. The towns economy is in chaos as a

result  of  the  boom  in  population.  Characters  can  choose

from the following establishments (most of them keyed on

the map of Deadsnows).

The Hospice of Marthammor (area 1): Travelers can count

on  one  nights  shelter  and  a  single  meal  of  hard  bread  and

cheese in the hospice regardless of their means. The dwarves

normally put up about five to ten travelers each night, but can

make room for as many as twenty. After the first night and

first meal, a days lodging costs 2 sp for a pallet in the hospices

dormitory, and an austere meal of bread and cheese 1 sp more.

The  clerics  of  Marthammor  turn  out  guests  after  a  tenday

unless theyre dwarves or they have done something to earn

the special friendship of Kerrilla Gemstar.

The  Blazon  (area  3):  This  tavern  serves  roast  mutton  or

beef,  accompanied  by  boiled  potatoes  and  greens,  for  5  sp  a

plate. It also offers three rooms for lodging, two of which are

currently  occupied.  The  third  room  sleeps  six  in  reasonable

comfort. The proprietor Lonnor knows how scarce good rooms

are right now, and he charges 5 gp per night for the room.

Icespear  House  (area  7): Noble  visitors  or  heroes  of

renown  can  stay  in  Lady  Icespears  home  indefinitely,  al-

though good manners would indicate that a stay of two ten-

days is long enough for anybody. Well-bred heroes remaining

in Deadsnows longer than that should make other arrange-

ments.  Lady  Icespears  staff  provides  a  comfortable  room

and three excellent meals each day to any guests, with no re-

muneration expected or accepted.

Lady  Icespear  offers  her  home  to  visiting  adventurers

only  if  theyve  earned  a  good  name  for  themselves  in  the

Silver Marches (although unscrupulous sorts might use a suc-

cessful Bluff check to wangle an offer of hospitality).

Vandarhouse  (area  9): This  ramshackle  old  barn  hardly

passes for an inn. The proprietor is a half-orc named Vandar

(NE  female  half-orc  Rog6)  who  puts  up  almost  seventy

guests in damp, cold pallets for 3 sp per night, or 5 sp if one

cares to include a meager meal of hardtack and broth to soak

it in. Vandar also runs a tavern consisting of a tent filled

with the cheapest ale she can get her hands on, charging a

stiff 1 sp per mug. Despite the price and the squalor, her tap-

house does a good business.

The  Rose  and  Hammer  (area  10):  The  only  true  inn

within Deadsnows walls, the Rose and Hammer is affiliated

with  both  the  Hospice  and  the  Watchtower.  It  provides

twelve private rooms (each sleeps two, at a cost of 4 gp per

day) and a common dormitory with room for up to twenty

(a pallet costs 6 sp per night). The price of lodging includes

two plain and somewhat stingy meals each day.

TIME OF YEAR

The  adventure  presumes  that  the  action  takes  place  in  the

month  of  Eleasis,  shortly  after  Midsummer  night.  You

should feel free to set the time of year that works best for

your  campaign.  If  you  choose  winter,  much  of  the  terrain

around  Deadsnows  will  be  virtually  impassable,  and  even

short expeditions into the wilderness may be dangerous be-

cause of the prevailing weather conditions.

RUMORMONGERING

An evening spent in the taprooms of the Blazon, the Rose and

Hammer,  or  Vandarhouse  and  an  expenditure  of  5  gp  or  so

allows a character to attempt a Gather Information skill check.

The higher the check result, the more information the charac-

ter gains; see below. (You may prefer to roleplay the acquisition

of rumors, in which case a skill check may not be necessary.)

Player characters who directly approach Captain Mannock,

139

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 140

Adventures in the North

Lady  Icespear,  or  the  leading  clerics  of  the  town  and  ask

about things that need doing will amost certainly be pointed

toward the first lead (the monster hunt), or possibly the orcs

to the west if the heroes request several options.

DC 10: A reward of 300 gp has been offered for the slaying

of a large flying monster that has been preying on the towns

flocks in the high pastures by night (see Upland Pastures, below).

DC 15: Several travelers seem to be overdue or missing.

Most were traveling in the vicinity of the Fork Road. Large

wolves were sighted there (see The Fork Road, below).

DC 15: Claim jumpers have driven some prospectors away

from good finds (see The Gold Fields, below).

DC 20: Orcs armed for war have been sighted in the high

vales west of the town (see Orc Encampment).

DC  25: A  dwarf  prospector  left  several  tendays  ago  to

search for an old mine north of the Fork Road, but was later

found dead on the Deadsnows road, parts of his body seem-

ingly  dissolved.  The  clerics  of  the  Hospice  buried  him.  (A

visit to the Hospice can shed more light on this rumor, and

leads to The Well of Darkness.)

Important Locations in

Deadsnows

Most  of  the  common  folk  of  Deadsnows  are  shepherds,

goatherds, woodcutters, trappers, and miners (the mountains

nearby are rich in iron ore, copper, and silver).

1. THE HOSPICE OF MARTHAMMOR

About  two  miles  from  Deadsnows  stands  a  fortified  abbey

dedicated  to  Marthammor  Duin,  the  dwarf  deity  who

watches  over  those  dwarves  who  dwell  among  the  human

communities  of  the  North.  Marthammors  portfolio  in-

cludes guides, explorers, travelers, and lightning. The Wan-

derers church is small, but his followers are loyal, and those

dwarves who find that their careers take them far afield do

not fail to pay him homage. Many dwarf adventurers revere

Marthammor,  especially  those  whose  travels  seem  to  lead

them in random or uncertain directions.

Observer Kerrilla Gemstar (NG female shield dwarf Clr8

of  Marthammor  Duin)  leads  the  abbey.  Beneath  her  are  a

dozen  clerics,  seven  monks,  ten  friars  (mostly  Com1  and

Com2 who have taken vows of service), and a dozen guards.

The  dwarves  run  a  hospice  and  refectory  for  travelers  in

need, which is almost always full these days.

Kerrilla willingly provides healing to good folk who are in

need, though not without a price. Typically she requests that

the recipient of such divine aid perform a service or favor

for the abbey. Such services might include helping keep order

in the town by volunteering for the city militia, or investi-

gating  one  of  the  troubling  rumors  or  solving  one  of  the

problems currently facing the town.

If asked about the prospector mentioned in the rumors above,

Kerrilla tells the party that by means of a speak with dead spell

she  learned  that  Bromgart,  the  prospector,  encountered  dark

clerics and a beast of blackness in the old Ironhand Mines.

She also tells the party the general location of the old mines

(the Well of Darkness adventure site, later in this section).

2. THE MORNING WATCHTOWER

Rising above the city walls, this slender tower casts its shadow

over the main gate. A banner flies from its topmost turret,

depicting the golden sunrise of Lathander, the Morninglord.

The Watchtower is home to five Lathanderite clerics, as well

as a couple of guards who make sure the temple is safe and

secure.  Morninglord  Ashnar  the  Humble  (LG  male  human

Clr4/Pal3 of Lathander) is the leader of the temple.

Ashnar is on excellent terms with Kerrilla of the Hospice,

and  they  frequently  confer  on  issues  of  importance  to  the

community.  Their  advice  and  support  is  much  sought  and

prized  by  many  townsfolk,  and  the  pair  has  never  been

remiss in offering assistance when it is needed.

Like the clerics of the Hospice, the Lathanderites of the

Watchtower  provide  healing  to  good  folk  who  are  in  need

(see Healing in Chapter 3 of the FOR-

GOTTEN REALMS Campaign Set-

ting).  Ashnar  is  something

of a crusader and tends to

push  and  prod  adventur-

ers into bold action.

3. THE BLAZON

Characters  seeking  a

place  to  have  a  bite

to  eat  will  be  di-

rected to this small

wood-frame  estab-

lishment.  Owned

and  operated  by  a

Deadsnows  native

named  Lonnor  (N

male human Com3), the

Blazon is considered one of

the  towns  best  watering  holes.  Its

wooden  sign  displays  a  painting  of  a  large

wooden  shield  with  a  green  field  separated

into top and bottom halves by a broad white bar. When asked

about the symbol, Lonnor shrugs and explains it was there

when he bought the place over twenty years ago.

Those frequenting the Blazon are primarily local timber

cutters, herders, and merchants who want to escape the din

and bustle now plaguing their once-quiet town. They are less

friendly to strangers than they might have been before the

gold rush began, and their reaction to newly arrived charac-

ters begins as neutral.

4. HASKAR RIVERSIDE, OUTFITTER

Haskar Riverside (LN male halfling Exp3) only a few months

ago complained loudly to anyone who would listen how poorly

business was progressing. Now his shop is one of the busiest in

the  town  as  he  sells  his  wares  at  inflated  prices  to  eager

prospectors.  Previously  his  clientele  included  timber  cutters,

fur trappers, and game hunters, to whom he sold axe heads and

handles,  traps,  arrows,  rope,  and  the  odd  backpack.  Now  he

sells climbing gear, pickaxes, whetstones, spades, iron rations,

tindertwigs, waterskins, lanterns and lantern oil, and a host of

other items to those seeking their fortunes in the gold fields.

The convenience of Haskars storeits the only genuine

outfitter  in  Deadsnows,  though  several  competitors  have

sprung  up  recently  in  Snowtown  (see  area  8  on  the  Dead-

snows map)combined with his ability to obtain new mer-

chandise  regularly  despite  the  shortages  everyplace  else  in

the  village  has  greatly  increased  the  number  of  his  cus-

tomers. Currently the establishments prices are running at

40% over those given in the Players Handbook.

5. APOTHECARY

Morwenna Dresdtinn, apothecary and herbalist, has catered

to the medicinal needs of Deadsnows since she inherited this

small  shop  from  her  father  more  than  twenty  years  ago.

Morwenna (CG human female Adp6) was on the high side of

fifty then, and shes no spring chicken now, as she likes to say

to  her  customers.  Her  expertise  is  obvious,  however,  by  the

deft manner in which she se-

lects,  prepares,  and  bottles

the

for

ingredients

common  home  remedies.

The  folk  of  the  town

come  to  her  for

salves to ease their

rheumatism,  poul-

tices  to  dull  their

toothaches,  and

teas  to  help

their  digestion.

She possesses the

skill  and  means

to  create  po-

tions  of  cure

light  wounds,

cure  moderate

wounds,  and

endure  elements,

which  she  sells  at  the

standard price. Her shop has

seen  considerable  custom  in  the  days  since  the  discovery  of

local gold: Many of the prospectors have come to her for po-

tions,  and  shes  been  a  bit  hard-pressed  to  keep  up  with  the

demand of late.

6. TOWN JAIL

This  one-story  stone  building  is  full  to  bursting  with  de-

tainees.  Most  of  the  incarcerated  are  humans  and  dwarves

from  Snowtown  (see  area  8)  who  were  arrested  for  being

drunk and disorderly in the city streets. A few are being de-

tained  for  committing  minor  crimes  such  as  petty  theft,

property  damage,  and  assault.  Lady  Arletha  Icespear  will

judge the latter as her schedule permits.

As  the  population  of  Deadsnows  grows,  the  overworked

militia makes more and more arrests, to the point where the

jail simply cannot hold any more people. The militia has re-

duced the sentence for most minor offenses to one night in

jail,  and  Lady  Icespear  and  her  council  are  working  on  a

system of monetary fines to augment the more traditional

punishment. Characters who are apprehended breaking any

7. ICESPEAR HOUSE

This  two-story  wood-and-stone  mansion  is  showing  signs  of

obvious age, but nevertheless it is one of the more impressive

structures in Deadsnows. The home of the Icespear family for

generations,  it  is  now  the  seat  of  Lady  Arletha,  the  towns

only hereditary noble and the nominal leader of the commu-

nity. The Ladys Guard, a squad of eight paid soldiers led by

Captain  Rivha  Stormevik  (CG  human  female  Ftr3),  guards

the iron gate piercing the manors encircling stone wall. The

mansion sits in the center of a fine, well-maintained garden.

The  guards  refuse  to  allow  anyone  to  pass  who  does  not

have an appointment to see Lady Icespear, or who is not in

Deadsnows on some kind of official business. Representatives

of the league of the Silver Marches or the designated envoys

of other member cities are permitted to enter, but only during

daytime and only after one of the guards announces the ar-

rival to the lady of the house. Anyone else (adventurers who

want to offer their assistance, for example) must write a letter

asking for an audience and hand it to a guard, who will convey

it to Lady Arletha. Unless the writer is clearly a time-waster

or has a bad reputation, the lady grants a brief audience at her

home, normally the following day.

Lady Artletha Icespear is the nominal ruler of Deadsnows,

and the last of her line. Her brother inherited the family title

from their mother ten years ago, but he met an untimely end

five years later when he led the towns militia against a band

of trolls that was terrorizing the outlying farmsteads. Since

then Arletha has borne the family title and the accompany-

ing responsibilities with grace and skill. She relies on an infor-

mal council for advice in making decisions. The members of

her  council  are  the  leaders  of  the  Morning  Watchtower,

Feldys  Oakshadow  (a  prominent  druid),  and  Mannock,  the

Captain of the Watch. She frequently invites certain of Dead-

snows more prosperous merchants to participate in council

discussions, as special advisors, when the topic concerns trade.

The citizens of Deadsnows respect Lady Icespear for her

sound judgment and basic fairness. They especially appreciate

her lack of ostentation; she doesnt bother to play the manor

noble or lord it over her lessers. Despite the fact that she is

one of the largest landowners in the area, she has never used

that  advantage  to  treat  any  of  her  tenants  unfairly.  The

strain  of  the  current  situation  is  beginning  to  tell  on  Ar-

letha, however, and her patience is starting to decay.

Lady  Icespear  receives  visitors  cordially  in  her  tasteful

but aging home. If visitors are polite and courteous, she will

treat  them  in  kind;  those  who  are  abusive  or  rude  will  be

shown the door by one of her household guards. The lady has

little time for long chats about unimportant topics, since she

has her hands full just trying to keep a lid on things. While

she recognizes that the gold strike is beneficial to Deadsnows

in some ways, she fears that it will ruin the town before it

ends.  Shes  grateful  for  any  tangible  help  that  characters

may choose to offer, and while the town cannot afford large

rewards for adventurers services, she assures any benefactors

that they have the good will of herself and her people.

8. SNOWTOWN

When the prospector population exploded beyond the capac-

ity  of  the  towns  inns,  taverns,  and  barns  to  accommodate

them,  the  arriving  gold  seekers  received  permission  from

Lady Icespear to set up a temporary camp outside the town

wall. That was a little more than a month ago. Now the pop-

ulation  of  Snowtown  (so  called  by  the  locals  because  they

expect it to vanish when the first snows come in autumn) is

larger than that of Deadsnows proper.

The  place  is  a  maze  of  small,  one-and-two-person  ram-

shackle  dwellings  thrown  together  without  care  for  appear-

ances. By day Snowtown is mostly empty, as the majority of

its inhabitants are away in the nearby hills searching for gold.

By night the place becomes a center of rowdy activity, fueled

by ale and hopeful spirits. All manner of dangers and vices

that were hardly known in Deadsnows prior to this tumul-

tuous time have appeared in Snowtown: gambling, drugs, and

prostitution are chief among these. A night in Snowtown is

far more dangerous to the unwary than the same night spent

within the walls of Deadsnows. Drunken prospectors, greedy

claim jumpers, deft pickpockets, and other unsavory types all

make it necessary to stay on constant alert for trouble.

9. VANDARHOUSE

One of the few structures of substance in Snowtown, Vandar-

house is a large, ramshackle inn consisting of a rambling,

leaky old barn and several nearby outbuildings, all joined by

an open-sided tent. Vandar (NE female half-orc Rog6), the

proprietor, and her crew of a dozen ruffians prey ruthlessly

upon those poor or foolish enough to put themselves in her

caremany prospectors have returned to their lodgings here

from the gold fields only to be robbed blind while they slept.

She  has  bought  off  a  couple  of  town  watchmen,  and  shes

thinking about having Captain Mannock removed from the

picture, since hes a little too inquisitive for his own good.

10. THE ROSE AND HAMMER

This comfortable inn is almost always full these days, thanks

to the gold rush. Nevertheless, characters who arent desper-

ate  enough  to  need  to  stay  at  the  Hospice  and  those  who

arent  renowned  enough  to  be  invited  to  stay  at  Icespear

House can find accommodations at the Rose and Hammer.

The inn is owned and operated by Hedrick the Hammer

Torlund (N male human Ftr3/Exp2), a retired fighter, and

his wife Rose (N female human Com2). They are generally

good-humored folk, exhibiting a friendly attitude toward all

who enter the place until given reason to think otherwise.

The Wilderness

Whenever characters leave the relative safety of Deadsnows

and  journey  far  afield,  they  become  subject  to  the  harsh

weather and dangerous monsters of the wild. Deadsnows and

the lands to the north are considered open country for pur-

poses of determining random weather (see Chapter 2), while

most  other  locales  in  and  around  the  town  are  considered

alpine areas.

For  purposes  of  wilderness  encounters,  treat  Deadsnows

and the lands to the north as part of the Moonlands, Adbar

Vale,  and  Cold  Vale  region  (Table  22).  Obviously,  anyone

faring into the mountains surrounding the town is traveling

through  the  Nether  Mountains  (Table  26).  Some  random

wilderness encounters can be deadly for mid-level parties, so

you should adjust the numbers or types of monsters encoun-

tered to fit an EL of 2 through 8 (assuming the player char-

acters average 5th level). The chance of an encounter for each

hour of travel depends on the characters efforts to proceed

quickly or cautiously; see Wilderness Encounters in Chapter 2.

No  wilderness  encounters  occur  within  two  miles  of  the

town walls during the day or within one mile at night or in

bad  weather.  Even  monsters  give  the  town  a  wide  berth

unless theyre looking for trouble.

A. UPLAND PASTURES (EL 7)

The town has long used these high patches of grassland for

grazing its livestock, mostly sheep, goats, and cattle. Cur-

rently  these  areas  are  the  hunting  grounds  of  a  pair  of

wyverns (see Death from Above, later in this chapter).

Deadsnows  Vale  winds  between  Mount  Grimfang  and

Mount  Oervhek  for  several  miles,  and  the  towns  shep-

herds and goatherds use pasturelands high on the slopes of

each mountain during the summertime. Herders and their

families  account  for  about  one  hundred  of  Deadsnows

people, and most of these live in small fieldstone cottages

scattered up and down the vale.

143

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 144

Adventures in the North

The  upland  pastures  are  currently  plagued  by  the  nightly

raids of a pair of wyverns. The creatures lair beneath a rocky

outcropping in the craggy slopes about three miles from Dead-

snows, and from this base they swoop down upon sleeping herds

of  livestock  to  snatch  a  few  juicy  morsels  about  every  other

night. This has been going on for a little more than a tenday,

and by now the shepherds of Deadsnows are a sleep-deprived,

paranoid lot. They know that something is attacking and carry-

ing  off  their  charges,  but  they  havent  been  able  to  catch  a

glimpse of it yet because it attacks so swiftly from the night sky.

The  characters  can  learn  of  this  situation  at  nearly  any

gathering place in Deadsnows. Should they require an incen-

tive to investigate, its common knowledge that the herders

have scraped up a reward of 150 gp for anyone who can put

a stop to this terror, which Lady Icespear has promised to

match.  If  the  characters  have  come  to  Deadsnows  on  the

business of the Silver Marches or Lady Alustriel, Lady Ice-

spear might approach them about helping the town rid itself

of  this  problem.  The  characters  may  wish  to  question  the

herders about what theyve seen, but they wont get more in-

formation than what is described above.

Death from Above

The  wyverns,  unaware  that  someone  has  been  engaged  to

stop them (and not likely to care even if they knew), hunt

for fresh meals as usual, striking a different pasture on every

other night. The best way for the heroes to catch them is to

simply pick a flock and keep watch; theres a 20% chance per

night of watching that theyre in the right pasture when the

wyverns strike. If the characters take steps to locate the most

inviting pasture (by moving several herds together to watch

them all at once, or perhaps through divination magic), the

chance increases to 50% per night of watching.

Because  the  pastures  offer  little  cover,  the  spotting  dis-

tance for the encounter is 6d620 feet. For purposes of this

encounter,  you  can  assume  partial  moonlight  obscured  by

clouds, which amounts to starlight. Characters keeping watch

on  the  ground  notice  the  wyverns  at  the  randomly  deter-

mined  spotting  distance  with  a  successful  Spot  check  (DC

22). If the characters are trying to stay out of sight, its hard

for the wyverns to notice them at the spotting distance (Spot

DC 35 plus the hiding characters worst Hide modifier, due

to  starlight).  See  Encounter  Distance  in  Chapter  3  of  the

DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. Note that the wyverns are un-

likely to spot hiding characters even at half the spotting dis-

tance,  and  may  swoop  in  to  attack  the  sheep  completely

unaware of the characters presence.

Wyverns (2): hp 66, 53.

Tactics:  The  pair  works  together  in  fending  off  attackers,

swooping  in  one  after  the  other  or  from  opposite  sides,  one

fighting while the other circles above waiting for its chance to

strike. The creatures flee back to their lair if either of them loses

more than half of its total hit points or if either one is killed.

Reward: The herders and Lady Icespear have combined to

offer a 300 gp reward for the slaying of whatever monster or

monsters are praying on the towns flocks. Before the herds-

folk hand over their hard-earned coins, theyd like to see evi-

dence that the characters succeeded. (Unscrupulous monster

hunters could report one dead wyvern as the entirety of the

problem and collect the reward, of course.) In the absence of

a monstrous corpse, a tenday without further attacks will be

taken as proof that the heroes solved the problem.

Development: If one or both of the wyverns survive their

encounter with the characters, they return to raid the live-

stock again after healing completely. The townsfolk might

believe that the monsters have been slain or driven off if the

pastures are free of the wyverns for a few successive nights,

but the creatures will be back when they are able.

B. WYVERNS LAIR (EL 8)

The wyverns live about three miles southeast of Deadsnows,

high up on a mountain ridge. Their lair is within a large rock

outcropping, sheltered on several sides by natural rock for-

mations. When the characters reach this area, read or para-

phrase the following information.

The sparse fir woods of the mountainside abruptly give

way to a slope of loose rock, leading up to a buttress of

jagged  stone  outcroppings  that  mark  the  spine  of  the

ridge. Scattered here and there across the open slope you

can  see  a  handful  of  bones,  bleached  white  by  the  ele-

ments, that seem to have slid down from higher up. A

faint whiff of rotting meat hangs in the air.

The wyverns know that anyone who managed to fight them

off  while  they  were  hunting  is  a  potential  threat  to  their

lives, so theyll keep watch for intruders if they fought the

party in the upland pastures. During daylight hours, there is

a 50% chance that one of the pair is asleep at any given time,

resting in order to recover from its wounds.

Energetic heroes who find their way to the wyverns lair

find that reaching the lair is a difficult climb up a wooded

mountainside.

The Approach: The worst part of the climb is just below

the lair, a broken slope 200 feet high that slopes at almost a

45-degree angle (DC 10 Climb check). Loose stones on the

slope tend to skitter out from under climbers feet, making a

fair  amount  of  noise  (allow  the  wyverns  Listen  checks  to

note  the  approach  of  anyone  on  foot).  As  the  heroes  get

closer, more animal bones come into view, and the reek of

dead flesh grows stronger and stronger.

The wyverns would prefer to catch intruders out on the

steep slope and attack from the air, but if cornered in their

lair, the pair will fight intruders to the death.

Wyverns (2): hp 66, 53.

If the heroes have previously damaged the wyverns, their

hit points should be reduced accordingly (but also take into

account  that  the  wyverns  may  have  healed  some  of  their

damage by the time they are encountered here).

Treasure: Some of the bones that lie around the wyvern

nest are those of humanoidsdwarves, elves, halflings, and

humans. From these victims, the wyverns have acquired the

following items, which now lie beneath their nest: a total of

400  gp  in  loose  coins;  a  pair  of  black  opals  worth  275  gp

each; and a leather pouch containing dust of illusion.

As noted in the preceding area description, heroes who bring

back proof of the wyverns defeat may claim the reward offered.

C. THE GOLD FIELDS (EL 5)

Beyond  Deadsnows  Vale  lie  the  Gold  Fields,  the  upland  area

drained  by  Icespear  Stream  in  the  mountains  surrounding  the

town. It was in one of the tributaries to this clear, cold water that

the first flecks of gold were found this past spring. More than

three hundred people of nearly every race and age spend most of

their  days  roaming  this  area.  The  hardier  and  better-equipped

prospectors camp up here, while others trudge into the high coun-

try from Snowtown every morning and back again every night.

While  some  of  the  more  promising  snowmelt  streams

have dried up by now, a number of streams, brooks, and rills,

fed by the permanent snows of the Nether Mountains, still

remain.  Along  these  creeks  the  prospectors  try  their  luck.

Some prospectors move from brook to brook every few days

hoping  for  a  strike,  while  others  locate  a  place  they  think

looks likely and settle in to work it for a month or longer.

A  number  of  prospectors  have  built  sluice  boxes  in  the

more  promising  locations.  These  devices  filter  the  water

through grilles and ladderlike boxes. The prospectors check

the  minerals  collecting  in  each  sluice  box  for  gold.  Mean-

while  the  water  sent  through  the  sluice  is  returned  to  the

creek from which it came a short distance downstream.

Other prospectors prefer to pan for gold. They seek out

stretches of shallow creeks and rills that look like they might

be promising and spend hours scooping up gravel from the

streambed. Bits of gold, if any, are extracted from the pan;

the rest of the material is tossed aside. Scores of prospectors

using this method can work the same body of water.

A day in the gold fields isnt an easy one. Most prospectors

rise at dawn to make the steep climb up to the mountain and

spring-fed streams. They take rations and water (and sometimes

stronger drink) along with them, in addition to all the gear and

equipment  that  they  might  require:  backpack,  rope,  pickaxe,

handaxe, knife, pans, pitons, candles, flint and steel, and torches.

Most also carry a piece of chalk, a lump of coal, or paint so that

they can mark the spots where they find good color or gold.

Although the number of streams and creeks should make

finding a good spot easy, the number of prospectors makes it

something of a challenge. Prospecting etiquette holds that a

person who happens upon another working a stretch of water

should move on until he can no longer see the person who was

there first. In practice, however, there are a number of mean-

spirited, selfish, disagreeable, or just plain unscrupulous pros-

pectors who completely ignore convention. Some are bullies

who drive off less aggressive or weaker searchers from choice

locations, while others are not above intimidating a success-

ful claim right out from under a lucky prospector.

Gangs of claim jumpers have started to form up in Snow-

town.  These  ruffians  wait  until  someone  reports  that  hes

found good color or a strike, and watch out for someone who

is  spending  money  a  little  too  prominently  in  and  around

town. Then the claim jumpers locate the lucky persons pan-

ning or sluice site, and use intimidation tactics or brute force

to convince him to surrender the claim to the jumpers party.

145

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 146

Adventures in the North

Claim Jumpers

This encounter can take place any time that the characters

are more than half a mile outside Deadsnows walls. A gang

of claim jumpers accosts the characters, and how the charac-

ters deal with them may establish their reputations for good

or ill during the rest of their stay in the vicinity.

Bellis, the leader of the claim jumpers, is a mercenary (NE

human  male  Ftr4)  who  arrived  in  Deadsnows  shortly  after

the news of the gold discovery started to spread. He has just

finished a term of service in the army of Everlund, but as a

lifelong bully (and a lazy one at that) he believes that he can

make  a  faster  profit  taking  over  the  gold  claims  of  others

than through soldiering or honest work. Bellis mistakes the

characters for prospectors and tries to intimidate them into

conveying their claims to him. While this strategy has gained

Bellis and his followers the ownership of a few claims, theyve

overlooked one important flaw in their scheme: They should

probably wait until after a claim yields gold before seizing it.

When you are ready to begin this encounter, read or para-

phrase the following information to the players.

Moving directly toward you at a brisk walk and with deter-

mined stares are four male humans. Three of the men are

wearing  similar  garb:  rough,  dirt-stained  leather  armor,

worn woolen trousers, patched woolen cloaks, and leather

boots that have seen a lot of hard use. Two of them carry

canvas bags thrown over one shoulder, and all three carry

stout wooden clubs. The fourth man is a few inches taller

and considerably fitter than his companions. His chainmail

armor and the sheathed sword at his hip are well oiled and

in good repair. His arrogant grin reveals a missing tooth as

he speaks: Hold, friendsa word with you!

If the characters allow Bellis to continue, he gets straight to

the  point,  advising  them  that  any  gold  theyve  discovered

now  belongs  to  him,  as  does  any  nearby  land  on  which

theyve found gold.

Ruffians (3): hp 12 each.

Bellis: hp 40.

Tactics: Bellis orders his cohorts to attack if the characters

do anything other than agree to his demands. His followers

use their clubs, trying to inflict subdual damage rather than

kill, while Bellis draws his bastard sword and delays until the

battles outcome becomes clearer. If he thinks that his folk

are losing, he flees, heading eventually for Deadsnows, where

he hopes to lose himself in Snowtown.

Development: If Bellis escapes, he nurses a grudge until he

has  avenged  himself  on  the  characters.  He  might  try  to

gather  another  group  of  followers  and  ambush  the  charac-

ters,  steal  the  characters  equipment  or  mounts,  or  spread

evil rumors about the characters activities.

If the heroes capture Bellis and his men without killing any

of them and take them back to town, Captain Mannock will be

more than happy to take up the matter. There isnt a reward

posted for this band of claim jumpers, but Mannock (and Lady

Icespear) will certainly appreciate the heroes involvement.

If Bellis or any of his men are killed and word gets back to

Deadsnows that the PCs are responsible (for example, one of

the ruffians escapes, or the heroes report the incident them-

selves),  Captain  Mannock  confronts  the  heroes  when  they

return to town. The captain wont miss Bellis, but hell cer-

tainly demand an explanation from the party. Depending on

how  the  characters  respond,  Mannock  may  give  them  a

couple of days jail time for unruly behavior, imprison them

and  remand  the  matter  to  Lady  Icespear,  or  quietly  repri-

mand the party for taking the law into their own hands.

D. THE FORK ROAD (EL 6)

Deadsnows lies twelve miles southwest of the Fork. From the

Fork,  an  old,  paved  road  leads  west  to  Sundabar,  while  an-

other heads north toward Citadel Adbar. These are old dwarf-

roads dating back to Delzoun, more than a thousand years

ago, and despite their age theyre still in good repair. Pave-

stones are cracked, and deep ruts make the road hard to walk

in  places,  but  the  Fork  Road  still  serves  as  the  main  thor-

oughfare in the area.

Five  miles  west  of  the  Wildlands  Rest,  a  cart  trackthe

Deadsnows  roadsplits  off  from  the  Fork  Road  and  winds

south for almost ten miles, climbing up through the foothills

of the mountains. Ugreth, leader of the orc party at the orc en-

campment (see below), has sent his two pet worgs to harry any

travelers hazarding the trek from the town to the old road. The

worgs patrol the lower reaches of the Deadsnows road, down

near the place where the trail meets the Fork Road itself.

The Blood Stalkers

Prince Ugreth, leader of the orcs in the encampment over-

looking  Deadsnows,  brought  along  Blackfang  and  Blood-

jaws, his favorite pair of hunting worgs, to help him scout

146

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:41 PM  Page 147

Adventures in the North

the territory. Ugreth raised the savage magical beasts from

pups, and the years of training he has invested in them have

paid  off  handsomelythe  creatures  are  intensely  loyal  to

their master and accept commands only from him. When he

does not specifically require them, the orc leader turns the

worgs loose to roam as they will. He expects them to support

his  goals  for  the  Deadsnows  area  by  harassing  and  killing

folk traveling on the Fork Road, a task that the worgs pursue

with diabolical glee. Though the fact is not yet widely known

in  the  village,  more  than  a  few  would-be  prospectors  have

never reached their destination.

When  the  heroes  first  traveled  up  the  Deadsnows  road,

the worgs were back in Ugreths camp, reporting their latest

deeds to the orc leader. They return to their hunting grounds

later that night and resume harrying travelers, coming back

to report to Ugreth every three to four days.

When the characters pass this way again (either because

they have learned that folk have been wounded and killed in

the vicinity, or because they are heading for the Fork Road

on other business), the worgs pick up their scent and target

Trip (Ex): A worg that hits with a bite attack can attempt

to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch

attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt

fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the worg.

Blackfang  and  Bloodjaws  are  worgs  of  unusual  size  and

strength (advanced to 7 Hit Dice and Large size).

Tactics: The worgs prefer to stalk their victims, relying on

quiet movement and keen senses to track prey through the

rugged terrain. They prefer to target individuals rather than

groups, and they shadow travelers for miles while watching

to identify the one that appears to be the weakest. If possible,

the pair then waits until nightfall, preferably when the party

is resting, to attack their chosen prey. If they are able, they

will  trip  their  prey  and  drag  it  off  to  devour  it  (possibly

killing it later).

If  forced  to  flee,  the  worgs  attempt  to  improve  their

chances of hiding from pursuers by using natural terrain for

concealment.

Development: If one of the worgs is slain, the other leads

Ugreth to the corpse. If both worgs fall in combat, Ugreth

will at first presume them merely overdue and will not begin

searching  for  them  until  two  nights  have  passed.  At  that

point he will detail three of his warriors to locate the crea-

tures,  ordering  them  to  search  the  worgs  hunting  grounds

for evidence of his pets. Unless the characters took steps to

hide the bodies, the searchers discover them 1d4+2 days after

they begin looking. Once Ugreth discovers that someone has

killed one or both of his worgs, he will swear vengeance and

Bellis and his gang

Adventures in the North

lose no time in trying to track down the filthy murderers.

The  worgs  have  not  been  very  careful  about  concealing

their  comings  and  goings,  and  can  be  tracked  to  Ugreths

camp (Wilderness Lore check, DC 14, check once per mile).

The orc encampment is about ten miles from the spot of the

worgs ambush.

The Orc Encampment

Ugreth  the  orc  is  a  son  of  King  Obould  Many-Arrows  and

styles  himself  a  prince.  He  and  his  followers  have  made

themselves comfortable in this semipermanent encampment

located high in the crags above Deadsnows (location E on the

map of the Deadsnows area). Theyve made good use of some

natural limestone caverns situated close to one of the numer-

ous  mountain-fed  streams  that  crisscross  the  Nether  range.

From this base they occupy themselves with scouting the ter-

ritory around Deadsnows, noting the lay of the land, key de-

fensive features, and other important locations nearby.

Ugreth  was  surprised  to  find  the  town  filled  with  eager

prospectors and has been trying to decide what to do next. He

instructed the orc scouts to make their reconnaissance as his

father ordered, and they are doing so with as much speed and

efficiency  as  they  can.  Naturally,  Ugreth  has  been  trying  to

find some way to turn this unexpected situation to his advan-

tage. As much as he would like to seize control of the gold fields

for himself (the possibility of such wealth is no more easy for

an orc to resist than for a human or dwarf), he lacks sufficient

numbers to pull off such a coup. Instead, Ugreth is looking for

a chance to seize as much gold as he can in one quick raid and

then withdraw back to the safety of the Spine of the World.

The  orcs  assigned  to  Ugreths  company  are  uneasy  with

their commanders determination to wait for the best oppor-

tunity, but so far none of them have worked up the courage

to question King Oboulds son. If things get out of hand, they

might consider seizing Ugreth, binding him, and carting him

back to his father for his own good, but the situation would

have to deteriorate considerably for any of them to contem-

plate this drastic act. None of the orcs relish the idea of be-

coming the focus of their kings anger, even to save their own

hides. For now, the orcs follow their commanders orders, pa-

trolling  carefully,  dodging  prospectors,  watching  the  gold

rush progress, and making ready for a quick and savage raid.

FINDING THE ORC ENCAMPMENT

Unless  the  characters  know  exactly  where  the  orcs  are

hiding,  locating  the  encampment  is  a  matter  of  chance  or

good investigation. Its a five-hour march from Deadsnows

to the caves by the shortest route, but that presumes that the

characters  know  exactly  where  they  are  going  (perhaps  be-

cause they followed up on a rumor they heard in Deadsnows).

The  vertical  ascent  is  roughly  3,000  feet.  There  are  four

basic  ways  to  find  the  camp:  track  the  worgs,  find  an  orc

patrol, search for signs, or blind luck.

Adventures in the North

Track  the  Worgs:  Blackfang  and  Bloodjaws  travel  back

and forth between the camp and the region of the Fork Road

once  every  day  or  two.  Heroes  who  encounter  the  worgs

down by the Fork Road may be able to track them back to

the camp (see The Blood Stalkers, above).

Orc Patrols: Ugreths patrols roam the area near his camp

(see  Patrols,  below).  While  the  characters  are  within  this

area, they may run into Ugreths scouts. The heroes may be

able to capture a patrolling orc and exact the camps location

from  their  prisoner,  or  they  might  track  the  orcs  back  to

their lair (Wilderness Lore DC 15).

Search  for  Signs:  If  the  characters  make  a  deliberate

effort to search for signs of orcs while within one mile of the

camp,  allow  a  Search  check  (or  Wilderness  Lore  check)

against DC 30 to find tracks in the area. The orcs have cov-

ered most of the ground around their lair in the course of

their patrols, and old, faint trails (Wilderness Lore DC 25)

meander back to their encampment.

Blind Luck: If the party passes within one-half mile of the

encampment  in  the  process  of  wandering  around  the  region,

they may happen upon the camp through chance. Allow the

characters a Spot check (DC 25) to note the odd-looking rock

outcropping through the trees when they come within one-half

mile. If they come within 300 feet, allow a second Spot check

(DC 10). If the characters dont notice the rock outcropping,

they wander past without finding the camp unless they happen

to proceed into the area shown in the map of the encampment.

PATROLS (EL 1)

During the day, the orcs remain in the caves, but they send

out two orc soldiers to patrol the vicinity in case any prospec-

tors  get  too  close.  These  scouts  roam  in  an  irregular  circle

within a mile or so of the encampment for two hours before

returning to send out their replacements.

For every hour that the characters spend within 1 mile of

the caves, they have a 10% chance of encountering a patrol.

If  an  encounter  is  indicated,  have  the  characters  and  orcs

make  Spot  checks  as  described  in  Encounter  Distance  in

Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs Guide. The terrain in

this area is light forest.

If you determine that this encounter takes place at night,

or  in  inclement  weather,  modify  the  spotting  distance  and

skill checks as appropriate.

Remember that the orcs take a 1 penalty on their attack

rolls in bright sunlight. The orcs should be treated as hostile

for  the  purposes  of  determining  their  reaction.  Their  first

goal is to hide the evidence of their presence, and that means

making sure that the characters dont live to tell about the

Stolen Gold

The  orcs  following  Ugreth  are  somewhat  wealthy,  as

orcs go. Since they have murdered and stolen from sev-

eral  unlucky  prospectors  in  the  area,  each  orc  carries

gold dust worth 4d4 gp each in a small purse.

encounter.  Both  orcs  have  their  crossbows  out  and  loaded

when the encounter begins. If one orc dies and the other has

the  opportunity  to  escape,  he  will  do  so,  trying  to  find  a

hiding  place  in  the  wilderness  where  he  can  hole  up  until

dark. If he is successful in this effort, he then attempts to

make his way back to the encampment to warn the others.

Orc (1): hp 4.

Orc Veteran (1): hp 11. See below.

1. STREAM

The characters may also come across this site unintentionally

by following the course of this particular stream. When they

first arrive at the stream, read or paraphrase the following in-

formation to the players.

A swift, narrow stream, no more than 4 feet across at its

widest  point,  winds  up  through  light  pine  forest  and

moss-covered boulders toward a large rocky outcropping.

Its rushing water fills the dell with sound.

The  stream  is  quite  shallow,  averaging  1  foot  deep.  The

sound of the constant flow of the stream causes a 2 penalty

on all Listen checks that are made within 40 feet of it.

There is no trail near the stream, but the ascent up the

slope can be made without undue difficulty nonetheless. The

terrain alternates between relatively open, rocky patches of

ground  dotted  with  small  boulders,  and  stands  of  sturdy

mountain pines.

2. THE APPROACH (EL 3)

The orcs have done what they can to conceal their presence,

including trying to walk on rocky ground as much as possible

(to reduce the possibility of leaving tracks that enemies can

follow).  When  approaching  the  cave,  they  walk  along  the

streambed to take advantage of the fact that doing so leaves

no trail.

A  blind  constructed  from  convenient  foliage  screens  the

cave mouth at area 4. Characters in this area who study the

area are entitled to a Spot check (DC 15) to notice the blind.

A check result of 25 or higher spots the sentry hiding behind

the blind, too. The sentry in area 4 waits until they are within

30 feet of his position to activate the trap described there.

The orcs have rigged several crude snare traps in this area.

These traps are activated when anyone crosses over a square

on the map marked with a T.

Snare Trap (5-foot diameter concealed net): CR 3; anyone

caught in the net is suspended 5 feet above the ground and

pinned; Reflex save (DC 20) avoids; Strength check (DC 25)

to tear free; Escape Artist check (DC 26) to slip free; Search

check (DC 24); Disable Device (DC 15).

Sentries:  There  are  two  orcs  on  sentry  duty  at  all  times

when the squad is in residence. Both are marked S on the map.

One sits about 20 feet off the ground in the limbs of a big

pine  overlooking  the  stream,  and  one  hides  behind  a  con-

structed screen of dense foliage in the cave mouth. The screen

adds +10 to the orc sentrys Hide check when he is behind it.

Detecting the sentry that is hiding in the fir tree is more dif-

ficult; the thick pine boughs add +15 to this orcs Hide check.

149

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:42 PM  Page 150

Adventures in the North

Orcs (2): hp 4 each. Battleaxe, light crossbow.

Tactics: The sentry behind the screen has orders to activate

the log trap if any potentially hostile creatures come within

30  feet  of  the  cave  mouth  (see  area  3).  The  tree  sentrys

orders are to wait for his fellow sentry to activate the log trap

before shooting intruders with his crossbow. He also shoots at

anyone  caught  in  one  of  the  snare  traps.  If  he  spots  an  in-

truder, he waits for the log trap to come into play; if the in-

truder he spots gets within 10 feet of the cave mouth without

the  log  trap  activating,  he  assumes  that  the  other  sentry

hasnt spotted the intruder and opens fire with his crossbow.

3. THE BLIND (EL 3)

Once the characters are within 30 feet of the cave mouth,

the screen becomes obvious. Read or paraphrase the follow-

ing information to the players.

A simple screen of pine boughs and foliage lashed to a

wooden frame conceals a cave mouth from casual obser-

vation. The cave leads back into the mountain looming

over the glen.

The  screen  is  not  intended  to  be  a  real  obstacle.  It  only

weighs about 50 pounds and can be moved aside with a move-

equivalent  action.  One  of  the  sentries  described  in  area  2

lurks  here  behind  the  screen,  ready  to  engage  intruders  or

call out a warning to his fellows.

Orc: hp 4. Battleaxe, light crossbow.

Tactics: If the sentry in the blind did not engage the char-

acters  in  area  2,  he  fights  here.  (If  the  characters  have  al-

ready  defeated  him,  ignore  this  encounter.)  He  waits  until

the heroes approach within 30 feet and triggers a rolling log

trap by kicking a couple of prepositioned logs down the slope

leading to the cave mouth.

Rolling  Log  Trap  (10-foot-long  log): CR  3;  +10  ranged

touch  attack;  3d8  points  of  damage;  Reflex  saving  throw

(DC 20) negates; Search (DC 25); Disable Device (DC 15).

The log also serves as a warning system for the encampment.

A pair of metal canteens is attached to either end of both logs;

when the log rolls, the canteens make a loud clatter. The noise is

sufficient to alert any orcs inside the caves that trouble is coming.

4. ENTRY TUNNEL (EL 6)

The  cave  mouth  opens  up  into  a  narrow  limestone  tunnel

that  wends  its  way  back  into  the  mountainside.  The  tunnel

ceiling is just under 8 feet tall, and it is no more than 6 feet

wide  at  its  widest  point.  The  walls  are  slick  and  damp,  and

trickling rivulets of water streak the walls. The air in the cave

carries a heavy animal odor, not unlike that of a wet hound.

If the sentries have raised the alarm, characters entering

the tunnel must fight their way past the remaining orc sol-

diers. Otherwise this passage is safe.

Tactics: If the orcs in area 5 are alerted to defend this pas-

sage,  take  note  that  the  tunnel  is  so  narrow  that  there  is

room  enough  for  creatures  to  pass  through  only  in  single

file. The orcs give battle to any intruders while Ugreth dons

his armor and readies himself.

5. SLEEPING CAVE (EL 6)

The floor of this large limestone cave is littered with piles of

smelly, ragged animal furs. The odor of the furs is not im-

proved by the general dampness of the cave walls and floor. A

cylindrical section cut from a big tree serves as a makeshift

table, and on its surface is a mound of meatless animal bones,

leather  drinking  jacks,  and  other  personal  effects.  Stacked

against the far wall are a few bulging cloth sacks and a short

wooden barrel. Another tunnel exits this cavern not far from

the entry passageway. To the north, a narrow crevice twists

upward through the rock, slick with water.

During  daylight  hours,  all  the  orcs  except  for  those  on

sentry duty and those on patrol are here, sheltering from the

sunlight. At night, the two sentries in area 2 remain on duty,

while the rest of the small company slips out to reconnoiter

the territory.

Orcs (6): hp 4 each.

Orc Veterans (4): hp 11 each. See below.

Tactics:  Orcs  forced  to  retreat  from  the  entry  tunnel

make  their  stand  here,  defending  the  entrance  to  their

leaders cave. If faced with only one or two skilled assailants,

the orcs may suddenly give way to draw them into the open

space of area 5 and then surround their foes to gain flanking

attacks or attempt a mass grapple.

If all seems lost, the orcs attempt to escape through the

crevice  in  the  north  wall.  This  is  a  tight  squeeze  (Escape

Artist DC 10) and a scramble of a climb (Climb DC 10), and

leads  up  through  about  25  feet  to  a  small  opening  on  the

north face of the tor.

6. UGRETHS CHAMBER (EL 47)

This natural limestone cave is smaller than the orcs sleeping

quarters, and drier as well. A pile of animal skins, topped by

the skin of a very large weasel, lies in the southern corner of

the chamber. Another section of tree sits on this cave floor,

and  atop  it  is  stretched  a  broad  animal  skin  covered  with

what appear to be crude sketches and markings.

The son of King Obould Many-Arrows rates a private cavern

all to himself, and hes made himself at home here among what

little comforts he brought along with the expedition.

If  the  characters  fought  Blackfang  and  Bloodjaws  and

drove them off, the two worgs are here, laying low as they

recover. If the characters havent encountered the worgs yet,

there  is  a  20%  chance  that  the  two  are  here  at  any  given

time (which makes this a much tougher encounter).

Ugreth: hp 27. See below.

Blackfang and Bloodjaws: hp 71, 59. See The Blood Stalk-

ers, earlier in this chapter.

Tactics: Prince Ugreth fights ferociously to keep himself

from being captured, beginning his rage when the charac-

ters enter his chamber. He asks for no quarter and refuses

to surrender if offered the option. If he has sufficient time,

he  consumes  his  potion  of  heroism before  the  fight  starts.

He knows too much about his fathers plans to fall into the

hands of enemies. If he cannot avoid capture, he will do his

utmost  to  provoke  his  captors  into  executing  him.  He

knows that his father will pay no ransom, and even if he

managed  to  escape,  King  Obould  might  execute  him

anyway for failing his mission. Certainly he would lose im-

mense  amounts  of  respect  among  his  brothers  and  the

other orcs of the army. Death seems preferable to that kind

of humiliation.

Treasure: Ugreths band came to Deadsnows to scout, not

pillage. They have accumulated a small amount of loot de-

spite orders to the contrary. Two wooden chests in this room

hold  855  sp,  315  gp,  and  twenty  beaver  pelts  worth  5  gp

apiece. The dire weasel pelt Ugreth sleeps on is worth 40 gp.

Development: If the characters capture Ugreth, they have

accomplished something of significance. If the orc scouts are

still  at  large,  they  return  home  immediately  and  inform

King  Obould  that  his  son  is  captured.  This  might  be  the

event  that  precipitates  Oboulds  attack  on  the  Silver

Marches.  Or,  if  the  orc  king  chooses  to  bide  his  time,  he

might  hire  mercenaries  to  free  his  son,  send  assassins  to

murder him in his captivity before Ugreth can divulge any

valuable secrets, or even send a company of soldiers to oblit-

erate Deadsnows in retribution.

Adventures in the North

The Well of Darkness

Jadylyn  Darvea  is  a  young  and  ambitious  priestess  in  the

service  of  Shar.  At  the  bidding  of  the  Mistress  of  the

Night, revealed to Jadylyn in a dream, the young cleric es-

tablished an outpost of her dark and secretive faith. Jady-

lyn is charged with converting an old dwarf mine (location

F on the map of the Deadsnows area) into a suitable shrine

to the Dark Goddess, a task she is undertaking with relish.

Accompanying  Jadylyn  are  four  acolytes,  novices  in  the

service of their deity. The acolytes are Jadylyns devoted ser-

vants; they see her as the voice of their deity and would sacri-

fice their lives if she ordered it.

The temple is located within abandoned dwarf-mines (the

Ironhand Mines) that were started some four hundred years

ago but never completed. Orc raiders, lusting for blood and

treasure, attacked the mine works before the builders had an

opportunity to complete more than the initial delvings. The

defenders made a valiant stand, but all were killed under the

murderous onslaught of the hordes sheer numbers.

The Ironhand Mines are not particularly well known in

Deadsnows, but theyve had a reputation for years as a place

often  haunted  by  dreadful  monsters.  Kerrilla  Gemstar,

leader  of  the  Hospice  of  Marthammor,  knows  that  the

prospector  Bromgart  Ironhand  met  a  bad  end  in  the  old

mines,  and  when  the  player  characters  ask  her  for  help  or

offer their services, shell point them toward the mines.

If  the  heroes  obtain  directions  from  Kerrilla  (or  any

longterm resident of Deadsnows, for that matter), they can

find  the  Ironhand  Mines  without  much  trouble.  They

might also find the mine by stumbling across the cart track

leading from the mines to the Fork Road and following the

trail up into the foothills of the Rauvin Mountains.

APPROACHING THE MINE

A forgotten old cart track leads from the Fork Road to the

Ironhand Mines, winding through steep hills and deep forests.

Searching the cart road for tracks (Wilderness Lore DC 14)

reveals  signs  of  occasional  passage  by  creatures  of  various

types,  including  at  least  one  mule,  several  Medium-size  hu-

manoids, and several Large humanoids. If the character exam-

ining the trail achieves a check result of 24 or better, she can

discern that one set of tracks heading back toward the Fork

Road  was  probably  made  by  a  badly  injured  humanoid  who

stumbled and fell often, crawling part of the way (these tracks

were made by the dwarf prospector as he fled the Well).

When the heroes approach the mine, read or paraphrase

the following information to the players.

The cart track ends in an overgrown clearing, surrounded

by a handful of long-ruined wooden outbuildings that are

nothing more than empty shells now. A steep hillside rises

immediately  to  the  north.  From  the  clearing  a  broad

earthen  ramp  surfaced  with  rotting  logs  leads  up  to  a

mine entrance, cut into the side of the hill. The entrance

is little more than a square hole cut into the hillside, visi-

ble above the tree line from a distance of about 200 yards.

There  is  nothing  of  interest  in  the  old  outbuildings.  Hun-

dreds  of  years  ago  these  were  bunkhouses,  smelters,  and

workshops  for  the  mines.  Characters  scouting  around  the

mine entrance or setting up to watch the black hole in the

rock wont find much, eitherthe temple guards do not gen-

erally  venture  outside  the  entrance,  obeying  their  leaders

orders to keep a low profile.

There  are  no  easily  discernible  tracks  in  the  immediate

vicinity  of  the  mine  entrance,  since  the  ground  is  too  hard

and rocky to hold most prints. However, a character with the

Track feat can discern (Wilderness Lore DC 19) more of the

mixed tracks in the vicinity of the clearing, coming and going

from the mine entrance. These tracks are two to five days old.

ENTERING THE MINE

The mine entrance is a wide, low hole, 20 feet wide and 10

feet high, cut into the hillside 50 feet above its base. The ap-

proach is not difficult, thanks to a gently sloping ramp that

the original builders created to ease the way for heavy supply

carts. The ramp levels off at its apex, forming a platform 20

feet  long  and  10  feet  wide  that  forms  a  threshold  to  the

mines doorway. Once the characters reach this point, read or

paraphrase the following information to the players.

Before you stands a wide opening cut into the very rock

of the hillside. A thick stone frame constructed of three

granite  slabs,  their  seams  joined  without  mortar,  sur-

rounds the entrance on three sides (left, right, and top). A

faint  odor  of  stale  air  and  rot  wafts  outward  from  the

shadowed interior.

Mine Features

The rooms and passages of the mines share the follow-

ing  features,  unless  otherwise  noted  in  a  specific  area

description. First, passages and chambers are only 5 feet

high; intruders 5 feet tall or taller must stoop, and take

a  2  circumstance  penalty  on  attack  rolls  while  fight-

ing  in  such  cramped  quarters.  The  humans  inhabiting

the complex are used to the low ceilings and do not take

this penalty.

Second, most of the rooms are completely without light.

A  character  without  darkvision  requires  a  light  source  in

order  to  see.  Finally,  the  mines  are  unusually  cold  and

dampthe temperature hovers around 40 F (cold condi-

tions, as described in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTERs

Guide). Characters without warm clothing may be subject

to cold and exposure damage if they spend a great deal of

time in the mines.

Adventures in the North

Twin  supports  made  from  granite  blocks  line  the  tunnel

beyond, marching off into the darkness beyond. The passage

beyond the threshold is 20 feet wide and 10 feet high. The

tunnel widens 80 feet beyond the threshold. When the char-

acters reach this point . . .

The passageway widens abruptly, forming a large square

chamber.  A  dry,  cool  breeze  moves  slowly  across  your

skin as you approach, carrying with it the same stench

of rot that you detected on the threshold. The chamber

is carved from the guts of the hillside, its walls, floor,

and ceiling worked carefully from natural stone. In the

center of the chamber floor, a square of blackness gapes

wide  like  a  hungry  mouth.  Two  taut  lengths  of  rusted

chain  trail  down  into  darkness  from  iron  drums  that

flank the opening. The winches, each taller than a man

can  reach,  appear  to  be  frozen  in  place  by  decades  of

rust. Beyond the shaft and machinery, the room extends

a few dozen paces more into the hillside before ending in

a vast wall of rubble and debris.

The rusty machinery comprises a simple lift device that per-

mits  easy  access  between  this  entry  cavern  and  the  mines

below. A wooden platform and a pair of counterweights are

suspended  in  the  shaft  by  chains  wound  about  the  winch

drums. While the winches look rusted and inoperable at first

glance,  any  serious  scrutiny  (a  Search  check  around  the

drums,  or  any  attempt  to  rotate  the  drums)  reveals  that

most of the rust is simply rust flake sprinkled over thick

black greasethe winches work fine.

Jadylyn  and  her  followers  deliberately  leave  the  entry

cavern empty, so that casual visitors wont find anything to

provoke more thorough investigations of the old mines.

THE DESCENT

The distance between the top of the shaft and the floor of

the cavern at the bottom of the shaft (area 1) is about 200

feet. The characters will have to fly, climb down, or use the

lift to continue. The lift platform is currently at the bottom

of the shaft. The platform can be raised or lowered from the

winches  at  the  top  or  the  bottom  of  the  shaft  (Strength

check  DC  10)  or  by  hauling  on  the  counterweight  chain

while  standing  on  the  platform  itself  (Strength  check  DC

15). One full round of hauling raises the platform 10 feet or

lowers it 20 feet, or twice these distances if both winches or

chains  are  operated  at  the  same  time.  Operating  the  lift

makes an awful racket, which can be heard by all creatures in

areas 1 through 7 below.

To deter intruders, Jadylyn has placed a glyph of warding

on  the  wall  of  the  shaft  approximately  10  feet  above  the

point at which it meets the roof of the cavern below (and so

40 feet above the floor of area 1). The glyph is triggered by

the  passage  of  any  nonevil  creature.  The  noise  of  the  ex-

ploding glyph is loud enough to alert everyone within areas

1 to 5 of the complex.

Glyph of Warding: CR 3; 5-ft. acid blast (3d8); Reflex half

(DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

1. ENTRANCE TO THE MINES

The  chamber  at  the  bottom  of  the  shaft  is  a  natural

cavern that has obviously been enlarged at some point.

The stench of rot is even stronger down here, and the air

is very cold and damp. Three worked stone tunnels exit

the  chamber  in  different  directions.  Two  large  winch-

drums like the ones in the mine mouth above stand be-

neath the shaft, chains leading up into the darkness. A

wooden platform is secured to the chains, a lift device

now resting at the bottom of the shaft.

The  only  other  object  of  immediate  interest  here  is

the  pair  of  rusting  iron  rails  that  begin  in  the  rough

center  of  the  cavern  floor,  and  lead  out  of  the  cave

through  one  of  the  tunnels.  The  rails  rest  on  rotting

wooden ties, which are in turn secured to the stone floor

with large, rusted spikes.

This  chamber  is  30  feet  high.  If  the  inhabitants  are

alerted  to  the  presence  of  intruders  by  the  sound  of  the

glyph detonating (see The Descent), the zombies in area 2

come out to attack intruders. The Sharrans in area 5 are

on  their  way  and  will  arrive  in  5  rounds.  Otherwise,  the

room is uninhabited.

Development:  If  the  heroes  raid  the  complex  and  leave,

this room will be garrisoned against their return by one of

the acolytes from area 5 and four Medium-size zombies, cre-

ated from the store of corpses in area 3.

2. OGRE ZOMBIES (EL 3)

The  disgusting  smell  of  rot  and  decay  is  very  nearly

overpowering  here:  It  seems  to  be  a  part  of  the  very

stone itself. Standing motionless in the darkness are two

hulking figures.

The ceiling in this chamber is 20 feet high. A pair of Large

zombies (slain ogres that Jadylyn animated) wait patiently in

this room for intruders to enter or pass by. They attack any

creature that isnt accompanied by a resident of the complex.

Large Zombies (2): hp 33 each.

These two zombies were animated with the area of a dese-

crate effect in area 4, and therefore have +1 hit point per Hit

Die (reflected in the hp totals above).

3. ZOMBIES-TO-BE

The cloying smell of rot is so thick near this cave that it

seems  to  have  become  a  part  of  the  stone  itself.  The

source  of  the  stench  is  plain  to  see.  Decomposing

corpseshuman, ogre, orc, and dwarf, their limbs tan-

gled  like  a  grisly  game  of  jackstrawsare  piled  care-

lessly on the floor.

Here is where the Shar worshipers callously toss the bodies

that will eventually become their undead servants. None of

the corpses have anything valuable remaining on their per-

sons, though most are still clad in the bloodied remnants of

armor and clothing. A cursory examination reveals that all

of these unfortunates died through violent means. There are

six human, two ogre, five orc, and three dwarf corpses here.

The humans include a party of craftsmen traveling from

Sundabar  to  Deadsnows  and  two  merchants  bound  for

Citadel Adbar. Both were set upon and captured by the Shar-

rans  several  tendays  ago.  The  dwarves  were  companions  of

Bromgart Ironhand, who did not escape the mines.

4. CHAMBER OF UNDEATH

The  flickering  yellow  light  of  candles  illuminates  a

small portion of this irregularly shaped cavern. There is

no one present, but the grisly apparatus stored in this

chamber  leaves  little  doubt  as  to  what  occurs  here.  A

flat  slab  situated  on  the  floor  near  the  center  of  the

cave  holds  a  decaying  human  body  clad  in  dirty  rags,

awaiting the rites that will make it rise again to become

one of the walking dead.

.The ceiling in this chamber is 15 feet high. Jadylyn usually

casts desecrate in this chamber before animating any corpses

in order to strengthen her unholy minions.

5. WATCH CAVERN (EL 5)

This cave is apparently being used to store a number of

items. Stacked and piled around the floor space are coils

of hemp and silk rope, pickaxes, spades and shovels, bun-

dles of torches, some lanterns, hand saws, and a quantity

of long timbers used for shoring up tunnels and ceilings.

Its also being used as a sleeping chamber; three rough

pallets are arranged on the floor amid all the equipment.

Two Dark Moon monks (Andar and Nomis) and an acolyte

of Shar (Fennon) guard this room. Their assignment is to

make sure that intruders in area 1 are driven off or slain

preferably slain, since that would prevent tales of the Shar-

rans presence from getting back to civilization.

Dark Moon Brothers (2): hp 11 each.

Sharran Acolyte: hp 16.

Tactics: If alerted by the exploding glyph in the vertical

shaft (see The Descent), the Sharrans take 3 rounds to make

ready for battle and then rush to the fight. First they douse

most  of  the  candles  so  that  the  telltale  light  will  not  give

them  away.  Then  Andar  and  Nomis  drink  their  potions,

while Fennon the acolyte casts shield of faith and reads his

scroll of magic weapon or scroll of bulls strength.

If the characters have already left area 1 by the time the

Sharrans arrive, the trio gives chase through the mines. In

battle,  Fennon  casts  darkness  early  on,  so  that  the  monks

can take advantage of their Blind-Fight feat against intrud-

ers who may not be as skilled at fighting in the dark.

Treasure: The common goods stored in this chamber include

154

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:42 PM  Page 155

Adventures in the North

ten  50-foot  coils  of  hemp  rope,  four  50-foot  coils  of  silk

rope,  ten  picks,  ten  spades,  fifty  torches,  five  hooded

lanterns,  twenty  flasks  of  oil,  and  a  small  locked  coffer

(Open Lock DC 20) with 360 sp and 150 gp.

6. PRIVY

These small chambers are built over rough-hewn oubliettes,

about 20 feet deep and 10 feet square. Privies are located near

the  watch  chamber,  the  acolytes  quarters,  and  Jadylyns

chambers.

7. GUEST CHAMBER (EL 6)

The iron rails end in this large, spacious cave. The walls

here bear the distinct marks of having been worked with

tools. A pile of rusting pickaxes, spades, and lengths of

chain gathers dust against the cavern wall opposite the

tunnel mouth. The air here is stale and acrid. The ceiling

rises to a narrow point perhaps 30 feet overhead.

The kir-lanan emissary Kzntharris currently resides in this

chamber. He sees any intrusion by godslaves as a golden op-

portunity  to  carry  out  his  races  principal  mission,  and  to

demonstrate to the church of Shar exactly what his folk are

capable of when they put their mind to it.

The  creatures  mission  here  is  to  decide  for  himself

whether  the  church  of  Shar,  alone  among  the  faiths  of

Faern,  is  a  suitable  ally  for  his  people.  Kzntharriss  word

carries  a  great  deal  of  influence  among  his  kind.  Because

Shars clergy make war on all other faiths and are opposed to

nearly everyone else in Faern, they might make useful part-

ners in the kir-lanans battle to bring low the worshipers of

all the deities of the world.

Kzntharris: hp 48.

Tactics: If the characters have announced their presence

in the complex through fighting with the undead near the

entrance shaft, Kzntharris will be prepared for enemies. He

flies  to  a  rocky  perch  above  the  tunnels  mouth  and  waits.

From this vantage point he can sneak attack (if he wins sur-

prise) or begin the fight by enfeebling the most dangerous-

looking opponent. Kzntharris uses the reach of his longspear

and his Flyby Attack feat to attack ground-bound foes with-

out coming within reach of their melee weapons.

If injured badly, Kzntharris attempts to use his negative

energy  touch  to  regain  some  hit  points  and  hurt  his  foes.

When he loses more than three-quarters of his full normal

hit points, he makes escape his primary goal, using his potion

of invisibility. If he gets away, he flies off and does not return.

Secret Door: There is a secret door on the northern wall

of the cavern, right in front of the pile of chains and digging

tools  (Search  check  DC  20  to  locate).  Jadylyn  and  her

acolytes havent discovered it yet, nor has the kir-lanan.

8. SECRET TUNNEL (EL 4)

The  slablike  stone  door  slides  upward  into  the  wall  to

reveal a tiny room, no more than 10 feet square. On the

far wall, an iron door leads toward unknown places.

This room was once merely the entryway to a chamber that

in  turn  became  the  junction  between  other  tunnels.  It  was

concealed by a secret door by the original builders, who did

not  wish  uninvited  guests  to  enter  their  lower  halls.  The

room and tunnels beyond have long since collapsed, creating

a dangerous situationopening the iron door releases a cas-

cade of rock into the entry chamber.

Rockslide: The bury zone for the rockslide is the entry

chamber  itself.  Creatures  standing  within  it  take  5d6

points of damage (Reflex DC 15 half). Those that fail this

save are pinned. The slide zone is the area 10 feet immedi-

ately outside the secret door. Ccreatures in this area take

2d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 15 half). Those that fail

this save are pinned.

Pinned characters take 1d6 points of subdual damage per

minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious,

he or she must make a Constitution check (DC 15) or take

1d6 points of normal damage each minute thereafter until

freed or dead.

9. ZOMBIE SENTRIES (EL 3)

This spacious cave is almost 20 feet high. The walls of

this cave have been hewn and worked to create dozens of

spiky rock formations that protrude several feet from

the  stone.  There  are  two  figures  within,  both  standing

well  above  the  height  of  a  full-grown  human.  The  air

reeks of death.

Two more zombies, once ogres, have been ordered to attack

anyone entering the cavern who is not either a member of

Shars clergy or accompanied by one of them. Like the zom-

bies in area 2, these were created in the area of a desecrate

spell and are tougher then normal.

Large Zombies (2): hp 33 each.

Tactics: On their first action in a fight the zombies exe-

cute a partial charge. After the first round, the zombies have

been ordered to shove intruders against the jagged spikes on

the  wall.  They  attempt  to  bull  rush  opponents  and  carry

them into the walls; striking the walls in this manner exposes

a character to 1d4 spike attacks at a +10 attack bonus. Each

spike that hits deals 1d4+2 points of damage each. The zom-

bies are also vulnerable to the spikes, should the characters

decide to turn their own tactics against them.

10. POOL OF THE BLACK BEAST (EL 10)

The iron rails plunge straight into the unknown depths

of  a  wide,  dark  pool  of  water  as  if  swallowed  by  the

liquid. They emerge again on the other side and continue

on  their  route  through  a  tunnel.  The  cavern  in  which

the pool sits is wide, but only a small portion of it is not

submerged. A narrow ledge circles the pool to the north.

The ceiling of this cave is more than 20 feet overhead.

Nothing stirs the surface of the water.

The contour markings on the map indicate 5-foot changes

in the pools depth, starting at 10 feet deep at its edge and

155

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:42 PM  Page 156

Adventures in the North

increasing to 20 feet deep at its center. Fed by deep springs,

the pool always remains full and icy cold.

The  pool  is  home  to  a  grotesque,  malevolent  creature

known to the Sharrans as the black beast. It is a creature born

of Shars evil cunning and dark powers and sent to Faern to

serve her will. The beast lurks still and silent under the sur-

face of the pool until it is called for by Jadylyn, a sacrifice is

thrown into the water, or intruders enter the chamber.

The black beasts blindsight allows it to detect any creatures

in this cavern. It moves toward intruders beneath the waters

surface, heading for the point at the pools edge closest to the

characters. Characters keeping an eye on the pool may make a

Spot check (DC 20) to catch a glimpse of something undulat-

ing along in the shadows and thus avoid being surprised.

Black Beast of Shar: hp 115.

The black beast is a fiendish black pudding with a natural

swim speed instead of a climb speed. Unlike most oozes, it is

capable of discerning between its allies (the Sharrans) and in-

truders. The Sharrans regard the creature as an unholy emis-

sary of Shar, and they sacrifice living captives to it at every

opportunity.

Tactics:  The  black  beast  seeks  to  use  its  improved  grab

ability to grapple and hold whichever character is closest to

the pool. If it establishes a hold, on the next round it moves

back  out  into  the  center  of  the  pool  and  submerges  again,

dragging the grappled character with it. It constricts the hap-

less victim until dead, and then returns to the pools edge to

seize  another  character  and  repeat  the  process.  The  black

beasts grapple check modifier is +16.

Development: If the characters raid the complex and do

not  encounter  the  black  beast,  Jadylyn  moves  the  creature

from here to area 19 to await their return.

11. DESCENT INTO THE UNDERDARK

The  iron  and  wooden  rail  tracks  emerge  from  the

pool  and  continue  onward  through  a  tunnel.  There,

they  continue  to  progress  into  the  earth,  until  they

disappear  beyond  the  range  of  your  available  light

and vision.

The tunnel and tracks extend in the same direction with only

a  few  gentle  turns,  always  headed  generally  eastward,  for

nearly half a mile. Then the tracks end and the tunnel be-

comes  a  large  natural  cavern.  The  walls  and  floor  of  the

cavern are damp with dripping moisture, and from the ceil-

ing and walls grow massive stalactites and stalagmites of var-

ious strange hues. The cavern is the beginning of a series of

caves that lead deeper into the Underdark. The dwarf delvers

of these mines hoped to one day blaze a subterranean trail all

the way to Citadel Adbar or Citadel Felbarr.

12. THE ROUNDABOUT

The  iron  rail  tracks  enter  and  exit  this  circular  cave

through  the  same  tunnel.  Inside  this  area,  the  tracks

make a complete loop around the cavern floor. The walls

here appear to have been worked at one time.

This roundabout was useful for changing the direction of the

mine  carts;  the  miners  intended  to  build  several  others

before they met their end.

13. TUNNEL TO NOWHERE

The tunnel narrows as it curves in a gentle circle, and

slopes  sharply  downward  as  it  curves.  You  can  feel  a

cool,  dry  breeze  on  your  skin  that  grows  stronger  as

you continue.

The tunnel ends abruptly, simply stopping at the edge of a

vertical shaft. The miners discovered the shaft as they were

constructing the tunnel, but did not have the opportunity to

make use of it in the time they had left. The shaft descends

some 400 feet straight down. It is never wider than about 9

feet across during its entire descent. The end of the shaft is

at the roof of a small cavern, some 30 feet in diameter and

with  a  ceiling  height  of  only  5  feet.  Extending  from  the

cavern  are  several  low,  narrow  tunnels  that  lead  into  the

Underdark. It is by this route that Jadylyn will flee, hoping

to lose herself in the caverns below (where she believes her

deity will protect her from discovery) if she cannot get to

the surface.

14. ANTECHAMBER (EL 3)

A broad slab of polished green granite shot with white

veins  rests  atop  four  thick  stone  legs  to  form  a  large

table in the center of this rectangular room. Drawn up

around the table are four rough-hewn stone chairs. Each

of the seats is covered with new-looking mats of woven

straw. The ceiling in here is about 10 feet high. Fastened

to  the  south  wall  with  pitons  is  a  large,  plain  piece  of

dark woolen cloth nearly 6 feet square.

Here  is  where  Jadylyn  meets  with  acolytes  and  any  guests

they may have, such as Kzntharris or the monks of the Dark

Moon.  The  table  and  chairs  are  remnants  of  the  dwarf

mining  operation.  The  Sharrans  found  the  stone  seats  un-

comfortable  and  covered  them  with  some  straw  mats.  The

woolen cloth conceals a glyph of warding meant to deter in-

truders from sneaking around where they shouldnt be. It is

detonated by the removal of the covering cloth.

Glyph of Warding: CR 3; 5-ft. fire blast (3d8); Reflex half

(DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

If the characters have managed to sneak into the complex

without alerting the occupants, the sound of the blast as the

trap explodes will announce their presence clearly to every-

one within areas 12 through 19.

15. ACOLYTES CHAMBER (EL 6)

A handful of feeble candles illuminate this room. Three

austere pallets lie in an orderly row against the southern

wall, and several sacks and barrels are stacked against the

northern  wall.  This  room  is  a  little  more  spacious  than

most of the passages in the mines. The ceiling is about 10

feet overhead.

Three more of Jaydlyns acolytes are quartered in this room.

Duryss, Malthor, and Pirren are so thoroughly indoctrinated

in Sharran dogma that they think of themselves only as ves-

sels for the Dark Goddesss will. For these three, surrender or

retreat is unthinkable.

Sharran Acolytes (3): hp 16 each.

Tactics: If warned of an enemys approach by the detona-

tion of the glyph in area 14, two of the acolytes prepare for

battle  by  casting  shield  of  faith  or  reading  one  of  their

scrolls, and then they advance to area 16 to await intruders.

The third acolyte proceeds directly to area 20 to warn Jady-

lyn that intruders are in the mines.

Treasure: Malthor, one of the acolytes, has some wealth

of his own. Wrapped up in an old, dirty shirt under his pallet

(Search DC 10) is a purse with 15 pp, 80 gp, and 60 sp. The

sacks and barrels are filled with coarse flour and weak ale.

16. DINING AREA

A trestle table in relatively good condition is the only

feature  visible  in  this  rectangular  chamber.  Two  pas-

sages lead south from this room, and one leads east.

The  acolytes,  monks,  and  their  mistress  take  their  meals

here. If the glyph in area 14 is detonated, two of the acolytes

from area 15 come here to await intruders, arriving 5 rounds

after the glyph goes off.

17. KITCHEN

The unmistakable odor of cooked food hangs heavy in

the  air  of  this  oddly  shaped  chamber.  The  room  is  di-

vided into two area by a short wall; one area is slightly

larger  than  the  other.  The  larger  part  of  the  room  is

outfitted with stone shelves and sideboards hewn from

the rock walls and polished smooth. The shelves hold a

half dozen wooden plates and cups. The smaller part is

dominated by a pair of open firepits in the floor that are

currently filled with cold ashes.

This room is used for preparing food for the mines inhabi-

tants. The acolytes do all the cooking; Jadylyn is far too im-

portant and busy to bother with such mundane chores.

18. FOOD STORES

The  scent  of  bacon  and  other  dried  meats  wafts  from

the  entrance  of  this  small  chamber.  The  smooth-hewn

walls  are  hung  with  a  multitude  of  iron  hooks,  from

which dangle numerous cured hams, sides of beef, shanks

of mutton, and slabs of bacon. Stacked around the floor

are  a  number  of  wooden  crates,  rough  cloth  sacks,  and

wooden barrels.

This room is the primary pantry of the Sharran temple. The

wooden  crates  and  cloth  sacks  contain  dry  foodstuffs  (rice,

flour,  beans,  and  the  like).  The  barrels  contain  a  supply  of

weak, watered wine.

19. THE GREAT CHAMBER (EL 4)

A  wall  of  impervious  blackness  looms  before  you.  The

faint sounds and whispers of moving air beyond seem to

hint at a chamber of great size, but no light penetrates

the darkness.

This room is within the area affected by a deeper darkness

spell, cast by Jadylyn every few days to keep the approach to

Shars temple suitably lightless. The darkness is centered on a

large  bronze  brazier,  located  at  the  spot  indicated  on  the

map.  The  brazier  contains  smoldering  coals,  lending  the

whole room a smoky warmth.

Thick,  irregular  pillars  left  here  by  the  dwarves  who

delved these mines support the low ceiling, only 5 feet above

the floor.

Jadylyn and her acolytes routinely navigate this room in

complete  darkness,  and  so  are  familiar  with  its  tricky

layoutthey can find their way from either of the two en-

trance passages to the secret door (see below) with little trou-

ble. If the characters manage to illuminate the room, read or

paraphrase the following information to the players.

This chamber is revealed as a wide, low room about 60

feet on a side, with passages exiting to the north, east,

and south. Seven thick, square pillars support a ceiling

that  is  only  5  feet  above  the  floor.  In  the  southeast

corner  of  the  room,  a  bronze  brazier  smolders  with  a

carefully banked coal fire.

The Black Beast of Shar

157

620_088567_001_EN_Ch8a.qxd  4/26/02  3:42 PM  Page 158

Adventures in the North

The  northwesternmost  pillar,  right  by  the  secret  door,  is

guarded  by  a  glyph  of  warding  triggered  by  the  passage  of

any good creature. The sound of the glyphs detonation is au-

dible in areas 15 through 21.

Glyph  of  Warding:  CR  3;  5-ft.  sonic  blast  (3d8);  Reflex

half (DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

Secret  Door:  In  the  northwest  corner  of  the  room  is  a

secret  door  leading  to  the  Altar  of  Shadows  (area  20)  and

Jadylyns  chambers  (area  21).  The  door  (Search  DC  20)  is

opened with a simple catch-stone, but it can be very difficult

to find in total darkness. Apply a 4 circumstance penalty

on Search checks made by touch alone.

Development: If the deeper darkness is dispelled, Jady-

lyn replaces it as soon as practicable and adds more glyphs

of warding. She also moves the black beast from area 10

to this room; the creature lairs in the collapsed passage to

the north.

20. ALTAR OF SHADOWS (EL 18)

Dozens of black candles barely suffice to illuminate this

large, dark chamber. A circular niche in the western wall

holds an unholy altar, a single slab of black stone that

stands before a dark seal 6 feet acrossa disk of black-

ness  edged  in  purple.  Black  curtains  hide  the  western

wall of the chamber, and two skeletal figures stand side

by side flanking the doorway. The ceiling is enfolded in

darkness 20 feet overhead.

This room is currently under the effect of a desecrate spell

at maximum effect. The temple is austere, as befits the Lady

of  Loss.  Many  of  her  most  profane  rites  are  conducted  in

total  darkness,  as  her  priests  and  worshipers  grovel  on  the

bare stone, seen by none but their dark goddess. The figures

are skeletons under Jadylyns command, formerly dwarves of

the mining complex.

Medium Skeletons (2): hp 7 each.

Jadylyn is in area 21. If she hears fighting in this room,

she quietly skulks down the passage from her chambers and

attacks any intruders from behind, using the tactics described

in area 21.

The  altar  stone  is  protected  by  a  glyph  of  warding  trig-

gered by the approach of any nonevil creature within 5 feet

of the altar.

Glyph of Warding: CR 3; bestow curse; Will negates (DC

16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

21. JADYLYNS CHAMBERS

The door to this room is guarded by one more glyph of ward-

ing, triggered  by  any  creature  opening  the  door  without

speaking a pass-phrase known only to Jadylyn.

Glyph  of  Warding:  CR  3;  5-ft.  electricity  blast  (3d8);

Reflex half (DC 16); Search (DC 28); Disable Device (DC 28).

A simple wooden bed, writing desk, and bench mark this

room as the living space of someone who values auster-

ity. The furnishings are commonplace and unremarkable.

Jadylyn,  the  Priestess  of  the  Well  of  Darkness,  is  encoun-

tered  here.  If  the  characters  visit  the  Well  of  Darkness  a

second time, they may find Jadylyn performing devotions to

Shar in the nearby altar room or instructing her acolytes in

the dogma of Shars faith in area 14. Also, from time to time

she leads expeditions to the surface in order to capture vic-

tims suitable for sacrifice on the Dark Ladys altar.

Jadylyn: hp 41.

Tactics: Jadylyn typically casts endurance early each day.

If she becomes aware of the approach of intruders (the deto-

nation of the glyph in area 19 or right outside her door, or

fighting in area 20), she prepares for a fight, casting armor

of  darkness and  blacklight.  Her  favorite  tactic  is  to  fight

within  the  blacklight,  using  her  +1  returning  chakram to

strike at enemies who cant see her.

Jadylyn is not devoted to the defense of this room or area

20,  and  will  abandon  the  secret  chambers  to  invaders  who

seem  too  strong  to  beat  by  herself.  Shell  go  to  rally  her

acolytes, undead minions, and even Kzntharris or the black

beast and prepare an ambush out in area 19 or back in area 1.

If she finds that most of these followers have been defeated

already, Jadylyn flees into the Underdark through area 11 or

area 13.

Treasure: Jadylyn has collected the pick of the loot from

the travelers she and her followers have ambushed. A stout

iron chest (Open Lock DC 30) at the foot of her bed con-

tains  2,600  sp,  1,400  gp,  a  pouch  with  six  50-gp  gems,  a

wand of Aganazzars scorcher (caster level 6th, 15 charges

left), and a scroll of invisibility sphere.

Acid: The black beasts acidic touch deals 50 points of acid

damage per round to wood or metal objects. Any melee hit

causes opponents armor or clothing to dissolve and become

A   SILVER MARCHES  WEB ENHANCEMENT

BY SEAN K REYNOLDS

More

MARCHES

Beset

eset  by  orcs  and  strange  monsters,  and

struggling to protect its borders and establish a

national identity, the Silver Marches is a place where

danger  is  always  near  and  clever  magic  is  always  needed.  This  web

enhancement offers 18 new magic items and spells for your campaign.

Some are used often by the people of the Silver Marches, while others

are long lost or best forgotten. In addition, we present the lair of Grim-

light, a behir of the Cold Vale famous for his vicious and clever nature.

To use this web enhancement, you should already have The Silver

Marches accessory  by  Ed  Greenwood  and  Jason  Carl.  This  bonus

material  is  brought  to  you  by  the  official  FORGOTTEN REALMS

website: <www.wizards.com/forgottenrealms>.

Specific Magic

Armor

Silver Mail of the Unicorn Queen: This +1 elven chainmail bears a

small symbol of Lurue at the center of the chest. The wearer is pro-

tected as if carrying a periapt of proof against poison and may cast

cure light wounds three times per day. The wearer gains a +4 com-

petence bonus to Charisma-based skill checks as they relate to deal-

ings with good-aligned magical beasts such as unicorns, pegasi, and

giant eagles.

The armor bestows one negative level on any nongood creature

wearing  it.  This  negative  level  persists  as  long  as  the  armor  is

worn  and  disappears  when  the  armor  is  removed.  The  negative

level never results in actual level loss, but the wearer cannot over-

come it in any way (including with restoration spells) while wear-

ing the armor.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

cure light wounds, neutralize poison; Market Price: 23,950 gp; Cost

to Create: 14,050 gp + 792 xp.

Specific Magic

Weapons

Graybrother: This +2 shortspear of a very old style is obviously of

orc  manufacture.  Its  gray  wooden  haft  and  dull  steel  blade  are

carved with orc runes representing murder, hate, and power. It deals

+2d6 points of damage to humans and elves. Unlike bane weapons,

the  spears  enhancement  bonus  is  not  +2  greater  than  normal

against humans or orcs. This weapon is legendary among the tuskers

of the North. Many tribal leaders over the centuries have searched

ruins and dark places for it, as the clerics of Gruumsh say the orc

who  wields  it  is  favored  by  He  Who  Watches  and  will  be  able  to

amass a great unbeatable army to sweep over the human and elven

lands, reducing the inhabitants to slaves.

Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

summon monster I; Market Price: 32,302 gp; Cost to Create: 16,302

gp + 1,280 XP.

Nightbreaker: This  +1  ghost  touch  disruption  heavy  mace is  a

sacred item to the church of the Morninglord, having been wielded

by a successive line of paladins of the Order of the Aster. The item

was  lost  in  1344  DR,  when  its  bearer  left  to  destroy  a  lair  of

specters, and has not been seen since. Certain members of the clergy

believe  this  item  to  be  the  rightful  sign  of  Lathanders  favor

described  in  the  Rhyesters  Matins  (temple)  entry  in  the  Silvery-

moon section of The Silver Marches.

Caster Level: 14th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

heal, plane shift; Market Price: 32,312 gp; Cost to Create: 16,312 gp

+ 1,280 xp.

Orcblinder: At the command of Lady Alustriel, the churches and

wizards  of  the  Silver  Marches  commissioned  a  large  number  of

these +1 arrows decorated with distinctive fletching bearing eyelike

markings. Said to pierce orc eyes with amazing frequency, they deal

an  additional  +2d6  hit  points  of  damage  to  orcs.  Unlike  bane

weapons,  their  enhancement  bonus  is  not  +2  greater  than  normal

against orcs. They are destroyed when used, just like normal arrows.

Crossbow bolts with this power exist but are less common.

Caster  Level: 8th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, summon monster I; Market Price: 167 gp; Cost to Create:

87 gp + 7 XP.

Scouring Sunlight: This +1 holy light mace sheds light when drawn. At

the end are three large gems, one red, one orange, and one a brilliant

yellow,  each  carved  with  Lathanders  holy  symbol.  Once  per  day  the

mace can invoke searing light. The weapon was lost in a crusade against

the forces of Ghaunadaur, drow god of oozes, and has not been seen for

nearly 100 years. Certain clergy members believe this item to be the

rightful sign of Lathanders favor described in the Rhyesters Matins

(temple) entry in the Silverymoon section of The Silver Marches.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

holy smite, searing light, creator must be good; Market Price: 28,305

gp; Cost to Create: 14,305 gp + 1,120 XP.

Selunes  Moon-Arrows: Crafted  in  greater  numbers  in  recent

years by the church of the Moonmaiden to combat the People of the

Black Blood, these +1 arrows are made of silver from tip to fletch-

ing. They deal an additional +2d6 hit points of damage to evil lycan-

thropes.  Unlike  bane  weapons,  their  enhancement  bonus  is  not  +2

greater than normal against lycanthropes. They are destroyed when

used, just like normal arrows.

Caster Level: 8th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor, summon

monster I; Market Price: 167 gp; Cost to Create: 87 gp + 7 XP.

Storm Star: These magical morningstars are of ancient design and

thought to have been created in Netheril. Made of electrum-plated

steel, these weapons display small arcs of lightning that play up and

down the weapons length when wielded, although they do not harm

the wielder or anyone the weapon strikes. Once per day the weapon

can invoke a weakened chain lightning spell at caster level 8. Most

storm stars have a +1 enhancement bonus, but some have been cre-

ated with +2 or even +3 bonuses.

Caster Level: 3rd; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

chain  lightning,  creators  caster  level  must  be  three  times  the

enhancement bonus; Market Price: 20,308 gp (+1), 26,308 gp (+2),

36,308 gp (+3); Cost to Create: 10,308 gp + 800 XP (+1), 13,308 gp +

1,040 XP (+2), 18,308 gp + 1,440 XP (+3).

Tuskreaver: This +1 orc-bane longsword was created by a young elf

wizard. It has an Elvish name which means The blade that causes

orcs to fall like drops of rain in the hardest storm, but most call it

by its Common nickname. Its hilt is decorated with an overlapping

leaf pattern, enameled with green and white markings. The blade is

engraved with hundreds of teardrops in a spiral pattern, inlaid with

burnished copper. At the proper angle, portions of the tears spell out

the swords name in Espruar runes.

Caster  Level: 8th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, summon monster I; Market Price: 18,315 gp; Cost to

Create: 9,315 gp + 720  XP.

Nonmagical Item

Chardalyn: These  rare  black  stones  can  naturally  absorb  and

release  magic,  with  larger  stones  able  to  hold  more  potent  spells.

Found  only  in  the  northern  Sword  Coast,  they  require  no  magical

preparation to function. A spellcaster can cast a single spell into a

chardalyn stone, and when the stone is broken (usually by throwing

it against a hard surface) the spell escapes, centered on the location

of the stones break. A chardalyn stone may remain charged with a

spell  indefinitely.  A  chardalyn  fragment  cannot  be  used  to  store

spells again. Some clever folk charge a chardalyn with a fireball spell

and  attach  it  to  a  shield  or  a  blunt  weapon  such  as  a  mace,  which

causes the magic to release when a foe strikes the stone on the shield,

or when the right part of the mace strikes the target. Obviously such

an attack is best planned by someone resistant or immune to fire.

Some particularly rare chardalyn stones reputedly have the power

to  absorb  fire  and  electricity  magic  that  isnt  directly  targeted  at

them (negating the spell effect entirely and charging the stone for

releasing the spell), but no such stones have been found for several

years. Those who have them are certainly hoarding them.

Market Price: 1,000 gp (up to 3rd-level spell), 3,500 gp (up to

6th-level spell), 8,000 gp (up to 9th-level spell).

RingSending Rings: Each of these simple silver rings bears a single piece

of  ravenar,  a  glossy  black  variety  of  tourmaline.  On  the  stone  is

engraved an eye and a star. Each of these rings is part of a set; the stone

of each ring in the set is a polished piece of a larger uncut ravenar stone

(a typical set of sending rings is five to 11 rings). Once per tenday the

wearer can activate a rings power, broadcasting a short message to all

other bearers of rings in that set, as if using a multiple-target sending

spell. Each other ringbearer may give a short response, as described in

the sending spell. The ring cannot receive or send a message if it is not

worn. There is no way for a wearer to know who might be wearing the

other rings (for example, if a ring were stolen and fell into the wrong

hands), so secret messages are best sent in code or by other means.

More Marches

Normally  these  rings  are  created  as  a  group  and  handed  out  to

individuals who live far apart but may need to contact each other in

emergencies.  Several  rings  in  the  same  set  have  been  given  to  the

stewards  of  key  fortifications  along  the  Silver  Marches  border,

allowing them to warn the interior cities of impending invasions.

Caster  Level: 9th,  Prerequisites: Forge  Ring,  Rarys  telepathic

bond, sending; Market Price: 10,000 gp.

Wondrous Items

Common  Sword  Pendant: This  battered  and  plain-looking  steel

pendant is shaped like a sword or possibly a simple holy symbol of

Tempus or another deity whose symbol is a sword. On command, it

transforms into a masterwork longsword or back into pendant form.

These pendants are favored by people who have to travel into dan-

gerous areas but do not want to risk carrying obvious weapons. Some

of  these  items  are  designed  to  look  like  a  brooch  instead  of  an

amulet, and others may turn into a weapon other than a longsword.

Caster  Level: 5th;  Prerequisites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,  shrink

item; Market Price: 1,315 gp; Cost to Create: 802 gp + 40 XP.

Greater Sword Pendant: As the common sword pendant, but the

item transforms into a +1 longsword.

Caster Level: 5th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Craft Wondrous Item, shrink item; Market Price: 4,315 gp; Cost to

Create: 2,315 gp + 160 XP.

Klens Gargoyle Skull: Created by the sorcerer Klen when he planned

to investigate the gargoyle-infested stronghold in Fell Pass, this actual

skull-like gargoyle head is coated in a thick layer of transparent hard-

ened blue resin (a common feature of many items Klen created). When

the  user  holds  and  concentrates  upon  the  item,  it  detects  gargoyles

within 60 feet by becoming unnaturally cold to the touch.

Caster  Level: 3rd;  Prerequisites: Craft  Wondrous  Item,  locate

creature; Market Price: 3,000 gp.

Rose Mask: This mask, made of a hard rose-colored crystal, is

shaped  like  the  front  of  an  open-faced  helm  rather  than  a  tradi-

tional  mask.  At  the  brow  is  etched  the  symbol  of  Lathander.  The

wearer  of  the  mask  gains  a  +4  morale  bonus  to  saves  against  fear

effects and a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Certain mem-

bers of the clergy believe this item to be the rightful sign of Lath-

anders favor described in the Rhyesters Matins (temple) entry in

the Silverymoon section of The Silver Marches.

Caster Level: 14th; Prerequisites: Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

heal, plane shift; Market Price: 21,000 gp.

Tome of Twelve Seals: This strange book has a cover made of red

dragon hide and 12 pages made of thick black leather. Each leather

page has one rune-inscribed metal disk attached to it, like a seal on

an urn, door, or drawer. Although all 12 seals were originally shiny

gold, now seven have turned to dull, charred lead, their magic spent.

Each seal contains a summoning spell tied to a different creature,

and the runes on the seal are the command words to activate the

seal.  An  activated  seal  summons  the  appropriate  creature,  which

serves for 17 rounds as if conjured by a summon monster spell. Once

used, a seals gold turns into lead and loses its power.

Although only one tome of 12 seals has been found, other forms

of this book may exist with different creatures bound into its seals

or with a different cover. Some versions may even contain normal

spellbook pages or maps to old treasures.

The remaining five seals of the one known tome summon the fol-

lowing  creatures:  huge  air  elemental,  large  fire  elemental,  huge

earth elemental, gibbering mouther, janni.

Caster Level: 17th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item, Extend

Effect: Horn of force

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  create  a  horn  of  force  on  your  forehead,  similar  in  size  and

shape to a unicorns horn. At any time up until the spell expires, you

may launch the horn at a single target as a free action. Striking the

target  requires  a  successful  touch  attack.  If  the  horn  hits,  it  is

destroyed and deals 3d6 points of force damage to the target crea-

ture  and  outlines  it  in  silver-colored  faerie  fire  for  the  remaining

duration of the spell. If it misses, the spell dissipates.

Alustriels Banner

Illusion (Figment)

Level: Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 action

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Effect: Figment of a banner and sound of a trumpet or horn

Duration: 1round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will disbelief (if interacted with)

Spell Resistance: No

An  early  spell  created  by  Alustriel,  this  illusion  has  been  circulated

among the arcane spellcasters of Silverymoon and to others beyond the

city. A simplified form of minor image, it allows you to cause a banner

(such as a battle standard, family crest, or other identifying device) to

appear anywhere within range, accompanied by musical fanfare or the

sound of a horn blowing. The banner may appear large or small (up to

10 feet square), new or old, clean or dirty, and of any color or pattern

you desire and bearing any identifying images you desire. The banner

sheds light as a light spell. You can move it anywhere within range as a

move-equivalent action. The fanfare or horn is normally of the sort

announcing the presence of an important person or a military unit,

although the spell can create any sort of horn signal. Normally, cast-

ers use the spell to rally troops or direct people to a particular location,

especially at night when its light aspect becomes more useful.

Material Component: A horn or trumpet, whether normal size or

miniature.

You give the target creature large feathered wings in the manner of

a pegasus, allowing it to fly with a speed of 100 feet (average maneu-

verability). The creature reacts to these wings as if they were natu-

rally part of its body and can use them immediately. Ride checks to

manipulate the mount are made as if it were not flying (so a rider

familiar  with  horses  can  handle  a  flying  horse  just  as  easily  as  a

normal one).

The  spell  gets  its  name  from  the  Elvish  name  for  Lurue:

Yathaghera the Winged Queen, ruler of the pegasi and unicorns of

Evermeet.

Lair: Grimlights

Ravine

The Cold Vale is a dangerous place of sudden deep gorges, many

of  which  are  inhabited  by  trolls  and  other  fell  creatures.  One

ravine is the home of Grimlight, a very large behir with a sharp

mind,  vicious  nature,  and  a  taste  for  dwarf  flesh  and  dwarven

gold. Grimlight has gathered to him four likeminded trolls, and

with their help has created a lightly fortified lair. The five crea-

tures  use  it  as  a  starting  point  for  raids  on  travelers  and  rival

monsters. (See the map of the area on the next page.)

The ravine was carved by a river, although the river has long

since  diminished  and  split  into  many  smaller  streams.  One  of

those  streams  still  winds  through  the  ravine,  although  it  alter-

nates  between  two  different  beds  every  few  years.  The  walls  of

the gorge are fairly rough (Climb DC 25) and climb steeply from

the  ravines  floor  to  a  height  of  50  feet  (the  level  of  the  sur-

rounding  land).  The  stream,  which  measures  never  more  than

about 2 feet deep, runs from the southwestern end of the ravine

to the northeastern end. After another hundred feet it empties

into  a  small  pond,  which

drains  through  the  rock  into

the Underdark.

The middle of the ravine has

a  hill,  part  of  which  the  mon-

sters  hollowed  out  to  form  a

small cave. Several boulders dot

the  ravine,  and  the  trolls

moved  the  smaller  ones  to

form  a  pair  of  simple  walls

flanking  the  cave  entrance.  To

get in and out of the ravine in

a  hurry,  the  trolls  carved  a  steep  10-foot-wide  stairway  on  the

northwestern  end  and  secured  a  large,  thick  rope  to  the  eastern

cliff wall. Grimlight has a Climb speed of 15 feet, so he can easily

scale any of the cliff walls without artificial means.

The trolls and the behir normally sleep during the day, with one

troll standing watch in the morning and another in the afternoon.

At twilight, the trolls leave the ravine to hunt as a pack (with one

remaining  behind  to  watch  the  treasure).  Grimlight  hunts  alone,

although the monsters usually hunt on the same side of the ravine,

so they can come to each others aid if they encounter something big.

A. Cave Entrance (EL 5)

The troll on guard usually waits just inside the cave, listening for

approaching foes. Grimlight has trained the trolls to be careful

of ranged attacks (such as fireballs and breath weapons), so they

make  good  use  of  cover  while  foes  approach.  The  trolls  keep  a

few 40 lb. rocks near the entrance to use as thrown weapons (+6

melee, 1d8+6 damage).

If  the  watch-troll  hears  or  spots  intruders,  it  alerts  the  other

trolls (if present). One of the others alerts Grimlight.

d Troll: 63 hp; see page 180 in the MONSTER MANUAL .

B. Troll Den (EL 8)

This  is  the  trolls  sleeping  area.  While  they  can  tolerate  filth  and

stench, Grimlight prefers a cleaner lair, and makes the trolls keep

this  place  relatively  unfouled.  During  the  day,  three  trolls  sleep

here; at night it is empty. The trolls have meager treasure because

Grimlight  claims  most  of  it,  but  they  eat  well,  so  they  have  few

complaints.

d Trolls (3): 63 hp each; see page 180 in the MONSTER MANUAL.

Treasure: 320 gp, silver ring with two moonstones (300 gp).

C. Grimlights Den (EL 10)

This is Grimlights sleeping area. Dragonlike, he spreads his coins

and  treasures  about  in  this  den  (as  well  as  acid-smoothed  frag-

ments of the armor and weapons he couldnt fully digest) and uses

them  as  a  bed.  The  treasure  here  includes  the  items  he  claims

from the trolls.

Treasure: 1,740 gp, 4,120 sp, rich olive green peridot (500 gp),

two pearls (100 gp each), gold headband with four small diamonds

(1,500 gp), gold necklace set with 11 moonstones (300 gp), horse

chainmail barding with gold accents (400 gp), ivory scarab set with

five tiger eye agates (150 gp), platinum coronet (500 gp), set of six

ivory  dice  (25  gp  total),  silver  acorn  with  one  green  spinel  (150

gp),  silver  decanter  with  many  zircons  (1,500  gp),  potion  of  cure

moderate wounds.

Breath Weapon (Su): Once per minute, Grimlight can breathe a

line of lightning 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 20 feet long. His breath

weapon deals 7d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 26 half)..

Constrict  (Ex):  With  a  successful  grapple  check,  Grimlight  can

crush a grabbed Colossal or smaller opponent, dealing 2d8+18 points

of bludgeoning damage. He can use his claws against the grappled

opponent as well.

Improved Grab (Ex): If Grimlight hits a Huge or smaller oppo-

nent with his bite attack, he deals normal damage and attempts to

start  a  grapple  as  a  free  action  without  provoking  an  attack  of

opportunity (grapple bonus +42). If he gets a hold, he can constrict

on  the  same  round  and  try  to  swallow  whole  on  the  next  round.

Thereafter,  Grimlight  has  the  option  to  conduct  the  grapple  nor-

mally, or simply use his jaws to hold the opponent (20 penalty on

grapple check, but Grimlight is not considered grappled). In either

case,  each  successful  grapple  check  he  makes  during  successive

rounds automatically deals bite and constrict damage.

Swallow Whole (Ex): Grimlight can swallow a single Large or

smaller  creature  by  making  a  successful  grapple  check  (grapple

bonus +42), provided he already has that opponent in his maw (see

Improved Grab, above). Upon swallowing one opponent, Grimlight

can  use  his  Cleave  feat  to  bite  and  grab  another  opponent.  Once

inside  Grimlight,  the  opponent  takes  2d8+12  points  of  crushing

damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the advanced

behirs  gizzard.  A  successful  grapple  check  allows  the  swallowed

creature to climb out of the gizzard and return to Grimlights maw,

where another successful grapple check is needed to get free. Alter-

natively, a swallowed creature can try to cut its way out with either

claws or a light piercing or slashing weapon. Dealing a total of at

least 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 20) in this way cre-

ates an opening large enough to permit escape. Once a single swal-

lowed creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; thus, another

swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. Grimlights maw can

hold  two  Large,  eight  Medium-size,  16  Small,  64  Tiny,  or  256

Diminutive or smaller opponents.

Cant  Be  Tripped  (Ex):  Because  of  his  many  legs,  Grimlight  is

immune to trip attacks.

Scent (Ex): Grimlight can detect approaching enemies, sniff out

hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.
