agic  creates  fantasy.  Strange  creatures  and

unusual characters can move a tale a step away

from reality, but it takes magicthe dragons

 ery  breath,  the  wizards  powerful  spell,  or

some other element beyond realityto make

the leap to truly fantastic tales. The DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS game provides countless ways for players and DMs

to experience fantasy through magic, but it offers relatively

few  means  by  which  characters  can  employ  this  essential

element of the game.

Tome of Magic presents three new forms of magic that are

unlike any previously offered in the D&D game, and each

provides tremendous opportunities for DMs to infuse more

fantasy into their campaigns. These new forms of magic can

be introduced by incorporating them into ongoing plots and

existing characters, or they can form the basis for whole new

adventures that would have been impossible using only the

standard forms of magic.

This introduction describes the features of this book and

explains how to use them. After reading it, you can begin your

exploration into the new forms of magic with any chapter.

USING THIS BOOK

This  book  introduces  three  new  types  of  magic,  each  of

which  is  supported  by  a  new  standard  class,  plus  prestige

classes, feats, magic items, monsters, and effects similar to

spells. In this way, Tome of Magic is similar to Expanded Psionics

Handbook, but instead of revisiting a concept introduced in

previous editions of the game, this book expands upon the

topic of magic in brand-new ways. Each of the three types of

magic examined in these pages has a long history in fantasy

 ction and has occasionally found its way into the DUNGEONS

& DRAGONS game in the past. Taking its inspiration from real-

world mythology and fantasy  ction, Tome of Magic revamps

these tantalizing tidbits from the games history into exciting

new magic systems for your game.

The new forms of magic are presented in three chapters,

one dedicated to each type. The following paragraphs sum-

marize their contents.

Pact Magic: Characters who use this form of magic gain

power  by  making  pacts  with  powerful  creatures.  In  real-

world legends and literature, evil or foolish mortals usually

make  such  pacts  with   ends,  gaining  power  in  exchange

for either their souls or unnamed services. This treatment,

though intriguing, is rather limited. In particular, the need

for practitioners of pact magic to be either evil or very unwise

effectively negates its use by player characters and relegates

it to NPCs. Thus, the pact magic chapter takes a different

approach,  providing  an  enjoyable  and  balanced  way  for

virtually  any  character  to  become  involved  in  pact  magic

while remaining true to its roots in legend and maintaining

its taboo feel.

Shadow Magic: Shadow magic exists in the D&D game

as a subschool of illusion magic. The FORGOTTEN REALMS Cam-

paign Setting took the concept further with the creation of

the Shadow Weave and the corrupt magic it produces. Tome

of Magic presents a wholly different option for shadow magic

that  connects  it  more  deeply  to  the  Plane  of  Shadow  and

fully embraces that realms true nature as a dark mirror to

the Material Plane.

Truename Magic: Truenames have been mentioned in

D&D  rulebooks  and   ction  since  the   rst  edition  of  the

game. In this concept of magic, every creature has a truename

in addition to its normal name, and anyone who knows its

truename gains a measure of power over it. In fantasy  ction,

this concept often takes a broader form, in which even objects

possess truenames. The presentation of truename magic in

this  book  takes  its  cues  from  both  concepts  and  provides

an easy way for both players and DMs to use the concept of

truenames in play.

ADVICE FOR DMS

The prospect of assimilating new forms of magic into your

campaign  might  seem  daunting,  but  the  process  isnt  as

dif cult as it might seem. First of all, you dont need to

adopt all three forms of magic at once. You could review

the  material  and  introduce  the  one  you  like  best   rst.

Alternatively, you could add just one or two new forms of

magic and not use the rest in your campaign at all. But if

you do want to introduce all three forms of magic at once,

you can do so quite easily.

Unlike the relatively common magic of wizards, sorcerers,

druids, and clerics, each new form of magic presented in this

book is a secret undiscovered by most people. Thus, you can

adopt one or all of them on the sly. The PCs might  nd a book

in a treasure hoard or a hidden library that describes a new

4

form of magic, or they might discover tantalizing hints about

it in a mural on the walls of a ruin. Alternatively, they might

face a monster that utilizes one of the new forms of magic,

or  nd a magic item related to it. Better still, the PCs could

meet a new NPC who practices the magic in question so that

they can see it in action before they know much about it. You

can even subtly work the magic types into the history of your

campaign worldgreat heroes and villains of legend might

have been practitioners, but history ascribed their powers to

normal spellcasting or magic items.

You can also take a more direct route and introduce the

new magic types by allowing players to create new characters

using the material presented in this book or add levels in these

classes to existing characters. Indeed, giving the players the

opportunity to create unique PCs and to have characters who

possess more knowledge about the magic types than most

NPCs do allows them to feel accomplished and powerful.

In addition, being the ones in the know gives the players

ownership over these concepts.

For  more  speci c  ideas  about  incorporating  these  new

forms of magic into your game, check out the beginning of

each chapter.

ADVICE FOR PLAYERS

You can get a lot of use from this product as a player. By

creating a character that uses one of the new forms of magic

presented in these pages (or having your PC take a level in

one of the standard classes from this book), you can bring a

host of new ideas, tactics, and roleplaying opportunities to

the gaming table. You can surprise friends and foes alike with

your new abilities, and plumb new depths of the campaign

world in the process of seeking out more information about

your chosen type of magic.

As with any new game element, you should consult your

DM before you start using this material. Your experience

using your chosen form of magic will be greatly enhanced

if the DM understands the rules and builds a place for it in

her game.

For  more  speci c  ideas  about  how  your  character  can

use  the  new  forms  of  magic,  check  out  the  beginning  of

each  chapter.  The  sections  describing  the  new  standard

classes and prestige classes also provide a wealth of sugges-

tions about roleplaying, character background, tactics, and

advancement choices.

WHAT YOU NEED TO PLAY

Tome of Magic makes use of the information in the three

D&D core rulebooksPlayers Handbook, Dungeon Masters

Guide,  and  Monster  Manual.  Though  no  other  books  are

strictly necessary, certain ones might increase your enjoy-

ment of this product. Most notably, Manual of the Planes and

Planar Handbook provide cool material about the Plane of

Shadow that adds value to the chapter on shadow magic,

and  Draconomicon,  Libris  Mortis,  and  Savage  Species  offer

feats  that  might  prove  useful  to  certain  practitioners  of

pact magic.

SWIFT AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

The  Miniatures  Handbook  introduced  the  concept  of  a  new

action  type:  the  swift  action.  Likewise,  the  Expanded  Psionics

Handbook introduced another new action type: the immediate

action. Some of the class features, feats, granted abilities of ves-

tiges, shadow magic mysteries, and truename magic utterances

described in Tome of Magic use these concepts. A description

of how they work follows.

Swift Actions: A swift action consumes a very small amount

of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy

than a free action. You can perform one swift action per turn

without affecting your ability to perform other actions. In that

regard,  a  swift  action  is  like  a  free  action.  However,  you  can

perform only a single swift action per turn, regardless of what

other actions you take.

You can take a swift action any time you would normally be

allowed to take a free action. Since swift actions usually involve

magic or psionics, or the activation of magic or psionic items,

many  characters  (especially  those  who  dont  use  magic  or

psionics) will never have an opportunity to take a swift action.

Casting  a  quickened  spell  or  a  quickened  shadow  magic

mystery, or speaking a quickened truename magic utterance,

or  manifesting  a  quickened  psionic  power,  is  a  swift  action.

In  addition,  casting  any  spell  or  manifesting  any  power  with

a casting time or manifesting time of 1 swift action is a swift

action. Casting a spell or manifesting a power with a casting or

manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of

opportunity.

Immediate Actions: Much like a swift action, an immediate

action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a

larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. Unlike

a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any

timeeven if its not your turn.

Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using

a swift action, and counts as your swift action for that turn. You

cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after

your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is

not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action

before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the

coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you

are currently flat-footed.

Under these rules, casting a feather fall spell is an immediate

action (not a free action, as stated in the spell description in the

Players Handbook).

Magic Items and Potions: Activating a spell completion item,

activating a spell trigger item, or drinking a potion is a standard

action, even if the spell or mystery from which the scroll, potion,

or item is made can be cast as a swift action.

eings that cannot exist inhabit a place

that cannot be. Cursed by gods and

feared by mortals, these entities fall

outside the boundaries of life, death,

and undeath. They are untouchable

by  even  the  most  powerful  deities,

though they can be summoned and

used by the weakest mortal.

The  practitioner  of  pact  magic

contacts these alien forces by means of special symbols and

rituals.  Once  a  summoning  is  complete,  he  strikes  a  bar-

gain with the summoned being to gain great supernatural

power.

This chapter of Tome of Magic provides all the information

you need to use pact magic in your game, whether as a player

or as a DM. It details a standard class and several prestige

classes for PCs and NPCs, feats for users of pact magic and

others,  and  related  magic  items  that  characters  can  make

or  discover  in  their  adventures.  In  addition,  DMs  might

 nd  many  uses  for  the  strange  monsters  associated  with

pact magic, the descriptions of the organizations that either

employ it or battle those who do, and the sites for adventures

involving this form of magic.

LESSER PACT MAGIC

Pact magic exists in many forms. Oaths, a lesser form of pact

magic, are often used to add power to words. Indeed, oaths

are so commonplace that few recognize their similarity to

the pacts made by pact magic practitioners.

OATHS TO IDEALS

Many  characters  make  pacts  with  themselves.  Such  an

unspoken promise can be as binding as any contract signed

by a merchantand far more effective at forcing a person

to keep his word. For example, a druid who abandons her

allegiance to nature or adopts an extreme outlook must seek

forgiveness  or  remain  forever  divorced  from  her  former

source of comfort and power. A monk who sets one foot off

the path to spiritual purity can never walk that path again.

Even barbarians, wild and inconstant as they are, must gird

their thoughts against lawful leanings or risk losing the wild

emotion that gives them power.

VOWS TO DEITIES

By pledging to serve a deity, a cleric puts his soul into the

hands of a greater power. If he thereafter falters in his duty,

he  can  lose  his  wondrous  powers.  Similarly,  the  cause  of

a paladin requires a constant heart. The slightest doubt or

hesitation can lead to disaster, rendering the paladin unable

to continue her mission without a deitys consent.

BARGAINS WITH OUTSIDERS

Mortals can make binding agreements with outsiders. Spells

such  as  lesser  planar  ally,  planar  ally,  and  greater  planar  ally

allow a spellcaster to bargain for the services of an outsider

or  elemental.  The  planar  binding  spells  work  in  a  similar

manner, allowing a character to task a particular creature in

return for its freedom.

COVENANT SPELLS

Some spells create a hidden pact between caster and subject,

although the target need not be willing. Geas/quest and its

lesser version force a creature to do the casters bidding or

suffer the consequences. Mark of justice sets up clear expecta-

tions for the subjects behavior and de nes the punishment

that will follow should the subject choose to behave other-

wise.

THE METHODS OF PACT MAGIC

A promise possesses power. An oath owns its maker. These

two simple statements express the fundamental principle of

pact magic. From this kernel, pact magic grows and branches,

letting  mortals  draw  from  a  wellspring  of  power  that  no

divine power can touch.

VESTIGES

A  pact  magic  practitioner  gains  his  power  by  bargaining

with entities called vestigesthe remnants of once-living

beings now trapped beyond life and death. Whether they

were mortal souls strong enough to shatter the cage built by

death, wayward outsiders too willful to cease existence, or

dead deities unable to lie quietly in their astral graves, vestiges

are the outcasts of the cosmos. They dwell in a place no one

can reach and exist in a manner no one truly comprehends.

This eternal distancing from reality drives most vestiges mad

and twists their views of all beingseven themselves.

Because vestiges have been divorced from normal reality

by  some  extraordinary  means,  they  can  return  to  it  only

by  binding  themselves  to  other  souls.  Binders,  so  named

for their willingness to share their souls with these exiled

spirits, can summon them forth by means of special rituals.

Since vestiges constantly hunger for any small taste of reality,

they always answer the call of any binders powerful enough

to draw them forth from the void.

VESTIGES SEALS

Each vestige is associated with a seala series of lines within

a circlethat acts as its symbol and as a portal through which

it can enter normal existence.

To call a vestige, a binder must know and be able to draw

its seal. In fact, anyone can draw a seal, but only someone

with the power to host a vestige can hope to create a pact

that opens a door for it.

SUMMONING

Immediately  after  drawing  a  seal,  a  binder  must  ritually

invoke  the  desired  vestiges  name  and  title  to  summon  it.

Again,  though  anyone  can  intone  the  proper  words,  the

binders power is the key to success. Even so, a binder can

summon only those vestiges that are within the range of his

personal power.

The origins of a vestiges name and title seem associated

with both its previous existence in reality and its current

state. These appellations can change over time, although such

alterations occur only rarely. For this reason, most binders

spend a great deal of time studying the origins and theories

of pact magic in order to gain the insight that will allow them

to foresee future developments.

PACT MAKING

Once a summoned vestige manifests, a binder must formally

address it and request a pact. The general terms of the pact

are always the same, no matter which vestige is summoned.

To gain the powers that a vestige offers, a binder must agree

to host it for a period of 24 hours.

When  a  binder  offers  a  pact,  a  contest  of  wills  ensues

between him and the vestige. This contest might be played

out by means of an argument, a staring match, a riddle posed

to the binder, or in any number of other ways. If the vestige

ultimately wins, it maintains an amount of in uence over

the binder for the duration of the pact. If the binder does not

act as the vestige wills, it can punish him. However, if the

binder reigns supreme after the contest, the vestige quietly

accompanies him.

BINDING

Once a binder makes a pact with a vestige, the two are inex-

tricably bound. A shard of the vestiges soul fuses with the

binders spirit, creating a link so tight that the binders body

manifests some physical sign of the vestiges presence. The

inconvenience of such a sign is a small price to pay for the

supernatural powers that the vestige grantspowers that

Drawing a vestiges seal

require  no  components,  no  complicated  gestures,  and  no

tongue-twisting words to use. When a binder wishes to use

the abilities granted by a vestige, he simply wills the desired

result to happen.

LEARNING PACT MAGIC

Those  who  practice  pact  magic  expound  upon  its  ease.  A

binder need never beg on his knees for power or study moldy

tomes for hours on end to grasp the secrets of a few simple

spells. Once he learns the basics of pact magic, he can call

up a vestige at any time and take its power for his own. Ves-

tiges never refuse pacts, and they ask little in return for the

power they grant.

However, the tempting ease of pact magic and the necessity

of soul binding with a being whose nature is completely alien

generates suspicion about its practitioners. Many churches

actively hunt binders and attempt to eradicate evidence of

pact magic to prevent the faithful from learning that beings

can exist that are beyond the reach of the gods. This general

condemnation of pact magic makes discovering it dif cult,

even though the art itself remains quite simple.

Many binders are defrocked priests or acolytes who took

up pact magic after discovering the rituals to contact vestiges

in  heretical  texts  kept  hidden  in  secret  temple  libraries.

Others take up the path after discovering the secrets of pacts

and seals during investigations of ancient ruins. A few gain

their knowledge of the binders arts from elder binders, but

tutelage is rare because of the secrecy that most binders try

to maintain and the cloud of suspicion under which they

must work.

THE BINDER

I call upon you, Amon, the Void before the Altar. Render unto me

your sight and your breath, for I stand before your seal and possess

your talisman.

Morden, dwarf binder,

calling upon a vestige to make a pact

Between mortality and godhood, beyond life and undeath,

souls exist in a place both forgotten and inaccessible. Mortals

too strong-willed to pass into the afterlife, dead outsiders too

powerful to be absorbed into their planes, the dreams of slain

deities put to rest eons before the current agethese are the

beings called vestiges. A seal forms the door between these

beings and reality, and knowledge is the key to opening it.

Only the binder possesses that key, because only he knows

the vestiges special seals and the rituals by which they can

be  called  from  the  void  beyond  reality.  By  drawing  their

seals and speaking the words of power, he summons these

strange entities, bargains with them, and binds them to his

service.

MAKING A BINDER

The binder can rede ne his role in an adventuring party on

a daily basis, if desired. His potent abilities are always useful

in combat, but what those abilities are and what strategies

he  employs  when  using  them  depend  on  the  vestige  that

he binds. As with any class, the race, alignment, and abil-

ity choices made upon character creation in uence future

choices. The binder class, however, offers a special opportu-

nity to break free of a spellcasters typical boundaries.

Abilities: A binder typically possesses a healthy body and

a strong personality, since high Constitution and Charisma

scores can improve many of his supernatural abilities. More

importantly, a high Charisma score enhances the binders

ability to make bene cial pacts with vestiges. Since many

vestiges  grant  improved  melee  or  ranged  combat  ability,

a high Strength or Dexterity score serves the binder well.

Lastly, a high Intelligence score grants him extra skill points

to spend on important class skills.

Races: Because binders associate with spirits beyond the

control of the gods, the practice of pact magic is forbidden by

most religions. Binders tend to be rare among all humanoid

races. Given their ambition and their penchant for a cosmo-

politan lifestyle, humans choose the path of the binder more

frequently than members of other races do, but binders are

no more welcome in human society than in any other. Many

hal ing traveling communities remain largely unaware of

binders, but settlements often gain knowledge of themand

learn to fear themfrom the clergy of other races in neigh-

boring areas. Because single deities dominate the cultures of

both elves and dwarves, members of these races tend to be

more aware ofand more opposed tobinders than their

fellow humanoids. Gnomes who know of binders claim that

Garl Glittergold appreciates the cosmic joke of mortal souls

that  grow  so  powerful  that  they  can  be  neither  saved  nor

damned. Half-orcs and half-elves, accustomed as they are to

existing on the fringe of society and suffering persecution,

sometimes even sympathize with the plight of binders.

Alignment: Although vestiges were once beings of light

and darkness like all creatures of the planes, their long exis-

tence in a strange state beyond normal reality has twisted

them  into  enigmatic  and  amoral  entities.  However,  their

nature does not dictate the alignments of those who bind to

them. A fearsome and violent vestige can lend its powers to

a good binder, who uses them to make peace with enemies.

Conversely, a sweet-faced and kind vestige might grant an evil

binder the power to wreak havoc. In some cases, the same

vestige  might  make  separate  but  simultaneous  pacts  with

two binders who are in direct con ict with one another.

Vestiges are not easily de ned as good, evil, lawful, or cha-

otic, but their unfathomable mindsets and strange appearance

often disturb lawful and good creatures. Thus, most binders

are neutral, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil, or neutral evil.

CLASS FEATURES

As a binder, you can serve many purposes in an adventur-

ing  party.  Since  each  vestige  grants  you  a  different  set  of

supernatural abilities, you can choose which role to play on

any given daydiplomat, scout, support, melee combatant,

or ranged combatant. At higher levels, you can host more

than one vestige at a time to gain an even wider range of

abilities. You also gain special defenses and bonus feats that

let you further re ne your role in the party and play to your

strengths.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: As a binder, you gain

pro ciency with all simple weapons and with light armor,

but not with shields.

Soul Binding (Su): Through special methods

known only to binders, you can contact a vestige

and  make  a  pact  with  it.  At  1st  level,  you  can

make  a  pact  with  one  vestige  at  a  time.  At

higher levels, you can form and maintain

pacts with multiple vestiges simultane-

ously, as shown on Table 11. You must

complete  the  summoning  and  binding

process with each separately, so each has

its normal chance to in uence you. You

bear  the  physical  sign  of  binding  for

each  one.  Your  effective  binder  level,

or EBL (your binder class level plus any

soul binding bonuses you receive from

prestige classes or other sources),

determines the maximum level

of  vestige  you  can  summon,  as

well as all other functions related

to binding vestiges. This value equates

to your binder class level, as

given on Table 11, for this

purpose. If the vestige you

are  trying  to  contact  is  of  a

higher  level  than  your  indi-

cated  maximum,  you  cannot

summon it.

To contact a vestige, you must draw its unique

seal visibly on a surface (generally the ground), making the

image at least 5 feet across. Drawing a seal requires the abil-

ity to mark a surface and 1 minute of concentration, and the

act provokes attacks of opportunity. A seal not used within

1 minute of its drawing loses all potency, and you must draw

a new one to contact the vestige. A vestige might also have

other requirements for contact, as noted in its entry (see The

Vestiges, page 16).

Once the seal is drawn, you must perform a ritual requiring

a full-round action to summon the corresponding vestige.

During this time, you must touch the seal and call out to the

vestige using both its name and its title. The ritual fails if you

cannot be heard (for example, if you are within the area of a

silence spell). Otherwise, a manifestation of the vestige appears

in the seals space as soon as you  nish the ritual. This image

is not the actual vestige; it is merely a  gmentan illusion

that cannot harm or be harmed by any creature. Creatures

that interact with the image or study it carefully automati-

cally recognize it as illusory. The summoned image ignores

everyone but you. If you fail to address it within 1 round, it

disappears. The vestige speaks in whatever language you used

to call it.

To make a pact with your summoned vestige, you must

make a binding check (1d20 + your effective binder level

+  your  Cha  modi er).  This  process  requires  1  minute,

but you can choose to make a rushed binding check as a

full-round action at a 10

penalty. The DC for this

check is provided in the

description  of  each  ves-

tige (see pages 1649). You

must make your perilous pact

alone; others cannot aid you in

any way.

Whether  the  binding  check  suc-

ceeds  or  fails,  you  gain  the  powers

granted  by  the  vestige  for  24  hours.

During  that  time,  you  cannot  rid

yourself of the vestige unless you pos-

sess the Expel Vestige feat. Success or

failure does, however, determine other

aspects of the pact. If you fail the bind-

ing check, the vestige in uences your

personality and your actions, and you

are said to have made a poor pact. (Spe-

ci cally, the vestiges presence changes

your general demeanor, and it can force

you  to  perform  or  refrain  from  certain

actions.) If your binding check is suc-

cessful,  the  vestige  has  no  control

over your actions and does not

in uence your personality. In

this case, you are said to have

made a good pact.

While  under  the  in uence  of  a

vestige,  you  must  adhere  to  its  re-

quirements to the best of your ability.

If you are conscious and free-willed, and you encounter a

situation in which you cannot or will not refrain from a pro-

hibited action or perform a required one, you take a 1 penalty

on attack rolls, saving throws, and checks until that vestige

leaves you. If you are in uenced by more than one vestige,

you must act according to all their in uences. If you fail to

ful ll the requirements of more than one vestige or disobey

a single vestige more than once, the penalties stack.

As long as you are bound to a vestige, you manifest a speci c

physical sign of its presence, as given in its entry. This sign is

real, not an illusory or shapechanging effect, and someone

using true seeing perceives it just as it is. You can hide a sign

by mundane or magical means without penalty, or you can

prevent it from appearing at all if you have the suppress sign

ability.

Vestiges are bound to your soul by the pact. They cannot be

targeted or expelled by any means except the Expel Vestige

feat, nor can they be suppressed except by an antimagic  eld

or similar effect.

The Dif culty Class for a saving throw against any super-

natural power granted by a vestige is 10 + 1/2 your effective

binder level + your Cha modi er.

Suppress Sign (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, when you

make a good pact, you can choose not to exhibit the physical

sign that normally accompanies a pact with a vestige. You can

suppress or reveal the sign at will as a swift action. With a

poor pact, you gain the powers of the vestige, but you cannot

suppress its sign. You show it for the duration of the pact and

are in uenced by it as normal.

Bonus Feats: At 4th level, and again at 11th and 18th

level, you gain a bonus feat of your choice from the follow-

ing list: Armor Pro ciency (medium), Armor Pro ciency

(heavy), Diligent, Investigator, Martial Weapon Pro ciency,

Negotiator, Persuasive, Shield Pro ciency, and the feats pre-

sented in this chapter. Feats not described in this book can

be found in the Players Handbook. These feats are in addition

to those normally gained for attaining higher levels, but

you must still meet any prerequisites for the bonus feats

you choose.

Pact  Augmentation  (Su):  Beginning  at  2nd  level,  you

can draw additional power from the vestiges you bind. As

long as you are bound to at least one vestige, you can choose

one ability from the following list. Each time you rebind a

vestige, you also reselect your pact augmentation ability.

As you attain higher levels, you can make additional selec-

tions  from  the  list.  You  gain  one  additional  ability  at  5th,

10th, 16th, and 20th level (to a maximum of  ve selections

at 20th level). You can choose a single ability multiple times,

and their effects stack. For instance, at 16th level you could

choose bonus hit points twice and damage reduction twice,

gaining +10 hit points and damage reduction 2/.

Pact Augmentation Abilities

+5 hit points

Energy resistance 5 (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic)

+1 insight bonus on saving throws

Damage reduction 1/

+1 insight bonus to Armor Class

+1 insight bonus on attack rolls

+1 insight bonus on damage rolls

+2 insight bonus on initiative checks

Soul  Guardian  (Su):  Beginning  at  6th  level,  you  have

immunity to fear effects as long as you are bound to a vestige.

As you attain higher binder levels, the vestige guards its time

with you even more jealously, granting you protection from

additional effects that would harm your soul and life energy

for as long as the pact lasts.

At  9th  level,  you  gain  the  slippery  mind  ability,  which

allows you to wriggle free from magical effects that would

otherwise control or compel you. If you fail your saving throw

against an enchantment spell or effect, you can attempt it

again 1 round later at the same DC. You get only this one

extra chance to succeed on your saving throw.

At  13th  level,  you  gain  immunity  to  energy  drain  and

negative levels.

When you attain 19th level, your bound vestiges completely

protect your mind, granting you immunity to all mind-affect-

ing spells and abilities.

PLAYING A BINDER

COMBAT

Others might misunderstand your powers, but you cant allow

their shortcomings to stop you. You know that contacting

the vestiges isnt an evil act, and youve never traded your

soul for any sort of bene t. However, you cant afford to be

too open about your activities, or those who fear your form

of  magic  might  learn  something  truly  terrifyingyour

magic is easy.

You dont need to spend hours studying incomprehensible

writings, beg for boons from a distant deity, or have magic in

your blood. With the proper seal and the necessary personal

power, you can call up a vestige and gain its abilities with just

a few words. The situation does sometimes get more compli-

cated, and you havent  gured it all out yet, but youre certain

that your path to power lies with the vestigescreatures so

strong that even the gods cant contain them.

You  are  well  aware  that  others  like  yourself  exist.  The

process  of  summoning  a  vestige  is  so  simple  that  youve

probably met other practitioners without even knowing it.

All it takes is the knowledge and the will to complete the

process, so any kind of person could conceivably speak with

the same spirits that serve as your patrons. You must always

watch for the signs and be wary of other binders. Although

they could be valuable sources of knowledge, they might also

be enemies.

You might engage in adventures for many reasons, but

amassing personal power is generally your primary con-

cern. Certain vestiges refuse to answer the call of novice

binders, and a desire to contact them and gain their powers

often motivates your escapades. Perhaps you took up a life of

adventure after  eeing persecution. After all, your activities

and powers seem foreign and frightening to many people,

and various religious sects consider contacting a vestige

a sacrilege.

RELIGION

Because you have the means to speak directly with powers

beyond the reach of most deities, you tend to scorn the wor-

ship of such beings. At the same time, your strength  ows

from  creatures  expatriated  from  the  rule  of  those  deities,

and for that reason, you fear inciting the ire of a god or his

worshipers. Although you are unlikely to take up a clerics

raiment, you  nd it convenient to pay homage to gods and

show outward respect for their servants.

OTHER CLASSES

You need to be especially careful around paladins, clerics, and

others devoted to a deity. Such individuals are likely to have

the worst reaction to your abilities, though they might not be

informed enough to have an opinion. Wizards, sorcerers, and

other arcane spellcasters appreciate the power you can gain,

but consider their own magic superior. Characters of any class

tend to mistrust you if they actually see you summoning a

vestige, but open-minded individuals value your worth as an

ally no matter how you achieve your power.

When youre not hosting a vestige, youre not a great melee

or ranged combatant. Your combat skills are roughly compa-

rable to those of a cleric without spells, except that you lack

the clerics pro ciency with shields and medium and heavy

armor. Making a pact with a vestige can easily make up for

this de ciency.

The mix of abilities that vestiges offer you lets you de ne

your role in each days encounters. For example, you could

make a pact with a vestige that makes you stealthy so that you

can scout ahead and take foes by surprise. You could bind

with one that lets you take on the role of a stalwart  ghter

who can use arms and armor with skill. Alternatively, you

could  decide  to  be  a  silver-tongued  speaker,  winning  the

hearts and minds of friend and foe alike. At higher levels,

you can make a pact with more than one vestige at a time

to gain even greater versatility in combat and roleplaying

encounters.

ADVANCEMENT

You pro t most from remaining a binder throughout your

career. Each level of the binder class increases the power you

gain from making a pact with a vestige; you gain other class

abilities at higher levels as well. As you advance and establish

your role in the adventuring party, you might  nd yourself

using  one  or  two  vestiges  more  than  others.  In  that  case,

consider taking a level or two in another class to supplement

the abilities the vestige grants you. For example, if you often

 nd yourself in melee, a level of barbarian or  ghter might

help to make you more effective. On the other hand, if you

regularly act as your groups spokesperson and scout, a level

BINDERS IN THE WORLD

Bindersyou know why theyre called that? Because they give up

their souls to bind with the dark forces. Heretics, the lot of them.

They profane the natural order! Should you ever meet one, destroy

him, and let the gods punish him for his crimes.

Prelate Czarran High st, dwarf paladin of Moradin

Binders  put  the  allure  of  the  forbidden  into  the  hands  of

players, allowing them to participate in occult-style activities

without forcing them to play evil characters. At the same time,

the reaction that most religious organizations have to binders

can reveal a darker side to the clergy of good-aligned deities

while creating opportunities for great roleplaying.

DAILY LIFE

A binder typically begins his day by  nding a quiet, out-of-

the-way place to summon the vestige whose power he desires.

He then spends the rest of the day engaged in whatever task

seems most pressing while trying to avoid too much con-

tact with others. Although many binders are adept at social

interaction, a vestiges in uence can affect his personality.

The bound spirits sign also manifests on his body unless he

has the means to prevent it. When not adventuring, binders

often  spend  their  time  seeking  out  scraps  of  information

about vestiges and other soul binders. The pursuit of such

forbidden knowledge is often quite dangerous and can result

in the binder undertaking additional adventures.

Binders generally avoid accepting followers or serving in lead-

ership positions because a high-pro le station draws too many

eyes. Yet the charismatic and mysterious nature of most bind-

ers draws others to them like moths to  ame, so binders often

develop friendships with outcasts, rebels, curious youths, and

others who feel they dont  t in or  arent fond of the status quo.

By actively strengthening these bonds of friendship, a binder

can create secret networks of allies and spies who will alert him

to threats and aid him in times of danger. Local authorities rarely

see these groups as simple gatherings of friends. The binders

allies are often involved in other clandestine dealings that spell

trouble for the whole network.

NOTABLES

Because of the secrecy surrounding vestiges and the constant

attempts to quash all knowledge of soul binding, few bind-

ers  become  notable  in  their  communities.  Even  so,  most

who pursue this class know of Syfal, the mythic individual

who is said to have  rst discovered the means of contacting

vestiges.  Syfals  name  appears  in  almost  every  text  about

vestiges, though whether he is invoked as a patron saint of

the practice or cursed as a foul de ler of the universal order

depends on the writers viewpoint. No one knows for certain

who or what Syfal was, or even when he lived, but the age of

some carvings about him found in ruins indicates that he

must have lived and died millennia ago.

Some binders are persecuted for practicing pact magic, and others suffer an even worse fate

Without an obvious champion for their practice, many

binders look to history for signs of famous folk who might

secretly have pursued this profession. Legends are replete

with great heroes and villains who possess strange powers,

and  many  a  binder  takes  comfort  in  the  belief  that  an

admired individual spoke to the same vestiges that he con-

tacts every day.

ORGANIZATIONS

Binders rarely work in groups, but an individual binder who

gathers a small circle of friends occasionally chooses one or

two of them as apprentices. Such a group might eventually

grow into a cabal of a dozen or so people whom the binder

has taken into his con dence. In general, cabals of this sort

exist solely to protect the binder and to seek out rumors and

hints relating to other binders or vestige lore. Rarely, such a

cabal grows into a larger organization, such as the Theurgian

Society. For more information about the Theurgian Society,

see  the  Pact  Magic  Organizations  section  beginning  on

page 90.

NPC REACTIONS

Most  people  have  an  indifferent  attitude  toward  binders

because they know very little about what such individuals

do. Even those who gain a basic understanding of binders

powers typically view these individuals with the same respect

or fear that they view conjurers or necromancers.

The  situation  changes  radically  when  religion  comes

into the equation, however. The leaders of most organized

religions are aware of binders to at least some degree. Most

choose to keep that knowledge secret, lest the common clergy

and worshipers learn of powers beyond the reach of their dei-

ties. Occasionally, a church even maintains a secret arm of its

organization to seek out and eradicate binders. Such a force

usually possesses a small library of texts describing vestiges

and the practices required to summon them, so that its leaders

can teach members to recognize the signs of pact magic and

train them to defeat binders. Ironically, books stolen from

such libraries introduce many future binders to pact magic.

In fact, many binders began their careers as clerics before

the promise of a swift means to power seduced them to the

path of pact magic. This attrition is one reason why clerics,

paladins, and other religious people who know about binders

react to them in an unfriendly or hostile manner.

BINDER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge

(religion),  or  who  have  the  bardic  knowledge  ability,  can

research binders and pact magic to learn more about them.

Also, although religious groups try to quash the stories of

binders, bards often  nd the intrigue and romance of pact

magic so alluring that they cant resist sharing the tales of

it, if only with other bards. When a character makes a skill

check or a bardic knowledge check, read or paraphrase the

following,  including  the  information  from  lower  DCs.  A

character  with  ranks  in  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can  also

gain some information about binders, though each of the

DCs below increases by 5 for such checks.

DC 15: Certain strange spellcasters called binders practice

a taboo art known as pact magic. Most clerics who know of

VARIANT:

HETERODOXY AND HERESY

Deities who despise vestiges and binders might frown upon a

follower consorting with binders or for taking up pact magic. In

the case of a cleric or paladin, such punishment often involves

revocation  of  divine  powers,  rendering  the  character  an  ex-

cleric or ex-paladin, as described in the Players Handbook. This

penalty is quite harsh, especially if the transgression is one for

which the deity does not allow atonement, such as taking levels

in the binder class. If you want to represent removal of a clerics

or paladins powers but you dont want to overly hinder the of-

fending PC, consider the following ideas.

Clerics and paladins need not abandon their principles to be

friendly  with  binders  or  even  to  take  up  pact  magic.  Perhaps

the  character  maintains  all  her  powers,  but  they  now  stem

from devotion to her ideals, like those of any cleric not devoted

to a specific deity. The character becomes a heretic to her own

church, but she maintains the same morals and outlook she had

before.

Alternatively,  a  PC  cleric  or  paladin  need  not  abandon  her

deity. Perhaps the main wing of her church disavows her, but

other heterodox factions exist. In this situation, the characters

deity doesnt offer followers a clear opinion about binders and

pact  magic,  but  rather  allows  them  to  wrestle  with  the  topic

on  their  own.  Perhaps  the  deity  has  withheld  an  opinion  on

the subject in hopes that his followers will come to the proper

conclusion by themselves, or perhaps he is content to let the

strongest philosophy win the day.

Although  it  isnt  necessary  to  provide  rules  for  penalizing

characters  who  consort  with  (or  even  become)  binders,  you

can  use  the  following  optional  rules  to  represent  the  above

possibilities.

Cleric:  A  cleric  who  goes  against  the  will  of  his  deity  with

regard  to  pact  magicusually  by  taking  a  level  in  the  binder

classloses  the  ability  to  access  his  domains,  including  his

domain  spell  slots  and  granted  powers.  If  the  cleric  takes  a

second level in the class and thus gains the pact augmentation

ability, he can add his cleric level to his binder level for the pur-

pose of determining its effects. In addition, he gains a bonus

feat chosen from the binders bonus feat list upon attaining 3rd

level as a binder (as well as the bonus feat awarded to all binders

at 4th level). A cleric who merely consorts with a binder might

find  himself  turned  away  from  his  own  temples,  at  best,  or

hunted as a heretic alongside his binder companion, at worst.

Paladin: A paladin who goes against the will of her deity with

regard  to  pact  magicagain,  by  taking  levels  as  a  binder

cannot use the divine grace ability. If she takes enough binder

levels  to  gain  the  pact  augmentation  ability,  she  can  add  her

cleric level to her binder level for the purpose of determining its

effects. As with clerics who associate themselves with binders, a

paladin might be ostracized, excommunicated, or hunted by her

own church if she continues the relationship with the binder.

14

binders consider them little more than heretics but grudg-

ingly  acknowledge  that  they  are  real.  These  spellcasters

routinely contact otherworldly forces and make pacts with

them for power. A particular sign, seal, or name is associated

with each spirit.

DC  20:  Binders  contact  vestigessouls  that  have  been

lost to the gods and planes, and banished to some hidden

place. A binder calls forth these spirits and makes pacts with

them. In exchange for allowing the vestige to experience life

through his body, a binder assumes some of its powers. Many

churches outlaw this practice of pact magic. Some even mark

its practitioners for death.

DC  25:  Binders  arent  true  spellcastersthey  and  the

spirits they summon work outside the normal  ow of magic.

The  powers  they  gain  and  the  vestiges  they  host  cant  be

dispelled or banished by normal means.

DC 28: Characters who achieve this level of success know

the  legend,  manifestation,  sign,  and  seal  of  one  or  more

particular  vestiges.  They  also  know  the  basic  powers  that

the vestige grants (the  rst paragraph beneath the vestiges

name and title in its entry).

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the speci c binders in your

campaign, or the arm of a church responsible for  nding and

eradicating users of pact magic. Also, such a character could

learn the speci cs of the powers that a particular vestige

grants.

A character trying to establish contact with a binder or an

organization opposed to such individuals can make a DC 30

Gather Information check to discover the necessary interme-

diaries and protocols for contact. Talking directly to a binder

or member of an opposing group wont work, because both

are likely to feign ignorance. A PC who can offer something

of value (such as information or a magic item) to the person

or  people  he  is  trying  to  contact  gains  a  +2  circumstance

bonus on the check.

BINDERS IN THE GAME

Binders  t easily into just about any game simply because

their existence has remained largely a secret. You can intro-

duce  binders  through  the  PCs  discovery  of  ancient  lore,

a  chance  meeting  with  an  NPC  binder,  or  an  encounter

with agents of a church seeking out a binder. Perhaps your

groups introduction to pact magic comes when a player sits

down to play her new binder PC. In any case, using binders

in your game requires little more than simply putting one

into play.

The player of a binder character probably thrills at dancing

on the daggers edge of discovery by the authorities. Hiding

the signs of soul binding, controlling a vestiges in uence,

and   nding  explanations  for  supernatural  abilities  make

for fun roleplaying, so the player will be looking for such

opportunities. At the same time, the player of a binder char-

acter might  nd continual persecution tiresome and grow

disillusioned if public use of her characters abilities always

provokes a negative reaction.

The best solution is to keep in mind that those who hunt

binders generally want to keep their effortsand even the

existence of bindersa secret. Although the con ict between

binders and those who fear them could explode at any time,

in most cases it simmers under the surface as a cloak-and-

dagger con ict. Therefore, a game that includes a binder PC

can function in much the same way as it does now. You can

occasionally present side plots, adventures, and encounters

that focus on the binders class and abilities, just as you would

for any other member of the adventuring party.

ADAPTATION

You can signi cantly change the binders role in your game

without dramatically changing the mechanics. For example,

binders could devote themselves to beings other than vestiges.

To lend binders a darker or lighter feel, you could have them

contact and bind themselves to  ends or celestials. Binders

related to a particular religious or secular order could bind

themselves to the spirits of saints or heroes. The process of

soul binding could even be a totemic rite that lets a binder

call up ancestors or the essential spirits of creatures by draw-

ing upon the power of special tattoos or talismans. When

changing the focus of a binders pact making, you can keep

the mechanics of the class largely the same, though you might

want to change the in uences of the vestiges (or whatever

beings you choose) to suit their new natures.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A binder can function as an ally or a villain, but even as an

ally,  hes  likely  to  be  secretive  and  suspicious  of  the  PCs.

If a binder is encountered in a social setting, he might not

be bound to a vestige unless he is expecting trouble, since

showing signs is likely to invite trouble. A binder angered

by the PCs might quietly  ee and then return for revenge a

few minutes later. With no signi cant limits on the use of

their abilities, binders typically try to use their most power-

ful attacks  rst.

EL 8: Morden disregarded his peoples taboos, abandoned

their  traditions,  and  embarked  upon  a  heretical  path  in

pursuit of the power of pact magic. A nonconformist in the

purest sense, he enjoys shocking others and acting counter to

their expectations, but he always does so with a grin so that

they know hes sharing the joke with them. Morden exudes

a charming con dence even in the direst circumstances, and

hes always willing to befriend a foe.

PCs might encounter Morden (see the statstics block on

the next page) while he searches for pact magic lore in a city

or a ruin. Alternatively, he might have offered his services

as  a  mercenary  and  accepted  payment  to   ght  the  party.

Morden prefers to surprise his foes. If he can, Morden moves

adjacent to an enemy before beginning battle, using Focalors

breath to blind a target affected by his aura of sadness. On

the following round, Morden employs Sudden Ability Focus

and Empower Supernatural Ability in conjunction with  re

breath.  Charge  attacks  and  lightning  strikes  follow  until

Morden regains use of his other powers.

THE VESTIGES

Existence de nes reality. Beyond it, therefore, naught exists

not even a void. This simple reasoning would be irrefutable

were it not for the existence of vestiges. Called forth from

nowhere, composed of nothing, they exist entirely outside the

rules of reality. They are untouchable, untraceable, and beyond

all powers that might attempt to con ne or de ne them. This

philosophical conundrum has intrigued sages interested in

pact magic for centuries and de ed all their theories. Vestiges

simply cannot exist, and yet, it seems that they do.

Some scholars say that vestiges are a common myththey

do  not  actually  exist  but  are  inherent  in  the  minds  of  all

beings. Others say they are true spiritssouls cast off into

some plane that is unreachable by all magic due to an agree-

ment between the gods. Whatever the truth of the matter,

vestiges seem desperate to participate in reality, if only by

peering at it through another creatures eyes.

CHOOSING A VESTIGE

Although some binders devote themselves to single vestiges

or choose vestiges based on philosophy or personality, most

freely  choose  among  all  the  vestiges  they  can  call  forth.

When  deciding  which  vestige  to  summon,  a  binder  must

consider  several  factors.  In  most  cases,  this  decision  is

based largely on his likely needs for the day. Binders must

anticipate their activities in much the same way as a wizard

must when preparing spells. Some binders wait to summon

a vestige (or summon one and wait to summon others) until

they know more of what the day holds, though by doing so

they risk not having the extra powers provided by a vestige

at a critical moment.

In addition to the needs of the day, a binder should con-

sider the vestiges sign and in uence. A binder can mitigate

any potential trouble that a vestiges in uence might cause

by  choosing  either  a  vestige  whose  in uence  is  generally

inoffensive, or one that he can easily control. In addition, the

binder should consider his own abilities when making his

choice. He might possess feats, magic items, or other abilities

that would enhance his performance while he is bound to a

particular vestige.

ROLEPLAYING THE PACT

The process of summoning a vestige and making a pact with

it was designed to be a behind-the-scenes processmuch like

the  exact  ways  that  clerics  pray  for  spells  and  wizards  study

their spellbooks. However, you can roleplay this interaction if

you wish. Each vestiges entry describes its manifestation and

provides  some  notes  on  its  voice  or  personality.  The  legend

behind the vestige also provides some roleplaying inspiration

that a DM might find helpful.

Because a vestige has already agreed to bind with its sum-

moner simply by showing up, the process of pact making boils

down  to  a  contest  of  wills  to  determine  whether  the  vestige

gains  influence  over  the  binder.  This  contest  could  take  the

form of a debate, an argument, a staring competition, a game

of riddles, a shouting match, a psychic contest, or any one of

numerous other competitions. In many cases, the binder begins

by flattering the spirit with an entreaty for aid, worded carefully

so as not to offend the vestige or put the binder in a position of

weakness. If the spirit speaks during this process, it often asks

why the binder wishes to use its powers. In general, the spirit

is pleased by answers that coincide with its influence and inter-

ests, but it is also wary of deception. Some vestiges demand

supplication, while others respond better to binders who adopt

strong and willful postures. If youre a DM who wants to roleplay

the process of pact making, consider rewarding good roleplay-

ing with a circumstance bonus on the binding check.

16

MAKING A PACT

A summoned vestige is interested only in striking a bargain

with its summoner. As soon as the pact is made, the vestige

vanishes  and  the  binder  shows  its  sign,  unless  he  has  the

means to suppress it. Once made, a pact cannot be broken.

Neither the binder nor the vestige can end the association

before its duration elapses, unless the binder has the Expel

Vestige feat.

Occasionally, a vestige might speak with a binder about

other matters before the process of binding begins, though

its willingness to do so is based entirely on whim. The infor-

mation gained in such a conversation, however, is suspect

because  vestiges  are  notoriously  unreliable  sources.  They

dont  seem  to  recall  anything  except  their  own  lives,  and

even those memories are often confused or incorrect.

To make themselves more attractive to binders, vestiges

often pretend to possess much greater knowledge than they

are  capable  of  having;  indeed,  some  even  assert  that  they

can see the future or monitor present events occurring in

distant locations. Its impossible to force a vestige to tell the

truth or even determine whether it is lying, since vestiges

have immunity to all spells except antimagic  eld, and Sense

Motive attempts against them always fail.

Even  so,  however,  some  binders  regularly  consult  with

vestiges. Although the information provided is unreliable,

it  sometimes  bears  a  startling  similarity  to  the  truth,  and

strange coincidences abound. Years of questioning various

vestiges about their origins have yielded many different ver-

sions of each ones story, but the binder scholars who collect

vestige legends have become adept at compiling the common

elements  and  researching  their  veracity.  In  this  way,  the

individual vestige histories have gained at least a degree of

credence.

MULTIPLE VESTIGES

As  a  binder  grows  in  power,  he  learns  how  to  bind  more

than one vestige at a time. To do so, he must go through the

ritual of drawing the seal and making a pact with each of

them separately. While bound to multiple vestiges, he gains

the full range of powers granted by all of them. The binder

shows the sign of each vestige (unless he can suppress it), and

risks being in uenced by multiple vestiges on failed binding

checks. If he ignores the in uence of more than one vestige,

the penalties stack.

VESTIGE DESCRIPTIONS

This section describes all the vestiges available to binders.

The various elements of a vestige description are described

below.

NAME

Each description begins with a header giving the vestiges

name and an epithet by which the vestige is known.

SEAL AND SUMMARY

Below  the  illustration  of  the  vestiges  seal  is  a  summary

description of its essential characteristics.

The  Seal:  In  the  process  of  summoning  a  vestige,  the

binder must draw its seal. The unique seal associated with

each vestige is displayed above the summary information.

Drawing the seal requires no skill check of any kind, but the

binder must have the means to scribe the seal visibly upon a

relatively  at surface. Many binders carry chalk or charcoal

with them for this purpose. One piece is suf cient to draw

one seal.

Vestige Level: Each vestige has a vestige level, as given in

its summary. A creature wishing to summon a vestige must

meet or exceed the effective binder level required to summon

a vestige of that level (see Table 11, page 11). Although all

vestiges  want  to  experience  reality,  some  lie  farther  out

in  the  void  than  others  and  are  more  dif cult  to  contact.

Only through extended congress with lesser vestiges can a

binder hope to summon the great entities that lie closest to

nothingness.

Binding DC: The summary for each vestige gives a bind-

ing DC for the binding check needed to make a pact with it.

In general, this DC scales with the binder level required to

summon the vestige, but certain vestiges present a greater-

than-average challenge to binders.

Special Requirement: If the vestige imposes any special

requirements on its summoning, this entry in the summary

is Yes. Otherwise, it reads No.

ROLEPLAYING THE INFLUENCE

If youre playing a binder, you will eventually come under the

influence  of  a  vestige.  Although  the  limitations  imposed  by

influence can be a hindrance, they can also make for great role-

playing opportunities. Because the emotions that a vestiges in-

fluence brings are often not typical for steely eyed adventurers,

you can explore aspects of your characters personality that you

might otherwise ignore. If you play the influences well, you can

set up a strong contrast with your characters typical behavior.

The  constraints  or  demands  that  the  influencing  vestige

places on your character provide yet another hook for roleplay-

ing. Giving in to the demands can get your character into trouble

and  force  him  to  talk  his  way  out,  or  you  can  use  them  as  a

reason  to  seek  out  or  avoid  certain  places  or  people.  Should

this aspect of the influence become too troublesome, you can

always just ignore the vestiges influence and take the penalty

that such a choice imposes.

If you find the process of roleplaying a vestiges influence fun,

remember that you can always voluntarily fail a binding check.

But be considerate of the other players at the table when making

that  choice.  Dont  use  the  influence  as  an  excuse  to  hog  the

spotlight or steer the adventure in a different direction. When

you have fun at the expense of the other players enjoyment, the

campaign is in trouble.

LEGEND

This  element  of  the  description  relates  the  origin  legend

associated  with  each  vestige.  Although  binder  scholars

point to similar legends among the general populace (and

sometimes even to historical  gures) to back up their claims,

these backgrounds are in large part apocryphal and known

only to binders. The historical information on which each

legend is based has been gathered through the years by quest-

ing for information about them. The legend detailed in this

section represents the most widely accepted version, but pact

magic grimoires differ and many theories exist. The religious

organizations and secular authorities that might be able to

offer proof one way or the other generally muddy the issue

still further, either by claiming that vestiges are unholy and

accursed beings that damn those who deal with them, or by

disavowing the creatures existence entirely.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENT

If the vestige imposes any special requirements on its sum-

moning, they are given in the next element of the description.

Special requirements vary widely depending on the nature of

the individual vestige. For example, a vestige might require

that its seal be drawn in a particular place, or that the binder

possess a certain item or attribute. If a binder does not ful ll

the vestiges special requirement, it does not manifest when

summoned, and the attempt to bind with it fails.

MANIFESTATION

Different  vestiges  take  different  forms,  but  all  manifest

(become  visible)  as  images   oating  over  their  seals.  The

image that appears is a supernatural  gmentan illusion

that cannot be dispelled, though it vanishes in an antimagic

 eld. Certain aspects of the illusion (such as wisps of fog) can

extend up to 10 feet beyond the borders of the seal, but the

vestige never leaves the area over the seal. Noises produced

by the vestige or the process of pact making can be heard

normally, according to their volume.

SIGN

A binder who makes a pact with a vestige binds his soul to it,

thereby becoming a conduit through which the vestige can

experience reality. This powerful bond cannot be broken by

any magiceven an antimagic  eld only suppresses it.

This integral link manifests on the binders person as a

physical sign peculiar to the individual vestige, as described

here. This sign is a real change rather than an illusory or

shapechanging effect, so anyone viewing the binder with

true  seeing  sees  it  just  as  it  is.  The  sign  is  a  supernatural

effect  and  therefore  is  suppressed  when  the  binding  is

suppressed.

A binder can hide a sign by either mundane or magical

means. Furthermore, a binder with the suppress sign class

feature can choose when to show a vestiges sign.

MAKING VESTIGES DIFFERENT

The vestiges in this book were designed as spirits to which a

character of any alignment might bind while still maintaining the

taboo feel that pacts with otherworldly beings carry in real-world

mythology. When using pact magic in your game, you could give

it a different place in the campaign world by changing the nature

of  the  vestiges  or  even  replacing  them  with  other  creatures.

For example, in your campaign, pact magic might be practiced

only by good creatures who make deals with celestial beings.

Alternatively, it might be wholly the province of evil or foolish

mortals who make promises to fiendish forces. Vestiges might

even be alien entities, totemic spirits, the souls of ancestors or

great heroes, or some other entities of your own creation.

Changing  the  nature  of  vestiges  might  also  necessitate

changes  to  the  binder  class.  For  instance,  if  you  replace  the

vestiges  with  saints  of  a  religious  order,  the  binder  becomes

more like a paladin. If you replace them with totemic beings, on

the other hand, the binder becomes more akin to a barbarian.

However  you  decide  to  use  pact  magic  in  your  game,  take

extra care if you decide to change the powers a vestige grants or

the influence it has on a binder. Vestige-granted powers present

far thornier balance issues than do typical game elements, such

as feats or spells. The influences were designed to strike a care-

ful balance between how often they affect play and the penalties

for ignoring them.

18

INFLUENCE

This element details the in uence that the vestige imposes

on a binder who makes a poor pact. The vestiges in uence

constantly affects the binders personality and emotions. In

addition, the vestige might require that the binder take (or

refrain from taking) some action. A binder who ignores the

wishes of a vestige that in uences him takes a 1 penalty on

attack rolls, saves, and checks until the vestige leaves.

GRANTED ABILITIES

The supernatural abilities that the vestige grants are given in

this element of its description. The following rules govern

these supernatural abilities.

All powers granted by vestiges are supernatural in origin,

even if they replicate spells or abilities that are not normally

considered magical.

Supernatural abilities are magical and thus are suppressed

in an antimagic  eld.

Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance.

Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled.

Unless  they  deal  damage,  supernatural  abilities  affect

incorporeal creatures normally. A supernatural ability that

deals damage has a 50% chance not to affect an incorporeal

target, if the source of the ability is corporeal.

Using a supernatural ability does not provoke attacks of

opportunity.

Using a supernatural ability is a standard action unless

otherwise noted.

Some  of  the  supernatural  abilities  granted  by  vestiges

provide constant bene ts once activated. If the duration

of a particular effect is not stated or implied by the ability

description, assume it is constant. Typically, binders take

a few moments to activate such abilities immediately after

making  a  pact  with  a  vestige.  Most  effects  that  are  not

constant can be used only once every 5 rounds (see the

ability description for details).

If a supernatural ability granted by a vestige mimics the

effect of a spell or shadow magic mystery, the caster level

of that ability is always equal to a binders effective binder

level.

The use of a vestige-granted power does not require a Con-

centration check unless its description speci es otherwise.

Failure on a required Concentration check ends that use of

the ability. (The DC for Concentration checks depends on the

distraction; see the Concentration skill description, PH 70).

Supernatural abilities do not have somatic or verbal compo-

nents, but certain requirements might apply to the use of

individual granted abilities. For instance, a binder using a

breath weapon must be able to open his mouth and breathe.

Similarly, a character must have a free hand to make a melee

touch attack. (In a grapple, the character makes a touch

attack as though armed with a light weapon.)

Supernatural abilities are neither arcane nor divine. Thus,

no spell failure chance applies to the use of vestige-granted

abilities by an armored binder, even when those abilities

mimic spells.

A  binder  shows  no  outward  sign  when  using  a  granted

ability, unless the ability description speci es that he must

concentrate,  or  the  use  of  the  ability  would  be  obvious

based on its description (such as a ray projecting from the

binders eyes).

When subjected to a supernatural ability that requires a

saving throw but has no obvious effect, the target feels a

hostile force or tingle but does not necessarily know the

source or nature of the attack.

Effects created by the binders supernatural abilities end

when the vestige leaves the binder, or if the binder dies

while bound.

The Dif culty Class for a saving throw against a vestige-

granted power is 10 + 1/2 effective binder level + binders

Cha modi er.

Abilities that duplicate the bene t of a feat do so even if

the recipient does not qualify for the feat.

ACERERAK, THE DEVOURER

Acererak, a half-human lich, grasped at godlike power only

to lose his grip on reality. As a vestige, he grants abilities that

are similar to a lichs powers.

Legend: Only bards and a few scholars remember Acere-

raks name, but many know the legend of his supposed  nal

resting place, the Tomb of Horrors. As rumors of the wealth

and magic hidden in this fabled location spread, the tomb

became a burial ground for more and more explorers and

tomb robbers. In truth, however, the Tomb of Horrors was

not Acereraks sepulcher at all. It was merely part of his plan

to gain eternal unlife and command of all undead.

Acererak left behind a diary, and the information it con-

tains  combined  with  the  actions  of  a  stalwart  few  have  at

last brought the full tale of Acererak to light. In his diary,

Acererak wrote that he was born of a union between a human

woman and a demon. Despite his hideous deformities, his

mother  kept  him  and  cared  for  him  until,  when  he  was

ten years of age, some superstitious villagers burned down

their house. Acererak survived the con agration because of

his demonic heritage, but his mother did not. In his diary

Acererak  recalls  that  incident  as  the  event  that  propelled

him  on  the  path  toward  necromancy  and  revenge  against

humanity.

Acererak  became  a  powerful  wizard.  As  he  grew  older

and  saw  the  specter  of  death  looming,  he  sought  out  and

completed the ritual for becoming a lich. After he assumed

his undead form, his power continued to grow for centuries

more. The diary relates, however, that Acererak eventually felt

the forces animating his undead body begin to wane. Know-

ing that  nal oblivion was near, he decided to build himself

a secret tomb. Only those of keenest luck and greatest skill

will win through to me, the diary read. There, they shall

receive a magni cent reward for their persistence.

The diary, the Tomb of Horrors, and the supposed reward

were all parts of an elaborate ruse designed to bring powerful

adventurers into the portion of the tomb that Acererakby

then a powerful demilichcalled his Fortress of Conclusion.

19

In truth, Acererak had devised a ritual that

he hoped would merge his consciousness

with the Negative Energy Plane through

the sacri ce of potent spirits. Had he actu-

ally  accomplished  this  goal,  he  could  have

assumed control of any undead on any plane

and  gained  godlike  powers  as  well  as  immortal-

ity.  But  the  infamy  of  the  Tomb  of  Horrors

drew more than wealth-hungry thrill-seekers

intent on gaining the reward promised in

Acereraks diary. Supplicants also came.

Necromancers questing for knowledge,

seekers of eternal life, and lost souls in

search of purpose traveled to the tomb to

learn what they could of the dark arts. In

time,  the  supplicants  became  worshipers,

and they stayed to dwell near the object of their

devotion.  Eventually,  a  settlement  called  Skull

City sprang up around the entrance to Acereraks

Tomb of Horrors.

Some of the heroes Acererak lured to his tomb

proved even more powerful and ingenious than he

had  anticipated.  After   ghting  their

way through Skull City and the Tomb

of  Horrors,  they  made  their  way  to

the demilichs Fortress of Conclusion.

At the last possible moment, they sur-

mised Acereraks plan and destroyed

the artifact that was crucial to his apo-

theosis.  They  struck  down  Acererak

and shattered his phylactery.

Normally, such an action would have

sent Acereraks spirit to Abyss, but the

worship of the Skull City residents lent

him a semblance of divinity; his desire

to  merge  with  the  Negative  Energy

Plane proved stronger than the pull of

the Abyss. Unfortunately for Acererak,

souls  do  not  travel  to  the  Negative

Energy  Plane  upon  death.  Since  his

spirit had no clear destination, it went

nowhere, becoming a vestige divorced

from all planes.

Sign: A gem replaces one of your teeth. If removed,

the  gem  reverts  to  a  normal  tooth,  and  a  new  gem

appears in its place.

In  uence:  As  a  vestige,  Acererak  possesses  the

immortality  he  desired  but  none  of  the  power

that should accompany it. If you fall under his

in uence, you evince a strong hunger for in u-

ence and primacy. If you are presented with an

opportunity to  ll a void in power over a group

of creatures, Acererak requires that you attempt

to  seize  that  power.  You  might  impersonate  a

missing  city  of cial,  take  command  of  a

leaderless  unit  of  soldiers,  or  even  grab

the reins of runaway horses to establish

your supremacy.

Granted  Abilities:  While  bound  to

Acererak,  you  gain  powers  that  the  great

lich held in his legendary unlife.

Detect Undead: You can use detect undead as

the spell at will (caster level equals your effective

binder level).

Hide from Undead: At will as a standard action, you

can  become  undetectable  to  undead.

This ability functions like the hide from

undead  spell,  except  that  the  DC  for

intelligent undead to ignore the effect

and notice you is 10 + 1/2 your effective

Lichs  Energy  Immunities:  You  gain

immunity  to  cold  and  electricity

damage.

Paralyzing  Touch:  As  a  standard

action,  you  can  make  a  touch  attack

to paralyze a living foe. The touched

creature must succeed on a Fortitude

save or be paralyzed for a number of

rounds equal to one-half your effective

binder level. Each round on its turn,

the  paralyzed  creature  can  attempt

a  new  saving  throw  as  a  full-round

action, with success ending the effect

immediately.  Once  you  have  used

this ability, you cannot do so again for

Special Requirement: You must place a gem about the

size of a human tooth or eye in the center of Acereraks seal.

This  gem  is  not  used  up  in  the  summoning  process,  nor

does it move from where you placed it, despite the manner

in which Acererak manifests (see Manifestation, below).

Manifestation:  The  gem  you  placed  within  the  seal

appears to  oat up into the air to the height of your head. Dust

swirls in from the surrounding air and up from the ground

to coalesce about the gem, forming a yellowed human skull

with the jewel as a tooth or an eye. A moment later, other

gems wink into being, so that each eye socket and the space of

every tooth is occupied by a shining diamond, ruby, emerald,

or sapphire. The jewels glow brie y with an inner light, and

then Acererak speaks, his dry voice  lled with contempt.

5 rounds.

Speak with Dead: You can question the dead at will as though

using the speak with dead spell (caster level equals your effec-

tive binder level; save DC 10 + 1/2 your effective binder level

+ your Cha modi er).

Undead Healing: Negative energy (such as that of an in ict

spell) heals you rather than damaging you. If you are a living

creature, positive energy (such as a cure spell) still heals you

as well.

to  weaken  foes

prone, but he also

makes  his  sum-

moner  fearless

and able to speak

any tongue.

Legend:  In

life, Agares ruled

over  vast  armies

on the Elemental

Plane  of  Earth.

He was the most

powerful general

the plane had yet

seen and second

in

authority

only to his genie

emperor, a dao of

great in uence. Even though Agares was unalterably loyal, he

nevertheless gave his emperor reason to fear betrayal. Agares

became obsessed with a djinni commander who had thwarted

his conquests on several occasions. His desire to meet this

favored foe on the  eld of battle blinded him to other tactical

options and deafened him to rumors that his esteem for his

enemy had deepened into love. When at last Agares entrapped

the djinnis forces, he girded himself for personal combat

and set out to answer a challenge to duel his adversary. The

summons was a trap laid by Agaress lieutenants, however;

his allies slew him within sight of his greatest enemy.

Requirement: Yes

Requirement: Yes

Special Requirement: You must draw Agaress seal upon

either the earth or an expanse of unworked stone.

Manifestation: The ground trembles brie y as the head

of a great brown crocodile bursts from beneath Agaress seal.

The  crocodiles  maw  opens  upward,  unleashing  a  hooded

black hawk that spreads its wings, forcing the jaws farther

apart with the mere brush of its feathers. Two large, catlike

eyes gleam on the hawks breast. When Agares speaks, the

hawks beak moves, but the sound comes from the crocodiles

rumbling throat.

Sign: You gain a wracking cough that spews dust and small

stones from your mouth. This coughing prevents you from

casting any spells that have verbal components. While bound

to Agares, you can resist the urge to cough for a number of

rounds equal your Constitution score. Thereafter, you cough

for a round and then can try to resist the urge again.

In  uence:  Agaress  loyalty  in  life  and  his  anger  at  the

betrayal perpetrated by his lieutenants has become a hatred

of falsehood. When in uenced by Agares, you speak forth-

rightly and with con dence. You cannot use the Bluff skill,

and when asked a direct question, you must answer truth-

fully and directly.

Granted Abilities: Agares gives you the power to exalt

yourself and your allies, to make the earth tremble beneath

your feet, to render foes weak, and to speak the truth to all

peoples.

Earth and Air Mastery: You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls

and weapon damage rolls if both you and your foe are touch-

ing the ground. Any airborne foe takes a 1 penalty on attack

rolls and weapon damage rolls against you.

Earthshaking Step: As a standard action, you can stomp on

the ground, causing every creature within 10 feet of you that

is either standing or climbing on a surface connected with

the ground to make a Re ex save or fall prone. Once you have

used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds. You

and your summoned earth elemental (see below) are never

knocked prone by the use of this ability.

Elemental Companion: You can summon an earth elemental

to accompany you and  ght for you. This creature obeys your

commands to the best of its ability. If the elemental is more

than 30 feet away from you at the end of your turn, it dissolves.

If you lose your elemental to dissolution or destruction, you

cannot summon it again for 1 hour.

The size of the earth elemental you can summon depends on

your effective binder level, as given on the following table.

Fear Immunity: You have immunity to fear from both magi-

cal and mundane sources.

True Speech: You can speak, understand, read, and write all

languages spoken by creatures within 30 feet of you. To use

an unfamiliar language, you must hear it spoken and see the

speaker. Once you have used it, you can continue to do so

for as long as your pact with Agares lasts. When speaking or

writing in a language with which you are not familiar, you

cannot lie.

AMON,

THE VOID BEFORE THE ALTAR

Although Amon once ruled as a deity of light and justice, his

long existence as a vestige has twisted him into a monster

consumed by wrath. He grants those who summon him his

sight, his  ery breath, and his powerful charge.

Legend: Scholars claim that Amon is what remains of the

personality of a god who died of neglect millennia ago. Once

worshiped by thousands, Amon eventually lost his faithful to

more responsive deities. His will was strong enough, though,

to resist eternal sleep on the Astral Plane. Since his demise,

his  half-existence  as  a  vestige  seems  to  have  dramatically

changed his appearance and personality. Once a calm and

wise protector, a god of light and law, Amon is now a foul-

tempered and hateful spirit.

Special Requirement: Amon particularly despises four

other vestiges: Chupoclops, Eurynome, Karsus, and Leraje. If

you have hosted one of these spirits within the last 24 hours,

Amon refuses to answer your call. Similarly, these spirits will

not answer your call if you are already bound to Amon. The

reason for Amons displeasure with these vestiges is unclear,

but the enmity is as old as anyone can

remember.  Binder  scholars  theorize

that  it  might  stem  from  the  time

when Amon was a god and the other

four were normal mortal or immortal

beings.

Manifestation: Amon manifests in

a  burst  of  black  smoke,  howling  foul

curses at his summoner. He possesses

a black wolfs body with a rams head

and a serpent for a tail. His mouth is

 lled with sharp teeth, and  re escapes

it when he speaks.

Sign:  You  grow  a  rams  curling

horns.

In  uence: Amons in uence makes

you  surly  and  irritable.  In  addition,

since Amon despises living deities of

 re, sun, and law, he forces you to resist

even bene cial spells cast by those devoted to such powers.

You must make a saving throw to resist such a spell if one is

allowed; failure allows you to gain the bene t.

Granted  Abilities:  Amon  grants  you  his  sight  and  his

breath, as well as the deadly use of his horns.

Darkvision: You gain darkvision out to 60 feet.

Fire Breath: You can vomit forth a line of  re as a standard

action.  The  line  extends  10  feet  per  effective  binder  level

(maximum 50 feet) and deals 1d6 points of  re damage per

binder level to every creature in its area. A successful Re ex

save halves this damage. Once you have used this ability, you

cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Ram  Attack:  You  can  use  the  rams  horns  that  you  gain

from Amons sign as a natural weapon that deals 1d6 points

of  damage  (plus  1-1/2  times  your  Strength  bonus).  When

you charge a foe with your ram attack, you deal an extra 1d8

points of damage on a successful hit. You cannot use this

ability if you do not show Amons sign.

After  nearly  three  hundred  years

of almost constant battle on behalf of

both good and evil, Andras grew tired

of both causes. In the midst of a duel in

the key battle of a great war, he simply

dropped his weapon and left, never to

be seen alive again. Sages speculate that

after his betrayal of both causes, he was

no longer welcome in any gods realm,

and thus his soul was condemned to

become a vestige.

Manifestation: Andras rides up out

of nothingness on the back of a great

black wolf. The vestiges head is that of

an owl covered in gray feathers, and his

gray-skinned body resembles that of a

lanky but muscular male elf. Wearing

only a loincloth, Andras slouches in his

saddle, holding the reins of his mount

in one hand and a greatsword, which he lazily rests on his

shoulder, in the other. At  rst glance, Andras looks as though

he might be asleep, but a closer inspection reveals a pair of

huge golden eyes that glower from his bowed head. Andras

speaks in deep tones laden with menace.

Sign: You sprout two useless, gray-feathered wings from

your back. The wings are small enough to be hidden beneath

a  shirt  or  cloak,  but  doing  so  makes  you  appear  hunch-

backed.

In  uence:  Andrass  in uence  causes  you  to  become

listless and emotionally remote. Because Andras wearies of

combat quickly, you must drop any items in hand and with-

draw from melee after only 10 rounds of battle. You may not

take any offensive action for 1d4 rounds thereafter.

Granted Abilities: Andras lends you some of the skills he

had in life, making you a strong combatant with or without

a mount.

Weapon Pro ciency: You are pro cient with the greatsword,

lance, longsword, and rapier.

ANDRAS,

THE GRAY KNIGHT

A  great  warrior  in  life,  Andras  is  an

enigma as a vestige. He gives binders

prowess  in  combat  and  skill  in  the

saddle.

Legend: Andras was once an elf pala-

din famed for his prowess in battle and

his implacable dedication to doing what

was right and good for all. A series of

misjudgments and misfortunes broke

Andrass faith in both himself and his

deity, however, and he became a black-

guard. During his subsequent service

to  the  dark  gods,  his  infamy  rapidly

outgrew  his  fame,  and  his  name  was

whispered in fear.

Mount:  As  a  full-round  action,  you

creature serves you as a trained mount

for  up  to  1  hour  per  effective  binder

level, or until it is killed, you dismiss

it, or your pact with Andras ends. You

can use this ability once per day.

Saddle Sure: You gain a +8 bonus on

Ride checks.

Smite Good or Evil: You can attempt

to smite an evil or good creature with

a  single  melee  attack.  You  add  your

Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack

roll and deal 1 extra point of damage

per effective binder level. If you acci-

dentally smite a creature that is neither

good nor evil, the attempt has no effect.

Once  you  have  used  this  ability,  you

22

cannot do so again for 5 rounds. Smite evil and smite good

attempts per day obtained from multiple sources stack.

Sow Discord: Andras grants you the ability to sow discord

among your enemies. As a standard action, you can force an

enemy to attack a randomly determined ally within reach

on his next action, and he must do so as his  rst attack. The

target must be within 5 feet per two binder levels you possess,

and a successful Will save negates the effect. The affected

foe must strike for lethal damage with a primary attack and

use whatever melee weapon is in hand (or an unarmed strike

or natural attack if no weapon is at the ready). If no ally is

within the foes reach, this ability has no effect. Sow discord

is a mind-affecting compulsion ability. Once you have used

this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Sure Blows: You gain the bene t of the Improved Critical

feat  with  any  weapon  you  wield.  If  you  already  have  the

Improved Critical feat with a weapon, you gain a +4 bonus

on the roll to con rm a threat made with that weapon. This

bonus stacks with that provided by the Power Critical feat

(see Complete Divine, page 103).

ANDROMALIUS,

THE REPENTANT ROGUE

Once the favorite of the god Olidammara, Andromalius now

exists as a vestige. His granted abilities help his summoners

beat rogues and neer-do-wells at their own game.

Legend: Once the herald of Olidammara, Andromalius

foreswore theft and mischief on his deathbed, repenting all

the actions he had taken on behalf of his god during his life.

By this means, he hoped to steal his soul from his deity, thus

accomplishing his greatest theft and prank in history, and

proving himself the most worthy of his gods favor.

At  rst angered by Andromaliuss betrayal, Olidammara

quickly  realized  the  irony  of  the  moment  and  burst  into

laughter. Yet the gods good humor was short-lived, because

he realized that to accept Andromaliuss soul would be to

prevent the theft and ruin the joke. Since Olidammara was

loath to let such a clever servant to go to the realm of some

other god, he repaid his servants honor a hundredfoldhe

stole Andromaliuss soul from the cosmos, making it a ves-

tige. Whether Andromalius deemed this result an honor or

not remains unclear.

Special  Requirement:  You  must  obtain  two  different

nonmagical items similar to those that Andromalius holds

in his hands when he manifests and place them within the

con nes of his seal when you summon him. These items

vanish as soon as Andromalius appears.

Manifestation: Andromalius appears as a middle-aged

but lithe human male in the garb of a jester. Each of his arms

splits at the elbow into a dozen forearms, and he holds a small

object in each of his twenty-four hands. Though his costume

and overall appearance change from one manifestation to

another,  the  speci c  collection  of  objects  never  doesa

fact that has sparked a long-standing debate among binder

scholars. The items are: a belt purse, a silver key, a gold ring, a

pair of dice, a copper coin, a dagger, an apple, an arm bone, a

a  dead  spider,  an  oak  leaf,  a  human  skull,  a  lock,  a  closed

black book, a bell, a dove, a set of lock picks, and a mouse.

When  Andromalius  returns  whence  he  came,  he  juggles

these illusory items and then tosses one to his summoner.

Some scholars claim that the item thrown indicates a future

event, but that the speci c meaning depends on which other

objects are held in the hands of that same arm.

Sign: You gain an extra digit on each limb. This append-

age prevents you from wearing normal gloves or gauntlets,

but magic gloves and gauntlets reshape to  t you.

In  uence: When in uenced by Andromalius, you become

a devious mischief-maker who delights in causing small ca-

lamitiesespecially misunderstandings between friends and

incidents of mistaken identity. However, Andromalius can-

not now abide acts of theft, so he forbids you to steal from a

creature, take an item from a dead body, or remove someone

ANDROMALIUS

Locate Item: At will, you can sense the direction of any well-

known or clearly visualized object that lies within 100 feet

per effective binder level of your location. If you wish to  nd

a speci c object, this ability works only if you have seen the

object  rsthand and can accurately visualize its peculiarities.

Otherwise,  the

direction  of  the

nearest object of

the same type is

revealed. You can

sense  the  direc-

tion of only one

item each round.

This ability does

not  reveal  the

direction  to  a

such  as  a  secret

Sneak Attack: You deal an extra 2d6 points of damage when

 anking an opponent or at any time when the target would

be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to

ranged attacks only if the opponent is within 30 feet. For

every  ve effective binder levels you possess beyond 5th, your

sneak attack damage increases by an additional 1d6 points.

For example, a 15th-level binder deals an extra 4d6 points

of damage with his sneak attack. See the rogue class feature

bonus from another source, the bonuses to damage stack.

AYM, QUEEN AVARICE

Once a monarch of dwarves, Aym allowed her greed to bring

an  end  to  her  empire.  As  a  vestige,  she  gives  her  host  the

ability to wear armor without impedance, to set objects and

creatures alight with a touch, to resist the effects of  re, and

to shatter objects with heavy blows.

Legend:  Dwarven  legends  depict  Aym  as  the  greediest

dwarf queen who ever lived. Modern-day dwarves still spit at

the mention of her name. Not long after Moradin  rst forged

the dwarves, Aym arose as a great leader among them. Greed

brought  her  to  power,  and  greed  consumed  her  while  she

ruled. Dwarves mined furiously in response to Ayms constant

demand for more gems and precious metals, and her people

became virtual slaves to their work. As onerous as Ayms rule

was, however, all this mining greatly expanded the dwarves

territory, and many dwarven clans grew quite wealthy.

Jealous of the dwarves wealth and smarting from their

conquests, a great horde of orcs, giants, and goblinoids banded

into an army to assault Ayms kingdom. The dwarves fought

bravely, but because their forces were stretched so thin across

Ayms empire, they could not respond quickly enough to the

hordes concentrated assault on their capital. Legend has it

that when the  res of the burning city reached her, Aym stood

among a hundred wagons laden with gold that her servants

had loaded in preparation for her  ight. But so engrossed

was  she  in  counting  the  coins  to  make  certain  she  didnt

lose a copper that she didnt notice the danger until the  res

began to melt the coins in her grasp. Rather than repenting

her greed at the point of her death, Aym cursed Moradin for

not protecting her, and in return, Moradin cursed her.

Manifestation: Aym arises from a coiled heap within the

seal. She has two great worms for legs and three headsone

a lions, one a female dwarfs, and one a bulls. Her powerfully

muscled torso strains beneath the  nery of an empress, and

her  ngers glitter with more than a dozen jeweled rings. In

one hand she holds a red-hot, star-shaped branding iron, and

with the other, she holds shut the lion heads mouth. Aym

as you choose) to every dwarf you meet within 10 rounds of

BALAM, THE BITTER ANGEL

Once a being of extreme goodness, Balam became a wrath-

ful vestige after taking on an impossible task that ended in

failure. She grants her summoners the ability to foresee future

dif culties and the intellect to interpret what they see, as well

as skill with light arms and a stare that chills  esh.

BALAM

BALAM

Legend:  Binder  scholars  claim  that  Balam  is  all  that

remains of the soul of a powerful solar. Exactly how she came

to exist in her current state remains a mystery, but sources

of planar lore state that several good gods tasked her with

eliminating the practice of sacri cing sentient beings in the

worship of deities. Since such sacri ces are part and parcel

of evil rituals, the task amounted to wiping out the worship

of evil gods altogethera task well beyond what even the

good  deities  could  manage.  Needless  to  say,  Balam  failed

in her assignment, and some believe that her foes actually

sacri ced her in praise of a dark god.

Special Requirement: Balam requires a sacri ce of her

summoner. In the process of calling her, you must deal 1 point

of slashing damage to yourself or another sentient creature

(one with Int 3 or higher) and place a drop of blood from the

wound within Balams completed seal.

Manifestation: Balam is a horror to behold. Her body

is  that  of  a  great  purple  serpent,  and  her  head  consists  of

the  top  halves

of three horned

humanoid heads

arranged evenly

around a shared

gaping  maw.

This  mouth  is

a

tooth-stud-

ded  chute  that

extends  deep

into  her  body,

and  her

six

horns point for-

ward  around  it.

Balam speaks in

a grinding moan,

exhaling  hot,

stinking  breath

with each word.

The fangs in her

chute-mouth  move  in  waves  with  the  shuddering  of  her

throat, and the eyes of her three heads glow blue when she

becomes excited or angry.

Sign: Your voice gains a peculiar quality, becoming both

hollow and guttural.

In  uence: Balams in uence causes you to distrust clerics,

paladins, and other devotees of deities. Whenever you enter a

temple or some other holy or unholy site, Balam requires that

you spit on the  oor and utter an invective about the place.

Granted Abilities: Balam grants you the power to predict

future events. She also teaches cunning and  nesse, and gives

you the ability to freeze foes with a glance.

Balams Cunning: You can reroll one attack, saving throw,

or skill check you have just made. You must accept the result

of the reroll, even if it is worse than the original. Once you

have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

BUER, GRANDMOTHER HUNTRESS

Buer grants binders superior healing as well as powers against

poisons and diseases.

BUERBUER

Legend: Buer tells many different stories about how she

came to be a vestige, so her true origins remain obscure. In

various  popular  versions  of  the  tales,

she is a beautiful elf maiden who fell

to evil satyrs, a virtuous human rang-

er killed by a chimera, or a green hag

slain by a lammasu. Its likely that Buer

herself cannot remember who she was

in life or what brought her to her cur-

rent state, and the stories she tells are

cobbled  together  from  the  shreds  of

her  memory  that  remain.  Regardless

of what her true form once was, most

binders believe that she possessed great

skill as a hunter and healer in life.

Special  Requirement:  Buer

requires  that  her  seal  be  drawn  out-

doors.

Manifestation: Buers form is that

of a  ve-branched star, or wheel, com-

posed of satyr legs. She has two faces,

one  positioned  on  each  side  of  her

wheel-shaped body at the center point where the  ve legs

meet. One face is that of a green hag, and the other is a rag-

ing, leonine visage with an unruly mane and beard. Buer

constantly moves within her seal, rolling from foot to foot

as she traverses its circumference. She always keeps her rag-

ing face outward, but she speaks from her green hag face in a

friendly manner with a gentle voice. When her body rolls in

such a way that her hag face cannot see her summoner, Buer

grows frustrated and begins yelling curses at her body.

Buers Purity: You have immunity to disease and poison,

and making a pact with Buer removes any existing disease

and neutralizes any poison that af icts you.

Delay Diseases and Poisons: Each ally within 30 feet of you

gains temporary immunity to poison and disease. Allies with-

in the area make saving throws against disease and poison

effects normally, but they do not incur the effects of failure

as long as they stay within 30 feet of you. An ally that leaves

the area immediately suffers all the ef-

fects for any missed saves.

Fast Healing: You gain the fast healing

1, and the rate of healing increases with

your effective binder level. You gain fast

healing 2 at 10th level, fast healing 3 at

13th level, fast healing 4 at 16th level,

and fast healing 5 at 19th level.

Healing  Gift:  As  a  standard  action,

you  can  cure  1  point  of  damage  to

yourself or another creature. As a full-

round action, you can cure 1d8 points

of damage +1 point per effective binder

level (maximum 1d8+10 points). Either

version  requires  that  you  touch  the

creature to be cured. If you use the full-

round cure ability, you cannot use your

healing  gift  again  for  5  rounds.  The

other version is usable at will. Both uses

of the ability channel positive energy

and  deal  a  corresponding  amount  of

damage to undead.

Track: You can track foes as though you possessed the

Track feat.

CHUPOCLOPS,

HARBINGER OF FOREVER

A great monster believed to be a harbinger of the apocalypse,

Chupoclops became a vestige when slain by mortals. Chu-

poclops grants its summoner a poisoned bite and unnatural

senses, plus the ability to pounce on foes, to exist ethereally,

and to make enemies despair.

Legend: Chupoclops once stood tall in the company of

Fenris, Dendar the Night Serpent, and other supposed har-

bingers of the end of existence. A titanic spiderlike creature,

Chupoclops  stalked  the  Ethereal  Plane,  devouring  ghosts

and giving birth to mortals nightmares. Legend has it that

the gods trapped the monstrous Chupoclops in the realm of

ghosts to prevent it from devouring hope, but it was destined

to escape and sate its hunger during the end times.

Because Chupoclops was a terror to both the living and the

undead, several powerful individuals eventually joined forces

to  ght it. Three were great heroes, and four were powerful

villains. Four of these sevenone of the heroes and three of

Sign: Your feet turn into satyrs hooves, giving you a curi-

ous tip-toeing gait. These hooves prevent you from wearing

normal boots or shoes, but magic footwear reshapes to  t

you.

In  uence: Under Buers in uence, you are plagued by

momentary memory lapses. For an instant, you might forget

even a piece of information as familiar as the name of a friend

or family member. Furthermore, since Buer abhors the need-

less death of living creatures other than animals and vermin,

the  rst melee attack you make against such a foe must be

for nonlethal damage. In addition, Buer requires that you not

make any coup de grace attacks.

Granted Abilities: Buer grants you healing powers, the

ability to ignore toxins and ailments, and skills that help you

navigate the natural world.

corpse in the misty Ethereal Plane. Now that the monster

can no longer destroy hope, some say it will exist forever, and

Special Requirement: You must draw Chupoclopss seal

with a handful of soil from a grave or tomb. Alternatively, you

can place the dead body of a sentient creature (one with Int 3

or higher) over its seal before the summoning begins. In addi-

tion, Chupoclops hates Amon for some unknown reason and

will not answer your call if you are already bound to him.

Manifestation: Chupoclops appears over its seal in the

form of a Colossal phase spider. However, only the part of its

body directly over its seal is visible at any given time. In most

cases, Chupoclops  rst appears as a massive spider leg strik-

ing out of nowhere into the center of the seal. Then it shifts

its body, slowly bringing its face into view and down to the

level of its summoner. Glaring over its oddly tusked arachnid

visage from eight all-too-human eyes, Chupoclops rumbles

an ominous growl to begin the process of pact making.

Sign:  Your  lower  jaw  increases  in  size,  and  two  long,

sharply pointed tusks grow upward from it.

In  uence: While under the in uence of Chupoclops, you

cant help but be pessimistic. At best, you are quietly resigned

to your own failure, and at worst, you spread your doubts to

others, trying to convince them of the hopelessness of their

goals. In addition, Chupoclops requires that you voluntarily

fail all saving throws against fear effects or any effect that

imposes a morale penalty.

Granted Abilities: Chupoclops gives you the power to

linger on the Ethereal Plane, sense the living and undead,

demoralize foes, and poison enemies.

Aura of Despair: Every creature within 10 feet of you takes a

2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, saves, and weapon damage

rolls. You can suppress or activate this ability as a standard

action. Aura of despair is a mind-affecting fear ability.

Ethereal Watcher: At will as a move action, you can become

ethereal (as if using the ethereal jaunt spell; caster level equals

your effective binder level). You can remain on the Ethereal

Plane inde nitely if you take no actions, but you return to

the Material Plane immediately after taking a move action,

a  standard  action,  or  a  full-round  action.  Once  you  have

returned to the Material Plane, you cannot use this ability

again for 5 rounds.

Ghost  Touch:  Your  melee  attacks  can  strike  incorporeal

creatures, and their normal 50% chance to avoid damage does

not apply to your melee attacks.

the strength and type of their life forces automatically, as if

you had cast deathwatch. This ability is continuously active

DAHLVER-NAR,

THE TORTURED ONE

Once a human binder, Dahlver-Nar now grants powers just

as other vestiges do. He gives his summoners tough skin,

a frightening moan, protections against madness, and the

ability to share injuries with allies.

Legend: Bards tell two stories of Dahlver-Nar, both linked

to the magic items that carry his namethe teeth of Dahlver-

Nar. Some say that because Dahlver-Nar was antiquitys most

powerful cleric, his followers treated his teeth as holy relics

after his death and they somehow gained magical powers

through this veneration. Others insist that Dahlver-Nar was

a cleric of little consequence who discovered some magic

dragon teeth in the ruins of a red dragons lair. In this version

of the story, the teeth were named after Dahlver-Nar because

he became a terror in the region where he acquired them.

Binder scholars know a different storythat Dahlver-Nar

was a powerful cleric who forsook his deity to pursue the

power of pact magic. The fabled teeth of Dahlver-Nar, to which

all  the  legends  attribute  miraculous  powers,  were  neither

his own nor those of the dragon he battled. They were the

teeth of beings that became vestiges after death, and they

27

could grant abilities similar to those that the

vestiges  themselves  imparted.  Pact  magic

treatises  relate  that  Dahlver-Nar  pulled

out his own teeth and replaced them with

those of the vestiges, but that using them

all  drove  him  mad.  What  happened

thereafter is a matter of debate, but

the texts maintain that Dahlver-Nar

eventually  died,  and  the  teeth

were  lost,  divided  up  among

the squabbling followers he had

managed to gain and then spread

across the world. Today, Dahlver-

Nar exists as a vestige in his own

rightperhaps  brought  to  that

state through his close association

with so many others.

Manifestation: Dahlver-Nars

frightful apparition  oats in the

air above his seal, with arms and

legs  hanging  limply.  Teeth  and

fangs  of  all  kinds  stud  his  entire

body,  replacing  even  his  eyes.

What skin is visible between the

teeth appears to be the moist, pink

 esh of gums. Dahlver-Nars mouth is

a  bloody  ruin  that  clearly  lacks  teeth,

and when he opens it to speak, only a moan

issues forth. Some binders believe that his

vestige form is a punishment in icted

by the other vestiges, but others insist

that he appears as he does because of

his everlasting obsession with the teeth

that bear his name.

Mad Soul: Binding to Dahlver-Nar grants you

immunity  to  Wisdom  damage,  Wisdom  drain,

madness, insanity, and confusion effects.

Maddening  Moan:  You  can  emit  a  frightful

moan as a standard action. Every creature within

a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save

or be dazed for 1 round. Once you have

used this ability, you cannot do so

again  for  5  rounds.  Maddening

moan  is  a  mind-affecting  sonic

ability.

Natural  Armor:  You  gain  an

enhancement bonus to your natural

armor equal to one-half your Consti-

tution bonus (if any).

Shield  Self:  At  will  as  a  standard

action, you can designate one creature

within 10 feet per effective binder level

to share the damage you take. As long

as the subject creature remains within

range, you take only half damage from

all effects that deal hit point damage,

and it takes the rest. The effect ends

immediately if you designate another

creature or if either you or the subject

dies. Any damage dealt to you after the

effect ends is no longer split between you and the

subject, but damage already split is not reassigned

to you. You can affect one creature at a time with this

ability. An unwilling target of this ability can attempt

a Will save to negate the effect.

distraction to extreme focus and back

again.  Sometimes  you  stare  blankly

off into space, and at other times you

gaze  intently  at  the  person  or  task

at  hand.  Since  Dahlver-Nar  dislikes

any  task  that  requires  more  than

1  round  of  concentration  (such  as

some spellcasting, concentration on

an effect, or any action that requires

a Concentration check), he requires

that you undertake no such activities

Legend:  Binders  know  little  of

how  Dantalion  came  to  be.  The  most

common legend of his origin presents

him not as one spirit, but as a conglom-

In  uence: Dantalions in uence causes you to be aloof

about the leaders of the day, so anytime you are within 100

feet of someone who clearly is (or professes to be) a leader of

success  or  failure,  you  need  not  try  to  read  that  persons

mind reader should learn a brief description of its emotional

and alert, angry and plotting, skeptical and cautious, and

so on. The mind reader can also determine the targets aware-

ness of other allies and enemies in the vicinity.

any hostile action, such as making an attack roll or casting

an offensive spell against the affected creature or its allies,

the effect ends. Once you have used this ability, you cannot

do so again for 5 rounds.

Dantalion Knows: While bound to Dantalion, you have a

+8 bonus on Knowledge checks. This ability does not allow

you to make Knowledge checks untrained.

Read  Thoughts:  At  will  as  a  full-round  action,  you  can

attempt to read the surface thoughts of any creature you can

instinctual thoughts that you can pick up. If you attempt to

points higher than your own, you automatically fail and are

load) to any location you can see that is within 5 feet per effec-

tive binder level you possess. The desired location cannot be

within an object or beyond a barrier unless you have some

means of seeing the exact space you desire to occupy. If you

cannot  occupy  the  designated  space  because  it  contains  a

solid body inside which you cannot exist (for example, if an

invisible creature is in the square, or some magic in that loca-

tion prevents dimensional travel, or the like), the attempt to

travel fails and you are stunned for 1 round. Otherwise, you

always arrive at the exact location desired. You cannot use

this ability while blinded. Thought travel is a teleportation

effect and is usable a number of times per day equal to your

effective binder level. Once you have used this ability, you

cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

draconic minions against the followers

of both the human and the elven deities,

demanding that they release his soul to

her.  Despite  Eligors  great  service  to

both races, the deities gave up his soul

to stave off the dragon attacks against

their living followers.

Only one deity argued against this

profound injustice. The race and gender

of this lone voice of reason differ with

the teller, and not even binder scholars

agree on whether the deity was human

or elf, or even male or female. Whoev-

er it was, this god set off alone to face

Tiamat and wrest Eligors soul from

her grasp. Upon arrival, however, the

deity  found  Eligor  in  the  service  of

Tiamat rather than in bondage. Un-

beknownst to the other gods, Tiamat

had raised him from death to be her

champion  and  enforcer,  using  his

abandonment  by  the  other  gods  to

win his loyalty. Eligor and the name-

less  deity  fought,  and  Eligor

lost  his  life  yet  again.

This time, no deity laid

claim to his soul, since

doing  so  had  already

caused enough trouble.

Manifestation:  Eligor  clatters

out  of  nothingness  on  a  winged,

half-horse/half-dragon monstrosity.

Both  rider  and  mount  are  heavily

armored,  and  in  fact  Eligors  form

is entirely obscured by ornate, shin-

ing plate armor and a grand helm.

He carries a lance in one hand and

holds  a  banner  in  the  other.  With

each manifestation, Eligors banner

and  mount  change  color,  cycling

through  the   ve  different  colors

of  chromatic  dragons.  Although

Eligor rides what might well be an

evil  creature,  he  always  greets  his

summoner  warmly  and  treats  him

with respect.

Sign: One of your hands becomes

thickly scaled. The color of the scales

matches the color of Eligors mount

at the time of his summoning.

Granted Abilities: In his  rst life, Eligor

was a skilled horseman, and in his second,

he  served  the  primary  deity  of  chromatic

dragons. Thus, the powers he grants tend to

re ect those associations.

Chromatic  Strike:  As  a  free  action,  you

can charge a melee attack (or melee touch

attack) with acid, cold, electricity, or  re.

Your next melee attack deals an extra 1d6

points of damage of the chosen energy type.

You  can  charge  a  single  melee  attack  only

once.

Eligors  Skill  in  the  Saddle:  You  gain  the

bene ts of the Ride-By Attack and Spirited

Charge feats.

Eligors Strength: You gain a +4 bonus to

Strength.

Eligors  Resilience:  You  gain  a  +3

enhancement bonus to natural armor.

This  bonus  improves  to  +4  at  16th

level and to +5 at 20th level.

EURYNOME,

MOTHER OF

THE MATERIAL

Eurynome grants lordship

over the water and the beasts of land,

seas, and air. She also gives those with

whom she binds some of the might of

titans.

Legend:  Stories  say  that  before

recorded  time,  the  gods  and  titans

battled  on  the  Outer  Planes.  Tired  of

the struggle, the titan Eurynome  ed

to the roiling chaos that made up the

Material Plane. She divided the world

into sky and sea, and then she danced

alone  upon  the  waves.  Incensed  by

her impertinence in meddling with a

world as yet unformed, the gods struck

Eurynome down. Angered by her aban-

donment of their  ght, her fellow titans

refused to come to her aid. Eurynomes

body became the  rst island, her blood

became  the   rst  river,  and  her  soul

became a vestige.

Special  Requirement:  Eurynome

hates Amon for some unknown reason and will not answer

your call if you are already bound to him.

Manifestation: If Eurynomes myth is true, she has fallen

far since battling gods and shaping the deeps and the  rma-

ment. Eurynome manifests as a horrid conglomeration of

humanoid, avian, and piscine forms. Her arms are octopus

tentacles, her legs are those of a hawk, and her mouth is an

In  uence: You feel pity for all outcasts, particularly half-

elves and half-orcs, and you make every effort to befriend

any such beings you meet. Because Eligor desires revenge

on  the  deities  who  abandoned  him,  he  requires  that  you

attack a human, elf, or dragon foe in preference to all others

whenever you enter combat.

owls beak. Wings shaped like great  sh  ns extend from

her back, and she has no eyesonly lampreylike mouths

where her visual orbs should be.

Sign:  Your  skin  becomes  clammy,  and  you  leave  moist

prints  on  any  object  your  body  touches,  even  if  clothing

blocks direct contact. These marks evaporate after about 1

minute.

In  uence:  Eurynomes  in uence  makes  you  paranoid

and ungrateful; you see secret motives and possible betrayals

behind every action. Eurynome requires that you not attack a

foe unless an ally has already done so. If no allies are present,

she makes no such requirement.

Granted Abilities: Eurynome grants you the ability to

befriend animals, walk on water, and wield a massive hammer.

In addition, she turns your blood into poison and gives you

resistance to weapon blows.

Animal Friend: All animals automatically have an initial

attitude of friendly toward you.

Damage Reduction: You gain damage reduction 2/lawful.

Eurynomes  Maul:  As  a  swift  action,  you  can  summon  a

Large  magic  warhammer  (2d6  damage,  3  crit).  You  are

pro cient with this weapon and can wield it in one hand

without penalty. Your warhammers exact bonus and abili-

ties depend on your effective binder level, according to the

following table.

The warhammer disappears (until you summon it again) if

it leaves your grasp for more than 1 round.

Poison Blood: While you are bound to Eurynome, your blood

becomes poisonous. Any creature that ingests it (by either

making a bite attack against you or swallowing you whole)

must immediately make a successful Fortitude save or take

1d6 points of damage. After 1 minute, the creature must make

another Fortitude save at the same DC or take another 1d6

points of damage per three effective binder levels you possess

(maximum 5d6). Each bite attack (or each round that you

remain in the creatures gullet) poisons the creature anew,

forcing  a  new  round  of  saving  throws.  Your  poison  blood

becomes inert 1 minute after leaving your body.

Water Dancing: At will, you can move on liquid as if it were

 rm ground. This ability functions like the water walk spell,

except that it affects only you.

FOCALOR, PRINCE OF TEARS

Focalor has power over storms and seas. He gives those who

likely a planetar.

The  constantly

crying spirit has

never  uttered  a

coherent word, so

binder  scholars

must  look  else-

where  to  solve

the  mystery  of

how  he  came  to

be  a  vestige.  All

agree,  howev-

er,  that  Focalor

was  an  immor-

tal  creature  that

died of grief, and

his immense an-

guish  kept  him

from  being  ab-

sorbed into his home plane. The cause of his sadness, however,

is as unclear as his origin.

Special Requirement: Focalors seal must be drawn with

a liquid medium.

Manifestation: Focalor manifests slowly, appearing  rst

as a single tear that drops from thin air to strike the ground.

Next his weeping eyes appear, and gradually his whole body

becomes visible. Focalor looks like a handsome human male

whose face is twisted by grief. He wears no clothes, but he

cloaks his body in the griffon wings that grow from his back

and shudder with each of his wracking sobs.

Sign: While you serve as host to Focalor, your eyes con-

stantly weep, regardless of your mood or thoughts.

In  uence: While in uenced by Focalor, you feel some of

his inestimable grief and act morose, rarely smiling or  nd-

ing  cause  to  laugh.  Whenever  you  kill  a  creature,  Focalor

demands that as soon as you have a peaceful moment, you

take a round to say a few words of sorrow and regret for the

life cut short by your actions.

Granted Abilities: Focalor gives you the ability to breathe

water, strike foes down with lightning, blind enemies with a

puff of your breath, and cause creatures to be stricken with

grief in your presence.

Aura of Sadness: You emit an aura of depression and anguish

that  overtakes  even  the  strongest-willed  creatures.  Every

adjacent creature is overcome with grief, which manifests as

a 2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks,

for as long as it remains adjacent to you. You can suppress or

activate this ability as a standard action. Aura of sadness is a

mind-affecting ability.

Focalors Breath: As a standard action, you can exhale toward

a single living target within 30 feet. That target is blinded

for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save. Once you

have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Lightning Strike: Once per round as a standard action, you

can call down a bolt of lightning that strikes any target you

designate, as long as it is within 10 feet per effective binder

level of your position. The lightning bolt deals 3d6 points of

31

electricity damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of electricity

damage for every three effective binder levels you possess

above 5th. A successful Re ex save halves this damage. This

ability functions outdoors, indoors, underground, and even

underwater.

Water  Breathing:  You  can  breathe  both  water  and  air

easily.

GERYON, THE DEPOSED LORD

Once  a  devil  of  great  power,  Geryon  now  exists  only  as  a

vestige. He gives binders powers associated with his eyes,

as well as the ability to  y at a moments notice.

GERYON

GERYON

Legend: Most scholars of the dark arts know of Geryon.

As one of the legendary Lords of the Nine, he ruled Stygia,

the frozen  fth layer of Hell. During a great upheaval known

as the Reckoning, Geryon secretly supported the greatest of

the  arch devils,

A s m o d e u s ,

against  his  ri-

vals.  When  the

armies of the op-

posing lords met

to  decide  who

would  take  As-

modeuss power,

Geryon blew his

horn. At his sig-

nal,  the  armies

turned  against

their leaders, the

usurpers  were

thrown  down,

and  Asmodeus

reestablished his

right  to  rule  all

Baator.  Know-

ing  he  had  taught  the  usurpers  a  lesson  they  would  not

soon forget, Asmodeus returned them to power. Rather than

reward Geryon, however, he inexplicably gave his lone sup-

porters power and position to another.

Geryons fate after losing his position is unclear, but some

binder  scholars  maintain  that  Asmodeus  held  one  more

betrayal in store for him. The story goes that Geryon, bewil-

dered and stunned, lost all hope for the future. He began

to question the purpose of his actions and, in a moment of

weakness, even the point of his own existence. It was then

that Asmodeus struck. The ruler of the Nine Hells had al-

ways hungered for the souls of those who had lost their faith,

and Geryons powerful soul made a  ne meal.

32

Manifestation: Geryon arrives in a  ash of sickly green

light. A strange conglomeration of forms, his body resembles

three ogre mages standing with their backs to each other and

melded into one being. He has three legs, each with two feet,

and three arms, each with two hands. Three brutish faces gaze

out from equidistant points on a single head, which sits upon

a neck jutting upward from three shoulders. One face has a

furrowed brow and looks angry, another appears agitated, with

wildly rolling eyes, and the third seems thoughtful, often star-

ing into the distance as though thinking of something else.

Geryon speaks from only one of his three faces at any given

time, and each of the three has a different personality and

voicea deep voice for the angry face, a babbling, hysterical

voice for the agitated one, and a quiet voice for the thought-

ful one. All three, however, are Geryon. Whenever his mood

changes, Geryon turns his body so that he can speak to his

summoner with the face that best represents his feelings at

the time.

Sign: Two extra pairs of devilish eyes with green lids and

yellow, catlike irises open on your head. Located at the level

of your own eyes and equidistant from them, these bloodshot

orbs grant you the ability to see all around yourself. Your own

eyes take on the same appearance as the new ones.

In  uence:  While  in uenced  by  Geryon,  you  become

overly trusting of and loyal to those you see as allies, even

in the face of outright treachery. Because he values trust, if

you make a Sense Motive check or use any ability to read

thoughts or detect lies, you rebel against Geryons in uence

and incur the normal penalties.

Granted  Abilities:  Geryon  gives  you  his  eyes  and  his

baleful gaze, as well as the ability to  y.

Acidic Gaze: The gaze of your devilish eyes can cause foes

to erupt with acid. When you use this ability, each opponent

within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Will save or take 2d6

points of acid damage. Opponents can avert or close their

eyes to protect themselves, as normal for a gaze attack. You

can still take a standard action to focus your gaze on a target

creature, as normal for a gaze attack. You can choose not to

affect speci c creatures within range of the gaze attack, such

as your allies, if desired. You cannot use this ability if you do

not show Geryons sign.

All-Around Vision: Your extra eyes allow you to look in any

direction, granting you a +4 bonus on Spot and Search checks.

Opponents gain no bene ts when  anking you. When con-

fronted by a creature with a gaze attack, however, you cannot

avert your eyes, though you can still close them. You cannot

use this ability if you do not show Geryons sign.

See in Darkness: You can see perfectly in darkness of any

kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell. You cannot

use this ability if you do not show Geryons sign.

Swift Flight: You can  y for 1 round at a speed of 60 feet

with perfect maneuverability. Activating this ability is a swift

action. Once you have used swift  ight, you cannot do so

again for 5 rounds.

HAAGENTI,

MOTHER OF MINOTAURS

Haagenti tricked the god of frost giants and paid a terrible

price for that deed. She girds her summoners for battle and

gives them the power to confuse foes.

Legend: The tale of how minotaurs originated changes

according  to  the  culture  and  race  of  the  teller,  but  frost

giants  blame  Haagenti.  Thrym,

their primary deity, had tried to

force a goddess of the humans

to marry him and failed when

her  brother  disguised  himself

as Thryms bride and disrupted

the  ceremony.  The  angry  and

humiliated god consoled him-

self with dalliances among his

giant worshipers. Haagenti, a hill

giant sorceress, learned of his liai-

sons and used a spell to transform

herself  into  a  beautiful  frost  giant

so  that  she  might  bear  Thryms

powerful  half-god  children.  Her

ploy succeeded, and a year later

she gave birth to twin sons.

Once the children of his dal-

liances had grown old enough,

Thrym set out to visit and test

them all. He fought each child

to see who was the strongest and

bravest,  intending  to  invite  the

most  t to join him in Jotun-

heim.  When  he  sought  out

Haagenti, he found her herding

cattle in the warm lowlands and

became enraged when he saw her

true form. But when he raised his axe to fell

her, two horribly ugly giants leapt to her

defense. Thrym realized to his disgust

that they were his sons.

Thrym would have destroyed them

at that moment, but he suddenly real-

ized that Haagenti had taught him a

valuable lesson. His failed attempt at

marriage had been fouled by a beauti-

ful form created through trickery, and

now he had fallen victim to the same

ruse again. Rather than kill Haagenti

and her children, Thrym cursed them

to resemble the cattle with which they

wallowed,  turning  them  into  mino-

taurs.  Then  he  left,  vowing  to  teach

his frost giant worshipers to distrust

all beauty.

How Haagenti became a vestige is

unclear, but binder lore holds that her

guilt  at  ruining  beauty  for  the  frost

giants was so great that she could not

bear to exist in any place that held beauty of any kind. Since

every place in the planes seems beautiful to some being, she

could  nd no eternal home anywhere. Haagenti refuses to

speak on the subject and becomes angry when questioned

about her past.

Special Requirement: To summon Haagenti, you must

be either Large or able to speak Giant.

Manifestation: When Haagenti

is summoned, a huge icicle thrusts

up from the ground within the con-

 nes of her seal. Haagentis blurry

white  form  can  be  seen  moving

within the ice for a moment, then

she spreads her arms and shatters

her  icy  prison.  Although  she

appears with her back to her sum-

moner, her form is clearly that of

a winged minotaur. Haagenti

waves  her  ice  shield  and  bat-

tleaxe to disperse the cold mist

around her, then turns to face

her  summoner,  revealing  her

bull-like face and icicle beard.

Her  frost-rimed  fur  is  pure

white, and her horns appear to

be made of ice. Her powerfully

muscled form doesnt appear

female, but her smooth voice

sounds quite  feminine.

Sign: You possess the same

features as you always did, but

they somehow make you more

ugly than before. Others easily

recognize you, but small differ-

ences make you less appealing

to  look  upon.  In  addition,  your

bulk expands until you weigh half again

as much as you did before.

In  uence:  You  feel  ashamed  and

occasionally bashful in the presence of

beautiful  creatures.  In  addition,  Haa-

genti requires that you give deference

to  any  creature  you  perceive  as  more

attractive or charismatic than yourself.

This  deference  might  take  the  form

of a bow, a salute, opening a door for

the creature in question, not speaking

until  spoken  to,  or  any  other  gesture

that  acknowledges  the  creature  as

superior to you. In any case, you must

constantly treat any such creature with

respect or suffer the penalty for defying

Haagentis in uence.

Granted Abilities: Haagenti grants

you  some  of  Thryms  skill  with  arms

and  armor,  plus  her  own  aversion  to

transformation and the ability to in ict a state of confusion

Confusing Touch: You can confuse by touch. The target of

your touch attack must succeed on a Will save or become

confused for 1 round per three effective binder levels you

possess. When you attain an effective binder level of 19th,

this ability functions as a maze spell. Once you have used this

ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Immunity to Transformation: No mortal magic can perma-

nently affect your form while you are bound to Haagenti.

Effects such as polymorph or petri cation might force you

into a new shape, but at the start of your next turn, you can

immediately resume your normal form as a free action. You

remain  affected  by  such  effects  only  when  you  choose  to

do so.

HALPHAX,

THE ANGEL IN THE

ANGLE

Gnomes rarely earn a reputation for

their  military  might,  but  Halphax  is

one of the few exceptions to that rule.

He grants his summoners the ability

to raise a fortress and imprison foes, as

well as the hardness of stone.

Legend:  An  engineer  of  inesti-

mable excellence, Halphax made great

advances in architecture of all kinds.

His in uence can be seen in the solid

architecture of the dwarves, the beauty of elven buildings, the

comfort of gnome dwellings, and the practicality of hal ing

homes. His greatest passion, however, was the architecture of

military forti cations and the art of defense. Halphaxs walls

still encircle towns, and most of the castles he designed are

still standing today, even though more than a thousand years

have passed since he last sketched a  oor plan. Unfortunately

for  him,  the  great  architects  professionalism  became  his

downfall.

In Halphaxs time, gnomes were as populous as humans.

They lived in grand cities that rivaled those of the elves, and

they welcomed all civilized races into these metropolises to

live and trade. The hobgoblins were the  rst of the goblinoids

to rise out of tribalism and  nd welcome in the gnome city-

states. They quickly took to gnome society, learning as much

as they could and using their strong backs and hale bodies to

earn places for themselves in the military and manual labor

trades. Then, in an act known to gnomes as the Great Betrayal,

the hobgoblins turned against their benefactors in a series of

well-coordinated attacks. The victorious goblinoids turned

each gnome city into a prison, using the forti cations meant

to keep enemies out to trap the gnomes within. To ensure

that they overlooked no means of escape, they captured and

enslaved  the  gnomes  who  had  designed  them.  Through  a

combination of threats and rewards, they forced the gnomes

to make these prisons even more effective.

Many  gnome  architects  chose  to  die  rather  than  help

the hobgoblins, and others secretly used their positions to

help their kinfolk escape the city. But when the hobgoblins

threatened  the  life  of  Halphaxs  wife,  the  great  architect

put all his effort into creating the most impregnable prison

possible. Legend holds that no gnome ever escaped Halphaxs

city, and it was the last goblinoid holding to fall in the war

that followed the Great Betrayal.

When at last the goblinoids were defeated, the prison city

that Halphax had built was found empty

of all gnomes but him. The hobgoblins

had killed them all except Halphax and

his wife. She could not bear to be the

cause of so much tragedy, however, and

took her own life.

When  the  gnomes  attempted  to

apprehend  Halphax  and  hold  him

responsible for his deeds, the architect

vanished into his city. The allied armies

tore the city down to its foundations in

their attempts to  nd him, but he was

never seen again.

Special  Requirement:  Halphaxs

sign must be drawn inside a building,

in a corner of the structure.

Manifestation:  When  Halphax

manifests, the corner in which he was

summoned  appears  to  warp,  growing

deeper and extending to what appears

to  be  an  in nite  distance  beyond  the

limits  of  the  structure.  In  that  distance,  a   gure  appears,

and  suddenly  the  distance  closes,  bringing  Halphax  into

his seal. Halphax always takes the form of a gnome wearing

leather  breeches  and  a  vest,  both  of  which  are  covered  in

pockets and loops for holding tools and items. The tools of

an engineer hang from his belt, and he usually appears in a

posture of boredom, hands in his pockets. Halphaxs most

striking feature is that he seems to have no  esh and bone

beneath his clothesonly broken bits of stone and masonry.

The shattered features of bas-reliefs and gargoyles make up

his face.

Sign:  Your  body  takes  on  the  appearance  of  cracked

stone.

In  uence: In his time as a vestige, Halphax seems to have

lost all memory of his life as well as any feeling of guilt or

shame for his actions. Thus, when you are under his in u-

ence, you lose any normal sense of shame or embarrassment.

However, if someone threatens a hostage you care aboutbe

it a creature or an itemHalphax requires that you accede

to the hostage takers demands.

Damage Reduction: You gain damage reduction 10/adaman-

Halphaxs Knowledge: You can use the Profession (siege engi-

neer) and Knowledge (architecture and engineering) skills

untrained. In addition, you gain a +16 competence bonus on

Profession (siege engineer) and Knowledge (architecture and

Imprison: You can imprison a foe deep in the earth with

only a touch. As a standard action, you can make a melee

touch attack to imprison your target. If you hit, the target

must make a Fortitude saving throw or be imprisoned. This

ability functions like the imprisonment spell, except that the

imprisonment  lasts  for  a  number  of  rounds  equal  to  your

effective binder level. If you miss with the touch attack, you

can use this ability on the following round, but if a target

makes  its  save,  you  must  wait  1d4  rounds  before  using  it

again. You cannot imprison a creature while you already have

another imprisoned from the use of this ability.

Iron Wall: As a standard action, you can cause a  at, vertical

iron wall to spring into being. It functions as a wall of iron

spell, except that it disappears after 1 minute. Once you have

used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Secure Shelter: At will as a standard action, you can bring a

sturdy stone building into being at any point on the ground

within 60 feet of you, as long as the space can accommodate its

dimensions. This ability summons a tower like that produced

by the Leomunds secure shelter spell. You cannot summon this

tower if you already have one standing. You can dismiss the

structure as a standard action, but you cannot summon it

again for 5 rounds after dismissing it.

HAURES, THE DREAMING DUKE

Haures grants his summoners the power to create illusions,

protect  their  thoughts,  and  move  through  objects  like  a

ghost.

Legend: Human history associates the name Haures with

a powerful lord who terrorized his people. From the time

he took the throne until his death, he kept his subjects at

work building his castle, adding constantly to its grandeur

and might. Workers at the castle would return with strange

tales of building a room and then rebuilding it the next day

because no sign remained of their previous days work. Then

those who told such stories began to vanish in the castle,

never to be heard from again. Although the castle grew with

the additions made to it for the  rst few years, the constant

construction  seemed  to  have  no  effect  on  its  size  in  later

years.

When at last Haures died, his subjects rejoiced and attacked

the castle, hoping to loot and set  re to the palatial structure.

The mob of peasants found the castle empty, devoid even of

its furnishings. Confused and frightened, they left, and the

castle and the surrounding lands soon gained a reputation

for being haunted.

Binder scholars believe they know the answer to the mys-

tery of Hauress disappearance and the strange construction

of the castle. According to their legends, Haures was not a

human at all, but a powerful rakshasa sorcerer in disguise.

Much of the construction he demanded took place on the

Ethereal  Plane  because  Haures  planned  to  continue  his

existence there as a ghost. He wanted his afterlife to be as

much like his mortal life as possible, so he had his subjects

build a nearly exact duplicate of his castle on the Ethereal

Plane and cloaked their work sites in illusions to hide the

truth. In the last months of his life, Haures brought many

living and undead servants to his foggy realm, as well as all

the comforts to which he had become accustomed.

For some time after his demise, Haures spent time on both

the Material and Ethereal Planes. As a ghost, he would cloak

the decaying castle on the Material Plane in bright illusions

so that he could throw lavish parties for the travelers attracted

to its warm glow. Then he would end the party suddenly,

leaving his guests alone in the chilly ruins of his castle and

delighting in their terror. As the years passed, fewer folk dared

enter his home, and Haures began to throw illusory parties for

himself to alleviate his boredom. As his sanity deteriorated,

he became unable to distinguish between the Material and

the Ethereal Planes, and even between his illusions and his

own imagined experiences. At some point, Haures lost all

sense of the difference between reality and dreams, illusion

and imagination, and even life and undeath. This complete

dissolution of these barriers propelled him into existence as

a vestige.

Manifestation: Haures initially manifests as a ghostly ti-

ger stalking out of thin air, but his appearance rapidly changes

to  that  of  a  handsome  and  well-dressed  middle-aged  man

who appears alive and healthy. A moment later, that form de-

cays before his summoners eyes, rotting into a zombielike

state,  then  fading  into  ghostly  incorporeality  and  chang-

ing again, this time into a skeletal tiger wearing a shining

crown  and  pur-

ple  robe.  This

tiger form soon

loses  its  crown

and  robe  but

gains  ghostly

 esh, becoming

a  ghostly  tiger

to begin the cy-

cle  of  change

all  over  again.

is in living human form, and he speaks only in those brief

moments.

Sign:  While  you  are  bound  to  Haures,  your  palms  are

where the backs of your hands should be, just as they are on a

rakshasa. If you  ip over your hands so that the backs are up,

your thumbs end up on the wrong sides of your hands. This

rearrangement has no effect on your Dexterity, spellcasting,

ability to wield objects, or use of skills.

In  uence:  When  in uenced  by  Haures,  you  become

an eccentric, often speaking to yourself and to imaginary

friends. In addition, Haures requires that if you encounter

and disbelieve an illusion not of your own making, you must

not voluntarily enter its area.

Granted Abilities: Haures shields your mind with his

madness, allows you to move like a ghost, gives you the power

to fool the senses, and grants you the ability to kill others

with their deepest fears.

Inaccessible  Mind:  You  are  protected  from  any  effort  to

detect, in uence, or read your emotions or thoughts, and you

have immunity to any mind-affecting spells and abilities, as

if you were protected by a mind blank spell. You can suppress

or activate this ability as a standard action.

Incorporeal Movement: When moving, you become nearly

incorporeal and can ignore the effects of dif cult terrain. You

can even move through an enemys space, but not through

walls or other solid barriers. Furthermore, any attacks of op-

portunity directed at you while you move have a 50% miss

chance. You can suppress or activate this ability as a stan-

dard action.

Major Image: You can create an illusion at will, as though

you had cast major image (caster level equals your effective

binder level). A creature can attempt a Will save to realize the

illusion is false. You can never create more than one major

image at a time, and you can dismiss or renew the effect as a

standard action. Once you have used this ability, you cannot

do so again for 5 rounds.

Phantasmal Killer: This ability functions like the phantasmal

killer spell except for the range and save DCs (the ability still

requires a Will save, and possibly a Fortitude save) to resist.

You can target any single creature within 10 feet per binder

level you possess. Once you have used this ability, you cannot

do so again for 5 rounds.

IPOS, PRINCE OF FOOLS

Binders call Ipos the Prince of Fools because of the crown he

wears and the sad legend of his transformation into a vestige.

He grants his summoners cold iron claws with which to rend

foes, the power to see creatures and objects as they are, and

a fraction of his charisma.

Legend: As a mortal scholar of deities and the planes, Ipos

discovered vestiges and the process of binding long before

their rediscovery in the current age. Although binder lore

gives con icting accounts of Iposs race and nation of origin,

the legends agree that he was a mighty spellcaster with the

power to travel the planes in his pursuit of knowledge.

36

Although  he  was  interested  in  all  subjects,  Ipos  had  a

particular passion for discovering the nature of the planes,

magic, and the gods. Through his study of these topics, Ipos

sought to discover the planar orderthe set of fundamental

laws within which the multiverse operated.

Ipos did a magni cent job with his research, and his dis-

coveries have been passed down through the generations. Yet

he left such an incomplete vision of reality that later scholars

and explorers had to expand upon his body of work. In the

midst  of  his  investigations,  Ipos  stumbled  across  vestiges

and drowned in the depth of this knowledge. He could not

conceive of beings that did not exist in some place, or that

could not be reached via the planes or by deities. He became

obsessed  with   nding  the  plane  upon  which  the  vestiges

resided. He dropped the study of all other topics and threw

himself into the task of  nding a way to the realm of the

vestiges. No one knows what happened after he made this

mission his focus, but the fact that he now exists as a ves-

tige lends credence to the idea that he discovered what he

sought.

Special Requirement: Ipos refuses to answer the call of

any summoner who, in his judgment, has not taken a serious

enough interest in occult studies. Anyone wishing to bind

Ipos must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana) and

5 ranks in either Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (the

planes).

Manifestation: Ipos steps forward onto his seal as though

reappearing from invisibility. Some pact magic texts say that

he has the head of a vulture or a goose, but those writers must

have been unfamiliar with the bald ibis. Ipos clearly has that

birds long, downward-curving beak and mottled, featherless

head. Atop his warty scalp, he wears a crown of black iron, and

a many-layered gray cloak hides most of his form. Iposs overly

long arms end in gray-furred and clawed members that are

more like the paws of a lion than the hands of a man. In one

paw, he holds a gnarled iron cane that he uses more often to

strike the ground in emphasis than as an aid in walking. He

keeps  his  other

paw  hidden  in

one  of  the  long

sleeves  of  his

robes,  but  from

time to time, an

observer can see

him extending its

long, black claws.

Despite his rust-

ing  crown  and

tattered  cloak,

Ipos presents an

imposing  gure,

and  his  hissing

voice  and  bale-

ful  glare  add

considerably  to

his menace.

Sign: You grow long, black, clawlike nails.

In  uence: You think highly of your intellect and show

contempt toward those who question your assumptions or

conclusions. If you encounter a creature that shows interest

in a topic about which you have knowledge, Ipos requires

that you truthfully edify that individual.

Granted  Powers:  Ipos  grants  you  his  discerning  sight

and commanding presence, as well as claws of cold iron with

which to rend the veil of ignorance.

Cold  Iron  Claws:  Your   ngernails  harden  into  cold  iron,

granting you one claw attack per hand. You can strike with

each hand at your full attack bonus and add your full Strength

bonus to the damage you deal. The base damage for each claw

attack is as given on the following table.

If you already had claw attacks with your hands, use the claw

damage on the table only if its better than your normal base

damage. Your claw attacks are considered cold iron weapons

for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. You cannot

use this ability if you do not show Iposs sign.

Flash of Insight: As a swift action, you gain a true seeing effect

(as the spell) for a duration of 1 round. Once you have used

this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Iposs In uence: Your af liation with Ipos allows you to draw

more power from the vestiges to which you are bound. The

saving throw DC (if any) of each special ability granted by

your vestiges increases by 1. Treat your effective binder level

as one higher than normal for the purpose of determining

the effects of vestige special abilities.

Planar Attenuation: You gain protection from the natural

effects  of  a  speci c  plane.  These  effects  include  extremes

in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of

positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane

itself. You can change the plane to which you are attuned as

a standard action.

Rend: When you hit one foe with all your claw attacks,

you automatically deal double the damage of a normal claw

attack (including your Strength modi er) in addition to your

normal damage.

KARSUS, HUBRIS IN THE BLOOD

Karsus lived and died by magic, so he grants binders power

over that force.

Legend: Binders know Karsus as a potent mortal spellcaster

who attempted to steal the powers of a deity that had jurisdic-

tion over magic. He succeeded, but realized too late that his

mortal frame and soul could not contain the power. He died,

and  his  soul

remained  tied

to  the  Material

Plane  for  ages,

never  becom-

Some claim that

part  of  it  some-

how still lingers

there.  With  no

planar home and

no  deity  who

would

claim

him,  Karsus

became  a  ves-

tige.

Special

Requirement:

Karsus  refuses

to answer the call of a binder who attempts to summon him

within the area of an active spell. In addition, he appears only

to a summoner who has at least 5 ranks in either Knowledge

(arcana) or Spellcraft. He also hates Amon for some unknown

reason and will not answer your call if you are already bound

to that vestige.

Manifestation: Karsus appears silently and suddenly in

the form of a great red boulder. Blood burbles up from the

top of the stone and  ows in a rivulet down the side facing

his summoner, then pools at the base. When Karsus speaks,

the blood fountains upward, its height varying based on the

volume of his voice.

Sign: You bleed more than normal from wounds. Even a

small scratch releases a sanguine  ood. This effect does not

deal extra damage.

In  uence: You take on some of the arrogance for which

Karsus was famous in his mortal life. He requires that you

make  Bluff  or  Intimidate  checks  rather  than  Diplomacy

checks to in uence others.

Granted  Abilities:  In  life,  Karsus  was  obsessed  with

magic, and his obsession continues unabated in his current

state. He grants you the ability to see magic, destroy it with

a touch, and use any magic item with ease. He even provides

increased spellcasting power.

Heavy Magic: The save DC for each effect of every magic

item you use increases by 2.

Karsuss Senses: You can sense magic auras as easily as others

can detect odors, and concentrating on them reveals them

to your sight. When you concentrate (a standard action),

you automatically detect the number of different magical

auras  within  30  feet,  and  the  power  of  the  most  potent

aura within 30 feet, as though you had cast detect magic on

the area and concentrated for 2 rounds. You do not need to

concentrate to maintain this effect, but concentrating for

1 additional round reveals the location and strength of the

auras in the area. A third round of concentration allows you

to determine the school of a particular aura automatically.

37

Additional rounds of concentration reveal the schools of

other auras.

You cannot use this ability if you are blinded, but otherwise

it functions as detect magic for the purposes of concealment

and the materials pierced. If you encounter an aura of over-

whelming strength, however, you are dazzled so long as it

remains within range of Karsuss senses.

Karsuss Touch: You can produce a dispel magic effect with

a touch. To do so, you must make a successful melee touch

attack against a creature or an object as a standard action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can then make

a dispel check (1d20 + your effective binder level, maximum

+20) against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the

object or creature. The DC for this check is 11 + the spells

caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell

is dispelled; if you fail, it remains in effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an

ongoing spell (such as a summoned monster or a conjured

object), you must touch the target and make a dispel check

to end the spell that brought it into being. Targeting a spell

effect that is not an object or creature (such as the  ames of

a wall of  re) has no effect.

If the touched object is a magic item, you must make a

dispel check (the DC is the items caster level). If you suc-

ceed,  all  the  items  magical  properties  are  suppressed  for

1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. An

interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) is tem-

porarily closed by this effect. A suppressed item becomes

nonmagical for the duration, but its physical properties are

unchanged, so a suppressed magic sword is still a master-

work sword.

You can use Karsuss touch a number of times per day equal

to your effective binder level. Once you have used this ability,

you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Karsuss Will: You can use spell trigger items, such as wands

and staves, as if you were a wizard of your effective binder

level.

LERAJE

LERAJE

LERAJE,

THE GREEN HERALD

Once a favored servant of the primary

deity of the elves, Leraje allowed her

pride to become her downfall. Leraje

gives  her  summoners  the  ability  to

bring a bow to hand at will, to  re it

with  accuracy,  and  to  damage  a  foes

sense of self with it. In addition, she

gives her hosts keen vision in darkness

and skill at hiding.

Legend:  Tales  of  Lerajes  prowess

with a bow exist to this day, although

her  feats  are  now  ascribed  to  deities

and other great heroes, and most elves

think her legend is heresy. Pact magic

treatises  maintain  that  Corellon  Lar-

ethian called upon Leraje to be his  rst

herald among mortals. She taught the elves how to make and

use bows, though none could ever come close to matching

her prowess. Legend holds that she killed Thessala, goddess of

hydras, by shooting a single arrow through all one thousand

of her heads, thereby causing her children, the hydras, to be

dull and crude throughout eternity.

One day, Leraje helped Corellon save Lolth, who had not

yet fallen from grace, from an ambush set by Gruumsh. Lolth

praised Leraje for her skills, claiming that not even Corellon

could  re an arrow as fast or as accurately as his herald. Ler-

aje beamed under the compliment, and a bemused Corellon

challenged her to an archery duel to settle the matter. When

Leraje agreed, Corellon declared their target: her heart.

Corellon expected his servant to realize the error of her

pride and yield the contest, but Leraje instead brought up her

bow, aimed an arrow at Corellon, and pulled back the string.

Surprised, he raised his own bow and  red at her. Leraje re-

leased  her  bowstring  at  that  same  moment,  aiming  not  at

the god but at the arrow that sped toward her heart. Lerajes

arrow met that of her deity in midair and ricocheted back,

piercing her heart before Corellons arrowhead even touched

her chest. As punishment for wasting her life for the sake

of her stubborn pride, Corellon Larethian cast Lerajes soul

from heaven and earth.

Special Requirement: To summon Leraje, you must break

an arrow crafted by an elf while calling out Lerajes name

and title. In addition, Leraje hates Amon for some unknown

reason and will not answer your call if you are already bound

to him.

Manifestation: Leraje appears before her summoner as

though she had always been there, but camou aged so well

that she could not be seen. First her dull eyes open, then her

yellowed teeth come into view out of seeming nothingness,

revealed in a sly smile. As Leraje moves, her body takes shape

against  the  background,  and  her  clothes  and  skin  change

color  to  reveal  her  as  an  elf  archer  dressed  in  beautifully

decorated  green  leather  armor.  Although  she  was  clearly

beautiful at some point, the ravages of

some toxin or disease have made her

hair limp, yellowed her eyes and teeth,

and  made  her  skin  pockmarked  and

sallow.

Sign: You look sickly and diseased,

and  your  skin  becomes  sallow  and

pockmarked.

In  uence:  While  in uenced  by

Leraje,  you  become  quiet  and  unas-

suming. Leraje still feels considerable

guilt about the actions that led her to

become a vestige, so she requires that

you  not  attack  any  elf  or  creature  of

elven blood, including half-elves and

members  of  the  various  elf  subraces,

such as drow.

Granted Abilities: You gain super-

natural powers related to Lerajes skills

in life, as well as the ability to  re arrows that literally wound

your targets pride.

Hide  Bonus:  You  gain  a  +4  competence  bonus  on  Hide

checks.

Low-Light Vision: You gain low-light vision. If you already

have it naturally, you gain superior low-light vision and can

see three times as far as your light source would normally

illuminate. Thus, a torch that illuminates a 20-foot radius

would allow you to see clearly up to 60 feet and provide you

with shadowy illumination to a distance of 120 feet.

Precise Shot: You gain the bene t of the Precise Shot feat.

Ricochet: As a standard action, you can make a single ranged

attack against two adjacent targets. Make a single attack roll

and apply that result to the Armor Class of both targets. Any

hit  you  score  deals  damage  to  the  target  normally.  Extra

damage from abilities such as sneak attack or sudden strike

apply to only one target, which you must designate prior to

making the attack roll.

Weapon  Pro ciency:  While  bound  to  Leraje,  you  are  pro-

 cient  with  the  composite  longbow,  composite  shortbow,

longbow, and shortbow. If you were already pro cient with

any of these weapons, you instead gain a +1 competence bonus

on attack rolls with them.

MALPHAS, THE TURNFEATHER

Malphas allows his summoners to see without being seen,

to pass through surroundings without leaving any sign, to

vanish from sight, and to poison their enemies.

Legend:  Only  elves  who  know  their  history  well  are

familiar  with  the  story  of  Malphas,  a  lesser  scion  of  an

ancient  elven  kingdoms  ruling  family.  Malphas  joined  a

druidic order under pressure from his elders, who hoped

that enforced dedication to nature would teach him greater

respect for their traditions and the elven way of life. After a

contentious start, the plan seemed to work. Malphas, always

the black sheep of the family, soon became a model member

of the elven nobility. His trademark, a white doves feather,

could be found at sites where good deeds had been done,

although no one ever saw him perform them.

This  impression  was  all  part  of  Malphass  act.  While

studying the druidic traditions, he met another elf druida

female who won his heart with guile and promises of power.

Together they hatched a plan to make Malphas heir to the

throne. While his white feathers turned up wherever good

events were occurring, black feathers began to appear on the

murdered corpses of royalty. Elf diviners soon discovered that

Malphas was at the root of their troubles, and the traitorous

elf was forced to  ee.

Malphas   ew  to  his  lovers  hideaway  among  the  trees,

intending to warn her and  ee with her. But when she heard

his story, she  ew into a rage, mocking him for his stupid-

ity and his overtures of affection. To wound him even more

deeply, she revealed her true formthat of a drow. When the

elf authorities found Malphas, he lay on the ground, dead not

from magic or physical harm, but from the breaking of his

heart and the loss of his soul.

Malphas has pale

ers for hair. His

smile  reveals  black  teeth,  and  when  he  speaks,  his  black

tongue licks the air like a snakes. Malphas wears a nobles

 nery in funerary black, and a cloak made of raven heads

and feathers hangs from his shoulders. The heads start up

a raucous cry whenever he moves too much, so he remains

largely still, making only small gestures with his black-gloved

hands. Malphass hoarse voice croaks and cracks when he

speaks, a quality that annoys him greatly.

Sign: Your teeth and tongue turn black.

In  uence:  While  in uenced  by  Malphas,  you  fall  in

love too easily. A kind word or a friendly gesture can cause

you to devote yourself entirely to another person. Should

that person reject your affection, your broken heart mends

the  moment  another  attractive  person  shows  you  some

kindness. In addition, if you have access to poison, Mal-

phas requires that you employ it against your foes at every

opportunity.

Granted Abilities: Malphas grants you the ability to spy

without detection, to disappear, to use poison safely, and to

strike vicious blows against vulnerable foes.

Birds Eye Viewing: At will, you can summon a dove or a

raven to aid your powers of observation. (Use the statistics

for a raven regardless of the creatures form.) The bird appears

perched on your shoulder. You have complete control over

its  actions,  and  you  can  see  what  it  sees  and  hear  what  it

hears. Use the birds skill checks to determine the results

of its actions and observations (for example, Bluff, Search,

Spot, Listen), but use your skill bonuses to derive informa-

tion from its observations (for example, Knowledge, Sense

Motive,  or  Spellcraft  to  identify  a  spell).  If  you  have  the

trap nding ability, you can use the bird to  nd traps so long

as doing so doesnt require it to manipulate an object. The

bird cannot talk. You can have only one bird summoned at

a time. It remains until you summon another dove or raven,

mentally dismiss it (a standard action), or stop binding with

Malphas.

Invisibility: As a full-round action, you can make yourself

invisible  (as  with  the  invisibility  spell).  Making  an  attack

39

ends  the  invisibility  (as  normal),  but  otherwise,  the

effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your effective

binder  level.  You  can  invoke  this  ability

as a standard action at 5th level, as a

move  action  at  10th  level,  and  as  a

swift action at 15th level. Once you

return to visibility, you cannot use

this ability again for 5 rounds.

Poison  Use:  You  are  not  at  risk

of poisoning yourself when han-

dling poison or applying it to a

weapon.

Sudden  Strike:  With  your

melee attack, you deal an extra

1d6  points  of  damage  plus  1d6

points  per  four  effective  binder

levels anytime your target would be

denied its Dexterity bonus

to Armor Class. This extra

damage applies to ranged

attacks only if the oppo-

nent  is  within  30  feet.

The  extra  damage  from

sudden strike stacks with

that  from  sneak  attack

whenever  both  would

apply to the same target.

two glowing, hot coals where his eyes

should be. Marchosias wields a scepter

of   ames,  and  a  sword  of  hot  ash  is

belted  to  his  hip.  For  a  moment,  he

seems  exhausted  by  the  rigors  of  his

arrival,  standing  with  his  shoulders

slumped  and  his  head  bowed.  After

a  moment,  he  raises  his  gaze  to  his

summoner and stands straight and tall,

adopting an imperious posture.

Sign: While you are bound to Mar-

chosias, the pupils of your eyes glow

with a red-orange light. Anyone look-

ing at your face can make a DC 12 Spot

check each round to notice this effect.

This light is not strong enough to illu-

minate the area, and it does not make

you any easier to see in the dark, but it

can be disturbing to look upon.

In  uence: Marchosiass in uence makes you debonair

and sly, as though you have some trick up your sleeve and the

knowledge of it makes you con dent. In addition, Marchosias

requires that you use the death attack he grants you against

any foe you catch unawares.

Granted  Abilities:  Marchosias  gives  you  an  assassins

skill at killing, plus the ability to assume gaseous form and

the power to charm foes.

Death Attack: If you study a target for 3 rounds and then

make a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully

deals damage, the attack either paralyzes or kills the target

(your  choice)  in  addition  to  dealing  normal  sneak  attack

damage.  While  studying  the  victim,  you  can  undertake

other actions so long as your attention stays focused on the

target and the target neither detects you nor recognizes you

as an enemy.

If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save against

the kill effect, she dies. If she fails against the paralysis effect,

she is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds + 1

round per effective binder level. If the victims saving throw

succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once you

have completed the 3 rounds of study, you must make the

death attack within the next 3 rounds.

If you attempt a death attack and fail (the victim makes

her save), or if you do not launch the attack within 3 rounds

of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required

before you can attempt another death attack.

Fiery  Retribution:  You  deal  an  extra  3d6  points  of   re

damage when you strike an opponent who can deal extra

damage through a sneak attack, sudden strike, or skirmish

attack. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if

the opponent is within 30 feet.

Smoke Form: You can assume the form of a smoke cloud at

will. This ability functions like the gaseous form spell, except

that you can remain gaseous for as long as you wish. Although

you lose your supernatural abilities while gaseous, you do

not lose the ability to remain in gaseous form. Vestiges you

have bound remain so for the normal duration. Since you lose

your supernatural death attack ability, however, you cannot

study  an  opponent  for  the  purpose  of  making  your  death

attack while in smoke form. You can suppress or activate this

ability as a standard action. Once you have returned to your

normal form from smoke form, you cannot do so again for 5

rounds.

Silent and Sure: You gain a +16 competence bonus on Hide

and Move Silently checks.

NABERIUS, THE GRINNING HOUND

A cunning and mysterious vestige, Naberius can make his

summoners adept with all manner of arts and sciences, dis-

guise them, and make them cogent speakers.

Legend: Though Naberiuss origin remains mysterious,

binder scholars know that his name and form have changed

many times over the centuries. Ancient pact magic texts refer

to a spirit matching Naberiuss powers as Naberus, Kaberon,

Cerbere, and Serberius. One of these spirits appeared as a

with   fty  heads

and a tail of three

entwined snakes,

and the fourth as

a heap of bodies

surrounded  by

a  cloud  of   ies.

A  few  fiend-

ish  sages  have

suggested  that

Naberius  might

be  an  aspect  of

the three-headed,

doglike creature

that guards the gates to the Underworld on the third layer

of Hades, but that creature is thought to be simpleminded

and has never been known to speak. Naberius never admits

to having had older forms or names, and questions about his

origin get only a sly smile in reply.

Special Requirement: Naberius values knowledge, indus-

try, and the willingness to deceive. He manifests only for a

summoner with at least 4 ranks in Bluff or in any Knowledge

or Profession skill.

Manifestation: Naberiuss manifestation begins with a

great squawking and  utter of feathers. Moments later, a black

crane  ies in an agitated fashion over the seal, then crashes

down atop it, apparently dead. Naberius then stalks forward

out of invisibility as a three-headed hound to feast upon the

crane.  He  speaks  hoarsely  from  whichever  dog  head  isnt

eating at the moment. Despite his terrible appearance and

raucous voice, Naberius somehow manages to seem amiable

and eloquent.

Sign: Your voice deepens and acquires a gravelly, growling

tone.

In  uence:  While  you  are  in uenced  by  Naberius,  you

love the sound of your own voice and are constantly pleased

by  your  cleverness.  Whenever  you  are  presented  with  a

pulpit, a stage, a talking stick, or any other place or object

designed to give a speaker the  oor, Naberius requires that

you immediately seize the opportunity to speak. Any topic

will do, but since Naberius resents others taking control of

the discourse, he requires that you either shout them down

or mock them. Your speech must last a number of rounds

equal to your effective binder level to satisfy Naberius.

Granted Abilities: Naberius grants you the power to wear

any face, swiftly regain lost ability points, use skills of which

you have no knowledge, and talk your way through danger.

Disguise Self: You can alter the appearance of your form as a

standard action. This effect works like the disguise self spell.

Faster Ability Healing: You heal 1 point in each damaged

ability score every round, and 1 point in all drained ability

scores every hour.

41

Naberiuss  Skills:  At  the  time  you  make  your  pact,  you

can  choose  a  number  of  skills  equal  to  your  Constitution

bonus (if any). Your choices must be skills that cant be used

untrained and in which you have no ranks. For the duration

of the binding, you can make skill checks with your chosen

skills even though you are untrained. If your Constitution

modi er  decreases  after  you  make  the  pact,  you  lose  the

ability to make untrained checks with an equal number of

the chosen skills. Lost skills are chosen randomly, and they

remain inaccessible to you until you make another pact with

Naberius.

Persuasive  Words:  You  can  direct  a  verbal  command  at  a

single living target within 30 feet as if using the command

spell. A successful Will save negates the effect. When your

effective binder level reaches 14th, your words become even

more persuasive and this ability functions like the suggestion

spell. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again

for 5 rounds.

Silver  Tongue:  You  can  take  10  on  Diplomacy  and  Bluff

checks even if distracted or threatened. In addition, you can

make a rushed Diplomacy check as a standard action and take

no penalty. (Normally, a rushed Diplomacy check requires a

full-round action and imposes a 10 penalty on the check.)

ORTHOS,

SOVEREIGN OF THE HOWLING DARK

Ancient and unknowable, Orthos gives its summoners the

power  to  sense  what  they  cannot  see,  to  fool  the  sight  of

others, and to turn their breath into wind that can speak or

scour  esh from bones.

Legend: Orthos might well be the original vestigethe

 rst being to break the boundaries and see past the window

of reality to the nothingness beyond. Pact magic texts always

mention this entity, and persistent explorers can  nd its seal

represented in art or architecture on most planes, as well as in

the ruins of many ancient civilizations. Binder scholars have

a thousand theories about Orthoss origins, but none is more

than mere supposition. All agree that Orthos is inestimably

old, and it has long since shed whatever form and persona it

might once have had, becoming an alien and distant being.

In deference to its great age and the hallmark of its appear-

ance, binder scholars have dubbed Orthos the Sovereign of

the Howling Dark.

Special Requirement: You must summon Orthos within

an area of bright illumination.

Manifestation: When Orthos begins to manifest, a breeze

seems to pass over the summoner, but it ruf es nothing ex-

cept the summoners hair and clothes. The breeze intensi es,

becoming  a  cold  wind,  and  a  low  whistle  emanates  from

the vicinity of Orthoss seal. Directly over it appears a black

specka mote of shadow like a blind spot in the observers

vision. The whistle becomes a moan that slowly rises in pitch

and volume, eventually transforming into a howl as the dark-

ness spirals outward, opening like the pupil of some great

cats eye with an explosive rush of wind. The howling grows

so loud that it pains the ear while the seemingly nonexis-

Then it stops. In

the  sudden  si-

lence, an unseen,

slides out of the

black  aperture

and hovers heav-

ily over the seal.

Though  not  de-

tectable  by  any

sense,  Orthos

is  eerily  extant,

and its presence

can  be  felt  by

even  the  dumb-

est of beasts. The

vestige says nothing; its summoner can only plead her case

and hope that Orthos does not impose its in uence.

Sign: You always seem to be buffeted by a breeze that no

one else can feel, even when youre indoors. The eerie wind

makes  no  noise,  but  it  tousles  your  hair  and  belongings,

frequently changing direction.

In  uence: While in uenced by Orthos, you are averse to

darkened areas and loud noises. Although you can endure

such conditions, they give you a sense of panic and make

you short of breath. Orthos requires that you always carry an

active light source with a brightness at least equal to that of

a candle, and that you not cover it or allow it to be darkened

for more than 1 round. Additionally, Orthos requires that

you speak only in a whisper.

Granted  Abilities:  Orthos  gives  you  blindsense,  dis-

placement, and a breath weapon that you can use either as a

weapon or to deliver messages.

Blindsight: You gain blindsight out to 30 feet.

Displacement: At will, you can surround yourself with a

light-bending glamer that makes it dif cult for others to sur-

mise your true location. Any melee or ranged attack directed

at you has a 50% miss chance unless the attacker can locate

you by some means other than sight. A true seeing effect allows

the user to determine your position, but see invisibility has no

effect. You can suppress or activate this ability as a standard

action.

Whirlwind  Breath:  As  a  standard  action,  you  can  exhale

a scouring blast of wind in a 60-foot cone. Your whirlwind

breath deals 1d6 points of damage per binder level you pos-

sess. Every creature in the area can attempt a Re ex save to

halve the damage, and must also succeed on a Fortitude save

or be knocked prone and moved 1d410 feet away from you

(or just outside the cone, whichever is a shorter distance).

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for

5 rounds.

Whispering Wind: At will as a standard action, you can send

a message on the wind as though using the whispering wind

spell (caster level equals your effective binder level).

OTIAX, THE KEY TO THE GATE

The alien Otiax gives its summoners the power to open what

is closed, to walk among the clouds, and to strike foes with

fog that lands like a hammer.

Legend: Otiax is a bit of a conundrum because it seems

to  have  originated  outside  the  known  cosmology  of  the

planes. A few sources of pact magic lore refer to some plane

or place called the Far Realm, but most offer no explanation

of Otiaxs past. Some even posit that Otiax is somehow the

key to reaching the Far Realm, but that supposition has more

to do with Otiaxs appearance than with any real evidence of

its nature. Because Otiax never speaks, it can shed no light

on the issue. Binding with it is more a matter of instinct and

will than of deliberation.

Manifestation: When Otiax manifests, a locked golden

gate appears within its seal. Blue fog curls out in wispy ten-

drils  from  between  the  bars,  obscuring  what  lies  beyond.

After a moment of silence, some unseen force crashes against

the barrier. Then the gate shakes and rattles loudly, as though

some  creature  is  desperate  to  open  it.  Ragged  breathing

becomes audible, and the fog swirls around some indistinct

yet terrible form. At last the raging stops, and the azure vapor

passes through the gate. The sound of the tumblers turning

in the lock becomes audible, then the gate creaks open.

Sign: While bound to Otiax, you are surrounded by thin

wisps of light blue fog even in the strongest wind.

In  uence: Otiaxs motives remain a mystery, but its in u-

ence is clear. When confronted with unopened doors or gates,

you become agitated and nervous. This emotional state lasts

until the door or gate is opened, or until you can no longer

see  it.  Furthermore,  Otiax  cannot  abide  a  lock  remaining

secured. Thus, whenever you see a key, Otiax requires that

you use it to open the corresponding lock.

Granted Abilities: Otiax opens doors for you, lets you

batter opponents with wind, and cloaks you in a protective

fog that can actually lash out at foes.

OTIAXOTIAX

Air Blast: You can focus the air around you into a concen-

trated blast that batters opponents. You can use your air blast

with your air blast. You cannot use this ability if you do not

show Otiaxs sign.

Combat Re exes: You gain the bene t of the Combat Re exes

feat. You cannot use this ability if you do not show Otiaxs

sign.

Concealing  Mist:  You  can  whip  the  mist  that  constantly

surrounds you into a concealing screen that grants you con-

cealment (foes melee and ranged attacks have a 20% miss

chance). You cannot use this concealment to hide. You can

suppress or activate this ability as a full-round action. A se-

vere wind (either natural or magical, such as a gust of wind

spell) suppresses your concealing mist. You cannot use this

ability if you do not show Otiaxs sign.

Open Portal: At will as a swift action, you can open (but not

close) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel,

or other container as though using the open/close spell. This

ability has a range of 10 feet per effective binder level you

possess.

Unlock:  As  a  full-round  action,  you  can  unlock  a  single

lock that you can touch, provided that its Open Lock DC is

less than or equal to twice your effective binder level. For

example, a 10th-level binder can use this ability to open any

lock with a DC of 20 or lower, and a 15th-level binder could

open a lock with a DC of 30 or lower. This ability grants you

no protection from any traps that might be associated with

the lock. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so

again for 5 rounds.

PAIMON, THE DANCER

Paimon whirls into reality with grace and style. He gives his

summoners the ability to see combat as a dance and makes

them masters of its steps and hidden meter.

Legend:  Most  binders  know  the  Dancers  tragic  story,

although  none  can  be  certain  of  its  origin.  An  infamous

lothario, Paimon delighted in seducing noblewomen with

his  dancing  and  besting  their  suitors  with  his  swordplay.

He eventually crossed paths and swords with a particularly

jealous and cruel fellow, sometimes identi ed as a human

and other times as an elf. After Paimon had humiliated this

nobleman in front of his peers on several occasions, the fellow

enlisted some other aggrieved suitors to capture Paimon and

cut off his sword hand.

Paimon was not so easily defeated. When he recovered,

he returned to court wearing a bejeweled golden hand that

he could replace with a rapier blade. Exhibiting tremendous

aplomb, Paimon again set his rivals on their heels, and he

even fought and defeated the man who had wronged him.

Paimon  spared  his  adversarys  life  only  because  he  was

interrupted by a request to dance by the object of both their

affections. In response to this further humiliation, Paimons

foe again had him captured, but this time the mans thirst

for revenge was insatiable. He and his cohorts cut off all of

Paimons limbs and replaced them with sword blades, jeer-

ing at him all the while and daring him to return to court

again. Then they left Paimon to die while they celebrated

their victory.

At the next royal ball, Paimons foe and his coconspira-

tors smirked at every mention of their enemys name and

winked at one another when others wondered aloud where

the charming rake might be. Then a dark  gure appeared

among the dancers. Impossibly tall and shrouded head to

foot in dark, diaphanous cloth, the wraithlike  gure began to

spin. Disturbed by its appearance, the other dancers moved

away. When one of them spotted naked steel beneath the

whirling cloth, the nobles began to  ee the hall.

Enraged  that  his  party  had  been  interrupted,  Paimons

enemy went up to the  gure and tore away the cloth. For a

moment, the tortured  gure of Paimon stood before them with

Manifestation: Paimon appears in a whirl, his form spin-

ning like a top on an arm that ends in a metal blade instead

of a forearm and hand. He turns counterclockwise so rapidly

that his summoner can make little sense of what he sees.

Paimon quickly switches the arm on which he spins with a

hop, and then he switches to a leg, which also ends in a blade

rather  than  an  ankle  and  foot.  With  each  switch,  Paimon

slows, until at last he stands on one leg before his summoner,

balancing within the seal on its daggerlike point. Paimons

almost  featureless  gray  body  has  a  dancers  physique.  His

face is stretched to dis gurement around the right side of

his head, and no ears are visible. Paimon speaks in a garbled

voice from his twisted mouth while hopping from appendage

to appendage, making small turns as though he is impatient

to be whirling again.

Sign: One side of your mouth becomes wider than the

other, as though it were being stretched or pulled. That side

of your mouth has a tendency to remain slightly open, caus-

ing you to drool.

44

In  uence: Paimons in uence makes you lascivious and

bold. In addition, Paimon requires that you dance (moving

at half speed) whenever you hear music.

Granted Abilities: Paimon gives you the ability to dance

in and out of combat, and to make whirling attacks against

multiple foes.

Dance of Death: When you use this ability, you can move up

to your speed and make a single attack against any creature

you move past, provoking attacks of opportunity normally.

When you use your dance of death, you forfeit any bonus or

extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the

Cleave feat or the haste spell), and you cannot attack any single

creature more than once. Once you have used this ability, you

cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Paimons Blades: You gain pro ciency with the rapier and

short sword, and the bene t of the Weapon Finesse feat when

you wield such weapons.

Paimons Dexterity: You gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity.

Paimons  Skills:  You  can  use  the  Tumble  skill  untrained.

You gain a +4 bonus on Tumble checks and Perform (dance)

checks.

Uncanny  Dodge:  You  retain  your  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC

(if any) even if caught  at-footed or struck by an invisible

attacker. If you have uncanny dodge from another source,

you gain improved uncanny dodge instead. See the rogue

class features on page 50 of the Players Handbook.

Whirlwind Attack: You gain the bene t of the Whirlwind

Attack feat.

RONOVE, THE IRON MAIDEN

Ronove  remained  a  mystery  for  ages,  but  binder  scholars

now  believe  her  to  have  been  a  human  ascetic  who  lived

more than two thousand years ago. As a vestige, she grants

her summoners the power to move objects at a distance, to

strike with the skill of a monk, to fall as lightly as a feather,

and to run like the wind.

Legend:  Many  binder  scholars  credit  Ronove  with

laying the foundation for orders of monks, and indeed, her

philosophies and abilities bear a strong resemblance to the

training that monks now receive. In life, Ronove was a char-

ismatic  guru  who  taught  that  enlightenment  comes  from

denial rst of the needs of the  esh, then of the perceived

limits of reality, and lastly of the rules of reality. Her frequent

demonstrations of power served to illustrate the validity of

her ideas to others. She leapt from cliffs without harm, lifted

boulders with her thoughts, and lived for months without

eating or drinking.

Although Ronove gathered many followers, not one of her

disciples could manage her great feats. Some began to ques-

tion  her  methods.  To  prove  the  veracity  of  her  teachings,

Ronove secluded herself in an iron cof n, telling her stu-

dents to bury her and dig her up only when they received a

sign from her. Years passed, and no sign came. One by one,

her followers lost faith and deserted her. At last only one re-

mained. Disillusioned, he dug up the rusted sarcophagus,

only to  nd it empty. He tracked down his fellow disciples

to tell them of the miracle, but none believed him. Ronove

and her nameless disciple would have been lost to obscurity,

but her lone faithful follower inscribed his story on the walls

of a cavern. The recent discovery of this inscription explains

the strange powers and appearance of Ronove.

Special Requirement: Ronoves seal must be drawn in

the soil under the sky.

Manifestation:  When  Ronove  manifests,  the  ground

quakes, and a rusted iron sarcophagus erupts from the earth

within her seal, shedding dirt and  akes of rust as it grates

upward. The metal visage of a human woman is discernible

on the lid. The metal bindings holding the lid closed burst in

clouds of corroded metal, and the sarcophagus creaks open,

releasing a tumble of human bones and noisome black liquid.

Ronove does not speak to her summoner, but the visage on

the lid smiles or frowns during the pact-making process.

Sign: The  esh of your face settles into a frown or a smile

(a frown if you succeeded on your binding check, or a smile

if you did not) and retains that general expression regardless

of your actual feelings. This alteration to your visage does not

affect your Charisma, Charisma-based skill checks, or others

ability to make Sense Motive checks against you.

In  uence:  Ronoves  in uence  makes  you  think  that

others doubt your abilities and competence. Despite what

anyone says, you feel the constant need to prove your worth.

In addition, Ronove requires that you consume neither food

nor  beverages  (including  potions)  for  the  entire  time  you

remain bound to her.

Granted Abilities: Ronove gives you the power to fall any

distance without harm, lift objects without touching them,

and run like the wind.

Cold Iron and Magic Attacks: Your melee attacks count as

magic  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage  reduction.

When you attain an effective binder level of 7th, your melee

attacks also count as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Far Hand: As a swift action, you can lift and move an un-

attended object to which you have line of effect, as long as it

is within 10 feet per effective binder level of your position.

The force manipulating the object is considered Medium in

size, and it has a Strength score equal to your effective binder

level. During the swift action, you can move the object up to

5 feet per effective binder level. If the object weighs enough

to constitute a medium or heavy load for an individual of the

forces Strength, you can move it only half the normal dis-

tance. If the object to be moved would constitute a medium

or heavy load for you, activating this ability is a move action.

If the item could only be pushed or dragged by such a person

(that is, it weighs up to  ve times the maximum load), you

can move it just 5 feet per move action. The force cannot lift

the object more than 5 feet off the ground.

In any round during which you do not use a swift action

to manipulate the object, you lose control of it. You can never

move an object outside the range of this ability, and you lose

control of the object if you move too far away from it or if a

it. You can move

only  one  object

at  a  time  in  this

fashion.

Alternatively,

you  can  use  the

telekinetic  force

to  push  a  crea-

ture as a standard

action. The force

deals  1d6  points

of damage to the

target  and  initi-

ates  a  bull  rush,

using the forces

Strength  modi-

 er and adding a

+2  bonus.  If  the

bull rush is successful, the target moves in the direction you

indicate. Once you have used your far hand in this way, it

dissipates, and you cannot use it again for 5 rounds.

Feather Fall: You automatically fall as though under the

in uence of a feather fall spell. You can suppress or activate

this ability as a standard action.

Ronoves  Fists:  You  gain  the  bene t  of  the  Improved

Unarmed Strike feat. Your unarmed strikes deal damage as

those of a monk of a level equal to your effective binder level.

This ability does not grant you any other abilities of a monk,

such as  urry of blows.

Sprint: You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to your

base land speed.

SAVNOK, THE INSTIGATOR

Once a servant of gods, Savnok now grants his summoners

the ability to wear heavy armor, to draw arrows from thin

air, to take the place of allies in combat, and to cause wounds

that do not heal.

Legend: Savnok lived before recorded history. His story

contains about as much myth as it does fact, since the barrier

between truth and  ction eroded long before the current age.

According to the legend, Savnok served Hextor and Heiro-

neous before the two half-brothers came to blows. The gods

were charged with guarding their mothers arms and armor

while she met with her lovers. Both Hextor and Heironeous

were awed and tempted by their mothers implements of war,

but neither son dared disobey his mother.

Seeing their desires written clearly upon their faces, how-

ever, Savnok devised a means to steal the items for his masters.

Relying on their trust in him, Savnok tricked Hextor and Hei-

roneous into letting him guard their mothers armory. But

once his gaze fell on the goddesss armor, Savnok could not

resist donning it. Just touching the metal made him drunk

with power. After putting it on, he knew he could never take

it off, so he  ed the godly realms with the divine armor.

45

Hextor  and  Heironeous  soon  noticed  that

their  servant  and  the  armor  were  missing.

When they looked for Savnok, they found him

at  war  on  the  Material  Plane.  Since  no  energy

or  mortal  weapon  could  pierce

the goddesss armor, Savnok had

decided to set about carving out

a kingdom for himself. Shocked at

his  betrayal  and  horri ed  by  their

Hextor and Heironeous appeared

before  Savnok  and  ordered  him

to relinquish their mothers armor.

Their former servant responded by

attacking, and although he could

not harm them, neither could they

harm him.

Heironeous   ew  into  the  sky

and  tore  thunderbolts  from  the

clouds to hurl at Savnok, but Hextor,

realizing  that  they  needed  dei c  weap-

ons  to  defeat  the  armor,   ed  back  to

his  mothers  armory.  There,  he  found  a

bow  and  grabbed  a  handful  of  arrows,

then  returned  to   nd  Heironeous

still hurling lightning with

little effect. Hextor barely

had the strength to draw

his mothers bow, but draw

it  he  did.  With  each  arrow  he

 red, a dozen missiles streaked down to

strike Savnok. Though the arrows had little power behind

them, they did pierce the armor, and as Savnok raged at the

injustice the two gods had done him, he slowly bled to death

from dozens of small wounds. When at last Savnok lay dead,

Hextor and Heironeous removed the armor and debated what

to do next. Not only had they failed to guard their mothers

armory, but Hextor had also stolen her bow and arrows.

roneous  didnt

like  the  plan,

but he wanted to

protect his half-

all,  Hextors

theft had solved

a  problem  for

which Heirone-

ous  was  partly

responsible  and

prevented  Savnok  from  wreaking  still  more

havoc in the mortal lands. Together, the two

gods hid Savnoks essence in a place even they

could not reach. Heironeous has regretted this

decision ever since.

Special  Requirement:  To

summon  Savnok,  you  must  have

stolen  something  and  made  nei-

ther  reparations  nor  apology

for that act.

Manifestation:  The  first

sign  of  Savnoks  manifestation

is an arrow streaking out of thin

air  to  strike  something  unseen

above his seal. Then a dozen more

arrows whistle into the seal, each

one landing with a metallic ping.

Trickles of blood spout into the

air  where  the  arrows  hang,  and

as  more  strike  home,  the  blood

gradually outlines a heavily armored

form that seems too broad and powerfully

built to be human. Savnoks features are

obscured  by  his  plate  armor  and  helm,

as well as the rivulets of blood and the

many  arrows  that  pepper  his

body. When Savnok speaks,

he spits out bitter words with

a  gravelly  voice  that  seems

Manifestation of Savnok

heavy with resentment.

Sign:  A  piece  of  an  arrow  appears

under your skin somewhere on your body. It looks as though

your skin has healed over a broken-off arrow that had previ-

ously wounded you. The arrow deals no damage, but at times

it causes you some discomfort. If removed, it disintegrates

immediately, and another appears somewhere else on your

body.

In  uence: Savnoks in uence makes you headstrong and

recalcitrant. Once you make up your mind about a particular

issue, very little can change your thoughts on the matter. In

addition, whenever you don armor, employ a shield, or wear

any other item that improves your AC, Savnok requires that

you not remove that protection for any reason.

Granted Abilities: Savnok grants you abilities associated

with his death and the command of allies positions.

Call Armor: At will as a full-round action, you can summon

a suit of full plate armor, which appears about your body. As

you attain higher effective binder levels, the armors quality

improves, as given on the following table.

armor.

Move Ally: You can instantly swap positions with any visible

willing ally within 5 feet per two effective binder levels of

your position. Objects carried by you or your ally (up to the

maximum load for each) go along, but creatures do not. The

movement is instantaneous and does not provoke attacks of

opportunity. Using this ability is a standard action at  rst,

though at 7th level you can use it as a move action, and at 13th

level you can use it as a swift action. Once you have used this

ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Savnoks  Armor:  While  wearing  your  called  armor,  you

can ignore some of the damage from attacks by nonpiercing

weapons. When you  rst gain the ability to summon Savnok,

this ability gives you damage reduction 1/piercing, and the

value improves by +1 for every four effective binder levels

you possess. Thus, you have damage reduction 2/piercing as

a 4th-level binder, damage reduction 3/piercing as an 8th-

level binder, and so forth. When your effective binder level

reaches 13th, your damage reduction can be overcome only

by attacks that are both magic and piercing.

SHAX, SEA SISTER

Another giant among the vestiges, Shax gives her summoners

the ability to swim like  sh, to laugh off lightning, to wriggle

free of any bonds, and to strike foes like a thunderbolt.

Legend: Shax once ruled over storm giants as a goddess of

the sea. She was born to Annam, the greatest of all giant gods,

without his knowledge. Because he was prone to blind spots

in his omniscience, Annam could not hear the giants prayers

when they mentioned Shax, nor could he see her many cruel-

ties to them. He realized that some problem might exist only

when the storm giants started battling the other giant kinds,

claiming  their  caves,  clouds,  hills,  frosty  mountains,  and

volcanic peaks as storm giant territory. When Annam asked

them why they had attacked their fellow giants, the storm

giants pointed to the sea. Annams blind spot still prevented

him from perceiving Shax, so he sent his son Thrym to take

care of the problem.

Thrym, god of the frost giants, was eager to stop storm

giant incursions into his followers lands, so he picked up his

axe and leapt into the sea. There he met his sister Shax for

the  rst time. Thrym found her both beautiful and terrible.

He offered to wed her if she would call the storm giants to

return to the sea. Shax would have none of it, though, so the

two fought.

In the end Thrym won, beheading Shax with a clean blow

of his axe, but not before she had scratched off some pieces of

his  esh with her nails. The strength of Shaxs spirit gave her

the power to resist the pull of the Astral Plane, that graveyard

of the gods, so she became a vestige. As for Thrym, he yet lives,

but the pieces of his cold body that his sister removed have

become icebergs that  oat in the sea as constant reminders

of the storm giants debt to him.

 rst  appears  as

a  semitranspar-

ent female storm

giant  standing

20 feet tall. Her

drenched,  vio-

let-skinned body

is clad in a gold

breastplate  and

black tunic, both of which drip seawater on the ground. After

she manifests, Shax smiles, and her head inclines as though

acknowledging her summoner, but it continues to dip until

it tumbles off her neck. The body vanishes even as the fall-

ing head becomes more solid. It strikes the ground upside

down with a wet thump, its face turned away from her sum-

moner. For a moment the head just sits there, but then the

wet black hair coalesces into thick cords that press against

the earth, lifting it up. Walking on her hair tentacles in a spi-

derlike manner, Shax turns around to face her summoner,

glaring balefully with her yellow eyes. In a shrill voice, Shax

demands to know who has summoned her.

Sign: A scar appears around the circumference of your

neck, as though your head had been lopped off and then re-

turned to your body to heal.

In  uence:  While  under  Shaxs  in uence,  you  become

possessive  and  stingy,  particularly  about  territorybe  it

actual land or simply a room in an inn. In addition, her in u-

ence requires you to demand compensation for any service

rendered and to tax any use of your territory. However, you

can accept nearly any item of valuebe it material goods or

a serviceas payment.

Granted Abilities: Shax grants you the swimming skill

of a  sh and the ability to strike foes with sonic force and

electricity. She also gives you immunity to electricity and

allows you to move freely despite restraints.

Freedom of Movement: As a swift action, you can give yourself

the ability to ignore restraints. This effect functions like the

freedom of movement spell, except that it lasts only 1 round.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for

5 rounds.

Immunity to Electricity: You gain immunity to electricity

damage.

Storm Strike: As a swift action, you can charge a melee attack

or melee touch attack with electricity and sonic power. Your

next  melee  attack  deals  an  extra  1d6  points  of  electricity

damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage. If the attack misses,

that use of storm strike is wasted.

47

Swim Speed: You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed.

You can move through water at your swim speed without

making Swim checks, and you gain a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim check made to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. You can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even if distracted or endangered. You can also use the run

action  while  swimming,  provided  you  swim  in  a  straight

line.

TENEBROUS,

THE SHADOW THAT WAS

Tenebrous, once a powerful demon prince, offers dominion

over darkness and death.

Legend: The great demon lord Orcus has long sought

divinity.  Some  years  ago,  for  a  brief  period,  he  actually

attained  it.  Slain  and  resurrected  by  a  surge  of  negative

energy, the corpulent demon arose as the gaunt Tenebrous,

a god of darkness and undeath. For a time he traveled the

planes in this form, slaying other gods in his quest to gain

more power. His ultimate goal was to reincarnate himself

yet  again  because  he  wished  to  be  a  god  as  Orcus,  not

Tenebrous. Some say he was thwarted by a band of mortal

heroes, but whatever the cause, his grand plan failed. Orcus

did indeed rise again, but as the demon prince he once was,

not as a god.

True divinity can never fade completely. The tatters of godly

power that Orcus shed remained intact. Less than a god but

still divine, this bit of essence drifted in the void between

planes until it once more coalesced into a bitter sentience.

Thus, Tenebrous yet exists as a pale re ection of what he once

was, a shadow of

a shadow.

complete  darkness,  the  shadow  is  visible  as  a  darker  spot

in the blackness. Once the shadow crosses into the seal, an

inky humanoid formimpossibly gaunt, holding its limbs

at disjointed anglesrises from it. The voice of Tenebrous is

a whisper in the wind, almost impossible to hear, yet laden

with unmistakable meaning.

Sign:  You  seem  to  be  standing  in  shadow  even  on  the

brightest day. Furthermore, your own shadow never extends

more than a few feet from your body, even if the ambient light

suggests that it should be much longer. This effect does not

grant you concealment.

In  uence: While in uenced by Tenebrous, you are  lled

with a sense of detachment and an aching feeling of loss and

abandonment. Tenebrous requires that you never be the  rst

to act in combat. If your initiative check result is the highest,

you must delay until someone else takes a turn.

Granted  Abilities:  Tenebrous  grants  you  power  over

undead and shadows. He gives you the ability to chill your

foes.

Deeper Darkness: You can cloak an area in shadows as though

using the deeper darkness spell (caster level equals your effec-

tive binder level), with the following exceptions. The effect

is always centered on you, it has an unlimited duration, and

you can shift the range of the emanation (within the normal

range) up or down 10 feet as a move action. You can suppress

or activate this ability as a standard action.

See in Darkness: You can see perfectly through darkness of

any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness spell (or your

deeper darkness ability).

Touch of the Void: As a swift action, you can charge a melee

attack  or  melee  touch  attack  with  cold  energy.  Your  next

melee attack deals an extra 1d8 points of cold damage, plus

1d8  points  of  cold  damage  for  every  four  effective  binder

levels beyond 7th that you possess. When you attain an effec-

tive binder level of 11th, you can charge your weapon for an

entire round. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do

so again for 5 rounds.

Turn/Rebuke Undead: You can turn or rebuke undead as

a cleric of your effective binder level. As with a cleric, you

turn if you are good and rebuke if you are evil. If you are

neutral, you choose whether to turn or rebuke upon binding

with Tenebrous and cannot later change your mind. If you

have the ability to turn or rebuke undead from other classes,

your levels in those classes stack with your effective binder

level for the purpose of determining your turning ability.

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again for

5 rounds.

Vessel of Emptiness: You can use the  icker shadow magic

mystery (see page 146) as a supernatural ability once per day.

At 13th level, you can use this ability two times per day, and

at 19th level, you can use it three times per day.

ZAGAN,

DUKE OF DISAPPOINTMENT

On the cusp of dei cation, Zagan lost all he had worked for.

As a vestige, he offers his summoners a snakes sense of smell,

the power to cause an enemy  ee his presence, the ability to

immobilize an opponent, and more effective combat abilities

against snakes and their ilk.

48

Legend:  When  dwarves  had  yet  to  tunnel  into  their

mountains and elves  rst walked beneath the boughs of trees,

Zagan ruled over thousands. A lord in a great yuan-ti empire,

he had power over hundreds of his own kind, who in turn

controlled the lives of thousands of humanoid slaves. Zagan

built himself up as a god to these slaves, using the yuan-ti as

his emissaries to communicate with the uneducated masses

over which he held sway.

Over time, Zagans power became so great that he actually

aspired to become a god. He sought and  nally discovered

the means to his goal: a grand ceremony wherein he and his

yuan-ti  would  gather  together  all  his  worshipers  and  slay

them. At the appointed hour on the appointed night, Zagan

collected all his people for a celebration of his glory. He could

feel their worship empowering him, and with each passing

minute he gained strength and felt his awareness widening.

Then Zagan rang the gong that signaled the attack, and he

and his yuan-ti servants fell upon the slaves, slaying them

with wild abandon. At  rst Zagan thought it glorious, but

then he felt his new powers begin to wane. With each life

he crushed, he felt a bit more mortal.

Zagan attempted to call off the ceremony, but in the chaos

of the slaughter, the other yuan-ti could not hear him. Sud-

denly,  a  sword  pierced  Zagans  chest  from  behind.  As  he

looked down at the bloody blade, a sibilant voice whispered

in  his  ear,  The  World  Serpent  wishes  you  well.  A  cleric

among his own people had tricked Zagan into ruining his

chances at godhood on the very eve of his apotheosis. At a

point  somewhere  between  godhood  and  mortality,  Zagan

passed on into the void.

Special Requirement: You must kowtow before Zagans

seal, prostrating yourself and addressing him as a deity.

Manifestation: When Zagan begins to manifest, several

snakes appear in a heap in his seal. The snakes then slither apart

and rise upright along the lines of the seal. Then the crown of

a head appears, with baleful eyes glowering. An ogrelike head

slowly reveals itself, and after another moment, shoulders and

arms appear, to which the snakes are attached. Zagan then uses

his powerful arms to pull the rest of his body from the ground,

revealing a long, serpentine form instead of legs. He reaches

toward his summoner hungrily, his mouth gaping open in a

feral grin, but the snakes on his body turn toward him and hiss,

causing him to  inch backward. The brooding Zagan then

addresses his summoner while calming the snakes. Binder

scholars say that the snakes on his body are his most loyal

lieutenants, who were killed on the night of Zagans murder

and dragged with his soul into a vestiges existence.

Sign: You gain a lisp and cant help but speak in a sibilant

manner.

In  uence:  While  in uenced  by  Zagan,  you  become

domineering and aggressive. Zagan requires that you slay

any snake or snakelike being you meet, and deface any rep-

resentations of snakes or snakelike beings other than Zagan

that you  nd.

Granted Abilities: Zagan grants you a snakes ability to

detect creatures by scent, the ability to grapple and constrict

or yuan-ti, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet, the target

moves away. Any subject unable to move away or attacked by

you, a snake, or a yuan-ti is overcome with revulsion. This

revulsion reduces the creatures Dexterity score by 4 points

until the effect wears off or the subject is no longer within

20 feet of you. This ability is otherwise similar to the antipa-

thy spell (PH 200), with a caster level equal to your effective

binder level. Aversion is a mind-affecting compulsion ability.

When you use this power, a ghostly image of Zagan manifests

around your body and speaks your command with you before

foe is lethal damage.

Constrict: You gain a giant constrictors ability to crush the

life from its prey. You deal damage equal to 1d8 + 1-1/2  your

Str modi er with a successful grapple check, in addition to

your normal unarmed damage (typically 1d3 + Str modi er

for a Medium humanoid and 1d2 + Str modi er for a Small

humanoid).

Snake Bane: Zagans hatred for snakes, yuan-ti, and all snake-

like creatures gives you improved combat prowess against

their  kind.  You  gain  a  +2  bonus  on  melee  attacks  against

snakes,  snakelike  creatures  (such  as  nagas  or  yuan-ti),  or

creatures with a natural poison attack, and you deal an extra

2d6 points of damage against such foes when making melee

attacks. This damage also applies when you make a grapple

check to deal damage against a snake or snakelike enemy, in

addition to dealing your normal unarmed damage and your

constrict damage.

PACT MAGIC

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Practitioners of pact magic set aside the mores of society

and the laws of the multiverse to pursue a route to power

that most others fear. Yet even among these diehard indi-

vidualists, patterns appear and groups form. Such factions

often pursue similar goals and use similar means of gain-

ing power, giving rise to prestige classes such as those in

this section.

Those fools. They hunt innocents. Its me they ought to fear!

ANIMA MAGE

Raeleus, anima mage and outlaw

Anima mages give binders a bad name. Greedy and ambitious,

they exploit the powers of the vestiges to which they bind to

advance their own abilities. Anima mages see such displaced

entities  as  mere  tools,  no  different  from  spell  component

pouches or a wand of  reball.

With  the  power  of  a  vestige,  an  anima  mage  can  tap  a

resource all but unknown to his rivals to gain an edge against

other spellcasters. The anima mage is a loner, an outsider, and

a potential enemy to both binders and witch slayers (see page

67). But the way others classify him matters little to him, for

power is at hand.

BECOMING AN ANIMA MAGE

Since an anima mage blends pact magic with arcane magic, a

candidate needs some knowledge of vestiges and experience

with binding them to qualify. A few levels of either wizard

or bard are valuable too, since Knowledge (the planes) is a

class skill for both. However, the sorcerer and the warmage

(see Complete Arcane) are also good choices, since their key

ability for spellcasting is Charisma.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nongood

Skills: Intimidate 4 ranks, Knowledge (the planes) 4 ranks

Feat: Any metamagic feat

Spellcasting: Ability to cast 2nd-level arcane spells

Special: Ability to bind a 2nd-level vestige

CLASS FEATURES

The  abilities  you  gain  as  an  anima  mage  re ect  a  greater

degree of control over your bound vestiges. This increased

mastery of binding allows you to augment the arcane spells

you cast.

Soul Binding Bonus: At each anima mage level, your soul

binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in

the binder class. Your anima mage levels and binder levels

stack for the purpose of determining your bonus on binding

checks,  the  effectiveness  of  your  vestige-granted  abilities,

your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and the number of

vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a binder would have gained.

Spellcasting:  At  each  anima  mage  level,  you  gain  new

spells  per  day  and  an  increase  in  caster  level  (and  spells

known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an

arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you had

more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an

anima mage, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Exploit Vestige (Su): At 2nd level, you learn how to use

a bound vestige to boost your arcane spellcasting. With this

ability, you can choose to forego gaining one of the vestiges

granted abilities in order to gain one additional arcane spell

slot per day of any level up to the highest you can cast. Thus,

if you bind the vestige Dantalion (see page 28), you could

give up the read thoughts ability he grants you in exchange

for a bonus spell slot that day.

You decide which ability to give up before you make the

binding  check,  and  you  can  forego  only  one  ability  per

day in this manner, even if you can bind multiple vestiges.

Vestiges react poorly to your use of this ability, so you take a

5 penalty on your binding check. If you make a good pact

despite this penalty, you gain a bonus spell slot in exchange

for the ability you gave up. If you make a poor pact (that is,

you fail your binding check), you do not gain the extra spell

slot, and you still give up the designated ability for the day.

When you use this ability and make a good pact, you sever

a portion of the bound vestiges awareness of the world that it

would normally receive through you. Essentially, your bind-

ing amounts to a certain amount of trickery. The vestige being

bound expects to be able to experience life through its binder,

but when you make a good pact, you partially suppresses the

bene t the vestige receives, making it uncomfortable and

angry.

Vestigial Awareness (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, you can

force your bound vestige to focus on alerting you to danger

rather than letting it revel in the sensations that it perceives

through your pact. Whenever you make a good pact with

a vestige, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks for the

duration of the pact.

Vestige Metamagic (Su): At 4th level, you can use a bound

vestige to augment your spells by temporarily giving up access

to its powers. Using vestige metamagic is a swift action that

does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Choose one of the vestiges to which you are bound when-

ever you activate this ability. You can then apply the effects

of any metamagic feat that you possess to a spell you cast that

round, without increasing its spell level. However, you lose

access to all the abilities and powers granted by the chosen

vestige upon activation and do not regain them for 5 rounds.

You cannot use this ability if you do not have a vestige bound,

or if you do not currently have access to its abilities (through

the use of this ability, an antimagic  eld, or some other effect).

50

Vestige metamagic is usable once per day at 5th level, two

times  per  day  at  7th  level,  and  three  times  per  day  at  9th

level.

Vestige Casting (Su): At 10th level, you can use a bound

vestiges power to cast a spell outside the normal limits of

time and magic. Once per day, you can cast any spell that

you currently have prepared (or use an available spell slot if

you cast spells spontaneously) as an immediate action. You

cast the spell as if it were modi ed by the Silent Spell

and Still Spell metamagic feats, whether or not you

have those feats.

witch slayers (see page 67), and hostile binders that pursue

them. A high-level anima mage, known as a vessel, periodi-

cally guides the members of his coven to new lairs where its

members can safely pursue their art.

As a member of a coven, you spend a portion of your time

helping more experienced members research vestiges. In the

process,  you  learn  the  techniques  of  summoning  vestiges

and how to make the most of them once they are bound.

In time, you might grow powerful enough to

instruct new anima mages, or even start your

own coven.

PLAYING AN

ANIMA MAGE

As an anima mage, you  walk a  lonely

path,  but  great  rewards  await  you.

Enemies are everywhere, so you must

conceal  your  true  nature  even  more

carefully than an ordinary binder does.

Rivals resent you for the power you have

and the knowledge you possess. People

who ask too many questions and those

who  seem  too  interested  in  how  you

augment  your  magic  are  your  enemies.

Eliminate  them  when  you  can  and   ee

when you cant.

Because of your widespread unpopu-

larity,  you  tend  to  stay  on  the  move.

You  can  choose  to  work  alone,  or  you

can join one of many groups known as

covens that are made up of like-minded

spellcasters.  Covens  face  extermina-

tion  if  their  presence  is  revealed,  so

they rarely settle in one city for long.

Instead,  they  move  from  community

to  community,  trying  to  stay  one  step

ahead of the Seropaeneans (see page 90),

Blending the best parts of arcane spellcast-

vestige provides you with a plethora of

options in combat. You can boost your

defenses with spells while hammer-

ing away at your opponents with the

vestiges granted abilities, or you can

As you advance in this prestige class,

you can augment more of your spells

out having to prepare them in advance

ADVANCEMENT

Covens recruit new members slowly, testing candidates for

loyalty,  subtlety,  and  skill  before  revealing  the  secrets  of

exploiting vestiges. Attaining the  rst level in this prestige

class represents earning the basic trust of your comrades. At

this point, you are recognized as possessing valuable talent

and offered full membership. Now that you know the fun-

damentals of binding a vestige and coercing it to augment

your spellcasting abilities, you have taken the  rst step on

the dark road to becoming an anima mage.

Even though you have earned a place in the coven, the

other members might not trust you with their greatest secrets

for some time. Initially, you must spend most of your time

traininglearning  the  various  tactics  and  techniques  for

coercing vestiges. In the few hours remaining in a day, the

coven expects you to practice what you have learned. The

senior members insist upon this rigorous training because

they know that their enemies, always quick to destroy anima

mages, will seize upon any weakness you display.

With mastery of these techniques comes the freedom to

undertake your own missions and expand your arcane knowl-

edge as you see  t, so long as you never reveal the origins

of your training. Failure to safeguard the coven constitutes

grounds for lethal punishment.

As you advance in the anima mage prestige class, consider

investing some skill points in Spellcraft and Concentration,

which increase your ability to cast spells under pressure and

counter those directed at you.

RESOURCES

Membership in a coven offers many bene ts. The other mem-

bers are familiar with many different vestiges, so working

with them allows you to broaden your options considerably.

Likewise, all the other members are spellcasters. Many pos-

sess spells and equipment to which you might not otherwise

have access. If you prepare spells in advance, friends within

the group can provide you with additional spells for your

spellbook. Since many anima mages also manufacture magic

items, you can often pick up wands, scrolls, and other useful

equipment at a discount.

Finally, given the number of enemies that users of pact

magic  accumulate,  the  value  of  sheer  numbers  cannot  be

underestimated.  Allies  greatly  lessen  the  threat  posed  by

Seropaeneans  and  witch  slayers  alike.  Thus,  though  your

allies might be indifferent to you at the start, ingratiating

yourself with them early can help to ensure your continued

survival.

ANIMA MAGES IN THE WORLD

Reckless fools! They know not what they do.

Alabrast von Vegre, binder

Anima mages make compelling villains for a campaign.

They  exploit  vestiges  mercilessly,  believing  their  power

to  be  an  inexhaustible  resource.  An  NPC  anima  mage

might be a former colleague of the party who, lusting for

more power, turned to pact magic to advance his abilities.

Alternatively,  an  entire  coven  of  anima  mages  might  be

working within a wizards guild, spreading like a cancer

through  the  organizations  ranks  and  turning  it  into  a

force for evil.

Anima mages can also provide an excellent way to intro-

duce pact magic into your games. Such a character can appear

either as an opponent (thereby forcing the characters to learn

more about their enemy), or as an ally (who can lure PCs into

taking up pact magic).

DAILY LIFE

Although the life of an anima mage is dif cult, it is also  lled

with scholarly wonder. Those who pursue the study of magic

enhanced by the power of vestiges spend much of their time

researching  new  spells,  poring  over  forbidden  tomes  and

manuscripts to learn more about vestiges, and training to

master these unruly entities. They must remain constantly

on their guard against enemies, however, because those who

wish to prevent the spread of pact magic could descend upon

these renegades at any time.

Coven  leaders,  known  as  vessels,  supervise  their  fellow

anima mages closely. These senior members act quickly to

curb internal disputes, instill discipline in the junior ranks,

and reinforce awareness of shared dangers. They know better

than the others that only by standing together can a coven

prevail against its foes. Perhaps the most important respon-

sibility of a vessel, however, is to establish and maintain a

network of spies in his adopted city. Though such a covert

organization is expensive to maintain, these eyes and ears

allow the anima mages to monitor the activities of visiting

clerics, witch slayers, and Seropaenean agents (see page 90)

without exposing their presence. No spy knows any other

spies in the covens service, so the capture of any one agent

cannot expose the network or compromise the security of the

anima mages. Many spies die mysteriously when a coterie of

witch slayers descends upon a town, but as far as the vessels

are  concerned,  individual  lives  are  expendable  when  the

safety of the coven is at stake.

NOTABLES

An ex-slaver, sorcerer, binder, and scholar named Agra was

the  rst to discover that binding a vestige carried other magi-

cal consequences. Agra was a vicious woman who saw little

value in other peoplelet alone these wisps of personality

called up from who knows where. She cared not at all that

by using the vestiges as fuel for her spellcasting, she lessened

their contact with the world through her.

When word reached Syfal, the acknowledged founder of

pact magic, he exiled Agra, declaring her an enemy to all. Agra

left, but not before betraying Syfal to the Seropaeneans.

In later years, Agra surrounded herself with students and

began to teach them what she had learned. As her coven grew

more powerful, many of its members began to resent Agra for

the knowledge she guarded. One night, her students mur-

dered her in her sleep. When the tortured vestige inside her

52

was released, it laughed to see the  rst anima mage drowning

in her own blood.

ORGANIZATION

An anima mage coven consists of four to twelve members of

varying levels. The highest-level anima mage serves as the

leader, or vessel. The vessel names the coven, often incorpo-

rating the name of the vestige that its members most often

bind to create fanciful monikers such as the Fist of Amon or

the Seekers of Dantalion.

Beneath the vessel, all members are equal in name, though

seniority  ranks  them  in  fact.  The  voices  of  longstanding

members carry more weight than those of the newcomers,

and the vessel always awards any contested item to the most

senior member who claims it. Those who disagree with the

edicts of the vessel are free to leave and start their own covens,

but doing so earns them the enmity of the abandoned coven

and often results in a brutal war.

The  internal  unity  that  vessels  maintain  ensures  that

covens are rarely splintered by factionalism and con ict is

kept to a minimum. Instead, anima mages save their hatred

for the Order of Seropaenes (see page 90) and the witch slayers

(see page 67) who hunt them. The relentless forces arrayed

against  anima  mages  force  them  to  cooperate,  even  when

their personal agendas clash.

NPC REACTIONS

Binders  view  the  exploitation  of  vestiges  as  a  blasphemy,

so it is no surprise that their attitude toward anima mages

is hostile. Multiclass binders might be unfriendly or even

indifferent to anima mages, depending on their views about

the nature of vestiges. Members of the Order of Seropaenes

despise anima mages even more than they do binders and

usually attack the former on sight.

Few people other than the users of pact magic and their

immediate enemies know much about anima magesin fact,

most cant really distinguish them from other spellcasters.

Since most people are indifferent toward users of pact magic,

the same attitude generally extends to anima mages. Those

who do know a little about pact magic tend to react poorly

when  they  learn  how  anima  mages  exploit  vestiges.  Such

characters are usually unfriendly at best, although evil ones

might be indifferent.

ANIMA MAGE LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

anima mages to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Anima mages use a rare form of spellcasting that

lets them suddenly augment their spells.

DC 15: An anima mages power stems from bound spirits.

DC 20: An anima mage binds an unusual spirit called a

vestige, then coerces it into augmenting his spells. This prac-

tice is so abhorrent that even binders oppose anima mages.

DC 25: These strange spellcasters gather in covens and

coexist alongside other people. Anyone, anywhere, could be

an anima mage.

Any PC trying to contact an anima mage or a coven must

succeed on a DC 25 Gather Information check to locate the

appropriate intermediary for the group. Anima mages rarely

reveal themselves in public.

ANIMA MAGES IN THE GAME

Like  other  practitioners  of  pact  magic,  anima  mages  hide

from  the  world.  A  typical  anima  mage  appears  to  be  an

ordinary  sorcerer  or  wizard,  but  he  harbors  a  dark  secret,

practicing his forbidden magic only in the safety of his home

or laboratory.

This prestige class appeals to players who like to run darker

characters. Because the morality behind the anima mages

art is questionable, players who enjoy roleplaying internal

con ict readily seize on this class. When you have an anima

mage in your campaign, you can propel the storyline forward

simply by populating your world with recurring villains who

exist only to capture or kill these characters. If you adopt

such an approach, however, let the anima mages catch sight

of their pursuers before slipping away. Such staging tends to

enhance the sense that the characters have made a narrow

escape. Reward players who make an effort to conceal their

characters identities and talents by giving them plenty of

opportunities to interact with those hunting them.

ADAPTATION

Anima mages neednt exploit vestiges to gain powerthe

vestiges  could  volunteer  the  added  powers  to  an  anima

mage  in  recognition  of  his  spellcasting  ability.  You  could

also relax the prerequisites to open this prestige class to any

spellcasteror even a psionic character.

A  more  sinister  version  of  the  anima  mage  could  bind

 ends or celestials instead of vestiges. To do so, the character

would use the soul binding ability as described on page 10.

An anima mage who succeeds in coercing such an outsider

(DC equals the creatures CR + its HD) gains a bonus spell

slot, as noted in the exploit vestige ability description, but

no special abilities.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

PCs exploring an ancient ruin might encounter a coven of

anima mages looking for old manuscripts. Alternatively, a cell

of anima mages might be working inside a wizards school,

corrupting the students. A group of anima mages might even

attack the PCs, believing that they somehow know about the

covens activities.

EL 9: Raeleus, a particularly ambitious anima mage, has

a tattoo of a second face over his own. He and his lover, an

erinyes (MM 54), ambush the PCs, believing that the party

holds the secret to contacting a particular vestige.

NEW SPELL: VESTIGEWRACK

After a few failed attempts at binding vestiges, anima mages

devised  the  spell  known  as  vestigewrack.  This  spell  brie y

inundates vestiges with the sensations of a physical form,

thereby making the spirits more amenable to binding. Much

to their surprise, the anima mages discovered that the spell

also  affected  other  incorporeal  creatures,  such  as  ghosts

and wraiths.

VESTIGEWRACK

Necromancy [Evil]

Level: Blackguard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, F

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 20 ft.

Targets: One incorporeal creature or apparition/level in a

20-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You hold the curved dagger aloft, and as you slice it through the air

at the incorporeal creature before you, you speak words of power that

remind it of the life it once had, and the pain of its loss.

Clutching a curved blade, you make a downward cutting motion

that produces a  eld of pulsing, unholy, red light around you.

Each incorporeal creature within this light must succeed on a

Fortitude save or be wracked with sensations of loss. This effect

manifests as a 2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill

checks, and saves for as long as the creature remains in range,

and for 1d4 rounds afterward. In addition, every corporeal

user of pact magic gains a +2 bonus on binding checks made

against any vestige within range of this spell.

Focus: An ornate sacri cial dagger or kukri worth 300 gp.

KNIGHT OF THE

SACRED SEAL

I serve Paimon, a prince among men who was martyred for love.

Can you claim your cause to be so righteous?

Gaerius, Paimon-Bound Knight of the Sacred Seal

A knight of the sacred seal is never alone because she has

formed a true partnership with a single vestige. Her oath

requires her to champion and protect her patron vestige, to

take its seal as her symbol, and to advance its goals in the

world. As her relationship with her patron vestige deepens,

a knight of the sacred seal taps a well of abilities unavailable

to other binders, becoming more than she once was. Though

she can bind other vestiges, she chooses not to because the

connection she shares with her companion offers strange

new powers.

BECOMING A KNIGHT OF THE

SACRED SEAL

The binder class is the easiest path into the knight of the

sacred seal prestige class, since binders have Knowledge (the

planes) as a class skill plus the required soul binding class

feature. Multiclass binders, especially those with levels in

paladin or bard, also make good knights of the sacred seal,

though such combinations limit the characters options for

binding powerful vestiges. Charisma (for contacting vestiges),

Strength (for melee combat), and Constitution (for hit points)

are key abilities for a knight of the sacred seal.

CLASS FEATURES

As a knight of the sacred seal, you gain an improved rap-

port  with  your  patron  vestige.  This  deeper  tie  allows  you

to channel the vestiges abilities to boost your own combat

prowess.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: You gain pro ciency

with all simple and martial weapons, and with all armor and

shields (except tower shields).

Soul Binding: At each knight of the sacred seal level, your

soul binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level

in the binder class. Thus, your knight of the sacred seal levels

and binder levels stack for the purpose of determining your

bonus on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestige-

granted abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges,

and the number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however,

gain any other bene t a binder would have gained.

Aligned  Strike  (Ex):  Your  natural  weapons  as  well

as  any  weapons  you  wield  are  treated  as  aligned  for  the

purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment

of your weapons matches your own to as great a degree as

possible. Thus, if youre lawful good, your weapons strike

as both lawful-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of

overcoming damage reduction, but if youre neutral good,

they strike only as good-aligned. If you are neutral, your

weapon strikes as one alignment component of your choice:

chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. You must make this choice

upon  entering  the  prestige  class  and  cannot  thereafter

change it.

Patron Vestige (Su): When you become a knight of the

sacred seal, you select any one vestige that you have previously

bound as your patron. You develop a stronger than normal

relationship with this vestige that grants you several ben-

e ts as you advance in this prestige class. If you expel your

patron vestige by means of the Expel Vestige feat or do not

renew your pact with it on any given day, you lose access to

all supernatural class features gained from this prestige class

until such time as you contact that vestige again. You can

bind other vestiges in the interim, as normal for the binder

class, but you gain no additional bene ts from those pacts.

You are never at risk of making a poor pact with your patron

vestige.

Vestiges Protection (Su): When you attain 2nd level, your

relationship with your patron vestige deepens, prompting

it to take steps to ensure your protection. As a swift action,

you can acquire an insight bonus to your Armor Class equal

to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). The same bonus also

applies on your Re ex saves. Both of these bene ts last for 1

round. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again for

5 rounds.

Vestiges Protection Aura (Su): When you attain 3rd level,

your  patron  vestige  extends  its  protection  to  all  creatures

adjacent to you whom you designate as friends. Whenever

you  activate  your  vestiges  protection  class  feature,  those

bene ts apply to all designated allies adjacent to you.

Vestiges  Power  (Su):  At  4th  level,  you  can  draw  upon

the power of your patron vestige to augment your  ghting

abilities as a swift action. You gain a +2 bonus to Strength, a

+2 bonus to Constitution, a +10-foot bonus to your base land

speed, and a +4 bonus on Will saves for 1 round. Once you

have used this ability, you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Apotheosis (Su): At 5th level, your type changes to out-

sider, and you gain the native subtype (see the perfect self

monk class feature on page 42 of the Players Handbook). You

also gain damage reduction 10/magic.

Vestiges Surge (Su): At 5th level, once per day, when you

activate one of your patron vestiges powers, or your vestiges

protection or vestiges power class feature, you can choose to

activate that ability again immediately rather than waiting

the usual 5 rounds.

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a knight of the

sacred seal can continue advancing as a paladin.

PLAYING A KNIGHT OF THE

SACRED SEAL

You bear several important responsibilitiesto protect your

patron vestige, to treat it as you would have others treat you,

and to protect others like yourself. Dedicated to all servants

of the vestiges, you make it your business to face down those

who persecute your kind. A person in your position must

expect  treachery  at  every  turn,  so  be  on  the  lookout  for

suspicious  individuals  who  ask  too  many  questions  about

your charge. One lapse, and not only is your life on the line,

but so are the lives of all those who share your devotion to

the vestiges.

55

As a knight of the sacred seal, you rarely work alone. Upon

choosing  your  patron,  you  have  the  opportunity  to  join  a

group called a unit, wherein each knight binds the same ves-

tige as you do. The units shared appreciation for this vestige

allows its members to buttress their resolve in the face of a

world hostile to their beliefs. Most units also work with other

binders, acting as guardians for the users of pact magic. Each

unit is led by a commander, who is always the highest-level

knight of the sacred seal in the group. Her word is law, and

the  members  of  her  unit  serve  her  without  question.  The

hierarchy within the unit is rigid, re ecting the depth of

understanding and friendship between an individual knight

and her patron. If the group grows too large, it breaks into

two separate units, each with its own commander.

COMBAT

Your patron vestige helps you in combat. The versatility that

its aid provides allows you to modify your tactics depending

on the opponents you face. In general, you prefer a straight-

up  ght rather than a match based on subterfuge. You prefer

to press forward into the thick of enemies, swinging your

weapon with a verve inspired by your patron vestige. Make

sure you select effective combat feats, such as Spring Attack,

Improved Critical, and Power Attack, to make the most of

your abilities.

In addition to your combat prowess, the supernatural abili-

ties bestowed upon you by your vestige provide you with a

good mix of combat options. Your tactics should emphasize

the speci c powers to which you normally have access.

As  you  attain  higher  levels  in  the  prestige  class,  your

patron vestige begins to take an active role in your defense.

The bonus it grants to Armor Class and on Re ex saves can

often save your life. Eventually, the vestige also extends these

bene ts to your allies, making you a central  gure in any

 ght.

When you gain the vestiges power ability, you can suddenly

augment your combat prowess in much the same way as the

barbarian can with his rage ability. The speed bonus lets you

take  better  take  advantage  of   anking  opportunities,  slip

past your enemies, and destroy thinly protected spellcasters.

Furthermore,  the  boost  to  your  Constitution  temporarily

increases your hit points, thereby improving your staying

power in combat.

ADVANCEMENT

Units remain watchful for kindred souls who display an af n-

ity for a particular vestige and an inclination toward combat.

They offer membership only to those they feel would make

effective defenders of their patrons.

Your  rst level in this prestige class is an indication that

your chosen vestige and those who already serve it approve

of you. As a new knight of the sacred seal, you must do your

part to stand watch over the enclave or safe house of your

unit and patrol its borders with other new recruits. Yours is a

martial responsibility, and those associated with you depend

on your skill at arms and your relationship with the groups

vestige for defense. During your downtime, you are expected

to continue developing a rapport with your patron. In time,

the commander might send you on recruiting missions to

track down independent binders with outlooks similar to

your own. Once you reach that point, you have time to pursue

your own interests and adventures in addition to your regular

duties.

Your Sense Motive skill is vital for detecting suspicious

individuals  and  would-be  spies,  so  keep  improving  it  as

you attain higher levels. Like other martial characters, you

should spend your gold primarily to improve your weapons

and armor, though potions and oils are always useful. Dont

neglect combat feats that can make you a powerful combatant

when used with your vestiges surge ability.

RESOURCES

Membership in a unit offers several bene ts, but perhaps the

most important is that you always have of cial help available

when  undertaking  missions  for  the  commander.  Fellow

knights in the same unit have starting attitudes of helpful,

so they pitch in whenever they can, and all are trained and

capable warriors.

In addition, all knights of the sacred seal who belong to the

same unit have access to its equipment and cash reserves. The

commander makes loans from the units treasury to ensure

her units success in protecting its members interests and

the  interests  of  those  they  protect.  But  while  the  knights

have access to a reasonable amount of funding, their constant

movement is an expense in itself, so even common items are

not always available.

KNIGHTS OF THE SACRED SEAL

IN THE WORLD

Few warriors are as honorable as these knights. Its a shame that

we must destroy them.

Sir Michael Ambrose, witch slayer

PCs who get involved with pact magic in any form are sure

to run into a knight of the sacred seal eventually. The typical

binder safe house employs at least one or two of these war-

riors, and entire units sometimes hire out as mercenaries,

concealing  their  abilities  from  their  employers.  Such  an

incognito  unit  might  be  gathering  intelligence  about  an

enemys movements or simply  ghting for a cause in which

its members believe. In general, however, their association

with other users of pact magic makes knights of the sacred

seal good resources for locating reclusive binders.

DAILY LIFE

Each unit develops a code of conduct based on the tenets

important to its patron vestige. Different unitseven those

serving the same vestigemight develop markedly different

codes, but one tenet remains the same in any unit: Members

must  loyally  protect  binders  and  serve  the  cause  of  pact

magic honorably.

A knight of the sacred seal is a trustee of her patron vestige.

Senior members of the unit serve as teachers for the junior

56

ones,  inviting  them  to  embark  on  the  journey  to  a  closer

relationship  with  the  patron  vestige.  Many  also  teach  the

arts of war, developing their compatriots skills with weap-

onry, armor, and tactics, though such exercises are always

secondary  to  perfecting  their  understanding  of  a  vestige.

When not serving as instructors, knights protect their safe

houses, libraries, or other enclaves, as well as those of other

pact magic users.

As the face of the unit, the commander serves as an envoy,

diplomat, recruiter, and politician. She seeks out groups of

binders  and  pledges  the  service  of  the  unit  to

their enclaves. In addition, she ensures that the

unit has the proper foodstuffs, equipment,

and  other  resources  to  survive.

When  a  mission  arises,  the  com-

mander  determines  who  goes,

and  when  the  unit  must  leave  a

safe house, she decides who stays

behind  to  ensure  that  the  rest

In  the  long  and  storied

history of the knights of

the sacred seal, no indi-

vidual shines as brightly

as  Morgunn,  or  Brave

Warrior,  in  the  tongue

of  dwarves.  For  many  years,

Morgunn  hid  her  abilities

and the vestige that she had

bound  herself  to  because

she  knew  that  few  others

would understand her dedication.

For many years, she lived alone in a

small village of gnomes and dwarves in

the Stark Moundsa range of old mountains

that are now little more than hills.

Then the giants came. Boiling out of the higher

peaks,  these  vicious  monsters  descended  the

slopes, bent on conquest and destruction. As they

approached, ropes of drool swinging in time with

their tree-trunk clubs, Morgunn revealed herself

for what she was. Throwing off her disguise, she let loose a

war cry augmented by the force of her vestige and charged the

lead giant in an act of ultimate courage. The  eeing village

warriors rallied at the sight and launched themselves against

their attackers. Though the giants destroyed the village and

slew all its inhabitants, the legend of Morgunn the Possessed

still rings in those old hills, and in the hearts and minds of

those who followed in her footsteps.

ORGANIZATION

A  unit  generally  consists  of   ve  to  twenty  members.  The

highest-level knight of the sacred seal in the group assumes

the role of commander. Many units serve cells of binders as

guardians, soldiers, and sentries to protect and nurture the

use of pact magic. Unprotected binders might also recruit

units or solitary knights of the sacred seal by monitoring

witch slayer movements. But whether binders and knights

 nd  one  another  through  word  of  mouth,  sympathizers,

or  simply  luck,  they  regularly  join  forces  against  larger

threats.

Within  a  unit,  the  commander  has  absolute  authority.

Beneath her are one to three advisors, called sergeants, each

of whom oversees three to  ve knights. Promotion is based

on  meritthe  better  a  knights  performance,  the  higher

she  climbs  in  status.  Most  units  have  high  attrition

rates,  so  opportunities  for  advancement  always

exist for junior members who display ambition and

dedication.

Since all members of a given unit bind the same

vestige, internal con ict is rare, even between

characters of differing alignments. A knight

of  the  sacred  seal  follows  the

code of her unit and adheres to

its  structure,  regardless  of  her

moral or ethical outlook. Thus, a

neutral  evil  knight  might  serve

Agares  alongside  a  lawful  good

knight in the same unit. Both pro-

tect  binders  and  adhere

to the ideals of truth and

loyalty  that  they  believe

Agares represents, though

they differ in their means

to that end.

Knights belonging to differ-

ent  units  might  share  a  friendly

rivalry, often competing with one

another  to  prove  their  respective

vestiges  better.  However,  not  all

knights of the sacred seal share this sense

of  camaraderie.  In  fact,  some  units

viciously  oppose  one  another  due

to  longstanding  enmity  between

their  vestigesfor  example,  the

hatred between Karsus and Amon

puts their units irrevocably at odds.

Such  opposing  knights  could   nd

themselves  drawn  into  bloody  battles  on  behalf  of  their

patrons. True wars between units are rare, however, because

knights of the sacred seal quickly learn to stay away from

those who champion opposing vestiges.

NPC REACTIONS

Binders are generally friendly toward knights of the sacred

seal, since the two groups share a common interest. Toward

knights who serve as their guardians, their attitudes improve

to  helpful.  However,  the  two  groups  could  have  disparate

views and morals that ultimately lead to con ict. In such

cases, the knights and binders typically part rather than  ght

one another. The foes of pact magic are many, and both groups

prefer not to waste lives and resources with in ghting.

Meetings between knights of the sacred seal and anima

mages are usually tense at best, considering the relationship

between the knight and her bound vestige. Anima mages

believe the hatred that the knights bear them is misguided,

but they understand its source, so they tend to avoid knights

of the sacred seal at all costs. When forced to interact with

their nemeses, the anima mages are unfriendly.

Clerics,  paladins,  and  other  characters  opposed  to  pact

magic see knights of the sacred seal as perversions, or at least

as confused individuals who dabble in the forbidden. At best,

such characters are unfriendly, but most tend to be hostile.

KNIGHTS OF THE

SACRED SEAL LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (history) can research

knights of the sacred seal to learn more about them. When a

character makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the follow-

ing, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Knights of the sacred seal belong to an esoteric

order of warriors enhanced with otherworldly power.

DC 15: The source of their power comes from a particular spirit

called a vestige, with which they forge a deep relationship.

DC 20: Binders often employ knights of the sacred seal as

guardians for their enclaves. Where you  nd a knight of the

sacred seal, youre bound to  nd a binder.

KNIGHTS OF THE SACRED SEAL

IN THE GAME

How you introduce pact magic into your game best deter-

mines how to incorporate this prestige class into an ongoing

campaign. Because knights of the sacred seal are secretive

by necessity, you could simply decide that they have had a

presence in your campaign all along but operated beneath

the notice of the authorities.

Players who like the features of the paladin class but not

its alignment can turn to this prestige class to get the best

of both worlds. A PC knight of the sacred seal is at her best

when  paired  with  another  character,  preferably  a  binder.

The  interaction  between  protector  and  protected  creates

excellent opportunities for roleplaying. If you have a knight

of the sacred seal in your game, be sure to provide plenty of

opportunities for her to express her devotion and dedication

to her bound vestige and its particular agenda.

ADAPTATION

Binders and knights of the sacred seal need not have such a

close connection. Perhaps the knights of the sacred seal are

more militant in their approach to pact magicor maybe

they actively oppose witch slayers, taking the battle directly

to their oppressors.

Even if you dont use pact magic in your campaign, you can

still utilize this class. Instead of binding a vestige, perhaps

a knight of the sacred seal voluntarily accepts possession by

a ghost or a  end. Such an arrangement changes the typical

alignment of this class to evil, unless you use the guidelines

for ghosts presented in Ghostwalk.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

When designing an encounter with a knight of the sacred

seal, decide  rst what her code is and whether or not she

works with a unit. Beyond those considerations, the nature

of her patron vestige should make a dramatic difference in

how the knight interacts with others. For example, a knight

devoted to Aym might crusade against greed, adopt a vow of

poverty, and help the poor on a regular basis, while a knight

devoted  to  Focalor  might  seek  to  comfort  the  grieving  in

addition to protecting binders.

EL 9: Ordered by her unit to stay behind, Kybrin is  ghting

off a group of six paladins sent by the Order of Seropaenes

when the PCs encounter her. Her foes are bent on destroy-

ing the knights simply because the latter are users of pact

magic.

SCION OF DANTALION

The light of the Star Emperor guides me. His blood runs in my

veins, and I am one of his princes.

Breven Hulstoff, human binder

Scions of Dantalion trace their lineage to an ancient, long-

forgotten  human  empirea  civilization  in  which  justice,

love, and art reigned supreme. They maintain that the rulers

of this realm led their people to such a height of beauty and

righteousness that they rivaled the stars of the heavens in the

awe they could inspire. The gods saw their accomplishments

and grew envious. In their jealous rage, they destroyed the

empire and cursed its nobility, decreeing that no one from

that line could ever join them in the afterlife.

Scions of Dantalion believe themselves to be part of this

line,  cursed  by  the  gods  but  blessed  by  association  with

Dantalion, the vestige that is the conglomeration of all their

ancestors souls. The scions believe that their destiny is to

one day take up the crown, bear the scepter of rulership, and

rebuild the empire that could rival the stars.

BECOMING A SCION

OF DANTALION

A scion of Dantalion must be able to bind Dantalion. Since

Knowledge  (nobility  and  royalty)  is  a  cross-class  skill  for

binders, a level of bard, wizard, or paladin eases entry but

slows progression in the binder class, thereby delaying the

candidates contact with Dantalion. Thus, a candidate with

a high enough Intelligence score to gain more than 2 skill

points per level should remain a binder and simply devote

cross-class skill points to Knowledge (nobility and royalty).

A binder who manages to gain extra ranks in Knowledge

(nobility and royalty) might want to take enough to gain the

+2 synergy bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Entry Requirements

Race: Half-elf, half-orc, or human

Skill: Knowledge (nobility and royalty) 2 ranks

Special: Ability to bind Dantalion

CLASS FEATURES

Dantalion favors his scions above all others. When you make

a pact with Dantalion, the abilities he grants become more

potent, and you gain additional powers as wellsome of which

you can use even when you are not bound to Dantalion.

Soul Binding: At each scion of Dantalion level, your soul

binding ability improves as if you had also gained a level in

the binder class. Thus, your scion of Dantalion levels and

binder levels stack for the purpose of determining your bonus

on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestige-granted

abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and the

number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain

any other bene t a binder would have gained.

Favored of Dantalion (Ex): You need never worry about

succumbing to Dantalions in uence because you automati-

cally succeed on the binding check when making a pact with

him. You can hide or show Dantalions sign as desired, as

though  you  possessed  the  suppress  sign  class  feature  (see

page 11).

With each new level you take in the scion of Dantalion

prestige class, Dantalions seal (see page 28) includes another

face. Thus, the sign appears as two vestigial faces on your torso

at 1st level and as six faces at 5th level. When you activate an

ability granted by Dantalion or by the scion of Dantalion

prestige class, the eyes and mouths of the faces brie y open

to reveal distant stars set in darkness.

Scholarship of Dantalion (Su): Your connection to Dan-

talion gives you occasional  ashes of insight into a variety

of topics. Once per day per scion of Dantalion level, you can

reroll any Knowledge check you just made. You must abide

by the result of the reroll, even if its worse than the original

roll.

Improved Read Thoughts (Su): At 2nd level, whenever

you use the read thoughts ability granted by Dantalion, you

gain full knowledge of the targets surface thoughts on the

 rst round of concentration, assuming that it fails its Will

save. Normally, you know its surface thoughts only after 3

rounds of concentration. Once you have used this ability,

you cannot do so again for 5 rounds.

Swift Awe of Dantalion (Su): Beginning at 2nd level,

you  can  activate  your  awe  of  Dantalion  ability  as  a  swift

action instead of a move action whenever you are bound to

that vestige. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do

so again for 5 rounds.

Overwhelming Thoughts (Su): Beginning at 3rd level,

you can choose to overwhelm the thoughts of any creature

you target with the read thoughts ability granted by Dan-

talion. As a standard action, you send your thoughts out to

a single creature whose thoughts you are reading (so it has

already failed its Will save against your read thoughts ability),

forcing it to succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your effective

binder level + your Cha modi er) or be dazed for 1d4 rounds.

During this time, you can maintain concentration on your

read thoughts ability and, as a move action, continue to read

the  thoughts  of  a  creature  you  have  dazed  on  subsequent

rounds. A successful save allows the creature to break free

of your thought reading.

Dantalions Glare (Su): From 4th level on, you can use

a  standard  action  to  intensify  Dantalions  sign  and  glare

through its eyes. The starry voids in the eyes of Dantalions

sign  blaze  forth  with  the  brightness  of  an  exploding  star,

affecting all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Every creature within

this area must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your

effective binder level + your Cha modi er) or be blinded for

1d4 rounds.

You must be showing at least one face of Dantalions sign

to use this ability. If the face is hidden beneath clothing, you

can reveal it as a free action that does not provoke attacks of

opportunity, so long as you have a hand free. If the face is

hidden beneath armor, you must have a free hand and use a

standard action to reveal the sign. Doing so provokes attacks

of opportunity, and you take a 2 penalty to AC while reveal-

ing the sign in this manner.

59

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again

for 5 rounds.

Improved Thought Travel (Su): Beginning at 4th level,

you can use the thought travel ability granted by Dantalion

as a move action.

Read Multiple Thoughts (Su): When you attain 5th level,

the increased strength of your connection with Dantalion

allows you to simultaneously target a number of creatures

equal to your Charisma modi er (minimum 2) with the read

thoughts ability granted by Dantalion. Each of the targets

must be within range (5 feet per effective binder level). You

can use this ability in combination with either your improved

read thoughts or your overwhelming thoughts class feature,

or both.

move about a battle eld, covering lots of ground without pro-

voking attacks of opportunity. Unlike other binders, however,

you have access to the swift awe of Dantalion ability, which

can be quite useful in protecting yourself from harm.

As you grow in power, your improved read thoughts and

overwhelming  thoughts  abilities  come  into  play.  By  judi-

ciously combining the use of these powers, you can neutralize

a powerful foeperhaps long enough for you and your allies

to achieve victory.

At  high  levels,  you  can  use  improved  thought  travel  to

appear amid distant foes. Once there, you can blind them with

Dantalions glare. Finally, the pinnacle ability improves your

read thoughts and overwhelm thoughts abilities by allowing

you to affect multiple foes with them.

PLAYING A SCION OF DANTALION

You are part of a truly great royal lineage. The human kings

and queens of today are but pale re ections of your ancestors,

who ruled over a celestial empire so magni cent that even the

gods could not bear its brilliance. The curse invoked upon

your line by those same deities prevents you from joining

them in the afterlife. Instead, when you die, you will join

Dantalion, the conglomeration of all the souls in your line.

Yet destiny offers you a reprieve. One day, the scions of Dan-

talion will rebuild the celestial empire and free Dantalion

from the prison of his vestige nature.

Because scions of Dantalion are all members of an extended

royal family, your fellow scions deserve great respect and good

treatment from you. Some scions claim closer relationships

to the celestial royalty than others, but such assertions are

largely  meaningless.  The  one  important  fact  is  that  other

scions of Dantalion belong to the same legacy as you do, and

are likewise committed to guiding humanity toward truth,

justice, and unity. One day, your efforts, and those of scions

like you, will allow all people to understand the essential

righteousness of knowledge, art, and equality among humans,

and the celestial empire can rise again. Until that day, you

must lead by example, proving your nobility by your good

works and steady guidance.

COMBAT

As a low-level scion of Dantalion, you can bene t from the

same tactics as any other binder who makes a pact with that

vestige. In particular, you can use your thought travel ability to

Table 15: The Scion of Dantalion

Hit Die: d8

ADVANCEMENT

As you advance, be sure to devote some of your resources to

increasing your Charisma score. Doing so improves the saving

throw DCs of the offensive abilities granted by the scion of

Dantalion prestige class, as well as many abilities granted by

other vestiges. When you reach the point at which you can

bind multiple vestiges, consider your favored combat strategy

when selecting a second vestige. Dantalion offers a good mix

of abilities that can be useful in both combat and noncombat

encounters, but he does not provide heightened damage-deal-

ing powers or exemplary defensive capabilities. If you like

the idea of confounding foes so that your friends can mop

them up, choose another vestige that gives you the power to

hamper enemies in a different way. If you enjoy wading into

the thick of battle and taking down your foes, be sure to pick

a vestige that grants you extra melee damage. If youre happy

with Dantalions abilities but want a better defense, select a

vestige that will give you extra protection.

RESOURCES

The fact that scions share a common plight and destiny causes

them to treat one another like family. Thus, you can expect

a helpful attitude from another scion, even one of radically

different social class or outlook. Scions generally provide one

another with hospitality and aid of whatever kind they can

muster. A fellow scion who believes in your personal goals

might go to almost any lengths to aid you, but if your goals

seem at odds with establishing the celestial empire, a bitter

rivalry can result.

SCIONS OF DANTALION

IN THE WORLD

Sanctimonious madmen, the whole lot of em. Humans never had

a celestial empire. Still, you cant say Dantalion doesnt favor them.

He gives his scions more power than hell grant me.

Morden, dwarf binder

nations or just neighborhoods. The different means by which

they  approach  their  goals  can  cause  scions  to  come  into

con ict with one another, but should such disagreements

come to blows, scions typically resolve them through duels

witnessed by their fellows, in the ancient dueling tradition

of the nobility.

The  scions  of  Dantalion  present  enor-

mous  roleplaying  potential.  With  their

magnanimous  goals  of  educating  and

unifying humanity, they can give binders

a more sympathetic face in the campaign

world.  At  the  same  time,  their  belief  in

their own nobility and their desire to steer

other  people  toward  a  destiny  only  they

perceive  are  often  viewed  as  disturbing

and threatening.

Most  scions  remain  open  to  the

idea  that  other  humans  and  even

half-humans might also be scions who

deserve  Dantalions  favor  and  the

chance at rulership of the celestial

empire,  but  this  attitude  is  coun-

terbalanced by their myopic focus

on  the  plight  of  humans.  At  their

best, scions can be forces of amazing

bene cence; at their worst, they can

take their fervor for aiding humans to

horri c extremes.

DAILY LIFE

Scions  of  Dantalion  gener-

ally learn of their heritage

and  destiny  in  one  of

two  ways.  A  character

who is already a binder

might  learn  of  Danta-

lions  legend  and  feel  a

special resonance with it, or a scion of Dantalion might

notice  a  quality  of  nobility  in  another  human  (or  half-

human)  and  draw  that  person  into  both  pact  magic  and

the family of Dantalions celestial empire. Regardless of

how  scions  of  Dantalion  come  to  embrace  their  beliefs,

most  seek  out  other  members  of  their  family  at  some

point and join forces with them. Members of this prestige

class  share  the  common  goal  of  elevating  and  unifying

humanity, although they might differ in their means of

accomplishing that end. Because of this mutual goal, they

tend to be more organized and more likely to work together

than other binders are.

On  a  day-to-day  basis,  scions  of  Dantalion  attempt  to

advance  the  interests  of  human  communities.  By  increas-

ing and sustaining security, prosperity, and quality of life

for humans, they hope to return humanity to the greatness

of the past. Scions of Dantalion also support activities that

unify disparate human groups, be they humans of different

NOTABLES

Scions  of  Dantalion  often  relate  tales  of

other  scions  exploits  to  one  another,  and

no name comes up more often than Breven

Hulstoff. The in uence Breven has man-

aged  to  gather  impresses  other  scions  of

Dantalion,  and  he  maintains  a  sterling

reputation for courtesy and honor. However,

like  many  other  scions,  he  is  more

than he seems.

Breven  Hulstoff  worked  as  a

palace guard until he met a woman

who claimed to be a scion of Dan-

talion. After she showed Breven

the secrets of pact magic, he

grew  convinced  of  his

own relationship to the

ancient  royalty  of  the

celestial  empire.  Even-

tually,  Breven  left  the

palace  guard  on  good

terms  to  pursue  pact

magic.  Years  later,  he

returned  to  help  his

kingdom  in  a  time  of

trouble.  Breven  swiftly

worked his way up in the

ranks of the guard with

the  aid  of  his  powers,

crushing  anyone  who

stood in his way and jus-

tifying his actions with the idea that he was acting on behalf

of humanity. Now Breven acts as the queens personal guard

and advisor. He is also secretly her lover, and Breven hopes to

cement that relationship with marriage at some point. Unfor-

tunately for him, the king yet lives.

ORGANIZATION

Scions of Dantalion are somewhat estranged from others who

pursue pact magic. Their existence as outcasts among outcasts

tends to draw them into closer bonds with one another. Thus,

although scions rarely have any of cial organizational struc-

ture, they often meet in small groups to work toward some

larger goal in secret. Individual scions bring their talents and

those of their attendants and allies to the project, creating a

loose network of varied folk. The differing attitudes of the

people  that  can  be  involved  in  such  a  group  often  makes

cohesive effort dif cult, but at times, the blend provides the

perfect tools for accomplishing the goal.

NPC REACTIONS

Most  folk  react  to  scions  of  Dantalion  the  same  way  they

react to binders because they see little difference between the

two. Humans might take issue with the scions assertion that

their bloodline will one day rule the race, but just as many are

likely to appreciate the image of the past and future celestial

empire. Those who favor the scions message of justice, educa-

tion, and equality in human communities probably have a

friendly attitude toward scions of Dantalion.

Like all binders, scions of Dantalion can encounter trouble

with religious organizations, but local leaders and their ser-

vants are often unfriendly or hostile to them as well. After

all, the future celestial empire will rest upon the bones of

current nations, no matter how noble the means of achieving

it might be.

Scions of Dantalion have a peculiar relationship with kar-

sites (see page 84). Both claim to be descended from human

rulers of a great empire, and both claim to be destined to rule

humanity. This similarity of beliefs can bring scions and kar-

sites into con ict, but it can also bring them together. Indeed,

some karsites are also scions of Dantalion. Scions who work

with karsites believe that Karsuss country was the celestial

empire, and that they are the descendants of that societys

ruling caste. Such scions oppose deities both for throwing

down Karsus and for destroying the wondrous society their

ancestors built.

Most scions of Dantalion, however, reject this idea that

Karsuss  country  was  the  celestial  empire.  They  see  their

roles  less  as  rulers  of  humanity  than  as  stewards  of  the

celestial empires grace. They dont oppose spellcasters or the

gods; they want to show the gods respect while rebuilding

an empire that honors both humans and deities. Scions of

Dantalion accept that many other humans and half-humans

might be members of their family whether or not they show

the  signs.  After  all,  a  scion  typically  has  numerous  blood

relations who do not practice pact magic and thus bear no

signs of Dantalions favor at all. Karsites, on the other hand,

believe that only those who look like them and have their

abilities are destined to rule.

SCION OF DANTALION LORE

Characters  with  ranks  in  Knowledge  (arcana),  Knowledge

(nobility and royalty), Knowledge (the planes), or Knowledge

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase  the  following,  including  the  information  from

lower DCs. Each of the DCs below increases by 5 for Knowledge

(nobility and royalty) and Knowledge (the planes) checks.

DC  15:  Some  powerful  binders  call  themselves  scions

this bene t because they are descended from the royalty of

some ancient empire, and that they will one day rebuild and

rule that empire.

SCIONS OF DANTALION

IN THE GAME

Scions  of  Dantalion  are  best  introduced  to  the  campaign

after  your  players  are  at  least  somewhat  familiar  with  the

concept of pact magic. If you  rst establish the norm for a

pact magic user (that is, a binder), the differences displayed

by members of this prestige class will be all the more obvi-

ous and meaningful.

Establishing a norm also helps a player have more fun with a

scion of Dantalion as a player character. Give the scions player

roleplaying and story support by providing opportunities for

the character to better the plight of humanity. Such opportu-

nities need not focus solely on the scion character; a mission

to  slay  a  marauding  dragon  also  serves  the  humans  of  the

region by ensuring their safety. If you want to provide some

roleplaying tension, offer the scion player an opportunity to

help humans in a way that might harm some other humanoid

race. Another scion already involved in such a mission might

even seek the PC scions aid in accomplishing his goal.

ADAPTATION

The scion of Dantalion prestige class was designed for humans

because  of  Dantalions  legend,  but  a  small  change  in  that

legend could easily open the class to any race. Dantalion could

just as easily wear elven faces, for example, or if the celestial

empire was populated by all kinds of creatures, many races

might be represented in his visage.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

NPC scions of Dantalion can easily  ll either heroic or villain-

ous roles in your campaign. For example, a scion of Dantalion

might  serve  as  a  patron  to  the  player  characters,  offering

them rewards for service and helping them to aid human

communities. Such a patron might not reveal his allegiance to

Dantalion or his philosophy until he has established a strong

bond of trust with the PCs. Such a patron could even be evil

but treat the PCs very well until they refuse an assignment

that seems immoral.

EL 15: Breven Hulstoff (see Notables, above) makes a great

NPC patron for PCs. His extensive knowledge and connection

to the royal family makes him a useful contact and a power-

ful benefactor. However, he can also act against the PCs from

behind the scenes. Depending on the situation at hand, he

could  use  his  in uence  with  the  queen  to  declare  the  PCs

outlaws, or with the courts to have them convicted on trumped-

up charges, or with the prison by releasing criminals who are

likely to work against PC interests. Because he keeps his use

of pact magic secret, he is loath to display Dantalions sign.

62

In  combat,  Breven  prefers  to  let  others  do  most  of  the

 ghting. He begins a  ght by using improved read thoughts,

followed by empowered overwhelming thoughts to stun his

foes for 4 rounds. Next, he targets a foe that wasnt stunned

with phantasmal killer, using the Sudden Ability Focus feat to

increase the save DC. Breven then moves to attack a stunned

foe, using phantasmal killer when possible and  eeing by

means of thought travel and incorporeal movement should

he take too much damage.

TENEBROUS APOSTATE

Rise again, Lord of the Outer Dark. Stand astride the barriers

of life and death, of Heaven and Hell, and take up thy mantle as

slayerand kingof gods.

Suvas Jhond, former priest of Vecna,

now a Tenebrous apostate

No other vestige is quite like Tenebrous. The remnant of the

divinity once possessed by Orcus, Tenebrous is perhaps the

only vestige still worshiped in some places as a god, and so

tightly bound to a livingif not mortalbeing. This unique

status grants Tenebrous the ability to manipulate the world

in ways that other vestiges cannot.

Some Tenebrous apostates revere Orcus, seeing Tenebrous

as part of their sundered god and the seed from which he

will one day sprout anew. Others see the corpulent  end as

the embodiment of Tenebrouss downfall. These followers

believe that Tenebrous is a separate deity who attempted to

manifest through Orcus, only to be laid low when the demon

proved unworthy.

BECOMING A TENEBROUS

APOSTATE

If you have suf cient mental fortitude and lack of scruples to

devote yourself to a former demon god, you might qualify to

join the ranks of Tenebrouss disciples. The vast majority of

Tenebrous apostates are multiclass binder/clerics, though a

rare few are binder/blackguards. Charisma is the key ability

for a Tenebrous apostate, since it in uences many class abili-

ties. Wisdom and Constitution are also important because

they affect divine spells and hit points, respectively.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nongood

Skills: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, Knowledge (the

planes) 8 ranks

Special: Ability to bind Tenebrous

Special: Ability to turn or rebuke undead

Special: Must worship Tenebrous as a god

CLASS FEATURES

As  a  servant  of  Tenebrous,  you  gain  power  over  darkness

and undeath.

Spellcasting: At each level beyond 1st, you gain new spells

per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known,

if  applicable)  as  if  you  had  also  gained  a  level  in  a  divine

spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the

prestige  class  level.  You  do  not,  however,  gain  any  other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you

had more than one divine spellcasting class before becom-

ing a Tenebrous apostate, you must decide to which class to

add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day,

caster level, and spells known.

Soul Binding: At each Tenebrous apostate level beyond

1st,  your  soul  binding  ability  improves  as  if  you  had  also

gained a level in the binder class. Your Tenebrous apostate

63

levels and binder levels stack for the purpose of determining

your bonus on binding checks, the effectiveness of your vestige-

granted abilities, your ability to bind higher-level vestiges, and

the number of vestiges you can bind. You do not, however, gain

any other bene t a binder would have gained.

Eternal Bondage (Ex): You no longer need to summon

Tenebrous every day; you are bound to him constantly. You

cannot choose to bind a different vestige in his place. How-

ever, you can still attempt a

binding check each day to

negate his in uence.

Tenebrouss  Rebuke

(Su):  When  you  use  the

turn  or  rebuke  undead

ability  granted  by  Ten-

ebrous,  your  connection

to your dark master allows

you to channel the energy

in  a  unique  way.  You  can

use a turn attempt to deal

1d6  points  of  damage  per

effective turning level you

possess  to  every  undead

creature  within  30  feet.

Each affected undead can

attempt a Will save (DC 10

+  your  effective  turning

level + your Cha modi er)

for half damage.

If  you  use  a  rebuke

attempt,  each  undead

within  30  feet  is  instead

cured  of  1d6  points  of

damage per effective turn-

ing level. This effect occurs

instead of the normal result

of a turn or rebuke attempt.

You  can  still  use  these

turn attempts in conjunc-

tion  with  divine  feats,  as

normal.

Umbral Body (Su): Beginning at 4th level, you can trans-

form yourself into pure darkness once per day. This ability

functions like the umbral body shadow magic mystery (see

page 152). You can remain in this form for a number of rounds

equal to twice your Tenebrous apostate level or return to your

normal form early as a swift action. Once you return to physi-

cal form, you cannot use this ability again for 5 rounds.

Blast of the Void (Su): When you attain 5th level, you

can  use  a  turn  or  rebuke

attempt to deal 1d8 points

of  damage  per  effective

turning  level  to  every

living  creature  within  a

30-foot  cone.  This  ability

is usable once per day.

EX-TENEBROUS

APOSTATES

If you ever cease to revere

Tenebrous as a god, you lose

your  Tenebrous  apostate

class  features  as  well  as

most  of  your  cleric  class

features,  if  any  (see  Ex-

Clerics,  page  33  of  the

Players Handbook).

PLAYING A

TENEBROUS

APOSTATE

You  are  committed  to

returning  Tenebrous  to

divinity. While you might

not  spend  every  waking

hour

this

furthering

agenda, it dominates your

life, taking precedence over

all other matters. You might

serve and worship alone, or

as part of a rare Tenebrous-worshiping cult, or within a cult of

Orcus that seeks to return the demon prince to godhood.

However you choose to serve, you must hide what you are

from everyone except other worshipers of your patron. In

the greater world, those who would not hate you for being

a binder would certainly persecute you for your choice of

TENEBROUS AS A GOD

Although  Tenebrous  exists  only  as  a  vestige,  clerics  who

worship  him  receive  spells  from  somewhere.  Perhaps  the

remnants of his divinity are sufficient that he can still grant

spells, or perhaps the spells come from some other source

(much as the spells granted by demon lords do). His clerics

have access to the Chaos, Death, Evil, and Trickery domains.

As a deity, consider Tenebrous to be neutral evil.

Luxx, a doppelganger Tenebrous apostate in the guise of an elf,

and one of its undead allies

Visage of the Dead (Su): When you attain 2nd level, your

body begins to resemble that of an undead creature. Your skin

darkens, appearing dusky and shadowy in dim illumination

and corpse-gray in bright light, and you lose roughly half your

body weight. Because of these changes, you gain a +1 dodge

bonus to Armor Class and a +1 circumstance bonus on Escape

Artist and Intimidate checks. Furthermore, mindless undead

believe you to be one of them and do not attack you except

in self-defense, or when ordered to do so by their creator.

Destroy/Empower Undead (Su): At 3rd level, you gain

additional power over mindless undead. You can use two turn

or rebuke attempts as a single standard action, each dealing

(or  healing)  damage  as  per  the  Tenebrouss  rebuke  ability

(see above), except that the damage applies only to mindless

undead.

patron. This wide-ranging persecution might cause you to

resent others and even seek vengeance upon them.

If  you  are  a  member  of  a  Tenebrous  cult,  your  rank  is

probably based on experience and prior service to the sect.

Considering how small such cults are, however, rank might

hold little meaning, since youre one of probably only a hand-

ful of people.

likely to hate you if they ever learn what you really are, so your

compatriots within the cult might be your only allies.

Consider acquiring equipment that aids you in hiding your

true allegiance, augments your ability to command undead, or

offers you some long-range offensive capability. In addition,

try to acquire some magical protection and decent weaponry

so that melee becomes a viable choice for you.

COMBAT

Upon becoming a Tenebrous apostate, your best strategy is to

either hang back and use your spells to aid your allies, or select

a  lightly  armored  foe,  close  swiftly,  and  bring  your  target

down quickly in melee combat. As you advance in the prestige

class, you gain much greater power over undead, and your

abilities rival those of single-classed clerics of comparable

character level with respect to mindless undead. When you

reach the pinnacle of your abilities as a Tenebrous apostate,

you  can  engage  foes  with  little  risk  because  your  umbral

body form offers both protection from physical attacks and

unparalleled mobility.

ADVANCEMENT

You might have come to this prestige class through member-

ship in an Orcus sect or a cult of Tenebrous, or you might

simply have discovered the secret nature of this vestige while

progressing as a binder. If you belong to a sect dedicated to

either Orcus or Tenebrous, you begin your service by serving

as the eyes of your cult in other organizations and communi-

ties. At higher levels, you could become an enforcer for your

sect, or even a seeker of ancient lore.

As  you  attain  higher  levels,  focus  on  improving  your

Charisma score, but dont neglect your Wisdom score either.

Study  which  monsters  make  the  best  skeletons  and  zom-

biesnot merely from a combat perspective, but also in terms

of stealth or speed. Your ability to control and possess such

creatures opens up a wide range of strategic and tactical pos-

sibilities for you. When you select skills and spells, consider

focusing on those that enhance your deceptive abilities, such

as Bluff and anti-divination spells, since you cannot afford

to be exposed as a Tenebrous apostate.

RESOURCES

Perhaps the greatest resource others in your sect can offer you

is support and companionship. Everyone else in the world is

TENEBROUS APOSTATES

IN THE WORLD

They sell their souls not merely to a dark god, but to a false one. I

can think of no allegiance more vile.

Jozan, adventuring cleric and servant of Pelor

A Tenebrous apostate can help introduce the backstory of

Orcus and Tenebrous into your campaign, perhaps setting

up his divine resurrection as a future plotline. Even if you

have  no  intention  of  designing  an  adventure  around  this

vestige, a Tenebrous apostate serves as a wonderful foil for

other binders. Even the binder, so widely hated and feared

himself, has reason to hate and fear the Tenebrous apostate.

This character should seem quite alien to the PCs because it

combines the abilities of two classes normally considered to

be at odds. Finally, an apostates powers and patron prove that

even the most experienced binder does not truly understand

the nature of the vestiges with which he deals.

DAILY LIFE

Daily  life  for  most  Tenebrous  apostates  resembles  that  of

the ordinary people around them. Since they cannot allow

others (particularly civil and religious authorities) to  nd

out  that  they  are  binders,  let  alone  to  which  vestige  they

are constantly bound, they make every effort to behave like

their neighbors. Rites to revere Tenebrous are held in secret,

often hidden chambers or underground complexes. Only in

the most depraved societiesthose in which entities such

as  Orcus  are  already  worshiped  openlydo  followers  of

Tenebrous make themselves known.

Tenebrous apostates who manage to seize political power

usually make horri c dictators. Such leaders advance their

agendas by enslaving the people and forcing them to work

for  the  bene t  of  Tenebrouss  cult.  The  most  troublesome

are  sacri ced  and  converted  into  tireless  undead  workers

and  soldiers.  No  non-evil  rulers  who  adhere  to  the  tenets

65

of  Tenebrous  have  ever  been  recorded,  since  few  neutral

Tenebrous apostates are willing to engage in the sort of acts

necessary to usurp control of an entire community.

DC 20: Tenebrous was tightly linked to the demon prince

Orcus. Some say the two were once one and the same, but

that they somehow split into two entities.

NOTABLES

Within the ranks of the Tenebrous apostates, three names

stand out. The  rst is Suvas Jhond, a convert from the worship

of Vecna who now leads a sizable Tenebrous cult. The second

is Urluran Kafael, a powerful ghoul. Though she belongs to no

sect, she is perhaps the greatest undead Tenebrous apostate.

The third is the mysterious Luxx, who remains an enigma.

Legend has painted him as an orc, an elf, a hobgoblin, or an

ugly human, depending on the teller. Whatever his true race,

Luxx is said to have risen through the ranks of several Ten-

ebrous cults and destroyed them all from within. Despite this

history, he maintains his abilities and Tenebrouss favor, much

to the confusion of other apostates. Luxx is something of a

bogeyman to the various Tenebrous cults, all of which would

dearly love to capture him, learn his true goals, and  nd out

why Tenebrous has not punished his transgressions.

ORGANIZATION

No two cults of Tenebrous (or Orcus, for that matter) are set

up in the same way. In most instances, the more powerful

members be they clerics, Tenebrous apostates, or members

of some other classhold sway over the others. Advancement

often comes through the death of a superior. The only true

commonality among Tenebrous sects is the burning desire

to  see  the  former  god  return  to  his  divine  state  and  rise

higher,  eventually  becoming  the  ultimate  power  of  death

and darkness.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people who know the nature of Tenebrous apostates

react to them with hostility. Some hate them just for being

binders; others despise them for their worship of Tenebrous

as well as their perceived connection to the demon prince

Orcus.

Tenebrous sects are opposed by nearly all religious orga-

nizations  and  churches  (particularly  but  not  exclusively

good-aligned ones), by most governments, and even by some

Orcus cults. Oddly, Tenebrous apostates sometimes receive

kind treatment from devils, and a devil knowledgeable about

the prestige class might even be helpful.

TENEBROUS APOSTATE LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (the planes) or Knowl-

edge  (religion)  can  research  Tenebrous  apostates  to  learn

more  about  them.  When  a  character  makes  a  skill  check,

read or paraphrase the following, including the information

from lower DCs.

DC 10: The Tenebrous apostates are devout followers of a

spirit that was formerly a dark god of undeath.

DC 15: Tenebrous apostates combine clerical magic with

the ability to bind unholy spirits. They command undead

and manipulate darkness.

TENEBROUS APOSTATES

IN THE GAME

Tenebrous apostates might  rst appear in your campaign as

members of a religious sect opposed to the PCs, as a hidden

threat within an apparently normal community, or as rivals

that PC binders must thwart lest they do even more harm to

the classs already poor reputation.

The Tenebrous apostate appeals to players who enjoy por-

traying darker characters and prefer to focus on less direct

methods of confrontation. So long as they arent constantly

encountering situations that render their abilities useless,

and they can portray their need to hide from others without

turning every game into a run from the law situation, play-

ers should continue to enjoy the class.

ADAPTATION

Tenebrous apostates need not be connected inextricably to

Orcus. They could be operatives of any god or vestige of death,

although if you choose to lift the binder prerequisite from the

prestige class, youll need to  nd some other source for the

abilities that Tenebrous would normally grant. Alternatively,

the Tenebrous apostate class can serve as inspiration for the

creation of prestige classes speci c to other vestiges.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

PCs facing a Tenebrous apostate for the  rst time are unlikely

to know who their enemy really is. Tenebrous is not widely

known, and those who have heard of him believe him either

dead or wholly reverted to his Orcus persona. Thus, a Ten-

ebrous apostate might remain cloaked in mystery for a long

time before his true nature is revealed.

EL 15: The doppelganger Luxx learned pact magic from

the binder who enslaved him. He always bristled under his

masters command because he felt that he could not achieve

his  true  potential  while  working  in  his  masters  shadow.

Binding  to  Tenebrous,  however,  inspired  him  to  win  his

freedom.

Luxx saw himself in Tenebrouss story, and after murder-

ing his master, he began to worship Tenebrous as a deity.

Now  Luxx  seeks  out  other  Tenebrous  worshipers  to  set

them on what he sees as the proper pathtotal disengage-

ment  from  Orcus.  In  disguise,  he  in ltrates  Tenebrous

cults and kills those who seem to sympathize with Orcus

worshipers. Luxx is a perfectionist in all he does, and he

hates distractions.

The party might encounter Luxx as either a member or

leader of a Tenebrous cult. He could act as an ally or as an

enemy, depending on the PCs relationship with the target of

his next assassination attempt. If Luxx has been in the same

place long enough to establish a base, he probably already

has several undead under his command. True to the being

he worships, Luxx prefers shadows as servitors.

WITCH SLAYER

An insidious group, these binders. They are dangerous and unpre-

dictable, and they pose a signi cant risk to the divine order.

Sybelan, Seropaenean Witch Slayer

Witch slayers devote themselves to capturing and destroying

those who share their souls with other entities. Not content

with hunting only binders and other practitioners of pact

magic, they seek out and destroy anyone who gives up com-

mand of his soul. To a witch slayer, it doesnt matter whether

the target is a possessed wizard or a virtuous binder; anyone

who harbors two souls in the same vessel is an abomination.

Though they are often found in the employ of organizations

that oppose binders and demonologists, witch slayers serve

many different kinds of masters, so long as the pay is worth

the risk.

BECOMING A WITCH SLAYER

The ranger class offers a good selection of class features that

complement those gained from the witch slayer prestige class.

However, both of the skills required for entry into the class

are cross-class skills for a ranger. Fighters and paladins often

become witch slayers as well, and paladins have no problem

meeting the skill requirements. Clerics and wizards can make

excellent witch slayers, but the class is not popular among

spellcasters because it lacks a spellcasting progression.

The key ability for a witch slayer is Charisma because vari-

ous class featuresincluding the smite abilitydepend on

it. Wisdom is also important because it improves both Will

saves and awareness skills.

CLASS FEATURES

As a witch slayer, you gain abilities that help you  ght super-

natural agents possessing other beings.

Smite Spirit Sharer (Su): Once per day per witch slayer

level, you can smite a binder with a bound vestige or any

67

creature possessed by another (by means of malevolence, a

dual mind, or any similar ability) with a normal melee attack.

You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and

deal 1 extra point of damage per witch slayer level. If you

accidentally smite a creature that is not either possessed or

bound to a vestige, the smite has no effect, but the ability is

still used up for that day.

Mettle (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, you can shrug off

magical effects that could harm you. If you make a success-

ful  Will  or  Fortitude  saving  throw  that  would  normally

reduce (rather than negate) a spell or other magical effect,

the magic has no effect on you at all. Any spell that is nor-

mally negated by a successful saving throw is unaffected

by this ability.

Locate Possession (Su): By the time you attain 3rd level,

you  have  attuned  your  senses  to  discern  the  presence  of

possessing forces. By concentrating for a full round, you

can determine the presence or absence of any possessing

mind within a 60-foot cone. By concentrating for a second

full round, you can determine the location of the possessed

creature or object. A possessing creature whose Hit Dice

are  higher  than  your  character  level  can  attempt  a  Will

saving throw (DC 10 + your witch slayer level + your Cha

modi er) to avoid detection. An opponent that succeeds on

the saving throw has immunity to your locate possession

ability for 24 hours.

Slippery Mind (Ex): At 4th level, you gain the special

rogue ability slippery mind (PH 51).

Momentary Disjunction (Su): At 5th level, you can tem-

porarily disable the spellcasting, spell-like, and supernatural

abilities of a single creature within 30 feet as a swift action. If

the target fails a Will saving throw (DC 20 + your Cha modi-

 er), it cannot use spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural

abilities of any kind, as if affected by an antimagic  eld, for

1 round. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so

again for 5 rounds.

Multiclass Note: A paladin who becomes a witch slayer

can continue advancing as a paladin.

PLAYING A WITCH SLAYER

When hunting those who share their souls with other beings,

you must keep your wits about you and your weapon handy

at all times. You take pains to look like any other mercenary

because keeping a low pro le helps you track your quarry.

Be prepared to face any challenge. Many of those who house

extra souls are just fools who dabble in the forbidden, but

a few choose to accommodate demons, ghosts, or worse in

their bodies.

As a witch slayer, you perform tasks for a loosely structured

organization that is an outgrowth of the Order of Seropaenes

(see page 90). This organization is divided into numerous

local groups called coteries, each of which is led by three

senior witch slayers collectively known as the council. In all

probability, you were recruited by a senior member of one of

these coteries.

COMBAT

In  your   rst  battles  as  a  witch  slayer,  its  best  to  focus  on

eliminating  lackeys  and  minions  with  your  sword  while

you develop your defenses against magic. As you advance,

you gain the ability to avoid many magical effects that might

otherwise dissuade or damage you. Your mettle and slippery

mind abilities in particular protect you from many kinds of

magical attacks.

When you reach the pinnacle of your abilities, momentary

disjunction  becomes  your  most  lethal  weapon  in  a   ght

against binders or spellcasters. Use it when you are in posi-

tion to make a full attack, or to use some other maneuver

that disables the target when its defenses are down. Pair with

a tough melee specialist, such as a  ghter or barbarian, to

maximize the amount of damage you can deal, and always try

to eliminate your opponent quickly before she has a chance

to escape.

ADVANCEMENT

Witch  slayers  hungrily  recruit  followers  to  their  cause.

As  a  new  recruit,  you  are  expected  to  perform  the  scut

work, cooking, cleaning, guarding, and a variety of other

menial tasks for your coterie. During this period, you earn

the respect of your peers and prove your skills in combat

with either steel or spell. Upon attaining your  rst level of

witch slayer, you are welcomed as a full- edged member

of the coterie.

As  a  low-ranking  member,  you  are  assigned  many  dan-

gerous  jobs.  You  often  work  ahead  of  a  group  to  root  out

the possessed, or to scout a haunted site. All such tasks are

intended to test your mettle and help you prove your worth

to  the  group.  The  council  might  also  dispatch  you  to  kill

wanted  binders,  or  possibly  to  capture  them  on  behalf  of

some  employer  and  escort  them  to  a  designated  location.

In time, you can freelance, taking any side jobs you wish to

supplement your income and expand your experience.

Awareness skills are critical for a witch slayer, so keep your

Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot modi ers as high as

possible. Gather Information and Knowledge skills can give you

an edge in seeking out soul sharers, so its wise to devote some

skill points to those as well. Feats that augment your defenses

could  also  prove  useful,  so  pick  up  Combat  Expertise  and

Mobility if at all possible. For equipment, purchase items that

boost your saving throws. Cloaks of resistance, periapts of Wisdom,

amulets of health, and gloves of Dexterity are all great choices.

RESOURCES

Even the smallest coterie of witch slayers maintains a net-

work  of  sympathizers  and  contacts.  The  information  that

such  a  network  can  provide  about  known  and  suspected

binders is perhaps the greatest resource a coterie can offer,

since knowledge of a marks movements and habits is criti-

cal to the success of your missions. Membership in a coterie

grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Gather Information

checks regarding users of pact magic in communities that

are friendly to witch slayers.

68

In addition, witch slayer coteries have a reputation for get-

ting the job done when it counts. Thus, witch slayers from a

particularly well-known group can gain audiences with high

priests and in uential nobles immediately.

Finally, coteries enjoy steady employment. Even members

who do jobs on the side have an easier time  nding work

than  do  independent  adventurers.  A  member  of  a  coterie

receives a +2 bonus on Gather Information checks made to

seek employment.

WITCH SLAYERS IN THE WORLD

Relentless jackals, every one.

Maduvan, Dantalion-

Bound Knight of the

Sacred Seal

Any  party  of  PCs  that

includes  a  binder  can

expect  to  face  a  witch

slayer  at  some  point.  But

when  you  need  a  sinis-

ter  group  of  warriors  for

your campaign, consider a

coterie of witch slayers. Its

members are intimidating

veterans  of  supernatural

battles, hardened by their

experiences,  and  they

make unrelenting, impla-

cable  foes.  Many  large

religious institutions rely

exclusively on witch slay-

ers to track down heretics

and  enemies  of  the  faith.

In fact, witch slayers enjoy

such  prominence  in  the

major  churches  that  they

can typically come and go

as they please and set their

sights on any targets they

choose.

Croius Malter, a human witch slayer

DAILY LIFE

Most days, a witch slayer does nothing but waiteither for

the next job, or for information about a suspect to trickle in

from his spies. Thus, he has plenty of time to adventure and

is relatively free to undertake whatever side jobs or quests

he chooses. Even for such diversionary excursions, however,

witch slayers usually prefer missions that involve tracking

down undead,  ends, or rogue spellcasters.

NOTABLES

Oddly, the most famous witch slayer no longer claims to be

one. Michael Ambrose, a former paladin who is now garrison

commander at the Seropaenean Tower of Woe (see page 100),

once served on the council of a witch slayer coterie known

as  the  White  Swords.  During  his  tenure  with  the  coterie,

Ambrose and his allies single-handedly captured or killed

nearly  fty binders. The White Swords served the Church

of St. Cuthbert and became famous throughout the civilized

world for their effectiveness and righteous zeal.

However,  the  glory  of  this  near-legendary  group  did

not  last.  Perhaps  because  of  his  overly  zealous  efforts  at

exterminating binders, Michael eventually lost his paladin

abilities. Still he pressed on, believing that his god was merely

testing his faith. Slowly, Michael became less and less able

to distinguish between the heretic and the innocent, and

the atrocities he committed in the name of righteousness

became infamous. At last,

the  White  Swords  cast

him  out  of  their  coterie,

lest he tarnish their name

further.

Appalled,  Michael

joined the Order of Sero-

paenes  so  that  he  could

continue  his  mission  for

his god directly instead of

through  intermediaries

who  had  obviously  been

blinded by evil. On occa-

sion, the fact that he still

cannot communicate with

his god disturbs him. He

remains  convinced,  how-

ever, that this dif culty is

merely a test, and that one

day St. Cuthbert will show-

er him with blessings.

ORGANIZATION

No two witch slayer cote-

ries  are  the  same.  Some

consist  exclusively  of

paladins, while others wel-

come  only  witch  slayers

with clerical backgrounds,

and  still  others  are  open

to witch slayers who come

from  any  class.  Each  coterie  consists  of  ten  to  forty  core

members  (witch  slayers)  and  up  to  one  hundred  support

staff, including spies, servants, craftsmen, and mercenaries.

Each coterie has a name that is selected at its inception by its

three founders. Coterie names tend to be somewhat  ashy,

such as White Swords, Rooks, Conventicle of the Thirteen,

Crimson Moon Slayers, or the like.

The council that leads each coterie is made up of three

senior witch slayersone with a rogue emphasis, one with

a martial emphasis, and one with a spellcasting emphasis.

Their titles are Stealth, War, and Magic, respectively. War

oversees the coteries military arm, Stealth controls espio-

nage and assassination, and Magic manages the spellcasters.

As a body, the council makes all decisions about what jobs

to take, manages the expenditure of resources, and con rms

new  candidates.  Its  members  also  represent  the  group

to  potential  employersoften  the  Order  of  Seropaenes,

though various churches make extensive use of witch  slayers

as well.

The three leaders parcel out jobs to members of the cote-

rie based on their skills and seniority. Though they tend to

give new members rather dangerous tasks, they know their

members abilities quite well and dont risk lives needlessly. If

a given mark is unusually powerful, the council itself might

even undertake the job.

The council confers with the leaders of other coteries by

means of spells and messengers on matters that affect witch

slayers at large or issues that cross boundaries between areas

of in uence, but they otherwise maintain little contact with

other coteries. Once a year, each coteries council sends one of

its three members to a meeting held at a newly chosen secret

location. There the leaders discuss plans, mediate disputes,

determine territories, and manage any other business for the

upcoming year.

Although the council controls much of the coteries busi-

ness, an intricate hierarchy guides those beneath them. Each

leader has two advisors known as hands, who carry out orders

and pass along commands to underlings. Beneath each hand

are up to  ve  ngers, each of whom controls a squad of witch

slayers.  Promotion  is  based  on  both  merit  and  seniority.

Senior members receive  rst consideration for any vacancies

in higher positions, but the council sometimes does promote

newer members who prove more effective and useful to the

larger organization than their senior fellows.

Each  witch  slayer  coterie  stakes  a  claim  to  a  particular

region,  and  rivalries  sometimes  erupt  where  territories

overlap. Rivalries also exist within the coteries themselves,

since the members of each branch tend to see themselves as

better and more useful than the others. The council members

encourage such competition but are careful to prevent it from

getting out of hand.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people fear witch slayers. Commoners tend to shun them,

displaying an unfriendly attitude at best. Those few ordinary

folk who do not go out of their way to avoid witch slayers nev-

ertheless resent them, treating them with indifference.

Clerics  associated  with  the  Order  of  Seropaenes  are

generally friendly toward witch slayers, but even they have

reservations about such individuals. Overall, they consider

witch slayers an undesirable means to a good end. Clerics

not af liated with the order tend to be unfriendly because

they see witch slayers as zealotsmercenaries who accept

gold for the blood of innocents.

Binders are another matter entirely. Since witch slayers

exist to destroy users of pact magic, they represent a threat

not only to the binders livelihood, but also to his freedom

and his life. Binders and their ilk are always hostile to witch

slayers.

WITCH SLAYER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can research

witch slayers to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Witch slayers form groups called coteries that serve

various churches by hunting down and killing heretics.

DC  15:  Always  give  deference  to  a  witch  slayer,  lest  he

suspect you of being a heretic.

DC 20: Witch slayers are not beholden to any particular

god.  A  coterie  that  serves  the  Church  of  Vecna  one  week

might work for the Church of Heironeous the next.

DC 25: Witch slayers are most concerned about creatures

that share their soulsboth those that are possessed and

those that give up their souls willingly. To them, both kinds

of soul sharing merit death.

Contacting a group of witch slayers is easy. A successful DC

15 Gather Information check reveals whether a coterie exists

in a given city. A character wishing to hire a coterie gains a

+4 circumstance bonus on this check if she is a cleric, or a

+2 bonus otherwise. Alternatively, a PC can contact a local

church of Heironeous, Wee Jas, Vecna, or St. Cuthbert, since

all these institutions tend to keep coteries in their employ.

WITCH SLAYERS IN THE GAME

Witch slayers are natural foils for binders. A coterie follow-

ing up on a lead about a coven of anima mages or binders can

appear in the region where the characters are based at any

time. Alternatively, since witch slayers do know the value

of discretion, a coterie might always have been presentits

members might simply have chosen to act covertly until it

served their purpose to do otherwise.

A witch slayer can be a great character choice for a player

who likes mystery and intrigue. Witch slayers have the inves-

tigatory skills to track down their quarry and the combat

prowess to deal with foes when they  nd them. If you have

a witch slayer PC in your group, be sure to let him do some

investigation and interact with NPCs during his hunt.

ADAPTATION

Although witch slayers are designed as opponents for binder

PCs or NPCs, you can use this class even if you dont use

pact magic in your game. A witch slayer might, for example,

function as a maverick slayer of evil if you simply change the

smite soul sharer ability to smite evil.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

In an effort to ferret out a network of spies in the employ of

a binder, a group of witch slayers comes to town and begins

to  burn  down  homes  and  capture  citizens  without  expla-

nation. A witch slayer might approach the PCs for help in

locating  an  evil  anima  mage,  or  perhaps  a  fugitive  binder

hires the characters to escort him through territory held by

the White Swords.

EL 12: Croius Malter, a witch slayer and part-time cleric

of St. Cuthbert, corners the PCs in an alley with the aid of

his three mercenaries. He accuses a spellcaster in the party

of being a heretic and binder.

NEW SPELL: DETECT VESTIGE

Several witch slayer Magics worked together to develop this

spell for detecting the presence of vestiges.

DETECT VESTIGE

Divination

Level: Cleric 1, paladin 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Area: Cone-shaped emanation

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You focus your mind and let your senses probe the room, questing

and seeking for any trace of a bound vestige.

You  can  detect  an  aura  emanating  from  anyone  currently

bound to a vestige who is within the spells area. The amount

of information revealed about each shared soul depends on

how long you study a particular area, as follows.

1st Round: Presence or absence of vestige auras.

2nd Round: Number of vestige auras in the area and the

strength of the strongest vestige present.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each vestige-bound

individual. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you

discern its direction but not its exact location.

Aura Strength: The strength of a vestige aura is determined

by the minimum effective binder level necessary to summon

it, as given on the following table.

Minimum Effective

Binder Level

1st4th

5th9th

10th14th

15th or higher

Aura Strength

Faint

Moderate

Strong

Overwhelming

Each round, you can turn to detect vestige-bound individuals

in a new area. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but 1

foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead,

or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

71

PACT MAGIC FEATS

Both those who practice pact magic and those who oppose its

practitioners must learn a variety of specialized techniques

and strategies. The following feats offer binders and their

foes many different ways to interact with pact magic. Sev-

eral might also prove useful to monsters with supernatural

abilities.

BIND VESTIGE

You  know  how  to  make  pacts  with  otherworldly  spirits

called vestiges.

Bene  t: By employing a short ritual, you can contact a

vestige and make a pact with it. You are treated as a 1st-level

binder for this purpose, regardless of your character level.

Thus,  only  1st-level  vestiges  are  available  to  you,  and  you

can bind to only one vestige at a time. Furthermore, unlike

characters with the soul binding class feature, you gain only

one power from the vestige you bind, as given on Table 19:

Bind Vestige Feat Abilities.

To contact a vestige, you must draw its unique seal visibly

on a surface (generally the ground), making the image at

least  5  feet  across.  Drawing  a  seal  requires  the  ability  to

mark  a  surface  and  10  consecutive  rounds  of  concentra-

tion, and the act provokes attacks of opportunity. A seal not

used within 1 minute of its drawing loses all potency, and

you must draw a new one to contact the vestige. A vestige

might also have other requirements for contact, as noted in

its entry (see page 18).

Once the seal is drawn, you must perform a ritual requiring

a full-round action to summon the corresponding vestige.

During this time, you must touch the seal and call out to the

vestige using both its name and its title. The ritual fails if you

cannot be heard (for example, if you are within the area of a

silence spell). Otherwise, a manifestation of the vestige appears

in the seals space as soon as you  nish the ritual. This image

is not the actual vestige; it is merely a  gmentan illusion

that cannot harm or be harmed by any creature. Creatures

that interact with the image or study it carefully automati-

cally recognize it as illusory. The summoned image ignores

everyone but you, and if you fail to address it for 1 round, it

disappears whence it came. The vestige speaks in whatever

language you used to call it.

To make a pact with your summoned vestige, you must

make a binding check (1d20 + your effective binder level +

your Cha modi er). This process requires 1 minute, but you

can choose to make a rushed binding check as a full-round

action at a 10 penalty. The DC for this check is provided in

the description of each vestige. You must make your perilous

pact alone; others cannot aid you in any way.

Whether the binding check succeeds or fails, you gain the

power granted by the vestige for 24 hours. During that time,

you cannot rid yourself of the vestige unless you possess the

Expel Vestige feat. If you fail the binding check, however, the

vestige in uences your personality and your actions, and you

are said to have made a poor pact. (Speci cally, the vestiges

presence changes your general demeanor, and it can force

you to perform or refrain from certain actions. The in uence

of each vestige is described in its individual entry.) If your

binding check is successful, the vestige has no control over

your actions and does not in uence your personality. In this

case, you are said to have made a good pact.

While under the in uence of a vestige, you must adhere

to its requirements to the best of your ability. If you are con-

scious and free-willed and you encounter a situation in which

you cannot or will not refrain from a prohibited action or

perform a required one, you take a 1 penalty on attack rolls,

saving throws, and checks until that vestige leaves you.

As long as you are bound to a vestige, you manifest a speci c

physical sign of its presence, as given in its entry. This sign is

real, not an illusory or shapechanging effect, and someone

using true seeing perceives it just as it is. You can hide a sign

by mundane or magical means without penalty.

The vestige is bound to your soul by the pact. It cannot be

targeted or expelled by any means except the Expel Vestige

feat, nor can it be suppressed except by an antimagic  eld or

similar effect.

The Dif culty Class for a saving throw against any super-

natural powers granted by a vestige is 10 + 1/2 your effective

binder level + your Cha modi er.

Special: Characters who have the ability to bind vestiges

through other means (such as the soul binding class feature)

cannot take this feat. If you become a binder after taking the

feat, you lose its bene t.

BIND VESTIGE, IMPROVED

You can bind a wider range of vestiges.

Prerequisite: Bind Vestige.

Benefit: When you bind a vestige using the Bind Ves-

tige feat, you do so as though you were a 5th-level binder.

Thus, you have access to vestiges up to 3rd level, though

you still can bind only one at a time and gain only one

power from it.

DEFENSE AGAINST THE

SUPERNATURAL

Your in-depth knowledge of supernatural forces grants you

greater ability to resist their effects.

Prerequisite: Knowledge (arcana) 2 ranks.

Bene  t:  You  gain  a  +2  insight  bonus  on  saving  throws

made to resist supernatural special attacks.

EMPOWER SUPERNATURAL ABILITY

You can use a supernatural ability with greater effect than

normal.

Prerequisites: 6 HD, supernatural ability.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can empower a supernatural

ability. When you use an empowered supernatural ability,

all variable, numeric effects of the supernatural ability are

increased by one-half. An empowered supernatural ability

deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again

as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, and so

on as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls (such as

the one made when you cast dispel magic) and supernatural

abilities without random variables are not affected. You must

declare use of this feat before you use the ability. A continu-

ous use ability (such as a gaze attack) can be empowered for

only 1 round. Empowering a supernatural ability does not

require a separate action.

An  empowered  supernatural  ability  cannot  be  maxi-

mized.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, you can empower a supernatural ability one addi-

tional time per day. You cannot empower a particular use of

a supernatural ability more than once.

ENLARGE SUPERNATURAL ABILITY

You can increase the range of a supernatural attack.

Prerequisites: 4 HD, supernatural ability.

Bene  t:  Once  per  day,  you  can  enlarge  a  supernatural

ability. When you use an enlarged supernatural ability, its

range increases by 100%. You must declare use of this feat

before you use the ability. A continuous use ability (such as

a gaze attack) can only be enlarged for 1 round. Enlarging a

supernatural ability does not require a separate action.

This feat does not affect the length of a line or a cone, the

diameter of an emanation (such as a gaze attack or frightful

presence), or the range of any supernatural ability not de ned

by distance.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, you can enlarge a supernatural ability one addi-

tional time per day. You cannot enlarge a particular use of a

supernatural ability more than once.

EXPEL VESTIGE

You can expel a vestige to which you are bound before the

duration of its pact with you has expired.

Prerequisite: Soul binding.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can attempt to expel a vestige

to which you are bound. To do so, you must draw its seal and

go through the entire process of summoning it again. If you

succeed  on  the  new  binding  check,  you  expel  the  vestige

before it would normally leave you, and you can summon

a different one to replace it if you wish. Regardless of your

success  or  failure  in  expelling  the  vestige,  you  take  a  10

penalty on your next binding check with any vestige, and

apply the same penalty on your binding check the next time

you summon the vestige you expelled.

Normal: A bound vestige does not leave you until 24 hours

have passed since its summoning.

You can cause a supernatural ability with a duration to last

longer than normal.

Prerequisites: 4 HD, supernatural ability.

Bene  t:  Once  per  day,  you  can  extend  a  supernatural

ability that has a duration. When you use an extended super-

natural ability, it lasts twice as long as normal. A supernatural

ability  that  has  a  duration  of  concentration,  that  happens

instantaneously, or that permanently affects a target is not

affected by this feat. You must declare the use of this feat

before you use the ability. Extending a supernatural ability

does not require a separate action.

it is taken, you can extend a supernatural ability one addi-

tional time per day. You cannot extend a particular use of a

supernatural ability more than once.

before you use the ability. Widening a supernatural ability

does not require a separate action.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time

it is taken, you can widen a supernatural ability one addi-

tional time per day. You cannot widen a particular use of a

supernatural ability more than once.

must declare the use of this feat before you use the ability.

PACT MAGIC ITEMS

Binders rarely possess the power to craft magic items because

pact  magic  is  too  dissimilar  to  spellcasting  for  its  use  to

facilitate item creation. Even so, some binders who become

powerful  spellcasters  choose  to  apply  their  knowledge  of

arcane or divine magic to the creation of implements useful

in pact magic.

CHIME OF SUPPRESSION

A chime of suppression helps you gain control of an unruly

vestige.

Lore: During the time of Syfal, binders created

and used these items to conceal the vestiges they

bound while they were hunted by the Seropaene-

ans. (Knowledge [religion] DC 25)

Description: This triangular brass instrument

is inscribed with strange runes and feels unusu-

ally light. One end features a hinged handle

made of rosewood and a chain, also brass,

that ends in a metal striker.

The  runes  are  the  confounding

seals of the vestiges, reinforced with

additional  markings  that  suggest

control  and  power.  When  struck,

the instrument produces an unset-

tling,  echoing  chime  that  can  be

heard only by the wielder.

Prerequisite:  This  item  func-

tions  only  if  the  wielder  is  bound

to a vestige.

Implements

of binding

Activation: As a standard action,

you touch the striker to the chime.

You can use a chime three times per day, and its effect lasts

for 1 minute. You can only target a vestige within yourself

with a chime of suppression.

Effect: A chime of suppression temporarily sti es one of

your  bound  vestiges  (chosen  by  you  at  the  time  of  use),

forcing its will into the dark corners of your mind. For the

duration of the effect, you lose access to all the abilities

granted by the spirit, but it has no in uence over you, and

you do not show its sign.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration. CL 7th.

Construction:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  soul  binding

ability, dismissal, 1,900 gp, 152 XP, 2 days.

Weight: 1/2 lb.

IMPLEMENTS OF BINDING

Implements  of  binding  enhance  your  ability  to  bind  and

control  vestiges.  They  help  to  focus  your  concentration

during the binding process and provide incentive for the

spirit to be amenable to your will.

Description:  Inside  an  intricately  carved  teak  box,  a

set of unusual objects rests upon a red velvet cushion. The

items are an ivory chalice, a bronze serpentine knife, and

three perfectly spherical crystals.

When you use implements of binding, the knife vibrates

and  the  chalice  creates  a  soft  ringing  sound,  while  the

three stones glow with the brightness of candles.

Prerequisite:  Only  characters  with  the  soul  binding

class feature can use this item.

Activation: As part of the time it takes to draw a vestiges

seal properly (see page 17), you can use implements of

binding to aid the process of pact making. You

must begin by placing the three crystals

around  the  seal  to  form  an  inverted

triangle.  Then  you  use  the  knife  to

cut  a  small  incision  in  each  of  your

palms,  dealing  a  total  of  1  point  of

damage,  and  squeeze  the  blood  into

the chalice.

Effect: Implements of binding provide

a +2 competence bonus on your binding

check to make a pact with a summoned

vestige. In combat, the knife functions as

a nonmagical masterwork dagger.

Aura/Caster  Level:  Faint  transmuta-

tion. CL 3rd.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, soul

binding ability, eagles splendor, 1,130 gp, 32 XP,

2 days.

Variants:  +1  on  binding  checks  (600  gp),  +4

on binding checks (+2,400 gp), +6 on binding checks

(+6,400 gp), +8 on binding checks (+12,000 gp).

Weight: 10 lb.

Price: 1,530 gp.

SOUL LENS

A soul lens re nes and augments the abilities granted by

a vestige.

Description: A soul lens is a sapphire monocle held inside

a gold ring. Whenever the wearer uses a supernatural abil-

ity granted by a vestige and augments it with this item, the

lens  ashes with a soft blue light.

Prerequisite:  You  must  be  bound  to  a  vestige  to  use

this item.

Activation: Using a soul lens is not an action; you simply

wear the item. It  lls the goggle slot.

Effect: While you wear a soul lens, the save DC of any

supernatural  ability  bestowed  upon  you  by  a  vestige

increases by 1.

Aura/Caster Level: Faint transmutation. CL 3rd.

Construction:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  soul  binding

ability, eagles splendor, 6,000 gp, 480 XP, 6 days.

Weight: 

Price: 12,000 gp.

SEAL OF THE SPIRIT

A seal of the spirit provides a permanent and reusable seal

for summoning a particular vestige.

Lore: Each seal is keyed to a speci c spirit. (Knowledge

[arcana] or Knowledge [religion] DC 25; Knowledge [the

planes] DC 30)

The Seropaenean Order is desperate to acquire and

destroy  these  items.  (Knowledge  [religion]

DC 35)

Description:  This  silky  black

bundle  of  cloth  unfolds  into  a

square 5 feet across. A wide circle

with peculiar lines inside it is

embroidered on the fabric with

gold thread.

When activated, a seal of the

spirit binds itself to a surface

and remains  xed until the

binding process is  nished.

Throughout the entire bind-

ing  process,  the  seal  emits  a

pulsing and  ickering red light

with the brightness of a torch.

Prerequisite:  Only  characters

with the soul binding class feature can

use this item.

Activation: As a standard action, you activate

a seal of the spirit by speaking its command word

(usually the name of the spirit keyed to it) and placing it

on a  at and steady surface. Once activated, the seal func-

tions  until  either  you  bind  the  vestige  or  it  leaves  of  its

own accord. You can use a particular seal of the spirit once

per day.

Effect: Once activated, a seal of the spirit serves as the

seal you would otherwise draw during the ritual required

to contact a vestige. Since you need not draw the seal to

contact the spirit, the item considerably reduces the time

it takes to conjure the entity. The seal does not negate any

other  requirements  for  summoning  a  particular  vestige.

For more information on binding vestiges, see the binder

class description (page 9).

Price: 6,000 gp.

TEETH OF DAHLVER-NAR

The strange and wondrous teeth of Dahlver-Nar give you a

physical link to the vestiges and their power.

Lore: The teeth of Dahlver-Nar bear the name of the  rst

human to use them.  Rumor among the ignorant holds that

the teeth tie your soul to  endish forces, granting them

control over your body and even your thoughts. (Knowledge

[history] DC 30)

No  one  knows  who  created  the  teeth,  or  even  how  it

was done. Binder scholars debate whether the items can

be  created  at  allmany  contend  that  a  new  one  simply

comes into being when a soul transforms into a vestige.

(Knowledge [arcana] DC 30)

Individual teeth of Dahlver-Nar have occasionally

been destroyed, but a new version of a destroyed

tooth  always  crops  up  at  some  later  date.

However, no more than one version of a

particular tooth ever exists at any given

time. (Knowledge [history] DC 35)

Several versions of the story about

the origin of the teeth of Dahlver-Nar

exist, but one aspect of it remains

constant:  Dahlver-Nar,  a  human

cleric,  discovered  the  teeth  and

made  them  known  through  his

use  of  their  powers.  (Knowledge

[history] DC 30)

Legend says that using the teeth

too often or using too many of them

at once can drive the user mad or turn

her into a tooth beast (see page 88). How

much  of  this  tale  is  truth  and  how  much  is

 ction remains to be seen. Many binders have

attempted  to   nd  out  by  collecting  all  the

teeth, but as yet no one has managed to obtain

Teeth of Dahlver-Nar

all of them at once. (Knowledge [history] DC 30)

Description: Teeth of Dahlver-Nar differ in appearance

according to their associated vestiges. Many look like the

teeth of various humanoids; others appear more unusual.

Eurynomes tooth, for example, is a molar as big as a dwarfs

 st, Acereraks tooth is a ruby shaped like a cuspid, and

Zagans tooth is a snake fang the length of an elfs hand.

Each tooth is inscribed with the seal of a vestigethough

it is unbound by the outer circle common to vestige seals.

The teeth change size to  t the users mouth, but only just.

Chupoclopss tooth juts out of the users mouth in the form

of a tusk, beside the two created by his sign.

Activation:  To  employ  one  of  these  items,  you  must

remove one of your own teeth and put the tooth of Dahlver-

Nar in its place. This bloody process requires a full-round

action and deals 1 point of damage. Afterward, your tooth is

permanently gone; you cannot later replace it after remov-

ing the tooth of Dahlver-Nar. A regenerate spell replaces lost

teeth, so long as no teeth of Dahlver-Nar occupy the spaces

of  missing  teeth  at  the  time  of  casting.  Replacing  your

teeth with teeth of Dahlver-Nar does not affect bite damage

or give you a bite attack if you normally lack one.

You must have a tooth of Dahlver-Nar in your mouth for

one full day before you can use its ability. During that time,

you show the sign of the associated vestige and are under

its in uence, as described in the Effect section below.

After the tooth has been in your mouth for 24 hours, you

can activate or deactivate any continuous abilities it grants

as  a  standard  action.  Other  abilities  require  a  standard

action to use. Use of an ability granted by this item never

provokes  an  attack  of  opportunity,  but  effects  produced

by  a  tooth  of  Dahlver-Nar  are  not  supernatural;  they  can

be dispelled and suppressed in the same way as those of

other magic items. A creature cannot target a tooth in your

mouth for the purpose of sundering or magic effects other

than dispel magic. The only way a foe can get your tooth is

to render you helpless and physically remove it. Such a

removal deals no damage.

Using  teeth  of  Dahlver-Nar  does  not  give

you the ability to bind a vestige for the

purpose of meeting the prerequisites

of  a  feat  or  a  prestige  class.  Teeth  of

Dahlver-Nar do not occupy a magic

item body slot.

Effect: Placing a tooth of Dahlver-

Nar  in  your  mouth  grants  you  a

special magical ability, but it also links

your soul and body to the vestige with

which the tooth is associated. When the

tooth is in your mouth, you show the sign

of the associated vestige, just as you would

if you had actually bound it. In addition, you

are automatically under its in uence, as though

you  were  a  binder  who  had  failed  a  binding

check. If you choose to ignore the vestiges in u-

ence, you take the normal penalty for doing so. The penalty

lasts until the tooth is removed, but you can still use its

power. As normal, the penalties of ignoring the in uences

of multiple vestiges stack.

These effects of a tooth of Dahlver-Nar cannot be avoided

by making a binding check, or by using the suppress sign

ability. If you have access to multiple teeth of Dahlver-Nar,

you can use as many as you wish simultaneously, but you

show the signs and are under the in uence of all of them.

Although some vestiges grant natural attacks associated

with  their  signs,  you  do  not  gain  those  attackseven

though you show the same signunless the tooth actually

grants that power.

Each tooth of Dahlver-Nar grants an ability similar to one

granted by the associated vestige. The effects of the teeth

are not supernatural. They are spell-like effects and follow

all the normal rules for suchthey can be suppressed by

a targeted dispel magic, for example. A tooth of Dahlver-Nar

is activated by a command wordspeci cally, the name

of the associated vestige. The effects of the speci c teeth

are given below, along with their saving throw DCs.

Prerequisite: You must have the soul binding ability to

use this magic item.

Activation: As a full-round action, you can call forth

a vestige you have previously bound into the box, willing

it to leave the phylactery and enter your body. To bind a

vestige into the box, resolve the binding as normal, except

that the binding DC increases by 10. You can bind a spirit

into a vestige phylactery once per day, and you can call a spirit

from it once per day. The box does not occupy an item slot,

but you must hold it in one hand to activate it.

Effect: Upon activating the phylactery, you immediately

bind to the vestige inside it. If doing so would cause the

number of vestiges bound to you to exceed your normal

limit,  you  expel  a  vestige  of  your  choice  (prematurely

ending its binding) releasing it to make room for the one

from the phylactery. The released vestige does not auto-

matically enter the phylactery. You can only call a vestige

from the phylactery if you bound the vestige yourself. If

you  have  not  bound  a  vestige  into  the  phylactery  when

you activate this item, you gain no bene t and instead are

stunned for 1d4 rounds. Once the exchange is complete,

you lose all the abilities granted by the departed vestige

and gain those granted by the new vestige. You show the

vestiges sign (or not) as normal. You are in uenced by the

new  vestige  if  you  failed  your  binding  check  when  you

placed  it  into  the  phylactery.  You  remain  bound  to  the

vestige from the phylactery based on the time you bound

it into the phylactery. A vestige can only be bound into a

phylactery for a maximum of 24 hours, after which time

it is automatically released.

VESTIGE PHYLACTERY

A vestige phylactery allows you to bind an alternate vestige

so that you can swap one spirit for another without having

to go through a second ritual. Vestige phylacteries are always

found empty.

Lore: Vestige phylacteries were the last magic items crafted

by the  rst followers of Syfal. They were designed to give

binders better tools with which to combat their enemies.

(Knowledge [history] DC 35)

Description: A vestige phylactery is an ornately carved

jade  cube  measuring  about  6  inches  on  a  side.  Runes  of

power  and  magical  inscriptions  of  binding  cover  every

surface. The box has no apparent means of opening.

When a phylactery houses a vestige, it shakes and moves

as if alive. Whenever you exchange a bound vestige for the

one  in  the  box,  it   ares  brightly  and  turns  translucent.

Diminutive  gments of the vestiges momentary grapple

as they cross paths going to and from the phylactery.

PACT MAGIC MONSTERS

Vestiges nibble at the edges of the world. Their interaction

with  it  remains  imperceptible  but  extant,  like  a  presence

unseen  and  unheard  that  nevertheless  raises  hairs  on  the

backs of peoples necks and sends chills down their spines.

Binders bring vestiges more fully into contact with reality,

but another connection might also exist. Certain creatures

bear a striking resemblance to vestiges, whether because they

are  actual  descendants  of  the  vestiges  once-living  forms,

creatures warped by contact with vestiges, or the results of

some cosmic synchronicity. Their resemblance to vestiges

might also be no more than a strange coincidence.

The wild and alien creatures known as deadly dancers make

terrifying foes. Humans dubbed them dancers because of

their  unique  method  of  locomotion,  and  deadly  for  their

bladelike appendages and relentless attacks.

When a deadly dancer stands erect and still, its lithe body

approaches 8 feet in height. When it spins, however, it seems

closer to 5 feet tall because of the way its body bends. A deadly

dancer has tough gray skin and pale yellow eyes, and a typical

specimen weighs about 200 pounds. Its arms and legs end in

long bone blades that seem smooth but are actually porous.

This quality allows deadly dancers to draw in the blood that

serves as their nourishment.

Deadly dancers need to soak their arm and leg blades

in blood at least once a week or starve. Thus, even a

short period of poor hunting can drive them to

Deadly  dancers  lack  mouths,  so  they

cannot speak. They communicate with one

another through complex gesturesin

fact, their language takes the form of

a dance. However, they can learn to

understand other languages.

COMBAT

A  deadly  dancer  never  stops  moving

in combat. It tumbles into the midst of

foes, slashes at all within reach, and then

tumbles to a different spot to slash at the

same enemies again. Even when not using

its improved whirlwind attack, a deadly

dancer  can  balance  on  one  leg  or  arm,

and lash out at foes with each of its three

other appendages.

Augmented Critical (Ex): Each of a

deadly dancers appendage blades threat-

ens a critical hit on a natural attack roll

of  1820  and  deals  triple  damage  on  a

successful critical hit.

Improved Whirlwind Attack (Ex):

As  a  standard  action,  a  deadly  dancer

can  make  one  appendage  blade  attack

A  deadly  dancer  retains  its  Dexterity

by  an  invisible  attacker,  and  it  cannot

be  anked except by a rogue of at least

8th level.

Deadly dancer

Beyond these details, deadly dancer culture and society

remain mysterious. Few members of other races have been

able to get past their dancing language and violent natures

to discover any hard facts. Binder scholars theorize that the

ancestors of the deadly dancers were human or elf binders

who dedicated themselves to Paimon and somehow drew too

much of the vestige into their beings.

DEADLY DANCER SOCIETY

Deadly  dancer  communities  are  little  more  than  small

nomadic hunting parties that hide from the civilizations of

other races. Since they cannot easily manipulate objects or

build shelters, they gravitate toward warm climates that offer

ready safe havens, such as caves. During a hunt, every deadly

dancer in the troupe participates, including the young.

Deadly  dancers  are  sexless  creatures.  Each  can  procre-

ate alone simply by breaking off an armblade in the fresh

corpse of a Medium creature. The blade then grows into a

new, full-grown deadly dancer over a

period  of  seven  to  ten  days.  Break-

ing  off  an  armblade  is  a  painful

process  for  the  parent,  which

takes 2d8 points of damage and

loses one appendage attack from

its  full  attack  routine,  as  well

as  the  ability  to  make  improved

whirlwind attacks. The dancer can

heal the damage naturally, but it

does not regain its lost attack and

the ability to make whirlwind

attacks  until  the  lost  blade

fully regrowsa process that

takes about a month. Further-

more,  roughly  half  the  time,

breaking off the armblade

causes a wound that con-

tinues to bleed at a rate of 1

hit point per minute. Since

the deadly dancer culture has

no  clerics  and  the  creatures

lack  the  ability  to  manipulate

bandages or bind wounds, such

bleeding usually means death for

the parent. Thus, a deadly dancer

is usually willing to procreate only

if its own death or the destruction of

its troupe seems certain.

Knowing how attached deadly dancers are to

their troupes, some unscrupulous slavers have cap-

tured the creatures for use as assassins, gladiators,

or guards. Because deadly dancers can learn to understand

other languages, a patient slaver can teach them to take orders,

and by holding the majority of the troupe captive, he can

ensure that those individuals he releases comply precisely

with those orders.

Deadly dancers revere Paimon as a deity, although none

seem to draw any power from this worship. They mark their

territory by scoring trees and stones with Paimons seal, and

troupes of them sometimes gather to engage in week-long

revelries. During such events, they dance together in compli-

cated patterns designed to scribe Paimons seal across a large

clearing. Although they have the ability to draw Paimons

seal, none of them seem to be binders.

Grinning through rotted lips, it rises on these hair tentacles to the

height of a man.

Binders dont like to admit it, but deathsheads were probably

 rst created by a binder necromancer who had an af nity

for  the  vestige  called  Shax.  Now,  the  creatures  come  into

being through the depraved actions of evil spellcasters and

a ritual that involves the drowning of a giant. Initially, the

spellcasters who used this ritual were also giants, but over

the years, wicked members of other races have learned the

practice and come to understand its value.

Deathsheads are valuable to necromancers because they

possess  great  knowledge  about  all  subjects  and  can  act  as

oracles.  In  fact,  a  deathshead  shows  great  ability  with  all

qualities associated with the head. For example, each pos-

sesses  keen  perception  and  a  silver  tongue  in  addition  to

great knowledge. While these qualities make a deathshead

invaluable, its powerful mind can also endanger a careless

creator, since it can dominate other creatures simply by touch-

ing them. A deathshead often climbs onto a dominated foe

and rides it as though it were a mount.

Deathsheads most often serve powerful spellcasters, but

some escape control or survive after their masters deaths.

When not under anyones control, a deathshead usually seeks

to dominate either the most powerful creature in the area or

the leader of a powerful group of creatures. Although most

living creatures  nd undead disturbing, many communities

(even those of ostensibly good-aligned creatures) willingly

submit to the rule of a deathshead to bene t from its great

knowledge. Once in power, a deathshead does everything it

can to maintain and increase that power, including disguis-

ing its in uence.

A deathshead looks like the partially rotted head of a giant

with long hair matted into several ropelike tendrils. The type

of giant varies, but the hairless stone giants are never turned

into deathsheads. By the same logic, female deathsheads are

slightly more common than males, since male giants often

keep their hair shorter than their female counterparts. The

size  of  a  deathsheads  body  depends  on  the  type  of  giant

head used to create it, but most range between 2 and 3 feet in

diameter. A deathshead typically weighs about 100 pounds

and stands approximately 4 feet tall on its hair tentacles.

A deathshead speaks Common, Giant, and up to three other

languages spoken by its creator.

COMBAT

Although it can be fearsome in melee, a deathshead generally

prefers to employ a foe as a weapon against other enemies.

Typically,  it  dominates  the  best  combatant  sent  against  it,

then  rides  that  individual  into  combat  against  its  other

enemies. During the ensuing melee, it often tries to capture

and dominate a spellcaster so that it can  nish off the others

or escape. Because a deathshead usually rides foes without a

saddle, it takes a 5 penalty on Ride checks for riding bare-

back. A deathshead that dominates its mount automatically

succeeds on Ride checks made to guide with knees, leap, spur

its mount, and control its mount in battle, and the dominated

creature is considered a war-trained mount.

A spellcaster of 15th to 17th level can create a deathshead by

casting a create undead spell on the severed head of a drowned

giant with long hair.

Dominating Contact (Su): When in a grapple, a deaths-

head can dominate its foe as if using the dominate monster

spell (caster level equal to its Hit Dice; Will DC 19 negates) as

a standard action. Only the sustained contact of a grapple is

suf cient for the deathshead to establish dominance, a simple

touch attack has no effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

A deathshead can control a dominated creature only so

long as it maintains physical contact with it. Doing so usually

requires the deathshead to remain in the dominated creatures

square and either ride on or be carried by its victim. Thus,

deathsheads  typically  attempt  to  dominate  very  strong  or

large individuals that can support them easily unless they

intend to gain a brief bene tsuch as forcing a spellcaster

to use some spells against his allies. A deathshead can stand

next to a dominated creature and simply hold it with a ten-

tacle, but such an arrangement is risky in combat.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a deathshead must

hit an opponent with a hair lash attack. It can then attempt

to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack

of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a

hold and can try to dominate the opponent in the following

round.

A deathshead has a +10 racial bonus on grapple checks,

which is included in the statistics above.

Freedom of Movement (Su): A deathshead has a continu-

ously active freedom of movement ability, as the spell (caster

level equals your effective binder level).

Skills: A deathshead has a +10 racial bonus on Knowledge

checks. It also has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can

always choose to take 10 on a Climb check, even if rushed or

threatened. In addition, a deathshead has a+8 racial bonus on

any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard.

It can always take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted

or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming,

provided it swims in a straight line.

using them as guardians.

A horned beast measures between 4 and 5 feet long and

weighs about 175 pounds. It hunts at night, howling in the

distance at the sight of prey then creeping silently toward

it  before  charging  out  of  the  darkness.  During  the  day,  it

retreats into a cave or rests in a dark copse of trees because

it  nds bright light painful.

Pact magic grimoires say that when Amon was a god of light

and law, a cadre of wise golden rams served him as messen-

gers and helpmates. When he fell into obscurity, his golden

rams lived on. Over the centuries, however, they changed

as Amon did, eventually becoming the horned beasts. Thus,

most binders refer to horned beasts as the  ock of Amon.

A  black-furred  creature  with  curling

to  run,  a  screeching  howl

issues from its throat, and its

Horned beasts are horrible

creatures  that  rove  over

malicious acts and delight in

the  fear  and  horror  they  can

create. Packs of these creatures

have been known to harry prey

for  hours  before  attacking  to  kill,

and  a  pack  that  attacks  a  group  of

creatures might purposely leave a few injured but alive in

order to enjoy their heightened terror during the next attack.

POWERFUL CHARGE

The  Powerful  Charge  feat  appears  on  page  207  of  Monster

Manual III, and is reprinted here for convenience.

POWERFUL CHARGE

A creature with this feat can charge with extra force.

Prerequisites: Medium or large, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: When the creature charges, if its melee attack hits,

it deals an extra 1d8 points of damage (if it is of Medium size).

For Large creatures, the extra damage is 2d6 points; for Huge,

3d6; for Gargantuan, 4d6; and for Colossal, 6d6.

This  feat  only  works  when  the  creature  makes  a  charge.  It

does not work when the creature is mounted. If the creature has

the ability to make multiple attacks after a charge, it can apply

this extra damage only to one of those attacks.

Special: A fighter can select Powerful Charge as one of his

fighter bonus feats.

Unsheathing his longsword with a  ourish, the human grins in

anticipation of a  ght, winking at his foe to egg him on. One of his

eyes is blue; the other is brown. A shock of white runs through his

long, dark hair.

Karsites are a subrace of humans born at random among the

human population.

When  the  vestige  called  Karsus  yet  lived  as  a  powerful

wizard,  he  fathered  many  children  among  his  slaves  and

supplicants. Then his failed attempt to steal power from the

deity of magic shattered his peoples empire and spread them

across the world. Thus, over more than a thousand years, his

bloodline has tainted nearly every human population, and

at times it grows strong enough for a human to give birth to

a karsite. When two karsites mate, they breed true.

Karsites appear human overall, but they have two distin-

guishing traits. First, each has one pale blue eye and one eye of

another color common to humans. A karsite also has a shock

of white hair on his head. These traits appear infrequently

among normal humans, and almost never at the same time.

In communities where karsites mate exclusively with one

another, other features also become common, such as straight

blond or black hair, a sharp widows peak, and a small nose

and mouth.

Karsite  infants  appear  as  normal  humans,  but  as  they

mature, their strange appearances and powers appear. Most

karsites gain their birthright by the time they reach puberty,

but for some it comes sooner or later. Superstitious humans

often view the change in an emerging karsites appearance as

a sign of a blessing or curse, but few suspect that it is both.

Karsuss bloodline allows a matured karsite to resist non-

magical blows and to turn spells cast against him into healing

magic, but it also prevents him from ever casting any spell.

Karsites  born  among  humans  might  live  and  die  without

ever  knowing  that  their  unusual  appearance  comes  with

wondrous abilities, but others discover their birthright when

they attempt to take up the path of a spellcaster, or when vio-

lence leaves them less harmed than it should. Communities

of karsites often seek out such foundlings to indoctrinate

QUICK AND EASY KARSITES

You  dont  have  to  build  karsite  NPCs  from  the  ground  up.

Simply add the racial traits described above to any nonspell-

casting human NPC you already have. Even NPCs the player

characters  have  known  for  years  might  secretly  be  karsites.

In  fact,  you  can  dispense  with  changing  statistics  by  simply

assuming  that  the  human  in  question  has  already  benefited

from the karsite racial bonus to Constitution and Charisma.

Just  adjust  the  NPCs  challenge  rating  and  add  the  special

abilities, and youre done.

Consider  allowing  the  same  kind  of  conversion  for  players

with human PCs who want to play karsites. Perhaps the char-

acter has been a karsite all along, but his powers matured late

in  his  life.  The  karsite  abilities  come  with  a  level  adjustment,

however, so consider this option carefully. It might not be fun

for other players to see the karsite players PC suddenly surpass

their characters capabilities. On the other hand, if the human

PC has fallen behind in levels, or if other party members have

benefited from templates that grant level adjustments, conver-

sion to a karsite might be a great way to allow a player to keep

up with his friends characters.

If humans arent prevalent in your campaign (or if including a

subrace of humans doesnt appeal to you), consider giving kar-

site abilities to half-elves or half-orcs, or even an elf or orc who

has a half-elf or half-orc (and thus a Karsus-blooded human) in

his family tree.

into  their  philosophy,  hoping  to  swell  their  numbers  and

advance their evil agenda (see Karsite Society, below).

Karsites speak Common.

COMBAT

A karsite advances into melee as quickly as possible. He pre-

fers to engage foes that lack magic weapons, but if attacked

with such an item, he focuses his attacks on that individual.

A karsite generally saves enemy spellcasters for last in a  ght,

relying on his spell resistance to fend off their spells and his

spell healing ability to keep him on his feet. He might try to

capture enemy spellcasters for later torture, but if a particu-

lar spellcaster regularly penetrates his spell resistance, he

changes tactics and attempts to defeat that enemy as quickly

as possible.

Magic-Draining Attacks (Su): A karsites melee attacks

can weaken a foes magic armor, weapon, or shield. If a crea-

ture struck in melee by a karsite fails a DC 12 Will save, one

of the combat-oriented magic items (armor, shield, or weapon)

in its possession is suppressed for 1 round. If a karsite knows

a particular weapon, armor, or shield in his foes possession is

magical, he can choose to drain that item, provided that he can

see it. Otherwise, the item is chosen randomly. Drained items

still detect as magical, but the magic appears suppressed. The

save DC is Charisma-based, and it includes the +2 bonus from

the Ability Focus (magic-draining attacks) feat.

Spell Healing (Su): Whenever a karsites spell resistance

prevents  a  spell  from  affecting  him,  he  heals  2  points  of

damage  per  spell  level.  Thus,  if  a  7th-level  spell  failed  to

penetrate a karsites spell resistance, he would heal 14 points

of damage.

Spellcasting Inability: A karsite cannot cast arcane or

divine  spells,  even  if  he  takes  levels  in  a  class  that  grants

spellcasting ability. He can use spell-like abilities, psionic

powers, and magic items normally.

KARSITE SOCIETY

Over  the  centuries,  karsites  have  discovered  one  another

and founded communities of their own kind. Many of these

communities exist within human society, and their members

pass off their unusual karsite appearance as a simple family

trait. The karsites of these regions hide their abilities, their

philosophy, and their agenda while doing their best to seem

like normal members of society.

Long  ago,  the  humans  of  a  forgotten  nation  persecuted

the karsites out of fear of their abilities. Countless karsites

were hunted down and executed during this period. Brought

together by this disaster, some karsites joined forces and  ed

the area. They found safety in numbers, as well as a strong

feeling of camaraderie based on their shared past.

In the process of investigating their history as a group,

these karsites discovered the legend of Karsus and the process

of binding vestiges. By summoning Karsus and consulting

with him, they discovered their purpose: to rid humanity

Karsite

of arcane spellcasters and establish the worship of Karsus

as the only god. Accomplishing this latter goal would make

the karsites the ruling caste of humanity because of their

divine bloodline.

Communities of karsites work toward this goal in many

ways, such as discrediting the good works of heroic spell-

casters, preventing the founding of temples and schools of

magic, stealing magic items and ruining their creators, and

taking leadership roles in human settlements. However, they

carry out all their work in secret. Despite their evil natures,

karsites  loathe  killing  other  humans,  primarily  because

doing so is robbing them of their future servants, who after

all dont know any better now. However, they do relish the

opportunity to harm spellcasters of any race.

KARSITES AS CHARACTERS

Most exceptional karsites are  ghters or binders. Some choose

to become monks, barbarians, or rogues, and a few discover

psionics and follow that path. Almost no karsite becomes

a ranger or paladin, however, and none are clerics, druids,

sorcerers, or wizards.

Karsite characters possess the following racial traits.

suppressed.  The  save  DC  is

Charisma-based.

Spell Healing (Su): Whenever

a  karsites  spell  resistance

prevents a spell from affect-

ing him, he heals 2 points of

damage per spell level. Thus,

if  a  7th-level  spell  failed  to

penetrate a karsites spell resis-

tance,  he  would  heal  14  points

of damage.

A  furious  thumping  soundas  if

someone was running, but more rapid

emanates from the darkness. Suddenly an odd creature rolls into

sight. Claws  ash as it cartwheels end over end on  ve furred legs.

It turns as it tumbles by, displaying two leonine faces, one snarling

on each side of its strange, star-shaped body.

Though they are simple-minded magical beasts, roving maul-

ers bear a disturbing resemblance to Buer, and they possess a

few of the abilities that the vestige grants to her summoners.

These  similarities  have  led  some  binders  to  theorize  that

either the creatures are her servants, or Buer had some con-

nection to them in life. The truth of their origins, however,

remains a mystery.

A roving mauler stands about 5 feet tall and weighs roughly

150 pounds. Its  ve legs resemble those of a lion. Its fur is

brown or tan-colored, with stripes that change color by season

and  territory.  Hunters  have  even  reported  green-striped

roving maulers living in forests.

Roving maulers live in prides like those of lions, and

the two creatures sometimes occupy the same territory.

Both typically hunt at night, but roving maulers tend to

favor larger prey. They do not hunt lions or any creatures

that have exceptional grappling abilities, and they have

even been known to give up their kills to such creatures

when challenged. Nearly any other prey, however, is

fair game. In particular, roving maulers have earned

a reputation for attacking caravans and campsites at

night. They usually kill only beasts of burden, attacking

humanoids only if they interfere. If a campsite has no

animals, however, the roving maulers roll out of the

darkness and rend the  esh of anyone unfortunate

enough to be in their path.

Roving maulers can track by scent, though poorly,

and  they  possess  keen  eyes  and  ears,  but  they  lack

stealth. In the daytime, they typically lounge in trees

or rocky prominences waiting for prey to wander near.

At night, they roam through the wilderness, hoping to

 nd a group of creatures bedding down for the night.

COMBAT

A  roving  mauler  rolls  into  combat  and  never  stops

moving. Although it can stand in place and  ght, it pre-

fers to tumble over its foes, raking with its claws as it goes.

If a  ght goes poorly, a roving mauler tumbles away to heal,

then returns to  nish the combat. Both of a roving maulers

faces possess sharp teeth, but it cant bring them to bear in

combat. Similarly, the orientation of its legs allows it only

one claw attack in melee or a grapple.

Tumbling Attack (Ex): A roving mauler can literally run

over opponentseven those larger than itself. As a full-round

action, it can move up to 40 feet, tumbling over any creatures

in its path. Any creature that occupies a space through which

a roving mauler tumbles is subject to a claw attack regardless

of its size.

If a roving mauler tumbles over part of an occupied space,

the  creature  within  it  can  make  an  attack  of  opportunity

against the mauler at a 4 penalty. A roving mauler can negate

the attack of opportunity if it succeeds on a DC 25 Tumble

check  to  move  through  the  creatures  space  and  reach.  A

failed check does not cause a roving mauler to stop, but it

does allow the target an attack of opportunity.

A roving mauler can attack each target only once per round,

no matter how many times its movement takes it through

that targets square.

All-Around Vision (Ex): A roving maulers two faces and

four eyes allow it to look in any direction, granting it a +4

racial bonus on Search and Spot checks. Opponents gain no

bene ts when  anking a roving mauler.

Skills: A roving mauler has a +4 racial bonus on Listen

checks, and its all-around vision grants it a +4 racial bonus on

Search and Spot checks. A roving mauler also has a +8 racial

bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on

a Climb check, even if rushed or threatened.

From  the  limbs  of  a  nearby  tree  comes  a  raucous  calling  sound.

Hundreds of ravensmaybe as many as a thousandroost among

the leaves and branches. Upon noticing a nearby creature, they all

become silent. Then one bird  aps up from its perch, and suddenly

they all  y upward en masse. The  ock gathers in a tight knot as it

spirals high into the sky, then it suddenly whirls back down, like

a black cloud of feathers with thousands of sharp claws and beaks

stretched toward its prey.

A  swarm  of  crows,  also  called  a  murder  of  crows  or  an

unkindness  of  ravens,  often  gathers  in  the  evenings  and

early morning hours on battle elds that are littered with

casualties. Hundreds of birds feast upon the dead and dying,

and when the battle begins again, they  y off to roost in

nearby trees as spectators of the blood sport. Some say the

crows learn to kill by watching war, but regardless of how

it happens, these large  ocks sometimes act communally

to attack other creatures and create the carnage on which

they long to feed.

Crows have always gathered in great  ocks, but the  rst

records  of  such   ocks  attacking  creatures  appear  after

Malphass death and transformation into a vestige. Binder

scholars note that it was not until this time that such  ocks

were called unkindnesses.

Once gathered into a murder, crow swarms remain together

until dispersed by damage or the strong winds of a storm.

These swarms can plague communities by ravaging crops

and wounding or killing people.

Telling a murder of crows from a simple gathering of many

black birds can be dif cult. Individually, the birds appear

the same, but when a murder of crows  ies, the birds brush

up against each another, sometimes even crawling over one

another  in  the  air.  The  sight  is  ghastly,  and  the  noise  the

swarm makes is both piercing and thunderous.

OTHER BIRD SWARMS

You can use crow swarm statistics for any swarm of similarly

sized birds. If you want to represent a swarm of smaller birds,

such as a pitying of doves, substitute the following statistics

in  place  of  the  corresponding  lines  in  the  statistics  block

above.

Diminutive Animal (Swarm)

Armor Class: 16 (+4 size, +2 Dex), touch 16, flat-footed 12

Special  Qualities:  Immune  to  weapon  damage,  low-light

vision, swarm traits

COMBAT

Like all swarms, a murder of crows attacks by moving over foes

and dealing swarm damage. For information on the swarm sub-

type and important rules about it, see page 315 of the Monster

Manual. Unlike many swarms, a crow swarm is hindered in

its attacks by its  ying maneuverability. A  ying crow swarm

must move at least 20 feet each round, it can turn 45 degrees

only after moving 5 feet or sacri cing 5 feet of movement, and

it cannot turn more than 90 degrees in one place. Abiding by

these rules allows a murder of crows to  y in a small circle,

always keeping one square of its space covering a single 5-foot

square. The swarm can land and move on the ground, but at a

much slower speed. See Tactical Aerial Movement on page 20

of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more details.

A murder of crows can be summoned in place of a bat, rat,

or spider swarm using the summon swarm spell.

Blinding (Ex): A creature damaged by a crow swarm must

succeed on a DC 14 Re ex save or be blinded. The creature can

regain its sight by healing the damage naturally, by any applica-

tion of a cure spell or some other healing magic, or with a remove

blindness/deafness spell. The save DC is  Dexterity-based.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn

with  a  crow  swarm  in  its  space  must  succeed  on  a  DC 12

Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is

Constitution-based.

An ursine creature the size of a polar bear lumbers into view. Instead

of fur, thousands of sharp teeth of various types and sizes stud its

hide. Teeth of every kind cover its entire body, including its head,

which has teeth for eyes. The raw  esh between the teeth is pink

and has the moistness of gums. Despite its apparent blindness, the

creature seems to sense the presence of prey, turning suddenly toward

a creature that has passed and emitting a terrifying moan.

Tooth beasts roam the Underdark, making their homes in

cool caverns that provide easy access to water. Occasionally,

they travel nearer to the surface, living in caves and venturing

out when prey wanders near, or when the weather duplicates

the conditions of their favored environment.

Tooth beasts use their keen sense of hearing

to  hunt.  They  listen  for  distant  prey  and

move slowly toward the sounds, hoping

to  get  close  enough  to  frighten  the

creatures.  The  noise  of  a  combat

often  draws  tooth  beasts,

and many Underdark

denizens simply leave

their dead and dying

on  the   eld  of  battle

when  a  tooth  beast

shows up to avoid facing

the creature themselves.

None  who  know  of

Dahlver-Nar  can  dispute

the tooth beasts resemblance

to  him,  but  the  cause  of  that

similarity  remains  disputed.

Some think tooth beasts are

degenerate  descendants  of

Dahlver-Nar; others believe they

are  binders  who  bound  them-

selves  too  often  to  that  vestige.

Those who believe in the legendary

teeth of Dahlver-Nar theorize that tooth

beasts exist because binders lost them-

selves to the power of those items, just as Dahlver-Nar did.

A tooth beast weighs about 2,000 pounds and stands nearly

10 feet tall on its hind legs.

COMBAT

A tooth beast moves as swiftly as possible to place foes within

range of its frightful moan. It then uses that ability to divide

and conquer, charging any foes who remain nearby before

pursuing those that have  ed. When it encounters foes that

remain out of range, the tooth beast usually  ees, hoping to

either escape the encounter altogether or lure its enemies

into  ghting in closer quarters.

Frightful Moan (Su): As a standard action, a tooth beast

can  emit  a  frightful  moan.  Every  creature  within  30  feet

that hears it howl must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be

frightened for 1 round and shaken for 1 round thereafter.

All  tooth  beasts  have  immunity  to  this  attack.  Frightful

moan is a sonic mind-affecting fear ability, and the save DC

is Charisma-based.

Pounce (Ex): If a tooth beast charges a foe, it can make a

full attack, including two rake attacks.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +14 melee, damage 1d8+4. A tooth

beast makes rake attacks by rubbing its bodyand the many

sharp teeth that cover itagainst a foe.

Blind  (Ex):  A  tooth  beasts  blindness  gives  it

immunity to gaze attacks, visual effects and

illusions, and other attack forms that rely

on sight.

Blindsight (Ex): A tooth beast

has  blindsight  out  to  120  feet.

Beyond  that  range,  it  treats

all  targets  as  having  total

concealment.

Sprint  after  Fear

(Ex): A tooth beast can

sense fear in creatures

within  range  of  its

blindsight,  and  it  can

move  at  a  speed  of  60

feet  (or  charge  at  120

feet)  to  end  its  move-

ment next to a creature

affected  by  any  sort

of  fear  condition.

PACT MAGIC

ORGANIZATIONS

This section details two of the most important organizations

that focus on pact magic.

THE ORDER OF SEROPAENES

They are a threat to the Truth. To falter in our task spells certain

doom for all.

Sir Michael Ambrose, Seropaenean leader

The Order of Seropaenes is an alliance of various religious

groups sworn to destroy pact magic and conceal its existence.

Although the speci c faiths are often at odds about other

issues, their members are willing to work together in order

to negate the greater threat posed by binders.

JOINING THE ORDER OF

SEROPAENES

Characters with some divine connection are the most likely

candidates for the order. Clerics, paladins, favored souls (see

Complete Divine), and even blackguards often seek member-

ship. However, the leaders of the order are so dedicated to their

mission that they accept candidates from nearly any class. Over

the years, the order has used witch slayers, rogues, assassins,

rangers, and even barbarians to combat the binders.

Entry Requirements

Skills or Spellcasting: Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks or the

ability to cast 1st-level divine spells

The order makes extensive use of its darker elements to locate

suspected binders, using rogues for espionage, wizards for

divination, and blackguards to learn what they can from the

darker agencies. Based on the information gained from these

sources,  paladins,   ghters,  and  favored  souls  go  to  binder

hideouts to capture or kill their enemies. The order sends

only its good members on such missions because they are

more likely to capture their foes alive and bring them back

to the stronghold for questioning than evil members are. The

higher-ranking  members  of  the  order  consider  interroga-

tion an invaluable tool for learning where to  nd other pact

magic practitioners and to what other areas the cancerous

knowledge might have spread.

SEROPAENEAN BENEFITS

The Order of Seropaenes is a well-funded and powerful secret

society. Members receive equipment and can acquire different

types of services at discounted rates.

The order offers a bounty for each heretic captured. A live

binder earns you a bonus equal to his binder level  100 gp.

A dead one earns a bonus equal to his binder level  25 gp.

In addition, the Seropaeneans loan equipment to members

undertaking speci c missions for the order. You can borrow

permanent magic items whose value equals your character

level  200 gp.

Since the Order of Seropaenes consists largely of religious

groups, its members have no shortage of divine magic. Mem-

bers receive cure spells, remove curse, remove disease, and remove

poison at no cost. The order also provides powerful magic, such

as raise dead, resurrection, and the like, for 75% of the normal

price. Finally, you can purchase curative potions and wands

at 50% the list price.

PLAYING A SEROPAENEAN

A  fundamental  order  guides  the  universe,  and  pact  magic

perverts that order. By exploiting spirits that the gods have

banished, binders endanger the delicate balance between gods

and men, and reveal secrets that should remain unknown to

mortal minds. No matter how they present their activities, the

fact is that binders dabble with damned spirits, allowing these

abominations to possess them and adding to their power with

each binding. If not stopped, these wretched spirits could one

day supplant the gods themselves.

You were once one of the blind, unseeing and unable to

comprehend the larger framework of the planes. Then the

Seropaeneans removed your blindfold, and you left your old

life behind to  ght the good  ght. Whats one life against

the bene t of all? How can a mortal life measure against the

sanctity of the divine? Your task is to eliminate the heretics

known as binders before they erode the relationship between

mortal and immortal any further.

To  be  effective  as  a  Seropaenean,  you  must  gain  some

fundamental  knowledge  about  your  enemy.  Thus,  for  the

 rst year or so after joining the order, you learn everything

you can about binders and the fundamentals of pact magic.

In particular, you study the nature of the vestiges, the gifts

they confer, and the techniques for summoning and bind-

ing them.

COMBAT

Binders  are  unpredictable,  so  make  sure  you  have  a  good

mixture of offensive and defensive abilities when facing off

against them. Purchase or borrow magic items to minimize

your weaknesses. In particular, items that increase your save

modi ers are good tools for your missions.

Anticipating what kinds of spirits a given group of bind-

ers draws power from can be dif cult. So in smaller-scale

combats, be sure you have a good mix of allies, especially

spellcasters. If you dont have access to divine magic of your

own, pair up with a divine spellcaster who can keep you on

your feet.

In large con icts, a broad selection of allies is best. Form

units that include a paladin, a rogue, a cleric, and a wizard or

sorcerer. This mix of abilities helps you compensate for the

binders unusual assortment of powers.

90

ADVANCEMENT

The mission requires your absolute loyalty. You might regu-

larly  face  situations  that  challenge  your  morality,  forcing

you to make dif cult decisions between mercy and justice,

or between the end and the means. But the order chose you

for your ability to follow orderseven dif cult ones.

Once  you  are  found  worthy  of  membership,  the  order

assigns  a  mentor  to  you.  This  instructor  teaches  you  all

about pact magic, its history, the crimes committed by its

practitioners, and the threat they pose to the doctrines of

the represented faiths. Depending on who you were prior

to membership, you might gain advanced training at this

stage  as  well.  Assassins  and  rogues  develop  skills  with

espionage and poison, while paladins learn how to marry

their code to the sometimes questionable tactics employed

by the order.

After your training, be prepared for a hard road ahead.

Fighting binders is not easy. These insidious tricksters are

willing to sell their souls and commit nearly any crime in

pursuit of power. Thus, facing them exposes you to dangers

far greater than you might expect. The end always justi es

the means for a Seropaenean, because the end is so impor-

tant. Thus, if a Seropaenean assassin murders a binder you

found  to  be  virtuous  and  noble,  you  must  accept  the  act

because ultimately, it preserves the authority of not just your

own deity, but all the divine powers.

MISSIONS

As a Seropaenean, your general mission is to hunt out and

destroy cells of binders wherever you  nd them. If youre

evil, you gather information, in ltrate binder enclaves, and

destroy them from within. If your personal morals incline

toward good, you use the information that your evil fellows

have learned to take the  ght directly to the enemy. When

you emerge victorious, you return the captured binders to the

Tower of Woethe heart of the orderfor interrogation.

SEROPAENEAN TEAMS

When members of the Order of Seropaenes travel together,

they do so in groups where each individual complements the

others.  Encounters  with  groups  of  Seropaeneans  at  various

ELs are outlined below. All of the characters are human.

EL 3: A trio of watchers includes a 1st-level rogue, a 1st-level

diviner, and a 1st-level ranger.

EL 5: This team of inquisitors consists of a 3rd-level cleric,

two 1st-level rogues, and a 1st-level paladin.

EL 10: A strike team of Seropaeneans includes a 5th-level

cleric, a 5th-level ranger, a 5th-level rogue/2nd-level assassin,

and a 5th-level wizard.

EL 15: This high-powered group, known as purgers, boasts

a 10th-level cleric, a 10th-level evoker, four 5th-level ranger/

2nd-level  witch  slayers,  and  four  5th-level  rogue/2nd-level

assassins.

SEROPAENEANS IN THE WORLD

How can they claim to  ght for Heironeous when they would ally

with his enemies?

Dekelor, Shining Blade of Heironeous

The Order of Seropaenes presents an interesting way to unite

disparate religious groups under one common banner. In the

same manner, the order can help to unite an unusual mix of

player characters with wildly varying alignments. Alterna-

tively, the Seropaeneans make excellent recurring villains to

set against binder PCs and their companions. Because they

can appear when least expected, they can help to propel the

campaign forward when the action has stalled.

ORGANIZATION

The  very  existence  of  the  Order  de es  logic.  It  unites

adherents of many opposing religions, who agree to work

together for one reason only: to oppose, contain, and destroy

pact magic.

Ages ago, a scholar and archeologist named Syfal uncov-

ered a large cache of writings. He found a treatise on the

existence of a pantheon that simply could not exist, and a

theory on how to bind and control the rogue spirits that were

its members. The problem was not the binding, but the fact

that these essences somehow existed independently of the

divine order. They were beings of great power that existed

somewhere between the gods and their servants, but were

beholden to neither.

When Syfal began to spread the news of these vestiges, as

he called them, word of his teachings eventually reached the

larger churches. Knowing that the gods hold power primarily

through mortal belief, the church leaders feared that Syfals

spirits would decrease the power of the deities by drawing

mortals away from the established religions. Their fears were

not unfounded, since the mortals who regularly contacted

these vestiges gave them attention bordering on worshipin

fact, many did worship the spirits. If the churches allowed the

binders to persist, the vestiges might rival or even displace

the gods.

While religious organizations scrambled to contain the

damage, a priest of Vecna named Seropaenes called a meeting

of the elders from the established churches at a remote site in

the Crystalmist Mountains. Attendance was sparse, with only

clergy from the churches of Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, and

Wee Jas in attendance. Seropaenes began by describing the

implications and dangers of pact magic to his fellow clergy.

He then proposed that the churches unite under a common

bannerone  that  would  not  compromise  the  strictures

of  their  faiths  and  would  guarantee  the  integrity  of  their

respective dogmas. Desperate to avert the threat posed by pact

magic, the high priests from each church agreed, forming

the Order of Seropaenes.

At  rst, the order operated secretly, with members devoted

to certain gods kept isolated from those devoted to oppos-

ing deities. Still, it was highly effective. Its members swept

THE ORDER OF SEROPAENES LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can research

the Order of Seropaenes to learn more about it. When a char-

acter makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: In the past, opposing religions have occasionally

overlooked their differences and united to end an even greater

threat.

DC 15: The Order of Seropaenes was founded to destroy

practitioners of a rare form of magic.

DC  20:  Anyone,  anywhere

can be a Seropaenean. Good

or  evil,  commoner  or  pala-

dinthey  exist  at  every

level of society.

DC  25:  The  founder  of  the

Seropaeneans  was  a  powerful  and

charismatic cleric of Vecna.

Many  of  the  more  schol-

arly bards also know the early

exploits of the Seropaeneans. Thus,

a bardic knowledge check reveals

the  same  information,  and  the

DCs given above are each reduced

by 5.

THE TOWER OF WOE

The Tower of Woe, the nerve center of the

Order of Seropaenes, stands on the very site

where  the  original  church  representatives

met  and  founded  the  organization.  Tall,

impressive carvings and bas-reliefs depicting

the holy symbols and religious icons of Heironeous, Wee Jas,

St. Cuthbert, and Vecna decorate the exterior of the structure.

The tower has no visible entrances except for a narrow band

of open space near the top.

As its  rst act, the  edgling order constructed this tower

to serve as a neutral ground where the servants of the vari-

ous gods could meet to pursue their joint mission in peace

and unity. The tower functioned as a jail for heretics and a

holding area for their tools. In addition, it served as a home

for the leaders of the order, who discovered that they could

guide  the  operations  of  the  organization  and  monitor  the

 ow of information more ef ciently in person.

Although it has stood for many years, the Tower of Woe

remains unchanged from its earliest days. Today, however, the

lower frequency of visitors makes the place seem abandoned.

A sinister air hangs about it, suggesting blind commitment to

a cause that is  awed and perhaps even evil, despite protests

to the contrary from its adherents.

through the lands, retrieving forbidden grimoires, imprison-

ing binders, and crushing the heretical uprising. Word spread,

and  soon  other  members  of  the  parent  churches  realized

what was happening. Although they agreed that the threat

presented  by  binders  was  indeed  great,  the  alliance  with

agents who served the gods of their enemies caused a great

upheaval. How could paladins of Heironeous band together

with  Vecnas  necromancers?  Was  the  threat  so  great  that

good and evil had to unite against it? Publicly, the member

religions banned the Order of Seropaenes, but some secretly

funded it, thus continuing the crusade.

The order veiled itself in a cloak of secrecy, and over the

years, most of the churches forgot about it. Records of its

existence were quietly cleansed from the annals

and sacred texts of all faiths. So complete was

the destruction of the evidence that not

even the highest-ranking members of

the Church of Heironeous now know

about  the  order  and  its  mission.

Rumor  holds  that  the  Seropae-

neans  now  receive  funds  not

from their constituent religions,

but  from  some  other,  larger

organization.  In  fact,  some

paranoid  binders  believe  that

the Regulators (see page 244 of

Epic Level Handbook), a myste-

rious  and  super-powerful

organization that regulates

power in all forms, pulls the

strings of the order.

Symbol of the

Order of Seropaenes

NPC REACTIONS

Members of the order enjoy whatever reputation their vari-

ous religious leanings provoke. Thus, paladin members are

usually viewed favorably, and good clerics and other NPCs

are generally friendly if not helpful to them. Clerics or black-

guards in service to Vecna receive the same unfriendly stares

and comments from locals that they would if they were not

members. In short, membership in a secret coalition neither

aids nor hinders the Seropaeneans.

Few  clerics  and  members  of  the  orders  constituent

churches actually understand the signi cance of the order.

Such a character must succeed on a DC 25 Knowledge (reli-

gion) check to identify a Seropaenean for what he is. NPCs

who recognize a member of the order as such are nearly always

unfriendly.

SEROPAENEANS IN THE GAME

Members of the Order of Seropaenes conceal their actions.

For the most part, they bide their time, watching for binder

activity. As a secret society operating on the fringes of civi-

lization, the order might have existed all along in a given

campaign  world  without  ever  coming  to  the  attention  of

the PCs.

Membership in the order provides players with a chance

to  develop  their  purposes  and  roles  within  the  campaign

world. The order is a perfect venue for those who enjoy moral

ambiguity, shady plotlines, and intrigues.

When  designing  a  campaign  featuring  the  Seropaene-

ans, make sure you present binders as a major and ongoing

nemesis, so that PC members have a good reason to remain

af liated with the organization. Tailor your adventures to

highlight the PCs strengths, focusing on research and inves-

tigation. Missions for the order could easily take characters

all over the world to peruse ancient volumes that describe

the nature of pact magic. With each discovery, characters

should feel the temptation to try pact magic themselvesa

desire that might put them at odds with their benefactors.

ADAPTATION

The Order of Seropaenes opposes pact magic and the threat

it represents to organized faiths. You can, however, pit this

organization against other spellcasters instead, such as psions,

wilders, necromancers, shadowcasters, or even truenamers.

In fact, you can easily broaden the focus of the organization

to encompass anyone who does not practice divine magic,

thus  creating  an  interesting  tension  between  arcane  and

divine spellcasters.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS

Any PC binder should encounter the Seropaeneans at some

point. Even just brushing against them should create tension

within an adventuring party, since the binders allies must

come to terms with opposing agents of good and noble gods

such as Heironeous and even St. Cuthbert.

The  leaders  of  the  Order  of  Seropaenes  understand  the

ethical tensions among the various members, so they orga-

nize their soldiers by religion. Regardless of their individual

outlooks,  all  Seropaeneans  remain  committed  to  purging

pact magic from the world.

EL 16:  Leaving  his  career  as  a  mercenary  witch  slayer,

Michael Ambrose joined the Seropaeneans as their garrison

commander at the Tower of Woe. He embodies the principles

espoused by the order and truly believes that the heretical

practices of pact magic present a real risk to the world and

to divine authority.

THEURGIAN SOCIETY

. . . and one day, I found the Truth.

Tamsin Cutterbuck, gnome binder

vestiges. Thus, if you use Theurgian facilities in your research,

you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Gather Information,

Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), and Knowledge

(the planes) checks.

Formerly scholars and philosophers, the Theurgians are bind-

ers who contact vestiges to attain a deeper understanding of

reality.  According  to  their  detractors,  such  information  is

not meant to be known, so the Theurgians are considered

the most heretical binder group of all.

JOINING THE THEURGIANS

Theurgians  are  binders,  but  many  had  careers  as  clerics,

bards,  or  wizards  before  discovering  the  power  of  pact

magic.  Faced  with  extinction  due  to  the  depreda-

tions  of  those  who  oppose  pact  magic,  they

have begun to accept some nonbinders

into  their  ranks  for  protection.  Only

those who share their commitment to

knowledge, however, are considered

for membership.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (arcana)

6 ranks, Knowledge (history)

3 ranks, Knowledge (religion)

6 ranks

Binders form the inner circle of this

organization. Rogues and bards serve

as  its  eyes  and  ears,  helping  their

compatriots escape from witch slayers,

scouting old ruins, and recovering lost

knowledge. Fighters and knights of the

sacred seal act as guards and bodyguards

for their fellows.

Theurgians undergo an intense period

of study to learn the lore of pact magic. Since few ancient

tomes were written in languages that are still in use, many

Theurgians purchase ranks in Decipher Script or learn dead

languages  to  better  understand  the  central  tenets  of  pact

magic.

Symbol of the

Theurgian Society

PLAYING A THEURGIAN

Youve been branded a heretic, a heathen, and a disrupter of

the balance, but those labels were applied by the ignorant.

Your enemies fear what they cannot understand and destroy

that  which  you  pursue  to  preserve  their  close-minded

ways.

Its  not  that  you  dont  believe  in  the  gods;  you  simply

dont believe in their servants. Clerics, paladins, and their

ilk obfuscate the Truth and hide behind their own narrow

interpretations of the relationship between mortal

and  immortal.  Through  callous  perse-

cution,  they  force  you  to  take  drastic

measures to protect yourself and those

dear to you.

COMBAT

Your knowledge of your foes deter-

mines  your  tactics  in  battle.  You

have access to all the resources you

need  to  research  your  enemies  and

gather  information  about  them,  so

you should never go into battle without

knowing  what  kind  of  opposition  you

face.  Use  your  knowledge  of  your  foes

weaknesses to best effect by employing

attacks that might be especially damaging

or hindering, and trick them by present-

ing false opportunities that use up their

most valuable resources.

ADVANCEMENT

Information on pact magic is forbidden in most lands because

it presents too great a threat to the doctrines of the various

churches. Perhaps you stumbled onto a forbidden manuscript

during an adventure and uncovered the essential nature of

pact magic, then discovered that practitioners of pact magic

have many enemies. Witch slayers converged on you, tracking

you down wherever you went until it seemed that all hope

was lost. Then the Theurgians plucked you up and brought

you into their fold.

Once you became involved with the Theurgians, you could

not return to normal life. You soon realized that you would

always be on the outside because the world stands against

you and all you work for. So you study under the masters of

the  craft,  poring  over  the  ancient  tomes  and  manuscripts

of other heretics who have since been condemned to spend

their last days languishing in the Tower of Woe. But although

some would curse the insatiable curiosity that brought them

to this lifestyle, you embrace it, ravenously consuming the

writings presented by your mentor.

THEURGIAN BENEFITS

The Theurgian Society offers its members access to its library

of information and shelters them from enemies. In addition,

the Theurgians have built a large network of sympathizers.

Thus,  membership  provides  connections  to  hirelings  the

world over and enables you to procure hireling services at half

the normal price (see Hirelings on page 105 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide for details).

In addition, the Theurgians know forbidden information

of all kinds. As a member of the society, you gain access to

esoteric bits of information, language translation services,

rare manuscripts, and pertinent information about all the

MISSIONS

NPC REACTIONS

As a Theurgian, you are sworn to protect the books you

and your fellows have collected through the generations, to

defend apprentices, to rescue fellow members pursued by

witch slayers, and to hide binders from the Seropaeneans.

The leaders of the organization might send you to in ltrate

the Tower of Woe and rescue a powerful binder, or ask you

to stay behind and stall the enemy long enough for the rest

of the enclave to escape.

Like nonaf liated binders, Theurgians are not widely known.

The  attitude  of  any  NPC  who  learns  what  Theurgians  do

immediately  shifts  to  unfriendly  or  worse.  The  Order  of

Seropaenes has agents everywhereprimarily common and

unassuming folk whose sole duty is to watch for suspicious

types bearing the equipment used by binders and showing

the odd physical signs of a vestiges presence. These spies not

only report to their contacts but also spread rumors that turn

the locals against binders.

THEURGIANS IN THE WORLD

Heretical fools! For all their vaunted knowledge, they know not

what they do! Their reckless explorations force us to expunge their

taint.

Sir Michael Ambrose, Seropaenean Inquisitor

The  dedicated  intellectuals  who  belong  to  the  Theurgian

Society favor sacri cing all else to the pursuit of Truth. In

your campaign, the Theurgians might be social elites who

gather in secret to explore the possibilities offered by pact

magic,  or  they  might  be  members  of  a  group  on  the  run,

constantly moving from place to place and communicating

by means of secret runes and other symbols left inconspicu-

ously for those who follow.

ORGANIZATION

The  Theurgian  Society  lacks  the  rigid  structure  of  other

organizations. A strong commitment to pact magic and a fear

of persecution are the only factors that unite its members

as a body. In fact, the Theurgians loose assembly and lack

of structure is perhaps what allows them to continue in the

face of their opposition.

The Theurgian Society developed out of the teachings of

Syfal, an enigmatic mystic and scholar. Sometime in the mists

of  antiquity,  Syfal  uncovered  the  location  of  a  mysterious

sanctuary  occupied  by  a  fringe  group  of  theologians.  The

frescos and murals he found there depicted an unusual cer-

emony involving symbols and invocations. His explorations

culminated in a singularly important event: He uncovered a

hidden vault containing hundreds upon hundreds of manu-

scriptsa treasure trove of ancient lore.

In subsequent years, Syfal spread the word about the new

kind of spirit he had discovered. In the process, he realized

that many other scholars had hypothesized the existence of

lost spirits, and some had even gone so far as to name them.

Until Syfals discovery, however, no one knew how to contact

them.

Syfals teachings rippled through the world, creating excite-

ment  in  scholarly  communities  everywhere.  In  response,

several in uential churches banded together to scour Syfal

and his followers from the land. These early movements were

a dark period in the history of Heironeous and St. Cuthbert,

but the followers of those gods managed to purge Syfal and

the art of pact magic from the worldat least for a time.

THEURGIAN SOCIETY LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can research

the Theurgian Society to learn more about it. When a char-

acter makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: A certain group of scholars attains knowledge by

binding spirits.

DC  15:  The  Theurgians,  if  they  still  exist,  are  almost

exclusively binders who follow the teachings of an ancient

sage named Syfal.

DC 20: The Theurgians are concerned with knowledge,

not power. Their persecution is unjust.

DC 30: Characters who achieve this level of success can

learn important details about the speci c Theurgians in your

campaign, including notable members, the areas where they

operate, and the kinds of activities they undertake.

A PC who wishes to contact the Theurgians should make a

DC 20 Gather Information check to  nd local sympathizers

and allies. If the contact is an assassin, blackguard, cleric, or

paladin, the DC increases to 30.

THE HIDDEN LIBRARY

For generations, archeologists and explorers alike overlooked

this ruin. Exploration of it uncovered little of interest, thanks

to the wisdom of Syfal, founder of the Theurgian Society, and

the skill of his supporters.

When the scholar  rst discovered the library, he realized

the  risk  he  would  face  if  he  ever  exposed  it  to  the  world.

While pressure from the Seropaeneans mounted, Syfal moved

hundreds of texts to this site, while his supporters hastily

constructed a vault to hold them. Although a cleric of Vecna

murdered Syfal before the library was completed, his allies

managed to  nish the project without his guidance, creating

a labyrinth of corridors and passages designed to confuse and

confound intruders.

In time, Syfals followers died out, taking the secrets of this

place to their graves. Eventually, however, another group of

scholars and archeologists came across the ruin. Intrigued

by its unusual mosaics and frescoes, they stayed for months,

carefully searching for clues. Finally their persistence paid

off, and they located the hidden entrance to the library. Thus

was the Theurgian movement resurrected.

95

Tamsin Cutterbuck, the expeditions leader (see Encounters,

below), now oversees the site and its continued excavation.

She has made incredible progress in learning the essential

symbols of the spirits and has bound several of them so far.

The Order of Seropaenes has not yet uncovered this site, or

even noted the sudden resurgence of interest in pact magic,

but it is only a matter of time until it does.

THEURGIANS IN THE GAME

The  Theurgians  might  already  exist  in  your  campaign,

whether you use the Seropaeneans or not. If your characters

are searching for a bit of lost lore, a loremaster might refer

them  to  local  Theurgian.  This  method  of  introduction  is

especially useful at low levels, before the PCs have access to

spells such as contact other plane and divination.

Characters  using  pact  magic  might  also  encounter  the

Theurgian  Society.  Those  pursuing  knowledge  of  ves-

tiges  might  stumble  across  the  group  at  some  point  in

their careers, making the Theurgians a useful vehicle for

propelling  the  campaign  forwardespecially  when  the

Seropaeneans close in.

ADAPTATION

The Theurgians lack of a rigid hierarchy combined with the

fact that the Seropaeneans destroyed much of their history

makes adaptation relatively easy. The biggest dif culty is set-

ting up their opponents. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign

Setting, for example, you could pit the Theurgians against the

Harpers, or maybe even against the clerics of Azuth, Mystra,

and Shar. In the EBERRON Campaign Setting, the Theurgians

might have uncovered a cache of ancient pact magic tomes in

Xendrik, causing wizards to hunt them across Khorvaire.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

The best encounters with Theurgians involve a great deal

of  mystery.  The  PCs  might  never  directly  encounter  the

group,  but  intermediaries  loyal  to  the  organization  might

protect them from those who would do them harm. Ulti-

mately,  involvement  with  the  Theurgians  is  sure  to  make

the characters lives more exciting. As word spreads about

their connections to this group, the characters might have

to explain themselves to witch slayers, Seropaeneans, and

religious authorities.

EL 10: Though Tamsin is committed to the expansion of

pact magic, she fears the Seropaeneans, who killed her lover

to get to her. After  nding the site, she sent the other binders

away while she remained behind to study the lore inside.

PACT MAGIC

ADVENTURE SITES

The following adventure sites focus on pact magic. Each loca-

tion is fully detailed, but no speci c adventure hooks or plots

are included. Thus, you can adapt them to use as you see  t.

THE HIDDEN LIBRARY

On  a  peak  in  a  great  mountain  chain  stands  an  old  ruin.

Although archeologists and explorers have combed the site

many times for clues to its purpose (or out of simple greed),

few  realized  that  the  temple  was  only  a  diversion  built  to

conceal what lay beyond. With each failed expedition, word

spread that the place was only an empty ruin, discouraging

others from exploring it. But some know better. The binders

built this place, and to them, it is sacred.

Behind the ruin is a narrow tunnel that extends about 1

mile into the mountain, ending at an octagonal vertical shaft

housing a set of stairs that ascend nearly 500 feet. On the

walls of the shaft are strange glyphs, seals, and other sigils

dedicating the place to the vestiges. The stairs end at a great

adamantine door  tted with a massive seal. Beyond it lies the

Hidden Library.

The library is a strange place. It consists of more than  fty

rooms, each of which is  lled with racks holding scrolls, piles

of dusty books, grimoires, and more. Since each room has

only one entrance and one exit, navigating the library should

be simple. However, the Theurgians went to great lengths

to protect this site, placing crypt things here and there to

scatter intruders in an effort to frustrate their enemies and

deter exploration.

Although the crypt things remain  rmly under the control

of the Theurgians, few binders remain here, since the library

lacks the amenities for an extended stay. Furthermore, most

binders avoid the Hidden Library in an effort to prevent witch

slayers  or  Seropaeneans  from  uncovering  and  destroying

the  place.  Defended  by  its  caretaker  and  a  few  guardians,

this place holds many secrets for those willing to brave the

dangers.

1. THE STAIR (EL 8)

This  huge  spiral  staircase  leads  up  the  shaft  through  the

mountainside. The stairs hug the walls of the shaft, leaving

an  open  space  in  the  center.  Thus,  a  single  misstep  could

send an intruder falling to an abrupt death far below. The

stair  treads  are  10  feet  wide,  but  each  is  set  at  a  different

height from the last, so concentration and care is required to

climb them. Murals and symbols keyed to different vestiges

decorate the dark stone of the walls. Occasionally, veins of

silver, mithral, and other metals cross through these sigils.

At the top of the stairs is a great adamantine door bearing

the seal of Otiax scribed in the blue-white  re of continual

 ame spells. The door is not locked.

Creature:  Tamsin  Cutterbuck  (see  Sample  Encounter,

page 96), the current leader of the Theurgians, befriended an

ogre mage named Thurgesh in her planar travels. After she

saved the ogre mages life from a group of eladrins in Sigil,

the City of Doors (see page 141 of Planar Handbook), he vowed

to serve her for ten years. During his service, Thurgesh grew

interested  in  the  librarys  secrets  and  the  practice  of  pact

magic. Although his service to Tamsin ended years ago, he

remains with her still, guarding the sacred Hidden Library

and his friends life.

Thurgesh, Ogre Mage: hp 37; MM 200.

Tactics: Thurgesh patrols the entryway by  ying along the

staircase invisibly. If a group of nonbinders begins to ascend,

he urges them to turn back and forget the place, warning that

no good can come from exploring it. If they persist, he attacks.

Any binder who is with the group can convince Thurgesh

to let the PCs pass by improving his indifferent attitude to

friendly.

Development: If the PCs do not kill Thurgesh, he lingers

invisibly near the top of the stair, listening for any sounds of

combat that might indicate that Tamsin is in trouble.

2. GUARDPOST (EL 5)

This chamber is empty except for its guardian.

Creature: An advanced crypt thing lurks in this room.

Scatter Defilers (Su) Once per day, an advanced crypt thing

can target its enemies with a teleportation effect,

causing each to be transported 10d1010 feet in a

random direction. Targets that fail their saves arrive

safely in the closest open space to the destination

(including shifting up or down if necessary) if a solid

body occupies that location. This ability affects twelve

enemies, and all targets must be within a 30-foot burst

centered on the crypt thing. The transported targets

cannot take any actions until their next turn. The save

DC is Wisdom-based and includes the +2 bonus from

Ability Focus.

Tactics: Charged with preventing intruders from entering

the library, the advanced crypt thing urges visitors to turn

back whence they came. If a binder successfully improves

the crypt things attitude from unfriendly to friendly, the

creature allows them to pass. Otherwise it uses its scatter

de lers ability against the intruders.

3. VAULTS

Each of these locations is the same except for minor varia-

tions on the shapes and sizes of the rooms. Scrolls, books,

grimoires, manuscripts, and more are piled on racks, shelves,

and tables. A thick layer of dust covers all.

Treasure: Each room contains 4d% scrolls and 2d% books.

None of these texts are magical. They cover a range of topics

ranging  from  gardening  to  planar  theory.  The  scrolls  are

worth 1d10 gp each and the books 1d4+110 gp each, but

these works are merely decoys for the real treasure in area

6.  Characters  might  be  tempted  to  cart  off  the  books  and

scrolls, but doing so requires a great deal of effort and prob-

ably several trips. Such a prolonged expedition would surely

garner the attention of a local band of witch slayers.

4. WINDOWED ROOM

Unlike any other location in the hidden library, this room

contains two small windows overlooking the octagonal shaft.

The books and scrolls in here are scattered. This chamber

serves to help orient lost explorers.

5. GUARDIAN (EL 10)

Years  ago,  Tamsins  lover,  a  powerful  wizard  named  Saul,

created  a  special  servant  for  her.  He  invested  years  in  its

construction,  carefully  inscribing  the  necessary  spells  to

keep his beloved safe. Saul stayed with Tamsin for many years,

but when a coterie of witch slayers caught up with the pair,

he sacri ced himself so that Tamsin could escape. Now she

cannot bear to look at the gift he made for her, so she keeps

it in another room.

Creature: This chamber is home to Tamsins runic guard-

ian, a massive human-shaped  gure crafted from stone, steel,

and lead. When the PCs enter, it watches them closely but

takes no action against them unless  rst attacked. For more

Stunning Strike (Ex) A creature struck by a runic

guardians slam attack must succeed on a DC 25

Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.

Find Master (Su) The runic guardian can always find the

piece of jewelry connecting it to Tamsin.

Guard (Ex) When the runic guardian is within 5 feet of

Tamsin, she gains a +4 deflection bonus to her AC.

Shield Master (Sp) Tamsin can activate this ability as a

standard action so long as she is within 150 feet of the

runic guardian. Once activated, the guardian takes

three-fourths of the damage that would otherwise be

dealt to Tamsin. This ability otherwise functions like the

shield other spell, except that it provides no AC or saving

throw bonuses.

This room contains the same assortment of texts as most of

the other chambers in the tower.

Development: Any sounds of combat here bring Tamsin

from area 6.

6. END OF LINE (EL 10)

Tamsin keeps the collected lore about pact magic at the end

of the maze of chambers. Read or paraphrase the following

when the PCs arrive.

Relics, paintings, maps, seals, and notes fill the shelves in this

room. On a large desk is a pile of papers, an inkwell, several quills,

and a fat, lighted candle.

This area is the innermost sanctum of the Hidden Library.

The candle is an everburning variety.

Creature: Tamsin normally sits at the desk poring over

one of the hundreds of volumes that chronicles the history of

pact magic, famous binders, and legends about the vestiges.

99

She has made poor pacts with both Balam and Focalor before

the PCs arrive, so her eyes cry constantly and her voice has

an unnaturally hollow, growling timbre.

Tamsin Cutterbuck: hp 98; see page 96.

Tactics:  If  any  sounds  of  combat  emanate  from  area

5,  Tamsin  rushes  to  her  guardians  aid.  Likewise,  if  she  is

attacked here, the runic guardian in area 5 uses greater tele-

port to reach her side. If she subsequently dies, the construct

goes on a rampage, attacking everyone and everything it can

reach.

Treasure:  This  chamber  contains  2d%  books  and  4d%

scrolls. Any character who spends a year reading through

them gains a permanent +4 bonus on the Knowledge check

of her choice from the following list: Knowledge (arcana),

Knowledge (religion), or Knowledge (the planes). Transport-

ing these valuable tomes is dif cult because of their age.

The  right  buyer  (either  a  Seropaenean  or  a  binder)  will

pay 1d1010 gp for each book and 1d610 gp for each scroll.

However, locating an interested buyer is dif cult and danger-

ous, since every scrap of paper in this library is heretical in

the eyes of most churches. Anyone found with such a text in

his possession is asking for a stay in the Tower of Woe (see

the next section).

TOWER OF WOE

The heart of the Seropaenean Order is the Tower of Woe,

a massive square spire situated high in the mountains that

provides an impressive view of the land all around. Each side

of  the  towers  exterior  is  intricately  carved  with  religious

scenes. Anyone who has even a passing acquaintance with

theology (5 or more ranks in Knowledge [religion]) can read-

ily identify these works as representations of St. Cuthbert,

Heironeous, Wee Jas, and Vecna.

The locals have their own theories about this paradoxical

place. Some suggest that it was once the stronghold of an

ancient sect of universalists whose members banded together

to  oppose  some  terrible  threat  to  the  world.  Few  believe,

however, that anyone actually still lives here.

This theory is both right and wrong. The tower was built

by the Order of Seropaenes, an alliance of the four powerful

churches depicted on its walls, as a beacon in their war against

binders. The order has maintained the tower ever since, even

though the members various faiths long ago ordered them to

disband the group. To this day, the Tower of Woe still serves as

the center of the Seropaenean movement. The leaders use it to

house, interrogate, and sometimes torture captured heretics

for the purpose of unearthing the secrets of pact magic.

Even the Seropaeneans do not realize that on the Plane

of Shadow, the Black Spire (see page 185) stands as a twisted

re ection of this tower, revealing the evil within it. Kalan,

the Stealth of a coterie of witch slayers, secretly works at the

Tower of Woe to bring the entire order under the control of

the Votaries of Vecna.

From  the  ground,  the  tower  has  no  visible  entrances,

although exposed staircases are visible near the top of the

spire from the correct perspective. A few hidden guards watch

from the upper stories for intruders and curious wanderers.

A visitor can gain entry through these landings or through

a pair of locked secret doors (Open Lock DC 30, Search DC

35) near the structures base (see area 1).

1. ENTRANCE (EL 12+)

The secret doors open onto a large hall. Read or paraphrase

the following when the PCs enter.

Two rows of columns, each carved to depict a stern warrior dressed

in full plate armor and wielding a greatsword, run the length of

the room. At the far side are several doorssome are ornate and

made of gold, while others are simpler and made of wood. The

ceiling  rises  some  thirty  feet  overhead,  giving  the  chamber  a

palpable sense of majesty. Glowing globes apparently filled with

fire hang from the ceiling.

The golden doors lead into the tower proper, and the wooden

doors lead to adjoining rooms. The hanging globes contain

continual  ame effects.

Creatures: Four disciplined and loyal Seropaenean guards

encased in gleaming white full plate armor are always on duty

here.

Tactics: Two guards quickly converge on intrud-

ers and question them about their business, while

the other two move to protect the double doors at

the end of the hall. The guards attack anyone not

authorized to enter the tower, regardless of align-

ment and intent, because the tower and its purpose

must  be  kept  secret.  The  guards  use  nonlethal

means unless they detect evil among the PCs or one

of their number dies in battle. Loud noises, such as

combat, spellcasting, or shouting draw more guards

from the barracks (area 2) and the mess hall (area 4).

Guards coming from the mess arrive in 4 rounds,

but those from the barracks take only 1 round.

2. BARRACKS (EL 10)

These rooms are barracks for the guards. Read or

paraphrase  the  following  when  the  PCs  enter

any one.

This spartan chamber contains three bunk beds and six

footlockers. The room is uninteresting and somber.

The  trunks  are  unlocked  and  contain  personal

effects for the guards, including a few changes of

clothes.

Creatures: At any given time, two Seropaenean

guards are relaxing or praying here.

Seropaenean Guards (2): hp 60 each; see area 1

for statistics.

3. HALL OF CONTEMPLATION

A chapel of sorts, the Hall of Contemplation serves

as a place for the guards to worship, meditate, and

confess.

An altar stands at the far end of this room. Inscribed on

a  banner  hanging  behind  it  is  a  strange  symbol.  On

either  side  of  the  altar  stand  iron  braziers  filled  with

sweet-smelling  incense.  Near  the  door  is  a  bundle  of

rolled prayer rugs.

The symbol is that of the Order of Seropaenes.

4. MESS HALL (EL 1013)

Here the guards can relax, unwind, play cards, and take their

meals, which are typically provided by the of cers through

liberal  uses  of  create  food  and  water  spells.  The  chamber  is

furnished with many tables and benches.

Creatures:  At  any  given  time,  two  to   ve  Seropaenean

guards might be lounging here. An of cer might (25% chance)

be here as well.

5. THE WALK OF THE DOOMED

(EL 13)

This room lies just beyond the golden doors. Read or para-

phrase the following when the PCs enter.

This great chamber is dominated by a sweeping staircase that

leads to a landing, then branches into two more stairways giving

access to the level above. Steel-gray tiles cover the floor and walls,

and flaming globes hang from the ceiling at intervals to provide

light. An impossibly tall armored figure stands at attention in the

middle of the room.

The tiles are made of cold iron.

Creature: The armored  gure is an iron golem.

Iron Golem: hp 128; MM 136.

Tactics: The golem attacks anyone who is neither wearing

the livery of the Order of Seropaenes nor accompanied by

someone who is. Anyone wearing the livery of the order can

command the iron golem to attack someone not wearing it.

6. AUDIENCE HALL (EL 13)

Both sets of stairs from area 5 end at a landing before continu-

ing upward. These landings overlook a square auditorium.

Read or paraphrase the following when the characters  rst

view the audience hall.

The seating in the chamber below is arranged on different tiers,

each row lower than the last. In a small clear space at the bottom

stands a podium. The walls depict various symbols similar to those

outside the tower. Hanging from the ceiling is a massive, imposing

iron chandelier with white marble figures perched on its many

arms.

The symbols are those of the orders patron deities. The audi-

ence hall contains nothing of value.

Creatures: The  gures on the chandelier are advanced

sancti ed gargoyles (see Book of Exalted Deeds, page 186, for

information on the sancti ed template). These watchers keep

the peace in this chamber and serve as one more defense in

case attackers breach the lower areas. They remain perfectly

still until they detect intruders.

7. BLEAK HALL AND CELLS

(EL VARIES)

Both staircases from area 5 continue up from area 6, eventu-

ally converging on a single landing that connects to a stone

hallway ending in yet another staircase. Read or paraphrase

the following when the PCs enter this hallway.

The stench of fear, sweat, and excrement fills the air, as if dozens

of people were sharing too small a space. Smaller corridors lined

with cell doors extend from both sides of the hall. From these small

rooms emanate moans of suffering.

The Seropaeneans house captives here after breaking their

will in the interrogation room (see area 13). After the ques-

tioning (and often torture), the Seropaeneans rip the tongues

from their captives mouths (to prevent them from calling

up vestiges) and place them in cells.

Creatures: At any time, these cells house ten to forty bind-

ers and binder sympathizers of various levels. In addition,

the jailer (see area 8) sometimes walks these halls.

Binders (1040): hp varies; create statistics as desired.

Jailer: hp 307; see area 8 for statistics.

Development: If the jailer is not present, any loud noise

attracts his attention, bringing him here in 1d4 rounds.

8. JAILER (EL 17)

This chamber serves as the living quarters for the creature

known as the jailer. Read or paraphrase the following, adjust-

ing as needed if the jailer is present.

This large chamber is obviously used for storage. Big grain sacks

are piled in one corner next to several wooden casks. A pile of old

hides stands in another corner.

The casks contain water and the sacks are  lled with grain.

The hides serve as a bed for the rooms sole inhabitant.

Creature:  The  jailer,  a  hill  giant  who  forgot  his  name

long ago, has an important responsibility. He must feed the

prisoners their gruel, water them, and prevent them from

committing suicide. Though he is stupid and evil, he hopes

that one day the masters will purify him the way they did the

gargoyles and allow him to join their crusade to wipe out the

hereticsMaybe he will even become a paladin. For now,

though, hes content to watch over his  ock.

The jailers main wickedness is neglect. He either forgets

to feed the prisoners for days at a time, or feeds them too

often. Thus, disease runs rampant through the cells, and the

losses are appalling. However, the jailer is serious about his

job, even if he doesnt do it well. He walks the hall regularly,

and when he isnt there, he listens for and investigates any

suspicious noises coming from the cells.

9. HALL OF INSPIRATION

The long staircase ends at the entrance to a square room.

This  room  has  a  door  on  either  side.  Directly  across  from  the

entrance is another set of stairs leading up to the next level. The

chamber is warm and brightly lit, and a faint scent of sandalwood

perfumes the air.

This chamber is empty.

10. OFFICERS QUARTERS (EL 12+)

Each of the doors leading out from area 9 opens on a hall

with more doors lining the outer wall. Each door opens into

the private quarters of an of cer. All the rooms in this area

are identicalbare cells where the of cers can spend time

in contemplation.

Creatures: Five of cers are in this area at any given time.

Select the rooms they occupy at random.

Development: Sounds of combat in one room attract the

attention of the other of cers, bringing them to the battle

site in 1d4 rounds.

11. EXPOSED LANDING (EL 17)

The stairs from area 9 end at an exposed landing. Read or

paraphrase the following when the PCs arrive.

The wind whips across the landing, creating an intense feeling of

vertigo. At each cardinal point, another staircase leads to the

level above.

Creatures:  Four  elite  guards  patrol  this  open  area.  Their

 rst duty is to protect their masters above; the second is to

use their vantage point to watch for suspicious people who

seem too interested in the tower. These guards are loyal to

the Seropaeneans and have gone so far as to cut out their own

tongues as part of a special vow to protect what they overhear

in the adjacent room.

Tactics:  Since  no  one  except  the  leaders  can  enter  this

level, the guards attack anyone they do not recognize. If the

guards saw the PCs enter the tower or heard the sounds of

combat, they prepare for a  ght by taking several rounds to

cast spells and use their wands. If the PCs somehow man-

aged  to  surprise  the  guards  while  they  were  unprepared,

use the information from the second statistics block given

below in place of those from the  rst. If the guards hear the

PCs coming, they all hide in plain sight and then follow the

characters closely while studying them in preparation for

death attacks.

In combat, they use walls of  re from their wands to impede

and divide the PCs. Then they use lightning bolts from their

wands against foes they cannot  ank.

12. HALL OF SIGHS

Four doors give access to this grim chamber of dark stone. In the

center of the room is a single wooden seat. Torture devices such

as racks, iron maidens, thumbscrews, and more stand ready to

provide extra incentive to prisoners.

A permanent area of nullifying magic like that of an anti-

magic  eld covers an area 10 feet around the seat. The leaders

interrogate  their  prisoners  here,  learning  what  they  can

about pact magic and its practitioners. Most of the time, the

room is empty.

13. CHAMBER OF HEIRONEOUS

The priest of Heironeous who once of this chamber died in

a terrible confrontation with a group of binders. Since his

death, his room has been left just as it was.

This chamber is furnished with a bed and two comfortable chairs.

On the wall hangs a map, and a small altar stands in one corner.

Plenty  of  candles  and  other  religious  paraphernalia  give  mute

evidence of the occupants strong religious convictions.

A character who succeeds on a DC 25 Search check while

examining this chamber discovers a hastily scribbled note

regarding concerns about someone named Kalan. The note

says that this person seems more interested in the Plane of

Shadow than in containing binders. Also, the writer notes

another new development in magic that the towers occu-

pants discovered when they captured a truenamer instead

of a binder.

14. CHAMBER OF ST. CUTHBERT

(EL 0 OR 16)

The furnishings in this triangular room include a comfortable bed,

a wardrobe, a rack for armor and weapons, and a writing desk

with a few papers on it. On the wall beside the bed hangs a silvery

symbol coated in tarnish and dust.

The symbol on the wall is St. Cuthberts holy symbol.

Creature:  The  rooms  occupant,  Sir  Michael  Ambrose,

is  the  representative  of  St.  Cuthbert.  He  rarely  stays  here

because  he  prefers  to  remain  in  the   eld.  At  any  time,

Ambrose has only a 30% chance to be here.

Sir Michael Ambrose: hp 113; see page 93 for statistics.

Development: A search of the room turns up a few papers

describing possible binder cells all over the continent, but

nothing of value.

15. CHAMBER OF WEE JAS (EL 16)

This room is home to the towers representative of Wee Jas.

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs arrive.

This macabre triangular room has black walls and a black floor.

On the ceiling, however, is a mural depicting a beautiful woman

surrounded by clinging mist. Corpses caper and dance around her.

The rooms only furnishings are a bed, a desk, a wardrobe, and a

worktable. On the table, a corpse lies twitching, its organs exposed

to the air. Flies buzz all around the grisly mass.

The  mural  depicts  the  goddess  of  death  and  magic.  The

zombie on the table was a human binder in life.

Creatures:  Eiliera,  priestess  of  Wee  Jas,  spends  a  great

deal  of  time  here  exploring  the  arts  of  necromancy.  She

feigns concern for the problems faced by the order, but in

truth she has little interest in its doings. Her only purpose

in dwelling here is to claim the corpses of prisoners and use

them to advance her studies.

16. CHAMBER OF VECNA (EL 0 OR 15)

The door to this room is locked (Open Lock DC 40). Read or

paraphrase the following if the PCs manage to enter.

This cold, dark chamber is filled with a putrid odor. The whole

room seems unspeakably vile, though it is empty except for a disk

of flickering violet energy and a rotting corpse on the floor. The

shadows seem alive, flickering and dancing in the periphery of

the room.

A permanent gate to the Plane of Shadow is the source of the

strangely alive shadows in this room. Kalan, the adherent

of Vecna who dwells here, compelled a wizard to create the

gate and then murdered him, leaving him to rot where he

layhence the odor. Occasionally shadow creatures come

through the gate, but they rarely stay for long.

Kalan uses the gate primarily to communicate with Crest-

ian (see page 189) because he prefers to receive instructions

on some neutral ground. Kalan is here 50% of the time. The

rest of the time, he is on the Plane of Shadow or elsewhere

on a mission.

efore creation, darkness was all, and

it waits even now beyond the edges

of all worlds. In time, the greatest

of lights and the brightest of suns

must dim and gutter. Day might

banish night for a while, but night

always returns.

On  various  planes  of  existence

dwell those who follow this notion to its

ultimate  conclusion.  Most  frequently  called  the  Doctrine

of  Eternal  Night,  it  posits  that  darkness  is  the  only  truly

eternal concept of the multiverse. As such, it must be the

greatest. Symbolically and physically, darkness is the ultimate

forcethe  nal result of all efforts.

As with symbolism and physics, so too with magic. Wiz-

ards call down  re, druids channel the essence of nature,

and clerics wield the powers of the gods themselves. Yet in

time, the greatest of those magics fades, worlds crumble to

dust, and even gods die. The magic of shadow is not  ashy,

beautiful, or divine, but it is eternal, and thus superior.

From shadowcasters who master dark mysteries to prestige

classes that wield advanced shadow magic; from feats, both

general  and  metashadow,  to  mysteries;  from  monsters  to

organizations; this chapter allows DMs and players alike to

make shadow magic an integral part of any campaign.

THE PLANE OF SHADOW

The Plane of Shadow neighbors and overlaps the Material

Plane, and many of the others as well. It is a dark, twisted

re ection of the real world, made all the more alien by its

nagging  similarities.  Color  is  a  faded  memory,  bleached

from the world and replaced with shades of gray. The sky is

an endless vault of black, with neither sun nor stars to break

the gloom. Emotions are as muted as colorslove and hate,

joy and sorrow, mirth and mourning are all less potent, less

expressive. Only true needshunger, thirst, exhaustion, and

painremain undiminished. Bring all the light you like; it

will not shine half so brightly as it does in the darkest night

of your own world.

The Plane of Shadow is the literal shadow of the Material

Plane,  cast  not  by  any  light  but  by  the  mystical  energies

that  hold  creation  together.  The  domain  contains  twisted

re ections of everything that exists in the physical realm.

Mountains rise from the earth, but they are perverse and

foreboding.  Structures  stand  clustered  into  communities,

but they are warped and often worn.

The most twisted of all areas are the Darklands scattered

throughout the Plane of Shadow. These stretches of land are

infused with negative energy. They suck life from those who

travel them. Desolate, bleak, and forlorn, the Darklands are

the most inhospitable terrain in a harsh realm.

It is only natural to consider the Plane of Shadow lesser

than the Material Plane. After all, it is merely a re ection of

true existence, a shadow distorted by the angle of the light

and the movements of the world. It is simple image without

substance. A rare few understand a deeper truth, however.

Shadow is sculpted in the endless darkness. Carved from the

only force that is truly eternal, it has a greater meaning, and a

greater existence, than the physical world itself. Rather than

the Plane of Shadow poorly re ecting the Material Plane, the

plane of light and substance is the ephemeral re ection of

all-encompassing shadow.

THE METHODS OF SHADOW MAGIC

Shadow magic is subtle and indirect. It involves two funda-

mental principles of mysticism.

SYMPATHY

Like affects like. If a caster controls a thing similar to, or

related to, a target, the mage controls the target itself. Spell-

casters of certain cultures take advantage of this principle

with dolls shaped like speci c people, or by stealing a lock

of hair or an item of clothing belonging to their intended

targets.  Shadow  magic  takes  this  concept  much  further

by  taking  advantage  of  perhaps  the  greatest  example  of

sympathy. By manipulating the shadows of individuals, the

caster can control their minds, their souls, and even their

physical forms.

REFLECTION

For every action, an equal and opposite reaction exists. The

reaction is not visible in most forms of magic. The wizard

who casts a  reball into the midst of his enemies neither sees

nor cares about the brief amount of  ame that vanishes from

the Elemental Plane of Fire to power that spell. The cleric

who heals a dying friend knows that her god is a being of

such might, he scarcely notices the energy she draws from

him. Shadow magic does not hide these effects, but rather

uses them, creating strength from weakness, substance from

emptiness, and dark from light.

LESSER SHADOW MAGIC

Shadow magic has its lesser but far more familiar cousins.

Casters of shadow magic scoff at those who believe that these

feeble magics represent the limits of shadow. In truth, they

barely scratch the surface.

Darkness and Related Spells: All spellcasters tap into

the  Plane  of  Shadow  when  creating  darkness.  They  draw

extraplanar shadows to them, for no shadow of the Material

Plane  is  strong  enough  to  displace  the  light.  Comparing

these manipulations of shadow to those practiced by shadow

magic users, however, is as comparing a child playing with

rude clay to the skillful efforts of a master sculptor. Others

can  only  force  shadow  through  the  planar  boundaries  in

 xed amounts; the shadow master can manipulate ambient

lighting as a bard manipulates sound.

Shadow-Based Illusions: Several spells of the illusion

school draw on shadowstuff to add an element of reality to

their images. Swords seem to cut, lightning to burn. Yet these

are no more real than any other illusion. They are shadows of

shadows, merely skimming the tiniest amount of substance

from the dark plane. Shadow magic casters understand that

they need not settle for semireal images. They can create true

items, as solid as anything found on the Material Plane.

Negative Energy: The association of negative energy with

shadow is in fact a false one, although many of the wisest

scholarsand even some shadow magic userscontinue

to make it. The propensity of mortal minds to associate the

symbolic with the real causes most people to think of positive

energy as light and negative energy as dark. The reasoning

proceedsif negative energy is dark and shadow is dark, they

must stem from the same source. In truth, shadow and nega-

tive energy are separate cosmic forces, although they attract

many of the same entities and can be used to accomplish

some of the same effects. When a shadow magic caster draws

the life or strength out of a foe, however, she is funneling the

foes essence into the Plane of Shadow, replacing it with less

animate shadows. She need not manipulate negative energy,

any  more  than  evil  clerics  manipulate  shadow  to  control

undead.

Shadowdancers: Not all who manipulate shadow do so

through intense study and arcane formulae. A rare few grow

so close to darkness, they brush the edges of shadow on an

instinctive level. Shadowdancers pierce the borders of the

Plane of Shadow when they make use of their abilities, even

if they remain ignorant of that fact. To date, shadow magic

casters have been unable to determine what it is about shad-

owdancers that grants them this innate link to shadow, but

it is an area of intense study and debate within their various

societies and organizations.

LEARNING SHADOW MAGIC

The secrets of true shadow magic are dif cult to learn, for

only a rare and jealous minority possesses them. The major-

ity of such lore can be found in the hands of a few speci c

organizations, such as the Tenebrous Cabal, and knowledge

seekers must petition them for access. Although a few ancient

libraries and lost ruins contain tomes of shadow lore, these

are usually insuf cient for readers to become shadow magic

casters simply by perusing them. At best, they might point in

the direction of other, more useful sources. Some religious

sects and temples also possess writings and lore regarding

shadow  magic.  The  priesthoods  of  many  dark  gods  study

the  Plane  of  Shadow,  believing  it  to  be  an  aspect  of  their

deitys power.

As a matter of self-preservation, these groups seek out those

who show both an aptitude for magic and a desire to delve

into the mystic. With varying degrees of ritual, they share the

secrets of the multiverse and shadow magic with a desirable

applicant. Because it requires a devoted, disciplined mind to

master shadow magic, for it is alien in ways that other magics

are not, these groups approach potential recruits infrequently

and accept petitioners even more rarely. Still, for those who

prove themselves both capable and devoted, access to these

organizations  opens  up  an  entirely  new  understanding  of

magic, of eternity, and of reality itself.

THE SHADOW WEAVE OF TORIL

In  the  FORGOTTEN  REALMS  campaign  setting,  the  Weave  is  a

network  of  mystical  energies,  the  source  of  magic  for  all

the  world.  The  rare  Toril  caster  understands  that  a  second

source of magic exists in the gaps of the Weave itself. This is

a perfect example of the second principle of shadow magic in

action. Because the Weave draws in energies, not just from

extraplanar sources, but from the world around it, it leaves

holes in reality where those energies come from. This is the

Shadow  Weave,  a  network  of  negative  magic.  Those  few

who truly understand it, such as shadow magic casters, use

the Shadow Weave as a source for their power, drawing on it

the way shadow mages of other worlds draw directly from the

Plane of Shadow.

and understanding of the mystical in general, and of shadow

in particular.

Abilities: Shadowcasters must be both clever and con -

dent, studious and determined; Intelligence and Charisma

both impact their mysteries. Wisdom is useful for perception,

particularly if they opt for any of the scrying-oriented paths.

Because shadowcasters rarely wear armor, a high Dexterity

proves helpful.

Races: The majority of shadowcasters are humans or half-

elves, individuals whose quest for power, understanding, or

knowledge is at the forefront of their personas. Dwarves tend

to see shadowcasters as agents of evil, even if they are unwit-

ting ones. Elves do not necessarily consider them evil, but

they do see shadow magic as unnatural, and therefore harmful

even when their masters intend no malice. Gnomes are more

accepting of shadowcasters. They view them with suspicion,

but simultaneously respect their drive and wonder at the great

arcane secrets they possess. Hal ings fear shadowcasters for

their powers but envy their ability to enter and explore the

dark, hidden places. Half-orcs tend to distrust shadowcast-

ers,  although  some  lust  after  their  abilities;  however,  few

half-orcs  have  the  mental  capacity  to  be  effective

shadowcasters.

Alignment:  Shadowcasters  deal  with  dark

powers,  magic  often  associated  with  evil,  and

live with a skewed percep-

tion of the world itself.

M a s t e r i n g

the  paths

and  mys-

teries, and

learning  to  com-

prehend the world through

the alien  lter of the Plane of Shadow, requires

an exceedingly disciplined, organized mind.

Thus, while shadowcasters can be of any align-

ment, those with good or chaotic alignments

are exceedingly rare.

Starting Gold: 3d410 (75 gp).

Starting Age: As wizard.

THE SHADOWCASTER

Behind the  re, between the worlds, in all the empty spaces, at the

end of all things, we are there. Matter, light, lifethese things are

 eeting. Shadow, only shadow, is eternal.

Eddas Coradran, Lord of the First House,

Parliament of Shadows

All things fall into shadow, even light. Shadows do not repre-

sent the absence of light; they show the presence of darkness.

Thus, shadow and darkness are not death or diminishment;

they are the fundamental state of the universe, the constant

that existed before, that exists now, and that will exist when

all other things are snuffed out. So it is with the Plane of

Shadow, that dark mirror to the Material Plane and many

other realities. Shadowcasters tap into this most fundamen-

tal of forces and planes to work their dark wills. By tying

themselves to the Plane of Shadow, they maintain a tenuous

link to the ultimate force of existence.

The shadowcaster understands the true, primal power of

darkness, attunes herself to the Plane of Shadow, and learns

great  shadow  mysteries  the  equal  of  any  mundane  spell.

These dark casters are workers of alien magic, possessing

an occult understanding of the world and magic that even

other spellcasters  nd disturbing. They are masters of a dark

powerand perhaps, as some worry, its servants as well.

MAKING A SHADOWCASTER

The shadowcaster is a potent magic

user.  Her  abilities  are  tightly

focused, making her somewhat less

versatile than other spellcasters,

but what she lacks in range she

makes  up  in  sheer  capability.

Shadow  magic  is  unfamiliar  to

most  enemies  and,  especially  at

higher  levels,  far  more  dif cult

to  counter,  disrupt,  or  dispel.

Depending  on  the  shadowcasters

focus  and  choice  of  paths,  she  might  be  an  exceptional

scout,  a  master  of  scrying,  a  commander  of  shadowy

minions, a thief of life, or any combination thereof. Like

most spell users, her role depends largely on the magic

she chooses.

Those  who  walk  the  dark  road  of  shadow  magic

must  fortify  themselves  against  the  pull  of  the

Plane of Shadow. As the power the plane grants

grows, so too does its grip on a shadowcasters

soul. This constant contest between shadow

and soul strengthens a shadowcasters will

and fortitude.

Few  shadowcasters  are  leaders  of

adventuring  groups,  being  more  con-

cerned  with  expanding  their  knowledge

any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes

with your gestures, which can cause your mysteries to fail

when they function as spells.

Fundamentals of Shadow (Su): As a shadowcaster, you

must master certain basic powers before proceeding to deeper

secrets  of  shadow.  These  powers,  known  as  fundamentals,

function as supernatural abilities usable three times per day.

You begin play with three fundamentals and gain an additional

fundamental  at  4th  level  and  every  four  additional  levels

beyond 4th. At 14th level, you can use your fundamentals an

unlimited number of times per day. You can, when gaining

a new level, choose a new fundamental in place of another

mystery. When choosing a fundamental, you can relearn an

already known fundamental, thus gaining another set of uses

of that fundamental per day. The save DC of any fundamental

is equal to 10 + your Cha modi er.

Mysteries and Paths: You do not cast spells as other classes

do, but instead invoke mystical secrets called mysteries (see

pages 139153). You know one mystery at 1st level and gain one

additional mystery every class level. Up to 6th level, you can

learn only apprentice mysteries. At 7th level, you gain access

to initiate mysteries, and at 13th level you become able to use

master mysteries. You can choose your new mystery from any

category  you  have  access  to  (including  fundamentals).  For

instance, at 8th level, you could select either a fundamental,

an apprentice mystery, or an initiate mystery.

Shadow magic progresses in very speci c stages. You may

not jump ahead in a path, although you need not complete

a path if you do not wish to. Within a category (apprentice,

initiate, master), you can only learn mysteries of a new level

if you have learned at least two mysteries of a previous level,

and you must know all previous mysteries within a path to

select a mystery from that path. For example, you cannot learn

congress of shadows (the second mystery of the Ebon Whispers

path) until you know at least two 1st-level mysteries, one of

which must be voice of shadow (the  rst mystery of that path).

However, you can always select the  rst mystery in a path

of a category you have access to, even if you didnt complete

the lower category paths. For example, you could learn the

shadow vision mystery, the  rst one (4th level) in the Initiate

Veil of Shadows path, even if you know no 3rd level mysteries

(all of which are in the Apprentice category).

Mysteries  represent  thought  patterns  and  formulae  so

alien that other spells seem simple in comparison. As you

progress, however, your connection to the Plane of Shadow

grows stronger, and your mysteries become more ingrained in

your essence. When you are capable of casting only apprentice

mysteries, you cast them as though they were arcane spells.

They all have somatic components, armor-based spell failure

chance,  and  are  subject  to  interruption  (but  they  do  not

require material components, foci, or verbal components).

Whenever you cast a mystery as an arcane spell, observers

can make a DC 15 Spot check to note that your shadow is

making  different  gestures  from  the  ones  you  make  when

you cast the mystery (see Detecting Mysteries, page 138).

At 7th level, when you become capable of casting initiate

mysteries  (whether  or  not  you  choose  to  learn  any),  your

apprentice  mysteries  become  so  much  a  part  of  you  that

they now function as spell-like abilities, and they no longer

require  somatic  components.  Your  new  initiate  mysteries

(when you learn them) function as arcane spells and follow

the rules described above.

When you reach 13th level and become capable of cast-

ing master mysteries, another change occurs. Your master

mysteries now function as arcane spells, and your initiate

mysteries  function  as  spell-like  abilities.  Your  apprentice

112

mysteries become supernatural abilities. (See page 139 for

rules governing supernatural abilities.)

You can learn a mystery more than once. Each time you

relearn a mystery, you gain another set of uses of that mystery

per day.

You  can  use  each  mystery  you  know  a  certain  number

of times per day depending on whether it is cast as a spell

(once), a spell-like ability (two times), or a supernatural ability

(three times). The allotments per level are given on Table 22,

but only apply if you are able to cast mysteries of the level

indicated.  For  example,  if  you  choose  breadth  over  depth

and know no 4th-level mysteries as a 7th-level shadowcaster,

you cannot take advantage of the one use per mystery per

day detailed in the table. Unlike spellcasters, you dont get

bonus mysteries for a high ability score. Although you do

not prepare spells, you must rest for 8 hours and meditate

for 15 minutes each day to regain your use of mysteries just

as a sorcerer or bard must rest and meditate to regain use of

spell slots.

In order to cast a mystery, you must have an Intelligence

score of at least 10 + the mysterys level. The save DC for your

mysteries  equals  10  +  mystery  level  +  your  Cha  modi er.

Even though as a shadowcaster you do not cast spells in

the traditional sense, your levels in this class count for the

purpose of determining your overall caster level.

Bonus Feats: Beginning at 2nd level, you gain bonus feats

equal to half the total number of paths you have access to,

rounded down. For instance, most shadowcasters know the

 rst mystery of two different paths at 2nd level, so they gain

one bonus feat. If you learn the  rst mystery of a third path at

3rd level, you still have only one bonus feat, but if you learn

the  rst mystery of yet another path at 4th level, you know

four paths, and therefore gain a second bonus feat. Thus, you

have a choice: fully master fewer paths and gain access to more

high-level mysteries, or branch out into more paths and gain

more feats but fewer high-level mysteries. You do not gain a

new bonus feat for repeating a path you already know, and

fundamentals do not apply for the purpose of bonus feats.

You must meet the prerequisite (if any) in order to select

a feat as a bonus feat. The list of feats you can select includes

any metamagic feat (as described in the Players Handbook),

Favored Mystery, Greater Path Focus, Nocturnal Caster, Path

Focus, Shadow Vision, and any metashadow feat.

Umbral Sight (Su): When you reach 3rd level, your vision

extends slightly into the Plane of Shadow. You gain darkvision

out to 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, or gain it from

some  other  source,  the  effective  distance  of  that  vision  is

increased by 30 feet. At 11th level, you become able to see

perfectly in complete darkness, even magical darkness, out

to 60 feet.

Sustaining  Shadow  (Ex):  When  you  reach  5th  level,

your bond to the Plane of Shadow allows you to absorb dark

energies, mitigating certain biological needs. You need eat

only a single meal per week to maintain health. At 10th level,

you only need 1 hour of sleep per night (but you must still

rest for 8 hours to regain your mysteries for the next day). At

15th level, you gain immunity to nonmagical diseases and

poisons. Finally, at 20th level, you no longer need to breathe,

and need never eat or sleep.

PLAYING A SHADOWCASTER

You  are  a  master  of  arcane  secrets  far  greater  than  any

otheror at least you will be. You understand what others

do not: All power stems from darkness. All reality is a faade,

and everything is symbolism; by changing a things re ec-

tionits shadowyou change the thing itself. Other forms

of  magic,  and  other  religions,  arent  necessarily  inferior

or worthy of scorn; its simply that they see only a part of

the whole, the  rst layer of a deeper truth. You rarely take

anything at face value or make snap decisions. You might be

inclined to see conspiracies where none exist, so accustomed

are you to looking for the shadows behind the obvious.

Mostly, you adventure to perfect your understanding and

mastery of shadow. You likely prefer endeavors that allow you

frequent use of your mysteries and other abilities, or those

that promise access to ancient lore. You might have personal

goals as well, and its not uncommon for shadowcasters to

adventure for the sake of riches, to avenge a past wrong, or

for any other standard adventure motive.

RELIGION

If  you  are  the  scholarly  type,  you  might  eschew  religion,

preferring to focus entirely on your own abilities and those

offered  by  shadow  magic.  Those  of  you  who  do  subscribe

to  religion  most  frequently  follow  deities  of  darkness,

mystic knowledge, and secrets, such as Boccob, Vecna, and

Wee Jas.

OTHER CLASSES

You  tend  to  view  other  spellcasters,  arcane  and  divine,  as

both  talented  and  misguided.  You  respect  the  abilities  of

these other classes, and acknowledge that they can perform

feats that you cannot. Nevertheless, you usually maintain that

darkness is the ultimate power of the multiverse, and those

113

who devote themselves to other magic, and other powers,

are deluded. You appreciate  ghters and barbarians, who can

handle physical threats while you deal with more esoteric

matters. You enjoy the company of rogues, as you understand

the rogues need to hide from the eyes of others. You tend not

to get along well with paladins, who are usually mistrustful;

with druids, who view mysteries as outside nature; or with

bards, who seem  ighty and unfocused.

HUMAN SHADOWCASTER

STARTING PACKAGE

Armor: None (speed 30 ft.)

Weapons: Quarterstaff (1d6, crit 2, 4 lb., two-handed,

bludgeoning).

Light crossbow (1d8, crit 1920/2, range inc. 80 ft., 4 lb.,

piercing).

Skill Selection: Pick a number of skills equal to 3 + Int

modi er.

COMBAT

You possess fewer overtly damaging powers than spellcast-

ers. Against a single foe, you are quite capable of dealing

damage on par with any wizard, assuming you have selected

the proper mysteries. Against a larger number of enemies,

however,  your  area-affecting  abilities  are  better  suited

toward  weakening  or  impeding  your  foes  so  that  your

companions can  nish them offat least until you reach

higher levels.

If you have selected any of the perception-related mys-

teries,  you  are  particularly  adept  in  arranging  ambushes,

 anks,  and  other  tactical  maneuvers  involving  surprise.

Your abilities to see the battle eld from all angles, or in the

dark, allow you to position your companions for maximum

effectiveness.

At high levels, you can often call forth weapons and min-

ions of darkness, enabling you to turn many battles through

sheer weight of numbers, without putting yourself directly

in harms way. Consider gaining pro ciency in armor and

wearing  it  at  this  point.  Only  your  master-path  mysteries

risk  spell  failure  from  wearing  armor,  and  magic  armor

with  a  low  arcane  spell  failure  chance  minimizes  that.  A

magic shield is a particularly good option because it can be

set aside when casting master-path mysteries but held in all

other situations.

ADVANCEMENT

Continuing your development as a shadowcaster requires a

substantial amount of time and effort. You must study arcane

and esoteric texts, not merely to learn new mysteries but to

comprehend the very nature of what you do. You must investi-

gate the interaction of planes and forces. You might also elect

to study shadow magic in a religious context, determining

how the Plane of Shadow  ts into your belief systemor at

the very least how it impacts the beliefs of other shadowcast-

ers, so you can better understand them.

When you are not studying, you are practicing, training

your mind to comprehend the alien formulae of mysteries,

and your body to channel ever greater amounts of shadow-

stuff. As you reach high levels, you might start to feel a bit

distant  from  your  companions.  You  could   nd  it  dif cult

to maintain friendships; the changes in your thought pat-

terns and physiology leave you feeling much less human (or

whatever race you are).

Mechanically, you should increase your Intelligence and

Charisma as you attain levels. Beyond this, focus on feats and

skills that enhance the mysteries you have chosen.

SHADOWCASTERS IN THE WORLD

I wish I could say which bothers me more . . . that shadowcasters

claim darkness is the greatest power of the cosmos, or that a small

part of me believes they might be right.

Jinna Aurinaire, priestess of Pelor

A shadowcaster is perhaps the most frightening magic user the

PCs might run across. Her abilities are strange and dark, she

can do things no other class can, and she practices magic in

ways unfamiliar to even the most learned wizard. As villains,

shadowcasters should terrify even con dent parties. As PCs,

they allow players to approach the use of magic in new and excit-

ing ways. Perhaps most important for DMs, the shadowcaster is

a walking plot hook; from the fearful and hateful reactions of

those who do not understand her, to her innate connection to

the mysterious Plane of Shadow, a single shadowcaster provides

fodder for an entire series of adventures.

DAILY LIFE

When not adventuring, shadowcasters spend the majority of

their time in study, meditation, and contemplation. No less

so than wizards, shadowcasters must constantly research new

discoveries regarding their powers and the sources thereof and

must review formulae and esoteric concepts so thoroughly that

they burn them into their minds. This is not to say that shad-

owcasters have no life outside their mystical pursuits, simply

that they have little time to devote to other endeavors.

114

NOTABLES

Few shadowcasters are particularly famous; shadow magic

does  not  lend  itself  to   ashy  displays.  Many  practitioners

remain hidden from the eyes of those who would destroy

them. Still, several shadowcasters have gained fame or noto-

riety, in the eyes of their comrades if not the outside world.

These include Eddas Coradran, one of the most vocal leaders

of  the  Parliament  of  Shadows,  who  believes  the  organiza-

tion  holds  authority  over  all  shadowcasters  whether  they

acknowledge it or not; his daughter Irrin, the so-called left

hand of the Parliament; Zathra Kuhn, called the Daughter of

Night, one of the infamous enforcers of the Brotherhood of

the Blinded Sun; and Hallair Shadowmane, an elf priest and

shadowcaster who departed to dwell in a hermitagesome

say in the Plane of Shadow itself.

NPC REACTIONS

Few  people  understand  shadowcasters,  and  even  fewer

trust them. The common association of darkness with evil

is  simply  too  hard  to  shake,  particularly  since  a  goodly

number  of  shadowcasters  are  evil,  or  at  least  uncaring  of

others. Most common folk react to shadowcasters as they

would any other arcane spellcaster, unaware that they are

dealing with something different. Should a shadowcaster

reveal her unusual natureperhaps by casting a blatantly

shadow-oriented effect, or by allowing others to spot her

shadows  unnatural  movementsmost  people  become

unfriendly or even hostile. Spellcasters are also unfriendly,

for they neither trust nor comprehend the shadowcasters

abilities. Clerics of gods of darkness and shadow, however,

are often quite friendly toward shadowcasters, at least ini-

tially.  Good-hearted  shadowcasters  can  usually  overcome

these reactions, given time and opportunity, but it requires

substantial effort.

Clerics of gods of light are particularly hostile to shadow-

casters, and many remain rivals even if a shadowcaster has

proven  to  be  an  ally.  Similarly,  evil  creatures  of  darkness

consider shadowcasters dangerous, fearing that the mystery

users  might  too  easily  discover  their  own  vulnerabilities

and exploit their powers. For their own part, shadowcasters

usually  return  such  hostility  in  kind,  considering  each  a

potential threat.

SHADOWCASTER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge

(the  planes)  can  research  shadowcasters  to  learn  more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: Shadowcasters are magic users who focus on the

powers of darkness and shadow.

DC 15: Shadowcasters draw their power from the Plane

of Shadow, shaping it into magic both familiar and alien to

other  practitioners.  They  believe  that  shadow,  as  both  the

re ection of the material world and the substance between

worlds, is the only eternal force in existence.

DC 20:  Shadowcasters  grow  inextricably  linked  to  the

Plane  of  Shadow  as  they  continue  their  studies.  They  no

longer have even the most basic biological needs, and their

powers become so great that they can cast many of their spells

as innate abilities.

A DC 20 Gather Information or Knowledge (religion) check

in a very high-magic community, or one in which a god of

darkness or night is worshiped, will reveal the existence of

shadowcasters.

A bardic knowledge check can reveal the same information

as these skill checks, but in each case the DC is 5 higher than

the given value.

A CREEPING DARKNESS:

MULTICLASS SHADOWCASTERS

Darkness spreads, and night overcomes the day. Experienced

spellcasters who turn their efforts toward shadow might find

their  connection  to  primal  darkness  growing  swiftly,  at  the

expense of their previous abilities.

When a multiclass sorcerer or wizard gains a new shadowcaster

level, she can choose to sacrifice a preexisting level of sorcerer

or wizard, in exchange for an additional shadowcaster level. For

instance, a 3rd-level wizard/4th-level shadowcaster who attains

a new shadowcaster level becomes either a 3rd-level wizard/5th-

level shadowcaster, or a 2nd-level wizard/6th-level shadowcaster.

A character can exchange only one such level at a time.

When swapping levels, make the following changes:

(cid:129)  Add 1 hit point, to represent the average difference between

the sorcerer/wizards d4 Hit Die and the shadowcasters d6.

(cid:129)  When exchanging sorcerer levels, you must also remove an

appropriate number of spells from the sorcerers list of spells

known. A wizard who exchanges a level does not lose spells

from his spellbook, though some spells might no longer be

available.

(cid:129)  Leave  skills  gained  at  that  level  as  they  are;  these  classes

have  the  same  number  of  skill  points,  and  many  skills  in

common.

(cid:129)  When replacing any wizard level at which you gained a bonus

feat, you lose that feat.

(cid:129)  When replacing any level at which you gained one of the fol-

lowing feats as a normal feat (not a class-related bonus feat),

swap  it  out  as  follows:  Trade  metamagic  feats  for  similar

metashadow feats, Spell Focus for Path Focus, and Greater

Spell Focus for Greater Path Focus.

(cid:129)  You cant lose a feat or class ability that would make you in-

eligible for any other feat or prestige class you already have,

even if this means you can no longer take advantage of the

creeping darkness feature.

This notion of creeping darkness does more than add an alien

element to shadow magic. DMs who introduce shadow magic

into  an  ongoing  campaign  can  use  this  as  a  way  of  allowing

players to embrace the new material without having to abandon

their existing characters.

115

SHADOWCASTERS IN THE GAME

Irrin Coradran

CR 13

In  an  ongoing  game,  shadowcasters  might  be  restricted

to  speci c  organizations,  particularly  those  with  which

the PCs have not dealt. Maybe only a particular college or

church possesses these secrets. Given the planar source of

their power, perhaps they did not even exist in the world

until recently, traveling there from elsewhere by means of

the Plane of Shadow.

If you have a player with a shadowcaster PC, allow the

PC to excel on occasion. The magic of the shadowcaster is

more subtle and more alien than those of other classes. If

the  campaign  consists  primarily  of  large-scale  battles,  a

shadowcaster might (at least at low levels) feel inferior to a

sorcerer or wizard. Although she is not ineffective in such

circumstances,  she  truly  shines  in  battle  against  single,

more potent foes. She is also very comfortable in circum-

stances  requiring  espionage  or  deceit,  or  when  normal

strategies  have  failed  and  creative  solutions  and  abilities

are called for.

ADAPTATION

While  the  shadowcasters  magic  comes  from,  and  focuses

on, the Plane of Shadow, other options exist. In a cosmology

where no such plane exists, shadowcasters might draw their

powers from a deity of night, functioning as divine rather

than  arcane  casters.  Alternatively,  they  might  draw  their

power from night itself, becoming more potent after sunset

but less so during the day. Perhaps the shadowcaster does

not manipulate shadow at all, instead using smoke or mist

to accomplish similar effects.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Encounters with shadowcasters should play up the alien and

mysterious nature of their abilities. This is not limited to their

mysteriesalthough those are certainly the most obvious

features on which to focusbut also the means by which they

cast those mysteries, the odd knowledge and philosophies

that make up their arts, and the odd interactions between

mysteries and normal spells.

EL 12: Irrin Coradran is the daughter of Eddas Coradran, a

Lord of the First House of the Parliament of Shadows. While

her  father  generally  engages  in  political,  administrative,

and research activities, Irrin is one of the most potent  eld

agents of the Tenebrous Cabal, and holds rank as a Lady of

the Second House. She might be investigating new members,

researching threats to the Cabal, or seeking out other casters

to trade, purchase, or (if all else fails) take whatever lore they

might have.

SHADOW MAGIC

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Shadows  can  take  any  shape  and  shadow  magic  is  no  less

protean. For those who wish to manipulate darkness without

abandoning  their  previous  abilities,  or  for  shadowcasters

with  unusually  esoteric  interests,  the  following  prestige

classes are available.

PRESTIGE CLASS CASTING ADVANCEMENTS

When  a  shadowcaster  gains  new  casting  class  levels  from

advancement  within  a  prestige  class,  this  includes  the

knowledge  of  new  fundamentals,  and  the  transformation

of lower-level path mysteries into spell-like or supernatural

abilities. It does not include gaining bonus feats for learning

new paths or any other shadowcaster class features.

SHADOWCASTERS AND

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Shadowcasters are a breed apart and do not always qualify

for prestige classes that are available to more common magic

users.

Levels  in  shadowcaster  qualify  a  character  for  prestige

classes with the following entry requirements.

A caster level requirement, if no type (arcane or divine) is

speci ed.

Ability to cast spells of X level, if no type (arcane or divine)

is speci ed.

Ability to cast mysteries of X level, or a speci c mystery.

Levels in shadowcaster do not qualify a character for prestige

classes with the following entry requirements:

A caster level requirement where the type (arcane or divine)

is speci ed. Exception: Shadowcasters can qualify for the

mystic theurge prestige class (DMG 192). In order to do so,

they are allowed to substitute the ability to cast 2nd-level

mysteries for the ability to cast 2nd-level spells. They must

meet all other requirements for the prestige class normally.

In addition, if a shadowcaster takes cleric levels to meet

the divine spellcasting requirement, he must be devoted

to a god that grants access to one of the following domains:

Knowledge, Magic, Darkness*, or Illusion*.

Domain described in Spell Compendium.

Ability to cast spells of X level where the type (arcane or

divine) is speci ed.

Ability to cast a speci c spell, even if a mystery exists with

a similar effect.

The  same  holds  true  in  reverse.  Other  spellcasters  do  not

qualify  for  prestige  classes  that  require  the  ability  to  cast

mysteries of a given level, or a speci c mystery, even if a spell

exists with a similar effect.

When advancing in a prestige class that states +1 level of

existing  spellcasting  class  or  +1  level  of  existing  casting

class, a mystery user adds those levels to his mystery-casting

class for purposes of gaining new mysteries or fundamentals.

On  the  other  hand,  a  mystery  user  does  not  bene t  from

prestige classes that only add levels to speci c types of spell-

casters. A prestige class that grants +1 level of existing arcane

spellcasting class or +1 level of existing divine spellcasting

class  does  not  increase  the  characters  mysteries  (again,

excepting the mystic theurge under proper conditions).

CHILD OF NIGHT

Watch and read until the coming of  nal nightit will not avail

you. To comprehend the magni cent and empty beauty of darkness,

it is not enough to study shadow; you must become shadow.

Lara Bethend, former Lady of the Second House,

Parliament of Shadows, now renegade

They prefer to call themselves black transmogri sts, but

most know them as children of night. They are more than

spellcasters,  more  than  scholars,  andthey  claimmore

than mortal. For those who have the will and the depth of

knowledge to join their ranks, ascension beyond the earthly

form awaits, for the children of night become the stuff of

shadow itself.

BECOMING A CHILD OF NIGHT

Children  of  night  must  be  tied  to  the  Plane  of  Shadow

through  their  ability  to  perform  magic  involving  dark-

ness. The path of the shadowcaster is the most direct route,

although some wizards, sorcerers, and clerics can progress

into this class. Few bards or druids embark on this journey

of self-transformation.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Knowledge (the planes)

8 ranks

Shadowcasting/Spellcasting: Ability to cast mysteries or

ability to cast spells with the darkness descriptor or from

the shadow subschool

Special: Must have visited the Plane of Shadow

CLASS FEATURES

As you advance as a child of night, your physiology changes,

becoming more shadow and less mortal  esh.

Mysteries/Spellcasting:  At  each  level  beyond  1st,  you

gain  new  mysteries  or  spells  per  day  and  an  increase  in

caster level (and mysteries or spells known, if applicable) as

if you had also attained a level in a casting class to which you

belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not,

however, gain any other bene t a character of that class would

have gained, such as bonus feats for mystery paths known,

or improved familiar for wizard or sorcerer. If you had more

than one casting class before becoming a child of night, you

must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose

of determining mysteries or spells per day, caster level, and

mysteries or spells known.

Cloak of Shadows (Su): Your  esh takes on a hazy, almost

translucent hue, granting a bonus equal to your child of night

117

level on Hide checks. At 4th level, once per day as a swift

action, you can make your outline shadowy and indistinct,

as the blur spell, for a number of minutes equal to your class

level. When you reach 6th level, you can use the blur effect

three  times  per  day.  At  8th  level,  your  form  permanently

becomes hazy and you continually have a blur effect. At 10th

level, two times per day as a swift action, you can make your

true location more dif cult to discern, as if you were affected

by the displacement spell, for 10 rounds.

Cold Resistance (Su): At 1st level, the shadow in your

essence provides cold resistance 5. This resistance increases

to 10 at 5th level and 15 at 9th level.

Sustaining Shadow (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, you lose

various biological needs, as you draw power from the Plane of

Shadow. This functions as the shadowcaster ability described

on page 113, except new abilities are gained at 4th, 6th, and

8th level. If you have the sustaining shadow ability from a

different class (shadowcaster, for example), you automatically

gain the next sustaining shadow ability.

Dancing  Shadows  (Su):  At  3rd  level,  you  can  use  the

dancing shadows mystery as a supernatural ability once per

day with a caster level equal to your class level plus your levels

in any other mystery-casting class. At 7th level and above,

you can use dancing shadows twice per day.

Night Form (Ex): For 1 minute per day, you can become

incorporeal,  and  gain  all  the  bene ts  of  the  incorporeal

subtype.  You  also  gain  a   y  speed  of  40  feet  with  perfect

maneuverability.

PLAYING A CHILD OF NIGHT

You are ascending to something greater than mortality. You

dont necessarily think of mortals as worthlesschildren of

night arent required to be evilbut neither do you think of

yourself as one of them. You remember your companions, and

might remain loyal to them, but your capacity for affection

and similar emotions atrophies. You seem cold or brusque.

Your  primary  motivation  is  to  bond  further  with  shadow,

and you might abandon previously set goals if they con ict

with that objective.

Table 23: The Child of Night

Hit Die: d6

Base

Attack  Fort  Ref  Will

Your  class  is  common  in  several  of  the  organizations

described  later  in  this  section  (see  pages  167174).  The

Nightshade Covenant welcomes you openly, seeing in your

efforts the desire and ambition to become one with the Plane

of Shadow itself.

To  the  Votaries  of  Vecna,  you  represent  the  ultimate

melding of form and shadow, walkers on a path that leads to

something beyond mortal and undead alike. They revere you

if you have joined them, and seek to obliterate you if you do

not, considering you traitors.

Your relations with the Tenebrous Cabal are less predict-

able.  Although  one  might  expect  that  the  Cabal  would

welcome children of night, seeing in them the ultimate in

shadow magic, the truth is that the Cabal isnt certain what

to make of you. You must allow your study of shadow magic

to lapse, or at least slow, during your transformation. This

suggests that your priorities are not in synch with those of

the Cabal. Further, because you represent an interaction with

shadow that the Cabal neither fully understands nor controls,

it views you with some distrust. The Cabal welcomes you into

its ranks, but you are rarely permitted to hold true power, and

no children of night have risen beyond the Third House of

the Parliament.

COMBAT

At  low  levels,  you  are  much  like  other  mystery  users  and

spellcasters. Consider remaining back from the front lines,

harassing foes and supporting allies with your magic. You

might take a more active role against cold-based foes, due to

your burgeoning resistance.

As you advance to 4th level and beyond, your tactics must

evolve with your form. The concealment you enjoy from your

cloak of shadows ability means you can afford to risk closing

on your enemy, enabling you to more effectively deliver touch

and short-range attacks. Your Hide bonus enables you to lay

ambushes, or support the rogue when she moves ahead of

the party.

At  high  levels,  you  hardly  need  worry  about  physical

attacks  at  all  (although  powerful  spellcasters  and  mystic

creatures can still threaten you). When you gain the ability

RESOURCES

The  most  obvious  resource  you  might  gain  from  other

children of night is access to the prestige class in the  rst

place. Texts and tomes of shadow magic are not easily avail-

able, so you must deal with one of the various shadow-magic

organizations to begin your search.

Given the alien nature of shadow magic, and the fact that

you are deliberately attempting to transform yourself into a

creature of darkness, few people trust you. In the long-term,

the  companionship  and  allies  offered  by  the  Votaries  of

Vecna, the Tenebrous Cabal, or other independent children

of night could prove more valuable than any item or riches.

Finally,  organizations  and  smaller  cadres  of  children  of

night often collect ghost touch weapons and force-related

magic. These resources allow them to more effectively battle

corporeal  creatures  without  manifesting,  and  to  protect

themselves from other force effects.

CHILDREN OF NIGHT

IN THE WORLD

Whatever  the  so-called  children  of  the  night  practice,  it  is  not

shadow  magic.  The  purpose  of  shadow  magic  is  to  control  the

darkness, and I am not convinced, that between the children and

the darkness, it is the children who are in control.

Eddas Coradran, Lord of the First House,

Parliament of Shadows

Nothing conveys the alien feel of shadow magic as strongly as the

child of night. Most players should be disturbed by individuals

who are so enraptured with darkness that they willingly make

themselves a part of it. Some might  nd portraying a character

with such alien thoughts to be a roleplaying challenge.

DAILY LIFE

Its dif cult to de ne daily life for children of night. Between

their  scarcity  and  their  ability  to  go  without  fundamental

biological needs, members of the class have few activities in

common. Most children of night spend their time traveling.

They rarely put down roots, for few communities accept them,

and they have little need for shelter at higher levels. Most

seek only to improve their knowledge and experience, so that

they might take the next step in their transformations. Upon

reaching 10th level, some children of night  nd themselves so

uncomfortable in the physical world that they seek to make

new homes on the Plane of Shadow. The remainder usually fall

in with one of the shadow magic organizations, even if they

didnt start as members, simply for a sense of community.

Children  of  night  seldom  acquire  leadership  positions.

The Tenebrous Cabal rarely allows them authority, and few

communities trust children of night even to reside in them,

let alone hold of ce. Only in the Nightshade Covenant, the

Votaries of Vecna, and similar societies is it generally possible

for a child of night to rise above the rank-and- le.

objects.  This  bene t  grants  you  superior  maneuverability

on the battle eld, enabling you to attack almost any foe, or

bolster your companions in almost any situation. You are an

excellent scout, and you can provide hidden backup for your

allies.

ADVANCEMENT

On  rare  occasions,  someone  with  a  strong  af nity  for

shadow feels a call to darkness far beyond that experienced

by other individuals. You might be one of these; you feel

somehow incomplete, hollow. You discover in your studies

the  rst hints of the children, and seek out their secrets,

either through in-depth research or actively  nding one

and  petitioning  his  aid.  Only  in  this  fashion  can  you

learn the ancient rites that instigate the earliest stages of

transformation.

As you progress, you continue your transformation. With

time and practice, your body adapts and becomes more shad-

owy. You continue your practice of magic and can become

quite a potent caster.

You  should  keep  your  Intelligence  and  Charisma  high.

This  not  only  makes  most  effective  use  of  the  magic  you

do have, but Charisma determines your eventual de ection

bonus to AC. Keep your Spellcraft modi er up as well, since

you  are  in  a  unique  positionespecially  once  you  attain

incorporealityto interfere with other casters abilities.

ancient  (former)  elf  who  appears  to  protect  shadow  magi-

cians from those who would condemn them as evil because

of their mystical abilities. Lara Bethend was the youngest

shadowcaster ever to attain rank in the Second House of the

Parliament of Shadows. When her fellow members discovered

she was secretly studying to become a child of night, she slew

several of them, stole valuable tomes, and disappeared. To this

day, she harries operatives of the Cabal. The Parliament has

determined that she had some grudge or agenda against it

even before she joined its ranks, although its members have

yet to determine what it might have been.

ORGANIZATION

The Tenebrous Cabal of cially treats children of night like

other members. Unof cially, they are closely watched, rarely

trusted, and hold little power.

The Votaries and the Covenant are far more welcoming,

seeing in the children of night the beginnings of holiness.

While few children hold high leadership positions, this is due

to their weakened casting abilities compared to shadowcasters

of the same level, rather than any deliberate prejudice. Many

become powerful operatives of the Votaries, however, and

rumor maintains that a secret cadre of child of night assassins

serves at the whim of that organizations leaders.

CHILDREN OF NIGHT IN THE GAME

Children of night are rare, and they tend to be loners. As

such, its easy to introduce them to an ongoing campaign

simply by asserting that the PCs have neither heard of nor

encountered them.

The child of night class is appropriate for players who enjoy

experimenting with the bizarrewith characters who dont

think like normal people. Dont minimize the alien nature

of the class, or have NPCs react in a blas manner during

encounters;  that  ignores  the  uniqueness  of  the  prestige

class. A child of night has less power than a straight caster

of her level, so the DM should make every effort to develop

encounters that take advantage of her maneuverability and

immunities.

ADAPTATION

The  child  of  night  remains  viable  in  campaigns  that  lack

shadow magic. The class might still represent a melding with

the Plane of Shadow, but one that comes from transmutation

or necromantic magic. Alternatively, the child of night might

be an illusion-based prestige class, in which illusionists actu-

ally  transform  themselves  into  living  images.  Finally,  the

children of night might be an unusual form of undead, one

with a slow and voluntary transformative process.

NPC REACTIONS

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Most people react to children of night with hostility, or at

least an unfriendly attitude. Common folk are terri ed of

them, seeing them as dark magicians or inhuman entities.

Adventurers usually assume that, as beings who voluntarily

tie themselves to darkness, they must be evil. The average

person likely  ees at the  rst sign of a child of night, while

braver  folk  seek  to  drive  him  away  or  destroy  him.  Most

shadowcasters are not inherently hostile, but still tend toward

indifference. Only other children of night, and members of

certain shadow organizations, adopt friendly attitudes. They

recognize in one another a kindred spirit, though that doesnt

guarantee friendship or cooperation.

Nearly everyone is an enemy of the children, from paladins

and priests of gods of light, to spellcasters and even some

shadowcasters. The suspicion and loneliness that marks the

life of a child of night prevents all but the most dedicated

from pursuing this course, and often renders those who do

so bitter and hostile.

CHILD OF NIGHT LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge

(the  planes)  can  research  children  of  night  to  learn  more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: The children of night seek to become one with the

Plane of Shadow.

DC 15:  The  children  physically  transform  themselves,

eventually  becoming  incorporeal  beings  of  shadow.  They

retain a measure of casting abilities as well.

DC 20: Even other practitioners of shadow magic distrust

the children of night.

Encounters with children of night should take full advan-

tage of their alien and spectral nature. They are ideal for a

quickly evolving ambush, or a slow build-up of harassment

and attrition by a foe the PCs cannot easily detect or repulse.

Alternatively,  a  child  of  night  might  have  to  go  to  great

lengths to convince the PCs that they should ally against a

greater threat.

EL 8: Sandurel Krie seeks to improve the reputation of

the children of night and make them acceptable in normal

society, or at least among arcane casters. His zealousness to

prove his heroism often causes him to interfere where hes

not wanted, or to mistake powerful characters for forces of

evil.

MASTER OF SHADOW

What need have I of living servants when the shadows themselves

rise up at my command?

Thanielle Tiergun, Duchess of Ohr

Some driven or domineering souls seek nothing less than

mastery  of  darkness  itselfthe  ability  to  turn  the  very

shadows into their agents and allies. These are the masters

of shadow, commanders of soldiers as dark and insubstantial

as night itself. For those with the force of will to enter their

ranks, the very shadows serve at their beck and call.

BECOMING A MASTER OF SHADOW

Shadowcasters are the most common masters of shadow, since

they can most easily enter the class. Sorcerers, wizards, clerics,

and even the occasional druid can multiclass just enough to

CLASS FEATURES

As you progress as a master of shadow, you gain command

of an increasingly powerful dark servant.

Shadow Servant (Su): At 1st level, your shadow familiar

permanently transforms into a Medium shadow elemental. It

loses all familiar traits, but gains new abilities as your shadow

servant (see the Shadow Servant sidebar).

Should  your  shadow  servant  die,  you  can  summon  a

replacement after 24 hours pass. Your shadow servant cannot

travel farther from you than 30 feet + 10 feet for each of your

master of shadow levels (40 feet at 1st level and a maximum

of 130 feet at 10th level). If it is forcibly separated from you

by more than this distance, the servant dissipates instantly,

and you must wait 24 hours to summon a new one.

Masters Bidding (Su): At 1st level, as a standard action,

you can focus your af nity with shadow to enhance your

shadow servant, granting it one special ability for 1 round.

The  special  abilities  available  to  your  shadow  servant  are

described  in  the  Shadow  Servant  sidebar,  and  depend  on

your class level. For example, at 4th level you could give your

servant any of the following special abilities: interact with

corporeal, fast healing 1, extra attack, or cold damage +1d8.

At 5th level, you can grant your shadow servant a special

ability for 1 round by taking only a move action rather than

a standard action.  You can choose to use two move actions

in the same turn to grant it two abilities. Additional move

actions granted by spells, class features, or the like can also

be used to further enhance your shadow servant.

At 10th level, you can grant your shadow servant a special

ability for 1 round by taking only a swift action rather than

a move action. You can still use move actions to give it addi-

tional abilities. Thus, a 10th-level master of shadow who does

nothing else in a round can choose to give his shadow servant

three special abilities (using one swift action and two move

actions).

Resistance to Cold (Su): At 2nd level, the shadow in your

essence provides resistance to cold 5. This resistance increases

to 10 at 4th level and 20 at 6th level. At 10th level, you have

immunity to cold damage.

Mysteries/Spellcasting:  At  2nd  level  and  every  level

thereafter, you gain new mysteries or spells per day and an

increase  in  caster  level  (and  mysteries  or  spells  known,  if

applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a casting class

to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

You do not, however, gain any other bene ts a character of that

class would have gained. If you had more than one casting

class before becoming a master of shadow, you must decide to

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells or mysteries known.

Rapid Shadow (Su): After you reach 10th level, if your

shadow  servant  dies  you  can  summon  a  replacement  10

minutes later.

PLAYING A MASTER OF SHADOW

Most NPC masters of shadow become domineering individu-

als who care little for their former allies as they come to rely

more and more on their dark servant. As a master of shadow

player character (assuming you do not wish to alienate your

companions), you should be careful not to carry this trait

to the extreme. You do become greatly con dentpossibly

SHADOW SERVANT

A  master  of  shadows  servant  is  an  unquestionably  loyal,  de-

voted companion. As the master increases in power, the shadow

servant  also  becomes  tougher,  gaining  Hit  Dice  and  special

abilities. A master of shadow can focus his power and will upon

a servant and make it do his bidding.

Shadow Servant Basics: Use the base statistics for a Medium

shadow elemental as given on page 165, but make the following

changes.

Level: The characters master of shadow level.

Bonus  HD:  Extra  eight-sided  (d8)  Hit  Dice,  each  of  which

gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra

Hit  Dice  improve  the  shadow  servants  base  attack  and  base

save bonuses as appropriate for an elemental. A shadow ser-

vants base attack bonus is the same as that of a cleric or druid

of a level equal to the elementals HD. A shadow servant has

good Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the

elementals HD). A shadow servant gains additional skill points

and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monsters

Hit Dice (MM 290291).

Dex  Adj.:  Add  this  value  to  the  shadow  servants  Dexterity

score.

Resistance  to  Cold  (Ex):  A  shadow  servant  of  a  2nd-level

master of shadow gains resistance to cold 10. When the master

reaches 6th level, the resistance increases to 20.

122

Size  Increase  (Ex):  A  3rd-level  master  of  shadows  servant

grows to Large size. It never increases beyond Large, regardless

of its Hit Dice.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): If its master is 5th level or higher, a

shadow servant can deliver touch mysteries or spells for him. If

the master and the servant are in contact at the time the master

casts a touch mystery or spell, he can designate his servant as

the toucher. The servant can then deliver the touch mystery

or spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts

another mystery or spell before the touch is delivered, the des-

ignated mystery or spell dissipates.

Immunity to Cold (Ex): The servant of a 10th-level master of

shadow has immunity to cold.

MASTERS BIDDING

A master of shadow can shape the essence of his shadow ser-

vant, granting it special abilities and qualities. In this way, the

master customizes his servant to his needs of the moment.

At  first,  enhancing  a  servant  in  this  manner  is  a  standard

action, but higher-level masters eventually reduce the effort to

a move action and finally a swift action. Even when a master of

shadow has the ability to bid his servant to gain multiple abili-

ties, any single ability can only be gained once.

Interact  with  Corporeal  (Su):  When  you  grant  your  shadow

servant this bidding, it can perform simple tasks at your com-

mand, in a manner identical to the unseen servant spell, except

that it retains its own hit points.

Fast Healing (Su): A shadow servant can be bid to regain hit

points at a rate of 1 hit point per round.

Extra Attack (Su): When making a full attack action, a shadow

servant can be bid to make one extra attack. The attack is made

using the creatures full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers

appropriate to the situation.

Cold Damage (Su): A master of shadow can bid its servant to

deal an additional 1d8 points of cold damage on a successful hit

(stacked with the cold damage that shadow elementals normally

deal).

Reach (Su): A shadow servant bid to extend its shadowy arms

in this manner increases its reach by 5 feet.

Damage  Reduction  (Su):  Bidding  your  shadow  servant  to

ignore damage grants it DR 5/.

Speed  (Su):  A  master  of  shadow  can  bid  its  servant  to  be

quick, increasing the servants speed by 20 feet.

even overcon dentin your ability to handle any challenge

or escape any peril, because you have a being of shadow at

your disposal.

You are welcome in the Tenebrous Cabal so long as you do

not succumb to arrogance

or  seek  to  control  your

fellow  members  as  you

do your servants. Surpris-

ingly,  masters  of  shadow

rarely  become  members

of  the  Votaries  of  Vecna

or  the  Nightshade  Cov-

enant. While members of

the  Votaries  are  certainly

convinced  of  their  right

to rule others, they do not

like the idea of sacri cing

their own mystical might

in order to empower their

servants.  Members  of  the

Covenant,  on  the  other

hand, dislike the notion of

mortal beings controlling

creatures of shadow.

COMBAT

Your  shadow  servant  is

your greatest weapon. You

can  direct  it  against  foes

without  putting  yourself

in danger, or have it  ank

an opponent. As you gain

greater power, your servant

increases  in  puissance.

Your  ability  to  use  it  to

deliver touch mysteries or

spells makes it even more

potent at higher levels than

it would otherwise be.

ADVANCEMENT

You tend to discover your own proclivities for manipulating

creatures of darkness, rather than learning from others. This

frequently  occurs  as  you  research  means  of  empowering

your  companion,  or  of  summoning  creatures  of  shadow.

No  speci c  training  or  rites  exist  to  become  a  master  of

shadow. You must simply possess the proper mindset and

the appropriate knowledge.

Continued  advancement  is  emotionally  rewarding  for

those with ambition, because it offers an ever more powerful

servant and increased casting abilities. Youll want to decide

which mysteries or spells to learn in order to make best use

of your servant. For instance, touch attacks are of far greater

value to you than others, since you have a powerful agent

to deliver them. You might not want to bother with other

summoning magic; your servant likely represents more than

enough assistance.

RESOURCES

You tend to view other masters with hostility, seeing them

as  rivals,  although  this  attitude  is  not  universal.  Youll

have  to  gather  resources  on  your  own  or  with  the  aid  of

trusted companions. Try to

MASTERS

OF SHADOW

IN THE WORLD

Keeping  company  with  a

master  of  shadow  is  rather

akin to owning a trained snake.

It might never turn on youit

probably wont turn on you

but you never want to take your

eyes off it.

Irrin Coradran, Lady of

the Second House,

Parliament of Shadows

The master of shadow is the

perfect  prestige  class  for

players who enjoy summon-

ers and similar characters. It

allows  for  the  same  advan-

tages and abilities, without

losing  the  strange  traits  of

shadow magic itself.

DAILY LIFE

Most  masters  of  shadow

prefer a life of luxury. They arent necessarily debauched, but

they swiftly grow accustomed to having things done for them.

Most live in  nery- lled manses or keeps if they can afford

to do so. These complexes tend to be somewhat distant from

nearby people, due to the masters poor reception in most

communities.  When  given  the  option,  masters  of  shadow

prefer to dwell near enough other communities to purchase

what they need, but far enough for privacy.

When they manage to obtain political power, most masters

of shadow tend to be demanding rulers. Already predisposed

toward taking servants for granted, they are convinced of

their  right  to  rule.  Although  not  necessarily  cruel,  they

simply fail to consider the needs of their subjects (a shadow

elemental needs little in the way of care).

province with an iron  st, using their shadow servants as

spies  and  enforcers.  Sanja  Urudin  hires  herself  out  as  a

bodyguard for rich and noble clients, protecting them from a

distance with sentinels of darkness. Finally, Phallon Rheese,

an abnormally  amboyant master of shadow, is well on his

way to becoming a one-man adventuring party.

ORGANIZATION

The Tenebrous Cabal and other organizations treat masters of

shadow like any other memberstheir activities on behalf

of the organization and their mastery of shadow magic deter-

mine their place in the scheme of things. This circumstance

often prevents masters of shadow from obtaining leadership

roles, because their study of shadow magic slows down as they

master their servants. Thus, a small but growing number of

masters feel the Cabal is mistreating them.

Masters  of  shadow  are  often  bitter  rivals  of  children  of

night. The masters feel that the children practice an unholy

or even perverse form of magic, seeking to become what they

should instead rule. The children in turn believe that the

masters seek to control them, along with all other beings of

shadow.

NPC REACTIONS

NPC  reactions  to  masters  of  shadow  depend  on  the  com-

munity. In most cases, people are unfriendly or hostile when

they see someone commanding beings of darkness. In a few

instances, however, certain individualsparticularly in high-

magic communitiesinstead treat masters of shadow in a

friendly or helpful manner, seeing in them an ability to keep

evil away from others. Most shadowcasters are indifferent to

masters of shadow, respecting their abilities but somewhat

distrustful of their motives. Children of night are usually

unfriendly at best.

MASTER OF SHADOW LORE

Characters with the bardic knowledge ability or with ranks

in  Knowledge  (arcana)  or  Knowledge  (the  planes)  can

research masters of shadow to learn more about them. When

a character makes a check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Masters of shadow command a servant made of

darkness itself.

DC 15: The masters are potent magic users, and they gain

the ability to channel some of their magics through their

shadow servants. The more powerful the master, the more

powerful his servant.

DC 20:  Most  masters  of  shadow  require  some  time  to

replace a servant that is lost, though they do not suffer as

does a wizard losing her familiar.

MASTERS OF SHADOW

IN THE GAME

Masters of shadow are manipulators, preferring to remain be-

hind the scenes. Its entirely possible that the PCs have heard

of or even encountered individuals who are masters of shadow,

but who hid that fact from them. Alternatively, the prestige

class might be new in your campaign, the result of a shadow-

caster attempting to empower a shadow companion.

Anyone who enjoys commanding another combatant in a

 ght, or using a servant to scout, should enjoy the master of

shadow class. While its reasonable to assume that some in-

dividuals have taken precautions against these abilities, and

that a shadow servant might not be at its best in all  ghts,

the class should prove worthwhile so long as you do not go

out of your way to reduce its effectiveness.

ADAPTATION

The master of shadow works well with an elemental theme.

Simply  replace  the  shadow  servant  with  an  elemental  of

comparable CR, and the servant and masters bidding abili-

ties with those suited to elemental creatures of the proper

subtype.  For  instance,  an  earth  elemental  creature  would

gain Constitution instead of Dexterity, have good Fortitude

but poor Re ex saves, and perhaps gain resistance to acid

instead of cold.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Encounters with masters of shadow should take full advan-

tage  of  their  servant.  Perhaps  the  PCs  believe  they  have

cornered their enemy alone, only to learn that she is never

foe are in an area of darkness or shadowy illumination.

While in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or that

caused by a daylight spell), shadow elementals take a 4

penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls.

NOCTUMANCER

Consider the power offered by magic, by the ability to manipulate

reality. Imagine how much greater, then, the power available to he

who can manipulate magic itself.

Eveneth Stillwater, Lord of the Third House,

Parliament of Shadows

Noctumancers bridge the gap between shadow and arcane

magic. Those who succeed in becoming one of these elite

not only gain a boost to their mystery user and arcane caster

abilities, but are able to manipulate the mysteries and spells

of others as no others can.

BECOMING A NOCTUMANCER

Given  the  requirements  of  the  class,  multiclass  shadow-

caster/sorcerers and shadowcaster/wizards make up almost

the entirety of noctumancers. The rare shadowcaster/bard

might be found, but virtually no other combination offers

the proper abilities, and given the steep requirements of the

prestige class, any additional multiclassing drastically slows

(or even prevents) its acquisition.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks

Shadowcasting: Able to cast 2nd-level mysteries

Spellcasting: Able to cast 2nd-level arcane spells

CLASS FEATURES

As a noctumancer, you excel at controlling all magics in the

area around you.

Mysteries/Spellcasting:  At  each  level,  you  gain  new

mysteries or spells per day and an increase in caster level

(and mysteries or spells known, if applicable) as if you had

also gained a level in both your mystery-using class and your

arcane spellcasting class. You do not, however, gain any other

bene ts a character of these classes would have gained. If you

had more than one mystery-using or arcane spellcasting class

before becoming a noctumancer, you must decide to which

class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells

per day, caster level, and spells known.

Capture Magics Shadow (Su): At 1st level, when you suc-

cessfully dispel a mystery or spell (such as with the mysteries

shadows fade or unravel dweomer, or the spells dispel magic or

break enchantment), you can absorb its energy. You add one-half

the level (round down, minimum 1) of the mystery or spell

you dispelled to the caster level of any mystery or spell you

cast in the next round. For instance, if you dispel a 4th-level

spell, you add +2 to the caster level of the spell you cast in

the next round. You cannot draw power from dispelling your

own mysteries or spells.

Innate Counterspell (Su): Starting at 2nd level, you can

attempt to counter a mystery or spell without using a readied

action. Once per day, you can counter a spell as an immediate

action, by expending a mystery use per day, a spell slot (if you

prepare spells), or a spell use (if you are a spontaneous caster)

as long as the mystery or spell expended is of the same level

or higher as the mystery or spell to be countered.

125

At 7th level, when you successfully counter a mystery or

spell using this ability, you retain some of the magical essence

of the countered dweomer. You can choose to either gain one

additional use of a mystery, regain an expended spell slot (if

you prepare spells), or gain the use of an additional spell (if

you are a spontaneous caster). The level of the mystery or

spell you gain is equal to one-half the level of the mystery or

spell you countered (rounded down, minimum 1).

You can use innate counterspell once per day at 2nd level,

two times at 5th, and three times at 8th.

Eldritch  Disruption  (Su):  At  6th  level,  you  can  use  a

standard action to disrupt the magical energies of a single

target within 60 feet. That target must make a Will saving

throw (DC 10 + your noctumancer level + your Cha modi er)

or take a 4 penalty to its caster level for any mysteries or

spells it casts for 1 minute. You can use eldritch disruption

three times per day.

Eldritch Vortex (Su): At 10th level, you can emit mystic

energies  in  a  20-foot-radius  burst  around  yourself.  Any

creature other than you within that area takes a 4 penalty

to caster level for any mysteries, spells, or spell-like abilities

it casts or uses. The vortex lasts 1 minute and can be used

once per day.

Shadows  Persistence  (Su):  At  10th  level,  you  gain

temporary  immunity  to  any  mystery  or  spell  captured  or

countered by means of your capture magics shadow or innate

counterspell ability. For 1 minute, you cannot be affected by

any casting of that mystery or spell.

PLAYING A NOCTUMANCER

You are a rising master of two forms of magic, able to shape

substance, shadow, and sorcery at your whim. You are most

likely studious and knowledgeable, although some noctu-

Table 25: The Noctumancer

Hit Die: d4

mancers come by their abilities more instinctively. While

you might never reach the same heights of magical ability as

your single-classed contemporaries, your mastery of magic as

a whole makes you at least their equal, if not their better.

Every  major  shadow-based  organization  has  a  place

for  noctumancers.  The  Tenebrous  Cabal  and  Nightshade

Covenant  treat  you  much  like  standard  shadowcasters,

determining your position by your overall mystical aptitude.

The Votaries of Vecna venerate you, for you combine shadow

powers with the arts practiced by Acererak and (before his

divinity) Vecna himself. Also, despite the common distrust

of shadow magic in arcane organizations, some such guilds

might welcome you, fascinated by your ability to manipulate

others magic.

COMBAT

At lower levels, your combat techniques do not greatly differ

from those of other arcane casters. You should normally stay

out of immediate physical danger, using your spells to in u-

ence the  ow of battle.

As you progress, however, your options grow wider. Your

ability to absorb magic even as you dispel it makes it even

more  worthwhile  than  normal  to  strip  your  foes  of  their

mystical protections or to remove ongoing baneful effects

from your allies. Your innate counterspell ability gives you

a powerful defense against enemy casters, and your tactical

options grow as you gain the ability to shape your spells and

mysteries around your allies.

At your highest level, you might wish to focus most of

your  efforts  in  combating  enemy  casters  or  magic-using

creatures,  for  you  now  have  the  ability  to  render  at  least

some of their efforts useless. This frees your companions

from having to defend against them, allowing them to go

on the offensive.

ADVANCEMENT

Your arts are at least partially learned ones, even

for the most spontaneous sorcerer. You are likely

a  member  of  a  shadow-related  organization,

approached  and  trained  by  noctumancers

who  saw  potential  in  your  combination  of

abilities. Alternatively, you might have sought

out instructors, having heard of noctumancy.

Although such individuals are rare, you might

have  been  a  multiclass  shadowcaster/arcane

caster,  discovered  the  secrets  of  the  noctu-

mancer  in  ancient  tomes,  and  managed  to

train yourself.

Continued advancement requires substan-

tial practice and study, equal to if not greater

than that required of a shadowcaster or wizard.

While you need not (and in fact cannot) learn

the  most  dif cult  spells  or  mysteries,  you

possess techniques for combining these very

different forms of magic.

Once you become a noctumancer, you face

the same choices as high-level mystery users

and  spellcasters,  only  even  more  of  them.

Pay careful attention to the synergy between

your spells and mysteries, so that you do not

wind  up  with  redundant  abilities.  Consider

mastering the path of Black Magic, because

its mysteries complement your class abilities.

Raising  both  Intelligence  and  Charisma  is

clearly a wise idea, and feats and items to raise

your caster level also prove valuable.

RESOURCES

Unless  another  noctumancer  belongs  to  a

rival organization, you tend to view him as a

kindred soul in an elite society. You frequently

trade spells and minor items (potions, scrolls,

wands).  Youll  likely  want  staffs,  defensive

items,  and  items  to  boost  Intelligence  and

Charismamuch like any other caster.

NOCTUMANCERS

IN THE WORLD

My magic is everything I have, everything I am.

If someone else can wrest control of my magic from

me, what does that make me?

Hennet, sorcerer and adventurer

A  noctumancer  is  the  logical  extension  of

abjuration magic, the path of Black Magic,

and  even  the  existence  of  arcane  magic  in

general.  It  seems  only  natural  that  some

would devote their efforts to mastering not

the  use  of  magic,  but  the  literal  control  of

it. It should appeal to players who enjoy the

notion of manipulating the forces that many

others take for granted.

Eveneth Stillwater, an elf noctumancer

DAILY LIFE

A  noctumancers  time  is  largely  devoted  to  the  study  and

research required to master new mysteries, new spells, and

the interactions between them. Noctumancers usually devote

their remaining time either to advancing the goals of their

organization, or adventuring to obtain both new magic and

expertise with their abilities.

Noctumancers  rarely  have  the  time  for  governing,  but

those who do take full advantage of their abilities, either to

protect or dominate their subjects. Even the most well-mean-

ing noctumancer rulers often grow arrogant, as they become

convinced of their mastery of eldritch forces.

NOTABLES

Noctumancers  are  exceptionally  rare,  but  a  few  have  still

managed to obtain notoriety. Eveneth Stillwater, Lord of the

Third House, is the most recent addition to the Parliament

of  Shadows,  and  one  of  only  a  half-dozen  noctumancers

in  the  Cabals  ruling  body.  The  shadow  lich  known  only

as Intempestus leads a cadre of Nightshaders who lair in a

shadowstuff castle on the Plane of Shadow, near a permanent

portal to the Material Plane.

ORGANIZATION

Noctumancers function more or less as other mystery users

and spellcasters in their respective organizations. The Votaries

of Vecna might honor their abilities, but they dont actually

bestow  any  true  authority  that  the  noctumancers  havent

otherwise earned. Similarly, the Nightshade Covenant and the

Tenebrous Cabal respect the noctumancers knowledge, and

often put such individuals in charge of mystical research and

interactions with other arcane factions, but they are treated

just like any other members when it comes to advancement.

NPC REACTIONS

The vast majority of people react to noctumancers exactly as

they would to an arcane caster or shadowcaster, whichever the

noctumancer most resembles. Only a very select fewmostly

casters  themselvesrecognize  the  noctumancer  as  some-

thing different. In general, shadowcasters are indifferent or

friendly (if they are of the same organization) to noctumanc-

ers. Many arcane casters are hostile toward noctumancers,

for they fear their ability to manipulate others spells.

NOCTUMANCER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

noctumancers to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: The noctumancer is a spellcaster who combines

arcane magic and shadow magic.

DC 15: Noctumancers have the ability to use spells and the

powers of shadow, and can also hinder the magic of others.

They can counter spells with an act of will.

DC 20:  The  noctumancers  abilities,  such  as  spells  and

mysteries, are limited by the number of times they can use

them. You can sometimes overpower a noctumancer through

simple attrition.

A bardic knowledge check or a Gather Information check

can reveal the same information as these Knowledge checks,

but in each case the DC is 5 higher than the given value.

NOCTUMANCERS IN THE GAME

Noctumancy is not only a dif cult art, it requires a relatively

high level before one can enter the prestige class. Thus, its

unlikely that characters in a low-level or even mid-level game

will encounter noctumancers, allowing DMs to introduce

one or more as the campaign progresses, without having to

explain their prior absence.

Players should think that their characters levels in noc-

tumancer are worthwhile so long as they have semifrequent

encounters with magic users or ongoing spell effects. The

prestige class allows them to progress in both classes, so they

will not be particularly weak in any case, but it is against other

casters that the noctumancer truly comes into his own.

ADAPTATION

A noctumancer can exist in settings that do not make use

of shadow magic, although it requires some alteration. The

prestige  class  might  instead  represent  a  branch  of  arcane

magic focused on controlling the magic of others. Remove

the shadowcaster-related prerequisites.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Encounters  with  noctumancers  should  focus  heavily  on

their strange mystical abilities. While a noctumancer can

certainly  prove  a  hefty  challenge  simply  by  hurling  both

mysteries and spells, they are most fearsome when used to

counter the casters in the opposing party.

EL 15: Eveneth Stillwater, newly appointed Lord of the

Third House in the Parliament of Shadows, spends much

time in the  eld for the organization. He is still adapting

to his new position, and sometimes proves a bit overzealous

in his efforts to prove himself to the Cabal.

CLASS FEATURES

Shadowblades are martial combatants with an innate link to

shadow. While some deliberately study the arts of shadow,

most  develop  their  abilities  instinctively,  making  them

more akin to shadowdancers than shadowcasters. Those who

master the arts of the unseen weapon become warriors with

few equals. Their ability to manipulate darkness and shadow

enhances their martial skills, allowing them to target weak

points, land blows that should not strike true, and even attack

foes who are paces away.

BECOMING A SHADOWBLADE

Multiclass   ghter/rogues  are  the  most  common  shadow-

blades,  because  they  possess  both  the  martial  ability  and

the  skills  necessary.  Single-classed   ghters  or  rogues  can

enter the class, but it takes longer. A rare few paladins and

rangers take this path, enhancing their own abilities with a

mastery of shadow. Few mystery users or spellcasters become

shadowblades, and barbarians tend to prefer brute force and

distrust a shadowblades powers.

Shadowblades manipulate shadow to strike swiftly and fatally,

becoming the ultimate combination of skilled soldier and

brutal slayer.

Unseen Weapon (Su): As a standard action, you can wrap

any melee weapon you wield in a layer of shifting shadows.

This causes the weapon to darken, become less distinct, and

leave a trail of shadow behind it as it moves. Your weapon

must be in hand and ready to use for you to draw upon this

power. You can dismiss the effect with a free action; dropping

or sheathing the weapon also ends the effect.

Once per day per shadowblade level, you can activate one

of the powers of your unseen weapon as a swift action. At

1st level, you have the power to make an unerring strike (see

below). As you gain levels in the class, you acquire additional

choices when activating your unseen weapon, as indicated on

Table 26. When you activate your unseen weapon, choose

one of the available abilities. Multiple uses of the same ability

do not stack on a single attack.

Unerring Strike: Your next melee attack ignores any miss

chance because of concealment or total concealment. You

gain this choice at 1st level.

129

Unexpected Strike: Your opponent is denied its Dexterity

bonus against your next melee attack. You gain this ability

at 3rd level.

Ephemeral Weapon: Your next melee attack deals an extra

2d6 points of damage, as extraplanar darkness momentarily

replaces  portions  of  your  opponents  body.  You  gain  this

choice at 5th level.

Shadowy  Strike:  Your  next  melee  attack  is  resolved  as  a

melee touch attack, ignoring armor and natural armor. You

gain this ability at 7th level.

Far Shadow: Your melee reach is increased by 10 feet for 1

round. You gain this choice at 9th level.

At 10th level, you can use your unseen weapon abilities as

a free action, though you are still limited to one use per day

per class level.

Shadow and Stealth (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, the

shadows that engulf your unseen weapon cover you as well,

granting you a circumstance bonus equal to half your class

level (round down) on Hide and Move Silently checks.

Sudden Strike (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, if you can

catch  an  opponent  when  she  is  unable  to  defend  herself

effectively from your attack, you can strike a vital spot for

extra damage. Whenever your target is denied a dexterity

bonus  to  Armor  Class  (whether  the  target  actually  has  a

Dexterity  bonus  or  not),  you  deal  an  extra  1d6  points  of

damage with your attack. This extra damage increases by

1d6 for every two levels thereafter. You cant use sudden

strike  when   anking  an  opponent  unless  that  opponent

is  denied  its  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC.  Ranged  attacks  can

count as sudden strike attacks only if the target is within

30 feet.

Sudden strike functions identically to sneak attack in all

other respects. The extra damage from sudden strike stacks

with  the  extra  damage  from  sneak  attack  whenever  both

would apply to the same target. It also stacks with the ephem-

eral weapon ability of the unseen weapon class feature.

Shadow Vision (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, you are able

to see clearly in shadowy illumination. Thus, you can see

up to 40 feet clearly in the illumination provided by a torch

(which gives off bright illumination in a 20-foot radius and

shadowy illumination for 40 feet beyond that), or twice that

if you have low-light vision.

See in Darkness (Su): At 7th level, you can see perfectly

in darkness of any kind, even that created by a deeper darkness

spell.

PLAYING A SHADOWBLADE

You are a soldier who has learned the bene ts of stealth and

the power of darkness. You are not necessarily evil, but you

are certainly violent and skilled in combat and killing. Your

attitude toward mystery users might vary. If you deliberately

set out to learn your skills, you likely belong to one of their

organizations, but if you developed them instinctively, its

an even bet whether you consider them comrades or harbor

a deep mistrust.

Although  shadowblades  exist  in  most  shadow-related

organizations, they are not speci cally associated with such

groups. Many are independent operatives, mercenaries, or

adventurers. In fact, many are hired speci cally to combat

shadowcasters, because the abilities of the class help shad-

owblades overcome a shadowcasters typical defenses.

COMBAT

You  employ  almost  equal  amounts  of  stealth  and  brute

force.  You  can  work  primarily  as  a  front-line   ghter,  but

your prowess in sneaking and surprise make you a better

guerrilla  and   nesse   ghter.  As  your  abilities  of  stealth

improve, you become a viable scout, although your need to

keep your weapon unsheathed might occasionally interfere

with remaining unnoticed.

At higher levels, you can deliver surprise attacks from a

short distance away, and even cut through the defenses of

heavily  armed  foes.  Combined  with  your  ever-increasing

stealth, this enables you to  ll in for either the rogue or the

 ghter, and even to make surgical strikes against foes that

might be too tough for the rogue or other scout to handle.

ADVANCEMENT

You might have actively joined a shadow-related organization

to learn your abilities. You might have been approached by an

experienced shadowblade or shadowcaster attracted by your

skills and prowess, or by those that would use you as a tool

against other shadow-based groups. Most likely, however, you

developed your abilities on your own, discovering an ability

to manipulate shadow after exposure to it.

Continued training is not unlike that of other soldiers.

You drill in weapons and techniques of stealth, supplement-

ing  them  with  meditative  techniques  and,  in  some  cases,

occasional forays to the Plane of Shadow.

As you advance, youll need to decide how much weight

to  give  your  martial  abilities,  and  how  much  your  stealth

abilities and your Bluff modi er. Are you a  ghter who makes

use of sneaky tactics, or a silent killer who can hold his own

in battle?

RESOURCES

If youre part of an organization, the group might supply you

with some basic equipment, but rarely much in the way of

magic items; youll need to acquire those on your own. Items

that enhance Strength and Dexterity are important, as are

those that improve your ability to sneak, and thus deliver

your  special  attacks.  Items  that  enhance  Listen  and  Spot,

or that warn you of oncoming danger, are helpful because

your stealth abilities do not aid you in detecting others with

similar capabilities.

SHADOWBLADES IN THE WORLD

When the baron heard a shadowblade was coming for him, he

tripled the number of guardsmen on duty that night. You know what

it accomplished? Three times as many guardsmen died tired.

Gimble, gnome bard and traveling storyteller

The shadowblade class allows the DM to introduce shadow

magic into the campaign without excluding the heavy  ghters

and to grant even the armor-clad warriors in the PC group

some capability at stealth.

130

DAILY LIFE

Shadowblades live much like other professional warriors.

They practice and train, pursuing their own interests in the

few free hours they have. They meditate on their abilities,

making them appear more like ascetic or religious warriors

(such as paladins) than standard soldiers, although none of

their abilities are inherently religious. They  ll many of the

same niches as other  ghters: guards, soldiers, mercenaries,

hired  killers,  and,  of  course,  adventurers.  Shadowblades

tend to be nocturnal, due to their growing connection with

shadow, and many  nd themselves shunned in communities

that do not understand their abilities.

NOTABLES

Only  a  few  shadowblades  have  attained  any  notoriety,

including Niko Drendol, leader of the merciless pirates of

the Black Dawn; Jassra Orun, who adventures with multiple

companies in her quest to learn more of the Material Plane;

and  Murrim  Khaleed,  a  death  knight  in  service  to  the

Votaries of Vecna.

ORGANIZATION

As mentioned above, shadowblades are not associated with

any  speci c  organization.  When  they  do  belong  to  such,

they rarely advance far in the hierarchy, since they lack the

mystical abilities that most of these organizations revere.

NPC REACTIONS

Most common folk think of the shadowblades as a martial

order,  mistaking  them  for  a  united  faction  or  a  religious

institution.  On  an  individual  basis,  most  people  react  to

shadowblades  with  the  same  attitudes  they  would  direct

toward any professional soldier. Should a shadowblade make

substantial and open use of his shadow-related abilities, this

attitude might worsen, as people begin to think of him as a

sneak-thief, assassin, or soldier of darkness. They try not to

draw the shadowblades ire, but instead do their best to hurry

him about his business so that he might depart all the sooner.

Mystery users and spellcasters recognize shadowblades for

what  they  are.  The  attitude  of  such  a  character  depends

entirely on whether the shadowblade in question is a member

of a friendly, neutral, or rival faction to the casters own.

SHADOWBLADE LORE

Characters  with  the  bardic  knowledge  ability  or  ranks  in

Knowledge  (arcana)  can  research  shadowblades  to  learn

more about them. When a character makes a check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: Shadowblades are warriors who incorporate shadow

and stealth into their combat techniques.

DC 15: Shadowblades are capable of masking their weap-

ons and themselves in shadow, granting them supernatural

powers, such as the ability to strike protected targets or to

attack from a distance.

DC 20: Many of the shadowblades abilities are not func-

tional against nonliving foes, such as undead or constructs.

If you can cause them to drop or change their weapons, it

Niko Drendol, a human shadowblade

takes a moment for them to reactivate their powers, offering

a brief window of opportunity.

SHADOWBLADES IN THE GAME

Shadowblades are scattered throughout many organizations,

guilds, and adventuring parties. When introducing them to

an ongoing campaign, its reasonable to simply assume that

the PCs have never before encountered one. Alternatively,

perhaps one of the PCs is the  rst person in the region to

develop these abilities.

This prestige class makes a good choice for anyone who

wants to play a warrior with a stealthy or mystical bent. So

long  as  the  DM  does  not  restrict  encounters  to  creatures

immune to his abilities, and gives him the occasional chance

to scout ahead, to take out an enemy leader, or otherwise to

make use of his less direct forms of confrontation, the player

should feel his efforts worthwhile.

ADAPTATION

Shadowblades do not have to be associated with shadow. Per-

haps they are an order of killers for hire, who cloak themselves

and  their  weapons  in  illusion  and  invisibility.  Then  again,

they might truly be members of a religious order, their power

obtained through faith in a deity of darkness or deception.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

While  shadowblades  can  stand  toe  to  toe  with  other  war-

riors, encounters with them should take advantage of their

other  abilities.  Let  the  PCs  wonder  how  the  large  man  in

full plate snuck into their camp, or how to defeat a soldier

who seems constantly able to distract them and then strike

where theyre weakest.

EL 11: Niko Drendol is the leader of the pirates of the Black

Dawn, a ship that is said to be able to breach the boundaries

of the planes to sail swiftly across black seas on the Plane

of Shadow. Drendol often travels with a quartet of human

rogue/ ghters  who  serve  as  her  messengers  and  personal

guard. A foe of the PCs might hire Drendol, she might be

after the same goal they are, or she might develop a rivalry

with them while  ghting on the same side in a con ict.

of  shadow  command  it,  but  no  one  truly  manipulates  the

drakness as does the shadowsmith. Combining martial and

mystical skills, and possessed of a driving will, the shadow-

smith forms his tools and weapons from shadowstuff itself,

drawing forth matter from empty night.

BECOMING A SHADOWSMITH

Almost anyone can become a shadowsmith under the proper

circumstances. Rangers, paladins, and clerics are most likely

to meet the requirements  rst, though some rogues follow

this path as well. Although they could have the proper skills,

few mystery users or spellcasters pursue this class, since its

casting progression is far slower than their own.

CLASS FEATURES

Your abilities allow you to create tools and weapons out of

darkness itself.

Weapon  and  Armor  Pro  ciency:  You  are  pro cient

with simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with

shields (except tower shields).

Mysteries Known: You have the ability to cast a small

number of mysteries. To cast a mystery, you must have an

Intelligence score of at least 10 + the mystery level, so if you

have an Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast mysteries.

High ability scores do not provide bonus mysteries. Saving

throws against your mysteries have a DC of 10 + mystery level

+ your Int modi er.

Your selection of mysteries is extremely limited. You begin

in this class knowing only a single 1st-level mystery. Every

four levels thereafter (at 5th and 9th), you gain an additional

mystery known. As with the shadowcaster class, you may not

skip ahead in a given path. Your mysteries must all be drawn

from  an  apprentice  path,  and  you  cast  them  all  as  arcane

spells. You can use each mystery you know once per day. You

do not gain fundamentals.

Touch of Shadow (Su): At 1st level, your ability to manipu-

late  shadow  is  undeveloped.  You  cannot  yet  create  actual

items, but you can surround your hands and feet in a layer

of shadow. This ability grants you a bonus on Climb checks

equal to your class level. Further, it distributes your weight

more evenly, so you cannot be tracked. Touch of shadow lasts

for 1 minute per class level and is usable a number of times

per day equal to your class level.

Shroud of Shadow (Su): Starting at 2nd level, you can sur-

round your body in a thin layer of shadow. You gain a bonus

on Hide checks and Move Silently checks equal to your class

level. Shroud of shadow lasts for 1 minute per class level and

is usable a number of times per day equal to your class level.

Shadow Craft (Su): As of 3rd level, you can create small

items,  such  as  tools  or  weapons,  from  shadow.  You  need

merely place your hands into any shadow and draw forth the

desired item. It cannot possess moving or  exible parts, so

you could not create a crossbow, a rope, a  ail, or a cabinet.

You can create nearly any other weapon, simple tool, or small

item, however.

You can create one item weighing a number of pounds up

to twice your class level, or two items whose combined weight

does not exceed that limit. Using shadow craft is a standard

action. If the item leaves your possession, it fades away in 1d4

rounds. Otherwise, it lasts for 1 hour per class level. Shadow

craft is usable a number of times per day equal to one-half

your  class  level.  Items  created  by  shadow  craft  cannot  be

employed as material components or foci in spellcasting. If

you want to create an item that mimics a speci c item you

have seen, you must succeed on a DC 20 Craft check of the

appropriate sort (weaponsmithing, for instance).

At 6th level, you can enhance your creations. You can

imbue a shadow-crafted weapon or shield with an enhance-

ment bonus equal to your class level minus 5. For instance,

if you are an 8th-level shadowsmith, you can create a +3

battle axe. If you create two enhanced items at one time (which

becomes possible when you attain 7th level), you must divide

the total enhancement bonus between those items. (For

instance, at 8th level, you could create a +1 battleaxe and a +2

large shield.)

To succeed at this enhanced crafting, you must make an

appropriate Craft check for each item (usually weaponsmith-

ing  or  armorsmithing)  against  a  DC of  20  +  the  desired

enhancement bonus. If you fail, the item is nonmagical. You

can only have one enhanced shadow-crafted item (or two, if

they were created in the same round) at a time. If you create

new  enhanced  items,  the  old  ones  immediately  become

nonmagical. Attempting to create an enhanced item (or two,

if so desired) with shadow craft is a full-round action.

At 8th level, you can use shadow craft to create light armor

for yourself (which you can give an enhancement bonus to).

The armor you craft automatically has the improved shadow

special ability (DMG 219).

At 9th level, you can quicken your shadow crafting. You

need only a standard action to create enhanced items and

only a swift action to create nonmagical ones.

At 10th level, you can apply the shadow striking ability (see

page 155) to any magic weapon you create through shadow

craft. (If you create two weapons at once, only one can be

shadow striking.) Further, you do not need to craft the item

on the Plane of Shadow as is normally the case with shadow

striking weapons.

Armor of Shadow (Su): Starting at 4th level, you can take

a standard action to surround yourself in hardened shadow.

This ability grants you a +2 de ection bonus to AC. Armor

of shadow lasts for 10 minutes per class level, and is usable a

number of times per day equal to one-half your class level.

At 7th level, the de ection bonus increases to +4.

At 10th level, you quicken your armor of shadow, activating

it as a swift action.

Widen Shroud (Su): Starting at 5th level, you can widen

your touch of shadow ability to include a number of compan-

ions equal to one-half your class level. If they move more than

10 feet from you, the effect ends for them; coming closer to

you again does not restore it. Widen shroud lasts for 1 minute

per class level; each use counts as a daily use of your touch of

shadow ability.

PLAYING A SHADOWSMITH

You are self-reliant and skillful, a master of craft and combat.

You do not necessarily devote your life to shadow, instead

seeing it as a tool and a weapon. While you must be at least

somewhat learned to have developed your abilities, you are

more interested in actions than words.

While the various shadow-based organizations all welcome

shadowsmiths,  nding their abilities useful and fascinating,

none permit their kind to advance far in the ranks. Shadow-

133

smiths lack the mystical abilities required for advancement

in the Tenebrous Cabal, and they rarely have suf cient power

to force their way into the upper echelons of the Votaries

or the Nightshade Covenant. Like the shadowblades, they

often occupy guard and support positions, although some

have made names as  eld operatives and even assassins for

the various factions.

COMBAT

Shadowsmiths do not have a universal  ghting style.

Rather, you are likely to stick with whatever tactics

served  you  best  in  your  prior  classfront-line

battle for  ghters, sneak attacks for rogues, and

so  onsupplemented  by  your  new  abilities.

The  stealth  boost  provided  by  your  low-level

abilities  is  particularly  useful  for  rogues  and

mobile   ghters,  while  your  ability  to  create

almost  any  equipment  you  need  means

you  can  arm  yourself  as  appropriate  for

whatevers coming.

ADVANCEMENT

Most  shadowsmiths  learn  from  other  shad-

owsmiths,  either  having  sought  out,  or  been

approached  by,  a  potential  mentor.

Some teach themselves, having re-

searched  the  secrets  of  the  art.  A

rare few develop their abili-

ties spontaneously.

Training  in  the  shadow-

smiths art is a strange combination

of  lessons  and  endeavors.  While

meditative  techniques  and  mental

exercises are essential to the contin-

ued evolution of your mystical abilities

and  mysteries,  you  must  also  study  to

become an expert artisan in your  eld. While you spend far

less time poring over old tomes than shadowcasters, prefer-

ring to occupy forges and workshops, you spend no less time

in long, arduous practice.

Advancing  shadowsmiths  should  focus  on  Strength  or

Dexteritywhichever  most  bene ts  your  preferred  com-

bat stylebut also on Intelligence. Your skills, particularly

Craft, affect how well you can take advantage of your various

abilities. You only know a few mysteries, and can use each

only once per day, so select those that best complement your

other abilities.

Lozruet, a drow shadowsmith

them,  for  they  are  true  experts  at  what  they  do,  and  physically

manipulate shadow in ways even the best of us cannot.

Eddas Coradran, Lord of the First House,

Parliament of Shadows

Along with the shadowblade, the shadowsmith allows even

players uninterested in portraying casters to take advantage of

the material presented in this chapter. While the shadowblade

is a heavy  ghter, however, the shadowsmith is the perfect

choice for lighter warriors, rangers, and rogues. Their

shadow craft ability makes shadowsmiths exceptionally

self-suf cient,  and  their  capacity  for  stealth  is  almost

unequaled.

DAILY LIFE

Most  shadowsmiths  are  either  warriors  for  hire,

adventurers,  or  actual  craftsmen  with  a  mystical

bent.  While  their  abilities  clearly  mark  them  as

something other than their compatriots, they do

not stand out to the same degree that other mystery

users  do.  Thus,  although  shadowsmiths  spend

more time in study and practice, their lives

differ  only  marginally  from  those

members of the classes from which

they come.

Few shadowsmiths aspire

to  positions  of  author-

ity; as a group, they are

more  focused  on  their

crafting.  Those  who  do

manage to obtain power

tend to be community or

military  leaders,  and  rarely

rule  more  than  small  villages  or

provinces in the name of a greater lord.

NOTABLES

Few shadowsmiths have become famous. Those who have

include Hrogar Ilgenson, famed warrior and lieutenant on

the coastal raiding vessel Fourth Dragon, and Lozruet, a drow

who uses her abilities to hunt famous adventurers.

ORGANIZATION

While  shadowsmiths  rarely  rise  high  in  the  larger  shadow-

focused organizations, they have formed a few of their own.

Some of thesesuch as the Guild of Nocturnal Efforts, the

largest knownhold a reasonable degree of political sway in

the cities that house them. In these organizations, shadowsmiths

make up the entirety of the power structure, if not the whole of

the faction itself. Even the guild, however, is far smaller and less

in uential than the organizations presented herein.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people respond to a shadowsmith as they would to any

member of her apparent class. If they happen to learn of the

shadowsmiths  abilities,  their  reactions  change  based  on

their view of magic in general. People might be a bit more

suspicious of a shadowsmith (attitude one category worse) if

RESOURCES

You rarely obtain anything from other shadowsmiths except

training. Organizations to which you belong might offer raw

materials for your standard crafting skills, but will expect

you to create items for them in exchange.

they are of a particularly religious bent, or if they interpret

her manipulation of shadow as a sign of evil. In most cases,

however, the shadowsmiths abilities pass as just another form

of magic, since they arent as overtly strange as those of other

shadow magicians. The exception to this general rule is the

shadowsmith who uses her mysteries, as opposed to her other

abilities, regularly and in full view of common folk. The alien

nature of shadow magic makes these shadowsmiths stand out

more than their more subtle counterparts.

EL 14: During a battle with invaders of her city, Lozruet

was magically transported to the Plane of Shadow. There she

met and made an alliance with members of the Nightshade

Covenant, learning the ways of the shadowsmith from them.

Lozruet acts as an assassin for the Nightshade Covenant and

for her own bene t. The PCs might come into con ict with

her  as  she  completes  a  mission  on  the  Material  Plane,  or

she might seek them out if they make enemies among the

Nightshaders.

SHADOWSMITH LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

shadowsmiths to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Shadowsmiths can create items out of nothingness.

DC 15: As they advance, shadowsmiths can create more

potent items and armor, and can cloak themselves in shadow

to hide. They also have access to a few mysteries.

DC 20: The items created by a shadowsmith have a limited

life span, although some last many hours. If you can wait one

out and strike at the right time, she might be vulnerable.

A bardic knowledge check or a Gather Information check

(in a community that has a shadowsmith guild) can reveal

the same information as these skill checks, but in each case

the DC is 5 higher than the given value.

SHADOWSMITHS IN THE GAME

Because a shadowsmiths combat style and general behavior

doesnt change from her prior class, its easy to mistake her

for a  ghter, a rogue, a ranger, or the like. Only when she

casts a mystery or creates a shadow-crafted item does her true

nature become apparent; thus, PCs might have encountered

shadowsmiths  without  realizing  it.  Alternatively,  only  a

particular  race  or  community  in  a  given  campaign  might

have discovered these abilities.

Given the adaptable nature of the prestige class, players

who  were  largely  happy  with  their  characters  previous

classes, but wanted an unusual twist, should be happy with

the shadowsmith. Its abilities can enhance both martial and

stealth-related characters, augmenting them without altering

them so greatly that their inherent nature changes.

ADAPTATION

The DM can easily change the shadowsmith into a class that

manipulates  essences  or  substances  other  than  darkness.

Champions of Pelor, for instance, might form items out of

light, and apply the ghost touch or disruption special abilities

rather than shadow striking. A character might form tools

from smoke, or  re, or even force.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

The most effective means of introducing the PCs to a shad-

owsmith is to make them think theyre facing an ordinary

member of a standard adventuring class. Only after seeing

her in action do they realize theyre up against something

more esoteric.

SHADOW MAGIC FEATS

Mystery users have developed numerous feats, building on

their dark powers. While some of these feats are useful only

to  mystery  users,  others  are  appropriate  for  other  classes

as well.

gain an extra use of that mystery per day. This feat does not

otherwise increase the number of times per day that you can

cast the chosen mystery.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. When you

take the feat again, you can choose to affect the same mystery

or a different one.

EMPOWER MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

GREATER PATH FOCUS

You can cast mysteries to greater effect.

Prerequisites: Any metashadow feat.

Bene  t:  Once  per  day,  you  can  apply  the  effect  of  the

Empower  Spell  feat  to  any  mystery  you  cast.  All  variable,

numeric effects of an empowered mystery increase by one-

half.

Casting an empowered mystery is a full-round action.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

ENLARGE MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

You can cast mysteries farther than normal.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can alter a mystery with a range

of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. This

functions in most respects as the Enlarge Spell feat.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

EXTEND MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

You can cast mysteries that last longer than normal.

Bene  t:  Once  per  day,  you  can  apply  the  effect  of  the

Extend Mystery feat to any mystery you cast. An extended

mystery lasts twice as long as normal.

Casting an extended mystery is a full-round action.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

FAVORED MYSTERY

The mystery you choose becomes easier to cast.

Prerequisite: Ability to cast mysteries.

Bene  t: Choose a mystery you know. You cast that mystery

as a supernatural ability instead of a spell-like ability, or as a

spell-like ability instead of as a spell. If you choose a mystery

that  you  cast  as  a  supernatural  ability,  or  if  you  later  gain

the ability to cast that mystery as a supernatural ability, you

METASHADOW FEATS

Just as other casters enhance their spells through metamagic,

so  mystery  users  can  manipulate  their  castings  with  meta-

shadow  feats.  While  metamagic  feats  increase  the  casting

time of a spell to a full round when attached to spontaneously

cast spells, this is not always the case with metashadow feats.

Metashadow feats function identically to metamagic feats in

all ways not specifically contradicted herein.

A  metashadow  feat  improves  a  mystery  regardless  of

whether it is cast as a spell, activated as a spell-like ability, or

used as a supernatural ability. The exception to this rule is Still

Mystery, which only affects a mystery cast as a spell.

Choose a path of shadow magic to which you have already

applied the Path Focus feat. Your mysteries of that path are

now even more potent.

Prerequisite: Path Focus.

Bene  t:  You  function  at  +1  caster  level  when  casting

mysteries of the path you select. Additionally, add +1 to the

Dif culty Class of all saving throws against mysteries from

that path. These bonuses stack with those granted by Path

Focus.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects

do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new

path to which you have applied the Path Focus feat.

LINE OF SHADOW [METASHADOW]

You can cast a mystery without line of sight or line of effect

to the target.

Prerequisite: Any two metashadow feats.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can apply this feat to a mystery

which enables it to affect a target even if you do not currently

have line of sight or line of effect. The target must still be

within the spells maximum range, and you must have had

line of sight and line of effect within a number of rounds

equal to your Intelligence modi er. The target gains a bonus

on his save, if any, equal to the number of rounds since you

had line of sight or effect. You cannot apply this feat to any

mystery that requires a touch or ranged touch.

Casting  a  mystery  with  Line  of  Shadow  is  a  full-round

action.

Normal: You must have line of effect or line of sight to

target a creature or object with a mystery or spell.

Special: You can take this feat up to four times. To take it a

second time, you must have  ve metashadow feats. To take it

a third time, you must have eight metashadow feats. To take

it a fourth time, you must have eleven metashadow feats.

MAXIMIZE MYSTERY

[METASHADOW]

You can cast mysteries to maximum effect.

Prerequisite: Any two metashadow feats.

Bene  t: Once per day, all variable, numeric effects of a

mystery modi ed by this feat are maximized. This functions

in most respects as the Maximize Spell feat.

Casting a maximized mystery is a full-round action.

Special: You can take this feat up to four times. To take

it a second time, you must have  ve metashadow feats. To

take it a third time, you must have eight metashadow feats.

To take it a fourth time, you must have eleven metashadow

feats.

stronger at night.

Prerequisite: Ability to cast mysteries or a spell with the

darkness descriptor.

Bene  t: Choose one path of mysteries or school of magic to

which you have access. At night, the save DC of all associated

mysteries or spells increases by +1. This bonus stacks with

similar  bonuses,  such  those  from  the  Path  Focus  or  Spell

QUICKEN MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

You can cast a mystery with a moments thought.

Prerequisite: Any three metashadow feats.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can cast a mystery as a swift

action. This feat functions in most respects as the Quicken

a second time, you must have seven metashadow feats. To take

it a third time, you must have eleven metashadow feats.

REACH MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

You  can  cast  touch-range  mysteries  without  touching  the

target.

Prerequisite: Any metashadow feat.

Bene  t: Once per day, you can cast a mystery that normally

has a range of touch at any target within 30 feet. The mystery

effectively becomes a ray, so you must succeed on a ranged

touch attack to bestow the mystery upon the recipient.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times.

SHADOW CAST

Your shadow shimmers as you cast a spell and you seem to

cast your mysteries from elsewhere.

Prerequisite: Concentration 5 ranks, shadowcaster level

1st.

Bene  t:  Designate  a  square  adjacent  to  you.  If  no  one

threatens that square, you do not provoke an attack of oppor-

tunity when you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability.

137

SHADOW FAMILIAR

Noctumancers developed this feat in order to gain a mystical

companion.

Prerequisite: Shadowcaster level 3rd.

Bene  t: You can obtain a familiar in the same manner as

a sorcerer or wizard, but it possesses the dark template. As

with a sorcerer or wizard, obtaining a familiar takes 24 hours

and uses up magic materials worth 100 gp.

For  the  purpose  of  determining  familiar  abilities  that

depend on your arcane caster level, your levels in all classes

that allow you to cast mysteries or arcane spells stack.

Special: If you gain access to an alternative familiar, such

as through the Improved Familiar feat, it also gains the dark

template.

SHADOW REFLECTION

Your  shadow   ickers  and  moves  in  an  aggressive,  inde-

pendent  manner,  enabling  you  to  avoid  some  attacks  of

opportunity.

Prerequisites: Shadowcaster level 3rd, ability to cast the

dancing shadows or the clinging darkness mystery.

Bene  t: A foe that makes an attack of opportunity against

you has a 50% miss chance.

Special: Opponents that do not rely on sight ignore the

miss chance.

SHADOW VISION

Your senses grow so attuned with shadow that you gain a

limited ability to see in natural and magical darkness.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, ability to cast the bend perspective

or truth revealed mystery.

Bene  t: As long as you are in shadowy illumination or

darkness, you can take a move action to sense the number

of  creatures  within  20  feet  that  are  also  within  shadowy

illumination or darkness and the direction to each one. You

cannot pinpoint the location of any creature with this feat.

STILL MYSTERY [METASHADOW]

You can cast mysteries without gestures.

Bene  t:  A  stilled  mystery  can  be  cast  with  no  somatic

components. This also prevents your shadow from making

gestures that differ from your own during casting. Because

mysteries  activated  as  spell-like  and  supernatural  abilities

have no somatic components, this feat is useful only with

mysteries cast as arcane spells.

MYSTERIES AND PATHS

Mysteries are formed out of power drawn from the Plane of

Shadow and channeled through a casters body and soul.

All mysteries have a level, which is used to determine save

DCs. Mysteries are divided into areas of study called paths.

Paths  come  in  three  categories:  apprentice,  initiate,  and

master, and each path has three steps of increasing power.

Thus,  the  nine  levels  of  mysteries  divide  equally  into  the

paths: 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-level mysteries form the apprentice

paths, 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-level mysteries the initiate paths,

and 7th-, 8th-, and 9th-level mysteries the master paths.

Mysteries function as spells, spell-like abilities, or super-

natural abilities, depending on the category of the path and

the knowledge of the mystery user. All mysteries have the

following characteristics, unless otherwise noted in a speci c

description.

Can be cast once per day if functioning as an arcane spell,

two  times  per  day  if  functioning  as  a  spell-like  ability,

and three times per day if functioning as a supernatural

ability.

Can be dismissed at will by the mystery user if it has a

duration longer than instantaneous.

Functions in darkness or any sort of ambient light, even if

the mystery describes the mystery user manipulating his

or the subjects shadow. The mystery users connection to

the Plane of Shadow is so strong that he can manipulate

a subjects spiritual shadow even where shadows cannot

normally exist.

Requires a standard action to cast.

Requires somatic components if cast as an arcane spell.

Is subject to the same stacking rules as spells.

Does not easily interact with spells. Any attempt to use a

mystery (such as shadows fade) to dispel a spell, or to use a

spell (such as dispel magic) to dispel a mystery, takes a 4

penalty.

Can  be  identi ed  with  a  Spellcraft  check,  but  requires

a  different  understanding  of  that  skill.  A  mystery  user

with no levels in a spellcasting class takes a 4 penalty on

Spellcraft  checks  made  to  identity  spells.  A  spellcaster

with no levels in a mystery-using class takes a 4 penalty

on Spellcraft checks made to identify mysteries.

Cannot  bene t  from  feats  that  enhance  spells,  such  as

metamagic feats, Ability Focus, or Empower Spell-Like Abil-

ity. Instead, mysteries bene t from metashadow feats.

UNSEEN ARROW

Developed  by  shadowblades,  this  feat  allows  a  member  of

that class to apply his unseen weapon abilities to thrown or

projectile weapons.

Prerequisite: Unseen weapon class feature.

Bene  t: You can apply the unseen weapon class feature,

and all its abilities, to a thrown or missile weapon. If you use

the far shadow ability (see page 130) with a ranged weapon,

it adds 30 feet to the distance the weapon can travel before

you take the  rst range increment penalty.

DETECTING MYSTERIES

Shadow magic, though subtle, is an alien thing, and people

who are learned in the occult can often detect its use. When

a mystery user casts a mystery as an arcane spell, his shadow

makes gestures different from the ones he performs. Any

observer  can  notice  this  bit  of  oddness  with  a  successful

DC 15 Spot check.

Similarly, any image, item, or creature created or conjured

through mysteries is touched by shadow. Some are darker

than normal, as if half-obscured by shade; others, particu-

larly living creatures, might be pallid or unusually gaunt.

138

Minor details strike viewers as wrong. Colors seem dull and

appearance more average, muting extremes of either beauty

or ugliness. Dangerous aspects of creatures or items appear

enhanceda normally innocuous animal has a feral air and

more vicious claws and teeth, a rose bush is darker in hue,

slightly shriveled, and has excessive thorns.

Once  an  observer  has  either  seen  a  characters  shadow

moving independently, or has observed the touch of shadow

in an image or item, she can attempt a DC 15 Knowledge

(arcana) or Knowledge (the planes) check, or a DC 25 bardic

knowledge or Knowledge (religion) check. Success identi es

the mystery user for what he is or the item or creature as

something tainted by the Plane of Shadow.

Although  it  is  dif cult,  mysteries  might  be  revealed  as

magic  by  spells  such  as detect  magic .  Mysteries  register  as

belonging to the school of magic whose effects they most

closely resemble.

MYSTERY DESCRIPTIONS

Mysteries  descriptions  include  many  of  the  elements  of

spell  descriptions  (discussed  in  Chapter  10  of  the  Players

Handbook). Other parts of the standard mystery format are

new or altered, and are covered below.

PATH CATEGORY, PATH NAME

On the line below the mysterys name, the mysterys path

category  (apprentice,  initiate,  or  master)  and  path  name

are presented. If a mystery is a fundamental, only the word

Fundamental appears on this line.

LEVEL/SCHOOL

This  line  gives  the  mysterys  level,  school,  subschool,  or

descriptor. Creatures that have immunities, vulnerabilities,

or special bonuses against a particular school, subschool, or

descriptor of a spell have the same characteristics against a

mystery of that school, subschool, or descriptor.

DESCRIPTIVE PASSAGES

This  part  of  the  description  provides  hints  about  what

the mystery looks, sounds, or feels like when it is cast or

activated.  The  text  here  describes  the  mystery  from  the

casters  or  users  view.  These  descriptive  passages  are  not

binding  rules.  A  grand  gesture  mentioned  in  a  mysterys

descriptive passage (representing the somatic component)

is unnecessary if a mystery user activates the mystery as a

supernatural or spell-like ability. Even though a descriptive

passage speaks of casting a mystery on another creature, it

might be possible to cast the mystery in another manner

(such  as  on  the  mystery  user  herself),  depending  on  the

mysterys target entry and the rules for spellcasting in the

Players Handbook.

SPELL RESISTANCE

Apprentice mysteries cast as supernatural abilities are not

subject to spell resistance, regardless of what might appear

on the spell resistance line of a mystery description.

FUNDAMENTAL MYSTERIES

Arrow of Dusk: Ray deals 2d4 nonlethal, 3 crit.

Black Candle: As the spell darkness or light.

Caul of Shadow: Shadows grant de ection bonus to AC.

Liquid  Night:  Create  ink  by  manifesting  surrounding

shadows.

Mystic Re  ections: As the spell detect magic.

Shadow Hood: Subject takes 1 penalty on attack rolls and

Dexterity-based checks.

Sight Obscured: +5 bonus on Hide, Sleight of Hand, or

other  checks  to  conceal  your  movements,  actions,  or

presence.

Umbral  Hand:  As  the  spell  mage  hand,  but  can  affect

heavier objects and magic items.

Widened Eyes: Gain low-light vision.

MYSTERIES:

SPELLS, SPELL-LIKE,

AND SUPERNATURAL ABILITIES

Shadowcasters  begin  weaving  their  mysteries  as  spells,  then

develop them into spell-like abilities, and finally master them

as supernatural abilities. These different kinds of effects have

some, but not all, characteristics in common.

Spell-Like Abilities: Spell-like abilities are magical and work

just  like  spells  (although  they  are  not  spells  and  so  have  no

verbal, somatic, material, focus, or XP components). They do

not function in an antimagic field and are subject to spell resis-

tance if the spell the ability resembles or duplicates would be

subject to spell resistance.

Using a spell-like ability is a standard action unless otherwise

noted, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks of op-

portunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use

a spell-like ability defensively and avoid provoking an attack of

opportunity, just as when casting a spell. A spell-like ability can

be disrupted just as a spell can be. Spell-like abilities cannot be

used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.

Supernatural:  Supernatural  abilities  are  magical  and  do

not function in an antimagic field but are not subject to spell

resistance. Supernatural abilities cannot be dispelled or coun-

terspelled, or used to counterspell. Using a supernatural ability

is a standard action unless otherwise noted. Supernatural abili-

ties might have a use limit or be usable at will, just like spell-like

abilities. However, supernatural abilities do not provoke attacks

of opportunity and never require Concentration checks.

The table below expands upon and supersedes Table 81 on

page 290 of the Dungeon Masters Guide. Column A refers to

spells, column B to spell-like abilities, and column C to super-

natural abilities.

NEW CONDITION: IMMOBILIZED

Several  mysteries  impose  a  condition  not  described  in  the

Players Handbook or the Dungeon Masters Guide: immobi-

lized. An immobilized creature can attack and cast spells nor-

mally, but it cannot move from the square or squares that it is

in. This condition does not prevent a creature from defending

itself, nor does it cause a creature to lose its Dexterity bonus

to  Armor  Class.  Flying  creatures  that  become  immobilized

in  mid-flight  can  control  their  descent  so  that  they  do  not

take falling damage, but they are incapable of moving from

their current square as long as the effect ends and automati-

cally descend at a rate of 20 feet per round. Flying creatures

with the ability to hover can maintain their initial altitude if

they choose.

energy  with  a  thin  layer  of  that  energys  shadowy  re ec-

tion. This grants the subject immunity to normal extremes

of temperature and absorbs cold damage from attacks and

effects. When an aura of shade absorbs a total of 12 points of

cold damage per caster level (maximum 120), it expires.

For as long as the aura is active, the subjects weapon or

natural  weapon  melee  attacks  deal  an  extra  1d6  points  of

Area: One 5-ft. square/level (S)

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Re ex negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You open a conduit to the Plane of Shadow, drawing its elements

into the world and igniting a black  re on the ground.

You create a shapeable shadowy curtain of black  ame that

covers the affected squares. The  re deals 1d6 points of cold

damage per two caster levels to any creature standing in an

affected square at the beginning of each of your turns until

the effect ends. In addition, the  ame deals damage to any

creature entering or passing through an affected square. Black

 re burns only a few feet tall, so a creature can avoid the effect

of the mystery by jumping or  ying over the area.

You send your vision through shadows and into planar re ections,

altering your point of view.

You view the world as though you were standing in a differ-

ent spot, up to a maximum distance of 25 feet plus 5 feet per

two caster levels. You cannot see through solid objects. You

can, however, look around corners or over barriers, obtain

a birds-eye view of your area, and the like. Essentially, you

shift your perspective as though you were located at any spot

in range to which you have line of effect.

You  can  switch  back  and  forth  between  your  own  eyes

and your alternate viewpoint as a swift action. You can move

your alternate perspective, as in the spell arcane eye. Its speed

is only 10 feet per round, however, and every round of such

movement decreases the mysterys duration by 1 minute (if

you move the perspective in the last minute of the duration,

you gain a few seconds of vision at the new position before

the effect expires).

BOLSTER

Initiate, Body and Soul

Level/School: 4th/Transmutation

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 10 minutes/level or until discharged (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

By  linking  the  creature  touched  and  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  you

temporarily trade some of its traits for more potent ones belonging

to creatures of that shady realm.

You grant the subject 5 temporary hit points for each of its

Hit Dice (maximum 75). For the duration of the effect, the

subjects shadow grows larger than normal, and its movements

are very slightly uncoordinated with those of the subject. An

observer can notice this characteristic by making a DC 20

Spot check.

CARPET OF SHADOW

Apprentice, Dark Terrain

Level/School: 1st/Conjuration (Creation)

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: One 5-ft. square/level (S)

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

142

The ground becomes rough and hazardous, the real  oor superim-

posed with irregular terrain of the Plane of Shadow.

You cloak the ground with an uneven and hard to traverse

surface. The terrain becomes dif cult, meaning that each

5-foot square within the area costs double to move into. For

instance, each light undergrowth square (normally costing

2 squares of movement to move into) now costs 4 squares of

movement to move into. If you cast this mystery a second

time on the same area (or a portion of the same area) while

the  rst casting is still active, the second casting does not

worsen  the  terrain  further  (although  it  would  extend  the

duration of the effect on that area).

CAUL OF SHADOW

Fundamental

Level/School: 1st/Abjuration

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Target: One living creature whose exact location is known to

you, or one living creature you know well whose approxi-

mate location (within 100 ft.) is known to you

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You look toward your shadow and speak a few words knowing that

some distance away, a subject hears them and might reply.

You speak, and your words appear in the mind of a distant

creature. The message can consist of up to  ve words, plus

one  additional  word  per  caster  level.  It  cannot  deliver

command  words  for  magic  items,  or  in  any  other  respect

function  as  anything  but  normal  speech.  If  the  subject  is

where  you  believe  it  to  be,  the  message  is  delivered.  The

subject recognizes the identity of the sender of the message

if it knows you. The creature can then reply, using the same

number of words that you used. The message cannot cross

planar boundaries.

A shifting, whirling  eld of semisolid shadows and tiny rifts in the

air rises around you.

Caul of shadow faintly darkens your form, but does not provide

any bonuses on Hide checks or similar efforts. You gain a +1

de ection bonus to AC, with an additional +1 for every six

caster levels (maximum bonus +4).

CONSUME ESSENCE

Master, Ebon Walls

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 20-ft.-radius emanation (D)

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Re ex negates; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

Shadow oozes out of the  oors, the walls, even the air,  lling the

area with wisps of writhing blackness. Creatures within the area

become coated in these clinging shadows.

Any  creature  within  the  area  affected  by  this  mystery,  or

that enters the area on its turn, must make a Re ex save or

become immobilized (see page 140).

Each  round  on  its  turn,  an  immobilized  subject  can

attempt a new saving throw to end the condition. Because

of the subjects condition, this save is a full-round action (but

does not provoke attacks of opportunity). If an immobilized

subject succeeds on its save, it still needs to save again at the

start  of  its  next  turn  in  order  to  avoid  succumbing  to  the

darkness again.

CONGRESS OF SHADOWS

Apprentice, Ebon Whispers

Level/School: 2nd/Divination [Mind-Affecting]

Range: 1 mile/level

You reach out and peel the subjects shadow away, then wrap it

inside your own.

The target of this horrid mystery must succeed on a Will

saving throw or die. If the creature succumbs to the mystery

and dies, it immediately returns to life, gains the dark creature

template, and is under your control. The creature remains in

this state for 1 round per level, and then dies again.

CURTAIN OF SHADOWS

Initiate, Veil of Shadows

Level/School: 5th/Transmutation

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

all who pass through it with cold.

You create a wall of shadow that completely blocks line of

sight. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points

of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

Level/School: 3rd/Illusion (Glamer)

Range: Touch

Target: One creature/5 levels

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You draw the shadows around yourself or other subjects, where they

waver and shift, partially obscuring form.

You grant subjects concealment. If you cast this mystery on a

single subject, the shadows are thicker, and the subject gains

total concealment. The spell see invisibility and the mystery

piercing sight do not negate these miss chances, but the spell

true seeing and the mystery truth revealed do.

DARK AIR OR WATER

Initiate, Elemental Shadows

Level/School: 5th/Transmutation [Air or Water]

Reaching out with your mind to the darkness attached to your soul,

you infuse nature with shadow and compel it to do your will.

This  mystery  functions  like  the  spell  control  water  or  con-

trol  winds.  You  decide  which  version  to  use  at  the  time  of

casting.

DARK SOUL

Master, Heart and Soul

Level/School:  7th/Enchantment  (Compulsion)  [Mind-

Spell Resistance: Yes; see text

You open the subjects mind to the Plane of Shadow, altering its

personality.

You turn the dark energies from the Plane of Shadow upon

another creature, compelling it to act in ways that it normally

would not. While this effect is active, you can use a standard

action to focus the shadow energies on one living creature

within 30 feet that you select. The creature must succeed on a

Will saving throw (DC 17 + your Cha modi er) or immediately

make a melee attack against one target within its reach.

By drawing shade from the Plane of Shadow, or banishing the shad-

ows back to it, you control the level of illumination in the area.

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

You make a dark area lighter or a light area darker, blanketing

the affected area in shadowy illumination. Creatures with

darkvision can see through this area normally.

The air explodes with shadowy tendrils that slice like blades.

Targets of ephemeral storm must make a Fortitude save or die.

Those who succeed take 5d6 points of damage.

ECHO SPELL

Initiate, Black Magic

Level/School: 5th/Universal

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Repeat a previously cast spell or mystery

Duration: See text

Saving Throw: See text

Spell Resistance: See text

Even  as  you  recoil  from  your  enemys  spell,  you  reach  into  the

Plane of Shadow and draw forth the spiritual re ection of that

spell. With a grin, you manifest it in the physical world and hurl

it back at him.

You can echo a mystery or spell cast by anyone other than

yourself, causing it to remanifest under your control. Both the

caster and the effect must have been within echo spells range,

and the entire casting must have occurred in the previous

round. You choose the mystery or spells target, and make any

other choices involved in casting it. You cast the mystery or

spell using your mystery user level (use your Cha modi er

to determine the mystery or spells DC; its duration, saves,

and the like are as normal for that spell). You cannot echo

a  mystery  or  spell  of  a  higher  level  than  the  highest-level

mystery you can cast, and you can never echo a mystery or a

spell of higher than 4th level.

Target: One Small object per caster level; see text

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You  infuse  one  or  more  small  objects  with  shadowstuff,  causing

them to animate at your command.

This mystery functions like the spell animate objects, but the

items grow dark and warped, becoming more sharp-edged

and appearing slightly worn or decayed for the duration of

the  effect.  In  addition,  objects  animated  by  this  mystery

bene t from concealment.

You  detach  your  own  shadow  and  animate  it  with  extraplanar

energies, creating a dark-hued, hazy duplicate of yourself.

This  mystery  functions  like  the  spell  project  image,  except

as noted above. In addition, the image that you project has

concealment unless it is in direct sunlight or within the area

of a daylight spell.

points of Strength damage, 6 points of Dexterity damage,

or 4 points of Constitution damage. You must deal the same

kind of ability damage to all subjects.

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  ash through the conduits and pathways of the Plane of Shadow,

Once per round, as an immediate action, you can instantly

transfer  yourself  from  your  current  location  to  any  other

spot  within  a  distance  of  5  feet  per  two  caster  levels.  You

always arrive at exactly the spot desiredjust as with the

spell dimension door. If you cast  icker in response to an attack

against you, the strike has a 50% miss chance.

FLOOD OF SHADOW

Initiate, Black Magic

Level/School: 6th/Abjuration

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: See text

You  inundate  the  area  with  strange  energies  from  the  Plane  of

Shadow, warping the effects of magic.

A  ood of mystical shadow-power renders casting more dif-

 cult. To cast most spells while in, or into, an area affected by

 ood of shadow, the caster must succeed on a Spellcraft check

(DC 15 + spell level), or the spell is lost with no effect.

Mysteries  or  any  spells  of  the  shadow  subschool  can

be cast within or into the affected area without making

the Spellcraft check. In addition, if a mystery or a spell

of the shadow subschool originates in an area affected by

flood of shadow, its variable numerical effect is increased

by 50% (as if it was empowered), although its level does

not increase.

KILLING SHADOWS

Apprentice, Eyes of Darkness

Level/School: 3rd/Transmutation

Range: 30 ft.

Effect: Cone

Saving Throw: Will half

Spell Resistance: Yes

Target: One creature or one creature/level, no two of which

are more than 30 ft. apart; see text

Duration: 1 round/2 levels (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You channel shadowstuff into the subjects shadow, literally weigh-

ing him down under its weight.

monster. You choose which version you want before the effect

begins. If you choose hold monster, the mystery can affect

only one subject.

LIFE FADES

Apprentice, Touch of Twilight

Level/School: 1st/Necromancy

Range: Touch

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

A wave of darkness washes over the subject, sapping his energy into

the Plane of Shadow.

Your touch deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster

level  (maximum  5d6)  and  causes  the  subject  to  become

fatigued for 1 round per caster level (a Fortitude save negates

the  fatigue).  This  mystery  does  not  stack  with  itself,  so  a

creature fatigued by one casting does not become exhausted

by a second casting.

level  (maximum  20d6)  and  causes  the  subject  to  become

exhausted for 1 round per caster level (a Fortitude save reduces

the damage by half and decreases the exhaustion to fatigue).

This mystery does not stack with itself, so a creature fatigued

by saving against one casting does not become exhausted by

saving against a second casting.

LIQUID NIGHT

Level/School: 1st/Conjuration (Creation)

Range: Touch

Effect: A small quantity of ink

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

The  shadows  around  your  hand  seem  to  weep,  leaving  a  small

puddle of dark tears.

You create a quantity of ink great enough for you to write

approximately one page of text. It is not of suf cient quality

to scribe spells. In darkness or shadowy illumination, the

ink glows with red or yellow light that has the brightness of

a candle. Water splashed on the ink causes it to wash away

and cease glowing, but otherwise the ink continues to glow

inde nitely.

cold damage at the beginning of each round that it remains

inside the prison.

Once each round as a standard action, a creature caught

in the prison can attempt a Fortitude saving throw against

the spells original DC to break out of the prison. Success

means that the creature can move out of the prison, and it

fades to nothingness. Failure means that the creature takes

1d4 points of Constitution damage and remains trapped.

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 minutes/level or until discharged

Using the greatest of magic, you peer through the Plane of Shadow

back into the Material Plane, and view shadows and re ections of

events that have not yet happened.

This mystery grants you knowledge of what will occur (or at

least what is likely to occur), granting you several bene ts.

You gain the uncanny dodge ability, a +10 insight bonus on

initiative checks (you always get to act in a surprise round),

and a +4 insight bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, you can discharge the energy of this mystery

as an immediate action to cause an attack to miss you that

would otherwise have been successful. You can declare that

you are using this ability after the result of the attack roll is

known, but you must do so before damage is determined.

Using this ability discharges and ends the mystery.

immediate  action  to  immediately  reroll  one  failed  saving

throw. Using this ability discharges and ends the mystery.

SHADOW EVOCATION

Initiate, Dark Re  ections

The subjects vision overlaps the

Plane of Shadow, causing him

to see  ickering images, areas

Initiate, Elemental Shadows

Level/School: 6th/Evocation [Electricity, Cold]

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Targets:  One  primary  target,  plus  one  secondary  target/

level (each of which must be within 30 ft. of the primary

target)

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex half

Spell Resistance: Yes

From a sudden rift into the Plane of Shadow, a cold wind begins

to blow. Torrents of shadow arc out, draining the life from nearby

creatures.

This mystery creates a blast of electricity and cold energy,

much like some of the most fearsome weather found on the

Plane of Shadow. The storm strikes one target initially, then

arcs to other targets.

The  storm  deals  1d6  points  of  damage  per  caster  level

(maximum 20d6). Half of this damage is electricity damage,

and the other half is cold damage. After it strikes, the storm

arcs (like the spell chain lightning) to a number of secondary

targets  equal  to  your  caster  level  (maximum  twenty).  The

secondary arcs each strike one target and deal half as much

damage as the primary one did (round down).

attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition,

you have total concealment with respect to the subject (miss

chance applies during each round of the duration).

You cloak yourself in shadow and shift the light that would reveal

you into the Plane of Shadow.

While this mystery is in effect, you can attempt Hide checks

even while being observed, just as if you had cover or conceal-

ment for the purpose of this determination.

This more potent version of the mystery shadows fade func-

tions like the spell greater dispel magic.

SHARP SHADOWS

Apprentice, Cloak of Shadows

Level/School: 3rd/Abjuration

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

You cloak yourself in sharp spikes of darkness. Although they are

weightless and do nothing to impede you, your foes soon discover

that theyre not so lucky.

A creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon

takes 1d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum

+15). A creature wielding a reach weapon, such as a longspear,

is not subject to this damage if it attacks you. If the attacker has

spell resistance, it applies to this effect (unless you used the

mystery as a supernatural ability). Damage from sharp shadows is

not considered magical for the purpose of overcoming damage

reduction, and the effect is not considered a weapon for the

purpose of spells such as align weapon or magic weapon.

SIGHT ECLIPSED

Apprentice, Cloak of Shadows

Level/School: 2nd/Illusion (Glamer)

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

SIGHT OBSCURED

Fundamental

Level/School: 0/Illusion (Glamer)

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  cloak  the  subject  and  her  movements  in  subtly  shifting

shadow.

This mystery grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Hide checks,

Sleight of Hand checks, and any other checks that involve

concealing the subjects actions or gestures.

SOUL PUPPET

Master, Heart and Soul

Level/School:  8th/Enchantment  (Compulsion)  [Mind-

Affecting]

Range: Touch

Target: One living creature touched

Duration: 1 day/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Tendrils of shadow creep from your  ngers, through the Plane of

Shadow, and into the soul of the subject by way of its own shadow.

You now control the creatures actions as if it were a puppet.

The control granted by soul puppet follows the same mechanics

as the spell dominate monster. Anyone observing the subject

with the spell true seeing, the mystery truth revealed, or a simi-

lar ability sees tendrils of darkness extending a few feet from

the subject before fading into nothingness. Similarly, anyone

observing you while using similar abilities notices tendrils

extending from your  ngers, also fading into nothing.

STEEL SHADOWS

Apprentice, Cloak of Shadows

Level/School: 1st/Abjuration

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 10 minutes/level (D)

Darkness  coalesces  about  your  body,  forming  a  shadow-shape  of

armor and another that looks like a shield. Although they are as

weightless as the air, you know theyll protect you as well as if they

were made of steel.

150

Steel shadows grants you a +3 armor bonus and a +3 shield

bonus  to  AC,  but  without  weight,  armor  check  penalty,

arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. The effect

is not a force effect, and attacks from incorporeal creatures

ignore it.

STEP INTO SHADOW

Initiate, Ebon Roads

Level/School: 4th/Conjuration (Teleportation)

Range: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

Target: You and touched objects or other touched willing

creatures

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None and Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: No and Yes (object)

You transport yourself through the Plane of Shadow to any spot

within range. Your shadow stretches out from you until it reaches

your chosen destination, passing through solid objects and moving

independently of the ambient light. You appear to fall into your

shadow at one end, and rise from it at the other.

This mystery functions like the spell dimension door.

SUMMON UMBRAL SERVANT

Master, Shadow Calling

Level/School: 7th/Conjuration (Summoning)

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: One summoned creature

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

You summon a creature of shadow to serve you, calling it through

the barriers between worlds.

This mystery functions like the spell summon monster I, except

as noted here. You can summon one Huge, two Large, or four

Medium or smaller shadow elementals.

THOUGHTS OF SHADOW

Apprentice, Umbral Mind

Level/School: 2nd/Transmutation

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You open the subjects mind to shadow, and the new perceptions

it offers.

You  grant  the  subject  a  +4  enhancement  bonus  to  Intelli-

gence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You decide which ability you

are enhancing when you cast the mystery, and you may not

later alter your choice.

TOMB OF NIGHT

Master, Ebon Walls

Level/School: 8th/Conjuration (Creation)

You temporarily banish your foe to the depths of shadow.

This mystery functions like the mystery prison of night, except

that instead of taking Constitution damage upon failing a

Fortitude  saving  throw  to  escape  the  prison,  the  creature

gains one negative level. In addition, tomb of night deals 3d6

points of cold damage per round.

TRUTH REVEALED

Master, Eyes of the Night Sky

Level/School: 7th/Divination

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D); see text

By  focusing  on  the  spiritual  shadow  of  the  world,  you  can  see

hidden truths.

At its most basic, this mystery functions like the spell true

seeing. You can also, by concentrating on a particular creature

or  object  for  1  minute  or  more,  gain  additional  informa-

tion  on  that  subject.  However,  because  of  the  distortion

between  worlds  and  the  twisting  effect  of  shadows,  any

additional  information  gained  in  this  manner  might  be

false or misleading.

past equal to your caster level.

The table below indicates what other mystical effects can

be duplicated with truth revealed. Concentrating on a speci c

target requires a substantial amount of time, during which

you can only take move actions, and cannot focus on any

other target. At the end of this period, the target makes a

saving throw against the DC of truth revealed to resist the

detection  effect.  Spell  resistance  applies  to  this  further

detection effect as well. You may not attempt any one effect

on the same target more than once per use of truth revealed.

Remember  that  these  effects  are  in  addition  to  the  basic

knowledge granted by true seeing, which occurs instantly

and reliably.

UMBRAL BODY

Master, Dark Metamorphosis

Level/School: 8th/Transmutation

Range: Personal

Target: You

You become a being of shadow, rather than one of substance.

You  gain  the  incorporeal  subtype  (see  page  164)  and  all

advantages and traits associated with it.

target, which must succeed on a Fortitude saving throw or

also be slowed. While this mystery is active, you threaten an

area as if you were armed and can make attacks of opportunity

with your umbral touch.

This mystery completely occupies one of your hands, as if

you were holding an object in that hand. If you have another

open hand, you can cast other mysteries or spells normally,

even  those  with  a  range  of  touch,  but  you  cannot  deliver

another touch mystery or touch spell and make an attack

with umbral touch in the same round.

This effect normally lasts for 1 minute per level, but each

successful  touch  attack  shortens  the

duration by 1 minute (allowing you to

make one successful attack per level

before the effect is discharged).

You point your  nger at a dis-

This  mystery  functions

late heavier objects and

magic  items.  Magic

items  are  allowed  a

the  effect.  You  need  not

concentrate  on  the  effect,

but  you  must  direct  it  with

it  negates  the  effects  of  the  mysteries  mesmerizing  shade,

caster  level  check  (1d20  +  caster  level).  If  you  do  not,  you

have  failed  to  take  control  of  his  spell  or  mystery,  and  it

manifests normally.

If you succeed on the opposed check, the other casters

mystery or spell is countered, as if you had used the counter-

spell action successfully, and you gain one additional use of

an apprentice-path mystery that you know. You can keep this

additional use until a later turn (requiring a standard action

to activate), but it must be used within 1 hour or it is lost.

You can also combine the activation of the additional spell

or mystery with the immediate action required for the warp

spell mystery itself, allowing you to cast the apprentice-path

mystery out of turn.

VOYAGE INTO SHADOW

Initiate, Ebon Roads

Level/School: 6th/Illusion (Shadow)

Range: Touch

Targets: Up to one touched creature/level

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You and other creatures you touch enter the Plane of Shadow for

a brief span, using it as a means of crossing great distances on the

Material Plane.

This mystery functions like the spell shadow walk, except as

noted here. Your movement rate on the Plane of Shadow is

double that described by the spell. Further, upon reaching

your destination, you can attempt a DC 30 Knowledge (the

planes)  check;  success  indicates  that  you  appear  exactly

where you wish, rather than being shunted to a nearby

space  as  per  the  spell.  You  need  not  leave  the  Plane  of

Shadow once you enter it, and this mystery can be used

on the Plane of Shadow to travel rapidly.

SHADOW MAGIC ITEMS

Mystery users create magic items, and some even rival wizards

for sheer quantity of item creation feats. The majority of the

shadow magic items presented here were created by shadow-

casters using various mysteries, but some are intended instead

to oppose mystery usersand a rare few seem to have been

the original creation of no mortal, but based on the designs

of creatures of the Plane of Shadow.

SPELL COMPLETION AND

SPELL TRIGGER ITEMS

In addition to new items, mystery users create their own potions,

scrolls, staffs, and wands. These items function based on the

mysterys level, and a mystery always functions like a spell when

cast by an item, even if the caster level is high enough that a

shadowcaster would use it as a supernatural ability.

The mystery user must know the mystery or mysteries he

wishes to imbue in the item. The act of imbuing the item

triggers the mystery; the creator loses one use of that mystery

for the day, as though he had expended it. The mystery user

must supply all the necessary materials for these items, and

must have a quiet and well-equipped workspace. Creating

an  item  requires  one  day  per  1,000  gp  of  the  base  price,

minimum one day. He must spend at least 8 hours working

every day until the item is completed. In all respects, this

process follows the standard rules for creating magic items

(DMG 282288).

Mystery users cannot use spell completion or spell trig-

ger devices created by members of other classes, even if the

spell has an effect similar to that of a mystery. For instance, a

mystery user could not use a wand of dispel magic, even though

that spell is functionally the same as the mystery shadows fade.

The same is true in reverse; a wizard could not use a wand of

shadows fade.

Traditionally, mystery users create staffs along path lines,

although this is not a requirement. A staff might hold all the

mysteries of a single path, or six mysteries representing two

complete paths. It is also traditionalthough again, not a

mechanical requirementfor apprentice-path mysteries to

require one charge, initiate-path mysteries to require two,

and master-path mysteries to require three. Assuming this

default, shadow magic staffs are normally priced as follows.

(The  price  indicated  is  market  price;  cost  to  create  is  1/2

market price, as normal.)

OTHER STANDARD MAGIC ITEMS

In  addition  to  potions,  scrolls,  staffs,  and  wands,  shadow

magic-speci c  variants  exist  of  various  magic  items  that

do not receive a full write-up in this section. These items

function, and are priced, as indicated in the Dungeon Masters

Guide.

METASHADOW ROD

This item grants its wielder access to a particular metashadow

feat, usable three times a day. For instance, a rod of empower

mystery allows the wielder to empower three mysteries per

day. As with metamagic rods, metashadow rods come in three

varieties: lesser (usable with fundamentals and apprentice

path mysteries), normal (usable with initiate path mysteries),

and greater (usable with master path mysteries).

NEW ARMOR SPECIAL

MATERIAL: SHADOW SILK

This material is woven from shadow itself.

Description: Shadow silk is a very faint material,

translucent  and   imsy.  It  has  the  look  and  feel  of

deep black silk.

Activation: Shadow silk armor continually grants

its wearer its bene ts. In brighter light, it feels heavier

and in areas of shadowy illumination or darkness, it

feels lightweight and  uid.

Effect:  The  wearer  of  shadow  silk  armor  moves

more quietly and blends into shadow more effectively.

It  grants  its  wearer  a  +2  bonus  on  Hide  and  Move

Silently checks.

Only  armor  that  is  made  from  cloth  or  leather

can  be  crafted  using  shadow  silk.  Padded,  leather,

or hide armor can be made from the material. These

shadow silk armors are treated as light armor. The

maximum  Dexterity  bonus  is  increased  by  2,  and

armor check penalties are lessened by 2 (to a mini-

mum of 0). The arcane spell failure chance in areas

of shadowy illumination or darkness is reduced by

15% (minimum 0%).

An item made from shadow silk weighs approximately

one-quarter as much as the same item made from other

materials.  Armor  fashioned  from  shadow  silk  is  always

masterwork; the masterwork cost is included in the prices

given below.

Shadow silk armor has 10 hit points and hardness 1. The

material knits itself back together in areas of shadowy

illumination or darkness, restoring 1 hit point per round

unless it is destroyed (hit points 0 or lower).

NEW WEAPON SPECIAL

ABILITY: SHADOW STRIKING

Although  mystery  users  are  not  normally  martial

combatants, they have developed the shadow striking

weapon special ability to aid them and their companions

in battle.

A  shadow  striking  weapon  takes  on  the

properties of a creature it hits, developing the

ability to overcome damage reduction.

Description: A shadow striking weapon is an

unre ective jet black. It seems almost to ripple

on occasion, like an object viewed under a thin

layer of uneasy water. It is uncomfortably cold, but

not painful, to the touch.

Prerequisite: The striking surface of a shadow strik-

ing weapon must be made of metal. Weapons that are

made entirely of wood cannot be shadow striking. Bows,

crossbows, and slings cannot bene t from the shadow

striking ability, but metal ammunition can.

Activation: A shadow striking weapon automatically

attunes itself to the target. When it strikes a target that

has damage reduction, it adjusts itself to overcome the

damage reduction of that creature.

Effect: Shadow striking weapons draw on the re ec-

tive nature of shadow to alter their nature and overcome

damage reduction. A shadow striking weapon can adjust

to  emulate  any  alignment  or  substance  required  to

overcome damage reduction.

A shadow striking weapons attunement to a par-

ticular sort of damage reduction fades 1d4 minutes

after the last time it made contact with the appropri-

ate creature.

Aura/Caster  Level:  Moderate  universal  (shadow).

CL 9th.

Construction:  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

of Shadow.

RINGS AND

WONDROUS ITEMS

The following are just a sample of the items

that  can  be  created  through  the  use  of

shadow magicor to thwart it.

DARK LANTERN

Designed  by  shadowcasters,  a  dark

lantern  sheds  a  mystical  light  in  the

form of shadowy illumination.

Description: This item is a hooded

lantern,  constructed  of  black  iron

with mithral  ligree. Its crystalline

panels are tinted bright gold.

When  lit,  the  lantern  radiates

shadowy  illumination  out  to

60  feet.  The  light   ickers  more

slowly  than  normal   re,  and

the  crackle  of  the   ames

sounds more like plodding

footsteps.

Activation:  You  strike  a

light  within,  just  as  if  it  were  a

normal lantern. The lantern must have oil

or other fuel. You also speak a command

word,  such  as  shadows  or  darkness.

The  activating  process  requires  a  full-

round  action.  You  can  deactivate  the  lantern  by  opening

it and blowing out the  ame within (altogether a standard

action).

Dark lantern

Effect:  A  dark  lantern  sheds  a  mystic  light  that  creates

shadowy illumination, modifying the brightness of ambient

light as well as spells of equal or lower level with the light or

darkness descriptor.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate evocation. CL 9th.

Construction:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  dusk  and  dawn,

1,000 gp, 80 XP, 2 days.

Weight: 2 lb.

Price: 2,000 gp.

COLLAR OF UMBRAL METAMORPHOSIS

This collar temporarily transforms you into a creature

of shadow.

Description: A collar of umbral meta-

morphosis is a thick collar of black leather

studded with onyx spikes and closed

with a tarnished silver clasp. When

activated, it seems to disappear into

your shadowy  esh.

Activation:  A  command  word,

such  as  fade  or  darken,  both

activates and deactivates the collar.

This requires a standard action. A

collar functions for up to 10 minutes

per  day,  divided  up  as  you  see   t

(but each use counts as 1 minute,

minimum).

a market price of 22,000 gp.

Weight: 1 lb.

Price: 10,800 gp.

GEM OF NIGHT

A gem of night is essentially a piece of solid shadow that

can grow into a shadow elemental.

Description:  The  item  appears  to  be  a  re ective

black gemstone. It is a rough globe, covered in hun-

dreds of tiny facets. It is vaguely cold to the touch and

seems to absorb rather than re ect light.

Prerequisite: Anyone can bene t from a gem

of night.

Activation: The gem must be crushed, smashed,

or broken (a standard action).

Effect: The gem conjures a Large shadow elemental under

the control of the creature that broke the gem. The elemental

is banished back to the Plane of Shadow after 13 rounds.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate conjuration. CL 13th.

Construction:  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  summon  umbral

servant, caster must begin with a gem mined or found on the

Plane of Shadow, 750 gp, 60 XP, 2 days.

Weight: .

Price: 1,500 gp.

ORB OF SHADOW

Mystery  users  prize  orbs  of  shadow  as  wizards  do  pearls  of

power.

Description: An orb of shadow appears to be a black pearl

of average size and unusual luster.

Activation: Once per day, you can speak a command word

as a standard action to activate an orb. You must have the orb

in your hand; drawing it out is a move action.

Effect: Like a pearl of power, this item allows

a single extra use of a mystery, regardless

of whether that mystery functions as a

spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural

ability. The mystery must be of a particu-

lar level, depending on the orb. Different

orbs exist for recalling one mystery per day

of each level from 1st through 9th and for

the recall of two mysteries per day (each of a

different level, 6th or lower).

Aura/Caster Level: Strong transmutation.

CL 17th.

SHROUD OF NIGHT

A shroud  of  night  grants  you  a  number  of  shadow-oriented

defenses.

Description: A shroud of night is a very lightweight cloth,

made of a thin, gossamer material. It is always black or dark

gray. When worn, it ripples slightly even in the absence of any

wind or movement. The shroud wraps about the shoulders

but occupies space on the body as a vest, not as a cloak.

Activation: The de ection bonus is active constantly

while the shroud is worn. Using dancing shadows or shadow

skin requires a command word, such as nightfall or obfus-

cate.

Effect: A shroud of night grants you a +2 de ection bonus to

AC. It can also cast the mysteries dancing shadows and shadow

skin each once per day, on you only.

Aura/Caster  Level:  Faint  abjuration,  illusion.  CL 5th.

Greater  shroud:  Moderate  abjuration,  illusion  (shadow).

CL 11th.

caul  of  shadow,  voyage  into  shadow,  18,315  gp,  1,466  XP,  37

days.

Variants: A greater shroud of night grants a +3 de ection

bonus, and also enables you to use voyage into shadow once

per day (self only). To do so, you must utter a command word

(such as vanish) and wrap the shroud about yourself.

(two mysteries).

Variants:  Some  mys-

tery users prefer to set an

orb of shadow into a ring.

In  this  case,  you  need

never draw out the orb, but it occupies space on your body

as a ring.

ies).

RING OF NULLIFICATION

This ring protects you from one attack of almost any sort

per day.

Description: A ring of nulli cation appears to be a plain

band of dull metal with an onyx gem set

in it. When activated, the onyx glows as

brightly as a torch for an instant, then

it  darkens  to  jet  black  until  the  next

midnight.

Activation:  At  any  time,  you  can

specify the type of attack against which

the  ring  will  protect  you.  Doing  this

requires a standard action. The ring then

activates instantly and automatically should

you be targeted by that sort of attack.

Effect:  Once  per  day,  the  ring  nulli es

a single attack against you. You must have

declared ahead of time what sort of attack

will activate the ring. You can specify a

type  of  damage  (the  next  time  I  take

 re  damage  or  the  next  time  I  take

strength damage) or a method of attack

(the next time someone strikes me with

a  weapon  or  the  next  time  someone

casts a damaging spell on me). The ring

negates 20 points of hit point damage (or 2 points of ability

damage) from the next speci ed attack. It then goes dormant

for 24 hours.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate abjuration. CL 10th.

Ring of

nulli cation

Construction: Forge Ring, aura of shade, shadow skin, 1,600

gp, 128 XP, 4 days.

SHADOW MAGIC

MONSTERS

The Plane of Shadow boasts dark re ections of just about

every race to populate the Material Plane, as well as a number

of its own unique inhabitants. Presented here is a small selec-

tion of new creatures.

DARK CREATURE

Dark  creatures  dwell  on  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  sometimes

crossing  into  other  planes  where  the  barriers  between

dimensions are weak. Just as parts of the Plane of Shadow

resemble a strange, distorted version of the Material Plane,

dark  creatures  super cially  resemble  creatures  from  the

Material Plane. Dark creatures are shadowy, more elusive,

and spookier than their material counterparts. Gray and black

are their most common colors, and they almost never boast

bright hues such as white or yellow. Other creatures native

to the Plane of Shadow exist that have stronger or weaker

connections to the energies of the place (such as the shadow

mastiff) and do not follow this template.

The examples below use a goblin, a lion, and an umber

hulk as the base creatures.

This little humanoid has a  at face, broad nose, pointed ears, wide

mouth, and small, sharp fangs. Its skin is gray-green, and its hair

a few shades darker. It walks upright, but its arms hang down

almost to its knees.

Dark goblins are small humanoids that many consider little

more than a nuisance. However, if they are unchecked, their

great  numbers,  rapid  reproduction,  and  evil  disposition

COMBAT IN THE DARK

Shadowy  illumination  or  darkness  adds  a  different  flair  to

combat. For those with impaired sight, combat becomes less

certain; blows miss, and spells cant be targeted.

Page 164 of the Players Handbook covers the topic of vision

and  light,  but  the  information  is  worth  reexamining  because

most  of  the  creatures  presented  here  will  be  encountered  in

darkness or shadowy illumination. Some, such as the ephemeral

hangman and the shadow elemental, have the ability to provide

their own.

In an area of bright light, all characters can see clearly. A crea-

ture cant use Hide in an area of bright light unless it is invisible,

has cover, or has the hide in plain sight ability.

In an area of shadowy illumination, a character can see dimly.

Creatures  within  this  area  have  concealment  relative  to  that

character, if he or she doesnt have darkvision. Concealment has

two main effects: The subject of a successful attack has a 20%

miss chance, and creatures can make a Hide check to conceal

themselves.

In  areas  of  darkness,  creatures  without  darkvision  are  ef-

fectively blinded. In addition to the obvious effects, a blinded

creature has a 50% miss chance in combat (all opponents have

total  concealment),  loses  any  Dexterity  bonus  to  AC,  takes  a

2 penalty to AC, moves at half speed, and takes a 4 penalty

on Search checks and most Strength and Dexterity-based skill

checks.

Characters who have low-light vision (elves, gnomes, and

half-elves)  can  see  objects  twice  as  far  away  as  the  given

radius. Double the effective radius of bright light and of shad-

owy  illumination  for  such  characters.  For  example,  a  torch

provides bright illumination to a radius of 40 feet (rather than

20 feet) for a character with low-light vision, and it provides

shadowy  illumination  to  a  radius  of  80  feet  (rather  than  40

feet). Characters who have superior low-light vision can see

objects four times as far away as the given radius. Quadruple

the effective radius of bright light and of shadowy illumination

for such characters.

Characters who have darkvision (dwarves and half-orcs) can

see  lit  areas  normally  as  well  as  dark  areas  within  60  feet.  A

creature cant use Hide within 60 feet of a character who has

darkvision  unless  it  is  invisible,  has  cover,  or  has  the  hide  in

plain sight ability.

enable them to overrun and despoil civilized areas. Theyre

a common humanoid race in the Plane of Shadow and thrive

in that environment.

A dark goblin stands 3 to 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 30 to 35

pounds, a little bit lighter than its Material Plane counterpart.

Its eyes are usually dull and glazed, varying in color from

washed-out  red  to  faint  yellow.  A  dark  goblins  skin  color

ranges from pale yellow or orange to a sickly red; usually

all members of a single tribe are about the same color. Dark

goblins wear clothing of gray leather, which tends to be drab

and soiled.

Dark goblins speak Goblin; those with Intelligence scores

of 12 or higher also speak Common.

Most  goblins  encountered  outside  their  homes  are

warriors.

COMBAT

Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures has taught dark

goblins  to  exploit  what  few  advantages  they  have:  sheer

numbers  and  malicious  ingenuity.  The  concept  of  a  fair

 ght is meaningless in their society. They favor ambushes,

overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edge they

can devise.

Dark goblins have a poor grasp of strategy and are cowardly

by nature, tending to  ee the  eld if a battle turns against

them. With proper supervision, though, they can implement

reasonably complex plans, and in such circumstances their

numbers can be a deadly advantage.

Skills:  Dark  goblins  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Move

Silently  checks  and  Ride  checks.  Dark  goblin  cavalry

(mounted on worgs) usually select the Mounted Combat feat

in place of the Alertness feat, which reduces their Listen and

Spot modi ers to +0 and +2 respectively.

A dark lion

Treasure: None

Alignment: Usually neutral evil

Advancement: 68 HD (Large)

Level Adjustment: 

An enormous feline emerges from the darkness. Black, with a thick

mane like a wreath of smoke, it looks as though it were made of the

shadows from which it came.

COMBAT

Dark  lions  prefer  to  attack  from  surprise,  and  often  use

pack tactics. They rarely attack creatures more than one size

category larger than they are, unless they have the advantage

of numbers.

Pounce (Ex): If a dark lion charges a foe, it can make a

full attack, including two rake attacks.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a dark lion must

hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as

a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.

Rake (Ex): Attack bonus +7 melee, damage 1d4+2.

Skills:  Dark  lions  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Balance

checks, a +12 racial bonus on Hide checks, and a +10 racial

bonus on Move Silently checks. *In areas of tall grass or heavy

undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +20.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

DARK CREATURES

The dark template is designed to be simple and flavorful. You

can easily apply it on the fly to add shadow-based creatures

to  the  campaign.  Its  a  simple,  streamlined  version  of  the

shadow creature template (see Manual of the Planes page 190

and Lords of Madness page 167).

The dark creature template should either add +0 or +1 to a

creatures CR. Some creatures wont gain much benefit from

the template. For example, a white dragon already has dark-

vision, superior low-light vision, and immunity to cold. It gains

a small increase to its already good speed and the ability to

hide in plain sight. This template wont appreciably increase

its  CR.  On  the  other  hand,  a  creature  such  as  a  lion  gains

greater benefit and likely merits a +1 increase to its CR.

Its level adjustment is low, making it a reasonable cost for

PCs. You might allow a player character with a strong connec-

tion to the Plane of Shadow to acquire this template in lieu of

a class level.

A dark umber hulk

This  hulking,  powerfully  built  creature  looks  something  like  a

cross between a great ape and a beetle. The low, rounded head is

dominated by a massive pair of mandibles and rows of triangular

teeth. It has two big compound eyes like a beetles, with two smaller

eyes like an apes in between. Black and gray armor plates cover

virtually all of its chitinous body, whose scattered feelers resemble

sparse hair.

Dark  umber  hulks  are  massive  creatures  that  dwell  deep

beneath the earth of the Plane of Shadow. Ripping through

rock  as  though  it  were  light  underbrush,  they  rampage

continuously,  leaving  destruction  in  their  wake.  They  are

found most often under hills and mountains.

An umber hulk stands roughly 8 feet tall and measures

nearly 5 feet across, weighing about 600 pounds. An umber

hulk can burrow through solid rock at a speed of 5 feet. It

does not leave a usable tunnel unless it chooses to do so.

Dark umber hulks speak Terran.

COMBAT

An umber hulk can deliver blows powerful enough to crush

almost  any  enemy.  In  addition,  its  mandibles  are  strong

enough to bite through armor or exoskeletons with ease.

Despite its great bulk, a dark umber hulk is intelligent.

It uses lighting conditions to good advantage. If the combat

occurs in darkness, a dark umber hulk focuses its gaze  rst

on  opponents  who  can  obviously  see  itthose  that  have

darkvision. In brighter conditions, it is even more of a danger

because more creatures can see it and fall prey to its confus-

ing gaze. When brute force wont overcome its enemy, it is

more than capable of outthinking those who assume it to be

a stupid beast. Umber hulks often use their tunneling ability

to create deadfalls and pits for the unwary.

Confusing  Gaze  (Su):  Confusion  as  the  spell,  range  30

feet,  caster  level  8th,  Will  DC 15  negates.  The  save  DC is

Charisma-based.

CREATING A DARK CREATURE

Dark is an acquired or inherited template that can be added

to any creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature).

Dark creatures tend to be much duller in color, with more

gray  and  black  skin  tones  and  hair  highlights,  than  their

Material Plane versions. In general, they also weigh less, as if

part of their very substance was mere shadow stuff.

A dark creature has all the base creatures statistics and

special abilities except as noted here.

Size and Type: Type and size are unchanged. Dark crea-

tures encountered away from the Plane of Shadow have the

extraplanar subtype.

Speed: As base creature, +10 feet to all modes of move-

ment.

Special Qualities: A dark creature retains all the special

qualities of the base creature and also gains the following.

 Darkvision 60 ft.

 Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): Use the Hide skill even while

being  observed  (except  in  natural  daylight,  the  area  of  a

daylight spell, or a similar ettect).

 Resistance to cold 10.

 Superior low-light vision.

Skills:  Same  as  the  base  creature,  plus  Hide  +8  and

Move Silently +6.

Environment: Changes to Plane of Shadow.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature or same as

the base creature +1; see sidebar.

Alignment:  Usually  one  step  different  from  the  base

creature, rarely good.

Level Adjustment: +1.

From the shadowy passage extends a dark tentacle of inky blackness,

seemingly too large to  t within the corridor. A second follows, then

a third. Behind it, practically invisible in the darkness, is a trunklike

body formed solely of writing tentacles.

An ephemeral hangman is an aberration born of shadow, an

anomaly even among the strange creatures of the Plane of

Shadow. It consists of dozens of black tendrils located around

a  central  maw.  It  normally  stands  upright,  presenting  an

appearance almost like that of a dark and animate tree, but

it is capable of extending all its tendrils at once, spreading

itself almost  at. Using its ability to enter places ordinarily

Ephemeral hangman

inaccessible to a creature of its size, it hunts its preyliving

beings, particularly children and others too small and weak

to  ght back.

No one is certain how the  rst ephemeral hangmen came

into  being,  although  some  sages  suggest  that  they  were

originally the shadow selves of a creature such as the roper

somehow granted their own independent sentience.

An  ephemeral  hangman  is  about  12  feet  tall  when

standing  upright,  and  weighs  nearly  1,000  pounds.  These

creatures speak rarely; when they do so, they use a dialect

of Undercommon.

COMBAT

An ephemeral hangman is an ambush hunter. It prefers to

lurk in dark areas that would ordinaily be too small for a

creature of its size to enter, and then strike at unsuspecting

prey. It dislikes bright light, which prevents it from using

its regeneration, shadow pocket, and shadow step abilities,

and it  ees if confronted with sunlight or spells such as

daylight.

Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, an ephem-

eral hangman deals 1d8+6 points of damage.

Improved  Grab  (Ex):  To  use  this  ability,  a  hangman

must hit a creature at least one size smaller than itself with

its tendril attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a

free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it

wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and transfers the

opponent to its mouth as a free action, automatically dealing

bite damage. Alternatively, it can choose to constrict.

Regeneration:  In  areas  of  darkness  or  shadowy  illu-

mination, only spells with the light descriptor and searing

light deal normal damage to an ephemeral hangman. If it

loses a limb or a body part, the lost portion regrows in 3d6

minutes.  The  creature  can  reattach  the  severed  member

instantly by holding it to the stump. In areas of bright light,

its regeneration ceases to function, and all attacks do normal

damage.

Shadow Pocket (Su): In areas of darkness or shadowy

illumination, an ephemeral hangman can  t into a space

seemingly  too  small  for  it.  It  can   t  into  a  single  5-foot

square without taking any penalties for squeezing. It can

squeeze  into  an  even  smaller  space,  down  to  a  2-1/2-foot

square,  but  doing  this  imposes  the  standard  penalties

for squeezing through a space (DMG 29). When using its

shadow pocket ability, an ephemeral hangman gains a +4

circumstance bonus on Hide checks (not factored into the

statistics block).

If an ephemeral hangman is ever exposed to light brighter

than torchlight or a light spell while using its shadow pocket

ability, it is immediately shunted to the nearest open space

large  enough  to  hold  it,  taking  1d6  points  of  damage  for

every 5 feet so moved.

Step into Shadow (Su): In areas of darkness or shadowy

illumination, three times per day an ephemeral hangman can

use step into shadow as a shadowcaster of 11th level.

Slow (Su): Anyone who is struck or grappled by an ephem-

eral hangman must make a DC 18 Will save or be slowed, as

the spell, for 2d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Skills: An ephemeral hangman has a +8 racial bonus on

Hide and Move Silently checks. *It has a +4 circumstance

bonus  on  Hide  checks  when  making  use  of  its  shadow

pocket ability.

This being appears to be a muscled, wiry human. His skin is a dark

and dusky gray; his beard, pants, and vest of deepest black. His eyes

appear empty, naught but tunnels into the darkest night.

The khayal dwell apart from the rest of geniekind, whom they

view with varying degrees of antipathy. They are particularly

hostile toward the jann, with whom they have fought a hidden

and sporadic war for eons. Just as the jann are genies formed

of all four elements, sages postulate that the  rst khayal were

elemental spirits that materialized outside the four elements.

Lacking any form at all, they drifted around the periphery of

genie society, until they  nally bonded their emptiness with

the shadow of the elements. Whether this theory is accurate

or not, it is undeniable that the khayal consider themselves

apart from others of their kind.

162

Khayal  look  down  upon  most  other  races,  including

humans and other humanoids. They think of these creatures

as weak and delight in deceiving them. Deception is a  ne

art among the khayal, who seem to have dishonesty in their

blood.  They  are  consummate  liars,  but  tradition  demands

that should a lesser being ever confront one of the khayal

with irrefutable proof that the individual has lied to him,

the genie must then perform a service for that individual

in  penance  for  being  found  out.  Of  course,  some  khayal

cleave to this tradition with greater devotion than others.

On  occasion,  the  khayal  offer  to  assist  mortals  who  have

impressed themoften with their own abilities at decep-

tionor those with whom they share a common goal. In such

circumstances, the khayal always assumes a leadership role,

and might be surprised that the others dont simply accept

him as superior.

Khayal are usually the size of tall humans. Each speaks

Common,  any  one  elemental  language  (Aquan,  Auran,

Ignan, or Terran), and any one alignment language (Abyssal,

Celestial, or Infernal).

COMBAT

Khayal are courageous and swift combatants, con dent of

their prowess and easily offended. They consider the concept

of a fair  ght to be a ludicrous one and make frequent use

of their spell-like abilities, sneak attacks, and ambush tactics.

Khayal are willing to retreat in the face of a losing struggle,

but they  nd  ight humiliating and hold grudges against

those who drive them to it.

Improved Finesse (Ex): Khayal can apply their Weapon

Finesse feat to any weapon they wield one-handed, even if it

is not normally a light weapon.

Shadow  Bound  (Su):  Khayal  cannot  survive  for  long

away from the Plane of Shadow. If a khayal ever spends more

than 24 consecutive hours away from the Plane of Shadow,

it takes 2 points of Constitution drain. For each additional

hour beyond 24 hours that a khayal remains away from the

Plane of Shadow, it takes another 2 points of Constitution

drain.

Sneak Attack (Ex): Anytime a khayals target is denied a

Dexterity bonus, or when the target is  anked by the khayal,

the  khayal  deals  an  additional  3d6  points  of  damage.  See

the rogue class feature of the same name (PH 50) for more

details.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willblack candle, pass into shadow;

3/daydusk and dawn, sight eclipsed; 2/daybolster (DC 15);

1/dayumbral body (1 hour duration). Caster level 8th.

KHAYAL SOCIETY

Most khayal make their homes in the City of Onyx on the

Plane  of  Shadow.  This  is  a  community  of  twisted  spires

and high minarets, protruding in all directions and paying

no heed to the laws of architecture or physics. The Malik

al-Khayal, the King of Shadows, rules the khayal from the

Grand Palace of Endings. The citys marketplaces bustle with

all manner of races and travelers, individuals who make use

Khayal genie

of the Plane of Shadow as a byway between other planes, but

the center of the city is off limits to nonkhayal.

The khayal penchant for deception does not extend to their

own race. A khayal thinks nothing of deceiving a human, an

elf, or a member of one of the other genie races, but he never

lies to another khayal. Gender is a relative nonissue among

the khayal; the City of Onyx makes few distinctions between

its male and female citizens.

Other  khayal  communities  exist  across  the  Plane  of

Shadow. They operate on similar principles, although their

rulers usually claim the title of emir. Nobody but the true

king can claim the title of malik.

SHADOW ELEMENTAL

The  shadows  coalesce  into  a  single  point  of  pulsing

animated darkness. Trailing smoky wisps of gloom, the

vague form moves soundlessly closer, draining the light

as it passes.

Shadow  elementals  are  creatures  of  living  shade,

brought  into  being  from  the  stuff  of  the  Plane  of

Shadow. Appearing as nebulous forms of ever-shifting

gloom, they lash out at living creatures with smoky

tendrils as insubstantial as the darkness.

These elusive creatures rarely roam the Mate-

rial Plane of their own free will; when they do, it

is almost exclusively deep underground, where

light has never touched. More frequently, they

manifest as servants summoned from the Plane

of  Shadow.  Although  they  are  not  harmed  by

light, it causes them considerable discomfort,

and they do all they can to escape or snuff out

the hateful illumination. Similarly, shadow

elementals   nd  the  presence  of  living

beings not native to shadow to be disturb-

ing, although not nearly to the same extent

as  they  do  light  itself.  When  not  under  a

summoners control, they make every effort

to extinguish light and life both. They are as

obedient  as  any  elemental  when  summoned,  however,

so most shadow elementals only behave as evilly as their

masters permit.

Shadow  elementals  understand  the  commands  of  their

summoners, regardless of what language they speak. Beyond

this, however, these creatures never seem to communicate

in any manner, and it is unknown whether they know any

language at all.

THE INCORPOREAL SUBTYPE

Creatures that are out of phase with the Material Plane might

possess  the  incorporeal  subtype.  The  details  of  this  subtype

are  presented  below,  and  supersede  the  descriptions  in  the

Dungeon Masters Guide and the Monster Manual.

Incorporeal  Subtype:  Some  creatures  are  incorporeal  by

nature, while others (such as those that become ghosts) can

acquire the incorporeal subtype. An incorporeal creature has no

physical body. It can be harmed only by other incorporeal crea-

tures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons,

and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities. It has im-

munity to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells,

including touch spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to

ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive

energy, negative energy, force effects such as magic missile, or

attacks made with ghost touch weapons). Nondamaging spell

attacks affect incorporeal creatures normally unless they require

corporeal  targets  to  function  (such  as  the  spell  implosion)  or

they create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would

normally ignore (such as a web or wall of stone spell). Although

it is not a magical attack, a hit with holy water has a 50% chance

of affecting an incorporeal undead creature.

An incorporeal creatures natural weapons affect both incor-

poreal  and  corporeal  targets,  and  pass  through  (ignore)  cor-

poreal natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection

bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally

against it. Attacks made by an incorporeal creature with a non-

magical melee weapon have no effect on corporeal targets, and

any melee attack an incorporeal creature makes with a magic

weapon  against  a  corporeal  target  has  a  50%  miss  chance,

except for attacks it makes with a ghost touch weapon, which

are made normally (no miss chance).

Any equipment worn or carried by an incorporeal creature is

also incorporeal as long as it remains in the creatures posses-

sion. An object that the creature relinquishes loses its incorpo-

real quality (and the creature loses the ability to manipulate the

object). If an incorporeal creature uses a thrown weapon or a

ranged weapon, the projectile becomes corporeal as soon as

(table continued on next page)

it is fired and can affect a corporeal target normally (no miss

chance).  Magic  items  possessed  by  an  incorporeal  creature

work normally with respect to their effects on the creature or on

another target. Similarly, spells cast by an incorporeal creature

affect corporeal creatures normally.

An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has

a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least

+1,  even  if  the  creatures  Charisma  score  does  not  normally

provide a bonus).

An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid ob-

jects, but must remain adjacent to the objects exterior, and so

cannot  pass  entirely  through  an  object  whose  space  is  larger

than its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects

within  a  square  adjacent  to  its  current  location,  but  enemies

have  total  concealment  from  an  incorporeal  creature  that  is

inside  an  object.  In  order  to  see  clearly  and  attack  normally,

the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal creature

inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature

outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with

a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal

creature cannot pass through a force effect.

Incorporeal  creatures  pass  through  and  operate  in  water

as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or

take falling damage. Incorporeal creature cannot make trip or

grapple  attacks  against  corporeal  creatures,  nor  can  they  be

tripped or grappled by such creatures.

In fact, they cannot take any physical action that would move

or manipulate a corporeal being or its equipment, nor are they

subject to such actions. Incorporeal creatures have no weight

and do not set off traps that are triggered by weight.

An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard

with Listen checks if it doesnt wish to be. It has no Strength

score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks

and  its  ranged  attacks.  Nonvisual  senses,  such  as  scent  and

blindsight,  are  either  ineffective  or  only  partly  effective  with

regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an

innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when

they cannot see.

COMBAT

When confronting a threat or light-bearing creatures, shadow

elementals  slash  at  foes  with  freezing  tendrils  of  absolute

darkness.  If  possible,  they  retreat  from  combat  in  lighted

areas, or blot out light sources with dusk and dawn, to gain

the advantages of their shadow mastery power.

Shadow  Mastery  (Ex):  A  shadow  elemental  gains  a  +1

bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both it and its foe

are in an area of darkness or shadowy illumination. While

in an area of bright light (such as sunlight or that caused by a

daylight spell), shadow elementals take a 4 penalty on attack

rolls and damage rolls.

Dusk  and  Dawn  (Su):  Three  times  per  day,  a  shadow

elemental can use dusk and dawn, as the mystery. It has a

caster level equal to one-half its HD.

PLAYING A MEMBER OF THE

NIGHTSHADE COVENANT

As a Nightshader, you oppose light. This doesnt make you

evil, just committed to the organization and its ends. The

shadows protect and hide you, and you take comfort in their

depths.

Few established Nightshaders spend time in the Covenants

citadel.  Most  prowl  the  Plane  of  Shadow,  monitoring  the

movements of interlopers and quenching light wherever it

shines. Against forti ed enemies, you and your comrades

mount  terrorist  strikes,  slipping  in  under  the  cover  of

darkness, destroying light sources, kidnapping in uential

citizens, and being general nuisances.

Depending on your faction, you might receive orders from

the  zealous  Brotherhood  of  the

Blinded Sun, the Shadar-Kai Ini-

tiative, or even from one of the

many drow houses controlling

much of the Covenants leader-

ship. Each faction has different

interests, and you do best when

you know what they are.

COMBAT

You rarely  ght fair. Use dark-

ness to conceal your movements,

stage  elaborate  ambushes,  and

implement  whatever  tools  you

have to succeed. Against unsus-

pecting foes, you might suddenly

extinguish all light, slip behind

enemy lines and make liberal use

of shadow essence, sneak attacks,

or damaging spells.

Alternatively, you might band

with a few allies. Having a few heavy

hitters along can keep the tougher foes

at bay, giving you the chance to eliminate the enemy spellcast-

ers with ease. Even in these larger units, gather intelligence

about your enemy before striking.

When the situation demands a larger offensive, you might

be part of a scouting unit. Its your responsibility to  nd ways

in and ways out of enemy strongholds. Once youve examined

the battle eld and reported to your leaders, you and others

like  you  embed  yourselves  inside  your  enemys  territory,

striking from behind while your undead allies attack.

Symbol of the Nightshade Covenant

SHADOW MAGIC

ORGANIZATIONS

This section details three important organizations associated

with shadow magic.

NIGHTSHADE COVENANT

Light is my enemy. The sun is the hateful eye that reveals all secrets.

But no more, for we shall see its end.

Silious Roh, Nightshader

The Nightshade Covenant opposes the light and its presence

on the Plane of Shadow. Consisting of

drow exiles, shadar-kai, dark ones,

and  undead,  its  factions  threaten

to tear the group apart.

JOINING THE

NIGHTSHADE

COVENANT

The Nightshade Covenant recruits

shadowcasters  and  others  who

employ  shadow  magic.  It  accepts

rogues,  assassins,  and  rangers  of

questionable  morals,  for  these

characters have talents with stealth

and subterfuge.

Entry Requirements

Special: Native to the Plane of

Shadow or light blindness, light

sensitivity, or vulnerability to

sunlight racial trait

Spellcasters,  shadowcasters  especially,

lead the Nightshaders, directing the groups efforts to purge

the light. Stealthy characters are spies and terrorists, striking

where least expected. Finally, when muscle is needed, the

Covenant turns to rangers and occasionally undead.

NIGHTSHADE COVENANT

BENEFITS

Members of the Nightshade Covenant have access to certain

kinds of equipment and services.

The Covenant provides to its members magic items at a

reduced price, charging only 75% of the list price. They do

not manufacture or supply items that generate light.

The  Covenant  relies  on  a  steady  stream  of  information,

and so it monitors movement across the Plane of Shadow,

looking for potent spellcasters and unusual phenomenon.

As  a  result,  characters  joining  this  organization  gain  a  +2

bonus  on  Gather  Information  checks  and  on  Knowledge

(the planes) checks for information that speci cally relates

to the Plane of Shadow.

ADVANCEMENT

You never choose to become a Nightshader; rather, the Night-

shade Covenant chooses you. In the months preceding your

 rst contact, the organization places you under surveillance.

It puts you into dangerous situations to see how you react.

Spies  are  constantly  nearby,  always  watching,  weighing,

and  assessing.  Once  you  meet  the  Covenants  standards,

members kidnap and drop you off in some deadly and dark

hellhole, leaving you to  nd your own way back. This is your

 nal trial; success in escaping guarantees that you will gain

membership.

167

When you become a member, the Nightshade Covenant

expects you to continue as before, living your life, undertak-

ing adventures, and doing what you ordinarily do. As you

climb the ranks, you lose more and more of your freedom,

but you take command of units and missions.

Being a Nightshader requires you to choose a faction. Many

groups clamor for control over the Covenant, from extremist

elements who would see the Nightshade Covenant push into

other worlds, to the conservative and reasoned approach of

simply defending the Plane of Shadow. Occasionally its best

to take the middle road, using the in ghting between factions

to further your own agenda.

MISSIONS

As a Nightshader, you spend your time exploring the plane,

quenching light where you  nd it. You follow leads by talking

to natives and occasionally make raids into the strongholds of

light-lovers. Although you would rather escort these trespass-

ers off the dark plane, sometimes you have to  ght.

THE NIGHTSHADE COVENANT

IN THE WORLD

Nosy peons, telling us how to live and what to do . . . the Nightshad-

ers are a menace. We Votaries of Vecna kill them slowly whenever

and wherever we  nd them. 

Academician Drake, lich and Votary of Vecna

The Nightshade Covenant is an excellent nemesis or potential

ally for campaigns featuring extensive planar travel. Night-

shaders  can  act  as  guides  or  as  reccurring  foes,  harrying

PCs  as  they  cross  through  the  Plane  of  Shadow.  Factions

within the organization also want to extend their in uence

to other planes. They regularly send raiding parties onto the

Material Plane.

Nightshaders act independently or in small cells, with their

techniques  varying  depending  on  the  operative  or  group.

For example, a group of Nightshaders  ghts in Bale re, one

of the planes few populated cities, raiding it to destroy the

places light. Other groups patrol major byways, watching for

light-bearers and escorting them off the plane.

THE LICH MYSTERY USER

Mystery users do not truly cast spells, and are thus incapable

of becoming standard liches. The lure of undeath is insidious,

however,  and  evil  practitioners  of  shadow  magic  have  long

since  modified  the  rite  to  create  the  proper  phylactery.  The

result is the shadow lich, a form of the lich template available

to mystery users. A shadow lich is identical to a standard lich

in all mechanical respects, except that it casts mysteries rather

than spells. A shadow lich appears either as a skeleton made

of black bones, or as an emaciated being covered in ash-gray,

parchmentlike flesh. Many shadow liches use a gem of night

when creating their phylactery. Although they must shape the

gem  into  a  new  form,  the  magic  of  the  rite  allows  the  item

to retain its standard properties, as well as functioning as a

phylactery.

The  most  in uential  faction  in  the  organization  is  the

Brotherhood of the Blinded Sun. Its aggressive stance against

light pushes the organization to take a hostile attitude against

other planes. Members of the Brotherhood believe that at the

end of all things, shadow swallows light, and its their duty

to bring this about. Of course, not all Covenant members

subscribe to this view. Some believe they should serve the

plane and keep it pure, while others harbor a deeper grudge,

using the shadow to perpetrate their revenge against certain

races or creatures.

The competing view began with the Covenants founding,

when drow exiles  rst encountered the shadar-kai (see page

150  of  Fiend  Folio),  a  race  of  fey  creatures  whose  essential

nature is tied to the darkness. After a few bloody battles, the

two races forged a peace, bound in their combined hatred

of light-lovers. But the tensions did not end there. The drow

sought to use their newfound allies to mount an offensive

against their former homes. The shadar-kai and other mem-

bers of the Covenant, such as the dark ones (see page 37 of

Fiend Folio), were concerned only with preserving the dark

beauty of their native plane.

NPC REACTIONS

Individuals native to other planes, especially the Material

Plane, are unfriendly or hostile if they have previously suf-

fered at the Nightshade Covenants hands. Creatures native

to the Plane of Shadow see them as champions, being at least

indifferent or even friendly.

The Votaries of Vecna have no concern for the Nightshaders

and their mission, seeing the Darklands as the truest expres-

sion  of  the  planes  nature.  The  Covenant  doesnt  interfere

with the Votaries, for many of its cells use undead, but the

Votaries naked malevolence puts these two groups at odds.

NIGHTSHADE COVENANT LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (the planes) can research

the Covenant to learn more about it. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 15: The Nightshade Covenant works to destroy light

wherever it appears on the Plane of Shadow.

DC 20:  Dark  elf  exiles  and  shadar-kai  founded  the

Covenant.

DC 25: One faction, the Brotherhood of the Blinded Sun,

wants to extend the Plane of Shadow to all worlds, and its

highest-ranking members are dark elves.

A bardic knowledge check can reveal the same informa-

tion as these Knowledge checks, but in each case the DC is

5 higher than the given value.

NIGHTSHADE COVENANT CITADEL

This  fortress  bristles  with  towering  spires  of  basalt  stone,

each twisting upward into the perpetual gloom of the Plane

of  Shadow.  Situated  high  in  a  range  of  shadow-drenched

mountains, it exists in absolute darkness, with no lights and

nothing to suggest anyone lives there at all.

168

Blind gargoyles, maws opened wide, decorate the citadel.

No windows offer glimpses to the inside. Doors are weirdly

placed on the exterior walls, seemingly at random on every

level. Overhead, shadow dire bats  utter and squeak, looking

for prey.

The  citadel  stands  at  the  site  of  the  pact  made  between

the  drow  and  the  shadar-kai.  Built  from  the  dark  rock

prevalent throughout the plane, it is a rare testimony to the

architectural skills of the planes inhabitants. For those seek-

ing contact with the elusive Nightshaders, this stronghold

is an ideal goal, even if the road to this place is hidden and

perilous.

Even  after   nding  the  citadel,  characters  must  contend

with its guardians. Terrible things protect the stronghold,

from shadow beasts to Nightshader patrols and their shadow

mastiffs. The citadel has tight security, and the guards do not

tolerate trespassing. One or more of the Nightshade Cove-

nants leaders always inhabits one of the spires, directing the

activities of the organization for their sinister purposes.

THE NIGHTSHADE COVENANT

IN THE GAME

The Nightshade Covenant initiates all encounters with PCs, a

fact that helps the DM conceal the existence of the organiza-

tion, even if characters have previously explored the Plane of

Shadow or worked extensively with shadow magic. At some

point  characters  with  a  connection  to  shadow  attract  the

attention of this group.

Being a part of the Nightshade Covenant offers great oppor-

tunities for adventure. The more missions PCs undertake,

the greater their prominence, allowing them to make more

important decisions and perhaps eventually rise to a position

of leadership.

ADAPTATION

If your campaign setting doesnt feature a Plane of Shadow,

you can still use the Covenant. Maybe the Covenant operates

in the Underdark. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, it can

work just as described, but you can strengthen the connection

between the organization and setting by making the drow

members former priestesses and followers of Lolth, who  ed

the Material Plane after their deity fell silent.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

When constructing an encounter with Nightshaders, make

sure you feature a good mix of extraplanar characters, such as

shadar-kai and shadowswyfts. Also, encounters with this orga-

nization should always feature at least one shadowcaster.

EL 9: Silious Roh is a middle-tier member of the Covenant

TENEBROUS CABAL

Only we know the truth of shadow magic. All others are impostors.

Yezen Trueweave, Lord of the First House,

Parliament of Shadows

The Tenebrous Cabal is a powerful organization governing

the practice of shadow magic. In the Bleak Academy, it trains

apprentices and works to perfect their understanding of this

unusual form of magic.

JOINING THE TENEBROUS CABAL

The Cabal accepts mystery users and spellcasters who make

liberal  use  of  illusion  (shadow)  spells.  Those  who  have

169

adopted  shadow  magic  prestige  classes  make  particularly

good members.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Spellcraft 4 ranks

Shadowcasting/Spellcasting: Ability to use fundamentals

of shadow or ability to cast one arcane spell of the shadow

subschool

Would-be apprentices exhibiting a knack for shadow magic

present themselves before the governing body, the Parliament

of Shadows (or a representative body such as the one on Farks

Road; see page 175). If accepted, the student starts school,

exploring  every  facet  and  application  of  magic  in  excru-

ciating  detail.  During  these  early  years,

the  professors  develop  the  students

natural talents, guiding them toward

a particular path of study.

TENEBROUS CABAL

BENEFITS

As a full- edged academy, the Ten-

ebrous Cabal can access treasures

and  services,  of  which  its  mem-

bers take full advantage.

The Cabal loans magic items to

its members, up to a value of 1,000

gp  the members caster level.

Members  can  purchase  at  half

price any magic item that requires

a mystery or an illusion (shadow)

spell for its creation.

A member of the Cabal receives

free  passage  on  planar  galleys,

great constructs designed to breach

the  boundaries  and  travel  through

the Plane of Shadow to other destina-

tions.

PLAYING A CABALIST

The Cabal has a litany of rules and regulations, and the train-

ing is dif cult, but every harsh lesson hones your talents. As

you develop your skills, you relish the opportunity to impress

your betters, and maybe, one day, sit on the Parliament.

Being  a  Cabalist  is  much  like  being  a  part  of  a  wizards

guild. You have a responsibility to the order. In exchange for

your commitment, you receive unparalleled training, access

to restricted knowledge, and tutoring from the best scholars

of shadow magic available.

COMBAT

As an organization of casters, you rely entirely on magic in

a battle. Exploiting shadow magic as your principal mode of

attack and defense allows you to defeat the expectations of

your enemies.

You face the same limitations as other casters. Having fewer

hit points and few combat capabilities makes you vulnerable

in bigger battles. Pair up with a well-armed and well-armored

 ghter to enhance your defenses. Against bigger numbers,

make use of other Cabal members, combining your attacks

with theirs to eliminate small groups at a time.

ADVANCEMENT

The  Cabal  is  an  open  organization,  offering  membership

to  any  caster  with  the  proper  abilities.  After  joining,  you

undergo  rigorous  training  under  different  mentors,  each

specialized  in  a  different  subset  of  abilities.  This  process

allows the Cabal to learn your natural inclinations, guiding

you to the proper paths.

After a year of training, the school assigns you to a personal

mentor under which you study in smaller classes. Everything

you do during these formative years furthers your natu-

ral gifts and re nes them into worthwhile

abilities.

After  graduation,  you  maintain

connections  with  the  Cabal  for  the

rest of your life. You could spend time

teaching classes or even make a bid for

a seat in the Parliament. Even if you

are only tangentially connected to the

Cabal, you can always take advantage

of their resources.

MISSIONS

The  Cabal  wants  new  talent.  You

might  be  part  of  group  of  Testers,

traveling across the Material Plane

to   nd  children  with  the  ability  to

manipulate  shadow  magic,  and  if

so,  convince  their  parents  to  send

the  prospective  student  to  the  Bleak

Academy. Or, you might  ght against

those who misuse shadow magic, such

THE CABAL IN THE WORLD

Foolish  busybodiestheir  arrogance  is  eclipsed  only  by  their

ambition.

Leonel Felldawn, Regent of the Arcane Order

When incorporating shadow magic into an ongoing cam-

paign,  many  players  will  want  to  develop  mystery-using

characters or begin new ones. The DM can use the Tenebrous

Cabal to make this happen. Player characters could be part of

a secretive and larger body of mystery wielders, spreading out

into the world searching for others like themselves.

The  Tenebrous  Cabal  is  a  large  network  of  likeminded

individuals, all committed to the advancement of their craft.

Although all train at the Bleak Academy, only a few mystery

users and spellcasters remain there. Most leave, returning on

occasion to share information, learn new insights, or seek an

audience with the Parliament of Shadows.

Although members are free to come and go as they please,

as long as they are part of the Cabal, they are still subject to

the edicts from the Parliament. This governing body consists

of the very best, or at least the most in uential, members.

Symbol of the Tenebrous Cabal

as the Votaries of Vecna.

They convene two times a year to discuss news and manage

the tedious affairs of running and funding the Academy.

Most Cabalists concern themselves little with the politics

of their organization. Those with no eye for advancement, but

having an appreciable talent with shadow magic, stay on to

teach. Others travel the Material Plane, pursuing their own

interests but always watching for others who have the knack

for the art.

NPC REACTIONS

Traditional spellcasters view the Tenebrous Cabals structured

training  as  oppressive,  and  the  products  of  that  rigorous

training  as  brainwashed  fools.  Most  arcane  spellcasters

aware of the Cabal are unfriendly. Most good characters see

Cabalists as evil, thanks to the association that shadow has

with  foul  creatures.  Paladins  and  good-aligned  clerics  are

always unfriendly.

TENEBROUS CABAL LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

the Tenebrous Cabal to learn more about it. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 15: A Cabalist is a caster who specializes in a rare form

of magic called shadow magic.

DC 20:  The  Tenebrous  Cabal  operates  out  of  the  Bleak

Academy, a great school where apprentice shadowcasters are

trained.

DC 25: Cabalists are always searching for new talent to

add to their ranks, and so their members always watch for

children with some magical ability.

A bardic knowledge check or a Gather Information check

(in a community with a wizards guild) can reveal the same

information as these Knowledge checks, but in each case the

DC is 5 higher than the given value.

THE BLEAK ACADEMY

The heart of the Tenebrous Cabal is the Bleak Academy on

the  Material  Plane.  The  Cabal  makes  the  most  important

decisions there and trains future shadow magicians. Although

a large school, it remains well hidden.

The Bleak Academy lies inside a mountain, its entrance

marked by huge statues  anking a pair of black doors. The

entry  is  carved  with  glyphs  and  other  protective  magic.

Inside is a warren of halls and rooms, built in the dwarven

style of architecture. The Academy has four major regions.

The dormitories house the students and can hold one hun-

dred  apprentices  comfortably.  Classrooms  are  adjacent  to

the dorms, with the professors apartments  anking them.

The  nery of these rooms pales next to the Parliamentary

Hallthe darkened meeting room where the heads of the

school  convene.  This  place  is  like  a  great  bowl,  with  row

seating all around and facing the Speakers Platform at the

bottom.

The Bleak Academy was once a dwarven outpost whose

population fell to mind  ayers. After it had been abandoned

for hundreds of years, the Cabal cleansed the place of squat-

ters and assumed control. What the Cabalists dont tell the

students and many of the professors is that the caverns to

the Underdark remain open, and periodically some horror

emerges to snatch guards and students before retreating to

the depths to feast on its shrieking meal.

Aside from the high-level shadowcasters and other mys-

tery users responsible for instructing the apprentices, the

Academy  employs  many  guardians  (more  than  a  few  are

shadowblades) to watch the tunnels, the main gate, and patrol

the region surrounding the site.

THE CABAL IN THE GAME

If youre thinking about introducing shadow magic to your

campaign, the Cabal presents a great vehicle for this. The

Cabal can be an anonymous group not previously encoun-

tered. If a PC has interest in the shadowcaster class, he or

she  can  research  the  organization  and  seek  out  the  Bleak

Academy.

Once invested, PCs can climb the ranks as long as they are

suf ciently talented. Characters learn from the faculty, make

important allies, and, if they advance high enough, join the

Parliament to help guide the Cabal in new directions.

ADAPTATION

The  Cabals  welcoming  nature  helps  you  incorporate  this

group into many kinds of campaign settings with ease. In the

FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, the Cabal could be an outgrowth

of spellcasters who found a better and more ef cient way to

manipulate the Shadow Weave. In the EBERRON setting, they

could have ties to the Arcane Congress of Aundair, perhaps

even being a faction within it.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Should the PCs wind up opposing the Tenebrous Cabal, they

are in for a long  ght. The Cabal protects its own. Combat

against the Cabal usually means dealing with several shad-

owcasters, all determined to showcase their impressive array

of shadow magic abilities.

EL 10: Yezen Trueweave is one of the most famous instruc-

tors at the Bleak Academy. He has personally recruited more

than twenty shadowcasters into the group. Also a Third Lord

in the Parliament of Shadows, he enjoys much success in his

station.

VOTARIES OF VECNA

They killed us. They sent us beyond. But we are better for it.

Geoffrey Moer, Votary of Vecna

The Votaries of Vecna is a group of undead necromancers

who exiled themselves to the Plane of Shadow. In time, they

turned to the dark god Vecna and the secrets of shadow magic

to  advance  their  power.  These  spellcasters  are  thoroughly

evil, using others as tools for their wicked ends.

JOINING THE VOTARIES OF VECNA

The easiest way to join the Votaries is to be undead and to have

some talent with magic. The Votaries respect necromancy,

but  shadow  magic  is  their  true  calling.  The  Votaries  are

especially interested in having children of night (see page

117) join the group.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any evil

Skills: Spellcraft 8 ranks

Special: Undead type or worshiper of Vecna

Special: Caster or mystery user level 1st

Votaries allow only casters to join their organization, so

nearly all their members are liches. Even the lowliest mem-

bers are casters of some means.

A living candidate can approach the Votaries, and if that

individual is found worthy, the members kill him in a spec-

tacularly brutal fashion before sending the corpse into the

Darklands to be animated by that places negative energies.

The children of night are exceptions; their unusual nature is

a subject of great interest for many ranking members and, as

such, children of night who qualify to join the organization

are allowed to live.

VOTARIES OF VECNA BENEFITS

Membership  in  the  Votaries  provides  ample  bene ts  for

those with the power to use them, including access to magi-

cal goods and to some of the most dangerous secrets in all

the planes.

The Votaries know the location of many planar portals.

Membership in the organization grants knowledge of their

locations and destinations.

Votaries have access to all sorts of forbidden lore. In fact,

rumor holds that in the bowels of the Black Spire lies a great

library  lled near to bursting with ancient and terrible vol-

umes, including the dreaded book of vile darkness. Members

researching at the Black Spire gain a +4 bonus on Knowledge

checks.

PLAYING A VOTARY OF VECNA

To become a member of the Votaries of Vecna, you left behind

everything you previously cherished in a quest for power. You

now know terrible things, perverse magic that pushes your

physical shells boundaries. Undeath is a new road to walk,

and with each step, your power grows.

You  embrace  death,  sensing  the  magic  available  in  the

Darklands. Through the knowledge you attain, you develop

remarkable abilities with magic, becoming a terrible force

in the planes.

COMBAT

You dont seek battle; you keep to yourself and your studies.

If you must  ght, use spells and abilities to protect yourself

until you can escape and return later when your enemy lets

down his guard. Then, take your revenge.

Sometimes you cant escape. Your opponents can be crafty,

closing off all your tried and true routes. If so, use minions.

Always keep an assortment of undead servants at hand, or

failing that, a group of suitably cowed slaves. You wont be

sorry when your minions bear the brunt of the attacks, giving

you time to mount a suitable counterattack or to escape.

In larger battles, take advantage of other group members,

but take no risks. Let your compatriots shoulder the burden

of defense.

ADVANCEMENT

You are elitist, accepting only those who give their souls to

unlife or who are tainted by shadow. Even then, you dont

tolerate fools or lowly undead such as ghouls, zombies, and

other chattel. Those not meeting your lofty ideals  nd their

fate  at  the  bottom  of  the  Bleak  Seaa  vast  quagmire  of

necrotic sludge that kills and animates  esh.

172

Once you are a member, your existence is no easier. Every

day is a  ght for survival among your rivals vying for domi-

nance in the shadowy halls of their tower, the Black Spire.

The group is treacherous, its members turning on one another

in an instant. Survival, not training, is the objective.

With every passing year, you advance in prestige. Attacks

from other Votaries lessen as fear and respect blossom with

each thwarted attempt to destroy you. Dont let this respite

fool you. Expect more inventive threats by those who would

supplant you. Preemptively attack anyone who is experienc-

ing a meteoric rise, destroying the rival before it destroys

you.

MISSIONS

You  might  go  on  expeditions

to  recover  ancient  manuscripts,

such  as  lost  spellbooks  or  pow-

erful  tomes.  If  information  is

beyond reach, you work behind

the  scenes,  fomenting  war,

plague, or some other calamity

to  loosen  the  defenses,  giving

you  the  opportunity  to  snatch

the object of your search.

VOTARIES OF VECNA

IN THE WORLD

The Votaries are a threat to every-

one,  not  just  those  who  practice

shadow magic.

Liereal Darkweaver,

Lord of the Second House,

Parliament of Shadows

of heroes descended on the place, razing it and cleansing it

of the necromancers foul taint.

A few necromancers survived the attack by  eeing to the

Plane of Shadow, where they believed they would uncover

some secret knowledge that would allow them to return to

the Material Plane for revenge. In ghting and the in uence

of Vecna prevented such a return from occurring. Following

the dark gods promises of power, the necromancers found

themselves  in  the  Darklands,  where  the  taint  of  negative

energy was strongest. One by one, Vecna consecrated them

into undeath, ushering them to a new existence. In exchange,

he revealed to them the secrets of shadow magic.

In the years following, others sought out the Votaries of

Vecna  for  the  knowledge  they  held.

The Votaries found some individu-

als  worthy  of  membership  and

fed others to the Bleak Sea. Now

the  Votaries  pursue  knowledge

and stop at nothing to gain the

secrets they seek, even battling

among themselves.

NPC REACTIONS

Those  who  dont  hate  the

Votaries  of  Vecna  fear  them.

Even traditional clerics of the

Maimed Lord loathe this splin-

ter  group.  Living  creatures  are

automatically  unfriendly,  and

those who know of the Votaries

are always hostile.

The  Tenebrous  Cabal  opposes

the  Votaries  of  Vecna,  believing

the liches are exploiting shadow magic

for  evil  purposes.  The  Cabal  watches

for  activity  by  the  Votaries,  and  when  such  is  detected,  it

responds with deadly force.

Symbol of the Votaries of Vecna

The Votaries of Vecna is an organization

of depthless evil. Each member operates independently, as

every Votary commits to himself  rst and the organization

second.

Spawned from a group of necromancers who served the

infamous demilich Acererak, they  ed to hide, regroup, and

devise a plan to strike back. However, with the knowledge

awarded  by  Vecna,  the  Votaries  abandoned  their  goals  to

broaden their understanding of magic.

Strangely, they never had a strong connection to shadow

magic, at least not until their enemies sacked their home.

Originally, they clustered around a terrible hill shaped like

a  skull,  in  which  legend  held  a  terrible  demilich  lurked,

one whose lair was so riddled with traps that hundreds of

adventurers died there. Finally, a band of heroes overcame

the Tomb of Horrors, putting the lich, Acererak, to rest.

This victory gained nothing more than false hope, for after

the battle the very land swelled with negative energy, luring

hundreds of necromancers to practice their foul arts in the

shadow of the hill. Over the years, a perverse community of

ambitious necromancers gathered on its slopes, practicing the

dark arts, and slowly corrupted by the demilichs dark will.

Skull City, their community, would not last, for a new band

VOTARIES OF VECNA LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge

(the planes) can research the Votaries of Vecna to learn more

about them. When a character makes a skill check, read or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 15: The Votaries of Vecna are undead casters that use

a rare and unusual form of magic.

DC 20: The Votaries are a treacherous lot, but united in

their thirst for knowledge.

DC 25: Though they are servants of Vecna, some members

still pay homage to their former master, a demilich called

Acererak.

THE BLACK SPIRE

In one area of the Darklands on the Plane of Shadow is a vast

sea that, instead of water, contains a strange foul black ichor

formed from negative energy. Cast-off bits of corpses  oat on

the surface, forming a skin of  ngers, eyes, tongues, and more,

I

all animated by the unlife permeating the place. An island

lies in the center of the macabre Bleak Sea, and spiraling up

from it is a lonely tower called the Black Spire.

It would seem the tower should not stand, for its archi-

tecture  defeats  logic.  Warped  and  twisted,  it  looks  like  a

crones  nger, capped with a yellowed roof. Made entirely of

oily dark stone, the structure shifts frightfully, sometimes

for  no  apparent  reason.  Skulls  decorate  the  outside,  their

eye sockets  tted with green gemstones. The entrance is a

great green demons face, its mouth opened wide and  lled

with darkness. Its eyes sparkle in the gloom, suggesting foul

secrets beyond.

The most prominent inhabitants of the Black Spire are the

Votaries themselves, although their actual number is never

certain; ambushes and assassinations are all too common.

Patrolling the grounds are their undead servants. In addi-

tion, the Votaries enslave others inhabitants of the Plane of

Shadow,  using  them  for  menial  labor  or  for  experimenta-

tion.

VOTARIES OF VECNA IN THE GAME

Votaries of Vecna are enemies of nearly everyone. They are

a personi cation of the danger that mortal souls risk when

traf cking with dark gods and forbidden lore. By introducing

the Votaries into your game, the DM adds another dimension

to the god Vecna, de ning a splinter group of his worshipers

and revealing a new face of evil.

PCs opting to join the Votaries are unusual, for few charac-

ters can meet the criteria for membership. Those who do face

many challenges, threats from other members, and complex

intrigues, alliances, and betrayals as the members jockey for

dominance.

ADAPTATION

You can easily adapt the Votaries to other campaigns. In the

FORGOTTEN REALMS setting, substitute Shar for Vecna. As the

patron goddess of the Shadow Weave, she is a perfect deity

for this group. In the EBERRON setting, the Votaries could

be refugees from the Material Plane, driven to the Plane of

Shadow during one of the worlds great con icts.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Encounters  with  the  Votaries  reveal  their  feuding.  If  one

Votary  shows  weakness,  the  other  members  arrogantly

destroy  their  comrade  before  turning  back  to  deal  with

opponents. For this reason, encounters with this group can

be slightly more powerful than normal, as invariably some

Votaries turn against others during the battle.

EL  16:  Geoffrey  Moer  was  a  low-ranking  necromancer

before the sack of Skull City. Then only an apprentice, he

somehow survived the battle to join his fellows in their  ight.

Like the rest, he learned much, became a shadowcaster, and

then later a shadow lich. Though he claims allegiance to the

Votaries, he spends much time combing the plane to uncover

even greater secrets.

SHADOW MAGIC

ADVENTURE SITES

The following adventure sites focus on shadow magic. Each

location is fully detailed, but no speci c adventure hooks

or plots are included, which allows you to adapt them fully

for your campaign.

FARKS ROAD (EL 4)

In  Brindinford,  there  is  a  street  between  streets,  a  place

between places. Situated in West Hill, an eclectic quarter

attracts  all  manner  of  unusual  typesspellcasters  and

eccentrics who purport to follow the strangest beliefs. And

it all developed quite by accident.

The  lay  of  the  buildings  in  this  block  creates  a  narrow

and crooked alley that weaves behind the public streets. A

shadowcaster named Phineas Fark, who had an eye for such

things, saw potential in the alley. He thought to conceal the

side street by buying out the buildings all around, and rent-

ing out the buildings to unusual businesses not normally

attractive to locals. Meanwhile, he spread word of his plans,

drawing mystery users, illusionists, and others to the city. All

along the street, small shops and taverns opened, speci cally

catering to the needs of shadowcasters and their ilk. Although

Fark never resided in the area and visits only infrequently, it

has come to be known as Farks Road.

Farks Road is easy to  nd if you know where to look. A

detect magic spell reveals arcane marks placed along the roads,

identifying  the  way.  Furthermore,  the  businesses  on  the

street are always on the lookout for potential customers, so

it has a welcoming atmosphere. Finally, the Tenebrous Cabal

keeps an of ce here, attracting shadowcasters from all over

the world.

The locations described below are but a sample of the inter-

esting shops and sights that characters can explore. Because

Fark desires the greatest possible secrecy in this odd place,

he doesnt tolerate  ghting. Should a battle erupt, the locals

(which can be of any race or level you desire) use nonlethal

tactics to stop it before it gets out of hand. Troublemakers are

subject to modify memory spells and ejected out of the city.

The maximum gold piece limit of Farks Road is 50,000 gp.

1. THE WRINKLE

Nestled between two odd shops is the Wrinkle, an alley that

runs about 50 feet before ending at a wall. The street has an

unusual quality from which it takes its name. The cobbles are

peaked in places as if a root had snaked beneath the stones,

forcing  them  upward.  Boxes,  crates,  and  rain  barrels  give

the alley a cluttered look, although despite the jumble, it is

surprisingly clean.

Inscribed on the wall of the Bung (see area 3) is an invisible

arcane mark bidding those who can understand it to enter. At

the end of the alley is an illusory wall.

Farks Road is a shadowcasters playground

2. BARTLEBYS CURIOSITIES (EL 3)

A large shop stands next to the Wrinkle with a sign over the

door  proclaiming  it  to  be  Bartlebys  Curiosities.  Oddities

collected from all over the planes  ll the shelves and tables.

Vials containing raw elemental material, an incredible selec-

tions of gemstones, old books, talismans, amulets and so on

are all available hereif anyone can  nd them beneath an

equal amount of junk.

Even Bartleby, the owner, is strange. A shadowswyft, he

conceals  his  unusual  appearance  behind  a  veil  of  magic,

but  even  so,  his  movements  are  a  little  too   uid,  a  little

too inhuman to match his assumed shapea portly man

with dusky skin and a head of thick black hair. Detached

but  friendly,  Bartleby  is  not  sure  exactly  what  he  has  in

the shophe inherited the place from a powerful wizard

who met an unfortunate end a few years back. He is happy

to help to  nd something when he doesnt have what his

customer seeks. Bartleby works for Fark, watching for spies

or enemies while also looking for mystery users, spellcast-

ers, and adventuring types who would bene t from Farks

Road.  If  the  PCs  are  looking  for  something  speci c  and

improve Bartlebys attitude to friendly, he tells them about

the Hidden Road, suggesting they look there for the object

of their search.

Characters can purchase any magic item of a value up to

3,000 gp here, although  nding any given item requires a

successful DC 20 Search check.

3. THE BUNG

This squat building, named the Bung, has a crooked door

 anked  by  two  red-glass  windows.  A  tavern,  it  has  a  bad

reputation for attracting unsavory types such as mercenaries,

adventurers, and humanoids of questionable origin. Tables

and benches  ll the place, and curtained booths line the walls

offering privacy for those seeking it. A bar stands against the

back wall next to the kitchen door.

The Bungs employees are cold. They are ef cient, but they

lack a certain friendliness one would expect of a business.

4. HIDDEN ROAD

Beyond the illusory wall is a narrow street with several abrupt

and strange turns so tight that carts cannot navigate them. All

along the road, which has the same wrinkled appearance as

the alley entrance, are shops catering speci cally to the needs

of adventurers, each specializing in a variety of goods. Shops

dedicated  to  selling  potions,  wands,  and  scrolls  see  brisk

trade here. Given the clientele that Farks Road attracts, the

streets are full of strange and disturbing people. At any time

of the day, once can expect to see a mix of humans, elves, and

dwarves, as well as planetouched such as aasimars, tie ings,

and their rarer kin, to say nothing of the devils, yugoloths,

and other outsiders that visit to exchange news and goods.

Despite the tensions that would ordinarily result, the spirit of

commerce eclipses the natural predilections for violence.

5. CALICOS TOMES (EL 8)

This little bookstore has an incredible selection of books.

Although many of the volumes here are reference books on

such topics as architecture, lineages, and planar phenomena,

the shop has no shortage of spellbooks and other magical

grimoires. In fact, Calico has a few heretical treatises on pact

magic and one or two books on truenames, but he keeps these

under lock and key.

Calico is a quiet and unassuming man of middle years. He

wears a pair of spectacles that sit low on his nose, and his

watery blue eyes always seem distracted, as if hes thinking

about  someplace  or  something  other  than  whats  at  hand.

Still, he is a shrewd negotiator and commands a high price

for his books (+25% their normal value).

6. SHADOW HOSTEL

The largest building on Farks Road is made from  tted black

stone with a single door of mahogany bound in cold iron.

The Shadow Hostel is the centerpiece of this street. Inside

are several desks where minor functionaries sit toiling over

mounds of paperwork. In the center of the room stands a

raised platform painted with glyphs and sigils. Here, can-

didates can safely demonstrate their knowledge of shadow

magic or other talents for recruiters from the Cabal to assess

their worth. Those with the right skills receive an invitation

to attend the Bleak Academy.

The rest of this building consists largely of of ces, apart-

ments for those who work here, and a full kitchen and dining

hall. At any time, 1d6+6 shadowcasters of various levels and

races labor here.

7. COMMON GROUND (EL 5)

Nearly rivaling the Shadow Hostel in size, Common Ground

is  a  two-story  taproom.  The  main   oor  consists  of  a  large

room  lled with tables and booths. The decor is decidedly

magic-oriented, with paintings of famous casters who have

visited, old wands and staffs (no charges), and a few stuffed

monster heads hanging here and there. The tables themselves

are just as fantastic. Instead of table legs, petri ed goblins

keep them steady.

Rubious  Rallader  is  Farks  old  friend  and  adventuring

companion. When Fark informed him of his plans for the

Road, Rubious jumped at the chance to open a tavern. Its

important to Rubious that the tavern caters to anyone with

coin  to  spend,  so  he  always  has  a  mixed  and  interesting

crowd.

Middle-aged with thinning brown hair and matching eyes,

Rubious is easygoing, with a quick smile and a bawdy sense

of humor. He is missing his left pinky just below the second

knuckle, an injury he claims he got  ghting some creature

in some mysterious land (and the details of which change

with every telling).

NIGHTWATCH (EL 8)

A  great  rift  called  Nightcrawler  Chasm  snakes  across  the

Plane of Shadow. Named for the nightshades said to haunt

its depths, it is a terrible place, one best avoided. Strangely,

this chasm is also the site of one of the planes largest cities,

Bale re. Here, the dimly glowing lanterns create a haven for

travelers, offering respite from the oppressive bleakness of

the plane. Some, however, hate the light and stop at nothing

to extinguish it.

About 1,000 feet down inside the chasm lies Nightwatch, a

Nightshade Covenant outpost. Given its remoteness, the depth

of the chasm, and the things writhing in wicked madness far

below, the Nightshaders are con dent in their security. Those

who would assault this outpost must  rst contend with the

terrain. The walls have regular handholds (Climb DC 10), but

characters who do not have darkvision or a viable light source

take a 5 circumstance penalty on their skill checks. It is far

better to use  y spells and similar effects.

1. LANDING

Jutting  out  from  the  wall  are  the  shattered  remains  of  a

bridge. The bridge surface has collapsed in places, revealing

broken  support  pillars  beneath.  A  gloomy  archway  offers

access to a dark chamber. Perched on the lintel over the top

of the the arch is a lifelike statue of a foul, grinning demon,

its tail curling down.

Four bored shadar-kai guards are stationed just inside the

archway (see area 2) and have a clear view to the landing.

Assume the sentries take 10 on Spot and Listen checks for a

result of 18 (includes 1 penalty for distance) on either sort

of skill check. If the characters do anything to attract notice,

the sentries attack using ranged weapons  rst.

The ruined bridge portion is strong enough to hold the

PCs combined weight, but 25 points of damage causes the

whole thing to slide down into the yawning abyss after 1d4

rounds.

2. HALL (EL 7)

This hall is hewn from black rock. On either side, a door

stands closed in the center of the walls. The end of the hall

is concave, and at the center of the depression is yet another

door.

Four shadar-kai sentries stand guard here under orders to

attack any intruders on sight. The drow bat riders in area 5

automatically hear any sounds of combat and join the battle

in 1d3 rounds.

8. THE FORK (EL 5)

Farks Road has several alleys and side streets leading back

into  the  city  or  to  the  personal  homes  of  those  who  do

business  here.  After  turning  back  on  itself,  it  leads  past

several smaller structureshomes and apartments for the

localsuntil it comes to a place known as the Fork. Ordi-

narily, such a break in the road wouldnt be unusual at all;

however, this place is haunted.

Where the road turns southwest, it leads to a few more

shops and homes, but where it turns northwest, a malevolent

spirit,  the  remnants  of  a  mad  cultist  killed  by  a  group  of

adventurers, lairs here. During the day, this spirit poses no

threat, but at night the ghostly sorcerer manifests, preying

upon incautious travelers who get turned around in the street.

The ghost has learned not to attack locals, only travelers.

3. STABLE (EL 8)

This large and dark room reeks of guano. All along the north and

south walls, about 10 feet above the  oor, are long stout wooden

poles on which hang six enormous shadow dire bats, their hides

so black that only their shapes are visible. Strange saddles and

rigging sit on a rack near the far end of the room close to a dark

tunnel curving back toward the chasm.

This room is the Nightshaders stable. They use these crea-

tures to  y up to the surface, in ltrate the city, and return.

Eleven other shadow dire bats are absent. They are either in

use by individuals not currently in Nightwatch or they are

hunting the chasm for food. The Nightshaders can call them

back to the landing using a whistle that hangs on a spur of

rock in area 4. Each bat rider and each of the commanders

also carries such a whistle. When blown from the landing

or the bridge, the whistle calls the absent shadow dire bats

in 2d6 rounds (roll for each bat separately).

The shadow dire bats in this room will not attack unless

the PCs attack  rst.

The riders use this tunnel to  y in and out of Nightwatch.

Somewhat round, it opens onto the chasm.

5. MEETING HALL (EL 7)

Although dark, this large room contains several comfortable

chairs, a cooking pit and a spit, tables, and cabinets. Low-

ranking agents of the Nightshade Covenant spend much of

their time here when not in their barracks (see area 17). If the

PCs somehow conceal the noise of combat in area 2, three bat

riders relax here after a particularly tough mission.

Among the stores are three weeks of trail rations and an

equal amount of water, as well as assorted cutlery, plates, and

iron pots and pans.

6. SANCTUARY (EL 8)

An altar stands before the idol of a god of darkness (choose

one appropriate to your campaign setting). On the altar is a

large, dusty tome next to a metal cup and a sacri cial knife.

Two rows of benches stand before it. Black banners hang on

the walls, suggesting the perfection of shadow.

The cup and knife feature onyx and jet  ttings, each being

worth 500 gp. A trap protects the  oor in front of the altar.

Depressing the pressure plate causes the idols mouth to open

and vomit a cloud of insanity mist.

7. NEXUS (EL 7)

This room is a large hemisphere. Five iron doors lead deeper

into the complex. The center of this room is carved with the

symbol of the Nightshade Covenant.

8. CORPSE CORRIDOR (EL 9)

The  door  to  this  room  is  locked  (Open  Lock  DC 25).  If  a

character pauses to Listen (DC 10) at this door before open-

ing it, she hears terrible wet sounds of tearing and ripping

coming from within.

Beyond the door is a long tunnel, burrowed deeply into the

chasm wall. The horri c sounds come from the ten shadow

ghouls  feasting  on  a  political  prisoner  kidnapped  from

Bale re. Prodded by the prospects of more food, the shadow

ghouls abandon their prey and surge forward to attack.

10. JAILERS CELL (EL 7)

This  small  room  holds  a  cot,  a  small  writing  table,  and  a

writhing parts of corpses, all nailed to the  oor, walls, and

even the ceiling. Bilious Crow, the Nightshaders pet necro-

mancer and custodian of the shadow ghouls in area 8, lives

here with his rat familiar. Thin to the point of being gaunt,

he has a mop of greasy black hair and lips stained green from

his foul feasting.

The sack contains soiled clothing taken from his victims.

Aside  from  his  possessions,  this  room  holds  nothing  of

value.

If the PCs triggered the trap warding his lair, he will be

ready for them, casting an enervation spell at the lead charac-

while his rat familiar chews away contentedly on a twitching

tongue nailed to the  oor.

This long corridor is bleak and barren, the walls made from

the same dark stone found everywhere in this place. At the

end of the tunnel stand three iron doors. Each door bears a

bas-relief of a grotesquely twisted demons face, although the

center door is by far the largest and most awful.

Any loud noises automatically attract the attention of the

12. SUBCOMMANDERS QUARTERS

(EL 8)

This room is clean and spartan, with a simple cot, a writing

desk,  and  an  old  worn  chest.  Kriella,  a  subcommander  in

this out t, lives here. She keeps to herself, contemplating

the perfection of darkness. Kriella despises elves and half-

elves and attacks such individuals in preference over other

foes. On occasion, she accompanies the bat riders on their

raids in the city above them, so this room might be empty

(20% chance).

The chest contains three extra suits of dark clothing, 326

gp, an orb of black onyx worth 750 gp, and a collar of umbral

metamorphosis.

13. COMMANDERS QUARTERS

(EL 10)

As commander of this cell of Nightshaders, Morgrenix has

seized  every  opportunity  to  make  her  life  comfortable.  A

large bed stands against the north wall and dark indigo carpet

covers the  oor. Lengths of black silk hang from the ceiling,

concealing other details of this room.

Morgrenix cares nothing for the Covenant; she wants only

revenge for her people. She thinks the way to achieve this

is to invade the Material Plane and destroy the elves. She

bides her time in this forlorn outpost until she can advance

within the organization and steer the operatives to her way

of thinking.

The seven silk hangings, while not obstructions, are opaque

and block line of sight, providing concealment to all combat-

ants in the room. Pulling a curtain from its hanger requires

a standard action and a DC 8 Strength check.

14. SECOND SUBCOMMANDERS

QUARTERS (EL 7)

Maeleus knows his commander lacks commitment to the

vision  of  the  Nightshade  Covenant.  He  cares  nothing

for other worlds, even fearing them a little thanks to his

shadow curse. So, while his leader persists in pampering

herself and ignoring the mission at hand, Maeleus waits

for the opportunity to strike against her. Should the PCs

engage Morgrenix first, Maeleus answers to the sounds of

combat, but leaves the heavy hitters for the commander. If

the timing is right, he attacks the drow leader, butchering

her and any witnesses.

Maeleuss room is a wreck, nothing more than a  lthy straw

mattress on the  oor and a pile of old bones and moldy food

in the corners. It reeks of excrement and  lth. This chamber

holds nothing of value.

15. STORAGE

A short hall leads to this locked (Open Lock DC 25) stor-

age  room.  Inside  are  enough  supplies  to  feed,  water,  and

clothe twenty people for two months. Other items are four

masterwork longswords, four masterwork spiked chains, six

suits of masterwork studded leather armor, a dozen  asks

of acid, and two dozen smokesticks. Finally, an ironbound

lockbox  (Open  Lock  DC 30)  contain  eight  potions  of  cure

moderate wounds.

This long corridor stinks of mildew and mold. Four doors

line the east wall, and all are ajar. Behind each door is a small

empty bedroom, guest quarters for visiting members of the

Covenant or allies. These rooms contain nothing of value.

17. BARRACKS (EL 9)

This room holds fourteen bunk beds and an equal number

of  footlockers.  Two  large  tables  and  a  couple  of  chairs  sit

against the walls. This room serves as the barracks for the

common members of the organization. At any time, three

drow bat riders and four shadar-kai sentries can be found

here. Although they dont trust each other, they maintain an

uneasy peace through their commitment to shadow.

Loud noises from area 16 or its adjoining rooms are sure

to attract the guards attention. They respond in 1d4 rounds.

Otherwise, they attack any obvious intruders who stumble

into their room. Use the earlier statistics for the sentries and

bat riders.

The footlockers contain spare sets of clothing and personal

effects.

BLACK SPIRE (EL 18)

When the Votaries of Vecna crossed the wastelands of the

Plane of Shadow, they came upon the Bleak Sea, a vast body

of liquid rot on top of which  oated bits of animated  esh.

This sea of disembodied parts splashed against the shores,

twisting and writhing in eternal suffering. In the center stood

an island, and a strange and twisted tower whose structure

de ed all logic perched atop it.

Seeing  this  tower  as  a  sign,  the  group  crossed  the  sea,

many of their members succumbing to the cancerous  uid.

Once on the island, they learned their former master, the

demilich Acererak, once held this place, and through the will

of Vecna, they could continue their studies uninterrupted.

This situation changed once they explored the site, however,

as they uncovered ancient treatises on shadow magic. They

soon abandoned the necromantic arts for this new magic,

seeing it as the will of their god.

The Black Spire stands in a stretch of negatively infused

land called the Darklands. Living creatures spending time

here take 1d6 points of damage per round, crumbling to ash

when  reduced  to  0  hit  points  or  lower.  A  death  ward  spell

protects creatures from this effect.

The towers  oors are not level; each story careens from

side  to  side,  creating  sloping   oors  and  walls.  Given  this

nonsensical  stacking  of  levels,  the  tower  appears  highly

unstable (but it is not).

1. BLEAK SEA

Surrounding the island for nearly a mile in all directions is

a sea of unwholesome acidic  uid that seems to have a life

of its own. It bubbles and shifts, sending waves erratically

185

to the far shores and against the rocky island in the center.

To make matters worse, all across the top of this  uid is a

macabre skin of body parts, a harmless but disturbing morass

of heads, hands, ears, and feet.

Touching the liquid is dangerous; it deals 1d6 points of

damage to living things. Stone, crystal, other inorganic mate-

rials, and dead things are immune. Once the  uid contacts a

living substance, it immediately grows, covering the object

or creature that touched it. Every round after initial contact,

the subject must make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or

the  uid spreads further, dealing an additional 1d6 points of

damage. The liquid automatically kills a subject if it reduces

its hit point total to 0 or lower, and the victim rises in 1d4

days as a bodak. On a successful save, the  uid dries up and

 akes away.

A  successful  turning  check  that  would  affect  a  10  HD

creature completely cleanses a subject of the liquid.

2. THE LANDING

The island is not large, being little more than a jumble of

rocks pushing up out of the Bleak Sea. Dark, unwholesome

 uid stands trapped in depressions, churning in its awfulness.

In the center of the island stands the tower. A few darkened

windows allow other means of entry, but the surest means is

through the mouth of a great green demon head on ground

level. The tower has no door, just a deeper darkness spell to

conceal the interior of the structure. Permanent walls of force

protect the windows.

3. SPIRE ENTRANCE (EL 16)

A large chamber lies beyond the demons mouth. There, a

stair spirals upward, hugging the wall. Standing puddles of

dark  uid and stained cots, along with a pile of rotting meat

and bones, befoul the room.

The Votaries have enslaved a band of shadow grimlocks to

serve as guardians. Through their scent ability, these creatures

easily detect intruders and imposters. They attack the PCs as

soon as they enter.

4. AUDIENCE HALL

The stairs climb upward, stop at a landing, and continue up on

the other side. This entire story angles sharply to the south.

The landing overlooks a large auditorium, with concentric

seating. Each ring is lower than the last until the bottom,

where the PCs can see a podium. The walls depict religious

symbols of Vecna, and green, grinning demon heads are scat-

tered throughout. A large chandelier constructed of zombies

stitched together so it looks like a knot of arms and legs hangs

from the ceiling. Clutched in their hands (and held in place

by sovereign glue) are everburning torches.

This area is empty and contains nothing of value.

5. COMMON LABORATORY (EL 16)

The  steps  climb  past  another  landing  and  turn  further

up the tower. This level of the tower leans northeast. The

stairs  continue  on  to  area  6.  The  landing  opens  into  a

large room rimed with frost. Laboratory equipment lines

tables standing against the walls. The cold emanates from

a huge block of ice at the rooms center. The ice is black,

dark, and pitted, but a successful DC 20 Spot check reveals

a  dark  humanoid  shape  inside.  The  creature  inside  is  a

nightwalker, imprisoned in ice by the liches who are ter-

ri ed of its power.

The block is 1 foot thick, has a break DC of 35, hardness 8,

and 90 hit points. It has vulnerability to  re. If the PCs deal

45 or more points of damage to the block, the nightwalker

breaks free, hissing with pleasure as it attacks.

6. BLACK HEART

The  stairs  end  at  this  round  room,  which,  like  the  entire

level, bends directly east. One door stands on either side, and

directly across, another set of stairs leads up to area 8. This

room is cold and dark, with a faint smell of embalming  uids

in the air. Other than the odd odor, this room is empty.

7. VOTARY QUARTERS (EL VARIES)

The doors leading out from area 6 each open onto identical

semicircular halls lined with more doors on the outer wall.

Each door leads to the private quarters of one of the Votaries,

powerful  lich  shadowcasters.  Only   ve  rooms  (randomly

selected) are currently occupied.

All rooms here are identical, simply bare cells for the Vota-

ries to use when they spend time in contemplation. Sounds

of combat elsewhere in the spire do not attract attention, for

the liches are accustomed to treachery in this place. Still,

intense  ghting on this level draws a curious glance or two,

which leads to all the liches emerging from their lairs.

Lesser Liches (5): hp 91; use statistics for Geoffrey Moer

on page 174.

8. THE VESICLE

The stairs end in a square room. Like on the level below, two

doors stand on either side, while another set of stairs climbs

up to room 13. The  oor slopes down toward the northwest.

The walls here are strange, glistening with moisture held

back  by  some  invisible  membrane.  What  lies  behind  the

membrane  is   uid  taken  from  the  surrounding  sea.  The

membrane is a permanent wall of force. Perceptive charac-

ters (those succeeding on a DC 15 Spot check) note a few

chunks of  esh suspended in the dark waters, twitching as

if alive.

Foolhardy  PCs  who  dispel  the  wall  of  force  (caster  level

18th) release the  uid, splashing everyone inside the room.

See room 1 for details on the effects.

9. HALLS

Both of these area are short, narrow corridors ending at a

large skull with emeralds  tted for eyes. The emeralds are

worth 1,000 gp each. A door stands in the center of each

wall on either side of each hall. These areas are otherwise

empty.

10. INTERROGATION ROOM (EL 20)

The door to this room is locked (Open Lock DC 35). Inside

is a powerful balor demon, forced to serve the Votaries for

 ve hundred years by means of a carefully negotiated greater

planar binding spell. Its duties consist of torturing captives

and learning whatever facts it can for Crestian (see area 13).

The demons victims rarely last for long as it immolates them

in its excitement. The balor resents its binding, so it does

what it can to betray and disrupt its masters plans. If the

188

PCs do not immediately attack the demon and attempt to

parlay  rst, it quickly divulges all it knows about Crestian

and the Votaries, warning the characters that the lich lord

has a sphere of annihilation.

If the PCs attack the demon, it  ghts to the death, destroy-

ing them and as much of the tower as it can.

Balor (1): MM 40.

11. INCINERATOR (EL 11)

The door to this room is locked (Open Lock DC 35) and is

extremely hot to the touch (dealing 1d6 points of damage

per round to those touching it). If anyone opens the door,

waves of heat boil out through the portal.

This area is where the Votaries discard dangerous captives,

information, or their trash. This room houses a permanent

gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Characters entering the

room take 1d6 points of  re damage each round. A DC 40

Search  check  uncovers  a  +2  adamantine  holy  undead  bane

greatsword, once owned by a paladin who fell  ghting the

Votaries  and  succumbed  to  death  after  ten  years  of  slow

torture. The balor tossed his corpse and his equipment into

this room, but the weapon survived the  re unscathed.

12. PRIVATE LIBRARIES

These rooms are identical. Inside each is an extensive library

consisting of several volumes of forbidden knowledge. The

collection  between  both  rooms  consists  of  two  hundred

volumes, each valued at 300 gp. Hidden in the southwest

room is a tome of leadership and in uence +3.

13. THE CAP (EL 22)

The stairs end in a large chamber sloping slightly downward

toward the north. Shelves line the walls in all areas but one.

There,  a  desk  is  littered  with  dozens  of  unusual  objects.

Trunks, chests, and cabinets  ll much of the  oor space, but

nothing compares to the globe of perfect swirling darkness

suspended at the far end of the chamber.

This  is  the  chamber  of  Crestian,  the  current  lich  lord

and leader of the Votaries. After recently acquiring a sphere

of annihilation, he sequestered himself here to study it and

unlock its secrets. He believes, perhaps foolishly, that this

object is the ultimate expression of the shadow and death,

the union of shadow magic and the destructive energies of

necromancy. Lacking a talisman of the sphere, Crestian is loath

to use the sphere unless he faces a signi cant threat.

hen you speak a word in the true,

original  language  of  the  universe,

you  tap  the  power  of  creation

itselffor  the  ability  to  describe

something is the ability to de ne it.

A wielder of truename magic under-

stands  a  language  older  and  more

fundamental  than  all  othersa

mother tongue whose words and

phrases are the building blocks of the universe.

Except  perhaps  the  gods  themselves,  no  one  can  speak

this original tongue. Its possible that no one ever did speak

ittruenames might be more a set of instructions encoded

into  a  language,  rather  than  a  means  of  communication.

But through careful study, the masters of truename magic

can understand a smattering of this fundamental language.

When such masters name a thing aloud in the tongue of true-

names, they can exert unparalleled control over the creature

or object they name. They can command it, alter it, renew

it, or destroy it simply by speaking their desire aloud. The

cosmos seems to hear a truenamers instruction and reorders

the universe in accordance with the spoken words.

Truenamers engage in ceaseless study of the world around

them,  learning  the  truenames  of  as  many  creatures  and

objects as they can. As they advance in their studies, they can

uncover the personal truenames of friends or foes, enabling

still more powerful magic.

Some  traditional  spellcasters  also  dabble  in  truename

magic.  By  incorporating  a  bit  of  truename  speech  into

their spells, they can achieve targeted but powerful effects

beyond the reach of traditional arcane or divine magic. The

language of truenames is  endishly dif cult to pronounce,

however, so such spells press the skill of their casters to the

utmost.

If you want to cause the very earth to tremble when you

say thremcheumalach-turaabachnir! then truename magic is

for you. If you want to force a babau demon to do your will

simply because you know its truename is Kyethel-cramuothan-

praduvashedeo, then truenames can be your path to power.

LESSER TRUENAME MAGIC

Truename magic already exists in a limited form in every

D&D campaign. It appears in the form of the command and

power word spells. These spells originate from the power of

truenaming, using a single word to wreak mighty magical

effects. Though powerful, they are merely spells and lack the

reusability and  exibility of real truename magic.

THE METHODS OF

TRUENAME MAGIC

Truenames  encompass  reality  in  its  entirety.  Everything

in  the  world,  everything  that  ever  was,  and  presumably

everything that ever will be has a truename. Even the most

wizened  truename  sage  doesnt  know  every  word  in  the

language of truenamesor even most of them. While the

grimoires of truename masters have thousands of truenames

within  them,  truenames  undoubtedly  exist  beyond  their

knowledge, truenames that await rediscovery through magi-

cal exploration and experimentation.

Truenames are an entirely oral language. Merely writing

down a truename has no particular power. Only speaking

a truename aloud can reorder the universeassuming the

speaker says the name properly. The language of Truespeech

is composed of hundreds of consonant sounds and thousands

of delicately in ected vowels. The rhythm of the speech is

likewise essential. A book might require several pages just

to describe a single truename, because the speaker needs so

much guidance in pronunciation.

The  language  of  truenames  is  more  than  just  a  list  of

names. Most of the language consists of the truename equiva-

lent of nouns. In terms of game effect, theres a truename for

orc, for door, and for sword. But from the truenamers

point of view, its much more complex. Theres a word for

orc berserker charging toward me, a word for ironbound,

locked wooden door with something unknown on the other

side, and a word for  ame tongue longsword wielded by an

ally. Even an apprentice in the magic of truenames knows

hundreds of these truenames.

Truenames  can  also  name  actions,  such  as  vanish,

sharpen,  or  destroy.  When  these  actions  are  combined

with the truenames that describe nouns, a truenamer can

remake the universe in accordance with his wishes. Com-

bining  the  truename  for  destroy  with  the  truename  for

orc  can  cause  harm  to  the  orc  charging  toward  you,  for

example. Combining sharpen (yichthopratanuul-khadaash)

with sword (gremenethhradoshikell) can make the weapon

more potent against your foes. Vanish (bratranajaeleithal)

and human (hrudokkelenth) can make an ally invisible.

In addition to truenames that describe nouns and those

that describe actions, there exists a third category: personal

truenames.  These  are  the  equivalent  of  proper  names,

uniquely identifying a single creature. If hrudokkelenth is

human, for example, then Thandralkru-plennevichthuul might

be Bartellus the Necromancer. Most people dont know their

own  personal  truenames,  and  even  dedicated  students  of

truename magic dont know more than a few personal true-

names.  (All  truenamer  students  learn  their  own  personal

truenames,  however.)  Expert  spellcasters  and  powerful

monsters might know their own personal truenames, and

they certainly try to keep others from learning their personal

truenames. Knowing someone elses personal truename lets

you describe that individual perfectly to the universe. When

you can describe someone perfectly, you gain a better ability

to affect him or her with the language of Truespeech.

TRUENAMES AT THE TABLE

If youre a player or DM with access to truename magic, you

can employ the following techniques to bring your character

to  life  at  the  table.  Some  techniques  are  roleplaying  tips,

while others just help the game  ow around the table more

smoothly.

When you use a truename, actually use the truename.

Saying  I  daze  the  orc  with  an  utterance;  its  DC  18,  is  a

pretty ordinary thingand you picked truename magic to

set yourself apart from the ordinary. Exclaiming I disrupt

thee, khedalavaurmihau! is something more appropriate

for a truenamer.

Go ahead and spout cool-sounding mystic gibberish, and

dont be worried if you cant replicate it. Truenames by their

very nature are speci c, so each situation should call for a

new truename. It takes a little practice to just roll a dozen

weird syllables off your tongue, but once youve had a little

practice, your fellow players will swear that youre speaking

a language they simply dont know.

If spontaneous gibberish is problematic, spend 10 minutes

before each session coming up with a brief list of syllables or

nonsense words and write them down. Mix and match them

in different ways during the course of the session when you

make a Truespeak check. Add to your list as you gain more

levels, to re ect your character learning new truename abili-

ties or utterances, and by the time a half dozen sessions have

passed, you will sound like a practiced truenamer.

Give your character a fondness for spoken language.

Characters who use truename magic have spent countless

hours  saying  insanely  complicated  tongue-twisters  over

and over again; their very power depends on understanding

and using language (even if its the secret language of the

universe).

That love of language might affect a truename-using PCs

speech in other ways. You could give your character a vast

vocabulary in mundane languages to mirror his large reper-

toire of truenames. He might pepper his speech with words in

other languages such as Elven or Draconic. He could occasion-

ally lapse into gibberish as he mentally shifts gears from the

truename language into one used for  communication.

Or you could deliberately play against type. Imagine the

taciturn truenamer who uses few words because hes aware

of the power they hold. But on the rare occasions when he

speaks, the very world reshapes in the wake of his words.

Figure out your own personal truename. As a true-

namer, you need to know this name, if for no other reason

than to know if someone else has discovered it. All truenam-

ers learn their own personal truenames as part of their  nal

stage of apprenticeship. For other truename-using characters,

its an interesting bit of character background. Your personal

truename is nothing less than the secret name the universe

knows you by, so take a moment to come up with something

mysterious and cool-sounding once you discover your own

truename.

Consider being a multilingual translator and spokes-

man. When you start using truenames, your fellow players

might expect your character to have a facility for language

in other ways. While this isnt necessarily the case, you can

meet their expectations by learning a number of languages

with either the Speak Language skill or spells such as tongues.

Characters who use truenames also  nd themselves thrust

into the role of party spokesperson as well: Lets let the guy

with the powerful words do the talking for us. Skills such

as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motiveto say

nothing of your own willingness to banter with NPCswill

go  a  long  way  toward  making  such  interactions  fun  and

effective.

Know how object saving throws work. They dont get

much play in the average D&D game, but theyre an impor-

tant part of truename magic, especially if you are a truenamer

who has begun to delve into the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool.

Whether youre the player of a truenamer or the DM who

describes the result of utterances on objects, make sure you

understand the object saving throw rules on page 166 of the

Players Handbook.

After a few sessions, you will know those rules like the

back of your hand. After that, its just a matter of the DM

making sure she knows what the caster level is of a magic

item and whether 2 + 1/2 its caster level is better than the

saving throw bonus of the creature holding the item.

INCORPORATING

TRUENAMES

Using truename magic in your game doesnt require you to

change anything. You can use a truename NPC or monster at

the game table tonight, and you can take ranks in Truespeak

or a level in the truenamer class when you attain your next

level. If you prefer to make truenames an integral part of

your ongoing campaign, this chapter gives you the tools to

do so.

Dabbling: Adding a truename-using character to an ongo-

ing game requires little extra preparation on the part of a DM.

A truenamer is just a character class with a number of spell-

like abilities that rely on a successful skill check to function.

Truename spells are just like their traditional counterparts,

only they too require a skill check to function. The rest of

the PCs can be blithely unaware of the nature of truename

magic; to them its just another esoteric magic discipline.

If youre a player, you can give your character the power of

truename magic through two possible paths. First, you can

take levels in the truenamer class (described on page 198).

You will function like a spellcaster, but you use utterances

and recitations to create magical effects. As you attain more

levels,  you  will  learn  more  truenames  and  discover  more

ways to employ them to overcome challenges.

If youre already a spellcaster, you can learn the Truespeak

skill  (described  on  page  195),  then  learn  truename  spells.

These  spells  function  just  like  regular  spells  (with  levels,

components, and all the game rules youre used to). However,

they incorporate one or more truenames into their verbal

component, so you can achieve powerful effects on a true-

named target. Theyre also somewhat more dif cult to cast;

you must succeed on a Truespeak skill check for a truename

spell to function as intended.

Whether you opt for the truenamer class or start casting

truename  spells,  you  will  want  your  Truespeak  bonus  to

be as high as possible. The Truename Training feat makes

Truespeak a class skill for you, so you can get the maximum

ranks in the skill rather quickly. Skill Focus (Truespeak) is

likewise helpful, for obvious reasons.

Crescendo: You can also start out by dipping a toe into the

waters of truename magic as described above, then increase

your level of dedication to truename magic as your interest

level dictates.

Prestige  classes  are  available  for  both  truenamers  and

members of other classes who can use Truespeak, includ-

ing the acolyte of the ego and the brimstone speaker. Those

characters who know even a smattering of truenames can

likewise  become  disciples  of  the  word  or   endbinders.  A

number of feats (described on pages 228231) augment any

characters ability to use truenames effectively.

Truenames will start to have an important place in your

characters schemes. They will investigate the personal true-

names of their archrivals, and they will spend time trying

to  gure out which truenames will be particularly useful in

overcoming challenges.

The Truename Campaign: If youre a Dungeon Master,

you can create a campaign where truename magic is central

even if the PCs dont realize it at  rst. You can incorporate the

rules in this book gradually by  rst hinting at the existence

of  organizations  such  as  the  Collectors  of  the  Lexicon  or

the Kingmakers. Perhaps the PCs will eventually make an

enemy of one of those organizations, or of a truename-using

monster such as a garbler or a loquasphinx. Confronted with

the strange magic of a truenamer or a logokron devil, the PCs

will seek out more information about these truenames the

villains keep talking about. To protect themselves, they might

start taking ranks in Truespeak, casting spells that protect

against truename magic, and so on.

However you incorporate truenames, you can use the same

system to resolve their effects. A character who wants to use

a truename must complete two steps: learning the truename,

then speaking it aloud.

TRUENAME GLOSSARY

This book isnt large enough for a list of truename equiva-

lents  for  every  word  youre  likely  to  use  in  your  D&D

gameand  it  wouldnt  be  much  fun  to  read  in  any  case.

So theres no glossary for your character. But a player using

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

THE ROOTS OF TRUENAME MAGIC

The magic of names has been a theme in fantasy literature for as

long as the genre has existed. Several attempts have been made

to bring this theme into the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, but Tome

of Magic represents a major effort to implement a thorough rules

set. When work on the truename magic system began, the goal

was to allow players to create characters who use and master the

power of truenames. Characters would learn the names of spe-

cific things, slowly build their repertoire of names, and through

those names, expand their control over the world. Staying true to

the literary roots of truename magic, however, would not have

meshed well with the game aspect of roleplaying.

For  example,  a  truenamer  who  knows  the  name  for  goblin

might have a great deal of power in encounters with goblins, but

that same truenamer might be powerless against other kinds

of creatures and therefore wouldnt have much fun outside a

goblin lair.

The truename magic system needed to move away from the

tropes of fantasy. Instead of making the nouns of truenaming

be the rare words of power (a noun might be the truename for

goblin),  the  rules  system  presented  here  instead  makes  the

verbs  the  rare  and  powerful  parts  of  truenames.  That  means

that whether the encounter is with a goblin or a troglodyte, the

truenamer has a chance to participate, but like other classes is

not sure of the success or magnitude of an attack or ability.

193

the  truename  magic  rules  will  discover  terms  unique  to

this sort of magic.

Lexicon:  One  of  three  categories  of  truenames.  Utter-

ances can be found in one of these lexicons: The Lexicon of

the Evolving Mind, the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool, or the

Lexicon of the Perfected Map. Truenames that name personal

truenames arent found in lexicons.

Personal Truename: A truename that uniquely describes

a  speci c  individual,  analogous  to  a  proper  name  such  as

Lidda Tosscobble.

Recitation:  The  repetition  of  the  speakers  personal

truename, subtly altering the cadence for a particular magic

effect.  Truenamers  use  recitations  to  restore  their  bodies

and minds to an original state; most recitations eliminate

poison, disease, and similar ongoing harmful effects. Recita-

tions are available to those with ranks in the Truespeak skill

through feats, although truenamers receive access to some

recitations through bonus feats.

Truename: A description of a creature (hal ing), place

(forest), thing (dagger), or action (destroy), delivered in

the primal language of the universe. Each truename is exceed-

ingly speci c and incredibly dif cult to pronounce aloud.

Truename Spell: A spell that incorporates one or more

truenames into its casting. Truename spells always have a

verbal component, for obvious reasons. All the usual rules

for spells apply, but the spellcaster must also succeed on a

Truespeak check for the spell to work. Truename spells can

be cast by arcane or divine spellcasters, depending on the

individual spell.

Truenamer: A class devoted to the study of truenames.

Truenamers use utterances and recitations to achieve potent

magical effects.

Truespeak: The skill, introduced in this book, of correctly

pronouncing truenamesespecially in stressful, distracting

situations such as combat.

Utterance: A combination of a truename that describes

an action with a truename that describes the subject of that

action. This is the most important class feature of the true-

namer class.

LEARNING

TRUENAME MAGIC

Despite the fact that truenames are  endishly complex and

often require several alphabets just to write down, learning

a truename is the easy part.

Basic Truenames: Studying entire categories of truenames

is largely the province of characters with the truenamer class.

Throughout their career, they learn utterances, which they

can use to describe everything in the world. Utterances thus

allow truenamers to affect creatures, objects, and even loca-

tions with their words. The choice is theirs which utterances

they study from each of the three lexicons. Utterances are also

unique because mostspeci cally, those from the Lexicon of

the Evolving Mindcan be spoken in reverse, making each

two words in one. One truenamer might learn the utterance

dealing with healing and destruction, which would allow him

to heal and harm creatures. A truenamer can also learn from

the Lexicon of the Perfected Map, which allows her to name

and affect places. She might be able to shake the earth beneath

her enemies feet or make the terrain in an area easier for her

allies to traverse. Learning new utterances from a particular

lexicon is a class feature of the truenamer class. Its automatic,

but its not comprehensive. Even a 20th-level truenamer wont

know all the utterances in all the lexicons.

Spellcasters with ranks in the Truespeak skill automati-

cally  know  the  truenames  that  are  part  of  the  truename

spells  they  cast;  its  a  normal  part  of  the  spell-learning

process. But because the truenames are woven into the spell

itself, spellcasters cant extract the truenames and use them

outside the context of the spell. Thats the province of the

truenamer.

The basic truenames that form utterances are described in

countless grimoires found in the libraries of truenamers. The

Analects of Vondellak, The Spotted Libram, and Hadrakks Tome,

for example, are three multivolume collections of truenames

devoted to the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, the Lexicon

of the Crafted Tool, and the Lexicon of the Perfected Map,

respectively.  (Lexicons  are  described  in  greater  detail  on

page 234.)

Personal  Truenames:  The  personal  truename  that

uniquely describes an individual creature is much harder

to  learn,  because  most  creatures  powerful  enough  to  be

aware  of  their  personal  truenames  are  smart  enough  to

know  that  a  personal  truename  should  be  kept  secret.

But  magical  researcheverything  from  poring  over

dusty tomes to asking the gods for divine guidancecan

sometimes uncover a personal truename. The process is

uncertain  and  time-consuming.  But  the  payoff  is  often

worth it; when you know a creatures personal truename,

it  is  easier  to  affect  it  with  your  utterances  than  if  you

were using a normal truename. The method of discerning

creatures personal truenames is described in Truename

Research on page 196.

Lots of powerful truenamers keep lists of personal true-

names they have learned, and some of these have survived

through the ages to inform future generations of truenam-

ers.  The  Merciless  Catalog  of  Fiends  and  Splendor  beyond  the

Veil are two encyclopedias of personal truenames that cover

important  ends and powerful undead, respectively. Copies

194

are kept under lock and key in many a master truenamers

library.

Your Own Personal Truename: Most people dont know

their own personal truename. Indeed, you would get a blank

stare if you asked the local blacksmith what his truename

was. But its often useful to know what your truename is. Your

personal truename can be a conduit for powerful bene cial

spells. A truenamer gains access to recitations through bonus

feats, and can take more recitation feats as he attains more

levels. Recitations can restore the truenamer to his original

condition, wiping away poison, disease, or ongoing magical

effects in the process. Members of prestige classes such as

the acolyte of the ego and the disciple of the word rely on

an intimate knowledge of their own personal truenames as

a path to inner power.

You  can  learn  your  own  truename  through  magical

divination  (described  in  Truename  Research  on  page

196).  Truenamers  automatically  learn  their  own  personal

truenames  at  1st  level;  doing  so  marks  the  end  of  their

apprenticeship.

When you learn your own truename, take a moment to

write  it  out.  Anything  of  eight  or  more  syllables  will  do.

You  can  match  the  sound  of  your  personal  truename  to

your personality. If you have an aggressive character, make

up a personal truename with a lot of explosive consonants

and  guttural  sounds.  If  your  character  has  a  more  serene

countenance, use a lot of vowel blends and softer-sounding

consonants. Thakrasch-Voor-Grakattranqi is a good personal

truename for a bold, often angry character, while the per-

sonal truename of Aurash-Hrietuli-Oursselleam hints at a more

contemplative character.

SPEAKING A TRUENAME

Learning a truename is a straightforward process; you either

 gure it out through magical research or know it automati-

cally from a spell or from the truenamer class feature. Once

you know a truename, that knowledge cant easily be taken

away from you. However, just because you know the personal

truename of the demon prince Orcus (no mean feat, by the

way) doesnt mean you have him under your thumb. You must

be able to speak the truename aloud.

No ordinary language comes close to the complexity and

demanding exactness of truenames. A simple sound such as

a long a can be delivered with a hundred slight variations

of pitch, timbre, and in ection. How the sounds blend into

one another carries meaning of its own. Every consonant

sound youve ever heardand some completely foreign to

your earsis represented. Even the simplest truename can

have up to a dozen syllables demanding a speci c cadence

and  polyrhythm.  Pronouncing  any  truename  properly

takes hours of practice and the height of concentration, and

personal truenames are even more complex.

Apprentice  truenamers  often  strain  their  throats  into

hoarseness or silence just mastering basic vowel sounds, as

their harsh masters demand hours of repetitive pronuncia-

tion drills: Aaaaaoooah, aaaaaoooah, aaaaaoooah and so

on. Even bards accustomed to delivering epic poetry or long

dramatic works quickly  nd their vocal cords exhausted by

the precise demands of Truespeech. Many a failed apprentice

is unable to muster a voice louder than a whisper; truespeak-

ing  can  even  permanently  damage  the  vocal  cords  if  you

attempt too much too soon.

Speaking a truename aloud is the hard part of the process,

and  doing  so  requires  a  successful  check  in  a  new  skill:

Truespeak.  Using  Truespeak  requires  a  skill  check,  and

calculating the DC for such a check usually follows the same

formula.

To speak a creatures truename aloud, you must succeed

on a Truespeak check with a DC equal to 15 + (2  the

creatures Challenge Rating). If youre saying the truename

of a PC, the DC is 15 + (2  the PCs Hit Dice). When youre

speaking a creatures personal truename, the DC increases

by  2  because  those  truenames  are  more  linguistically

complex.

To speak a magic objects truename aloud, the Truespeak

DC is 15 + (2  the items caster level).

To speak a nonmagical objects truename aloud is a DC 25

Truespeak check.

Usually you make a Truespeak check to speak an utterance,

use a recitation, cast a truename spell, or use a unique special

ability (such as those used by some of the new prestige classes

found  later  in  this  chapter).  The  check  doesnt  require  an

action of its own; its part of the action (usually a standard

action)  of  the  utterance,  recitation,  spell,  or  ability.  Rules

for using recitations and utterances  are found on pages 231

and 232.

The consequence for failing a Truespeak check is that the

utterance, recitation, spell, or ability doesnt work. Creatures

with the Personal Truename Backlash feat have truenames

that are dangerous to utter aloud. If you fail at a Truespeak

check involving a creature with Personal Truename Back-

lash, the universe itself punishes you for getting the name

wrong (see the feat on page 229 for details).

Use this skill to master the tortuous pronunciation of true-

timing, and vocalizations foreign even to the most multilin-

195

time you deliver an utterance or make a recitation. If youre a

spellcaster with a truename spell at your disposal, you make

a  Truespeak  check  to  cast  the  spell  properly.  Members  of

prestige classes such as the  endbinder, acolyte of the ego,

and brimstone speaker make Truespeak checks to activate

their class features.

You can also make a Truespeak check as a free action to

identify an utterance being spoken, even when its not your

turn. The DC of this check is equal to the DC to speak the

utterance you wish to identify.

bonus on Truespeak checks for saying your own personal

truename.

Because saying a truename is such an idiosyncratic, exact-

ing task, you cant take 10 or take 20 on Truespeak checks.

Action:  Speaking  a  truename  is  a  standard  action  that

provokes attacks of opportunity.

Try Again: Yes.

Synergy: If you have 5 ranks in Truespeak, you gain a +2

bonus on any Knowledge checks made to conduct truename

research.

Of the standard classes, only the truenamer has Truespeak

as  a  class  skill.  Other  characters  can  avoid  the  high  cost

of cross-class skills by taking the Truename Training feat

(described on page 229).

This skill doesnt represent your ability to learn and know

truenames so much as it represents your ability to say them

aloud. Each truename is complex and exacting enough that

just overhearing a truenameeven a personal truename

doesnt give you any particular facility for pronouncing it

yourself. That takes continuous vocal exercises and endless

study.

Check:  You  can  pronounce  the  truename  of  a  creature

(such as orc, horse, or red dragon) by succeeding on a

Truespeak check with a DC of 15 + (2  the creatures CR).

For  creatures  that  dont  have  Challenge  Ratings,  such  as

player characters, use a DC of 15 + (2  the creatures HD).

Speaking the truename of a magic item has a DC of 15 + (2

 items caster level).

Speaking  a  creatures  personal  truename  increases  the

DC of the Truespeak check by 2. You gain a +4 competence

TRUENAME RESEARCH

Most truenamers learn truenames from the three lexicons

that de ne a truenamers craft. But an important category

of  truename  doesnt  exist  within  the  lexicons:  personal

truenames.  A  normal  truename  de nes  you  in  terms  of

your  creature  type  and  what  youre  doing,  such  as  orc

berserker  or  lurking  mind   ayer.  But  a  personal  true-

name de nes you and you alone: Gratharz son of Morach

or Ythrinik Rumikauptraal of the Hydramaw clan. Your

truename might change depend on what youre doing, but

your personal truename never changes, even if you undergo

personal  upheaval  or  magical  transformation  (such  as  a

polymorph spell).

Personal truenames are harder to say (+2 DC on the True-

speak check). But they enable a truenamer to deliver more

devastating utterances. If a truenamer knows the personal

truename of a creature and uses his utterances against it, the

save DCs of any utterances that incorporate the creatures

personal truename increase by 2, and the truenamer gains a

+2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome that creatures

spell resistance, if any. Personal truenames are also a neces-

sary component in many truename spells that arcane and

divine spellcasters with the Truespeak skill employ.

Only creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher

have  personal  truenames.  This  excludes  most  animals,

vermin,  and  oozes,  for  example.  Some  undead  and  con-

structs likewise have no Intelligence and thus no personal

truenames. If the Intelligence of a creature with a personal

HOW COME MY NAME

GETS HARDER TO SAY?

Master truenamers and grand spellcasters with the Truespeak

skill have noticed an intriguing phenomenon: Some peoples

truenames  get  harder  to  pronounce  as  they  get  older.  The

phenomenon  isnt  widespread,  but  nearly  every  truenamer

mentor  can  tell  the  tale  of  an  apprentice  who  goes  out  to

explore  the  world.  When  the  apprentice  returns  years  later,

his  truename  hasnt  changed.  But  it  has  become  harder  to

pronounce,  less  tolerant  of  slight  quavers  and  minuscule

disparities in timing.

Truename  scholars  note  that  many  who  exhibit  this  phe-

nomenon eventually become important leaders, great heroes,

or  sinister  villains.  They  speculate  that  the  universe  is  taking

a greater interest in them as they achieve more. As their true-

names become more important to the universe, they become

harder to say.

(Mechanically, what is happening is that the young truenam-

ers  are  gaining  Hit  Dice  as  they  attain  more  levels,  and  thus

the DC to speak their truename increases as well. Because Hit

Dice are an abstraction that doesnt exist in the game world, the

NPCs have only a vague sense of whats going on.)

half  (see  the  feat  description  on  page  229),  or  by  three-

truename lore.

The research process is interruptible at any time. If you

need to go on an adventure, just keep track of how many

successful checks youve made thus far, then resume your

research when your schedule allows.

Obscure Creatures: Ironically, it can be somewhat easier

to  research  the  personal  truename  of  a  powerful  dragon

than  a  lowly  gnoll  hunter.  Historical  annals  will  periodi-

cally mention a great wyrms deeds, and previous truename

researchers  might  have  made  progress  on  the  truename

(and recorded that progress). But its likely that no one has

ever cared about the gnoll hunters personal truename, so

mundane texts wont be much help. Creatures with less than

10 HD are considered obscure unless they have historical or

political importance. Unless youre using magical divinations

to aid your research, you cant even attempt the Knowledge

checks.

The  Knowledge  check  to  learn  a  personal  truename  is

such as a headband of intellect), it does not temporarily gain

DISCOVERING A

PERSONAL TRUENAME

You can  nd out someones personal truename using a combi-

nation of mundane and magical research techniques. But the

search can be an expensive, time-consuming process. Even

access to the Merciless Catalog or Splendors beyond the Veil isnt

suf cient, because those encyclopedias are neither complete

nor completely accurate. (Shortly after the Merciless Catalog

of Fiends was disseminated, for example, many clever devils

intentionally spread fake copies with their own names badly

garbled but the personal truenames of their rivals intact.)

Shorter-lived  characters,  such  as  humans,  probably  dont

have their personal truenames recorded in any important

text, so discovering such an individuals truename becomes

an  exercise  in  detective  work  using  genealogies,  magical

divinations, and other esoteric techniques.

It  takes  a  successful  Knowledge  check  in  the  relevant

subskill to discover a personal truename (although 5 ranks

of Truespeak grant a synergy bonus to any such checks, and

the Truename Research feat grants additional bene ts). The

DC uses a familiar formula: 15 + (2  creatures CR), or 15 +

(2  HD) for creatures such as PCs that dont have Challenge

Ratings. If you have the bardic knowledge class feature, you

can substitute bardic knowledge checks for the Knowledge

check.

Just one success is rarely enough to discover a truename.

You need a number of successes equal to 1/2 the creatures

Hit Dice (minimum 1).

Each Knowledge check to discover a personal truename

takes one week and costs 1,000 gp (for meditative incense,

access to private libraries, and so on). Cut the weekly cost

in half if you have unfettered access to a major library, such

as one owned by a wizards college, a scribes guild, or the

archives in a major temple to a knowledge god. Someone

with the Truename Research feat also cuts these costs in

THE TRUENAMER

I name you  thelehbmarechthalahh, tyrant. I rend asunder

your petty spells with bhauo-yual-mannarae. And I bring you

to your knees with gorvotyrmu-llautha. With only three words,

I have you at my mercy.

Sekhen, Master of Truespeech

Truenamers study the words that comprise the fabric of exis-

tence. They seek to unravel and comprehend the mysteries of

the Multiverse by learning the truenames of as many of its

components as possible. A truenamer learns new truenames

as he progresses in level, which he can use as utterances to

manipulate  the  world  around  him.  All  truenamers  know

the  basic  words  of  Truespeak  that  allow  them  to  describe

creatures that they encounter, so the new words they learn

enable them to alter those creatures in very speci c ways. As

they continue to advance, they also learn to describeand

thus affectinanimate objects and even places, which are

more dif cult to describe using truenames.

If  you  want  to  understand  the  secret  language  of  the

universe, the truenamer class is for you. By delving into the

truenames of everything that surrounds you, you can reshape

reality itself. You will speak words of power so potent that

the cosmos will rearrange itself to match their meaning.

MAKING A TRUENAMER

At  rst, you will only be able to use Truespeak in a few ways,

so your power will necessarily be limited. You will know

only a few truenames, and more important, your ability to

pronounce them is imperfect. You will encounter situations

when you arent as skilled with Truespeak as you need to be,

and you say ghaurtahlakranammio when you meant to say

ghaurtalhakranammio. As a low-level truenamer, you might

be able to increase an allys effectiveness in combat or freeze

an enemy in place, but you wont be commanding demons

or altering the landscapeyet.

As you attain more levels, your power grows in three main

ways. First, you gain access to new lexicons, expanding your

abilities to in uence items and places, as well as creatures.

Second, you learn new utterances, each of which gives you

a new way to affect creatures, objects, and places. Third, as

you gain ranks in the Truespeak skill, you will naturally be

able to pronounce truenames more reliably, especially the

truenames of more powerful creatures.

In many ways, youre like a spellcaster. You would rather

deliver  an  utterance  or  a  recitation  than  attack  with  a

weapon. By choosing the path of the truenamer, you give up

a degree of  exibility compared to a spellcaster. You have a

set of utterances and recitations you can make, and this set

doesnt change from day to day the way a wizard can change

her arsenal of prepared spells. But because you arent casting

spells, you dont have to worry about spell slots, spell levels,

or  running  out  of  your  most  precious  resource.  You  can

continue to speak utterances and recitations as long as you

can continue to succeed on Truespeak checks.

Abilities: Intelligence and Charisma are the most impor-

tant ability scores for you. Intelligence is the relevant ability

score for the Truespeak skill; a high Intelligence will help you

learn and remember the long strings of syllables and exact

pronunciation of the truenames you know. Charisma provides

the force and conviction behind your words. In game terms,

it sets the save DC for many of your utterances.

Other ability scores matter less, because you would much

rather deliver an utterance than swing a sword or shoot a bow.

If youre spending points on a physical ability score, consider

Constitution because it provides extra hit pointsa resource

everyone runs short on eventually.

Races:  The  knowledge  of  truenamesand  how  to

manipulate themcan be found among most races, but, as

with the magic of wizards, the lore of truenamers requires

a certain scholarly bent. Truenamers also spend signi cant

time in libraries and other places of knowledge, and thus

are more rare among less civilized (or at least, less urban)

races.

Humans  and  dwarves,  especially,   nd  truename  magic

appealing. Dwarves  nd truename magic like a delightful

puzzle  to  be  solved:  combinations  of  individual  words  of

power, when put together a certain way, capable of achieving

a speci c effect. Scholarly dwarves are on the forefront of

combining genealogy and truenames, discovering how the

personal truenames of dwarves within the same clan have

some common syllables.

Humans living in the centers of major cities have access

to some of the libraries and other resources so essential to

learning truenames. Theyre also natural explorers, crossing

the globe in search of new things to name. The division of

truenames into three lexicons is largely a human invention,

and now all truenamers enjoy the convenience of the three

classi cations.

Truenamers can also be found among elves and gnomes,

although  such  characters  tend  to  prefer  a  more  organic

approach to magic. Hal ings and half-orcs frequently lack

the discipline or access to sources of knowledge to make true-

name magic feasible, although some clans and tribes might

include  members  with  ranks  in  Truespeak,  and  perhaps

knowledge of a few truename spells.

Alignment:  Truenamers  have  no  preferred  alignment.

Both the blackest hearts and the purest souls seek to under-

stand the cosmos by mastering truename magic. Evildoers

want  to  reshape  the  universe  for  their  own  endsor  for

those of their dark masters. The defenders of all that is good

want  to  use  truenames  to  create  a  more  just,  compassion-

ate  world.  The  rigid  complexities  of  truename  linguistics

appeal  to  lawful  characters,  while  chaotic  characters  love

how truename magic confounds societys rules as an agent

of fundamental change.

Starting Age: As wizard.

CLASS FEATURES

Your class features involve learning new utterances, attaining

more  knowledge  among  the  three  lexicons,  and  learning

recitations that use your personal truename.

Weapon and Armor Pro  ciency: You are pro cient with

simple weapons and with light armor, but not with shields.

Known  Personal  Truename:  You  know  your  own

personal truename. You cannot pronounce it automatically;

doing so requires a Truespeak check with a DC equal to 15 +

(2  your Hit Dice) + 2. Because its your personal truename,

you get a +4 bonus on the Truespeak check.

Utterances (Sp): You have the ability to speak utterances,

powerful combinations of truenames that can alter the world

around you in fundamental ways. Utterances exist in three

lexicons: The Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, the Lexicon of

the Crafted Tool, and the Lexicon of the Perfected Map. You

begin play knowing one utterance from the 1st level of the

Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, and you gain one utterance

from this lexicon at each truenamer level you attain. You gain

access to higher levels of utterances at the levels indicated on

Table 33. When you gain access to higher-level utterances,

you can choose an utterance from that level or from a lower

level, if you wish.

Each utterance represents hundreds of truenames in your

repertoire. When you gain the word of bolstering, for example,

you say thanthankuul-hrasechni when youre delivering it on

your elf ranger ally and yanu-shankriniqalaasha when youre

delivering it on your gnome rogue friend.

The Dif culty Class for a saving throw against your utter-

ances is 10 + 1/2 your truenamer level + your Cha modi er.

Beginning at 4th level, you also gain access to the 1st-level

utterances of the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool, allowing you

to  alter  objects  with  your  truenames.  You  gain  access  to

200

higher-level utterances from this lexicon at 7th, 11th, 15th,

and 19th levels, as indicated on Table 33.

Beginning  at  8th  level,  you  gain  access  to  the  1st-level

utterances  of  the  Lexicon  of  the  Perfected  Map,  allowing

you to alter places with your truenames. You gain access to

higher-level utterances from this lexicon at 12th, 16th, and

20th levels, as indicated on Table 33.

See  page  232  for  the  rules  on  successfully  speaking

utterances.

Knowledge Focus (Ex): As a truenamer, you spend a great

deal of time studying the world around you in an effort to

learn new truenames. At the levels indicated on Table 32,

you gain a permanent +3 bonus on a Knowledge skill of your

choice. Each time you gain this ability, you can apply it to a

different Knowledge skill, or to the same Knowledge skill,

if you want to focus on a particular area of expertise.

Truename Research:  At 6th level, you gain Truename

Research as a bonus feat. See page 229 for details.

Bonus Recitation Feat: By repeating your own personal

truename over and over with a particular in ection, you can

achieve various healing effects starting at 8th level. Choose

one recitation feat from those given later in the chapter. You

must still meet the prerequisites for the bonus feat to take it.

At 15th level, you gain a second bonus recitation feat.

See the Named (Su): Beginning at 9th level, you have

the ability to see a creature from afar whose personal true-

name  you  know.  This  ability  works  as  the  scrying  spell,

but does not require a mirror or pool of water to function.

Instead, you must make a Truespeak check for the creature

as normal (see page 196 for information on making a True-

speak check to affect a creature). If your check is successful,

the creature does not get a save to resist the ability, but you

can  view the subject for only 1 round. You can use this

ability once per day.

Sending (Su): Beginning at 13th level, you can speak to

creatures whose personal truenames you know from a great

distance. You must make a successful Truespeak check (DC

15 + 2  targets CR) to use this ability. If successful, you can

send a message to the subject as a sending spell (caster level

equal to your truenamer level). You can use this ability three

times per day.

Speak unto the Masses (Su): At 17th level, you have the

ability to affect a number of creatures of the same creature

type with a single, powerful utterance. You can only affect

creatures of the same type (humanoids, giants, or dragons,

for example) with a single use of this ability, although you

could use it against a different group of a different creature

type each round. No two of the creatures you wish to affect

with  your  utterance  can  be  more  than  30  feet  apart,  and

the base DC for your Truespeak check is equal to the most

powerful (highest CR or most Hit Dice, if you are affecting

PCs) creature in the group. For each creature you wish to

affect with the utterance beyond the  rst, the DC of your

Truespeak check increases by 2.

The Law of Resistance (see page 233) applies to utterances

altered with speak unto the masses. As a result, additional uses

of an utterance modi ed with speak unto the masses might be

more dif cult, even if you then want to use the utterance on a

single creature later in the day. For example, if you attempted

to use an utterance against four  re giants (each CR 10), the

DC would be 15 + (2  10) + 6, or 41. If your attempt was suc-

cessful, and you later tried to use that same utterance against

a single marut (CR 15), the Law of Resistance applies, and the

DC would be 15 + (2  15) + 2, or 47.

Say My Name and I Am There (Su): At 20th level, you

develop a truenamenot your personal truename, but a sort

of true nicknamethat is invested with cosmic power such

that others who speak it can conjure you forth. Whenever

someone  successfully  says  this  truename,  you  can  appear

at that creatures location as if taken there by a word of recall

spell. You know who is saying your truename, and you can

choose not to be transported if you wish. The nickname is

often one or two syllables taken from your personal true-

name.  A  creature  speaking  your  true  nickname  need  not

make a Truespeak check to do so.

Most truenamers with this ability teach the truename to

their friends and allies so they can be called when needed.

PLAYING A TRUENAMER

The whole point of being a truenamer is that your words have

impact. Youre at the table to be heard. Whether youre a glib

negotiator, a master of riddles, or a laconic hero who speaks

only when she must, you should develop a distinctive style

for your characters speech.

As a truenamer, youre particularly interested in de ning

things. You want to  gure out the game world and accurately

name all its contents. Thats what drives you to solve puzzles,

uncover hidden enemies, and undertake other adventures:

the desire to catalog and name all you encounter.

RELIGION

Any deity with knowledge, lore, or speech in its pantheon

is a natural for truenamers. But more than that, truenamers

favor the creator deity (if one exists) in a given pantheon.

Many  truenamers  have  the  explicit  or  implicit  belief  that

the creator deity used the language of truenames to de ne

everything in the universe at the moment of creation, essen-

tially  speaking  every  truename  at  the  beginning  of  time.

Not  every  truenamer  believes  in  the  connection  between

the creation of the universe and the power of truenames, but

most do. This can sometimes get truenamers in trouble with

strongly orthodox religions that lack a creator deity or dont

incorporate truenames into their creation story.

In  the  standard  D&D  pantheon,  truenamers  tend  to

worship Boccob (N), Vecna (NE), or the patron deities of a

speci c race such as Corellon Larethian (elves, CG), Moradin

(dwarves, LN), Garl Glittergold (gnomes, NG), or Yondalla

(hal ings, LG).

Truenamers of the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting often vener-

ate Azuth (LN), Gond (N), Lathander (NG), Mystra (NG), or

Oghma (N). Some truenamers worship Selne or Shar due to

their importance in the worlds creation myth. Others favor

Deneir because they see a connection between truenames

and  the  Deneiran  Metatext.  The  racial  patron  deities   nd

worshipers among truenamers, too.

The truenamers of the EBERRON setting worship Aureon

(LN), Onatar (NG), or the Path of Light (kalashtar, LN).

OTHER CLASSES

Most members of other classes know little about the ways of

truename magic, and thus most will judge you independently

of your magical inclinations. Wizards and some clerics are

the most likely to know something of your art, and many

can  be  invaluable  allies,  aiding  you  in  your  research  and

complementing  your  utterances  with  their  own  powerful

forms of magic. You also bene t from the presence of strong

melee  combatants,  as  do  spellcasters,  since  they  can  keep

enemies away from you while you shake the battle eld and

strike  terror  into  the  hearts  of  your  foes  from  a  distance.

Allies can become mistrustful once they see your power and

realize that they too have truenames, and some will take time

before  they  become  comfortable  with  you  knowing  their

personal truenames.

COMBAT

Although  you  dont  cast  spells,  strictly  speaking,  youre

effectively a spellcaster in a  ght. In a typical combat round,

you attempt an utterance, hoping to damage or otherwise

confound your enemies in some way, or to aid your allies. If

you are wounded, you might be able to use an utterance to

heal yourself. But your interesting combat options revolve

around the utterances you have at your disposal.

If a foe proves especially resilient to your truename magic,

or  if  your  offensive  utterances  have  been  repeated  to  an

extent that you can no longer succeed on your Truespeak

checks,  your  tactical  role  in  a   ght  shifts  from  offense  to

defense and support.

ADVANCEMENT

Once you have undergone your initial training, you can

continue  your  studies  in  the  downtime  between  adven-

tures,  much  the  way  a  wizard  learns  new  spells.  Youre

always  practicing  the  pronunciation  of  truenames  you

already know and trying to  gure out the truenames you

201

dont know yet. Occasionally, you might visit the library of

your mentor or a truename-aware organization so you can

learn more truenames. When you reach higher levels, you

might advance the lore of truenames yourself, discovering

new truenames and becoming the  rst truenamer to speak

them aloud.

As  you  attain  more  levels  in  the  truenamer  class,  the

most  important  choice  you  face  is  which  utterances  to

learn.  Each  utterance  from  the  Lexicon  of  the  Evolving

Mind represents an action, and its reverse, that you can

use against friends or enemies. Eventually, you learn words

that you can use to form utterances that affect objects and

places. At every level, you learn a new utterance that can

affect creatures you encounter. The words you can learn

also increase in dif culty (and therefore increase in power)

as you gain levels, allowing access to new, more powerful

utterances.

DAILY LIFE

Most truenamers are content to catalog new truenames, prac-

tice the truenames they already know, and engage in other

linguistic  and  historical  studies.  Adventuring  truenamers

are an exception, however. They use truenames to bring their

vision of the way the world should be that much closer to real-

ity. Some are eager to  nd the truenames of monsters, places,

and items that no sentient eyes have ever seen beforeeven if

they have a hand in creating such things in the  rst place.

Truenamers are curious about the world around them,

so  a  high-level  truenamer  can  make  a  good  patron  for

lower-level PCs. Such truenamers often hire adventurers to

gather rare items for study or to recover lost treasure troves

of truenamer lore.

NOTABLES

Perhaps  the  most  famous  truenamer  is  Khurufu  the  Elo-

quent,  a  human  truenamer  who  lived  centuries  ago  and

founded  several  truenamer  colleges  that  exist  to  this  day.

Khurufu  lived  to  be  more  than  130  years  old,  although

his  mental  faculties  had  diminished  signi cantly  from

their peak. He didnt die so much as utter the truename for

ascend and disappear. Some say that for centuries, Khurufu

the Eloquent has been wandering the caves of Pandemonium,

where the screaming wind drowns out his voice and makes

rational thought impossible.

ORGANIZATIONS

Several organizations of interest to truenamers exist, includ-

ing the Collectors of the Lexicon and the Kingmakers. They

are described beginning on page 270.

TRUENAMERS IN THE WORLD

If  its  magic,  its  awfully  subtle  magic.  I  was  watching  for  the

handwaving and chanting. Instead, he just said somethingand

I couldnt move!

Captain Von Hakri of the city guard

Truenamers are a good addition to a magic-rich campaign

because  they  extend  the  boundaries  of  magic.  What  they

do is unquestionably magical, but it doesnt involve spells,

components,  schools,  or  any  of  the  other  accoutrements

normally associated with spellcasters.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people have an indifferent attitude toward truenamers,

because truename magic is regarded as just another esoteric

discipline. The average peasant doesnt distinguish between

truenamers  and  wizardstheyre  all  scholars  who  make

magic, arent they?

Truenamers likewise have few enemies. Logokron devils

(described on page 265) regard them as rivals and have start-

ing attitudes of unfriendly.

TRUENAMER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

truenamers  to  learn  more  about  them.  When  a  character

202

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Truenamers speak their magic aloud using long

strings of what sounds like gibberish.

DC  15:  Truenamers  claim  to  tap  into  the  power  of  a

fundamental  language  of  the  universe,  and  if  they  know

somethings truename, they can affect it with their magic.

DC 20: Truenamers gradually learn more truenames and

more ways to use each truename they know. They also can

learn the personal truename of an individual creature, which

gives them lots of power over that creature.

TRUENAMERS IN THE GAME

Truenamers rely on truename magic, obviously. But as long as

truename magic is compatible with your ongoing campaign,

you can introduce it gradually.

The most important way to keep the player of a truenamer

happy is to let that truenamer use his most important utter-

ancesespecially those recently acquired. Mostly, though,

truenamers are versatile enough to have fun in nearly any

sort  of  encounter.  You  can  pay  attention  to  the  types  of

utterances a truenamer takes to get a clue as to the types of

encounters the player would enjoy most.

ADAPTATION

The underlying structure of the truenamer class is modular:

He can use utterances and recitation feats. That leaves plenty

of room to replace those elements described in this chapter

with  utterances  and  recitation  feats  invented  by  the  true-

namer or DM.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

A truenamer, much as a spellcaster, can be a powerful ally or

dire villain. In either case, he has an inquisitive mind and is

eager to obtain any knowledge of truename magic the PCs

havepossibly by any means. The  rst time a truenamer is

encountered, the PCs are likely to assume him to be a wizard

or sorcerer. Eventually, however, they will notice his unique

delivery (no somatic or material components) and his unique

approach to his art.

EL 9: Khetarin found himself out of touch with his elven

heritage from an early age. He felt that the elves approach

to magic as an almost living entity was too spiritual, when

magic was really a tool to be studied and used. He discovered

a reference to truename magic in a musty old tome in one of

the elven libraries, and he was hooked. He eventually sought

out  a  truename  school  in  a  distant  human  city,  where  he

started down the path of the truenamer.

Khetarin is bookish and preoccupied, but can be digni ed

and charming if the occasion requires. He frequently stares at

new acquaintances, which can be unsettling (he is mentally

assembling the appropriate truename for each acquaintance

he meetsjust in case), but he is extremely knowledgeable

and willing to help any group devoted to furthering knowl-

edge and the greater good.

TRUENAME MAGIC

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Truename magic lends itself to interesting specialties and

adaptations.  Prestige  classes  offer  abilities  and  features

sought after by those skilled in Truespeak, be they truena-

mers,  opposed  to  truename  magic,  or  simply  adventurers

seeking to use the power of truenaming to their advantage.

All  the  prestige  classes  presented  here  require  some

knowledge of truespeaking, but are accessible to members of

many classes. None require levels in the truenamer class.

ACOLYTE OF THE EGO

Whenever I speak my truename, the world revolves around me

for a change.

Kalazart Candlesong, acolyte of the ego

An acolyte of the ego seeks to master but one truenamehis

own. In so doing, he learns to fortify himself against harm

and unleash pain and suffering upon his enemies. He cares

less about the truenames of other creatures. He devotes his

study to his true self as he experiments with the pronuncia-

tion of his truename to increase his power.

BECOMING AN

ACOLYTE OF THE EGO

Many acolytes of the ego begin as truenamers. After months

or years spent learning how to uncover and speak various

truenames,  some  truenamers  develop  a  mild  to  moderate

204

obsession with their own truenames and become acolytes of

the ego as a result. By learning to speak their own truenames,

they strive to unlock hidden powers lost to the cosmos.

Bards, with their af nity for the spoken word, are likewise

drawn to the acolyte of the ego class. However, the prerequi-

sites are such that any reasonably intelligent individual with

a predilection for truenames could become an acolyte of the

ego and unlock the power of his own truename.

CLASS FEATURES

Once you gain the ability to properly speak your own true-

name, you can learn to add speci c cadences and alter it in

other subtle ways. In so doing, you begin to unlock abilities

you never knew you had.

Known Personal Truename: You know your own per-

sonal truename. However, pronouncing it correctly requires

a Truespeak check with a DC equal to 15 + (2  your HD) + 2.

You get a +4 bonus on the Truespeak check because its your

personal truename.

Morphic  Cadence  (Sp):  Starting  at  2nd  level,  and  at

every  even-numbered  level  thereafter  (4th,  6th,  8th,  and

10th),  you  learn  to  pronounce  your  own  truename  with

certain cadences that alter your personal reality. Each time

you gain this ability, you learn a new morphic cadence (in

other words, a new way to morph your truename), and your

existing morphic cadences get incrementally better.

Activating  a  morphic  cadence  is  a  standard  action,  and

you must successfully speak your personal truename, which

requires a Truespeak check (see Known Personal Truename,

above).

The  fabric  of  your  reality  can  withstand  only  a  certain

amount of distortion. Thus, the Law of Resistance (see page

233) applies to cadences. This means that each time you use

the same cadence on the same day, the DC of the Truespeak

check increases by 2. You can have as many cadences active

at a time as you desire.

Cadence of the Distant Step: You can use dimension door (as

the spell, PH 221) to transport yourself and any items you are

carrying a maximum of 100 feet per morphic cadence you

know. You cannot use this ability to affect other creatures

or any objects you arent carrying.

Cadence  of  the  Swallowed  Spell:  You  gain  spell  resistance

equal to 15 + 2 per morphic cadence you know. The bene t

lasts for 1 round per class level.

Cadence of the Frightful Mind: You can frighten your foes (as

the fear spell, PH 229). The DC for the Will save to resist the

effect is 10 + your acolyte of the ego level + your Cha modi er

+ the number of morphic cadences you know. The duration

of the effect is 1 round per class level.

Cadence  of  the  Iron  Skin:  You  gain  damage  reduction  2/

magic, plus an additional 2 points of damage reduction per

morphic cadence you know beyond the  rst. In other words,

a 10th-level acolyte of the ego who knows this cadence gains

damage reduction 10/magic.

Cadence of the Living Fortress: You gain a measure of resis-

tance against critical hits for 1 round per class level. When a

critical hit or sneak attack is scored against you, there is a 20%

chance per morphic cadence you know (maximum 100% if

you know  ve morphic cadences) that the critical hit or sneak

attack is negated, and damage is rolled normally instead.

Cadence of the Lost Wound: You gain fast healing equal to

the number of morphic cadences you know. This bene t lasts

for 1 round per class level.

Cadence of the Lucky Fool: You gain a luck bonus on saving

throws equal to the number of mor-

phic  cadences  you  know.  This

bene t lasts for 1 round per class

level.

Cadence of the Mighty Bull:

You  gain  an  insight  bo-

nus to your Strength score

equal to the number of mor-

phic cadences you know for

1 minute.

Cadence  of  the  Prowling

Tiger: You gain an insight bo-

nus  to  your  Dexterity  score

equal to the number of mor-

phic cadences you know for 1

minute.

Cadence of the Secret Mask:

You  can  use  disguise  self  (as

the spell, PH 197) for 1 min-

ute per class level.

Cadence  of  the  Thunder

Drake:  You  can  make  a

single  breath  weapon  at-

tackspeci cally, a 20-foot

cone  of  painful  noise  that

deals 2d6 points of sonic dam-

age per morphic cadence you

know.  The  Re ex  save  to

halve the damage is DC 10 +

your acolyte of the ego class

level + your Con modi er +

the number of morphic ca-

dences you know.

Cadence of the Ursine Heart:

You gain an insight bonus to

your Constitution score equal

to  the  number  of  morphic  ca-

dences you know for 1 minute.

Resonant  Voice  (Su):  Start-

ing at 3rd level, you can speak your personal truename with

a particularly deep, resonant voice. The DC for the Truespeak

check increases by 5, but if the check succeeds, you treat your

class level as three higher for the purpose of determining

the effect and duration of any morphic cadence you use that

round (see above).

Cadence  Mastery  (Su):  Starting  at  5th  level,  you  can

speak  your  personal  truename  with  multiple  morphic

cadences at the same time. The DC of the Truespeak check

increases by 5 for each additional morphic cadence you wish

to activate after the  rst.

For example, a 6th-level bard/5th-level acolyte of the ego

can properly speak her own truename with a DC 37 True-

speak check. However, she can add cadence of the prowling tiger

and cadence of the thunder drake to her truename and gain the

bene ts of both with a successful DC 42 Truespeak check.

Alter Personal Truename (Su): At 7th level, you can alter

your own truename slightlyjust enough

to make it dif cult or impossible

for others to utter it correctly.

Any creature other than you

that  attempts  to  speak  your

truename  takes  a  4  penalty

on  the  Truespeak  check.  At

9th level, this penalty increas-

es to 8.

Recitation  Feat:  At  7th

level, you gain a recitation feat

(see page 231) as a bonus feat.

PLAYING AN

ACOLYTE OF

THE EGO

As  an  acolyte  of  the  ego,  you

enjoy  spending  a  few  hours

each day contemplating your

truename. This internal medi-

tation  can  be  done  while

performing  other  tasks,  but

while so immersed you tend

to  come  across  as  quiet  and

self-absorbed.  However,

when mystery gives way to

revelation and you discover

some  new  power  associ-

ated with your truename, you

become more animated as you

aggressively  seek  to  explore

the  limits  of  this  newfound

ability.  The  fact  that  your

truename  holds  such  great

power  can  make  others  feel

less in tune with the cosmos.

Add  to  that  your  special  knack

for  altering  your  truename  in

ways the universe never intended (in the form of morphic

cadences), and its no surprise that your comrades sometimes

see you as egotistical. Frankly, you prefer the term superior,

but to say that aloud would certainly be misinterpreted as

condescension.

Youre  disinclined  to  join  any  formal  organization  or

brotherhood, since no one could possibly know more about

your  own  truename  than  yourself.  However,  acolytes  of

the  ego  get  along  quite  well  with  one  another,  although

discussions  about  individual  truename  abilities  can  lead

to friendly, competitive rivalries. (Its very good that your

truename allows you to teleport short distances, but can you

heal yourself? No? Too bad.)

COMBAT

You  are  wise  to  master  a  combination  of  offensive  and

defensive morphic cadences. As you develop new morphic

cadences, the ones you already possess become more power-

ful and the effects more lasting. In short, you are rewarded

for continuing along the acolyte of the ego path.

Although your mastery of your own truename makes you

a  powerful  asset  to  any  adventuring  party,  your  morphic

cadences  and  other  abilities  rarely  affect  your  comrades

directly. For the most part, they must learn to rely on their

own abilities and devices, much as you have done.

Enemies with truespeaking ability will try to turn your

own truename against you. If you advance far enough as an

acolyte of the ego, you will learn how to warp your truename

in subtle ways to make it dif cult or impossible for others to

control or harm you in this fashion. In addition to unlocking

great power, you learn to guard yourself against those who

would use the source of your power against you.

ADVANCEMENT

To become an acolyte of the ego, you must demonstrate a

predilection for language by mastering at least four tongues.

You  must  also  be  a  devoted  student  of  truespeaking  and

understand the nature of truenames and the power they hold

over all things. A high Intelligence score certainly helps, as

few dim lanterns have the wherewithal to master ordinary

names, let alone truenames.

An acolyte of the ego cannot easily be shown or taught

how to pry secrets from her personal truename. The study

of  ones  truename  is  an  individual  exercise  and  requires

re ection, meditation, self-discovery, and many lonely hours

of practice.

Once you commit to unlocking the secrets of your true-

name, you have some control over how and where to focus

your energies. Can you  nd a way to say your truename to

make yourself stronger, or would you rather  nd a way to say

your name in a way that strikes terror into the hearts of your

enemies? In time, maybe you can do both, and more.

RESOURCES

Acolytes of the ego neither gain nor require special resources

that allow them to better pursue their unique craft.

ACOLYTES OF THE EGO

IN THE WORLD

See that odd young man muttering to himself in the corner? I

politely asked him his name, and he gave me the most withering

glare.

Lydia Goldsheaf, hal ing barmaid at the Tipsy Griffon

The quest to demystify ones personal truename is an internal

struggle, requiring a great deal of re ection. However, an aco-

lyte of the ego cant sit alone in a tower and expect to gain new

insights purely through meditation. To unlock the secrets of

his truename, an acolyte of the ego must determine the true

measure of himself through hardship and adventure. The

acolyte of the ego sees this as a truism and regards adventur-

ing not only as a means of personal growth but also as the way

to understand and realize his potential. For this reason, an

acolyte of the ego  nds himself drawn to adventuring parties.

An acolyte of the ego who joins a band of adventurers hopes

that the experience will trigger new revelations and enable

him to unlock new aspects of his truename.

An acolyte of the ego looks for traveling companions who

share the same adventurous spirit, even if their reasons for

adventuring differ.

DAILY LIFE

An acolyte of the ego spends between 1 and 4 waking hours

each day contemplating his own truename. He can indulge

this predilection while performing leisurely tasks that dont

require  serious  concentration.  For  example,  an  acolyte  of

the ego can murmur permutations of his truename while

cooking a meal or standing watch. Beyond that, an acolyte

of the ego has no special obligations.

NOTABLES

An  entire  realms  perceptions  of  truename  magic  and

acolytes of the ego might one day be shaped by the antics

of one Rekaldo Seravin (N male half-elf bard 3/truenamer

3/acolyte of the ego 2). Rekaldo recently learned the cadence

of  the  secret  mask  and  has  proven  himself  quite  a  nuisance

within  the  nobility.  Armed  with  a  silver  tongue  and  the

ability to conceal his true appearance, he has successfully

in ltrated a number of noble households and stolen valuable

items and political secrets. Local authorities have not been

able to catch him, but they believe his sponsor might be an

in uential member of the royal court. However, he is prone

to leaving behind small black cards traced with the words

You have been duped by Rekaldo the Acolyte of the Ego

in silvery paint.

Few acolytes of the ego are as arrogant and bold as Rekaldo

Seravin. Aya Beradi (CG female truenamer 6/acolyte of the

ego 5) has been quietly adventuring for years, though recently

her group disbanded. Plain and unassuming, Aya is currently

scouring the countryside for worthy compatriots so that she

might continue to face new challenges and learn from these

experiences.  Aya  is  remarkably  bright  and  astute  (Int  17),

but  her  aloof  manner  and  tremendous  vocabulary  can  be

off-putting to those who cant match her intellect. However,

she  has  worked  with  both  barbarians  and  wizards  before,

and she endeavors to be as patient with them as she can. She

knows the cadence of the swallowed spell and the cadence of the

thunder drake.

206

ORGANIZATION

Acolytes of the ego have no organizations to speak of.

NPC REACTIONS

Acolytes of the ego can seem self-absorbed or egotistical, but

for the most part, they defy stereotyping. If an acolyte of the

ego tells someone who he is, he will get quizzical looks and

raised eyebrows, because few people know what an acolyte

of the ego is. Even if he explains it, those quizzical looks

take time to fade.

Acolytes of the ego have no formal organization and no

blood  enemies.  Even  in  societies  that  oppose  truename

magic, acolytes of the ego are given some latitude because

of their inward focus.

ACOLYTE OF THE EGO LORE

Characters  with  ranks  Knowledge  (arcana)  or  Knowledge

(local),  or  who  have  the  bardic  knowledge  ability,  can

research acolytes of the ego to learn more about them. When

a character makes a check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC  15:  Acolytes  of  the  ego,  like  truenamers,  practice  a

form of magic called truename magic.

DC 20: An acolyte of the ego specializes in mastering his

own truename, hoping to gain power from it.

DC 25: An acolyte of the ego can alter his truename in

strange ways, and with each change in in ection or cadence

comes  a  different  power.  A  skilled  acolyte  of  the  ego  can

master several of them.

ACOLYTES OF THE EGO

IN THE GAME

Acolytes of the ego  t neatly into any campaign world that

allows  truename  magic.  Although  highly  focused,  their

morphic  cadences  are  quite  diverse,  and  two  acolytes  of

the ego can manifest wildly different abilities. A powerful

acolyte of the ego with multiple morphic cadences can  ll a

variety of roles in the typical adventuring party.

ADAPTATION

An acolyte of the ego can choose his morphic cadences from

an impressive list, but DMs should feel free to create new

ones.  Morphic  cadences  should  generally  grant  abilities

comparable to a spell of 4th level or lower, and their dura-

tions are quite short. Morphic cadences should be designed

to increase in power or duration slightly with each new level

taken in the acolyte of the ego prestige class.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

The acolyte of the ego described below would make an excel-

BEREFT

Ladorose the Bleak

The bereft are a group of truenamers who devote themselves

to mastering the word of unmaking, a powerful component of

Truespeech purportedly able to unravel creation. Through

liberal uses of the words syllables, a bereft studies its effects

so that one day he can master the complete word of unmaking

and perhaps unlock the meaning of reality. As he advances

in level as a bereft, he learns new syllables of unmaking that

create  a  variety  of  disruptive  effects.  After  much  patient

study, he  nally learns how to combine these potent syllables

into the terrible, deadly word of unmaking.

BECOMING A BEREFT

All bereft have some capability with Truespeech, making the

truenamer class an obvious choice to meet the requirements

for this prestige class. Bard levels grant the bereft an interest-

ing suite of abilities that work well with those acquired from

this class. Many bereft also take sorcerer or wizard levels to

enhance their defensive capabilities through magic.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any neutral

Skills: Truespeak 13 ranks

Languages: Must speak at least three languages

Special: Must have been the subject of the ritual of

renaming spell (see page 257). This costs 3,700 gp.

CLASS FEATURES

The berefts class features hinge on the Truespeak skill. As

your mastery grows, your capabilities begin to vary wildly

from  those  of  a  typical  truenamer.  You  can  deal  damage,

reduce your enemies effectiveness, and even utterly unmake

an enemys soul with the powerful word of unmaking.

Obscure Personal Truename (Ex): Upon becoming a

bereft,  you  give  up  your  natural  truename  and  take  pains

to make your new one more dif cult to discover. You gain a

new truename by means of the ritual of renaming (see Entry

208

Requirements), and you receive Obscure Personal Truename

as a bonus feat.

Syllables of Unmaking (Sp): At each bereft level, you

learn  another  syllable  of  the  powerful  word  of  unmaking.

While  each  syllable  unmakes  a  portion  of  an  enemy  in  a

different way, the syllables do share some common traits.

Each syllable is a spell-like ability.

Each syllable requires you to make a successful Truespeak

check to affect the creature you target. See page 195 for the

rules involved in making a Truespeak check.

The  Law  of  Resistance  applies  to  each  syllable,  so  the

Truespeak DC for repeated uses of a syllable increases by 2.

See page 233 for a description of the Law of Resistance.

The range of each syllable is 60 feet.

As  with  utterances,  syllables  need  not  be  heard  by  the

target to be effective.

The caster level of each syllable is equal to your character

level.

Syllable of Detachment: When you begin your career as a

bereft, you learn the  rst syllable in the word of unmaking:

the syllable of detachment. When you successfully speak this

syllable, your target  nds itself less capable. Even the most

minor tasks are suddenly more dif cult. The target takes a

2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks for a number of

rounds equal to your class level. This ability is the equivalent

of a 2nd-level spell.

Syllable of Af iction: Beginning at 2nd level, you can use

Truespeak to temporarily alter a target creatures truename

and remove one of four senses. If your Truespeak check is

successful, the subject must make a Will save (DC 10 + class

level + Cha modi er). If it fails, you temporarily erase one of

the targets senses: sight (as per blindness/deafness), hearing (as

per blindness/deafness), smell (negates scent ability), or touch

(2 circumstance penalty on Climb, Disable Device, Escape

Artist,  Jump,  Open  Lock,  Search,  Tumble,  and  Use  Rope

checks). The effect of this ability remains for a number of

rounds equal to your class level. This ability is the equivalent

of a 4th-level spell.

Syllable of Exile: When you attain 3rd level, with a successful

Truespeak check you can temporarily send a target of this

syllable to a confusing pocket dimension. This ability func-

tions as a maze spell, but the subject is trapped in the maze

for only 1 round. It can still attempt an Intelligence check

to escape on its turn as normal, but doing so is only a swift

action (as opposed to a full-round action, as normal for a maze

spell). Thus, if it escapes, the creature can act normally on its

turn. This ability is the equivalent of a 6th-level spell.

Syllable  of  Dissolution:  When  you  reach  4th  level,  your

pro ciency with the syllables of unmaking has nearly reached

its pinnacle. You can now unmake a portion of a creatures

physical essence. If you succeed on your Truespeak check,

your target takes 8d6 points of damage, as portions of its body

are ripped away and destroyed. This ability is the equivalent

of a 7th-level spell.

abilities to neutralize as many foes as you can. Dont stand in

one place; move around the battle eld to strike opponents

where they least expect it.

Look for allies who can protect you while you use your

powers.  A  well-armed  and  armored   ghter  can  mean  all

the difference in the thick of combat. Try to use your class

features to target opponents who are not directly engaged

with your protector, so focus on spellcasters and archers  rst

while your protector eliminates melee opponents that would

threaten you.

At  2nd  level,  you  can  literally  strip  a  target  of  his

senses, eliminating foes with ease. Even if your target

throws off the blindness or deafness, you can

still  impair  its  allies  with  the  syllable  of

detachment. Failing all else, you can

simply destroy your foes with the

syllable of dissolution.

ADVANCEMENT

The knowledge you harbor car-

ries  a  great  responsibility.  You

hold  the  keys  to  destroying

the  works  of  the  gods.

Consequently,  the

Bereft are reluctant

to accept new mem-

bers,  allowing  only  those  with  some

experience  with  truename  magic  to

join their group. Bereft test the extent

of your familiarity with truenaming tech-

niques. They also look for chaotic and

destructive tendencies, traits capable

of unleashing the true destructive

power of their knowledge.

Even after the initial interview, it

might be months before the Bereft

contact  you  again.  During  this

time,  they  watch  your  behavior

to see how you react to different

situations, as well as how you use

Truespeak in stressful situations.

Once satis ed, the Bereft bring

you into their fold and teach you

the  rst syllable of unmaking.

Syllable  of  Enervation:  At  5th  level,  you  learn  the   nal

syllable of the word of unmaking. If your Truespeak check

is  successful,  your  target  gains  two  negative  levels.  There

is  no  saving  throw  to  avoid  gaining  the  negative  levels,

but 24 hours after gaining them, the subject of the word of

unmaking must make a Fortitude save (DC 15 + Cha modi-

 er) for each negative level gained. If the save succeeds, that

negative  level  is  removed.  If  it  fails,

the negative level also goes away, but

one of the subjects character levels is

permanently drained. This ability is the

equivalent of an 8th-level spell.

Word of Unmaking (Sp): The ulti-

mate power of a bereft is the ability

to remove a creatures soul from the

fabric of reality. By

combining  all  the

syllables of unmaking

into  one  terrible  word,

you  can  make  a  Truespeak

check  as  a  full-round  action  and

target a creature that has died. You

must be within touch range of the

corpse  to  use  this  ability,  and  doing

so provokes attacks of opportunity. If

your Truespeak check is successful,

the creature cannot be raised from

the  dead  or  animated  through

any  means.  Only  a  ritual  of

renaming combined with a true

resurrection spell cast together

can return the creature to life.

You  cannot  target  an  undead

creature with this ability, but you

could target its remains. Using this

ability costs 100 XP.

PLAYING A BEREFT

Being a bereft means you have

the  ability  to  directly  unravel  a

targets capabilities. You like destroy-

ing  and  creating  chaos  among  your  enemies,  watching  as

they scramble about in a vain attempt to stop the buzzing

words.  Each  con ict  furthers  your  understanding  of  the

word of unmaking.

Of course, your sole intent is not just to destroy and maim.

You and the rest of the bereft gave up your names to under-

stand and manipulate how reality works. More important,

you safeguard the word of unmaking to prevent it from falling

into the wrong hands. Though you often consult with your

colleagues, youre just as likely to spend time on your own

or in the company of an adventuring group.

COMBAT

You are a harbinger of destruction, armed with a variety of

abilities to give you an edge over your opponents. Use your

Tobilar, a human bereft

As a part of this group, the  rst step you undertake as a

member is to lose your past. The Bereft wipe away all traces

of your history, striking your name from every record they

can reach, using magic to modify or erase memories of you

from  all  but  your  most  trusted  allies.  Then  they  modify

your own memory, causing you to forget your name. Once

properly  prepared,  they  give  you  a  new  name,  usually  a

number,  by  which  you  are  called  ever  after,  and  a  new

truename, acquired during a ritual of renaming (see Entry

Requirements, above).

As you advance in the bereft class, keep developing the

Truespeak skill. Other skills, such as Bluff, Concentration,

I

and Spellcraft, are also important, especially if you dabble

in magic. Invest in magic items that increase your Charisma

score, such as a cloak of Charisma or potion of eagles  splendor.

RESOURCES

The  Bereft  offer  their  members  knowledge,  information,

and companionship. Having sacri ced everything to attain

knowledge  of  the  word  of  unmaking,  you  can  turn  to  your

fellows  for  friendship  and  alliances.  A  family  of  sorts,  all

members of the Bereft are well versed in Truespeech and

assist novices in developing their own skills and techniques,

while also comforting them in the transition to a new life.

BEREFT IN THE WORLD

A grave danger, these Bereft . . . they are a faceless threat capable

of striking anywhere and at any time. Some might say they are a

greater risk to reality than binders.

Croius, White Blade Witch Slayer

The Bereft are equally viable as villains as they are heroes.

As opponents, they are a dangerous organization dabbling

in  forces  beyond  their  comprehension  and  presenting  a

grave danger to reality. As heroes, they might be custodians

of the word of unmaking, preventing it from falling into the

wrong hands.

DAILY LIFE

A bereft sees the world as nothing more than a series of words

given form. A tree is the re ection of the idea of a tree, just

as Grog is a re ection of the idea of half-orc. Consequently,

they overlook how these re ections feel and react, not seeing

emotions as the reaction to a set of experiences, but rather

abstractions of the concepts of love, hate, rage, and so on.

Their  detached  nature  strains  existing  relationships  and

makes developing new ones dif cult. Thus, many bereft fall

back on the company of their own kind, debating the nature

of truenames and the applications of Truespeech, rather than

cultivating new relationships.

As a bereft spends time among his peers and develops a

deeper understanding of the logical underpinnings of reality,

he rises in prominence within his particular group. He can

make decisions for the Bereft and even lead expeditions to

eliminate rogue bereft characters and other abusers of true-

name magic. He might lead a combined group of bereft and

their allies, and one day oversee the entire organization.

NOTABLES

Uriane  Logthosoth  became  a  bereft  by  accident.  A  true-

namer of no little skill, she was once hunted by the Black

Wind, a group of wicked witch slayers who killed as often

as they captured. One by one, her companions fell to their

pursuers black-shafted arrows, deathblade poison coursing

through their veins. The possibility of escape seemed less

and  less  likely.  Finally,  when  she  was  alone,  minions  of

the Black Wind cornered her in a box canyon. She tried to

scramble up the walls, but the rock was loose and crumbled

under  her  grip.  With  bloody   ngers,  heaving  chest,  and

terror mounting she turned to face the grim band. Arrows

nocked, strings pulled back, it seemed death was upon her.

But then she spoke, channeling her rage and frustration into

a single word. The lead archer exploded in a cloud of bone,

teeth, and blood. The other archers stepped back with fear as

she, with wonder, spoke again, this time killing three. They

quickly launched their arrows, but the buzzing of her words

confused them, and those that didnt set upon one another

 ed  shrieking.  Uriane  knew  that  day  she  had  uncovered

something terrible, a dark word that could destroy.

Uriane  erased  her  name  and  left  all  she  knew  behind

her. She discovered others like her and drew them to her.

Coining themselves the Bereft, they stood outside political

machinations and battles for good and evil to protect their

forbidden knowledge.

ORGANIZATION

Through  the  long  training  required  to  master  the  word

of  unmaking,  bereft  characters  develop  a  strong  loyalty  to

their peers, embracing the responsibility of the knowledge

tempered  with  an  eagerness  to  learn  more.  The  rigorous

instruction  helps  prevent  accidents  resulting  from  poor

preparation and instills a sense of secrecy in what they do.

All  this  has  been  carefully  orchestrated  to  create  a  cabal

of  powerful  truenamers  armed  with  the  ability  to  master

Truespeech  and  maybe  uncover  the  true  word  that  could

unmake reality.

Uriane Logthosoth founded the Bereft to protect not only

the truenamers who knew the word of unmaking, but also to

engender a responsibility to prevent its widespread use and

likely abuse. But with her death went her idealized views.

Certainly, the Bereft train under the guidelines established

by their founder, but a growing nihilistic faction of the group,

called the Undone, wants nothing more than to destroy all

worlds and all creaturesto deconstruct reality so that the

prime  mover,  the  creative  force,  can  rebuild  it  in  a  more

perfect form.

The Undone faction traces its origins to Ladorose, a disaf-

fected  truenamer  who  suffered  in  the  Tower  of  Woe  (see

page 100) for  ve years before the witch slayers (see page 67)

there realized that he was not a binder and released him. He

tried to resume his life, but the nightmares of his captivity

haunted him, and so he wandered. He  nally discovered the

Bereft and learned from them, and during his studies, he

realized the only way to completely end evil would be to end

everything. He kept this knowledge to himself until after

he completed his training. For the next few years, he spread

the gospel of his beliefs to a select few truenamers, forming

a cadre of like-minded souls. As their numbers grew, so did

their in uence within the group.

Ladorose now is the most senior member of the Bereft,

and  his   rst  students  now  serve  as  instructors.  They  still

210

train  new  members  in  the  same  ways,  but  those  students

who have a particular talent and no particular love of the

world are invited into the inner circle, gradually introduced

to the concepts espoused by the groups leadership. Should

they balk at the destruction of all things, they are quietly

silenced. Such happenings are rare, so the Undone continue

their efforts to prepare the way for the worlds unmaking.

NPC REACTIONS

The  Bereft  are  a  fringe  group  of  truenamers,  so  few  even

know about their existence. Most who encounter these char-

acters see them as eccentric truenamers and are indifferent

at worst. A few know them for who they are and see them as

a dangerous and reckless force, and are at best unfriendly.

A  few  witch  slayer  groups  have  expanded  their  prey  to

truenamersespecially  the  bereft.  Among  them  are  the

remainder  of  the  Black  Wind  coterie,  but  a  few  others,

including the White Swords and Red Moon coteries, also

hunt them. Witch slayers are always unfriendly, but witch

slayers that are part of these three coteries are hostile.

BEREFT LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) can research

bereft to learn more about them. When a character makes a

skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Words exist that can render men insane merely by

speaking them.

DC 15: The bereft are masters of a particular grouping of

destructive words of power that can destroy and maim. In

principle, they act as the custodians of these words.

DC 20: The bereft claim to guard these words and prevent

them from falling into the wrong hands.

DC 30: A faction within the bereft organization wants to

destroy reality.

A bardic knowledge check can reveal the same information

as a Knowledge check, and in each case the DC is 5 lower

than the given value.

BEREFT IN THE GAME

As described, bereft are not widely known. Its a big world,

full of fantastic and terrible forms of magic. Its not a stretch

to say bereft have operated beneath notice for many years and

have only just recently surfaced.

The bereft class offers a dynamic set of abilities, likely to

appeal to players who really like being able to sculpt their

abilities to  t different situations. The bereft, while at heart

a truenamer, is an outgrowth of that class, with abilities and

talents  unlike  any  other.  This  class  works  extremely  well

in  most  campaigns  with  little  adaptation  to  normal  play.

However,  to  maintain  the  tension  of  using  the  syllables  of

unmaking,  be  sure  to  incorporate  reoccurring  antagonists

to oppose the character and his brand of magic.

ADAPTATION

The bereft class serves as a new direction for truenamers.

However, this need not be the case. If you dont use true-

name magic, you can still use this class. Simply replace the

Truespeak  check  with  a  caster  level  check.  Furthermore,

the bereft need not be protectors of the word of unmaking;

they  could  be  harbingers  of  entropy.  In  this  case,  bereft

make for excellent mad villains with designs on destroying

the world, perhaps to appease a mad god or because of their

own insanity.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Encounters with bereft should emphasize the Undone fac-

tion. These characters are agents of destruction and probably

see the PCs as a roadblock to the ful llment of their nefarious

plans.

EL 11: Tobilar, a bereft, suspects one or more PCs of being

truenamers. He shadows the characters for a few weeks to

assess their worth to their organization. If he is discovered,

Tobilar  attacks  to  prevent  knowledge  of  the  bereft  from

leaking out.

BRIMSTONE SPEAKER

Angels  of  sky  and  sun,   y  to  my  aid!  With  the  sacred  word

thamachtrulihaunavrithi, I compel you!

Kuorick Hammerdau, brimstone speaker

Brimstone speakers regard the secret language of truenames

as nothing less than a gift from the gods. Through assidu-

ous study, they master truenames that enable them to call

eladrins, archons, and angels to  ght on their behalf. They

also know the truename theyre most famous for: the tongue

of  re that burns away the stain of evil everywhere.

BECOMING A BRIMSTONE SPEAKER

Becoming a brimstone speaker is relatively straightforward,

as long as you meet the religious and alignment requirements

of  the  class.  The  easiest  path  to  the  class  is  to  take  seven

levels of cleric and either the Truename Training feat or a

level in the truenamer class to get the needed ranks in the

Truespeak skill.

Alignment: Any good

Skills: Truespeak 10 ranks

Special: Ability to cast true prayer of the chosen*

Special: Worshiper of a deity that provides access to the

New spell described on page 259

CLASS FEATURES

The brimstone speaker exchanges some spellcasting levels

for two abilities: a  ery breath weapon and the ability to call

outsider allies.

Spellcasting: At each level except 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 9th,

you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level

(and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a

level in a divine spellcasting class to which you belonged

before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however,

gain any other bene t a character of that class would have

gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class

before becoming a brimstone speaker, you must decide to

Table 36: The Brimstone Speaker

Hit Die: d8

which class to add each level for the purpose of determining

spells per day, caster level, and spells known.

Tongue  of  Fire  (Su): The   rst  thing  every  brimstone

speaker  learns  is  a  truename  that  roughly  translates  as

tongue  of   re.  If  you  utter  it  correctly  (Truespeak  DC

25), you gain a  ery breath weapon that deals 3d6 points of

damage in a 20-foot line. Those within the area of the tongue

of  re take half damage if they succeed on a Re ex saving

throw (DC 10 + class level + Con modi er).

At 5th level, your tongue of  re deals 5d6 points of damage

(Truespeak DC 30), and at 10th level your tongue of  re deals

8d6 points of damage (Truespeak DC 35). If you wish, you

can declare that youre using a less powerful version of your

tongue of  re, accepting less damage in exchange for a lower

Truespeak DC. The Law of Resistance applies to this ability

(see page 233), so the Truespeak DC of each successive use

of tongue of  re increases by 2.

Lesser Heavenly Entreaty (Sp): Beginning at 3rd level,

by shouting the truenames of various angelic powers to the

heavens, you are able to call powerful outsiders to  ght on

your behalf. If you succeed on a DC 27 Truespeak check, you

can summon one bralani eladrin (MM 93) that follows your

directions as if summoned by a summon monster spell. You

can use a heavenly entreaty a number of times per day equal

to your class level. A celestial summoned with this ability

remains for 1 minute. You can have only one heavenly envoy

at a time. If you successfully summon a new one, the previous

one disappears. The Law of Resistance applies to this ability

(see page 233), so the Truespeak DC of each successive use

of lesser heavenly entreaty increases by 2.

Heavenly Entreaty (Sp): From 6th level on, if you succeed

on a DC 33 Truespeak check, your ability to summon celestial

aid  improves.  You  now  have  the  option  of  summoning  one

word archon (see page 264) that follows your directions as if

summoned by a summon monster spell. You can use a heavenly

entreaty  a  number  of  times  per  day  equal  to  your  class  level.

Uses of this ability and lesser heavenly entreaty are drawn from a

common pool. Thus, at 6th level, you can summon either a word

archon or a bralani eladrin a total of six times per day. A celestial

summoned with this ability remains for 1 minute. You can only

have one heavenly envoy at a time. If you successfully summon

a new one, the previous one disappears. The Law of Resistance

applies to this ability (see page 233), so the Truespeak DC of each

successive use of heavenly entreaty increases by 2.

Greater  Heavenly  Entreaty  (Sp):  When  you  attain

9th  level,  your  ability  to  summon  celestial  allies  improves

again. If you succeed on a DC 43 Truespeak check, you can

summon one astral deva (MM 11) that follows your directions

as  if  summoned  by  a summon  monster spell.  You  can  use  a

heavenly  entreaty  a  number  of  times  per  day  equal  to  your

class  level.  Uses  of  this  ability, heavenly  entreaty,   and  lesser

heavenly entreaty are drawn from a common pool. Thus, at 9th

level, you can summon either an astral deva, a word archon,

or a bralani eladrin a total of nine times per day. A celestial

summoned with this ability remains for 1 minute. You can

have only one heavenly envoy at a time. If you success-

fully summon a new one, the previous one disappears.

The Law of Resistance applies to this ability (see page

233),  so  the  Truespeak  DC

of  each  successive  use  of

greater heavenly entreaty

increases by 2.

PLAYING A

BRIMSTONE

SPEAKER

Your  god  gave  you  an

immense  gift,  reveal-

ing to you part of the

hidden  mechanism

of  the  universe.  As

a  result,  you  spread

the  word  in  both

the  literal  and   gu-

rative  senses.  Your

truenames  help  you

crusade for good. With

each victory over evil,

your  actions  increase

the truename power of

words  such  as  good,

honorable, and hero.

You are torn between two worlds. On one hand, you spend

a lot of time cloistered in a library mastering the art of true-

names. But your abilities are far more suited to the life of a

crusader than the life of the scholar. You delve into tomes

of truename lore from a sense of duty, but youre eager to get

back out into the  eld and pursue your true calling: burning

the stench of evil from the world.

COMBAT

You have traded some spellcasting levels to earn your class

features, so the most important tactical decision you face on

a round-by-round basis is whether to cast a spell, use tongue

of  re, or summon a celestial ally. Tongue of  re gives you

a good offensive option, especially against multiple foes, so

you can shift your spell selection to include more defensive

and utility spells if you wish. Realize also that you retain

offensive power regardless of how many spells you have. Even

if you convert every spell on your list to heal your allies, you

can still blast evildoers with tongue of  re.

The tongue of  re does have its limitations. Its range is

only 20 feet, and sometimes its dif cult to place the line so

that it doesnt hit your alliesyou want to avoid what would

literally be friendly  re. The ability requires you to make a

successful Truespeak check to use, so keep your Truespeak

modi er as high as possible.

Because your tongue of  re is a line, you will want to know

the rules for line-shaped effects (PH 175) like the back of your

hand.

Your spells and class features keep you busy during a  ght,

so  you  might  let  your  prowess  in  melee  combat  lan-

guish  somewhat.  You  should  still  carry  a  weapon,

but you might  nd that you dont swing it often,

just because you have more

compelling options on a

round-by-round  basis.

Dont neglect your de-

fense. You will spend

a great deal of time in

harms  way,  because

many

commonly

cast  divine  spells  are

touch spells, and your

tongue of  re has a rel-

atively short range.

You  learn  your

 rst heavenly entreaty

at  3rd  level.  There-

after,  you  have  an

encounter-changing

class  feature.  This

provides  you  with

yet another option to

access  in  the  course

of  a  battle,  but  its

nice  to  have  tactical

dilemmas that involve powerful out siders  ying to aid you.

A  successful  heavenly  entreaty  can  swing  an  encounter

in your favor, but it also makes that encounter a lot more

complicated. Youve just added a high-level outsider to a battle

that was probably complex to begin with. You can make the

DMs life a lot easier and your fellow players more engaged if

you have the statistics for the bralani eladrins, word archons,

or astral devas ready ahead of time. Study them beforehand

so  you  know  what  they  can  do  and  what  their  important

statistics are (AC, saving throws, and so on).

ADVANCEMENT

It takes an unlikely combination of a scholars patience and

a crusaders zeal to make a good brimstone speaker, and the

masters of your religious order identi ed you as a good candi-

date. Throughout your early career, you studied the discipline

of truenames. After you passed a series of examinations, you

were taught the truename for tongue of  re, and your life as

a brimstone speaker began.

Once you learn the truename for the tongue of  re, you

immediately  begin  studying  the  truenames  of  outsiders,

striving to pronounce them so perfectly that the angels have

no choice but to descend and aid you. You visit the major

temples  of  your  faith  periodically,  eager  to  study  more  in

their archives and libraries.

As you gain brimstone speaker levels, keep your Truespeak

modi er  as  high  as  possible.  If  you  stop  improving  your

Truespeak skill, higher-level class features will be nearly inac-

cessible to you. Consider the Skill Focus (Truespeak) feat, the

amulet of the silver tongue, and various Intelligence-enhancing

items as means of improving your ability to use Truespeak.

Because you have ranks in Truespeak, consider giving true-

name spells (described in the section beginning on page 253)

an important place in your repertoire. Because some of those

spells  require  research  into  personal  truenames,  consider

developing Knowledge skills that will help you discover the

personal truenames of your allies and enemies.

RESOURCES

Brimstone  speakers  are  traditionally  crusaders  for  their

faith,  cleansing  the  countryside  of  evil  and  leaving  more

esoteric theological matters for other parts of the religion.

You spend most of your time away from the church, because

your mission is to go where the evil is. You can count on aid

from  your  religious-minded  fellows  when  you  come  back

into the fold, because they generally recognize the value of

the work you perform. You will often get free or reduced-cost

spellcasting at af liated temples and shrines in exchange for

the quests and crusades you undertake.

The most important aid you receive isnt spellcasting or

 nancial aid, howeverits access to the accumulated true-

name lore of your church. When you visit major temples,

you can get access to the books that unlock your key class

features.

BRIMSTONE SPEAKERS

IN THE WORLD

It was da perfect ambush. Da human was all alone in a canyon, so

we jumped down, killed her horse so she couldnt run off, and cut her

real good. Then she said somethin I couldnt hear rightall weird

gobbledy-gukand  these  glowin  winged  things  came  zoomin

outta da sky. I ran, but from da sounds I heard, dose winged things

got everyone else.

Nahlarak, bugbear warlord

Brimstone speakers are often spoken of in the temples of

many faiths, but theyre rarely seen there. Their abilities are

suited  for  cleansing  the  land  of  evil,  not  proselytizing  to

heathens or preaching sermons to the faithful. Brimstone

speakers follow the lead of Joram the Crusader (described

below) in that regard.

DAILY LIFE

Brimstone speakers usually wake up with one of two goals:

Uncover evil, or expunge the evil they uncovered yesterday.

Their  life  is  a  series  of  quests  and  crusades,  punctuated

only by periodic spates of intense truename study at major

temples. Most brimstone speakers wouldnt have it any other

way, because they believe that their deities chose them to

wander the earth and cleanse it of evil.

NOTABLES

Perhaps  the  most  famous  brimstone  speaker  is  Joram  the

Crusader, a follower of Pelor who crossed the earth on one

quest or another for six of his eight decades. A temple acolyte

once asked Joram why he spent his life in dark caverns, fetid

swamps, and other unsavory places. Jorams terse response:

Because thats where the evil is.

Brimstone  speakers  have  a  centuries-old  history,  but

many current speakers have some connection to Jorama

testament both to Jorams industry and the desire of younger

brimstone  speakers  to  emulate  him  as  closely  as  possible.

One of the most controversial brimstone speakers is Urick

Joramson, a child of Jorams known for his intense zeal to

uproot evil. Unlike his father, Urick is indiscriminate in his

campaign to rid the land of evil. Urick believes that the gods

will protect innocents caught up in the battle between good

and evil, so Urick doesnt need to. If no god sought to save

you, you should ask yourself why! says Urick. Urick and

Joram are estranged for both this difference in philosophy

and some family reasons neither will discuss.

ORGANIZATION

Brimstone  speakers  have  no  organization  of  their  own.

Each good-aligned religion with brimstone speakers among

its  ranks  develops  its  own  organization  to  pass  along  the

necessary truename lore and direct the efforts of brimstone

speakers in the  eld. In most cases, brimstone speakers are

a separate order within the larger church. They share all the

beliefs and customs of the religion as a whole, but they have

their own speci c traditions and codes of conduct as well.

Many  brimstone  speakers  are  followers  of  Pelor,  both

because Pelors followers are so numerous and because Joram

the Crusader worships Pelor. Pelors religion has an Order

of  Brimstone,  whose  members  wear   ame-red  tabards

and  golden  helms.  Anyone  who  can  qualify  to  become  a

brimstone speaker is eligible to join the Order of Brimstone,

which grants access to the churchs libraries and provides a

steady  supply  of  missions  involving  threats  to  the  church

and society at large. Most of Pelors brimstone speakers are

sent out on missions individually or with allies who arent

brimstone  speakers.  Again,  Jorams  wisdom  is  part  of  the

reason; he once famously said, One spark for one bon re.

Other faiths have different ways of organizing their brim-

stone speakers. Followers of Kord have a Brimstone Brigade

organized along military lines, while Heironeouss brimstone

speakers are eligible to join one of several crusader orders

dominated  by  paladins,  knights  of  the  chalice  (described

214

in  Complete  Warrior),  and  divine  crusaders  (described  in

Complete Divine).

NPC REACTIONS

Because  brimstone  speakers  are  relatively  rare  and  not

involved in church leadership or politics, theyre not well

known, even among the faithful. Religious leaders, on the

other hand, recognize and value the services that a brimstone

speaker provides, so they have an initial attitude of friendly

when encountering a brimstone speaker.

Evildoers who have been burned by a brimstone speaker

arent likely to forgive or forget, so they have an initial atti-

tude of hostile toward brimstone speakers. Evildoers who

work behind the scenes, such as cultists and rebels, have a

particular loathing for brimstone speakers because they cant

be bought off or negotiated with.

BRIMSTONE SPEAKER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (religion) can research

brimstone speakers to learn more about them. When a char-

acter makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following,

including the information from lower DCs.

DC  10:  Brimstone  speakers  are  clerics  that  can  emit  a

tongue of  re to burn their enemies.

DC  15:  They  use  the  power  of  truenames  to  create  the

tongue  of   re,  and  eventually  they  use  the  truenames  of

eladrins, archons, and angels to call them into battle.

DC 20: Brimstone speakers spend most of their time on

quests to expunge the land of evil, much like their greatest

hero, Joram the Crusader.

BRIMSTONE SPEAKERS IN THE GAME

The brimstone speaker class is are a good way for an exist-

ing  characterprobably  a  cleric,  in  this  caseto  use  the

truename rules and retain the familiar aspects of the clerics

function. The prestige class is overtly a cleric with a twist.

Once the player has mastered a few new class features and

perhaps some truename spells, he or she can settle into the

familiar role of the cleric without dif culty. Many mid-level

clerics will be able to qualify for the prestige class in just a few

levels, simply by buying cross-class ranks in Truespeak until

their next feat choice becomes available. They can then take

the Truename Training feat, and they should have enough

ranks to qualify for the brimstone speaker class.

As a DM, you should pay attention to how much the player

of  a  brimstone  speaker  uses  the  truename  aspects  of  the

class. If a brimstone speaker just wants to be a cleric with a

tongue of  re, thats  ne. But if the player starts using true-

name spells and spending skill points in Knowledge skills to

improve her truename research abilities, thats a sign that the

player wants your help to make truenames more important.

Include  villains  in  your  game  whose  personal  truenames

she has a reasonable chance of learning. Give some monsters

truename-related feats, including ones that will surprise her,

such as Personal Truename Backlash.

ADAPTATION

As written, the brimstone speaker is a crusader for the forces

of good. Its easy to change (or even remove) the alignment

requirement and develop a brimstone speaker devoted to tyr-

anny and woe, or one with no philosophical agenda at all.

If you change the alignment requirement for this class, you

should replace the creatures in the entreaties. Because the crea-

tures remain for only a few rounds, their Challenge Rating is

the best measuring stick for how effective they are in response

to an entreaty. The 3rd-level entreaty gives you a CR 6 creature,

the 6th-level entreaty gives you CR 9, and 9th level CR 14.

Keep  in  mind  that  summoned  creatures  with  unusual

spell-like  abilities  can  be  problematic  even  with  a  short

duration, and its hard to  t multiple Large or Huge outsiders

onto a crowded battle eld.

To give the class an evil, demonic  air, for instance, you

could  use  Chaos,  Evil,  and  Fire  for  the  domain  require-

ment, and replace the envoys with a babau, a vrock, and a

nalfeshnee as the creatures that answer a brimstone speakers

entreaty. For a lawful evil  avor, require the Evil, Fire, or Law

domains and use a chain devil, bone devil, and logokron devil

(see page 265).

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

If your PCs are battling a brimstone speaker, the encounter

will be more memorable if they get to see all the class features

in play. For example, you could have the brimstone speaker

use a tongue of  re in the  rst round, make a heavenly entreaty

in the second, then spend subsequent rounds casting ben-

e cial spells on his angelic allies. Dont be shy about using

the heavenly entreaty in the  rst or second round; NPCs dont

have to pace themselves the way PCs do, because they have a

life span measured in just a handful of rounds.

EL  10:  Kuorick  Hammerdau  is  a  rail-thin  woman  with

piercing  eyes  and  a  stern  demeanor.  Shes  a  well-meaning

brimstone  speaker,  but  like  her  mentor  Urick  Joramson,

she cleanses evil  rst and asks questions later. She can be an

effective foil for morally ambiguous PCs, or characters with

unusual allies, such as drow.

DISCIPLE OF THE WORD

Defy the sword.

Aglaran, Disciple of the Word

Disciples of the word are intellectual warrior monks who,

through a deeper understanding of their truenames, transcend

the limits of their mortal form. Disciples commit themselves to

a studied pursuit of introspection tempered by pious devotion

to the principles of Zuoken as penned by the hand of the  rst

disciple, Akahuza. Through these teachings, disciples develop

techniques that allow them to defy the limits of reality.

BECOMING A DISCIPLE

OF THE WORD

Monks make the best disciples of the word, because they have

an average base attack bonus, are lawful, and gain the evasion

class feature early. Other characters can gain entry into this

class, but the evasion requirement necessitates at least two

levels of monk or rogue, or at least eight levels of ranger. No

character can take levels in this class without devoting a few

skill points to the Truespeak skill.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any lawful

Base Attack Bonus: +4

Skills: Truespeak 4 ranks

Feats: Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist

Special: Evasion

CLASS FEATURES

As a disciple of the word, you have class features that empha-

size mobility. Abilities such as word of movement sublime

and word of movement perfected allow you to move about the

battle eld almost unhindered. Word of the  st unraveling

variety of attack capabilities, from spells to melee attacks.

Known Personal Truename: You know your own per-

sonal truename. However, pronouncing it correctly requires

a Truespeak check with a DC equal to 15 + (2  your HD) + 2.

You get a +4 bonus on the Truespeak check because its your

personal truename.

Monk Abilities: A disciple of the word adds her class level

to her monk level to determine her class-based AC bonus, her

unarmed damage, unarmored speed bonus,  urry of blows

penalty, and the number of daily attempts of her Stunning

Fist feat.

If she has no monk levels, she gains the AC bonus of a

monk whose level equals her disciple of the word level, but

she doesnt add her Wisdom bonus to her AC. In addition,

she gains additional uses of the Stunning Fist feat as a monk.

(Her nonmonk, nondisciple of the word class levels provide

one use per four levels, and her monk and disciple of the

word class levels provide one use per level).

A disciple of the word does not count her class levels for

the purpose of determining when she gains any other monk

class features, such as reduced penalties for  urry of blows

attack rolls, bonus feats, evasion, or other special abilities.

Word of Movement Sublime (Su): You can channel your

ki into a single word of Truespeech. This spoken word allows

you, for a passing moment, to move as one with the restless

motion of the universe, stepping through the mundane world

with perfect grace. As a swift action, you can spend one of your

daily uses of the Stunning Fist feat and substitute a Truespeak

check in place of a Balance, Jump, or Tumble check.

Word  of  the  Stance  Unyielding  (Su): Beginning  at

2nd level, you can channel your ki while speaking a word of

Truespeech that allows you to stand fast, anchored to your

current  position  by  the  rigid  laws  of  the  universe.  As  an

immediate action, you can spend one of your daily uses of

the Stunning Fist feat and substitute a Truespeak check in

place of a Strength check to resist a trip, bull rush, or disarm

attempt.

Word of Health Restored (Sp): From 3rd level on, you

can use a word of Truespeech to focus your ki into your own

body. As a full-round action, you can spend one of your daily

uses of the Stunning Fist feat and make a Truespeak check

to heal yourself. You restore a number of hit points equal to

your character level. Using this ability provokes attacks of

opportunity, but you can attempt to use it defensively, exactly

as if it were a 3rd-level utterance.

Word  of  Movement  Perfected  (Su):  At  4th  level,  you

learn  a  word  of  Truespeech  that  allows  you  to  move  with

great speed and agility, striding swiftly over the contours of

the physical world. As a swift action, you can spend one of

your daily uses of the Stunning Fist feat and make a DC 25

Truespeak check to increase your base speed by 20 feet. In

addition, while this ability is active, you can walk on water,

quicksand, snow, or even a spiders web without sinking or

breaking through. You can take part of your movement for

the round to traverse a wall or other relatively smooth verti-

cal surface if you begin and end your move on a horizontal

surface. The height you can achieve on the wall is limited

only by your normal movement restrictions. If you do not

end your movement on a horizontal surface, you fall prone,

taking falling damage as appropriate for your distance above

the ground.

This bene t lasts for 1 round. This increase stacks with

other bonuses to your speed, such as from the haste spell or

a monks fast movement bonus.

Word  of  Re  exes  Exalted  (Su):  Beginning  at  5th

level,  you  can  focus  your  will  to  deliver  another  word  of

Truespeech.  As  an  immediate  action,  you  can  spend  one

of your daily uses of the Stunning Fist feat and substitute a

Truespeak check in place of a Re ex saving throw.

Word of the Strike Unstoppable (Su): From 6th level

on,  you  can  speak  a  word  of  Truespeech  and  overcome  a

creatures damage reduction. After a successful melee strike,

you can spend one of your daily uses of the Stunning Fist

feat as a swift action to attempt to bypass a targets damage

reduction. The DC of the Truespeak check depends on the

type of damage reduction that you are trying to overcome.

If the creatures damage reduction requires more than one

trait to overcome, chose the trait with the highest DC and

add 10 to that DC for each additional trait required. If the

creatures damage reduction is overcome by one of several

types of damage, use the lowest applicable DC.

Word of the Fist Unraveling (Su): At 7th level, you gain

the  ability  to  focus  your  ki  into  a  single  powerful  strike.

Accompanied  by  a  word  of  Truespeech,  this  ability  can

unravel magical effects. After a successful melee strike, you

can spend one of your daily uses of the Stunning Fist feat as

a swift action to attempt to dispel one effect currently on the

creature struck by the melee attack. This works like a targeted

dispel, except that you can only dispel the highest-level effect

currently affecting the target. You make a Truespeak check

opposed by a caster level check made by the caster of the

affected spell. If you are successful, the spell is dispelled.

If your check is unsuccessful, the spell remains in effect.

Regardless  of  the  result  of  the  opposed  check,  the  melee

attack deals damage normally.

Word  of  Harm  Avoided  (Ex):  Beginning  at  8th  level,

if  you  have  one  hand  free,  once  per  day  when  you  would

normally be hit with a weapon, you can de ect it so that you

take no damage from it. To negate the attack, you spend one of

your daily uses of the Stunning Fist feat and make a Truespeak

check, opposed by the attack roll of the attack that you are

attempting to negate. You must be aware of the attack and not

 at-footed. Attempting to de ect an attack is an immediate

action (an action you can take even when its not your turn,

but counts against the number of swift actions you can take

in a round). Unusually massive weapons (that is, any weapon

two or more size categories larger than you) or attacks gener-

ated by spell effects (Melfs acid arrow or shocking grasp) cant

be negated. You must use this ability after the result of the

attack roll is known but before damage is rolled.

Word of Mystic De  ection (Su): Starting at 9th level,

you can speak a word of Truespeech and prevent a hostile

spell from affecting you. When you are the sole target of a

spell (the spell must target you; this does not apply if you are

the sole individual in an area spell) that must overcome spell

resistance to have an effect, you can spend one of your daily

uses of the Stunning Fist feat and attempt a Truespeak check

as an immediate action. This Truespeak check is opposed by

the casters caster level check. If you succeed on this check,

the spell is negated. If you fail this check, you are subject

to the spells effect normally, including your chance to save

against the spells effect, if applicable.

Word of Speed Unfettered (Su): At 10th level, you can

speak a word of Truespeech and imbue your form with unpar-

alleled celerity. You can spend one of your daily uses of the

Stunning Fist feat and attempt a DC 50 Truespeak check as

an immediate action. If you succeed on this check, you gain

an additional move action that you must take immediately.

This ability might, among other things, allow you to move

and make a full attack in the same round.

Multiclass Note: Monks who multiclass into this prestige

class can continue advancing as monks.

PLAYING A DISCIPLE OF THE WORD

As a disciple of the word, you understand that reality, as most

know  it,  is  nothing  more  than  an  abstraction  of  the  true

formswords. All things are mere re ections, shadows of

217

the true form, and even other people are just  awed copies

of their true form. Thanks to your unusual outlook, you have

a hard time making friends, but thats not a problem. Mortal

friendships  can  never  compare  with  the  ideal  concept  of

friendship.

Being  a  disciple  of  the  word  means  you  are  part  of  the

Order of the Word, a group of like-minded individuals who

work  to  leave  behind  the   aws  of  the  physical  body  and

become one with the form from which they are modeled.

You might be the master of a particular enclave of monks

and the living embodiment of this goal, or you might be an

instructor at one of these rare monasteries.

COMBAT

Your advantage is your knowledge of Truespeech. It allows

you  to  avoid  damage,  to  heal  yourself,  and  gives  access  to

many other powerful abilities. In battle, use your mobility

to distract your opponents from attacking your allies. The

more  attacks  your  enemies  waste  trying  to  strike  you,  the

more attacks your companions can make against these same

opponents.

You should take advantage of your mobility and move to

 ank your foes with allied rogues and  ghters. Good position-

ing helps other characters make use of sneak attacks, and at

the very least provides a bonus on attack rolls. In these situa-

tions, its probably best to  ght defensively, and if you have it,

maximize your AC bonus from the Combat Expertise feat. At

5th level, not only can you get in and out of dangerous spots,

you  can  also  more  effectively  escape  harmful  area  effects.

Upon reaching 9th level, you can rest assured that you will

rarely be subject to a spell you dont want to affect you.

ADVANCEMENT

You probably started down the path of the disciple of the word

after  rst being exposed to the power of Truespeech, either in

the presence of a truenamer or another disciple of the word.

Another disciple of the word might have then recognized your

agility and combat skills, and told you there was a way to deny

the dangers posed by reality. You sought out the monks of the

Order of the Word and unlearned all your previous training,

for once you saw their techniques in practice, you had to  nd

the key to unlocking those abilities yourself.

Long hours of study and training  nally paid off, and you

are constantly amazed at how easily you can shape a battle to

your own ends now that you know the secrets of truenaming.

Though you are not required to spend all your days at the

monastery, you often retreat there for further training and

education.  Then  again,  you  might  remain  at  a  monastery

for years, only emerging when you feel a call to explore or

adventure, to advance the perfect forms through intervention

when the forces of entropy assert themselves.

As you continue to awaken your true form, you have many

opportunities  to  develop  your   ghting  skills.  Spend  skill

points on movement skills such as Climb, Jump, and Tumble.

Its a good idea to invest in feats that work well with your class

abilities, so be sure to pick up feats such as De ect Arrows,

Run, and Spring Attack.

RESOURCES

Though you might wander far from your teachers and school,

you can always return. For you, it is a safe haven, a place to

heal  or  hide.  The  Order  of  the  Word  provides  free  food,

lodging, and basic supplies to all its members. They maintain

friendly relations with local clerics of Zuoken (see page 124

of Complete Divine or page 221 of Expanded Psionics Handbook)

who always have a shrine dedicated to the demigod within

the monasteries walls. Disciples gain access to free healing

from those clerics, as well.

DISCIPLES OF THE WORD

IN THE WORLD

Though we walk different roads, the paths converge at the same

end.

Utod, Fist of Zuoken

A  disciple  of  the  word  combines  truenaming  and  martial

arts, representing the pinnacle of what a person can achieve

by  devoting  herself  to  reaching  her  true  form.  Disciples

can  appear  in  any  campaign,  originating  in  small  shrines

in mountain aeries or well-defended and enormous martial

arts schools taught by ancient masters.

DAILY LIFE

As important as it is for disciples to focus on their personal

training, they do so by following the principles of self-dis-

cipline and mental prowess as scribed in the sacred scroll

NEW MARTIAL ART:

WORD GIVEN FORM MASTERY

First introduced in Oriental Adventures, martial arts styles are

added benefits gained when a character takes a particular as-

sortment  of  feats.  A  character  who  masters  the  feats  within

a  style  gains  a  mastery  ability  related  to  the  techniques  of

that  style.  Word  Given  Form  emphasizes  the  harmony  of  the

disciples truename. By repeating his truename in combat, he

can blur his form against a particular target.

WORD GIVEN FORM

You have mastered the martial arts style of Word Given Form.

Prerequisites: Truespeak 12 ranks, Tumble 12 ranks, Combat

Expertise, Dodge, Improved Unarmed Strike, Mobility, Spring

Attack.

Benefit:  When  using  the  Dodge  feat  against  an  opponent,

in  addition  to  the  +1  dodge  bonus  to  AC,  you  also  gain  total

concealment (50% miss chance) from that opponent as your

form blurs and shifts.

of Akahuza. Each day, disciples speak the holy sutra to help

order their minds. A disciple  rst speaks her truename fol-

lowed by an invocation to the self, calling for the blessing

of  Zuoken  to  strengthen  the  body,  mind,  and  soul,  while

asking for the strength of mind to see beyond the illusion

that is reality.

Many disciples leave their mon-

asteries  to  explore  the  world

and  derive  a  deeper  under-

standing of their place within

it.  A  few,  however,  found

schools of their own, where

they  instruct  new  students

in  keeping  the  words  of

Akahuza and the principles

of Zuoken alive. As a sensei,

a disciple must select viable

candidates  through  careful

testing,  to  see  if  they  have

the dedication to succeed in

the Akahuza style while also

looking for those with at least

some  fundamental  under-

standing  of  Truespeech.

The  rst students trained

become  instructors  and

administrators,  teaching

new students and managing

the monasterys resources.

the shrines gate, there stood the old man, though how he

came to be there, Akahuza could not say. Bowing deeply to

the elder, the wanderer tried to move past him, but the elder,

faster than seemed possible, intercepted him. Two more at-

tempts and the master blocked him. Then the old man spoke

a single word and everything bent

around  them,  as  if  the  world

folded  in  on  itself.  Akahuza

knew then he had found what

he sought.

Thirty years later, Akahu-

za returned to his homeland

and  founded  the  Order  of

the  Word.  As  his  follow-

ers built the school around

him, he penned the essential

principles of the art, writing

just  one  character  each  day.

When  the  school  was  com-

plete,  so  was  Akahuzas

writing,  and  with  the   nal

character  written  he  died.

Over  the  next  200  years,

the Order of the Word grew

around the teachings set out

in the sacred scroll, and the

knowledge contained inside

resulted in the  rst disciples

of the word.

NOTABLES

Three  centuries  ago,  Aka-

huza,  a  monk  and  student

of  Zuokens  teachings,  was

dissatis ed with the path of

war advanced by the Fists of

Zuoken.  Akahuza  believed

there  was  another  way  to

master  self-discipline.  He

traveled to different schools

all  over  the  land,  study-

ing  with  the  tattooed  monks,

drunken masters, void disciples, and

dozens  of  other  schools,  but  each  left

him dissatis ed. So he wandered farther,

listening to the words in the wind and the pulse in the earth,

following the  ow of the clouds until he came upon a shrine

deep within a rain forest. There, he found an old man living

alone who did nothing except stare at a single rune carved

in the wall. The man did not speak, but he did not rebuff

Akahuzas help either. The two men lived in silence; the elder

studied the sigil, the younger studied the elder.

Weeks turned to months and months turned to years, and

still the old man never spoke. Finally, Akahuza, in his per-

plexity, made ready to leave, gathering what supplies he had,

thinking his time was wasted. As he turned to go through

ORGANIZATION

The  modern  Order  of  the

Word  retains  the  original

structure   rst  set  out  by

Akahuza all those years ago.

At  a  monastery,  a  master

guides  his  favored  pupils

who  in  turn  instruct  the

students. Though many dis-

ciples  wander  the  world  in

search of themselves and their

place, many more are content to

stay on with their comrades and learn

the greater mysteries of their path.

Kordi Senade, a dwarf disciple of the word

No  single  overarching  master

governs the Order of the Word. Rather, several masters care

for their particular schools. Since this is a group built on the

ideals of peace and self-improvement, it has little room for

rivalry or tensions between the schools. Occasionally, one

monastery  hosts  a  tournament,  and  these  exciting  events

draw disciples from all over the world, and in some cases,

from  across  the  planes.  Students  compete  to  demonstrate

their mastery of Akahuzas teachings, and the contests end

when the top three students remain. These champions are

immediately elevated to master status and given the funds

to found their own monasteries.

NPC REACTIONS

Even  though  disciples  pursue  a  different  path  from  that

walked by other followers of Zuoken, they still pay homage

to  the  god  and  enjoy  his  blessings.  Clerics  and  monks  of

Zuoken are always friendly or even helpful to disciples. Other

monks look upon disciples as strange and unusual, but their

suspicions rarely worsen their attitudes below indifferent.

Disciples are a peaceful group, so they have few enemies.

Still,  some  creatures  oppose  peace  and  see  those  who

embrace that path as a threat to their goals. Evil monks are

always  unfriendly  if  not  hostile.  Chaotic  characters  share

the  same  suspicions,  especially  barbarians,  who  thrive  on

anarchy.  These  individuals  are  often  unfriendly  or  worse,

attempting to destroy that which they cannot understand.

DISCIPLE OF THE WORD LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge

(history) can research disciples of the word to learn more

about them. Characters who worship Zuoken receive a +5 cir-

cumstance bonus on these checks. When a character makes

a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, including the

information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Some monks believe that only through avoiding

con ict can they understand the nature of reality.

DC 15: The disciples of the word are masters of movement,

physically melding both form and idea.

DC 20: Disciples are not so much opposed to con ict as

they are committed to perfecting their physical forms. By

developing themselves, they avoid injury.

DC 30: The Order of the Word was founded by Akahuza,

a mystic and monk who unlocked the truth about himself

through Truespeech.

DISCIPLES OF THE WORD

IN THE GAME

Disciples of the word can be featured in any campaign. A myste-

rious mountain school might be an institution run by the Order

of the Word. If you use psionics, they could be an outgrowth

of the  st of Zuoken prestige class. Most disciples, however,

will have an appeal to players. The class represents an excellent

avenue for introducing truename magic into an ongoing cam-

paign by blending the monk with the truenamer class.

The disciple of the word prestige class appeals to players

who  like  martial  arts  and  the  mysticism  often  associated

with  them.  While  providing  interesting  combat  abilities,

this class also offers a means to ground such characters into

a campaign and let them develop their abilities through a

compelling spiritual journey of self-discovery.

ADAPTATION

The disciples need not be a group committed to improving

themselves.  Instead,  they  could  be  a  group  that  advances

their physical combat techniques to breed a powerful army

of  assassins  bent  on  conquering  the  world.  In  this  case,

you  will  want  to  make  the  alignment  prerequisite  lawful

evil. Also, you will want to divorce this class from Zuoken

altogether and replace him with a suitably sinister deity such

as Ilsensine of the mind  ayers or even Hextor, the god of

tyranny.  Alternatively,  the  disciples  could  become  a  force

for  good  that  emphasizes  how  striving  to  perfect  the  self

allows a better understanding of the world, which ultimately

distances an individual from evil. In such a case, Heironeous

is a great substitute deity.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Disciples are often allies and advisors, helping PCs overcome

a  dif cult  puzzle  or  defeat  a  particularly  nasty  adversary.

As  opponents,  they  are  frustrating  enemies,  avoiding  and

evading attacks with ease. A disciple might even grow bored

with the  ght after a time and leave, an act sure to infuriate

aggressive PCs.

after a band of devils destroyed her monastery. Hot on her

heels is a bone devil that wants nothing more than to feast

on her  esh. When Kordi rounds the corner, either in a city

or in the wilderness, the bone devil uses major image to mask

its appearance and assume the guise of a noble paladin.

FIENDBINDER

Forgive the foul language, but my babau demon prefers eviscera-

tions to diplomacy.

Nivir the  endbinder

A  endbinder seeks to unlock the truenames of demons,

devils,  and  other  vile   ends,  and  use

that  knowledge  to  bind  them

to  service.  The  actual  binding

rituals  can  be  quite  complex,

so  a  fiendbinder  must  also

be  a  practiced  student  of  the

summoning  arts.  However,

even  the  most  gifted

fiendbinder  plays  a

dangerous  game,  for

though  she  can  enslave  the  wicked  and  compel   ends  to

act  in  accordance  with  her  wishes,   ends  are  notoriously

willful, disagreeable, and at times outright disobedient. A

 endbinder relies on her truespeaking ability to control her

 endish thrall, all the while knowing that it craves only its

freedom and the  endbinders blood.

BECOMING A

FIENDBINDER

Most  endbinders are arcane spell-

casters. However, a few unscrupulous

clerics dedicate themselves to learning

the complex rituals and truenames

needed  to  bind  terrible   ends  to

service. Even though binding

a   end  might  be  viewed

as punishment or torment (certainly thats what the  end

thinks), good-aligned characters cant bring themselves to

become  endbinders and endorse what amounts to slavery.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any nongood

Skills: Knowledge (the planes) 10 ranks, Speak Language

(Abyssal), Speak Language (Infernal), Truespeak 10 ranks

Spells: Ability to cast summon monster IV

CLASS FEATURES

You can research and learn the truenames of  ends, as well

as complex rituals needed to foist your will upon them. As

you gain more power and con dence as a  endbinder, you

learn to call forth  ends that are more inclined to heed your

commands and, eventually, you will earn their respect.

Spellcasting: At each level except 1st, 5th, and 9th, you

gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and

spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level

in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding

the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other

bene t a character of that class would have gained. If you

had  more  than  one  spellcasting  class  before  becoming  a

 endbinder, you must decide to which class to add each level

for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level,

and spells known.

Bind Fiend (Su): You master the complex rituals needed

to  bind  a   end  whose  truename  you  know.  You  must  pay

an amount in gold to cover the cost of the ritual (see Table

39), and the ritual takes 8 uninterrupted hours to perform.

At the conclusion of the ritual, the  end appears. The  end

is bound against its will and isnt happy about the service.

However, it cannot attack you, even if you attack it. Giving

it a command is a standard action that provokes attacks of

opportunity, for doing so requires that you correctly utter

the   ends  truename.  You  must  make  a  Truespeak  check

with a speci ed DC (see Table 39). If the check succeeds,

the  end is compelled to do as you command; if the check

fails, the  end gleefully resists (and might even mock you).

A bound  end performs only one of the commands outlined

in Table 310 at one time. Issuing a new command (includ-

Table 38: The Fiendbinder

Hit Die: d6

ing ordering a bound  end to attack a different foe) requires

another standard action and another Truespeak check. You

can give a bound  end commands other than those found

on Table 310, but these sample commands will cover most

circumstances (and the DM always has the power to veto a

potential command).

Unless it is commanded to do otherwise, a bound  end

must remain within 10 feet of you at all times. If a bound

 end moves more than 1 mile from you, it gets an immedi-

ate Will save (DC 10 + your  endbinder level + your Cha

modi er)  to  break  the  bond.  A  bound   end  can  usually

only attain this distance from its master due to a careless

command. If it is freed in this manner, it is immediately

sent back to the place whence it came. You can free a bound

 end  yourself  as  a  free  action.  Although  a  newly  freed

 end might cry vengeance for the punishment you have

in icted upon it, few  ends act on their threats for fear of

being bound again. Only by repeatedly binding the same

 end do you run the risk of incurring its wrath once freed

(DMs discretion).

You can bind multiple  ends if you have the gold and time

to do so. However, you cannot issue the same command to

multiple bound  ends. For example, if you bind two vrock

demons and want them to attack the same foe, commanding

them  to  attack  requires  two  standard  actions  (one  per

vrock).

A bound  end cannot use its summoning ability. Unlike

summoned  creatures,  bound   ends  are  truly  dead  when

slain.

If you are killed, any  end that was bound to you prior to

your death stays with your remains for 24 hours. It does not

guard whatever is left of your body; it merely remains nearby,

tracking the passing time intently to determine if it will be

set free. If you are returned to life during that period through

a raise dead spell or similar effect, the  end remains bound

to your service with no additional cost to you, provided you

are still of a suf cient level to retain the  ends service. If

you lose a level as a result of a return to life, and your new

level is too low for you to have summoned your servant (see

Table 39 to determine what level you need to be to bind a

particular  end servant), your servant is immediately freed

from service. Otherwise, if 24 hours pass and you remain

dead, the  end is released from service and sent back to the

place  whence  it  camewith  your  soul  in  towcackling

maniacally. At that point, only a true resurrection spell can

return you to life, but if you are brought back, your  end

comes back with you, still bound to your service and with

no additional cost to you.

Stand watch for 8 hours and raise alarm if needed

Undertake repetitive labor for 1 hour

Use a skill on your behalf

Use a spell-like ability on your behalf

Call  Forth  Fiend  (Sp):  Upon  reaching  3rd  level,  you

gain the service of a particularly loyal  end. By uttering its

truename, you can call it forth and command it to serve you.

Regardless of its alignment, the  end respects your power

and regards you as a powerful ally.

Once per day, as a standard action, you can magically call

forth this  end from the hateful realm where it resides. The

 end can be any of the ones mentioned on Table 39 (above).

Calling forth the  end requires a successful Truespeak check

(DC 15 + [2   ends CR]), and you must choose the type of

 end you intend to call before you make the check. If the

check succeeds, the  end immediately appears adjacent to

you and remains for 1 round per  endbinder level; it can be

dismissed  at  any  time  with  a  free  action.  The   end  is  the

same creature each time it is called, though you can release

a particular  end from service. Each time the  end is called,

it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it might

have taken previously. Any equipment the  end acquires gets

left behind when it returns to its realm. Calling a  end is a

conjuration (calling) effect.

If the  end dies, it immediately disappears, leaving behind

any equipment it did not bring with it from its native realm.

You  cannot  call  forth  another   end  using  this  ability  for

thirty  days  or  until  you  gain  another   endbinder  level,

whichever comes  rst, even if the  end is somehow returned

from the dead. During this thirty-day period, you take a 2

penalty on Truespeak checks.

Bind  Tormented  Soul  (Su):  The  Lower  Planes  house

countless tormented souls, for they are the primordial soup

from which myriad  ends are born. At 5th level, once per

day  you  can  utter  the  truename  of  a  tormented  soul  and

bind its essence within yourself. Your eyes turn dead black,

your complexion pales, and black veins form just under your

skin until the tormented soul is released or destroyed. The

tormented soul has no alignment or awareness, per se, and

cannot be held at bay using magic circle spells and similar

effects.

Binding a tormented soul is a swift action that provokes

attacks  of  opportunity  and  requires  a  DC  30  Truespeak

check. If the check succeeds, you harness its suffering and

become inured to pain. You can continue to act normally

even  when  disabled  (reduced  to  0  hit  points)  or  dying

(reduced to 1 to 9 hit points). Furthermore, you do not die

if you are reduced to 10 hit points or lower. Instead, while

you are in this condition, you can take a single move action

or standard action each turn (but not both, nor can you take

full-round  actions);  although  you  can  take  a  move  action

without further injuring yourself, performing any standard

action  (or  any  other  action  the  DM  deems  as  strenuous,

including some free actions) deals 1 point of damage to you

after the act is completed.

The  tormented  soul  is  unstable  and  destroyed  in  short

order. You can bind it for only 3 rounds. Once the tormented

soul is gone, you immediately incur the normal effects for

being at 0 hit points or negative hit points (if your hit point

total  when  the  soul  departs  is  at  0  or  below).  In  addition,

assuming you survive the ordeal, you are fatigued for 1 hour

(if you are already fatigued, you are exhausted instead). You

can  voluntarily  release  a  bound  tormented  soul  as  a  free

action but still endure the effects noted above.

Gift of the Arch  end (Su): Beginning at 9th level, once

per day you can demand the attention of a powerful demon

prince of the Abyss or infernal archduke of the Nine Hells

and,  by  uttering  its  truename,  convince  the  arch end  to

invest you with a fragment of its might. The arch end does

not appear before you, but you become suffused with a gift of

Abyssal or infernal power. Such a gift is usually an arch ends

way of attempting to win your fealty or obedience and should

never be misconstrued as a sign of trust or obligation. You

must have spent at least one week researching the personal

truename of a potential demon prince or archduke of hell,

and 1,000 gp (for each name learned). Each use of this ability

lasts for 1 minute per class level. Provided you have learned

a truename for at least one archduke and one demon prince,

you  can  gain  either  bene t  of  this  abilityyou  choose

whenever you activate it.

Securing  the  arch ends  gift  is  a  standard  action  and

requires a DC 35 Truespeak check. If the check succeeds,

you gain one of the following bene ts from your  endish

benefactor:

223

Baatezu Traits: If your gift comes from an infernal archduke

of the Nine Hells, you gain damage reduction 5/good and

silver, darkvision out to 60 feet, immunity to  re and poison,

and resistance to acid 10 and cold 10. In addition, you can see

perfectly in darkness of any kind (even that created by the

deeper darkness spell).

Tanarri Traits: If your gift comes from a demon prince of

the Abyss, you gain damage reduction 5/cold iron and good,

darkvision out to 60 feet, immunity to electricity and poison,

and resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and  re 10.

Double Command (Ex): At 9th level, you have become

more adept at commanding the  end in your service. You

can  attempt  to  give  it  two  commands  to  be  performed

in  sequence  with  a  single  Truespeak  check,  but  doing  so

increases the Truespeak check DC by 5.

If  you  have  bound  multiple   ends,  you  can  now  also

give up to two  ends a single command (each  end can be

given the same or a different command) as a single standard

action.

Arch  ends Favor (Su): At 10th level, you have attained

a tremendous amount of knowledge regarding how to deal

with  ends. You gain a bonus on Charisma-based skill checks

dealing with demons and devils equal to 1/2 your class level

(or +5 at 10th level).

Summon Fiends (Sp): Once per day, at 10th level, you

can summon either a baatezu legion (1d6 bone devils or 1d4

barbed devils) or tanarri horde (1d6 vrocks or 1d4 hezrous)

as a full-round action. The  endish legion or horde appears at

the beginning of your next turn. This ability is the equivalent

of a 9th-level spell (caster level equals your character level).

PLAYING A FIENDBINDER

You enslave  ends and call upon the power of evil to accom-

plish your goals. For these reasons, other spellcasters both

admire and fear you. They see you barking orders to the most

vile creatures the universe can imagine, and they wonder

whether you are the corrupt vassal of some evil arch end,

a fearless conjurer of words with the armies of the Lower

Planes at your beck and call, or simply a fool. You do not fear

that which you can control, and regardless of what you think

of  ends personally, they certainly have their uses. But you

are no fool: Some  ends simply cannot be controlled, and

you are wise to let them be.

The  parochial  and  the  uninitiated  view  you  as  a  threat

because of your willingness to truck with  ends, never mind

your ability to command them. You often need to conceal

your true nature, lest fearful locals decapitate you and reduce

your body to ashes for your perceived allegiance to the dark

powers. Dark powers, indeed!

As a  endbinder, you might belong to any one of a number

of secret cabals that summon and bind  ends, not the least

among them the Fifth Candle. Members of the Fifth Candle

gather in hidden redoubts to practice their conjuration ritu-

als. The cabal takes its name from the pentagrams that its

members  use  during  these  rituals  and  the  candles  placed

on  the  corners  of  these  symbols.  Fiendbinders  are  few  in

number, and they exercise a great deal of personal freedom.

They exchange rituals like recipes, but they are less inclined

to  share  new  truenames  that  they  have  discoveredthey

engage in some name trading, but the names theyre willing

to share usually belong to the most obnoxious or disgusting

 ends.

The  end you bind becomes your most stalwart compan-

ion, for it cannot betray you despite its inherent belligerence.

It wont break free of your hold, but to control it you must

learn to speak its truename properly. Each new command

requires subtle permutations and speci c in ections. You

can expect the  end to laugh in your face when you fail and

curse you with horrible prognostications of your eventual

doom when you succeedthough it serves you as a compan-

ion, it is not and never will be your friend.

Demons  are  particularly  temperamental  and  frequently

entertain thoughts of ripping off your face and feasting on

your entrails. These tirades, though vulgar and appalling,

are usually empty threats. Once a bound demon is released,

it quickly becomes distracted by all the other things it hates

and seldom rears its ugly head again. Sure, you can try to bind

ROLEPLAYING A FIEND

As a DM, you can view this prestige class as a chance to hone

your acting skills behind the screen when a character wants to

take levels as a fiendbinder. Each bound fiend should have its

own set of personality quirks and oddities of behavior, but they

all loathe the situation they find themselves in. Here are some

roleplaying behaviors a fiend can exhibit from time to time. As

with any quirk, such behavior can lose its charm if overdone, but

feel free to have some fun with your players choice.

special attention to its masters foibles.

(cid:129)  Mock  the  fiends  master  whenever  he  fails  his  Truespeak

(cid:129)  When the fiends master is wounded, make remarks such

as, That looked like it hurt, master and other patronizing

comments.

(cid:129)  Have the fiend describe in gory detail the horror that awaits

the same demon again, but why take a chance? After all, the

Abyss holds an in nite number of them.

Devils, by contrast, are far more subtle and condescend-

ing. They will remind you how dangerous binding can be,

tell  you  stories  about  binding  rituals  that  went  horribly

awry,  and  slyly  convince  you  to  give  them  speci c  orders

that serve some secret, personal agenda. When you fail to

speak their truenames perfectly, they belittle and mock you.

They  compare  you  unfavorably  to  other,  more  successful

 endbinders.  Some  devils  dont  mind  being  bound  more

than once if they think they can somehow corrupt you in

the process. However, be careful: They are consummate liars

and can hold a grudge for a long time.

Beyond demons and devils,  ends are a truly mixed bag,

but they do share some common traits: They are universally

evil and reprehensible. If youre evil yourself, you and your

 endish thrall might enjoy exploring some new depths of

depravity together. Otherwise, you should exercise caution

when  trading  words  with  bound   ends.  In  fact,  youre

probably better off keeping the relationship as simple as

possible. Give them an inch, and they will feast on your

soul.

COMBAT

Some bound  ends have spell-like abilities that might bene t

you or other members of the adventuring party, such as an

ice devils  y ability or a mariliths align weapon ability. Try

to use these before entering the  eld of battle.

Fiendbinders,  like  sorcerers  and  wizards,  prefer  to  do

their damage from afar. That means sending your  endish

minions into battle while you take cover, position yourself

within easy reach of the party cleric, and bark commands.

If your bound  end dies, you need to spend gold to replace

it, so be ready to command it to teleport to the party cleric if

its in imminent danger of dying.

Some of your higher-level abilities, such as bind tormented

soul and gift of the arch end, greatly improve your chances

of survival in the heat of battle, perhaps giving you the cour-

age to wade into the fray and deliver some touch attacks or

use other close-range spells or abilities. Canny foes will try

to take you out of the  ght early, knowing that your bound

 end  will  likely  cease  to  participate  in  the  battle  as  soon

as you die. Situations when you become the focus of your

enemies wrath are when your bind tormented soul ability

truly comes in handy.

ADVANCEMENT

To become a  endbinder, you need to master the summon

monster IV spell and relinquish any misgivings you might

have about enslaving  ends to do your bidding.

Secret organizations such as the Fifth Candle have modest

libraries that can make researching truenames and rituals

easier, but most  endbinder cabals are too small (1d4+2 mem-

bers) to warrant a structured hierarchy. You wont  nd many

trustworthy mentors to guide you, and most  endbinders

explore their craft in relative isolation.

You will want to take multiple levels in this class to gain

more powerful  end servants, as well as draw power from

arch ends whose truenames you can speak with con dence.

You will also want to improve your Truespeak skill as much

as  possible.  The  Truename  Training  feat  and  Skill  Focus

(Truespeak) are invaluable for this purpose. Obscure Personal

Truename can also be handy if you repeatedly summon a

particular  end that swears revenge against you.

RESOURCES

Cabals such as the Fifth Candle generally leave  endbind-

ers to pursue their own goals without providing signi cant

assistance. Such organizations might sponsor expeditions to

dungeons and ruins formerly overrun with demon or devil

worshipers in the hopes of uncovering fragments of ancient

lore, codices of binding rituals, or truenames lost to the ages.

If you can convince members of a cabal that such a dungeon

or ruin is worth exploring, they might cover part of the cost

of your latest binding ritual or teach you the truename of

a fairly compliant  end. They might also let you use their

modest library to research truenames on your own.

Should you incur the wrath of a powerful  end, you prob-

ably wont get much support or sympathy from your fellow

cabal members. Fiendbinders must understand the nature

of their power and learn to deal with the consequences on

their own.

FIENDBINDERS IN THE WORLD

Those who command  ends are  ends.

Sir Taron Jellikor, Knight of the Sacred Sword

Not all  endbinders are evil, but they must learn to negotiate

with evil in a way that few good-aligned characters can abide

or truly understand. A  endbinder and her enslaved  end

might not be welcome additions to every party of adventur-

ers, but a group composed of neutral characters might learn

to value a  ends combat abilities.

DAILY LIFE

You  keep  strange  company,  and  consequently  you  should

expect to be greeted with suspicion, resentment, or panic

wherever you goparticularly if you have a retriever demon

dogging your heels. If you live in a civilized area, you must

 nd clever ways to hide or disguise your boon companion so

that you can conduct your daily affairs with few unwanted

distractions, brutal stonings, or merciless eviscerations. You

would be wise to seek good companyperhaps join a small

group of like-minded adventurers willing to entertain your

predilection for truenames and complex rituals. Your typical

day isnt much different from what it was before you became

a   endbinder,  except  that  you  must  periodically  devote  8

hours to performing a binding ritual.

Your bound  end does not require food, drink, or sleep,

but  it  stays  in  fairly  close  proximity  to  you  most  of  the

time and demands most of your attention throughout the

day.  Even  the  relatively  quiet  ones  have  their  disgusting

225

habitsincessant drooling, gnashing of teeth, or slurping,

for example. As a  endbinder, you must learn to live with

the worst of them.

NOTABLES

Dzaktran  the  Fiendslaver  is  a  recent  poster  boy  for  evil

 endbinders.  He  aspires  to  win  the  favor  of  Grazzt  and

has dedicated his life to gathering lost relics for the demon

prince. Dzaktran has been seen in the company of various

 ends over the past several monthsa babau, a succubus,

and most recently a hellcatand the Church of St. Cuthbert

has placed a 5,000 gp bounty on the  endbinders head. The

bounty comes as a surprise to many, but Dzaktran recently

attacked a temple of St. Cuthbert in a brazen attempt to steal

an evil relic locked away in its vaults. The attack failed, but

the  clerics  of  St.  Cuthbert  arent  eager  to  face  him  or  his

demonic minions again soon.

On the other hand, Argath Snowbeard is a dwarf  end-

binder  whose  intentions  seem  somewhat  more  benign.

Argath and his bound ice devil recently inherited a stone

tower just outside the small mining town of Silverlode. The

towers  previous  denizena  reclusive  and  cantankerous

wizard known only as Firestarslipped and fell on the ice

devils spear (or so Argath claims). For reasons he doesnt care

to explain, Argath has taken to slaughtering evil monsters in

the nearby hills and keeping the townsfolk safe from harm.

The locals ensure that the dwarf remains well fed and dont

ask too many questions, and Argath does his utmost to keep

the ice devil out of sight.

ORGANIZATION

With  over  a  dozen  members,  the  Fifth  Candle  represents

an  atypically  large  cabal  of   endbinders.  Its  members  are

scattered across the realm, and rarely will you see more than

 ve in any given place at the same time. Most of them are

practiced truenamers with 1d6 levels of  endbinder; one or

two might have started their adventuring careers as clerics

or wizards before gravitating toward the study of truenames.

Members can leave the Fifth Candle at any time, although

few  are  inclined  to.  The  cabal  welcomes  members  of  any

alignment (with the caveat that good characters cannot be

 endbinders),  and  members  are  required  to  endure  each

others worst habits.

Members of the Fifth Candle seldom use their own real

names. Currently, the most powerful member of the Fifth

Candle is a gaunt fellow with strawlike hair known as Callow

(LE  male  human  conjurer  7/ endbinder  6).  Callows  real

name is Avastor Kastiranti. Callow collects books about the

Nine Hells and fancies himself a scion of Asmodeus, but he

mostly keeps to himself. He also publishes a monthly paper

called The Fifth Candle, which he distributes to other cabal

members as well as a few select wizards with whom he con-

ducts business. The paper contains rambling dissertations on

the politics of the Nine Hells and illuminating facts about

its various archdukes and vassals.

No member of the Fifth Candle holds sway over any other,

but Callow likes to tyrannically govern meetings whenever

they  occur.  His  greatest  rival  is  a  brusque  woman  with

raven-black  hair  known  as  Saragwah  (NE  female  human

wizard 7/truenamer 3/ endbinder 3). For a while, Saragwah

(real name Morgan Taravello) enjoyed a particularly friendly

relationship with a succubus companion named Lurya, but

they recently had a falling out. Now she parades around with

a hellcat that likes to hide in the light.

NPC REACTIONS

Most people share a dim view of  endbinders. If you travel

in the company of  ends, you can expect to meet people with

unfriendly attitudes. Most folk arent likely to threaten you

with violence while your ice devil or marilith stands nearby,

but the city watch might demand that you leave the city at

once and never return. If youre not careful, you might  nd

yourself looking down the greatsword of a righteous paladin

who has no patience for your craft.

In  some  ways,  your  greatest  enemies  are  the  unwilling

 ends  you  bind  to  service.  They  hate  and  fear  you,  and  if

youre not careful, they might share information with your

enemies or do things that just plain annoy you. (See that

scrawny man in the black robe hiding behind the cleric over

there? He commanded me to attack you, but if you kill him

quickly,  Ill  think  twice  about  feasting  on  your  entrails.)

Bound  ends have an unfriendly or hostile attitude toward

you initially, but they can be swayed; however, Diplomacy

checks made to improve their attitude are made with a 5

penalty, and a bound  end that becomes indifferent, friendly,

or helpful might not stay that way for long.

FIENDBINDER LORE

Characters  with  ranks  Knowledge  (arcana),  Knowledge

(local), or Knowledge (the planes), or who have the bardic

knowledge ability, can research  endbinders to learn more

about  them.  When  a  character  makes  a  check,  read  or

paraphrase the following, including the information from

lower DCs.

DC 10: Fiendbinders study the truenames of  ends and

use  that  knowledge  to  bind  them  to  service.  The  binding

rituals  can  be  quite  expensive,  depending  on  the   end

summoned.

DC 15: A bound  end might serve a  endbinder for years,

and only the  endbinder can release it from service. Killing

the  endbinder can also release the  end from service.

DC 20: By invoking the truename of a demon prince or

archduke, a truly powerful  endbinder can gain some of that

arch ends power.

DC 30: The largest cabal of  endbinders is known as the

Fifth Candle. Its members, though scattered and relatively

few in number, command many powerful  ends.

Locating  a   endbinder  cabal  requires  a  DC  40  Gather

Information check. Success leads to a known member of the

cabal or the cabals secret gathering place (DMs discretion).

FIENDBINDERS IN THE GAME

Nivir

CR 8

Incorporating  endbinders into your campaign should be

effortless. Fiendbinders harness evil for their own ends, tis

true, but their reasons for binding  ends are not necessarily

malevolent. Most bound  ends view forced servitude as a

form of torment or punishment, and some good-aligned char-

acters can live with that, particularly once the  endbinder

reassures them that the  end cannot break free.

A player character  endbinder isnt much different from a

cleric with a planar ally. Yes,  ends make unpleasant travel-

ing companions, what with their endless cursing, chiding,

and complaining. However, with  end in tow, a  endbinder

can chase the partys various altruistic or sel sh goals and sic

the  end on evil creatures that stand in their way. The chaotic

good wizard who whined about the succubus coming on to

him might get over it after she charms a few monsters and

plants a few wet kisses on a villain standing in the partys

way.

ADAPTATION

The DM should feel free to drop the nongood alignment

requirement  of  the  prestige  class  if  it  suits  her  campaign,

particularly if she intends to create a cabal of good-aligned

 endbinders that deliberately enslaves  ends and uses them

to  ght other evils of the world.

A DM might add more  ends to Table 39. In general, a

character can bind any  end with a CR equal to his character

level minus 2. For example, a 7th-level truenamer/1st-level

 endbinder  can  bind  any   end  of  CR  6  or  less.  However,

some   ends  that   t  this  basic  prerequisite  should  not  be

included  without  careful  consideration.  Huge   ends  and

 ends  with  situational  abilities  (such  as  the  chain  devil,

with  its  dancing  chains  ability)  can  make  the  bind   end

ability seem unbalanced, in which case the DM might want

to change the formula (character level minus 3) or make a

 end  easier  or  more  dif cult  to  control  (by  increasing  or

decreasing the DC for the Truespeak checks by 2).

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

The  endbinder described below would make a  ne nemesis

for a party of good-aligned heroes or a tenuous colleague for

a morally or ethically challenged adventuring party.

EL 8: Nivir recently had a revelationnamely, she prefers

the company of  ends to that of most people. Not surpris-

ingly, this confused cleric of Fharlanghn has a few issues to

work through. In the past year alone, she has joined forces

with  ve different adventuring parties, scouring dungeons

for riches and looking for something, although shes not sure

what. Although she can be charming when things go her

way, she eventually grows impatient and frustrated with her

companions and storms off in a huff. Now she has a babau

demon thrall to remind her how distasteful people are, and

amazingly, she agrees with it most of the time.

an attempt to speak your personal truename, it immediately

takes 1d6 points of damage for every Hit Die you have.

Normal: The consequence for failing a Truespeak check

to  say  someones  personal  truename  is  that  the  utterance,

truename spell, or other ability fails as well.

TRUENAME REBUTTAL

You  are  particularly  good  at  negating  other  truenamers

power with well-chosen truenames.

Prerequisite: Ability to speak utterances.

Bene  t: You gain a +4 bonus on Truespeak checks made

to counter or dispel the utterances of other truespeakers.

Normal: Countering and dispelling attempts use opposed

Truespeak checks between the original truenamer and the

one trying to end the utterance.

TRUENAME RESEARCH

You have a knack for uncovering the personal truenames of

friends and foes alike through study and investigation.

Prerequisite: Truespeak 9 ranks.

Bene  t: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge checks made

to  discover  a  creatures  personal  truename  (as  described

in Truename Research, page 196). In addition, the cost to

research a personal truename is reduced by half.

TRUENAME TRAINING

Unlike most of your peers, you have discovered the secret

power of truenames.

Bene  t:  The  Truespeak  skill  is  considered  a  class  skill

for  you,  no  matter  what  class  you  actually  choose.  If  you

purchased  ranks  in  Truespeak  as  a  cross-class  skill,  you

immediately gain additional ranks in Truespeak as if it had

always been a class skill for you.

Normal:  The  Truespeak  skill  is  a  class  skill  only  for

truenamers.

rarily; you speak your personal truename and add a little

extra.

All recitations are full-round actions that provoke attacks

of  opportunity.  They  require  Truespeak  checks  because

you must correctly speak your own personal truename. The

DC for the Truespeak check is 15 + (2  your HD) + 2, once

you increase the DC by 2 for speaking a personal truename.

Because its your own personal truename, you get a +4 com-

petence bonus on your Truespeak check.

To learn a recitation, you must take the appropriate feat.

Truenamers gain a bonus recitation feat at 8th level and again

at 15th level.

RECITATION OF THE

FORTIFIED STATE

This recitation allows you to stand unyielding against the

blows of your enemies.

Prerequisites: Truespeak 9 ranks, ability to speak utter-

ances, must know your own personal truename.

Bene  t: You gain a natural armor bonus equal to one-third

your truenamer level. The bonus lasts at least until the begin-

ning of your next turn, and you can extend it for 1 round

by taking the total defense action. You can continue taking

the total defense action, and gaining the bonus, for up to 1

minute, after which time the effects of the recitation fade

unless you repeat the recitation.

QUICKEN UTTERANCE

You can speak an utterance with just a moments thought.

Prerequisites:  Truespeak  12  ranks,  ability  to  speak

utterances.

Bene  t: Speaking a quickened utterance is a swift action.

You  can  perform  another  action,  even  speaking  another

utterance,  in  the  same  round  as  you  speak  a  quickened

utterance. A quickened utterance has a Truespeak DC 20

higher than normal.

RECITATIONS

Recitations are special feats that allow you to affect yourself

with  the  power  of  truenames.  You  must  know  your  own

personal truename to use these feats, and youre aware that

it  uniquely  identi es  and  de nes  you.  By  repeating  your

own truename with a particular in ection, you can rede ne

yourself in some way.

ances, must know your own personal truename.

Bene  t:  You  are  rendered  free  of  disease,  whether  the

sickness has an ordinary or a supernatural origin. Both active

and incubating diseases are affected.

UTTERANCES

An utterance is a combination of words in Truespeech that

describe a creature, place, or object to be affected and the

desired effect (such as control speed or wreathe in  re).

By putting these truenames together in exacting fashion, you

create a rudimentary sentence in the true language of the

universean utterance. As a truenamer, you do not know

the truename for every creature and object in the world, but

you can describe them in the language of Truespeech. To do

so is to speak an utterance. When you speak an utterance

properly, reality reshapes itself to conform to the power of

your words.

You learn utterances as you progress in level, starting with

the simplest creature-oriented utterances and progressing

to more powerful and more diverse utterances. Utterances

are divided into three lexicons, or groups of related words.

As a truenamer, you learn many words in the Truespeech

but only a few practiced phrases that you can turn into true

utterances that carry the full power of Truespeechand that

power can change reality itself. Utterances can be described

as follows.

SPEAKING AN UTTERANCE

To  speak  an  utterance,  you  must  speak  in  a  clear  voice  as

loud  as  a  spellcaster.  Each  utterance  is  a  spell-like  ability

that  requires  a  successful  Truespeak  check.  But  because

the  language  of  truenames  requires  such  precision  of

pronunciation  and  timing,  an  utterance  takes  a  standard

action to perform and provokes attacks of opportunity from

threatening enemies.

Utterances are spell-like abilities with verbal components

(unlike other spell-like abilities, which have no components)

that require a successful Truespeak check; the DC for the

check is equal to 15 + (2  target creatures CR). Your effective

caster level for your utterances is equal to your truenamer

level.

UTTER DEFENSIVELY

If youre worried about attacks of opportunity, you can utter

defensively by accepting a 5 penalty on your Truespeak

check for each foe who could hit you. In exchange, the utter-

ance no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.

SPELL RESISTANCE

Spell resistance applies to your utterances, so you must suc-

ceed on a caster level check to overcome the spell resistance

of creatures you speak utterances on. Because your utterances

are spell-like abilities, the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell

Penetration feats make those caster level checks easier, just

as they do for spellcasters. When you deliver an utterance, it

has an effective caster level equal to your truenamer level. In

addition, when speaking an utterance, you can voluntarily

232

increase the DC of a Truespeak check by 5 to automatically

overcome a targets spell resistance.

PERSONAL TRUENAME

Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher have per-

sonal truenames, which you can discover through research

(described in Truename Research, page 196). Personal true-

names  are  more  complex  than  more  general  truenames,

but knowing one gives you an advantage when facing that

creature. If you know a creatures personal truename, the save

DC of your utterances used against that creature increase by

2, and you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome

that creatures spell resistance with your utterances. Speak-

ing  a  personal  truename  is  more  dif cult,  however,  and

the DC of a Truespeak check that incorporates a personal

truename increases by 2.

All truenamers learn their own personal truenames as part

of their education. You have an instinctive understanding of

your own personal truename and a sense of how it should

be  pronounced.  But  its  not  automatic,  even  for  you.  You

gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Truespeak checks to affect

yourself with truename magic.

THE UNIVERSE KEEPS TRACK OF YOU

When  you  deliver  an  utterance,  youre  dealing  with  the

cosmos itself and reshaping reality. If a target changes its

creature  type  with  a  spell  such  as  polymorph,  its  personal

truename doesnt change, although the truename you would

use in a less speci c utterance might. Shapechange, wild shape,

disguise, resurrection, reincarnationnone of these change a

personal truename. Only the ritual of renaming (described

in the Truename Spells section of this chapter) can change

a personal truename.

TARGET

With  the  exception  of  utterances  that  use  the  Lexicon  of

the Perfected Map, all utterances target a single creature or

object. Because the language of truenames is both exacting

and speci c, the same truename doesnt necessarily apply

to all four orcs charging at you. You must be able to see your

target (or at least perceive it in some other way that gets you

as much information as sight). But your target doesnt need

to hear the truename. You arent speaking to the target, after

all.  Youre  using  truenames  to  speak  to  the  cosmos  about

the target.

THE UNIVERSE HEARS JUST FINE

Because no creature needs to hear you speak the truename,

a silence spell wont automatically stop your utterances. It is

more dif cult to speak a truename properly when you dont

have the feedback of hearing your own voice. You have a 20%

chance of a given utterance failing when you deliver it from

within the area of a silence spell, no matter how high your

Truespeak check result.

For  utterances  that  use  the  Lexicon  of  the  Perfected

Map, you must be able to see the center of the area youre

truenaming. You cant truename a dungeon chamber thats

on the other side of a closed door, but you can truename the

room once you open the door, even if you cant see the entire

room from the outside.

RANGE

Unless  otherwise  speci ed,  utterances  work  at  a  range  of

60 feet.

DURATION

Utterances have short durations. Your use of truenames reor-

ders the universe as you direct, to be sure, but the universe

quickly reestablishes some semblance of the status quo.

When you deliver an utterance, youre remaking reality

itself. Whether the default reality returns quickly or slowly,

it does so at its own pace. Once youve delivered an utterance,

it will run its full course; utterances arent dismissable.

EFFECTIVE SPELL LEVEL

The effective level of an utterance is equal to its utterance

level  for  the  purpose  of  Concentration  checks,  as  well  as

interactions with other spells and abilities, such as globe of

invulnerability. However, you can increase the effective spell

level of an utterance by increasing the DC of your Truespeak

check. For every spell level you increase the utterance by,

increase the DC of your Truespeak check by 4.

THE LAWS

All utterances obey a pair of important universal laws that

govern Truespeech. In fact, one of these lawsthe Law of

Resistanceis  so  pervasive  that  even  uses  of  Truespeech

not involved in speaking utterances must frequently obey

it. Many Truespeak-based abilities in this chapter, especially

some  prestige  class  abilities,  follow  the  strictures  of  this

law.

THE LAW OF RESISTANCE

The  rst time you speak a particular utterance, you calculate

the DC as described under Speaking a Truename on page

232. However, the universe tends to resist being manipulated

with Truespeak repeatedly in a short period of time, so each

time you successfully speak the same utterance in a day, the

DC of your Truespeak check for that utterance increases by

2. If you fail a Truespeak check, however, the DC does not

increase on your next attempt of that utterance.

THE LAW OF SEQUENCE

All utterances obey the Law of Sequence. If you speak an

utterance  with  an  ongoing  duration,  you  cant  speak  that

utterance  again  until  the  duration  of  that  utterance  ends.

Its okay to use a different utterance while the  rst is still

233

active, however. Its also okay to use a higher-level version of

an utterance while a lower-level version is active, or vice versa,

because these constitute different utterances. The reverse of

an utterance is treated as the same utterance for the purpose

of the Law of Sequence.

For  example,  you  could  speak  a  2nd-level  lesser  word  of

nurturing utterance on one ally, then target another ally with

a 1st-level minor word of nurturing utterance. But you could not

use the 2nd-level lesser word of nurturing utterance on an ally,

and while it was still in effect, target an ally with the same

utterance or an enemy with the reverse of that utterance.

COUNTERSPEAKING AND

DISPELLING

Utterance effects with ongoing durations can be dispelled

normally using dispel magic. They can also be countered by

counterspeaking,  which  works  similarly  to  countering  a

spell.

COUNTERSPEAKING

To counterspeak an utterance, you must select an opponent

as  the  target  of  the  counterspeaking  and  ready  an  action

to counterspeak. When your opponent begins to speak an

utterance, you can attempt a Truespeak check (DC equal to

the DC of the utterance being spoken) to identify it. If you

also  know  the  utterance,  you  can  then  attempt  a  second

Truespeak check in an effort to counter the utterance. If your

check result is higher than your opponents, you negate the

utterance with no other results.

DISPELLING

To  dispel  an  ongoing  utterance,  you  must  successfully

speak the same utterance on the same target as the original

utterance. If your Truespeak check result is higher than the

original truenamers check result, the utterance is dispelled

as if its duration had expired. In cases where the Truespeak

check for the original utterance is unknown, assume that its

11 + the truenamers Truespeak bonus.

LEXICONS

Utterances fall into three distinct categories, called lexicons.

Each lexicon consists of a collection of words that deals with

creatures, items, or places.

The Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, the cornerstone of a

truenamers power, allows him to alter creatures he encoun-

ters in substantial ways. The Lexicon of the Crafted Tool does

the same for items, and the Lexicon of the Perfected Map

allows a truenamer to impact places he encounters.

The  latter  two  lexicons  are  more  dif cult  to  learn,  so

a  truenamer  never  learns  as  many  utterances  from  those

lexicons as he does from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind.

Truenamers arent entirely sure why this is, but one theory

holds  that  Truespeech  takes  more  naturally  to  creatures

because they have more of an impact on the universe. Items

and places are more static, and therefore require more precise

language. More information on each lexicon can be found

later in this section.

The level entry for each utterance describes the level of the

utterance (not the level that the truenamer gains access to

the utterance). See Table 32: The Truenamer and Table 33:

Maximum Utterance Level Known for details on the levels at

which a truenamer gains access to higher-level utterances.

LEXICON OF THE

EVOLVING MIND

Utterances  from  the  Lexicon  of  the  Evolving  Mind  form

the bulk of a truenamers knowledge. These potent phrases

in the language of Truespeech enable you to persuade the

universe to change with respect to a single creature. Without

exception,  each  of  these  utterances  shares  the  following

characteristics.

These utterances can target only a single creature, unless

you are of high enough level to have the truenamers speak

unto the masses class feature.

Each utterance from this lexicon, and this lexicon alone,

can be spoken in reverse. When you learn a new utterance,

you effectively learn two unique, but related, ways to alter

the world. Each entry in this lexicon features read-aloud and

descriptive text for the normal version of the utterance and

its reverse. The duration and saving throw requirement for

the normal way to speak an utterance might differ from its

reverse, which will be called out in the utterances statistics

at the top of the entry.

ACCELERATED ATTACK

Level: 3

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: None

Normal:  Your  utterance  allows  your  target  to  move  quickly

through the crowded battle eld, striking and darting away before

attacks can be reciprocated. Images of the target in action persist

for a few seconds after the target has gone.

The target gains the use of the Spring Attack feat, even if he

does not meet the prerequisites. As the target moves, he leaves

a ghostly, translucent snapshot of himself in each square he

travels through; the images disappear after a second or so.

Reverse: A spellcaster you target gains the ability to cast a spell

quickly while moving.

The target can make a special Concentration check (DC 20 +

spell level) when casting a spell. If the check succeeds, he can

cast the spell and move up to his speed as a single standard

action. (The target cant use this ability to cast a spell that takes

longer than 1 standard action to cast.) If the check fails, the

target loses the spell, just as if he had failed a Concentration

235

check to cast the spell defensively. As with the standard ver-

sion of the utterance, the target leaves illusory afterimages

behind him that fade after a second or two.

The target still provokes attacks of opportunity for casting

spells from any creatures that threatened him at any point of

his movement. He can cast defensively while under the effect

of this utterance, but doing so increases the Concentration

DC to 25 + spell level.

The reversed utterance  lls your target with caustic, toxic air.

The target of this utterance must make a successful Fortitude

save or be nauseated (DMG 301).

BREATH OF RECOVERY

Level: 6

Duration: Instantaneous (normal) or 1 round (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Fortitude negates (reverse)

ARCHERS EYE

Level: 2

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: With a few words of Truespeech, you allow your target

to strike true with her ranged attacks.

Your targets ranged attacks ignore penalties for concealment

because her aim sharpens to focus on the unconcealed parts

of her foe.

Normal: You speak a word of purity in the language of Truespeech,

reminding the universe of an allys natural state. The ally breathes

a golden mist and is restored.

This utterance, more powerful than cleansing breath, imme-

diately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions

affecting  the  target:  ability  damage,  blinded,  confused,

dazed,  dazzled,  deafened,  diseased,  exhausted,  fatigued,

feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, and

poisoned. The target exhales a shimmering, golden puff of

breath as the adverse conditions disappear.

Reverse: Your utterance wards an ally from harm, preventing the

arrows of your enemies from  nding their mark.

Reverse: With this utterance, your words of power roll over your

targets body, which stiffens into rigidity.

This utterance duplicates the effect of a protection from arrows

spell  (PH  266)  for  the  target;  projectiles  fall  out  of  the  air

suddenly rather than striking her..

A reversed breath of recovery utterance freezes the life energy

of the target, rendering action impossible. The target must

make a successful Fortitude save or be paralyzed (DMG 301),

emitting wisps of black smoke until the effect ends.

BREATH OF CLEANSING

Level: 4

Duration: 1 round

Saving  Throw:  None  (normal)  or  Fortitude  negates

(reverse)

CASTER LENS

Level: 4

Duration: 3 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: With a word, magical breath passes from your mouth

to another creature af icted with harmful magic, granting him

another chance to resist.

Your utterance  lls your target with a breath of living magic,

granting him the ability to make a second attempt to save

against an ongoing spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural

ability. This save is made at the same DC. If the subject suc-

ceeds on the saving throw on the second attempt, the effect

ends immediately. Breath of cleansing never restores hit points

or ability score damage, but it does eliminate any conditions,

such as shaken, fatigued, or nauseated, that were caused by

the spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability. The breath

of cleansing is magical and thus affects even creatures that

dont ordinarily breathe.

Reverse: This gurgling word sounds like burbling sewage, evoking

feelings of illness in your target.

Normal: Your utterance creates an intangible lens that improves

your targets potency and aptitude with magic.

Your targets caster level or manifester level increases by 2

for the duration of this utterance due to a nearly transparent,

intangible vertical disk that appears in front of her. Each spell

she casts becomes stronger as it passes through the lens. This

utterance does not affect spells per day or spells known. If

the target has multiple spellcasting or manifesting classes,

the bonus applies to all of them.

Reverse: The reverse of this utterance impedes the  ow of magical

energy through your enemy, inhibiting its ability to cast spells.

Your targets caster level or manifester level decreases by 2

for the duration of this utterance due to an intangible, nearly

transparent prism that  oats in front of it and dissipates some

of its spell energy. This utterance does not affect spells per

day or spells known. If the target has multiple spellcasting or

CONFOUNDING RESISTANCE

DEFENSIVE EDGE

Level: 4

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Level: 1

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Your target becomes more mobile, able to entirely avoid

effects that might otherwise have some dire consequence.

Normal: You grant a greater awareness of foes in the area, increas-

ing an allys ability to protect herself.

You grant your target the ability to avoid harmful effects.

If the target makes a successful save against an attack that

normally would have a lesser effect on a successful save (such

as a Re ex save against a breath weapon for half damage or

a spell with a saving throw entry of Will half or Fortitude

partial),  he  instead  negates  the  effect.  An  unconscious  or

sleeping target does not gain the bene t of this ability.

Your target periodically receives glimpses of future blows

struck by enemies, giving her the chance to get out of the

way or interpose a shield. This utterance grants your target

a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

Reverse: Your dire whispers seep into your foes mind, disrupting

its ability to defend itself.

Reverse: Your utterance strips your target of its ability to evade

harm.

You make your target more vulnerable to harmful effects. If

your target has improved evasion, you reduce its effectiveness

to evasion. If your target does not have improved evasion, but

has evasion, you suppress the ability. If your target has neither

improved evasion nor evasion, it takes a 2 penalty on saving

throws for the duration of the utterance.

The reversed form of the utterance also provides premoni-

tions of future attacks and the paths of future blowsbut

those premonitions are misleading or false. Your target takes

a 1 penalty to Armor Class.

Normal:  The  universe  responds  to  your  words  by  forcing  your

target closer to you, pulled inexorably by a sapphire cord.

You move your target toward you up to 40 feet along an intan-

gible blue tether that connects the two of you. You cant move

the target into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy,

or a solid object. You can draw a  ying creature closer to you,

but you cannot make a creature on the ground  y.

The  Truespeak  DC  of  this  utterance  increases  by  2  for

every size category the target is larger than Medium.

This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

Reverse: Your target is repelled, forced away by your command

of Truespeech.

You move your target away from you up to 40 feet with an

almost   uid  torrent  of  intangible  energy.  You  cant  move

the target into a space that is occupied by an ally, an enemy,

or a solid object. You can push an airborne  ying creature

away  from  you,  but  you  cannot  make  a  creature  on  the

ground  y.

The  DC  of  this  utterance  increases  by  2  for  every  size

category the target is larger than Medium.

This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

ENERGY NEGATION

Level: 3

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: The air crackles with your words as you protect

your target from energy.

A nimbus of silvery power surrounds your target, absorbing

a speci c energy type and hampering it from reaching the

target. This utterance grants your target resistance 10 to one

type of energy (acid, cold, electricity,  re, or sonic).

Reverse: The  esh and skin of an enemy are imbued with energy,

causing it great pain and discomfort.

When you speak the reverse of this utterance, you imbue

your targets skin with energy: acid, cold, electricity, or  re.

The subject appears to be surrounded with a nimbus of the

selected energy type, and takes 2d6 points of damage from

the utterance each round.

ENERGY NEGATION, GREATER

Level: 5

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Your utterance renders your target impervious to harm

from one type of energy.

A nimbus of golden power surrounds your target, granting

him immunity to one type of energy.

Reverse: You wreathe your ally in energy that lashes out at those

who strike him in battle.

By reversing an eldritch attraction utterance, Khetarin gives a hill giant a terrible surprise

This  utterance  wreathes  your  target  in  a  type  of  energy

chosen  by  you  when  you  speak  this  utterance  (acid,  cold,

electricity, or  re). This energy causes damage to each crea-

ture that makes a successful melee attack against the subject

of the utterance.

Any creature that damages the subject with its body or a

handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time,

the  attacker  takes  20  points  of  energy  damage.  Creatures

wielding weapons with exceptional reach, such as longspears,

are not subject to this damage if they attack the subject.

ESSENCE OF LIFESPARK

Level: 5

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Normal: With soothing words, you revitalize an ally and restore

some of his lost vitality. The negative level that af icted him spirals

upward, fading as it rises.

This utterance dispels one negative level and restores one

experience level to a creature who has had a level drained.

As you dispel the negative level, a shadowy form detaches

from your target and drifts upward before dissipating into

nothingness. The drained level is restored only if the time

since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one

day per truenamer level.

Reverse: You instruct the universe to sap some of the life force of

a target creature.

You utter a dark word of power that suppresses the life force

of a creature. A shadowy version of your target appears a few

feet away, then rushes inward, incorporating itself into your

targets body. The target gains one negative level, giving it a

1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, abil-

ity checks, and effective level (for determining the power,

duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).

Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from

her highest available level. Negative levels stack.

ETHER REFORGED

Level: 6

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: No

Normal:  With  this  utterance,  creatures  of  the  ethereal  world

become as solid as the earth to one of your allies.

You enable your target to gain full bene t from its armor,

weapons,  spells,  and  abilities  against  both  corporeal  and

incorporeal  creatures.  Your  target  looks  no  different  to

corporeal observers on the Material Plane, but incorporeal

observers and creatures on the Ethereal Plane see her glow

slightly and in sharp relief uncommon to creatures and items

on the Ethereal Plane.

Reverse: One of your allies slips into the space between worlds

and leaps onto the Ethereal Plane.

This reversed utterance renders the target ethereal, as the

ethereal jaunt spell (PH 227).

HIDDEN TRUTH

Level: 2

Du ration: Instantaneous (normal) or 1 round (reverse)

Saving Throw: None

Normal:  Your  words  allow  your  target  to  tap  into  a  reserve  of

knowledge.

You grant the target a +10 bonus on a single Knowledge check

and enable her to use the skill, even if untrained. If the target

has  bardic  knowledge,  lore,  or  a  similar  class  feature,  this

bonus can apply to that check instead.

Reverse:  Your  targets  words  ring  true  thanks  to  this  utter-

anceeven if they actually are not.

Your target gains a +10 bonus on a single Bluff check made

before the duration of the utterance expires.

INCARNATION OF ANGELS

Level: 3

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Your words reach the realms of heaven and invest your

target with some of their silver grace and golden might.

The target gains the celestial creature template (MM 31). Her

skin takes on a silvery sheen and a golden aura surrounds

her. The smite ability granted by the template is usable by

the target only once per day, no matter how many times she

might be the subject of this utterance.

Reverse: With the reverse of this utterance, you instead delve into

the depths of hell to grant your target the cunning and strength of

 ends.

The target gains the  endish creature template (MM 107),

complete with reddish skin and small horns on her forehead.

The smite ability granted by the template is usable by the

target  only  once  per  day,  no  matter  how  many  times  she

might be the subject of this utterance.

239

Normal: The blows of your target fall more surely and strike more

soundly after you speak this utterance.

Your target receives forceful guidance on each attack, gaining

a +5 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

Reverse: By reversing the words of this utterance, you signi cantly

reduce your targets effectiveness in battle.

Your target takes a 5 bonus on attack

rolls  and  damage  rolls,  as  its  attacks

are  nudged  forcefully  away  from  their

intended target.

MAGIC CONTRACTION

Level: 4

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: With this utterance of protection, you make

your target resilient against magical effects.

The target gains spell resistance equal to 11 + your

truenamer  level.  As  a  spell  fails  to  overcome  the

targets spell resistance, its visible effect shrinks into

nothingness over the course of a few seconds.

Reverse: A string of complex syllables allows you to

enhance the power of an allys spells for a short time.

INERTIA SURGE

Level: 1

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Your words free your target from many impediments,

allowing her to slip from any constraints.

You grant the target to act normally

regardless  of  magical  effects  that

impede  movement  as  if  he

were affected by a freedom

of movement spell (PH 233).

This effect occurs automati-

cally as soon as the utterance

is spoken and lasts for 1 round.

Impediments  magically  part  or

otherwise move to let your target

pass, then return to normal in his

wake.

Reverse:  Your  words  cause  black

tentacles to grow from the ground and

clutch at the feet of your enemy, pre-

venting it from moving anywhere.

A black tangle of wriggling force-

tendrils  roots  your  target  in  place,

rendering it unable to move. It can

take  actions  normally;  it  just  cant

move  from  the  space  it  currently

occupies.

KNIGHTS

PUISSANCE

Level: 1

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

You  grant  your  target  the  ability  to  apply  the

effect of the Empower Spell feat (PH 93) to any

spell she casts for the duration of the utterance

without  increasing  the  level  of  the  spell  or

specially preparing it ahead of time.

Inertia surge can free you from

magical impediments

MORALE BOOST

Level: 4

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: Your utterance calms the heart of your target,  lling her

with resolution and peace.

You call upon the courage of your target, striking away her

feelings of terror. This utterance functions as the remove fear

spell (PH 271). Your target can hear the calming murmur of

your Truespeech throughout the utterances duration.

Reverse: Your words evoke feelings of terror, dread, and awe in

your target.

Your target becomes frightened (DMG 301) by the susurrant

Truespeech being whispered in its ear. The frightening whis-

pers persist throughout the reversed utterances duration.

Normal: Your words show your ally a way to strike more accu-

rately.

Your target gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls as unseen forces

guide his weapon to its target.

Reverse: By speaking the reverse of this utterance, you impede an

enemys ability to strike.

Unseen  forces  nudge  your  targets  blows  off  course.  Your

target takes a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

MYSTIC RAMPART

Level: 6

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: With a complex string of syllables, an intangible tower

superimposes itself over your ally, greatly enhancing his ability to

protect himself.

You grant your target damage reduction 5/ and a +5 bonus

on saving throws as your utterance superimposes a ghostly

tower or castle over his form. The tower is just barely visible

and doesnt obscure or conceal anything behind it.

Reverse: You speak and your target becomes vulnerable.

The  reversed  utterance  superimposes  a  crumbling,  ruined

tower over your target, which takes a 5 penalty to Armor Class

and on saving throws for the utterance of the duration.

PERCEIVE THE UNSEEN

Level: 2

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal:  Your  ally  gains  a  sixth  sense  about  where  nearby

enemies are.

When you speak this utterance, the target gains a greater

sense  of  where  his  enemies  are,  granting  him  the  use

of  the  Blind-Fight  feat  (PH  89).  The  targets  perceptions

automatically focus on the general area of unseen enemies;

this doesnt guarantee that the target  nds them, but makes

it much more likely.

Reverse: The reverse of this utterance confounds your foes, prevent-

ing them from precisely locating an allys position.

With the reverse of perceive the unseen, you make the target of

the utterance more dif cult to track in battle. Your targets

enemies  nd themselves instinctively glancing away from

him, even when they know they need to be focusing their

attention there. This effectively gives the target concealment

(PH 152).

PRETERNATURAL CLARITY

Level: 5

Duration:  5  rounds  or  until  discharged  (normal),  or  5

rounds (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: You speak and sharpen your allys mind with an aware-

ness of all that is and all that might be.

Once  during  the  duration  of  this  utterance,  your  target

can choose to use its effect. This word grants the subject a

+5 insight bonus on any single attack roll, opposed ability

or skill check, or saving throw. When your target uses the

insight bonus, those within 10 feet of her can hear an echo

of your original utterance, even if youre no longer present.

Activating the effect is an immediate action. The target can

choose to apply the bonus after she has rerolled the d20, but

before the Dungeon Master reveals the result of the check.

Reverse: At your command, the universe temporarily becomes

incomprehensible to your target.

Your reversed utterance echoes in the ears of your target and

can be heard as a faint murmur by anyone within 10 feet. This

reversed utterance causes the target to become confused, as

the confusion spell (PH 212).

SEEK THE SKY

Level: 3

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Gravity no longer applies to your ally, as she gains the

ability to  y before a ribbon of red energy.

The target of the  ight utterance can  y, as the  y spell (PH

232). Your target leaves a trail of crackling red bolts in her

wake.

Reverse: At your command, your target loses its ability to soar

through the air and begins to descend toward the earth rapidly.

With this word, you render a  ying creature unable to  y, no

matter how much it  aps its wings or strains upward. If it is

already  ying, the subject  oats downward 60 feet per round

for the duration of the utterance. If it reaches the ground in

that amount of time, it lands safely, and cannot  y for the

duration of the utterance. If the target is not  ying, it cannot

attempt to  y for the duration of the utterance.

SEEK THE SKY, GREATER

Level: 5

Duration: 5 rounds (normal) or instantaneous (reverse)

Saving Throw: None

Normal: You surround an ally in red motive energy, granting

him the ability to  y like the wind.

The target can  y, as the  y spell (PH 232) except he gains a

 y speed of 120 feet with perfect maneuverability. Crackling

red  energy  surrounds  your  target,  and  powerful  swirls  of

wind follow in his wake.

Reverse: At your words, the very air rejects your target, causing

it to plummet to the ground.

With this word, you render a  ying creature unable to  y. The

subject immediate plummets downward, taking 1d6 points

of falling damage for every 10 feet it drops. It can make Jump

and Tumble checks normally to attempt to land softly.

SENSORY FOCUS

Level: 5

Duration: 1 round (normal) or 3 rounds (reverse)

Saving  Throw:  None  (normal)  or  Fortitude  negates

(reverse)

Normal:  Your  target  can  pierce  the  veil  of  deception  and  see

everything as it truly is.

You  grant  your  target  sharper  senses,  the  combination  of

which are equivalent to blindsight (MM 306) and the effect

of the true seeing spell (PH 296).

Reverse:  Your  words  strip  away  your  targets  ability  to  see  or

hear.

With this reversed utterance, you send your target a riot of

swirling  sound  and   ashing  color,  rendering  it  unable  to

perceive the outside world. Your target is both blinded and

deafened (DMG 300).

SILENT CASTER

Level: 2

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: Your ally can cast spells without making a sound, the

verbal component instead appearing as sigils of power.

You grant your target the ability to apply the effect of the

Silent  Spell  feat  (PH  100)  to  any  spell  she  casts  without

increasing the level of the spell or specially preparing it ahead

of time. Glowing runes appear above your targets head that

take the place of the verbal component of the spell.

Reverse: An enemy creature is unable to speak or make a peep,

its vocal cords completely stilled.

You silence your target, making it incapable of producing

sound, conversing, or using spells with verbal components.

It automatically succeeds on Move Silently checks.

SINGULAR MIND

Level: 6

Duration: Instantaneous (normal) or concentration, up to

5 rounds (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

242

Normal: With a word, you liberate your target from all foreign

in uence, freeing her mind. Any enchantments or curses are con-

verted to runic truespeech and fade harmlessly away.

or  wall  to   oor  costs  no  movement;  the  target  can  change

surfaces freely. Opponents on the ground can make attacks

of opportunity as the target moves up the wall.

Reverse: The target of this utterance cannot move as quickly as it

had just a moment before.

Your targets base speed is reduced by 10 feet, as its feet seem

to stick to the ground.

SPEED OF THE ZEPHYR, GREATER

Level: 3

Duration: 3 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: Your allys movements are quicker, enhancing his offen-

sive and defensive capabilities.

This utterance duplicates the effect of a haste spell (PH 239)

for one target, who is limned with an amber light.

Reverse: When you speak this utterance, your target moves as

though through molasses.

This utterance duplicates the effect of a slow spell (PH 280)

for one target.

This  utterance  restores  your  target  to  her  natural  state  as

glowing runic letters brie y appear above her head. It frees

the subject from enchantments, curses, and possession.

If the spell or effect is one that cannot be dispelled by dispel

magic, singular mind works only if the truespeakers level is

greater than that of the original caster.

Reverse: Your words crawl into the mind of your enemy, allowing

you control of your foes body as if it were your puppet.

This  utterance  duplicates  the  effect  of  a  dominate  monster

spell  (PH  224),  except  that  to  maintain  domination,  you

must spend a standard action to concentrate and direct the

creatures actions. Runic letters appear above your targets

head, but only you can see them. They change shape with

each new command you issue.

SPEED OF THE ZEPHYR

Level: 2

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: You urge your ally

on to greater speed with this

utterance,  enabling  him  to

sprint across treacherous surfaces

or even scale sheer walls.

Your  targets  base  speed  increases

by 20 feet as his feet glow with an

amber  light.  In  addition,  he  can

adjust his bodys equilibrium so that

he  can  walk  on  water,  quicksand,

snow, or even a spiders web with-

out  sinking  or  breaking  through

(this  effect  does  not  confer  any

resistance  to  particularly  sticky

webs).  In  addition,  the  target  can

take part of one of its move actions

to traverse a wall or other relatively

smooth vertical surface if it begins

and ends its move on a horizontal

surface.  The  height  it  can  achieve

on the wall is limited only by this

movement restriction. If it does not

end its move on a horizontal surface,

it falls prone, taking falling damage

as appropriate for its distance above

the ground. Treat the wall as a normal

 oor  for  the  purpose  of  measuring

movement. Passing from  oor to wall

With speed of the zephyr, even normally impassable terrain poses no dif culties

SPELL REBIRTH

Level: 4

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Normal: You brie y unwind time to restore lost magic when you

speak this utterance.

With this utterance, you restore an effect that has just been

dispelled or dismissed within the last round. Provided that

it had duration remaining, it resumes immediately with all

its former attributes.

Reverse:  Your  words  strip  away  a  magical  effect  from  your

target.

This utterance dispels the spell with the highest caster level

affecting the target.

STRIKE OF MIGHT

Level: 2

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: None

Normal: You tap into an allys damage potential, augmenting her

combat abilities substantially.

Your targets single next weapon damage roll (if it is made

before  the  end  of  the  next  round)  deals  an  additional  10

points  of  damage  as  it  explodes  with  a  spout  of  magical

energy. This damage is not multiplied on critical hits.

Reverse: You brie y enfeeble an enemy, causing its swings to slow

and deal less damage.

Your targets single next weapon damage roll (if it is made

before  the  end  of  the  next  round)  deals  5  fewer  points  of

damage as the blow is cushioned by an unseen force. This

penalty can reduce the damage to 0, but not below.

TEMPORAL SPIRAL

Level: 3

Duration: 1 round (normal) or 3 rounds (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: When you speak this utterance, everything your target

does seems quicker. Silvery energy surrounds the fast-moving target

in a crackling aura.

The temporal spiral utterance manifests as silvery spirals and

energy  motes  that  surround  your  target  like  a  nimbus  of

energy, separating it momentarily from the normal  ow of

time. When you speak this complex word of action, you grant

the target of this utterance an additional move action in the

current round. For instance, on your turn you could speak

this utterance to allow the subject to move into position that

would set up a charge, then take its normal action to charge

an opponent. Alternatively, you could speak this utterance to

allow the subject to move within melee range of a foe, then

take a full-round action to make attacks on that foe. A subject

that takes a full attack action and then uses this utterance to

move away from a foe provokes attacks of opportunity.

If the subject of the utterance does not take this extra move

action before the end of your next turn, it is lost.

Reverse:  This  powerful  utterance  sounds  like  the  churning  of

ancient earth, freezing your target in place.

When reversed, the silver spirals of unraveled time inhibit

your target. For the duration of this utterance, the target is

dazed.

TEMPORAL TWIST

Level: 2

Duration: Instantaneous (normal) or 1 round (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: With a word of Truespeech, you grant a creature incred-

ible re exes, enabling it to immediately make an attack as tendrils

of energy twist in its wake.

By delivering this utterance, you reweave the tapestry of time

itself to grant your target a precious few seconds of activity.

Translucent  curls  of  energy  trail  behind  your  target  for  a

few moments, a side effect of your utterances power. Your

target can immediately make one melee or ranged attack,

even if it has already taken its action for the round. Taking

this action doesnt affect the subjects normal place in the

initiative order.

This utterance does not allow the subject to make more

than one additional attack in a round. If the target has already

made an additional attack, due to the haste spell, snakes swift-

ness spell, or from any other source, this utterance has no

effect.

Reverse: By reversing this utterance, you cause a creature to lose

its focus and become bewildered.

The reversed utterance pulls time-threads out of reality, and

translucent curls of energy brie y surround and slow your

target. The target of this utterance is dazed (DMG 300) for

1 round.

UNIVERSAL APTITUDE

Level: 1

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

Normal: You speak a word of pro ciency and ability, increasing

the natural aptitude of your ally.

244

Your target is better able to block out distractions and per-

ceive the subtleties of any taskalmost as if the universe

wants your target to succeed at upcoming challenges. He is

aware of subtle clues in the environment as the world reworks

itself in small ways to make success more likely. The targets

lockpicks might become slightly more supple, or the ground

beneath her feet might be slightly better for tumbling. The

target might notice subtle body language that makes a Sense

Motive check easier, or she might  nd her steed unusually

amenable to dif cult equestrian jumps. For the duration of

the utterance, the target gains a +5 bonus on skill checks.

Normal: Your ally can see the unseen in the warp and weft of

air nearby.

The target of this utterance gains the effect of a see invisibility

spell  (PH  275).  Your  target  cannot  discern  details  of  the

creatures he sees, but the air around the invisible creatures

seems to warp, allowing your target to pinpoint the creatures

location and strike at them accurately.

Reverse: With the reverse of this utterance, your target disappears

from view.

Reverse: With the reversal of this utterance, you instruct the uni-

verse to hinder your foes ability to perform even everyday tasks.

The  reversed  utterance  causes  the  universe  to  conspire  in

small  ways  against  your  target.  The  lockpicks  become  too

stiff to reach the inner workings of the lock, and small debris

makes tumbling treacherous. Your target misses the subtleties

of tone and body language in a conversation, and her horse is

reluctant to attempt stunts. For 5 rounds, your target takes a

5 penalty on skill checks.

VISION SHARPENED

Level: 3

Duration: 5 rounds

Saving Throw: None

This  utterance  duplicates  the  effect  of  an  invisibility  spell

(PH 245) for one target, who fades into nothingness after a

second or two.

WARD OF PEACE

Level: 5

Duration:  5  rounds  (normal)  or  concentration  up  to  5

rounds (reverse)

Saving Throw: None (normal) or Will negates (reverse)

Normal: You ward your target from harm with a golden halo,

preventing enemies from attacking her.

Opponents  cannot  strike  or  otherwise  directly  attack  the

warded creature, even with a targeted spell. Because of the

distinctive golden halo around the target, enemies are aware

of the prohibition and do not lose actions for attempting

to strike. This utterance does not prevent the warded creature

from being attacked or affected by area or effect spells. The

subject cannot attack without breaking the protection but can

use other spells and abilities that are not hostile toward another

creature.  This  allows  a  warded  cleric  to  heal  wounds,  for

example, or to cast a bless spell, summon creatures, and so on.

Reverse: With a harsh sequence of words, you force a creature

from another plane back to its home.

Reverse:  With  this  word,  you  cause  your  enemy  to  experience

painfully bleeding wounds that spontaneously emerge.

You unmake a portion of the subjects being as you utter the

reverse form of the life-giving words. You deal 1d6 points

of damage to the subject as wounds appear across its body.

If you concentrate for 1 round (a standard action), and the

subject remains within range, it takes another 1d6 points of

damage at the end of your next turn.

You banish the target into an extradimensional pocketa

featureless gray void with no visible entrance or exit. Spells

and  abilities  that  move  a  creature  within  a  plane,  such  as

teleport  and  dimension  door,  do  not  help  a  creature  escape

from this place, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to

whatever plane is designated in that spell. At the end of the

duration, if the subject has not left the pocket dimension, it

reappears where it had been when the utterance was spoken.

If this location is  lled with a solid object, the subject appears

in the nearest open space.

LEXICON OF THE

CRAFTED TOOL

Beginning at 4th level, you learn your  rst utterance within

the Lexicon of the Crafted Tool. Unlike utterances from the

Lexicon of the Evolving Mind, the utterances in this lexicon

have no meaning or power when reversed. All the utterances

in this lexicon target objectsoften the weapons and armor

that you, your allies, or your enemies use. Spell resistance

applies to these utterances, as it does normally to spell-like

abilities. Also as normal, attended objects gain the bene t of

their wielders spell resistance, if any.

You  gain  access  to  higher-level  utterances  from  this

lexicon at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels. If you target an

item wielded or carried by a creature with spell resistance,

the item gains the bene t of that ability. However, any item

targeted by one of these utteranceswielded or notdoes

not get to save to avoid the effects.

1ST-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Fortify  Armor:  Make  a  creatures  armor  able  to  negate

critical hits and sneak attacks.

Keen Weapon: Improve the threat range of a weapon.

2ND-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Agitate Metal: Cause a creatures metal equipment to radi-

ate painful heat or cold.

Analyze Item: Discern the properties of a magic item.

3RD-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Rebuild Item: Restore an item destroyed within the last

round  to  perfect  form  and  functionality,  including  any

magic properties it had.

Suppress  Weapon:  Suppress  the  energy  property  of  a

weapon.

Normal: With this powerful utterance, you remind the universe

of your allys true physical form, and even his most terrible wounds

begin to knit together.

4TH-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Suppress Item: Suppress the properties of a magic item.

Transmute Weapon: Change a weapons special material.

247

Analyze item reveals valuable information about valuable objects

5TH-LEVEL UTTERANCES

ANALYZE ITEM

Metamagic Catalyst: Give a potion or scroll the bene t

of a metamagic feat.

Seize Item: Bring an object within range instantly to your

hand.

Level: 2

Range: Touch

Target: One object

Duration: 1 round

AGITATE METAL

Level: 2

Range: 30 ft.

Target: Metal equipment of one creature; or one metal object

weighing no more than 25 lb./level

Duration: 7 rounds

You increase or decrease the temperature of a metal object signi -

cantly, possibly harming creatures in physical contact with it as it

glows with red heat (or blue chill).

The target metal item rapidly becomes dangerously hot or

cold, glowing red if hot and blue if cold. This utterance func-

tions as a chill metal (PH 209) or heat metal (PH 239) spell with

a caster level equal to your truenamer level, except as noted

here. You choose which effectcold or hotyou want to

generate when you speak the utterance.

By  studying  an  item,  you  can  determine  a  great  deal  about  it,

including its magical properties, if any.

By  delivering  an  utterance  of  perception  and  analysis

incorporating the truename of the object, you determine all

spells and magical properties affecting a speci c item youre

touching. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions,

how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many

charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object

with active spells cast upon it, you learn one spell with each

use of this utterance, highest level to lowest, including its

effect and caster level.

You  cannot  determine  the  function  of  an  artifact  with

this utterance (see page 277 of the Dungeon Masters Guide

for details on artifacts).

FORTIFY ARMOR

Level: 1

Range: 30 ft.

Target: One suit of armor

Duration: 5 rounds

A  suit  of  armor  covers  its  wearers  vital  areas  more  effectively,

providing better protection against attacks.

You make a suit of armor better able to protect the creature

wearing it. When you speak this utterance, the target armor

gives  its  wearer  protection  against  critical  hits  and  sneak

attacks. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the

wearer, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak

attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

You can increase the level of protection provided by the

utterance by voluntarily increasing the DC of your Truespeak

check. If you add 10 to the DC, critical hits and sneak attacks

have a 50% of being negated, and if you add 20 to the DC,

critical hits and sneak attacks are automatically negated.

KEEN WEAPON

Level: 1

Range: 30 ft.

Target: One weapon

Duration: 5 rounds

Your words make a weapon shine with silver potency, capable of

dealing more punishing blows than normal.

You can augment the critical threat range of a weapon by

speaking  its  truename.  This  utterance  functions  as  a  keen

edge spell (PH 246) with a caster level equal to your truenamer

level, except as noted here. In addition, you can change the

threat range of any weapon you name, not just piercing and

slashing  weapons.  The  weapon  you  deliver  this  utterance

upon pulses with a silvery sheen throughout the utterances

duration.

METAMAGIC CATALYST

Level: 5

Range: Touch

Target: Potion or scroll touched

Duration: 1 round

Your touch enables a potion consumed or scroll read during the next

round to be augmented with metamagic.

With  this  utterance,  you  can  apply  one  of  the  following

metamagic effects to the target potion or scroll: Empower

Spell,  Heighten  Spell  (maximum  +2  caster  level),  Extend

Spell, or Enlarge Spell. The utterance has no impact on the

amount of time it takes to activate the item, but if the item

is  not  used  within  the  following  round,  the  effect  of  the

utterance fades. Whoever consumes the potion or reads the

scroll hears a snatch of your truespeech when the metamagic

takes effect.

You can also modify a potion or scroll as with the Widen

Spell or Maximize Spell feats, but doing so increases the DC

of your Truespeak check by 10.

REBUILD ITEM

Level: 3

Range: Touch

Target: Destroyed item touched

Duration: Instantaneous

You reconstitute a destroyed item, instantly putting it back together

into one functional piece.

With this utterance, you instantly restore an item destroyed

within the last round to its normal, undamaged state. Essen-

tially, by reminding the item of its truename, you unmake

its destruction. Magic items affected by this power retain all

their magical properties, unlike items restored with a make

whole spell. The reconstituted item has full hit points.

This  utterance  has  no  effect  on  any  item  that  has  been

destroyed  for  more  than  1  round.  You  cannot  restore  a

destroyed artifact with this utterance.

SEIZE ITEM

Level: 5

Range: 30 ft.

Target: One object weighing no more than 50 lbs.

Duration: Instantaneous

You speak a word to make an object your own, forcing it out of the

hands of its owner, if necessary.

This utterance brings an object within range to your hand.

If the object is unattended, it simply darts through the air

to  your  hand.  If  attended,  such  as  a  wielded  weapon,  you

must make a disarm attempt. You use your truenamer level

as  your  base  attack  bonus  and  your  Intelligence  bonus  in

place of your Strength modi er, and a failed attempt does

not allow a reactive attempt by the target. Spell resistance

applies normally for an attended object.

If both your hands are full when you speak this utterance,

the item lands in your square at your feet.

SUPPRESS ITEM

Level: 4

Range: 60 ft.

Target: One magic item

Duration: 1 round, or concentration, up to 5 rounds

Your uninterrupted focus on a magic item keeps it from functioning,

turning it gray and rendering it useless.

249

By speaking this utterance and focusing on a single item, you

prevent any magical properties or effects of the item from

functioning as long as you concentrate and remain within

range. The item turns gray and ceases to glow or otherwise

indicate its magical nature. If the item moves out of range,

the utterances effect ends 1 round later. This effect other-

wise functions as a dispel magic spell (PH 223) that targets a

magic item.

SUPPRESS WEAPON

Level: 3

Range: 30 ft.

Target: One weapon with an energy special ability

Duration: 5 rounds

LEXICON OF THE

PERFECTED MAP

Beginning at 8th level, you learn your  rst utterance within

the Lexicon of the Perfected Map. These utterances, which

all  target  nearby  areas,  have  no  meaning  or  power  when

reversed. They allow you to reshape the landscape that sur-

rounds you, making it deadly to your enemies or otherwise

advantageous to you.

Unless  stated  otherwise,  all  the  utterances  from  this

lexicon affect a 20-foot-radius spread area and have a range

of 100 feet.

You gain access to higher-level utterances from this lexicon

at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.

You can suppress the energy properties of a single weapon.

1ST-LEVEL UTTERANCES

When you speak this utterance, you can prevent a weapons

energy-based special ability (or abilities) from functioning.

Such abilities include  aming and frost, among others. The

weapon turns gray and ceases to emit the relevant energy

type. If you successfully speak this utterance on a weapon

that does not have such a property, it has no effect on the

weapon but you are still considered to have spoken the utter-

ance once. If your Truespeak check is successful, the weapon

simply ceases to deal the extra energy damage provided by

its ability for the duration of the utterance.

You can suppress an energy burst weapon ability by vol-

untarily increasing the DC of your Truespeak check by 5. If

you use this ability on an energy burst weapon at the normal

DC, it has no effect.

TRANSMUTE WEAPON

Level: 4

Range: 30 ft.

Target: One weapon

Duration: 5 rounds

Your words fundamentally alter the material of which a weapon

is made, transforming it according to your whim.

A weapon targeted with this utterance can be changed into

a special material (DMG 283) of your choice. You can make a

weapon cold iron, adamantine, alchemical silver, or whatever

other  special  material  you  wish.  The  weapon  is  treated  as

if made of that substance, and its hardness, hit points, and

the damage it deals might be affected depending on your

choice.

Fog from the Void: Create a cloud of fog that obscures sight

and might make movement dif cult.

Shield of the Landscape: Alter the land to temporarily

negate or provide cover.

Shockwave:  A  violent  pulse  of  energy  knocks  creatures

from their feet.

2ND-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Energy  Vortex:  Fill  the  area  with  energy  that  damages

your foes.

Speak Rock to Mud: Turn solid ruck into cloying mud.

Transform the Landscape: Add or remove dif cult ter-

rain in the area.

3RD-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Lore of the World: The world gives you information you

request.

Master  of  the  Four  Winds:  Bend  the  winds  to  your

will.

Thwart the Traveler: Prevent extradimensional travel in

the area.

4TH-LEVEL UTTERANCES

Anger the Sleeping Earth: Shake the earth, as the earth-

quake spell.

Conjunctive Gate: Create a portal between two planes.

Deny Passage: Prevent creatures from entering or leaving

an area.

ANGER THE SLEEPING EARTH

Level: 4

Duration: 1 round

Your  words  shake  the  foundation  of  the  earth,  causing  massive

devastation and widespread mayhem.

250

By speaking this utterance, you cause the earth to tremble

and quake violently. This utterance functions as an earthquake

spell (PH 225) with a caster level equal to your truenamer

level, except as noted here.

CONJUNCTIVE GATE

Level: 4

Duration: 1 minute

You forge a connection between this plane and another, temporar-

ily linking them together with a swirling portal you speak into

being.

allow a creature inside the area (an immediate action on your

part), it is held at bay just outside the place as if affected by

a protection from evil spell (although for this utterance, the

alignment of the creature doesnt matter). Reddish prison

bars appear brie y to block the creatures path, then disap-

pear when the creature stops trying to enter the utterances

area. The bars are intangible to everyone else, and the affected

creature cant interact with them in any way.

You  likewise  prevent  creatures  from  leaving  the  true-

named  place.  Unless  you  allow  a  creature  to  leave  (as  an

immediate action), it is held at bay at the boundary of the

area, stymied by the reddish prison bars.

By speaking this utterance, you create a portal between two

planesoval-shaped vertical doors full of swirling colors.

This utterance functions as a gate spell (PH 234) with a caster

level equal to your truenamer level, except as noted here.

ENERGY VORTEX

Level: 2

Duration: 1 minute

DENY PASSAGE

Level: 4

Duration: 1 minute

You force an area to deny access to a group of creatures speci ed by

your utterance. Crimson bars ward the area you name.

If your Truespeak check is successful, you can forbid crea-

tures from entering the area of the utterance. Unless you

Your words transform the nature of the air, turning it from harmless

gas into a swirling mass of harmful energy.

You  ll the air around your foes with energy, dealing damage.

You  choose  the  type  of  damage  to  deal  when  you  speak

this  utterance:  acid,  cold,  electricity,  or   re.  Creatures  in

the affected area take 2d6 points of energy damage, and an

additional 2d6 points of damage at the beginning of each of

their turns while they remain in the area.

FOG FROM THE VOID

Level: 1

Duration: 1 minute

SHIELD OF THE LANDSCAPE

Level: 1

Duration: 1 minute

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread, centered on you

At your words, moisture in the air and ground condenses into a

thick mist.

Your words create a thick, roiling cloud of black fog. This

utterance functions as a fog cloud spell (PH 232), except as

noted here.

If you add 10 to the DC of your Truespeak check, you can

instead create a more substantial fog, which functions as a

solid fog spell (PH 281) with a caster level equal to your true-

namer level, except as noted here.

LORE OF THE WORLD

Level: 3

Range: 20 ft.

Area: 20-ft.-radius spread, centered on you

Duration: 1 minute

The world around you comes alive at your words, willing to share

its ancient knowledge with you.

When you speak this utterance, you gain the ability to com-

municate  with  the  world  around  you.  Speaking  in  voices

that only you can hear, the earth, trees, water, and even the

wind respond to your request for information. This utter-

ance functions as a stone tell spell (PH 284) with a caster level

equal to your truenamer level. In addition to the information

described in the spell, the environment in the area of the

utterance  can  also  tap  the  knowledge  of  the  land  nearby,

and  can  give  you  the  direction  and  distance  to  a  location

you seek within one mile. You must know the name of the

speci c location you are trying to locate to use this aspect of

the utterance. If multiple locations exist within the area that

match the name of the place you seek, the land gives you the

direction and distance to the closest one.

For example, if you seek the Temple of Nerull, and it is

within the maximum range, you can learn the exact distance

and direction from the spot of the utterance that the temple

lies.

MASTER THE FOUR WINDS

Level: 3

Duration: 1 minute

The air reacts to your utterance, obeying your every command.

By speaking this utterance, you can bend the air to your will.

This utterance functions as a control winds spell (PH 214) with

a caster level equal to your truenamer level, except as noted

here.  All  within  range  hear  the  words  of  your  utterance,

carried on the winds you control throughout the utterances

duration.

You cause the ground to alter its basic form, creating cover for your

allies, or removing it for your foes.

You can temporarily create or remove natural obstacles that

provide  cover.  An  object  that  provides  total  cover  in  the

affected area now provides only cover, and any object that

provides cover no longer does so. Any small outcroppings

of rock, clumps of shrubberies, and even the trunks of trees

in the affected area wither and shrink from in front of your

foes.

Alternatively, you can create small outcroppings of cover

behind  which  you  and  your  allies  can  hide.  You  must  be

standing  on  a  natural  surface,  such  as  earth  or  unworked

stone,  to  use  this  effect.  Each  creature  of  Medium  size

or  smaller  in  the  area  gains  the  bene t  of  cover  from  the

outcroppings, which are not substantial enough to hinder

movement  through  these  squares.  These  outcroppings  do

not  provide  cover  against  adjacent  foes  (although  they  do

help against reach attacks).

After the utterances duration expires, the affected natural

obstacles resume their normal shape and position, growing

back to their original forms in a second or two.

SHOCKWAVE

Level: 1

Duration: 1 round

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

By  speaking  this  utterance,  you  order  the  air  to  pulse  violently,

knocking creatures in the area to the ground.

You  speak  words  of  power  that  cause  the  air  to  convulse

outward in a pulse of violent energy. A violent shock wave

travels through the air, and creatures in the area must make

Fortitude  saves  or  be  knocked  prone  and  take  1d4  points

of  nonlethal  damage.  Creatures  that  are  exceptionally

stablesuch as those with the stability racial trait or with

four or more legsgain their usual stability bonus (usually

+4) on this save.

SPEAK ROCK TO MUD

Level: 2

Duration: 1 minute

With a word, you create an area of viscous, sucking mud.

You  change  the  fundamental  nature  of  solid  stone  in  the

affected area, turning it into thick mud. This utterance func-

tions as a transmute rock to mud spell (PH 295) with a caster

level equal to your truenamer level, except as noted here.

252

THWART THE TRAVELER

Level: 3

Duration: 1 minute

The air grows thick and heavy, making extradimensional travel

impossible.

By speaking this utterance, you prevent any extradimensional

travel in the area. This utterance functions as a dimensional

lock spell (PH 221) with a caster level equal to your truenamer

level, except as noted here. Whenever a creature uses a spell

or spell-like ability to attempt to leave, it is brie y surrounded

by a blue nimbus and  ndsprobably to its surprisethat

it hasnt gone anywhere.

TRANSFORM THE LANDSCAPE

Level: 2

Duration: 1 minute

You can cause the ground to crack and split beneath your enemies

feet, impeding their progress, or you can smooth the ground beneath

the feet of your allies, making their passage easier.

You can temporarily create or remove dif cult terrain (PH

148) in the affected area. You can cause the natural terrain in

the area to buckle and crack, making it much more dif cult

to  traverse.  The  dif cult  terrain  does  not  obscure  line  of

sight or provide cover.

Alternatively, you can smooth an area of dif cult terrain

for your allies, eliminating penalties to movement or skill

checks the terrain would normally impose. Eliminating dif-

 cult terrain with this utterance does not eliminate terrain

features that provide cover.

As you deliver this utterance, the ground shifts and  ows

to  take  on  the  characteristics  you  seek,  eroding  obstacles

impossibly quickly or creating new debris through minor

temblors.

For  the  purposes  of  smoothing  dif cult  terrain,  light

rubble,  dense  rubble,  and  undergrowth  (all  described  in

Chapter 3 of the Dungeon Masters Guide) all count as dif cult

terrain when using this utterance.

After the utterances duration expires, the affected terrain

resumes its normal shape and position.

TRUENAME SPELLS

The following spells involve truenames in some way. Most

have  a  truename  component  (T),  meaning  that  the  caster

must succeed on a Truespeak check to have the spell func-

tion  as  desired.  The  Truespeak  check  takes  no  additional

time beyond that required for the spell itself, and it doesnt

provoke additional attacks of opportunity separately from

casting the spell.

AUGMENT TRUEFRIEND

Transmutation

Level: Bard 2, cleric 2, druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

With a red  ash, your named ally looks slightly more muscular

and heavily built. He seems to quiver with anticipation of coming

action.

The spell grants the subject a +2 enhancement bonus to

Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. All the usual bene ts

to better modi ers apply: attack rolls, melee damage rolls, hit

points, and so on.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

augmenting.

BANE OF THE ARCHRIVAL

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Area: 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space

As you complete the spell and pronounce the truename, a silvery

shimmer is faintly visible in the area you indicated, which pulses

angrily if your truename foe comes near.

This  spell  protects  those  within  its  area  against  a  single

named foe, doing so in three ways.

First, the area is forbidden to the creature. It must make

a successful Will save to enter it by any means (movement,

teleportation spells, and so on). If it fails its Will save and was

endeavoring to use a teleportation spell to enter the area, it is

shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within

10  feet  of  the  protected  area.  If  no  free  space  is  available

within 10 feet, the spell simply fails. The creature can try to

enter the area only once during its turn, but can continue to

try on subsequent rounds. Even if the named creature gets

inside  the  barrier,  the  other  aspects  of  the  spell  function

normally.

Second, all creatures within the area gain a +4 de ection

bonus to AC against attacks from the named creature, and a

+4 resistance bonus on saving throws required by the named

creatures spell effects and special attacks.

Third, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess or exercise

mental  control  over  those  within  the  spells  area  by  the

named creature, including enchantment (charm) effects and

enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant ongoing control

over the subject. Bane of the archrival suppresses these effects

for the duration of the spell or as long as the subject remains

within the spells area.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

protecting against.

BECKON PERSON

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One humanoid creature

Duration: 1 round; see text (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

With a crook of your  nger and some spoken truenames, you urge

a creature closer. The creatures eyes turn solid blue as it shambles

toward you.

This simple enchantment weaves truenames for approach

and closer into a spell that forces the subject to move closer

to you.

If you succeed on the Truespeak check and the creature

fails its saving throw, it must move at least 10 feet closer to

255

you each round if able. The creature can choose its own path

and means of locomotion, but if it can, it must end its turn at

least 10 feet closer to you than it started. The creature defends

itself normally and can take whatever actions it likes, so long

as it moves closer to you every turn. The creature can move

toward you faster than 10 feet per round if it likes.

When  the  creature  is  adjacent  to  you,  it  acts  normally

unless you move away. If you move away, it must move 10

feet per round closer to your new location if it can.

The beckon person spell lasts for at least 1 round, but it might

last longer if you excel at the Truespeak check (described

below).

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly  speak  the  truenames  associated  with  movement

and approach. You learn these truenames when you learn

this spell. The Truespeak DC to cast this spell is 15; you add

2 rounds to the duration for every 5 points by which you

exceed the DC.

BECKON MONSTER

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round; see text (D)

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell functions like beckon person, except that the effect

is not restricted by creature type or size.

BULWARK OF REALITY

Conjuration (Creation) [Force]

Level: Sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

You utter your own truename, weaving its power into a matrix

of force-tentacles that shimmer brie y, then descend around your

form.

A faintly glowing silvery  eld of force surrounds you, provid-

ing you with a +6 armor bonus to Armor Class.

Unlike mundane armor, the bulwark of reality entails no

armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed

reduction.  Because  the  bulwark  of  reality  is  made  of  force,

incorporeal creatures cant bypass it the way they do normal

armor.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak your own personal truename.

EXPUNGE THE SUPERNATURAL

Abjuration

Level: Bard 6, cleric 8, druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, T, XP

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Permanent

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

As you cast the spell, a ghostly, grasping hand appears to reach inside

your foe, pull out a black, cloudy mass before disappearing.

This spell functions as spurn the supernatural, except that its

effect is permanent and it eliminates only one supernatural

ability, no matter how high your Truespeak check.

Your target loses the chosen supernatural ability until it

undergoes a ritual of renaming or is the target of a wish  or

miracle spell. If the subject has a temporary supernatural

ability  (such  as  those  granted  to  binders  by  vestiges),  it

loses  that  ability,  but  this  spell  does  nothing  to  prevent

the subject from gaining the same or other supernatural

abilities later.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

targeting.

XP Cost: 500 XP.

HIDDEN TRUENAME

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target:  One  creature  with  an  Intelligence  score  of  3  or

higher

Duration: 24 hours

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

You  chant  a  personal  truename  in  an  ever-quieter  voice  as  you

slowly lower your hand and crouch, trying to erase traces of the

personal truename from the cosmos.

The  subject  gains  protection  from  those  who  would  use

her personal truename for ill purposes, and a modicum of

defense against utterances that use more general truenames.

The  subject  of  a  hidden  truename  spell  gets  a  +2  bonus  on

saving throws against utterances.

In  addition,  those  trying  to  research  the  personal  true-

name of a creature protected by hidden truename take a 8

penalty on the Knowledge check required to do so. (True-

name research rules are detailed on page 196.)

256

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

trying to protect.

HORROR OF THE SPOKEN NAME

Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Bard 2, cleric 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: 1d4 rounds or 1 round; see text

Saving Throw: Will partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You practically howl the truename of your foe, screaming with as

much imposing hatred as you can muster.

The affected creature becomes frightened. If the subject suc-

ceeds on a Will save, it is shaken for 1 round. Creatures with

10 or more Hit Dice have immunity to this effect.

Horror  of  the  spoken  name counters  and  dispels  remove

fear.

Truename  Component:  When  you  cast  this  spell,  you

must correctly speak the truename of the creature youre

targeting.

RITUAL OF RENAMING

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 8, druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, T, XP

Casting Time: 1 hour

Range: Touch

Target: One willing creature with a Intelligence score of

3 or higher

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Repeatedly waving your hand over the subject and repeating both

the old and the new personal truename, you magically meld them

with the power of your voice until the old name is no more.

When  an  archrival  learns  your  personal  truename,  that

enemy has a great degree of power over you. If your personal

truename spreads to other hostile forces and factions, you

might  nd yourself uniquely vulnerable to their machina-

tions. Only a ritual of renaming will give you a new personal

truename.

Once complete, the ritual of renaming gives the target a new

personal truename that is known to the caster, the target,

and everyone in attendance. Anyone who previously used

research techniques (see page 196) to learn the targets per-

sonal truename will discover that the old truename doesnt

work anymore.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

make a successful Truespeak check to correctly speak both

SCRAMBLE TRUE POSITION

Conjuration (Teleportation)

Level: Bard 1, cleric 1, sorcerer/wizard 1

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Area: 10-ft.-radius spread

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: Re ex partial; see text

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  utter  truenames  for  directions  with  great  rapidity  as  you

gesture toward where youre casting the spell. With a sizzle and

a   ash,  those  within  the  spells  radius  disappear,  then  reappear

somewhere nearby.

The scramble true position spell can wreck an enemys care-

fully constructed defenses or highly regarded plan of attack

by randomly moving them around. You cant control where

your enemies reappear, but they might fall off a precipice or

wind up between your rogue and  ghter allies.

When you cast the spell, make a single Truespeak check.

Then compare your result to the DC to move each creature:

15 + (2  CR). If you meet or exceed the DC for a creature,

move that creature 2 squares in a random direction using the

targeted on square part of the diagram on page 158 of the

Players Handbook. The scramble true position spell cant send

a creature into a square occupied by solid matter or another

creature, but it can send a creature into a dangerous place

(into lava or off a cliff, for example). Make the comparison

and movement in descending CR order. If multiple targets

have  the  same  CR,  the  caster  chooses  the  order  in  which

to relocate them. If you cant move a target 2 squares in a

particular direction, move it 1 square, or it disappears and

reappears in the same square if relocation is impossible.

Having their true locations disrupted with this spell can

be disorienting for the subjects. Every creature that you move

with this spell (even those who reappear in the same square

they started in) must succeed on a Re ex save or fall prone.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the truenames for cardinal directions and

movement, which you learn with the spell. This check has

no set DC, but if your Truespeak check result is lower than

15 + (2  creatures CR) for the lowest CR creature in the area,

then scramble true position has no effect.

SPURN THE SUPERNATURAL

Abjuration

Level: Bard 4, cleric 5, druid 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Fortitude negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Your make your hand into a grasping claw as you speak your foes

truename, stealing some of its supernatural energy, which appears

as a miniscule storm-cloud in your hand.

With this spell, you can temporarily suppress a supernatural

ability possessed by the target creature. For the duration of

the  spell,  the  target  is  unable  to  activate  the  supernatural

ability you have chosen. Extraordinary and spell-like abilities

arent affected by this spell.

If you succeed on the Truespeak check, you can suppress

one  of  the  creatures  supernatural  abilities,  plus  another

supernatural ability for every 5 points by which your result

beat the Truespeak DC.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

targeting.

TRUE BANISHMENT

Abjuration

Level: Cleric 8

Components: V, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One extraplanar creature

Duration: Instantaneous; see text

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You thrust your holy symbol at the creature as you speak its true-

name,  sending  it  back  whence  it  came  in  a  swirl  of   ame  and

brimstone.

This spells functions like the banishment spell, except that it

requires a successful Truespeak check to function and allows

no saving throw (spell resistance still applies, though.)

The true banishment spell affects only a single creature, but

theres no Hit Dice limit other than the one implicit in the

Truespeak check DC.

Objects that the target hates, fears, or opposes dont grant

bonuses on the level check to overcome the creatures spell

resistance.

If true banishment is successful, the target cannot return

to the plane it was banished from for one month per caster

levelunless it learns and correctly speaks the spellcasters

personal truename, in which case the prohibition no longer

applies.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

trying to banish.

258

TRUE PRAYER OF THE CHOSEN

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 4, paladin 3

Components: V, S, DF, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Raising your eyes to the skies, you speak your own truename to your

patron deity, asking for protection as your mission takes you into

harms way. A golden coruscation surrounds you.

True  prayer  of  the  chosen  grants  you  a  +3  insight  bonus  on

saving throws and to Armor Class. For the duration of the

spell, you are protected by the power of your deity, who gives

you divine insight into the threats youre about to face.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak your personal truename.

TRUE PRAYER OF THE FAITHFUL

Transmutation

Level: Cleric 2, paladin 2

Components: V, DF, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One or more creatures, no two of which are more

than 30 ft. apart; see text

Duration: 1 round/level; see text

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

Raising your eyes to the skies, you concentrate on a brief prayer

using  the  true  language  of  the  universe,  using  truename  power

to ask for the favor of your patron deity. A  ashing, brassy mote of

energy spins around those you target.

When you cast true prayer of the faithful, you ask your patron

deity  to  give  your  allies  (possibly  including  yourself)  a

measure of divine aid. The subjects of this spell gain a +1

luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and

skill checks.

This spell automatically affects a single target if you suc-

ceed on the required Truespeak check. But the higher your

Truespeak check result, the more creatures you can affect

(see below).

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak a truename associated with your deity. You

learn this truename when you learn this spell. Its not your

deitys  truename,  but  a  term  associated  with  divine  assis-

tance. The Truespeak DC is 20, and you can have the true

prayer of the faithful affect one additional creature for every 5

points by which you exceed the Truespeak DC. In addition,

you gain an extra round of duration for every personal true-

name of a target creature you speak during the casting of the

spell; your patron deity is better able to identify and assist

your friends if you tell the deity their personal truenames.

With a  ourish of your hands, the creature appears in the magic

trap you have laid. You threaten it with the power of its personal

truename, and it hangs its head as it agrees to perform a service

on your behalf.

This spell functions like lesser planar binding, except that you

can call a single creature of CR 6 or less, and you must know

its personal truename to call it.

Once you demonstrate mastery of that truename with a

successful  Truespeak  check,  you  can  compel  the  creature

to perform a service on your behalf. If you roll a 1 on the

Truespeak check required by this spell, the creature breaks

free of the binding and can escape or attack you.

The  creature  gets  its  Will  save  and  spell  resistance  as

normal for lesser planar binding. If the creature does not break

free, you attempt to compel the creature to perform a service

not with opposed Charisma checks, but with the Truespeak

check you made when you cast the spell. The bound creature

opposes this check with either a Truespeak check, saying its

own personal truename, or a Charisma check.

If  you  can  assign  an  open-ended  task,  such  as  defend

me against attack, the service lasts for one day. Once the

259

requested service is performed, the creature need only so

inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. You can

extend the creatures duration of service with a particularly

high  Truespeak  check.  For  every  5  points  by  which  your

Truespeak check (made when you cast the spell) exceeds the

creatures Truespeak or Charisma check, the duration of the

creatures service is extended by one additional day.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the target creature

youre trying to bind to service.

XP Cost: 100 XP.

TRUENAME DISPEL

Abjuration

Level: Bard 6, cleric 8, druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

Target: One creature

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

By speaking aloud the personal truename of your foe and pointing

with arm outstretched, you cause a gray haze to swirl around your

target  brie y.  Then  the  haze  dissipates,  carrying  your  enemys

magic with it.

This spell enables you to see the strands of magic surround-

ing your target and selectively separate them. This functions

like  the  dispel  magic  spell,  except  that  it  always  targets  a

creature, you learn the nature of each ongoing magical effect

currently affecting the target creature, and effects you want

to dispel are automatically removed (no caster level check

is necessary). If you succeed on the Truespeak check, you

can  choose  which  effects  you  want  to  dispel.  Thus,  you

can  eliminate  harmful  effects  while  retaining  bene cial

onesor vice versa.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

targeting with truename dispel.

SAMPLE BINDING TASKS

The description of the planar binding spells on pages 261262

of the Players Handbook offers general advice on services and

rewards. No creature likes to be called with a planar binding or

truename binding spell. The spell creates a trap and contains a

strong element of coercion. Whenever a command is ambigu-

ous, a bound creature will interpret it in the way most advanta-

geous to itself. Unlike a summoned creature, a bound creature

also has a robust desire to preserve its own life. It will take risks

if  it  must,  but  will  try  to  survive,  too.  Impossible  or  suicidal

demands are never agreed to.

Most  truename  binding  and  planar  binding  spells  prove  ef-

ficacious to the caster. The cost of the spell generally provides

suitable  benefits.  The  rare  occasions  when  a  bound  creature

cleverly circumvents the casting should be noteworthy events

with campaign relevance.

Here are some common sample duties.

Assassinate:  The  called  creature  might  be  ordered  to  kill  a

particular  individual.  Since  most  bound  creatures  dont  have

extensive information-gathering resources such as scrying spells

or  other  divinations,  the  caster  must  be  able  to  give  precise

information about the target and its location.

Defend:  Sometimes  a  caster  wants  a  bound  creature  to

defend her or an ally against attack. Most often, the creature

interprets this as attacking any creature that actively attacks the

person whom it is assigned to protect. If several foes attack, the

bound creature usually chooses to take out the weakest of them

unless specific targets are designated. It wont attack a creature

that has not attacked the person it wards.

Deliver:  A  bound  creature  might  be  assigned  to  deliver  an

item or a message. Savvy casters give precise instructions about

the speed and method of travel.

Guard:  Creatures  often  wind  up  having  to  guard  an  area

against intruders or thieves. Bound creatures find duties such

as this to be the most irksome, due to their open-ended nature.

They often amuse themselves with thinking up ways to circum-

vent their orders. For instance, Blish, a water mephit, was bound

to guard a particular room in a dungeon. The room happened

to contain a great deal of gold. Blish chose to negotiate with an

adventuring party that contained a distantly related mephling.

Blish tossed all the gold out into the corridor and didnt attack

the adventurers, who agreed not to enter the room, but instead

to hunt down the spellcaster who bound the little mephit.

Spell Resistance: Yes

Remaining utterly still for a moment, you clench your  st and speak

words of such potency that the creature you name simply ceases to

exist. Theres no  re, no  ash, and no corpse. Its as if the creature

you named never existed in the  rst place.

Ululations and nonsense syllables cascade from your mouth as you

intentionally mispronounce your enemys truename. Your foes  esh

takes on a gelatinous state and starts to fuse together, forming a

bloblike  gure where your enemy once stood.

With this most powerful of spells,

you  erase  a  subjects  truename

from  existence  itself.  The

last  thing  the  subject  ever

hears  is  your  voice  uttering

its  truenamethen  nothing

but oblivion. Items worn, held,

or  carried  by  the  creature  are

likewise  obliterated  with  no

save allowed.

Creatures  killed  with  an

unname  spell  are  dif cult  to

restore to life (see The Unnamed

sidebar).

Truename  Component:  When

you cast this spell, you must cor-

rectly speak the personal truename of

the  creature  youre  trying  to  erase  from

reality.

WARP TRUENAME

Transmutation

Level: Druid 4, sorcerer/

Components: V, S, T

Casting Time: 1 standard

Range: Close (25 ft. +

Target: One creature

Duration: 1 round/level

THE UNNAMED

Returning  a  creature  to  life  after  it  has  succumbed  to  an

unname  spell  is  difficult  to  accomplish. Resurrection

isnt

possible without a body, and the soul has been expunged as

well. This spell alters reality itself so that the named creature

cannot live; without a truename, its existence would violate

the fundamental laws of the universe.

In  a  2-hour-long  ceremony,  a  succession  of  spells  needs

to be cast. First, you perform a ritual of renaming to create a

new personal truename for the creature youre trying to bring

back from unnaming (this is an intentional exception to the

target described in the ritual of renaming spell). Then a true

resurrection spell must be cast to restore the soul (with its new

personal truename) and life to the new body.

This  spell  functions  as  polymorph,

except that you change the subject

into a horrid form as its features

melt  into  only  marginally

recognizable protoplasm.

The  subject  becomes

an  aberration  with  10

Strength, 10 Dexterity,

and  10  Constitution.

Its new form has a slam

attack appropriate for a

creature of its size (see

Table  51  on  page  296

of  the  Monster  Manual),

a  speed  of  20  feet,  and

no other extraordinary or

supernatural abilities.

Unname reduces a mind  ayer

to nothingness

If the spell succeeds, the

subject  must  also  make  a

Will save. If this second save

fails,  the  creature  loses  its

extraordinary,  supernatu-

ral, and spell-like abilities,

and loses its ability to cast

spells (if it had the ability)

for  the  duration  of  the

spell.

Regardless of the second

save,  the  subject  still

retains its class and level (or Hit

Dice), as well as all bene ts derived

therefrom (such as base attack bonus,

base save bonuses, and hit points). It

retains  any  class  features  (other  than  spellcasting)  that

arent  extraordinary,  supernatural,  or  spell-like  abilities.

The  subject  has  the  same  limbs  it  did  before  the  warp

truename  spell,  so  it  can  still  manipulate  object  and  use

equipment. The subject can still speak, albeit in a gurgling,

pained voice.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures have immunity to warp

truename,  and  a  creature  with  the  shapechanger  subtype

(such as a lycanthrope or a doppelganger) can revert to its

natural form as a standard action.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the personal truename of the creature youre

trying to warp.

WORD OF GENESIS

Conjuration (Creation)

Level: Cleric 9

Components: V, S, T, XP

Effect:  A  demiplane  coterminous  with  the  Astral  Plane,

centered on your location

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

TRUENAME MAGIC ITEMS

Items  devoted  to  truename  magic  are  relatively  rare.  Of

course,  truenamers  use  all  manner  of  wondrous  items,

potions, armor, and weapons, but few care to devote the time

and effort to creating items. The need for a reliable skill check

for charged items also makes truenamers reluctant to risk

their time, money, and experience points when they might

fail.  Indeed,  even  when  truename  items  are  made,  their

narrow focus prevents them from having universal appeal.

From the silvery haze of the Astral plane, you begin to weave tendrils

of mist as you speak words of power. Floating in space, you begin to

construct reality anew with your words and gestures.

You create a  nite plane with limited access: a demiplane.

Demiplanes created by this spell are very small, very minor

planes.

This  spell  works  best  when  cast  while  you  are  on  the

Astral  Plane  (various  spells  allow  access  to  these  planes,

including plane shift and gate). Casting this spell creates a

local density  uctuation that precipitates the creation of a

demiplane.

At  rst, the  edgling plane has a 100-foot radius. Once

created, it grows by 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot

increase in radius per year). Once your demiplane is created,

you can travel to it using plane shift or some other spell or

permanent link that you arrange for separately.

You determine the environment within the demiplane

when you cast word of genesis, re ecting most any desire you

can visualize. You determine factors such as atmosphere,

water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain.

This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor

can  it  create  objects  or  constructed  elements  (such  as

buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). You must

add these details in some other fashion if you desire. You

cant create lingering magical effects with this power; you

have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you cant

create a demiplane out of esoteric material such as silver

or  uranium;  youre  limited  to  stone  and  dirt.  You  cant

manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait

is as the Material Plane.

Once your demiplane is complete, you can cast the spell

again and again, each time increasing its radius by another

100 feet.

Truename Component: When you cast this spell, you must

correctly speak the truename of the place youre creating;

the Truespeak DC is 50.

XP Cost: 1,000 XP.

POTIONS

Any Lexicon of the Evolving Mind utterance of 1st or 2nd

level can become a potion. The creator, or team of creators,

must have the Brew Potion feat, know the speci c utterance,

and make a Truespeak check at the time the potion is brewed.

The potion will work only for creatures up to the CR the

Truespeak check would affect. These potions have standard

gp and experience point costs as described on page 284 of

the Dungeon Masters Guide.

This means that a character might create or buy a potion

that will not work for her until she gains a level or two, or

that be might be usable for only a short while.

SPELL TRIGGER OR SPELL

COMPLETION ITEMS

Scrolls,  staves,  and  wands  are  created  to  target  a  speci c

truename. This means that a scroll might be crafted to work

against Zbavra the Witch-Queen, or a bene cial wand might

have Tordek as the target.

The scroll targeting Zbavra might prove worthless if the

Truespeak check failed to encompass her CR. Tordek might

become so powerful that the wand no longer can affect him

based on the Truespeak check. Few truespeakers are willing

to bear the costs of such uncertain items.

However,  some  do.  These  specially  crafted  items  can

become  the  object  of  quests  for  those  who  want  magic  to

overcome a powerful foe. Perhaps the player characters know

that they will face Zbavra. They also might have ascertained

that one of her previous enemies was a truespeaker named

Gtharthan focused on destroying her. Legends speak of the

extensive preparations he made to defeat the Witch-Queen

and  how  he  sought  to  ensure  her  destruction,  even  if  his

personal efforts failed. The party might seek out a repository

of Gtharthans items, which includes some truename scrolls

or a staff that targets the vile witch.

WONDROUS ITEMS

Every truenamer with the resources to do so purchases an

amulet of the silver tongue. Since making a Truespeak check is

so vitally important to the truenamer, the item is an absolute

must-have.

262

AMULET OF THE SILVER TONGUE

An amulet of the silver tongue makes its wearer better able

to pronounce words clearly and correctlya key aspect

of the art of the truenamer.

Description:  An  amulet  of  the  silver  tongue

depicts  a  grinning  face  with  an  open  mouth.

Naturally,  most  are  fashioned  from  silver.

Many have a pin on the back and are used

as a cloak-clasp.

An  amulets  functions  are  subtle,

although wearers seem to enunciate their

words more clearly, whether theyre uttering

truenames or conversing normally.

Prerequisite:  This  item  functions  for  any

creature, but only those with the Truespeak skill

bene t from wearing it.

Activation: An amulet of the silver tongue provides

its bonus as long as its worn.

Effect: The lesser version of the amulet grants a +5

enhancement bonus on Truespeak checks. A greater

amulet  of  the  silver  tongue  grants  a  +10  enhancement

bonus.

Aura/Caster Level: Moderate transmutation. CL 7th.

Construction: Craft Wondrous Item, glibness, Truespeak

5  ranks  (lesser)  or  Truespeak  10  ranks  (greater),  1,250  gp

(lesser)  or  5,000  gp  (greater),  100  XP  (lesser)  or  400  XP

(greater), 3 days (lesser) or 10 days (greater).

Variants: Divine spellcasters sometimes use vestments of

the silver tongue (+625 gp for lesser and +5,000 gp for greater).

Amulets are problematic for clerics and druids because so

many wear periapts of Wisdom.

Weight: .

Price: 2,500 gp (lesser), 10,000 gp (greater).

ARTIFACTS

The  power  and  force  of  truename  magic  is  contained  in

several artifacts of incredible power.

BOOK OF TRUE BINDS

The Book of True Binds is a legendary item coveted by those

who practice truename binding.

Description:  The  Book  of  True  Binds  is  a  massive  tome

2 feet wide and 3 feet tall. The books binding appears to

be of maroon leather, embedded with silver, cold iron, and

adamantine runes depicting a variety of summoning circles.

When held, the person touching the tome hears a susurra-

tion of telepathic whimpers, screams, and wails of despair.

This massive tome contains hundreds of pages of thick

vellum, but most of them are blank. Only twenty pages

still bear inscriptions. Each page contains the truename

of an outsider or elemental of great power, even more

potent  than  those  summonable  by  a  greater

truename binding spell.

It  is  said  that  long  ago  every  page  of

this  book  was   lled  with  a  creatures

name  and  description,  but  as  the

creatures  died,  the  corresponding

pages about them went blank. Outsid-

ers and elementals are eternal creatures

that  do  not  die  natural  deaths,  so  scholars

speculate that they must have died in battle,

but a few wonder if being bound by the book

might have caused more than one such creature

Effect:  Each  of  the  twenty  pages  of  the  book

contains the truename and description of a creature

of CR 15 to CR 20. Reading a page aloud summons

the creature as if by a truename binding spell. The reader can

negotiate with the creature using either a Charisma check

or  a  Truespeak  check.  If  the  reader  rolls  a  1,  the  creature

will endeavor to take the book away or, failing that, kill the

reader.

TOME OF TRUENAMING

Several  copies  of  the  minor  artifact  known  as  the  tome  of

truenaming are known to exist. The book enables the reader

to learn and, if desired, change her own truename.

Description: Bound with azure blue cloth, a tome of true-

naming is a small square book, measuring only a handspan

in diameter with only a few pages made of  ne, transparent

onion-skin- ne paper. The paper appears to be  lled with

tiny script.

Tome of truenaming

Activation:  Despite  its  small  size,  a  tome  of  truenaming

takes one week to read.

Effect: To each reader, the book is a perfect biography of

his life. The volume reveals to the reader the most personal

and intimate details about him and recounts every major and

many minor events of his life. The effect of this is to reveal

to the reader his personal truename.

TRUENAME MONSTERS

Truename  monsters  are  physical  embodiments  of

creatures turn the power of utterances against their foes.

WORD ARCHONS IN EBERRON

Word archons are part of the celestial host that battles evil

Word archon

The  mission  of  a  word  archon  is  to  protect  such  noble

concepts  as  virtue,  goodness,  and  charity.  Using  the

power of truenames, they travel far from Celestia to make

sure such words inspire the good-hearted everywhereand

evildoers that face the wrath of a word archons voice raised

against them.

Word  archons  believe  that  truename  magic  is  the  most

pure and perfect form of expression. They treat it as some-

thing sacred and holy. They view those who pervert it, such

as logokron devils and garblers, as hideous abominations and

will attack them on sight.

A word archon is about 7 feet tall and weighs from 150 to

200 pounds.

COMBAT

A word archon prefers to prepare the battle eld with a shock-

wave utterance, then speak a reversed archers eye utterance

to protect itself from ranged attacks before swooping into

melee swinging its +1 holy warhammers. If foes are likely to

retreat  before  its  righteous  onslaught,  a  word  archon  will

resort to reversed  potent words of nurturing to deal damage

from a distance.

each  pair  of  hands.  Its  wide  tongue  lolls

several  feet  out  of  its  mouth,  revealing  an

eldritch  symbol  tattooed  on  ita  symbol

that is painful to look at.

Logokron  devils  epitomize  evil,  malice,

and scheming. Theyre clever creatures that

lay  long-term  plans  and  work  steadily  and

patiently  to  achieve  them.  They  delight  in

learning  the  personal  truenames  of  their

foes, then tormenting them or turning them

into slaves.

Lesser devils, such as barbed devils, fear and serve

logokron devils. They perform all manner of services for the

logokrons, including spying,  ghting, and even menial tasks

such as carrying messages. Most logokron devils have one

or more barbed devils in attendance at all times.

A logokron devil is about 10 feet tall, weighs about 600

pounds, and speaks Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Draconic,

Ignan, and Infernal.

Symbol  of  Pain  (Su): The  tattoo  on  the  tongue  of  a

logokron devil is a continuously active symbol of pain (as the

spell, DC 20). All baatezu have immunity to a logokron devils

symbol of pain.

Summon Baatezu (Sp): Once per day, a logokron devil

can attempt to summon 1d3 barbed devils or one ice devil

with a 75% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent

of a 6th-level spell.

LOGOKRON DEVIL

SOCIETY

Logokron  devils  are  schemers

who  surround  themselves  with

minions, but regard other logok-

rons  as  rivals.  They  seek  to  learn

the personal truenames of powerful creatures

(often powerful  ends and heroes from the

Material Plane), then use their utterances to

bend these creatures to their will. Because

they  are  eager  scholars  in  the  discipline  of

truenames, they often travel the Material Plane to

research the truenames they know.

LOGOKRON DEVILS IN EBERRON

Logokron devils  ght in the endless battles on Shavarath.

They  can  be  mighty  generals,  but  they  often  focus  on

conducting  espionage  and  assassinating  opposing  leaders.

They particularly hate word archons and go to great lengths

to oppose them.

LOGOKRON DEVILS IN FAERN

Logokron  devils  reside  in  the  Nine  Hells.  Many  venture

to  Toril  for  the  rich  resources  useful  for  furthering  their

ambitions on Baator. Occasionally, a logokron devil will take

up residence in Toril, either as part of a pact it makes or in

furtherance of its grander schemes.

COMBAT

A logokron devil observes its foes from a safe distance if it

can, using minions to learn what its enemies are capable of.

Then  a  logokron  uses  reversed morale  boost  to  force  some

words of nurturing.

Level Adjustment: 

A  horrible,  gibbering  mass  of   esh  and  teeth  babbles  incoher-

ently. An occasional word of power is almost discernible amid the

cacophony.

A garbler is a nightmarish creature that ruthlessly attacks any

living creature that it senses. It moves in an eerie, disjointed

manner, as it lunges several of its mouths in a direction, bites

at the ground or walls, and drags its body behind it.

Scholars have yet to reach a consensus on the origin of

garblers. The most popular theory is that the  rst garblers

were  embryonic  gibbering  mouthers  warped  by  powerful

truename magic.

A  garbler  is  about  3  feet  long  and  weighs  40  to  50

pounds.

Garblers do not speak or understand any language.

Even telepathy powers fail to produce meaningful

communication. They are quite insane.

COMBAT

A garbler is blind, but it can sense

foes nearby using its blind-

sight. Once it detects prey,

a  garbler  rushes  to  attack

the nearest creature with its

many, gnashing mouths.

Random Utterance (Su): Every round as a free action,

amid its garbled babbling, a garbler speaks one word of

power.  This  utterance  affects  one  random  target

within range.

Reverse  Utterance  (Su):  As  an  immediate  action,  a

garbler can reverse any utterance from the Lexicon of the

Evolving  Mind  that  it  hears  spoken  within  60  feet.  The

target remains the same, but a garbler uses this ability when

reversing an utterance would be advantageous to it. Thus, a

truespeaker seeking to harm the garbler with a reversed word

of  nurturing  might  inadvertently  heal  it  instead.  A  garbler

instinctively  knows  how  best  to  reverse  an  utterance  and

will never reverse a bene cial utterance that targets it.

Immunities:  A  garbler  has  immunity  to  gaze  attacks,

visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on

sight.

Skills: A garbler never needs to make a Truespeak check

for its utterances.

GARBLERS IN EBERRON

Garblers  are  native  to  the  plane  of  Xoriat,  the  Realm  of

Madness,  and  gain  the  extraplanar  subtype  in  Eberron.

Interestingly, a large number of them are found in Xendrik,

often in ruins of ancient libraries and other places of learn-

ing, especially those that contained information pertaining

to truename magic.

GARBLERS IN FAERN

Most  garblers  reside  in  the  Underdark,  wandering  the

endless caverns. Recently, a few captured specimens have

entertained the Red Wizards of Thay with new opportunities

for magical experimentation. The Red Wiz-

ards  nd truename magic a distasteful

Loquasphinx

A muscular, leonine creature with a strangely human

face regards you with uncanny intelligence. Its large body is brown,

but down its length you see narrow, faint bands of black. Two large

feathered wings grow behind its shoulders, and it has eerie green

eyes. When it opens its mouth, you have only a moment to regard

its  daggerlike  teeth  before  it  begins  to  speakand  you  feel  the

structure of the world begin to press in with bewildering rapidity

on your suddenly fragile mind.

Loquasphinxes are rare creatures, and they are avid students

of Truespeech. They spend most of their time in aeries on

desert  plateaus  or  hills,  studying  the  world  around  them

and  adding  to  their  Truespeech  vocabularies.  Mostly,

loquasphinxes seek to be left alone, but they can be roused

to pursue any rare collection of knowledge, whether books

or a particularly learned individual.

Unlike  some  other  sphinxes,  loquasphinxes  come  in

both genders. They need not seek out an androsphinx

or  gynosphinx  to  mate.  They  are  also  connois-

seurs  of  good  conversation,  and  many  con icts

with  loquasphinxes  have  been  averted  by  wise

creatures  that  have  been  willing  to  share  an

interesting  anecdote  or  piece  of  information.

Some loquasphinxes are even sought out for

their tremendous knowledge and willingness

to  identify  magic  items  using  their  analyze

item  utterance.  Even  the  most  friendly  of

loquasphinxes is typically unwilling to allow

anyone  free  access  to  its  abilities,  however,

and  these  creatures  are  commonly  known

to  accept  large  bribesalthough  bribes  of

knowledge and information are more readily

accepted than those of gold or valuables.

A loquasphinx is around 9 feet long and weighs

between 500 and 750 pounds. It speaks Common

and up to six other languages, which vary

with each individual loquasphinx.

COMBAT

A  loquasphinx  only  usually

attacks  when  forced  to  do

soor if another creature has

something  it  wants,  whether

food, money, or most especially,

information.  It  tends  to  begin

combat from the air, circling its

enemies at a range of 60 feet and

using utterances on likely targets

to soften up its foes. A loquasphinx

keeps  its  truespeak  interrogation

ability active at all times, targeting a

different creature each time one suc-

cumbs to the effect. If its utterances

prove to be ineffective, or if a group

of foes contains a truespeaker capable of countering their

effects, a loquasphinx resorts to melee attacks.

Rake (Ex): +12 melee, damage 1d6+2.

Truespeech  Interrogation  (Su):  A  loquasphinx  is  a

master of Truespeech, and bombards its prey with a confus-

ing barrage of riddles posed in the purest of languages. Each

round as a free action, a loquasphinx can pose a question

in  Truespeech  to  a  creature  within  60  feet.  Whether  the

creature  knows  the  answer  to  the  question  is  irrelevant.

A loquasphinxs words, couched in Truespeech, are  lled

with power, and if the target creature does not succeed on

a DC 17 Will save, it is confused for 3 rounds. The save DC

is Charisma-based.

A creature with ranks in Truespeak can attempt to coun-

terspeak to negate the effect of this ability, as described on

page 234. In addition, a creature with Truespeak can choose

to make an opposed Truespeak check instead of a Will save,

attempting to answer the loquasphinxs question instead

of simply resisting its potent magic.

If the creatures check is higher

than  that  of  the  loquasphinx,

it  is  completely  unaffected  by

truespeak interrogation.

LOQUASPHINXES

IN EBERRON

Loquasphinxes  inhabit

the  deserts  of  Xendrik.

A few can also be found

in the Blade Desert of the

Talenta  Plains.  One  half-

ling  tribe,  the  Ghatharon,

formed an amicable alliance

with a loquasphinx named Sther-

this passed at a gathering

respect (and avoid) loquasphinxes.

Painspeaker

LOQUASPHINXES IN FAERN

Loquasphinxes are most commonly found in the deserts of

Mulhorand and Anauroch. According to rumor, they guard

several ruins in Raurin, the Dust Desert. Velaquateraturin,

a 7th-level loquasphinx truenamer, makes its home in Anau-

This twisted creature appears almost

skeletal,  so  tight  is  its  grayish   esh

drawn  across  its  bones.  More  striking

than its physical appearance, however,

is  its  voice,  as  it  gibbers  and  coos  in

the  ancient  rhythms  of  some  forgotten

tongue.  Each  syllable  is  a  visceral  touch

of  unfettered  evil,  a  reminder  of  pain  long

forgotten.

Painspeakers are twisted undead creatures with sicken-

ing gray  esh drawn tight over their bones. They were once

humanoids  who  died  with  some  important  message  left

unsaid, whether a courier who failed to deliver an entreaty

for peace, a hopeful lover who failed to speak her heart, or

a witness who failed to step forth and speak the truth. For

these creatures, death and the failure to speak were the same

anguish. Having risen because of the tortured words that

they failed to utter, painspeakers now give voice to their pain

in Truespeech, blighting the lives of others with the power

of the spoken word.

A  painspeaker  resembles  the  person  it  had  been  when

alive. Someone who knew the painspeaker before its death

might recognize it with a DC 20 Spot check.

A painspeaker speaks the languages it knew when alive.

COMBAT

In  the   rst  round  of  combat,  this  foul  creature  speaks  its

vile  utterance,  vomiting  forth  its  perversion  of  the  power

of Truespeech. It then uses the Recitation of the Forti ed

State and the total defense action to protect itself from harm

until it can use its utterance once more. Even when taking

the total defense action, a painspeaker moves aggressively

toward  lighter  armed  and  armored  creatures,  hoping  to

force  them  into  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity  when

they move away.

Utterance  of  Pain  (Sp):  Once  every  3  rounds,  a  pain-

speaker  can  use  a  reversed  moderate  word  of  nurturing

utterance as a 6th-level truenamer. Unlike normal uses of an

utterance, this ability is not subject to the Law of Resistance,

so repeat uses in a day do not add 2 to the DC of its Truespeak

checks.

Skills: Painspeakers have a +10 racial bonus on Truespeak

checks.

PAINSPEAKERS IN EBERRON

The Mournland is home to a number of painspeakers, many

of whom died on the Day of Mourning. Elsewhere in Khor-

vaire, painspeakers are rare, but they have been encountered

in  all  the  Five  Nations.  No  record  exists  of  any  creature

exactly  matching  the  description  of  a  painspeaker  before

the Day of Mourning. Many believe that the magnitude of

the tragedywhich left so many words unspokencreated

this new creature.

PAINSPEAKERS IN FAERN

Painspeakers  have  a  long  history  in  Faern.  Theyre  rare

creatures,  often  connected  to  important  events.  About  a

century ago, Ankandara, a beautiful sun elf cleric, of ciated

over the temple of Sune in Waterdeep. Many of the congrega-

tion attended services with the dual purpose of honoring

the  goddess  and  appreciating  the  grace  and  beauty  of  her

cleric. One such parishioner was a shy ranger named Erdwin

the Silent. Erdwin spent much of his time in the wild, but

would often return to the city. Month after month, he tried

to work up the courage to declare his devotion to Ankandara

but failed. During the last rage of dragons, he died when his

copper dragon ally went berserk. Erdwins deep, undeclared

love  caused  him  to  return  as  a  painspeaker.  The  dragon-

mauled corpse fought its way to the Temple of Sune, killing

several  people  who  tried  to  stop  it.  It  rampaged  until  the

commotion drew Ankandaras attention. Upon seeing her,

it whispered, Ankandara, in truth it was you I came here to

worship, not Sune, and then crumbled to dust.

TRUENAME

ORGANIZATIONS

This section details two important organizations associated

with truename magic.

COLLECTORS

OF THE LEXICON

Words are amoral. It is their speakers that are good or evil.

Prekish Blackpennant

Founded by maverick illumians (from the Races of Destiny

supplement), the Collectors are hoarders of words, especially

words of Truespeech. They scour the planes for old tomes,

rumors, and scrolls. When they  nd a truename or truename

component, they add it to the Lexicon of Namesa de ni-

tive and invaluable collection of truenames.

JOINING THE COLLECTORS

Anyone with passing interest in truenames can  nd a place

among the Collectors of the Lexicon. Most collectors are true-

namers, though wizards, clerics, and monks also turn to the

Collectors if they are committed to the organizations purpose

or if they hope to gain something from the relationship.

Entry Requirements

Skills: Knowledge (history) 3 ranks, Truespeak 5 ranks

Feat: Skill Focus (Truespeak)

Though all Collectors work for the same ends, the group

features a variety of different roles. Diviners and some clerics

locate various treatises on truenaming, using spells such as

contact other plane, divination, and locate object to track down

rare tomes. Rogues in ltrate protected sanctuaries to borrow

or otherwise steal the information, while truenamers bring

to bear their uncanny skill with truename magic to learn and

apply the knowledge of the uncovered names to the bene t

of the larger organization.

New  Collector  candidates  must  develop  a  modicum  of

pro ciency  with  the  Truespeak  skill.  The  organization

expects  candidates  to  master  several  phrases  to  be  useful.

Developing other skills, such as advancing magical skills, is

also a bonus.

COLLECTOR BENEFITS

Being  a  member  of  the  Collectors  provides  access  to  dis-

counted goods and stores of information.

The Collectors have a diverse and well-funded constitu-

ency, so the organization charges its members 75% of the list

price for any magic item purchased directly from the group.

In addition, the Collectors pay a bounty on newly discovered

collections  of  truename  lore,  usually  50%  of  its  value,  but

sometimes up to 75%.

270

Being a Collector grants access to the hundreds of volumes

the organization has have at its disposal. A character using

a Collector library as a resource gains a +1d4 circumstance

bonus on associated Knowledge checks.

PLAYING A COLLECTOR

Everything revolves around the words, all wordsbig words,

little words, powerful words. Your job is to  nd them so your

companions in the Collectors can use them. You wouldnt be

doing this if you didnt already have a love of language, but

who knew the power to be held in names?

The Collectors gave you a chance to play with names and

words, to track down an elusive noun, couple it with a power-

ful verb, and have a little fun along the way. Each time you go

out to  nd a name, its both familiar and new. Youve done it

dozens of times, but each time, you face new challenges,

new threats, and of course, new words.

COMBAT

Collectors make extensive use of the Truespeak skill,

bringing to bear an impressive arsenal of truename

effects. In all, Collectors engage in defensive battles,

 ghting just long enough to spirit away the lore they

acquired or to just simply survive to make another

attempt at taking the information later. Those mem-

bers who are not truenamers use hit-and-run tactics to

allow  truenamers,  and  other  important  members,  to

make a quick escape.

When they must  ght, Collectors have a good mix

of  members,  often  using  two  or  more  monks,  a

rogue,  and  a  truenamer  to  anchor  a  unit.  One

monk always pairs with a rogue to  ank a foe and

enable the rogue to make use of sneak attacks. The

other monk protects the truenamer while he uses

Truespeak to attack the remaining foes.

In larger con icts, truenamer Collectors  ght in

pairs, while monks and rogues team up to elimi-

nate heavy hitters. Spellcasters on the Collectors side favor

defensive spells to protect the truenamers while providing

en lading  re to protect the melee combatants.

ADVANCEMENT

The  Collectors  are  an  open  society,  welcoming  any  who

would  assist  them  in  acquiring  new  secrets  of  truename

magic. It doesnt matter if youre a full-blown truenamer or

just a dabblerthey will take you. Of course, they dont take

fools, saboteurs, or traitors, so they put you through a care-

ful screening process to assess your talents with Truespeak.

Overseeing these examinations is a Speaker, a high-ranking

member within the group. If he  nds you worthy, he spon-

sors your membership.

As  a  member,  you  gain  the  chain  of  knowledge,  a   ne

mithral necklace (worth about 500 gp) carved with illumian

sigils (see Races of Destiny, page 53). The chain itself is a symbol

of your loyalty and commitment to the organizationselling

the chain is an act of betrayal, and the Collectors forever after

see you as an enemy. As a member, you are expected to go on

missions, each more dif cult than the last, to recover more

truename lore to add to the ever growing Lexicon.

Being a part of the Collectors necessitates an understand-

ing of Truespeak. Even if you dont advance in the truenamer

class, you should still devote ranks to the Truespeak skill.

Dont neglect movement skills; high ranks in Climb, Jump,

and  Swim  allow  you  to  access  well-protected  lore  held  in

hard-to-reach places. Invest in magic items that conceal you,

aid in movement, and augment your Truespeak abilities.

MISSIONS

The  Collectors  send  operatives  to  follow  up  on  leads  and

rumors  of  new  sources  of  truename  magic.  At  low  levels,

much of what you do is investigate these leads, tracking

down loose bits of legend to locate a particularly

useful tome, talking with contacts, sympathizers,

and other agents who work on behalf of the orga-

nization. As you gain levels and prove yourself,

the leaders ask you to undertake dangerous mis-

sions to retrieve texts containing various truenames.

The more success you have, the greater your prestige

and access to the organizations combined lore.

RESPONSIBILITIES

Members are expected to serve the interests of the

organization  rst, to embark on at least four mis-

sions a year, and to donate 10% of their treasure to

the cause.

COLLECTORS IN THE WORLD

Good masters, the Collectors. Sure, when it comes right

down to it, theyre thieves . . . but then, who isnt?

Lorgoal Habsnath, Collector informant

This  organization  is  a  useful  mechanism  for

introducing truenames into an ongoing campaign.

Perhaps  the  PCs  recovered  a  wizards  spellbook  that  also

contains  important  truename  elements  the  Collectors

want. The truenamers might try to purchase the spellbook

or maybe even steal it. The Collectors could also serve as a

source of information. As sages, they are without peer, well

versed in a variety of subjects given their broad exposure to

many different kinds of information. PCs can contact them

for a variety of reasons, from looking for command words to

activate magic items or  nding the truename of a dangerous

nemesis.

ORGANIZATION

A group of illumian truenamers abandoned their peoples

way of life to develop a deeper understanding of their origins.

To achieve their ends, they established a group to develop

a  master  language,  a  lexicon  of  truenames.  Having  access

to these words enables Collectors to draw upon an incred-

ible resource and be the uncontested masters of truename

magic.

271

Leadership in the Collectors is closed to all but illumians,

though  they  offer  membership  to  characters  of  any  race.

These  members  oversee  missions,  serve  as  advisors  to  the

governing  council,  and  manage  the  treasury  and  other

administrative departments.

The reason for the exclusion of other races from the highest

ranks inside the group is that the illumian founders believed

in a fundamental link between their sigils and Truespeech.

Though the Cabals denied any connection, early illumians

rejected the beliefs of their people, setting out to recover as

many  names  as  they  could  and  complete  an  authoritative

source of Truespeech. Other races cannot understand the

importance of their mission, and so the council conceals its

motives behind a faade of commitment to the study and

furtherance of truenaming.

NPC REACTIONS

Most see collectors as just another fringe group of spellcast-

ers, driven by some esoteric need to hoard old and boring

books.  However,  because  the  Collectors  steal  as  often  as

they  buy,  many  scholars  and  wizard  are  suspicious,  even

unfriendly,  toward  the  group,  and  rebuff  dealing  with  its

members. Truenamers, on the other hand, see the Collec-

tors as a useful resource, so are often friendly. A truenamer

who has been the victim of a Collector theft is hostile and

attacks on sight.

COLLECTOR LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (history) can research

the Collectors to learn more about them. When a character

makes a skill check, read or paraphrase the following, includ-

ing the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: If you have a strange book, check with the Collec-

tors  rst. They pay premium prices.

DC 15: The Collectors are not to be trusted. If you wont

sell something they want, they will just take it from you.

DC 20: Collectors are only interested in books containing

Truespeech; they dont care one whit about spellbooks.

A successful DC 20 Gather Information check will reveal

if Collectors are present in any given community.

COLLECTORS IN THE GAME

Collectors are always on the look out for new truenames and

new  information  about  Truespeech,  so  Collector  PCs  are

easy to incorporate into an ongoing campaign. The Collector

can periodically meet with the leaders in the organization

to  exchange  information  or  to  turn  over  collected  works

useful to the group.

If one of your PCs is a Collector, make sure you include

plenty of hooks and leads for adventures that deal with the

goals and motives of the organization. Provide clues to the

location of certain manuscripts or include truenames as part

of  an  encounters  treasure.  At  higher  levels,  the  character

might have more responsibilities to the organization, perhaps

even making decisions that affect the entire group. The PC

still adventures, though she should at least be tangentially

connected to the organizations larger goals.

ADAPTATION

Collectors  need  not  be  connected  to  truename  magic.

Instead,  they  could  be  after  ancient  arcane  lore.  In  the

EBERRON setting, this group could be a sect of the Arcane

Congress, searching the face of Eberron for insight into the

magic of different eras, possibly even looking into the calam-

ity that created the Mournland. In the FORGOTTEN REALMS

setting, the Collectors might be an outgrowth of the Red

Wizards who saw power in truename magic and therefore

acquire any information regarding Truespeech that they can

get their hands on.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

If the PCs encounter a Collector in the middle of an adven-

ture, the Collector is likely to be on the same trail as they

arehunting for the lost scrap of information. To make the

most use of the Collectors, have the Collector suspect the

PCs have something important in their possession pivotal

to a particular phrase in Truespeech (regardless of whether

it is or is not). The Collector might approach the characters

and be willing to pay for the object. If they rebuff him, hes

guaranteed to come back later and attempt to steal it.

EL 6: Prekish is a perfect agent for the Collectors. Aware

of the inner circles goals, hes committed to  nding a link

between  Truespeech  and  the  illumian  sigils.  He  steals,

bribes, or kills to get what he wants. Use him as a continuing

adversary and foil for the PCs.

various  kingdoms  interact.  Once  you  join  the  Kingmak-

ers,  you  are  assigned  to  an  advisor,  usually  an  established

member, and assist her in the development of young aristo-

crats, learning how to guide without lecturing, how to teach

and instill the lessons of just rule without preaching. When

adequately prepared, you are free to enter the world in search

of your own king.

KINGMAKERS

We seek the true monarch. Through his justice, mankind shall

prosper.

Religard, Philosopher

The Kingmakers are a group of truenamers and philosophers

who exist to form the ultimate government. They hope to

 nd a person worthy, in their eyes, to establish a new law,

one that unites the idea of just government with those that

currently exist. This person, they believe, will rule as a phi-

losopher-king and found the perfect system of rule. Under

his  benevolent  guidance,  all  suffering,  war,  and  calamity

will end.

As  adventurers,  kingmakers  often  secretly  watch  those

whom the organization thinks have the potential to be true

rulers. PCs who are Kingmakers might be assigned to keep

a young princess safe or rescue a prince whos been captured

in  battle.  Its  possible  the  Kingmakers  might  secretly  be

watching one or more of the PCs, ready to provide assistance

when things look dire, or perhaps subtly testing them with

periodic challenges to see if theyre truly worthy.

JOINING THE KINGMAKERS

Being a kingmaker requires a logical mind, an appreciation

for order, and dedication to the ideals set forth by their found-

ers. Most kingmakers are lawful truenamers, but their ranks

include monks, paladins, wizards, and clerics.

Entry Requirements

Alignment: Any lawful

Skills: Knowledge (nobility and royalty) 6 ranks, Truespeak

6 ranks

KINGMAKER BENEFITS

The Kingmakers are a wealthy and privileged organization,

recognized by the lords of many lands as sources of excellent

and honest advice. As a result, Kingmakers must do their part

to  ensure  that  the  reputation  of  the  organization  remains

intact while carefully furthering their agenda.

Kingmakers with a position in a nobles court receive a

stipend of 100 gp per month. Those not serving a noble or

other prospect in particular receive 50 gp per month from

their organization until such time that they enter a lord or

ladys service. The organization expects the money to keep

the  kingmakers  at  an  acceptable  comfort  level,  providing

adequate  funds  for  food  and  clothing  appropriate  to  their

station.

The  kingmakers  keep  extensive  records  on  lineages  of

the  various  noble  families.  Kingmakers  who  access  this

information receive a +4 bonus on Knowledge (nobility and

royalty) checks. In addition, wizards and clerics in service

to the Kingmakers provide free divination spells as long as

they relate to the particular noble a character serves.

Since many lands recognize the wisdom of the Kingmak-

ers, few lords refuse members of the group from their courts.

Kingmakers can immediately gain an audience with nobles

who  are  aware  of  the  organization.  Almost  every  noble

would like Kingmaker help, and hopes for the imprimatur

of worthiness that the Kingmakers can provide.

When working with a particular aristocrat, a Kingmaker

usually  gains  a  title  equivalent  to  a  count  (or  the  lands

equivalent). In some cases, these titles come with lands and

perhaps even a house, though not always (it depends on the

nations wealth and available lands).

PLAYING A KINGMAKER

Truenamers lead the Kingmakers, guiding the members

toward the actualization of their mission. Wizardsoften

divinersand  clerics  use  divination  spells  to  follow

bloodlines  and  carefully  guide  prospective  rulers  toward

the philosophy underpinning their organization. Combat-

oriented characters, such as monks and paladins, instruct

young aristocrats in the battle, while teaching them to apply

the discipline learned through combat forms toward their

lives as leaders.

To join the Kingmakers, you need an understanding of

the theories of Truespeech, represented by some pro ciency

with the Truespeak skill. You also need to be familiar with

noble bloodlines and the relationship between various noble

houses within particular nations while being aware of how

You have access to the inner chambers of the most important

people in the land. You have a rulers ear and can in uence

her actions, guiding her to become a better monarch. Even

with this great power, you are never tempted to exploit the

relationship you have with your liege to attain power, wealth,

and  status,  for  these  are  not  your  goals.  Rather,  you  want

all people to live well. To achieve this end, you must  nd a

proper leader.

It was a great honor to be accepted by the Kingmakers.

You spent years researching genealogies and the language of

Truespeech, all to gain a place among those you spent your

life idolizing. Now that youre here, the prestige and glory

has  worn  off  and  the  tedium  of  dealing  with  ungrateful

barons,  snot-nosed  lordlings,  and  brat  princesses  takes  its

273

toll. Still, the vision of a better world impels you, giving you

the patience to persevere.

COMBAT

You are not necessarily a warrioryou are an advisor and

an agent. You leave battles to those trained to  ght them.

Let the court wizard deal with the conjured demon and the

guards handle the unruly guest. Your duty is to guide your

assigned noble to reach his potentialwhether that potential

is met on the battle eld or in the halls of power. Of course,

should the guardians fail, you are willing to sacri ce every-

thingyour life if need beto protect your charge.

During an attack, your  rst objective is to make certain

your charge is safe. You direct your allies to the best posi-

tions  to  keep  the  noble  safe  from  harm.  Keep  abreast  of

developments in combat. Should an opening appear in the

lines of defenses, you can be sure an assassin will try to take

advantage of it.

ADVANCEMENT

You thought you knew everything there was to know about

the  business  of  politics,  kings,  and  law.  How  foolish  you

were. Soon after acceptance, you began the gauntlet (what

the Kingmakers call initial training). Every day, your instruc-

tors expected you to recite the family trees of all the major

families  relating  to  your  upcoming  assignment,  describe

the  lines  of  succession,  and  detail  how  the  law  applies  to

the aristocracy. But thats not all. Once you prove you have

the basics down, your advisor starts work on the intricacies

of Truespeech and how it applies to heady concepts such as

justice, order, law, and honor. You have to exhibit mastery of

these theories before they send you to your charge. Failure on

your part during the gauntlet means losing your membership

in the Kingmakers altogether.

Once  you  graduate,  you  move  on  to  your  assignment.

Though you know better, it seems as if this spoiled brat could

never  possibly  be  of  any  importance  to  the  Kingmakers.

The child (theyre always children) pays no attention to you,

ignores  your  lessons,  and  pretty  much  refutes  everything

you say. In time though, your charge matures and turns to

you as a trusted friend and con dant.

Part of what it means to work in the court of a lord is to be

aware of intrigues and developments before they occur. Dont

shirk your Knowledge (nobility and royalty) skill. The more

you know, the better prepared you are for the unexpected.

Bluff and Diplomacy are also vital skills for your job, and

when lying and friendly conversation fail, its good to have a

few ranks in Intimidate as well. Even with all the importance

on interpersonal skills, Truespeak is your most important

skill. High ranks and continued development in truename

magic allow you to protect your charge even when the guards,

court wizard, and all other safeguards fail.

MISSIONS

It would seem Kingmakers spend all their days following

their assignments, lecturing, advising, watching, and under-

taking a slew of other mundane matters. This is only part of

being a Kingmaker. Often you have to get your hands dirty.

You  might  have  to  follow  up  on  a  lead  about  a  particular

conspiracy or  nd a cure for a poison that somehow slipped

past you and now threatens your pupil. As the young lord

grows into his position, you might be a part of a delegation

to  another  nation,  perhaps  serving  as  an  envoy  or  maybe

even a spy.

KINGMAKERS IN THE WORLD

Honestly?  I  dont  trust  them.  Kingmakers  serve  far  too  many

masters for any one of them to be loyal to my son.

Duke Harold IV

A  Kingmaker  is  useful  in  many  ways  in  your  campaign.

She can serve as an NPC advisor to noble-born PCs or as a

counselor to an important and in uential lord. A Kingmaker

might serve as a portal to gaining a particular lords ear, or as

a barrier, screening access and preventing anyone she does

not trust from contaminating her charge. Whether as ally

or nemesis, a Kingmaker is a perfect addition for any game

featuring both truename magic and the courts of nobles.

ORGANIZATION

The Kingmakers work closely together to manage bloodlines

to produce the ultimate ruler. All members report to their

advisorsrepresentatives  of  the  larger  body  that  dictates

what  the  group  doesbut  the  sheer  variety  of  nations,

nobles, and bloodlines occasionally creates internal tension

as members advising one assignment come into con ict with

other members and their charges.

Kingmakers rarely meet a member of the organizations

ruling body. They are so remote and removed from the agents

that many Kingmakers wonder if this leadership even exists,

despite assurances to the contrary by the advisors. Doubters

exist even among these higher-ranking agents, for no advisor

has ever met a founder, either.

Legend holds the Kingmakers were founded in response

to calamity resulting from the ambition of bellicose lords.

Having witnessed the destruction of all the nations involved

in an ancient war, a group of philosophers, theologians, and

prominent leaders met to  nd a way to prevent such con icts

from occurring again. The scholars studied the lore of their

faiths and brilliant minds of previous generations, but it was

to no avail. They could not agree on a solution, for it seemed

in humanitys nature to argue and squabble. Disgusted with

themselves and their failures, the thinkers readied to leave,

when one among them spoke. The problem lies in achieving

a consensus. True decision can only come from one voice.

Naturally, the rest argued, claiming what the speaker pro-

posed was tyranny, an injustice of the worst kind. But others

saw value in this ideal, and so they concluded that what the

world needed was a uniting  gure, an individual who could

draw all the civilized nations together and bind its various

outlooks under one rule of law. The question then became

274

how to achieve this end. As a result of these meetings, the

Kingmakers were founded.

Over the following centuries, the Kingmakers determined

the  only  way  to  avoid  handing  the  world  over  to  a  tyrant

would be for this ruler to embody the ideals of virtue, justice,

benevolence, and compassion. Not satis ed with character

traits,  they  desired  a  monarch  who  would  literally  re ect

these ideals. The languages of the Material Plane, they felt,

re ected only a corrupted form of these traitsthe words

did  not  embody  the  absolute  purity  of  the  concepts.  As  a

result,  they  embraced  the  use  of  truename  magic  to  aid

their goals. The founders believed that by enhancing their

charges, magically feeding them these concepts in the true,

most pure language in the multiverse, they could eventually

achieve the ruler who embodied the ideas as purely as the

words in Truespeech.

The  Kingmakers  established  themselves

as advisors to the noble-blooded descendants

from  the  earliest  families,  serving  as  advisors

and  consultants,  teachers  and  con dants.

Through  their  position,  they  could  arrange

marriages and alliances, all to serve the greater

end of achieving a true and lasting peace.

Yet  as  the  founders  realized,  dissent  and

con ict are human traits, and not much can be

done to quell human instinct. So the Kingmak-

ers continue on as they always have, receiving

instructions from the inner circle, whoever

they might be, through the mouthpieces of

the advisors. Theories as to who really guides

the organization abound. Apologists claim the

council  operates  in  secret  to  protect  its  leaders

identities, while detractors suggest that no one is at

the helm, or that whatever sends the Kingmakers

their orders is some dark force using the group for

its own malevolent agenda.

KINGMAKER LORE

Characters with ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty)

can  research  the  Kingmakers  to  learn  more  about  them.

When  a  character  makes  a  check,  read  or  paraphrase  the

following, including the information from lower DCs.

DC 10: Kingmakers are nothing more than highly placed

advisors with delusions of grandeur.

DC 15: Peace, harmony, and the true expression of human

ideals all motivate the Kingmakers, but at what price?

DC 20: The Kingmakers true objective is to place a mon-

arch of their choosing on the throne to govern the world.

DC  30:  The  Kingmakers  receive  their  orders  from  an

unknown source. Not even their senior members have ever

met one of the groups leaders.

KINGMAKERS

IN THE GAME

Rarely do PCs have the opportunity or cause to

interact directly with the nobility, and so you

will  nd adding the Kingmakers to your game

is easy. Since few PCs are actually nobles, they

probably never knew the Kingmakers existed.

Furthermore,  maybe  the  Kingmakers  have

just assigned one of their own to the court of

a local lord.

Player characters who join this organization

probably have an interest in intrigues and poli-

tics. If a PC joins the Kingmakers, be sure to

allow that character opportunities to exercise

his status.

Alternatively, the Kingmakers make useful

cavalry if the PCs wind up over their heads. They

might  have  been  watching  the  PCs  for  months  or

years, and they arent willing to let the characters

potential as future rulers be quashed by the tempo-

rary dif culty or danger they face today.

NPC REACTIONS

People perceive Kingmakers with a mixed sense of respect

tempered  with  distrust.  Naturally,  the  lord  assigned  to  a

Kingmaker is friendly or even helpful, but the same is not

always true with the other members of the court, who are

typically indifferent. Such access as Kingmakers enjoy also

breeds envy, so they must endure unfriendly stares and open

hostility. Common folk see Kingmakers as a force for good,

 ghting tyranny and championing peace, and are usually

friendly.

The  Kingmakers  opposition  consists  largely  of  those

who stand in opposition to their goals. This group includes

those from uncivilized and warlike lands, especially savage

humanoids such as orcs and goblinoid tribes. Such characters

are always hostile. Strangely, elves and other free spirits tend

to oppose Kingmakers as well, being unfriendly and refusing

to negotiate in their presence.

ADAPTATION

Though the underlying assumption is that the Kingmakers

are  a  human  organization,  founded  to  advance  humanity,

theres no reason this same organization couldnt also serve

among other races, such as the dwarves, but any lawful soci-

ety will do. You can also center the group in a single nation

or in a cluster of small nations or city-states. In this case, the

Kingmaker  becomes  a  uni er,  perhaps  striving  to  gather

the various power groups to defend against an approaching

horde or magical threat.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER

Kingmakers serve in the courts of lords rather than in the

heart of a dungeon or in the trackless wilderness. When they

oppose the PCs, they employ a number of tools to contain or

neutralize their enemies, creating diversions, misdirecting

their efforts with well-placed red herrings. An enemy King-

maker is the spider in the center of the web, rarely acting

overtly and dealing with threats from afar.

VAULT OF

CATHARANDAMUS (EL 2)

A few crumbling walls, eroded statues and columns, and the

remnants of a few roads are all that remain of the Palace of

Princess Argent. Years ago, a foul and alien sorcerer named

Arik imprisoned the lady and her beloved champion beyond

time  and  space,  and  cursed  the  place.  Serving  the  dark

spellcaster was a despicable man named Catharandamus who

worked to bring his master into the Material Plane. Though

a group of bold adventurers thwarted the curse, freed the

princess and her knight, and put an end to the spellcasters

evil, the palace never recovered, nor did the lands around it.

Over the decades since, earthquakes, rains, and time took

their  toll,  leaving  little  but  a  pile  of  rubble  and  a  passage

into a hill on which the palace once stood as evidence that

anything ever stood here.

Little remains of interest to most travelers, but the site still

holds many of the palaces original guardians, to say nothing

of the creatures claiming dry sections of corridor and old

ruins. On occasion, some group of explorers examines the

place, explores a bit, but soon gives up after  nding nothing

for its efforts. However, something does remainsomething

valuable to those with an interest in truenames.

Catharandamus knew the power of names. A dabbler in

truenaming  himself,  he  became  paranoid  about  his  own,

fearing exploitation at the hands of his enemies should his

name fall into their hands. In the dark days before the heroes

liberated Argent, Catharandamus stored some of his notes

inside a hidden vault to wait him while he worked to release

Arik. But before he could bring his master through, he fell

to the swords and spells of Argents liberators.

Catharandamus did not rest for long; Arik punished him

for his failures. Arik animated the dead cleric, condemning

him to live a pathetic existence as a ghoul until such time as

someone consigned him to oblivion. For years, Catharanda-

mus haunted the palaces ruins, hiding from large parties and

preying on small ones to feed his insatiable hunger. Through

it all, he maintained his fear about his name, so he spends

most of his time in the vault with his notes, committed to

protecting them for eternity.

The walls and  oor inside the hill are all cracked masonry

on top of hewn stone. All locations are dark unless otherwise

speci ed. The air, while stale, is clean and breathable. Marked

doors are all wooden and unlocked. Secret doors are stone

and locked (Open Lock DC 28).

276

1. ENTRANCE HALL

From  the  twisted  gate  rusting  on  the  ground,  its  clear  that  a

portcullis once barred access to this area. Up to a few feet inside

the mouth of the tunnel, grass reclaims the floor. About 40 feet

in, on either side of the far wall, stand two more twisted gates,

snapped and curled as if some terror bulled its way through them.

Beyond,  corridors  extend  off  into  darkness.  Old  wooden  doors

stand on either side of this room.

The doors are in bad shape, warped and split, but they remain

standing thanks to sturdy hinges. Flagstones cover the  oor,

though  few  are  whole;  old  roots  and  the  earthquake  that

opened a rift inside the hill (see area 12) shattered the rest.

A character looking for tracks who succeeds on a DC 20

Survival check notes a single set of tracks heading south out

through the southeastern gate. These tracks belong to Cathar-

andamus, but a successful Survival check only reveals that

they were made within the last day by a humanoid-shaped

creature. Otherwise the room is quiet and empty.

PCs who succeed on a DC 20 Search check in this area

discover a false section of wall, cunningly concealed by the

palace builders decades ago. Depressing a pressure plate near

the edge of the door causes the door to slide back to reveal a

small room (area 4).

1A. DEAD END

This  short  corridor  ends  abruptly  overlooking  a  huge  rift

inside the hill. The lower reaches of the chasm are  lled with

inky darkness, emanating up from the Plane of Shadow. For

more details on the chasm, see area 12.

2. EAST ROOM (EL 2)

Old rats nests and strands of spiderwebs fill this room. Hanging

from  the  webs  are  small  cocoons  holding,  perhaps,  dead  rats.

Worse,  hanging  in  one  corner  is  a  big  ball  of  spider  silk  and

something seems to be struggling inside. On the far wall, a broken

lever juts out of a slot, the handle long since lost.

The lever once opened and shut the front portcullis. One

round after the PCs open the door, the big ball of silk bursts,

spilling out a swarm of spiders that want nothing more than

to feast on the PCs. On the next round, a Medium monstrous

spiderthe motherunfolds from the ceiling and joins her

young. The spiders pursue  eeing PCs through the dungeon,

but not outside it.

If the PCs defeat the spiders and search the room, they  nd

a larger bundle of spider silk with a successful DC 15 Search

check. Inside is the corpse of an adventurer. Most of his gear

rotted away long ago, but a few items of interest remain. On

Secrets of truenaming are rumored to be hidden within the ruined Vault of Catharandamus

3. WEST ROOM (EL 2)

This dusty room holds little more than bones. On the far wall is

a broken lever, jutting out from a dark slot. Four lengths of chain

hang from a ring spiked in the wall about six feet from the floor.

Beneath them is a pile of broken bones.

If the PCs enter this room, the heap of bones stirs, revealing

the inhabitant: the skeleton of a long-dead ogre. The skeleton

rises up from the  oor and attacks.

A thick layer of dust blankets everything in this chamber.

Inside are two masterwork chain shirts, a light steel shield, a

longsword, a light crossbow, and a case with 10 masterwork

bolts. Otherwise, this room is empty.

5. GREEN SLIME (EL 4)

The door to this room is open. Inside, a colony of green slime

(DMG 76) grows on the ceiling. Dollops of goo stand on the

 oor,  quivering  as  they  digest  a  few  hapless  rats.  The  far

left-hand corner of the room holds the remains of a former

adventurer, now green slime food. His +1 longsword remains

miraculously intact and still gripped in the corpses rotting

hand.

6. STOREROOM

This small room features dusty shelves along the south and

west walls. The remains of wooden crates now serve as rats

nests, evidenced by the holes in bases of the boxes. If the PCs

disturb the crates, a swarm of rats boils out of the nests. This

room is otherwise empty.

Rat Swarm (1): hp 9; MM 239.

7. ANTEROOM (EL 3)

The door to this room is locked with a poor and rusty lock

(Open Lock DC 20). Inside is a semicircular room with an

alcove in the center of the east wall. Two statues, seemingly

created  from  solid  crystal,   ll  the  alcove.  Beyond  them

stands  an  old  door.  Another  door  stands  closed  on  the

southwestern wall.

The statues are actually guardian constructs. They attack

as soon as anyone enters the room.

8. FOUNTAIN ROOM (EL 1)

Against the east wall stands a small fountain. Long dried up, filth

and dust coat the bottom. Torn tapestries hang along the north

wall,  and  to  the  south,  a  few  scraps  of  colored  fabric  suggest

another once hung there. The floor is filthy, consisting of a mixture

of grit, dried mud, excrement, and tufts of fur. A door stands closed

on the northeastern corner of this otherwise empty room.

The damage to the tapestries is too extensive for the likes of

a mending spell to repair. The northern door opens toward

the PCs, triggering a crude trap. Tied to the handle is a string

connected  to  a  crossbow  trigger.  When  opened,  the  door

pulls the string and triggers the trap.

Crude Crossbow Trap: CR 1; mechanical; touch trigger

(pulling the door); manual reset; Atk +10 ranged (1d8/1920,

9. COLLAPSED HALL

This short hall runs to the north where it ends in a rubble-filled

corridor.  Situated  right  in  front  of  the  door  to  the  south  is  a

crossbow mounted on a tripod. A case with nine bolts lies on the

floor next to it. Though dirty, the hall is empty.

A  character  looking  for  tracks  who  succeeds  on  a  DC  15

Survival  check  notes  footprints  in  the  dust  all  over  this

area. As with area 1, a successful check reveals they belong

to one humanoid-shaped creature, and that they were made

within the last day.

A  secret  door  is  concealed  in  the  east  wall.  A  character

who succeeds on a DC 20 Search check  nds a button that

opens the door. If the PCs trigger the trap (see area 8), have

Catharandamus make a DC 12 Listen check. If successful,

it hides behind a statue and attacks the  rst character who

enters the room.

279

10. THE VAULT (EL 4)

This room holds four old and chipped statues. Each is of the same

human girl, arranged in different poses. One kneels reaching out

as  if  to  pet  a  small  animal,  another  skips,  the  third  has  her

stretching  her  arms  over  her  head,  while  the  last  depicts  her

curtseying. The room stinks of ash and fire along with darker and

more sinister smells. Bonesmostly rat but some humanoid

form a pile underneath the statue of the girl kneeling, making it

seem like she is reaching for a bone.

This is the lair of the despicable creature Catharandamus.

Hidden  here,  it  fears  someone  will  discover  its  truename

and thereby gain power over it. Worse, it has been cursed

with undeath, so it suffers from an insatiable hunger. If it

succeeded  on  the  Listen  check  (see  area  9),  it  attacks  the

lead character from behind the nearest statue. Otherwise,

it shrieks with surprise and hastily begins to cast desecrate

before attacking.

11. LIBRARY

Shelves  cover  all  four  walls  of  this  room,  though  all  are

empty,  their  contents  having  long  given  way  to  rats  and

worms. A few tables and chairs are arranged haphazardly,

some tipped over, others broken. Also, blobs of wax and a

few broken candles cover the  oor. A  lthy  replace stands

against the south wall, though the bricks and debris inside

suggest the chimney collapsed. A door stands in the center

of the west wall.

Characters examining the shelves who make a successful

DC 20 Search check uncover a short treatise on truenaming

that includes the personal truenames of a chain devil, a babau

demon, and a succubus. This text is worth 500 gp to someone

interested in truenames (such as a member of the Collectors

of the Lexicon; see page 270). Otherwise, this room is empty.

The door on the opposite wall opens to a huge rift created by

an earthquake that leveled most of the palace. A character

who succeeds on a DC 10 Listen check at the door hears the

sound of whistling wind.

12. THE RIFT (EL 5)

Beyond the door is a huge rift that travels north and south for

hundreds  of  feet.  Seemingly  bottomless,  a  cold  wind  blows  up

from  below.  Worse,  inky  darkness  clouds  all  vision,  turning  to

absolute blackness just a few feet below the door.

The rift is a planar tear, a place where the Plane of Shadow

touches  the  Material  Plane.  This  rift  connects  to  Night-

crawler Chasm. If one were to fall down the rift, he would fall

through into the Plane of Shadow, falling up Nightcrawler

Chasm  until  the  pull  of  gravity  changes  his  momentum,

causing him to fall back into the Rift. Thanks to the unusual

nature of the place, a falling character never slows, and unless

some  outside  force  acts  on  him,  he  falls  forever,  slipping

between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane. The

shadowbats roosting at Nightwatch know this and occasion-

ally swoop down for a quick meal.

Lurking  on  the  walls  just  out  of  sight  are  three  small

monstrous shadow spiders from the Plane of Shadow that

crossed over in hopes of better hunting. Characters spending

more than 3 rounds exploring the rift attract the attention

of these horrors.

13. ISOLATED ROOM

The only way to reach this room is to somehow climb across

the  face  of  the  chasm  (DC  20  Climb  check).  The  original

purpose of this room is long forgotten, concealed now by

the heaps of rubble and debris that spilled down when the

earthquake  shook  the  palace.  A  thorough  search  of  the

rubble  uncovers  a  stash  of  453  gp,  a  dented  silver  chalice

studded with chalcedony stones worth 150 gp, and a scroll

of dimension door.

14. SANCTUARY

The door to this room is locked and requires a successful DC

20 Open Lock or DC 25 Strength check to open.

Inside is a square room, eerily preserved all these years,

containing a desk and chair, a pair of bookcases, and an ornate

candelabra with six fat purple candles. The desk drawers are

all empty, as are the shelves in the bookcases. The candelabra

is worth 120 gp and the candles are ordinary candles.

Catharandamus  discovered  this  door  was  locked  and

couldnt open it, so he left it alone. The PCs can rest here

without fear of being attacked.

15. SHATTERED SHRINE (EL 3)

The door to this room is open. Though the rooms original

function has been lost to time and the destruction wreaked

by the earthquake, it is now the lair of a particularly nasty

wererat named Corbus, who  ed to these tunnels when the

people of his village turned against him. He has an uneasy

truce with Catharandamus, and so long as Corbus refrains

from hunting in the ghouls territory, they get along.

This room is  lthy, even by wererat standards. Rubble and

debris mix with excrement and the remains of old meals.

Scraps of cloth, weaponry, and coins litter the place. If the

PCs stumble into the room, Corbus attacks. If reduced to

half hit points or less, he changes into his dire rat form and

scrambles down the side of the cliff until the PCs leave.

16. SUNDERED HALL

The corridor turns to the west, but after just a few feet, the

bottom  falls  away  into  the  dark  rift.  A  shadowy  darkness

 lls the chasm in all directions. Across the gap, the corridor

continues for a few more feet before ending in a cave-in. On

the opposite side are a few bones and broken weaponry. With

a search of the rubble (Search DC 20) a character can  nd a

SHRINE OF GATH-MAL

(EL 10)

In the ruins of an ancient city, its name long lost, stands a

single intact structure: the Shrine of Gath-Mal. All around

lie  crumbling  columns  and  the  collapsed  remains  of  the

citys past glory, its only testament to former greatness this

unusual shrine. Few scholars know much about the shrine,

though  many  truenamers  have  heard  legends  of  it.  These

stories state that an oracle dwells inside who can speak with

the gods, with an uncanny knack for divulging information

useful to users of truename magic.

Oddly,  though  she  is  an  icon  in  truename  lore,  Oracle

Gath-Mal is not herself a truenamer, nor are her attendants.

In fact, the only association that the Shrine has to truename

magic  is  that  Gath-Mal  is  skilled  at  plucking  elements  of

Truespeech from the ether. Worse, the oracle is a madwoman,

a relic of the distant past wallowing in the cause of her citys

death, and condemned to live for all time in the company of

mad creatures from beyond the realm of space and time.

The ruined city holding the shrine collapsed under the weight

of its own sin. The alienists who ruled this place frequently

touched a distant plane called the Far Realm in an effort to learn

the secrets of the universe. As a result of their meddling, the

citizens developed bizarre psionic powers, dabbled in forbidden

arts, and conjured terrifying horrors from this strange and mad-

dening plane. Eventually, the populace, in a case of mass insanity,

turned on itself. The citizens butchered one another to appease

whatever dark god lived beyond the realm of dreams. When

the carnage ended, all that remained of the citizens excesses

were the shrine and its oracle.

If the characters need to learn some piece of vital infor-

mation  for  the  campaign,  or  they  seek  to  uncover  a  new

Truespeech element, the Shrine of Gath-Mal can be a useful,

if not strange, adventure site. PCs who show respect for the

oracle  can  learn  what  they  wish,  usually  through  psionic

divination or contact other plane, for the price of the spell (see

page  129  of  the  Players  Handbook  for  pricing).  However,  a

show of disrespect causes the oracle and her minions to rise

against intruders, revealing the true horror laying beneath

the faade of an unusual, but seemingly harmless, diviner.

1. ENTRANCE (EL 10)

A short set of stairs leads up to a pair of carved wooden doors.

On the doors are reliefs of balls rotating around a fiery orb. Four

columns of white stone support a roof carved with the same dcor

as the doors.

A successful DC 12 Knowledge (architecture and engineer-

ing) check reveals that the columns dont actually support the

roof and arent even secured in place. If the PCs examine the

columns in detail and succeed on a DC 25 Search check, they

see faint and distorted lines that make the pillar resemble a

woman with a sword.

Astute characters might realize that the columns are actu-

ally creatures, caryatid columns that protect the shrine from

unwelcome  guests.  Any  attempt  to  break  down  the  doors

or deface the shrine causes the caryatid columns to change

282

forms  and  attack  the  characters.  Otherwise,  the  columns

ignore all visitors. For more information on these creatures,

see page 30 of Fiend Folio.

If  the  PCs  knock  on  the  doors,  an  attendant  opens  the

doors in 1d4 rounds. If the PCs try to enter uninvited, the

caryatid columns attack.

Break Weapon (Su) Whenever a creature strikes a caryatid

column with a melee weapon, the weapon must

succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or break and become

useless, dealing no damage to the column. A magic

weapon uses either the wielders save bonus or its own,

whichever is better.

Nonmagical ranged weapons automatically shatter

upon hitting a caryatid column, dealing no damage.

Magic ranged weapons receive a DC 13 Fortitude save

to resist this effect.

Column Form (Ex) A caryatid column can assume the form

of a column as a free action, once per round.

2. ORACLES FANE

Assuming the PCs knock  rst, an acolyte opens the doors and

welcomes them in a quavering voice, inviting them to enter.

The red-robed attendant leads them into a large hall, tiled in

marble with four columns of  ery energy that travel from

 oor to ceiling. Halls lead out from this central chamber to

the west, north, and east. Dominating the center of this room

is a pillared dais with three short steps leading up on all sides.

Overhead, the ceiling rises about 30 feet before ending in a

painted  dome  depicting  stars  on  a   eld  of  midnight  blue.

Though stunning, the scene is sinister, as if something dark

and insane lay amid the sparkling tapestry above.

The oracle Gath-Mal is as insane as she is grotesque

3. ORACLE (EL 12)

Situated on the dais is a great fat woman, covered in dirty rags.

Her drooling mouth is slack and full of rotting teeth. Her eyes roll

about in her head and weep a viscous yellow fluid, running lines

through  the  grime  on  her  face.  She  stares  up  at  the  dome

overhead, as if pondering the secrets therein. Queerly, centipedes

crawl all over her body, feasting on the cast off bits of food left by

careless attendants.

This is the oracle Gath-Mal, a powerful psion and diviner

driven to madness by the visions she has seen over the years.

She  never  speaks,  instead  communicating  telepathically.

When the attendant leads the PCs to the steps, he instructs

them to open their minds and accept the presence of the

oracle so she can divine their futures. Before she meets any

group, the oracle prepares by casting and manifesting some

defensive spells and powers.

Surrounding  this  grotesque  creature  are  nineteen  col-

umns,  each  carved  to  depict  some  horri c  otherworldly

creature. While intimidating, these columns are not crea-

tures, although a character who inspects them and succeeds

on a DC 25 Knowledge (the planes) check correctly identi-

 es the creatures in the column as wystes (see page 200 of

Monster Manual II).

If the PCs have come for information, the attendant stays

close,  protecting  the  oracle.  Characters  can  bene t  from

any spell or power she knows using pricing as described on

Table 78: Goods and Services (PH 128). They need not pay

in  gold;  the  oracle  accepts  items,  gems,  and  art  objects  of

equal value.

Should the PCs attack, the oracle manifests powers and

casts defensive spells until the rest of her attendants arrive

from area 5, which takes 1d3 rounds. Once the attendants

join  the   ght,  they  cast  off  their  cloaks,  revealing  their

monstrous forms. At least one attendant tries to grapple a

PC and force her into one of the pillars of quintessence (see

area 4). Once a combat begins in the shrine, the inhabitants

 ght to the death.

4. PILLARS OF QUINTESSENCE

(EL 6 OR 10)

Rising from  oor to ceiling are what seem to be columns of

pink liquid  ame. Though opaque, close examination (Search

DC 20) of these pillars reveals the presence of an enormous

shifting  worm-shape  swimming  through  the  ceiling  and

emerging again from the  oor. On the  oor and ceiling are

permanent gates to the Far Realm (see page 211 of Manual of the

Planes), a plane outside the Great Wheel cosmology and home

to horrors unimaginable. Streams of  ery acid spill out of the

gates, and swimming through them are terrible wystes.

Touching  a  column  deals  4d6  points  of  acid  damage.

Entering  a  column  deals  20d6  points  of  acid  damage  per

round.  Worse,  the  column  carries  an  immersed  character

up through the ceiling and into the Far Realm itself after

1  rounda  mind-shattering  experience  indeed.  A  casual

touch attracts the attention of the wyste contained inside it,

causing it to leave the pillar of  uid and attack. Otherwise,

the wystes are content to swim through the  uids of their

homeworld on their insane journey to nowhere.

For more information on wystes, see page 200 of Monster

Manual II.

Bite (Ex) If a wyste achieves a hold, it can attempt to bite

the grappled target on its next action with a successful

grapple check (it receives a +4 bonus on this grapple

check, as indicated above). If it hits, it automatically

deals the given damage each round until the grappled

target breaks the grapple, succeeds on an Escape Artist

check, or kills the wyste. It need not make more grapple

checks to deal this damage after the first check. If the

grapple check fails, it drops the creature it was

grappling, which falls prone in an adjacent square.

Improved Grab (Ex) If a wyste hits a Large or smaller

opponent with one or more tentacle attacks, it deals

tentacle damage and can start a grapple as a free action

without provoking an attack of opportunity. It receives a

+2 bonus on the grapple check for each tentacle that hit

beyond the first.

5. ORACLES ATTENDANTS (EL 38)

Each  wall,  except  the  southern  wall,  features  two  round

corridors leading to a sharp bend and ending in the private

chambers of one of the oracles attendants. One attendant

is always in area 2, seeing to visitors and the needs of the

oracle herself. Heavy hooded red robes completely conceal

them. Beneath, they are twisted caricatures of humans, being

pseudonatural humans drawn from the mad vistas of the Far

Realm. They attend the oracle because it is their mad duty. If

the oracle is threatened, the pillars disturbed, or if the PCs

force entry into the shrine, the attendants attack and  ght

to the death.

The cells keyed to this location are all identical. They are

 lthy places,  lled with bone fragments and rotting  esh.

Orange moss carpets the ceilings and slippery slime coats

everything. The air is putrid,  lled with the stench of decay.

In  the  center  of  each  room  is  a  pedestal  holding  a  basin

of  clean  water,  though  of  a  weirdly  bright  blue  color.  The

pedestals serve no purpose whatsoever.

To speak an areas truename (using the Lexicon of the

with a DC equal to 25 + 5 per level of the utterance. If

the area is a magical location, increase the DC by an

additional 5.

In the third paragraph of the Monk Abilities description

strike the mention of penalties for flurry of blows. The

class is intended to grant flurry of blows progression.

Errata Rule: Primary Sources

When you find a disagreement between two D&D rules

sources, unless an official errata file says otherwise, the

primary source is correct. One example of a

primary/secondary source is text taking precedence over

a table entry. An individual spell description takes

precedence when the short description in the beginning

of the spells chapter disagrees.

Table 12: Vestiges by Level indicates that Dahlver-Nar

has a special requirement. He does not.

Leraje allowed her pride to become her downfall. Leraje

gives her summoners an elfs eyesight, great skill with a

bow, and the ability to hide well.

The first paragraph of Savnoks description should read

as follows:

Once a servant of the gods, Savnok now grants his

it from the ether, the power to shift places with an ally,

and protection against piercing weapons.
