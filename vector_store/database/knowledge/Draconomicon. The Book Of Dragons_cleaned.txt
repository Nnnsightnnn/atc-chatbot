Introduction

The dragon reared, roaring, clawing at air

And belching fire, and began to lunge down

Upon Dydd, but the druid slashed into

Ashardalons heart, her scimitar cut

And the lifeblood began to spill. Then Dydd

Was slain, her heart wrested from her breast by

The dragons grasping jaws, swallowed, consumed

To sustain Ashardalons ebbing life

For a time. . . .

The Lay of Dydd

More than any other creature, dragons are a symbol of all

that is the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. From the savage

white to the majestic gold, dragons represent the greatest

perils adventurers face at any point in their careers, as well

as the greatest rewards they may hope to claim. From the

tiny  wyrmling  at  the  bottom  of  an  adventurers  very  first

dungeon to the colossal great wyrm he meets at the height

of his career, dragons are the ultimate climactic encounter:

a  brutal  and  memorable  fight  that  will  pay  off  in  riches

from the dragons hoard.

Dragons are creatures of myth, often described as the first

sentient  race  to  appear  on  a  world,  with  life  spans  that

stretch over hundreds of years. They symbolize the world

itself  and  embody  its  history,  and  the  oldest  dragons  are

repositories  of  vast  knowledge  and  ancient  secrets.  This

aspect of dragons makes them much more than just a chal-

lenging combat encounter: They are sages and oracles, fonts

of  wisdom  and  prophets  of  things  to  come.  Their  very

appearance can be an omen of good or ill fortune.

actions, their schemes, even their dreams are felt through-

out the world. From a wyrmling raiding herds of sheep to

the  mighty  Ashardalon  feasting  on  preincarnate  souls,

dragons  do  things  that  matter,  whether  on  a  small  local

scale or in the cosmic big picture. They are the embodi-

ment of fantasy itself.

That, in a nutshell, is the reason for this book. Dragons

are such a central part of the game that a rules reference

of  this  nature  is  an  essential  addition  to  any  campaign,

enhancing  the  excitement  of  draconic  encounters  for

players and Dungeon Masters alike. A DM will find infor-

mation here on the powers and tactics of dragons, as well

as a wealth of new feats, spells, magic items, and prestige

classes designed to make dragon encounters more interest-

ing, challenging, and unusual. In case the dragons already

described  in  the  Monster  Manual and  other  books  are  not

enough,  this  book  also  presents  a  variety  of  new  dragon-

related monsters of all types to include in the game. Players,

meanwhile,  can  unearth  dragonslaying  tactics  and  take

advantage of new feats and spells, magic items, and prestige

classes to make their characters the ultimate dragon slayers,

dragon riders, or even dragon servants.

Draconomicon is not just about the rules, tactics, and ecol-

ogy of dragons, however. The illustrations in this book are

intended to inspire a fresh sense of wonder and awe at the

creatures that make up such an important part of the D&D

game.  Dragons  are  rapacious,  arrogant,  and  deadlybut

they are also majestic, awesome, and magnificent. A renewed

sense  of  the  grandeur  of  dragons  might  not  have  as  con-

crete or noticeable an impact on your game as all the new

rules you will find in this book, but its influence will surely

be felt around your gaming table.

Perhaps  most  important,  dragons  are  a  reminder  that

the action of the D&D game takes place in a world of fan-

tasy,  wonder,  and  magic,  a  world  far  from  mundane  in

every  way.  Any  attempt  to  describe  them  as  little  more

than glorified lizards with wings and breath weapons is a

disservice, not only to dragons, but to the fantasy universe

of D&D and the wealth of legends, myths, and heroic sto-

ries  that  place  dragons  in  such  an  iconic  position  that

they had to be a part of the very name of the game. Dragons

are, by their very nature, epic forces in the world. Their

pqqqqrs

Let this book inspire you. Whether you use it to build

new draconic adversaries and exciting dragon lairs stocked

with legendary treasure, or to build a character who rides

a silver dragon into battle against the servants of Tiamat,

you are sure to find not just the rules you want, but the

wonder you need to make your game more fun. Dragons

are creatures of legend, and with this book you can be a

part of that legend. Retell it, relive it, reshape it in your

characters  or  your  campaigns  image.  Draconomicon will

show you how.

THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DRAGONS

In the D&D game, the term dragon encompasses a number

of different creatures, some of which bear little resemblance to

the great flying creatures with breath weapons that we commonly

think of as dragons.

For  the  most  part,  this  book  concerns  itself  with  the  ten

varieties  of  true  dragon  described  in  the  Monster  Manual

the five chromatic dragons (black, blue, green, red, white) and

the five metallic dragons (brass, bronze, copper, gold, silver).

True dragons are those creatures that become more powerful

as they grow older.

a complete list of all true dragons that have been presented in

official sources.

Other  creatures  of  the  dragon  type  that  do  not  advance

through age categories are referred to as lesser dragons (which

should  not  be  taken  to  mean  that  they  are  necessarily  less

formidable than true dragons).

The  three  kinds  of  lesser  dragon  described  in  the  Monster

Manual are  the  dragon  turtle,  the  pseudodragon,  and  the

wyvern. Chapter 4 of this book contains a number of descrip-

tions of other lesser dragons, and Appendix 2 lists every lesser

dragon that has been described in a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS rule-

book or accessory.

A number of other true dragons are described in Chapter 4

of this book. In addition, Appendix 2: Index of Dragons provides

wealth of material, from bards tales and ponderous

tomes  alike,  has  been  recorded  about  dragons.

Unfortunately  for  adventurers  planning  to  con-

front a dragon, most of that information is wrong.

The  opening  chapter  of  this  book  presents  the

truth about dragonstheir types, habits, physiology, and

worldview.

THE DRAGONS BODY

How can one imagine anything more magnificent than . . .  a

dragon, the paragon of creation?

Bheilorveilthion, red wyrm

Nothing but a bunch of vain, glorified flying reptiles, if you

ask me!

Hatredymaes, androsphinx

At first glance, a true dragon resembles a reptile. It has a

muscular  body,  a  long,  thick  neck,  a  horned  or  frilled

head with a toothy mouth, and a sinuous tail. The crea-

ture walks on four powerful legs with clawed feet, and it

flies  using  its  vast,  batlike  wings.  Heavy  scales  cover  a

dragon  from  the  tip  of  its  tail  to  end  of  its  snout.  As

youll  see  from  the  details  to  come,  however,  that  first

glance  doesnt  begin  to  tell  the  whole  story  about  the

nature of dragons.

EXTERNAL ANATOMY

Despite its scales and wings, a dragons body has fea-

tures that seem more feline than reptilian. Refer to

the illustrations on the next few pages as you read on.

Like a cats eye, a dragons eye has a comparatively

large  iris  with  a  vertical  pupil.  This  arrangement

allows the pupil to open extremely wide and admit

much more light than a human eye can.

The sclera, or white, of a dragons eye is often

yellow, gold, green, orange, red, or silver, with an

iris of a darker, contrasting color.

To  a  casual  observer,  a  dragons  pupils  always

look like vertical slits. If one were to look very

closely into a dragons eye, however, one could

see a second iris and pupil within the first. The

dragon can shift and rotate this inner aperture

up  to  90  degrees,  so  that  the  inner  pupil  can

overlay the outer one or lie at a right angle to it.

This ocular structure gives a dragon extremely

accurate depth perception and focusing abil-

ity no matter how much or how little light is

available.

A  dragons  eye  is  protected  by  a  leathery

outer eyelid and three smooth inner eyelids, or

nictitating  membranes.  The  innermost  mem-

brane is crystal clear and serves to protect the

eye  from  damage  while  the  dragon  flies,

5

fights, swims, or burrows with its eyes open. The other two

eyelids mainly serve to keep the inner membrane and the

surface of the eye clean. They are thicker than the inner-

most  membrane  and  less  clear.  A  dragon  can  use  these

inner lids to protect its eyes from sudden flashes of bright

light. A dragons eyes glow in the dark, but the dragon can

hide the glow by closing one or more of its inner eyelids;

doing this does not affect its vision.

A dragons ears often prove indistinguishable from the

frills that frame its head, especially when the dragon is at

rest. The ears of an an active dragon, however, constantly

twitch and swivel as the dragon tracks sounds.

Not  all  dragons  have  external  ears;  bur-

rowing  and  aquatic  dragons  usu-

ally  have  simple  ear  holes

protected  by  an  overhang-

ing fringe.

sharp teeth. The exact num-

ber and size of a dragons teeth depend on the dragons age,

habitat, and diet; however, a dragons array of teeth usually

includes four well-developed fangs (two upper, two lower)

that curve slightly inward and have cutting edges on both

the  inner  and  outer  surfaces.  A  dragon  uses  its  fangs  to

impale  and  kill  prey,  and  they  serve  as  the  dragons  pri-

mary weapons.

Immediately  in  front  of  the  fangs  in  each  jaw  lie  the

dragons incisors, which are oval in cross-section and have

serrated  edges  at  the  top.  When  a  dragon  bites  down  on

large prey, these teeth cut out a semicircle of flesh.

Behind the fangs in each jaw, a dragon has a row of peglike

molars that help it grip prey. A dragon is not well equipped

for  chewing,  and  it  typically  tears  prey  into  chunks  small

enough to gulp down. A dragon can create a sawing motion

with  its  incisors  by  wiggling  its  lower  jaw  and  shaking  its

head from side to side, allowing the incisors to quickly shear

through flesh and bone.

Many dragons learn to seize prey and literally shake it to

6

death. Other dragons have mastered the technique of grab-

bing prey and swallowing it whole.

Some dragon hunters boast that they can hold a dragons

mouth closed, preventing the creature from biting. It is true

that a dragon applies more force when closing its jaws than

it does when opening them; however, holding a dragons

mouth closed still requires prodigious strength. Even if an

foe were to succeed in clamping its jaws shut, the dragon is

likely to throw off the opponent with one flick of its head,

claw its attacker to ribbons, or both.

The  spines,  frills,  and  other  projections

that adorn a  dragons  head

make  the  creature  look

fearsome,  and  that  is  their

main function.

A dragons horn is a keratinous

projection  growing  directly  from

the  dragons  skull.  A  dragon  with

horns  that  point  backward  can  use

the  horns  for  grooming,  and  they  also

help protect the dragons upper neck in combat.

Horns projecting from the sides of a dragons head

help protect the head.

A  dragons  spines  are  keratinous,  but  softer

and more flexible than its horns. The spines are

imbedded in the dragons skin and anchored to

the  skeleton  by  ligaments.  Most  spines  are

located  along  the  dragons  back  and  tail.  Unlike

horns, spines are mobile, with a range of motion

that  varies  with  the  kind  of  dragon  and  the

spines  location  on  the  drag-

ons  body.  The  spines

along  a  dragons  back,

for  example,  can  only  be

raised or lowered, whereas

the spines supporting a dragons ears can be moved many

different ways.

The frills on a dragons back and tail help keep the dragon

stable when flying or swimming.

To  a  scholar  who  knows  something  about  the  natural

world, a dragons powerful legs are decidedly nonreptilian,

despite their scaly coverings. A dragons legs are positioned

more or less directly under its body, in the manner of mam-

mals. (Most reptiles legs tend to splay out to the sides, offer-

ing  much  less  support  and  mobility  than  a  dragon  or

mammal enjoys.)

A dragons four feet resemble those of a great bird. Each

foot  has  three  or  four  clawed  toes  facing  forward  (the

number varies, even among dragons of the same kind), plus

an additional toe, also with a claw, set farther back on the

foot  and  facing  slightly  inward  toward  the  dragons  body,

like a humans thumb.

Although a dragons front feet are not truly prehensile, a

dragon can grasp objects with its front feet, provided they

are not too small. This grip is not precise enough for tool

use, writing, or wielding a weapon, but a dragon can hold

and  carry  objects.  A  dragon  also  is  capable  of  wielding

magical devices, such as wands, and can complete somatic

components  required  for  the  spells  it  can  cast  (see  Spell-

casting, below). Some dragons are adroit enough to seize

prey in their front claws and carry it aloft.

A dragon can use the thumbs on its rear feet to grasp as

well, but the grip is less precise than that of the front feet.

A dragons skin resembles crocodile hidetough, leath-

ery. and thick. Unlike a crocodile, however, a dragon has

hundreds  of  hard,  durable  scales  covering  its  body.  A

dragons scales are keratinous, like its spines. Unlike the

spines,  however,  a  dragons  scales  are  not  attached  to  its

skeleton,  and  the  dragon  cannot  make  them  move. The

scales are much harder and less flexible than the spines,

with a resistance to blows that exceeds that of steel.

A  dragons  largest  scales  are  attached  to  its  hide  along

one  edge  and  overlap  their  neighbors  like  shingles  on  a

roof or the articulated plates in a suit of armor. These scales

cover the dragons neck, underbelly, toes, and tail. As the

dragon moves its body, the scales tend to shift as the skin

and  muscle  under  them  moves,  and  the  scales  free  ends

sometimes rise up slightly. This phenomenon has led some

observers to mistakenly conclude that a dragon can  raise

and lower its scales in the same manner as a bird fluffing

its feathers.

The majority of a dragons scales are smaller and attached

to  the  skin  near  their  centers. These  scales  interlock  with

neighboring scales, giving the surface of the body a pebbly

texture. The scales are large enough to form

a  continuous  layer  of  natural  armor

over the body even when it

stretches  or  bulges  to  its

greatest  extent.  When

the  body  relaxes  or

contracts,  the  skin

under  the  scales

tends  to  fold  and

wrinkle, though the

interlocking  scales

give the body a fairly

smooth look.





A dragons scales

grow  throughout

its  lifetime,  albeit

very  slowly.  Unlike

most  other  scaled  crea-

tures, a dragon neither sheds

its  skin  nor  sheds  individual  scales.

Instead, its individual scales grow larger, and it

also grows new scales as its body gets bigger. Over the years,

a scale may weather and crack near the edges, but its slow

growth usually proves sufficient to replace any portion that

breaks  off.  Dragons  occasionally  lose  scales,  especially  if

they  become  badly  damaged.  Old  scales  often  litter  the

floors of long-occupied dragon lairs.



When a dragon loses a scale, it usually grows a new one in

its place. The new scale tends to be smaller than its neigh-

bors and usually thinner and weaker as well. This phenom-

enon  is  what  gives  rise  to  bards  tales  about  chinks  in  a

dragons armor. These tales are true as far as they go, but one

new  scale  on  a  dragons  massive  body  seldom  leaves  the

dragon particularly vulnerable to attack.

A dragons long, muscular tail serves mainly as a rudder

in flight. A dragon also uses its tail for propulsion when

swimming, and as a weapon.

A dragons wings consist of a membrane of scaleless hide

stretched over a framework of strong but lightweight bones.

Immensely powerful muscles in the dragons chest provide

power for flight.

Most dragons have wings that resemble bat wings, with a

relatively short supporting alar limb, ending in a vestigial

claw that juts forward. Most of the wing area comes from

a  membrane  stretched  over  elongated  fingers  of  bone

(the  alar  phalanges;  see  Skeleton,  below),  which  stretch

far beyond the alar limb.

Some kinds of dragons have wings that run the lengths of

their bodies, something like the wings of manta rays. This

sort of wing also has an alar limb with phalanges supporting

the forward third of the wing, but the remainder of the wing

is supported by modified frill spines that have only a limited

range of motion and muscular control.

Inside the Dragons Eye

Most scholars remain unaware of how complex and unusual

a dragons eye really is. In addition to its four layers of eye-

lids and its double pupil, a dragons eye also  has  a  double

lens. The outer lens (1) is much the same

as  any  other  creatures  in  form  and

function. The inner lens (2), however,

is a mass of transparent muscle fibers that

can polarize incoming light. The inner lens

also  serves  to  magnify  what  the  dragon

sees,  and  helps  account  for  the  drag-

ons  superior  long-

distance  vision.

A  dragons  ret-

inas (3) are packed

with  receptors

for both color and

black-and-white  vision.

Behind  the  retina  lies  the  tapetum

lucidum (4), a reflective layer that helps the

dragon  see  in  dim  light.  A  dragon  literally

sees  light  twice,  once  when  it  strikes

the  retina  and  again  when  it  is

reflected  back.  It  is  the  tapetum

lucidum that makes a dragons eyes seem to



glow in the dark.

INTERNAL ANATOMY

blance  to  a  reptile  is  literally  only  skin  deep.  Refer  to  the

accompanying illustrations as you read on.

Skeleton

most scholars agree that a little more than 500 bones com-

Dragon bones are immensely

strong, yet exceptionally light.

In  cross-section  they  look

hollow, with thick walls made

up  of  concentric  circles  of

small chambers staggered like

brickwork.  Layers  of  sturdy

connective  tissue  and  blood

vessels  run  between  the  layers.

The  accompanying  diagram

shows a dragon skeleton in detail.

Significant parts of the skeleton are

briefly discussed below.



The keel, or sternum (1), serves as

an anchor for the dragons flight mus-

cles. The scapula draconis (2) supports

the  wing.  The  metacarpis  draconis  (3)

and alar phalanges (4) in each wing sup-

port  most  of  the  wings  flight  surface.  In

some dragons, the ulna draconic

(5)  has  an  extension  called  the

alar  olecranon  (6)  that  lends

extra support to the wing.

The  thirteenth  cervical

vertebra  (7)  marks  the  base

of  a  dragons  neck.  Every  true

dragon, no matter how large

or  small,  has  exactly  13

cervical vertebrae, 12

thoracic  vertebrae,  7

lumbar vertebrae, and

36  caudal  vertebrae.

Major Internal Organs

The insides of a dragon have several note-

worthy features, all of which contribute to

the dragons unique capabilities.



A  dragons  eyes  (1)  are  slightly  larger  than

they appear from the outside. The bulk of the

eye remains buried inside the skull, with only

a small portion of the whole exposed when

a dragon opens its eyes. The

eyes extra size helps improve

the dragons ability to see at a distance.

The eyes spherical shape allows the dragon to move the eye

through a wide arc, helping to expand its field of vision.

A dragons brain (2) is exceptionally large, even for such a

big creature, and it continues to grow as the dragon grows.

It  has  highly  developed  sensory  centers  with  specialized

lobes that connect directly to the eyes, ears, and nasal pas-

sages. The brain also has large areas dedicated to memory

and reasoning.

The larynx (3) contains numerous well-developed vocal

folds that give a dragon tremendous control over the tone

and pitch of its voice. A dragons voice can be as shrill as a

crows or as deep as a giants. Some scholars, noting that the

8











Draconic language (see page 28) contains many harsh sounds

and sibilants, conclude that a dragons vocal capacity is lim-

ited,  but  this  is  not  so.  Dragons  speak  a  strident  language

because it suits them to do so.

The trachea (4) connects the larynx to the lungs.

It is the dragons conduit for respiration and also for

its breath weapon.

A dragons vast lungs (5) fill much of its chest cavity.

The lung structure resembles that of an avian, which can

extract oxygen both

on inhalation and exha-

lation. In addition to being

the  organs  for  respiration,  a

dragons breath weapon is generated

in  its  lungs  from  secretions  produced

by the draconis fundamentum (see below).

A  dragons  mighty  heart  (6)  has  four

chambers, just like a mammals heart.













The  draconis

fundamentum

(7) is a gland possessed

only by true dragons. Attached

to  the  heart,  it  is  the  center  of  ele-

mental activity inside the dragons body.

All  blood  flowing  from  the  heart  passes

through this organ before going to the body. The

draconis fundamentum charges the lungs with power

for  a  dragons  breath  weapon  and  also  plays  a  major

role  in  the  dragons  highly  efficient

metabolism,  which  con-

verts  the  vast  majority  of

whatever the creature consumes

into  usable  energy.  Blood  vessels,

nerves, and ducts run directly from the draconis

fundamentum  to  the  dragons  flight

muscles,  charging  them  with

enormous energy, and also to

the  lungs  and  the  gizzard.

A  dragon  digests  its

food  through  a  combina-

tion of powerful muscular

action and elemental force.

The interior of the gizzard

(8) is lined with bony plates

that  grind  up  chunks  of

food, and the entire organ is

charged with the same elemental energy that

the dragon uses for its breath weapon.

Musculature

Intact dragon carcasses are even more rare than intact dragon

skeletons, making any catalog of a dragons muscles unreliable

at best. Given the number of bones in a dragon skeleton, how-

ever, a dragons muscles must number in the thousands.

Overall, a dragons musculature resembles that of a great

cat, but with much larger muscles in the chest, neck, and

tail.  The  illustration  on  page  10  identifies  the  major

muscle groups in a dragons body.

Of  most  interest  to  scholars  are  the  muscles  involved  in

flight. These  muscles  can  exert  tremendous  force  and  con-

sume equally tremendous amounts of energy (which the dra-

conis fundamentum supplies). The flight muscles are located

in the chest and in the wings themselves. The alar pectoral

(1) is the main flight muscle and is used on the wings down-

stroke. The alar lattisimus dorsai (2) draws the wing up and

back. The alar deltoid (3) and alar cleidomastoid (4) draw the

wings up and forward.

The  muscles  of  the  wings  serve  mainly  to  control  the

wings shape, which in turn helps the dragon maneuver in

the air. The alar tricep (5) and alar bicep (6) fold and unfold

the wings. The alar carpi ulnaris (7) and alar carpi radialus

(8) allow the wings to warp and twist.

DRAGON PHYSIOLOGY

Dragons are scaly, they lay eggs, and they are utterly lacking in any

mammalian  characteristics.  The  notion  that  they  are  warm-

blooded is silly.

Aloysius Egon Greegier, armchair dragon scholar

Just like a humanoid to quote three facts, get one of them wrong,

and then draw an unrelated conclusion from the lot.

Kacdaninymila, young adult gold dragon, upon reading

Greegiers statement

Scholars  disagree  on  some  key  aspects  of  dragon  life,  but

dragons themselves have few doubts.

METABOLISM

Laypeople, and some scholars, are fond of the terms cold-

blooded and warm-blooded to describe ectothermic and

endothermic creatures, respectively.

An ectothermic creature lacks the ability to produce its

own heat and must depend on its environment for warmth.

Most  ectothermic  creatures  seldom  actually  have  cold

blood, because they are able to find environmental heat to

warm their bodies.

An endothermic creature doesnt necessarily have warm

blood.  What  it  has  is  a  body  temperature  that  remains

more or less steady no matter how hot or cold its surround-

ings become.

All true dragons are endothermic. Given their elemental

nature, they could hardly be otherwise. A dragons body tem-

perature depends on its kind and sometimes on its age. Drag-

ons that use fire have the highest body temperatures, and

dragons that use cold have the lowest. Acid- and electricity-

using dragons have body temperatures that fall between the

two extremes, with acid-users tending to have cooler bodies

than  electricity-users.  Fire-using  dragons  literally  become

hotter with age. Likewise, cold-using dragons become colder

as they age. Acid- and electricity-using dragons have about

the  same  body  temperature

throughout  their  lives,  with

younger and smaller dragons

having  slightly  higher  tem-

peratures  than  older  and

larger ones.

Unlike  most  endothermic

creatures,  dragons  have  no

obvious  way  to  shed  excess

body heat. They do not sweat,

nor  do  they  pant.  Instead,  the

draconis fundamentum extracts

heat  from  the  bloodstream  and

stores the energy. In a sense, then, a

dragon  can  be  considered  ectother-

mic (because it can use environmen-

tal  heat).  However,  when  a  dragon  is

deprived  of  an  external  heat  source,  its

metabolism  and  activity  level  do  not

change. Unlike a truly ectothermic creature,

a  dragon  can  generate  its  own

body  heat  and  is  not  slowed  or

forced into hibernation by

exposure to cold.

DIET

Dragons  are  carnivores

and  top  predators,

though in practice

they  are  omnivo-

rous  and  eat  almost

anything  if  necessary.  A  dragon  can

literally eat rock or dirt and survive.

Some dragons, particularly the metal-

lic ones, subsist primarily on inorganic

fare. Such dining habits, however, are cul-

tural in origin.

out as humble eggs and progress through twelve distinct life

stages,  each  marked  by  new  developments  in  the

dragons body, mind, or behavior.

EGGS

Dragon eggs vary in size depending on the kind

of dragon. They are generally the same color

as  the  dragon  that  laid

them  and  the  have  the

same  energy  immunities  as

the dragon that laid them (for

example, black dragon eggs are

black or dark gray and impervi-

ous to acid). A dragon egg has

an elongated ovoid shape and

a hard, stony shell.

A female dragon

can  produce  eggs

beginning  at  her  young

adult stage and remains fer-

tile though the very old stage.

Males are capable of fertilizing

eggs beginning at the young adult

stage  and  remain  fertile  through

the wyrm stage.

The  eggs  are  fertilized  inside

the females body and are ready

for laying about a quarter of the

way  through  the  incubation

period, as shown on the table

below.  The  numbers  given

on the table are approximate;

actual  periods  can  vary  by  as

much as 10 days either way.

Laying Dragon Eggs

Dragon  eggs  are  laid  in

clutches  of  two  to  five  as

often as once a year. Ovula-

tion  begins  with  mating,

and a female dragon can pro-

duce eggs much less often, if

she  wishes,  simply  by  not

















Unfortunately  for  a  dragons  neighbors,

the difference between how much a dragon

must eat and how much it is able to eat is

vast. Most dragons can easily

consume  half  their  own

weight in meat every day, and many

gladly do so if sufficient prey is available. Even after habit-

ual gorging, a dragon seldom gets fat. Instead, it converts its

food into elemental energy and stores it for later use. Much

of this stored energy is expended on breath weapons and on

the numerous growth spurts (see below) that a dragon expe-

riences throughout its life.

DRAGON LIFE CYCLE

From the tiny egg the great wyrm grows.

Kobold proverb

Barring some misfortune, a dragon can expect to live in good

health  for  1,200  years,  possibly  even  a  great  deal  longer,

depending on its general fitness. All dragons, however, start

A dragon eggs ovoid shape gives it great resistance to pres-

Dragons  sometimes  leave  their  eggs  untended.  In  such

cases, the female takes great care to keep the nest hidden.

wise, the wyrmling must break out on its own, a process

that usually takes no more than a minute or two once the

Hatching Dragon Eggs

pqqqqrs

RULES: INCUBATING DRAGON EGGS

Once  laid,  a  dragon  egg  requires  suitable  incubation  condi-

tions  if  it  is  to  hatch.  The  basic  requirements  depend  on  the

kind  of  dragon,  as  described  below.  The  embryonic  wyrmling

inside a dragon egg can survive under inadequate incubation

conditions, but not for long. For every hour during which incu-

bation  conditions  are  not  met,  the  wyrmling  must  make  a

Constitution  check  (DC  15  +1  per  previous  check;  an  embry-

onic  wyrmling  has  the  same  Constitution  score  as  a  hatched

wyrmling) to survive.

An  embryonic  wyrmling  inside  a  dragon  egg  becomes

sentient as it enters the final quarter of the incubation period.

Dragon egg incubation conditions are as follows:

Black: The egg must be immersed in acid strong enough to

deal  at  least  1d4  points  of  damage  per  round,  or  sunk  in  a

swamp, bog, or marsh.

Blue: For half of each day, the egg must be kept in a temper-

ature of 90F to 120F, followed by a half day at 40F to 60F.

Brass: The  egg  must  be  kept  in  an  open  flame  or  in  a

temperature of at least 140F.

Bronze: The  egg  must  be  immersed  in  a  sea  or  ocean  or

someplace where tidewaters flow over it at least twice a day.

Copper: The egg must be immersed in acid strong enough

to deal at least 1d4 points of damage per round of exposure, or

packed in cool sand or clay (40F to 60F).

Gold: The egg must be kept in an open flame or in a temper-

ature of at least 140F.

Green: The egg must be immersed in acid strong enough

to deal at least 1d4 points of damage per round, or buried in

leaves moistened with rainwater.

Red: The egg must be kept in an open flame or in a temper-

ature of at least 140F.

Silver: The  egg  must  be  buried  in  snow,  encased  in  ice,  or

kept in a temperature below 0F.

White: The egg must be buried in snow, encased in ice, or

kept in a temperature below 0F.

and the wyrmlings claws are too weak to overcome the shells

hardness.  To  escape  the  egg,  the  wyrmling  must  break  the

shell  by  making  a  DC  20  Strength  check.  Fortunately  for  the

wyrmling,  it  can  simply  take  20  on  the  check,  breaking  the

shell in about 2 minutes.

To determine the day on which the eggs in a clutch hatch,

roll 1d10. On an odd number, the eggs hatch 1d10 days earlier

than the norm (see Table 11). On an even number, the eggs

hatch 1d10 days later than the norm.

If the egg has been tended by at least one of the wyrmlings

parents, it needs to make no further checks to survive.

If incubation conditions have been less than ideal, however,

the wyrmling must make a Constitution check to survive. The

table below provides a list of circumstances and the DC of the

Constitution check to survive despite the bad conditions.

In  the  case  of  a  disturbed  nest  or  an  egg  removed  from  a

nest, the creature tending the egg may make a Heal check, with

a +1 bonus if the creature has 5 or more ranks of Knowledge

(arcana).  The  wyrmling  can  use  either  its  own  Constitution

check result or the Heal check result, whichever is higher.

Opening  an  egg  before  the  final  quarter  of  the  incubation

period causes the wyrmling inside to die. If the egg is opened

during  the  final  quarter  of  the  incubation  period,  the  wyrm-

ling  can  make  a  check  to  survive,  but  if  successful  it  takes

nonlethal damage equal to its current hit points. This damage

cannot be healed until the wyrmlings normal incubation period

passes,  and  the  wyrmling  remains  staggered  for  the  entire

period. During this period, a prematurely hatched wyrmling

must be tended in the same manner as an unhatched egg in

order to survive.

wyrmling begins trying to escape the egg. All the eggs in a

clutch hatch at about the same time.

Properly tended and incubated dragon eggs have practi-

cally a 100% hatching rate. Eggs that have been disturbed,

and particularly eggs that have been removed from a nest

and incubated artificially, may be much less likely to pro-

duce live wyrmlings.

WYRMLING (AGE 0-5 YEARS)

A wyrmling emerges from its egg fully formed and ready to

face life. From the tip of its nose to the end of its

tail, it is about twice as long as the egg that held

it (the actual size of the wyrmling depends on

the variety of dragon; see Chapter 5).

A newly hatched dragon emerges from

its  egg  cramped  and  sodden.  After

about  an  hour,  it  is  ready  to  fly,

fight, and reason. It inherits

a considerable body of prac-

tical  knowledge  from  its

parents, though such inher-

ent  knowledge  often  lies

buried  in  the  wyrmlings

memory,  unnoticed  and

unused  until  it  is  needed.

Compared  to  older  drag-

ons,  a  wyrmling  seems  a  little

awkward.  Its  head  and  feet  seem

slightly oversized, and its wings and tail are

proportionately smaller than they are in adults.

If  a  parent  is  present  at  the  wyrmlings  hatching,  the

youngster has a protector and will probably enjoy a secure

existence for the first decades of its life. If not, the wyrmling

faces a struggle for survival.

Whether raised by another dragon or left to fend for itself,

the  wyrmlings  first  order  of  business  is  learning  to  be  a

dragon,  which  includes  securing  food,  finding  a  lair,  and

understanding its own abilities (usually in that order).

A newly hatched wyrmling almost immediately searches

for food. The first meal for a wyrmling left to fend for itself is

often the shell from its egg. This practice not only assures the

youngster a good dose of vital minerals, but also provides an

alternative to attacking and consuming its nestmates. Wyrm-

lings reared by parents are often offered some tidbit that the

variety  favors.  For  example,  copper  dragons  provide  their

offspring with monstrous centipedes or scorpions. In many

cases this meal is in the form of living prey, and the wyrmling

gets its first hunting lesson along with its first meal.

With its hunger satisfied, the wyrmlings next task is se-

curing  a  lair.  The  dragon  looks  for  some  hidden  and

defensible cave, nook, or cranny where it can rest, hide, and

begin storing treasure. Even a wyrmling under the care of a

parent finds a section of the parents lair

to call its own.

Once it feels secure in its lair and reason-

ably  sure  of  its  food  supply,  the  wyrmling

settles down to hone its inherent abilities.

It usually does so by testing itself in any way

it can. It tussles with its nestmates, seeks out

dangerous creatures to fight, and spends long

hours in meditation. If a parent is present, the

wyrmling  receives  instruction  on  draconic

matters  and  the  chance  to  accompany  the

parent  during  its  daily  activities.  Wyrm-

lings on their own sometimes seek out older

dragons  of  the  same  kind  as  mentors.

Among good dragons, such relationships

tend  to  be  casual  and  often  last  for

decades  (a  fairly  short  period  by

dragon standards). The young-

ster  visits  the  older  dragon

periodically  (monthly,  perhaps

weekly) for advice and informa-

tion.  Evil  dragons,  too,  often

counsel wyrmlings that are not

their offspringevil dragons

lack  any  sense  of  altruism,

but  usually  understand  the

role of youth in perpetuating the species.

No matter what kinds of dragons are involved,

such  mentor-apprentice  relationships  require  the

younger dragon to show the utmost respect and deference

to the older dragon, and to bring the mentor gifts of food,

information, and treasure. Should the older dragon ever

come to view the apprentice as a rival, the relationship ends

immediately; when evil dragons are involved, the ending is

often fatal for the younger dragon.

VERY YOUNG (AGE 6-15 YEARS)

By age 6, a dragon has grown enough to double its length,

though its head and feet still seem too big for the rest of its

body. It becomes physically stronger and more robust. The

dragons larger size often makes finding a new lair necessary.

Many  dragons  relocate  at  this  stage  anyway,  especially  if

they  do  not  have  parental  support.  (After  the  dragon  has

hunted in an area for five years, the location of the original

lair  might  have  become  known  to  outsiders,  or  the  area

around the lair could become depleted of prey.)

In most ways, a very young dragon remains much like a

wyrmling, albeit more confident in itself.

RULES: WYRMLING ABILITIES

YOUNG (AGE 16-25 YEARS)

By  age  16,  most  dragons  begin  a  new  growth  spurt  that

eventually carries them to their adult sizethough they

still retain a wyrmlings overlarge head and feet. Their intel-

lects become sharper as they gain life experience and master

their innate abilities.

At this stage, a dragon begins to feel the urge to collect trea-

sure and to establish a territory (though it might well have

done both sooner). In some cases, however, a young dragon

continues to share its lair and its territory with nestmates

or parents. Dragons that leave the nest when they become

young often range far from their home lairs, seeking locales

where they can set up housekeeping on their own.

JUVENILE (AGE 26-50 YEARS)

By age 26, a dragon is well on its way to adulthood. It has

nowhere near the physical power of an adult, but it has an

their magical powers at this stage.

By this age, a dragons scales have developed into armor

formidable enough to turn aside all but magic weaponry or

the teeth and claws of other dragons. A young adult dragon

also masters its first spells and shows evidence of a formi-

dable intellect.

A young adult dragon severs its ties with nestmates, men-

tors, and parents (if it has not done so already) and estab-

lishes it own lair and territory.

ADULT (AGE 101-200 YEARS)

During  the  second  century  of  its  life,  a  dragons  physical

growth begins to slowbut its body is just entering its prime.

With the dragons initial growth spurt over, the dragons body

becomes even more powerful and healthy. An adult dragon

continues  to  hone  its  mental  faculties  and  masters  more

skills and magic.

At this stage in life, a dragon is most likely to take a long-

term mate and share its lair with a mate and offspring.

RULES: REARING A DRAGON

Being  an  adoptive  parent  to  a  dragon  is  no  easy  task.  Even

good-aligned  dragons  have  a  sense  of  superiority  and  an

innate yearning for freedom. Most dragons instinctively defer

to  older  dragons  of  the  same  kind,  but  they  tend  to  regard

other creatures with some disdain.

Older  and  wiser  dragons  eventually  learn  to  respect  non-

dragons  for  their  abilities  and  accomplishments,  but  a  newly

hatched wyrmling tends to regard a nondragon foster parent as

a captoror at best as a well-meaning fool. Still, it is possible

for a nondragon character to forge a bond with a newly hatched

wyrmling. Accomplishing this requires the use of Diplomacy or

Intimidate as well as (eventually) the Handle Animal skill.

A character seeking to rear a newly hatched wyrmling must

begin  with  a  Diplomacy  or  Intimidate  check  to  persuade  the

dragon to accept the characters guidance; 5 or more ranks of

Knowledge  (arcana)  gives  the  character  a  +2  bonus  on  the

check.  The  characters  Diplomacy  or  Intimidate  check  is

opposed by a Sense Motive check by the dragon. The dragon

has a +15 racial bonus on its check. Certain other conditions,

such  as  those  mentioned  on  the  table  below,  can  further

modify the wyrmlings Sense Motive check.

of  the  check.  If  the  wyrmling  wins  the  opposed  check,  it

regards the character as a captor and attempts to gain its free-

dom any way it can. (Most dragons, even newly hatched wyrm-

lings,  are  smart  enough  to  forego  an  immediate  attack  on  a

more powerful being, and will wait for the right opportunity to

escape.) No attempt by this character to rear this dragon can

succeed. This opposed check cannot be retried.

If the character wins this opposed check, he or she can attempt

to rear the dragon. The process takes 5 years, but once the rear-

ing period begins, the character need only devote one day a week

to the dragons training. Throughout the rearing period, however,

the dragon must be fed and housed at a cost of 10 gp per day.

When  the  rearing  period  has  run  its  course,  the  character

attempts  a  Handle  Animal  check  (DC  20  +  the  dragons  Hit

Dice at the very young stage). Only one check is made, rolled

secretly by the DM. A failed check cannot be retried. If the char-

acters Handle Animal check fails, the dragon is not success-

fully  reared  and  seeks  to  leave,  as  noted  above.  If  the  check

succeeds,  the  character  can  begin  to  train  the  dragon  to

perform  tasks  (the  most  common  of  which  is  serving  as  a

mount;  see  Dragons  as  Mounts,  page  136,  and  the  Handle

Animal skill, page 74 of the Players Handbook).

the  Leadership  feat  (see  page  106  of  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide) by the time the rearing period expires, and must have a

young stage as its cohort level). Also, the dragons alignment

the  law-vs.-chaos  or  good-vs.-evil  axis  (for  example,  a  lawful

undergoes little obvious physical change. By this stage of life,

a dragon is truly a force to be reckoned withand it knows it.

Mature  adults  display  a  degree  of  self-confidence  that

younger dragons lack. Mature adults seldom seek out danger

just to prove themselves (except, perhaps, against other drag-

ons). Instead, they act with purpose and confidence, often

launching schemes that take years to complete.

Because of a mature adults power, wealth, and age, it seldom

remains  unnoticed  in  the  larger  world.  Its  name  becomes

known, at least among other dragons, and it often becomes the

target of rival dragons or adventurers. One of a mature adults

first orders of business is to review and improve the defenses

in its lair. Often, the dragon relocates as a matter of prudence.

The  dragon  never  chooses  its  new  lair  hastily,  and  usually

includes  in  its  plans  some  scheme  to  secure  more  treasure.

Bards tales of dragons destroying kingdoms and seizing their

treasuries often have their roots in true accounts of what hap-

pens when a mature adult dragon is on the move.

OLD (AGE 401-600 YEARS)

By  the  time  most  dragons  reach  this  age,  their  physical

growth stops, though they become even more hardy, and

their  minds  and  magical  powers  continue  to  expand  with

the passing centuries.

Old dragons usually begin to show some outward signs of

aging: Their scales begin to chip and crack at the edges and

also to darken and lose their luster (though some metallic

dragons actually take on a burnished appearance), and the

irises in their eyes begin to fade, so that their eyes begin to

resemble featureless orbs.

Most old dragons continue to hone the patient cunning

they began to develop as mature adults. Though quick to

defend what they regard as their own, they seldom rush into

anything,  preferring  instead  to  plumb  the  possibilities  in

any situation before acting.

VERY OLD (AGE 601-800 YEARS)

After passing the six-century mark, a dragon becomes even

more resistant to physical punishment. It begins master-

ing potent spells and magical abilities. This is the last stage

of  life  in  which  female  dragons  remain  fertile,  and  most

females attempt to raise at least two clutches of eggs before

their reproductive period runs out.

ANCIENT (AGE 801-1,000 YEARS)

By this stage, female dragons have reached the end of their

reproductive years. Many females compensate by mentor-

ing  younger  dragons  of  the  species,  as  do  many  males.

Ancient dragons have little to fear from much younger drag-

ons  that  have  not  yet  reached  adulthood,  and  they  have

much wisdom and experience to pass on.

Most  dragons  at  this  age  have  minds  to  match  the  best

and brightest humans, and they can tap into vast stores of

knowledge, both practical and esoteric.

WYRM (AGE 1,001-1,200 YEARS)

Surviving for more than a thousand years is a grand accom-

plishment, even for dragons, and this stage is a great milestone

in  dragon  life.  Even  among  rival  dragons,  a  wyrm  com-

mands at least grudging respect. Male dragons at this stage

are reaching the end of their reproductive years, but their

exalted  status  among  dragons  practically  guarantees  them

mates. Younger females often establish territories adjacent

to a male wyrm for mating, for protection, and to make it

easy for the offspring to gain the wyrm as a mentor.

GREAT WYRM (AGE 1,201+ YEARS)

When  a  dragon  passes  the  twelve-century  mark,  its  mental

and physical development is finally at an end, and the dragon

is  at  the  peak  of  its  physical,  mental,  and  magical  powers.

THE TWILIGHT AND DEATH

Exactly how long a dragon can live after reaching the great

wyrm stage is a matter of some debate (some scholars con-

tend  that  a  dragon  lives  forever).  Unfortunately,  dragons

themselves are little help in this matter. They keep no birth

records and are apt to exaggerate their ages.

The  half-elf  sages  Guillaume  and  Cirjon  de  Cheirdon

made a study of dragon ages by carefully noting when cer-

tain famous (and infamous) dragons reached their wyrm cel-

ebrations  and  then  tracking  their  ages  from  there.  Some

later scholars suspect that Guillaume and Cirjon were silver

dragons using half-elf guise, and that the speculations they

published were in fact field notes. In any case, the pair even-

tually vanished, and their final resting places are not known.

Perhaps  they  died  in  a  dragon  attack,  or  perhaps  they  are

with us still, in other guises.

pqqqqrs

RULES: ONSET OF THE TWILIGHT AND DEATH

A dragons maximum age is a function of its Charisma score.

For a chromatic dragon, multiply the dragons Charisma score

by  50  and  add  the  result  to  1,200.  This  is  the  age  when  the

twilight  period  begins  for  that  kind  of  dragon.  For  a  metallic

dragon, multiply the dragons Charisma score by 100 and add

the result to 1,200. This difference reflects the fact that metal-

lic dragons are longer-lived than chromatic dragons. Maximum

ages for the dragons found in the Monster Manual are given on

the table below.

When a dragons twilight period begins, the dragon must make

a DC 20 Constitution check. The dragon dies if the check fails.

If the check succeeds, the dragon survives, but its Constitution

score drops by 1. Each year thereafter, the dragon must succeed

on another Constitution check in order to stay alive.

Guillaume and Cirjon established that the shortest-lived

true dragon, the white, can live as long as 2,100 years. The

true dragon species that lives the longest is the gold; Guil-

laume and Cirjon put the golds maximum age at 4,400 years.

In addition, the sages discovered that dragons can extend

their life spans to some extent by entering a state called the

twilight. That term, coined by Guillaume and Cirjon, refers

to the closing phase of a dragons life. The cessation of growth

at the great wyrm stage heralds the onset of death (as it does

for most creatures that grow throughout their lives). A dragon

can survive for centuries after reaching the great wyrm stage,

but a dragon is mortal and cannot stave off death forever. The

twilight occurs when the weight of a dragons years finally

comes crashing down, forcing the dragons physiology into

a downward spiral. A dragons twilight period can last for a

number of years, but often the dragon succumbs when the

twilight first sets in.

AVOIDING THE TWILIGHT

Many  dragons  prefer  to  avoid  a  slow  descent  into  death

and leave the mortal coil with their dignity intact. Many

great wyrms seem to just disappear at the ends of their lives.

No  one  knows  exactly  where  they  go,  but  scholars  have

identified at least three possibilities: departure, guardian-

ship, and dracolichdom.

Departure

A dragon can simply will its spirit to depart. Upon doing so,

the dragon dies, and its spirit is released into the hereafter.

A dragon prepares for its departure by consuming its entire

pqqqqrs

RULES: AVOIDING TWILIGHT

Any dragon that has reached the old age category or higher can

depart, become a guardian, or become a dracolich. (Details of

dracolichdom can be found on page 146.)

After consuming the required amount of treasure, the dragon

must find a dragon graveyard or suitable site to guard. Once it

is at the graveyard or site, the dragon completes the process

instantly simply by willing it to happen.

To depart or become a guardian, a dragon must consume at

least 135,000 gp worth of treasureor at least 90% of its hoard,

if the dragon possesses treasure worth more than 150,000 gp.

All  the  treasure  must  be  consumed  in  the  same  day,  and  at

least  120,000  gp  of  this  treasure  must  have  been  part  of  the

dragons hoard for at least 200 years.

When  a  dragon  departs,  its  body  dies.  When  a  dragon  be-

comes  a  guardian,  its  body  melds  into  the  landscape.  Once  it

has  consumed  the  treasure,  a  dragon  can  delay  departing  or

becoming  a  guardian  for  no  more  than  1  day  per  point  of

Charisma it has. If the dragon exceeds this time limit, the oppor-

tunity is lost, and the dragon cannot make another attempt to

depart until it again consumes the required amount of treasure.

hoard. Most dragons also travel to a dragon graveyard and

die there.

Dragon  graveyards  are  ancient  places  whose  origins  are

lost even to dragon memory. As a rule, they are accessible

only to flying creatures, being situated on mountaintops, in

hidden  valleys  (surrounded  by  jungle,  deserts,  or  moun-

tains), on islands located in windless or storm-tossed seas, or

in the depths of great rifts on the earth.

Within  the  graveyard,  dangers  abound.  Storms  of  ele-

mental  energy  often  wash  over  dragon  graveyards,  and

elemental vortexes often appear in random spots. Some of

these  may  belch  forth  groups  of  hostile  elemental  crea-

tures or suck the unwary right off the Material Plane and

onto  an  elemental  plane.  Dragon  carcasses  or  skeletons

may spontaneously animate and walk about, attacking any

living creatures they meet.

to contain. Other visitors seek to obtain dragon remains for

magical or alchemical purposes.

Guardianship

At the end of its normal life, a dragon can elect to become a

guardian, literally transforming into part of the landscape.

After the dragon consumes its hoard, it changes itself into

a geographic feature: hills, mountains, lakes, swamps, and

groves seem to be the most common choices.

Such areas become favorite places for dragons to lay their

eggs.  It  is  said  that  no  nest  of  dragon  eggs  laid  in  such  a

locale  will  ever  be  disturbed. Wyrmling  dragons  living  in

the site are said to commune with the guardian spirit, receiv-

ing the knowledge they need to become strong adults.

As with dragon graveyards, legends say that some of the

late  dragons  treasure  may  still  remain  hidden  at  the  site,

making  these  features  prime  targets  for  treasure  hunters.

Extracting the treasure (if it exists at all) is apt to be diffi-

cult. Younger dragons living at the site usually resent intru-

sions, as do absentee parents who have laid eggs there (as

we have seen, dragons that leave their eggs untended often

still  keep  watch  over  their  nests). These  sites  also  attract

Dragon graveyards also are haunted by ghostly dragons.

Despite the dangers, dragon graveyards often draw visitors.

According to legend, and some reputed discoveries, not all of

a departed dragons consumed hoard is always destroyed, and

many treasure hunters (showing dragonlike greed)  eagerly

seek out dragon graveyards for the treasures they are said

RULES: DRAGON GRAVEYARDS

A dragon graveyard presents a macabre landscape of blasted

earth littered with ossified dragon bones and fresher dragon

remains.

Every  dragon  graveyard  has  at  least  one  ghostly  guardian,

charged with protecting the place. The graveyards guardian is

exactly  like  a  ghostly  dragon  (see  page  161)  of  a  great  wyrm

dragon, usually a gold dragon or other dragon of lawful align-

ment. The guardian exists only to guard the graveyard, not to

recover  a  lost  hoard.  The  guardian  cannot  be  put  to  rest  by

offering it treasure. If it is defeated in combat, the guardian re-

forms in 1 day.

Other  ghostly  dragons  might  be  present  also.  These  addi-

tional spirits are normal ghostly dragons.

Supernatural  hazards  abound  in  a  dragon  graveyard.

Periodic storms of elemental energy rage through area. These

storms are similar to fire storm spells cast by 20th-level charac-

ters (Reflex DC 23 half), except that they can be composed of

acid,  cold,  electricity,  or  fire,  and  they  cover  the  whole  grave-

yard.  They  typically  strike  every  1d4  hours,  but  the  frequency

can vary widely.

Dragon graveyards also contain areas in which the fabric of

the cosmos is weakened. These unstable areas can be anywhere

from 5 feet to 50 feet across. Every 1d4 hours, such an area is

equally likely to expel a horde of elementals (treat as an elemen-

tal swarm spell cast by a 20th-level character) or draw everything

within  the  unstable  area  into  a  vortex  leading  to  an  elemental

plane. This vortex lasts for 1d4 minutes. Creatures that touch or

enter the unstable area during the period of the disturbance are

whisked to an elemental plane.

A weak spot always has a lingering aura of conjuration magic

(aura strength is overwhelming when it is active).

forces  in  the  graveyard.  These  creatures  attack  any  living

creature  they  meet,  except  for  dragons  that  have  come  to

the graveyard to die.

The legends about treasure in dragon graveyards are true. A

dragon graveyard typically contains triple standard treasure for

the  guardians  Challenge  Rating.  Though  ghostly  dragons

normally  do  not  have  any  treasure,  a  dragon  graveyard  accu-

mulates  bits  and  pieces  of  treasure  that  departing  dragons

have  left  behind  and  equipment  from  would-be  looters  who

werent up to the challenge.

RULES: GUARDED SITES

When a dragon becomes a guardian, it creates a geographical

feature  with  an  area  of  about  1  square  mile  per  5  points  of

Constitution the dragon had.

The  feature  created  always  resembles  a  dragon  in  some

subtle manner. The contours of a hill might suggest a sleeping

dragon,  for  example,  or  a  lake  might  have  the  shape  of  a

dragons head or footprint.

Dragon eggs laid in a guarded area become hidden by non-

detection and mirage arcana effects, provided the female laying

them is of the same kind as the guardian. Both effects lasts until

the eggs hatch, and neither effect has a magical aura, but other-

wise they function as the spells cast by a 20th-level caster.

Any dragon of the same kind as the guardian and of juvenile

age or younger can visit the area once a month and receive the

benefits of a commune spell. Older dragons of the same kind

as the guardian get the same benefit, but only once a year.

The  heart  of  a  guarded  site  may  indeed  contain  a  small

amount of treasure left over from the guardians transformation

(hidden  near  the  heart  of  the  site).  Such  a  treasure  contains

coins and goods only and is of a level equal to one quarter of

the guardians Challenge Rating at the time of its transforma-

tion. Removal of the treasure does not harm the guarded site,

but most dragons take a dim view of such activity.

A dragon graveyard also has an ever-changing population

of  dragon  skeletons  and  dragon  zombies  (see  pages  192

and  197)  that  have  become  animated  by  the  supernatural

Some  evil  dragons  enlist  the  aid  of  others  to  cheat  death.

The  dragon  and  its  servants  create  an  inanimate  object,

called  a  phylactery,  that  will  hold  the  dragons  life  force.

Next,  a  special  brew  is  prepared  for  the  dragon  to  con-

sume. The potion is a lethal poison that slays the dragon for

which it was prepared without fail.

Upon the death of the dragon, its spirit transfers itself to the

phylactery.  From  the  phylactery,  the  spirit  can  occupy  any

dead body that lies close by, including its own former body. If

the body it currently inhabits is destroyed, the spirit returns

to the phylactery, and from there it can occupy a new body.

See the Dracolich entry, page 146, for details on the results

of this process.

DRAGON SENSES

Dragons  dont  see  very  well  in  the  dark.  They  dont  hear  so

well, either.

The late Aylmer Dapynto, erstwhile sage

and dragon hunter

You want to live a long and profitable life? Then dont try to sneak

past a dragon!

Lidda, advising a young rogue

Like  any  predatory  creature,  a  dragon  has  acute  senses.

These  remarkable  senses  become  even  better  as  a  dragon

grows  and  ages,  mostly  because  a  dragons  mind  becomes

ever more perceptive as the centuries pass. A dragons eyes,

ears, and nose may not become any more sharper with age,

but  the  dragons  prodigious  intellect  can  sift  increasing

amounts of information from its environment.

VISION

Dragons have vision superbly adapted to hunting. They enjoy

excellent depth perception, which allows them to judge dis-

tances with great accuracy, and they have outstanding periph-

eral vision as well. Dragons can perceive motion and detail at

least  twice  as  well  as  a  human  in  daylight,  and  their  eyes

adapt quickly to harsh light and glare. A dragon can stare at

the sun on a clear summer day and suffer no loss of vision.

Eagles  and  other  birds  of  prey  can  perform  similar  visual

feats. Such creatures often have poor night visionand it

may be this fact that leads some scholars to conclude that

dragons dont see well in the dark.

In fact, dragons see exceedingly well in dim light. In moon-

light, dragons see as well as they can in sunlight. In even

dimmer light, a dragon sees four times as far as a human can

under  similar  conditions.  Dragons  can  even  see  with  no

light at all.

When any illumination is present, a dragon sees in color.

Its ability to discern hues is at least as good as a humans. In

the  absence  of  light,  a  dragons  vision  is  black-and-white.

pqqqqrs

RULES: DRAGON SIGHT

As noted in the Monster Manual, dragons see extremely well in

all lighting conditions.

In normal light, a dragon sees twice as well has a human. In

game terms, this means that a dragon can detect the presence

of  a  potential  encounter  at  twice  the  distance  given  in  the

Dungeon Masters Guide (see Stealth and Detection in a Forest,

page  87,  and  other  similar  sections). Also,  when  a  dragon

makes a Spot check, it takes only half the penalty for distance:

a 1 penalty per 20 feet of distance rather than the standard 1

per 10 feet of distance.

In dim light, a dragon sees four times as well as a human.

The dragons low-light vision is exactly like that of other crea-

tures with the low-light ability, except that the dragon sees four

times  as  far  when  using  artificial  illumination.  For  example,

from a dragons point of view a light spell produces bright illu-

mination  in  a  40-foot  radius  around  the  affected  object  and

dim light for an additional 40 feet.

In  complete  darkness,  a  dragon  relies  on  darkvision  and

blindsense. Both are exactly like the standard abilities, except

for the dragons exceptional range: 120 feet for darkvision and

60 feet for blindsense.

In addition to their superior visual apparatus, dragons com-

monly have ranks in the Spot skill.

that ability, except to the extent that this sense contributes to

their blindsense.

RULES: DRAGON HEARING

A dragons ability to perceive ultrasonic or subsonic frequen-

cies  is  no  better  than  a  humans.  Dragons  commonly  have

ranks in the Listen skill, and given their enormous number of

skill points many hear much better than typical humans.

RULES: HOVER AND WINGOVER

Hovering is a move action, which means a dragon also can

use its breath weapon, cast a spell, use a spell-like ability, or

make a melee attack while hovering (but not with a wing or

its tail).

If a dragon does not attack during a round when it hovers, it

can instead move at half speed it any direction it likes, includ-

ing straight up, straight down, or backward, no matter what its

maneuverability rating is.

When  a  dragon  stops  hovering,  it  can  turn  in  place  and

resume  ordinary  flight  in  any  direction  in  which  it  could

normally fly. For example, if a dragon were flying north when it

stopped to hover, it could turn around and fly south afterward.

It  still  could  not  fly  straight  up  or  down  or  fly  in  any  other

manner that its maneuverability rating does not allow.

RULES: DRAGON SCENT

Despite  their  excellent  sense  of  smell,  dragons  do  not  have

the scent special ability and do not gain the game benefits of

pqqqqrs

A  dragon  can  perform  a  wingover  as  a  free  action  while

flying. Performing a wingover consumes 10 feet of flying move-

ment.  A  dragon  cannot  hover  or  gain  altitude  in  the  same

round that it performs a wingover.

SCENT

A dragons sense of smell is nearly as well developed as its

vision. This refined sense of smell is only partly dependent

on the dragons sensitive nose; it also uses its forked tongue

to sample the air, just as a snake does. A dragons ability to

sense the presence of other creatures by scent makes it dif-

ficult to catch a dragon unawares, and hiding from a dragon

is nearly impossible once a dragon is close enough to pick

up the quarrys scent.

HEARING

A dragons ears are about as sensitive as human ears, and the

range of tones a dragon can hear is similar to what a human

can hear. Even the youngest of dragons, however, has sharper

hearing than a typical human, thanks to its ability to recog-

nize  important  sounds  for  what  they  are  and  to  filter  out

background noise and focus on significant sounds.

BLINDSENSE

One outstanding example of a dragons sensory prowess is

its blindsensethe ability to see things that are invisi-

ble  or  completely  obscured.  By  using  its  nose  and  ears,

and also by noticing subtle clues such as air currents and

vibrations, a dragon can sense everything in its immediate

vicinity, even with its eyes closed, when shrouded in mag-

ical darkness, or  when  swathed  in  impenetrable  fog.  Of

course,  some  phenomena  are  entirely  visual  in  nature

(such as color), and a dragon that cannot see cannot per-

ceive these phenomena.

TASTE

A dragons sense of taste is highly discriminating. Dragons

can note the slightest variations in the taste of water or food,

and  most  dragons  develop  some  peculiar  culinary  prefer-

ences as a result. Copper dragons, for example, relish ven-

omous vermin. Perhaps the most infamous draconic taste is

the red dragons preference for the flesh of young women.

Curiously,  dragons  dont  seem  to  respond  well  to  sweet

flavors.  Whether  this  is  because  they  dont  like  sweets  or

because they have difficulty distinguishing sweet flavors is

unclear. Most dragons refuse to discuss the matter.

TOUCH

Thanks to its thick, scaly hide and clawed feet, a dragon has

very little tactile sense. Smaller, younger dragons who have

yet to develop impressive natural armor have better senses

of touch than older dragons, making touch the only one of

a dragons senses that gets less acute as a dragon grows and

ages. A dragon interested in a objects texture might touch

or  stroke  the  object  with  its  tongue.  Even  so,  a  dragons

tongue proves better at tasting than touching.

A dragons muted sense of touch might explain its pref-

erence for nests made from piles of coins, gems, or other

treasure. A bed of so many small, hard, sometimes pointy

objects might prove highly uncomfortable to a human, but

to a dragon such an arrangement offers a comfortable tickle,

like a nubby wool blanket.

A dragon in flight? Do you call that flying?

FLIGHT

Kal ostikillam, djinni

Dragons are stately and powerful flyers, able to stay on the wing

for days.

Yunni Cupuricus, sage

Some sages speculate that a dragons ability to fly is partially

magical; however, dragons have been known to take wing

and maneuver inside antimagic areas where their spells and

breath weapons do not work. A dragon owes its ability to fly,

and  its  flight  characteristics,  to  its  peculiar  anatomy  and

metabolism. A dragon weighs much less than a strictly ter-

restrial creature of the same size does, and its musclespar-

ticularly  the  ones  that  enable  it  to  flyare  exceptionally

strong, giving the dragons wings enough power to lift the

dragon into the air.

A dragons biggest problem in flight is just getting aloft.

Given the chance, a dragon prefers to launch itself from a

height, where it can

18

a dragon must maintain some forward momentum to stay in

the air, but some dragons can beat their wings with enough

speed and efficiency to halt their forward motion and hover

in place. While hovering, a dragon can fly straight up, straight

down, sideways, or even backward. Hovering takes consider-

able effort, however, and a dragon can do little else while it

hovers. The downdraft created by a hovering dragon is con-

siderable, and can create huge clouds of dust and debris. Some

dragons can even use this downdraft as a weapon.

Other dragons can take advantage of their supple bodies

to perform a wingovera sort of aerial somersault that lets

them change direction quickly. The dragon thrusts the front

of its body upward and twists its body into a spin. This maneu-

ver allows the dragon to turn in place through an arc of up to

180 degrees while maintaining its present altitude.

OTHER MODES

OF MOVEMENT

Not  every  dragon  falls  upon  you  like  a  thunderbolt  from  the

heavens.

Stewart Debruk, dragon hunter

A dragon doesnt have to take to the air to demonstrate amaz-

ing speed.

RUNNING OR WALKING

A dragon on the ground moves like a cat, and can be just as

graceful (though the bigger dragons tend to lumber along).

When its not in a hurry, a

gain  speed  by  diving  initially.  Failing  that,  a  dragon  takes

flight by leaping into the air, giving itself a boost by snap-

ping its tail downward and pushing off with its hind legs.

Once airborne, a dragon stays aloft with deceptively slow

and stately wing beats. The wings develop tremendous lift

and thrust on each stroke, allowing the dragon to coast for

brief periods. To further conserve energy in flight, a dragon

makes use of any updrafts it can find. Under the right con-

ditions,  a  dragon  can  soar  for  hours  with  little  effort.  A

dragon attempting to fly a long distance usually begins by

finding  an  updraft  and  spiraling  upward  to  a  comfortable

altitude, then soaring from one updraft to another. Dragons

can quickly cover great distances in this manner.

A dragon in straight and level flight holds its body fairly

straight, with its neck and tail extended, its front legs tucked

under its chest, and its rear legs thrown back. The dragons

powerful neck and tail, along with the frills on its back, help

keep it on course. Although a dragons wings do not resemble

a birds wings, a dragon uses its wings as a bird of prey does,

with smooth, steady downstrokes and quick upstrokes.

Wyrmlings are much less majestic flyers than older drag-

ons; they have smaller wings and are forced to beat them

furiously to stay aloft. They resemble fluttering bats when

in flight.

Despite their vast wingspans, dragons can fly through rel-

atively narrow openings simply by folding their wings and

coasting through.

Most dragons have difficulty executing quick maneuvers

in the air. They prefer to make wide, slow turns, using their

tails as rudders. If a more violent maneuver is necessary, a

dragon uses its head and tail to turn itself, and it can also

alter the shape and stroke of its wings. Even so, a dragon has

a wide turning circle, and only the smallest and most

maneuverable  dragon  can  turn  within  its

own length.

Many dragons have perfected some

acrobatic  tricks  to  help  them

maneuver  in  tight  spaces.

The first of these is hov-

ering.  Normally,

dragon walks by moving two legs at a time. The dragon lifts

one forefoot and the hind foot on the opposite side. Like a

cat, with each step a dragon places its hind foot in the place

where the corresponding forefoot was.

As it strides along, a dragon keeps its wings loosely furled

at its side. If it is feeling lazy, it lets its tail drag behind. Usu-

ally, however, a dragon holds its tail off the ground, and the

tail slowly moves from side to side in time with the dragons

gait. The motion helps the dragon keep its balance. The tail

sometimes brushes the ground, but only briefly and usually

well to the left or right of the dragons body.

A running dragon can easily outpace the finest horse. It

uses a galloping motion, moving both front legs together,

followed by both back legs. The wings stay furled, but the

dragon spreads them occasionally to maintain balance. The

tail is held high.

pqqqqrs

RULES: SWIMMING DRAGONS

If a dragon has a swim speed, it can swim on the surface or

below it without difficulty. It moves through water at the listed

speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on

any  Swim  check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a

hazard. It can always can choose to take 10 on a Swim check,

even  if  distracted  or  endangered.  It  can  use  the  run  action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.

A  dragon  holding  its  breath  underwater  must  obey  all  the

normal rules for doing so. Most dragons can hold their breathes

without difficulty for quite long periods, thanks to their impres-

sive Constitution scores. A dragon holding its breath can use its

breath weapon underwater. If the breath weapon uses fire, the

dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Spellcraft check to make it func-

tion properly. If the check fails, the fiery breath merely creates a

few harmless bubbles of steam. No matter what kind of breath

the  dragon  used,  it  stops  holding  its  breath  when  it  uses  its

breath weapon and begins to drown.

A dragon that does not have a swim speed still can swim,

but it must make Swim checks to move, and is subject to all

the  rules  governing  swimming,  including  taking  nonlethal

damage from fatigue when it swims for extended periods (see

the Swim skill description, page 84 of the Players Handbook).

A dragon swimming underwater must hold its breath unless

it  has  the  water  breathing ability.  A  dragon  with  the  water

breathing ability can do anything in the water that it can do out

of the water, including using its breath weapon.

pqqqqrs

RULES: BURROWING DRAGONS

Burrowing dragons can move only through fairly soft mate-

rial such as sand, loamy soil, snow, or ice. The material also

must  be  fairly  dry.  A  burrowing  dragon  cannot  dig  through

mud, for example.

SWIMMING

All true dragons can swim, though only a few kinds can be

considered truly aquatic. Aquatic dragons have long, flat tails

and webbing between their toes or in their shoulder joints.

A swimming dragon usually moves like a big reptile. It

folds its wings tightly against its body and throws its legs

back, creating a streamlined shape. It moves its body left to

right  in  a  sinuous  motion,  and  its  tail  lashes  from  side  to

side, providing propulsion. The truly aquatic dragons some-

times employ their wings as big fins in the manner of a ray

or an aquatic bird.

The frill along a dragons back helps it stay on course when

swimming  underwater,  and  also  keeps  the  dragon  from

rolling over.

A  swimming  dragon  steers  with  its  head,  tail,  and  feet.

A  dragon  swimming  at  the  surface  often  holds  its  head

and neck out of the water, which allows it to scan the surface

while most of its body remains submerged. A dragon also

occasionally swims with just the upper half of its head out of

the  water. This  restricts  the  dragons  field  of  vision  some-

what, but makes it practically undetectable.

Most  dragons  are  obliged  to  hold  their  breath  when

submerged. However, the truly aquatic types can breathe

underwater  as  easily  as  they  take  in  water  and  extract

oxygen  from  it.  The  dragon  inhales  water  through  its

nose,  and  the  water  floods  the  lungs  and  is  exhaled

through the nose. The dragon handles the process as easily

at it breathes air.

BURROWING

Any  dragon  can  gouge  out  holes  in  the  ground  with  its

claws,  but  some  dragons  can  also  worm  their  way

through sand or loose earth, moving as quickly as a

human can move at a brisk walk.

Burrowing dragons

tend to have shorter,

thicker  necks  than

other dragons, stub-

bier legs, and wedge-

shaped  heads.  When

burrowing, the drag-

on  pushes  with  its

head  and  uses  its

front feet to claw away

material.  The  back  legs

kick  the  loosened  mate-

rial  back  past  the  dragons

body. The tunnel the dragon

makes when burrowing usually

collapses behind it.

COMBAT ABILITIES

Battle is a dragons natural element; it is made for combat. It has

teeth like spears, claws like scimitars, wings like hammers, and a

tail like a battering ram. Lesser beings cower in its presence, and its

breath fells armies.

 Munwithurix, red dragon

The vanity of dragons is legendary. Indeed, they have much

to boast about, including a fearsome array of natural weap-

onry and a host of more subtle abilities that make them all

but invincible in combat.

BREATH WEAPONS

The most infamous weapon in a dragons formidable arse-

nal  is  its  devastating  breath. The  chromatic  dragons  can

produce  blasts  of  elemental  energy;  the  type  of  energy

varies with the kind of dragon. The metallic dragons can

produce elemental breath weapons, too, but they also pro-

duce a second type of breath that is nonlethal but potent

in its own way.

No matter what form its breath weapon takes, a dragon

generates it from deep inside its lungs, using energy gen-

erated  from  an  organ  near  its  heart  called  the  draconis

fundamentum (page 8). Fortunately for dragon hunters, a

dragon  cannot  produce  breath  weapon  effects  continu-

ously. Each breath depletes the dragons inner reserves of

energy, and it usually requires at least a few seconds to pro-

duce another breath.

:

To use its

breath weapon,

the dragon first draws a very

deep inhalation. If sufficient energy is avail-

able, the dragon immediately expels the weapon in a

violent exhalation. If not, the dragon must wait until more

energy builds up. The effect is not unlike a blacksmith fan-

ning a fire that is slightly too small. A puff of air from the

bellows  produces  intense  heat,  but  burns  up  all  the  fires

fuel, forcing the smith to add more fuel before fanning the

flame again. A dragon seems to remain aware of the state of

its inner energy and never tries to use its breath weapon too

soon. Dragons, however, do not seem to have much control

over how quickly their inner energy replenishes itself.

A dragon can discharge its breath weapon with little or no

forewarning. Some dragons are adept at convincing timor-

ous foes that a breath could come at any moment.

21

FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE

The  mere  appearance  of  a  dragon  can  send  pack  animals

fleeing in terror and shake the resolve of the most stalwart

soldier. Usually, a dragon must be of at least young adult age

to have this power.

Though some commentators speak of dragons inspiring

supernatural fear, a dragons frightful presence has no mag-

ical component. Dragons are simply very good at striking

fear in the hearts of foes, and they can do so whenever they

take any action that is the least bit aggressive.

IMMUNITIES AND DEFENSES

Though most forms of attack have at least a slim chance of

working against a dragon, some attacks prove useless.

True dragons have superb internal temperature regulation

and seldom suffer from the effects of excessive heat or cold.

In  addition,  all  draconic  creatures  are  not  subject  to  ef-

fects that put them to sleep or induce paralysis; such crea-

tures possess an unstoppable vitality.

True dragons also develop a supernatural resistance to

physical  blows,  which  can  prevent  nonmagical  weapons

from  harming  them  at  all.  Bards  tales  about  marauding

dragons  enduring  hails  of  arrows  from  defending  archers

without suffering so much as a scratch are all too true.

Thanks to their innately magical nature, true dragons also

develop the power to shrug off the effects of spells. Older

dragons ignore spell assaults from all but the most powerful

magical practitioners.

Every true dragon is immune to at least one type of ele-

mental  energy  (acid,  cold,  electricity,  or  fire),  usually  the

same  type  of  energy  as  the  dragon  uses  for  its  breath

weapon. This immunity stems from the dragons elemental

nature. The same power that allows it to belch forth a blast

of energy also keeps that energy from harming the dragon.

A  dragons  innate  magical  abilities  tend  to  reflect  the

character  and  attitudes  of  its  species.  For  example,  black

pqqqqrs

MAGICAL ABILITIES

All  dragons  develop  innate  magical  abilities  as  they  age.

Among these is the ability to cast arcane spells.

RULES: BREATH WEAPONS

A dragons breath weapon is a supernatural ability. It does not

work in antimagic areas. Using a breath weapon is a standard

action. As noted in the Monster Manual, when a dragon uses a

breath weapon, it must wait 1d4 rounds before it can breathe

again. In this case, a round lasts until the dragons next turn

begins  (see  The  Combat  Round,  page  138  of  the  Players

Handbook). For example, if a dragon breathes in the first round

of combat, and the die roll for when the breath weapon can next

be used is a 1, the dragon can breathe again in round 2. If the

die roll is a 4, the dragon could not breathe again until round 5.

If a dragon has more than one type of breath weapon, it still

can  breathe  only  once  every  1d4  rounds.  The  Recover  Breath

feat (see page 73) can shorten the time a dragon has to wait

between uses of its breath weapon.

The  size,  shape,  and  effect  of  a  breath  weapon  depends

on  the kind of dragon and its size and age, as given in the

Monster Manual.

RULES: FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE

A  dragons  frightful  presence  is  an  extraordinary  ability.  It

works even in antimagic areas.

Frightful presence is a mind-affecting fear ability that takes

effect whenever a dragon attacks, charges, or merely flies over-

head.  A  dragon  can  inspire  fear  by  flying  overhead  at  an  alti-

tude  low  enough  to  place  foes  with  the  radius  of  the  effect,

which is 30 feet  the dragons age category (usually at least

150 feet, since most dragons gain this ability at the young adult

stage). A dragons frightful presence also takes effect whenever

the dragon charges or attacks in any way (with natural weapons,

spells, or a breath weapon).

Using frightful presence is part of whatever action triggers it.

A  dragon  does  not  have  to  take  a  separate  action  to  use  the

power; however, a dragon can suppress its frightful presence

ability as a free action.

total concealment, the ability does not work. Once the ability

takes  effect,  however,  the  consequences  persist  for  the  full

duration, even if the dragon later passes from sight. Creatures

within the abilitys radius are not affected if they have more Hit

Dice than the dragon, or if they are dragons themselves.

A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save

(DC 10 + 1/2 dragons HD + dragons Cha modifier) remains

immune to that dragons frightful presence for 24 hours. (This

temporary  immunity  occurs  only  on  a  successful  save.  If  a

creature doesnt have to make a save because it cannot see the

dragon, it is not immune and must make a save when it does

see  the  dragon.)  On  a  failure,  creatures  with  4  or  fewer  HD

become  panicked  for  4d6  rounds,  and  those  with  5  or  more

HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.

As an extraordinary ability, frightful presence remains effec-

tive even when the dragon assumes a different form. Bronze,

gold, and silver dragons, which have the ability to assume an

alternate form, usually suppress their frightful presence ability

when  using  assumed  forms,  to  avoid  compromising  their

disguises. If they wish to avoid fighting, however, they can use

their  frightful  presence  ability  if  they  are  challenged  when  in

their assumed forms.

RULES: DRAGON IMMUNITIES

Every kind of true dragon has immunity to at least one type of

energy, as noted in the Monster Manual.

A true dragon ignores the detrimental effects of extreme heat

(110F  to  140F)  and  of  extreme  cold  (0F  to  40F).  A  true

dragon  in  these  conditions  does  not  have  to  make  a  Fortitude

save every 10 minutes to avoid taking nonlethal damage.

All creatures of the dragon type are immune to magic sleep

and paralysis effects, also as noted in the Monster Manual.

True  dragons  develop  damage  reduction  as  they  age,  as

noted  in  the  Monster  Manual.  Damage  reduction  is  a  super-

natural ability and is ineffective in an antimagic field.

A  creature  must  be  able  to  see  the  dragon  for  its  frightful

presence ability to take effect. If the dragon is invisible or has

dragons  prefer  damp  and  dismal  swamps,  and  they  also

have the ability to create magical darkness. Copper drag-

ons live in rocky hills and have the ability to shape stone.

Often a dragons innate abilities have little direct impact on

combat, but the dragon can use them to defend its lair or

to prepare for battle.

A dragons spells tend to reflect its own personality. Each

dragon  develops  a  unique  personal  repertoire  of  spells

(though many dragons choose similar spells for their sheer

utility).  No  scholar  has  determined  how  dragons  accom-

plish  this,  and  it  seems  that  dragons  themselves  dont

know  how  they  do  it.  Dragons  simply  have  an  inborn

talent for arcane magic. They develop rudimentary spell-

casting  powers  as  they  approach  adulthood.  Humanoid

sorcerers,  who  often  claim  their  magical  powers  stem

from a dragon ancestor, usually do not develop any magi-

cal aptitude until after puberty. Some scholars take this as

a  sign  that  no  connection  at  all  exists  between  sorcerers

and  dragons.  Other  scholars  dismiss  the  disparity  as  an

inevitable result of the vast differences between draconic

and humanoid life cycles.

In any case, dragons exhibit a talent that sorcerers lack:

They can cast most of their spells

without the physical props other

spellcasters find necessary.

NATURAL ARMOR AND WEAPONRY

A dragons panoply of overlapping scales backed by layers of

hide and muscle and supported by a strong, resilient skeleton

offers considerable protection from attack. Even a Tiny dragon

is typically as well armored as a human wearing chainmail.

A big dragons scaly hide provides four or five times more

protection than the best suit of plate armor can offer.

A dragons primary weapon in physical combat is its bite.

A dragon can bite at creatures a fair distance way, thanks to

its long neck.

A  dragons  claws  are  not  as  fearsome  as  its  bite,  and  a

dragon on the move often does not use its claws, but anyone

fighting  a  dragon  should  be  wary  of  them  nevertheless.

A  dragon  of  roughly  human  size  or  larger  can  strike

effectively with the alar limbs at the forward edges of its

wings. Though the alar limbs have vestigial claws, the wing

is a bludgeoning weapon. A dragon usually keeps the fin-

gers  supporting  the  wing  closed  to  avoid  damaging  the

wing, much like a human clenches his fist when deliver-

ing a punch. A dragons wings may span hundreds of feet

when they are fully extended, but it uses only a fairly small

portion of the wing as a weapon.

A  dragon  of  larger  than

human size can use its tail

RULES: MAGICAL ABILITIES

As  noted  in  the  Monster  Manual,  creatures  with  innate  spell-

casting abilities, such as dragons, do not require material com-

ponents to cast their spells. If a spell has a focus, however, a

dragon or other innate spellcaster must have the focus on its

person. Dragons can use the Embed Spell Focus feat to satisfy

this requirement.

Except  for  not  needing  consumable  material  components,

dragons cast their spells in the same way other arcane spell-

casters do. They are subject to arcane spell failure if they wear

armor.  (Their  own  natural  armor  does  not  impose  an  arcane

spell failure chance.) They must provide any verbal and somatic

components the spell has, and they must pay any XP cost the

spell entails. A dragon typically has a cushion of 100 to 600 XP

times  its  spellcaster  level.  It  can  use  these  XP  in  spellcasting

without risking the loss of a level.

Also as noted in the Monster Manual, a dragons caster level

for  its  spell-like  abilities  is  equal  to  its  age  category  or  its

sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher.

Although  dragons  cast  spells  as  sorcerers,  they  are  not

members of the sorcerer class and receive none of that classs

benefits (except for spellcasting). A dragon gains bonus spells

each day for a high Charisma score. A dragon that becomes a

member of the sorcerer class adds any actual sorcerer levels it

has to its effective sorcerer level to determine its spellcasting

ability, but uses its actual sorcerer level and character level to

determine  its  other  class  abilities.  For  example,  an  old  silver

dragon  casts  spells  as  an  11th-level  sorcerer.  If  the  dragon

becomes  a  1st-level  sorcerer,  it  casts  spells  as  a  12th-level

sorcerer,  but  its  familiar  (if  it  has  one)  has  the  abilities  of  a

familiar with a 1st-level master.

As noted in the Monster Manual, most of a dragons spell-

like abilities function as the spells of the same name cast at a

level  equal  to  the  dragons  sorcerer  level  or  its  age  category,

whichever is higher.

A  dragon  with  the  alternate  form  racial  ability  is  proficient

with  all  simple  weapons.  Other  kinds  of  dragons  have  no

weapon proficiencies unless they actually have levels in a char-

acter class or they use feats to become proficient.

RULES: DRAGONS AND MAGIC ITEMS

Being both very smart and very wealthy, dragons often employ

magic items.

A younger dragon without any spellcasting abilityeven if it

has one or more spell-like abilitiescannot use spell comple-

tion items or spell trigger items.

An older dragon casts spells as a sorcerer and is an arcane

spellcaster; it cannot cast a divine spell from a scroll unless it

has levels in a divine spellcasting class.

Because a dragon can cast spells as a sorcerer, it can use any

spell trigger item that produc es the effect of a sorcerer/wizard

spell. If the dragon also can cast cleric spells as arcane spells,

it can use any spell trigger item that produc es the effect of a

spell from the cleric spell list or a spell from a domain to which

the dragon has access.

earlier, a dragon with the alternate form racial ability is profi-

cient with all simple weapons).

Any  dragon  is  capable  of  using  potions.  In  most  circum-

stances, a dragon doesnt even bother opening a potion con-

tainer; it simply swallows it or chews it up. Because a dragon

can eat just about anything, this doesnt cause any problems

for the dragon, nor does it change the effect of the potion in

any way.

Because  magic  items  that  must  be  worn  will  fit  users  of

any size, a dragon can use any magic item a humanoid char-

acter can.

A dragon can use a headband, hat, or helmet normally. In

some cases, an item of this kind can be specially made for a

dragon  in  the  form  of  a  crown,  diadem,  or  skullcap.  For

example, a dragons helm of telepathy may be in the form of a

skullcap of telepathy.

Goggles and lenses made for dragons usually come in the

form  of  cusps  that  fit  over  the  dragons  eyes,  or  lenses  the

dragon places directly on its eyes, much like modern contact

lenses. A humanoid character can use any special dragon item

of this kind without difficulty.

A  dragon  can  wear  a  cloak,  cape,  or  mantle  on  its  back,

usually between the wings. Items of this sort can come in the

form of a frill stud or spine cap instead. A humanoid character

can use a frill stud or spine cap by affixing it to a cloak, cape,

or mantle.

A  dragon  wears  amulets,  brooches,  medallions,  necklaces,

and periapts around its neck, just as a humanoid does.

A dragon is not proficient with any kind of armor and usually

does not bother wearing armor. In any case, armor crafted for

a humanoid does not fit a dragons body. Armor created for a

dragon resembles barding and will not fit a humanoid, but will

fit a quadruped of the same size as the dragon.

A  dragon  can  wear  a  robe  over  its  shoulders  and  upper

chest. In some cases, a item of this kind can be specially made

for a dragon in the form of a collar or epaulette. A humanoid

can wear such an item without difficulty.

A dragon can wear a vest, vestment, or shirt draped around

its wings and lower chest. In some cases, a item of this kind

can  be  specially  made  for  a  dragon  in  the  form  of  a  pectoral

stud or a belly stud. A humanoid can wear a magical dragon

pectoral stud as though it were a vest. It can wear a belly stud

in its navel.

A dragon can fit bracers or bracelets over its lower forelimbs.

A  dragon  can  wear  gloves  or  gauntlets  on  its  forefeet.

Specially made dragon gauntlets usually have no fingers, just

holes  for  the  dragons  claws.  A  humanoid  can  wear  magical

dragon gauntlets without difficulty.

A dragon can wear rings on its front claws.

A  dragon  can  wear  a  belt  around  its  midsection.  Some-

times, items of this kind take the form of bands the dragon

wears on its hips. A humanoid can wear such items without

difficulty.

A dragon usually lacks weapon proficiencies and fully prehen-

sile  appendages,  so  it  cannot  employ  weapons.  If  a  dragon

assumes a form with prehensile appendages, it can wield weap-

ons while in that form, but it remains nonproficient unless it

has lvels in a class or a feat that makes it proficient (as noted

pqqqqrs

A dragon can wear boots on its hind feet. Specially made

dragon boots usually resemble a dragons gauntlets, but are

shaped for the hind foot. These magic items also fit human-

oid feet.

None of these items interferes with a dragons movement,

including flight.

to deliver powerful blows. To do so, the dragon curls the tip

of its tail upward and uses the upturned portion as a bludg-

eoning weapon. The biggest dragons have enough power in

their tails to sweep them from side to side, knocking over

smaller foes.

Very  big  dragons  also  can  use  their  entire  bodies  as

weapons,  crashing  into  smaller  opponents  and  pinning

them to the ground, whereupon the dragon literally grinds

them into the dirt.

DRAGON WEAKNESSES

Weakness? Come test thy mettle against me, hairless ape, and we

shall know who is weak!

 Lothaenorixius, blue dragon

As formidable at they are, dragons have a few vulnerabilities

their foes can exploit.

Dragons often prove susceptible to attacks involving an

opposing element. For example, red dragons are immune to

fire but vulnerable to cold.

A dragons elemental nature also makes it susceptible to

the  divine  influence  wielded  by  certain  clerics,  who  can

drive them off, compel them to render service, or even kill

them  outright.  Dragons,  however,  become  very  powerful

entities as they age, and the influence of such clerics only

proves reliable against younger dragons.

OUTLOOK AND

PSYCHOLOGY

A good answer today is better than the perfect answer tomorrow.

Human aphorism

Whats your hurry?

Common dragon response

to the aforementioned aphorism

The most important element shaping a dragons outlook and

state of mind is time. Dragons have no desire to live for the

moment; they have a vast supply of moments stretching out

before them. They do not worry about wasted time. If drag-

ons have anything in excess, it is time, and they do not con-

cern themselves with haste.

Even  the  dullards  among  dragonkind  seek  to  fill  their

time by exercising their minds. Solving puzzles is a favorite

activity, though the form these puzzles take depends on the

kind of dragon involved. Some, such as the bronze and the

copper,  seek  out  challenging  puzzles  of  a  benign  nature.

Others, such as the red and the blue, contemplate a much

darker brand of conundrums. They plot ways to satisfy their

greed,  to  defeat  opponents,  and  to  gain  power  over  other

creatures. Many scholars believe that dragons owe their nat-

ural aptitude for magic to the mental games they constantly

play just to keep themselves occupied.

Many  dragons  also  seek  knowledge  for  its  own  sake.

Older dragons often become repositories of ancient wisdom

and lore.

Humanoid  adventurers  usually  seek  fame  and  fortune

through three stages of their lives (adolescence, adulthood,

and middle age). Even the longest-lived elf attempts to cram

the bulk of his accomplishments into these phases of life.

Dragons, on the other hand, through desire and necessity,

seek fame and fortune from the moment they emerge from

the  egg  to  the  day  they  finally  succumb  to  times  eroding

waves. Because it spreads its life activities out across its very

long life span, a dragon takes much longer breaks between

quests and adventures than a group of humanoid adventur-

ers would take.

If  a  dragon  were  to  join  a  group  of  adventurers,  it  might

remain interested long enough to complete one or two quests.

Then  something  else  might  catch  its  interest,  and  it  would

leave for years to engage in another activity. Upon returning,

it would discover its former companions to be nearing retire-

ment or already too old to go questing. The dragon, however,

would  still  be  young  and  vital,  and  growing  stronger  with

each passing year. Although it would feel sadness at the loss

of  its  companions,  it  would  move  on  to  new  challenges.

All true dragons have great patience. They seldom hurry

or rush, because they believe anything worth doing is worth

doing right. For a dragon, doing something right usually

involves  spending  a  long  time  (from  the  viewpoint  of

shorter-lived beings) contemplating the next step.

A  dragons  longevity  is  perhaps  the  major  source  of  its

vanity and arrogance. A single dragon can watch a parade of

beings come and go during its long life. How can a dragon

consider  such  creatures  as  anything  more  than  inferiors

when it watches so many of them enter life, grow old, and

die? And all the while, the dragon grows stronger and more

powerful, proving its superiority (if only in its own mind).

Dragons  hold  at  bay  the  powerful  entity  of  time,  whereas

lesser creatures succumb and fade with nary a struggle. With

such power at its command, is it any wonder that a dragon

believes itself to be the very pinnacle of creation?

pqqqqrs

RULES: DRAGON WEAKNESSES

A dragon is vulnerable to the type of energy that opposes its

elemental subtype, as noted in the Monster Manual. A dragon

takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from at-

tacks involving its opposing energy type, regardless of whether

a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

The  feats  Overcome  Weakness  and  Suppress  Weakness  (see

pages 72 and 74) reduce this vulnerability.

pqqqqrs

Clerics with access to the air, earth, fire, or water domains

can turn, destroy, rebuke, or command dragons of the appro-

priate elemental subtype. Since the effectiveness of these abil-

ities is based on the defending creatures Hit Dice, older and

larger dragons seldom fall prey to them, but they can be effec-

tive against smaller and younger dragons.

A dragon can spring into action quickly if it finds its own

life in peril, or if it must protect its mate, its offspring, or its

hoard. Otherwise, few problems seem urgent.

A dragons wrath can stretch on for many human genera-

tions, matching the creatures patience. The humanoid who

wrongs a dragon may escape its wrath by dying a natural death

before  the  dragon  gets  around  to  exacting  revenge.  The

humanoids  descendants,  however,  should  be  wary  if  they

know about the situation, because the dragon might strike at

them years or centuries after the original perpetrator has died.

DRAGON SOCIETY

Dragons never gather without purpose.

Kacdaninymila, gold dragon

Dragons keep to themselves, breaking their solitude only to

mate, rear offspring, or obtain help in meeting some threat.

Dragons of different species seldom form alliances, though

they have been known to cooperate under extreme circum-

stances, such as when a powerful mutual threat arises.

Some scholars believe dragons suffer from xeno-

phobia. This view is not far from

the truthany dragon simply

enjoys  its  own  company.

When it becomes pru-

dent or necessary to

have a companion,

a  dragon  seeks

one  out,  but  it

prefers a com-

panion  as

much  like

itself  as

possible.

Metallic  drag-

ons  of  different

species are more apt

to cooperate with each

other  than  chromatic

dragons  are,  though

only  gold  and  silver

dragons  are  known  to  forge  lasting

friendships. The loquacious brass drag-

ons enjoy the company of other metal-

lic dragons, but most dragons (even other

brass dragons) prefer to take brass dragons

in small doses. Metallic dragons never cooperate with chro-

matic dragons.

When  evil  dragons  of  different  varieties  encounter  one

another, they usually fight to protect their territories. Good

dragons are more tolerant, though also very territorial, and

usually  try  to  work  out  differences  in  a  peaceful  manner.

TERRITORY

A dragon usually claims all the territory within a days flying

time of its lair. The dragon will share this area with no other

dragons  except  its  mate  and  offspring  (if  it  has  any),  and

26

even  then,  younger  dragons  most  often  part  after  mating

and leave their eggs untended.

Though chromatic dragons are not eager to share terri-

tory, they tolerate some overlap between their territories

and those of neighboring dragons of the same species or

alignment.  These  boundary  areas  become  places  where

dragons can meet to parlay and exchange information. In

many  cases,  a  dragon  shares  overlapping  territory  with  a

mate or a potential mate.

Among dragons too young to mate, the need for security

and  defense  usually  overrides  the  desire  for  solitude.

Clutches  of  dragons  born  together  usually  stick  together

until each individual is strong enough to survive on its own

and establish its own lair.

CONFLICT AND INTERACTION BETWEEN

DRAGONS

When dragons fight, the conflict is seldom over territory. It

is much easier for a dragon to simply take wing and find an

unclaimed area than to risk injury and death in a battle with

another dragon. Dragons most often fight for the opportu-

nity to loot each others lairs. A dragons desire to amass

large amounts of treasure is legendary, even

among the dragons themselves, and

every  dragon  knows  that  a

victory  over  a  rival  is

often the best way to

gain wealth. Drag-

ons also fight over

mates  (such  contests  are

not limited to males) and

usually  try  to  kill  or

drive  away  neighbor-

ing  dragons  of  dif-

ferent alignments.

Enmity  is  par-

ticularly strong

among chromat-

ic  and  metallic  dragons

that  typically  inhabit

similar territories. Blue

dragons  and  brass

dragons, for example,

both prefer to live in

deserts  and  often

come  into  conflict.

When two or more

dragons meet and wish

to avoid a conflict, they

usually take to the air and

circle slowly, each examin-

ing the other carefully. If the

dragons are of different sizes or

ages,  these  preliminaries  end  fairly

quickly. Status among dragons comes with age. Older drag-

ons  know  they  have  little  to  fear  from  younger  dragons,

provided the senior dragon is not already injured. Younger

dragons  are  likewise  aware  that  their  older  brethren  can

slay them easily, and they know that negotiating gives them

the best chance of surviving the encounter.

If the dragons in an encounter are the same age or size,

they tend to be much more cautious, since a sudden attack

by either dragon could doom the other. The dragons might

circle each other for hours.

Once the preliminaries are over, the dragons converse. If

they remain suspicious of each other, they stay aloft, with the

older dragon or dragons slightly higher. While aloft, the drag-

ons are obliged to bellow at each other, since they cant easily

close  to  conversational  distance. Thanks  to  a  dragons  keen

ears and tremendous vocal capacity, this hindrance to com-

munication doesnt present much of a problem. If the dragons

become comfortable with one another, they often fly off to

some high, inaccessible place where they can speak in private.

MATING

A dragons attitude and approach to mating depend on its

species and its age. Dragons follow a number of reproduc-

tive strategies to suit their needs and temperaments. These

strategies help assure the continuation of a dragons blood-

line, no matter what happens to the parent or the lair.

Young  adults,  particularly  evil  or  less  intelligent  ones,

tend to lay annual clutches of eggs all around the country-

side, leaving their offspring to fend for themselves. Older

females sometimes lay eggs once a decade or even less often,

but they usually produce at least one clutch during each age

category in which they remain fertile. Often an older female

lays several clutches of eggs over successive years, keeping

one  clutch  to  tend  herself,  giving  one  clutch  to  her  mate

(who carries the eggs to a separate lair), and leaving the rest

untended. Sometimes a female dragon places eggs (or newly

hatched wyrmlings) with nondraconic foster parents.

Adult and mature adult dragons are most likely to mate

for  the  long  term  and  to  share  the  task  of  rearing  young.

Older dragons are the most likely to mate and then raise

their young on their own, and even males do so (with the

female laying her eggs in the males lair or the male carrying

the eggs to his lair). Older dragons also sometimes arrange

nondragon  surrogate  parents  for  their  offspring.  One  or

both parents visit the surrogates periodically to determine

how well they are handling the task.

Dragon  mating  is  not  all  about  reproduction,  however,

and dragons often mate out of love. This is particularly true

among  metallic  dragons,  but  love  certainly  exists  among

chromatic  dragons  as  well.  Dragons  of  lawful  alignment

often mate for life (though if one of the two dies, the other

usually  finds  a  new  mate).  Dragons  mated  for  life  do  not

always remain together. They frequently maintain separate

lairs and agree to meet at intervals. Lawful dragons are not

always  monogamous,  and  they  have  been  known  to  build

complex  intricate  living  and  breeding  arrangements  with

multiple  partners.  Such  relationships  usually  are  built

around  an  older  dragon  and  younger  mates,  and  can  be

either polygamous or polyandrous.

Chaotic  dragons  tend  to  change  mates  frequently,

though as they get older they often develop a preference for

a single mate.

Dragons are notoriously virile, able to crossbreed with vir-

tually any creature. Among metallic dragons, crossbreeding

often occurs when the dragon assumes another shape and

falls in love, however briefly, with a nondragon. Chromatic

dragons  may  simply  feel  adventuresome  and  create  cross-

breeds as a result. In either case, the dragon involved usually

is a young adult. A dragon almost always either abandons its

half-dragon offspring or leaves it in the care of its nondragon

parent.  Chromatic  dragons  typically  remain  unconcerned

about the half-dragons fate. Metallic dragons believe (usu-

ally  correctly)  that  the  half-dragon  will  fare  better  among

nondragons than it ever will among dragons.

Crossbreeds  between  dragon  species  are  not  unknown,

but very rare. A hybrid dragon of this sort is usually left to

fend for itself, but on occasion both parents (if they are on

good  terms  with  each  other)  might  watch  over  it  until  it

reaches adulthood.

WHY DO DRAGONS HOARD TREASURE?

Dragons lust for treasure because, at heart, they are nothing but

large, reptilian jackdaws.

Alrod Duart, sage

A dragon collects treasure mainly for its beautyyou dont think

there can be too much beauty, do you? Besides, some treasure is very

good eating.

Kacdaninymila, gold dragon

When one thinks of a dragon piling up treasure and using it

as a bed, its easy to accuse the creature of greed. After all,

what good is all that wealth doing anyone?

Some  sages  equate  a  dragons  desire  to  amass  treasure

with the behavior of jackdaws, pack rats, and other creatures

that instinctively hoard bright, shiny objects. This observa-

tion is not without merit, because no dragon seems entirely

able to explain why it wants to hoard treasure. Unlike a jack-

daw or a pack rat, however, a dragon craves items of mone-

tary value, not just shiny objects. Dragons are well aware of

the value of their possessions. When faced with a selection

of  treasure,  even  the  most  virtuous  dragon  would  like  to

take it all. If it has to choose, the dragon tends to favor the

most valuable items. Dragons show a preference for items

with intrinsic monetary value over items that are valuable

because of their magic.

The sheer, primal joy a dragon derives from its hoard is

nearly indescribable. In unguarded moments, a dragon will

roll in a pile of treasure like a pig wallowing in the mud on

a hot day, and the dragon seems to derive a similar degree of

physical pleasure from the action.

A dragon also derives immense intellectual satisfaction from

its hoard. It keeps an accurate mental inventory of the items in

it,  and  a  running  total  of  the  hoards  total  monetary  value.

The draconic preoccupation with treasure doubtless has an

instinctive element that may never be fully explained, but

treasure hoarding among dragons has some practical benefits.

First, having a valuable treasure at hand gives the dragon

some control over the circumstances of its own death (see

Avoiding  the  Twilight,  page  15).  Dragons  that  lose  their

hoards  often  suffer  so  much  emotional  trauma  that  their

spirits become restless even after death (see Ghostly Dragon,

page 161).

Second,  and  more  important,  dragons  derive  status

among  their  own  kind  from  the  richness  of  their  hoards.

Though  the  primary  measure  of  status  among  dragons  is

age, the value of a dragons hoard is what determines the rel-

ative status of dragons of the same age (when comparing

hoard  values,  dragons  consider  magic  items  to  be  worth

one-half their market value). A particularly large hoard can

place a younger dragon on equal terms with an older dragon;

a small one can demote it to an even lower status than its age

alone would indicate.

pqs

DRAGONS AND THE APPRAISE SKILL

Though most dragons do not have the Appraise skill, dragons

can  appraise  items  readily,  thanks  to  their  high  Intelligence

scores. A dragon gains a +2 competence bonus on any Appraise

check (or Intelligence check made to appraise an item) that

involves studying physical aspects of the appraised item (such

as fine details or weight).

pqs

Dragons with higher status have better access to mates.

They  have  more  influence  among  other  dragons,  and  are

more likely to be asked to render assistance or advice. This

in turn increases their status even more.

Dragons  tend  to  boast  about  the  value  of  their  hoards

among  their  own  kind,  which  is  understandable,  since  a

dragon cannot derive any status from its hoard unless other

dragons know about it. Such boasting is not without peril,

however, particularly among chromatic dragons, since evil

dragons are not above stealing treasure from each other.

Among  older  dragons,  treasure  hoarding  has  an  addi-

tional  practical  dimension.  As  a  dragon  ages,  its  magical

aptitude gets greater, and the dragon becomes better able to

employ the magic items in its hoard to its advantage.

LANGUAGE

The language of dragons is one of the oldest forms of com-

munication.  According  to  the  dragons  themselves,  it  is

second in longevity only to the languages of the outsiders,

and all mortal tongues are descended from it. Its script was

likely created long after its spoken form was standardized,

since dragons have less need to write than other races. Some

scholars believe the written form of Draconic might have

been  influenced  by  dwarven  runes,  but  the  wise  dont

express this opinion within hearing of a dragon.

Many  reptilian  races  (including  kobolds,  lizardfolk,

and  troglodytes)  speak  crude  versions  of  Draconic,  and

present this as proof of their kinship with dragons. It is

equally  likely  that  these  races  were  once  taught  or

enslaved by dragons, and it is even possible that they took

Draconic  for  their  own  simply  to  make  a  claim  to  com-

mon ancestors.

The Draconic script is also used when a written form is

needed for the elemental languages Auran and Ignan. How-

ever, this use of the written form does not make it any easier

for someone who knows Draconic to learn the languages of

air and fire creatures.

Slight variations exist in the language used by the various

kinds of chromatic dragons. These differences are similar to

regional accents, with some slight differences in pronunci-

ation  from  one  version  to  the  next.  The  accents  do  not

hamper  communication,  but  they  are  sufficiently  obvious

for a native speaker to know whether someone learned to

speak Draconic from (for instance) a red dragon or a green

dragon. The various metallic dragons have similar accents,

but without any differences in pronunciation. The Draconic

language has not changed significantly for hundreds, if not

thousands, of years.

The spoken form of the language sounds harsh to most

other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and

sibilants. It includes sounds that humans generally describe

as hissing (sj, ss, and sv), as well as a noise that sounds a great

deal like a beast clearing its throat (ach).

Words that modify other words are placed before and after

the word they modify. The most important modifier is always

placed before the word, and it might be placed directly after

the word as well if additional emphasis is desired. A speaker

of Draconic who wanted to say a big, black, evil dragon was

approaching and doubly emphasize its evil nature would say,

Malsvir  darastrix  turalisj  vutha  gethrisj  leirith  or  even

Malsvir  darastrix  turalisj  vutha  malsvir  gethrisj  leirith.

Most Draconic words are spoken with emphasis on the

first syllable. Important ideas are often expressed in spoken

Draconic by emphasizing the beginning and the end of the

word.  In  the  written  form,  important  words  are  marked

with a special symbol of five lines radiating outward, similar

to an asterisk (*). This form of emphasis is most often used

by dragons when referring to themselves. The dragon Kara-

jix,  for  example,  might  pronounce  his  name  Ka-raj-ix and

write  it  as  *Karajix*. This  form  of  emphasis  is  also  some-

times  used  when  commanding,  threatening,  warning,  or

making a point.

Draconic has no specific word for my or mine, instead

using several prefixes depending on the exact meaning. The

name of a physical object claimed as a possession by a dragon

speaker would begin with veth or vethi; the name of an

individual with a relationship to the dragon (such as a friend

or relative) is expressed by the prefix er or ethe; and all

other  forms  of  possessiveness  are  represented  by  putting

ar or ari before a word. Thus, for a dragon to say my sword

or the sword is mine he need only say vethicaex (vethi

plus caex, the word for sword), and arirlym translates as

my enemy (ar plus irlym, the word for enemy). When

indicating possession by another, the name of the possessor

is  combined  with  the  object  possessed  into  a  single  word

that starts with ar or ari.

Mialee, talk to the ugly elf.

Mialee, ukris vaecaesin nurh.

The elf says the magic sword we want is in the lichs tomb.

Vaecaesin  ner  levex  caex  levex  yth  tuor  persvek  arikaegrowaere.

Hell  take  us  to  the  mountain  of  the  tomb  if  we  pay  him.

Vaecaesin tuor aurix clax yth ekess ariloexokarthel verthicha.

The cave is evil and dangerous. We should go.

Sauriv waere korth. Yth *gethrisj*.

Shut up you stupid coward! Get in there!

Thric ner, *pothoc* wux faessi! *Gethrisj* persvek!

Tordek, hit the orc with your axe.

Tordek, vargach ghik mrith aritordekgarunt.

A red dragon! Scram!

Charir *darastrix*! *Osvith*!

Krusk is dead. He died with much bravery.

Krusk loex. Loreat mrith *sveargith*.

RELIGION

The  dragon  deities  are  all  children  of  Io,  the  Ninefold

Dragon who encompasses all the opposites and extremes

of dragonkind.

Creatures other than dragons can worship one of the deities

described here. Just as a human weaponsmith might venerate

Moradin, or an elf archer pay homage to Ehlonna, so too could

a dwarf, half-orc, or kobold worship a god or goddess otherwise

associated with dragons. In fact, such worship is particularly

common  among  the  various  reptilian  (and  Draconic-

speaking) races, such as kobolds, lizardfolk, and troglodytes.

Name: The first line gives the name by which the deity is

generally  known.  Other  names  or  titles  attributed  to  the

deity (if any) are given immediately below the name.

Following  the  name  is  the  deitys  level  of  power.  In  de-

scending order, the levels of power are greater deity, inter-

mediate deity, lesser deity, and demigod. These rankings do

not affect the abilities of clerics, the power of the spells they

cast, or most anything in the mortal world. They represent

the relative levels of power among deities only.

Home Plane: The portion of the cosmos where the deity

usually resides. Feel free to change these home planes as

appropriate to your campaign.

Symbol: A short description of the holy or unholy symbol

carried  by  the  deitys  clerics. This  symbol  is  often  used  on

altars or other items dedicated to the deity.

Alignment: The  deitys  alignment.  Deities  follow  the

same alignments as mortals do; see pages 104106 of the

Players Handbook.

Portfolio: The aspects of mortal existence with which the

deity is most often associated. Portfolio elements are listed

roughly in their order of importance to the deity.

Worshipers: Those  who  worship  or  venerate  the  deity,

listed roughly in order of their number and importance to

the deity.

Cleric Alignments: What alignments the deitys clerics

can have. As noted in the Players Handbook, a cleric typi-

cally has the same alignment as his deity. Some clerics are

one step away from their respective deitys alignment. For

example, most clerics of Heironeous (who is lawful good)

are lawful good themselves, but some are lawful neutral or

neutral good. A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity

is neutral.

Two alignments are within one step of each other if they

appear adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically on

the  following  chart.  Alignments  that  are  adjacent  to  each

other on a diagonal are not within one step.

Lawful good

Lawful neutral

Lawful evil

Neutral good

Neutral

Chaotic good

Some deities do not accept clerics of all alignments that

are within one step of their own. For example, Bahamut, a

lawful good deity, has lawful good and neutral good clerics

but does not allow lawful neutral clerics.

Domains: Clerics of the deity can choose from among the

domains  listed  here.  Domains  marked  with  an  asterisk

Dragon, Greed, and Wealthare new domains described in

this book (see page 107).

Domains that appear in parentheses are described in the

FORGOTTEN REALMS Campaign Setting. If your campaign is set

in that world, you can add these domains to the deitys list

(possibly replacing other domains if desired).

Favored Weapon: The kind of weapon the deity favors.

The deitys clerics generally prefer to use this weapon, and

certain spells that clerics cast, such as spiritual weapon, may

have effects that resemble this weapon.

The favored weapon line usually contains two entries. The

first is for weapon-wielding clerics, while the parenthetical

is for dragon clerics who dont wield weapons.

Descriptive Text

Immediately following the line-item deity entries is informa-

tion about what the deity looks like and other general facts.

Dogma: The basic tenets of the deitys creed or teachings.

Clergy and Temples: This text gives details of how the

deitys clerics act and the types of temples or shrines that are

dedicated to the deity. It also describes any particular alliances

or enmities between that faith and others.

Aasterinian is a cheeky deity who enjoys learning through

play, invention, and pleasure. She is Ios messenger, a Huge

brass dragon who enjoys disturbing the status quo.

Dogma

Aasterinian  is  flighty  and  quick-witted.  She  encourages

her followers to think for themselves, rather than relying

on the word of others. The worst crime, in Aas-

terinians  eyes,  is  not  trusting  in  yourself  and

your own devices.

Clergy and Temples

Aasterinians clerics are

typically wanderers who

travel  in  disguise  or

secrecy. Temples to the

goddess  are  rare  in  the

extreme, though simple

shrines  dot  the  landscapequiet,

hidden places where worshipers can rest

peacefully on their travels.

Her followers enjoy friendly relations

with those of Garl Glittergold, Fharlanghn, Olidammara,

and similar deities.

ASTILABOR

The Acquisitor, Hoardmistress

Lesser Deity

Symbol: A twelve-faceted gem

Home Plane: Outlands

Alignment: Neutral

Portfolio: Acquisitiveness, status, wealth

Worshipers: Dragons, those who seek wealth

Cleric  Alignments: NG,  LN, N,

CN, NE

Domains: Dragon*, Protection,

Wealth* (Cavern, Metal)

Favored  Weapon: Scimitar

(claw)

Astilabor represents the natu-

ral  draconic  desire  to  acquire

treasure and power. She dislikes

the  naked  greed  displayed  by

Tiamat and her followers.

Dogma

Astilabor values wealth and power, but with-

out any stigma of greed. She instills in dragonkind the innate

need for collecting and protecting the hoard. She claims that

she cannot abide thievery of any kind from her worshipers,

but often turns a blind eye if such acts are performed in the

name of building ones hoard.

Clergy and Temples

Astilabor accepts only clerics with a neutral aspect to their

alignments, the better to remain pure to the goal of acquir-

ing and protecting the hoard. Her clerics prefer not to get

32

involved  in  conflicts  between  dragons,  but  often  reward

those whose hoards become large and valuable.

Astilabor  is  revered  by  dragons  of  all  types  and  align-

ments, but actively worshiped by few. Most at least scratch

out her symbol as a protective ward over their hoards.

Astilabors  worshipers  are  friendly  toward  those  of

Moradin and Garl Glittergold (since those gods respect

the value of a gem or coin as much as anyone), but they

distrust followers of Olidammara, whom they believe

to be thieves at heart.

BAHAMUT

The Platinum Dragon, King of the Good Dragons, Lord of

the North Wind

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Star above a milky nebula

Home Plane: Celestia

Alignment:

Lawful good

Portfolio: Good

dragons, wind,

wisdom

Worshipers: Good

protection

dragons

Cleric Alignments: LG, NG

Domains:  Air,  Dragon*,  Good,  Luck,  Protection  (Nobility,

Storm)

Favored Weapon: Heavy pick (bite)

Bahamut is revered in many locales. Though all good drag-

ons pay homage to Bahamut, gold, silver, and brass dragons

hold  him  in  particularly  high  regard.  Other  dragons,

even evil ones (except perhaps his archrival Tiamat),

respect Bahamut for his wisdom and power.

In  his  natural  form,  Bahamut  is  a  long,  sinuous

dragon covered in silver-white scales that sparkle and

gleam even in the dimmest light. Bahamuts catlike

eyes are deep blue, as azure as a midsummer sky, some

say.  Others  insist  that  Bahamuts  eyes  are  a  frosty

indigo,  like  the  heart  of  a  glacier.  Perhaps  the  two

merely  reflect  the  Platinum  Dragons  shifting  moods.

Dogma

Bahamut is stern and very disapproving of evil. He brooks

no excuses for evil acts. In spite of this, he is among the most

compassionate  beings  in  the  multiverse.  He  has  limitless

empathy  for  the  downtrodden,  the  dispossessed,  and  the

helpless.  He  urges  his  followers  to  promote  the  cause  of

good, but prefers to let beings fight their own battles when

they can. To Bahamut, it is better to offer information, heal-

ing, or a (temporary) safe refuge rather than to take others

burdens upon oneself.

Bahamut is served by seven great gold wyrms that often

accompany him.

Clergy and Temples

Bahamut accepts only good clerics. Clerics of Bahamut, be

they  dragons,  half-dragons,  or  other  beings  attracted  to

Bahamuts philosophy, strive to take constant but subtle action

on behalf of good, intervening wherever they are needed but

trying to do as little harm as possible in the process.

Many  gold,  silver,  and  brass  dragons  maintain  simple

shrines to Bahamut in their lairs, usually nothing more elab-

orate than Bahamuts symbol scribed on a wall.

Uncaring shares a similar outlook, but neither deity cares

enough to forge an alliance.

FALAZURE

The Night Dragon

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Draconic skull

Home Plane: Hades

Alignment: Neutral evil

Bahamuts  chief  foe  is  Tiamat,  and  this  enmity  is

Portfolio: Decay, undeath, exhaustion

reflected  in  their  worshipers.  His  allies  include

Heironeous, Moradin, Yondalla, and other

lawful good deities.

CHRONEPSIS

The Silent, The Watcher

Lesser Deity

Symbol: An unblinking draconic

eye

Home Plane: Outlands

Alignment: Neutral

Portfolio: Fate, death, judgment

Worshipers:  Dragons,  those  who

would observe

Cleric Alignments: N

Domains: Death, Dragon*, Knowledge (Fate, Planning, Time)

Favored Weapon: Scythe (claw)

Dogma

Worshipers: Evil dragons, necromancers, undead

Cleric Alignments: LE, NE, CE

Domains: Death,  Dragon*,  Evil  (Darkness,

Undeath)

Favored Weapon: Scimitar (claw)

The  terrifying  Night  Dragon,

Falazure, is neutral evil. He is the

lord of energy draining, undeath,

decay,  and  exhaustion.  Some

claim he has a decaying skeletal

form,  but  others  believe  that

he  looks  like  a  decrepit  black

dragon whose flesh is pulled tight

over his bones.

Chronepsis  is  neutralsilent,  unconcerned,  and  dispas-

sionate. He is the draconic deity of fate, death, and judg-

ment.  His  form  is  colorless  and  without  luster,  marking

him as an outsider to the struggles of the chromatic and

metallic dragons.

Falazure teaches that even a dragons long life span need not

be the limit to a dragons existence. Beyond the world of the

living is another realm, one of undeath eternal. It is gener-

ally accepted that Falazure created (or had a hand in the cre-

ation  of )  the  first  undead  dragons,  such  as  dracoliches,

vampiric  dragons,  and  ghostly  dragons  (see  Chapter  4).

Dogma

Chronepsis  is  a  passionless  observer  of  the

world. He passes judgment on all drag-

ons when they die, deciding where

their  souls  go  in  the  afterlife.

Unlike  Lendys  (see  below),

Chronepsis  is  uninterested  in

justice:  he  merely  observes

what is and is not. He is also

singularly  uninvolved  in

the  activities  of  the  living,

and strives to remain so. It

is said that only a cataclysm

of  world-shaking  proportions

could rouse Chronepsis from

his disinterest.

Clergy and Temples

Chronepsis has very few active wor-

shipers  and  even  fewer  clerics,  since  most

dragons  dont  possess  the  balanced  outlook  to  avoid

interfering in the events they observe.

The followers of Chronepsis count other faiths neither as

allies  nor  enemies.  Of  the  other  deities,  only  Boccob  the

Clergy and Temples

Among the draconic gods, perhaps

only Bahamut and Tiamat have

more  nondragon  worshipers

than Falazure. Many necro-

mancers  of  all  races  revere

the  Night  Dragon,  as  well  as

intelligent undead such as liches

and,  especially,  dracoliches.

Temples to Falazure are always

deep beneath the earth, cloaked

in darkness and far from the sun

and  fresh  air  of  the  surface  world.

The followers of Falazure count

all members of good-aligned faiths

as  their  enemies.  They  may  occa-

sionally ally with the forces of Nerull,

but such instances are rare.

GARYX

Firelord,  All-Destroyer,  Cleanser  of  Worlds

Lesser Deity

Symbol: Reptilian eye superimposed over a flame

Home Plane: Pandemonium

33

Alignment: Chaotic evil

Portfolio: Fire, destruction, renewal

Worshipers: Dragons, sorcerers, warlords, some druids

Cleric Alignments: CN, NE, CE

Domains: Chaos, Destruction, Dragon*, Evil, Fire (Renewal)

Favored Weapon: Sickle (claw)

Dogma

Hlal enjoys sharing stories and songs with those who appre-

ciate such things, regardless of the listeners race or back-

ground. She has little use for tyrantseven well-meaning

onesand even less patience for cruelty or bullying. She

teaches that one must be free of restraint, whether real or

psychological,  in  order  to  freely  express  ones  opinions.

Garyx the All-Destroyer symbolizes the

sheer power and destructive force of

dragonkind. Some argue that Garyx is

actually insane, as a result of his long

occupation of the Windswept Depths of

Pandemonium. He appears much like a

great wyrm red dragon.

Dogma

Garyx  teaches  by  example,

periodically traveling to the

Material  Plane  to  wreak

unholy swaths of destruc-

tion  across  the  landscape.

Those  who  revere  him

follow  this  example,  using

their  power  to  bring  ruin  and

devastation.

Clergy and Temples

Garyx  pays  little  or  no  attention  to  his  clerics  and  wor-

shipers, but they care not. They believe that he grants them

the power to perform acts of destruction, and that is enough.

Perhaps  curiously,  some  druids  also  revere  the  renewal

aspect of Garyx, knowing that some devastation is always

necessary for rejuvenation to occur. Some within the Cult

of Ashardalon (see page 87) believe that the great wyrm is

actually an avatar of the god Garyx.

Few temples to Garyx are known to exist, though his wor-

shipers often carve his symbol near their handiwork.

Clergy and Temples

Hlals clerics are often multiclass cleric/bards, using music,

poetry, and tall tales to spread the faith. Places of worship to

Hlal are usually simple shrines, which can be packed up and

moved to the next town or dragon lair at a moments notice.

The followers of Hlal share much in common with those

of Olidammara, and many characters pay homage to both

deities simultaneously. Both Hextor and Vecna are among

her chief enemies, because of their portfolios.

Io the Ninefold Dragon is neutral, for he encompasses

all alignments within his aspects. He can (and does)

appear  as  any  dragon  type,  from  the  smallest

pseudodragon to the largest great wyrm.

Dogma

Io cares only for his children, the dragons, and their con-

tinued  existence  in  the  world.  In  some  cases,  this  means

taking the side of the dragons against other races. In other

situations, Io may actually help nondragons fight against a

dragon  who  would  otherwise  jeopardize  the  ongoing  sur-

vivability of the species as a whole.

He  prefers  to  remain  uninvolved  in  conflicts  between

dragons, though if such a conflict threatens to escalate he

may step in (either personally or by dispatching Aasterinian

or some other servitor).

Clergy and Temples

TAMARA

Io has even fewer clerics or shrines than most of the other

draconic  deities,  since  his  outlook  is  so  broad  and  all-

encompassing.  Still,  even  the  most  devoted  cleric  of

Bahamut, Tiamat, or any other dragon deity pays at least a

modicum of homage to the Ninefold Dragon. He also

occasionally finds clerics or adepts among the rep-

tilian  races,  such  as  kobolds  and

troglodytes.

Io counts no other faiths as his

enemies,  knowing  the  value  of

neutrality in outlook. Even those

of  greatly  varying  alignment  can

find common cause under the banner

of the Ninefold Dragon.

Unlike  Chronepsis,  who  judges  the

life of a dragon only after its death,

Lendys metes out justice during

a  dragons  life.  His  scales  are  a

tarnished  silver,  some  say

because  he  cares  more  about

judging  others  than  tending

to himself.

Dogma

Lendys is the arbiter of dragon-

kind, serving as judge, jury, and

executioner  alike.  When  a

dragon has committed an injus-

tice  against  dragonkind,  Lendys

(or  one  of  his  trio  of  great  wyrm

silver dragons) is dispatched to deal

out  appropriate  justice.  Punishments

are severe, and appeals unheard of.

Clergy and Temples

The  clerics  and  paladins  of  Lendys  are

justice-bringers  as  well,  often  serving  as

arbiters for local communities. In some cases,

towns even rely on the local draconic worshiper of Lendys

to parse out justice.

Clerics  of  Lendys  get  along  well  with  worshipers  of  St.

Cuthbert, and poorly with those who follow a chaotic deity

such as Kord, Olidammara, or Erythnul.

Tamara  is  the  kindest  and  most

benevolent of the draconic deities.

Some mistake this quality for weak-

ness,  though  such  beings  dont

make  the  same  error  twice.  She

appears  as  a  luminously  beautiful

silver dragon, her eyes shining with

the brightness of the sun itself.

Dogma

Tamara believes in mercy, both in life

and in death. Not only does she heal the

sick and tend the injured, she delivers a

merciful end to those dragons nearing the

end of their natural lives. She fiercely detests

those  who  artificially  prolong  the  life  of  a

dragon, particularly when it is against that dragons will.

Clergy and Temples

Tamaras clerics are healers, but also deliverers of death to

those who try to escape it. They prefer to destroy any un-

dead  they  encounter,  particularly  draconic  undead  (such

as dracoliches).

Though a peaceful and merciful faith, the worshipers of

Tamara  do  not  hesitate  to  stand  against  evil  or  tyranny.

Tamara counts Pelor among her staunchest allies and Fala-

zure,  Hextor,  Nerull,  and  Erythnul  among  her  enemies.

TIAMAT

The Chromatic Dragon, Creator of Evil Dragonkind

Favored Weapon: Heavy pick (bite)

All evil dragons pay homage to Tiamat; green and blue drag-

ons  acknowledge  her  sovereignty  the  most  readily.  Good

35

dragons have a healthy respect for Tiamat, though they usu-

ally avoid mentioning her or even thinking about her.

In her natural form, Tiamat is a thick-bodied dragon with

five heads and a wyverns tail. Each head is a different color:

white,  black,  green,  blue,  and  red.  Her  massive  body  is

striped in those colors.

Tiamat has many consorts, including great wyrm dragons

of the white, black, green, blue, and red varieties.

Dogma

Tiamat  concerns  herself  with  spreading  evil,

defeating good, and propagating evil dragons.

She enjoys razing the occasional village, city,

or  country,  but  only  as  a  diversion  from

more subtle, world-spanning plots. She

is the villain who lurks in the shad-

ows.  Her  presence  is  felt  but

seldom seen.

Tiamat constantly seeks to

extend  the  power  and

dominion  of  evil  dragons

over the land, particularly

when  her  subjects  find

themselves  embroiled  in

territorial  disputes  with

good  dragons.  Tiamat

unfailingly  demands  rev-

erence,  homage,  and  trib-

ute from her subjects.

Clergy and Temples

Tiamat accepts only evil clerics.

Tiamats  clerics,  like  Tiamat  herself,

seek to place the world under the domination of

evil dragons.

Though  most  evil  dragons  honor  Tiamat,  few  keep

shrines  dedicated  to  her  in  their  lairs  because  they  dont

want Tiamats  greedy  eyes  gazing  at  their  treasure  hoards.

Instead,  they  dedicate  vast,  gloomy  caverns  to  their  deity

and keep them stocked with treasure and sacrifices.

Tiamat claims not to need allies, though most believe she

has  bargains  with  many  archdevils  and  lawful  evil  deities

such  as  Hextor.  Her  enemies  are  numerous,  including

Heironeous, Moradin, and, of course, Bahamut.

DRAGONS BY KIND

True dragons fall into two broad categories: chromatic and

metallic.

The  chromatic  dragons  are  black,  blue,  green,  red,  and

white,  all  evil  and  extremely  fierce.  When  dealing  with  a

chromatic dragon, one must always prepare for the worst.

The  metallic  dragons  are  brass,  bronze,  copper,  gold,

and  silver.  They  are  good,  usually  noble,  and  highly

respected by the wise. A metallic dragon may seem dan-

gerous, but it will usually behave virtuously if given the

chance. A fight with a metallic dragon is a fight that could

have been avoided.

DRAGON SIZES

Though the dragons of popular imagination are immense,

dragons  come  in  all  sizes. The  smallest  wyrmlings  are  no

bigger than housecats. The largest great wyrms can dwarf a

castle wall.

Although  most  dragons  have  similar  body  shapes,  their

vital statistics can vary considerably between kinds, even

when they are of similar sizes. The tables included in the

following sections of dragon types show a dragons typi-

cal  dimensions  at  each  size.  The  terms  used  in  the

tables are defined as follows:

Overall Length: The dragons length measured from

the tip of the nose to the tip of the tail, horns or frills

excluded. A living dragon usually seems shorter,

particularly  in  a  fight,  because  it  seldom

stretches itself full out. A dragon can easily

curl up and shorten its overall length by

as  much  as  two-thirds,  but  its  width

increases accordingly.

Body Length: The dragons over-

all  length,  less  its  neck  and  tail.

Measured  from  the  front  of  the

shoulders to the base of the tail.

This dimension helps define the

dragons fighting space.

Neck Length: Measured from

the front of the shoulders to the

tip of the nose. Burrowing drag-

ons have stubbier necks than

other dragons. This dimension

may be slightly longer than the

dragons bite reach.

Tail Length: Measured from the

base  of  the  tail  to  the  tip  of  the  tail.

Aquatic  dragons  have  longer  tails  than

other dragons. This dimension may be slightly longer than

the radius of the dragons tail sweep attack.

Body Width: Measured across the front shoulders, which

are the widest part of the dragon. A dragon cannot fit through

a space narrower than this without making a Dexterity check

or an Escape Artist check (see the Escape Artist skill descrip-

tion,  page  73  of  the  Players  Handbook).  When  a  dragon  is

standing in a normal, relaxed posture, its shoulders are gen-

erally 10% to 25% wider than the indicated figure.

Standing Height: A dragons standing height is measured

from  its  front  shoulders  to  the  ground. To  determine  how

high  a  rearing  dragon  can  reach,  add  its  space  to  its  reach.

Maximum Wingspan: Measured across the tips of the

fully spread wings.

Minimum  Wingspan:  This  is  the  minimum  space  in

which a dragon can flap its wings sufficiently to maintain

flight. A dragon with its wings fully folded against its body

has no wingspan at all.

Weight: The  dragons  weight  in  pounds.  For  the  larger

dragons, this number is an estimate based on the dragons

measurements.

All these numbers are average values and vary by as much

as 25%, up or down, for any individual dragon.

Black  dragons  are  among  the  most  evil-tempered  true

dragons.  They  prefer  dismal  swamps  or  bogs,  the  more

stagnant and fetid the better, but can be encountered any-

where  water  and  dense  vegetation  are  found  together

including jungles, rain forests, and moors. They have no

natural enemies, though they attack and kill almost any-

thing  unfortunate  enough  to  stumble  upon  them.  Black

dragons living in forest areas often encounter green drag-

ons,  but  the  two  species  usually  manage  to  maintain  an

uneasy  truce,  so  long  as  the  black  dragons  stick  to  the

watery areas.

Black  dragons  make  their  lairs  in  large,  damp  caves  or

multichambered submerged caverns. They always dwell near

water, and their lairs usually have a submerged entrance and

a land entrance. Older black dragons hide both entrances to

their lairs with plant growth.

Black Dragon Identifiers

A black dragon has deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal open-

ings  that  make  its  face  look  like  a  skull.  It  has  segmented

horns that curve forward and down, somewhat like a rams

horns,  but  not  as  curly. These  horns  are  bone-colored  near

their bases, but darken to dead black at the tips. As the dragon

ages,  the  flesh  around  the  horns  and  cheekbones  deterio-

rates,  as  though  eaten  by  acid,  leaving  only  thin  layers  of

hide covering the skull. This phenomenon is not harmful to

the dragon, but enhances its skeletal appearance.

Most of a black dragons teeth protrude when the mouth

is closed, and big spikes stud the lower jaw. A pair of small

horns jut from the chin, and a row of hornlets crown the

head. The tongue is flat, with a forked tip, and the dragon

often drools acidic slime.

A  black  dragon  smells  of  rotting  vegetation  and

foul water, with an acidic undertone.

A black dragon flying overhead is marked by a distinctive

profile. Its horns, with their characteristic forward curve, are

clearly visible. The wing membranes are marked with blobby

stripes, and the leading edges of the wings are fringed or scal-

loped near the tips. A black dragon also has exceptionally

long alar thumbs. The trailing edges of the wing membranes

join the body ahead of the back legs.

On hatching, a black dragons scales are thin, small, and

glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and

duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.

Habits

Black dragons dine primarily on fish, mollusks, and other

aquatic  creatures. They  also  hunt  for  red  meat  but  like  to

pickle it by letting it lie in ponds within or near their lairs

for days before being eaten. The rotting flesh helps make the

area even more fouljust the way the dragon likes it.

Black  dragons  are  especially  fond  of  coins.  Older  and

craftier  dragons  sometimes  capture  and  question  human-

oids  about  stockpiles  of  gold,  silver,  and  platinum  coins

before killing them. Others move out into nearby rivers or

lakes, where they menace boat traffic and demand that pass-

ing vessels pay tribute.

In keeping with their reputation for ferocity, black drag-

ons usually fight for their mates. The females do most of the

fighting, flying far and wide to locate a desirable male and

then impressing him with a victory over a rival. Eggs are usu-

ally laid near the males lair, and the male is left to guard the

young. Black dragon parents are protective, but give their off-

spring  little  support  beyond  the  occasional  bit  of  advice.

Eventually, the parent advises its offspring to leave the area

before the older dragon decides to eat the youngster.

Although capable of breathing underwater, black drag-

ons do little actual swimming; instead, they wallow in the

shallows, enjoying the feel of the mud or simply lying in

wait for prey. Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets,

using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heav-

ily  forested  swamps  and  marshes,  they  try  to  stay  in  the

water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their

aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon

attempts  to  fly  out  of  sight,  so  as  not  to  leave  tracks,  and

takes refuge in the deepest water it can find.

BLUE DRAGONS

Blue dragons are vain and territorial. They favor hot, arid areas.

They prefer sandy deserts, but can be found on dry steppes

and in hot badlands. A blue dragon guards its territory against

all  potential  competitors,  including  other  monsters  such  as

sphinxes, dragonnes, and especially brass dragons. Blue drag-

ons  detest  brass  dragons  for  their  frivolous  ways,  chaotic

alignment, and propensity to flee from battle.

Blue dragons prefer vast underground caverns for lairs

the grander the cavern, the better. They often choose lairs at

the bases of cliffs where windblown sand has accumulated. The

dragon burrows through the sand to reach the caves below.

Most blue dragons dont bother to keep the entrances to their

lairs free of sand; they simply burrow to get in or out. Many

deliberately  bury  the  entrances  to  their  lairs  before  settling

down to sleep or when leaving to patrol their territory.

Dungeon-dwelling blue dragons prefer fairly warm and

dry areas with sand or dirt floors.

Blue Dragon Identifiers

A blue dragon is conspicuous by its dramatic frilled ears and

a single, massive horn atop its short, blunt head. The horn

juts forward from a base that takes up most of the top of the

head,  and  it  usually  has  two  points. The  primary  point  is

slightly curved and reaches well forward, with a smaller, sec-

ondary  point  behind.  Rows  of  hornlets  line  the  dragons

brow ridges, and run back from the nostrils (which lie close

to the eyesockets) along the entire length of the head.

A blue dragon has a short snout with an underslung lower

jaw. It has a cluster of bladelike scales under its chin, and

hornlets on its cheeks. Most of the dragons teeth protrude

when its mouth is closed.

A  blue  dragons  scales  vary  in  color  from  an  iridescent

azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by blowing

desert  sands.  The  size  of  its  scales  increases  little  as  the

dragon ages, although they do become thicker and harder.

Its hide tends to hum and crackle faintly with built-up static

electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry

or  about  to  attack,  giving  off  an  odor  of  ozone  and  sand.

A  blue  dragon  flying  overhead  is  easily  distinguished

from a brass dragon by its batlike wings, which have short

alar  thumbs  and  a  mottled  or  dappled  pattern.  The  alar

phalanges (the fingerlike bones that support the wing; see

Internal  Anatomy,  page  7)  have  knobby  joints,  and  the

phalanges  are  all  the  same  length,  giving  the  wings  a

rounded  look. The  trailing  edge  of  the  wing  membrane

joins the body well ahead of the rear legs.

The dragon has a short, thick neck. The head is mostly fea-

tureless when viewed from below, but the ears are visible.

The dragons tail is thick and flat.

Habits

A blue dragons vibrant color makes it easy to spot in barren

desert surroundings, especially when the dragon is on the

ground.  When  it  wishes  to  be  less  conspicuous,  a  blue

dragon burrows into the sand so that only the top of its head

is exposed. This trick leaves the dragons massive horn stick-

ing above the surface, but from a distance the horn tends to

look like a jagged rock.

Blue dragons love to soar in the hot desert air, usually

flying in the daytime when temperatures are highest. Some

nearly match the color of the desert sky and can be difficult

to see from below.

Although they collect anything that looks valuable, blue

dragons are most fond of gemsespecially blue sapphires.

They consider blue to be a noble hue and the most beauti-

ful color.

Blue  dragons  are  dedicated  carnivores. They  sometimes

eat snakes, lizards, and even desert plants to sate their great

hunger,  but  they  especially  prefer  herd  animals  such  as

camels. When they get the chance, they gorge themselves on

these creatures, which they cook with their lightning breath.

This dining habit makes blue dragons a real threat to caravans

crossing the desert. The dragons think of cara-

vans as handy collections of food and treasure, all

available on the same trip.

Blue dragons have a highly developed sense of order (with

themselves at the top, at least locally). The oldest blue dragon

in an area acts as an overlord to all lesser blue dragons living

nearby. This suzerain receives homage from its subjects and

settles any disputes, particularly those involving mates or ter-

ritorial boundaries. Although any blue dragon in an area can

challenge the suzerain for the right to rule, this seldom hap-

pens. A blue dragon that is unhappy with its suzerain usually

moves to a new areaeither one with a suzerain more to its

liking, or one with no suzerain at all.

Blue dragons observe elaborate courtship and mating rit-

uals involving exchanges of food and treasure, the consent

of the suzerain, and announcements to other blue dragons.

Older dragons of either sex might have multiple mates, but

infidelity is rare. Blue dragons are usually attentive and effec-

tive parents, and do not often leave eggs unattended.

Typically,  blue  dragons  attack  from  above  or  burrow

beneath  the  sands  until  opponents  come  within  100  feet.

Older dragons use their special abilities, such as hallucinatory

terrain,  in  concert  with  these  tactics  to  mask  the  land  and

improve their chances to surprise the target. When stalking

intelligent prey, they often use ventriloquism and mimicry

to confuse and divide groups before closing in for the kill. A

blue dragon runs from a fight only if it is severely damaged,

since all blue dragons view retreat as cowardly.

BRASS DRAGONS

The most gregarious of all the true dragons, brass dragons are

famous (some would say infamous) for their love of conver-

sation. They crave sunlight and dry heat, so they frequent hot,

arid regions, particularly sandy deserts. Their choice of ter-

rain  often  puts  them  at  odds  with  blue  dragons,  which  are

both more powerful and more aggressive. Brass dragons usu-

ally cope with attacking blues by using their superior speed to

escape, either through the air or by burrowing to safety.

Brass dragons like to make their lairs in high, rocky caves,

preferably facing east so the rising run can warm the rocks.

Most brass dragons also have several bolt-holes dug into the

bases of cliffs where the desert winds have piled up sand.

The dragons burrow tunnels parallel to the cliff face in the

hard-packed sand. They can move quickly along these tun-

nels,  exiting  into  subterranean  caverns,  or  out  other  bur-

rows farther down the line.

Dungeon-dwelling  brass  dragons  often  make  their  lairs

near  heavily  traveled  areas  where  they  can  satisfy  their

desire for conversation.

Brass Dragon Identifiers

A brass dragons head has a massive, fluted plate sweeping

back  from  its  eye  sockets,  forehead,  and  cheeks. The  one-

piece plate is dished like a plowshare. When burrowing in

the sand, the dragon often uses its head like a plow. A brass

dragon also sports bladed chin horns that grow sharper with

age. It has supple, expressive lips and a long forked tongue.

As  the  dragon  grows  older,  its  pupils  fade  until  the  eyes

resemble molten metal orbs.

A brass dragon has a tangy odor redolent of hot metal or

desert sand.

Brass  dragons  have  short,  raylike  wings  that  run  from

their shoulders all the way back past the tips of their tails.

The wings get most of their support from long spines run-

ning perpendicular to the backbone. The neck is stubby and

thick,  with  a  comparatively  long  body.  When  the  body  is

viewed from below, the chin horns are visible.

At birth, a brass dragons scales are a dull, mottled brown. As

the  dragon  gets  older,  the  scales  become  more  brassy  until

they reach a warm, burnished appearance. The wings and frills

are mottled green where they join the body, and have reddish

tints  at  the  outer  edges.  These  markings  darken  with  age.

Habits

Brass dragons can and will eat almost anything if the need

arises, but they normally consume very little. They seem to

understand  that  the  desert  is  a  fragile  environment,  and

they live lightly upon the land. They are able to get nour-

ishment  from  the  morning  dew,  a  rare  commodity  in  the

desert, and they go forth at dawn to gently lift minute beads

of dew off plants with their long tongues.

Though it values all precious things, a brass dragon pre-

fers organic treasures over cold stone or metal. Its hoard

often  includes  items  made  from  rare  woods,  textiles,  and

other  examples  of  fine  handicrafts  rendered  in  exquisite

materials. The warm, dry air of its lair helps keep these deli-

cate treasures from deteriorating with age. A brass dragon

takes great care to keep its fiery breath weapon well away

from its delicate treasure, and often keeps its hoard in a sep-

arate chamber within its lair.

Brass  dragons  love  intense,  dry  heat  and  spend  most  of

their time basking in the desert sun. Their territories always

contain  several  spots  where  they  can  sunbathe  and  trap

unwary travelers in conversation. A brass dragon will talk

for hours with any creature capable of putting two syllables

together.

Many  scholars  believe  that  brass  dragons  are  the  most

humble  of  the  true  dragons.  While  any  brass  dragon  cer-

tainly will agree that humility is among its many virtues, a

brass  dragons  loquacity  is  really  a  form

of draconic hubris. Brass dragons con-

sider  themselves  such  gifted  con-

versationalists  that  they  simply

cannot bear to allow any sentient

being  to  miss  the  benefit  of

their company.

For all their love of conversation, what brass dragons seem

to prefer the least is the company of other brass dragons. Each

one remains in loose contact with its neighbors, and brass

dragons  will  band  together  whenever  a  common  enemy

threatens, but otherwise they keep to themselves.

Many brass dragons create vast networks of confidantes

and informants, including djinn, jann, sphinxes, and vari-

ous  humanoids. The  dragons  use  these  networks  to  keep

apprised of local events and to stay in remote communica-

tion with distant brass dragons.

Brass dragons would rather talk than fight. If an intelli-

gent creature tries to leave without engaging in conversa-

tion,  the  dragon  might  force  compliance  in  a  fit  of  pique,

using suggestion or  a  dose  of  sleep gas.  Though  basically

friendly,  brass  dragons  are  quick  to  act  if  they  feel  threat-

ened, and often use their nonlethal sleep breath to knock out

aggressors. A creature put to sleep may wake to find itself

pinned or buried to the neck in the sand. The dragon then

converses  with  its  prisoner  until  its  thirst  for

small talk is slaked.

When faced with real danger, younger brass drag-

ons fly out of sight, then hide by burrowing into the sand.

Older  dragons  spurn  this  ploy  but  tend  to  avoid  pitched

fights unless they have some tactical advantage.

BRONZE DRAGONS

Bronze dragons have a strong sense of justice and do not tol-

erate cruelty or anarchy in any form. Many a pirate or robber

has faced swift retribution from a bronze dragon using an

innocuous disguise. Bronze dragons also have an inquisitive

side  and  find  the  activities  of  other  creatures,  particularly

humanoids, endlessly fascinating. They enjoy polymorphing

into small, friendly animals to study such activities.

Bronze  dragons  like  to  be  near  deep  fresh  water  or  salt

water, and are found in temperate and tropical coastal areas

and islands. They often visit the depths to cool off or hunt

for pearls and sunken treasure.

Bronze dragons wage a constant struggle against evil sea

creatures, particularly ones that menace the coasts, such as

sahuagin,  merrow,  and  scrags. They  sometime  find  them-

selves with black or green dragons for neighbors. While the

bronzes are content to live and let live, the evil dragons are

seldom willing to return the favor.

Bronze  dragons  prefer  make  their  lairs  in  caves  that  are

accessible only from the water, but their lairs are always dry

they do not lay eggs, sleep, or store treasure underwater. Often,

a bronze dragons lair has a lower area that floods at high tide

and an upper area that remains dry around the clock.

Dungeon-dwelling bronze dragons often live near under-

ground streams or lakes.

Bronze Dragon Identifiers

A bronze dragon in its true form can be recognized by the

ribbed and fluted crests sweeping back from its cheeks and

eyes.  The  ribs  in  the  crests  end  in  curving  horns.  These

horns are smooth, dark, and oval in cross-section, and curve

slightly inward toward the dragons spine. The largest horns

grow from the top of the head. In older dragons, the smaller

horns often develop secondary points. The dragon also has

small horns on its lower jaw and chin.

A  bronze  dragon  has  a  beaklike  snout  and  a  pointed

tongue. It has a small head frill and a tall neck frill.

A  bronze  dragon  has  webbed  feet  and  webbing  behind

the forelimbs. Its scales are smooth and flat.

A bronze wyrmlings scales are yellow tinged with green,

showing  only  a  hint  of  bronze.  As  the  dragon  approaches

adulthood, its color deepens slowly to a darker, rich bronze

tone. Very old dragons develop a blue-black tint to the edges

of  their  scales. Their  pupils  fade  as  they  age,  until  in  the

oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs. A smell of sea

spray lingers about them.

When viewed from below, a bronze dragons wings show

green mottling on the back edges. The trailing edge of the

wing membrane joins the body behind the rear legs, at the

point where the tail meets the pelvis.

Most of the alar phalanges are very short and form a wide

frill just beyond the alar thumb. The innermost phalange is the

longest,  and  it  provides  most  of  the  support  for  the  wings,

along with a modified alar olecranon at the elbow of the alar

limb (see page 8). This arrangement allows the dragon to use

its wings as big fins underwater. A bronze dragon can flap its

wings  when  submerged  and  literally  fly  through  the  water.

Habits

A  bronze  dragon  spends  much  of  its  time  in  an  assumed

form, usually that of a small animal or an older humanoid.

This charade serves the dragons inquisitive nature by allow-

ing it a chance to observe the world without drawing atten-

tion to itself or disrupting the flow of events. Bronze dragons

value moral order and altruism.

Bronze  dragons  frequently  congregate  with  others  of

their kind, making them among the most gregarious of the

true dragons. When in their natural form, they sometimes

swim or play together in the waves. They gather even more

frequently  when  using  assumed  forms,  particularly  when

observing some event of interest to them. They find warfare

fascinating,  and  many  have  served  in  armies  fighting  for

good causes. Afterward, they may spend decades debating

the course of the war, its causes, and its consequences.

Though they have no lack of draconic pride, bronze drag-

ons  enjoy  the  company  of  humans  and  other  humanoids.

They consider these lesser creatures to be just as deserving

of survival and happiness as themselves. When in the com-

pany  of  humanoids,  a  bronze  dragon  usually  assumes

humanoid  form,  both  as  a  practical  matter  (it  can  be  very

hard to fit a bronze adult into a seaside cottage), and to keep

the humanoids at ease. Bronze dragons delight in testing a

strangers  sense  of  decency  by  posing  as  penniless  beach-

combers,  shipwrecked  sailors,  or  guileless  primitives.

Unscrupulous creatures who attempt to cheat, bully, rob, or

kill  a  masquerading  dragon  soon  find  more  trouble  than

they had bargained for when the dragon reveals itself. Crea-

tures who conduct themselves well may never know they

have  actually  encountered  a  bronze  dragon.  Nevertheless,

good  conduct  earns  the  dragons  respect,  and  it  is  usually

remembered, perhaps to be rewarded someday.

Most bronze dragons maintain a constant watch for pirates,

natural  disasters,  and  ships  in  distress.  Many  a  shipwrecked

mariner  has  been  rescued  by  the  timely  intervention  of  a

bronze dragon. Because bronze dragons usually perform such

rescues while disguised as something else, the beings they save

often  remain  unaware  of  exactly  who  their  benefactor  was.

Courtship and mating among bronze dragons is always a

deliberate and respectful affair. Bronze dragons mate for life,

and one often refuses to take a new mate after the death of

the original mate. They always tend their eggs and offspring

carefully and defend them to the death if necessary.

Bronze dragons eat aquatic plants and some varieties of

seafood. They especially prize shark meat, and often spend

days at sea hunting sharks. They also dine on the occasional

pearl. They often keep pearls in their lairs, both as treasures

and snacks. They admire other treasures from the sea as well,

such as bits of rare coral and amber. Though they dont care

to admit it, their favorite metal is gold, which does not tar-

nish in their humid lairs.

Bronze dragons usually attack only in self-defense or to

defend  those  unable  to  defend  themselves.  They  dislike

killing anything they dont plan to eat, and they try especially

hard  to  avoid  killing  animals  that  are  merely  defending

themselves. They  usually  try  to  distract  attacking  animals

with food, using their repulsion breath to fend them off if

distractions  fail.  Against  intelligent  foes,  bronze  dragons

usually try to negotiate, but remain wary of duplicity.

Often, a bronze dragon figures out a way to be victorious

in a conflict without dealing damage, such as stranding a foe

on an island or dismasting a ship at sea.

Copper dragons also find themselves with silver, red,

or blue dragons for neighbors. The silvers avoid too much

contact with the coppers. Blue or red dragons inevitably try

to slay the coppers or at least drive them away. Many a copper

dragon  considers  the  presence  of  a  blue  or  red  dragon  as

challenge,  and  does  all  it  can  to  annoy  and  embarrass  the

evil dragon without getting itself killed.

Copper  dragons  make  their  lairs  in  narrow  caves. They

use their ability to move and shape stone to enhance their

lairs,  often  concealing  the  entrances  using  move  earth and

stone shape. Within the lair, they construct twisting mazes,

often with open tops that allow the dragon to fly or jump

over intruders. Unlike most dragons, however, copper drag-

ons are often happy to have cramped lairs that dont allow

them space for flight; they depend instead on their ability to

climb stone surfaces for mobility inside the lair.

COPPER DRAGONS

Copper Dragon Identifiers

Copper dragons have a well-deserved reputation as incorri-

gible pranksters, joke-tellers, and riddlers. They appreciate

all forms of humor. Most are good-natured but also have a

covetous, miserly streak.

Copper dragons like dry, rocky uplands and mountains.

Their territories sometimes adjoin or overlap brass dragons

territories. The two species tend to get along well, but meet-

ings between the two usually devolve into marathon con-

versations in which the copper dragons bombard the brass

dragons with humor while the brass dragons blithely con-

tinue to banter. Such sessions usually end with one dragon

or the other taking its leave none too gently.

Copper  dragons  are  powerful  jumpers  and  climbers,  with

massive thighs and shoulders.

A copper dragons head has a short face and no beak. Broad,

smooth browplates jut over the eyes, and long, flat coppery

horns  extend  back  from  the  browplates  in  a  series  of  seg-

ments. The dragon also has backswept cheek ridges and frills

on the backs of the lower jaws that sweep forward slightly.

Layers of triangular blades point down from the chin, and as

the dragon gets older more layers with larger blades develop.

The dragon has a long tongue that comes to a single point.

At birth, a copper dragons scales have a ruddy brown color

with  a  metallic  tint.  As  the  dragon  gets  older,  the  scales

become finer and more coppery, assuming a soft, warm gloss

by the young adult stage. A very old dragons scales pick up a

green  tint.  A  copper  dragons  pupils  fade  with  age,  and  the

eyes of a great wyrm resemble glowing turquoise orbs.

Copper dragons have a stony odor.

Copper dragons have mantalike wings that show green and

red mottling along the trailing edges. The upper alar limb is

exceedingly short, giving the leading edges of the wings a U-

shaped profile when viewed from below. The wings run down

the dragons entire body, almost to the tip of the tail.

The main portion of the wing is supported by three pha-

langes  and  a  modified  alar  olecranon.  Spines  sweeping

backward  at  an  angle  from  the  backbone  support  the

remainder of the wing.

A copper dragons distinctive wing profile makes it easy to

distinguish from the brass dragon, which can occupy simi-

lar habitats.

Habits

A  copper  dragons  sense  of  humor  compels  it  to  seek  out

companionshipit takes at least two beings to share a joke.

Consequently, a copper dragon is basically a social creature.

Except when mating, however, copper dragons tend to avoid

each  other,  mostly  because  they  cannot  resist  getting  into

competition to prove which has the sharpest wit. When two

or  more  copper  dragons  get  together,  the  meeting  usually

escalates into verbal sparring. The dragons initially trade wit-

ticisms and banter, but the conversation eventually devolves

into pointed barbs growing ever more vicious, until one of the

dragons pulls away, vowing revenge. Such encounters rarely

lead to violence or lasting enmity, but often create a rivalry.

Rival copper dragons have carried on wars of practical jokes

and colorful insults that have lasted for centuries.

Copper dragon courtship is an odd mix of tenderness and

outrageous humor. Although males and females exchange

small gifts of food and treasure, the real currency between

copper dragons is wit. Copper dragons are attracted to mates

who can make them laugh. Such liaisons are never perma-

nent,  but  the  couple  stays  together  long  enough  to  raise

their offspring to adulthood. After that, each dragons free-

wheeling spirit takes over and the couple splits, with each

individual going its own way.

Copper  dragons  are  known  to  eat  almost  anything,  in-

cluding metal ores. However, they prize monstrous scorpions

and other large poisonous creatures. (They say the venom

sharpens their wit; their digestive systems can handle the

venom  safely,  although  injected  venoms  affect  them  nor-

mally.) They  are  determined  hunters. They  consider  good

sport at least as important as the food they get, and doggedly

pursue any prey that initially eludes them.

When  building  hoards,  copper  dragons  prefer  treasures

from the earth. Metals and precious stones are favorites, but

they also value statuary and fine ceramics.

A copper dragon would rather tell a riddle or a pull a prank

than fight. Any copper dragon appreciates wit wherever it

can be found, and will usually not harm a creature that can

relate a joke, humorous story, or riddle the dragon has not

heard before. The dragon quickly gets annoyed with

anyone  who  doesnt  laugh  at  its  jokes  or  accept  its

tricks  with  good  humor.  Copper  dragons  love  being  the

center  of  attention  and  do  not  appreciate  being  upstaged.

When cornered, a copper dragon fights tenaciously, using

every trick it knows to defeat the foe. Copper dragons show

similar aggression when defending lairs, mates, or offspring.

In  most  other  circumstances,  a  copper  dragon  prefers  to

outwit and embarrass a foe. To a copper dragon, a perfect vic-

tory comes from taunting and annoying an opponent into

just  giving  up.  In  any

situation, copper dragons

favor  thinking  and  plan-

ning  over  brute  force. They

often  deal  with  superior  foes,

such  as  red  dragons,  by  draw-

ing  them  into  narrow,  twisting

canyons or tortuous caves where they can use their climbing

ability to outmaneuver the foe.

GOLD DRAGONS

Gold dragons are dedicated foes of evil and foul play. They

often  embark  on  self-appointed  quests  to  promote  good.

Woe to the evildoer who earns a gold dragons wrath. The

dragon will not rest until the malefactor has been defeated

and either slain or brought to justice. Gold dragons do not

settle  for  anything  less  than  complete  victory  over  evil.

A gold dragon usually assumes human or animal guise,

even within its own lair.

Gold dragons can live any-

where,  but  they  prefer  secluded

lairs. Favorite locales include the bot-

toms of lakes, high plateaus, islands,

and deep gorges. A gold dragons lair is

always made of stone, with numerous chambers, all beauti-

fully  decorated. The  lair  usually  has  loyal  guards:  animals

appropriate  to  the  terrain,  storm  giants,  or  good-aligned

cloud giants.

Dungeon-dwelling  gold  dragons  choose  locations  that

provide them with suitable chambers.

Gold Dragon Identifiers

A  gold  dragon  in  its  true  form  is  easily  recognized  by  its

large, twin horns that are smooth and metallic, twin neck

frills, and the whiskers around its mouth that look like the

barbels of a catfish. Gold wyrmlings lack whiskers, but they

quickly develop them as they mature. Younger dragons have

eight whiskers, four on the upper jaw and four below. Older

dragons have more.

A gold dragon has a short face with spines above the nos-

trils. The eyes are slanted and very narrow. Along with the

whiskers, the eyes give the dragon a sagacious look. As the

dragon ages, its pupils fade until the eyes resemble pools of

molten gold. The dragon has a long, pointed tongue, back-

swept tendrils on the lower jaws that develop into frills with

age, and cheek horns that jut out sideways.

On hatching, a gold dragons scales are dark yellow with

golden metallic flecks. The flecks get larger as the dragon

matures until, at the adult stage, the scales grow completely

golden. A gold dragon smells of saffron and incense.

A  gold  dragon  has  an  extremely  long  tail  and  broad,

mantalike wings that run all the way to the tip of the tail.

When at rest, the dragon closes its wings over its back like a

massive, golden moth. It folds its wings back when walking

or running.

A  gold  dragon  flies  with  a  distinctive  rippling  motion,

almost as if it were swimming through the air. Many scholars

argue that gold dragons are the most elegant flyers of all the

true dragons (and the gold dragons agree). When viewed from

below, a flying gold dragon can be distinguished by its long tail

and rippling wings. Its whiskers and horns also show.

Habits

A gold dragon spends most of its time in an assumed form,

usually  that  of  a  nondescript  human  or  a  harmless  animal

common to the area in which the dragon resides. For animal

forms, gold dragons often choose domestic animals, such as

dogs, cats, or horses, or swift moving but fairly nonthreaten-

ing  forms  such  as  eagles.  As  with  the  bronze  dragon,  the

assumed form allows the gold dragon to travel and observe

the world without attracting undue attention to itself. When

traveling in particularly dangerous areas, a gold dragon uses

an especially nonthreatening form. This approach helps set at

ease fellow travelers the dragon might meet, and also allows

the dragon to use itself as bait for any evil creatures lurking

about. Many killers and robbers who haunt the worlds lonely

places  have  met  swift  ends  when  their  seemingly  helpless

victims turned out to be gold dragons in disguise.

Gold dragons always seek news of the wider world and

local gossip about recent events. Any gold dragon is a good

listener, and even the most long-winded talker does not try its

patience (though even a gold dragon will draw the line if a

brass dragon bends its ear for too long). The dragon usually

avoids philosophical or ethical arguments with lesser beings,

though  it  often  cannot  resist  trumping  an  argument  that

advocates  chaos  with  an  aphorism  or  fable  promoting  law.

When it encounters a being that advocates evil, a gold dragon

tends to be silent, but marks the speaker for future attention.

Gold dragons have a worldwide hierarchy with a single

leader at the top. This leader is elected by the whole species

from  the  ranks  of  great  gold  wyrms  and  serves  for  life  or

until he or she decides to resign. Many serve until the onset

of  their  twilight  (see  page  14);  others  serve  until  they

believe a successor can do a better job. The leader is always

addressed by the honorific Your Resplendence.

When a vacancy occurs, every gold dragon in the world

participates  in  the  selection  of  the  replacement,  who  is

almost  always  selected  by  acclamation.  Occasionally,  two

candidates  of  equal  merit  are  available  when  the  previous

ruler dies or retires. In such cases, the two work out some

method  of  sharing  of  office.  During  the  past,  there  have

been  co-rulers,  alternating  rulers,  and  rulers  who  simply

have retired early to make way for another.

The  rulers  duties  usually  prove  light  because  the  posi-

tions authority rarely needs to exercised. Most gold dragons

know how they are expected to behave, and they act accord-

ingly. The ruler mostly serves to advise individual gold drag-

ons on the nature and goals of their quests against evil. The

ruler often can point out hidden consequences for a quest,

such as the effects on the politics of lesser creatures or the

impact on the local environment or the balance of power.

The ruler also serves as the gold dragons chief representa-

tive in dealing with other species (in the rare event when

some  matter  of  interest  to  all  gold  dragons  arises),  and  as

chief enforcer and judge (in the exceptionally rare case of

gold dragon misconduct).

Gold dragon courtship is both deliberate and dignified.

Often two prospective mates spend years debating philoso-

phy and ethics, and go on several quests together, so as to get

the full measure of one another. Once a pair agree to mate,

they seek the rulers approval as a matter of protocol. Per-

mission to mate is rarely withheld.

Despite  their  lawful  nature,  gold  dragons  allow  them-

selves remarkable freedom. Some mate for life, other only

for  a  short  time.  Some  are  monogamous,  and  others  have

multiple mates at the same time. Gold dragons always tend

and instruct their young carefully, though it is common for

parents to send their offspring into the care of foster parents

(always lawful good, but not always dragons) when they per-

ceive the need. Young gold dragons may be fostered to pro-

tect them when danger threatens, to free up the parents for

a quest, or simply to broaden their horizons.

Gold  dragons  prefer  treasures  that  show  an  artisans

touch. They are particularly fond of paintings, calligraphy,

sculpture, and fine porcelain. They enjoy pearls and small

gems,  which  also  are  their  favorite  foods.  Approaching  a

gold dragon with gifts of pearls and gems is a good way to

gain favor, provided the gifts are not offered as bribes.

Gold dragons usually parley before fighting. When con-

versing with intelligent creatures, they use discern lies to help

them  determine  if  combat  really  will  be  necessary.  They

prefer to delay combat until they can cast preparatory spells.

GREEN DRAGONS

Green  dragons  are  belligerent  creatures  and  masters  of

intrigue, politics, and backbiting. They prefer forests; the

older  the  forest  and  bigger  the  trees,  the  better.  Green

dragons are as territorial and aggressive as any other kind

of evil dragon, but their aggression often takes the form of

elaborate  schemes  to  gain  power  or  wealth  with  as  little

effort as possible.

Green dragons seek out caves in sheer cliffs or hillsides

for their lairs. They prefer locations where the lairs entrance

is  hidden  from  prying  eyes,  such  as  behind  a  waterfall  or

near  a  lake,  pond,  or  stream  that  provides  a  submerged

entrance.  Older  green  dragons  often  conceal  their  lairs

with  plants  they  have  magically  grown.  Green  dragons

sometimes clash with black dragons over choice lairs. The

greens frequently pretend to back down, only to wait a few

decades before returning to raid the black dragons lair and

loot its hoard.

Dungeon-dwelling  green  dragons  prefer  locales  with

some kind of vegetable life, such as grottos filled with giant

mushrooms.

Green Dragon Identifiers

A green dragons notable features include a heavily curved

jawline and a crest that begins near the eyes and continues

down most of the dragons spine. The crest reaches its full

height just behind the skull.

A green dragon has no external ears, just ear openings and

leathery  plates  that  run  down  the  sides  of  the  neck,  each

plate edged with hornlets. The dragon also has hornlets over

its brows and at the chin. The nostrils are set high on the

snout, and the teeth protrude when the mouth is closed. The

dragon has a long, slender, forked tongue.

The stinging odor of chlorine wafts from a green dragon.

A wyrmling green dragons scales are thin, very small, and

a deep shade of green that appears nearly black. As the dragon

ages,  the  scales  grow  larger  and  lighter,  turning  shades  of

forest,  emerald,  and  olive  green,  which  helps  it  blend  in

with its wooded surroundings.

A green dragons legs and neck are proportionately longer

in relation to the rest of its body than any other chromatic

or  metallic  dragon.  When  it  stands  on  all  fours,  its  body

stays  fairly  high  off  the  ground,  enabling  it  to  pass  over

brush or forest debris lying on the ground. The neck is often

longer than the rest of the dragons body (excluding the tail),

and  older  dragons  can  peer  over  the  tops  of  mature  trees

without rearing up.

A green dragons long neck gives it a distinctive, swanlike

profile when aloft. The head looks featureless when viewed

from below.

The wings have a dappled pattern, darker near the lead-

ing edges and lighter toward the trailing edges. The alar

thumb  is  short,  and  the  alar  phalanges  are  all  the  same

length, giving the wingtips a rounded look. The trailing

edge of the wing membrane joins the body well ahead of

the rear legs.

Habits

A green dragon patrols its territory regularly, both on the

wing and on the ground, so as to get a good look over and

under the forest canopy. These patrols serve twin purposes.

First,  the  dragon  stays  on  the  lookout  for  prey.  Although

they  have  been  known  to  eat  practically  anything  when

hungry  enough,  including  shrubs  and  small  trees,  green

dragons especially prize elves and sprites.

Second, green dragons like to note anything new happen-

ing in their domains. They have a lust for power that rivals

their desire to collect treasure. There is little a green dragon

will not attempt to further its ambitions. Its favorite means

of gaining influence over others is intimidation, but it tries

more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons

or similarly powerful creatures. Green dragons are consum-

mate liars and masters of double talk and verbal evasion. Just

talking to a green dragon can lead a being to ruin.

When dealing with most other creatures, green dragons

are honey-tongued, smooth, and sophisticated. Among their

own kind, they are loud, crass, and generally rude, especially

when  dealing  with  dragons  of  the  same  age  and  status.

Younger  dragons  are  forced  to  use  some  restraint  when

interacting with their elders, but the veneer of civility they

adopt is paper-thin, and the dragons know it. A clear peck-

ing order, based on age and status but with no formal hier-

archy, develops among green dragons within a given area.

Green dragons know each other too well to depend on any

formal social structure.

Courtship among green dragons is a coarse and indelicate

affair.  Once  a  pair  decide  to  mate,  however,  their  lawful

nature  comes  to  the  fore,  and  a  strong  bond  develops  be-

tween them. Parents take extreme care to invest their off-

spring with all the skills necessary for effective manipulation

and double-dealing. A mated pair seldom leaves its first set

of offspring untended, but may produce additional clutches

to fend for themselves while the first clutch grows up. Once

the first clutch reaches adulthood, the parents chase off the

youngsters and go their separate ways. If the pair is about

the  same  age,  they  divide  their  shared  territory  between

them. (Such agreements usually last at least a few decades

before  the  former  mates  seek  ways  to  encroach  on  each

others  turf.)  Otherwise,  the  younger  parent  leaves  at  the

same time the youngsters do.

Green dragons are not picky about the treasure they col-

lect.  Anything  valuable  will  do.  Among  items  of  similar

value, however, a green dragon favors the item that reminds

it of a particularly noteworthy triumph.

Green dragons often attack with little or no provocation,

especially when dealing with creatures passing through their

territory. (Such creatures dont offer much opportunity for a

scam or other long-term manipulation, so the dragon simply

attacks.) Victory in such an encounter often nets the dragon

some treasure and helps demonstrate the dragons power to

its  neighbors  and  subjects. The  dragon  typically  stalks  its

victims, studying them from afar and planning its assault. It

may  shadow  its  victims  for  days  before  attacking.  If  the

target appears weak, the dragon makes its presence known

quicklyit  enjoys  evoking  terror.  A  green  dragon  seldom

slays all its opponents, preferring instead to try to establish

control  over  one  of  the  survivors  by  using  intimidation  or

magical enchantments. It then questions its prisoner to learn

what is going on in the countryside, and if there is treasure

nearby. Green dragons occasionally release such prisoners if

they can arrange for a ransom payment. Otherwise, the pris-

oner must prove its value to the dragon daily or die.

RED DRAGONS

perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for

mountain  homes  often  brings  them  into  conflict  with

silver dragons, which red dragons passionately hate. Silver

dragons  usually  get  the  better  of  red  dragons  in  battle,

which  merely  serves  to  stoke  the  flames  of  resentment

among  red  dragons.  Red  dragons  also  vie  for  territory

with copper dragons from time to time, and the weaker

copper  dragons  are  often  hard-pressed  to  survive  any

direct confrontation.

A red dragon seeks out a large cave that extends deep into

the earth for its lair. Caves with some  kind  of volcanic  or

geothermal activity are the most highly prized. No matter

what its lair is like, however, the dragon always has a high

perch nearby from which to haughtily survey its territory.

Dungeon-dwelling red dragons seek out superheated or

fiery areas for their lairs. Since dungeons usually lack ele-

vated areas that offer panoramic views of the neighborhood,

red dragons living in such places often settle for open spaces

or areas with long corridors that offer broad views.

The most covetous of all true dragons, red dragons tirelessly

seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exception-

ally vain, even for dragons, which is reflected in their proud

bearing and disdainful expression.

Red dragons love mountainous terrain, but also inhabit

hilly regions, badlands, and other locales where they can

These horns can be straight or twisted, and can be any hue

from bone white to night black. Rows of small horns run

along  the  top  of  a  red  dragons  head,  and  the  dragon  has

small horns on its cheeks and lower jaw as well.

A red dragon has a beaked snout with a small nose

and chin horns. Its tongue is forked, and little flames often

dance in its nostrils and eye sockets when it is angry.

The dragon has fringed ears that tend to merge with the

cheek  horns  as  the  dragon  ages.  A  red  dragons  teeth  pro-

trude  when  its  mouth  is  closed,  and  it  has  a  single  back-

swept frill that begins behind the head and runs all the way

to the tip of the tail.

The small scales of wyrmlings are a bright glossy scarlet.

Toward the end of the young stage, the scales turn a deeper

red,  and  the  glossy  texture  is  replaced  by  a  smooth,  dull

finish. As the dragon grows older, the scales become large,

thick, and as strong as metal. The pupils of a red dragon fade

as  it  ages;  the  oldest  red  dragons  have  eyes  that  resemble

molten lava orbs.

The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon.

A red dragon has the longest wings of all chromatic drag-

ons,  both  in  actual  measurement  and  in  relation  to  body

length. This is mostly due to the outermost alar phalange,

which is very long and gives the wing a tapering look. The

longest  part  of  the  wing  is  right  at  the  trailing  edge. The

trailing edge of the wing membrane attaches to the dragons

body behind the rear lags and well down the tail. The wings

have a bluish or blue-black tint along the trailing edge (the

dragons frills show a similar pattern); the color resembles

metal burned blue in a fire.

The great horns on a red dragons head are clearly visible

from below.

Habits

Red dragons are so rapacious, ferocious, vengeful, and avari-

cious that scholars regard them as the archetypical evil drag-

ons.  Red  dragons  share  this  opinion  of  themselves.  They

believe that, above all other species, they are closest to the

ideals of draconic nature and behavior, and that the rest of

dragonkind has slipped from this purity.

Younger red dragons often find life difficult. Their vivid

red  scales  make  them  dangerously  conspicuous  in  most

landscapes, and so they lurk underground by day and ven-

ture  forth  only  at  night.  Older  red  dragons,  however,  are

both less vividly colored and more aware of their presumed

status as the epitome of dragonkind.

Red  dragons  are  the  most  obsessive  treasure  collectors

among the true dragons. They covet absolutely anything of

monetary  value  and  often  can  judge  a  baubles  worth  to

within a copper piece with just a glance.

Every  red  dragon  knows  the  exact  value  of  items  in  its

hoard, along with exactly how and when the dragon obtained

the item and each items exact location in the hoard. Bards

tell tales of sneak thieves who ignite a dragons wrath just by

stealing a single trinket.

Such tales are firmly grounded in fact, at least where red

dragons are concerned. In some cases, in fact, the tales fall

short of the mark. An adult red dragon can notice a single

coin missing from its hoard, and its rage over the pettiest

theft  is  legendary.  The  dragon  tracks  down  and  slays  the

thief if possible. If not, the dragon is sure to go on a ram-

page, killing anything it meets and laying waste to any town

or village where the thief might have taken refuge.

All red dragons are solitary by nature and fiercely territo-

rial;  they  keep  constant  watch  for  trespassers  of  any  kind

and  for  encroachment  by  other  dragons.  Entering  a  red

dragons territory uninvited is asking to be attacked. For all

their ferocious independence, however, red dragons always

seek to know about events in the wider world. They often

make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and

spies.  The  dragons  invariably  adopt  patronizing  attitudes

toward  these  servants,  and  do  not  hesitate  to  slay  and  eat

them when they bring bad news.

A  red  dragon  is  particularly  interested  in  news  about

other red dragons, mostly because its own status relative to

its peers remains a top concern. A red dragons pride is eas-

ily wounded, because any defeat or insult left unanswered

causes a loss of status. This is one reason why red dragons are

prone to destructive rages. A red dragon usually can recover

some lost status by wreaking havoc.

Every red dragon firmly believes that no being deserves

to  keep  anything  it  is  not  strong  enough  to  defend.  Red

dragons apply this rule to their own kind. Occasionally, red

dragons perceive weakness among one of their own, and the

subject is not allowed to live. The victim is attacked, and its

lair is stripped.

Courtship  among  red  dragons  can  be  a  perilous  affair,

because  most  would-be  suitors  are  treated  as  dangerous

rivals. Successful red dragon courtship usually involves a

younger  dragon  with  fairly  high  status  among  its  peers

carefully approaching an older one. Females do most of the

courting, but males are also known to do so. After mating,

the younger dragon is usually left to guard the eggs. Most

red  wyrmlings  are  left  to  fend  for  themselves.  Occasion-

ally,  two  parents  of  about  equal  age  mate  and  tend  their

young together.

Red dragons rarely fight for mates. Most are wise enough

to know that any battle will be fatal, and prudently quit the

field when a superior rival makes a claim.

Red  dragons  are  meat-eaters  by  preference,  and  their

favorite food is a human or elf youth. Their taste for the

flesh of young women is well documented. The dragons

steadfastly claim that such meat simply tastes better. Some-

times they force villagers into regularly sacrificing maidens

to them.

Red dragons are confident fighters for whom retreat or

compromise is not an option. They spend years formulating

plans  of  attack;  upon  spotting  potential  foes,  they  simply

choose a strategy and immediately put it into practice. Being

swift but not particularly agile flyers, they often choose to

fight on the ground when they can. There, red dragons often

display  considerable  mobility  and  tactical  savvy. They  are

excellent jumpers, and often leap from place or take short

flights  to  gain  the  most  favorable  position  possible  when

using spells or breath weapons. Any red dragon is well aware

that  its  fiery  breath  can  destroy  treasure,  and  it  uses  its

breath  weapon  judiciously  so  as  to  avoid  incinerating  the

spoils of victory.

For  all  its  legendary  ferocity,  a  red  dragon  also  knows

when not to attack. If it recognizes a superior foe, it (reluc-

tantly) withdraws to fight another day if it can do so without

losing  face.  Likewise,  when  dealing  with  a  clearly  weaker

foe, a red dragon might attempt to bully or fool the creature

into rendering it some service or supplying information. In

either case, the dragon gets what it wants, or the creature

dies. The dragon will accept no other outcomes.

Red  dragons  do  not  slay  every  foe  they  meet  in  battle.

Always conscious of status, they often allow a few survivors

to escape and spread word of the dragons victory.

SILVER DRAGONS

Silver Dragon Identifiers

Silver dragons enjoy the company of humanoids and often

take  the  form  of  kindly  old  men  or  fair  damsels.  They

cheerfully assist good creatures in genuine need, but usu-

ally avoid interfering with other creatures until their assis-

tance is requested or until inaction would allow something

evil to come to pass. They hate injustice and cruelty, though

they concern themselves less with punishing or rooting out

evildoers  than  with  protecting  the  innocent  and  healing

their hurts.

Though they can be found nearly anywhere, silver drag-

ons love high mountains and vast, open skies with billowing

clouds. They enjoy flying and sometimes soar for hours just

for the pleasure of it.

Silver and red dragons often come into conflict. This is

only  partly  because  they  lair  in  similar  territories.  Silver

dragons  despise  red  dragons  for  their  love  of  carnage  and

penchant for destruction. Duels between the two varieties

are furious and deadly, but silver dragons generally get the

upper hand, usually by working together against their foes,

and often by accepting assistance from nondragons.

Silver  dragons  prefer  aerial  lairs  on  secluded  mountain

peaks or amid the clouds themselves. A cloud lair always has

an enchanted area with a solid floor for laying eggs and stor-

ing treasure.

Silver dragons often dwell in towns or in dungeons. When

doing so, they typically take a humanoid form and blend in

with the rest of the population. They always situate them-

selves near one or more open areas where they have space to

assume their true forms when necessary.

A silver dragon in its true form can be recognized by the

smooth, shiny plate that forms its face. The dragon also has

a  frill  that  rises  high  over  its  head  and  continues  down

the neck and back to the tip of the tail. A silver dragon has

the tallest frill of any metallic or chromatic dragon. Long

spines with dark tips support the frill. The dragon also has

ear  frills  with  similar  spines.  It  has  two  smooth,  shiny

horns, also with dark tips.

A silver dragon has a beaklike nose and a strong chin with

a dangling frill that some observers say looks like a goatee.

It has a pointed tongue.

A silver wyrmlings scales are blue-gray with silver high-

lights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color slowly

brightens  until  the  individual  scales  are  scarcely  visible.

From  a  distance,  these  dragons  look  as  if  they  have  been

sculpted from pure metal. As a silver dragon grows older, its

pupils fade until in the oldest the eyes resemble orbs of mer-

cury. A silver dragon carries the scent of rain about it.

When viewed from below, a flying silver dragon shows a

remarkably similar profile to a red dragon. It has long wings

that  are  broadest  along  the  trailing  edge. The  wing  mem-

brane attaches to the dragons body behind the rear legs and

well down the tail, and the head has clearly visible horns. The

wings also show darker markings along the trailing edges,

just as a red dragons do. Fortunately, a silver dragon has one

minor feature that sets it apart from a red dragon: The outer

alar phalange forms a second thumb at the leading edge of

the each wing. Viewers unable to discern the dragons color

would do well to look for this vital detail.

Habits

A  silver  dragon  often  assumes  a  humanoid  from,  usually

appearing as a kindly old human or a comely young elf, and

spends most of its time in that form. Silver dragons do so to

more readily associate with humanoids.

Some  scholars  maintain  that  silver  dragons  prefer  the

company of humans or elves to that of other silver dragons.

As  with  most  things  draconic,  the  truth  is  more  complex

than that. Silver dragons believe themselves to be superior

to  most  other  beings,  just  as  other  kinds  of  dragons  do.

Unlike other dragons, however, silvers believe that being a

dragon imposes some limitations. Many of these are practi-

cal in nature, such as their massive size and the huge living

space requirements that go along with it.

What concerns silver dragons the most, however, is the

draconic  sense  of  time.  Theyre  happy  to  live  more  than

2,000  years,  but  they  constantly  fight  their  tendency  to

reflect on things and let opportunities pass them by. They

understand that short-lived races such as humans must seize

every opportunity that comes their way, which gives them a

drive toward accomplishment that most dragons lack. Silver

dragons seek to couple their own long perspective on the

world with humanitys dynamism. Its a lesson silver drag-

ons believe other dragons would do well to learn.

Though  lawful  and  good,  silver  dragons  have  no  great

love for hierarchies and formal authority. They believe that

living a moral life involves doing good deeds and taking no

actions that bring undeserved harm to other beings. Actions

that cause no harm are not their business. Silver dragons are

hardly pacifists, however, and they are quick to battle other

beings who would do evil or harm the innocent. They usu-

ally do not take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold

and bronze dragons tend to do. Silver dragons find that, in

time, evil tends to make itself felt almost everywhere, and

they seek to stamp it out whenever it appears in their vicin-

ity. Should they discover widespread evil looming over the

land, however, they are both willing and able to locate its

source and tackle it there.

Silver  dragons  form  loosely  knit  family  units  or  clans

with a matriarch or patriarch (called the senior) presiding.

The  senior  gives  advice,  settles  disputes,  and  coordinates

any actions the clan might take as a group. A clan of silver

dragons  can  be  spread  over  an  entire  continent,  with  the

individual dragons in it establishing their own lairs and oth-

erwise going about their business. Individual silver dragons

might  go  for  decades  without  associating  directly  with

other clan members, but the clan takes care of its own and is

always available to provide support or advice.

A silver dragon living among nondragons often develops

strong  attachments  to  its  nondragon  companions.  When

such  a  companion  earns  the  dragons  trust,  the  dragon

maintains  the  relationship  for  as  long  as  the  companion

lives, and may pick up the relationship with the compan-

ions descendants. A silver dragon always eventually reveals

its  true  nature  to  a  trusted  companion. This  honesty  re-

lieves any pangs of conscience the dragon may have about

deceiving its companions. It also prevents any awkward-

ness that may develop if the dragon has to ask some special

favor of a companion, such as taking care of the dragons

abode while it embarks on some venture that might take

decades to complete.

Courtship and mating among silver dragons is always a

civilized and decorous affair. They always seek mates out-

side their own clanmating within the clan is a serious

taboo. Either sex can initiate courtship. When two silver

dragons agree to be mates, they seek the approval of the

seniors from both clans. The approval is largely ceremo-

nial, and is rarely withheld (never without good reason).

Many silver dragons mate for life, but not all do so. Once

a  courtship  is  completed,  one  of  the  pair  leaves  its  clan

and joins the mates clan. Usually, the younger dragon or

the dragon of lower status is the one to change clans, but

this is not always so.

Silver dragons are dedicated omnivores and always seek

a variety of foods. Many prefer human fare and exist on it

exclusively  for  years  without  suffering  any  ill  effects.

Though  many  silver  dragons  have  favorite  dishes,  they

seldom pass up the chance to try something new.

Silver dragons prefer portable treasure that they can keep

with them while living among humanoids. They especially

prize  items  that  show  exceptional  workmanship,  every-

thing from carefully cut gems to intricate carvings to tex-

tiles and jewelry.

Silver dragons are nonviolent and avoid combat except

when  faced  with  evil  or  aggressive  foes.  Often  they

remain in their assumed forms and attempt to quickly end

battles  using  their  spells  and  magical  abilities.  When

fighting  in  their  true  forms,  they  prefer  to  remain  air-

borne,  and  they  use  any  clouds  in  the  area  to  conceal

themselves  and  to  take  advantage  of  their  cloudwalking

ability.  No  matter  who  or  how  they  are  fighting,  silver

dragons usually seek to eliminate the leader or the most

aggressive foe first, in hopes of persuading the survivors

to surrender or retreat.

WHITE DRAGONS

The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the

true dragons, white dragons prefer frigid climesusually

arctic areas, but sometimes very high mountains, especially

in  winter.  Mountain-dwelling  white  dragons  sometimes

have conflicts with red dragons living nearby, but the whites

are  wise  enough  to  avoid  the  more  powerful  red  dragons.

Red  dragons  tend  to  consider  white  dragons  unworthy

opponents  and  usually  are  content  to  let  a  white  dragon

neighbor skulk out of sight (and out of mind).

White dragons lairs are usually icy caves and deep sub-

terranean  chambers  that  open  away  from  the  warming

rays of the sun. Dungeon-dwelling white dragons prefer

cool areas and often lurk near water, where they can hide

and hunt.

White Dragon Identifiers

A  white  dragons  face  expresses  a  hunters  intense  and

single-minded ferocity. A white dragons head has a sleek

profile, with a small, sharp beak at the nose and a pointed

chin.  A  crest  supported  by  a  single  backward-curving

spine  tops  the  head. The  dragon  also  has  scaled  cheeks,

spiny dewlaps, and a few protruding teeth when its mouth

is closed.

When viewed from below, a white dragon shows a short

neck and a featureless head. Its wings appear blunted at the

tips.  The  trailing  edge  of  the  wing  shows  a  pink  or  blue

tinge, and the back edge of the wing membrane joins the

body near the back leg, at about mid-thigh.

The  scales  of  a  wyrmling  white  dragon  glisten  pure

white.  As  the  dragon  ages,  the  sheen  disappears,  and  by

very old age, scales of pale blue and light gray are mixed in

with the white.

Habits

A white dragon will consume only food that has been frozen.

Usually  a  white  dragon  devours  a  creature  killed  by  its

breath  weapon  while  the  carcass  is  still  stiff  and  frigid.  It

buries other kills in snowbanks within or near its lair until

they are suitably frozen. Finding such a larder is a good indi-

cation that a white dragon lives nearby.

White dragons love the cold sheen and sparkle of ice,

and they favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly

diamonds.

White dragons spurn the society of others of their kind,

except for members of the opposite sex. They are prone to

carnal pleasures and often mate just for the fun of it. They

seldom tend their eggs, but they often lay their eggs near

their lairs, and one or both parents allow the youngsters to

move in for a time. The offspring are expected to care for

themselves, but they gain some measure of protection and

education from having their parents nearby.

It would be a mistake to consider a white dragon a stupid

creature.  Older  white  dragons  are  at  least  as  intelligent  as

humans,  and  even  younger  ones  are  much  smarter  than

predatory animals. Though not known for their foresight,

white dragons prove cunning when hunting or defending

their lairs and territories. White dragons know all the best

ambush  spots  for  miles  around  their  lairs,  and  they  are

clever  enough  to  pick  out  targets  and  concentrate  attacks

until one foe falls, then move on to the next foe. White drag-

ons  prefer  sudden  assaults,  swooping  down  from  aloft  or

bursting from beneath water, snow, or ice. They loose their

breath  weapons,  then  try  to  knock  out  a  single  opponent

with a follow-up attack.

Although they are not pillars of intellect, white dragons

have  good  memories,  especially  for  events  they  have  wit-

nessed or experienced directly. They remember any slight or

defeat and have been known to conduct malicious vendet-

tas against beings or groups that have offended them.

his chapter offers guidelines to the Dungeon Master

for  running  the  actual  mechanics  of  an  encounter

with a dragon, incorporating dragons into the cam-

paign, and developing dragons as characters with new

feats, spells, magic items, and prestige classes designed

specifically for dragons.

DRAGONS IN

THE CAMPAIGN

Its no coincidence that the name of the game is DUNGEONS

&DRAGONS: Dragons are iconic figures in the fantasy genre.

Dragons appear at every Challenge Rating from 1 through

28 (or higher, with templates), meaning that its quite likely

characters  will  face  them  regularly  throughout  their

careers. For some campaigns, its enough to have dragons

crop up as tough encounters in dungeons and wilderness

treks. For other campaigns, spending some time to deter-

mine what role dragons will play in the campaign can be

rewarding for the DM and players alike.

DRAGONS AS MONSTERS

Theres nothing wrong with dragons being no more spe-

cial or important than any other monster in the Monster

Manual, at least as far as your campaign structure is con-

cerned.  Using  this  book  will  help  you  ensure  that  an

encounter with a dragon is always memorable, but it need

not be anything more than thata tough fight your

players will talk about for months, but not the turn-

ing point of the campaign.

If  dragons  are  just  monsters  in  the  campaign,

they  often  appear  as  climactic  encounters  in  dun-

geons,  frequently  as  wandering  encounters  in  the

wilderness, and only rarely as the major motivators

behind  adventures  or  campaign  themes.  Dragons

often  appear  as  secondary  villains,  the  cohorts,

allies, or even minions of greater, often humanoid,

masterminds. As brilliant as they can be, dragons

rarely appear as masterminds themselves.

Here are some possible adventure hooks to get

characters  involved  with  one  or  more  dragons

as monsters:

A dragon is terrorizing farmland and devour-

ing livestock, and must be stopped.

A  dragon  demands  tribute  from  a  nearby

village.

A dragon has made its lair in a wilderness

area  formerly  inhabited  by  other  monsters,

which are now moving in on civilized territory

to escape the dragon.

A  good  dragon  disguised  as  a  human  needs

help to find a magic item stolen from its hoard.

An  evil  dragon  is  holding  a  paladin  for

ransom.

A blackguard with a dragon cohort is tyrannizing a city.

An epic villain has acquired one of the Orbs of Dragon-

kind and is marshaling an army of dragons to lay waste to

a nation.

Some  of  these  hooks  are  almost  clichs  of  the  fantasy

genre, but even clichs can be satisfying experiences for

players, especially newer ones, who enjoy the triumphant

feeling of having vanquished a dragon.

DRAGONS AS PLOTTERS AND SCHEMERS

A campaign that features dragons as more than just mon-

sters highlights their great intelligence and the unhurried

perspective that comes from having a life span of fifteen

centuries  or  more,  portraying  dragons  as  plotters  and

schemers. In such a campaign, dragons often work behind

the  scenes,  generating  adventure  seeds  less  through  their

direct actions and more through the actions of their min-

ions, agents, and allies, and the plans they set in motion.

Dragons  in  such  a  campaign  command  the  respect  they

deservenot  just  from  the  player  characters,  but  from

NPCs  as  well,  from  commoners  to  aristocrats.  They  use

that respect to build networks, lure minions, recruit agents,

collect tribute, and evolve powers beyond their usual phys-

ical and magical abilities.

In  their  role  as  plotters  and  schemers,  dragons  often

appear as masterminds whose plans set adventures or short

campaign arcs in motion. Dragons are usually primary vil-

lains,  with  nondragon  monsters  and  NPCs  in  the  roles  of

secondary villains and minions.

Sample  adventure  hooks  involving  dragons  as  plotters

and schemers might include the following:

A  dragon  allows  certain  items  to  be  stolen  from  its

hoard, knowing them to be cursed.

An evil dragon tries to frame a good dragon for its own evil

deeds, then entices adventurers to slay the supposed villain.

A powerful green dragon sends its gang of half-dragon

children to find the Green Orb of Dragonkind before someone

else does.

DRAGONS AS MOVERS AND SHAKERS

In some campaigns, dragons are even more central forces

not only masterminds whose plans set adventures in motion,

but the rulers of kingdoms, the patrons of adventurers, and

the moving forces behind entire eras of history. Dragons in

these  campaigns  are  the  objects  of  awe,  terror,  and  rever-

ence, the movers and shakers of the campaign world. Their

intelligence, long life span, and sheer power make them the

major powers of the campaign world. In some campaigns,

they may even replace outsiders such as demons, devils, and

celestials as the standard bearers of their alignments and the

champions of the deities.

In their role as movers and shakers, dragons rarely appear

as  random  or  trivial  encounters.  A  dragon  encounter  is

always laden with significance.

Sample adventure hooks involving dragons as movers and

shakers might include the following:

A great wyrm who rules an evil kingdom mobilizes its

forces  for  war  against  a  neighboring  kingdom  ruled  by  a

good dragon.

A dragon cleric of Bahamut hires (or commands) adven-

turers to retrieve a draconic relic stolen by the followers

of Tiamat.

VARIANT RULE: SIZE BY DRAGON TYPE

To  add  variety  to  dragon  encounters,  consider  adjusting  the

reach of some dragons natural attacks as described below.

Blue: A blue dragons relatively short neck decreases its bite

reach at certain sizes, to 10 feet for a Huge dragon and 15 feet

for a Gargantuan dragon.

Brass: A  brass  dragons  relatively  short  neck  decreases  its

bite reach at certain sizes, to 10 feet for a Huge dragon and 15

feet for a Gargantuan dragon.

Gold: A  gold  dragons  extremely  long  tail  increases  its  tail

slap reach and tail sweep radius by 50%, to 15 feet for a Large

dragon,  30  feet  for  a  Huge  dragon,  45  feet  for  a  Gargantuan

dragon, and 60 feet for a Colossal dragon.

Green: A  green  dragon  has  a  long  neck  and  front  claws.  A

Medium green dragon has a reach of 10 feet with its bite attack.

A Large green dragon has a reach of 15 feet with its bite attack

and 10 feet with its claw attacks. A Huge green dragon has a

reach of 20 feet with its bite attack and 15 feet with its claw at-

tacks. A Gargantuan green dragon has a reach of 25 feet with

its bite attack and 20 feet with its claw attacks.

Deep: A deep dragons extremely long neck increases its bite

reach to 10 feet for a Medium dragon, 15 feet for a Large dragon,

20 feet for a Huge dragon, and 25 feet for a Gargantuan dragon.

Fang: A  fang  dragons  extremely  long  tail  increases  its  tail

slap reach and tail sweep radius by 50%, to 15 feet for a Large

dragon, 30 feet for a Huge dragon, and 45 feet for a Gargan-

tuan dragon.

RUNNING A DRAGON

ENCOUNTER

Dragons are a nightmare in combatsometimes as much

for  the  DM  as  for  the  players  and  their  characters. They

possess  such  an  extensive  array  of  attack  options,  special

abilities, and even movement capabilities that they can be

bewildering to play. This section deals with issues of move-

ment  (including  aerial  combat)  and  hard  mathematical

answers to questions such as Should the dragon incinerate

Lidda and Jozan, or tear Tordek limb from limb?

THE MECHANICS OF MELEE

As a dragon gets larger, not only does it gain additional Hit

Dice, better natural armor, and increased ability scores, it

gains new physical attack forms. As a result, a dragons tactics

are necessarily dependent, at least to some extent, on its size.

Table  21:  Expanded  Dragon  Space  and  Reach  summa-

rizes the information presented in Chapter 1 for each kind

of dragon.

Tiny dragons have a problem. To start with, they have only

three natural attacks, with average damage (assuming three

hits)  of  6.5  pointsmost Tiny  dragons  dont  even  have  a

Strength bonus going for them. Getting in three hits is dif-

ficult for them, however. Though they can bite adjacent foes,

their claws have no reach. Making a full attack, then, means

entering  an  opponents  square,  provoking  an  attack  of

opportunity in the process. Most Tiny wyrmlings prefer to

stay  out  of  the  reach  of  opponents  and  use  their  breath

weapons as often as possible.

Like Tiny dragons, Small dragons have only three natural

attacks. However, their average damage is better9.5 points

of  damage,  including  a  +1  Strength  modifier  on  the  bite

attackand,  more  important,  their  bite  and  claw  attacks

can  reach  adjacent  opponents.  They  need  never  enter  an

opponents square to make a full attack. Even so, most Small

dragons are better off using their breath weapons, employ-

ing their good speed to remain out of harms way while straf-

ing their foes with breath attacks.

Medium dragons gain the ability to make attacks with

their  wings,  increasing  their  average  damage  (again,

assuming five hits) to about 22.5 to 23.5, depending on the

dragons Strength bonus.

A Large dragon has reached its maximum number of nat-

ural attacks, six, with the addition of a tail slap. With six suc-

cessful  attacks,  a  Large  dragon  can  dish  out  an  average  of

45.5 to 54.5 points of damage, or as many as 65.5 on average

for red and gold dragons because of their higher Strength

scores.  Large  dragons  also  gain  10  feet  of  reach  (with  all

their attacks except their claws), which greatly reduces the

threat  of  attacks  of  opportunity  from  smaller  opponents.

Large dragons are no longer afraid of wading right into the

thick of melee, though they try to keep as many opponents

as possible at necks length (the reach of their bite attack),

even if it means sacrificing claw attacks. Even Large dragons

almost always lead off with their breath weapons, however,

and if significantly hurt in melee they take to the air and

resume their ranged breath attacks.

A Huge dragon still has six natural attacks, but now all of

them have reachincluding 20 feet of reach for its tail slap

attack (or more, for some dragon varieties). Few opponents

can close with a Huge dragon without provoking an attack

of  opportunity.  With  its  impressive  reach,  a  Huge  dragon

can easily attack foes spread out all over a battlefield, which

are hard to catch within the area of a single breath weapon

attack. Its average full attack damage (assuming six hits) is in

the  range  of  75  to  86  points  of  damage  (higher  for  a  gold

dragon). Dragons of this size keep their breath weapons in

reserve  for  those  special  occasions  when  their  opponents

are clustered together and can all be caught in the breath

weapons area.

A Gargantuan dragons. average damage on a full attack

that scores six hits ranges from 109 to 118 points, or up to

120 or 126 points (for strong red and gold dragons).

A Colossal dragons average full attack damage is in the

neighborhood  of  150  points.  Dragons  of  Gargantuan  or

Colossal size fear nothing that is not divine, and are intel-

ligent enough to make the best use of their melee attacks

and all their other abilities.

FIGHTING ON THE WING

Most dragons enjoy fighting in the air, even though they are

not necessarily at an advantage when doing soparticularly

when fighting more maneuverable characters under the effect

of fly spells. But the rush of air beneath the wings, the whistle

of wind in the ears, and the sensations of diving, swoop-

ing, and soaring combine very favorably with the taste of

blood and the smell of gore, at least in the estimation of

most evil dragons.

The greatest limitation of a dragon fighting on the wing

is  its  maneuverability.  Only Tiny  and  Small  dragons  have

even average maneuverability, which forces them to move

at  least  half  their  flying  speed  (5075  feet)  forward  every

round  and  prevents  them  from  turning  more  than  90

degrees in a single move. Of all dragons, Tiny and Small

dragons  are  most  likely  to  attempt  aerial  combat  in  rela-

tively close quartersas long as they have at least 10 feet in

which to maneuver, they can fly back and forth or even in a

circle to fight opponents on the ground.

A  portion  of  the  Flight  diagram  below  shows  a  Small

dragon making a 180-degree turn. It moves forward 5 feet

and  turns  45  degrees  for  free,  then  spends  5  feet  of  its

speed  to  turn  an  additional  45  degrees  in  the  same  space.

Then it moves forward another 5 feet, turning another 90

degrees in the same way. It has actually covered only 10 feet

of distance, while using 20 feet of its movement.

Medium, Large, and Huge dragons have poor maneuver-

ability. Like smaller dragons, they must move at least half

their flying speed (75100 feet) forward every round. They

cannot turn more than 45 degrees in a single space or climb

at more than a 45-degree angle, and they have to fly at least

20 feet to make a 180-degree turn. A dragon of this size wont

attempt to fight on the wing unless it can move through

a  rectangular  area  at  least  20  feet  wide  (for  a  Medium

dragon) or 30 feet wide (for a Huge dragon) to maneuver,

and at least as long as the dragons fly speed. An area of this

size allows a dragon to make strafing runs against creatures

on the ground.

A portion of the Flight diagram below shows a Medium

dragon making  a  180-degree  turn.  Poor  maneuverability

doesnt allow the dragon to turn more than 45 degrees in

a single space, so it makes a wider turn. It moves forward

5 feet while turning 45 degrees, moves 5 feet on the diag-

onal while turning another 45 degrees, continues another 5

feet  and  turns  another  45  degrees,  then  moves  along

another diagonal, which counts as 10 feet (for the second

diagonal), and completes the turn. It uses 25 feet of its speed

to make the turn.

The Strafing Run (Poor Maneuverability) diagram on the

next  page  shows  a  Medium  dragons  path  back  and  forth

along a 20-foot wide chasm, using Flyby Attack to harry oppo-

nents on the ground while it flies. Assuming the dragon has

a speed of 150 feet, it has two options: It can fly slowly while

maintaining its minimum forward speed of 75 feet, making

one run past its opponents each round and ending between

runs on the location marked 75. Alternatively, it can fly at

full speed, make two runs past its opponents (though it can

only attack once), and end where it began, in position to do

the same pattern in the next round.

Gargantuan and Colossal dragons have clumsy maneuver-

ability, though their flying speed is tremendous. They also

must move at least half their flying speed (100125 feet)

forward every round. Their turning radius is even larger:

They  must  fly  at  least  40  feet  to  make  a  180-degree  turn.

Dragons this enormous wont engage in aerial combat unless

the available space is twice as wide as they are (60 feet for a

Gargantuan dragon, 120 feet for a Colossal one).

The Clumsy Maneuverability diagram below shows a Gar-

gantuan dragon making a 180-degree turn. It must move 10

feet before it can turn 45 degrees. It starts out forward for

10 feet and turns 45 degrees. It then crosses two diagonals

(15 feet) before turning another 45 degrees. It goes straight

another  10  feet  and  turns  another  45  degrees,  then  crosses

two more diagonals (15 feet) to finish the turn. It uses 50 feet

of its speed to make the turn, whipping its enormous body

around behind it as it flies. (In this diagram, the movement

is all counted using one square of the dragons large space

the one right next to its head, near the center of its front face.

The results are the same whichever square you use.)

The Wingover feat is a tremendous improvement to any

dragons maneuverability, allowing it to make a 180-degree

turn in a single space at the cost of 10 feet of speed. In this

single aspect, the dragons maneuverability is the equivalent

of perfect when it uses this feat. A portion of the Flight dia-

gram  on  the  previous  page  illustrates  a  Medium  dragon

using the Wingover feat in the course of moving 15 feet of

its normal movement, at the cost of 25 feet of speed.

Flyby Attack is an all-but-essential feat for dragons, for it

makes the strafing run possible. Using this feat, a dragon

can start flying, use its breath weapon against creatures on

the ground even in the air near its flight path, and continue

flying, keeping out of reach. It can remain out of reach until

its  breath  weapon  is  ready  to  use  again,  then  return  for

another run. Without Flyby Attack, the dragon must make

its  attack  either  before  or  after  it  moves,  which  gives  its

opponents too much opportunity to catch up.

A dragons rapid fly speed (two to four times as fast as a

wizard with a fly spell cast on herself, and up to six times as

fast as a heavily armored fighter with fly) makes it easy to

remain out of reach of most opponents. A dragon that starts

its  turn  100  feet  south  of  its  opponents  can  fly  right  over

their  heads,  use  its  breath  weapon  on  them,  and  then

(assuming it has Flyby Attack) continue on to a point 100

feet north of them. Lightly armored opponents (with a fly

speed of 60 feet) could get within 40 feet and cast a spell,

or could charge and attack the dragon once. More heavily

armored  characters  cant  even  get  that  close. The  strafing

run certainly isnt a foolproof tactic for dragons, but it is a

very good one.

USING A BREATH WEAPON

A dragons breath weapon has its point of origin at any posi-

tion along the outside of the dragons space. From there, it

can extend in any direction, including back into the dragons

space. All dragons are immune to the effects of their own

breath  weapons,  so  there  is  nothing  preventing  a  dragon

from  targeting  creatures  in  its  own  space  with  its  breath

weaponafter crushing them, for example.

The Cone-Shaped Breath Weapons diagram on the next

page  illustrates  the  size  and  shape  of  cone-shaped  breath

weapons on a grid with 5-foot squares.

After using its breath weapon, a dragon must wait at least

a few seconds before it can use it again. Under normal cir-

cumstances the delay is 1d4 rounds, but the Recover Breath

feat shortens that time, while the application of metabreath

feats extends it. A dragon always knows how long it must

wait before using its breath weapon again, and plans its tac-

tics accordingly. If a dragon is engaged in strafing runs over

a  landbound  group  of  opponents,  it  knows  that  it  can  fly

away for half the time until it can breathe again. Then it can

turn around and still reach its foes again just as its breath

weapon is ready for another use. Similarly, it can throw itself

into melee for a few rounds; then, in the round before it can

use its breath weapon again, it can make a single attack and

change position to make best use of its breath weapon the

next round.

As a rule, dragons are observant enough to notice if their

opponents are not suffering the full effects of their breath

weapons.  After  a  single  blast  of  its  breath  weapon,  a  red

dragon has a good idea of who among its foes is warded with

protection from energy (fire) and who has improved evasion. If

its breath weapon is clearly ineffective against most of its

opponents, any dragon is smart enough to change its tactics

or even withdraw.

TO BREATHE OR NOT TO BREATHE?

A breath weapon is a dragons most fearsome attack, but it is

not always the most effective. Depending on the foes and

the circumstances, using a breath weapon may or may not

be the best option.

The essential difference between a breath weapon and

any combination of melee attacks is that total melee dam-

age is a fixed amount, while total breath weapon damage

depends on the number of creatures caught in the breaths

area. A Colossal dragon might dish out an average of 150

points of damage with a full attack action, but it has the

choice of either dealing all that damage to one target or

dividing it among up to six targets. A Colossal silver great

wyrm can deal an average of 108 points of damage with

its icy breath, but it deals the same damage to a dozen tar-

gets caught in its 70-foot cone as to a single target. If it

catches ten targets, it has the potential to deal 1,080 points

of damage (reduced by the possibility of successful saving

throws and evasion)and still have time to move, either

to line up its targets before breathing again or to fly out

of reach.

At  the  simplest  level,  this  difference  means  its  almost

always better for a dragon to use a breath weapon than to

make melee attacks when facing more opponents than the

dragon has natural weapons. Surrounded by two dozen mili-

tia soldiers, a Large red dragon can likely incinerate them

all with a single blast of fire, while it would take 4 rounds to

kill them all with melee attacks (assuming every attack was

a successful kill). Of course, the fact that the breath weapon

is more efficient doesnt always mean that its preferable

an evil dragon completely unconcerned by the militia sol-

diers nonmagical spears might enjoy spending the 4 rounds

playing with her food.

Faced with a choice of standard actions, using the breath

weapon  is  almost  always  a  better  option  than  making  a

single  melee  attack.  Even  if  its  impossible  to  target  more

than one foe, the breath weapon will deal more damage, on

average, than the bite. The only situation where this is even

a close call is if the single target in question is a rogue, monk,

or other character with evasion. In such a case, breathing is

only marginally better than bitingand its a small enough

margin that the dragon might be better off saving its breath.

If the single target has improved evasion, breathing actually

becomes a worse choice than biting.

If a dragon can aim its breath weapon to catch more than

one foe, theres no question about which kind of attack to

makethe  breath  weapon  always  deals  superior  damage

against multiple foes when compared to the bite.

Faced with a choice between using a breath weapon and

making  a  full  attack  on  one  or  more  foes,  the  choice  is

somewhat less clear. For a Medium or smaller dragon, the

breath weapon is still a better option. For a larger dragon,

the choice depends largely on how many foes it can catch

with  its  breath  weapon.  If  it  could  only  breathe  on  one

foe, it will deal more damage by making a full attack. If it

can catch two or more foes in its breath weapon, breathing

is a better choice.

Using a breath weapon is almost always a better option

than using an area-damaging spell. The saving throw DC

against  a  great  wyrms  breath  weapon  is  10  to  15  higher

than the save DC of its highest-level spells, and the dam-

age potential is better as well. A bronze great wyrm that

casts delayed blast fireball deals 19d6 points of damage with

a saving throw DC of 25. The dragon is better served using

its breath weapon (damage 24d6, save DC 37). A 20th-level

rogue  has  a  decent  chance  of  failing  her  saving  throw

against the dragons breath, but will most likely succeed

against the delayed blast fireball.

All  this  logic  begins  to  break  down,  however,  when  a

dragon  is  facing  enemies  prepared  to  fight,  particularly  if

the foes are expecting a dragon of a certain variety. Once a

spellcaster  casts  protection  from  energy on  the  whole  party,

warding  them  against  the  dragons  breath  weapon,  the

breath  option  becomes  much  weaker.  However,  even  this

depends on circumstances. If the dragon uses Flyby Attack

to  strafe  its  enemies  with  its

breath  weapon  while  staying

mostly out of reach, two or

three blasts with

a breath weapon are likely to wipe out most protection from

energy spells.

Spells can be a valuable alternative to the breath weapon

in  cases  where  opponents  are  protected  by  magic.  Adven-

turers  facing  a  white  great  wyrm  are  likely  to  be  warded

against cold, but theyre less likely to be expecting the chain

lightning spell the dragon has in its repertoire. Most often,

though,  the  lower  saving  throw  DC  greatly  reduces  the

effectiveness of a dragons spells compared to what its breath

weapon can do. A dragon is best off using spells to alter the

conditions of the fight in its favor, as discussed in Dragons

as Spellcasters, below.

USING SPECIAL ATTACK FORMS

Compared  to  the  effectiveness  of  a  breath  weapon  for  a

Huge or larger dragon, the big dragons special melee attack

formscrush  and  tail  sweepare  almost  insignificant,

though still perilous for those that get in the way. Both tac-

tics are commonly used by confident, even cocky dragons

that feel quite sure of victory, and less often by more cau-

tious  dragons.  The  use  of  the  tail  sweep,  in  particular,  is

often  likened  to  the  way  a  cat  treats  a  mouse  it  isnt  quite

ready to eat yet. Both the crush and the tail sweep are, in

effect, area melee attacks.

Crush: A crush attack can be quite fearsome, particularly

because  of  the  lingering  effects  of  being  pinned.  Follow

these steps to resolve a dragons crush attack.

1)  If  the  dragon  is  on  the  ground  when  it  begins  the

attack,  it  makes  a  Jump  check. The  dragon  must  achieve

enough vertical distance with the jump to clear

the  heads  of  the  creatures  it  wants  to  crush.

This Colossal gold dragons tail sweep scatters

a band of hobgoblins like matchsticks.

Table  22:  Jump  DCs  to

Crush  Opponents  shows  the  Jump

DCs required for a dragon (with a land

speed of either 40 or 60 feet) to reach

the  required  height  with  either  a

standing  high  jump  or  a  running

high jump.

If  the  dragon  is  flying,  no  Jump

check  is  required;  it  simply  lands  on

the opponents it wants to crush.

2) Determine how many creatures are in the target area.

The crush attack affects any creatures located completely

within the dragons space when it lands: a 15-foot-by-15-

foot square for a Huge dragon, a 20-foot-by-20-foot square

for a Gargantuan dragon, or a 30-foot-by-30-foot square

for a Colossal dragon.

3) After the

dragon  lands,

each  creature  in  the  target  area  must  roll  a  Reflex  save

against  a  DC  equal  to  that  of  the  dragons  breath  weapon.

Creatures  that  succeed  on  their  saving  throws  take  half

the dragons crush damage. They remain in their spaces

because the dragon is at least three sizes larger than they are,

they can occupy the same space as the dragon. Creatures

that  fail  their  saving  throws  take  full  damage  and  are

pinned. Roll the crush damage once and apply the result (or

half of it) to each affected character.

Pinned characters cannot move. They take a 4 penalty

to their Armor Class against all opponents other than the

dragon, but they are not helpless.

4) On its turn, a pinned creature may try to escape. A

character that makes a successful opposed grapple check

(as  a  melee  attack)  or  Escape  Artist  check  (as  a  standard

action) is no longer pinned but is still grappling with the

dragon.  If  a  character  makes  two  successful  opposed

checks against the dragon, the character has escaped the

grapple entirely.

5) On the dragons next turn, it can choose to maintain the

pin or to release pinned characters. If it tries to maintain the

pin,  it  makes  a  single  grapple  check  opposed  by  grapple

checks made by all pinned opponents. Creatures who beat

the  dragons  grapple  check  take  no  damage,  while  other

creatures take the dragons full crush damage. If the dragon

decides not to maintain the pin, it can act normally, without

regard to the creatures that share its space (since they are

necessarily at least three sizes smaller than it is).

Tail Sweep: When making a tail sweep attack, a dragon

chooses  half  of  the  area  it  threatens  with  its  tail  slap

attacka  semicircle  with  a  radius  of  30  feet  if  it  is  Gar-

gantuan or 40 feet if it is Colossal (more for certain dragon

types, notably gold and white, with their longer tails). Crea-

tures within that area are affected if they are four or more

sizes smaller than the dragonSmall or smaller for a Gar-

gantuan dragon, Medium or smaller for a Colossal dragon.

Affected  creatures  take  the  dragons  tail  sweep  damage

(including  1-1/2  times  its  Strength  bonus),  or  half  that

amount if they make a successful Reflex save against a DC

equal to that of the dragons breath weapon. Roll the tail

sweep damage once and apply the result (or half of it) to

each affected character.

Two feats, described in the next section of this chapter,

can enhance a dragons tail sweep. Whirlwind Tail Sweep

allows  the  dragon  to  affect  a  circular  area  rather  than  a

semicircle,  while  Tail  Sweep  Knockdown  knocks  prone

any characters who fail their saving throws.

DRAGONS AS SPELLCASTERS

It is both a recognition of the limitations of dragons innate

spellcasting  ability  and  a  testament  to  their  incredible

combat  prowess  that,  as  a  rule,  a  dragons  physical  attacks

and breath weapon are more effective than its spells. In gen-

eral, a dragon casts spells as effectively as a sorcerer some

five to eight levels lower than its Challenge Rating, so that

most dragons are not the spellcasting equals of the charac-

ters  they  typically  fight.  This  fact  means,  among  other

things, that a dragons offensive spells are rarely effective in

a combat against equals, as useful as they may be in terroriz-

ing villagers. The saving throw DCs for a dragons spells are

easy for a character to make if his or her level is about the

same as the dragons CR. A dragons best use of spells is to

alter  the  conditions  of  the  fight  in  its  favor,  rather  than

directly  targeting  characters  who  will  succeed  on  their

saving throws most of the time.

Dispel magic is a good way to remove the carefully pre-

pared protections and wards that most adventurers cloak

themselves in before venturing to fight a dragon. Unfor-

tunately for the dragons, the disparity between their caster

level and their opponents levels makes dispel magic a long-

shot  gamble. The  dispelling  breath spell  (see  page  78)  is  a

slightly better option than dispel magic: It lets the dragon

use its breath weapon and make a targeted dispel attempt

against every creature that fails its saving throw against the

breath. The  dragons  caster  level  check  is  still  going  to  be

hard to make, but the dragon will get more chances to roll

high and dispel some of the opponents protection. Every

successful dispel check is one more factor adjusted in the

dragons favor.

Altering the battlefield is another way of adjusting condi-

tions in the dragons favor. With its array of special abilities

and immunities, a dragons best strategy is to create condi-

tions that hinder its opponents without hindering itself

at least not as much.

A dragons blindsense is perhaps its single best quality for

this purpose. Blindsense gives a dragon a distinct advantage

over characters who rely on sight (whether regular vision or

darkvision), and a smart dragon maximizes this advantage

by using spells that impair its opponents vision, such as

deeper  darkness.  Dragons  certainly  enjoy  seeing  their  foes

expressions of dismay, and want to be visible to inspire the

proper amount of terror in their opponents, but in a tough

fight, swathing the battlefield in magical darkness is func-

tionally equivalent to greater invisibility.

Even a minor spell such as obscuring mist or fog cloud hin-

ders a dragons foes while imposing no obstacle to its blind-

sense, and thus offers the dragon a distinct advantage. Other

fog spells, such as stinking cloud, cloudkill, and incendiary cloud,

add injury to insult by dealing damage (or inflicting nausea)

in addition to restricting vision.

Along the same lines, solid fog limits opponents mobil-

ity while granting a dragon concealment. Black dragons,

with their immunity to acid, naturally favor acid fog for the

same purpose.

A dragons energy immunity can also work to its benefit

in  conjunction  with  spellcasting.  A  red,  brass,  or  gold

dragon  can  easily  attack  through  a  wall  of  fire, taking  no

impairment or damage, while forcing opponents to weather

the flames to reach it. This tactic can wear down protection

from energy spells that ward the dragons foes.

Perhaps the most dramatic means of altering the condi-

tions  of  the  battlefield  is  the  antimagic  field spell.  Most

dragons can function just fine in an antimagic field, though

sacrificing  their  breath  weapon  is  a  difficult  choice.  A

dragons full attack against a character with no magical pro-

tection is simply devastating, and the complete protection

from hostile magic offered by the field is worth the loss of

the dragons own spells, spell-like abilities, and even super-

natural abilities (including its breath weapon and damage

reduction).  Dragons  particularly  favor  this  tactic  when

faced  with  opponents  who  are  well  prepared  to  exploit

their energy vulnerability.

Of course, the most direct way for a dragon to give itself

an advantage in combat through spellcasting is to cast spells

on  itself  that  enhance  its  abilities.  Bulls  strength and bears

endurance are obvious choices for any dragon. Many dragons

also favor cats grace, improving their average Dexterity score

so they gain +2 to Armor Class and +2 on Reflex saves. Eagles

splendor can give a slight boost to a dragons spell and spell-

like ability saving throw DCs, and also makes its frightful

presence that much harder to resist.

Dragons love haste, and not just for the extra (often sixth!)

attack it gives them when making a full attack. A +1 bonus

on  attack  rolls  is  often  just  that  much  more  cushion  for

using Power Attack, since dragons rarely have much diffi-

culty hitting their foes. A +1 bonus to Armor Class is always

welcome, and increasing a dragons speed by 30 feet makes

it outpace every opponent that much more.

Dragons who have access to the cleric spell list (including

blue and red dragons, as well as all metallic dragons) always

learn cure spells, and learn heal when they can. Few events can

wipe  the  self-confident  smirks  off  player  characters  faces

like  seeing  a  dragon  who  was  sorely  wounded  suddenly

recover more than 100 hit points!

Strange as it seems, dragons sometimes learn fly and cast

it on themselves before entering battle. Relying on magic to

fly reduces a dragons speed significantly, but increases its

maneuverability  drastically.  Particularly  when  faced  with

humanoid foes that are airborne through the same means, a

dragon is often willing to trade speed for the ability to hover

and turn on a dime. Other dragons prefer spells and feats

that improve their maneuverability, however.

DRAGON FEATS

In  addition  to  general  feats  (such  as  those  described  in

Chapter 5 of the Players Handbook), this book introduces a

new kind of feat, the metabreath feat, and contains infor-

mation  on  epic  feats  (from  the  Epic  Level  Handbook)  and

monstrous feats (from Savage Species).

EPIC FEATS

These feats are available to characters of 21st level or higher.

Dragons of at least old age also can choose these feats even

if they have no class levels. A selection of epic feats appro-

priate for dragons is presented here. See the Epic Level Hand-

book for more epic feats.

METABREATH FEATS

Dragons (and other creatures) have developed ways to con-

trol  their  breath  weapons  to  produce  varying  degrees  of

effects, from the subtle to the conspicuous. To take a meta-

breath  feat,  a  creature  must  have  a  breath  weapon  whose

time between breaths is expressed in rounds. Therefore, a

hell hound (which can breathe once every 2d4 rounds) can

take  metabreath  feats,  whereas  a  behir  (breath  weapon

usable 1/minute) cannot.

Effects of Metabreath Feats: In all ways, a metabreath

weapon operates in its usual fashion unless the feat specifi-

cally changes some aspect of the breath weapon.

Using a metabreath feat puts stress on a dragons mind and

body, increasing the time it must wait until the dragon can

use its breath weapon again. Normally, a dragon must wait

1d4  rounds  between  breaths.  Using  a  metabreath  weapon

increases  that  wait  by  1  round  or  more.  For  example,  if  a

dragon uses an enlarged breath weapon, it must wait 1d4+1

rounds before breathing again.

Multiple  Metabreath  Feats  on  a  Breath  Weapon: A

dragon can use multiple metabreath feats on a single breath.

All  increases  to  the  time  the  dragon  must  wait  before

breathing again are cumulative. For example, if a dragon

uses  an  enlarged  and  maximized  breath  weapon,  it  must

wait 1d4+4 rounds before breathing again.

A dragon can use the same metabreath feat multiple times

on  the  same  breath.  In  some  cases,  this  has  no  additional

effects. In other cases, the feats effects are stackable. Apply

the  feats  effect  to  the  base  values  for  the  breath  weapon

once for each time the feat is applied and add up the extra

time  the  dragon  must  wait  before  breathing  again.  For

example, a Small dragon with a line-shaped breath weapon

could use Enlarge Breath twice on the same breath. Since

the base length of the line is 40 feet, the doubly enlarged

line would become 80 feet long (20 extra feet per applica-

tion of the feat), and the dragon would have to wait 1d4+2

rounds before breathing again.

If  a  metabreath  feat  stacks  with  itself,  this  fact  will  be

noted in the Special section of the feat description.

MONSTROUS FEATS

The feats in this category all require a monstrous form or

ability as a prerequisite. Monstrous forms and abilities are

unavailable to normal humanoid or animal creatures, and

can  include  extra  or  nonstandard  appendages  and  super-

natural or spell-like abilities. With the DMs permission, a

player may be able to choose monstrous feats if his or her

character  has  acquired  unusual  abilities  through  transfor-

mation or by advancing in a prestige class. See Savage Species

for more examples of monstrous feats.

FEAT DESCRIPTIONS

Below are descriptions of the feats listed in Table 23: Feats.

ADROIT FLYBY ATTACK [GENERAL]

You  can  make  flyby  attacks  and  get  out  of  reach  quickly.

Prerequisites: Fly  speed  90,  Flyby  Attack,  Hover  or

Wingover.

Benefit: When flying and making an attack action, you

can move both before and after the attack, provided that the

total distance moved is not greater than your fly speed. Your

flying movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity

from the creatures you attack during the round when you

use this feat.

AWAKEN FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE

[MONSTROUS]

You gain frightful presence.

Prerequisites: Cha 11, dragon type.

Benefit:  You  gain  the  frightful  presence  special  ability

with a radius in feet equal to 5  1/2 your racial Hit Dice.

The ability takes effect automatically whenever you attack,

charge,  or  fly  overhead.  Creatures  within  the  radius  are

subject to the effect if they can see you and have fewer Hit

Dice than your racial Hit Dice.

A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will

save  (DC  10  +  1/2  your  racial  HD  +  your  Cha  modifier)

remains immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.

On  a  failure,  creatures  with  4  or  fewer  Hit  Dice  become

panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more Hit Dice

become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the fright-

ful presence of other dragons.

Special: If  you  have  both  this  feat  and  you  have  (or

later  gain)  the  frightful  presence  ability,  your  frightful

presence radius either increases by 50% or increases to 5

feet  1/2 your racial Hit Dice, whichever figure is higher.

The save DC against your frightful presence also increases

by 2.

AWAKEN SPELL RESISTANCE [MONSTROUS]

You gain spell resistance.

Prerequisites: Con 13, dragon type.

Benefit: You gain innate spell resistance equal to your

racial Hit Dice.

Special: If your racial Hit Dice increase after you gain

this  feat,  your  spell  resistance  increases  as  well.  If  you

have this feat and you also have (or later gain) spell resist-

ance as a racial ability, your spell resistance is equal to your

new Hit Dice total or your racial spell resistance +2, which-

ever is higher.

You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you

take the feat, your innate spell resistance increases by 2.

For example, an old silver dragon that has taken this

feat twice has spell resistance 30.

:

Your  breath  weapon  clings  to  creatures

and  continues  to  affect  them  in  the

round after you breathe.

Prerequisites: Con 13, breath weapon.

Benefit: Your breath weapon has its

normal effect, but also clings to

anything caught in its area. A

clinging breath weapon lasts

for  1  round.  In  the  round

after  you  breathe,  the  cling-

ing  breath  weapon  deals

half of the damage it dealt in

the  previous  round.  Creatures

that  avoid  damage  from  the

breath  weapon  (such  as  creatures

with the evasion special quality or

incorporeal creatures) do not take

the extra damage. For example, an

old silver dragon uses its cold breath

and deals 72 points of cold damage

(or  36  points  against  a  target  that

makes  its  save).  In  the  following  round,

foes  that  failed  their  saves  against  the

breath weapon initially take an additional

Expel breath weapon as spread effect

36 points of cold damage, and foes that succeeded on their

saves take 18 points of cold damage.

A foe can take a full-round action to attempt to remove

the  clinging  breath  weapon  before  taking  any  additional

damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (same DC

as your normal breath weapon) to remove the effect. Rolling

around  on  the  ground  grants  a  +2  bonus  on  the  saving

throw, but leaves the foe prone. A clinging breath weapon

cannot be removed or smothered by jumping into water. A

clinging  breath  weapon  can  be  magically  dispelled  (DC

equal to your breath weapon save DC).

This feat only works on a breath weapon that has instan-

taneous duration and that deals some kind of damage, such

as energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), abil-

ity damage, or negative levels.

When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

Special: You  can  apply  this  feat  more  than  once  to  the

same breath weapon. Each time you do, the clinging breath

weapon lasts an additional round.

DEVASTATING CRITICAL [EPIC]

Choose one type of melee weapon, such as a claw or bite.

With that weapon, you are capable of killing any creature

with a single strike.

Prerequisites: Str 25, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved

Critical  (chosen  weapon),  Overwhelming  Critical

(chosen weapon), Power Attack, Weapon Focus (chosen

weapon).

Benefit:  Whenever  you  score  a  critical  hit  with  the

weapon you have chosen, the target must make a Fortitude

save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your character level + your Str

modifier) or die instantly. (Creatures immune to critical hits

cant be affected by this feat.)

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects

do  not  stack.  Each  time  you  take  the  feat,  it  applies  to  a

new weapon.

Benefit: If you charge a foe during the first round of

combat (or the surprise round, if you are allowed to act

in  it),  you  can  make  a  full  attack  against  the  opponent

you charge.

Normal: Without this feat, you may only make a single

attack as part of a charge.

DRACONIC KNOWLEDGE [MONSTROUS]

You are attuned to nature and the elements and can draw on

deep wells of knowledge.

Prerequisites: Int 19, true dragon, any three Knowledge

skills.

Benefit: This feat works much like the bards bardic knowl-

edge class feature, except that it relies on the scale and impact

of past events rather than on how many people already share

the information. You may make a special Draconic Knowledge

check (d20 + your age category + your Int modifier) to see

whether you know some relevant information about an item,

event,  or  locale. This  check  will  not  reveal  the  powers  of  a

magic item but may give a hint about its general function. You

may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of infor-

mation is essentially random. If you have a Knowledge skill

that is related to or applicable to the information you seek,

you receive a +1 bonus on the draconic knowledge check for

every 5 ranks you have in that Knowledge skill.

The DM determines the Difficulty Class of the check by

referring to the table below.

DC Type of Knowledge

10 Something with worldwide Information about the

Examples

or planetwide significance

15 Something with regional

significance, but long-

lasting or with a long-term

places of mystery, or gods.

Information about empires,

wars, regional disasters, or

you  know  how  to  cast  into  your  skin  or  hide  and  use  the

embedded focus anytime you cast the spell. You can embed

a number of focuses equal to your Constitution score.

Special: The total value of expensive spell focuses a dragon

has embedded in its hide should be considered part of the

dragons treasure.

ENDURE BLOWS [MONSTROUS]

You are adept at lessening the effects of blows.

Prerequisites: Con 19, dragon type, Toughness.

Benefit: You  gain  damage  reduction  2/. This  stacks

with  any  damage  reduction  you  have  from  other  sources.

Damage reduction cannot reduce damage below 0.

ENLARGE BREATH [METABREATH]

Your breath weapon is larger than normal.

Prerequisites: Con 13, breath weapon.

Benefit: The length of your breath weapon increases by

50% (round down to the nearest multiple of 5). For example,

an old silver dragon breathing an enlarged cone of cold pro-

duces a 75-foot cone instead of a 50-foot cone. Cone-shaped

breath weapons get wider when they get longer, but line-

shaped breath weapons do not.

When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

EPIC FORTITUDE [EPIC]

You have tremendously high fortitude.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws.

EPIC REFLEXES [EPIC]

You have tremendously fast reflexes.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all Reflex saving throws.

EPIC WILL [EPIC]

You have tremendously strong willpower.

When you use this feat, add +2 to the number of rounds you

must wait before using your breath weapon again.

FAST HEALING [EPIC]

You heal your wounds very quickly.

Prerequisite: Con 25.

Benefit: You gain fast healing 3, or your existing fast heal-

ing  improves  by  3. The  benefit  of  this  feat  does  not  stack

with fast healing granted by magic items or nonpermanent

magical effects.

Special: This feat may be taken multiple times. Its effects

stack.

HEIGHTEN BREATH [METABREATH]

Your breath weapon is even more deadly than normal.

Prerequisites: Con 13, breath weapon.

Benefit: You  can  increase  the  save  DC  of  your  breath

weapon by any number up to a maximum equal to your Con-

stitution bonus.

For each point by which you increase the save DC, add +1

to the number of rounds you must wait before using your

breath weapon again.

IMPROVED MANEUVERABILITY [GENERAL]

Your maneuverability in flight improves.

Prerequisites: Fly  speed  150  feet,  Hover  or  Wingover.

Benefit: Your maneuverability improves by one category,

from clumsy to poor, poor to average, or average to good

(see  Tactical  Aerial  Movement,  page  20  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide).

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time

you take the feat, your maneuverability improves by one cat-

egory (but never becomes better than good).

IMPROVED MULTIATTACK [MONSTROUS]

You are particularly adept at using all your natural weapons

at once.

Prerequisites: Three  or  more  natural  weapons,  Multi-

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on all Will saving throws.

attack.

EXTEND SPREADING BREATH [METABREATH]

You can convert your breath weapon into a spread effect that

can be used at range.

Prerequisites:  Con  15,  breath  weapon,  Shape  Breath,

Spreading Breath, size Small or larger.

Benefit:  You  can  modify  your  breath  weapon  so  that  it

fills a spread centered anywhere within a short distance of

your head. The range and size of the spread depends on your

size, as shown below.

Dragon Size

Small

Medium

Large

Huge

Gargantuan

Colossal

Spread Radius

35 ft.

Spread Range

40 ft.

60 ft.

80 ft.

100 ft.

120 ft.

140 ft.

Benefit:  Your  secondary  attacks  with  natural  weapons

have  no  penalty  on  the  attack  roll.  You  still  add  only  1/2

your Strength bonus, if any, to damage dealt.

Normal: Without  this  feat,  your  secondary  natural

attacks  are  made  at  a  5  penalty  (or  a  2  penalty  if  you

have the Multiattack feat).

IMPROVED RAPIDSTRIKE [MONSTROUS]

You can make multiple attacks with a natural weapon.

Prerequisites: Dex  9,  one  or  more  pairs  of  natural

weapons, aberration, dragon, elemental, magical beast, or

plant type, base attack bonus +15, Rapidstrike.

Benefit: If you have a pair of natural weapons, such as two

claws, two wings, or two slams, you can make two or more

extra  attacks  with  one  of  those  weapons,  the  first  at  a  5

penalty and the second and subsequent attacks at an addi-

tional 5, but never more than four extra attacks. Creatures

with multiple limbs qualify for this feat as well, so a creature

with three arms and three claw attacks qualifies for this feat.

70

Normal: Without  this  feat,  you  attack  once  with  each

natural weapon.

Special: You can take this feat once for each pair of nat-

ural weapons you have. For example, a Large true dragon

has one bite, two claws, two wings, and one tail attacks. The

dragon can take this feat twice, once for its claws and once

for its wings.

IMPROVED SNATCH [GENERAL]

You can make snatch attacks against bigger opponents than

other creatures can.

Prerequisite: Snatch.

Benefit: As the Snatch feat (see page 304 of the Monster

Manual), except that you can grab a creature two size cate-

gories smaller than you with your bite or claw attack.

IMPROVED SPEED [MONSTROUS]

You are faster than others of your kind.

Prerequisites: Str 13, dragon type.

Benefit: Your fly speed (if you have one) improves by 20

feet. All other speeds you have improve by 10 feet.

IMPROVED SPELL CAPACITY [EPIC]

You  can  prepare  spells  that  exceed  the  normal  limits  of

spellcasting.

Prerequisite:  Ability  to  cast  spells  of  the  normal  maxi-

mum spell level in at least one spellcasting class.

Benefit: When you select this feat, you gain one spell slot

per day of any level up to one level higher than the highest

level  spell  you  can  already  cast  in  a  particular  class.  For

example,  if  you  select  this  feat  as  a  21st-level  wizard,  you

would gain one wizard spell slot of any spell level up to 10th.

You must still have the requisite ability score (10 + spell

level) to cast any spell stored in this slot. If you have a high

enough ability modifier to gain one or more bonus spells

for this spell level, you also gain the bonus spells for this

spell level.

You  must  use  the  spell  slot  as  a  member  of  the  class  in

which you can already cast spells of the normal maximum

spell level. For instance, a 5th-level ranger/22nd-level sor-

cerer couldnt add a ranger spell slot, because he cant cast

spells  of  the  normal  maximum  spell  level  for  rangers.  He

must add the spell slot to his sorcerer spells.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.

LARGE AND IN CHARGE [GENERAL]

You can prevent opponents from closing inside your reach.

Prerequisites: Natural  reach  of  10  feet  or  more,  size

Large or larger.

Benefit: When you make a successful attack of opportu-

nity against an opponent that is moving inside your threat-

ened  area,  you  can  force  the  opponent  back  to  the  5-foot

space it was in before it provoked the attack of opportunity.

After  you  hit  with  your  attack  of  opportunity,  make  an

opposed Strength check against your opponent. You gain a

+4 bonus for each size category larger than your opponent

you  are,  and  an  additional  +1  bonus  for  every  5  points  of

damage  you  dealt  with  your  attack  of  opportunity.  If  you

win the opposed check, your opponent is pushed back 5 feet

into  the  space  it  just  left.  An  opponent  you  push  cannot

move any farther in this round.

LINGERING BREATH [METABREATH]

Your breath weapon forms a lingering cloud.

Prerequisites: Con 15, breath weapon, Clinging Breath.

Benefit: Your breath weapon has its normal effects, but

also remains as a lingering cloud of the same shape and size

as  the  original  breath  weapon.  This  cloud  lasts  1  round.

Foes caught in the breath weapons area when you breathe

take  no  additional  damage  from  the  lingering  breath

weapon, provided they leave the cloud by the shortest avail-

able  route  on  their  next  turn.  Otherwise,  anyone  who

touches or enters the cloud while it lasts takes one-half of

the  breath  weapons  normal  effects;  any  saving  throw  the

breath  weapon  normally  allows  still  applies.  Damaging

breath  weapons  deal  one-half  their  normal  damage,  and

breath weapons with effects that have durations last for half

the normal time. If a creature is affected by the same non-

damaging  breath  weapon  twice,  the  effects  do  not  stack.

For  example,  an  old  silver  dragon  uses  this  feat  on  its

cold breath weapon. Creatures caught in the 50-foot cone

take 16d8 points of cold damage, and a DC 31 Reflex save

reduces the damage by half. The 50-foot cone lingers for 1

round. While the cone lasts, anyone touching or entering

it  takes  8d8  points  of  cold  damage,  and  a  DC  31  Reflex

save reduces the cold damage to 4d8 points. Creatures in

the  cone  when  the  dragon  breathed  take  no  additional

damage  if  they  leave  by  the  shortest  available  route  on

their next turn.

If the same dragon uses this feat on its paralyzing breath

weapon, a creature caught in the 50-foot cone must make a

DC 31 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6+8 rounds. The

50-foot  cone  lingers  for  1  round.  While  the  cone  lasts,

anyone touching or entering it must make a DC 31 Forti-

tude save or be paralyzed for 1d3+4 rounds. Creatures in the

cone when the dragon breathed take no additional damage

if  they  leave  by  the  shortest  available  route  on  their  next

turn. Creatures paralyzed by the initial breath cannot leave

the cloud, but suffer no additional effects because the para-

lyzing effects do not stack.

When you use this feat, add +2 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

Special: You  can  apply  this  feat  more  than  once  to  the

same breath weapon. Each time you do, the lingering breath

lasts an additional round.

You can apply this feat to a breath weapon that also has

received the Clinging Breath feat, but the resulting breath

clings only to foes caught in the initial breath.

MAXIMIZE BREATH [METABREATH]

You can take a full-round action to use your breath weapon

to maximum effect.

Prerequisites: Con 17, breath weapon.

Benefit: If  you  use  your  breath  weapon  as  a  full-round

action,  all  variable,  numeric  effects  of  the  attack  are  maxi-

mized. A maximized breath weapon deals maximum damage,

lasts for the maximum time, or the like. For example, an old

silver  dragon  using  a  maximized  cold  breath

weapon  (damage  16d8)  deals  128  points  of

damage. An old silver dragon using a maximized

paralysis  gas  breath  weapon  (duration  1d6+8

rounds) paralyzes creatures for 14 rounds if they

fail their saving throws.

The  DCs  for  saving  throws  against

your breath weapon are not affected.

When  you  use  this  feat,  add  +3  to  the

number  of  rounds  you  must  wait  before

using your breath weapon again.

This feat stacks with the effects of breath

weapons enhanced with other meta-

breath feats, but does not maximize

them.  For  example,  a  maximized

breath  weapon  further  enhanced  by

the Tempest  Breath  feat  produces  the

type  of  wind  effect  noted  in  that

feat  description,  but  the  velocity

of  the  wind  is  not  also  maximized.

Special: You cannot use this feat and

the  Quicken  Breath  feat  on  the  same

breath weapon at the same time.

MULTISNATCH [GENERAL]

You  can  grapple  enemies  more  firmly

with  only  one  of  your  natural  attacks.

Prerequisites: Str 17, Snatch.

Benefit: When  grappling  an  oppo-

nent  with  only  the  part  of  your  body

that made the attack, you take only a 10

penalty on grapple checks to maintain

the hold.

Normal: Without this feat, you take

a  20  penalty  on  grapple  checks  to

maintain a hold with only one part of

your body.

OVERCOME WEAKNESS

[MONSTROUS]

You  can  overcome  an  innate  vulnerability

through sheer willpower.

Prerequisites: Vulnerabil-

ity to energy, Iron Will, Sup-

press Weakness.

Benefit: You  can

completely  suppress

your vulnerability to

a  type  of  energy.

When  subjected  to

an  attack  based  on

that type of energy,

you  take  no  extra

damage.

Normal: A  crea-

ture vulnerable to a

type of energy takes

Dive knocks Lidda off her feet.

half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from that en-

ergy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed,

or if the save is a success or failure.

OVERWHELMING

CRITICAL [EPIC]

Choose one type of melee weapon, such

as  claw  or  bite.  With  that  weapon,  you

deal more damage on a critical hit.

Prerequisites: Str  23,  Cleave,  Great

Cleave,  Improved  Critical  (chosen

weapon),  Power  Attack,  Weapon

Focus  (chosen  weapon).

Benefit: When using the

weapon  you  have  selected,  you

deal +1d6 points of extra damage

on a successful critical hit. If the

weapons critical multiplier is 3,

add +2d6 points of extra damage

instead, and if the multiplier

is 4, add +3d6 points of

extra  damage  instead.

(Creatures  immune  to

critical hits cant be affected by this feat.)

Special: You can gain this feat mul-

tiple  times.  Its  effects  do  not  stack.

Each time you take the feat, it applies

to a new weapon.

POWER CLIMB [GENERAL]

If you fly in a straight line, you can gain alti-

tude in flight more easily than others.

Prerequisites: Str  15,  fly  speed  (average

maneuverability).

Benefit: When flying, you can gain altitude

and still move your full speed provided you fly

in a straight line.

Normal: Without this feat, you must move

at half speed to gain altitude (see Tactical Aerial

Movement, page 20 of the Dungeon Masters Guide).

POWER DIVE [GENERAL]

You can fall upon an opponent from the sky.

Prerequisites: Str  15,  fly  speed  (average

maneuverability).

Benefit: When  flying,  you  can  dive  and

land  on  an  opponent  to  deal  extra  damage.

This is a standard action that can only affect

creatures that are smaller than you. You make

an overrun attack, but the opponent cannot

choose  to  avoid  you.  If  you  knock  down

the  target,  you  may  make  an  additional

slam attack, dealing the indicated dam-

age plus 1-1/2 times your Strength

bonus (round down). This at-

tack is at the usual +4

bonus  against  prone

opponents.

natural weapon and do not have a chance to knock down

the opponent.

Special: If you fail in the overrun attempt and are tripped

in  turn,  you  are  instead  knocked  down  and  deal  the  indi-

cated slam damage to yourself.

QUICKEN BREATH [METABREATH]

You can loose your breath weapon with but a thought.

Prerequisites: Con 19, breath weapon.

Benefit: Using your breath weapon is a free action.

When you use this feat, add +4 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

Special: You cannot use this feat and the Maximize Breath

feat on the same weapon at the same time.

RAPIDSTRIKE [MONSTROUS]

You can attack more than once with a natural weapon.

Prerequisites: Dex  9,  one  or  more  pairs  of  natural

weapons, aberration, dragon, elemental, magical beast, or

plant type, base attack bonus +10.

Benefit: If  you  have  a  pair  of  natural  weapons,  such  as

two claws, two wings, or two slams, you can make one extra

attack with one of those weapons at a 5 penalty. A creature

with multiple limbs qualifies for this feat as well, such as a

creature with three arms and three claw attacks.

Normal: Without this feat, you attack once with each nat-

ural weapon.

Special: You can take this feat once for each pair of nat-

ural weapons you have. For example, a Large dragon has

one bite, two claws, two wings, and one tail attacks. The

dragon can take this feat twice, once for its claws and once

for its wings.

RECOVER BREATH [METABREATH]

You  wait  less  time  before  being  able  to  use  your  breath

weapon again.

Prerequisites: Con 17, breath weapon.

Benefit: You reduce the interval between uses of your

breath  weapon.  You  wait  1  round  less  than  usual  before

breathing  again,  but  always  at  least  1  round.  The  feat

stacks with the effects of metabreath feats, reducing the

total time you must wait to use your breath weapon again

by 1 round.

Special: If you have multiple heads with breath weapons,

all breath weapons use the reduced interval.

REND [MONSTROUS]

You can rend opponents you hit with your claws.

Prerequisites: Two  claw  attacks,  Str  13,  Power  Attack,

Snatch, size Huge or larger.

Benefit: If you strike the same opponent with two claw

attacks, you automatically deal extra damage equal to that

of two claw attacks plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus.

You cannot grab an opponent at the same time you rend

that opponent.

SHAPE BREATH [METABREATH]

You can make the area of your breath weapon a cone or a

line, as you see fit.

Prerequisites: Con 13, breath weapon, size Small or larger.

Benefit:  If  you  have  a  line-shaped  breath  weapon,  you

can opt to shape it into a cone. Likewise, if you have a cone-

shaped breath weapon, you can shape it into a line.

When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

Normal: Without  this  feat,  the  shape  of  your  breath

weapon is fixed.

SHOCK WAVE [MONSTROUS]

You can strike the ground with your tail so hard it knocks

other creatures down.

Prerequisites: Str 13, dragon, size Large or larger, Power

Attack.

Benefit: You  may,  as  a  full-round  action,  strike  a  solid

surface with your tail and create a shock wave that radiates

out  from  your  space  and  continues  for  a  number  of  feet

equal to 5  your racial Hit Dice. Make a bull rush attack by

rolling  once  regardless  of  how  many  creatures  are  in  the

radius. Every creature in the radius makes a Strength check

and compares it to your roll. Those who fail their opposed

checks are knocked down.

Special: Structures and unattended objects at least par-

tially  within  the  shock  wave  take  damage  equal  to  1d6  +

your Strength bonus.

SNATCH AND SWALLOW [MONSTROUS]

You  can  swallow  creatures  you  have  grabbed  with  your

bite attack.

Prerequisites: Con 19, dragon, Snatch, Improved Snatch,

size Huge or larger.

Benefit: If you begin your turn with an opponent held

in your mouth, you can attempt a new grapple check (as

though  attempting  to  pin  the  opponent).  If  you  succeed,

your opponent takes bite damage and is swallowed.

A swallowed creature is considered grappled, while you

are  not.  A  swallowed  creature  can  try  to  cut  its  way  free

with any light piercing or slashing weapon (the amount of

damage required to get free is noted on the table below), or

it can just try to escape the grapple. If the swallowed crea-

ture chooses the latter course, success puts it back in your

mouth. Any damage a swallowed creature deals is deducted

from your hit points. If a creature cuts itself free, muscular

action  closes  the  hole,  so  that  if  you  swallow  someone

again, that creature must cut itself free again. Swallowed

creatures  take  damage  in  each  round  they  remain  swal-

lowed, as shown below.

3 A swallowed foe takes energy damage in each round it

spends in your stomach. The type of energy is the same as

that of your breath weapon.

SPELLCASTING HARRIER [EPIC]

Spellcasters you threaten find it difficult to cast defensively.

Prerequisite: Combat Reflexes.

Benefit: Any spellcaster you threaten in melee provokes

an attack of opportunity if he or she tries to cast defensively.

You get a +4 bonus on this attack roll.

SPREADING BREATH [METABREATH]

You  can  convert  your  breath  weapon  into  a  spread  effect.

Prerequisites:  Con  15,  breath  weapon,  Shape  Breath,

size Small or larger.

Benefit:  You  can  modify  your  breath  weapon  so  that  it

fills  a  spread  centered  on  your  head  instead  of  taking  its

normal  shape.  The  radius  of  the  spread  depends  on  your

size, as shown below.

must wait before using your breath weapon again.

SPLIT BREATH [METABREATH]

You  can  split  your  breath  weapon  into  a  pair  of  weaker

effects.

Prerequisites: Con  13,  breath  weapon,  Shape  Breath,

size Small or larger.

Benefit: Your breath weapon retains its size and shape,

but splits into two areas that you aim separately. Each por-

tion  deals  half  the  damage  the  breath  weapon  normally

deals or lasts half as long as the effect normally lasts.

For example, an old silver dragon that uses this feat on its

cold breath weapon produces two 50-foot cones of cold that

deal  8d8  points  of  cold  damage  each.  If  the  same  dragon

used this feat on its paralyzing gas breath weapon, it would

produce  two  cones  of  gas,  each  of  which  could  paralyze  a

creature for 1d3+4 rounds.

You  can  aim  the  split  breath  effects  so  that  their  areas

overlap. Creatures caught in the area of overlap are struck

by both weapons and are affected twice, subject to all the

normal rules for stacking magical effects.

When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

SUPPRESS WEAKNESS [MONSTROUS]

Your vulnerability to an energy type is reduced.

Prerequisites: Vulnerability to energy, Iron Will.

Benefit: You can partially suppress your vulnerability to

a  type  of  element  or  energy. When  subjected  to  an  attack

based on that type of energy, you take one-quarter again as

much (+25%) damage, regardless of whether a saving throw

is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.

Normal: A creature vulnerable to an element or energy

type takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from

that energy type.

TAIL CONSTRICT [MONSTROUS]

You can make constriction attacks with your tail.

Prerequisites: Dragon, Snatch, Improved Snatch.

Benefit: You can grab and constrict creatures you hit with

your tail slap attack. This works just like a snatch attack, except

that  it  can  be  used  against  any  creature  smaller  than  you.

If you successfully grab an opponent with your tail, you

deal  bludgeoning  damage  equal  to  your  tail  slap  damage

plus  1-1/2  times  your  Strength  modifier.  Each  round  you

hold your opponent, you deal constriction damage.

You cannot make tail slap or tail sweep attacks while con-

stricting an opponent with your tail.

TAIL SWEEP KNOCKDOWN [MONSTROUS]

Your tail sweep attack knocks opponents prone.

Prerequisite: Tail sweep attack.

Benefit: Creatures  who  fail  their  saving  throws  against

your  tail  sweep  attack  are  knocked  prone  in  addition  to

taking full damage.

TEMPEST BREATH [METABREATH]

You can make your breath weapon strike with the force of a

windstorm.

Prerequisites: Str  13,  breath  weapon,  Power  Attack,

size Large or larger.

Benefit: When  you  use  your  breath  weapon,  in  addi-

tion to its normal effects, creatures in the area are affected

as through struck by wind effects. The force of the wind

depends on your size, as indicated below. For the effects of

high  winds,  see  Table  324  on  page  95  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide.

(in which case they are blown back 1d65 feet).

you must wait before using your breath weapon again.

WHIRLWIND TAIL SWEEP [MONSTROUS]

You can sweep your tail in a circular arc.

Prerequisite: Tail sweep attack.

Benefit: Your  tail  sweep  attack  affects  a  circle  with  a

radius equal to your tail slaps reach.

Normal: Your tail sweep attack affects a semicircle.

WINGSTORM [MONSTROUS]

You can flatten targets with blasts of air from your wings.

Prerequisites: Str 13, dragon, fly speed 20, Hover, Power

Attack, size Large or larger.

Benefit: As  a  full-round  action,  you  can  hover  in  place

and use your wings to create a blast of air in a cylinder with

a radius and height of 10 feet times your age category.

The wind blows from the center of your body toward the

outside edge at the bottom of the cylinder.

The force of the wind depends on your size, as indicated

below. For the effects of high winds, see Table 324 on page

95 of the Dungeon Masters Guide.

Dragon Size

Because  the  blast  of  air  only  lasts  for  your  turn,  creatures

ignore the checked effect unless they are airborne (in which

case they are blown back 1d65 feet).

Special:  You  can  elect  to  keep  the  wind  in  effect  for

longer  than  your  current  turn.  If  you  do,  the  wind  lasts

until  your  next  turn  (and  you  can  opt  to  continue  the

effect during your next turn). Anyone in or entering the

cylinder is affected. Because you are producing a continu-

ous blast of air, the checked effect works normally while

the  wind  lasts  (checked  creatures  cannot  move  forward

against  the  force  of  the  wind,  or  they  are  blown  back

1d65 feet if airborne).

DRAGON SPELLS

Over  the  millennia,  dragons  have  developed  a  number  of

spells  that  take  their  special  abilities  and  qualities  into

account. Despite the origin of these spells, any spellcaster

can  learn  and  use  them  if  he  or  she  is  capable  of  casting

spells of the indicated class and level.

METABREATH SPELLS

Similar  to  the  metabreath  feats  described  in  the  previous

section,  a  large  number  of  spells  in  this  section  alter  a

dragons breath weapon. While metabreath feats allow mun-

dane  manipulation  of  a  breath  weapons  shape  or  power,

metabreath  spells  represent  significant  magical  enhance-

ment of the breath weapon. A metabreath spell has a special

breath (B) component listed in the spell description. Using

the  breath  weapon  is  a  part  of  casting  the  spell,  just  like

making  a  touch  attack  is  a  part  of  casting  a  touch  spell.

Unlike touch spells, a dragon cannot hold the charge on a

metabreath spell; it must breathe as part of the spellcasting.

Casting a metabreath spell counts as a normal use of a breath

weapon,  and  the  dragon  must  wait  the  normal  length  of

time before using it again.

A spellcaster must have a breath weapon to cast a spell with

a  breath  component.  Some  metabreath  spells  apply  only  to

breath weapons with a damaging, energy-based effectso a

dragon turtles scalding breath (which deals damage with

no  energy  descriptor)  or  a  gorgons  petrifying  breath, for

example, could not be animated with animate breath. Either

could  be  enhanced  with  fire  damage  using  breath  weapon

admixture or  replaced  with  electricity  damage  using  breath

weapon substitution. A character under the effect of an elixir of

fire breath can use metabreath spells normally.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONS

The spells herein are presented in alphabetical order.

Animate Breath

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

You imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coher-

ence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The animated breath

then attacks whomever or whatever you designate. The spell

works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold,

electricity, fire, or sonic) damage. The animated breath has

the following characteristics.

Type: Construct.

Subtype: The same as yours, or the energy type of your

breath weapon if you do not have a subtype.

Size: One size smaller than you.

Hit  Dice: Equal  to  the  number  of  dice  of  damage  your

breath weapon deals. The Hit Dice are 10-sided. Constructs

also receive bonus hit points based on size:

Diminutive, Tiny: 

Small: 10

Medium: 20

Large: 30

Huge: 40

Gargantuan: 60

Colossal: 80

76

Damage: Each successful hit deals bludgeoning damage

(varies  by  size  of  the  animated  breath;  see  below)  plus

energy damage equal to one die of the same size as your

breath weapon damage.

Diminutive: 1d2

Tiny: 1d3

Small: 1d4

Medium: 1d6

Large: 1d8

Huge: 2d6

Gargantuan: 2d8

For example, a Colossal red dragons animated breath is

Gargantuan  in  size,  so  it  deals  2d8  points  of  bludgeoning

damage  on  a  successful  hitplus  1d10  points  of  fire

damage, because d10 is the size of die used to determine a

red dragons breath weapon damage.

Special Qualities: Creatures that hit the animated breath

with  natural  weapons  or  unarmed  attacks  take  energy

damage as though hit by the breaths attack.

Construct Traits: The animated breath is immune to mind-

affecting effects, and to poison, magic sleep effects, paraly-

sis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects, and

any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works

on  objects. The  breath  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  non-

lethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, or

death from massive damage.

Saves: The animated breath has no good saves. All of its

save bonuses are 1/3 of its Hit Dice plus the appropriate abil-

ity modifier.

Abilities: The  animated  breath  has  no  Constitution  or

Intelligence  score.  Its  Wisdom  and  Charisma  scores  are

both 1. Its Strength and Dexterity vary by size:

Diminutive: Str 6, Dex 16

Tiny: Str 8, Dex 14

Small: Str 10, Dex 12

Medium: Str 12, Dex 10

Large: Str 16, Dex 10

Huge: Str 20, Dex 8

Gargantuan: Str 24, Dex 6

Alignment: Always neutral.

An old brass dragons animated breath has the following

statistics:

Large construct (fire); HD 8d10+30; hp 74; Init +0; Spd 50

ft.; AC 13, touch 9, flat-footed 13; Atk +9/+4 (1d8+1d6 fire,

or  become  shakena  condition  that  lasts  until  the  oppo-

nent is out of range. A successful save leaves that opponent

immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.

If you cast this spell when you already have the frightful

presence ability or a fear aura, the existing ability becomes

more effective in the following ways:

An old red dragons animated breath has the following

The radius of the area affected by the ability increases

statistics:

by 10 feet.

Huge construct (fire); HD 16d10+40; hp 128; Init 1; Spd 50

ft.; AC 15, touch 9, flat-footed 15; Atk +15/+10/+5 (2d6+1d10

fire, slam); SQ burn, construct traits; AL N; SV Fort +5, Ref +4,

Will +0; Str 20, Dex 8, Con , Int , Wis 1, Cha 1.

Casting  the  spell  requires  a  standard  action,  which

includes  using  your  breath  weapon.  When  you  use  your

breath  weapon,  it  immediately  takes  animate  form  and

attacks. It does not form as a cone or a line, and does not

deal damage when it is used to cast this spell.

The Will saving throw to resist the fear effect has a DC

equal  to  your  normal  frightful  presence  DC  or  this  spells

save DC, whichever is higher.

Creatures that would normally be shaken by your fear

aura are frightened instead, and creatures that would nor-

mally be frightened are panicked.

ciated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, or

fire. You can modify your breath weapon to add an equal

amount  of  the  energy  you  choose.  For  example,  a  wyrm

red  dragon  whose  breath  weapon  normally  deals  22d10

points  of  fire  damage  could  use  this  spell  to  produce  a

cone  dealing  22d10  points  of  fire  damage  plus  22d10

points of acid damage. Even opposed types of energy, such

as  fire  and  cold,  can  be  combined  using  this  spell.  The

modification applies only to the breath produced as part

of the casting.

When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity,

or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, breath

weapon admixture is an acid spell when you cast it to add acid

damage to your breath weapon.

Breath Weapon Substitution

Transmutation (see text)

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

Duration: Instantaneous

Choose one type of energy other than that normally associ-

ated with your breath weapon: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

You  can  modify  your  breath  weapon  to  use  the  selected

energy type instead of its normal energy type. For example,

a mature adult red dragon whose breath weapon normally

deals 14d10 points of fire damage could use this spell to pro-

duce  a  cone  dealing  14d10  points  of  acid  damage  instead.

The modification applies only to the breath produced as part

of the casting.

When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electric-

ity,  or  fire  energy,  it  is  a  spell  of  that  type.  For  example,

breath weapon substitution is an acid spell when you cast it

to change your breath weapon to deal acid damage.

Burning Blood

Transmutation [see text]

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level

Your blood becomes suffused with the same energy type

that powers your breath weapon. (You must have a breath

weapon  that  deals  acid,  cold,  electricity,  or  fire  damage  to

cast this spell.) Whenever you take damage from a natural or

manufactured weapon, a spurt of blood erupts in a 5-foot-

radius  burst  from  the  wound,  dealing  energy  damage  to

creatures  in  its  area.  The  energy-charged  blood  deals  a

number of points of damage equal to your caster level.

When you use this spell to produce acid, cold, electricity,

or fire energy, it is a spell of that type. For example, burning

blood is an acid spell when you cast it to suffuse your blood

with acid.

Deafening Breath

Transmutation [Sonic]

Level: Sor/Wiz 9

As breath weapon admixture, but you add sonic energy to your

breath weapon. In addition to dealing extra damage, you

permanently deafen creatures that fail their saving throws

against your breath.

This spell has no effect within an area of magical silence,

such as that created by the silence spell.

Dispelling Breath

Abjuration

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

Duration: Instantaneous

Your breath weapon acts as a targeted dispel magic, possibly

dispelling magical effects affecting creatures caught in its

area. The modification applies only to the breath produced

as part of the casting.

For  each  creature  or  object  that  fails  its  saving  throw

against your breath weapon and that is the target of one or

more spells, you make a dispel check against each ongoing

spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel

check is 1d20 + 1 per caster level (maximum +15) against a

DC of 11 + the spells caster level. A creatures magic items

are not affected, and creatures and objects that rolled suc-

cessful saving throws against your breath weapon are like-

wise not affected.

If a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as

a monster summoned by monster summoning), is in the area

and fails its saving throw against your breath weapon, you

can also make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured

the creature (returning it whence it came).

For  each  ongoing  area  or  effect  spell  centered  within

the area of your breath weapon, you make a dispel check

to dispel the spell.

You  may  choose  to  automatically  succeed  on  dispel

checks against any spell that you have cast.

Ethereal Breath

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

Duration: Instantaneous

Draconic Polymorph

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

As polymorph, except  as  follows:  The  assumed  form  can

have no more Hit Dice than you have, to a maximum of 20

Hit Dice. Your Strength and Constitution in the new form

are  above  the  average  for  the  race  or  species  into  which

you transform; your Strength is the average for the crea-

ture +8, and your Constitution is the average for the crea-

ture +2.

Enervating Breath

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

Duration: Instantaneous

You can modify your breath weapon so that it is laced with

negative energy. In addition to the normal energy damage

your  breath  weapon  deals,  creatures  that  fail  their  saving

throws against the breath weapon gain 2d4 negative levels.

The modification applies only to the breath produced as part

of the casting.

If the subject gains at least as many negative levels as it

has Hit Dice, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature the

following  penalties:  1  penalty  on  attack  rolls,  saving

throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for

determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of

spells  or  special  abilities).  Additionally,  a  spellcaster  loses

one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Neg-

ative levels stack.

Assuming  the  subjects  survive,  they  regain  lost  levels

after a number of hours equal to your caster level. Ordinar-

ily, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining

the  subjects  level,  but  the  negative  levels  from  enervating

breath dont last long enough to do so.

If an undead creature is caught within the breath weapon,

it gains 2d45 temporary hit points before taking damage

from the breath weapon. If not immediately lost, these tem-

porary hit points last for 1 hour.

You  can  modify  your  breath  weapon  to  manifest  on  the

Ethereal Plane instead of on the Material Plane. (You must

be on the Material Plane, or on another plane with a coex-

istent  Ethereal  Plane,  for  this  spell  to  function.)  Your

breath  weapon  affects  ethereal  creatures  as  if  they  were

material, and does not affect material creatures in its area.

The  modification  applies  only  to  the  breath  produced  as

part of the casting.

Hiss of Sleep

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One creature/level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: No

Hissing and whispering softly, you lull the targets into a

comatose  slumber.  Sleeping  creatures  are  helpless.  Slap-

ping or wounding awakens affected creatures, but normal

noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action

(an application of the aid another action).

Hiss  of  sleep has  no  effect  on  creatures  that  can  see  you,

creatures that have already rolled saving throws against your

frightful presence, or unconscious creatures.

Imperious Glare

Necromancy [Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 6

Components: S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One living creature/level, no two of which may

be more than 30 ft. apart

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (see text)

Spell Resistance: Yes

Directing your gaze toward the target creatures, you instill

terror and awe in their hearts. The targets must make suc-

cessful Will saves or cower.

The  saving  throw  DC  to  resist  this  effect  is  either  the

normal save DC for the spell or the save DC for your natural

frightful presence ability, whichever is higher. You cannot

cast this spell if you do not have a frightful presence ability,

either natural or magically bestowed.

Maddening Whispers

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Sor/Wiz 8

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Targets: One creature/level

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

Directing your gaze toward the target creatures, you cause

them to stop and stare blankly at you, mesmerized. Crea-

tures that fail their saving throws gaze at your eyes, heedless

of all else. Affected creatures are dazed. Any potential threat

(such  as  an  armed  opponent  moving  behind  the  mesmer-

ized creature) allows the creature a new saving throw. Any

obvious threat, such as casting a spell, drawing a sword, or

aiming  an  arrow,  automatically  breaks  the  effect,  as  does

shaking or slapping the creature. A mesmerized creatures

ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.

Hissing and whispering softly, you stir feelings of confusion

and madness in the targets minds. You can choose to inflict

one of the following conditions upon any creatures that fail

their saving throws.

Hysteria: The subjects fall into fits of uncontrollable laugh-

ing or crying (equal chance for either). Hysterical creatures

are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do

anything  else  requiring  attention. The  only  action  such  a

character can take is a single move action per turn.

Panic: The subjects become panicked. If cornered, a pan-

icked creature cowers.

Violent  Hallucinations: The  subjects  perceive  any  nearby

creatures as dangerous enemies, attacking the nearest ones

and  fighting  until  the  subjects  are  slain  or  until  no  more

creatures are in sight.

Stupor: The subjects curl up on the floor and remain obliv-

ious to events around them. Characters in a stupor are effec-

tively stunned and prone.

Maddening whispers has no effect upon creatures that can see

you, creatures that have already rolled saving throws against

your frightful presence, or unconscious creatures.

Magic Fang, Superior

Transmutation

Level: Drd 5, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Superior magic fang gives every natural weapon you possess

an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls equal to

+1 per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level).

Razorfangs

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 2

Components: V

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Choose one of your natural weapons that deals slashing or

piercing  damage  (your  bite  or  a  single  claw). That  natural

weapons  threat  range  doubles  (in  most  cases,  becoming

1920). This spell does not stack with any other effects that

increase a weapons threat range.

This  spells  name  derives  from  a  marked  preference

among  dragons  for  improving  their  bite  attack  with  this

spell, but it works equally well on a claw attack.

Rebuking Breath

Necromancy

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

Duration: Instantaneous

You imbue your breath weapon with negative energy that

rebukes undead in its area. Undead within the area of your

breath  weapon  that  fail  their  saving  throws  against  it  are

rebuked, and cower as if in awe for 10 rounds. The modifica-

tion applies only to the breath produced as part of the casting.

Scintillating Scales

Transmutation

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 round/level

Choose  one  of  your  natural  weapons  (your  bite,  a  single

claw, a wing, a crush, a tail slap, or a tail sweep). For the dura-

tion  of  the  spell,  that  natural  weapon  deals  damage  as

though you were one size larger than your actual size. You

cannot gain additional attack forms (such as a tail slap) by

using this spell; you can only improve attacks you already

possess. This spell does not stack with itself.

This  spells  name  derives  from  a  marked  preference

among dragons for improving their bite attacks with this

spell,  but  it  works  equally  well  on  claw,  wing,  tail,  and

crush attacks.

Stunning Breath

Level: Sor/Wiz 4

Components: S, B

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: Your breath weapon

You imbue your damaging breath weapon with concussive

force that can stun those caught in its area. Creatures that

or be stunned for 1 round. The modification applies only to

An amulet of supremacy bestows two negative levels on any

nondragon that dares to put it on. In addition, when a non-

resize  to  fit  any  dragon  of  Large  size  or  bigger.  A  dragon

wearing claws of the ripper cannot also make use of a magic

ring on that claw. When worn, claws of the ripper increase the

damage dealt by the dragons claws on a critical hit, giving

them a 4 multiplier (like that of a scythe).

armor  bonus,  the  armor  is  fitted  with  spikes  and  blades

designed to enhance the dragons attacks, granting a +5 en-

A web of force surrounds the target, entangling it like a net.

If the target fails its saving throw, it is entangled. Perhaps

most  important,  the  creature  cannot  use  wings  to  fly

hence  the  common  name  of  this  spell.  A  creature  flying

with wings falls immediately if it is entangled by wingbind.

An  entangled  creature  can  escape  with  a  successful

Escape  Artist  check  against  a  DC  equal  to  the  saving

throw DC of the spell. Like a wall of force, the web of force

is impervious to most attacks: It is immune to damage of

all  kinds,  cannot  be  burst  with  a  Strength  check,  and  is

unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. Also like

wall of force, the web is immediately destroyed by disinte-

grate, a rod  of  cancellation, a sphere  of  annihilation, or Mor-

denkainens disjunction.

DRAGON MAGIC ITEMS

This section describes magic items made particularly for

use by dragons. Many of them can be used by other crea-

tures as well.

Amulet  of  Supremacy  (Minor  Artifact): This  stun-

ning piece of jewelry is virtually priceless based simply on

its artistic quality and the value of precious metal and gem-

stones it contains, but its magical abilities are even more

valuable to a dragon. When worn by a dragon, an amulet of

supremacy confers the benefits of the Maximize Breath feat

on the dragons breath weapon, and applies the effects of

the Maximize Spell feat to the dragons spells and spell-like

abilities. These benefits come at no cost to the dragon: It

need  not  wait  extra  rounds  between  uses  of  its  breath

82

available  only  to  characters  who  have  at  least  28  ranks  in

both Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft], superior magic fang;

sal);Weight 50 lb. (Medium), 100 lb. (Large), 250 lb. (Huge),

500 lb. (Gargantuan), 1,000 lb. (Colossal).

Draught  of  Metabreath  Magic: These  draughts  are

thick liquids, similar to potions, that bestow magical effects

on a creature drinking them. The magical effects duplicate

the metabreath spells described in the previous section, but

the  drinker  must  supply  the  breath  component  for  the

effect to take place. Drinking a draught is a standard action,

and activates the magic of the draught for just over 1 round.

After  drinking,  the  drinker  must  use  its  breath  weapon

before the end of the next round. This use of the drinkers

breath  weapon  is  enhanced  as  if  the  drinker  had  cast  the

appropriate metabreath spell on itself.

Draughts of metabreath magic come in a number of different

varieties, whose caster level and market price are listed on

the table below.

Draught of Metallic Dragon Breath: A special variety

of draughts of metabreath magic, this liquid comes in five vari-

eties, corresponding to the five kinds of metallic dragons,

and their color is the same: brass, bronze, copper, gold, and

silver. When  drunk,  this  draught  alters  the  drinkers  next

use of its breath weapon, as long as that use occurs before

the  end  of  the  next  round. The  breath  weapon  works  just

like the nondamaging effects of a metallic dragon. A brass

draught  creates  a  cone  of  sleep, a  bronze  draught  creates  a

cone of repulsion gas, a copper draught creates a cone of slow

gas, a gold draught creates a cone of weakening gas, and a

silver draught creates a cone of paralyzing gas. The saving

throw against the metallic breath weapon has the same DC

as the drinkers natural breath weapon, and the effects are

the same as if the drinker used the breath weapon normally.

For example, an old red dragon that drank a gold draught of

metallic dragon breath could breathe a cone of weakening gas

that deals 8 points of Strength damage.

A  character  under  the  effects  of  a  potion  of  fire  breath or

similar  effect  can  use  a  draught  of  metallic  dragon  breath to

alter the fiery blasts from that potion, using the caster level

of the effect (3rd, in the case of a potion of fire breath) as the

effective  age  category.  A  creature  with  no  breath  weapon

ability is unaffected by drinking the draught.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item,

breath  weapon  substitution, and  one  of  the  following:  sleep,

repulsion, slow, ray of enfeeblement, or hold person; Price 2,100

gp; Weight 1/2 lb.

Gemstone  of  Fortification: This  large,  faceted  stone

must  be  embedded  in  a  creatures  hide  to  function.  True

dragons can accomplish this with ease, since they routinely

embed gems in among the scales of their bellies. Other crea-

tures have a more difficult time of it, requiring at least a lim-

ited wish, at the DMs discretion.

When properly embedded, a gemstone of fortification pro-

tects  the  wearers  vital  areas  from  lethal  damage.  When  a

critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a

chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and

damage is instead rolled normally. A gemstone of light forti-

fication has a 25% chance to negate a critical hit or sneak

attack, a gemstone of moderate fortification has a 75% chance,

and a gemstone of heavy fortification has a 100% chance.

Strong universal or evocation; CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms

and Armor, Craft Wondrous Item, limited wish or miracle; Price

3,000  gp  (light),  15,000  gp  (moderate),  35,000  gp  (heavy).

Gorget of Tempest Breath: This metal collar bestows the

benefit of the Tempest Breath feat upon its wearer. A creature

wearing the gorget cannot also make use of a magic robe.

Strong (no school); CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, Tem-

pest Breath; Price 10,000 gp; Weight 10 lb.

Jaws of the Dragon: This complex metal device is worn

in the mouth, fitting over the teeth while allowing them to

protrude.  A  row  of  metal  teeth  is  set  into  the  jaws  of  the

dragon behind where the dragons teeth emerge, increasing

the damage dealt by the dragons bite. The dragon gains the

benefit of the sharptooth spell while the jaws are worn. The

device resizes to fit any creature as normal for a magic item,

but  creatures  with  no  natural  bite  attack  gain  no  benefit

from wearing it.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item,

sharptooth; Price 40,000 gp; Weight 8 lb.

Pectoral of Maneuverability: This metal disk has straps

that  go  over  a  dragons  forelimbs  to  hold  the  pectoral  in

place over its chest. A winged creature wearing a pectoral of

maneuverability has its flying maneuverability improved by

one  step.  A  greater  pectoral  of  maneuverability improves

maneuverability by two steps. A humanoid can wear a pec-

toral as if it were a vest.

LAIR WARDS

Lair wards are a special kind of wondrous item that drag-

ons  often  use  to  protect  their  lairs  and  hoards. They  are

identical to certain kinds of wondrous architecture used

in humanoid-built strongholds and dungeons, as detailed

in the Stronghold Builders Guidebook. Essentially, lair wards

are immobile (or practically immobile) magic items, and

they follow all the normal rules for the use of magic items.

See  the  Stronghold  Builders  Guidebook for  information  on

creating these items and determining the market price for

new items.

Most lair wards affect an area defined as a single cavern.

This need not be an actual cavern; such an effect wards an

area of approximately 400 square feet.

Disabling a Lair Ward: As a stationary magic item, a

lair  ward  is  essentially  identical  to  a  magic  trap  (even

though some have beneficial rather than harmful effects).

A character with the trapfinding ability (including rogues

and characters affected by a find traps spell) can use Search

to find lair wards and Disable Device to deactivate them.

The DC for both checks is 25 + the spell level of the high-

est-level spell used in the lair wards construction. A suc-

Black Luminary: This 3-foot-wide steel half-orb sheds

darkness  in  a  20-foot  radius  around  itself.  Not  even  crea-

tures who can normally see in the dark can see through it,

and it cancels out any normal light, as well as magical light

of 1st level or lower. If magical light of 2nd level (such as

continual flame) is brought into or cast in the area, it and the

black  luminary  cancel  each  other  out  until  the  light  spell

expires  or  is  removed  from  the  area.  Higher-level  light

spells, such as the daylight spell, are unaffected by a black

luminarys darkness.

The  orb  has  a  shutter  that  enables  a  person  standing

beneath  a  ceiling-mounted  black  luminary  to  conceal  or

reveal the item (and the resulting darkness) with a move

action.

Faint evocation; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, darkness;

Price 6,000 gp.

Black Luminary, Pitch: This 4-foot-wide steel half-orb

sheds  deeper  darkness  in  a  60-foot  radius  around  itself.  Not

even creatures that can normally see in the dark can see in

this darkness, and it cancels out any normal light as well as

any magical light of 2nd level or lower. If a daylight spell is

brought into or cast in the area, it and the pitch black lumi-

nary cancel each other out until the light spell expires or is

removed from the area.

The  orb  has  a  shutter  that  enables  a  person  standing

beneath a ceiling-mounted pitch black luminary to conceal

or  reveal  the  item  (and  the  resulting  darkness)  with  a

move action.

Faint evocation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, deeper dark-

ness; Price 15,000 gp.

Bright Luminary: This 4-foot-wide steel half-orb sheds

daylight in a 60-foot radius around itself. Creatures affected

by normal daylight are affected by a bright luminary as well.

If magical darkness is brought into or cast in the area, it and

the bright luminary cancel each other out until the magical

darkness expires or is removed from the area.

The  orb  has  a  shutter  that  enables  a  person  standing

beneath  a  ceiling-mounted  bright  luminary  to  conceal  or

reveal the item with a move action.

Faint  evocation;  CL 5th;  Craft Wondrous  Item,  daylight;

Price 15,000 gp.

Cavern of the Earthbound: Within the walls of this

cavern, the fly spell does not function. Characters who are

flying when they enter the cavern float to the ground as if

the  spells  duration  had  expired.  When  they  leave  the

cavern,  any  fly spells  whose  durations  have  not  expired

return to normal efficacy.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, spell

immunity; Price 14,000 gp.

Cloudgathering Orb: This 4-foot-wide crystal orb keeps

the  weather  nasty  (thunderstorms  in  spring,  torrential

rain in summer, sleet in autumn, and blizzards in winter)

around  a  lair  for  a  2-mile  radius.  Anyone  attempting  to

magically  alter  the  weather  in  this  area  must  make  an

opposed caster level check against the cloudgathering orbs

power to succeed.

See pages 9395 of the Dungeon Masters Guide for infor-

mation on weather effects.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item,

control weather; Price 33,000 gp.

Cavern of Babble: Anyone who enters this cavern must

make a DC 14 Will save or have any words that she speaks

come out as unintelligible gibberish. The exact nature of the

transmuted  sounds  is  determined  by  the  creator  of  this

magic item at the time of creation.

This effect makes it impossible for anyone in the cavern

to communicate verbally with anyone else. Additionally, it

prevents a spellcaster from casting a spell that requires a

verbal component.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, sculpt

sound; Price 7,500 gp.

Cavern of Silence: All sounds made within this cavern

are negated (as if by a silence spell). Making a DC 13 Will

save allows a character to speak normally (including cast-

ing spells with vocal components), though other sounds

remain dampened.

This  property  doesnt  affect  sounds  created  outside  this

cavern.

Faint illusion; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, silence; Price

3,000 gp.

Hurricanes Eye: This 5-foot-wide crystal orb maintains

hurricane-force winds (see page 95 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide) around the outside of the lair at all times. The eye of

the  hurricane  (the  safe,  calm  part)  is  a  cylinder  with  a

diameter of up to 80 feet. If the lair is larger than this, mul-

tiple orbs can be linked together by overlapping the eyes.

Any section that is surrounded by eyes on all sides auto-

matically  becomes  a  part  of  the  eye,  turning  the  whole

region into one massive, continuously operating eye, keep-

ing the raging winds of the hurricane entirely outside of

the affected regions.

The winds circle the eye in a clockwise or counterclock-

wise fashion, as you prefer. However, if there are more orbs

than one, they must all force the wind to circle in the same

direction.  If  you  join  this  item  up  with  a  tornados  eye or  a

windstorms eye, they can each only function at the level of

the weakest item.

Strong  transmutation;  CL 15th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

Pool of Scrying: This shallow pool forms a reflective sur-

face in which the user can scry on others. This works just

like the standard scrying spell. Spellcasters can cast certain

spells through the pool of scrying at creatures or things they

are scrying upon, as per the scrying spell.

While the pool can be shallow, it must be at least 2 feet by 4

feet. It can be formed into the top of a large pedestal, but these

items are just as often found in a rooms floor. If the water is

ever entirely emptied from the pool, the item loses its magic.

Faint  divination;  CL 5th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  scrying;

control winds; Price 75,000 gp.

Price 7,500 gp.

Inscriptions of Privacy: This form of wondrous archi-

tecture places arcane sigils throughout the walls and ceiling

of a cavern. They can be as subtle or outlandish as the creator

likes. However, when anyone tries to spy upon anyone in

the cavern by means of clairaudience/clairvoyance or scrying or

a crystal ball or any other magic scrying device, the inscrip-

tions  glow  softly.  If  the  scrying  attempt  originates  from

within  the  cavern,  the  person  making  the  attempt  begins

glowing as well.

Anyone scried upon can attempt an opposed caster level

check (using the caster level of the inscriptions of privacy). If

the target of the scrying attempt wins the opposed check,

she  immediately  gets  a  mental  image  of  the  scrier,  along

with a sense of the direction and distance of the scrier, accu-

rate to within one-tenth of the distance.

Moderate divination; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect

scrying; Price 14,000 gp.

Inscriptions  of  Vacancy:  Everyone  within  a  cavern

adorned  with  these  inscriptions  becomes  undetectable  to

scrying. In fact, to someone casting a scrying spell it appears

as  if  the  cavern  is  entirely  empty  of  people  and  devoid  of

activity, no matter how many people are in it or what they

are doing.

Moderate  illusion;  CL 9th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,  false

vision; Price 22,500 gp.

Missing  Chamber:  This  cavernand  everyone  and

everything  inside  itis  difficult  to  detect  by  divination

spells and detection spells and magic items. For such a spell

or item to work, the caster or user must succeed on a caster

level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 16.

Faint abjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, nondetec-

tion; Price 7,500 gp.

Orb of Pleasant Breezes: This 4-foot-wide crystal orb

keeps the weather in a 2-mile radius around the lair mild

and pleasant no matter the time of year. Anyone attempt-

ing to magically alter the weather in this area must make

an  opposed  caster  level  check  against  the  orbs  power  to

succeed.

Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item,

Platform  of  Healing: Any  time  an  injured  creature  is

placed on this 10-foot-round platformwhich is affixed to

the floorthe creature recieves the benefits of a heal spell.

If an undead creature somehow ends up on the platform,

treat it as if a harm spell had been cast upon it instead.

Strong conjuration; CL 17th; Craft Wondrous Item, mass

heal; Price 76,500 gp.

Pool  of  Scrying,  Greater:  This  magic  item  works  just

like the standard pool of scrying, with one exception. You can

reliably cast any spells through it that you could use with

the greater scrying spell.

Moderate  divination;  CL 11th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

greater scrying; Price 33,000 gp.

Secure Cavern: The entire cavern is affected by a mind

blank spell. No one in the cavern can be affected by devices

and  spells  that  detect,  influence,  or  read  emotions  and

thoughts, up to and including miracle or wish. Even a scrying

attempt that scans an area does not work.

Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, mind

blank; Price 60,000 gp.

Sigils of Suppression: A globe of invulnerability fills the

entire cavern, as represented by the arcane sigils that are

inscribed upon the walls. No spell effects of 4th level or

lower function within this cavern. Such spells cannot be

cast  within  the  cavern,  nor  can  their  effects  extend  to

within the cavern.

A  targeted  dispel  magic can  temporarily  suppress  sigils  of

suppression, just like any other magic item.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL 11th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

globe of invulnerability; Price 33,000 gp.

Sigils  of  Suppression,  Lesser:  These  are  identical  to

sigils of suppression, except that they only block spell effects of

3rd level or lower (as per lesser globe of invulnerability).

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, lesser

globe of invulnerability; Price 14,000 gp.

Tornados  Eye:  This  6-foot-wide  crystal  orb  maintains

tornado-force  winds  (see  page  95  of  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide)  around  the  outside  of  the  lair  at  all  times.  See  the

description of the hurricanes eye for how this works.

If this item is joined with a hurricanes eye or a windstorms

eye,  each  item  functions  at  the  level  of  the  weakest  item.

Strong  transmutation;  CL 18th;  Craft  Wondrous  Item,

control winds; Price 90,000 gp.

Veil of Obscurity: This lair ward disguises up to 8,000

contiguous  square  feet  of  caverns  with  a  mirage  arcana

effect, making the lair appear as something other than it is.

It includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,

though it cant disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; Craft Wondrous Item, mirage

arcana; Price 25,000 gp.

Windstorms Eye: This 4-foot-wide crystal orb maintains

windstorm-force winds (see page 95 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide)  around  the  outside  of  the  lair  at  all  times.  See  the

DRAGON

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Dragons rarely adopt character classes. Their perspective

on  the  passing  of  time,  their  enormous  natural  abilities,

and their essentially bestial nature together incline them

to a patient stance of allowing time to advance their abili-

ties, rather than the sort of frantic adventuring

and  training  typical  of  creatures

with character classes.

runes  into  its  own  scales.  The  elemental  master  seeks  a

greater attunement to the natural forces that are a part of

all true dragons physical makeup, mastering the elements

and energies that flow through its veins.

BLOODSCALED FURY

An angry dragon is fearsome indeed. A dragon in a frothing

rage, with its eyes shot red, great gobbets of spittle foaming

from its mouth, and a sheen of blood coating its scales, is a

terror  few  can  withstand.  A  bloodscaled  fury  is  a  dragon

whose rage surpasses that of a human barbarian as the bar-

barians rage surpasses a childs tantrum.

Most  bloodscaled  furies  are  dragons  of  at  least  juvenile

age  with  several  levels  of  barbarian.  A  very  few  dragons

come to the prestige class along a more unusual path, such

as the sohei class or Singh rager prestige class from Oriental

Adventures. Few  blood-

scaled  furies  have  levels

in classes that do not fea-

ture a rage ability.

That  said,  a  not  insignifi-

cant  number  of  dragons,

when they reach an age of

some  maturity  (often  ma-

ture  adult  or  later),  move

directly into prestige classes,

or adopt prestige classes after

a  relatively  short  stint  in

one  of  the  standard  classes

described  in  Chapter  3  of

the  Players  Handbook.

While  the  standard

classes  offer  little

benefit  to  most

dragons,  a  dragon

prestige class can give

a  dragon  access  to  power  that

other dragons can only imagine.

Dragons are sometimes motivated to adopt pres-

tige  classes  for  religious  reasons.  Dragons  who  devote

themselves to the service of the primary dragon deities

frequently  advance  as  sacred  watchers  of  Bahamut  or

unholy ravagers of Tiamat. A number of lesser dragons

(and a scattered handful of true dragons) become dis-

passionate  watchers  of  Chronepsis,  the  draconic

deity of fate, death, and judgment. The legendary

evil  dragon  Ashardalon  inspired  a  cult  of  dra-

conic  followers  who  emulate  him  by  binding

demonic  spirits  to  their  own  hearts.  Other

dragons seek divine status for themselves, and

their  advancement  through  the  dragon  ascen-

dant  prestige  class  measures  their  progress

toward that goal.

Class Skills

Bloodscaled  furies  are

solitary  dragons  and  rather

akin  to  destructive  forces

of  nature.  Their  ten-

dency  toward  chaos

means  that  no  one

can  predict  when  a

bloodscaled fury might

descend  upon  a  human

settlement or wilderness outpost and

level the place, leaving a blasted crater in

its wake.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  bloodscaled  fury,  a

dragon must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Any chaotic.

Base Attack Bonus: +22.

Skills: Intimidate 14 ranks.

Feats: Power  Attack,  Shock

Wave, Windstorm.

Special: Rage: The  dragon

must  have  some  sort  of  rage

ability,  most  commonly  derived

from levels in the barbarian class, and

must  be  able  to  enter  this  rage  at  least

three times per day.

Frightful  Presence: The  dragon  must  have

the frightful presence ability.

Other dragons pursue a prestige class to increase their

power by perfecting their innate abilities. The bloodscaled

fury is a destructive force of nature, a creature of unbridled

chaos,  while  the  hidecarved  dragon  takes  a  more  disci-

plined  approach  to  its  advancement,  carving  protective

The bloodscaled furys class skills (and the key ability for each

skill) are Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Listen

(Wis), Swim (Str), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis). See Chap-

ter  4:  Skills  in  the  Players  Handbook for  skill  descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the bloodscaled fury pres-

tige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  bloodscaled  fury

gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Fearsome Presence (Ex): A bloodscaled fury is a terror

to behold, and the seething fury that churns in its heart in-

spires terror in all who lay eyes on it. The dragons frightful

presence becomes more powerful: The saving throw DC to

resist the ability is increased by the dragons class level. Crea-

tures  with  Hit  Dice  equal  to  or  less  than  1/2  the  dragons

class level + 4 are panicked if they fail their saving throws,

while creatures with more Hit Dice are shaken. Both fear

effects last for 6d6 rounds (rather than the usual 4d6).

Draconic  Fury  (Ex): At  2nd  level,  a  bloodscaled  furys

rage  becomes  more  fearsome.  While  raging,  its  Strength

and Constitution scores increase by an additional 2 points

and it gains an additional +1 morale bonus on its Will saves.

Thus,  an  11th-level  barbarian/2nd-level  bloodscaled  fury

gains +8 to its Strength and Constitution scores and +4 on its

Will saves. (Its Armor Class penalty remains at 2.)

At 6th level, and again at 10th, these bonuses increase by

a similar amount. An 11th-level barbarian/10th-level blood-

scaled fury gains +12 to its Strength and Constitution scores

and +6 on its Will saves.

Scales  of  Blood  (Su): Beginning  at  3rd  level,  a  blood-

scaled  fury  earns  its  name.  When  it  enters  a  rage,  small

quantities of blood ooze out around its scales, lining their

edges  and  adding  to  the  dragons  fearsome  appearance.

More important, the blood supernaturally wards the dragon

from  spells  and  weapon  damage.  For  the  duration  of  the

dragons rage, its spell resistance increases by its class level,

and  its  damage  reduction  improves  as  well.  The  number

before the slash in the dragons damage reduction increases

by 5 at 3rd level. In addition, at 7th level a bloodscaled furys

damage reduction can be overcome only by magic cold iron

weapons, and at 11th level only by epic cold iron weapons.

For example, an old white dragon with damage reduction

10/magic who reaches 3rd level as a bloodscaled fury gains

damage  reduction  15/magic  while  raging.  At  7th  level,  it

gains  damage  reduction  15/magic  and  cold  iron  while

raging, and at 11th level it gains damage reduction 15/epic

and cold iron while raging.

Rend: At 4th level, a bloodscaled fury gains Rend (see page

73) as a bonus feat, even if it doesnt have the prerequisites.

Extended  Fury  (Ex): At  5th  level,  a  bloodscaled  fury

can remain in a rage for a number of rounds equal to 6 + its

Con modifier.

Incite Rage (Ex): At 8th level, a bloodscaled fury gains

the ability to incite rage in its allies whenever it enters a

rage. The dragon can affect all willing allies within 60 feet,

granting them a +4 morale bonus to Strength, a +4 morale

bonus to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves,

and a 2 penalty to Armor Class for as long as the dragon

remains  raging.  This  ability  is  otherwise  identical  to

normal barbarian rage, including the fatigue at the end of

the rage.

Tireless  Fury  (Ex): At  9th  level,  a  bloodscaled  fury  no

longer becomes fatigued at the end of its rage.

Blinding Speed (Ex): A 12th-level bloodscaled fury can

act  as  if  under  the  effects  of  a  haste spell  for  a  total  of  12

rounds each day. The duration of the effect need not be con-

secutive rounds. Activating this power is a free action.

Ex-Bloodscaled Furies

A bloodscaled fury that becomes lawful loses all class fea-

tures  and  cannot  gain  more  levels  as  a  bloodscaled  fury.

DISCIPLE OF ASHARDALON

The ancient red dragon Ashardalon, when struck a mortal

blow by a human druid, replaced his wounded heart with a

living demon: a balor of enormous power named Ammet,

the  Eater  of  Souls.  Inspired  by  this  example,  disciples  of

Ashardalon bind fiendish spirits to their own hearts, even-

tually taking on the characteristics of demonic spawn them-

selves. Disciples of Ashardalon do not really worship the

ancient dragon, nor do they literally learn directly from him

as the word disciple implies, but they regard Ashardalon as

the great exemplar of their path and seek to emulate him in

every way possible.

Dragons of any class or none can qualify for the disciple

of Ashardalon prestige class. Those with a religious or arcane

leaning who have pursued specialized knowledge are most

likely to follow this course. Even the most martially minded

evil dragons, though, often find enough to inspire them in

Ashardalons example that they adopt this class.

Disciples of Ashardalon are members of an organization,

loose-knit and secretive though it may be. Of necessity, they

have  some  contact  with  other  members  of  the  order,  but

their overwhelming personal ambition means they rarely

cooperate with one another in pursuit of their various evil

schemes. They are likely to make use of various minions,

particularly  those  of  a  fiendish  character,  in  pursuit  of

their plans, rather than rely on the cooperation of equals.

Like their evil exemplar, they are often served by deluded

cults made up of evil humanoids or even undead. Both they

and  their  cultists  contemplate  plans  of  sweeping  evil

grandeurseizing power, leveling kingdoms, reclaiming

or destroying ancient artifacts, and the like. They are thus

particularly  well  suited  for  use  in  campaigns  of  epic

scope  and,  quite

likely, epic level.

Requirements

To qualify to become a disciple

of Ashardalon, a dragon must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +18.

Skills: Knowledge  (religion)  18

Feats: Iron  Will,  Quicken  Spell-

Special: Initiation: Before  adopting

the  prestige  class,  a  dragon  must  join

the loose-knit cult of other disciples and

undergo  its  initiation  rites.  This  process

includes  the  ritual  scarring  of  the  dragons

heartan extremely dangerous practice that

would claim the life of a dragon too weak to

qualify for the class, and leaves even those that

do robbed of 1 point of Constitution. (Dragons

that progress to at least 6th level in this

class  regain  the  lost  Constitution

point eventually.)

Class Features

The following are class features of the disciple of Ashar-

dalon prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  disciple  of

Ashardalon gains no proficiency with any weapons,

armor, or shields.

Fiendbond (Su): As part of its initiation, a dis-

ciple of Ashardalon binds a demonic spirit to its

own  heart,  emulating  the  manner  in  which

Ashardalon himself took a balor as his heart.

The dragons alignment changes to chaotic

evil if it was not already of that alignment.

The dragon gains bonus sorcerer spells

as  if  its  Charisma  score  were  2  points

higher than actual.

Resistance  (Ex): A  disciple  of

Ashardalon  gains  resistance  to  acid,

cold, electricity, and fire. This resist-

ance is 5 at 1st level, and increases by

5  at  4th  level  and  every  four  levels

thereafter (10 at 4th level, 15 at 8th

level, and 20 at 12th level).

Spell-Like  Abilities: A  disciple

of  Ashardalon  gains  spell-like

abilities as it increases in level.

Its  caster  level  is  equal  to  its

class level, and its saving throw

DCs are 10 + its Cha modifier +

spell  level.  Once  an  ability  is

gained, the disciple can use it a

certain  number  of  times  per

day, as follows: 3/daydarkness,

poison,  unholy  aura; 1/day

Domain: Knowledge (or able to cast at least three Knowl-

Class Skills

The dispassionate watchers class skills (and the key ability

for each skill) are Concentration (Int), Decipher Script (Int),

Knowledge  (all  skills,  taken  individually)  (Int),  and  Spell-

craft (Int). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The following are class features of the dispassionate watcher

of Chronepsis prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  dispassionate

watcher gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or

shields.

Divine  Conversion: At  1st  level,  a  dispassionate

watcher loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously

gained by virtue of its age and draconic variety. Its effective

divine spellcasting level increases by the number of sor-

cerer levels it sacrificed. These effective levels apply only to

the dragons spellcasting, not to other class abilities (such

as turning undead).

For example, a very old amethyst dragon/1st-level cleric

adopts  the  dispassionate  watcher  of  Chronepsis  prestige

class. Its sorcerer caster level of 11th converts into eleven

effective  cleric  levels,  giving  the  dragon  the  spellcasting

ability of a 12th-level cleric.

A dispassionate watcher of Chronepsis

blasphemy, contagion, desecrate, destruction, horrid wilting, unhal-

low, unholy aura, unholy blight.

Skill  Point  Increase: At  2nd  level,  and  again  at  10th

level, a disciple of Ashardalon gains a pool of bonus skill

points equal to the number of dragon Hit Dice it possesses.

This  pool  represents  a  gradual  transition  from  being  a

creature of the dragon type (with 6 skill points per HD) to

being  an  outsider  (with  8  skill  points  per  HD).  These

bonus skill points are in addition to the skill points gained

at every level, and are not modified by the dragons Intelli-

gence score.

Ability Increase: Every three levels, a disciple of Ashar-

dalons ability scores increase automatically. At 3rd, 6th, 9th,

and 12th level, its Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence all

increase by 1 point. At 6th and 12th level, its Constitution

and Charisma also increase by 1 point. By 12th level, a dis-

ciple of Ashardalon has the ability score adjustments of the

half-fiend template.

Poison Immunity (Ex): A disciple of Ashardalon of 6th

level or higher is immune to all forms of poison.

Natural Armor Increase (Ex): At 7th level, a disciple of

Ashardalons natural armor bonus improves by 1.

Fiendish  Perfection  (Ex): At  12th  level,  a  disciple  of

Ashardalons bond with its demonic spirit is complete and

perfect.  The  dragon  now  has  the  half-fiend  template  and

becomes an outsider rather than a dragon.

DISPASSIONATE WATCHER OF

CHRONEPSIS

The draconic deity of fate, death, and judgment, Chronep-

sis is silent, unconcerned, and dispassionate. Most drag-

ons  respect  him,  but  few  revere  him  or  serve  him  as

clerics  because  of  his  neutral  alignment.  Chromatic  and

metallic  dragons  are  almost  always  too  committed  to

philosophical extremes to become clerics of Chronepsis,

and their passionate adherence to their alignment means

they  have  little  interest  in  the  detached  attitude  of  the

watchers. Most dispassionate watchers are gem dragons,

brown dragons, fang dragons, song dragons, dragon turtles,

or wyverns.

True to their name, dispassionate watchers of Chronep-

sis remain aloof from the events of the world around them,

taking the role of observers rather than active participants.

They are excellent sources of information and advice, and

dragons often appeal to them to judge disputes and com-

plaints. They typically make their lairs in areas that other

dragons use as graveyards, embodying their deitys aspect

as a god of death and keeping the graves safe from robbers

and defilers.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a dispassionate watcher, a dragon must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Any neutral.

Skills: Knowledge (any two) 20 ranks.

Spells: Able to cast divine spells.

Calming  Aura  (Su):  At  1st  level,  a  dispassionate

watcher loses its frightful presence ability (if it had one),

gaining  instead  an  infectious  aura  of  calm  detachment.

This  aura  has  the  same  radius  and  Will  save  DC  as  the

dragons frightful presence ability, if it had one. If it did not

possess frightful presence, the radius is equal to 5 feet per

2 HD the dragon possesses (counting only its base dragon

Hit  Dice,  not  any  class  levels). The Will  saving  throw  to

resist the effect has a DC of 10 + 1/2 dragons base HD + its

Cha modifier. The effect of the aura is the same as that of a

calm emotions spell, but it lasts as long as the dispassionate

watcher does not attack.

Draconic  Knowledge: A  dispassionate  watcher  gains

Draconic Knowledge (see page 69) as a bonus feat. It uses its

dispassionate watcher level as an additional modifier on its

draconic knowledge checks.

Spellcasting: From  2nd  level  on,  when  a  new  dispas-

sionate watcher level is gained, the dragon gains new spells

per day as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcast-

ing class it belonged to before it added the prestige class. It

does  not,  however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a  character  of

that class would have gained (an improved chance of turn-

ing or rebuking undead, wild shape, and so on). This essen-

tially means that the dragon adds the level of dispassionate

watcher  to  the  level  of  whatever  divine  spellcasting  class

the dragon has, then determines spells per day and caster

level accordingly.

If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class

before becoming a dispassionate watcher, the dragon must

decide  to  which  class  it  adds  each  level  of  dispassionate

watcher for the purpose of determining spells per day.

A  very  old  amethyst  dragon/1st-level  cleric/2nd-level

dispassionate watcher has the spellcasting ability of a 13th-

level cleric: 11 from divine conversion of its sorcerer spell-

casting levels, 1 from its single cleric level, and 1 from its

two levels in the prestige class.

If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels

in this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added

to  its  effective  divine  spellcasting  level.  If  the  very  old

amethyst dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its

spellcasting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells

as a 15th-level cleric.

Comprehend Languages (Sp): At 2nd level, a dispassionate

watcher gains the ability to use comprehend languages at will.

Stunning  Rebuke  (Su): A  4th-level  dispassionate

watcher  can  deliver  a  thunderous  rebuke  that  stuns  one

creature of its choice within 100 feet. If the target creature

fails a Will saving throw (DC 10 + dispassionate watchers

class level + 1/2 its Cha modifier), it is stunned for 1d4+1

rounds. This is a sonic effect, but is not language-dependent.

Tongues (Sp): A  5th-level  dispassionate  watcher  can  use

tongues at will.

Discern Lies (Su): At 6th level, a dispassionate watcher

knows  when  anyone  (other  than  a  deity)  is  deliberately

lying. This ability is like the discern lies spell, except that it

works continuously and applies to any creature the dragon

can perceive.

Clearsight (Ex): A 9th-level dispassionate watcher can

see  illusions,  transmuted  creatures  and  objects,  and  dis-

guised creatures and objects for what they really are, pro-

vided they are within 30 feet of the dragon. This ability is

similar to the true seeing spell, except that it also foils mun-

dane disguises.

Vision (Sp): At 10th level, a dispassionate watcher gains

the ability to use vision three times per day. Using this abil-

ity is only a standard action for the dragon.

Analyze Dweomer (Sp): A 12th-level dispassionate watcher

can use analyze dweomer at will.

DRAGON ASCENDANT

Easily the most powerful creatures native to the Material

Plane,  dragons  hold  a  unique  position  in  relation  to  the

powers beyond that plane. Those who become dragon as-

cendants  quest  to  transcend  the  limitations  of  material

existence, rising above all other dragons to become noth-

ing less than deities themselves. Their progress through

the levels of this class represents their advancement toward

their ultimate goal, and they become increasingly godlike

as they advance.

Most  dragon  ascendants  have  not  previously  gained

class  levels,  but  all  are  dragons  of  considerable  age  and

power.  A  few  dragon  clerics,  paladins,  and  blackguards

move into the dragon ascendant prestige class when they

reach  sufficient  levels  of  power.  Members  of  the  divine

share  the  road  with  others  on  the  same

course.  On  the  other  hand,  they  often

have  followers  and  allies  who  support

them on their quest, and they work more

freely  with  lesser  dragons  and  non-

dragons than other dragons do.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  dragon  ascen-

dant, a dragon must fulfill all the follow-

ing criteria.

Race: Any true dragon.

Base Attack Bonus: +30.

Feats: Draconic Knowledge, Fast Heal-

ing,  Great  Fortitude,  Improved  Speed,

Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes.

Special: Consume  Hoard: A  would-

be  dragon  ascendant  must  eat

its  hoard  to  begin  the

process  of  divine  as-

cension.  Its  hoard

must have a value of at

least 100,000 gp, but the

dragon  cannot  choose

and leave the rest

aloneit  must

consume its entire hoard.

Awesome  Aura  (Ex): A

dragon  ascendant  loses  its  in-

nate frightful presence, replac-

ing  it  with  a  special  fear  aura.

This  aura  surrounds  the  drag-

on at any radius it chooses up

to  the  extent  of  its  frightful

presence (30 feet  the dragons

age category), and is always ac-

tive unless the dragon chooses

to  deactivate  it.  The

dragon can choose

to  exclude  its  own

allies  from  the  effect

of  its  aura.  Creatures

within  the  aura  must

make  a  Will  save  (DC  equal

to  the  dragons  frightful  presence

DC  plus  1/2  its  dragon  ascendant

levels). Creatures that fail their saving

throws are shaken, while those that succeed are

immune  to  the  effect  of  that  dragons  aura  for  24

hours. If the dragon attacks or charges, shaken crea-

tures  must  attempt  a  second  Will  save  (same  DC)  or

become frightened.

When a dragon ascendant reaches 5th level, it can choose

to modify its aura to inspire resolve in its allies and dread in

its enemies. All allies of the dragon within the radius of its

aura  receive  a  +4  morale  bonus  on  attack  rolls,  saves,  and

checks.  The  dragons  foes  must  succeed  on  a  Will  saving

throw or take a 4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks.

When  a  dragon  ascendant  reaches  10th  level,  it  gains  a

third option for its aura. The dragon can cause affected crea-

tures to become dazed, simply staring at the dragon in fas-

cinated  awe,  if  they  fail  their  Will  saves.  As  with  the  fear

aspect of the aura, the dragon can choose to exclude its allies

from the effects of the aura.

All  uses  of  a  dragons  awesome  aura  are  mind-affecting

effects.

Hit  Point  Increase  (Ex): At  2nd  level,  and  every  two

levels thereafter, a dragon ascendant gains 1 hit point per

Hit Die it possesses, including all its dragon Hit Dice and

those  gained  from  class  levels. This  benefit  can  never  in-

crease a dragons hit points above the maximum for its Hit

Dice and Constitution bonus.

At 12th level, a dragon ascendants hit points are equal to

the  maximum  for  its  Hit  Dice  and  Constitution  bonus.

Transmutation Immunity (Ex): At 3rd level, a dragon

ascendant  gains  immunity  to  polymorphing,  petrifica-

tion, and any other attack that would alter its form. Any

shape-altering powers or spells the dragon has work nor-

mally on itself.

Increased  Damage  Reduction  (Su): At  4th  level,  a

dragon ascendants damage reduction can be overcome only

by  epic  weapons.  At  8th  level,  the  amount  of  the  dragons

damage reduction (the number before the slash) is increased

by 5. For example, an ancient black dragon/8th-level dragon

ascendant has damage reduction 20/epic.

Lifewarding (Ex): At 6th level, a dragon ascendant is no

longer vulnerable to attacks that cause energy drain, ability

drain, or ability damage.

Deflection Bonus (Su): At 7th level, a dragon ascendant

gains  a  deflection  bonus  to  its  Armor  Class  equal  to  its

Charisma bonus, if any.

Iron  Mind  (Ex): At  9th  level,  a  dragon  ascendant  be-

comes immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compul-

sions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects).

Resistance to Fire (Ex): At 11th level, a dragon ascen-

dant gains resistance to fire 20, if it does not already possess

immunity to fire.

Spell  Resistance  (Ex): At  11th  level,  a  dragon  ascen-

aura and once more advance in the dragon ascendant pres-

tige class if it atones for its violations (see the atonement spell

in the Players Handbook), as appropriate.

ELEMENTAL MASTER

Dragons are creatures of raw elemental power. Two mighty

forces rage within their veins: the energy that powers their

breath weapons, and the elemental nature that forms the core

of their being. Elemental masters strive to attain the purity

of perfect attunement with both of these forces.

The  path  of  the  elemental  master  is  almost  exclusively

pursued by true dragons, since the class requires a connec-

tion  to  elemental  and  energy  forces.  Some  dragons  have

levels in other classes, commonly wizard or sorcerer, before

adopting this prestige class, but many others do not.

Elemental masters are the most solitary and reclusive of

dragons, spending their lives in communion with the natu-

ral forces of the universe rather than interacting with crea-

tures  they  consider  to  be  lesser  life  forms. When  they  do

cooperate with other creatures, they choose elementals and

outsiders from the elemental planes as their allies, and occa-

sionally younger dragons of the same variety.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  an  elemental  master,  a  dragon  must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Base Attack Bonus: +20.

Feats: Any three metabreath feats.

Spells: Able to cast arcane spells.

Special: Elemental Attunement: The dragon must have an

energy or elemental subtype, such as air, cold, earth, elec-

tricity, fire, or water.

Breath Weapon: The dragon must have a breath weapon

that deals energy damage.

Class Skills

The elemental masters class skills (and the key ability for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Knowledge (arcana)

(Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature)

(Int),  Knowledge  (the  planes)  (Int),  Spellcraft  (Int),  and

Survival (Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

dants spell resistance increases to 33.

Class Features

Immortality (Ex): A 12th-level dragon ascendant is actu-

ally a quasi-deity, and can no longer die from natural causes.

It does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. It can still be slain

in physical or magical combat, and it is still subject to death

from massive damage.

Code of Conduct: A dragon ascendant must be absolutely

true to the principles of its alignment, whatever they may be.

A dragon ascendant loses its awesome aura if it ever willingly

commits  an  act  opposed  to  its  alignment  (and  it  does  not

regain its frightful presence), and it cannot gain more levels

as a dragon ascendant. The dragon can regain its awesome

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  elemental  master

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An elemental master

gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Element Mastery (Ex): At 1st level, an elemental master

gains an additional attunement to the element type that cor-

responds to its subtype.

Dragons  with  the  air  or  electricity  subtype  (including

emerald, green, crystal, fang, and song dragons) gain air

mastery: Any airborne creature takes a 1 penalty on attack

and damage rolls made against the dragon.

Dragons with the earth subtype (including blue, copper,

amethyst,  brown,  deep,  and  sapphire  dragons)  gain  earth

mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage

rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground.

Dragons with the fire subtype (including red, gold, and

brass dragons, as well as hellfire wyrms) gain fire mastery:

The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if

both it and its foe are touching fire or using weapons with

the flaming or flaming burst special abilities.

Dragons with the water subtype (including black, bronze,

and topaz dragons) gain water mastery: The dragon gains a

+1  bonus  on  its  attack  and  damage  rolls  if  both  it  and  its

opponent are touching water.

Dragons with the cold subtype (silver and white dragons)

gain cold mastery: The dragon gains a +1 bonus on attack

and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching ice or

using weapons with the frost or icy burst special abilities.

Elemental  Command  (Su): An  elemental  master  can

turn or destroy creatures of the elemental subtype opposed

to its own subtype, just as a good cleric turns undead. It can

rebuke or command creatures of its own elemental subtype,

as an evil cleric rebukes undead. The dragon can use these

abilities  a  total  number  of  times  per  day  equal  to  3  +  its

Charisma modifier.

Air  and  earth  are  opposed  elemental  subtypes;  fire  and

water  are  opposed.  Dragons  with  the  cold  subtype  can

rebuke cold creatures and turn fire creatures.

Energy Attunement (Ex): An elemental master is attuned

to the energy type that powers its breath weapon. Dragons

with more than one breath weapon gain attunement to the

An elemental master

one that deals energy damage, usually acid, cold, electric-

ity, fire, or sonic energy. A dragon with multiple energy

breath  weapons  can  choose  a  single  energy  type  it  is

attuned  to.  This  ability  grants  the  dragon  no  special

powers, but determines the form of powers it gains later,

including energy substitution, energy focus, energy burst,

and energy storm.

Energy  Substitution  (Ex): At  2nd  level,  an  elemental

master  gains  the  ability  to  modify  its  spells  that  have  an

energy  descriptor  so  that  they  use  the  dragons  attuned

energy instead. The substituted spell works normally in all

respects except the type of damage dealt.

Summon Elemental (Sp): Once per day, starting at 2nd level,

an elemental master can use its breath weapon to summon a

Medium elemental corresponding to its elemental subtype.

The dragon breathes as normal, but in the wake of its breath

the  elemental  appears,  attacking  in  the  next  round.  If  it

chooses,  the  dragon  can  instead  summon  an  adult  arrow-

hawk (air or cold), average salamander (fire), adult tojanida

(water), or average xorn (earth). This ability works like the

summon natures ally V spell, with the dragons class level as

its caster level. A dragon with the cold subtype can summon

a Medium water elemental or an adult tojanida.

At 5th level, an elemental master can summon one Large

elemental  or  two  Medium  elementals.  This  ability  works

like the summon natures ally VI spell.

At 8th level, an elemental master can summon one Huge

elemental, two Large elementals, or four Medium elemen-

tals. Instead, the dragon can summon one elder arrowhawk,

noble  salamander,  elder  tojanida,  or  elder  xorn,  or  four

greater  elemental,  two  Huge  elementals,  or  four  Large  or

Medium  elementals.  This  ability  works  like  the  summon

natures ally VIII spell.

Energy Focus (Ex): At 3rd level, an elemental master adds

1 to the save DC of spells it casts with an energy descriptor

corresponding to the dragons attuned energy type.

This  bonus  increases  by  +1  for  every  additional  three

levels the elemental master gains (+2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th

level, and +4 at 12th level), and it stacks with the bonus from

the Spell Focus feat.

Energy  Burst  (Su): A  4th-level  elemental  master  can

create  a  burst  of  damaging  energy  around  its  body. The

burst consists of energy corresponding to the dragons at-

tuned energy type and has a radius of 5 feet per class level

of the dragon. Anything in the area takes 1d8 points of dam-

age per class level of the dragon. A successful Reflex save

(DC 10 + dragons class level + its Con modifier) reduces the

damage by half.

Creating an energy burst counts as a use of the dragons

breath weapon. It cannot breathe or create another burst for

1d4 rounds after creating a burst.

Energy  Storm  (Su): A  7th-level  elemental  master  can

surround itself with a vortex of swirling energy correspon-

ding  to  the  dragons  attuned  energy  type.  The  vortex

extends from the dragon in an emanation with a radius of 5

feet  per  class  level. The  effect  stops  attacks  with  thrown

weapons and projectiles. Such attacks fail if made by crea-

tures inside the area, or if targeted at creatures within the

area, or if their paths take them through the area. The storm

deals  2  points  of  damage  per  class  level  to  every  unpro-

tected creature within its area each round. The storm lasts

for 1 round per class level (though the dragon can dismiss

it as a move action), and counts as two uses of the dragons

breath weapon. The dragon cannot use its breath weapon

(or its energy burst ability) while the storm is in place and

for 2d4 rounds after it subsides.

Spell-Like Ability: At 10th level, an elemental master

gains a spell-like ability associated with its elemental sub-

type.  An  air  dragon  can  use  whirlwind, an  earth  dragon

earthquake, a  fire  dragon  incendiary  cloud, a  water  dragon

horrid wilting, and a cold dragon polar ray. The dragon can use

this ability three times per day, with a caster level of 20th.

Elemental  Qualities  (Ex):  A  12th-level  elemental

master  is  immune  to  poison,  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  and

stunning. It is not subject to critical hits or flanking.

HIDECARVED DRAGON

Hidecarved dragons are members of an enigmatic order of

dragons  and  half-dragons.  Their  name  comes  from  the

markings  engraved  on  their  scales,  which  grant  them  in-

credible  mystical  protection.  Dragons  of  the  hidecarved

order resemble monks in their strict discipline, dedication

to personal perfection, and mystical transcendence.

Most  hidecarved  dragons  are  true  dragons,  since  many

drakes,  landwyrms,  wyverns,  and  other  creatures  of  the

dragon type lack the thick, heavy scales necessary to receive

the  mystical  engravings  of  the  order.  A  half-dragon  can

become a hidecarved dragon only if its nondragon parent

had  very  significant  natural  armor,  although  some  half-

dragon/half-giants have been known to use magic to thicken

their hides sufficiently to qualify for the class. Some dragons

advance in other classescommonly monk, wizard, sorcerer,

or clericbefore adopting this prestige class, primarily to

meet the minimum base Will save requirement.

Hidecarved dragons do not build monasteries, but they

do  gather  in  small  groups  called  lauths. These  tiny  com-

munities of three to five dragons share a large territory and

come together only occasionally, but will gather quickly to

help if one member of the lauth is threatened.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  hidecarved  dragon,  a  dragon  must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Natural Armor Bonus: +20.

Base Save Bonus: Will +12.

Feat: Iron Will.

Class Skills

The hidecarved dragons class skills (and the key ability for

each  skill)  are  Balance  (Dex),  Climb  (Str),  Concentration

(Con),  Diplomacy  (Cha),  Escape  Artist  (Dex),  Hide  (Dex),

Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion)

(Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis),

dragon

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of  the

hidecarved dragon prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:

A hidecarved dragon gains no pro-

ficiency with any weapons, armor,

or shields.

Increased  Spell  Resistance

(Ex): A  hidecarved  dragon  adds

its class level to its natural spell

resistance. Dragons without natu-

ral  spell  resistance  do  not  gain

spell resistance when they adopt

this  class.  However,  if  a  hide-

carved  dragon  with  no  natural

spell resistance ages to the point

where it gains spell resistance, it

adds its class level to the natu-

ral  spell  resistance  it  gains  at

its new age category.

Suppress  Weakness: At

2nd level, a hidecarved drag-

on gains Suppress Weakness

(see page 74) as a bonus feat.

Poison  Resistance  (Ex):

At  2nd  level,  a  hidecarved

dragon gains a +4 bonus on

saving throws against poison.

Energy  Resistance  (Ex):

At  3rd  level,  a  hidecarved

dragon gains resistance 10 to

two  energy  types  it  is  not  already

immune, vulnerable, or resistant to.

The dragon can choose from resistance to acid, cold, elec-

tricity, fire, or sonic energy. For example, a gold hidecarved

dragon could gain resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10.

Still Mind (Ex): At 4th level, a hidecarved dragon gains

a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from

the enchantment school.

Natural  Armor  (Ex): At  4th  level,  a

hidecarved dragons natural armor bonus

increases by +2. At 8th level the increase

becomes  +4,  and  at  12th  level  it  be-

comes +6.

Increased  Damage  Reduc-

tion  (Su): At  5th  level,  the

amount  of  a  hidecarved  dragons

natural  damage  reduction  (the

number  before  the  slash)  in-

creases  by  5,  and  its  damage

reduction can be overcome only

by  chaotic  magic  weapons.  For

example,  a  mature  adult  blue

dragon/5th-level  hidecarved

dragon  has  damage  reduction

15/magic and chaotic.

Extra  Energy  Immunity

(Ex): At 6th level, a hidecarved

dragon  gains  immunity  to  an

energy  type  it  was  already

resistant  to.  Its  resistance  to

one  other  energy  type  it  has

resistance 10 against increases

to  20,  and  it  gains  resistance

10 against a third energy type.

For  this  third  energy  type,  a

dragon  with  the  fire  subtype

cannot  choose  cold,  and  a

dragon  with  the  cold  subtype

cannot choose fire.

The  gold  hidecarved  dragon

from the earlier example could become

immune  to  electricity  at  6th  level,  increase

its acid resistance to 20, and gain resistance

to sonic 10.

At  12th  level,  a  hidecarved  dragons  energy

resistances and immunities improve again. Its resistance

20  becomes  immunity,  its  resistance  10  becomes  resist-

ance 20, and it gains resistance 10 to all other energy types

(acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic) that it is not already

immune or resistant to.

The gold hidecarved dragon example, at 12th level, would

have immunity to fire (naturally), electricity (since 6th level),

and  acid.  It  would  have  resistance  to  sonic  20  and  cold  10.

Overcome Weakness: At 7th level, a hidecarved dragon

gains  Overcome  Weakness  (see  page  72)  as  a  bonus  feat.

Death Ward (Sp): At 7th level, a hidecarved dragon gains

the ability to use death ward on itself once per day as a cleric

of its class level.

Wholeness of Body (Su): At 9th level, a hidecarved drag-

on can cure its own wounds. It can cure up to three times its

class level in hit points each day and can spread this healing

out among several uses.

Poison Immunity (Ex): At 10th level, a hidecarved drag-

on gains immunity to poison of all kinds.

Superior Damage Reduction (Su): At 11th level, a hide-

carved  dragons  damage  reduction  can  be  overcome  only

by epic chaotic weapons. For example, a mature adult blue

dragon/11th-level hidecarved dragon has damage reduction

15/epic and chaotic.

SACRED WARDER OF BAHAMUT

Among dragon clerics of Bahamut, some are moved prima-

rily by compassion for those who suffer from the depreda-

tions of evil dragons. These clerics adopt the sacred warder

of Bahamut prestige class, shaping their identities around

the  idea  of  protecting  those  who  cannot  hope  to  protect

themselves  from  the  awesome  power  of  Tiamats  brood.

Sacred warders of Bahamut are usually gold or silver drag-

ons with some levels in the cleric class. Good half-dragons

are  surprisingly  common  among  the  ranks  of  the  sacred

warders, and they find more acceptance there than in most

other  dragon  groups  and  organizations.  Sacred  warders

often possess some levels of paladin as well as cleric; other

classes are rare.

Sacred  warders  can  be  found  anywhere  evil  dragons

threaten  other  creatures.  Their  usually  lawful  alignment

inclines them to cooperate with other creatures. They some-

times operate in pairs, but more often work with groups of

humanoids or other creatures drawn from the communities

they try to protect.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become a sacred warder of Bahamut, a dragon

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Lawful good or neutral good.

Base Attack Bonus: +15.

Feats: Endure Blows, Power Attack.

Spells: Able to cast divine spells.

Domain: Protection.

Special: Damage reduction 5/magic.

Class Skills

The  sacred  warders  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each  skill)  are  Concentration  (Con),  Diplomacy  (Cha),

Heal (Wis), Knowledge (religion) (Int), and Sense Motive

(Wis).  See  Chapter  4:  Skills  in  the  Players  Handbook for

skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  sacred  warder  of

Bahamut prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A sacred warder gains

no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Divine Conversion: At 1st level, a sacred warder loses

any  effective  sorcerer  level  it  had  previously  gained  by

virtue  of  its  age  and  draconic  variety.  Its  effective  divine

spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels

it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much

more  effectively.  These  effective  levels  apply  only  to  the

dragons  spellcasting,  not  to  other  class  abilities  (such  as

turning undead or wild shape).

For  example,  a  very  old  gold  dragon/1st-level  cleric

adopts the sacred warder of Bahamut prestige class. Its sor-

cerer  caster  level  of  13th  converts  into  thirteen  effective

cleric levels, giving the dragon the spellcasting ability of a

14th-level cleric.

Smite Evil Dragons (Su): Once per day, a sacred warder

of Bahamut of at least 2nd level may attempt to smite an evil

dragon with one normal melee attack. It adds its Charisma

bonus to its attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per

class level. If the sacred warder accidentally smites a dragon

that is not evil, or a creature that is not a dragon, the smite

has  no  effect  but  it  is  still  used  up  for  that  day.  A  sacred

warder can smite any creature of the dragon type that has an

evil alignment.

At 6th level, a sacred warder may smite evil dragons twice

per day, and at 10th level it can do so three times per day.

Spellcasting: From  2nd  level  on,  when  a  new  sacred

warder level is gained, the dragon gains new spells per day

as if it had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class it

belonged to before it added the prestige class. It does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of that class

would  have  gained  (an  improved  chance  of  turning  or

rebuking  undead,  wild  shape,  and  so  on). This  essentially

means that the dragon adds the level of sacred warder to the

level of whatever divine spellcasting class the dragon has,

then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.

If the dragon had more than one divine spellcasting class

before becoming a sacred warder, the dragon must decide to

which class it adds each level of sacred warder for the pur-

pose of determining spells per day.

A very old gold dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level sacred

warder has the spellcasting ability of a 15th-level cleric: 13

from divine conversion of its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1

from its single cleric level, and 1 from its two levels in the

prestige class.

If a dragon advances an age category after taking levels in

this class, the added levels of spellcasting ability are added to

its  effective  divine  spellcasting  level.  If  the  very  old  gold

dragon in the example above lives to be ancient, its spell-

casting level would increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a

17th-level cleric.

Aura  of  Courage  (Ex): At  3rd  level,  a  sacred  warder

becomes immune to fear effects. In addition, the dragons

frightful  presence  ability  alters  so  that  it  inspires  allies  as

well as striking terror into enemies. Allies within the radius

of the dragons aura (30 feet  its age category) are unaffected

by the dragons frightful presence and receive a morale bonus

on their saving throws against fear equal to the dragons class

level  +  its  Cha  modifier.  Allies  within  the  aura  cannot  be

panicked by an evil dragons frightful presence, regardless of

their Hit Dice.

Enemies  within  the  aura  are  affected  normally  by  the

dragons frightful presence.

Sacred Shield (Su): At 7th level, a sacred warder gains the

ability to surround itself with a protective aura that lasts 10

minutes and protects the dragons body and equipment from

attacks. The shield absorbs 10 points of damage per class level.

Once the shield absorbs that much damage, it collapses. The

damage can be from any sourceweapons, spells, any energy

type, and so on. Damage the dragon would not take anyway

(fire damage against a gold dragon, for example, or weapon

damage blocked by the dragons damage reduction) does not

count against the damage absorbed by the shield. The dragon

can use this ability three times per day.

Area Sacred Shield (Su): At 12th level, a sacred warder

of Bahamut can extend its sacred shield to protect an area

with a radius of 30 feet. The dragon can place the barrier

anywhere within its line of sight, and can choose to make

it mobile with respect to an unattended object or willing

creature  (including  the  dragon  itself ). The  shield  blocks

incoming  attacks,  but  creatures  inside  the  shield  can  still

attack out through the shield.

UNHOLY RAVAGER OF TIAMAT

The goddess of evil dragons and of conquest, Tiamat claims

some allegiance from every evil dragon. Those who devote

themselves  entirely  to  her  cause,  however,  are  among  the

most  fearsome  forces  of  evil  in  the  world,  living  embodi-

ments of her destructive power. Unholy ravagers of Tiamat

are dragon clerics that hope to attain a sliver of their deitys

mighty  power  while  aspiring  to  none  of Tiamats  subtlety

and sophistication. Unholy ravagers live only to destroy, and

when they set their minds on destruction, no stone is left

standing on another when they are finished.

Unholy ravagers of Tiamat are usually blue or green drag-

ons with some levels of cleric. Though red dragons are born

with a strong hereditary predisposition to chaos, a number

of them stray from that alignment and end up as neutral evil

unholy ravagers.

An unholy ravager typically works alone, but may drive

marauding  hordes  of  kobolds,  lizardfolk,  or  hobgoblins

ahead of itself to soften up the oppositionor lull its foes

into overconfidence.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements

To qualify to become an unholy ravager of Tiamat, a dragon

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any dragon.

Alignment: Lawful evil or neutral evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +15.

Feats: Maximize Breath, Recover Breath, Tempest Breath.

Spells: Able to cast divine spells.

Domain: Destruction.

Class Skills

The  unholy  ravagers  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each  skill)  are  Climb  (Str),  Concentration  (Con),  Intimi-

date (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowl-

edge  (religion)  (Int),  Spellcraft  (Int),  Survival  (Wis),  and

Swim (Str). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

The  following  are  class  features  of  the  unholy  ravager  of

Tiamat prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: An  unholy  ravager

gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Divine  Conversion: At  1st  level,  an  unholy  ravager

loses any effective sorcerer level it had previously gained by

virtue  of  its  age  and  draconic  variety.  Its  effective  divine

spellcasting level increases by the number of sorcerer levels

it sacrificed, allowing the dragon to cast cleric spells much

more  effectively. These  effective  levels  apply  only  to  the

dragons  spellcasting,  not  to  other  class  abilities  (such  as

turning undead or wild shape).

For  example,  a  very  old  red  dragon/1st-level

cleric adopts the unholy ravager of Tiamat prestige

class. Its sorcerer caster level of 13th converts into

thirteen effective cleric levels in addition to its 1

level of cleric, giving the dragon the spellcasting

ability of a 14th-level cleric.

Smite: An unholy ravager of Tiamat adds its class

levels to its cleric levels to determine its bonus on

damage when using its smite ability (the granted

power of the Destruction domain).

At 4th level, 8th level, and 12th level, an unholy

ravager can use its smite ability one additional

time per day.

Spellcasting: From  2nd  level  on,  when  a

new unholy ravager level is gained, the dragon

gains new spells per day as if it had also gained

a level in a divine spellcasting class it belonged

to before it added the prestige class. It does not,

however, gain any other benefit a character of

that  class  would  have  gained  (an  improved

chance  of  turning  or  rebuking  undead,  wild

shape,  and  so  on). This  essentially  means  that

the dragon adds the level of unholy ravager to

the  level  of  whatever  divine  spellcasting  class

the dragon has, then determines spells per day

and caster level accordingly.

If the dragon had more than one divine spell-

casting class before becoming an unholy ravager,

the  dragon  must  decide  to  which  class  it  adds

each  level  of  unholy  ravager  for  the  purpose  of

determining spells per day.

A very old red dragon/1st-level cleric/2nd-level

unholy  ravager  has  the  spellcasting  ability  of  a

15th-level cleric: 13 from divine conversion of

its sorcerer spellcasting levels, 1 from its single

cleric  level,  and  1  from  its  two  levels  in  the

prestige class.

If a dragon advances an age category after

taking levels in this class, the added levels

of spellcasting ability are added to its effec-

tive divine spellcasting level. If the very

old red dragon example above lives to be

ancient,  its  spellcasting  level  would

increase by 2, so it would cast spells as a

17th-level cleric.

Breath  Weapon  Substitution  (Sp): A

2nd-level unholy ravager of Tiamat can

use breath  weapon  substitution at  will.

However, using this ability increases

the number of rounds the dragon must

wait  before  using  its  breath  weapon

again by 1 round, as if it were using

a metabreath feat.

Aura  of  Despair  (Su):  At  3rd

level,  an  unholy  ravagers  frightful

presence  alters  slightly.  In  addition

to  the  fear  effect,  creatures  within

the  radius  of  the  dragons  frightful

presence take a 2 penalty on all saving throws. This penalty

is applied before creatures roll their saving throws against

the frightful presence effect itself.

Profane  Blast  (Su): At  7th  level,  an  unholy  ravager  of

Tiamat can unleash a narrow blast of raw profane energy from

its mouth three times per day. The blast is a ray, requiring a

ranged touch attack, with a range of 400 feet + 40 feet per class

level. The blast looks and feels like energy of the same type

as the dragons breath weapon. If it hits a target, it deals the

same number of dice worth of damage as the dragons breath

weapon, but uses d12s. (So, a great wyrm blue dragon would

deal  24d12  points  of  damage  with  its  profane  blast.)  The

damage  it  deals  results  directly  from  divine  power  and  is

therefore  not  subject  to  being  reduced  by  protection  from

energy and similar magic. Each use of this ability counts as a

use of the dragons breath weapon, so it cannot use its breath

weapon for 1d4 rounds after issuing a profane blast.

An unholy ravager can target a creature behind a wall of

force, prismatic wall, or prismatic sphere with its profane blast.

The dragon makes a special dispel check, rolling 1d20 + its

age category + its class level against a DC of 11 + the effects

caster level. If this check is successful, the effect is instantly

negated (all layers in a prismatic effect are destroyed) and

the ray goes on to strike the intended target (if the ranged

touch  attack  roll  is  successful).  A  profane  blast  is  stopped

normally  by  a  sacred  warder  of  Bahamuts  sacred  shield.

Mass Profane Blast (Su): At 12th level, an unholy rav-

ager of Tiamats profane blast occupies the same area as its

breath weapon and affects all creatures within that area. The

dragon can choose whether to use a ray profane blast or a

mass profane blast, and can use both abilities no more than

a total of three times per day.

If a wall of force or prismatic effect is within the area of a

mass profane blast, the dragon makes a special dispel check

as  described  above  for  each  such  effect  within  the  area.

ADVANCED DRAGONS

The advancement rules in the Monster Manual allow drag-

ons  theoretically  infinite  progression  even  beyond  the

statistics of great wyrm. This book lets dragons improve

more than their Hit Dice as they progress to unparalleled

heights of power.

Age Category: A standard dragon gains one virtual age

category  for  every  3  Hit  Dice  it  gains  beyond  the  great

wyrm  stage.  A  61  HD  red  dragon,  with  21  more  Hit  Dice

than a standard great wyrm, has gained seven virtual age

categories, meaning its effective age category is nineteen.

Abilities that function once per day per age category or oth-

erwise use the dragons age category as part of a calculation

use this adjusted number.

Size: One important element of dragon advancement is

increasing size. The dragons that dont reach Colossal size by

the  great  wyrm  stage  can  never  reach  it  according  to  the

standard  advancement  rules.  When  advancing  a  dragon,

consider its basic size group: smaller (black, brass, copper,

and white dragons), normal (blue, bronze, and green drag-

ons), or larger (gold, red, and silver dragons). A dragon that

is Tiny as a wyrmling is in the smaller group, a dragon that

is Small as a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size is in

the normal group, and a dragon that is Small to Large as a

wyrmling and reaches Colossal by the great wyrm stage is in

the larger group.

A  smaller-sized  dragon  becomes  Colossal  when  it  gains

two age categories (+6 HD) beyond great wyrm. It increases

to Colossal+ (see below) when it gains an additional four age

categories (+18 HD total). Thus, a white great wyrm reaches

Colossal size at 42 HD and Colossal+ at 54 HD, while a brass

great wyrm becomes Colossal at 43 HD and Colossal+ at

55 HD.

A  normal-sized  dragon  becomes  Colossal  when  it  gains

one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases

to Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories

(+15 HD total). Thus, a green great wyrm reaches Colossal

size at 41 HD and Colossal+ size at 53 HD, while a bronze

dragon becomes Colossal at 42 HD and Colossal+ at 54 HD.

A  larger-sized  dragon  becomes  Colossal+  when  it  gains

four age categories (12 HD) more than it needed to reach

the  Colossal  size.  Thus,  a  silver  or  red  dragon  becomes

Colossal+ at 52 HD, and a gold dragon becomes Colossal+ at

53 HD.

Colossal+ Size: Although there is no size category larger

than Colossal, the largest advanced dragons have a greater

reach and deal more damage with their attacks than other

Colossal dragons. These dragons are said to be of Colossal+

(Colossal plus) size.

A Colossal+ dragon has a space of 30 feet, like any other

Colossal dragon, but its reach is 10 feet longer than normal

with each attack form, and it has a proportionately longer

tail slap and tail sweep. A Colossal+ dragon deals 6d6 points

of damage with its bite attack, 4d8 with its claws, 4d6 with

its wings, 4d8 with its tail slap, 6d6 with its crush, and 4d6

with its tail sweep.

A Colossal+ dragons line-shaped breath weapon extends

160 feet (5 feet high and 5 feet wide, as normal). A Colossal+

dragons cone-shaped breath weapon is 80 feet long, 80 feet

high, and 80 feet wide. The size modifier for these dragons

remains 8.

Armor Class: An advanced dragons natural armor bonus

increases by +1 for every Hit Die it gains beyond the great

wyrm stage. (You can use this rule for lesser dragon advance-

ment  as  well,  since  natural  armor  and  Hit  Dice  always

increase at the same rate.)

Breath  Weapon: If  an  advanced  dragons  breath

weapon deals damage, the damage typically increases by 2

dice for every virtual age category the dragon gains. The

two  exceptions  in  the  Monster  Manual are  the  brass  and

white dragons, whose breath weapon damage increases by

only 1 die per age category. The saving throw DC against

the breath weapon remains 10 + 1/2 the dragons HD + its

Con modifier.

Spell Resistance: An advanced dragons spell resistance

increases by 2 per additional age category.

Speed: An advanced dragons fly speed, maneuverability,

land  speed,  and  other  special  movement  types  (swim,

burrow, and so on) do not change.

Ability Scores: A great wyrms Strength and Constitu-

tion scores both increase by 2 points for every virtual age

category  the  dragon  gains.  Its  Dexterity  remains

unchanged.  Its  Intelligence,  Wisdom,  and  Charisma

increase  by  2  points  for  every  two  virtual  age  categories

the dragon gains.

Special Abilities: Dragons do not gain additional spell-

like abilities. When a dragon gains one virtual age category

beyond  the  great  wyrm  stage,  its  damage  reduction  im-

proves to 20/epic.

Caster  Level: A  great  wyrms  sorcerer  caster  level

increases  by  2  for  every  virtual  age  category  the  dragon

gains.

Feats: Like ordinary dragons, advanced dragons receive

one  feat  for  every  4  Hit  Dice  they  have.  Any  feats  gained

after the dragon reaches old age can be epic feats (see the

descriptions earlier in this chapter).

Challenge  Rating:  An  advanced  dragons  Challenge

Rating  increases  by  2  per  additional  virtual  age  category.

All other dragon statistics are as presented for dragons in

general and specific dragon varieties in the Monster Manual

and other sources.

SAMPLE ADVANCED DRAGON

This  example  uses  a  red  dragon  advanced  to  61  Hit  Dice.

This advance represents an increase of 21 HD, or seven vir-

tual age categories.

dragon is the player characters worst nightmare. Its

likely the strongest foe hell ever fight, as well as the

smartest. The typical dragon has every conceivable

advantage  over  an  average  group  of  adventurers,

and  then  some.  Any  character  who  even  thinks

about  fighting  a  dragon  should  have  his  head  examined.

All  of  that  is  what  dragons  (and  DMs)  want  players  to

think. They count on intimidating players (and their char-

acters) before they even set out on the hunt. This chapter

is designed for those characters brave enough to disregard

the  dire  warnings,  the  lurid  stories,  and  even  common

sense itself. This chapter is for dragonslayers.

This chapter also holds information for those who count

a dragon among their allieswhether as cohort, mount, or

familiar, as trusted ally or contact, or even as master.

FIGHTING A DRAGON

A dragon brings significant advantages to any combat

mobility, ranged attacks, keen senses, intelligence, dura-

bility, and, of course, the ability to deal out tremendous

quantities of damage. Here are some tips for the would-be

dragonslayer on how to even the odds.

relevant factors before gearing up. Particularly if your

DM  utilizes  dragons  beyond  those  in  the  Monster

Manual, its not enough just to know that the dragon

has dark scales or breathes fire.

Start  with  mundane  methods,  such  as  Gather

Information or bardic knowledge. Once you have a

few good leads, divination magic is the way to go.

Low-level dragonhunters can use augury or clairau-

dience to gain important clues, while more powerful

characters  can  employ  divination or commune to

answer important questions and arcane eye, scrying,

or  even  ethereal  jaunt to  scout  out  a  dragons  lair

before  walking  in.  Sure,  the  dragon  is  likely  to

detect your spying attempt, but that doesnt mean

it  knows  whos  coming  or  when  youll  arrive.

Once you know what youre up against, stock

up on appropriate offensive and defensive items.

Assuming such is an option, dont hesitate to pick

up scrolls or potions of resist energy or protection

from energy to help offset breath weapon effects.

Throw in an appropriate wand or batch of scrolls

with the right attack spells (fireball, cone of cold,

and the like), and youre on your way to victory.

FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED

Before you even think about fighting a dragon, do your

research. Confirm the dragons kind, age, and any other

If  at  all  possible,  you  should  never  battle  a

LIMIT THE BATTLEFIELD

dragon  in  any  area  where  it  can  take  full 101

path of approach, with an eye toward bypassing rather than

overcoming the dragons defenses. If you have access to it,

find the path is perfect for this job. Sure, you might be able

to mow through the ogres at the cavern entrance without

breaking a sweat, but once the carnage begins, the dragon

knows youre coming.

SPREAD OUT, CONCENTRATE ATTACKS

Of course, one drawback to fighting a dragon in an enclosed

area (hey, no plan is perfect) is that the dragon can probably

target more characters with its breath weapon. Dont bunch

upto the dragon, three characters are a target, but one is

probably a waste of a breath. When fighting dragons with

line-shaped breath weapons (such as black or blue dragons),

for Pelors sake, dont all stand in the same corridor.

But its not only the dragons breath weapon that a group

of characters must worry about. A dragons full attack rou-

tine is devastating, and as tempting as it is to encourage a

dragon to split up its attacks between multiple PCs, most

dragons  focus  their  physical  attacks  on  a  single  target

until  that  target  is  down.  If  your  fighter  is  likely  to  be

turned into dragon chow anyway, theres no point in stand-

ing nearby and letting the dragon

use its Cleave feat, tail sweep, or

any  leftover  attacks  on  you.

That  may  sound  a  bit  harsh,

but healing fighters is what

clerics are for.

A ranger examines

a dragons

footprint

unaware that hes

partially in the

shadow of the same

dragons wing.

That  said,  there  may

be reasons to

advantage of its flight (or swimming) capability. Fighting a

dragon in a large cavern (or worse yet, outdoors) is a strategy

destined to fail.

You  can  try  to  lure  a  dragon  into  cramped  corridors  or

other small areas, but only the least intelligent will fall for

this trick. Instead, use spells and common sense to alter the

battlefield conditions as you go. Spells such as slow or earth-

bind (a new spell described on page 112) can limit a dragons

mobility. Control water takes away the black dragons favorite

hiding place. Wall of stone, blade barrier, and similar spells can

drastically change the layout of a battle.

Alternatively, you can take the fight to the dragon with

spells  such  as  fly, air  walk,  or  water  breathing.  But  keep  in

mind that the dragon is more adept at moving in the air (or

water) than you do.

The  dragons  reach  is  closely  connected  to  its  mobility.

Try to avoid charging through its threatened area and giving

the dragon too many free attacksthe dragon doesnt need

any  more  advantages.  Use  Mobility  and  Spring  Attack  to

decrease or neutralize the effect of the dragons reach; bar-

ring  that,  arm  yourself  with  a  longspear  or  some  other

reach weapon.

Even if you cant take advantage of any of these techniques,

at least stay mobile during the fight. Assuming youre fight-

ing in the dragons lair, it knows the terrain much better than

you do, and if you sit in the same place lobbing fireball after

fireball, rest assured that the dragon will come to you. Use

shoot-and-scoot techniques, such as those offered by Shot

on the Run, so that the dragon cant plan its attack routines

too far in advance. Movement-enhancing spells such as expe-

ditious retreat, longstrider, and haste can help counteract the

dragons speed.

Since darkness is a dragons best friend, dont hesitate to

light up the battlefield. Light and continual flame work rea-

sonably well, but theres no substitute for the daylight spell,

with its 60-foot radius of bright light. If the dragon

supplements darkness with fog or mist, a gust of wind

spell can also negate its advantage.

THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE

While its extraordinarily difficult to sneak up on

a dragon, thanks to its scent, darkvision, low-light

vision, and blindsense abilities, it doesnt hurt to keep

a  low  profile  for  as  long  as  possible.  Dont  just  trudge

down the hallway, stand outside casting spells, then kick

in the doorby now the dragon not only knows you and

your companions are there, it has probably figured out your

races, classes, and favorite breakfast foods.

Use silence or, if youre lucky enough to have a bard along,

sculpt  sound to  muffle  your  approach. Though  invisibility

probably wont work against the dragon, it might protect

you from any guardians it has stationed outside its lair (see

below).  Hide  from  dragons (a  new  spell  described  on  page

113) can even help you defeat its blindsense.

Dragons  are  smart,  and  they  often  bargain  with  other

creatures  to  guard  their  lairs  or  supplement  their  own

defenses with traps or spells. Use that augury or divination

scroll youve been carrying around to determine the best

stick together, at least for a while. Staying close to the pal-

adin means youre more likely to resist the dragons frightful

presence, at the risk of being vulnerable to a breath weapon

attack. If youre relying on a magic circle against evil, antimagic

field, or similar emanation, dont go running off by yourself.

If you plan to flank the dragonand a rogue shouldnt be in

the fight for any other reasonstay close enough to get into

combat with a single move.

Spreading out your forces doesnt mean you cant concen-

trate your firepower. Once the battle begins, hit the dragon

with everything you have, and dont hold back. Dont waste

your time on the dragons minions (unless they prevent you

from targeting the dragon)you can deal with them after

the dragon is dead, assuming they stick around.

In following this tip, fighters often make the mistake of

thinking that its most important to use a full attack against

the dragon. Chances are that the dragons full attack is more

devastating than yours, and anyway, your second, third, or

fourth attack in the round may not even have much likeli-

hood of hitting. Theres no shame in making only a single

attack and then falling back to a safe distance (particularly if

you  can  do  so  without  provoking  attacks  of  opportunity).

Just be sure to make that one attack count, with tactics such

as a charge, the Power Attack feat, a smite ability, and the like.

CLOSE-QUARTERS FIGHTING [GENERAL]

You are skilled at fighting at very close range and in evading

grappling attempts.

Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: You  can  make  an  attack  of  opportunity  when

someone tries to grapple you, provided that you are not flat-

footed  or  already  grappled,  even  if  the  attacker  has  the

improved grab ability.

Any  damage  you  deal  with  your  attack  of  opportunity

applies as a bonus to the ensuing grapple check you make to

avoid becoming grappled. This feat does not grant you an

additional attack of opportunity in a round, so the feat does

not help you if you have no attacks of opportunity available.

Normal: A creature with the improved grab ability does

not  provoke  an  attack  of  opportunity  when  beginning  a

grapple.

DONT STAY TOO LONG

CUNNING SIDESTEP [GENERAL]

Regardless of your good tactics, you may find yourself in a

battle  you  simply  cant  win.  Remember  that,  particularly

against  dragons,  discretion  is  the  better  part  of  valor.  If

youve lost or are in imminent danger of losing a key party

member  (such  as  the  cleric  whos  keeping  you  alive,  the

wizard whos blasting the dragon with spells, or the fighter

whos  keeping  the  dragon  from  munching  the  rest  of  the

party), strongly consider falling back to return another day.

Plus, youre now better informed about your foe, allowing

you to prepare more effectively.

Dont  waste  too  much  time  recuperating,  though. The

longer you stay away, the more rested and ready the dragon

is likely to be when you return.

You have a better than normal chance to avoid being bull

rushed or tripped.

Prerequisites: Improved  Unarmed  Strike,  Clever

Wrestling, size Small or Medium.

Benefit: When your opponent is larger than Medium,

you gain a circumstance bonus on any opposed check you

make to avoid being bull rushed, tripped, knocked down,

or pushed. The size of the bonus depends on your oppo-

nents size:

FEATS

Characters who find themselves interacting with dragons

whether as friend or foemay find the feats in this section

very  useful.  Some  even  let  a  character  mimic  the  innate

power of dragons.

These  feats  are  described  below  in  alphabetical  order,

using the format described on page 89 of the Players Hand-

book. See Table 31 for a summary of these feats, their pre-

requisites, and their benefits.

CLEVER WRESTLING [GENERAL]

You have a better than normal chance to escape or wriggle

free from a big creatures grapple or pin.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, size Small or

Medium.

Benefit: When  your  opponent  is  larger  than  Medium,

you  gain  a  circumstance  bonus  on  your  grapple  check  to

Special: This  feat  is  effective  against  the  Large  and  in

Charge feat. The bonus from this feat does not stack with

the Clever Wrestling feat.

DEFT STRIKE [GENERAL]

You  can  place  attacks  at  weak  points  in  your  opponents

defenses.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Spot 10 ranks,

sneak attack +1d6.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can attempt to find a

weak point in a visible targets armor. This requires a Spot

check against a DC equal to your targets Armor Class. If you

succeed, your next attack against that target (which must be

made  no  later  than  your  next  turn)  ignores  the  targets

armor bonus and natural armor bonus to AC (including any

enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor). Other AC

bonuses still apply normally.

If  you  use  a  ranged  weapon  to  deliver  the  attack,  your

of dragons. Likewise, you gain a +2 competence bonus on

any opposed check (such as a bull rush attempt or a grapple

check) you make against a dragon.

DRAGON HUNTER BRAVERY [GENERAL]

You resist dragons frightful presence, and your mere pres-

ence helps others resist as well.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, Dragon Hunter.

Benefit: You and all allies within 30 feet who can see you

NEW SPELLS

This  section  presents  a  variety  of  dragon-related  spells,  as

well as three new cleric domains. The following spell lists

use the format and notational style described on page 181

of  the  Players  Handbook. Spell  descriptions  are  presented

alphabetically after the spell lists.

PRESTIGE DOMAINS

The two prestige domains described here, Domination and

Glory, are available only to characters who have qualified to

select  the  domains  as  a  class  feature  (such  as  those  who

adopt  the  dracolyte  prestige  class;  see  page  122). They  are

not available to beginning characters.

OVERHEAD THRUST [GENERAL]

ASSASSIN SPELLS

You can deal a nasty attack to anything that tries to crush or

run over you.

Benefit: You  can  use  a  slashing  or  piercing  weapon  to

make an attack of opportunity against a foe using an attack

designed to batter you from above, such as an overrun, tram-

ple, power dive, or dragon crush attack. You cannot use this

feat if you are flat-footed or already grappled. This feat does

not  grant  you  an  additional  attack  of  opportunity  in  a

round, so the feat does not help you if you have no attacks

of opportunity available.

You gain a special attack modifier based on your oppo-

nents  size,  as  shown  below.  If  your  attack  hits,  you  deal

triple damage.

Large

Special: Any extra damage dice your attack deals (such as

from a sneak attack ability or a weapon special ability) are

not multiplied by this feat.

If you score a critical hit with your attack, the extra dam-

age you deal stacks with the extra damage from this feat. Add

the damage multipliers together according to the standard

rule (see Multiplying, page 304 of the Players Handbook). For

example, if your weapon deals double damage on a critical

hit, any critical hit you score while also using this feat deals

quadruple damage.

SENSE WEAKNESS [GENERAL]

You can take advantage of subtle weaknesses in your oppo-

nents defenses.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus.

Benefit: Whenever you attack with a weapon with which

you have selected the Weapon Focus feat, you may ignore up

to 5 points of the targets damage reduction (regardless of

the  material  or  enhancement  bonus  of  your  weapon)  or

hardness. This  benefit  cant  reduce  the  effective  damage

reduction or hardness of a target to less than 0.

Antimagic Ray

Abjuration

Level: Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One creature or object

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

An invisible ray projects from your fingers. You must succeed

on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. The

target, if struck, functions as if it were inside an antimagic field.

If this spell is used against a creature, the target cant cast

spells or cant use supernatural or spell-like abilities, nor do

such abilities have any effect on the creature. However, the

creature can still use spell completion items (such as scrolls)

or spell trigger items (such as wands), even though it cant

cast the spells required.

If this spell is usewd against an object, that objects magi-

cal  powers  are  suppressedincluding  any  spells  previ-

ously cast and currently in effect on the item, as well as any

spells or magical effects targeted on the object during the

antimagic rays duration. Remember that an object struck by

the ray only receives a saving throw if it is attended or if it is

a magic item. An unattended item, even if currently under

the effect of a spell (such as a torch with continual flame cast

upon it), receives no save.

The spell doesnt affect any objects other than the target

itself, even if those objects are worn, carried by, or in contact

Evocation [Good]

Level: Glory 6

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Effect: Ray

Duration: Instantaneous

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: Yes

You project a bolt of positive energy at a single creature. You

must make a successful ranged touch attack to strike your

target. The bolt deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster

levels (maximum 7d6). Against undead, evil outsiders, and

creatures  native  to  the  Negative  Energy  Plane,  the  bolt

instead deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maxi-

mum 15d6). The bolt deals no damage to good outsiders or

creatures native to the Positive Energy Plane.

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 minute/level or until used

Saving Throw: None

Spell Resistance: No

At  one  point  during  the  duration  of  this  spell,  you  can

attempt  to  alter  the  outcome  of  a  game  of  chance. This

spell  can  only  affect  nonmagical  games,  such  as  those

using  cards  or  dice.  It  cannot  affect  a  game  involving

magic,  nor  a  magic  item  involved  in  a  game  of  chance

(such as a deck of many things). Whenever a roll is made to

determine the outcome of the game, a character under the

effect of this spell may demand a reroll and take the better

of the two rolls.

For example, Darkon is playing a game that he has a 1 in

4 chance of winning. The DM secretly rolls 1d4 and tells

the player that Darkon lost. Because Darkon is under the

effect of a cheat spell, the player can have the DM reroll.

The spell alters probability, so there is no subterfuge that

another character could notice (except for the casting of

the spell itself ).

Focus: A pair of dice made from human bones.

Cloak of Bravery

Abjuration [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Clr 3, Pal 2

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 60 ft.

Area: 60-ft.-radius emanation centered on you

Duration: 10 minutes/level

Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

All  allies  within  the  area  (including  you)  gain  a  morale

bonus on saving throws against fear effects equal to your

caster level (max +10).

Contingent Energy Resistance

Abjuration

Level: Clr 4, Drd 4, Sor/Wiz 5

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 minute

Range: Personal

Target: You

Duration: 1 hour/level (D)

This spell functions similarly to contingency, but with a more

limited scope. While contingent energy resistance is in effect, if

you are dealt damage associated with one of the five types of

energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the spell auto-

matically  grants  you  resistance  10  against  that  type  of

energy  for  the  remainder  of  the  spells  duration  (just  as  if

you were under the effect of a resist energy spell of the appro-

priate type).

Once  the  energy  type  protected  against  by  a  particular

casting of this spell is determined, it cant be changed. You

cant have more than one contingent energy resistance in effect

on yourself at the same timeif you cast the spell a second

time while an earlier casting is still in effect, the earlier spell

automatically expires.

The  energy  resistance  granted  by  this  spell  does  not

stack with similar benefits against the same energy type

(such  as  from  the  resist  energy spell).  However,  it  is  pos-

sible to be simultaneously under the effect of resist energy

(fire) and contingent  energy  resistance  (electricity), or  any

110

other two such spells that protect against different types

of energy.

Material Component: A pearl worth at least 100 gp.

Crown of Glory

Evocation

Level: Glory 8

Components: V, S, M, DF

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: 120 ft.

Area: 120-ft.-radius emanation, centered on you

Duration: 1 minute/level

Saving Throw: Will negates

Spell Resistance: Yes

You are imbued with an aura of celestial authority, inspiring

awe in all lesser creatures that behold your terrible perfec-

tion and righteousness. You gain a +4 enhancement bonus

to Charisma for the duration of the spell.

All creatures in the spells area with fewer than 8 Hit Dice

or levels cease whatever they are doing and are compelled to

pay attention to you. Any such creature that wants to take

hostile action against you must succeed on a Will save to do

so. Any creature that fails this save the first time it attempts

a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as

the enthrall spell) as long as it is in the spells area, and it will

not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 or more

Hit Dice are not affected by this spell.

When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand

you, even if they do not understand your language. While

the spell lasts, you can make up to three suggestions to crea-

tures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the mass sug-

gestion spell (Will negates); creatures with 8 HD or more are

not affected by this power.

Material Component: An opal worth at least 200 gp.

Death Dragon

Necromancy [Evil, Fear, Mind-Affecting]

Level: Clr 7

Components: V, S, DF

Casting Time: 1 round

Range: Personal

Effect: Dragon-shaped armor of energy and bones

Duration: 1 round/level (D)

You  summon  unholy  power  to  gird  yourself  in  a  dragon-

shaped  cocoon  of  bones  and  negative  energy. The  cocoon

gives  you  a  +4  enhancement  bonus  to  your  natural  armor

and a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, plus 1 temporary

hit point per caster level (maximum 20). You are treated

as armed when you make unarmed attacks, and you deal

damage as if your limbs were short swords of an appropriate

size. You can use your off hand to attack, incurring the stan-

dard  two-weapon  fighting  penalties  (see  page  160  of  the

Players Handbook). The death dragon prevents you from cast-

ing spells with somatic, material, or focus (but not divine

This  spell  summons  a  dragon.  You  may

ask  the  dragon  to  perform  one  task  in

exchange for a payment from you. Tasks

might  range  from  the  simple

(fly  us  across  the  chasm,  help

us fight a battle) to the complex

(spy on our enemies, protect

us on our foray into the dun-

geon).  You  must  be  able  to

communicate with the dragon

to bargain for its services.

The  summoned  dragon  requires

payment  for  its  services,  which  takes

the form of coins, gems, or other pre-

cious objects the dragon can add

to  its  hoard. This  payment  must

be made before the dragon agrees

to perform any services. The bar-

gaining takes at least 1 round, so

any  actions  by  the  creature  begin  in

the round after it arrives.

You  gain  a  breath  weapon  resembling  that  of  a  dragon.

When you cast this spell, you choose both the shape and

energy  type  of  the  breath  weapon,  from  the  following

options: line (acid, electricity, or fire) or cone (acid, cold, or

fire). A line is 5 feet high, 5 feet wide, and 60 feet

long, while a cone is 30 feet long, 30 feet

high, and 30 feet wide. Once you make the

selection  of  shape  and  energy  type,  it  is

fixed for the duration of the spell.

Using your breath weapon is a standard

action. The breath weapon deals 3d6 points

of damage of the chosen energy type, plus an

additional 1d6 points of damage for every two

levels above 5th (to a maximum of 10d6 at

19th  level).  Targets  in  the  area

may  attempt  a  Reflex  save  for

half damage.

You  can  use  this  breath

weapon  up  to  three  times

during  the  spells  duration

(plus  one  additional  use  per

two  levels  above  5th).  After

using this breath weapon, you cant

use it again for 1d4+1 rounds. (Using

this  breath  weapon  has  no  effect  on

your ability to use other breath weapons

you might have, and vice versa.) You cant

have  more  than  one  dragon  breath spell

active at the same time.

Even  though  using  your  breath

weapon  poses  no  danger  to  you,  you

dont gain any resistance or immunity

to  the  energy  type  of  the  weapon.

Special: Sorcerers  cast  this  spell

Hennet uses the dragonskin

spell to give himself scales like

a red dragon.

You gain the visual acuity of a dragon, including low-light

vision, darkvision, and blindsense.

You can see four times as well as a normal human in low-

light conditions and twice as well in normal light. (See the

Dragon Sight sidebar, page 17.) Your darkvision has a range

of 10 feet per caster level.

Your blindsense has a range of 5 feet per caster level. You

do not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice crea-

tures within range of your blindsense.

None  of  these  effects  stack  with  any  low-light  vision,

darkvision, or blindsense you may already have.

Focus: A dragons eye.

Duration: 1 minute/level (D)

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial

Spell Resistance: Yes

You  hamper  the  subject  creatures  ability  to  fly  (whether

through natural or magical means) for the duration of the

spell. If the target fails its saving throw, its fly speed (if any)

becomes 0 feet. An airborne creature subjected to this spell

falls  to  the  ground  as  if  under  the  effect  of  a  feather  fall

spell.  Even  if  a  new  effect  would  grant  the  creature  the

ability to fly, that effect is suppressed for the duration of

the earthbind spell.

If  the  target  makes  a  successful  Fortitude  save,  its  fly

speed (including any new effect granted during the spells

duration) is reduced by 10 feet per caster level (maximum

reduction 100 feet at 10th level). This reduction cant bring

the creatures fly speed down to less than 10 feet.

Earthbind has no effect on other forms of movement, or

even on effects that might grant airborne movement with-

out granting a fly speed (such as jumping or levitate or air

walk spells).

Energy Immunity

Abjuration

Level: Clr 6, Drd 6, Sor/Wiz 7

Components: V, S

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Touch

Target: Creature touched

Duration: 24 hours

Saving Throw: None (harmless)

Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless)

This abjuration grants a creature complete protection against

damage from whichever one of five energy types you select:

acid,  cold,  electricity,  fire,  or  sonic. The  spell  protects  the

recipients equipment as well.

Energy immunity absorbs only damage. The recipient could

still suffer unfortunate side effects, such as drowning in acid

(since drowning results from a lack of oxygen), being deaf-

ened by a sonic attack, or becoming encased in ice.

The effect of this spell does not stack with similar effects,

such  as  resist  energy and protection  from  energy, that  protect

against the same energy type. If a character is warded with

energy immunity (fire) and is also receiving resistance to fire

from one or more of the other spells, the energy immunity

makes the other spells irrelevant. However, it is possible to

be simultaneously under the effect of energy immunity (fire)

and resist energy (electricity), or any other two such spells that

protect against different types of energy.

You enchant a creature so that it feels suddenly compelled

to give you what it is holding when you cast this spell. On

the creatures next action, it moves as close to you as it can

get in a single round and offers you the object as a standard

action. This spell allows you to act out of turn and accept

the gift if the creature reaches you to hand you the object

(assuming you have a free hand and can accept it). The sub-

ject defends itself normally and acts as it wishes on subse-

quent rounds, including attempting to get the object back

if  desired.  If  the  subject  is  prevented  from  doing  as  the

spell compels, the spell is wasted. For example, if the sub-

ject is paralyzed and cannot move or drop the item, noth-

ing happens.

Dragons  cannot  see,  hear,  or  smell  the  warded  creatures,

even with blindsense. They act as though the warded crea-

tures are not there. Warded creatures could stand before the

hungriest  of  red  dragons  and  not  be  molested  or  even

noticed. If a warded character touches or attacks a dragon,

even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.

Material Component: A dragon scale.

As dominate monster (see page 224 of the Players Handbook),

except the subject is permanently dominated if it fails its ini-

tial Will save. A subject ordered to take an action against its

nature receives a Will save with a 4 penalty to resist taking

that particular action. If the save succeeds, the subject still

remains your thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject

makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it

makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific

action without a penalty.

This  spell  reduces  the  subjects  spell  resistance  by  1  per

equal to your caster level.

Misers Envy

Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]

Level: Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 3

Components: V, S, M

Casting Time: 1 standard action

Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Target: One living creature and one object (see text)

Duration: 1 round/level

Saving Throw: Will negates and None (object)

Spell Resistance: Yes and No (object)

When you cast this spell, you designate a target creature and

a  target  object,  both  of  which  must  be  within  the  spells

range. If the target creature fails its saving throw, it becomes

consumed by a powerful desire for the object. For the dura-

tion of the spell, the creature seeks to obtain the object (going

so far as to attack anyone holding or wearing it).

Once the creature gains possession of the object, it pro-

tects  the  item  greedily,  attacking  anyone  who  approaches

within 30 feet or who otherwise appears to be trying to take

the object away.

An invisible force, not unlike an unseen servant, comes into

being where the caster wishes. On the casters turn, this force

steals objects from others as she inaudibly directs it to (a free

action). A phantasmal thief can only steal from creatures. It

cannot break into locked chests or steal unattended objects.

A phantasmal thief has a Hide modifier of +20 (useful against

those who can see invisible creatures) and a Move Silently

modifier of +20.

If  a  phantasmal  thief goes  undetected,  it  can  steal  any

object  a  creature  possesses  but  is  not  holding  or  wearing.

Even objects in a bag of holding can be stolen. It can only steal

objects, bring objects to the caster, or put them back where

they came from. It can take no other actions. A phantasmal

thief needs 1 round to steal an object and another round to

bring it to the caster.

A phantasmal thief can only hold one object at a time, and

the object becomes invisible in its grasp.

The  thief  cannot  take  an  item  if  it  is  detected  by  the

creature  its  trying  to  steal  from  (with  a  Listen  or  Spot

check). However, the thief can repeat the attempt in the

next round. It cannot be harmed in any way, although it

can be dispelled.

A phantasmal  thief can  steal  an  object  from  a  creatures

hand by making a successful disarm attempt. It does this as

if it had the Improved Disarm feat and a +20 Strength mod-

ifier. If a phantasmal thief is used in this way, it disappears

after it brings the stolen object to the caster.

Dragons, due to their greedy nature, take a 4 penalty on

speak and understand (but not read) Draconic.

At  any  time  before  the  spells  duration  expires,  you  can

use  a  standard  action  to  target  a  creature  with  a  suggestion

effect, which functions identically to the spell of that name

(including  range,  duration,  and  other  effects).  Doing  this

causes the voice of the dragon spell to end, though the sugges-

tion itself lasts for the normal duration thereafter.

DRAGONHIDE ARMOR

Armorsmiths can work with dragon hides to produce master-

work armor or shields for the normal cost (see Special Mate-

rials, page 283 of the Dungeon Masters Guide). The armor

created has no special properties other than its masterwork

quality. (An armorsmith who also has the Dragoncrafter feat

can imbue even greater powers into the armor created; see

Dragoncraft Items, below.)

Table 32: Dragonhide Armor shows the types and sizes

of armor a dragons body can supply. The terms on the table

are defined below.

Armor Type and Size: These four columns show which kinds

of armor can be made from dragonhide, and the largest size a

single set of armor can be if made from a dragon of a certain

size. For example, a Medium dragons hide is large enough to

make one suit of hide armor for a Small creature, or one suit

of banded mail for a Tiny creature.

A single hide can yield more than one set of armor if the

armor is sized for creatures smaller than the size given on

the  table.  For  each  size  category  of  the  finished  armor

smaller than the size given on the table, double the number

of sets of armor can be made. For instance, when making

armor, thirty-two suits of Diminutive armor, or sixty-four

suits of Fine armor.

Shield?: A Yes entry in this column indicates that enough

hide is left over after the armorsmithing process to create

one heavy or light shield or a buckler sized for a character

the same size as the dragon. An armorsmith can choose to

make shields instead of armor out of all or part of a dragons

hide. Creating a tower shield uses up as much hide as a suit

of  hide  armor.  Creating  two  heavy  shields  or  two  light

shields  or  two  bucklers  uses  up  as  much  hide  as  a  suit  of

hide armor.

Special Properties of Dragonhide Armor: Many char-

acters favor dragonhide armor simply because it looks good.

In combat, dragonhide armor isnt any better than normal

armor; however, the armor itself remains immune to energy

damage of the same type as the breath weapon of the dragon

that supplied the hide. For example, red dragon armor is

impervious  to  fire. The  character  wearing  the  armor  does

not benefit from this property.

DRAGONCRAFT ITEMS

Dragoncraft items are nonmagical objects made from spe-

cific parts of a true dragons body. Only a character with the

Dragoncrafter  feat  (see  page  105)  can  create  dragoncraft

items. They derive special powers from their origin, as well

as from the skill of the person crafting them.

Creating a dragoncraft item is much like creating a master-

work weapon or similar item. In addition to the item itself

(which may also include a masterwork component, if it is a

weapon, shield, or suit of armor), the character must create

the dragoncraft component.

A dragoncraft component has a price that varies based on

the  specific  item  (see  item  descriptions  below). The  Craft

DC for creating a dragoncraft component is 25. Only after

all components of a dragoncraft item are completed is the

item considered finished.

Since dragoncraft items arent magical, they dont lose

their powers in an antimagic field or similar area. For those

effects that require a caster level, treat the caster level as

3rd or the lowest level possible to cast the spell in ques-

tion, whichever is higher. The powers of dragoncraft items

dont stack with similar or identical effects, as noted in the

specific item descriptions below. You can add magical qual-

ities to a dragoncraft item (including enhancement bonuses

for items such as weapons and armor) at the normal price,

but only if you possess the Dragoncrafter feat (in addition to

any other prerequisites).

Several dragoncraft items are described below. The descrip-

tion of each item gives a dragoncraft price, dragon part, and

skill, as defined here.

Dragoncraft Price: This is the price of the dragoncraft com-

ponent. Add the price of the item itself, as well as the price

for masterwork quality (for armor, shields, and weapons), to

find the items full price.

Dragon  Part: The  portion  of  a  dragons  body  required  to

create the dragoncraft item. The cost of this part is included

in the dragoncraft price. On average, the part has a value of

approximately  one-third  of  the  dragoncraft  price,  since  it

represents the raw materials needed for the item. If the char-

acter  crafting  the  item  supplies  the  part  himself  (perhaps

from a dragon he has slain), reduce the dragoncraft price for

this item by one-third.

Skill: The Craft skill needed to create the dragoncraft com-

ponent.

Dragoncraft Item Descriptions

Blood Elixir: A blood elixir is a concoction brewed from

the concentrated blood of a true dragon. A blood elixir grants

the drinker a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength (if brewed

from a chromatic dragon) or Charisma (if brewed from a

metallic dragon), as well as an additional effect as noted on

Dragoncraft Price: see above; Dragon Part: dragon blood (1

gallon); Skill: Craft (alchemy); Weight: 1/2 lb.

Dragonbone Bow: A bow carved from a single bone of a

dragon (a thigh bone or similarly large bone) displays supe-

rior tensile strength and power. Such a bow is considered a

composite bow (short or long) with a strength rating set by

the crafter. In addition, the bows range increment is 20 feet

longer  than  normal  for  the  bows  type  (90  feet  for  a  com-

posite shortbow or 130 feet for a composite longbow).

Dragoncraft Price: as composite bow +100 gp; Dragon Part:

dragon bone; Skill: Craft (bowyer); Weight: 3 lb.

Dragoncraft Armor or Shield: Dragoncraft armor and

shields  are  masterwork  versions  of  armor  and  shields

crafted from a dragons hide that also grant energy resist-

ance. A suit of dragoncraft armor or a dragoncraft shield

grants  the  wearer  resistance  5  against  a  specific  type  of

energy, as appropriate to the dragon (acid for black, copper,

or  green;  cold  for  silver  or  white;  electricity  for  blue  or

bronze; fire for brass, gold, or red). This resistance is treated

as an extraordinary (and thus nonmagical) feature of the

armor. It doesnt stack with any other energy resistance (of

the same type) possessed by the character.

In addition, dragoncraft armor is treated as one category

lighter for purposes of movement and other determinations.

Heavy  dragoncraft  armors  are  treated  as  medium,  and

medium and light armors are treated as light. Armor check

penalties are reduced by 2 (including the 1-point reduction

for masterwork armor or shield). Dragoncraft armor has the

normal maximum Dexterity bonus.

Dragoncraft armor can be hide armor, scale mail, half-

plate, or full plate armor. Dragoncraft shields can be light

or heavy.

Dragoncraft Price: 3,000 gp (light armor); 6,000 gp (medium

armor), 11,000 gp (heavy armor); Dragon Part: dragon hide;

Skill: Craft (armorsmithing); Weight: same as ordinary armor

or shield.

Dragonfang Weapon: Dragonfang weapons are master-

work weapons crafted from the claws and teeth of a dragon.

In addition to the +1 nonmagical enhancement bonus on

attack rolls granted by its masterwork quality, a dragonfang

weapon deals 1 point of energy damage on each successful

hit. The type of energy is the same as that of the dragons

breath weapon. If a dragon doesnt have a breath weapon

that  deals  acid,  cold,  electricity,  fire,  or  sonic  damage,

dragonfang weapons made from its remains do not deal any

extra damage. This damage is treated as an extraordinary

(and  thus  nonmagical)  feature  of  the  weapon.  It  doesnt

stack with any other energy damage (of the same type) dealt

by the weapon.

A single tooth or claw from a dragon can be crafted into a

light weapon of the same size category as the dragon, a one-

handed weapon of one size category smaller, or a two-handed

weapon of two size categories smaller. A single dragons body

can provide enough material for up to twelve weapons.

Only  piercing  and  slashing  weapons  may  be  created  as

Dragoncraft Price: 300 gp; Dragon Part: dragon tooth or claw;

Skill: Craft (weaponsmithing); Weight: 2 lb.

Dragonhide  Mantle: A  dragons  hide  can  be  rendered

flexible  enough  to  wear  as  a  cloak.  Crafting  a  dragonhide

mantle requires as much hide as a suit of hide armor, and the

mantle must be created to fit the wearers size.

A dragonhide mantle grants the wearer resistance 5 against

a specific type of energy, as appropriate to the dragon (acid

for black, copper, or green; cold for silver or white; elec-

tricity for blue or bronze; fire for brass, gold, or red). This

resistance  is  treated  as  an  extraordinary  (and  thus  non-

magical)  feature  of  the  mantle.  It  doesnt  stack  with  any

other  energy  resistance  (of  the  same  type)  possessed  by

the character.

In addition, the wearer of a dragonhide mantle gains a +2

circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against dragons.

Dragoncraft Price: 3,800 gp; Dragon Part: dragon hide; Skill:

Craft (leatherworking); Weight: same as ordinary hide armor

of appropriate size.

MAGIC ITEMS

The magic items introduced here are separated into armor,

weapons, rings, rods, staffs, wondrous items, and artifacts,

and presented alphabetically within each category.

ARMOR

Armor of Dragonshape: This suit of +3 dragoncraft hide

armor grants its wearer resistance 5 against a specific type of

energy,  as  appropriate  to  the  dragon  from  whose  scales  it

was crafted (acid for black, copper, or green; cold for

silver  or  white;  electricity  for  blue  or  bronze;  or

fire for brass, gold, or red). This resistance is treated

as an extraordinary (and thus nonmagical) feature

of the armor.

If the wearer has the wild shape

ability,  she  may  change  into  a

Small or Medium dragon of the

same  color  as  the  armor  once

per day, and may remain in that

form  for  up  to  7  hours.  This

change doesnt count against the

characters normal limit of daily

wild shape uses.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL

7th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor,

Dragoncrafter, wild shape ability; Price 23,165

gp; Cost 14,665 gp + 680 XP; Weight 25 lb.

Armor of Mobility: This suit of +2 leather armor

grants  its  wearer  the  Mobility  feat,  even  if  he

doesnt have the prerequisites.

Faint  transmutation;  CL  5th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, cats grace; Price 16,160 gp; Cost 8,160 gp + 320 XP;

+1 tower shield can command it to radiate an antimagic field.

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  11th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, antimagic field; Price 27,580 gp; Cost 14,380 gp + 575

XP; Weight 65 lb.

Dragondodger  Armor: This  suit  of  +3  studded  leather

armor grants its wearer the evasion ability, but only against

breath  weapons.  (When  a  breath  weapon  would  normally

allow a Reflex save for half damage, the wearer of the armor

takes no damage on a successful save.)

Moderate  abjuration;  CL  9th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and

Armor, aura of evasion; Price 15,675 gp; Cost 7,925 gp + 620

XP; Weight 20 lb.

Dragonrider  Armor: This  suit  of  +1  full  plate  armor is

crafted  from  the  cast-off  scales  of  a  dragon  (rather  than

those harvested from a slain dragon). It grants resistance 10

to form of energy associated with the dragon from whose

scales it is created (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, as appropri-

ate). It also grants its wearer a +5 bonus on Ride checks

whenever  riding  a  dragon,  and  activates  a  feather  fall spell

whenever the rider falls more than 5 feet.

Faint  abjuration;  CL  3rd;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Armor,

feather  fall; Price  26,150  gp;  Cost  13,400  gp  +  1,000  XP;

Weight 50 lb.

WEAPONS

Blade of Dragondoom: The wielder of this +3 greatsword

may, as a free action, choose to deliver a smite attack upon a

dragon.  For  every  size  category  of  the  dragon  larger  than

Medium, the smite attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage

(+1d6  against  a  Large  creature,  +2d6  against  Huge,  +3d6

against  Gargantuan,  and  +4d6  against  Colossal).  The  smite

function may be used three times per day, but no

more  than  once  per  round.  The  wielder

must  declare  the  use  of  the  smite

before the attack is made, and if the

attack misses, the smite is wasted.

Moderate  transmutation;  CL

7th;  Craft  Magic  Arms  and  Ar-

mor,  fell  the  greatest  foe; Price

34,350 gp; Cost 17,305 gp + 1,360 XP;

Weight 15 lb.

Bow  of  the  Mighty  Dragon-

hunter: This +2 dragon bane composite

longbow (+4 Str bonus) is carved from

the  thigh  bone  of  a  Huge  or  larger

dragon  (and  is  thus  considered  a

dragonbone bow; see Dragoncraft Items,

above).  If  an  arrow  fired  from  this  bow

hits a dragon, the dragon takes 1 point of

Strength damage. Furthermore, any critical

hit inflicted on a dragon by an arrow fired

from  this  bow  deals  5  damage,  not  3

(this benefit doesnt stack with any qual-

ity that improves the critical multiplier

of a weapon). Thus, a critical hit deals normal arrow

damage 5 plus 5 points of Strength damage. (Other effects

related to threatening or confirming critical hits, such as the

keen edge or bless weapon spells, dont function if applied to

this bow or the arrows it fires.)

RINGS

Ring  of  Dragon  Friendship: This  ring  is

carved  to  look  like  a  dragon  coiled  around  the

wearers finger. The wearer gains a +5 enhance-

ment bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influ-

ence  the  attitude  of  dragons.  No  dragon  will

voluntarily  attack  or  otherwise  attempt  to  harm

the wearer.

Once per month, the wearer can use a sugges-

tion effect on a dragon (heightened to 9th level;

Will DC 23 negates).

If  the  wearer  attacks  a  dragon  in  any  way

(including  by  the  use  of  the  rings  suggestion

power), this ring loses its powers for 24 hours.

(The suggestion effect can continue after the ring

stops working.)

Strong  enchantment;  CL  17th;  Forge  Ring,

Heighten Spell, dominate monster, suggestion; Price

28,750 gp.

Ring of Dragonshape: This ring is shaped like

a hollowed dragons claw. It is slipped over the

length of the wearers finger, but doesnt restrict manual dex-

terity in any way. Once per day, the wearer can activate the

ring (as a standard action) to polymorph into a young red

dragon (if the wearer is evil) or a young gold dragon (if the

wearer is good). This effect functions as the polymorph spell,

except  that  the  duration  is  1  hour. The  effect  can  be  dis-

missed by the wearer as a standard action.

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Forge Ring, polymorph;

Price 23,000 gp.

RODS

Rod of Dragon Mastery: This

scepter functions much like

a rod of rulership, though

it affects only drag-

ons. The wielder

can  command

the  obedience  and

fealty  of  dragons  within  500  feet

Ring of dragonshape

power

when she activates the device (a standard action). Dragons

totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but those with Intelli-

gence scores of 16 or higher are entitled to a DC 22 Will

save to negate the effect. Ruled dragons obey the wielder

as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder

gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the drag-

ons commanded, the magic is broken. A rod of dragon mas-

tery can be used for 500 minutes before it crumbles to dust.

This duration need not be continuous.

There are two versions of this powerful magic item. The

crimson rod of dragon mastery affects only evil and

neutral dragons, while the golden rod of dragon

mastery affects only good and neutral dragons.

Dracolich Phylactery: A dracolichs phylactery is crafted

from  a  solid,  inanimate  object  of  at  least  2,000  gp  value.

Gemstones, particularly ruby, pearl, carbuncle, and jet, are

commonly used for the phylactery, since they must be able

to resist decay.

When a dracolich first dies, and any time its physical form

is destroyed thereafter, its spirit instantly retreats to its phy-

lactery regardless of the distance between that and its body. A

dim light within the phylactery indicates the presence of the

spirit. While so contained, the spirit cannot take any actions

except to possess a suitable corpse; it cannot be

contacted  or  attacked  by  magic.  The  spirit  can

remain  in  the  phylactery  indefinitely.

See the dracolich entry, page 146, for

more information.

Dragonfang  Gauntlets: These

gauntlets. They grant a +4 enhancement

times  per  day,  the  character  may  use  the

gauntlets to attack a weapon or shield as if she had

the  Improved  Sunder  feat  (even  if  she  doesnt  have  the

prerequisites).

When worn by a character with the Improved Unarmed

Strike feat, dragonfang gauntlets allow the wearer to overcome

damage  reduction  with  unarmed  strikes  as  if  she  were

wielding a magic weapon. In this case, the wielder deals her

normal unarmed strike damage, rather than the damage for

spiked gauntlets.

Goggles of Draconic Vision: The wearer of these gog-

gles gains a +10 bonus

enjoys  low-light  vision

and  60-foot  darkvision.

Once  per  day,  the  wearer

can command the goggles

to  grant  him  blindsense

for 1 minute.

The goggles also protect the wearer from being blinded

by  the  cloud  created  by  a  hovering  dragon  (though  the

cloud still provides concealment for all within it).

Golem Manual: A golem manual contains information,

incantations, and magical power that help a character to

craft  a  golem  (see  page  134  of  the  Monster  Manual). The

instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill

checks made to craft the golems body. Each manual also

holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem

and effectively grants the builder use of the Craft Con-

struct feat (see page 303 of the Monster Manual) during

the construction of the golem, and grants the charac-

ter an increase to her caster level for the pur-

pose  of  crafting  a  golem.  Any  golem  built

using a golem manual does not cost the creator

any XP, since the requisite XP are contained in

the  book  and  expended  by  the  book  during  the

creation process.

The spells included in a golem manual require a

spell trigger activation and can be activated only

to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost

of  the  book  does  not  include  the  cost  of  con-

structing the golems body. Once the golem is

finished,  the  writing  in  the  manual  fades  and

the book is consumed in flames. When the books

ashes  are  sprinkled  upon  the  golem,  it  becomes

fully animated.

Dragonbone Golem Manual: This book contains ani-

mate dead, cause fear, and geas/quest. The reader may

treat her caster level as one level higher than normal

for the purpose of crafting a dragonbone golem. The

book  supplies  4,400  XP  for  the  creation  of  a

Horn of Dragons: This horn bears intricate carvings of

dragons  in  flight. When  blown  (a  full-round  action),  the

horn summons an adult dragon 1 round later, to a location

up  to  100  feet  away. The  dragon  remains  for  1  hour  and

serves the user of the horn to the best of its ability. At the

end of the duration, or if the dragon is slain or dispelled,

the dragon disappears. The type of dragon depends on the

users  alignment  (see  the  table  below). The  horn  may  be

blown once per month.

Idol of the Dragon: Much like a

figurine  of  wondrous  power, an idol  of

the  dragon is  a  miniature  statuette

(about  2  inches  long)  resembling  a

particular  variety  of  dragon.  The

color and kind of the dragon is very

apparent,  even  at  a  glance,  due  to

the  craftsmanship  involved.  The

idol  grants  energy  resistance  (5  or

10)  of  the  appropriate  type  to  its

owner while carried (but not while

the idol is in dragon form).

Once per week, when the idol is

tossed  into  the  air  and  the  proper

command word spoken, it becomes

a full-size dragon of the appropriate

age (see the table below). The dragon

is a living creature, not a construct,

and has all the abilities and powers

of an average dragon of its age. The

dragon obeys and serves its owner for

up to 1 hour. At the end of this duration,

or  if  it  is  prematurely  dismissed  by  its  owner,  the  dragon

MINOR ARTIFACT

Draco  Mystere: This  tome,

known as Mysteries of the Dragon

in Common, is a legendary book of

lore  regarding  dragonkind.  Some

claim  it  was  written  by  the  first

high  priest  of  the  Cult  of  Ashar-

dalon,  but  others  call  this  asser-

tion nothing  but  an  idle  boast,

believing  the  book  to  be  far  older

than that. Over the centuries, it has

been  studied,  copied,  lost,  and

found again by dozens if not hun-

dreds  of  readers.  Many  lesser  ver-

sions  of  this  book  are  known  to

exist, but none share

its power.

8-hour days of study. If the reader misses even

a  single  day  during  this  time,  he  must  start

again from the beginning. Completion of the

study gives the reader a +5 inherent bonus

on Knowledge (arcana) checks regarding

dragons. The reader also gains low-light

vision (if the character already has low-

light vision, the effect is increased by one

multiple, such as from double to triple)

and immunity to magic sleep and paraly-

sis effects.

In addition, a sorcerer who reads

Draco  Mystere gains  1  point  of  Cha-

risma and sufficient XP to place him

halfway  into  the  next  experience

level  (which  must  be  used  to  in-

crease  his  sorcerer  level).  Other

characters who peruse the book

do  not  receive  these  benefits.

Any  individual  can  only

receive  the  tomes  benefits

once in a lifetime.

PRESTIGE CLASSES

Each  of  the  new  prestige  classes  described

here draws power, inspiration, or both from

draconic sources.

Dracolytes often congregate with others who

share their respect and faith, including members

of many of the other prestige classes presented here.

They  are  outcasts  in  most  cultures,  except  those

that have innate respect for dragonkind (such as

kobolds, lizardfolk, and troglodytes).

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To  qualify  to  become  a  dracolyte,  a  character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Race: Any nondragon.

Feats: Dragonfriend, Toughness.

Skills: Concentration 8 ranks, Diplo-

macy  4  ranks,  Knowledge  (arcana)  4

ranks, Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks.

Languages: Draconic.

Spellcasting: Able to cast 2nd-

level divine spells.

Class Skills

The  dracolytes  class  skills  (and

the key ability for each skill) are

Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con),

Diplomacy  (Cha),  Heal  (Wis),  Jump

(Str),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowledge

(religion) (Int), and Spellcraft (Int). See Chap-

ter  4:  Skills  in  the  Players  Handbook for  skill

descriptions.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level: 2  +  Int

modifier.

DRACOLYTE

Only  a  few  rare  nondragons  take

up  worship  of  the  draconic  gods.

The dracolyte is the most dedicated of these

rare individuals, a divine spellcaster who devotes his energy

and support to the deities of dragonkind. As a dracolyte

gains  power  and  prestige,  he  receives  abilities  associated

with the dragons themselves.

Clerics  and  druids  are  the  most  likely  to  become  dra-

colytes. Some paladins and rangers, particularly those with

metallic dragon allies, enter this prestige class. Most mem-

bers of other classes dont have the religious bent to pursue

this path.

Class Features

All  of  the  following  are  class

features of the dracolyte pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A dracolyte gains no

proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Spellcasting: When a new dracolyte level is gained, the

character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a

level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before he

added  the  prestige  class.  He  does  not,  however,  gain  any

other  benefit  a  character  of  that  class  would  have  gained

(improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, and so

on). This essentially means that the character adds the level

of dracolyte to the level of whatever divine spellcasting class

the character has, then determines spells per day and caster

level accordingly.

If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class

before he became a dracolyte, he must decide to which class

he adds each level of dracolyte for the purpose of determin-

ing spells per day.

Prestige Domain (Ex): At 1st level, a dracolyte gains

access to a prestige domain based on his alignment. Good-

aligned dracolytes (and neutral clerics who channel pos-

itive  energy)  gain  access  to  the  Glory  prestige  domain

(and  its  granted  power),  while  evil-aligned  dracolytes

(and  neutral  clerics  who  channel  negative  energy)  gain

access  to  the  Domination  prestige  domain  (and  its

granted power). Dracolytes who are neither good nor evil

(and who dont channel positive or negative energy) can

select either of these domains, but once made, the choice

can never be altered.

The spells associated with the prestige

domain  can  be  selected  to  fill  any  do-

main  spell  slots  the  dracolyte  has

available. If the prestige domain is the

characters  only  domain,  he  gains

the ability to cast a do-

main  spell  of  each

spell level to which he

has  access  once  per  day,

in addition to those spells

he already casts.

Prestige  domains  are

presented and explained in

the  Cleric  Domains  section,

beginning on page 107.

Alertness: At  3rd  level,  a  dra-

colyte  gains  Alertness  as  a  bonus

feat.

Foster  Dragon: At  5th  level,  a

dracolyte  is  entrusted  with  the  care  of  a

wyrmling dragon. The kind of dragon is up to

the  DM,  but  the  dragons  alignment  should

match the dracolytes. The wyrmling dragon fol-

lows the dracolyte loyally, and will even accom-

pany  him  on  adventures  (though  it  receives  no

XP and cant attain new levels).

If the wyrmling dies, the dracolyte cannot gain

any  additional  dracolyte  levels  until  he

receives an atonement spell from another

dracolyte or a cleric who worships a dra-

conic deity.

Immunities  (Ex): A  7th-level  draco-

lyte  gains  immunity  to  magic  sleep  and

paralysis effects.

Keen Senses (Ex): At 9th level, a dra-

colyte gains darkvision out to 60 feet and low-light

vision.

Summon  Dragon (Sp): A  10th-level  dracolyte  can,  as  a

full-round  action,  summon  a  dragon  once  per  day.  This

ability is similar to a summon monster spell, except that the

dracolyte summons an adult dragon of the same kind as the

wyrmling dragon entrusted to his care (see above). The sum-

moned dragon remains for 10 rounds and follows the dra-

colytes commands.

DRAGONKITH

Dragonkith are creatures that serve and aid dragons. They

live with or near a dragon or a group of dragons, acting as

servants or peers (depending on the individual dragon and

the dragonkith). In return for service, over time, the dragon

bestows  upon  a  dragonkith  special  abilitiesand  even

physical  changesusing  complex  rituals  known  only  to

their kind.

Although  sometimes  they  are  humans,  elves,  dwarves,

halflings,  or  gnomes,  dragonkith  are  just  as  often  mem-

bers of other intelligent species, such as lizardfolk, giants,

troglodytes,  lammasu,  pseudodragons,  titans,  dragonnes,

beholders,  lamias,  and  otherseven,  rarely,

other  dragons.  Thus,  dragonkith  are  a

diverse group; no one class is more likely

than  another  to  become  one,  and  many

dragonkith  do  not

have  classes  at  all

(they are monsters).

NPC  dragonkith

are usually found in the

company of their dragon

companion.  Sometimes

they  are  alone,  completing

some  errand  for  the  dragon.

Occasionally they work in small,

tight-knit groups of dragonkith,

all  pledged  either  to  the  same

dragon or to allied dragons.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a dragonkith, a character

must fulfill all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +6.

Feats: Alertness, Endurance.

Skills: Knowledge  (arcana)  4  ranks.

Language: Draconic.

Special: Must be chosen by a dragon

of the same alignment. If a dragonkith

ever  ceases  its  relationship  with  the

dragon, or the dragon dies, the char-

acter loses all special abilities gained

from this prestige class.

All of the following are class features of the dragonkith pres-

tige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A dragonkith gains no

proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Scales  (Ex):  A  dragonkith,  over  time,  develops  crusty

scales the same color as her dragon companion. At 1st level,

this  protection  adds  +1  to  the  natural  armor  bonus  of  the

dragonkith,  and  its  natural  armor  bonus  improves  by  an

additional +1 every three levels. If the dragonkith already

has natural armor as an aspect of its creature kind (and not

from a spell or magic item), this bonus stacks with its exist-

ing natural armor bonus.

Telepathic  Plea  (Su): Wherever  a  dragonkith  is,  its

dragon  companion  can  send  an  instantaneous,  telepathic

plea for help at any time. No details are provided in the mes-

sage, other than that the dragon is in danger. This commu-

nication does not work both ways (the dragonkith cannot

alert the dragon).

Mighty Attack (Su): At 2nd level, once per day, a dragon-

kith can call upon its dragons might to deal an extra 1d6

points of damage on a single attack. The dragonkith must

decide before an attack is resolved whether it will use this

power. If the attack misses, that use of the mighty attack

is wasted. For every three levels beyond 2nd, the damage

increases by another 1d6.

Detect  Treasure (Sp): Once  per  day,  a  dragonkith  of  3rd

level or higher can use a detect treasure ability. This works

like the detect magic spell, except that it senses Medium or

smaller objects that are worth more than 100 gp. On the first

round, the dragonkith detects the presence of such objects;

on  the  second  round,  the  power  reveals  the  number  of

objects and the location of each. In each subsequent round,

the dragonkith can make an Appraise check to estimate the

value of one object.

Energy Resistance (Su): A dragonkith develops an ever

stronger resistance to the energy associated with its dragon

companions breath weapon. Beginning at 3rd level, it can

ignore  some  damage  of  the  type  generated  by  its  dragon

companions breath weapon. This ability applies to sources

of the energy type other than the dragon companions breath

weapon. Thus, a dragonkith with a red dragon companion

gains resistance to fire 5 at 3rd level, effective against fire

from any source. This resistance improves to 10 at 7th level

and to 15 at 9th level. In the case of dragons with multiple

breath weapons, the dragonkith gains resistance to one type

of damaging breath.

Telepathic Link (Su): At 4th level, a dragonkith develops

a  telepathic  link  with  its  companion  dragon  out  to  a  dis-

tance of up to 1 mile. The dragonkith and dragon can com-

municate  telepathically.  Because  of  this  link,  one  has  the

same connection to an item or place that the other does. For

instance, if the dragonkith has seen a room, its dragon com-

panion can teleport into that room as if she had seen it too.

Sorcerous Knack (Sp): At 6th level, a dragonkith acquires

the ability to cast a single arcane spell once per day as a sor-

cerer of its class level. The dragonkith must choose a spell

known  to  its  dragon  companion,  and  it  must  have  a  Cha-

risma score of at least 10 + the spells level to use the spell by

means of the sorcerous knack ability. Once the spell is chosen,

that decision can never be changed.

Share  Spells  (Su): At  either  the  dragons  or  the  dragon-

kiths option, any spell one casts on itself also affects the other.

The two must be touching at the time. If the spell has a dura-

tion other than instantaneous, the spell stops affecting them

if  they  move  farther  than  100  feet  apart. The  spells  effect

will not be restored even if they return to each other before

the duration would otherwise have ended. The dragon and

dragonkith can share spells even if the spells normally do

not affect creatures of their respective types.

DRAGONRIDER

Some dream of soaring through the clouds atop a mighty

draconic steed, feeling the wind on their faces, afraid of

nothing.  The  dragonrider  doesnt  simply  dream  of  this

lifehe leads it.

Characters  of  all  classes  may  become  dragonriders,

though the most common are barbarians, fighters, paladins,

and  rangers.  Other  characters  looking  to  follow  this  path

often pick up a level of one of these classes first, to gain the

riding talent necessary.

An NPC dragonrider might be encountered as a solitary

ally of a family of dragons or as part of a larger fighting force,

perhaps  affiliated  with  a  kingdom  or  city-state  that  uses

dragons as part of its defenses.

Hit Die: d10.

any  Ride  checks  made  in  conjunc-

tion with riding a dragon.

In addition, any dragon ridden by

a dragonrider enjoys maneuverabil-

ity).  For  instance,  an  adult  green

dragon with a dragonrider astride it

has average maneuverability rather

than poor.

DRAGONSLAYER

They  come  from  all  walks  of

Characters of any class may pursue

their spellcasting ability while gain-

ing  new  powers  suitable  for  use  in

battling dragons. Even bards, monks,

rangers, and rogues have much to

gain from this class, though the

dragonstalker class (see below)

is often more their style. Multi-

class characters, such as fighter/

sorcerers or barbarian/clerics, can make particu-

larly good dragonslayers, bringing a variety of tal-

ents to the task.

NPC dragonslayers have few close associates who arent as

skilled  as  they  are  in  the  art  of  battling  dragons.  Unless  a

dragonslayer  can  trust  you  with  his  life,  he  isnt  likely  to

spend much time in your company. This attitude can lead

See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook

for skill descriptions.

Skill  Points  at  Each  Level: 2  +  Int

modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of

the dragonslayer prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency:

A  dragonslayer  gains  proficiency

with  all  simple  and  martial  weap-

ons, with all types of armor, and

with shields and tower shields.

Spellcasting: Each  time  a

character  attains  an  odd-

numbered  dragonslayer

level, the character gains

new  spells  per  day  and

spells known as if he had

also  gained  a  level  in  a

spellcasting class he belonged

to before he added the prestige

class. He does not, however, gain any other

benefit a character of that class would have gained

(improved  chance  of  controlling  or  rebuking  undead,

metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essen-

tially means that the character adds the level of dragon-

slayer  to  the  level  of  whatever  spellcasting  class  the

character  has,  then  determines  spells  per  day  and  caster

level accordingly.

If a character takes one or more levels in this class before

having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive

this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels

in  one  or  more  spellcasting  classes,  he  becomes

eligible  to  receive  the  spellcasting  benefit  for  any

level in the dragonslayer class that he has not already

attained.  For  example,  a  5th-level  fighter/1st-level

dragonslayer does not receive the spellcasting benefit

for being a 1st-level dragonslayer because he did not

belong to a spellcasting class before taking a level in

the prestige class. If he then picks up one or

more levels of wizard before advancing

to 3rd level in the dragonslayer class,

he receives the spellcasting benefit of a

3rd-level dragonslayer (when he attains

that level) but does not receive the 1st-

level benefit retroactively.

Aura of Courage (Su): At 1st level, a

dragonslayer  gains  immunity  to  fear

(magical  or  otherwise).  Allies  within

10  feet  of  the  dragonslayer  gain  a  +4

morale bonus on saving throws against

fear effects.

Damage  Bonus  (Ex): A  dragon-

slayer gains a bonus on weapon dam-

age  rolls  against  dragons  equal  to  his

class level.

Overcome  Draconic  Spell  Resis-

tance  (Ex): Beginning  at  2nd  level,  a

dragonslayer  may  add  his  class

level  to  any  caster  level  checks

made  to  overcome  a  dragons

spell resistance.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At

3rd  level,  a  dragonslayer  gains

damage  reduction  1/.  This  im-

proves to damage reduction 2/ at

6th  level,  and  to  damage  reduction

3/ at 9th level.

Energy  Resistance  (Su): At  5th  level,  a  dragonslayer

gains resistance to acid 5, cold 5, electricity 5, fire 5, and

sonic 5. These resistances improve to 10 at 10th level. These

resistances dont stack with any other similar effects.

Class Features

DRAGONSONG LYRIST

The dragonsong lyrist taps into the power of dragonsong,

an  ancient  form  of  performance  that  originated  among

the draconic races, to create strange and wondrous magi-

cal effects.

Many  bards  become  dragonsong  lyrists,  though  rogues

and even a few monks have been known to pursue the class.

Multiclass barbarian/bards and sorcerer/rogues also make

good dragonsong lyrists.

Dragonsong lyrists are usually loners, though they occa-

sionally congregate to share new songs or poems. They get

along well with bards and sorcerers, and some occupy posi-

tions of great respect in barbarian tribes.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements

To qualify to become a dragonsong lyrist, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonevil.

Feat: Dragonsong.

Skills: Concentration 5 ranks, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Knowl-

edge (arcana) 5 ranks, Perform (oratory or

sing) 10 ranks.

Languages: Dra-

conic.

All  of  the  following  are  class  features  of  the  dragonsong

lyrist prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  dragonsong  lyrist

gains no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.

Greater Dragonsong (Su): Once per day per class level,

a  dragonsong  lyrist  can  use  song  or  poetics  to  invoke  the

power of dragonsong. Invoking dragonsong requires a stan-

dard action. In the case of effects that require a saving throw,

the DC is equal to 10 + lyrist class level + lyrists Cha modi-

fier. The bonus from the Dragonsong feat also applies to this

save DC.

In cases where the character continues a greater dragon-

song  effect  over  the  course  of  multiple  rounds  (such  as

song  of  strength),  the  dragonsong  lyrist  can  fight  while

using greater dragonsong but cannot cast spells, activate

magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or acti-

vate  magic  items  by  command  word  (such  as  wands).

Maintaining a greater dragonsong effect does not require

concentration.

A deaf dragonsong lyrist has a 20% chance to fail when

using  greater  dragonsong.  If  she  fails,  the  attempt  still

counts against her daily limit.

Song  of  Strength: A  1st-level  dragonsong

lyrist  can  imbue  herself  and  her  allies

with  great  physical  power.  The  dragon-

song lyrist and all allies within 30

feet who can hear her gain a +4

morale bonus to Strength for

the  duration  of  the  lyrists

performance  and  for

5  rounds  thereafter.

This  is  a  mind-

affecting  ability.

Song  of  Compul-

sion: At 2nd level,

a  dragonsong

lyrist can use

her greater dragon-

song to make a sugges-

tion to  a  single  creature

within 30 feet who can

hear  the  lyrist.  A  Will

save  negates  the  effect.

This is an enchantment (compulsion,

mind-affecting,  language-dependent

effect. Dragons take a 2 penalty on this

Song  of  Flight: A  3rd-level  dragonsong  lyrist  can

grant herself and her allies the ability to fly, as the spell

of  the  same  name.  This  song  affects  the  character  and  a

number  of  allies  equal  to  her  Charisma  modifier  (all  of

whom must be able to hear the lyrist) and lasts for 1 minute

per level. This is a transmutation effect.

Song of Fear: At 4th level, a dragonsong lyrist can use her

song  or  poetics  to  inspire  fear  in  her  foes.  All  enemies

within  a  radius  of  30  feet   class  level  are  subject  to  the

effect if they have fewer HD than the dragonsong lyrist. A

potentially  affected  creature  that  succeeds  on  a  Will  save

remains immune to that dragonsong lyrists frightful pres-

ence ability for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with fewer

than half the dragonsong lyrists HD become panicked for

2d6 rounds and those with HD equal to or greater than half

the  dragonsong  lyrists  become  shaken  for  2d6  rounds.

Dragons  are  immune  to  this  ability,  as  are  any  creatures

immune to fear. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Song  of  Healing: A  5th-level  dragonsong  lyrist  can  use

her greater dragonsong to heal herself and her allies. Each

ally  within  30  feet  who  can  hear  the  dragonsong  lyrist

regains  hit  points  and  ability  points  as  if  he  or  she  had

rested for a full day. No character may benefit from this

ability  more  than  once  per  hour.  This  is  a  conjuration

(healing) effect.

Spellcasting: Each time an even-numbered dragonsong

lyrist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day

and spells known as if she had also gained a level in a spell-

casting class she belonged to before she added the prestige

class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a char-

acter of that class would have gained (improved chance of

controlling  or  rebuking  undead,  metamagic  or  item  cre-

ation feats, and so on). This essentially means that the char-

acter  adds  1/2  her  dragonsong  lyrist  level  to  the  level  of

whatever spellcasting class she has, then determines spells

per day and caster level accordingly.

If  a  character  takes  two  or  more  levels  in  this  class

before having any levels in a spellcasting class, she does

not receive this spellcasting benefit. If she thereafter takes

levels in one or more spellcasting classes, she becomes eli-

gible to receive the spellcasting benefit for any level in the

dragonsong  lyrist  class  that  she  has  not  already  attained.

For example, a 6th-level monk/2nd-level dragonsong lyrist

does not receive the spellcasting benefit for being a 2nd-

level  dragonsong  lyrist  because  she  did  not  belong  to  a

spellcasting  class  before  taking  2nd  level  in  the  prestige

class.  If  she  then  picks  up  one  or  more  levels  of  wizard

before  advancing  to  4th  level  in  the  dragonsong  lyrist

class,  she  receives  the  spellcasting  benefit  of  a  4th-level

dragonsong  lyrist  (when  she  attains  that  level)  but  does

not receive the 2nd-level benefit retroactively.

DRAGONSTALKER

Dragonslayers? Pah, any fool can call himself a dragonslayer. Most

get themselves killed within a few days, which is probably for the

best. No, the real skill isnt in walking into the dragons cave and

challenging it to a duelits in tracking it across a hundred miles

of wilderness, sneaking up close and killing it before it even knows

youre there.

Deirdre Firewalker, dragonstalker

The dragonstalker prefers a much more subtle approach

than the dragonslayer. She uses stealth and guile to track her

prey,  striking  with  skill  and  uncanny  accuracy  when  the

time is right.

Rangers and rogues are the most common dragonstalkers,

since the two classes share a predilection for the subtlety

and patience the prestige class requires. Barbarians, particu-

larly those from dragon-terrorized areas, often take up this

class. Bards also make reasonable dragonstalkerscertainly,

the profession makes for many great tales told around the

fire. Most other classes are better off pursuing the path of

the dragonslayer (see page 125).

NPC  dragonstalkers  are  loners,  since  they  rarely  trust

others to hold their own in a hunt. When tracking a partic-

ularly formidable foe, a dragonstalker might recruit other

stealthy characters, such as rangers or rogues, for assistance.

Once or twice in a generation, a hunt of great significance

may arise that brings together a team of dragonstalkers from

various  backgrounds.  In  such  a  case,  the  dragon  has  little

chance of escaping.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a dragonstalker, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Blind-fight, Track.

Skills: Gather Information 4 ranks, Hide 6 ranks, Knowl-

edge (arcana) 4 ranks, Move Silently 6 ranks, Search 6 ranks.

Class Skills

The dragonstalkers class skills (and the key ability for each

skill)  are  Bluff  (Cha),  Climb  (Str),  Craft  (Wis),  Diplomacy

(Cha),  Disguise  (Cha),  Gather  Information  (Cha),  Hide

(Dex),  Jump  (Str),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Knowledge

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the dragonstalker

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A dragonstalker gains

proficiency with the longbow, longspear, net, shortbow, and

all simple weapons. Dragonstalkers are proficient with light

armor and with shields.

Hunting  Bonus  (Ex): Starting  at  1st  level,  a  dragon-

stalker gains a bonus equal to her class level on Bluff, Listen,

Search,  Sense  Motive,  and  Spot  checks  when  using  these

skills against dragons.

A dragonstalker

Sneak  Attack  (Dragon): Beginning  at  2nd  level,  if  a

dragonstalker catches a dragon when it is unable to defend

itself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot

for  extra  damage.  Basi-

cally, any time the dragon-

stalkers  target  would  be

denied its Dexterity bonus

to AC (whether it actually

has  a  Dexterity  bonus  or

not),  the  dragonstalkers

attack  deals  an  extra  2d6

points  of  damage.  This

extra  damage  increases  by

2d6  points  every  other  level

(4d6  at  4th  level,  6d6  at  6th

level,  and  so  on).  Should  the

dragonstalker  score  a  critical

hit  with  a  sneak  attack,  this

extra  damage  is  not  multiplied.

It  takes  precision  and  pene-

tration to hit a vital spot, so

ranged  attacks  can  only

count  as  sneak  attacks  if

the dragon is 30 feet away or less.

With a sap or an unarmed strike, a dragonstalker

can  make  a  sneak  attack  that  deals  nonlethal

damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot

use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal

nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even

with  the  usual  4  penalty,  because  she  must

make optimal use of her weapon to execute the

sneak attack.

A  dragonstalker  can  only  sneak  attack  living

dragons  with  discernible  anatomies.  Any  dragon

immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks.

Also, the dragonstalker must be able to see the target well

enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach a

vital spot. A dragonstalker cannot sneak attack while strik-

ing at a dragon with concealment or by striking the limbs of

a dragon whose vitals are beyond reach.

If a dragonstalker gets a sneak attack bonus from another

source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack

when the ability is used against dragons.

Ignore Natural Armor (Ex): Once per day, a dragonstalker

of  3rd  level  or  higher  can  ignore  a  targets  natural  armor

bonus (including any enhancement to that natural armor) for

one attack (melee or ranged). You must declare that you are

using this ability before you make the attack roll. At 7th level,

a dragonstalker can use this ability twice per day.

Hide Scent (Ex): At 5th level, a dragonstalker can use

the  Disguise  skill  to  hide  her  (or  someone  elses)

scent. This requires a Disguise check (with a 10

penalty) opposed by a Wisdom check made by

any creature attempting to use the scent abil-

ity to discover the dragonstalkers presence.

Hiding ones scent requires twice as long

as  a  typical  Disguise  check  (1d320

minutes),  and  the  effect  lasts  for  1

hour  per  class  level.  Magic  that

alters  your  form  doesnt  affect

this Disguise check.

Foil Blindsense (Su): Once

per day, a 9th-level dragonstalker

can  render  herself  completely

imperceptible  to  blindsense.

This  requires  a  standard  action,

and the effect lasts for 10 min-

utes. This ability has no effect

on other forms of vision (whether

mundane or magical). For instance,

it  doesnt  keep  someone  from

spotting or hearing the dragon-

stalker  with  normal  senses,  or

from  noticing  an  invisible

dragonstalker by means of a true

seeing spell.

level,  the  effective  enhance-

ment  bonus  of  any  weapon

wielded by a dragonstalker against a dragon is +2 better than

normal, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage

against dragons. This benefit stacks with the enhancement

bonus increase and bonus damage dice from a weapon with

the bane (dragons) special ability.

HOARDSTEALER

Dont call me a burglar. Burglars steal baubles and trinkets. If I

wanted trinkets, Id rob a dwarf. I want treasure.

Liam Boldfingers, halfling hoardstealer

The hoardstealer specializes in relieving wealthy individu-

als from large amounts of said wealth. In most cases, these

individuals are dragons, since few creatures keep so much

wealth in one place. Stealing a dragons hoard is a challeng-

ing task, to be sure, but if it were easy, it probably wouldnt

be worth doing.

Most hoardstealers are rogues, though some bards and

rangers can become hoardstealers with the right training.

Other classes may fancy themselves treasure-finders, but

they dont have the aptitudes to take up the art of hoard-

stealing.

By their very nature, most NPC hoardstealers work alone.

Some may recruit assistance for tough jobssuch as rogues

or other stealthy sortsbut a hoardstealer rarely sees such

hired help as anything but expendable assets. The smart

hoardstealer knows that he can only count on himself to get

the job doneeveryone else is just an amateur.

Hit Die: d6.

the hoardstealer must have an Intelligence score of at least

10 + the spells level, so a hoardstealer with an Intelligence

of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Hoardstealer bonus

spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against

these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the hoardstealers

Int modifier. When the hoardstealer gets 0 spells of a given

level  (for  instance,  1st-level  spells  for  a  1st-level  hoard-

stealer), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled

to based on his Intelligence score for that spell level. The

hoardstealers spell list appears below. A hoardstealer casts

spells just as a wizard does.

Darkvision (Su): At 1st level, a hoardstealer gains dark-

vision with a range of 30 feet, or the range of his existing

darkvision improves by 30 feet if he already has the ability.

At  5th  level  and  at  9th  level,  the  range  of  the  hoard-

stealers darkvision extends another 30 feet, to a maximum

of +90 feet at 9th level.

Trapfinding  (Ex): Like  a  rogue,  a  hoardstealer  can  use

the  Search  skill  to  locate  traps  when  the  task  has  a  DC

higher than 20. He may also use the Disable Device skill to

disarm a magic trap. A hoardstealer who beats a traps DC by

10  or  more  can  study  a  trap,  figure  out  how  it  works,  and

bypass it (with his party) without disarming it.

Hide  from  Dragons (Sp): A  2nd-level  hoardstealer  can

cast hide from dragons on himself once per day. This func-

tions as the spell of the same name (see page 113), except

that  it  only  affects  the  hoardstealer  and  lasts  for  only  1

round per level.

At 6th level, the hoardstealer may use this ability twice

per  day.  At  10th  level,  he  may  use  it  three  times  per  day.

Trap  Sense  (Ex): Starting  at  3rd  level,  a  hoardstealer

gains  an  intuitive  sense  that  alerts  him  to  danger  from

traps, giving him a +2 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid

traps and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps.

At 6th level these bonuses rise to +4, and at 9th level to +6.

These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from

other classes.

Deep Pockets (Su): Once per day, a 3rd-level hoardstealer

can turn any containerfrom a waistcoat pocket to a back-

pack to a barrelinto the equivalent of a bag of holding. The

containers weight remains the same, but it becomes capable

of holding up to 10 cubic feet (or 100 pounds) of material

per level. The duration of this effect is 1 hour per level. If the

effect ends prematurely (such as by being dispelled), every-

thing within the container spills out onto the floor.

Treasure Dowsing (Su): Once per day, a 4th-level hoard-

stealer  can  concentrate  (a  full-round  action)  to  detect  the

location  of  the  largest  mass  of  metal  or  minerals  within  a

range of 10 feet per level. If the hoardstealer concentrates

on a specific metal or mineral (such as gold or diamonds), he

detects the location of each such deposit within range. This

is otherwise identical to the effect of a rod of metal and min-

eral  detection (see  page  236  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide).

At 7th level, the hoardstealer may use this ability twice

per  day.  At  10th  level,  he  may  use  it  three  times  per  day.

Skill  Mastery  (Ex): At  8th  level,  a  hoardstealer  may

select a number of skills equal to 3 + his Int modifier. When

making  a  skill  check  with  one  of  these  skills,  the  hoard-

stealer may take 10 even if stress and distractions would nor-

mally prevent him from doing so. He becomes so certain in

his ability that he can use his skill reliably under adverse

conditions,  such  as  when  an  angry  dragon  pursues  him

down a tunnel.

Hoardstealer Spell List

Hoardstealers  choose  their  spells  from  the  following  list.

1st Level: detect magic, detect secret doors, expeditious retreat,

ghost  sound,  identify, Tensers  floating  disk,  Nystuls  magic  aura,

read magic, unseen servant.

2nd  Level:  cats  grace,  knock,  invisibility,  locate  object,  resist

energy, spider climb.

3rd  Level:  arcane  sight,  clairaudience/clairvoyance,  dispel

magic, protection from energy, shrink item.

4th Level: arcane eye, dimension door, freedom of movement,

hide from dragons*.

New spell detailed on page 106.

INITIATE OF THE DRACONIC MYSTERIES

Not all who explore the mysterious powers of dragons do so

out of heritage or religious faith. Some become students of

knowledge that leads to greater power.

Most  initiates  of  the  draconic  mysteries  are  monks,

though some fighters follow the path as well. In rare cases,

barbarians,  rangers,  or  rogues  have  been  known  to

become initiates.

NPC initiates may gather in quiet places of study to share

their  learning  and  practice  their  techniques.  Or  they  may

test their powers in the field, either alone or with others

who  respect  their  ways.  Regardless  of  her  company,  the

initiate  of  the  draconic  mysteries  remains  a  strange  and

avoid  even  magical  and  unusual  attacks  with  great

agility. If an initiate makes a successful Reflex saving

throw  against  an  attack  that  normally  deals  half

damage on a save (such as a red dragons fiery breath

or  a  fireball),  the  initiate  instead  takes  no  damage.

Evasion  can  only  be  used  if  the  initiate  is  wearing  light

armor or no armor.

Claws  of  the  Dragon  (Su): At  2nd  level,  the  unarmed

strike of an initiate of the draconic mysteries is empowered

with draconic might. The initiates unarmed strike can over-

come damage reduction as if it were a magic weapon.

In addition, the unarmed strikes of an initiate of the dra-

conic mysteries may deal slashing damage, at her option.

Such damage cannot be nonlethal damage.

Keen  Senses  (Ex): At  3rd  level,  an  initiate  gains  dark-

vision out to 60 feet and low-light vision.

Increased  Unarmed  Damage  (Ex): At  4th  level,  the

damage dealt by an initiates unarmed attacks increases by

one die step (such as from 1d3 to 1d4, or from 1d8 to 1d10).

At 8th level, it increases another die step.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A 5th-level initiate of the dra-

conic mysteries can unsettle foes with her mere presence.

The  initiate  can  activate  her  frightful  presence  as  a  free

action. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet per point of

Charisma  modifier  (minimum  30  feet)  are  subject  to

the effect if they have fewer Hit Dice than the initiate

(dragons are immune to the effect).

Class Skills

The  platinum  knights  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each skill) are Concentration (Con), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal

(Wis),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Ride

(Dex), and Sense Motive (Wis). See Chapter 4: Skills in the

Players Handbook for skill descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the platinum knight

prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A platinum knight is

proficient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  with  all

types of armor, and with shields.

Smite Evil Dragon (Su): Once per day, a platinum knight

may attempt to smite an evil dragon with one normal melee

attack.  He  adds  his  Charisma  modifier  (if  positive)  to  his

attack roll and deals 2 extra points of damage per level. If a

platinum knight accidentally smites a creature that is not an

evil dragon, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for

that day.

The bonuses from this ability dont stack with other smite

abilities, such as the paladins smite evil. Every three levels

beyond 1st, the platinum knight gains one additional daily

use of this ability.

Immune to Frightful Presence (Ex): Platinum knights

are treated as dragons for the

A platinum knight

remains immune to that initiates frightful presence for 24

hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or fewer HD become

panicked  for  2d6  rounds  and  those  with  5  or  more  HD

become shaken for 2d6 rounds.

Improved  Evasion  (Ex): At  6th  level,  an  initiates  eva-

sion  ability  improves.  She  still  takes  no  damage  on  a  suc-

cessful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragons

breath  weapon  or  a  fireball,  but  henceforth  she  only  takes

half damage on a failed save.

Spell Resistance (Su): Beginning at 7th level, an initiate

of the draconic mysteries gains spell resistance equal to 15 +

her class level.

Deadly Strike (Su): A 9th-level initiate deals triple dam-

age on a critical hit inflicted by her unarmed strike, regard-

less  of  whether  it  dealt  bludgeoning  or  slashing  damage.

Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 9th level, an initi-

ate  no  longer  takes  ability  score  penalties  for  aging  (see

Table 65: Aging Effects, page 109 of the Players Handbook)

and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have

already  taken,  however,  remain  in  place.  Bonuses  still

accrue, and the initiate still dies of old age when her time

is up.

Dragon Shape (Su): At 10th level, an initiate of the dra-

conic mysteries gains the ability to use a shapechange ability

once per day to take the form of a dragon, from Tiny to Huge

size,  for  1  hour.  Once  a  form  is  assumed,  it  cannot  be

changed  except  to  return  to  normal  (which  dismisses  the

effect). The effect is otherwise identical to the shapechange

spell, including the HD limitation of the new form and the

abilities of the form gained.

PLATINUM KNIGHT

The  platinum  knight  protects  good-aligned  dragonkind

from their natural enemies, the chromatic dragons, as well

as any others who would prey upon these noble creatures.

Bahamut, Lord of the Good Dragons, is his patron, while the

minions of Tiamat are his mortal foes.

Paladins, clerics, and fighters are the most common plat-

inum knights. Of course, any good-aligned character who

counts himself an ally of dragonkind can pursue this class,

and has much to gain from it.

NPC  platinum  knights  often  work  with  other  good-

aligned beings, including dragons, celestials, paladins, and,

of  course,  characters  of  other  classes  who  share  their  out-

look. They do not hesitate to recruit assistance when facing

powerful  evil  dragons,  but  voluntarily  associate  only  with

other good characters.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a platinum knight, a character must

fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any good.

Base Attack Bonus: +5.

Feats: Dragonfriend.

Skills: Diplomacy 4 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.

Languages: Draconic.

purpose of being immune to the frightful presence of drag-

ons and similar creatures.

Spellcasting: When  an  even-numbered  platinum

knight level is gained, the character gains new spells per

day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he

belonged  to  before  he  added  the  prestige  class.  He  does

not,  however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a  character  of  that

class would have gained (improved chance of controlling

or  rebuking  undead,  metamagic  or  item  creation  feats,

and  so  on).  This  essentially  means  that  he  adds  1/2  his

platinum knight level to the level of some other spellcast-

ing class he has, then determines spells per day and caster

level accordingly.

If a character takes two or more levels in this class before

having any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive

this spellcasting benefit. If he thereafter takes levels in one

or more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive

the spellcasting benefit for any level in the platinum knight

class that he has not already attained. For example, a 6th-

level  fighter/2nd-level  platinum  knight  does  not  receive

the  spellcasting  benefit  for  being  a  2nd-level  platinum

knight  because  he  did  not  belong  to  a  spellcasting  class

before  taking  2nd  level  in  the  prestige  class.  If  he  then

picks up one or more levels of wizard before advancing to

4th level in the platinum knight class, he receives the spell-

casting  benefit  of  a  4th-level  platinum  knight  (when  he

attains that level) but does not receive the 2nd-level bene-

fit retroactively.

Platinum Scales (Ex): At 3rd level, a platinum knights

skin  takes  on  a  slightly  metallic  sheen.  He  gains  a  +1  in-

crease to his natural armor bonus. At 7th level, this increase

improves to +2.

Bahamuts Grace (Su): A 5th-level platinum knight adds

his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving

throws against the attacks, special abilities, and spells cast by

evil dragons. This effect stacks with the divine grace class

feature of paladins and similar abilities.

Charisma Bonus (Ex): At 9th level, a platinum knights

Charisma increases by 2 points.

True Seeing (Su): At 10th level, a platinum knight gains

the ability to see all things as they actually are. This ability is

the equivalent of the true seeing spell and lasts for 1 hour. A

platinum knight may use true seeing once per day.

TALON OF TIAMAT

The talon of Tiamat furthers the goals of evil dragonkind.

He takes particular delight in causing harm to metallic drag-

ons and their allies.

The talons of Tiamat welcome characters from any class

or background, as long as they share a dedication to evil.

Former fighters and barbarians rub shoulders with those

who practice sorcery or divine magic. Even ex-paladins can

find a home among the talons.

Talons of Tiamat may work individually or in groups, as

befits their plans. They work well with evil characters of any

stripe, and ally with evil dragons when possible.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements

To qualify to become a talon of Tiamat, a character must ful-

fill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any evil.

Base Attack Bonus: +4.

Feats: Dragonthrall.

Skills: Bluff  4  ranks,  Intimidate  4  ranks,  Knowledge

(arcana) 4 ranks.

Languages: Draconic.

Class Skills

The  talon  of Tiamats  class  skills  (and  the  key  ability  for

each skill) are Appraise (Int), Bluff (Cha), Concentration

(Con),  Intimidate  (Cha),  Knowledge  (arcana)  (Int),  Ride

(Dex),  Search  (Int),  Sense  Motive  (Wis),  and  Spellcraft

(Int). See Chapter 4: Skills in the Players Handbook for skill

descriptions.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features

All of the following are class features of the talon of Tiamat

prestige class.

Weapon  and  Armor  Proficiency: A  talon  of Tiamat  is

proficient  with  all  simple  and  martial  weapons,  with  all

types of armor, and with shields.

Breath Weapon (Su): At 1st level, a talon of Tiamat gains

the ability to breathe out a cone of frost (size of the cone cor-

responds to the size of the character) that deals 3d6 points

of cold damage.

134

As the talon gains levels, additional versions of his breath

weapon  become  available  to  him.  At  3rd  level,  the  talon

can breathe a line of acid (8d4 acid damage). At 5th level,

he can breathe a cone of corrosive gas (10d6 acid damage).

At  7th  level,  he  can  expel  a  line  of  lightning  (12d8  elec-

tricity damage). At 9th level, he can breathe a cone of fire

(14d8 fire damage).

In each case, a successful Reflex save halves the damage

dealt. The  DC  for  saves  against  the  talons

breath  weapon  is  10  +  talon  class  level  +

Con  modifier.  A  talon  of  Tiamat  can  use

each of his breath weapons once per day.

Once  a  talon  uses  any  of  his  breath

weapons,  he  cant  use  any  other

breath  weapon  until  1d4  rounds

have passed.

Spellcasting: When  an

even-numbered  talon  of

Tiamat  level  is  gained,  the

character gains new spells per day

as if he had also gained a level in a spell-

casting  class  he  belonged  to  before  he

added  the  prestige  class.  He  does  not,

however,  gain  any  other  benefit  a

character of that class would

have  gained  (improved

chance  of  controlling  or

rebuking  undead,  metamagic  or

item creation feats, and so on). This

essentially means that he adds 1/2

his  talon  of Tiamat  level  to  the

level of some other spellcasting

class  he  has,  then  determines

spells per day and caster level

accordingly.

If a character takes two or

A talon of Tiamat

more levels in this class before having

any levels in a spellcasting class, he does not receive this

spellcasting  benefit.  If  he  thereafter  takes  levels  in  one  or

more spellcasting classes, he becomes eligible to receive the

spellcasting benefit for any level in the talon of Tiamat class

that  he  has  not  already  attained.  For  example,  a  7th-level

fighter/2nd-level talon of Tiamat does not receive the spell-

casting benefit for being a 2nd-level talon of Tiamat because

he  did  not  belong  to  a  spellcasting  class  before  taking  2nd

level in the prestige class. If he then picks up one or more

levels of wizard before advancing to 4th level in the talon of

Tiamat class, he receives the spellcasting benefit of a 4th-level

talon  of  Tiamat  (when  he  attains  that  level)  but  does  not

receive the 2nd-level benefit retroactively.

Voice of the Dragon (Ex): At 2nd level, a talon of Tiamat

gains a +2 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks. This

bonus increases by +2 every four levels thereafter,

to +4 at 6th level and +6 at 10th level.

Keen Senses (Ex): A talon of Tiamat gains

low-light vision at 4th level. He

gains darkvision out to 60

feet at 8th level.

Immunities  (Ex): At

6th  level,  a  talon  of  Tiamat

gains immunity to magic sleep

and  paralysis  effects.  In  addition,

he  gains  immunity  to  one  of  the

following  forms  of  energy,  at  his

option:  acid,  cold,  electricity,  or

fire. Once an energy immunity

is  selected,  the  decision  may

never be changed.

5 or more HD become shaken for 2d6 rounds.

Dominate Dragon (Su): A 10th-level talon of Tiamat can

attempt to dominate any dragon (as dominate monster, but it

only  applies  to  dragons)  once  per  day. The  target  may  at-

tempt a Will save to negate the effect (DC 10 + talons class

DRAGONS IN THE PARTY

Adding a dragon to an adventuring party is an attractive option

to most playing groups. Even the smallest dragon brings sharp

senses and great mobility to the table, probably far beyond

the capabilities of any of the other player characters.

While its true that a dragon that adventures with PCs can

change  the  game,  with  a  few  safeguards  in  place,  the  DM

should be able to feel comfortable about this addition. This

section details many of the most common methods of incor-

porating a dragon into a group of PCs, and provides the DM

with guidelines to control the ramifications of that addition.

All of these options depend on your DMs permission. If you

want to add a dragon to your group, work with your DM to

ensure that this addition will fit smoothly into the campaign.

While many players look at a dragon and see only its claws,

teeth, and breath weapon, these abilities are among the least

significant as far as game balance goes. After all, most char-

acters can deal plenty of damage by means of attacks or mag-

ical effects.

Instead, its the dragons less spectacular abilities, such as

blindsense and flight, that make it potentially too power-

ful as a member of an adventuring group. Here are some

tips on how to handle those abilities in your game, as well as

notes  on  some  disadvantages  that  a  draconic  character

might encounter.

Blindsense: True  dragons  possess  blindsense,  which

threatens  to  remove  a  valuable  tool  from  the  DMs  arsenal,

because  invisible  foes  arent  nearly  as  dire  a  threat  to  the

partty  anymore.  Remember,  though,  that  blindsense  isnt

the same thing as a true seeing effectit merely allows the

dragon  to  detect  the  presence  of  creatures  within  its  blind-

sense  range. The  dragon  cant  automatically  see  through  an

illusion (though one without auditory and olfactory elements

probably  wont  work),  and  disguises  work  perfectly  well.

Incorporeal,  gaseous,  and  ethereal  creatures  also  can  give  a

dragon plenty of problems. A deafened dragon, or one inside

a silence effect, also cant use its blindsense to full effect.

Equipment: Dragons cant easily use many items of equip-

ment built for characters. While a dragon has little need for

weapons  and  armorits  natural  attacks  and  natural  armor

work  well  enoughit  may  be  frustrated  by  its  inability  to

wield  or  wear  certain  magic  items.  See  the  Dragons  and

Magic Items sidebar (page 24) for more information.

Keen Senses: All dragons have darkvision and low-light

vision, making them at least the equal of any PC in the group

in these regards. Lesser dragons cant see in the dark better

than a dwarf or a half-orc, nor in low light better than an elf

or a half-elf, but simply having both forms of vision makes

them the best at spotting hidden foes and the like. Dragons

also have good Spot and Listen skill modifiers, so a smart

party will use the dragon as a lookout or scout.

Movement: Almost  all  dragons  can  fly  at  exceptional

speed. A wyrmling dragon can cover 200 or 300 feet in a

round, which is faster than most characters can run. Some

136

dragons also have swim or burrow speeds, giving them even

greater movement options.

Remember, though, that most dragons have average or

worse maneuverability in flight. This hindrance can make

the  average  dungeon  corridor  or  cramped  room  all  but

impassable to a dragon in flight. Also, unless a dragon has

the Hover feat, it probably must move a minimum distance

each  round,  preventing  it  from  making  full  attacks  while

airborne. See Fighting on the Wing (page 59) for more infor-

mation on this topic.

Size: A  dragon  bigger  than  Medium  has  distinct  diffi-

culty  accompanying  characters  into  most  buildings,  and

Huge or larger dragons probably cant even enter most dun-

geons. Only a very well-trained or otherwise loyal dragon

will  go  along  with  characters  into  an  area  where  it  cant

easily move around (see also Maneuverability, above).

Youth: In many cases when a dragon joins a party, it does

so as a wyrmling or at a youthful age. But just because a

wyrmling  dragon  has  a  decent  Intelligence  and  more  hit

points than the average ogre doesnt make it adult in its out-

look. Dragons mature slowly, meaning that even a 30-year-

old juvenile dragon acts more like a child than an adult.

This may mean that a youthful dragon doesnt always follow

instructions well, and may even completely disobey the PC

who controls it.

The DM should feel comfortable in occasionally having a

juvenile or younger dragon act up in a manner appropriate

to its alignment. A good dragon may simply sulk or pout,

while an evil dragon might lash out at those upsetting it.

Chaotic dragons are prone to tantrums in their youth, while

lawful dragons are more likely to misbehave in a carefully

plotted manner.

DRAGONS AS MOUNTS

The dream mount for many characters is a dragon. While

other flying creatures might be cheaper or easier to train as

mounts, nothing beats the look of awe from friends and foes

when they see you swoop in astride a mighty draconic steed.

There are two methods of getting a dragon as your mount:

raising the dragon from youth or negotiating with a full-

grown  dragon. The  first  may  be  easier  and  cheaper,  but

requires far more time. Each method is discussed later in

this section

As strong, quadrupedal creatures, dragons can carry a lot

of weight, even in flight. A dragon can carry a rider while

swimming, but not while burrowing.

Table 313: Dragon Mounts, Overland Movement, and

Carrying Capacity provides movement rates and carrying

capacity for a great number of different dragons. The column

headers on the table are defined below.

Dragon: The left-hand column lists a number of dragons

that are suitable for use as mounts. The mounts are grouped

according to the largest size of rider each dragon can accom-

modate. Just because a dragon can carry your weight doesnt

necessarily mean that you can ride it as a mount. Even if a

dragon is strong enough to carry a larger character than its

grouping on the table would indicate, it cant accommodate

such a character as a rider.

Light Load or No Load: Dragons, like other flying creatures,

can only fly when carrying no more than a light load. The

two  columns  beneath  this  line  give  the  dragons  overland

movement  when  it  is  not  carrying  enough  weight  to  pre-

vent it from flying.

Load  Range: This  column  gives  a  pair  of  numbers  repre-

senting the range from a medium load to a maximum load for

the dragon. For example, the entry for a young black dragon

is 101300 lb. This means that when the dragon is carrying

101  pounds  or  more,  its  hauling  a  medium  load  (and  thus

cannot fly); and its not capable of moving at all while carry-

ing more than 300 pounds, which is its maximum load.

Medium or Heavy Load: The two columns beneath this line

give  the  dragons  overland  movement  when  it  is  carrying

enough weight to prevent it from flying. (An exception is

the dragon turtle, which does not have a fly speed; its num-

bers  in  these  columns  simply  represent  the  reduction  in

land speed and swim speed that any creature suffers if it car-

ries more than a light load.)

Raising a Dragon

Raising a true dragon from an egg until its large enough

to use as a mount can take several years. Even lesser dragons,

such as wyverns, mature at such a slow rate that most char-

acters simply arent willing to wait the necessary amount

of time.

For rules on how to raise a newly hatched dragon, see the

Rearing a Dragon sidebar, page 13. When you successfully

complete  the  rearing  process,  you  can  begin  to  teach  the

domesticated dragon how to perform tasks.

Although intelligent, a dragon requires training before it

can bear a rider in combat. Training a dragon you have reared

to serve as a mount requires six weeks of work and a DC 25

Handle  Animal  check.  Riding  a  dragon  requires  an  exotic

saddle.  A  dragon  can  fight  while  carrying  a  rider,  but  the

rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride

check (see the Ride skill, page 80 of the Players Handbook).

Even a trained or tamed dragon is still a dragon, not an

ordinary domestic animal, with its own needs and desires.

A young dragon is more like a very intelligent child than

a  simple  animal  (Intelligence  score  ranging  from  8  to  18,

depending on age and kind) and may well be smarter than

its  rider.  With  such  a  creature,  patience  and  tact  produce

better results than harsh words and punishment. Expect a

dragon  to  learn  quickly,  but  allow  for  its  inexperience  to

cause  mistakes.  Like  children  and  pets,  dragons  get  tired,

and its best to let them rest when they do.

Negotiating Service

Its likely that a character seeking a draconic mount cant

or wont put in the time necessary to rear a dragon. In such

a  case,  the  best  option  is  to  bargain  with  your  would-be

mount. (Using magic such as charm spells is a mistake, since

the  magic  eventually  wears  off,  and  such  coercion  angers

the dragon.) These negotiations always require some form of

payment or reward to the dragon, which should take a form

appropriate to the dragon variety (such as pearls for a bronze

dragon) and should amount to at least 500 gp per HD of the

dragon per year of servicepaid in advance, of course, gen-

erally as soon as the negotiations are over.

Most potential dragon mounts begin with an indifferent

attitude toward a character who approaches them. A dragon

whose attitude is changed to helpful (see Influencing NPC

Attitudes,  page  72  of  the  Players  Handbook)  by  a  character

can be trained to serve as a mount, but only as long as it is

treated well and regularly rewarded. Promising an increased

reward can help persuade a dragon to cooperate; each addi-

tional  payment  of  500  gp  per  HD  provides  a  +2  circum-

stance bonus on any Diplomacy check made to change the

dragons attitude. You cant retry a failed Diplomacy check

for  the  same  purpose  unless  the  DM  decides  that  the  cir-

cumstances merit giving you another chance (for instance,

if you perform a great favor for the dragon).

A dragon whose alignment isnt within one step of its

riders isnt likely to serve for very long, even if the initial

negotiations succeed.

Alternatively,  you  can  select  the  Dragon  Steed  feat  (see

page  105)  to  gain  the  loyal  service  of  a  dragonnel.  In  this

case, no payment or Diplomacy check is required.

Keeping a Dragon Mount

A dragon mount, although it may be loyal to you, is still an

independent,  intelligent  creature  with  a  mind  of  its  own.

Expect the DM to treat a dragon mount as an NPC, not as a

passive participant. (A rider with only a modest Charisma

score can expect to lose a lot of arguments with his or her

mount.) A dragon mount ages normally, but does not gain

experience points.

Regardless of how well you treat your dragon, a time will

likely come when the dragon wants to leave. Because of a

dragons  relatively  slow  growth  rate  during  its  extremely

long life span, chances are you will gain experience (levels)

faster  than  the  dragon  grows  (and  thereby  increases  its

effective  character  level).  At  some  point  the  dragon  will

realize it is being outpaced (when your level exceeds the

dragons ECL by 5 or more), and it will leave. Also, a dragon

mount that reaches adult age often begins thinking about

leaving to raise a family. Trying to keep a dragon from leav-

ing, even if you manage to succeed, is a mistake. Whether

or not a dragon discusses parting company before doing so

depends  on  its  alignment  and  its  relationship  with  you.

(This point doesnt apply if the dragon is your cohort or a

special mount; see below.)

If you keep your promises to a dragon mount and let it

leave when it chooses, usually it will remain friendly toward

you. If it holds a grudge against you, it may attack openly, or

it may plot secretly for years before striking.

DRAGONS AS COHORTS

If your DM is willing to allow it, you can use the Leadership

feat to try attracting a dragon to be your cohort. To deter-

mine what sort of dragon will heed your call, first refer to

the  Leadership  table  on  page  106  of  the  Dungeon  Masters

Guide to  determine  the  highest  level  of  cohort  you  can

attract.  Then  consult  Table  314:  Dragon  Cohorts  to  see

what age and kind of dragon can be attracted based on the

level of cohort you can attract. Note that even though the

table lists dragons with an ECL higher than 17, you cant use

the  Leadership  feat  to  attract  a  cohort  with  a  level  higher

than 17th.

Alternatively, the Dragon Cohort feat (see page 104) allows

you to attract a draconic cohort. In this case, you can treat

the dragons ECL as if it were 3 lower than given, allowing

you to gain a more powerful dragon than with the Leader-

ship feat. (This adjustment to ECL is only for purposes of

selecting an appropriate cohort, not for any other purpose.)

Regardless of which feat is used, the method by which

the character attracts the dragon cohort should be decided

by the player and DM together. Since most of the options

listed on Table 314 are younger than adult, its entirely pos-

sible that such a dragon was entrusted to the PCs care and

training by its parents. The character might even have had

the opportunity to raise his cohort from an egg! See Rais-

ing a Dragon, above, for more information on dealing with

young dragons.

Some paladins want more from a mount than loyalty. Some

desire an intelligent companion who can share their adven-

tures, a mighty ally against the forces of evil whose power

can  grow  with  the  paladins.  For  these  paladins,  only  one

choice exists: the dragon special mount.

Clearly,  a  dragon  is  a  far  more  powerful  special  mount

than any other a paladin could obtain. If a paladin can simply

summon a dragon mount, a class feature designed primarily

as flavor and secondarily as an actual power boost to the pal-

adin becomes significant more useful to the character. Such

a special mount threatens to become more special than the

paladin herself.

Furthermore,  most  true  dragons  large  enough  to  bear  a

rider  have  little  interest  in  being  at  the  beck  and  call  of

anyone, even a character as devoted to law and good as a pal-

adin must be.

That said, few sights are more breathtaking than a paladin

astride a mighty dragon, its scales glistening in the sunlight

as it soars through the sky in search of evil to smite. If you

(and your friends) are willing to put up with the headaches,

this option might suit you.

Only a lawful good dragon should be allowed to serve as

a paladins special mount. The dragonnel (see Chapter 4) is a

special exception to this guideline.

A paladin who wishes to be able to summon a dragon spe-

cial mount must select the Dragon Steed feat (see page 105).

She  then  selects  an  appropriate  dragon  from  Table  315:

Dragon Special Mount Availability based on her paladin level.

She may select any dragon indicated as available at her level or

lower. For instance, a 9th-level paladin could select only a drag-

onnel as her dragon special mount, while a 12th-level paladin

could choose either a wyrmling gold dragon or a dragonnel.

The paladin must choose a dragon capable of bearing her as

a rider (which limits a Medium riders selections).

A paladin must provide her special mount with a suitable

lair; even a loyal silver dragon mount wont live in the stable

with the other mounts. The Monster Manual describes what

type of lair each kind of dragon prefers; any dragon denied

the ability to build and reside in an appropriate lair will cer-

tainly rebel against its paladin.

The dragon must also be provided treasure to keep in its

lair. A minimum hoard of 1,000 gp per Hit Die of the dragon

is typical, with the exact makeup depending on the type and

likes  of  the  dragon.  Bronze  dragons,  for  instance,  prefer

pearls. (The dragon isnt just keeping the treasure safe for

you, it belongs to the dragon, and it wont part with this trea-

sure kindly).

Finally (and perhaps most important), the dragon must be

treated with the respect that a creature of its intelligence,

power,  and  stature  commands.  It  is  not  a  dumb  beast  to

order around, nor is it merely a minion to command. Even

lawful good dragons are willful creatures with their own

desires and needs.

A dragon special mount gains abilities much as a typical

special mount, though at a rate based on the level at which

the mount first becomes available. This means that the most

powerful special dragon mounts dont get all the typical abil-

ities of a special mount. Table 316: Special Dragon Mount

Abilities  summarizes  the  details.  For  basic  information

about the terms on the table, see the sidebar The Paladins

Mount, page 45 of the Players Handbook. Differences from

that basic information are covered below.

Bonus HD: Treat the same as bonus HD for a regular pal-

adins mount, except that these are extra twelve-sided (d12)

Hit Dice.

Int: The Intelligence column only applies to those drag-

ons whose Intelligence score is lower than that value (that

is, a dragon special mount with an Intelligence higher than

the given value retains its normal Intelligence).

Improved  Speed: This  ability  applies  to  all  of  the  dragons

modes of movement, including land speed, fly speed, and

even burrow speed or swim speed (if the dragon possesses

one or both).

Share Spells: This ability applies only to spells that the pal-

adin casts. The dragon cant elect for spells that it casts on

itself to also affect the paladin.

Spell  Resistance: The  spell  resistance  gained  by  a  dragon

special mount doesnt stack with any natural spell resistance

it might have. Only the higher value applies.

Dragons as Fiendish Servants

If your campaign includes blackguards, such a character can

use these rules to recruit a dragon as his fiendish servant.

Compare the blackguards character and class level to Table

317:  Dragon  Fiendish  Servant  Availability.  If  the  black-

guard is of sufficient level, he may select an available dragon

as his fiendish servant after taking the Dragon Cohort feat.

As with a dragon special mount, a dragon fiendish servant

gains special abilities at a rate based on the level at which the

servant  first  becomes  available. This  means  that  the  most

powerful dragon fiendish servants dont get all the typical

abilities of a fiendish servant.

Improved  Speed: This  ability

applies  to  all  of  the  dragons

modes of movement, including land

speed, fly speed, and even burrow speed or

swim  speed  (if  the  dragon  possesses  one  or  both).

Share Spells: This ability applies only to spells that the pal-

adin casts. The dragon cant elect for spells that it casts on

itself to also affect the blackguard.

Spell  Resistance: The  spell  resistance  gained  by  a  dragon

fiendish servant doesnt stack with any natural spell resist-

ance it might have. Only the higher value applies.

DRAGONS AS FAMILIARS

By selecting the Dragon Familiar feat, an arcane spellcaster

can gain a wyrmling dragon as a familiar. This option is most

popular among sorcerers, though many wizards also under-

stand the value of having a dragon on your side.

Your  alignment  must  be  one  of  the  acceptable  align-

ments  indicated  for  the  dragon  kind  on  Table  319:

Choosing  a  Dragon  Familiar.  In  addition,  your  arcane

spellcaster level must be at least as high as the value given

for that dragon. For example, a 7th-level neutral sorcerer

could select only a white dragon as his familiar, but a 10th-

Familiar  Ability  Descriptions: All  dragon  familiars

have  special  abilities  (or  impart  abilities  to  their  masters)

depending on the level of the master. For full details about

the abilities mentioned on Table 320, see the sidebar Famil-

iars on pages 5253 of the Players Handbook.

DRAGONS AS

PLAYER CHARACTERS

A  very  different  campaign  model  features  dragons  most

prominently in the game by allowing players to run dragon

characters, either a single character in a party made up pri-

marily  of  standard  races,  or  in  an  entire  party  of  dragons.

Depending  on  the  tone  and  level  of  the  campaign,  these

powerful PCs can engage in traditional sorts of adventures,

or they can concern themselves with epic quests, believing

that more mundane tasks are beneath them.

In  one  effective  campaign  model,  each  player  has  two

active characters in the campaign: a dragon and a member of

a standard race who is bonded to the dragon as a kindred.

Some  adventures,  particularly  those  involving  treks  into

dungeons and cramped tunnels where a dragon cant bring

its full powers to bear, focus on the actions of the bonded

kindred.  Other  adventures,  especially  those  with  a  more

epic sweep, bring the dragon PCs into the action.

If  you  adopt  this  campaign  model,  consider  awarding

experience points to both characters whenever either char-

acter adventures. Each time an active character gains XP,

the  inactive  character  receives  an  award  equal  to  25%  of

the award the active character gets.

Dragon  kindred  share  a  special  emotional  bond  with

the dragon character; this bond is best

reflected by the dragonkith prestige class

(see page 123). Kindred do not need to

adopt  this  prestige  class,  but  many

advance  at  least  a  few  levels  in  it,

once they qualify.

This wyrmling

gold dragon

adventures

alongside a

13th-level

paladin.

A different way to focus on

dragons  as  player  characters

is  to  use  characters  from  the

standard  races,  but  with  the

half-dragon  template  ap-

plied. Such characters can

make use of much of the

material presented in this

book, without straying so

far  from  the  boundaries

of  what  normal  D&D

characters can do. See the

half-dragon  template  on

page  146  of  the  Monster

Manual and  the  half-

dragon  entry  in  Chapter

4 of this book (page 166).

Advancement and

Aging

A  dragon  PC  be-

gins at a specified

age (in accordance

with  the  current

party  level  in  the

campaign)  and  gains  character  levels  as  the  player  wishes

over the course of its adventures. As it ages from wyrmling

to juvenile, a true dragons level adjustment varies between

+2 and +6, depending on the age and dragon variety. For a

dragon PC, the dragons Hit Dice and class levels plus this

level adjustment is its effective character level (ECL). For a

starting  character  of  juvenile  or  younger  age,  this  ECL  is

somewhere between 5 and 20.

As it ages, as shown on Table 321: Aging for Dragon PCs,

the dragon is required to devote a level every few years to its

dragon class, reflecting the extra Hit Die or level adjust-

ment  it  gains  from  aging.  The  character  must  add  this

dragon level as the first level it gains after reaching an age

shown on the table. It gains no benefit from reaching a new

age category until it attains this level.

Most  of  the  time,  a  dragon  character  who  advances  a

dragon level gains 1 Hit Die (1d12), 1 point of natural armor

bonus, and 1 point of base attack bonus. Every two increased

142

Hit  Dice  translate  to  an  increased  base  save  bonus  and

increased save DCs for the dragons special abilities.

Once  in  a  while,  a  dragon  character  must  advance  a

dragon level without gaining a Hit Die, base attack bonus

or save bonus increase, or any other tangible benefit. These

levels are indicated on Table 321 by asterisks in the Age in

Years column: When the dragon reaches the specified age,

the next level the character attains must be used to advance

its  dragon  level.  When  this  occurs,  its  level  adjustment

increases (and its ECL rises accordingly) but the character

receives  no  other  benefits.  These  extraneous  levels

smooth the transitions between age categories, which are

often  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  level  adjustment  to

account for changes in size, ability scores, and other char-

acteristics. In most cases on Table 321, a dragon PC that is

close  to  reaching  a  new  age  category  has  a  higher  level

adjustment than is specified for its age

category  and  kind  in  the  Monster

Manual. This  method  of  transitioning

between age cat-

egories ensures

that  a  dragon  PC

does  not  make  rapid  jumps  in  power

out of proportion to its ECL by reaching

a  new  age  category  and  gaining  the

benefits of as many as three effective

character  levels  at  once  (as,  for

example, a young white dragon with

11 HD and a level adjustment of +3

would  do  when  advancing  to

the  juvenile  age  category

with  12  HD  and  a  level

adjustment of +5).

When a dragon reaches

a new age category, its abil-

ity scores improve across the

board.  When  a  dragons

Intelligence  score  in-

creases  due  to  aging,  it

gains additional skill points

for  its  new  Intelligence  score  retroactively,  in  contrast  to

the standard rules governing character advancement. Each

+2  increase  in  Intelligence  gives  the  character  an  addi-

tional  1  skill  point  per  dragon  HD,  which  translates  to  a

new skill at 1 rank per dragon HD (if it is a class skill) or 1/2

rank per dragon HD (for cross-class skills). The dragon does

not  get  additional  skill  points  for  any  class  levels  it  pos-

sesses,  nor  does  it  gain  retroactive  skill  points  when  its

Intelligence increases through other means (such as a head-

band of intellect or an ability score increase gained as part of

character advancement).

For example, Simon is creating a gold dragon PC to join a

party of 13th-level characters. His character, Keryst, begins

play  as  a  newborn  wyrmling  dragon,  with  8  dragon  Hit

Dice and a level adjustment of +4, plus one level of paladin,

for a total effective character level (ECL) of 13th. Keryst has

8d12 Hit Dice from his dragon heritage plus 1d10 from his

paladin  level,  has  +7  natural  armor,  and  possesses  all  the

other  abilities  typical  of  wyrmling  gold  dragons  and  1st-

level paladins. As a 13th-level character, he begins play with

78,000 XP (or whatever number the DM specifies between

78,000 and 90,999) and must accumulate a total of 91,000

XP to advance another level.

Keryst gains two levels as a paladin before reaching his

second birthday. Before adding his next dragon level, he still

has  8d12  dragon  Hit  Dice,  and  now  has  3d10  paladin  Hit

Dice. His racial abilities are unchanged, but his paladin abil-

ities  have  advanced  according  to  his  level.  His  ECL  is  15.

When he turns 2 years old, the next time he gains a level he

must  add  a  dragon  Hit  Die  instead  of  a  paladin  level.  He

gains a 12-sided Hit Die, his natural armor bonus increases

by +1, and his base attack bonus increases. Since he now has

a  total  of  12  Hit  Dice,  he  gains  a  feat  and  an  ability  score

increase. His ECL increases by 1 just as if he had gained a

paladin level, to 16.

After his 2nd birthday, Keryst gains only 1 more paladin

level over the next year. Before turning 3, Keryst is a 4th-level

paladin and a 17th-level character. After his 3rd birthday, he

must again add a dragon level, giving him 10d12 dragon Hit

Dice plus his 4d10 paladin Hit Dice. His base attack bonus,

base save bonuses, and natural armor bonus all increase by

+1, and the save DC against his breath weapon also increases

to 15 + his Con modifier. His ECL is now 18.

Two  more  years  pass  and  Keryst  gains  one  more  paladin

level, making him a 5th-level paladin and a 19th-level charac-

ter. Now he turns 5 and must add another dragon levelbut

this one does not gain him an additional Hit Die. He still has

10d12  dragon  Hit  Dice  and  5d10  paladin  Hit  Dice,  but  his

level adjustment is now +5, making him a 20th-level character.

When Keryst turns 6, he becomes a very young dragon

and he must advance another dragon level. His dragon Hit

Dice increase to 11d12, he is still a 5th-level paladin, and his

level adjustment is still +5, so he is now a 21st-level charac-

ter. In addition to the base attack bonus and natural armor

bonus increases for his greater dragon Hit Dice, he gains the

abilities of a very young dragon: His breath weapon damage

increases to 4d10, and his ability scores increase as follows:

Str +4, Con +2, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. His increased Intelli-

gence score grants him an additional 11 skill points, which

he can use to gain a class skill (for his dragon class) at 11

ranks or a cross-class skill at 5 1/2 ranks.

On the table, Hit Dice and Level Adjustment are given

for  wyrmling,  very  young,  (usually)  young,  and  (some-

times) juvenile dragons.

For  example,  a  sapphire  dragon  has  5  HD  and  a  level

adjustment of +2 as a wyrmling, 8 HD and a level adjust-

ment of +3 when it reaches the very young stage, 11 HD

and  a  level  adjustment  of  +4  at  the  young  stage,  and  15

HD and a level adjustment of +4 as a juvenile. Its progres-

sion is identical to that of a copper dragon.

If the sum of a dragons Hit Dice and its level adjustment

gives  it  an  effective  character  level  higher  than  20,  that

dragon character is too powerful to fit into a party of PCs

below epic level. For instance, a howling dragon has 9 HD

and a level adjustment of +4 as a wyrmling and 12 HD and a

level  adjustment  of  +5  as  a  very  young  dragon.  When  it

reaches young age, it has 15 HD and a +6 level adjustment,

giving it an ECL of 21; thus, information on a young howl-

ing dragon as a PC is absent from Table 322.

Also, all lung dragons are yu lung for their first 25 years of

life  (through  the  young  age  category).  When  a  yu  lung

reaches juvenile age, it transforms into a different variety of

dragon.  Because  of  their  high  juvenile  Hit  Dice  and  level

adjustment, many lung dragons have ECLs higher than 20

at  the  juvenile  stage  and  thus  are  not  mentioned  on  this

table. These  varieties  include  the  shen  lung,  chiang  lung,

tun mi lung, lung wang, and tien lung. The Hit Dice and

level adjustment listings for the pan lung and li lung are for

juveniles only.

Lesser Dragon PCs

Using another creature of the dragon type as a player char-

acter is rather less complicated than using a true dragon.

Such a creature has a set level adjustment and no built-in

progression due to age, so after the character begins play

there  is  no  reason  to  advance  the  character  as  a  monster

again. For example, a wyvern character, with a level adjust-

ment of +4 and 7 Hit Dice, has an ECL of 11 and joins a

party  of  11th-level  characters  to  adventure.  The  wyvern

continues advancing as a character, just like the other char-

acters in the party.

Many creatures of the dragon type have more than 20

Hit Dice, or their level adjustment would raise their ECL

above 20. These monsters are not included in the follow-

ing information.

The  abyssal  drake  is  the  horrific  result  of  an

ancient  breeding  program  that  combines  the

nastiest  elements  of  demons,  wyverns,  and  red

dragons. Originally intended to serve as mounts

for mighty demon princes, abyssal drakes proved

too unruly for such service. Now they roam the

wilds of the Abyss, preying on demons and vis-

itors alike.

Abyssal  drakes  resemble  their  wyvern

ancestors,  but  their  dark  red,  scaled  hides

betray their fiendish heritage. They have power-

ful batlike wings, a serpentine neck, and razor-

sharp claws.

Abyssal drakes speak Abyssal and Common. 145

COMBAT

An  abyssal  drake  retains  the

aggressive nature of its wyvern

ancestors, diving upon prey in

a  barely  controlled  descent,

strafing its foes with its breath

weapon and scattering them with

its frightful presence, then pick-

ing off lone survivors.

When using the Flyby Attack

feat, an abyssal drake can attack

with sting, bite, or both claws.

Its claws lack the dexterity to

snatch up an opponent, so it

contents  itself  with  merely

rending its foe.

An abyssal drakes natural

weapons, as well as any weap-

ons it wields, are treated as

chaotic-aligned  and  evil-

aligned for purpose of over-

coming  damage  reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): 60-

ft.  cone,  every  1d4  rounds,

10d6  special,  Reflex  DC  20

half.  Much  like  a  flame  strike spell,

half of this damage is fire damage

and  the  remainder  is  unholy

damage  (and  thus  not  subject

to resistance to fire and simi-

lar  defenses). The  save  DC  is

Constitution-based.

Frightful Presence (Ex): When

Abyssal drake

presence  for  24  hours.  Dragons  ignore  the  frightful  pres-

ence of an abyssal drake, as do other abyssal drakes.

Poison  (Ex): Sting,  Fortitude  DC  20;  initial  and  sec-

ondary damage 2d6 Con.

Rend  (Ex): If  an  abyssal  drake  hits  with  both  claw

attacks, it latches onto the opponents body and tears

the flesh. This rending attack automatically deals an

extra 4d4+13 points of damage.

Outsider Traits: An abyssal drake cannot be

raised, reincarnated, or resurrected (though a

limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection

spell can restore life).

DRACOLICH

The dracolich is an undead creature

resulting  from  the  transformation

of an evil dragon. The process usu-

ally involves a cooperative effort

between  an  evil  dragon  and  a

powerful  cleric,  sorcerer,  or

wizard, but especially powerful

spellcasters  have  been  known

to  coerce  an  evil  dragon  to

undergo  the  transformation

against its will.

The  dragon  must  first  consume  a

lethal concoction known as a dracolich

brew (see page 120). This act instantly slays

the dragon, whereupon its spirit is transferred

to its dracolich phylactery (also see page 120),

regardless of the distance between the phylactery

and the dragons body.

an abyssal drake charges, attacks, or flies over-

head, it inspires terror in all creatures within

120  feet  that  have  fewer  Hit  Dice  or  levels

than it has. Each potential victim must attempt a DC 17 Will

save. On a failure, a creature with 4 or fewer HD becomes

panicked  for  4d6  rounds,  and  one  with  5  or  more  HD

becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. A successful save leaves

that  opponent  immune  to  that  abyssal  drakes  frightful

A spirit contained in a phylactery can sense

any  reptilian  or  dragon  corpse  of  Medium  or

larger  size  within  90  feet  and  attempt  to  pos-

sess  it.  Under  no  circumstances  can  the  spirit  possess  a

living body. The spirits original body is an ideal vessel, and

any attempt to possess it is automatically successful. To pos-

sess a suitable corpse other than its own, a dracolich must

make a successful Charisma check (DC 10 for a true dragon,

for any other kind of reptilian creature, such as a giant snake

or lizardfolk). If the check fails, the dracolich can never pos-

sess that particular corpse.

If the corpse accepts the spirit, the corpse becomes ani-

mated. If the animated corpse is the spirits former body, it

immediately becomes a dracolich. Otherwise, it becomes a

proto-dracolich (see below).

A dracolich appears as a skeletal or semiskeletal version of

its former self, with glowing points of light in its shadowy

eye sockets.

This  diabolical  creature  has  turned  an  ancient  tomb  com-

plex into its lair. Once a place of respect for the dead, the

area has become a charnel house.

Combat

This  dracolich  uses  its  spells  to  warn  of  and  spy  on  ap-

proaching  enemies,  ensuring  that  it  knows  enough  to  de-

fend itself. It prefers hit-and-run tactics, using dimension door

to come and go as it pleases. It separates targets with spells

such as solid fog and web, and then picks off lone foes.

This dracolich also uses any magic items in its possession

to best effect (generate its treasure according to the normal

rules or use the sample CR 23 dragon hoard in Appendix 1).

This  dracolichs  natural  weapons  are  treated  as  magic

weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): 120-ft. line (60-ft. cone if shaped),

20d8 electricity, Reflex DC 32 half.

Frightful  Presence  (Ex): This  dracolich  can  unsettle

foes with its mere presence. The ability takes effect auto-

matically whenever it attacks, charges, or flies overhead.

Creatures  within  a  radius  of  180  feet  are  subject  to  the

effect if they have fewer than 35 HD. A potentially affected

creature  that  succeeds  on  a  DC  32  Will  save  remains

immune to its frightful presence for 24 hours. On a fail-

ure,  creatures  with  4  or  fewer  HD  become  panicked  for

4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken

for 4d6 rounds. Dracoliches ignore the frightful presence

of other dracoliches.

Rend (Ex): Extra damage 4d8+18.

Snatch (Ex): Against Medium or smaller creatures, bite

for 4d6+12/round or claw for 2d8+6/round.

Invulnerability: If a dracolich is slain, its spirit immedi-

ately returns to its phylactery, from where it may attempt to

possess a suitable corpse.

Keen Senses (Ex): This dracolich sees four times as well

as  a  human  in  low-light  conditions  and  twice  as  well  in

normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 feet.

Paralyzing Gaze (Su): The gaze of a dracolichs glowing

eyes can paralyze victims within 40 feet if they fail a DC 24

Fortitude save. If the saving throw is successful, the charac-

ter is forever immune to the gaze of that particular dracol-

ich. If it fails, the victim is paralyzed for 2d6 rounds.

Paralyzing Touch (Su): A creature struck by any of this

dracolichs  physical  attacks  must  make  a  DC  24  Fortitude

save or be paralyzed for 2d6 rounds. A successful saving

throw  against  this  effect  does  not  confer  any  immunity

against subsequent attacks.

Spell-Like  Abilities: 3/daycreate/destroy  water (Will

DC 32 negates), ventriloquism (DC 17); 1/dayhallucinatory

terrain (DC 20), veil (DC 22). Caster level 33rd.

Spells: As 13th-level sorcerer.

Tail Sweep (Ex): A dracolich can sweep with its tail as a

standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a diam-

eter of 30 feet. It deals 2d6+21 points of damage to Small or

smaller creatures (Reflex DC 32 half ).

Undead Traits: A dracolich is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, dis-

ease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude

save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not

subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to

its physical ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue,

exhaustion,  or  death  from  massive  damage.  It  cannot  be

raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

Control  Undead  (Sp): Once  every  three  days,  a  dracolich

can use control undead as the spell (caster level 15th). The dra-

colich cannot cast other spells while this ability is in effect.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Since the creatures Charisma score

increases  by  2,  the  save  DC  for  the  dracolichs  frightful

Spells Known (6/8/8/7/7/7/5; save DC 16 + spell level):

CREATING A

DRACOLICH

Dracolich is an acquired

template  that  can  be

added to any evil drag-

on (hereafter referred

to  as  the  base  crea-

ture),  though  drag-

ons  of  old  age  or

older,  with  spell-

casting  abilities,

are preferred.

A dracolich uses

all  the  base  crea-

tures  statistics  and

special  abilities  ex-

cept  as  noted  here.

Size  and  Type:

The  creatures  type

changes to undead. Do

not recalculate the crea-

tures base attack bonus,

saves, or skill points. Size

is unchanged.

Speed: A dracolichs ability to

fly becomes supernatural in nature.

Armor Class: A dracolich gains an additional +2 natural

armor bonus (the hide toughens when the dragon becomes

a dracolich).

Attacks: A dracolich cannot make crush attacks even if it

was capable of doing so when the base creature was alive.

Damage: A dracolich deals an extra 1d6 points of cold

damage on any successful hit. A successful attack may also

paralyze the victim (see below).

Special Attacks: A dracolich retains all the special attack

forms of the base creature, including breath weapon, spell

use, and spell-like abilities. Some of these attack forms are

enhanced, and it also gains some new abilities.

Breath Weapon (Su): Since a dracolich doesnt have a Con-

stitution score, it uses its Charisma modifier to determine

the save DC for its breath weapon instead.

148

Paralyzing Gaze (Su): The

gaze of a dracolichs glow-

ing  eyes  can  paralyze

victims  within  40  feet

who  fail  a  Fortitude

save (DC 10 + 1/2 dra-

colichs  HD  +  draco-

lichs Cha modifier). If

the  saving  throw  is

successful, the charac-

ter  is  forever  immune

to the gaze of that partic-

ular  dracolich.  If  it  fails,

the victim is paralyzed for

2d6 rounds.

Paralyzing  Touch  (Su):

A  creature  struck  by

any  of  a  dracolichs

physical attacks must

make a Fortitude save

(DC  same  as  for  the

dracolichs  paralyzing

gaze) or be paralyzed for

2d6 rounds. A successful

saving throw against this

effect does not confer any

immunity  against  subse-

quent attacks.

Special  Qualities: A  dra-

colich  retains  all  the  special

qualities  of  the  base  creature.

Again, some are enhanced, and

a dracolich gains some new spe-

Dracolich

cial qualities as well.

Damage Reduction: Like a skeleton, a dracolich has damage

reduction 5/bludgeoning.

Immunities: In addition to the standard undead immuni-

ties (see below), a dracolich is immune to polymorph, cold,

and electricity effects.

Invulnerability: If a dracolich is slain, its spirit immedi-

ately  returns  to  its  phylactery.  If  no  dragon-type  corpse

lies within 90 feet for the spirit to possess, the dracolich is

trapped in the phylactery until such a timeif everthat

a  corpse  becomes  available.  A  dracolich  is  difficult  to

destroy.  If  its  spirit  is  currently  contained  in  its  phylac-

tery,  destroying  that  item  when  a  suitable  corpse  is  not

within range effectively destroys the dracolich. Likewise,

an  active  dracolich  is  unable  to  attempt  further  posses-

sions  if  its  phylactery  is  destroyed. The  fate  of  a  disem-

bodied dracolich spiritthat is, a spirit with no body or

phylacteryis  unknown,  but  presumably  it  is  drawn  to

the Lower Planes.

Spell  Resistance  (Ex): Becoming  a  dracolich  increases  the

dragons spell resistance by +3. A dracolich has a minimum

spell resistance of 16.

Undead Traits: A  dracolich  is  immune  to  mind-affecting

effects,  poison,  magic  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,  dis-

ease, death effects, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save

unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject

to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physi-

cal ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaus-

tion, or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and

resurrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to

60 feet (unless the base creature had a greater range).

Saves: As  undead,  dracoliches  are  immune  to  anything

that requires a Fortitude save unless it affects objects.

Abilities: Being undead, the dracolich has no Constitu-

tion score (use its Charisma modifier to determine save DC

against  its  breath  weapon,  tail  sweep,  and  similar  special

attacks).  Its  Charisma  score  is  increased  by  2,  which  in-

creases the DC of the save against its frightful presence and

other  special  abilities.  Otherwise,  the  dracolichs  ability

scores remain the same as the base creatures scores.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature +3.

Alignment: Always evil.

Advancement: Up to +2 HD.

Level Adjustment: Same as base creature +4.

PROTO-DRACOLICHES

A proto-dracolich comes into being when a dracolichs spirit

possesses any body other than the corpse that was created

when  the  dragon  consumed  its  dose  of  dracolich  brew.  A

proto-dracolich has the mind and memories of its original

form  but  the  hit  points  and  immunities  of  a  dracolich.  A

proto-dracolich can neither speak nor cast spells. Further, it

cannot deal extra cold damage, use a breath weapon, or use

frightful  presence  as  a  dracolich.  Its  Strength,  speed,  and

Armor Class are those of the possessed body.

A proto-dracolich transforms into a full-fledged dracolich

in 2d4 days. When the transformation is complete, the draco-

lichs  form  resembles  that  of  its  original  body.  It  can  now

speak,  cast  spells,  and  employ  the  breath  weapon  it  origi-

nally had, in addition to gaining all the abilities of a draco-

lich.  A  dracolich  typically  keeps  a  few  spare  bodies  of  a

suitable size near the hiding place of its phylactery, so that

if its current form is destroyed, it can possess and transform

a new body within a few days.

Most likely the descendant of a union between a fire giant

and a red dragon, this draconic fire giant uses his superior

personality and physical power to lead a tribe of fire giants.

DRACONIC CREATURE

A  draconic  creature  is  descended  from  a  dragon  ancestor,

though  that  ancestor  may  be  many  generations  removed.

Draconic creatures often bear hints of their heritage, such as

slitted  pupils  or  talonlike  nails.  They  are  sometimes  mis-

taken for half-dragons.

It  isnt  necessary  to  determine  the  source  of  a  draconic

creatures heritage (unlike with half-dragons), since the crea-

ture doesnt gain any abilities directly related to its dragon

ancestor  (such  as  resistance  to  a  certain  type  of  energy).

Combat

Draconic fire giants fight much like their giant brethren,

relying either on a greatsword or on thrown boulders heated

by volcanic fire.

Rock Throwing (Ex): The range increment is 120 feet for

this draconic fire giants thrown rocks. The creature can hurl

rocks weighing 40 to 50 pounds each (Small objects) up to

five range increments.

Rock  Catching  (Ex):  This  giant  can  catch  Small,

Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape).

on  attack  rolls,  the  DC  increases  by  that

amount.) The  giant  must  be  ready  for

Dragonkin  are  humanoid  creatures  believed  to  be  distant

cousins of dragons. Found in wild tribes or serving human

masters, their brute strength and sharp claws make them a

deadly threat.

Dragonkin  are  humanoids  of  8  to  9  feet  in  height  with

draconic features. Their scaled hides range from dark yellow

ocher  to  reddish  brown  with  darker  spots  or  bands. Their

faces are decidedly dragonlike, with a long snout, a mane of

thick hair, and small horns swept back behind their heads.

They  have  green  wings  that  lighten  to  gold  or  yellow,  or

sometimes wings that match the color of their bodies.

Dragonkin speak Draconic.

COMBAT

Dragonkin prefer to fight in the air, swooping down to slash

earthbound opponents with their foreclaws. If forced to bring

combat to the ground, dragonkin move in and use their claws

or weapons (they favor longspears and other reach weapons).

Most dragonkin have a strong desire to acquire magic items

(perhaps inherited from their ancestors) and tend to attack

characters  possessing  such  items  in  preference  to  others.  If

possible, a dragonkin grabs a magic item from its opponent

and flees with it, taking the item back to its cave. (Resolve

this as a disarm attempt; since the dragonkin is unarmed, it

holds the item if it wins the opposed check.)

Rake (Ex): Dragonkin make two additional attacks (+10

melee) with their rear claws for 1d6+2 points of damage

each when attacking from the air.

Detect Magic (Su): Dragonkin have the innate ability to

use detect magic as a free action, once per round.

DRAGONKIN AS CHARACTERS

Most dragonkin with character classes are barbarians, and

barbarian is their favored class. However, a handful of dragon-

kin sorcerers have been reported, and their number seems

to be slowly increasing.

DRAGONKIN PLAYER CHARACTERS

Dragonkin characters possess the following racial traits.

 +8 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, +4 Wisdom,

+2 Charisma. Dragonkin are powerful creatures that derive

great  abilities  from  their  ancestral  tie  with  the  dragons.

Large size: 1 penalty to Armor Class, 1 penalty on at-

tack rolls, 4 penalty on Hide checks, lifting and carrying

limits twice those of Medium characters.

Dragonnels  are  power-

ful,  graceful  creatures

often bred and trained as

steeds for mighty paladins

and  knights.  Though  rela-

tively  simpleminded  for

dragons, they are fiercely loyal

to their masters.

A  dragonnel  stands  about  5

feet  tall  at  the  shoulder  and

measures  nearly  10  feet  from

nose  to  tail.  Its  scales  range

from red-brown to a brilliant gold. A

pair of muscled wings sprouts from its shoulders, spanning

up to 30 feet in flight.

In  the  wild,  dragonnels  typically  lair  in  hidden  caves

located far from civilization. Occasionally, a group of up

to four families settles in nearby locations, sharing hunting

and protection duties among the various adults.

Dragonnels speak Draconic.

COMBAT

A dragonnel opens combat with its roar, hoping to frighten

would-be opponents. Once engaged in battle, it fights fear-

lessly, using its claws and bite to shred its enemies.

Roar (Ex): Once per day, a dragonnel can unleash a mighty

roar.  All  enemies  within  a  30-foot-radius  spread  who  can

hear the dragonnel must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or

become shaken for 1d6 rounds.

Training a Dragonnel

Although intelligent, a dragonnel requires training before

it can bear a rider in combat. To be trained, a dragonnel

must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can

be  achieved  through  a  successful  Diplomacy  check).

Training  a  friendly  dragonnel  re-

quires  six  weeks  of  work  and  a

successful  Handle  Animal  check

(DC 30 for a young creature, or DC 35

for a mature creature of three or more

years in age).

ELEMENTAL DRAKE

Elemental  drakes  are  fierce  creatures  distantly  related  to

wyverns, but with a heritage that derives from the Elemen-

tal Planes.

They resemble lithe, sinuous dragons with scale colora-

tions  and  textures  appropriate  to  their  elemental  legacy.

Most measure about 12 feet from nose to tail.

Some  jann  breed  and  train  elemental  drakes  as  steeds.

COMBAT

All  elemental  drakes  share  certain  tendencies  and  tactics.

They  are  all  difficult  to  surprise.  Once  encountered,  they

use Flyby Attack to remain out of reach of their opponents

as  long  as  possible.  Once  engaged,  they  unleash  deadly

melee  attacks  without  mercy.  Their  sinuous  bodies  allow

them  to  focus  all  their  attacks  (including  the  tail  slap)  on

any creature within their reach, even while airborne.

Air drakes are temperamental and cowardly, lording over

those weaker than themselves but fleeing more power-

ful threats.

An air drakes scales are sandy brown, the better to blend

in  with  the  desert  below.  Its  underbelly  shades  to  a  light

blue, making it difficult to spot by viewers on the ground.

The drakes teeth are needle-sharp, as are its claws.

Air  drakes  often  clash  with  dragonnes,  since  the  two

prefer similar lairs and often fight over territory. Air drakes

generally flee from copper dragons or blue dragons unless

they  can  ambush  a  small  one  or  poach  eggs  from  an  un-

guarded nest.

Air  drakes  speak  Draconic  and  Auran  in  a  susurrant

tone,  often  slurring  words  together  or  mixing  the  lan-

guages unintentionally.

Combat

Air drakes use their airborne speed and maneuverability

to  their  advantage,  employing  Flyby  Attack  to  strike  at

slower-moving opponents. They prefer to sneak up on tar-

gets  that  appear  weak,  injured,  or  defenseless. They  can

also  hover  in  place,  kicking  up  a  blinding  sandstorm  to

hamper their foes.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a 1 penalty

on attack and damage rolls against an air drake.

Blinding Sandstorm (Ex): If an air drake hovers close

to the ground in an area with lots of loose debris (such as

a sandy desert), the draft from its wings creates a hemi-

spherical cloud with a radius of 30 feet. The winds so gen-

erated  can  snuff  torches,  small  campfires,  exposed

lanterns,  and  other  small,  open  flames  of  nonmagical

origin. The  cloud  obscures  vision,  and  creatures  caught

within  are  blinded  while  inside  it  and  for  1  round  after

emerging. Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a

DC 14 Concentration check to cast a spell. The air drake

is not immune to this effect, though its Blind-Fight feat

compensates somewhat.

Gaseous  Form  (Su): Once  per  day,  an  air  drake  can

assume gaseous  form as  the  spell  (caster  level  equals

drakes HD).

Skills: Air drakes have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently

checks. *They have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when

airborne in temperate or warm desert environments.

Earth  drakes  are  ponderous  creatures,  slow  of  speech  and

action. When roused, though, they are fearsome to behold.

An earth drakes hide is brownish gray and craggy in tex-

ture, helping it to blend with its natural surroundings. Its

claws are short and sturdy, helping it to burrow through the

earth. Its green eyes glisten like emeralds.

Earth drakes lair underground, often in vaulted caverns

that allow them to spread their wings when desired. They

prefer gems as treasure, and their low Intelligence occa-

sionally leaves them susceptible to crafty characters who

attempt to trade relatively low-value gemstones for valuable

items or information.

Earth drakes speak both Draconic and Terran, but slowly,

with occasional pauses in speech that give evidence of their

low intellect.

Combat

Unlike other drakes, earth drakes prefer to remain land-

bound, only using flight to escape from danger. When faced

with  multiple  opponents,  an  earth  drake  begins  combat

with  its  tremor  ability,  and  then  attacks  fallen  targets.

Because of its poor eyesight (compared to other drakes), it

relies on tremorsense to keep track of opponents.

Earth Mastery (Ex): An earth drake gains a +1 bonus on

attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the

ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the drake

takes a 4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modi-

fiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Tremor  (Su): Once  per  day,  an  earth  drake  can  cause  a

tremor at a point where it touches the ground. All creatures

standing  on  the  ground  within  60  feet  of  the  drake  must

make a DC 20 Reflex save or fall down. Airborne or water-

borne creatures dont suffer any ill effects, and the tremor

doesnt deal any structural damage.

Skills: Earth  drakes  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks. *They have an additional +4 racial bonus on Hide

checks when in rocky environments (such as mountain ter-

rain or underground).

Fire  drakes  range  in  color  from  blood  red  to  a  dazzling

vermilion  and  are  often  mistaken  for  young  red  dragons,

aided by the fact that the two creatures share similar terri-

tories. They enjoy capitalizing on this mistaken identity,

bargaining that most people would do anything to avoid

angering  a  red  dragon. The  eyes  of  a  fire  drake  are

fiery yellow.

Ice drakes are vicious scavengers that lair in cold or arctic

lands.

The  scales  of  an  ice  drake  are  ivory  in  color,  with  occa-

sional tinges of ice-blue. Ice drakes have short, stocky limbs

and a wide, flat tail that helps them climb on icy surfaces.

Ice drakes give large predators a wide berth, preferring to

wait  until  after  such  creatures  have  finished  feasting  to

move in on the remains. They arent afraid to chase off small-

er predators such as wolves.

An  ice  drake  speaks  Draconic  and  either  Auran  or

Aquan  (50%  chance  of  either). The  creatures  speak  halt-

ingly,  but  woe  to  any  who  mistake  this  trait  for  lack  of

intelligence.

Combat

Unless  it  is  desperate,  an  ice  drake  only  takes  on  living

opponents smaller than itself, and preferably from hiding. It

focuses its attacks on an individual, using its freezing touch

to weaken that opponent to the point where it can grapple

it and fly away.

Freezing Touch (Su): Anyone hit by an ice drakes claw

attack takes an extra 1d6 points of cold damage and must

succeed  on  a  DC  18  Reflex  save  or  also  take  1  point  of

Strength damage.

Skills: An ice drake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It

can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if dis-

tracted  or  endangered.  It  can  use  the  run  action  while

swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Ice drakes

have a +2 racial bonus on Balance checks and on Climb

checks. *They have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks in

icy environments.

The  mightiest  of  the  elemental  drakes,  the  magma  drake

smolders with evil power.

The thick, scaled hide of a magma drake resembles cool-

ing lava, with obsidian claws and gleaming crimson eyes.

Though these creatures appear slow and clumsy, they move

with surprising agility.

Magma drakes generally live in deep caves or in volcanic

craters,  particularly  those  with  nearby  lakes  or  rivers  or

molten  rock.  They  often  ally  with  efreet  or  salamanders.

A  magma  drake  speaks  Draconic  and  either  Ignan  or

Terran (50% chance of either). The creatures voices rumble

with power, suggestive of their volcanic heritage.

Combat

A magma drake wastes no time toying with its prey, pre-

ferring to pin a grappled target and watch it burn to death.

If  it  has  room  to  fly,  it  uses  Flyby  Attack  to  grapple  an

opponent and bring it somewhere where it can dispatch it

at its leisure.

Burn (Ex): Those grappled by a magma drake must suc-

ceed on a DC 22 Reflex save or catch fire. The fire burns for

1d4 rounds (see Catching on Fire, page 303 of the Dungeon

Masters Guide). A burning creature can take a move action to

put out the flame (but not while grappled).

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a magma drake

must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity.

Skills: Magma  drakes  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks and on Hide checks.

The ooze drake is a disgusting and vile creature that relies

on stealth and cunning to defeat its prey.

The  slimy,  gray-green  scales  of  an  ooze  drake  drip  with

caustic goo. The creatures claws and teeth are dirty gray, and

its eyes are a pale, watery yellow.

Ooze drakes live in dank swamps and stinking marshes,

or in dark caverns beneath the earth. They occasionally take

bands of lizardfolk or troglodytes under their wing, though

their patience with such lesser beings is limited.

An ooze drake speaks Draconic and either Aquan or Terran

(50% chance of either). Its speech is slow and slurred, as if it

is speaking with a mouth half full of water.

Combat

Thanks to their vision abilities, ooze drakes can detect poten-

tial prey from some distance away. They approach either by

air or underwater, as appropriate, grab a target, and either

take  flight  or  pull  it  underwater  with  them. They  disdain

anything resembling a fair fight.

Acid (Ex): An ooze drakes body exudes acid at all times.

This acid deals 1d6 points of extra acid damage whenever it

hits in melee or, when grappling, during each round when

maintains  a  hold.  Only  stone  is  unaffected  by  this  acid.

156

Creatures or weapons striking an ooze drake also take this

damage (no save allowed).

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, an ooze drake

must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity.

Amphibious  (Ex): Although  ooze  drakes  are  aquatic,

they can survive indefinitely on land.

Skills: An ooze drake has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim

check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It

can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if dis-

tracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swim-

ming,  provided  it  swims  in  a  straight  line.  Ooze  drakes

have a +2 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

The racial bonus on Hide checks improves to +4 when in

marsh terrain.

Smoke  drakes  are  patient,  cunning  predators  that  follow

prey for miles before striking with surprise.

A smoke drakes smooth scales are charcoal gray in color,

with occasional highlights of dark red and a dorsal ridge of

ebony. Its eyes glow like red-hot embers, particularly when

the creature is angry or in battle.

The  most  territorial  of  the  drakes,  the  smoke  drake  is

known  to  hold  a  grudge  against  those  who  wrong  it. The

creatures  are  skilled  trackers,  able  to  follow  prey  for  long

distances if necessary.

A  smoke  drake  speaks  Draconic  and  either  Auran  or

Ignan (50% chance of either). The creature rarely raises its

voice above a hissing whisper, even when angered.

Combat

Once  a  smoke  drake  has  tracked  down  its  prey,  it  opens

combat with its smoky breath, blinding its targets. It then

attacks a lone or separated individual, focusing its strikes on

that creature until it is incapacitated or the drake must flee.

If faced with a foe it cant easily defeat, it retreats to safety,

only to follow and strike again later.

Breath Weapon (Su): As a standard action once every 1d4

rounds, a smoke drake can breathe a hazy cloud of smoke in

a  30-ft.-radius  spread  that  provides  concealment  (20%  miss

chance) to all creatures within. Thanks to its blindsense, the

drake ignores this miss chance. The haze lasts for 1 minute,

but can be blown away by a moderate wind (11+ mph) in 4

rounds or a strong wind (21+ mph) in 1 round. This breath

weapon is not usable underwater.

Once per day, a smoke drake can exhale an incendiary cloud

rather than a hazy cloud. The cloud provides concealment as

the  hazy  cloud  does,  but  the  white-hot  embers  suspended

within the incendiary cloud deal 2d6 points of fire damage to

everything  within  it  each  round  (Reflex  DC  19  half ).  The

incendiary  breath  is  otherwise  identical  to  the  haze  breath.

Skills: Smoke  drakes  have  a  +2  racial  bonus  on  Move

Silently checks and on Search checks. *They have a +4 racial

bonus on Hide checks in areas of shadow or darkness.

The faerie dragon is a mischievous creature that often allies

with fey creatures such as pixies.

A  faerie  dragons  scales  are  iridescent,  reflecting  all  the

colors of the rainbow. Its butterflylike wings are a beautiful

platinum. It bears a sharp-toothed grin at all times except

when  attacked  in  anger.  It  has  a  long,  prehensile  tail  that

constantly flicks and twitches, particularly when the crea-

ture is happy or excited.

Faerie dragon

Water drakes lay claim to areas of coastline or island chains,

preying on sailors and any other creatures foolish enough to

enter their territory.

A water drakes silver-blue scales appear more like those of

a fish than a reptile, smooth and shimmering. Its sleek body

cuts through the water with decent speed; however, it cant

keep  up  with  most  other  aquatic  creatures,  so  it  tends  to

remain at shallow depths so it can take to the air as needed.

Dragon turtles and water drakes often share similar terri-

tory, though a lone drake is no match for such an opponent.

Only groups of water drakes are brave enough to face a foe

of such power. Water drakes hate bronze dragons, but fear

them even more.

Water drakes speak Draconic and Aquan. Their speech is

burbling and pleasant to the ear.

Combat

Water drakes prefer to fight their battles beneath the waves,

to take advantage of their combat prowess there. They take

wing only to snatch victims (such as off the deck of a ship),

using Flyby Attack to grab a target and return to the water

in a single swoop.

Drench  (Ex): A  water  drakes  touch  puts  out  torches,

campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of non-

magical origin if these are Large or smaller. The drake can

dispel magical fire it touches as by a dispel magic spell cast by

a sorcerer whose level equals the drakes HD.

Water Mastery (Ex): A water drake gains a +1 bonus on

attack  and  damage  rolls  if  both  it  and  its  opponent  are

touching  water.  If  the  opponent  or  the  drake  is  land-

bound, the drake takes a 4 penalty on attack and dam-

age  rolls.  (These  modifiers  are  not  included  in  the

statistics block.)

Amphibious (Ex): Although water drakes are aquatic,

they can survive indefinitely on land.

Skills: A  water  drake  has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  any

Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim

check, even if distracted or endangered. It can use

the run action while swimming, provided it swims

in  a  straight  line.  Water  drakes  have  a  +4  racial

bonus on Spot checks. *They have a +4 racial bonus

on Hide checks when submerged.

Faerie dragons generally keep their distance from intrud-

ers into their forest homes, preferring to lead such creatures

away rather than confront them directly. It is not uncom-

mon to encounter them near the tree of a dryad, the lake of

a nymph, or the lair of a tribe of sprites, since such creatures

get along well with one another.

Faerie  dragons  speak  Draconic  and  Sylvan.  They  can

converse with any animal. Some also learn Common, Elven,

or Gnome.

COMBAT

A  faerie  dragon  prefers  to

deal  with  enemies  from

afar,  using  its  spell-like

abilities  to  confuse

and bewilder oppo-

nents. If this tactic

doesnt work, it summons

one  or  more  allies  or  ani-

mates  nearby  objects  to

fight  for  it.  It  uses  charm

monster, entangle, and glit-

terdust to neutralize dan-

gerous  foes.  If  seriously

pressed, a faerie dragon reluctantly

enters melee, and then only after

using  its  breath  weapon  to

daze its opponents.

Breath  Weapon  (Su):

A faerie dragon has one

type  of  breath  weapon,

a 20-foot cone of eupho-

ria gas. Any creature with-

in  the  area  of  the  gas

must succeed on a DC 15

Fang dragons are greedy, rapacious,

and cunning creatures.

Their  bodies  are  armored

with bony plates that rise into

projecting  spurs  at  limb  joints

and  end  in  long,  forked  tails

tipped  with  a  pair  of  scythelike

bone  blades. They  fly  poorly,  but

can  rise  with  a  single  clap  of  their

wings  to  lunge  forward. Their  body

plates are a mottled gray and brown,

their  wings  are  small  but  muscled,

and their eyes tend to be glittering

red  or  orange.  Fang  dragons

heads are adorned with many

small horns or spikes.

Fang  dragons  prefer  to

seek  food  far  from  their

lairs,  typically  walling  up

their  residences  with  huge

boulders to keep out intruders

in their absence. They speak snip-

pets  of  many  languages  and  bargain  to

avoid hopeless or hard battles. They are prone

to random violence and outbursts of rage.

Fang  dragons  eat  all  manner  of  fresh  meat.  They

especially enjoy the flesh of intelligent mammals.

Combat

Fang dragons are masters of physical combat, and every part

of their body is lethal. They have a tendency to play with

their food in a cruel way.

Young adult and older fang dragons natural weapons are

treated  as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Ability  Drain  (Su):  A  fang  dragon  does  not  have  a

breath  weapon,  but  its  bite  drains  Constitution  if  the

victim fails a Fortitude save. The number of Constitution

points drained and the saving throw DC are given on the

accompanying table.

Increased  Damage  (Ex):  Because  of  their  sharp  claws,

teeth, and scales, fang dragons deal damage as if they were

one  size  category  larger.  This  ability  does  not  enable  the

dragon to use attack forms normally not allowed to a dragon

of its size. Thus, a very young (Small) fang dragon deals 1d8

points of damage on a bite attack and 1d6 points of damage

on  a  claw  attack  (as  if  it  were  Medium),  but  cannot  make

wing attacks.

Trip (Ex): A fang dragon that hits with a claw or tail attack

can attempt to trip the opponent as a free action (see page

158 of the Players Handbook). If the attempt fails, the oppo-

nent cannot react to trip the dragon.

Sound  Imitation  (Ex):  A  fang  dragon  can  mimic  any

voice or sound it has heard, anytime it likes. Listeners must

succeed  on  a  Will  save  (DC  equal  to  that  of  the  dragons

This ghostly green dragon still haunts its dark underground

or forest lair, longing for the return of the hoard it guarded

in life. Tormented by its inability to seek out additional trea-

sure, it waits . . . and plots.

Combat

Should intruders enter its lair, the ghostly green dragon

learns as much as it can about them before commencing

161

Of  the  many  kinds

of  felldrakes,  few  are  as

powerful  as  the  spiked  felldrake.

Its size and strength place it in the front

line of important battles, and some mighty knights or pal-

adins employ the spiked felldrake as a steed.

Felldrakes speak Draconic and Sylvan.

Combat

A  spiked  felldrake  can  stand  up  to  terrible  punishment

while dealing out plenty of its own with swordlike claws.

The spikes on its tail are not just for showit can project

them in a hail of deadly fire at approaching enemies. With

its scent and vision abilities, a spiked felldrake can root out

even hidden enemies reliably.

Spiked Felldrakes as Special Mounts

At the DMs option, a paladin of 11th level or higher can call

a spiked felldrake as her special mount. For the purposes of

the mounts bonus Hit Dice, natural armor, Strength adjust-

ment, Intelligence score, and special powers, treat the pal-

adin as if she were six levels lower than actual.

GHOSTLY DRAGON

A ghost template is found in the Monster Manual. The ghostly

dragon  template  presented  here  provides  an  alternative

method  of  creating  ghostly  dragons  to  have  them  retain

more of their innate draconic power and deadliness.

Ghostly dragons are most often created when a power-

ful dragon is slain and its hoard looted. In such a case, the

ghostly dragon can only be laid to rest by returning its lost

treasure  (or  the  equivalent  value)  to  the  creatures  lair.

(You can estimate the ghostly dragons hoard by using the

average treasure value for an encounter with the dragon,

were it still alive.) Should this occur, the ghostly dragon

settles upon the new hoard and disappears into nothing-

ness, taking the hoard with it to the afterlife.

CREATING A GHOSTLY DRAGON

Ghostly is an acquired template that can be added to any

dragon. The  creature  (referred  to  here-

after  as  the  base  dragon)

must  have  a  Charisma

score  of  at  least  8.

A  ghostly  drag-

on uses all the

base  dragons

statistics  and

special  abili-

ties  except  as

noted here.

Size and Type: The

creatures type changes

to  undead.  It  gains  the

incorporeal  subtype.  Size  is

unchanged.

Hit  Dice: The  base  dragons  Hit

Dice  remain  the  same,  but  it  loses

any  Constitution  bonus  to  its  hit

points (see Abilities, below). How-

ever, a ghostly dragon gains bonus

hit points equal to twice its HD.

Speed: A  ghostly  dragon  has  a  fly

speed of 30 feet, unless the base dragon

has  a  higher  fly  speed.  Regardless  of  its  fly

speed, the ghostly dragon has perfect maneuverability.

Armor Class: A ghostly dragons natural armor bonus is

the same as the base dragon but applies only to ethereal en-

counters. When a ghostly dragon manifests (see below), its

162

natural armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus

equal to its Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.

Attacks: A  ghostly  dragon  retains  all  the  attacks  of  the

base dragon, although those relying on physical contact do

not affect nonethereal creatures. It also gains an incorporeal

touch attack, which it can use with any body part normally

capable of attacking (which may include the bite, a claw, a

wing, or a tail). Apply a ghostly dragons Dexterity modifier,

not its Strength modifier, to its incorporeal touch attack roll.

Damage: Against  ethereal  creatures,  a  ghostly  dragon

uses the base dragons damage ratings. Against nonethereal

creatures, a ghostly dragon usually cannot deal physical dam-

age but can use its special attacks, if any, when it manifests

(see below).

Special Attacks: A ghostly dragon retains all the special

attacks of the base creature, although those relying on phys-

ical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures. The ghost

gains  the  manifestation  ability  plus  other  special  attacks

described  below.  Saves  against  a  ghostly  dragons  special

attacks (including those of the base dragon) have a DC of 10

+ 1/2 ghostly dragons HD + ghostly dragons Cha modifier

unless otherwise noted.

Breath Weapon (Su): In addition to any breath weapons it

had in life, a ghostly dragon gains a breath weapon that cre-

ates a cone-shaped cloud of gray mist. Any creature caught

within  is  affected  by  a  catastrophic  ability  drain,  perma-

nently losing a number of points of Strength, Dexterity, and

Constitution equal to the base dragons age category (Forti-

tude negates). A creature that successfully saves against this

effect  cannot  be  affected  by  this  breath  weapon  from  the

same ghostly dragon for 24 hours (though it can be

affected by the ghostly dragons other

breath weapons as normal). This

breath weapon can be used

once every 1d4 rounds and

a  maximum  of  three

times per day.

Energy Drain (Su):

With a successful

touch  attack,  a

ghostly  dragon

bestows

two

negative  levels

on  the  target.  A

ghostly  dragon

does not bestow

negative  levels  with

any  of  its  natural  at-

tacks (claws, bite, wing,

tail, and so on).

Ghostly green dragon

Manifestation (Su): A ghostly dragon dwells on the

Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot

affect or be affected by anything in the material world.

When a ghostly dragon manifests, it partly enters the Mate-

rial Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Mate-

rial Plane. A manifested ghostly dragon can be harmed only

by  other  incorporeal  creatures,  magic  weapons,  or  spells,

with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal

source. A manifested ghostly dragon can pass through solid

objects  at  will,  and  its  own  attacks  pass  through  armor.  A

manifested ghostly dragon always moves silently.

A  manifested  ghostly  dragon  can  strike  with  its  touch

attack or with a ghost touch weapon. A manifested ghostly

dragon remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where is it

not incorporeal. The creature can be attacked by opponents

on  either  the  Material  Plane  or  the  Ethereal  Plane.  The

ghostly dragons incorporeality helps protect it from foes on

the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.

When a spellcasting ghostly dragon is not manifested and

is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on

the Material Plane, but they work normally against ethereal

targets. When  a  spellcasting  ghostly  dragon  manifests,  its

spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect tar-

gets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on

touch.  A  manifested  ghostly  dragons  touch  spells  dont

work on nonethereal targets.

A ghostly dragon has two home planes, the Material Plane

and  the  Ethereal  Plane.  It  is  not  considered  extraplanar

when on either of these planes.

Withering  (Su):  A  ghostly  dragons  touch  acts  as  a  rod  of

withering,  dealing  1d4  points  of  Strength  damage  and  1d4

points  of  Constitution  damage  with  a  successful  touch

attack (Fortitude negates). If a ghostly dragon scores a criti-

cal hit, the damage is ability drain instead.

Special  Qualities: A  ghostly  dragon  has  all  the  special

qualities  of  the  base  dragon  (except  for  any  subtypes  pos-

sessed). If the base dragon had any immunities based on its

subtype  (such  as  immunity  to  fire  for  the  fire  subtype),  it

keeps those immunities despite losing the subtype. It also

gains the incorporeal subtype (see page 310 of the Monster

Manual) and the special qualities described below.

Rejuvenation (Su): In most cases, its difficult to destroy a

ghostly  dragon  through  simple  combat:  The  destroyed

spirit  will  often  restore  itself  in  2d4  days.  Even  the  most

powerful  spells  are  usually  only  temporary  solutions.  A

ghostly dragon that would otherwise be destroyed returns

to  its  old  haunts  with  a  successful  level  check  (1d20  +

ghosts HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid

of a ghostly dragon for sure is to determine the reason for its

existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in

peace.  The  exact  means  varies  with  each  spirit  and  may

require a good deal of research.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A ghostly dragon has +4 turn resist-

ance (see page 317 of the Monster Manual).

Undead  Traits: A  ghostly  dragon  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stun-

ning,  disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless.

It  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal  damage,  ability

damage  to  its  physical  ability  scores,  ability  drain,  energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

It has darkvision out to 60 feet (unless the base creature had

a greater range).

Saves: As  undead,  ghostly  dragons  are  immune  to  any-

thing that requires a Fortitude save unless it affects objects.

Abilities: As  the  base  dragon,  except  that  the  ghostly

dragon  has  no  Constitution  score,  and  its  Charisma  score

increases by 4.

Skills: Ghostly dragons have a +8 racial bonus on Hide,

Listen, Search, and Spot checks.

Organization: Solitary.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base dragon +2.

Treasure: None.

Alignment: Usually same as the base dragon.

Advancement: Up to +2 HD.

Level Adjustment: Same as the base dragon +5.

GOLEM

Golems  are  magically  created  automatons  of  great  power.

Constructing one involves the use of mighty magic and ele-

mental forces.

Normally, the animating force for a golem is a spirit from

the  Elemental  Plane  of  Earth.  However,  the  three  golems

presented  herethe  dragonbone  golem,  the  drakestone

golem, and the ironwyrm golemare instead imbued with

the  life  force  of  a  mighty  dragon. The  process  of  creation

binds the unwilling spirit to the artificial body and subjects

it to the will of the golems creator.

In all three cases, these golems are constructed in forms

traditionally  associated  with  dragonsquadrupedal  crea-

tures with long necks and tails, claws, and wings. Though

these constructs are built with wings, they are incapable of

flight (but the golems can use their wings for attacks).

Golems  have  no  language  of  their  own,  but  they  can

understand simple instructions from their creators.

COMBAT

Golems are tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as

well. Despite their former existence as highly intelligent

dragons, these golems are mindless and thus can do noth-

ing  in  the  absence  of  orders  from  their  creators.  They

always follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of

any strategy or tactics. They are emotionless in combat and

cannot be provoked.

If a golems creator is within 60 feet of it and both visible

and  audible  to  it,  he  or  she  can  command  the  creature

directly. An uncommanded golem usually follows its last

instruction to the best of its ability, though it returns any

attacks made against it. The creator can give the golem a

simple program (such as Remain in this area and attack all

creatures  or  creatures  of  a  specific  kind  that  enter,  or

Ring a gong and attack, or the like) to govern its actions

in his or her absence.

Since golems do not need to breathe and are immune to

most  forms  of  energy,  they  can  press  an  attack  against  an

opponent almost anywhere, from the bottom of the sea to

the frigid top of the tallest mountain.

Construct  Traits:  A  golem  has  immunity  to  poison,

magic  sleep  effects,  paralysis,  stunning,  disease,  death

effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects (charms,

compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and

any  effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save  unless  it  also

works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical

hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue,

exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it

can  be  repaired.  It  has  darkvision  out  to  60  feet  and  low-

light vision.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): Golems have immunity to mag-

ical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.

A dragonbone golem is crafted from the skeletons of one or

more dragons, wired together into a gruesome whole. It typ-

ically measures about 10 feet in length and stands 5 feet tall

at the shoulder. It is easily mistaken for a skeletal dragon or

a dracolich (see those entries in this chapter)and, in fact,

is often built by necromancersbut it is a construct, not an

undead creature.

Combat

A dragonbone golem wades into combat without hesitation,

weakening opponents resolve with its fear aura.

Fear Aura (Su): A dragonbone golem radiates an aura of

fear in a 60-foot-radius burst. Any creature with fewer HD

than the dragonbone golem is shaken (Will DC 20 negates).

The effect lasts for as long as the creature remains within

range  and  for  2d6  rounds  afterward.  A  creature  that  suc-

ceeds on the Will save to resist is immune to that dragon-

bone golems fear aura for 24 hours.

Magic Immunity (Ex): A dragonbone golem has immu-

nity to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects

and abilities.

Construction

A  dragonbone  golems  body  must  be  crafted  from  the

A  drakestone  golem  appears  at  first  glance  to  be  a  beauti-

fully crafted statue of a dragon, 12 feet long and 6 feet tall at

the  shoulder.  Only  when  it  animates,  its  stone  scales  rip-

pling like muscled flesh and its eyes gleaming with amber

light, do its enemies realize their danger.

Combat

A drakestone golem opens any combat with its petrifying

breath,  but  otherwise  relies  on  its  devastating  physical

attacks to reduce foes to a pulp.

Petrifying Breath (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds, a drake-

stone golem can exhale a 30-foot cone of petrifying gas (For-

titude DC 27 negates).

Immunity  to  Magic  (Ex): A  drakestone  golem  is

immune  to  all  spells,  spell-like  abilities,  and  supernatural

effects, except as follows. A transmute rock to mud spell slows

it (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw,

while transmute mud to rock heals all its lost hit points.

A  drakestone  golems  body  is  intricately  chiseled  from  a

single block of high-quality stone, usually granite, weighing

at least 3,000 pounds and costing 5,000 gp. It must also be

An ironwyrm golem is an animated, self-contained furnace

built into the shape of a dragon. It measures up to 15 feet in

length and typically stands 7 to 8 feet high at the shoulder.

Smoke trails from its nostrils except when the creature is at

rest, and when animate, it exudes a palpable heat.

Combat

The ironwyrm golem softens up foes with its fiery breath

and then uses its formidable strength to destroy its foes in

melee. It can even use this breath weapon on itself, in order

to restore hit points or negate slow effects.

Breath Weapon (Su): 60-ft. cone, every 1d4 rounds, 20d10

fire, Reflex DC 30 half. The breath weapon type remains

the same regardless of the dragon spirit contained within.

Immunity to Magic (Ex): An ironwyrm golem is immune

to  all  spells,  spell-like  abilities,  and  supernatural  effects,

except as follows. A cold effect slows it (as the slow spell) for 3

rounds, with no saving throw. A fire effect breaks any slow

HALF-DRAGON

The half-dragon template on page 146 of the Monster Manual

presents special attacks and special qualities for half-dragon

versions of the ten varieties of true dragons described in that

book. The information here expands that list to include all

true dragons published in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS products

to date.

The  Half-Dragon  Breath  Weapons  table  below  presents

the breath weapon type for each half-dragon derived from

one  of  the  various  true  dragons  that  have  appeared  in

Monsters  of  Faern,  Monster  Manual  II,  Fiend  Folio,  and  this

book. A half-dragons line-shaped breath weapon is always

5  feet  high,  5  feet  wide,  and  60  feet  long.  A  half-dragons

cone-shaped breath weapon is always 30 feet long, 30 feet

high, and 30 feet wide.

The Half-Dragon Immunities and Resistances table below

presents  the  immunities  and/or  resistances  possessed  by

half-dragons descended from these true dragons.

The lung dragons, presented in Oriental Adventures, are  a

special case. Many either dont have breath weapons or lack

immunities (or both), so half-dragons descended from these

parents gain special attacks and special qualities as noted on

the Lung Half-Dragons table below.

166

Cause Rain (Su): A half-chiang lung can breathe

storm clouds three times per day, causing

rain. The rain lasts for 2d4 hours and

extends in a 2-mile radius centered

on the half-dragon.

Roar  (Ex): A  half-li  lung  can

roar three times per day, creating a

sound resembling metal scraping

against  stone.  All  creatures

within  60  feet  are  automati-

cally  deafened  for  1  round

(no saving throw).

Water  Fire  (Su): Three

times  per  day,  a  half-pan

lung or half-shen lung touching

or submerged in water can sur-

round  itself  in  an  aura  of

ghostly,  flickering,  multi-

colored flames that cause

damage  to  any  creature

touching it. Any creature

striking  the  half-dragon

with  a  natural  weapon  or  a

melee weapon deals normal damage, but

at the same time the attacker takes 1d6

points of fire damage. Lung dragons and

HOARD SCARAB

A hoard scarab is an eyeless, beetlelike creature that hides in

piles of treasure. Thanks to its size and its silver or golden

shell, it looks much like a coin when dormant (though close

observation reveals its nature). A swarm resembles a pile of

gold and silver pieces.

Hoard scarabs are often found hidden

among the treasure of a dragon (hence

their name). They often live in a symbi-

otic  relationship  with  a  dragon,

keeping  the  wyrms  scales  clean

of troublesome vermin (the drag-

ons  natural  armor  keeps  it  safe

from the scarabs burrow ability).

Hoard  scarabs  are  unintelli-

gent and cannot speak or under-

stand any languages.

An individual hoard scarab seeks to burrow into its targets

flesh.  However,  hoard  scarabs  prefer  to  attack  en  masse,

swarming over a target and chewing it apart.

Burrow  (Ex): If  a  hoard  scarab  hits  a  Small  or  larger

living  creature  with  a  bite  attack  (or  if  a  hoard  scarab

swarm hits with its swarm attack), on its next turn it can

attempt  to  burrow  into  the  targets  flesh. The  target  may

attempt a Reflex save (DC 11 for an individual scarab, or

DC 14 for a swarm) to prevent the hoard scarab from bur-

rowing  in  (a  helpless  creature  cant  prevent  the  burrow-

ing). If the save fails, each round thereafter the target takes

1d2  points  of  Constitution  damage  (from  an  individual

scarab)  or  2d4  points  of  Constitution  damage  (from  a

swarm of scarabs).

A hoard scarab doesnt leave a target until the target is

dead. Once a hoard scarab has burrowed into its target, it can

be destroyed by any effect that would cure a disease, such

as remove  disease or heal. (A  single  spell  eliminates  all  bur-

rowing hoard scarabs, though it gives no protection against

further burrowings.)

Creatures  with  immunity  to  disease,  as  well  as  those

with a natural armor bonus (including enhancement) of

+3  or  better,  are  immune  to  a  hoard  scarabs  burrowing

attack.

Distraction (Ex): Any living creature vulnerable to the

swarms  damage  that  begins  its  turn  with  a  swarm  in  its

square is nauseated for 1 round (Fortitude DC 14 negates).

Even with a successful save, spellcasting or concentrating

on spells within the area of a swarm requires a Concentra-

tion check (DC 20 + spell level). Using any skill involving

patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration

check. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and

no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits

or flanking. A hoard scarab

swarm  is  immune  to  all

weapon damage.

Reducing  a  swarm  to

0  hit  points  or  fewer

causes the swarm to

break  up,  though

damage taken un-

til that point does

not  degrade  its

ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered

or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be

tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple

an opponent.

A  hoard  scarab  swarm  is  immune  to  any  spell  or  effect

that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-

target  spells  such  as  disintegrate).  A  swarm  takes  a  10

penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that affect

an area, such as many evocation spells or splash weapons. If

such  as  attack  does  not  allow  a  saving  throw,  the  swarm

takes double damage instead.

Hoard scarab swarms are susceptible to high winds such

as that created by a gust of wind spell. For purposes of deter-

mining the effects of wind on a hoard scarab swarm, treat

the swarm as a creature of Fine size. Wind effects deal 1d6

points of nonlethal damage to the swarm per spell level (or

Hit  Die  of  the  originating  creature,  in  the  case  of  effects

such  as  an  air  elementals  whirlwind).  A  swarm  rendered

unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disor-

ganized  and  dispersed,  and  does  not  re-form  until  its  hit

points exceed its nonlethal damage.

For full information about the swarm subtype, see pages

315 and 316 of the Monster Manual.

Vermin Traits: A hoard scarab is immune to all mind-

affecting  effects  (charms,  compulsions,  phantasms,  pat-

terns, and morale effects). It also has darkvision out to

60 feet.

Skills: Hoard scarabs have a +4 racial bonus on Listen

checks.  Hoard  scarabs  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Hide

checks  when  they  are  concealed  among  coins  (at  least  10

coins for an individual scarab, or at least 10,000 coins for a

swarm).  A  hoard  scarab has  a  +8  racial  bonus  on  Climb

checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks,

even if rushed or threatened.

LANDWYRM

Landwyrms are cunning, wingless predatory dragons who

ruthlessly scour their environment for prey. While some

claim they represent a primitive, ancestral form of the true

dragons, most dismiss such claims. Regardless of its origin,

each variety of landwyrm is singularly adapted to its natu-

ral environment.

All  landwyrms  lack  wings,  but  their  body  shapes  vary

by  type,  from  serpentine  (desert  landwyrms)  to  craggy

(mountain  landwyrms). They  have  large,  powerful  jaws,

clawed  fore  and  hind  limbs,  and  thick  scales  whose  col-

oration matches that of their natural environment.

Landwyrms  have  stores  of  great  knowledge  about  their

environment, and if approached peacefully and respectfully,

they can be sources of great wisdom.

Landwyrms can make excellent steeds, though they are

strong-willed and independent, so even the least intelli-

gent must be treated with great respect, or it will turn on

its rider.

COMBAT

Each type of landwyrm has different combat tactics, though

most rely on stealth to surprise their opponents. They are

skilled trackers, and they see nothing wrong with fleeing a

battle only to follow their prey and attack again later.

Frightful Presence (Ex): Much like the chromatic and

metallic  dragons,  landwyrms  can  unsettle  their  foes  with

their mere presence. This ability takes effect automatically

whenever  the  landwyrm  attacks  or  charges.  Creatures

within the specified radius are subject to the effect if they

are at least one size category smaller than the landwyrm and

have fewer HD than the landwyrm.

make them look like enormous serpents, until one notices

the  powerful  front  and  rear  claws  normally  held  tight

against the body.

Desert landwyrms often lair in ancient tombs or other

ruined buildings, which leads to their nickname of tomb

dragon. They  are  quite  capable  of  defending  their  lairs

from  any  but  the  largest  blue  dragons,  with  whom  they

often clash over territory. They respond best when offered

valuables.

Combat

Thanks to its hardy nature, a desert landwyrm can lie buried

in the sand for weeks at a time waiting for prey, with only

its  rocky  eye-ridge  protruding.  When  potential  victims

approach, the landwyrm bursts forth, creating a sandstorm

to blind its prey. It ignores panicked opponents, knowing

that it can track them down later if needed.

Desert Adaptation (Ex): Desert landwyrms can go with-

out water for a number of days equal to their Constitution

score. Even after this point, they need only make a Con-

stitution check each day (rather than each hour, as noted

in Starvation and Thirst, page 304 of the Dungeon Masters

Guide) to avoid taking nonlethal damage from thirst. They

take no nonlethal damage from heat exposure (though they

take damage from fire normally). They suffer no ill effects

from being caught in dust storms or sandstorms (including

their own sandstorm attack; see below).

Frightful Presence (Ex): 160-ft. radius, HD 31 or fewer,

Will DC 31 negates.

Sandstorm (Ex): As a standard action, a desert landwyrm

can create a small sandstorm by kicking up sand, dust, and

debris  in  a  120-foot-radius  spread  centered  on  itself.  Any

creature in the affected area must succeed on a DC 33 Forti-

tude  save  or  be  blinded  for  1d6  rounds. This  ability  only

functions in deserts or areas with similar quantities of dust

or sand.

Skills: Desert landwyrms have a +4 racial bonus on Spot

checks. *They have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks when in

temperate or warm desert environments. This bonus on Hide

checks  increases  to  +8  when  the  landwyrm  is  immobile.

The noblest of the landwyrms, the forest landwyrm sees itself

as a protector of its woodland territory. It takes only what it

needs to survive, and ruthlessly hunts down enemy predators.

The hide of a forest landwyrm bears a mottled pattern of

green and brown, although in autumn it takes on aspects

of  yellow  or  even  red  to  blend  in.  When  threatened,  a

forest landwyrm expands a leafy frill of scales from its neck,

making it appear even larger than it is.

Forest landwyrms brook no competitors within their ter-

ritory,  chasing  out  animals,  vermin,  and  even  humanoids

who encroach therein. However, they are open to peaceful

discussions with those who convince the landwyrm they do

not pose a threat. In rare instances, a forest landwyrm may

befriend local gnomes, serving as the unofficial protector of

a nearby village.

Forest  landwyrms  speak  Draconic,  Gnome,  Sylvan,  and

Common.

Combat

Forest landwyrms prefer to strike from hiding, attacking

unwary  opponents  with  its  claws  and  bite.  Such  attacks

may come from below (thanks to the landwyrms burrow-

ing ability) or above (as they are quite capable of climbing

large trees).

Commune  with  Nature  (Sp): Once  per  day  a  forest  land-

wyrm can use commune with nature. Caster level 16th.

Hill landwyrms are slow-witted bullies who rely on intimida-

tion and displays of physical prowess to subdue their enemies.

A  hill  landwyrms  coloration  varies  with  its  surround-

ings.  Some  are  slate-gray,  while  others  have  brown,  red-

brown, or tan scales. They appear bulky and muscular, with

long, daggerlike claws.

Despite  their  might,  hill  landwyrms  prefer  to  pick  on

opponents clearly weaker than themselves. While a single

hill  giant  is  a  tempting  target,  a  hunting  party  of  giants

sends a hill landwyrm into hiding. Some giants capture hill

landwyrms to use as guardians or steeds, though the dragons

hate this and escape as soon as possible. It is possible for a

suitably intimidating individual to humble a hill landwyrm

without striking a blow.

Hill  landwyrms  speak  Draconic,  Goblin,  and  Common.

Combat

A  hill  landwyrm  likes  to  open  combat  with  an  overrun

attack  against  the  weakest-looking  target.  Once  an  oppo-

nent is prone, it focuses its attacks on that individual, using

improved grab to neutralize the target and crush it to death.

If  reduced  to  half  its  hit  points  or  fewer,  a  hill  landwyrm

begins looking for an escape route.

Among its kind, the jungle landwyrm is considered the most

purely sinister and evil. It knows no emotion except hate,

which it holds for all other living creatures.

A jungle landwyrms scaled hide is deep green in color,

with occasional splotches of bright red or yellow that blend

in with its tropical environment. Despite their size, jungle

landwyrms have lithe forms that slide easily through foliage

and between trees. Some unwitting individuals mistake the

jungle landwyrm for an enormous dinosaur and think they

can treat it as they would a mere animal. Such fools dont live

long after making this mistake.

A jungle landwyrm eats anything it can, though it prefers

living prey to carrion or plants. It has few rivals for power,

although it avoids older green dragons. Even in rare instances

when the landwyrm seems willing to negotiate, it inevitably

tricks its prey and attacks it later.

Frightful Presence (Ex): 100-ft. radius, HD 19 or fewer,

Jungle landwyrms speak Draconic and Common.

Will DC 21 negates.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a hill landwyrm

must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw attack.

It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without

provoking an attack of opportunity.

Combat

Like others of its kind, a jungle landwyrm relies on its natu-

ral camouflage to surprise enemies. However, it is also willing

to follow potential prey for great distances, choosing just the

right circumstances to strike. If faced with multiple oppo-

nents, it spreads out its early attacks and doesnt hesitate to

flee if overmatched, knowing it can return days later to pick

off those weakened by its disease-bearing claws.

Disease (Ex): The wounds caused by a jungle landwyrms

claws may become infected with red ache disease (DC 15;

The mountain landwyrm spends most of its days in slum-

ber,  hidden  away  in  a  secret  cave  in  the  heart  of  a  great

peak. But when awake, it is one of the fiercest creatures to

walk the planet.

At  first  glance,  a  mountain  landwyrm  appears  to  be  a

craggy mass of rock. In fact, it is possible to walk right past

one (despite its size) and never suspect it was there. How-

ever, once it is awakened, its tread shakes the ground.

Mountain  landwyrms  subsist  primarily  on  a  diet  of

stone, occasionally venturing forth for a meal of a few dire

bears  or  stone  giants. They  have  no  true  enemies,  since

even  the  eldest  red  dragon  knows  better  than  to  pick  a

fight with such a creature. Still, they have been known to

interact  peacefully  with  creatures  that  offer  the  proper

gifts and obeisance.

Mountain  landwyrms  speak  Draconic,  Dwarven,  Giant,

and Common.

Combat

A mountain landwyrm opens combat with its thunderous

roar and frightful presence, and then picks off injured oppo-

nents  with  patient  skill.  Once  angered,  a  mountain  land-

wyrm does not rest until it has destroyed its foes, tracking

them for days if necessary.

Frightful Presence (Ex): 200-ft. radius, HD 39 or fewer,

Will DC 35 negates.

Snatch (Ex): Against Large or smaller creatures, bite for

4d8+16/round or claw for 4d6+8/round.

Thunderous Roar (Su): Once per day a mountain land-

wyrm can emit a thunderous roar. This is the equivalent of a

greater shout spell. Caster level 20th.

Skills: *Mountain landwyrms have a +4 racial bonus on

Hide checks when in mountain terrain. This bonus on Hide

checks  increases  to  +8  when  the  landwyrm  is  immobile.

The plains landwyrm would be a pitiful beast if it werent so

dangerous. Despite its general cowardice, this scavenger occa-

sionally attacks living creatures when it is hungry or desperate.

A plains landwyrm has scales that bear stripes of tan or

light green, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings. It

is  sometimes  mistaken  for  a  raptorlike  dinosaur,  since  it

often stands up on its hind legs.

Most plains landwyrms wander their environment, since

they arent courageous enough to fight other creatures for

territory. The creature is capable of bluffing when in a crisis,

though it rarely has the patience for such tactics. Some par-

ticularly  brave  halflings  tame  these  creatures  as  mounts,

though  it  takes  an  attentive  rider  to  keep  them  on  task.

Plains landwyrms speak Draconic and Common.

Combat

Whether lying in wait in the tall grass or hiding under a thin

layer of earth, a plains landwyrm favors a quick strike against

an unwary foe.

Burst of Speed (Ex): Once per day, a plains landwyrm

may activate a burst of speed as a free action. This doubles its

Swamp  landwyrms  fear  nothing,  not  even  the  largest

tyrannosaurus or black dragon. From time to time, foolish

lizardfolk attempt to trade valuables with swamp landwyrms

in exchange for protection. Such deals always end badly for

the protected creatures.

Swamp landwyrms speak Draconic and Common.

Combat

If facing a large group of foes, a swamp landwyrm employs

its  frightful  presence  to  reduce  the  number  of  capable

opponents. Otherwise, it opens by targeting a single indi-

vidual  with  its  hypnotizing  gaze,  drawing  it  in  close  for  a

deadly attack.

Frightful Presence (Ex): 180-ft. radius, HD 35 or fewer,

Will DC 35 negates.

Hypnotizing  Gaze  (Su): A  swamp  landwyrm  can  hyp-

notize its prey just by looking into its eyes. This is similar

to a gaze attack, except that the landwyrm must use a stan-

dard action, and those merely looking at the creature are

not affected. Anyone the landwyrm targets must succeed

on a DC 35 Will save or be hypnotized (as the  hypnotism

spell, except it affects a single target whose Hit Dice do not

exceed the landwyrms). If a landwyrm uses this ability in

combat, the target gains a +2 bonus on the save. The effect

has a range of 60 feet and lasts for 10 rounds.

Amphibious  (Ex): Although  swamp  landwyrms  are

aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.

Skills: A swamp landwyrm has a +8 racial bonus on any

Swim  check  to  perform  some  special  action  or  avoid  a

hazard.  It  can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim  check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while  swimming,  provided  it  swims  in  a  straight  line.

Swamp landwyrms have a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks

when in swamp environments. This bonus on Hide checks

increases to +8 when the landwyrm is immobile.

The  blood-drinking  tundra  landwyrm  spends  much  of  its

life in semihibernation, burrowed under the icy ground in

wait for prey to happen by.

The  scales  of  a  tundra  landwyrm  are  dirty  ivory.  It  has

short, stubby claws that help it dig through the frozen earth.

Its roar sounds like the bark of an angry sea lion.

A tundra landwyrm prefers mammalian prey, such as cari-

bou or even polar bears. The creatures occasionally tangle with

white dragons or frost worms. Any offering of live or recently

killed animals can sway a tundra landwyrms opinion.

Tundra landwyrms speak Draconic and Common.

Combat

A tundra landwyrm lies motionless a few feet beneath the

surface of the ground, relying on its tremorsense to warn it

of prey. It scatters targets with its frightful presence, then

grapples a single creature and attempts to drain its blood.

Blood Drain (Ex): If a tundra landwyrm gets a hold on

a living foe, it can drain blood with a successful grapple

check. Each successful grapple check deals 1d6 points of

Constitution damage to its target. A single landwyrm can

deal as many points of Constitution damage in a day as it

has Hit Dice.

Frightful Presence (Ex): 120-ft. radius, HD 23 or fewer,

Will DC 23 negates.

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a tundra land-

wyrm must hit a creature of its size or smaller with a claw

attack. If it gets a hold, it can attempt to draw blood. It can

also attempt to start a grapple as a free action without pro-

voking an attack of opportunity.

The Underdark landwyrm, or cave dragon, spends its entire

existence in darkness, making evil plans and sowing death.

The creatures hide is dark gray, to match its subterranean

environment.  Its  vision  and  hearing  are  extraordinarily

poor, though it makes up for this disadvantage with other

sensory capabilities.

Underdark landwyrms often keep elaborate lairs that take

advantage of their natural surroundings, such as chasms or

lakes. They can sometimes be swayed by gifts of magic.

Underdark landwyrms speak Draconic, Undercommon,

and Common.

Snatch (Ex): Against Small or smaller creatures, bite for

Combat

2d8+8/round or claw for 2d6+4/round.

Cold Adaptation (Ex): Tundra landwyrms take no non-

lethal damage from exposure to low temperatures (though

this ability doesnt affect normal cold-based damage). They

suffer no ill effects (such as penalties on Spot checks) from

snow or sleet and can walk across icy surfaces without need-

ing to make a Balance check.

Skills: *Tundra  landwyrms  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on

Hide checks when in cold desert or plains environments.

This bonus on Hide checks increases to +8 when the land-

wyrm is immobile.

An Underdark landwyrm relies on its blindsense to sense

nearby prey. Once it detects a victim, it uses obscuring mist

to cloak its quiet approach, and then bursts into view with

frightful presence. It often retreats from battle after injuring

opponents, relying on the wounds inflicted upon its prey

to further weaken them.

Blindsense (Ex): An Underdark landwyrms extraordinary

powers  of  scent  and  echolocation  allow it  to  pinpoint  the

location of any living creature within 60 feet.

Frightful Presence (Ex): 60-ft. radius, HD 11 or fewer,

Obscuring Mist (Su): Three times per day, an Underdark

landwyrm can exhale a cloud of obscuring mist (as the spell,

caster level equals landwyrms HD).

Wounding  (Ex): An  Underdark  landwyrms  claws  deal

bleeding  wounds,  similar  to  those  caused  by  a  wounding

weapon. In addition to hit point damage, a claw attack deals

1 point of Constitution damage when it hits a creature. A

critical  hit  does  not  multiply  the  Constitution  damage.

Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this Con-

stitution damage.

Skills: An underdark landwyrm has a +8 racial bonus on

any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid a

hazard.  It  can  always  choose  to  take  10  on  a  Swim  check,

even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action

while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. Under-

dark  landwyrms  have  a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Move  Silently

rocky,  underground  environments.  This  bonus  on  Hide

checks  increases  to  +8  when  the  landwyrm  is  immobile.

PLANAR DRAGONS

In addition to the many dragon species native to the Mater-

ial Plane, a number of dragons hail from other planes, par-

ticularly the Outer Planes. Collectively referred to as planar

dragons, these creatures hail from planes as

diverse  as  Limbo,  Acheron,  Ysgard,  and

even the Ethereal Plane.

Battle dragons are glorious creature that exult in valorous

combat. They  often  serve  as  steeds  for  powerful  warriors.

A battle dragon at rest has a dull brown sheen to its scales.

However, as soon as it takes wing, allowing the sun to strike

its armored skin, it gleams like the finest gold.

Battle dragons are notorious optimists, and always seem

to  find  the  silver  lining  to  any  cloud.  This  emotion  is

often  contagious,  as  they  inspire  others  to  bravery  and

valor in battle.

By  juvenile  age,  battle  dragons  may  find  use  as  steeds

for Small riders. Young adult and older dragons can serve

Medium riders. Some cities or knightly orders have reached

mutual protection and assistance accords with nearby battle

dragon  families,  as  generation  after  generation  of  rider

finds an ally within the same line of dragons.

Battle  dragons  speak  Common,  Draconic,

and Celestial.

Unlike most other true dragons, planar

dragons  are  not  innate  spellcasters;

though  they  have  a  variety  of  spell-like

powers, they dont have the natural affin-

ity for sorcery that their Material Plane

relatives  have.  A  planar  dragon  uses  its

age  category  as  its  caster  level  for  all

spell-like abilities.

Though  native  to  planes  other  than

the  Material,  these  creatures  are  none-

theless of the dragon type and are not out-

siders.  Instead,  they  all  possess  the

extraplanar subtype.

Combat

A battle dragon is a fearless combatant, raised from birth to

take joy in the simple act of conflict. It uses its special abilities

to fortify the prowess of its allies, while striking fear into foes

with  its  breath  weapon,  frightful  presence,  and  battle  fury.

Young  and  older  battle  dragons  natural  weapons  are

treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Battle Fury (Ex): Once per day, an ancient or older battle

dragon may enter a battle fury, which grants it a +2 morale

bonus to Strength and Constitution and a +1 morale bonus

on Will saves, but a 2 penalty to AC. This battle fury lasts

for a number of rounds equal to the dragons (new) Consti-

tution modifier +3, at the end of which the dragon loses the

indicated bonuses but suffers no fatigue or other ill effects.

This  ability  is  otherwise  identical  to  the  barbarians  rage

class feature.

Breath Weapon (Su): A battle dragon has two types of

breath weapon, a cone of sonic energy and a cone of fear gas.

Creatures within the cone of fear gas must succeed on a Will

save or become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Multiple exposures

are  not  cumulative,  but  if  an  affected  creature  is  already

shaken (for instance, from the dragons frightful presence),

it becomes frightened instead.

Inspire  Courage  (Su): Once  per  day,  an  adult  or  older

battle  dragon  can  inspire  courage  in  itself  and  its  allies,

granting them a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against

charm or fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls

and weapon damage rolls. This is identical with the bardic

ability of the same name, and requires the dragon to speak,

sing, or roar for 1 full round.

No two chaos dragons look ex-

actly alike, and some people

claim  that  even  the  same

chaos  dragon  changes  its

form  over  time. While  all

chaos  dragons  are  roughly

the same in appearance

four  powerful  clawed

limbs,  mighty  wings,

long  serpentine  neck

topped  by  a  mouth  full

of  dagger-sharp  teeth,

jagged-edged taileach

has unique markings and

entiate  it  from  others  of

its kind.

In  general,  chaos  dragons

seek  to  tear  down  structured

societies  and  civilizations.

Those  that  tend  toward  good

might  use  positive  means  to

effect change, but those tending to

evil are merely violent and murderous.

For a brief period of time, a sect of gith-

zerai attempted to make a pact with the chaos

dragons, thinking that they could use them just

as their enemies, the githyanki, employed red dragons. The

chaos dragons innate unpredictability and disloyalty ensured

treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath  Weapon  (Su): A  chaos  dragon  has  two  types  of

breath weapon, a line of energy and a cone of confusion gas.

The energy type of its breath weapon is determined randomly

each time it uses the breath weapon by rolling d%: 0120 acid,

2140 cold, 4160 electricity, 6180 fire, 81100 sonic. Even

the dragon itself doesnt know which type of energy it will

emit before it actually breathes. Creatures within the cone of

confusion gas must succeed on a Will save or be confused for 1d6

rounds plus 1 round per age category of the dragon.

Spell-Like  Abilities: 3/dayentropic  shield,  protection

Ethereal dragons spend most of their lives floating through

the Ethereal Plane, spying into the Material Plane for valu-

able treasure.

Ethereal  dragons  natural  coloration  is  a  pearlescent

brown-gray, which accounts for their nickname of moon-

stone dragon. They have needlelike claws and teeth.

Ethereal dragons are naturally curious and inquisitive, and

often spy on those stuck on the Material Plane. They are also

greedy, and may come to covet the valuables carried by those

they spy upon. In such cases, an ethereal dragon might visit

the Material Plane only to appropriate such items, returning

to its native Ethereal Plane as soon as possible.

Ethereal dragons speak Draconic.

Combat

Most  ethereal  dragons  prefer  escape  over  battle,  heading

either to the Ethereal Plane or the Material Plane to avoid

conflict.  If  forced  into  a  fight,  or  if  the  ethereal  dragon

feels combat is necessary, it uses its powers to frustrate its

Ethereal Vision (Ex): While on the Material Plane, a very

young or older ethereal dragon can see ethereal creatures as

if they were visible. While on the Ethereal Plane, an ethereal

dragon  can  see  normally  out  to  the  range  of  its  darkvision

(normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane have a visual limit

of 60 feet). Note that blindsense functions normally even on

the Ethereal Plane, regardless of visual limits.

See Ethereal (Su): A very young or older ethereal dragon

can see ethereal creatures as if they were visible.

Strike  Ethereal  Creatures  (Ex): An  ancient  or  older

ethereal dragon can strike ethereal creatures as if they were

material. This ability does not allow an ethereal dragon on

the Ethereal Plane to affect creatures on the Material Plane.

Summon Ethereal Cyclone (Su): Once per day, a great

wyrm ethereal dragon on the Ethereal Plane can summon

an ethereal cyclone. This requires a full-round action, and

the storm lasts for 1 minute. All creatures (except undead)

within  120  feet  of  the  ethereal  dragon  are  affected  as  de-

scribed in Chapter 5 of Manual of the Planes. (If you dont have

access to Manual of the Planes, you can simply rule that each

creature within the cyclone is thrown 1d10 miles in a random

direction.) This power has no effect anywhere other than on

the Ethereal Plane

Ethereal dragon

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/day

dimensional  anchor, ethereal  jaunt*;

An ethereal dragon on the Ethereal Plane can instead use

this  spell-like  ability  to  become  material,  with  the  same

duration as normal for the spell.

Skills: An ethereal dragon has a +8 racial bonus on Hide

checks when on the Ethereal Plane.

Native to the windswept plane

of Pandemonium, howling drag-

ons are brilliant, scheming, and

quite insane.

A  howling  dragon  is  long

and  slender,  with  short,  thin

legs  and  narrow  wings.  Long

spines  form  a  frill  behind  its

head, and twin clusters of simi-

lar spines sprout from its shoul-

ders.  Its  scales  are  mottled

purple and black, darkening as

the dragon ages. Its yellow eyes

are large and feral-looking, with

tiny pupils.

Howling dragons make their

lairs in isolated caverns amid the

twisting tunnels of their native

plane. When they find their way

to the Material Plane, they seek

out similar terrain, and are thus

usually encountered far under-

ground. They roam widely in the

territory surrounding their lair,

exploring every narrow crevice

and tunnel.

Howling  dragons  feed  on

any creatures they can catch

living, undead, or even construct.

They enjoy the sensation of biting

into  a  still-moving  morsel.

jealously  guarding  its  domain  against  evil  creatures  of

all kinds.

Oceanus dragons appear much like great winged eels,

with relatively short limbs ending in webbed fingers.

Though capable of flight, most Oceanus dragons

prefer life in the water to that in the air.

The typical lair of an Oceanus dragon is

Oceanus dragon

a hidden cave, either along a riverbank

or  completely  underwater.  Most

Oceanus dragons spend little time

in their lairs, instead patrolling a

stretch  of  river  in  search  of

good-aligned  creatures  in  need

of assistance or evil creatures in

need of punishment.

Oceanus  dragons  speak

Celestial, Draconic, and Aquan.

Combat

Oceanus  dragons  prefer  to  end

fights quickly, using their tranquil-

ity  breath  weapon  and  spell-like

abilities  to  neutralize  foes.  However,

they arent afraid to go toe-to-toe with particu-

larly  resistant  opponents,  using  their  lightning

breath weapon,  smite  evil  ability,  and  prodigious  melee

attacks to make short work of their enemies.

Young and older Oceanus dragons natural weapons are

treated as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): An Oceanus dragon has two types

of  breath  weapon,  a  line  of  lightning  or  a  cone  of  tran-

quility gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a

Will save  or  become  dazed  for  1d6  rounds  plus  1  round

per age category of the dragon. Both breath weapons func-

tion normally underwater.

Smite  Evil  (Su): Once  per  day  an  Oceanus  dragon  can

make a normal attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD

total against an evil foe.

Spell-Like Abilities: At willdetect evil; 3/daycontrol

water, holy smite, water breathing; 1/daycontrol winds, dispel

evil, holy word.

Amphibious  (Ex): Although  Oceanus  dragons  are

aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.

Water  Breathing  (Ex): An  Oceanus  dragon  can

breathe  underwater  indefinitely  and  can  freely  use  its

breath  weapon,  spell-like  abilities,  and  other  abilities

while submerged.

thunder  that  move  earth  and  shape  continents.  They  are

native to the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, an infinite plane of

volcanic earthbergs and infernal lava.

A pyroclastic dragon is solidly built and powerfully mus-

cled, conveying a sense of immovability. Its scales resemble

fractured obsidian and glowing magma, forming a mottled

pattern  of  reds,  oranges,  blacks,  and  grays  over  its  entire

body. Its large wings seem almost to be made of ash, but

despite their flimsy appearance they are quite capable of

bearing the dragons great weight aloft.

Pyroclastic dragons enjoy swimming through magma, but

they make their lairs in caves carved out of volcanic rock.

When they venture to the Material Plane, they live only in

volcanic regions.

These dragons enjoy the taste of meat but can also subsist

on a purely mineral diet.

Combat

Pyroclastic  dragons  have  all  the  subtlety  of  a  volcanic

eruptionthey may simmer and hiss for a time, but when

they erupt at last their fury is unmatched.

Young and older pyroclastic dragons natural weapons are

treated  as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): A pyroclastic dragon has two types

of breath weapon, a cone of superheated ash accompanied

by crushing waves of sonic force (dealing half fire damage

and  half  sonic  damage)  or  a  disintegrating  line.  Creatures

within the area of the line must succeed on a Fortitude save

or crumble to ash. (Creatures that successfully save do not

take any damage.)

Spell-Like  Abilities: 3/dayproduce  flame,  sound  burst;

1/dayfire storm, incendiary cloud, meteor swarm, power word,

stun, pyrotechnics, shatter, shout, wall of fire, wall of stone.

Radiant dragons are simultaneously wonderful and ter-

rible, awesome in their righteousness and fearsome in

their dedication to destroying evil.

A  radiant  dragon  seems  to

shine  with  a  heavenly  glow,

though  it  can  douse  this  brightness

as desired. If you can bear to look upon its

grandeur,  you  can  make  out  that  its

perfectly  shaped  scales  glisten

like  molten  white  gold.  Its

proud,  regal  bearing  is  unmistak-

Radiant  dragons  prefer  lairs

are the staunchest of allies, offer-

who foster chaos or evil, a radiant

A  radiant  dragon  relies  on  its  blinding  breath

Native to the Infernal Battlefield of Acheron, rust dragons are

creatures of tarnished metal, embodying forces of decay and

corruption. Some Material Plane sages posit some connec-

tion between these fiendish monstrosities and the relatively

innocuous rust monster, but the rational mind correctly sees

these claims as the ravings of deranged lunatics.

Rust dragons bear a strong resemblance

to  the  metallic  dragons  of  the

Material Plane, but appear

covered in rust, tarnish,

or  verdigris. Though

some  rust  drag-

ons  resemble

copper  drag-

ons and others

silver  or  brass,

i n d i v i d u a l

rust  dragons

abilities  do

not differ. Their

scales appear pit-

ted and lined with

corrosive color, and

the membranes of their wings

are very thin and iridescent.

On  their  native  plane

of  Acheron,  rust  dragons

have an ample food supply

in  the  endless  iron  cubes

the size of continents floating in the void. When drawn to

the Material Plane, rust dragons seek out veins of metal in

underground caverns, making them particularly loathed

by miners.

Rust dragons feed on corroded metal, but enjoy fresh meat

(particularly  vermin)  to  cleanse  the  palate  between ores.

Rust dragon

this  effect,  but  any  metal  is  susceptible:  iron,  steel,  silver,

gold, even mithral and adamantine.

Metal  Resistance  (Ex): A  rust  dragon  is  resistant  to

attacks  from  metal  weapons.  Against  weapons  whose

damage-dealing part is metal (a blade, metal point, arrow-

head, or even mace head), a rust dragon has damage reduc-

tion  equal  to  what  a  rust  dragon  two  age  categories  older

than  itself  has.  Wyrm  and  great  wyrm  rust  dragons  have

damage  reduction  20/magic  and  10/chaotic  against  metal

weapons,  and  lesser  weapons  corrode  when  used  against

them (see Rusting Scales, below).

Rusting Bite (Ex): A rust dragon that makes a successful

bite attack causes metal armor worn by the target creature to

corrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless immediately.

A dragon can also use its bite attack to target

a weapon or other metal object,

of course. The

size  of  the  ob-

ject  is  immaterial

a full suit of armor rusts

away as quickly as a sword.

Magic  metal  items  are

allowed  Reflex  saves

against  a  DC  equal  to

the  dragons breath

weapon  save  DC.

Rusting  Scales

(Ex): A metal weap-

on with less than a

+5  enhancement

bonus  that  hits  a

wyrm  or  great

wyrm rust dragon

corrodes and is de-

stroyed  immediately,  with  no  saving

throw.  A  +5  weapon  deals  damage  nor-

mally, but then must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to

the dragons breath weapon save DC) or rust away.

Spell-Like Abilities: 3/daywall of iron; 1/dayacid fog,

repel metal or stone.

STYX DRAGON

Combat

Rust dragons are not the furious forces of nature that pyro-

clastic dragons are, nor are they violently insane like howl-

ing dragons. Rather, they are simply hungry, and they attack

carefully with their goal clearly fixed in mind. They do not

tolerate too much interference in pursuit of that goal, and

readily break off from combat if a meal proves to be more

trouble than its worth.

Young and older rust dragons natural weapons are treated

as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming  damage

reduction.

Breath  Weapon  (Su): A  rust  dragon  has  two  breath

weapons:  a  line  of  acid  or  a  cone  of  reddish-brown  liquid

that  instantly  corrodes  and  destroys  any  metal  it  touches.

Attended and magical metals receive Reflex saves to avoid

Also  known  as  shadowdrakes  or  darkwyrms,  Styx  dragons

haunt  the  putrid  waters  of  the  River  Styx  throughout  its

nearly infinite length. One of the few creatures immune to

the  harmful  effects  of  the  river,  Styx  dragons  swim  with

impunity across the top layers of all the Lower Planes, feast-

ing on fiends and any other creature they can find and catch.

A Styx dragon has a long, serpentine body with tiny, flip-

perlike  claws  that  are  useless  on  land  and  in  combat.  Its

wings are too small to carry it aloft, but help

to  propel  it  through  the  water.  Its  tail

splits into two long, bladed whips

that  it  can  use  to  slash  and

grab  its  prey.  A  Styx  drag-

ons  scales  are  slimy

and range from dark

brown to rusty red

in  color.  Its  eyes

glow with a lurid

yellow light.

Styx dragon

Styx  dragons

make their lairs

by  burrowing

into the mud on

the banks of the

Styx. They do not

like  to  leave  their

native  plane,  but  if

one is forcibly brought

to  the  Material  Plane,  it

will thrive in fetid water.

Styx  dragons  normally  subsist  on  the

flesh of fiends, but enjoy eating any meat

particularly rotting carrion.

Combat

A Styx dragons physical attacks are limited: It attacks with

the twin blades of its tail instead of claws, it cannot use its

wings  effectively,  and  it  does  not  gain  tail  slap  attacks  in

addition to its tail blades. Its tail blades deal damage as if

188

the dragon were one size category larger than actual, how-

ever, as does its tail sweep.

Young  and  older  Styx  dragons  natural  weapons  are

treated  as  magic  weapons  for  the  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath  Weapon  (Su): A  Styx  dragon  has  two  types  of

breath weapon, a line of acid that persists for 3 rounds (deal-

ing  half  damage  on  the  second  round  and  one-quarter

damage  on  the  third  round),  or  a  cone  of  stupefying  gas.

Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save

or take 1 point of Intelligence damage per age category of

the dragon.

Amphibious (Ex): Although

Styx  dragons  are  aquatic,

they  can  survive  indefi-

nitely on land.

Constrict (Ex): With a suc-

cessful  grapple  check,  a  Styx

dragon can crush a grabbed

opponent, dealing twice

its  tail  blade  dam-

age  as  bludgeon-

ing damage.

D i s e a s e

(Ex): Any crea-

ture  hit  by  a

Styx  dragons

bite  or  tail

attack  must

succeed  on  a

Fortitude  save

(DC  equal  to  that

of  the  dragons  breath

weapon save DC) or contract Sty-

gian  wasting. The  symptoms  of  the  dis-

ease  include  flesh  rotting  away  and  hair  falling  out.

The  incubation  period  is  1  day,  and  the  disease  deals  1d6

points of Charisma damage. A victim must make three suc-

cessful Fortitude saves in a row to recover from Stygian wast-

ing  (see  Disease,  page  292  of  the  Dungeon  Masters  Guide).

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a Styx dragon

must  hit  a  creature  that  is  at  least  one  size  category

Native  inhabitants  of  a

prison  plane,  Tarterian

dragons  are  at  once

wardens  and  prisoners

themselves, preying on

Tarterian  dragons  are

skeletally  gaunt,  with

leathery scales stretched

tight  over  withered-

looking  flesh.  Their

wings  have  a  tattered

appearance, though they

can  fly  fast  and  ably.

Their teeth and claws are

long and black, while their scales form a striped pattern of

black, gray, and olive green. Ghostly green light flickers in

their  black  eyes,  and  their  faces  seem  to  wear  a  perpetual

sneering grin.

Tarterian  dragons  inhabit  a  wide  range  of  habitats  on

their native plane of Carceri, from the steaming jungles

of  Cathrys  (the  second  layer)  to  the  cruel  mountains  of

Colothys (the fourth). Similarly, when they make their way

to the Material Plane they can dwell comfortably in a variety

of locales, both above and under the ground. They delight in

reproducing the jailhouse atmosphere of Carceri whenever

they find themselves on the Material Plane.

Tarterian  dragons  are  accustomed  to  a  diet  of  fiendish

flesh and condemned souls. They do not enjoy other food,

but can live on literally anything.

Combat

Tarterian  dragons  use  their  spell-like  abilities  to  divide

and constrain their opponents, trying to face each

one  individually  when  possible.  They  use

their gas breath weapon

to  weaken  foes  at  the

start  of  combat,  then

their force breath to take

out  the  strongest  foes.

Young and older Tarter-

ian  dragons  natural

weapons are treated

as magic weapons

for  the  purpose

of  overcom-

ing  damage

(Su): A

Tarterian

dragon  has

two  types  of  breath

weapon, a line of disrup-

tive  force  or  a  cone  of

will-sapping  gas.  Crea-

tures  within  the  cone

must  succeed  on  a  Will  save  or  be  affected  by  a  crushing

despair effect, taking a 2 penalty on saving throws, attack

rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls

for 1 round per age category of the dragon.

Force Resistance (Ex): Tarterian dragons have a +4 racial

bonus on saving throws against force-based spells and effects.

Freedom  of  Movement  (Su): Tarterian  dragons  can

move  and  attack  normally  despite  any  magic  that  usually

impedes movement, such as hold monster, paralysis effects,

solid fog, slow, and web spells.

Strength  of  Will  (Ex): Tarterian  dragons  have  a  +4

morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compul-

sion effects.

Spell-Like  Abilities: 1/dayforcecage,  imprisonment,

maze, Otilukes resilient sphere.

Shadow dragons are sly

and devious creatures

with  ties  to  the

Plane  of  Shadow.

Shadow dragons

have  translucent

scales  and  dark

bodies, giving them

an indistinct appear-

ance; from a distance,

they  seem  to  be  noth-

ing  but  a  foreboding

mass of shadows.

COMBAT

Shadow dragons

prefer to attack from hiding, employing

their shadow blend ability. They use illusion spells

to confuse and misdirect their foes.

Young adult and older shadow dragons natural weapons

are  treated  as  magic  weapons  for  purpose  of  overcoming

damage reduction.

Breath Weapon (Su): A shadow dragons breath weapon

is  a  cone  of  billowing,  smoky  shadows  with  an  energy

drain effect. Creatures within the cone gain the number of

negative levels indicated on the Shadow Dragons by Age

table;  the  saving  throw  to  remove  the  negative  level  is

given on the table as well. A successful Reflex save (against

the  same  DC)  reduces  the  number  of  negative  levels  by

half (round down).

Shadow  Blend  (Su): In  any  condition  of  illumination

other than full daylight, a very young or older shadow dragon

can disappear into the shadows, giving it total concealment.

Artificial  illumination,  even  a  light or continual  flame spell,

does not negate this ability. A daylight spell, however, does.

Create Shadows (Su): Three times per day, a great wyrm

shadow dragon can conjure a mass of leaping shadows with

a radius of 100 yards and a duration of 1

hour  (this  is  a  creation  effect).

All  normal  and  magical  light

sources are negated within this

radius.  All  characters  and  creatures

gain a +4 bonus on their Hide

checks  within  the

shadows, and can hide

even  if  directly  ob-

served. Shadow drag-

ons  and  other

creatures with

ties  to  the

Plane  of

Shadow  gain  total

concealment with-

in the shadows, though

they  can  move  and  at-

tack  normally.  Their

attacks  gain  a  +2

bonus  and  deny  their

opponents any Dexterity

bonus to AC, because they

are considered invisible.

SKELETAL DRAGON

Skeletal dragons are created via the animate dead spell and

function  as  normal  skeletons  in  most  ways,  though  they

retain  a  few  of  their  draconic  abilities  and  qualities  even

after death. Despite a skeletal dragons loss of sentience, the

pinpoints of red light smoldering in its eye sockets betray

the spark of unlife that still exists.

Like typical skeletons, skeletal dragons do only what they

are  ordered  to  do. They  can  draw  no  conclusions  of  their

own and take no initiative. Necromancers particularly prize

skeletal dragons, because they make formidable guardians.

They are sturdier than a typical skeleton of their size, and

their added qual-

ities  strike

terror  into

would-be intruders.

SAMPLE SKELETAL

Treasure: None

Alignment:

Advancement: 2324 HD (Huge)

Level Adjustment: 

A  skeletal  black  dragon

takes on a new level of

horror  in  undeath.

Lizardfolk  adepts

and  clerics  often

animate skeletal black dragons to pro-

tect their tribes.

Combat

A skeletal black dragon possesses

none of the craftiness it had in

life.  It  merely  attacks  as  its

master has ordered. Its blind-

sense and keen senses make

it  an  excellent  guardian.

Frightful Presence (Ex):

This skeletal black dragon

can unsettle foes with-

in  210  feet  with  its

mere  presence,

whenever  it  attacks,  charges,  or  flies  overhead.  Creatures

with 4 or fewer HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds, while

those with 5 to 21 HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. A DC

23  Will  save  negates  the  effect  and  makes  the  creature

immune  to  that  dragons  frightful  presence  for  24  hours.

Keen Senses (Ex): A skeletal dragon sees four times as

well as a human in low-light conditions and twice as well in

normal light.

CREATING A SKELETAL DRAGON

Skeletal is an acquired template that can be applied to any

dragon (referred to hereafter as the base dragon). A skeletal

dragon uses all the base dragons statistics and special abili-

ties except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creatures type changes to undead. Do

not  recalculate  the  creatures  base  attack  bonus,  saves,  or

skill points. Size is unchanged.

Hit  Dice: The  base  dragons  Hit  Dice  remain  the  same,

but it loses any Constitution bonus to its hit points (see Abil-

ities,  below).  However,  a  skeletal  dragon  gains  bonus  hit

points equal to its HD.

Speed: The creature retains its land speed, but loses fly

and swim speeds. If it had a burrow or climb speed, it retains

that as well.

Armor Class: Replace the base dragons existing natural

armor bonus to AC with a new natural armor bonus based

on its size.

Attacks: Same  as  the  base  dragon,  except  that  skeletal

dragons cannot make crush attacks.

Special Attacks: A skeletal dragon loses all supernatural

and spell-like special attacks possessed by the base dragon.

It retains any exceptional special attacks (such as frightful

presence or improved grab).

Special Qualities: A skeletal dragon loses all supernatu-

ral  and  spell-like  special  qualities  possessed  by  the  base

dragon. It retains any exceptional special qualities (such as

immunities  or  blindsense).  It  loses  any  subtypes  it  had,

though if the base dragon had any immunities based on its

subtype  (such  as  immunity  to  fire  for  the  fire  subtype),  it

keeps those immunities despite losing the subtype. It also

gains additional special qualities as noted below.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex): Skeletal  dragons  have  damage

reduction 5/bludgeoning.

Immunity to Cold (Ex): Skeletal dragons have immunity

to cold.

Undead Traits: A skeletal dragon is immune to mind-affecting

effects, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease,

death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a  Fortitude  save

unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject

to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage to its physical

ability scores, ability drain, energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion,

or death from massive damage. It cannot be raised, and res-

urrection works only if it is willing. It has darkvision out to 60

feet (unless the base dragon had a greater range).

Saves: As undead, skeletal dragons are immune to any-

thing that requires a Fortitude save unless it affects objects.

Abilities: A  skeletal  dragon  retains  the  base  dragons

Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores. Being undead, a

skeletal  dragon  has  no  Constitution  score.  It  also  has  no

Intelligence score. Its Wisdom score becomes 10.

Skills: A  skeletal  dragon  loses  all  skill  ranks  and  racial

skill bonuses possessed by the base dragon.

Feats: A skeletal dragon loses all feats possessed by the

base  dragon.  It  gains  Improved  Initiative  as  a  bonus  feat.

A  squamous  spewer  is  an  evil,  amorphous  mass  of  scales,

mouths,  fangs,  and  reptilian  eyes.  Sages  guess  that  it  has

some connection to the gibbering mouther, but it is more

hideous and deadly than that creature.

A typical squamous spewerif such a thing can be said

to  existhas  scales  of  many  different  colors  and  lusters,

sometimes both chromatic and metallic in nature. It has no

allegiance to dragons, and in fact, the two species gener-

ally despise one another.

Squamous spewers speak Draconic.

COMBAT

A squamous spewer prefers to hide from enemies until they

are within range of its roar. After dispersing weaker foes, the

creature  uses  its  breath  weapons  until  targets close within

melee range (using Combat Reflexes if the opportunity pres-

ents itself ).

Breath Weapon (Su): Despite its large number of mouths,

a squamous spewer can only use one type of breath weapon

in a given round, though it may spew it from up to three

mouths simultaneously in up to three different areas. The

energy type is determined randomly by rolling d% before

each use: 0125 acid, 2650 cold, 5175 electricity, 76100

fire. The area of the breath weapon in any given round is

either  a  30-foot  cone  or  a  60-foot  line  (50%  chance  of

either). Regardless of the type of energy it uses or the area

it affects, the breath weapon deals 3d6 points of damage

(Reflex  DC  17  half ).  Once  a  squamous  spewer  uses  its

breath  weapon,  it  cannot  use  it  again  until  1d4  rounds

have passed.

Some squamous spewers may have breath weapon vari-

eties that differ from these optionsthe DM can select a

breath weapon possessed by another

type of dragon if he or she so wishes.

Roar (Ex): Three times per day, a

squamous  spewer  can  let  loose  a

frightening roar from its many

mouths.  All  creatures  within

a  60-foot-radius  spread  with

fewer Hit Dice than the squa-

mous spewer become panicked

if they fail a DC 19 Fortitude

save.  Creatures  with

HD equal to or greater

than  the  squamous

spewer are shaken on

a  failed  save  rather

than panicked.

Amorphous  (Ex):

Squamous  spewers  are

not  subject  to  critical

hits.  They  have  no

clear front or back,

so  they  cannot  be

flanked.

Blindsense  (Ex): A  squamous  spewers  extraordinary

powers  of  scent  and  echolocation  allow  it  to  pinpoint  the

location of any living creature within 60 feet.

Dragon Traits: Despite their aberrant nature, squamous

spewers  share  certain  traits  with  creatures  of  the  dragon

type, including darkvision out to 60 feet, immunity to paral-

ysis and magic sleep effects, and low-light vision.

Skills: Thanks to its multiple eyes, a squamous spewer has

a  +4  racial  bonus  on  Spot  checks.  Its  natural  camouflage

gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.

Also called cloud dragons or wind

dragons, these enormous creatures

live in the clouds themselves.

When  the  creature  is  at  rest,  a

storm  drakes  scales  have  a  pearl-

escent  sheen.  A  happy  cloud

dragon  shimmers  with  golden

highlights,  while  an  angered  one

turns dark gray, like a thundercloud.

The drakes silver wings are nearly translucent.

A storm drake spends most of its life soaring through the

clouds, enjoying weather in all its variable forms. It typically

makes its lair on a misty mountain peak.

Storm drakes speak Draconic and Auran. Some also learn

Common  or  Giant  to  converse  with  creatures  living  near

their lair.

COMBAT

confident of victory, it begins by using its breath weapon

to separate the combatants from one another, then softens

up the remaining opponents with call lightning, ice

storm, and shout. If it has time to prepare,

it  may  use  control  winds or control

weather to  create  a  setting

more  conducive  to  its

victory. It doesnt hesi-

tate  to  flee  if  out-

matched, using either

gaseous  form  or  (if

pursued) wind  walk

to escape.

Breath  Weapon

(Su): A  storm  drake

has  one  type  of  breath

weapon,  a  60-foot  cone

of wind usable once every

1d4  rounds.  This  attack  pro-

duces  the  equivalent  of  tor-

nado -strength  winds  (see

Table  324  on  page  95  of

the  Dungeon  Master s

Guide).  Those  in  the

cone  may  attempt  DC

30  Fortitude  saves  to

resist the effect.

Gaseous  Form  (Su): A  storm

drake  can  assume  gaseous  form  at

will as a standard action. While gaseous, the drake has a fly

speed of 60 feet (perfect) and is unaffected by wind of any

kind. It cant attack or use its breath weapon while gaseous,

but it can use spell-like abilities normally. This ability is oth-

erwise identical with the gaseous form spell.

Snatch (Ex): Against Medium or smaller creatures, bite

for 4d6+12/round or claw for 2d8+6/round.

VAMPIRIC DRAGON

A vampiric dragon is forever anchored to its hoard, much

like a normal vampire craves its coffin. It appears much as it

did as a living dragon, though its eyes gleam with a feral and

predatory glint. It dreams only of death and evil, spreading

legends of its treasure to draw in unwitting adventurers in

order to create vampire spawn.

Thankfully, such creatures are rare in the extreme, most

often created by energy draining effects or unique conflu-

ences of negative energy.

Like normal vampires, vampiric dragons cast no shadows

and  throw  no  reflections  in  mirrors. They  speak  any  lan-

guages they knew in life.

Combat

This vampiric red dragon casts desecrate upon its lair each

day,  granting  combat  bonuses  to  it  and  its  vampire

spawn  minions,  if  any.  When  it  first  senses

intruders,  it  listens  from  a  distance  to  learn

more  about  them,  sending  vampire  spawn

forward  to  battle  if  available.  If  it  can

employ its charming voice before reveal-

ing its presence, it does so. In battle, it

prefers to target lone opponents, using

Flyby  Attack  and  Snatch  to  grapple

the target and then carry it to a safe

location  to  employ  its  blood  drain.

Attacks: A vampiric dragon retains all the attacks

of the base dragon. Unlike typical vampires, a vam-

piric dragon does not gain slam attacks.

Special Attacks: A vampiric drag-

on  retains  all  the  special  attacks  of

the base dragon and also gains those

noted below. Saves have a DC of 10

+ 1/2 vampiric dragons HD + vam-

piric  dragons  Cha  modifier  unless

noted otherwise.

Blood Drain (Ex): A vampiric dragon

can  suck  blood  from  a  living victim

one size category smaller than itself or

larger. If it pins the foe with whom it

is  grappling,  it  drains  blood,  dealing

1d4 points of Constitution drain each

round the pin is maintained.

Charm  (Su): The  voice  of  a  vam-

piric  dragon  can  bewitch  listeners.

This requires a full-round action by the

vampiric  dragon,  but  any  creatures

within  30  feet  per  age  category  of  the

base dragon who can hear its voice must

make  a  Will  save  or  become  charmed

(as charm  monster).  The  charm  is

immediately  broken  if  the  vam-

piric  dragon  uses  its  frightful

presence  within  range  of  the

charmed individual or makes any

attack against the charmed individ-

ual. A vampiric dragon need not see

its targets to use this power.

Spells: As 9th-level sorcerer.

Keen  Senses  (Ex): This  vampiric  red  dragon  sees  four

times as well as a human in low-light conditions and twice

as well in normal light.

Sorcerer  Spells  Known (6/8/8/7/5;  save  DC  16  +  spell

CREATING A VAMPIRIC DRAGON

Vampiric is a template that can be added to any dragon of

at least adult age (referred to hereafter as the base dragon).

The creature uses all the base dragons statistics and special

abilities except as noted here.

Size  and Type: The  creatures  type  changes  to  undead,

and it loses any subtypes it had in life. Do not recalculate the

creatures  base  attack  bonus,  saves,  or  skill  points.  Size  is

unchanged.

Hit Dice: The base dragons Hit Dice remain the same, but

it loses any Constitution bonus to its hit points (see Abilities,

below).  However,  a  vampiric  dragon  gains  bonus  hit  points

equal to four times its HD.

Create Spawn (Su): A humanoid or monstrous humanoid

slain  by  a  vampiric  dragons  energy  drain  attack  rises  as  a

vampire  spawn  (see  page  253  of  the  Monster  Manual)  1d4

days after death.

If a vampiric dragon instead drains its victims Constitution

to 0, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or fewer Hit Dice

and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new

vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampiric drag-

on that created it and remains enslaved until its masters death.

An adult or older dragon slain by a vampiric dragons blood

drain returns as a vampiric dragon under the command of

the vampiric dragon that created it, as noted above. Young

adult or younger dragons slain by its blood drain attack, or

any dragons slain by its energy drain attack, rise instead as

mindless zombie dragons (see page 197).

Domination  (Su): A  vampiric  dragon  can  crush  an  oppo-

nents will just by looking into its eyes. This ability works

similarly to a gaze attack, except that the vampiric dragon

must use a standard action, and those merely looking at the

creature are not affected. Anyone the vampiric dragon tar-

gets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under the

vampiric dragons influence as though by a dominate monster

spell  (caster  level  18th). The  ability  has  a  range  of  30  feet

plus 10 feet per age category of the base dragon.

Armor  Class: The  base  dragons  natural  armor  bonus

Energy  Drain  (Su): A  living  creature  hit  by  a  vampiric

196

improves by 2.

dragons claw attack gains one negative level.

Special Qualities: A vampiric dragon retains all the spe-

cial qualities of the base dragon (except for any subtypes it

possessed) and gains those noted below. If the base dragon

had any immunities based on its subtype (such as immunity

to fire for the fire subtype), it keeps those immunities despite

losing the subtype.

Fast Healing (Ex): A vampiric dragon heals 5 hit points of

damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If

reduced  to  0  hit  points  or  lower,  a  vampiric  dragon  auto-

matically assumes gaseous form (fly speed 40 feet, otherwise

as the spell) and attempts to escape. It must reach its hoard

within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to 18

miles in 2 hours.) Once at rest upon its hoard, it rises to 1 hit

point after 1 hour, then resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit

points  per  round.  For  obvious  reasons,  a  vampiric  dragon

prefers to keep its hoard well concealed from adventurers

and would-be thieves.

Resistance (Ex): A vampiric dragon has resistance to cold 20

and electricity 20.

Turn Resistance (Ex): A vampiric dragon has +4 turn resist-

ance (see page 317 of the Monster Manual).

Undead  Traits: A  vampiric  dragon  is  immune  to  mind-

affecting effects, poison, magic sleep effects, paralysis, stun-

ning,  disease,  death  effects,  and  any  effect  that  requires  a

Fortitude save unless it also works on objects or is harmless.

It  is  not  subject  to  critical  hits,  nonlethal  damage,  ability

damage  to  its  physical  ability  scores,  ability  drain,  energy

drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It

cannot be raised, and resurrection works only if it is willing.

It has darkvision out to 60 feet (unless the base creature had

a greater range).

Vampiric Weaknesses: Vampiric dragons share the typical

vampires vulnerability to sunlight. Direct sunlight slows

a  vampiric  dragon,  allowing  it  only  a  single  standard

action or move action each round. A vampiric dragon can

survive exposure to direct sunlight for a number of con-

secutive rounds equal to its age category, after which it is

utterly destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a vam-

piric dragons heart slays it, just as with a normal vampire

(though for larger dragons, youll need a stake the size of

a spear).

Unlike other vampires, vampiric dragons are not injured

by immersion in water. Vampiric dragons are not repelled

by  garlic  or  mirrors  (though  they  dont  keep  mirrors  in

their  hoards),  and  they  can  freely  cross  running  water.

They  cant  enter  a  home  unless  invited,  but  most  simply

destroy  the  home  and  then  pick  through  the  rubble  for

their victims.

Saves: As undead, vampiric dragons are immune to any-

thing that requires a Fortitude save unless it affects objects.

Abilities: Increase from the base dragon as follows: Str

+4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As undead creatures, vam-

piric dragons have no Constitution score.

Skills: Vampiric dragons have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff,

Hide,  Listen,  Move  Silently,  Search,  Sense  Motive,  and

Spot checks.

Feats: Vampiric  dragons  gain  Alertness,  Combat

Reflexes,  Dodge,  Improved  Initiative,  and  Lightning

Reflexes, assuming the base dragon meets the prerequisites

and doesnt already have the feats.

Organization: Solitary or guarded (1 plus 25 vampire

spawn).

Treasure: Triple standard.

Alignment: Always chaotic evil.

Advancement: Up to +2 HD.

Level Adjustment: +5.

ZOMBIE DRAGON

A zombie dragon is created by use of the animate dead spell

or by a vampiric dragon (see above). It functions as a normal

zombie in most ways, though it retains a few of its draconic

abilities and qualities even after death

A  zombie  dragon  stinks  of  death,  and  its  once  glorious

scaled hide sports gaping holes chewed by worms. Because of

the creatures utter lack of intelligence, the instructions given

to a newly created zombie dragon must be very simple, such

as Destroy anything that comes within sight.

Zombie dragons are often used as sentries (although they

arent capable of calling for help, the sounds of the battle usu-

ally  serve  to  raise  the  alarm)  or  guardians.  Draconic  spell-

casters capable of creating such creatures may use the bodies

of  dead  rivals  or,  in  the  case  of  particularly  vile  necro-

mancers, deceased family members.

CREATING A ZOMBIE DRAGON

Zombie is a template that can be added to any dragon of at

least adult age (referred to hereafter as the base dragon). The

creature uses all the base dragons statistics and special abil-

ities except as noted here.

Size  and Type: The  creatures  type  changes  to  undead,

and it loses any subtypes it had in life. Do not recalculate

the creatures base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is

unchanged.

Hit  Dice: The  base  dragons  Hit  Dice  remain  the  same,

but it loses any Constitution bonus to its hit points (see Abil-

ities,  below).  However,  a  zombie  dragon  gains  bonus  hit

points equal to twice its HD.

Speed: Reduce flight maneuverability by one category (to

a minimum of clumsy).

Armor  Class: Reduce  natural  armor  bonus  to  one-half

the base dragons value (rounding down).

Special  Attacks: A  zombie  dragon  retains  any  excep-

tional special attacks of the base dragon (such as improved

grab), except for special attacks with a save DC based on the

base dragons Charisma (such as frightful presence). It loses

all supernatural and spell-like special attacks possessed by

the base dragon, except for any breath weapon attack, which

is altered as noted below.

Breath  Weapon  (Su): A  zombie  dragon  keeps  the  base

dragons breath weapon (if any), though it deals only half the

listed damage. Breath weapons that dont deal damage (such

as  the  brass  dragons  sleep breath  weapon)  are  unchanged.

The save DC to resist the dragons breath weapon is 10 + 1/2

zombie dragons HD + zombie dragons Cha modifier.

immunities  or  blindsense).  It  loses  any  subtypes  it  had,

though if the base dragon had any immunities based on its

subtype  (such  as  immunity  to  fire  for  the  fire  subtype),  it

keeps those immunities despite losing the subtype. It also

gains additional special qualities as noted below.

Damage  Reduction  (Ex): Zombie  dragons  gain  damage

Slow  (Ex): Like  zombies,  zombie  dragons  have  poor

reflexes  and  can  perform  only  a  single  standard  action  or

tracted or endangered. It can use the run

action  while  swimming,  provided  it

swims in a straight line.

his chapter presents 120 ready-to-play true dragon

NPCs, one for each of the twelve age categories and

ten varieties. These dragons have the basic statistics

given in the Monster Manual. Each entry includes notes

about the dragons personality, combat tactics, and other

details of its life and habits. Some entries differ slightly

from their Monster Manual counterparts because the skills

and feats for some of them have been adjusted.

Though the dragons are presented here as individuals,

nearly any dragon described in this chapter could serve as a

member of a dragon family, or in the case of younger dragons,

the leader of a clutch. A clutch or family led by one of these

dragons tends to reflect the leaders personality and tastes.

CUSTOMIZING

THE DRAGONS

You can customize any sample dragon by altering its abil-

ity scores. As presented here, each dragons ability scores

(as given in the Monster Manual or another source) assume

the standard array (all 11s and 10s), modified to take into

account the dragons racial ability adjustments. See Abil-

ity  Score  Arrays,  page  290  of  the  Monster  Manual, for

more information.

To create an elite dragon, you could apply the elite array

typically used for NPC ability scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

To apply the elite array to any dragon, assign the following

ability score modifications as you see fit: +4, +4, +2, +2,

+0, 2. Applying the elite array to a dragon increases

its Challenge Rating by 1.

For a slightly less powerful dragon, use the non-

elite array: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. To apply this array to

any dragon, assign the following ability score modi-

fications as you see fit: +2, +2, +0, +0, 2, 2. Apply-

ing the nonelite array to a dragon has no effect on

its Challenge Rating.

EXAMPLE

Rime, the white wyrmling described on page 270,

would have the following ability scores using the

elite array: Str 15, Dex 14, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 11,

Cha 4.

Changing  a  dragons  ability  scores  requires

making  several  adjustments  to  its  statistics

block, as detailed below.

Strength: Adjust the dragons attack bonus,

damage values, and skill modifiers according to

its  new  Strength  modifier.  In  the  example,

Rime gained 4 points of Strength, increasing

his  Strength  modifier  from  +0  to  +2.  Rime

doesnt have the Snatch feat or a crush attack, but

if he did, his +2 Strength modifier would apply

to the grapple check bonus he would use for

those abilities.

Dexterity: Adjust the dragons initiative modifier, Armor

Class, Reflex save bonus, and skill modifiers according to

its new Dexterity modifier. In the example, Rime gained 4

points of Dexterity, which increased his Dexterity modifier

from +0 to +2.

Constitution: Adjust  the  dragons  hit  points,  breath

weapon save DC, Fortitude save bonus, and skill modifiers

according to its new Constitution modifier. In the example,

Rime gained 2 points of Constitution, which increased his

Constitution  modifier  from  +1  to  +2.  Rime  doesnt  have  a

crush attack or tail sweep attack, but if he did, the save DCs

against those attacks also would increase by 1.

Intelligence: Adjust  the  dragons  total  skill  points  and

skill modifiers according to its new Intelligence modifier.

In the example, Rime gained 2 points of Intelligence, which

increased his Intelligence modifier from +0 to +1 and gave

him 3 extra skill points (1 point per Hit Die).

Wisdom: Adjust the dragons Will save bonus and skill

modifiers according to its new Wisdom modifier. In the

example,  Rime  gained  0  points  of  Wisdom,  leaving  his

Wisdom modifier unchanged.

Charisma: Adjust the dragons frightful presence save

DC, spell-like ability save DCs, and skill modifiers accord-

ing  to  its  new  Charisma  modifier.  In  the  example,  Rime

lost 2 points of Charisma, which lowers his Charisma mod-

ifier from 2 to 3. If the dragon is a spellcaster, a change in

Charisma  also  affects  the  save  DCs  for  its  spells  and  the

number of bonus spells it gets. A dragon needs a Charisma

score of at least 10 to cast any spells. Since Rime has no spell-

casting  ability,  spell-like  abilities,  frightful  presence,  or

Charisma-based skills, his reduced Charisma score has no

real impact.

Assuming Rime spent his extra 3 skill points from his Intel-

ligence increase on Hide, Listen, and Spot, his new statistics

would be as follows:

Rime: Male  wyrmling  white  dragon;  CR  2; Tiny  dragon

(cold); HD 3d12+6; hp 25; Init +6; Spd 60 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly

nerability to fire; AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +5, Will +3; Str 15,

Dex 14, Con 15, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 4.

Skills and Feats: Hide +16, Listen +8, Search +2, Sense Motive

Breath Weapon (Su): 15-ft. cone, 1d6 cold, Reflex DC

SAMPLE BLACK DRAGONS

Described below are twelve sample black dragons, one of

each age category. The descriptions include basic personal-

ity and encounter notes that the DM will want to flesh out

for his campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the

dragon ready to play.

Water Breathing (Ex): All black dragons can breathe

underwater  indefinitely  and  can  freely  use  their  breath

weapons, spells, and other abilities underwater.

Skills: A  black  dragon  can  move  through  water  at  its

swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10

on  a  Swim  check,  even  if  distracted  or  endangered. The

dragon can use the run action while swimming, provided it

swims in a straight line.

Blight

Wyrmling Black Dragon

Mean as the proverbial polecat, fiercely territorial, vain, and

perpetually hungry, Blight tends to breathe acid first and

consider the consequences later. Blight thinks of herself

as the most dangerous creature in her patch of swamp. She

is queen of all she surveys; however, she is a Tiny dragon

and doesnt actually survey very much. The mere sight of

any creature more attractive than herself (and thats most

creatures) fills Blight with rage. She delights in destroying

beautiful things, especially birds and small animals. Like-

wise, she scars small plants, trees, and even rocks just for

the fun of it.

Blight: Female  wyrmling  black  dragon;  CR  3;  Tiny

dragon (water); HD 4d12+4; hp 30; Init +4; Spd 60 ft., fly

100 ft. (average), swim 60 ft.; AC 15, touch 12, flat-footed

2-1/2 ft./0 ft. (5 ft. with bite); SA breath weapon; SQ blind-

sense  60  ft.,  darkvision  120  ft.,  immunity  to  acid,  magic

sleep effects, and paralysis, low-light vision, water breathing;

AL CE; SV Fort +5, Ref +4, Will +4; Str 11, Dex 10, Con 13,

Int 8, Wis 11, Cha 8.

Skills and Feats: Hide +14, Listen +6, Move Silently +6,

Search +2, Sense Motive +2, Spot +6, Swim +14; Alertness,

Improved Initiative.

DRAGONS AND LANGUAGES

All  dragons  speak  Draconic.  With  their  high  degree  of  intelli-

gence, most dragons have an affinity for language and speak

additional languages as well. Many even study the science of

language, developing a wide range of tongues.

with ranks in the Speak Language skill can speak a number of

additional languages equal to those ranks.

Additional languages commonly spoken by dragons include

Auran,  Celestial,  Common,  Dwarven,  Elven,  Gnome,  Ignan,

Infernal, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.

As with all intelligent creatures, a dragon speaks a number of

additional languages equal to its Intelligence bonus. Dragons

Breath Weapon (Su): 30-ft. line, 2d4 acid, Reflex DC 13

half.

Kurnoc

Very Young Black Dragon

Kurnoc  likes  to  prowl  around  his  home  swamp  and  con-

gratulate himself on how nasty and tough and excellent he

is. Kurnoc takes special delight in stealing kills from other

predators. (Such victories seem more like conquests than

simply collecting food.)

Kurnoc likes to announce his presence before attacking,

usually by bellowing a challenge. His favorite topic of con-

versation  is  the  partys  ultimate  demise  at  the  fangs  and

claws of Kurnoc. If a party decides to retreat in response to

Kurnocs bluster, the dragon attacks the moment their backs

are turned.

When  facing  one  opponent  in  battle,  Kurnoc  usually

charges, snarling and spitting like an angry cat. This dis-

play often sends the foe running, and the dragon gleefully

pursues. When facing a group of intelligent foes, Kurnoc

taunts  and  threatens  for  a  short  while,  then  attacks  by

using his breath weapon on as many enemies as possible

before charging into melee.

Kurnoc:  Male  very  young  black  dragon;  CR  4;  Small

dragon (water); HD 7d12+7; hp 52; Init +0; Spd 60 ft., fly

100 ft. (average), swim 60 ft.; AC 17, touch 11, flat-footed

17; Base Atk +9; Grp +4; Atk +9 melee (1d6+1, bite); Full

Multiattack, Enlarge Breath, Power Attack.

Breath Weapon (Su): 40-ft. line (60-ft. line if enlarged),

4d4 acid, Reflex DC 14 half.

Jurlfalud

Young Black Dragon

Jurlfalud  craves  darkness,  solitude,  and  piles  of  coins  to

make a comfortable bed for herself. She spends most of her

days lurking silently in her lair. She receives tribute from

a tribe of kobolds whose leader she killed a few years ago.

Occasionally, she feels the need to remind the kobolds of

the fear they should hold for her, or to scout the area around

her lair for intruders. She is careful to remain unseen as she

comes and goes.

Jurlfalud prefers to begin combat with a melee attack.

She lies in hiding and chooses a lightly armored foe for her

first attack.

Jurlfalud: Female  young  black  dragon;  CR  5;  Medium

dragon (water); HD 10d12+20; hp 85; Init +4; Spd 60 ft., fly

Attack, Shape Breath.

Breath Weapon (Su): 60-ft. line (30-ft. cone if shaped),

6d4 acid, Reflex DC 17 half.

Myastanaklon

Juvenile Black Dragon

Dwelling at the bottom of a fetid lake, Myastanaklon rarely

surfaces or sees the sun. In fact, when the sun shines unusu-

ally brightly upon the lake surface and the water becomes

unusually clear, he swathes himself in magical darkness so he

can continue to enjoy the watery gloom. He never speaks

and only rarely fights, preferring to float slowly through the

water,  brooding  while  he  consumes  fish,  crocodiles,  and

lizardfolk that come too near.

Myastanaklon: Male  juvenile  black  dragon;  CR  7;

Medium dragon (water); HD 13d12+26; hp 110; Init +0; Spd

60 ft., fly 150 ft. (poor), swim 60 ft.; AC 22, touch 10, flat-

Munwithurix

Young Adult Black Dragon

Bloodthirsty,  ill-humored,  and  rapacious,  Munwithurix

proves as treacherous and unforgiving as the fens she calls

home. She has utterly cowed several gangs of scrags, who

live in terror of her. Munwithurix has become increasingly

dissatisfied with her position at the top of the local pecking

order and now delights in the sparkle of gold, which does

not tarnish even in the silty waters of her lair. She has also

begun thinking about finding a mate.

Munwithurix has a taste for close combat; still, she is no

fool. She usually observes foes for a few minutes, either by

hiding and watching them approach or by stalking them for

a time, before committing herself to combat.

Haldulfvinemmonis

Adult Black Dragon

Haldulfvinemmonis  is  a  bully.  He  enjoys  his  physical

strength for its own sake, but enjoys it even more for what

he can do with it. He views the entire world as his buffet,

and the other creatures in it as either objects of fun or an-

noyances  to  be  eliminated.  In  the  latter  category  is  his

mother,  Bluutsvilvarrt,  who  tormented  him  mercilessly

when he was younger and now commands all the hatred he

can  muster.  Haldulfvinemmonis  lives  for  the  day  he  can

wreak his revenge.

Eliinwyluwyther is a leader, a diplomat, and a ruthless tyrant.

She  rules  a  small  empire  of  several  lizardfolk  tribes,  an

enslaved clan of barbaric wild elves, and several chuuls. She

makes  her  lair  in  an  ancient  ruin  at  the  heart  of  a  vast

swampland, built by a long-forgotten race to honor their

bizarre and alien deities. In her innermost sanctum, these

deities whisper to her while she sleeps, planting the seeds of

madness in her mind. Her behavior now is unpredictable

she  can  change  in  a  heartbeat  from  smooth  diplomacy  to

uncontrolled savagery, and her subjects have grown to dread

any audience with her.

Iyriddelmirev

Very Old Black Dragon

Twohvritturnuroth

Old Black Dragon

Twohvritturnuroth likes snakes. He hisses when he speaks,

and he samples the air with his tongue more than strictly

necessary.  Even  his  enormous  pride  doesnt  prevent  him

from slithering on his belly when it suits him. In the dense

jungle  around  his  lair,  where  the  trees  seem  to  drip  with

snakes,  it  is  an  effective  form  of  movement. Twohvrittur-

nuroth has no magical control over snakes, but he is served

by a number of yuan-ti (he favors abominations). He thinks

of himself as sneaky, even seductive, but he is most effective

when he descends to raw savagery.

On the edge of a vast swamp stands a small city of humans

and their kind, a river port where herbs and woods from the

marshlands are shipped to a nearby seaport and out to other

lands.  The  brackish  water  of  the  river  flows  through  the

sewers  beneath  the  city,  and  this  is  where  Iyriddelmirev

makes her lair. Most often, however, she is found in the city

above,  polymorphed  into  the  form  of  a  black-skinned  hu-

man  woman.  She  leads  a  gang  of  thieves,  most  of  them

human and almost none of them aware of her true identity.

The gang benefits greatly from their leaders knowledge of

the  city  sewer  system,  and  its  members  often  make  their

escapes  through  water-filled  passages  the  city  authorities

believe to be impassable.

Keygrodekkerrhylon

Ancient Black Dragon

Keygrodekkerrhylon has mellowed somewhat with age. In

his youth, he was hot-tempered and extremely violent. He

sought out confrontation even with older and more power-

ful dragons, and triumphed through sheer tenacityor fled

with his life. Having survived to celebrate his 800th birth-

day, he has slowed down and no longer seeks out conflict.

Neither does he shy away from it, however, and many young

upstarts who assume his retreat is a sign of weakness have

learned the truth to their dismay.

Keygrodekkerrhylon wants nothing more now than to be

left alone, but his reputation for savagery draws a procession

of those who seek glory and wealth by slaying the fearsome

monster. He has recently abandoned the lair he held for five

centuries, and seeks greater seclusion in a new subterranean

abode at the bottom of a large dungeon complex.

Bluutsvilvarrt

Wyrm Black Dragon

Bluutsvilvarrt is a sadistic tyrant whose greatest pleasure in

life is inflicting as much suffering as possible on any crea-

ture that dares to enter her sight. Her deepest contempt is

reserved for younger black dragons, including her own off-

spring. Several of her brood, including Haldulfvinemmonis

(page 203), nurse centuries-old grudges against her because

of this.

Bluutsvilvarrt loves to inspire terror, stalking intruders

in her swampy domain and allowing them glimpses of her

wing, tail, or eyes before disappearing. When the intrud-

ers are properly terrorized, she separates the members of

the  group  and  toys  with  each  one  before  dispatching  it.

She discontinues these playful tactics if her life is threat-

ened, shifting to full offensive mode or escaping invisibly

if need be.

Eribonyxtaliff

Great Wyrm Black Dragon

Eribonyxtaliff  fancies  himself  the  new  Ashardalon:  the

greatest  black  dragon  that  has  ever  lived  and  the  pro-

genitor of an entirely new race. He is a mighty dragon, to

be  sure,  but  his  half-dragon  offspring  never  live  up  to

their fathers expectations. His children include bestial

half-crocodiles and half-dinosaurs, a small tribe of half-

lizardfolk, a scattering of half-merrows, and even a few

half-shambling mounds and half-tendriculoses. He uses

this small army of half-dragons as minions and agents in

his swamp domain and beyond. In keeping with his con-

ceit,  Eribonyxtaliff  is  currently  seeking  membership  in

the loose-knit cult called the disciples of Ashardalon (see

page 87).

his quarry any way he can, even if it means digging his prey

out of a burrow. Dazzle is almost always on the hunt, but hes

smart enough to attempt the occasional parley. His version

of a parley, however, usually involves trying to bully some-

one into giving up treasure, a mount, or even a companion.

Jalnur

Very Young Blue Dragon

Jalnur loves the feel of the hot desert sun. When not bask-

ing on a sun-warmed rock, shes skimming low over desert

sands shimmering with heat. She tolerates no interlopers in

her  territory,  especially  humanoids,  whom  she  regards  as

inferior and too uppity to admit it. Her blood boils when-

ever she sees a humanoid traveling with a domestic animal,

because she believes that no humanoid should have mastery

of  anything  else,  except  perhaps,  another  humanoid.  She

never  hesitates  to  attack  caravans,  even  when  they  are  far

too large for her to handle. In theses cases, she settles for a

few passes with her breath weapon, then retreats to attack

again another day.

Ysauraithus

Young Blue Dragon

Ysauraithus lives on a wide, dry steppe populated by horse-

riding  nomads.  She  has  quite  an  appetite  for  horseflesh,

but tries to limit her ravenous cravings in order to avoid

drawing  the  full  wrath  of  the  nomadic  population  upon

herself. Some of the nomadic clans make regular offerings

of  weak  or  injured  horses  to  appease  her,  while  others

suffer occasional raids in which Ysauraithus makes a meal

of a horse or two.

Ysauraithus  loves  to  fly,  and  soars  for  hours  over  her

domain. As a result, she knows every knoll and gulch on

the steppe, and recognizes most of the creatures that dwell

there. Newcomers and strangers can count on a visit from

the self-appointed queen of the steppe, but as long as they

fawn and grovel appropriately she usually lets them live

particularly if they offer her a horse.

oases, and rules over several bands of jann in that area. He

leads the jann in raids on other caravans and settlements,

taking  the  choicest  treasures  for  his  own  hoard  and  dis-

tributing the rest among his followers. Though thoroughly

evil,  he  is  fair,  and  tries  to  ensure  that  the  jann  profit  as

much from the association as he does. He does not subject

them to unnecessary risks, and rewards those who perform

exceptionally well.

Acophisinian

Young Adult Blue Dragon

The bane of Acophisinians existence is a nest of guardian

nagas that share her territory. The three nagas have so far

been unable to force the dragon out of their region of bad-

lands,  and  the  dragon  for  her  part  has  honed  her  combat

skills for years, preparing to wipe out the nagas once and

for all. She is insecure about her magical ability, however,

and wants to improve thatprobably by adding levels of

sorcererbefore challenging them. She believes the nagas

are guarding a priceless treasure and she covets itin addi-

tion to simply wanting them out of her rightful dominion,

as she considers it. Acophisinian has an intense personality,

and even without the aid of her frightful presence or a hyp-

notism spell  other  creatures  tend  to  find  her  either

enthralling or terrifying.

Jabidakimbatuul

Adult Blue Dragon

Young for a suzerain, Jabidakimbatuul has let the power go

to his head. By virtue of dwelling in an area that not many

blue  dragons  find  appealinga  temperate  desert  on  the

leeward  side  of  a  high,  cold  mountain  rangehe  is  the

oldest  of  perhaps  a  half-dozen  blue  dragons  within  hun-

dreds  of  miles,  and  thus  holds  the  title  of  suzerain.  He

enjoys commanding the younger dragons, meddling over-

much in their affairs, and disciplining any misstep or chal-

lenge on their part with violent retribution. He considers

himself  so  superior  to  these  younger  dragons  that  non-

dragons hardly even merit his noticewhich will likely

be the death of him.

Trundrachedandion

Mature Adult Blue Dragon

A devout worshiper of Tiamat, Trundrachedandion is wan-

tonly destructive and intentionally cruel. She fancies her-

self a cleric of the Chromatic Dragon, and counts a handful

of cleric spells among her spells known. She is not actually

a cleric, though someday she might aspire to the unholy rav-

ager of Tiamat prestige class (see Dragon Prestige Classes

in the Chapter ???). In the meantime, she contents herself

with wreaking as much destruction as possible on the world

around  her,  with  a  particular  emphasis  on  hunting  down

every brass or copper dragon that comes within a hundred

miles of her lair.

Vurlymakipvearox

Old Blue Dragon

Vurlymakipvearox  is  loud,  boisterous,  and  obnoxious.

Silence annoys him; even when soaring a mile above the

earth he roars, bellows, and laughs raucously to himself.

His prey inevitably hear him coming before they see him

but even such advance warning is seldom enough, for he is

as persistent and rapacious as he is noisy. A rushing river

runs through the caves at the bottom of his subterranean

lair, filling the entire lair with echoes of its splashing and

roaring.  For  obvious  reasons,  shout and sound  burst are

among  his  favorite  spells,  but  he  casts  every  spell  in  a

thunderous voice.

Renveshalhiarisv

Very Old Blue Dragon

A straggling line of barren peaks winds along one edge of a

great desert, as dry and desolate as the windswept sand far

below. Atop the highest of these peaks is the cavernous lair

of Renveshalhiarisv. To the troglodytes that live in smaller

caves on the lower slopes of the range, she is a raging force

of  nature,  a  living  embodiment  of  violent  storms  of  wind

and hail. They offer regular sacrifices to appease the dragons

wrath,  and  tremble  at  the  sound  of  her  approach.  Ren-

veshalhiarisv considers herself more a philosopher than a

destroyer,  howevera  student  of  subjects  natural  and

arcane,  a  repository  of  local  gossip  from  every  settlement

and tribe near her lair, and a keen judge of character. For all

her  scholarly  pretension,  however,  nothing  survives  for

long if it gets in her way when she is hungry.

Dreargakaduayrte

Ancient Blue Dragon

His eyes grown milky and blind with age, Dreargakaduayrte

shrouds himself with darkness at all times. His cavern lair is

draped with deeper darkness (cast using the Extend Spell feat

so he only needs to renew a given spell every 26 days) and

infested  with  shadows  he  made  with  create  undead. (The

shadows are intelligent enough to leave Dreargakaduayrte

alone,  though  he  has  no  magical  control  over  them.)  He

spends much time sleeping, and seems to be preparing to

enter his twilight. However, he is a simmering cauldron of

anger  and  resentment,  lashing  out  violently  at  any  living

creature that comes too near his lair while he happens to be

awake.  He  has  no  interest  in  conversation  or  negotiation,

only  in  deathother  creatures  first,  but  he  is  fascinated

with the concept of his own inevitable demise, after having

lived so long.

Aarazthoorus

Many  evil  dragons  never  aspire  for  more  than  selfishness

Aarazthoorus, however, is filled with as much unmitigated

malevolence  as  a  fiend  from  Hell,  and  has  the  power  to

wreak her evil upon the world. Her heart is untarnished by

any shred of mercy or compassion, any sentiment whatso-

ever, and every word out of her mouth is utter blasphemy

to  those  of  good  alignment.  Domination  and  tyranny  are

her life, and she seeks to expunge every trace of goodness

from her domain. She consorts with devils and traffics with

their lords as a near-equal. Her deep subterranean lair holds

a permanent gate to one of the layers of Hell, and she spends

nearly as much time there as on the Material Plane.

Lothaenorixius

Great Wyrm Blue Dragon

Lothaenorixius  is  a  dragon  possessed.  For  decades,  he

preyed  on  salt  caravans  crossing  his  desert  territory. The

people who operated the caravans and the mines that sup-

plied them constantly sought to eliminate the dragon. One

day, a group of adventurers hired by a mine owner located

Lothaenorixiuss lair and nearly succeeded in slaying him.

Enraged,  the  dragon  assaulted  the  mine  itself,  destroying

the owners and taking over the entire mine.

Lothaenorixius was quick to realize that the mine was a

source of wealth. Rather than destroy it, he kept it in opera-

tion. The dragon now spends his days and nights trying to

extract the maximum profit from his mine.

Lothaenorixius knows he must spend something on food

and lodgings for his workers and draft animals, but in his

greed he begrudges every copper spent. He constantly tries

to  produce  the  maximum  profit  for  the  minimum  invest-

ment. He makes extensive use of undead labor, but undead

creatures do not work quickly enough to satisfy him. As a

result, he finds some living workers a necessity, especially

for transporting salt to market.

Every three months, Lothaenorixius reviews production

and income, then makes adjustments to his workforce. This

usually entails killing and eating some workers (though he

always saves some bodies for later animation as undead). If

hes  particularly  displeased  with  the  results,  even  his  fol-

lowers and cohorts feel his wrath.

In  spite  of  his  management  methods,  Lothaenorixius

tries to keep a low profile. He has circulated a tale of his

defeat  at  the  hands  of  the  party  who  unsuccessfully

assaulted  him  in  his  lair.  He  runs  the  mine  through  his

special  cohort  Lilanab  (currently  his  8th,  the  previous

seven  having  been  slain  as  examples  to  the  rest  of  the

workforce). Lilanab is an erinyes devil who masquerades

as  a  human  and  poses  as  the  leader  of  the  group  that

killed Lothaenorixius.

Parties are more likely to encounter Lothaenorixiuss ser-

vants that the dragon himself, unless they attack and loot

the mine. Lothaenorixius comes forth to defend his holding

if he perceives any threat. He also occasionally takes wing

just  to  feel  and  breathe  the  hot  desert  air,  or  to  disrupt  a

competitors trade.

Lothaenorixius spends most of each day keeping tabs on

business at the mine. He uses prying eyes spells and a crystal

ball to monitor activities throughout the place. This surveil-

lance usually gives him ample warning of any attempts to

invade his lair.

Lothaenorixius  usually  tries  to  disguise  himself  before

entering combat. He uses his veil ability to appear as some

other big, flying creature. A gynosphinx or a brass dragon

are two of his favorite guises.

Lothaenorixius stays hidden in a vast, secret chamber in

the salt mine he has taken over. The mine and the complex

of  buildings  that  support  it  are  home  to  more  than  300

beings.  These  include  Lilanab  and  more  than  50  clerics

with access to the Evil and Earth domains, dozens of mum-

mies, and about 100 zombies. The remainder (around 150

individuals) consists of overworked slaves of various kinds

(mostly  humans).  Every  resident  with  an  Intelligence

score is aware that an unseen master controls the mine, but

only  Lilanab  and  the  clerics  know  their  overlord  is  the

great blue wyrm Lothaenorixius.

SAMPLE BRASS DRAGONS

Listed below are twelve sample brass dragons, one of each

age category. The descriptions include basic personality and

encounter notes that the DM will want to flesh out for his

campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Mychasi

Wyrmling Brass Dragon

Mychasi  loves  to  talknonstopabout  anything,  but

tends  to  steer  any  conversation  toward  topics  he  knows,

even when doing so forces him into a non sequitur. When

unable to converse with a sapient creature, Mychasi happily

converses with passing animals, or simply talks to himself.

Adventurers can often get useful information about local

events  from  him,  but  only  after  engaging  in  an  extended

chat in which the little dragon relates a seemingly endless

stream of superfluous details.

Mychasi: Male  wyrmling  brass  dragon;  CR  3;  Tiny

dragon (fire); HD 4d12+4; hp 30; Init +0; Spd 60 ft., burrow

Poccri

Very Young Brass Dragon

Poccri  is  a  dragon  on  the  run.  Forced  out  of  her  lair  by  a

marauding  band  of  gnolls,  she  now  finds  herself  hunted

216

throughout  her  territory.  Strangely,  the  gnolls  seem  pro-

tected  against  her  frightful  presence,  uncowed  by  her

combat prowess, and not satisfied by just taking over her lair

and stealing her hoard. The reason behind this uncharacter-

istic  behavior  is  a  gnoll  cleric  who  has  taken  Poccris

destruction as a personal quest in honor of Erythnul.

Poccri never stays in the same place for long, rarely curl-

ing  up  in  the  same  crevice  for  more  than  one  night.  She

expends  all  her  energy  fighting  the  gnolls  where  she  can

and seeking allies in the desolate land of her territory.

Poccri: Female  very  young  brass  dragon;  CR  4;  Small

Vultsubai

Young Brass Dragon

Unlike  many  of  his  kind, Vultsubai  enjoys  the  fine  art  of

conversationnot simply the sound of his own voice. He

lairs near a large city, and his favorite topic of conversation

is local gossip about the humans and dwarves who live in

the  city.  He  knows  intimate  secrets  about  people  he  has

never met, simply finding their quirks, habits, and misad-

ventures  a  source  of  endless  fascination.  He  finds  the

dwarves especially interesting, since their personalities are

generally so different from his own. He can eagerly listen to

the most long-winded dwarf recite a lengthy clan history in

Dwarven without showing a trace of boredom.

Vultsubai: Male  young  brass  dragon;  CR  6;  Medium

Amnehodenphinix

Juvenile Brass Dragon

Amnehodenphinix has a friend and mentor from whom she

is virtually inseparable: a gynosphinx named Taerhanna. The

dragon  imitates  the  sphinxs  mannerisms  and  shares  her

love of puzzles and riddles. The two engage in witty banter

during  nearly  every  waking  moment,  weaving  complex

multilingual puns in an unending contest of cleverness and

ingenuity. While Amnehodenphinix remains so young, the

sphinx  is  clearly  her  superior  in  this  match  of  wits.  The

dragons greatest fear is that Taeranna will dieof old age if

not from violencebefore Amnehodenphinix can best her

intellect  (quite  likely,  since  Amnehodenphinix  will  not

attain an 18 Intelligence for over 5 centuries).

Alazphraxion

Young Adult Brass Dragon

Alazphraxion likes to set things on fire. He is not destruc-

tive,  he  simply  finds  fire  beautifuland  sometimes  loses

track  of  what  is  burning.  He  tends  to  toy  with  fire  while

talking (which he does as much as any brass dragon), which

can have an unnerving effect on his conversation partners,

but he is oblivious to their discomfort.

Alazphraxion makes his lair in a series of volcanic cav-

erns  in  a  mountain  range  at  the  edge  of  a  great  desert.

When he has no one to talk to in his lair, he enjoys splash-

ing lava around and observing its effects on various other

substances.

Iksagyarjerit

Adult Brass Dragon

Iksagyarjerit considers herself a peerless judge of talent and

character.  In  her  earlier  years,  she  befriended  a  young

human  named  Erjanus  who  had  unwillingly  become  a

wizard because his parents wished it. But Iksagyarjerit could

see that the humans heart yearned to fight for truth and jus-

tice, so she eventually persuaded him to become a paladin.

Though  he  died  soon  afterward  fighting  for  truth,  she  is

convinced that he was truly happy. Since then, Iksagyarjerit

has dedicated herself to aiding as many other beings as pos-

sible in finding their true professionsfor their own good,

of course.

Urevhocymkearsus

Mature Adult Brass Dragon

Livoxdrinacepsek

Old Brass Dragon

Urevhocymkearsus is full of questions. He finds the work-

ings  of  other  creatures  minds  endlessly  fascinating,  and

seeks to learn how they think. Beyond benign interest, how-

ever, Urevhocymkearsus enjoys manipulating the thoughts,

emotions,  and  actions  of  other  creaturesthrough  both

magical and mundane means. He is particularly interested

in  what  makes  creatures  such  as  humanoidsbeings  not

born to evil the way evil dragons or demons are, choose evil.

She has been known to tempt such creatures to commit evil

acts in order to learn what motivates them to abandon what

they believe is the right path. As a result of this whole fasci-

nation, he is extremely forgiving of evil humanoids, though

he has no tolerance for creatures of utter evil.

Livoxdrinacepsek is a Huge dragon with a Colossal personal-

ity. Every movement of his enormous body is exaggerated

he punctuates his loud, loquacious speech with flamboyant

gestures, paces back and forth when he speaks, and brings

his gigantic face deafeningly close to his audience to really

drive a point home. His speech is melodramatic and histri-

onic,  and  he  expects  appreciation  if  not  applause  for  his

every  action.  Some  creaturesparticularly  humans  of  a

similar temperamentfind his company delightfully enter-

taining, while many others find him overwhelming or ter-

ribly irritating.

Suncamilahsundi

Very Old Brass Dragon

Suncamilahsundi  has  seen  enough:  All  these  humans  are

just ruining the world; thats all there is to it. The days of her

youth, some seven centuries ago, were the best years the

world has ever known, and its been all downhill from there.

Not that shes bittershe certainly doesnt hate humanity,

but she cant keep from shaking her head and clucking her

tongue every time she sees a human, remembering what it

was like before they built that city too close to her lair and

started  messing  everything  up.  She  keeps  up  with  all  the

news of the area, but none of it pleases her, and shes equally

sour about the state of the natural world. Like most brass

dragons,  she  shares  her  opinions  with  anyone  who  will

listen, and is more than willing to make people listen if she

feels they really need a talking-to.

Ariikdasadakuundax

Ancient Brass Dragon

Other  good  dragons  worry  about  Ariikdasadakuundax,

while evil dragons laugh at him. He is all too willing to part

with  his  treasure,  always  making  sizable  donations  to

worthy causes. Every good-aligned temple within 100 miles

of his lair has the name of Ariikdasadakuundax inscribed

on a lintel or a cornerstone in honor of his generous gifts,

and  there  are  countless  stories  of  people,  once  down  on

their luck, who have the dragon to thank for their present

improved  circumstances. The  reason  for  his  unusual  gen-

erosity is as straightforward as it is tragic: in his youth, Ari-

ikdasadakuundax  was  even  more  avaricious  than  most

dragons. Through a complicated series of events his greed

caused  the  death  of  his  lifelong  mate.  In  her  memory,  he

Conjazmynabryte

Wyrm Brass Dragon

In the center of a great desert, a narrow pillar rises impos-

sibly high into the sky, a remnant of or monument to some

long-lost civilization. High on its apex, Conjazmynabryte

222

basks in the hot desert sun and bathes in the cool night

air.  Among  nearby  communities,  legend  holds  that  she

will  answer  any  question  put  to  her  by  someone  who

climbs the pillar to reach her, but she attacks anyone who

flies to the height.

She has lost much of the love of conversation she had in

her youth, mainly because she is tired of answering insipid

questions from idiots who happen to be strong enough to

scale the pillar. She no longer couches unpleasant truths in

soft language, instead being painfully blunt with advice and

criticism, in an attempt to bring any conversation to a hasty

end. The only thing known to have brought her down from

her pillar-lair is the sight of a blue dragon entering her ter-

ritory. Most blues know better.

Fellithysaar

Great Wyrm Brass Dragon

As  old  as  his  desert  home,  Fellithysaar  speaks  with  the

wisdom of ages in his low, rumbling voice. Unlike Con-

jazmynabryte, he gladly shares his thoughts with anyone

who will listen, hoping thereby to make the world better

for his having been in it. Scarred from literally hundreds

of  past  battles,  Fellithysaar  knows  his  end  is  near,  and

meets every possible threat wondering, Will this be my

doom at last? An aura of resigned melancholy surrounds

him, yet his endless stories are full of heroism, virtue, and

hope. He has an acute appreciation of tragedy, and loves

tales of valiant self-sacrifice and painful struggles against

overwhelming odds.

SAMPLE

BRONZE DRAGONS

Listed below are twelve sample bronze dragons, one of each

age category. The descriptions include basic personality and

encounter notes that the DM will want to flesh out for his

campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Water Breathing (Ex): All bronze dragons can breathe

underwater  indefinitely  and  can  freely  use  their  breath

weapons, spells, and other abilities underwater.

Skills: A  bronze  dragon  can  move  through  water  at  its

swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10

on  a  Swim  check,  even  if  distracted  or  endangered.  The

dragon can use the run action while swimming, provided it

swims in a straight line.

Immersa

Wyrmling Bronze Dragon

Immersa is as playful as a dolphin and curious as a cat. She

seldom sits still. Immersa loves animals, and makes frequent

use  of  her  speak  with  animals ability.  She  has  befriended

almost every creature that swims, flies, or crawls along her

section of rocky seacoast. She finds humanoid fishers and

hunters somewhat distasteful. While she would never deny

a being sustenance or a means of making a livelihood, she

remains alert for signs of over harvesting, killing for sport,

or cruelty. From time to time, Immersa aids shipwrecked

sailors,  helping  them  to  shore  and  sending  them  inland

toward civilization. This gives her a good reputation among

the local sailors even if the hunters and fishers dont care

for her much.

Eyruaad

Very Young Bronze Dragon

Older bronze dragons shake their heads and write him off

as  another  youthful  idealist,  but  Eyruaad  sees  himself  as

something more like a paladin. While other bronzes may

be content to let evil dragons make their lairs nearby and

hatch  who  knows  what  evil  plans,  Eyruaad  believes  in

taking the fight right to evils front door. He does not tol-

erate any evil creatures presence anywhere near his (rather

small)  territory,  especially  evil  dragons.  He  uses  a  wide

network of animals and humanoids to keep him informed

of  attacks  by  evil  creatures,  and  personally  investigates

each such report in order to protect the innocents in his

care.  His  major  failing  is  an  eagerness  to  do  battle,  with

little regard for his actual chance of success. So far, his luck

has not failed him, but it might not be long before Eyruaad

needs protection himself.

Louteah

Young Bronze Dragon

Though she would never admit it or accept anyone saying it

of her, Louteah is a coward. All bluster, she puts on a good

show, and is quite capable of sending weaker enemiesor

gullible  onesfleeing  in  fear.  However,  when  she  cant

avert  a  fight  through  intimidation,  frightful  presence,  or

repulsion gas, she tends to fly away, usually with a comment

such as, Youre not a worthy challenge! She saves her bel-

ligerence  for  evil  creatures,  of  course,  and  is  quite  kind

among  friends  and  like-minded  alliesas  long  as  no  one

calls her bravery into question.

Plantagonox

Juvenile Bronze Dragon

Plantagonox is a spy. When evil forces threaten the human

kingdom near his lair, he uses a combination of his alter-

nate form ability and his Disguise skill to infiltrate their

ranks,  learn  their  plans,  and  bring  about  their  undoing.

The  nature  of  his  work  makes  him  somewhat  grim  and

rather  morbid.  He  has  a  wry  sense  of  humor  few  others

can  appreciate,  focusing  largely  on  the  various  forms  of

death and dismemberment he has been forced to witness

and, often, only narrowly escaped himself. He never tries

to  paint  himself  as  a  hero,  however,  and  actually  avoids

any direct conversation about his missions. Having spent

so much time undercover, living a lie, he finds it almost

impossible  to  trust  anybody.  As  a  result,  though  he  is  as

gregarious as most bronze dragons, he is extremely private

and  avoids  revealing  anything  about  himself  that  might

give an enemy an advantage.

Cybilenemarea

Young Adult Bronze Dragon

Cybilenemarea has dedicated her life to fighting the wide-

spread piracy near her home. In human form (or occasion-

ally a different humanoid form), she hires herself out as a

sailor on merchant ships, touting her minor spellcasting

ability  as  a  selling  point  if  necessary.  She  has  spent  so

much time in this guise that she is actually quite a compe-

tent  sailor.  Being  on  ships  has  brought  her  into  contact

with dozens of pirate vesselsincluding some that hired

her  without  initially  revealing  their  true  missionand

allowed  her  to  protect  her  fellow  sailors  while  bringing

quite a number of pirate captains to justice. She is some-

thing of a local legend, though she tries not to reveal her

own true nature even in the midst of a pirate attack. She

never takes the same human form twice, using Disguise

to alter her appearance beyond what even alternate form

allows, in order to avoid attracting unwanted attention

positive or negative.

the area call him Darkblade and regard him with a mixture

of gratitude, awe, and fear. The nearby elves, likely suspect-

ing more of his true nature, call him Aisveraen, which trans-

lates  as  Noble  Eyes.  Among  humans,  Kepsektokiversvex

tends to be gruff and taciturn, but he opens up and laughs

freely  in  elven  company.  In  battle  with  sahuagin,  he  is

relentless,  deadly,  and  absolutely  silent,  for  his  hatred  of

those foul creatures is all-consuming.

Hezjinglahjonan

Mature Adult Bronze Dragon

Hezjinglahjonan is an eccentric. Her seaside lair is filled

with items better described as knick-knacks than treasure,

though  she  defends  them  as  vociferously  as  any  dragon

guards its hoard. She wanders the beach near her lair, often

in human form, collecting odd-shaped pieces of driftwood,

interesting  shells,  and  flotsam  from  the  shipwrecks  that

are all too common along that stretch of coast. If she hap-

pens to see a ship foundering off shore, she immediately

swims out (in her natural form) to rescue as many sailors as

she  can,  bringing  them  to  shore  and  abandoning  them

there. Humans who interact with her in dragon form tend

to  come  away  with  the  impression  of  a  doddering  old

woman, but she chooses young, attractive, and frequently

male alternate forms.

Kepesksippiolosnin

Old Bronze Dragon

Kepesksippiolosnin  considers  himself  a  connoisseur  of

beauty.  He  does  not  tolerate  simple  gold  coins  in  his

hoardhe much prefers platinum for its shine, but accepts

gold if the coins are artistically minted or extremely old. He

is far more interested in objects of art than in coins anyway,

and particularly admires masterwork musical instruments

and items of sculpted glass. His lair is an abandoned human

templelarge and spacious, with grand columns, high ceil-

Ofkrysantemiselni

Very Old Bronze Dragon

The  self-appointed  guardian  of  the  wharves  in  a  major

coastal  metropolis,  Ofkrysantemiselni  spends  most  of  her

time in the form of an old dwarf with a knack for carpentry.

While not a shipwright, she makes cabinetry, rudders, oars,

chests, and other wooden objects used on ships, as well as

building and repairing docks. This pastime keeps her aware

of activity in the dockside area, and she has made herself

the nemesis of a criminal organization running a protec-

tion racket there. She is a fascinating conversation partner,

knowledgeable about many subjects and stunningly intelli-

gent, while possessing an unusual amount of humility and

graciousness for a dragon.

Aujigweybermanoth

Ancient Bronze Dragon

Aujigweybermanoth lives near a small fishing village, and

spends  a  great  deal  of  time  in  the  form  of  a  wizened  old

fisherman, mending nets and sharing stories with the folk

of the village. Unlike many dragons, he makes no attempt

to  conceal  his  true  nature;  he  simply  takes  human  form

because it is easier for the humans to talk with him that way.

The villagers think of Aujigweybermanoth as their protec-

tor and champion, and even attribute the abundance of fish

in their waters to his care, which is one thing he has noth-

ing to do with. He laughs frequently, shares long sagas and

anecdotes readily, and loves his people deeply.

where she lived shared some of his theoretical explorations

of magical principles with her, and she was hookedshe

studied with him until he died, then carried on her studies

of  arcana  and  spellcraft  for  decades  more.  She  travels

widely now, visiting libraries, universities, and renowned

sages and scholars of magic in order to increase her knowl-

edge. Like all bronze dragons, she hates chaos and evil, but

her greatest hatred is reserved for those who, as she puts it,

pervert  magic  to  the  service  of  evilparticularly  necro-

mancers and evil conjurers.

Kielistanilopais

Great Wyrm Bronze Dragon

Kielistanilopais has had a full lifemany lives, one might

say. She has lived extensively among humans, including a

lengthy period serving as a cohort and mount to a mighty

paladin who only recently died in battle. She has lived in

more humble disguise in human villages and towns, hunted

evil dragons in coastal forests and mountains, raised three

wyrmlings to young adulthood, and sought enlightenment

in a solitary undersea retreat. Now, her grief over her epic

paladin companion still fresh, she devotes all her energy to

hunting the blackguard who caused her loss. She has left her

hoard guarded by her three children (now adults), and trav-

els far and wide in search of the villain.

of  them,  which  is  quite  often.  She  lives  in  a  narrow  gully

where a stream emerges from a hillside, babbling along with

the water. A young red dragon, Fylokkipyron, lives uncom-

fortably close, and the two have a long history of conflict

which  invariably  ends  with  Rhindani  fleeing  for  her  life,

but shouting some humorous song about the encounter as

she goes.

Snydil

Young Copper Dragon

Acydiphul

Wyrmling Copper Dragon

Acydiphul  has  a  penchant  for  wordplay  and  seldom  can

resist plying any intelligent creature he meets with riddles,

limericks, puns, and even the occasional double entendre.

When not practicing the art of verbal offense, he spends his

time crawling all over the local rocks hunting for spiders,

centipedes,  and  scorpions  to  eat.  He  sticks  his  nose  into

every nook and cranny.

Snydil  has  an  abiding  fascination  with  magic  items,  and

enjoys using those he finds rather than stockpiling them in

his  hoard.  In  fact,  he  often  uses  coins  and  gemstones  he

acquires to purchase magic items he can carry and use, and

he keeps only a few items in his lair. Without a hoard to pro-

tect, Snydil roams widely, often staying away from his lair

for weeks at a time. He is an accomplished prankster, and

purchases magic items that facilitate his trickery. He is con-

sidering saving up for a ring of invisibility.

Ladunappindon

Juvenile Copper Dragon

A large town of gnomes nestled in a rocky valley has a guard-

ian few such communities can boast. Ladunappindon makes

her lair in a large house carved into a cliff side in the midst

of the town. She is not by any means an accomplished illu-

sionist, but she entertains young gnomes greatly with comic

presentations created with silent image and narrated by the

dragon  through  ventriloquism. She  contributes  her  modest

magic and significant combat prowess to the defense of the

town from a neighboring tribe of goblins who still occasion-

ally dare to make raids on the gnomes.

Vijaylommaxius

Young Adult Copper Dragon

No  less  a  prankster  than  other  copper  dragons,  Vijaylom-

maxius at least plays his pranks in service of a greater cause.

His lair lies at the edge of a tyrants domain, whose people

are heavily burdened with taxes and oppressive regulations.

Vijaylommaxiuss  pranks  are  usually  directed  toward  the

tyrants soldiers and tax collectorshe takes every oppor-

tunity to humiliate them and foil their errands for the king.

Unfortunately, each time the kings agents are hindered in

their duties, the king orders reprisals against the common

folk. Spurred by this injustice, Vijaylommaxius is growing

increasingly angry, and his pranks are getting much more

seriousand deadly.

natives above all others. Her knowledge of other planes in

general is quite extensive, thanks to her good relationship

with a number of renowned dwarf and deep gnome schol-

straining to keep her voice slow and low, searching for just

the  right  rumble  in  her  throat,  but  she  quickly  loses

patience  for  that  affectation  in  an  extended  conversation

Turuntmenkajanki

Old Copper Dragon

Hypvaliidedarix

Mature Adult Copper Dragon

Hypvaliidedarix is most often found in the company of a

band of wood elves, and his taste in music and humor is

somewhat  elevated  above  the  copper  dragon  norm  as  a

result. His humor relies on elaborate word plays (often in

Elvish) and goes over the heads of most other creatures,

and he doesnt care for what he calls the gnome pranks of

other  copper  dragons.  He  enjoys  flying  at  top  speed

through the light forests around his canyon home, racing

fleet-footed elves who certainly have the edge in maneu-

verability.  Even  more,  he  enjoys  their  evening  feasts,

where they share fine food, song, and dance. In his mind,

the life of these simple people, the plain beauty of their

Sworn  to  hunt  devils  for  the  rest  of  her  days,  Turunt-

menkajanki is rather more serious and intense than most

copper dragons. Though she often regrets what she now

recognizes as an oath sworn in haste without due consid-

eration  of  its  repercussions,  her  own  personal  sense  of

honor compels her to obey it, and so she is an old dragon

without  a  home  or  hoard,  with  no  children,  and  who  is

haunted by the taint of evils touch in her very soul. When

she was a juvenile, Turuntmenkajankis parents and a close

friend of theirs, a human bard, were all slain by a trio of pit

fiends. When Turuntmenkajanki found their bodies, she

had to tell the bards husband what had happened, and his

grief so moved the dragon that she swore an oath on the

spotnot just to avenge their deaths, but to make war on

Drumduruhullwix

Very Old Copper Dragon

Keicjannicarayas

Ancient Copper Dragon

Incorrigible is perhaps the best word to describe Drumdu-

ruhullwix, and he would hasten to add, So dont encourage

me!  Puns  are  his  meat  and  drink,  and  he  hasnt  given  a

straight answer to any question in over three hundred years.

(And yes, he is keeping track.) Engaging in conversation

with him is like fencing with a vastly superior foe: Every

sentence,  every  word  means  what  he  wants  it  to  mean,

At the bottom of a vast, yawning chasm in the midst of a wild

mountain  range,  Keicjannicarayas  makes  her  lair.  There,

where the clear blue sky is just a sliver shining between the

towering walls of rock, she passes years lost in conversation

with her one companion: a titan named Parakoursos, impris-

oned here eons ago for a crime against the deities that he

does  not  reveal.  The  titans  knowledge  and  wisdom  are  a

match  for  the  dragons,  and  the  two  never  tire  of  probing

each others minds and hearts to learn more about the uni-

verse and about each other. Keicjannicarayas brings the titan

food and water, tells him what she sees in the world above,

and cares for him tenderly. Parakoursos, for his part, would

do anything for her, but his imprisonment makes him virtu-

ally helpless. In the last year or so, however, Keicjannicarayas

has  come  to  believe  that  Parakoursos  holds  some  piece  of

information that is vital to the survival of the cosmos, one

item of knowledge he does not share even with her that is

somehow  related  to  his  imprisonment.  This  suspicion  is

beginning  to  cast  a  pall  over  their  conversations,  and  now

they sit together in silence at times, often for days at a time.

Bruntutalephion

Wyrm Copper Dragon

Like a plague of vermin, young red dragons seem to keep

cropping  up  in  Bruntutalephions  territory.  His  current

working theory is that an extremely prolific female seeded

the  highly  volcanic  region  with  eggs  over  a  period  of

decades, and the hatched young are reaching young adult-

hood, worming their way from their underground nests to

the surface, and emerging to spread chaos and destruction

through his precious lands. It can take as long as a year for

Bruntutalephion to hunt down and exterminate a single red,

and  he  increasingly  finds  himself  facing  packs  of  canny

juveniles  and  young  adults. Three  or  four  young  reds  at  a

time is enough to give even a mighty copper such as Brun-

tutalephion some difficulty, and he is growing tired of the

endless war.

Ugilanistorda

Great Wyrm Copper Dragon

Ugilanistorda is the laughing ruler of a quiet sylvan domain

populated with all manner of fey. Like a faerie queen, she

presides  over  unceasing  banquets  in  a  quiet  glen,  sur-

rounded by sprites and satyrs, nymphs and dryads, centaurs

and unicorns, wild elves and a handful of treants. She is so

ancient that she seems to be almost a part of the earth where

she  liesrock  and  earth  are  embedded  in  her  hide,  and

grass and leaves sprout from her shoulders and tail. She and

her assembly have little tolerance for intrusion: Creatures

that enter her domain are usually trapped by the wild elves

and  brought  blindfolded  before  Ugilanistorda.  She  slays

creatures  her  pixies  tell  her  are  evil,  and  generally  sends

away good or neutral creatures unless they greatly impress

or amuse her.

SAMPLE GOLD DRAGONS

Detailed below are twelve sample gold dragons, one of each

age category. The descriptions include basic personality and

encounter  notes  that  the  DM  can  flesh  out  for  his  cam-

paign,  along  with  a  set  of  statistics  that  make  the  dragon

ready to play.

Alternate  Form  (Su): A  gold  dragon  can  assume  any

animal or humanoid form of Medium size or smaller as a

standard action three times per day. This ability functions

as a polymorph spell cast on itself at its caster level, except

that  the  dragon  does  not  regain  hit  points  for  changing

form and can only assume the form of an animal or human-

oid.  The  dragon  can  remain  in  its  animal  or  humanoid

form until it chooses to assume a new one or return to its

natural form.

Water  Breathing  (Ex): All  gold  dragons  can  breathe

underwater  indefinitely  and  can  freely  use  their  breath

weapons, spells, and other abilities underwater.

Skills: A gold dragon can move through water at its swim

speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial bonus

on any Swim check to perform some special action or avoid

a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10 on a

Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The dragon

can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims

in a straight line.

Luminia

Wyrmling Gold Dragon

Luminia is practically a newborn, currently being fostered

in the house of a wise and good king. She lives in human

form, appearing as a girl about 7 years of age. Visitors and

members of the household are quite taken aback when they

address her as a child and find themselves confronting the

formidable intellect of a gold wyrmling! Despite her youth,

she has full access to the king as well as his most trusted

and sagacious advisers. She frequently rides with a paladin

attached to the kings house, an exemplary woman named

Nhalia (LG female human Pal8). She is allowed to assume

her normal form only once each day, for no more than 1

hour. She uses this time to practice flying.

Tekumu Nho

Very Young Gold Dragon

Tekumu Nho has grown quite attached to a half-elf man he

regards as something between his pet and his child, a ranger

called Thoran  (LG  male  half-elf  Rgr12). The  two  stalk  the

wilderness  together,  hunting  Thorans  favored  enemies

(giants,  goblinoids,  and  gnolls).  The  ranger  puts  up  with

Tekumu Nhos relative clumsiness for the sake of his invalu-

able aid in combat. Most of the time, Tekumu Nho travels in

the form of a halfling, in order to get the benefits of Small

size and above-average Dexterity, or a ferret (same statistics

as a weasel) when stealth is essential.

Natintrapa

Young Gold Dragon

For such a young dragon, Natintrapa has endured events

that granted her a depth of faith and wisdom coveted by

dragons  five  times  her  age.  Her  parents  were  renowned

champions of Bahamut, instrumental in purging the earth

of countless evil dragons. By the time they neared their twi-

light, they had earned the unmitigated loathing of Tiamat,

who  finally  took  it  upon  herself  to  eliminate  them  when

they threatened one of her greatest champions, sending an

avatar to kill both great wyrms. Natintrapa was caught in the

struggle, and though both of her parents perished, she her-

self was rescuedby none other than an avatar of Bahamut.

Before leaving her, the Platinum Dragon bestowed his spe-

cial blessing on her, and she has devoted her life to follow-

ing in her parents footsteps.

Yunshenunomei

Juvenile Gold Dragon

A  large  atrium  ringed  with  exquisite  statuary,  a  cascading

fountain in the center, is the entry to Yunshenunomeis lair,

and  the  rest  of  the  mountaintop  lair  is  no  less  beautifully

appointed. The other rooms are spacious and airy, admitting

plenty of sunlight through open windows and skylights. He

is a passionate collector of art, with a particular fondness

for  sculpture  depicting  religious  subjects,  which  appears

in every room. He typically greets visitors (and intruders) in

the atrium in human form, wearing a silk robe and sandals.

He kneels on the floor while talking, and offers no better

seat to his guests.

without actually engaging in trade. She maintains an impec-

extensively  in  the  surrounding  lands  with  a  small

entourage of admirers and sycophants, and squanders her

considerable wealth on fine horses to add to her collection.

Beneath the appearance of a spoiled petty noble, however,

is the heart of a paladin. She displays her wealth largely in

order to lure thieves she can then capture and bring to jus-

tice, and rides outside the city on guard against evil crea-

turesand her sycophantic followers include a number

Clytanmoorninyx

Adult Gold Dragon

An older gold dragon once told Clytanmoorninyx, The fire

runs too hot in your veins. Master it, or it masters you. So

far, Clytanmoorninyx has failed to master it. He is easily

angered by the slightest insult (and his impeccable sense of

good manners makes him oversensitive to even minor vio-

lations of etiquette), and he considers the existence of evil

creatures in the world a personal insult. Though he has been

known  to  associate  with  royalty,  offering  counsel  particu-

larly in times of war, he chooses to spend most of his time

in isolated wilderness regions, away from the intrigue and

machinations that so infuriate him.

Zudinmulamshius has found what she considers to be the

best use of her considerable hoard: She has taken up resi-

wealthy noble, acting as a patron of adventurers. She offers

substantial  bounties  for  the  heads  of  evil  creatures  that

threaten the city or its outlying areas, and spends much of

her time researching valuable artifacts that might be useful

in fighting evil, then commissioning adventurers to locate

Shimanyo-Kocoi

Old Gold Dragon

Though his scales are covered with gouges and scars and

he  walks  with  a  pronounced  limp  thanks  to  a  poorly

healed injury, Shimanyo-Kocoi prefers his natural form to

any other. He wears his scars proudly, for they are the tro-

phies  of  many  hard  victories  against  countless  evil  foes.

He  generally  assumes  other  forms  only  so  that  he  can

more easily practice the art of pottery, a creative endeavor

that he finds relaxing. Though he is grim and relentless in

the  pursuit  of  evil,  Shimanyo-Kocoi  is  generally  well

mannered  and  quietly  cheerful,  and  laughs  loudly  and

deeply when amused.

Ayunken-vanzan

Ancient Gold Dragon

Ayunken-vanzan is a well-rounded dragon, with many inter-

ests and areas of expertise. He is sophisticated, polite, and

charming, and speaks with authority on dozens of subjects.

He is a connoisseur of fine jewelry, and a master jeweler in

his own right. His particular area of interest, at least at pres-

ent, is theology, and he actively seeks out the company of

celestials  in  order  to  discuss  matters  concerning  good

deities and the planes they call home. He enjoys adopting

the guise of a humanoid sage in order to visit universities

and other places of learning and consult with other experts

in his fields of interest.

Sheeredni-vaktar

Wyrm Gold Dragon

As if the abundance of evil in the world werent bad enough,

Sheeredni-vaktar is fond of saying, just look at the way sup-

posedly good people behave. She has no tolerance whatso-

ever for poor manners, bad grooming, offensive language,

orworst of allanything she defines as immorality. Her

definition goes far beyond any objective definitions of evil,

including such sins as impiety and irreverence, disrespect

for  ones  elders,  the  use  of  alcohol  and  other  drugs,  and

sexual promiscuity. Perhaps surprisingly, she does not take

issue with the prevalence of violence, and, in fact, quickly

resorts to violent measures to discipline those who offend

her sense of proprietyeven if that violence is just a back-

handed swat with her tail for nonlethal damage, accompa-

nied by a sharp-tongued admonition.

Riikano-alinaris

Great Wyrm Gold Dragon

The  library  of  Riikano-alinaris,  to  those  who  know  of  its

existence, is considered one of the finest in the world. The

dragon has amassed a collection of books from lands known

and  unknown,  purchasing,  trading  for,  and  even  copying

himself every book he can find. He does not bother with the

traditional wealth of a dragons hoardYou cant learn any-

thing from gold, he often says with a snortvaluing cur-

rency only insofar as it can be used to acquire more books.

His breadth of knowledge is astonishing, accumulated over

a  period  of  four  millennia.  As  his  twilight  approaches,

Riikano-alinaris is searching for an appropriate heir to his

collection. He has many children, but none of them have

proven to his satisfaction that their love of knowledge, and

of  books  in  particular,  is  great  enough  to  deserve  such  a

monumental inheritance.

SAMPLE GREEN DRAGONS

Detailed  below  are  twelve  sample  green  dragons,  one  of

each age category. The descriptions include basic personal-

ity and encounter notes that the DM can flesh out for his

campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Water  Breathing  (Ex):  All  green  dragons  can  breathe

underwater  indefinitely  and  can  freely  use  their  breath

weapons, spells, and other abilities while submerged.

Skills: A  green  dragon  can  move  through  water  at  its

swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10

on  a  Swim  check,  even  if  distracted  or  endangered.  The

dragon can use the run action while swimming, provided it

swims in a straight line.

Blister

Wyrmling Green Dragon

Blister counts herself among the woodland nobility, along

with  the  beasts  of  prey.  She  detests  laughter  and  merri-

ment, disliking elves and positively loathing pixies, grigs,

and  other  carefree  sylvan  folk.  She  stalks  through  the

trees,  high  and  low,  sometimes  winging  over  the  forest

canopy, sometimes fluttering among the boles of the trees,

sometimes slinking on foot. She has recently located the

dwelling place of a band of pixies and has attempted sev-

eral raids, but the pixies have thus far successfully evaded

her  attacks.  Her  last  sortie  left  her  entangled  while  the

pixies  danced  about  her  and  laughed  before  packing  up

their  meager  belongs  and  fleeing  into  the  forest.  Blister

has sworn revenge.

Chokedamp

Very Young Green Dragon

Chokedamp  fancies  himself  a  deadly  aerial  hunter  who

rules the skies above the forest canopy. At this stage of his

life,  however,  Chokedamp  stands  out  more  as  a  cunning

negotiator.  He  has  forged  a  partnership  with  a  pack  of

worgs whose territory overlaps his own, and through the

worgs, he has a loose alliance with a tribe of goblins. Choke-

damp and the worgs make a formidable team. The worgs

hunting has improved greatly thanks to aerial reconnais-

sance courtesy of Chokedamp, while the dragon has col-

lected considerable booty from creatures the worgs have

defeated  or  sniffed  out  for  the  dragon.  Still,  Chokedamp

and  the  worgs  distrust  each  other. The  dragon  finds  the

worgs failure to cower in his presence very annoying; he

is aware that the whole pack probably could best him in a

fair fight and that annoys him too. Chokedamp also fears

that the worgs goblin allies might raid his hoard while he

is absent.

Ottwarslyndanox

Young Green Dragon

Ottwarslyndanox has long been at odds with a small com-

munity of elves that live within the confines of the forest

that  she  considers  her  property.  In  her  younger  years,

Ottwarslyndanox made direct raids on the settlement, but

she was soundly repulsed each time. Now, though she is a

much greater force to be reckoned with, she approaches her

foes with more caution. She has learned not to expose her-

self to attack unless she is certain that she has the advantage

over her foes. Ottwarslyndanox has respect for spellcasters

and magic in general, and she looks forward to the day she

can  cast  spells  herself.  She  is  always  on  the  lookout  for

magic items that might give her an advantage, and she does

nearly anything (short of parting with treasure) to acquire a

new one.

Rynskald

Juvenile Green Dragon

Though he loathes all kinds of sprites and mercilessly hunts

those  who  still  dare  to  dwell  in  his  forest,  Rynskald  has

learned to use some of their tricks against them. He is fond

of using illusion cantrips to distract and disorient his foes,

and laughs harshly every time a spritewho should know

betterfalls for one of his tricks. Of course, he usually stops

laughing as soon as he gets the creature in his mouth, but he

has been known to chuckle even while swallowing.

Klorphaxius

Young Adult Green Dragon

Certain  groups  of  elves  have  been  known  to  build  entire

cities in trees, supporting their graceful buildings on plat-

forms among the branches so they seem almost a living part

of the tree. Klorphaxius discovered such a city and took a

fancy to it, and it is now hers. Her lair is in the largest tree,

where she has taken over the palace of the elven princeling

who  once  ruled  the  city. The  palace  required  some  retro-

fitting to accommodate her Large form, but the sundered

interior  walls  and  scattered  rubble  suit  her  temperament

perfectly, serving as a daily reminder of just how terrible

she is.

Kallionastiryne

Adult Green Dragon

Kallionastiryne  regards  every  inch  of  the  forest  where  he

dwells as his domain, and he likewise regards anyone who

sets foot inside without leave as a trespasser and vandal. His

uncompromising  defense  of  his  forest  has  won  him  the

grudging  admiration  of  a  few  druids;  however,  Kallionas-

tiryne often grants orcs, giants, or other evil creatures hunt-

ing and logging rights, demanding hefty bribes of gold and

gems and plenty of flattery as well. Kallionastiryne is not so

much worried about the welfare of his forest as he is about

being  recognized  as  its  owner.  Because  he  regards  these

deals as little more than temporary agreements with inferior

creatures, they seldom last long.

Kesikasumislox

Mature Adult Green Dragon

As biting as the odor of chlorine that hangs around her,

Kesikasumisloxs wit slashes her opponents morale. She

has  a  gift  for  sarcasm,  punctuating  every  slash  with  her

claws, wing buffet, or tail slap with a snide observation of

her  foes  weakness.  No  amount  of  injury  short  of  uncon-

sciousness can still her tongue, and even on the rare occa-

sions she is forced to flee a fight, she does so with a scathing

parting comment. No living creature escapes her contempt,

though she has learned to hold her tongue around the oldest

green dragons.

ical  devotion  to  the  purity  of  nature  threatens  to  end  the

logging operation that helps swell Othocintlydavareis cof-

fers: he has been content to tax the loggers, while the druids

are trying to drive them away. He wants to see the meddlers

gone,  and  certainly,  the  human  loggers  would  rather  pay

tribute to a dragon than suffer the raids of evil druids and

their animal allies. Some sort of cooperation, as strange as it

might be, seems almost inevitable.

Giixhosiptor

Very Old Green Dragon

Giixhosiptor loves to play. He spends much of his time in

his lair, concocting different games. He ventures out when

bored and seeks weak or gullible creatures with whom to

play some of his strange games. One of his favorite activi-

ties is to lure less powerful creatures, especially adventur-

ers, to his lair. He then tries to trap them, without killing

them.  After  making  them  give  up  a  large  percentage  of

their magical equipment, he offers it back if they perform

some small service for him. Then, he sends them out to run

an arbitrary errand, such as killing a chimera, tanning its

hide, and bringing him the skin for a rug. When the adven-

turers return, he is dissatisfied with the result, stating that

he had wanted a larger or smaller rug or one that was a dif-

ferent  color.  He  gives  the  adventurers  back  the  rug  and

perhaps  a  single  item  from  their  equipment,  and  then

sends them off again on a different, difficult, but equally

meaningless task. After two or three such exchanges, either

the creatures refuse to continue or Giixhosiptor has grown

bored and he decides to eat the creatures with whom he

has been playing.

Vaectorfinyairuxo

Ancient Green Dragon

Though he tries hard to be imperious and aloof as a green

dragon is supposed to be, Vaectorfinyairuxo has a hard time

overcoming his driving curiosity. Other greens sometimes

mock him, calling him a tarnished bronze, because he so

often drops the pretense of superiority in order to ask ques-

tions about the creatures that should be his prey. He wants

to  know  what  their  magic  items  do,  what  mission  brings

them  to  his  woods,  why  they  might  be  willing  to  die  in

combat with such a prodigious foe as himself, what they

would  like  done  with  their  remains,  who  grieves  their

inevitable demise, and so on and onoften enough, this

goes so long that combat simply never occurs.

Kranimatraxius

Wyrm Green Dragon

Kranimatraxius firmly believes that the minds of other crea-

tures  are  hers  to  do  with  as  she  pleases. Weak  and  pliable

compared to the iron will of a dragon, the minds of others

are so easily subject to insanity, feeblemind, mass suggestion

she  can  even  kill  creatures  with  their  own  imagination,

using phantasmal killer. Her breath weapon may be a direct

method of slaughtering her foes, but she derives such enor-

mous satisfaction from using her foes minds against them

that she often uses her poisonous gas only as a last resort.

Dimithkarjic

Great Wyrm Green Dragon

Dimithkarjic is convinced that his doom is upon him. He

doesnt  merely  wonder  whether  death  will  save  visit  him

soon, he actively expects it. He has known for centuries, he

says, that he would not live to see 2,000 years, but he is now

only months away, so his imminent demise is inescapable.

By  no  means  does  this  make  him  a  less  fearsome  foe  in

combat; he fights as fiercely as he did in his youth. He does

not  flee  a  battle,  however,  since  he  accepts  the  fate  he

believes is predetermined for him.

age  category.  The  descriptions  include  basic  personality

and encounter notes that the DM can flesh out for his cam-

paign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Scorch

Wyrmling Red Dragon

Greedy and destructive, Scorch seldom passes up a chance

to bully weaker creatures; he often plays with his prey like

some oversized, malicious cat. He takes equal joy in smash-

ing or burning buildings and other things made by mortal

hands  but  too  large  to  carry  off.  When  not  spreading

destruction,  Scorch  likes  to  fly  over  the  countryside  at

night. He often pauses near towns and villages, sizing them

up for future conquests, though he has yet to actually attack

a settlement.

Raaze

Very Young Red Dragon

Raaze  suffers  from  both  vanity  and  overconfidence.  She

wastes no time in revealing herself to foes, usually by flying

overhead to throw her shadow over a group or by perching

in a high place and imperiously demanding that characters

behold  her  magnificent  self.  She  expects  lesser  creatures

such as humanoids to lavish praise upon her and extol her

beauty, strength, and grace. If she fails to get the praise she

thinks is her due, she attacks. Characters who flatter Raaze

must still endure her demands for tribute, and even if they

pay  up,  find  themselves  invited  to  flatter  her  some  more.

Raaze never tires of hearing about herself, and usually does

not let her victims go until they have provided a sum of trea-

sure and assured her that she is simply too magnificent for

their small minds to describe.

Fylokkipyron

Young Red Dragon

Nothing irks Fylokkipyron like being mocked. Every insult,

every syllable of laughter, works its way under his scales like

a grain of sand, irritating him until he coats it with a pro-

tective  layer  of  seething  hatred.  The  vast  majority  of  his

hatred is directed at a very young copper dragon who has

dared to make her lair too close to his, a whelp named Rhin-

dani. The upstart provokes him incessantly, and somehow

always  manages  to  escape  his  fury,  traipsing  away  while

shouting some singsong insult in his direction. Fylokkipy-

ron  spends  hours  every  day  plotting  his  revenge  against

Rhindani,  imagining  the  various  ways  he  could  pull  her

internal organs out of her body, lingering especially long on

that cursed tongue.

Kalfyra

Juvenile Red Dragon

Kalfyra is a dragon in search of a lair and a mate. She roams

the countryside looking for a likely spot to settle down and

eventually  raise  a  clutch  of  wyrmlings.  Relatively  person-

able (for a red dragon), she often stops to talk to travelers or

other creatures who might be able to help her. Of course,

she often consumes such creatures shortly after the discus-

sion ends, but nobodys perfect. Kalfyra is particularly good

at sensing duplicity or weakness in her opponents, and uses

that information to her best advantage.

Drachenflagrion

Young Adult Red Dragon

Drachenflagrion collects art objects. He has agents in many

communities who seek out such objects, then deliver them

to specified locations where he picks them up before bring-

ing them back to his lair. He has his eye on a number of reli-

gious relics, but so far has not had the courage to go after

them himself.

Drachenflagrion  decorates  his  cave  with  a  variety  of

interesting objects, from silver flagons to sculptures to tap-

estries.  He  protects  his  lair  with  liberal  use  of  the  alarm

spell, and uses obscure object to conceal new arrivals to his

cave  for  the  first  week  or  two  (until  search  attempts  are

likely to have been called off ).

Melniirkumaukrekon

Adult Red Dragon

Ever since a pair of silver dragons slew her parents, Melni-

irkumaukrekon  has  held  a  special  place  of  hatred  in  her

heart  for  such  creatures.  She  uses  every  means  at  her  dis-

posal  to  track  down  unprotected  nests  or  the  offspring  of

her  enemies.  She  avoids  unnecessary  risks,  knowing  that

she doesnt yet have the power to face a silver dragon older

than her, much less a mated pair. Rather than press a losing

fight,  Melniirkumaukrekon  has  no  compunction  against

fleeing the scene, perhaps to return weeks or months later

with a better plan of attack.

Valinoghtorklax

Mature Adult Red Dragon

Valinoghtorklax is a dragon for hire. Warlords, bandit kings,

conquering wizards, and fiendish plunderers of all stripes

employ his services to devastate enemy armies and fortifi-

cations alike. His mercenary lifestyle sees him crisscross the

globe to take part in revolts, uprisings, border wars, demonic

invasions, and a variety of other conflicts. He is always paid

well for his services, demanding bonuses for slaying enemy

leaders. Because of his mobile nature, most of his wealth is

portable (or wearable).

His favored tactic is to engage enemies from the air, using

Flyby  Attack  and  Improved  Snatch  to  target  individual

opponents while using his quickened breath weapon to deal

rapid-fire devastation.

Sventsorggviresh

Old Red Dragon

Sventsorggviresh passes most of her time in her lair, where

she reclines on her vast pile of treasure and feels very satis-

fied  with  herself.  Always  loathe  to  leave  her  hoard,  she

seldom stirs from her lair except when hungry, even then

she  sometimes  cajoles  a  group  of  magma,  fire,  and  steam

mephits who share her lair into fetching her a snack (or at

last locating one for her). She distrusts the mephits, and usu-

ally seals her lair with a wall of force while shes out hunting.

She usually carries her wand of chaos hammer in one glove of

storing and he wand of fire shield in the other.

Sventsorggviresh has peppered her lair with magic mouth

and alarm spells to give warning of any intrusions. She has

also persuaded an evil cleric she once met to cast some for-

biddance spells (to prevent extradimensional intrusions) for

her. She has since done away with the cleric.

Urivayotornotach

Very Old Red Dragon

Urivayotornotach has a pathological hatred of adventurers.

He has turned his lair into an enormous deathtrap, fortify-

ing  it  with  pits,  tripwires,  and  the  like.  His  feat  and  spell

selections  are  aimed  at  maximizing  his  adventurer-killing

power while simultaneously protecting him from their typ-

ical attacks. He has learned from experience the folly of let-

ting pride or dignity interfere with his tactics, and is willing

to feign injury or cowardice or otherwise demean himself in

ways  that  other  red  dragons  might  not  in  order  to  gain  a

combat  advantage.  He  favors  hit-and-run  tactics,  forcing

opponents to bleed off their resources while drawing them

ever deeper into his cave network.

Durtaxsteingakila

Ancient Red Dragon

Durtaxsteingakila may well be the most powerful warlord

that no one has ever heard of. She has spent patient decades

building  alliances  with  other  powerful  creatures,  from

demons to slaadi to dark elves, with the eventual goal of

continental-scale conquest. Along the way, she has incited

conflict in various locales, each one carefully designed to

destabilize  a  local  ruler,  weaken  defenses,  or  otherwise

make her ultimate goal achievable. In some cases, she has

sacrificed her own allies in these battles, but always with a

long-term plan in mind.

Despite her many collaborators, no one truly understands

the scope of her plan. Many allies dont even know of each

others existence, and in fact, some have even come in con-

flict with one another. Thats just the way she likes it.

Bheilorveilthion  enjoys  personal  combat  with  powerful

opponents.  As  soon  as  the  battle  begins,  he  picks  a  target

within range and charges, using Dire Charge to make a full

attack (augmented by Power Attack), combining that with a

rend attack if he hits with both claws. This usually reduces

the  opponent  to  ribbons,  at  which  point  Bheilorveilthion

moves on to the next target (assuming any remain in sight

after his display of power). Its common for his battles to last

only a single round.

Syzdothyx

Great Wyrm Red Dragon

Syzdothyx desires immortality. Though she dabbled with

the  idea  of  becoming  a  dracolich,  she  ultimately  decided

that godhood was her goal. In her most egotistical moments,

she styles herself as a rival to the power of Tiamat herself

and her egotistical moments tend to outnumber her realis-

tic  moments  these  days.  In  the  short  term,  she  seeks  to

gain the attention of the draconic deity Garyx (see Reli-

gion in Chapter 2), perhaps becoming an avatar or consort

as a stepping-stone to even greater power. The value of her

hoard exceeds that held in the vaults of many small king-

doms, but she wont hesitate to use or sacrifice that hoard in

pursuit of her dream of divine ascension.

SAMPLE SILVER DRAGONS

Detailed  below  are  twelve  sample  silver  dragons,  one  of

each age category. The descriptions include basic personal-

ity and encounter notes that the DM can flesh out for his

campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Alternate  Form  (Su): A  silver  dragon  can  assume  any

animal  or  humanoid  form  of  Medium  size  or  smaller  as  a

standard action three times per day. This ability functions as

a polymorph spell cast on itself at its caster level, except that

the dragon does not regain hit points for changing form and

can only assume the form of an animal or humanoid. The

dragon can remain in its animal or humanoid form until it

chooses to assume a new one or return to its natural form.

Cloudwalking (Su): All silver dragons can tread on clouds

or  fog  as  though  on  solid  ground. This  ability  functions

continuously but can be negated or resumed at will as a

free action.

Nimbus

Wyrmling Silver Dragon

Nimbus has an insatiable appetite for doing good deeds and

for  learning  other  peoples  business.  He  finds  the  various

tasks and errands that humans tackle every day to be endless

fascinating, though he doesnt quite understand why theyre

so busy all the time.

He often trudges about posing as a human woodcutter, a

gnome peddler, or a big, shaggy dog. He gladly renders assis-

tance to anyone who needs it, and he tries anything though

hes not always up to the task. He once offered to chop wood

for an old widow and nearly chopped off a foot with the axe.

DC 14 negates.

Karaglen

Very Young Silver Dragon

Karaglen is a would-be crusader, an occasional joker, and an

all-the-time flirt. Often taking the shape of a half-elf youth,

she has a penchant for seeking out disputes between non-

evil people and using her humor and tact to resolve the sit-

uation. While  her  powers  have  yet  to  develop  (by  dragon

standards, anyway), Karaglen often impresses common vil-

lagers and low-level adventurers with her comparative skill

and maturity. If someone discovers Karaglens true nature,

she often presses the person to keep her draconic origin a

secret. She dislikes being the center of attention and prefers

to assist others rather than excel herself.

Namhias

Young Silver Dragon

When older silver dragons try to impress upon youngsters

of their race the importance of subtlety, level-headedness,

and patience, they seldom fail as spectacularly as they did

with Namhias. Some say this young dragon forced his way

out of his shell weeks before his hatchmates. Whether that

is true or not, Namhias has been in a hurry ever since. Easily

angered  by  injustice  or  bullying,  the  young  silver  dragon

rushes into combat at any real provocation. While he does

try not to kill those he can subdue, sometimes he forgets the

strength of whatever form he is currently in. When not dis-

playing  his  full  might  as  a  young  silver  dragon,  Namhias

likes to prowl the mountains in the form of a large, lithe cat

or a hulking human.

Stratiglynculcies

Juvenile Silver Dragon

Elegant and reflective, Stratiglynculcies has just begun to be

amazed at the world around her. An avid traveler, she finds

that  the  humanoid  races  simply  astound  her  with  the

amount of knowledge and wisdom they can collect in such

short  life  spans.  While  she  spends  much  of  her  time  in

humanoid  form  (usually  blending  in  seamlessly  with  any

race  or  culture),  she  has  been  known  to  assume  other

shapes in the pursuit of knowledge. Recently, Stratiglyn-

culcies has taken to accompanying good-aligned parties of

adventurers  in  expeditions  to  unexplored  lands  or  ruined

settlements. She often forgets what a rush these shorter-

lived creatures are in, however, and can be left behind when

she  spends  weeks  or  even  months  studying  a  new  find.

Lothirlondonis

Young Adult Silver Dragon

In  his  earliest  youth,  Lothirlondonis  found  he  could  not

change  shape  as  freely  as  his  hatchmates.  A  kindly  druid

took him in and helped the silver hatchling develop his

shapechanging skills. Ever since, Lothirlondonis has had

a love for the forest and for forest creatures. He even pays

homage to several nondraconic deities of the woodlands

(such  as  Ehlonna)  though  he  does  not  worship  them.

Lothirlondonis still spends most of his time in silver dragon

shape  but  sometimes  polymorphs  into  a  fey  creature  and

observes travelers who pass through his woods. If they show

respect and tend toward conservation, he may aid them or

protect them. If they do otherwise, Lothirlondonis does not

hesitate to correct them.

Sallahtuwlishion

Adult Silver Dragon

When Sallahtuwlishion entered adulthood, she resisted put-

ting  aside  her  favorite  nondraconic  guise,  that  of  a  village

innkeeper. Now, she still maintains the Silver Goblet Inn but

spends only a few days a month there. Most of the villagers

know of her draconic nature and cover Sals disappearances,

saying to outsiders that she has gone off to visit relatives and

her adopted daughter runs the place in her absence. Sallah-

tuwlishion  has  found  herself  dragged  reluctantly  into  dra-

conic politics. Because of her willingness to mediate disputes

and hold messages (useful talents for an innkeeper), she often

finds herself speaking on behalf of older or more powerful

dragons and other good or neutral beings.

Livezzenvivexious

Mature Adult Silver Dragon

An unusually draconic silver dragon, Livezzenvivexious has

little use for other forms. While he takes different shapes for

short times, he does nearly all his fighting in dragon form

and  Livezzenvivexious  does  a  lot  of  fighting.  Livezzen-

vivexious  loathes  evil  creatures  (particularly  demons  and

devils) and despises evil dragons. Those creatures who wor-

ship evil deities also make Livezzenvivexious their enemies.

He might use his power to polymorph to get himself into

an evil creatures lair or a sadistic cults stronghold, but when

an  adult  silver  dragon  appears  in  their  midst,  Livezzen-

Aesthyrondalaurai

Old Silver Dragon

Freilaclanbarin

Very Old Silver Dragon

Known throughout the planes as a master of lore and heal-

ing, Aesthyrondalaurai shares her insights with those who

can  find  her.  Legend  has  it  that  this  old  silver  dragon

always takes on a matronly form but seldom stays in one

place for long. Still, she does maintain her own lair, high

in  the  mountains,  and  keeps  a  strong  friendship  with

eagles, pegasi, and other airborne creatures. When some-

one seeks knowledge, Aesthyrondalaurai often sends out

her friends with clues to her location. If a seeker is per-

sistent enough, he or she can find Aesthyrondalaurai, but

it is never easy.

30 half (or higher if heightened); or 50-ft. cone, paralysis

Nearly eight hundred years old, Freilaclanbarin has yet to

reach his full strength and maturity, but he has a ready wit

and a clever tongue. Once, it is said, he spent a hundred

years in humanoid form advising a dwarven king but then

he grew bored with the dwarf s constant desire for wealth.

Freilaclanbarin  keeps  a  hoard  (as  almost  all  dragons  do),

but  he  despises  overt  greed.  Freilaclanbarin  often  trades

with good and neutral creatures, charging a fair price for

his  knowledge  or  his  treasures,  and  he  builds  his  hoard

through  rewards  and  trade.  When  Freilaclanbarin  does

fight, however, he is mighty. He battles from the sky and

uses his powerful breath weapon when he can, countering

others magic with his own.

Asaduanaivakka

Ancient Silver Dragon

Asaduanaivakka  Silverstar  considers  herself  a  front-line

warrior  against  the  forces  of  evil.  She  has  spent  many  of

her considerable years traveling the world and the planes

learning about the constant war between good and evil and

she feels it is her time to step up and do something about

it. Occasionally found in the form of a humanoid paladin,

Asaduanaivakka  inspires  and  supports  those  who  battle

great  evil.  She  has  been  known  to  employ  lower-level

adventurers  to  battle  lesser  evils,  in  the  hope  that  they

grow  into  powerful  heroes,  but  more  often,  she  joins  a

party of strong crusaders in climactic struggles. She has no

compunctions  about  revealing  her  draconic  nature  and

often  uses  her  considerable  reputation  as  leverage  when

seeking to join a party.

Kuulvaysheniruss

Wyrm Silver Dragon

It is hard to think of one of the oldest dragons in the world

as a sad, old man, but Kuulvaysheniruss the Venerated has

earned  that  description.  For  more  than  a  hundred  years,

Kuulvaysheniruss  was  the  cohort  of  a  mighty  paladin  in

the service of Heironeous, but the paladin was destroyed

and attempts to revivify her failed. Now, Kuulvaysheniruss

spends most of his time with his memories and doing little.

Still, every so often, a particular quest or problem awakens

Kuulvayshenirusss once-lively heart from its slumber and

he  becomes  the  powerful  dragon  songs  still  sing  of.  He

never takes humanoid form anymore, preferring to battle

as he did beside his paladin friend, breathing blasts of par-

alyzing gas and cones of frigid air.

Nymbryxion

Great Wyrm Silver Dragon

Nymbryxion the Shield of Law seldom visits the Material

Plane anymore, preferring instead the uninterrupted sky of

the  Elemental  Plane  of  Air.  If  she  does  travel  back  to  the

plane of her birth, she does so in the form of an ageless elven

woman  with  silver  eyes.  Nymbryxion  seldom  speaks  in

either  form,  preferring  to  listen  and  to  watch.  When  she

does speak, she cuts right to the heart of any matter and her

voice has the power of persuasion behind it. Nymbryxion

has  been  known  to  visit  elder  dragons  of  nearly  every

typeeven  chromaticto  advise  them  on  their  place  in

the world. Metallic dragons take her words to heart; chro-

matic dragons often fly into a rage at her presence but few

dare  attack  her.  Nymbryxion  is  an  unbelievably  powerful

opponent  and  many  creatures  of  many  planes  owe  her

favors. An enemy of Nymbryxion can find few places on any

plane to hide.

campaign, along with a set of statistics that make the dragon

ready to play.

Icewalking (Ex): All white dragons can move on icy sur-

faces as though using spider climb (as the spell).

Skills: A  white  dragon  can  move  through  water  at  its

swim speed without making Swim checks. It has a +8 racial

bonus on any Swim check to perform some special action or

avoid a hazard. The dragon can always can choose to take 10

on  a  Swim  check,  even  if  distracted  or  endangered.  The

dragon can use the run action while swimming, provided it

swims in a straight line.

Rime

Wyrmling White Dragon

Rime takes savage joy in hunting and is happiest when clos-

ing in for a kill. He delights in harrying and killing creatures

larger than himself. His favorite prey includes polar bears

and the occasional whale, provided he can catch the creature

in  shallow  water  where  it  cannot  readily  escape.  When

Rime is hungry, hes not picky about what he hunts.

Kalkol

Young White Dragon

Kalkol often takes to the water, skulking under ice floes and

other places where ice meets open water. A tireless hunter,

Kalkol also keeps a wary eye out for a band of frost giants

that have been entering his territory and stalking him for

months, The giants hope to capture Kalkol and force him to

serve them as a guard. Kalkol fears and hates the giants. He

resents  their  great  strength  and  their  immunity  to  his

breath weapon. Still, he is too stubborn to abandon his ter-

ritory to the giants, so he remains in the area, avoiding the

giants as much as he can.

Hrymgird

Very Young White Dragon

Hrymgird  is  equally  at  home  in  the  air  or  the  water.  She

loves  foggy  stretches  of  water,  especially  if  they  also  have

floating  ice,  protruding  rocks,  or  other  hazards.  In  such

places,  she  alternately  swims  on  the  surface  or  flies  just

above it on silent wings, looking for prey.

Hrymgird attacks just about anything she meets, except

dragons  bigger  than  herself.  She  has  a  pugnacious  nature

Haaldisath

Juvenile White Dragon

Brutal  and  direct,  Haaldisath  has  survived  for  this  long

due  primarily  to  her  extreme  cowardice.  She  has  just

enough wit to avoid capture or death at the hands of more

powerful  opponents  and  avoids  protracted  combat  with

any foe. If an enemy survives Haaldisaths powerful breath

and fends off a pass or two from the air, she flees. She may

return, if she has reason to believe her foes have sustained

significant damageor if they approach her lairbut she

Nidhogrym

Young Adult White Dragon

Nidhogryms overconfidence has led him to a sorry state in

life for any dragon. Captured by a small band of frost giants,

hes spent several years in captivity, serving a variety of dif-

ferent masters. The giants keep him on a leash of greed: they

allow  Nidhogrym  to  keep  a  portion  of  all  the  treasure  he

helps steal from their enemies, but he must keep it in their

lair. He is utterly miserable. Still, he makes up for that indig-

nity  with  ferocity.  Diving  out  of  the  air  and  attacking  the

frost  giants  foes  gives  him  a  fierce  joy,  and  Nidhogrym,

backed by such powerful allies, has defeated opponents of

greater power than he could normally hope to survive.

Cealdia  has  survived  many  years  in  the  frozen  northern

world by knowing her limitations. She is not the strongest,

smartest,  or  largest  predator,  and  she  realizes  plenty  of

creatures exist that are ready and willing to destroy her for

a variety of a reasons. She spends most of her time in her

laira complex series of underground, icy tunnelsand

often  uses  her  small  magical  skills  to  lure  enemies  into

traps or ambushes. When Cealdia must fight in the open,

she  prepares  ahead  of  time  and  prefers  fighting  from

above. She is a cautious opponent and is not above a little

judicious bargaining if things do not appear to be going

her way.

Bestlaranathion

Mature Adult White Dragon

Though intelligent, Bestlaranathion proves as capricious as

a  winter  wind  and  as  savage  as  any  wild  animal.  He  has

recently learned to speak Common, and has come to think

of  himself  as  something  of  a  diplomat.  Unfortunately,  his

efforts at diplomacy usually sink to the level of stark threats,

and even when he is able to browbeat an unfortunate crea-

ture into some kind of agreement, Bestlaranathion seldom

contains  his  baser  instincts  for  very  long  and  he  usually

winds up attacking his reluctant allies.

Bestlaranathion  frequently  roams  far  afield,  and  might

appear almost anywhere. About half the time, Bestlaranathion

simply tries to ambush characters, hoping for a quick kill. The

rest of the time, the dragon begins an encounter with some

show of force that brings his frightful presence into play, but

he  also  makes  at  least  a  half-hearted  attempt  to  negotiate

with the characters in some fashion. He might demand to

know their business, try to extort treasure, or simply con-

verse. Eventually, however, Bestlaranathions violent nature

gets the better of him and he attacks.

Yeridajniosjuth

Old White Dragon

Yeridajniosjuth spent many years nursing envy and hatred

of  those  more  powerful  than  she  and  now  this  cold  and

cruel white dragon is in a position for some payback. Rather

than  settle  into  a  lair  and  dominate  a  particular  territory,

Yeridajniosjuth entertains herself by hunting other dragons

and destroying or dominating them. Her favored opponents

are young or juvenile metallic dragons (particularly brass

or gold), but she is not above attacking red or even other

white dragons when she thinks she can win. Yeridajniosjuths

favorite  opponent,  however,  is  a  more  powerful  or  larger

creaturedragon,  giant,  or  anything  elsethat  has  been

wounded  by  another.  Nothing  makes  Yeridajniosjuth  feel

more pleased and superior.

Sepsecolskegyth

Very Old White Dragon

Unusually clever for a white dragon, Sepsecolskegyth has

a  personality  like  an  icy,  rusted  blade.  He  is  irascible,

unpleasant,  and  thoroughly  evil.  While  his  strength

assures  him  of  few  challengers,  Sepsecolskegyth  prefers

intimidation  to  overt  action.  Several  tribes  of  nomadic

humanoids pay the old villain tribute in food and treasure,

and recently hes even turned the tables on a tribe of frost

giants,  enslaving  a  half-dozen  or  so  to  do  his  bidding.

When threatened or challenged, Sepsecolskegyth makes

good use of his enslaved minions, his breath weapon, and

his  magic,  preferring  to  avoid  direct  physical  confronta-

tion whenever possible.

Csarivchizzik

Ancient White Dragon

Once  an  aggressive,  active  predator,  Csarivchizzik  has

slowed down somewhat with age. It is not a lack of courage

or power that changed her ways, but a growing knowledge

of the threats in the world around her. Abandoning her lair

in  the  northern  mountains,  she  carried  her  treasure  to  a

floating  glacier  far  from  the  nearest  coast.  Csarivchizzik

hunts whales and other sea creatures for food, and harries

shipping for sport and treasure. Wisely, she usually attacks

from  below  the  surface  of  the  water,  erupting  upward  to

spray her icy breath at surprised opponents. Csarivchizzik

has  a  fondness  for  extraordinarily  powerful  magic  items,

however,  and  she  can  be  lured  out  of  her  remote  lair  by

rumors of artifacts in the hands of those unable to defend

them from her predations.

Cheynchaytion

Wyrm White Dragon

One  of  the  most  powerful  dragons  in  the  world  Cheyn-

chaytion revels in his strength. He is wise enough to under-

stand the white dragons place in the world, but the ancient

wyrm  has  found  no  threat  he  cannot  overcome.  Cheyn-

chaytion enjoys luring challengers into his frozen, under-

mountain lair where he can use his icewalking abilities and

his magic to full effect. Whenever Cheynchaytion travels,

rumor of his coming arrives like a chill wind, and he leaves

the cold frost of dread behind. Supremely confident, Cheyn-

chaytion loves leaving survivors behind when he attacks

the more to tell of his glory and power.

Appendix 1:

The Dragons Hoard

DM: After  slaying  the  mighty  dragon,  you  loot  its  cavern.

After  youve  sold  everything,  the  total  treasure  value  comes  to

17,562 gp and 5 sp, including identification and appraisal costs.

Players: Yawn. Whats next?

He first reduces this to 6,000, then rolls 1d10 for the hun-

dreds, tens, and ones digits, getting results of 4, 5, and 1. This

comes out to 6,451 gpa nice, nonround number.

In  the  long  run,  this  method  slightly  reduces  the

amount  of  coinage  found  by  the  PCs.  If  youre  worried

about this small shrinkage, you can easily add in an item

of equivalent value elsewhere in the hoard. For instance,

using the example above, you could drop in another item

elsewhere in the hoard worth 500 to 600 gp to make up

If  you  and  your  players  are

becoming  bored  with  hoards,

it  may  be  time  to  spice  them

up  with  a  little  more  detail.

Few  players  get  excited  by

finding six gems worth 100 gp

each  or,  worse  yet,  three  art

objects worth 500 gp apiece. If

youve taken the time to craft

a  unique  dragon,  take  a  few

more minutes to craft a unique

dragons hoard.

The  three  basic  components

of  a  treasure  hoard  are  coins,

goods  (gems  and  art  objects),

and items (mundane and magic).

Within each of these categories,

there are plenty of opportuni-

ties  to  spice  up  what  the  PCs

find.  Next  time  they  come

across a hoard, heres what you

might hear:

Mialee: So  how  do

you  think  the  dragon

got  these  silver  pieces

from the kingdom across

the sea?

Lidda: Never  mind

that,  Im  too  busy

prying  the  emeralds

out of this granite statue.

Jozan: Hey, Tordek, help

me carry this platinum-inlaid teak-

wood table out of here!

Tordek: Sure,  just  let

me finish this cask of dwar-

ven ale I found. . . .

COINS

The first trick to making a pile of coins seem less generic

is to avoid round numbers. After youve determined how

many  thousands,  hundreds,  or  tens  of  coins  of  a  type  are

present, reduce the first digit by one (from 6,000 to 5,000, or

from 100 to 90). Then replace each remaining zero with

the result of a 1d10 roll.

Example: The  DM  rolls  2d6   1,000  to  determine  the

number of gold pieces in a hoard and gets a result of 7,000.

the difference.

Another option is to replace

the  coinage  with  another

form  of  currency.  Particularly

for  large  transactions,  coins

arent a very efficient mode of

currencypaper  money  is

easier to transport, and bars or

ingots are easier to count.

In  most  medieval  fantasy

cultures,  paper  money  is  a

rarity.  However,  IOUs,  letters

of  credit,  or  similar  prom-

ises of payment could easily

exist,  particularly  in  a  mer-

cantile  culture.  Such  an

item  is  literally  worth  far

more than its weight in

gold,  but  can  probably

only  be  exchanged

in communities of

reasonable  size.

As a rule of thumb,

no IOU worth more than

a  towns  gold  piece  limit

can  be  exchanged  in  a  community.  Whats

more, unless youre trading it to the person

who signed it in the first place, you may

only be able get one-half its value in coins

or goods (this is up to the DM and the sit-

uation).  Player  characters  desperate  to

get  full  value  might  end  up  traveling

from city to city in search of the merchant whose name

is on the certificate. Of course, theres no guarantee that

the item is genuine (see the Forgery skill, page 74 of the

Players Handbook), though you should use this sort of plot

device sparingly.

Bars or ingots of metal are particularly common in soci-

eties  that  deal  readily  in  such  goods,  such  as  those  of

dwarves and gnomes. They typically bear an identifying

stamp.  A  typical  trade  bar  of  precious  metal  weighs  1

pound and is worth 50 coins of the same metal.

1 Prices and weights given are per square yard.

As the Players Handbook points out (see Wealth Other than

Coins, page 112 of the Players Handbook), most wealth isnt

in the form of coins or currency of any kind. Its easy to

imagine  that  a  dragon  who  periodically  raids  merchant

caravans  might  have  a  hoard  that  includes  a  variety  of

trade goods. Since trade goods can generally be exchanged

for  full  value,  you  can  replace  a  quantity  of  coins  in  the

hoard for an equivalent value of one or more trade goods.

Of course, a shortage or surplus of certain trade goods in

a  particular  area  can  adjust  these  prices  dramatically,  at

your option. To generate these items randomly, use Table

A1: Trade Goods. Roll percentile dice to determine the

category of the item (Food, drink, and spices is one cate-

gory,  for  example),  then  roll  again  for  the  specific  item

within that category (such as Ale, common).The prices

given are per pound or pint (except for cloth, which is per

square yard).

If youre not interested in variety in your currency, you can

even inject a spark of interest into a pile of ordinary coins.

Since every coin typically bears the mark of the kingdom,

province, or city-state that minted it, simply putting a for-

eign  or  otherwise  unusual  mint-mark  on  your  coins  can

result in the characters asking interesting questions about

how the coins got there. If a dragons hoard contains plat-

inum coins bearing the imprint of a elf-headed spider, the

characters may (correctly or incorrectly) suspect an alliance

between the dragon and the drow.

GOODS

Of the three categories of treasure in a hoard, this one holds

the best opportunities for making your dragons hoard an

interesting  one.  After  all,  there  are  dozens  of  varieties  of

gems and virtually unlimited variations on art objects. In

some cases, you may create art objects so interesting that

the characters prefer to keep them rather than selling them!

Goods, particularly art objects, provide you with a great

opportunity  for  adventure  hooks.  Perhaps  the  characters

want to find the creator of a particular sculpture or paint-

ing, or the original occupant of an ancient ornate throne.

pqqqqrs

HOW BIG IS THE PILE?

As the Players Handbook states, a typical coin weighs about

one-third of an ounce (50 per pound). But how much space

do  coins  take  up,  and  how  big  a  pile  do  they  make  when

gathered into a hoard? And do dragons really sleep on beds

of coins?

A typical coin measures slightly more than an inch in diam-

eter  and  is  approximately  one-tenth  of  an  inch  thick.  A  cubic

foot (a volume 1 foot on each side) holds around 12,000 loosely

stacked coins.

space  for  a  Small  dragon  to  wallow  around  on,  and  even  a

Medium  dragon  can  derive  enjoyment  from  reclining  on

such a pile.

But larger dragons need an extraordinary number of coins to

create a pile large enough to sleep on. A Large dragon needs

at  least 50,000 coins to create a bed, while a Huge dragon

needs 100,000 or more. Gargantuan or Colossal dragons might

require piles of a half million or more coins in order to create

a  true  bed.  And  even  then,  this  isnt  an  enormous  pile  but

little more than a relatively thin layer of coins.

Of  course,  coins  arent  usually  stacked  in  cubic  feet

theyre scattered about in piles. A cubic foot of coins fills an

area roughly 5 feet on a side to a depth of about 1/2 inch, or

3  feet  on  a  side  to  a  depth  of  1  inch  or  so.  Thats  enough

pqqqqrs

For this reason, most dragons dont actually have beds com-

posed entirely of coins (though some collect copper pieces for

exactly this reason). Still, its nice to dream. . . .

278

Maybe  some  of  the  items  are  clearly  stolen,  and  the  PCs

seek a reward by returning them to their rightful owners.

GEMS

Table 36: Gems on page 55 of the Dungeon Masters Guide

has  a  long  list  of  gemstones  and  appropriate  values.  The

values given there are for cut and finished stones; uncut or

rough gems are worth about one-third their finished value.

A character with the Craft (gemcutting) skill can improve a

rough gemstones value. The raw material cost is represented

by the uncut stone. The check DC varies from 10 (for gem-

stones worth up to 50 gp) to 15 (for gemstones worth 50 to 500

gp) to 20 or higher (for gemstones worth more than 500 gp).

At the DMs option, a check that fails by 5 or more entirely

ruins  the  uncut  stone,  forcing  the  character  to  start  over

with a new stone.

You  can  make  gems  more  interesting  by  making  them

exotic or restricted. Perhaps the best pearls are retrieved in

a certain bay by gnome divers, or maybe the elves control

the emerald market. Maybe frost giants in your world use

bloodstones for currency, suggesting that if the characters

stumble  across  a  cache  of  bloodstones,  it  probably  came

from (or is headed to) frost giants in the area.

Once youve determined the object type, move to the appro-

priate table (Table A3: Artwork, Table A4: Clothing, Table

A5:  Furnishing,  Table  A6:  Jewelry,  Table  A7:  Musical

Instruments,  Table  A8:  Toys  and  Games,  or  Table  A9:

Utensils)  to  find  out  exactly  what  the  object  is.  In  some

cases,  additional  rolls  on  one  or  more  tables  may  be

required, based on the type of object or the sort of material

it is made from.

Many of the table entries include a parenthetical label,

either H or S, indicating whether the object in question is

made of a hard material or a soft material. To determine the

exact material, roll on Table A10: Material (Hard) or Table

A11: Material (Soft) as appropriate.

For  additional  flourishes,  you  can  roll  on  Table  A12:

Depictions or Table A13: Embellishments.

ITEMS

Adding mundane items or magic items to a hoard is a good

way to spice it up. Dragons with Intelligence scores of 6 or

higher  are likely to use any items (mundane or magic) that

are in their hoards. For instance, a red dragon with a chest

full  of  flasks  of  alchemists  fire  might  put  the  chest  in  a

place where its fiery breath could set the flammable sub-

stance on fire.

MUNDANE ITEMS

Table  38:  Mundane  Items  on  page  56  of  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide has an extensive list of mundane (nonmagi-

cal) items that can be found as part of a treasure hoard. In

addition to these, you can include luxury items such as per-

fume or incense. Roll d% or select from Table A14: Mun-

dane Luxury Items. Since the average value of the items on

this table is only a fraction of the average value of the items

in Table 38 in the Dungeon Masters Guide, roll 2d8 times on

Table A14 for each mundane item indicated by Table 35:

Treasure in the Dungeon Masters Guide.

MAGIC ITEMS

It can be tempting to fill a dragons hoard with an assort-

ment  of  magic  items  usable  by  the  dragon  itself,  such  as

rings,  bracers,  potions,  and  rods.  Unless  the  dragon  has

ready  access  to  a  nearby  city  in  which  to  purchase  such

items, however, it probably shouldnt be equipped as well as

a typical NPC fighter or wizard. And while any intelligent

dragon  (one  with  an  Intelligence  score  of  6  or  higher)

would be foolish to refrain from using a magic item to its

advantage,  unlike  a  typical  NPC  (whose  power  often

depends  on  the  gear  he  carries),  the  challenge  a  dragon

poses  derives  primarily  from  its  innate  abilities,  not  the

treasure it has gathered.

Except  in  special  circumstances,  a  dragon  probably

shouldnt use more than one or two magic items out of its

hoard. Even if you randomly place useful items, most drag-

ons dont have the ability to identify magic items and thus

cant easily determine what might or might not be useful.

In  addition,  dragons  have  difficulty  using  many  magic

items, especially weapons and armor. (See the Rules: Drag-

ons and Magic Items sidebar in Chapter 1.) If you decide to

equip your dragon with a variety of magic items, you might

consider  awarding  an  ad  hoc  XP  bonus  to  the  characters

(anywhere from +10% to +50%, depending on the situation)

for  defeating  it,  since  the  presence  of  useful  magic  items

probably increases the difficulty of the encounter.

Heres a brief rundown of the utility of the various cate-

gories of magic items.

Armor and Shields: Most dragons have no use for such

items unless they can assume a form that can wear them.

Weapons: Again,  unless  the  dragon  can  polymorph  or

otherwise  change  its  form,  most  weapons  are  better  off

stuck in a pile of coins to look nice.

Potions: Dragons appreciate the value of potions. Drag-

ons with a Spellcraft skill modifier of +15 or better can take

10 to identify a potion, and wont let such items go to waste.

Rings: Dragons can wear magic rings without difficulty.

Even if a dragon doesnt know exactly what a ring does, its

likely to wear it for the decorative value alone.

Rods: If  a  dragon  can  determine  a  rods  function,  its

probably also intelligent enough to figure out a way to use

it in an encounter.

Scrolls: As with potions, a dragon with a reasonably high

Spellcraft skill modifier can probably decipher any scrolls

in its hoard. If its capable of using the scroll, its more likely

to use it than to let it decay into dust. A dragons size may

make scroll use tricky, and the DM is free to say that read-

ing a scroll might be at least a full-round action for Huge

and larger dragons, or even to say that such creatures cant

unfurl a scroll at all. Remember that until a dragon can cast

spells, no spells are considered to be on its class list.

Staffs: Like rods, staffs often find use by smart dragons

who figure out their effects and can activate them. Remem-

ber that until a dragon can cast spells, no spells are consid-

ered to be on its class list.

Wands: As staffs, though Huge and larger dragons may

have difficulty manipulating such small items (at the DMs

discretion).

Wondrous Items: Magic items in this category must be

handled on a case-by-case basis. Some, such as amulets, are

easy for dragons to wear and gain the benefits from. Others

either dont fit, arent useful, or simply look better sitting on

top of a pile of coins. Still, a party is likely to remember the

green dragon with a half-dozen ioun stones whirling around

its head!

SAMPLE HOARDS

Provided  below  are  twenty-seven  sample  dragon  hoards:

one each for Challenge Rating 1 through Challenge Rating

27. Each represents approximately triple the expected trea-

sure  value  of  an  encounter  of  that  level,  as  normal  for  a

dragon encounter.

If you use one of these hoards for a creature that doesnt

normally have triple standard treasure, reduce the hoards

value accordingly, as given on the table below. For example,

the CR 8 hoard is appropriate for a CR 12 dragon with stan-

dard  treasure,  and  the  CR  24  hoard  is  used  for  a  CR  28

dragon with double standard treasure.

A total value is given for each treasure hoard in its header

line. This figure assumes full normal value for all objects

(in many cases, items from the hoard can be sold for only

half value by the PCs). Items marked with an asterisk (*)

are  likely  to  be  used  by  dragons  with  an  Intelligence

score of 6 or higher (smart enough to know what they are

and how to utilize them). The gold piece values of indi-

vidual  goods  in  each  hoard  are  given  in  parentheses

(gold  piece  values  for  items  are  given  in  the  Dungeon

Masters Guide).

You can easily swap out items in any hoard as appropriate

for  your  game.  Unless  you  specifically  desire  to  give  out

282

more  or  less  than  the  expected  value  of  treasure  for  the

encounter, any added items should replace items of a simi-

lar value.

For lairs with multiple dragons, use the treasure that cor-

responds to the total Encounter Level of the lair.

The Draconomicon is the ultimate D&D game accessory

about the legendary creatures that are literally the

name of the game. Packed into the pages of this book

are new dragon prestige classes, spells, feats, dragonlike

monsters, and full statistics for 120 sample dragons

all ten of the chromatic and metallic dragons at all 12

age categories. This article presents one of the sample

dragons from The Draconomicon along with her fully

detailed lair. Sventsorggviresh, an old red dragon, is a

suitable opponent for a 20th-level party.

SVENTSORGGVIRESHS

VOLCANO LAIR

Because Sventsorggviresh spends most of her time at

home, player characters are most likely to encounter

her in her lair. They might discover its location from a

metallic dragon or by following Sventsorggviresh there

after one of her hunting excursions.

The lair is located in an area of widespread geother-

mal activity. Numerous geysers, steam vents, and vol-

canic calderas dot the land around her home. Parties

searching for the dragons lair may have to explore sev-

eral small volcanoes before locating the correct one.

LAIR FEATURES

Unless noted otherwise in the text, the features inside

Sventsorggvireshs lair are as follows.

Alarms

Sventsorggviresh has placed alarm effects throughout

the lair to warn her of intruders. Every entrance to and

exit from any chamber (including sinkholes and chim-

neys) is protected by an alarm spell. Any opening too

large to be covered by a single spell has enough addi-

tional alarms to completely cover the area. Each spell

warns Sventsorggviresh with a mental alarm when trig-

gered. All the spells can be bypassed with the same

password (Hey, I belong here! spoken in Ignan).

In addition, each chamber and natural staircase has

a magic mouth spell set to go off whenever anyone other

than Sventsorggviresh or a mephit passes. The magic

mouth says, Where do you think youre going? in

Common.

Ceilings

The ceilings in the chambers are 50 feet high, and

those in the corridors are 25 feet high.

Chamber Openings

Each major chamber in the lair has an opening leading to

the  volcanos  central  crater.  Outside  each  of  these

1

openings is a lip of volcanic stone about 20 feet lower than

the chamber floor that forms a sort of open terrace. These

drop-offs are shown on the map as raised ledges (the

chamber floors) above cliff edges (the terraces). The cham-

ber openings themselves are about 20 feet high, measur-

ing from the top of the opening to the chamber floor.

Floors

The floors are made of natural volcanic rock. Like all

natural floors, they are extremely uneven and feature

many bumps and cracks. Entering any square on the

floor costs two squares of movement, and running or

charging across these floors is impossible.

Light

During the day, sunlight reaches the chambers through

the volcanos crater. Unless otherwise noted, however,

only a little daylight reaches the corridors. Characters

can see normally in the chambers and about 30 feet in

the corridors (or 60 feet if they have low-light vision).

At night, the glow of the lava pool (area 8) lights the

lairs chambers, allowing characters to see about 30 feet

(or 60 feet if they have low-light vision). The corridors

are pitch-black at night.

Temperature

All areas within the lair are hot. The areas farthest

from the lava pool are at least 80 F. Those closer to the

lava pool are hotter still, as given in the various area

descriptions.

Sinkholes/Natural Chimneys

These openings lead to small lava tubes. Unless other-

wise noted, a sinkhole has a funnel-shaped mouth

about 5 feet wide at floor level, which narrows to about

2 feet at the bottom. A chimney is just an inverted sink-

hole located in a ceiling.

Each sinkhole or chimney connects with a tube

about 2 feet wide. Medium or larger creatures cannot

fit through the tubes, but smaller creatures can wiggle

through. The tubes corkscrew throughout the vol-

canos interior, connecting with other sinkholes and

chimneys here and there. Each sinkhole or chimney on

the map bears a label noting where it leads.

The tubes are shot through with vents that periodi-

cally spurt magma or superheated vapor. Visibility

inside a tube is 0 feet because of the thick vapor and the

lack of light. Contact with the hot rock and vapor inside

the tubes deals 2d6 points of heat damage per round.

Vision

Several areas within the lair allow only restricted

vision. Creatures have partial concealment (10% miss

chance) at the indicated distance and total concealment

(50% miss chance and opponents cannot use sight to

locate) beyond that.

Walls

Like the floors, the walls are made of unworked vol-

canic stone. They are not only very uneven, but also

damp with condensation and often covered with fungi.

Because of all these conditions, the walls have a Climb

DC of 20 unless otherwise noted.

SVENTSORGGVIRESHS TACTICS

Sventsorggviresh normally sleeps atop her hoard in

area 6, though you can choose to place her anywhere

you wish within the lair when the PCs arrive. She most

likely knows intruders are within her lair long before

they have any idea where she is, thanks to her keen

senses, her mephit allies, and her magical defenses.

The dragon relishes melee combat, especially with

creatures weaker and smaller than herself. Before set-

ting out to search for prey or confront creatures invad-

ing her lair, she usually casts cats grace on herself. Then

she uses invisibility, followed by haste and protection from

energy (cold). Once so prepared, she moves in for a

closer look.

If possible, she attacks intruders when they reach

area 4, hoping to drive them toward the sinkhole in

area 5. Most of area 4 is protected by a forbiddance spell

that leaves only a single passage leading from the

entrance to area 5 open. A few well-placed walls of force

may help her force the party that direction if they

manage to bypass the forbiddance.

Sventsorggviresh begins her attack by casting true

strike. Then she charges and delivers a bite augmented

with Power Attack. She usually selects an unarmored

opponent in midst of an opposing group for this attack,

so as to have as many foes as possible within reach for

use of the Cleave feat.

Should  the  foes  withstand  her  initial  attack,

Sventsorggviresh defensively casts deeper darkness, then

maneuvers so that she can either deliver her breath

weapon the next round or get as many foes within

melee reach as possible. She tries to eliminate any foes

that seem particularly troublesome with hold monster or

phantasmal killer. The dragon also likes to use confusion

to break up organized groups of foes. If subjected to

cold attacks, she uses fire shield (hot flames) to help

counter them and renews her protection from energy spell

as necessary.

If need be, Sventsorggviresh attacks invaders else-

where in her lair. For such battles, she prefers to use

2

hit-and-run tactics. She typically swoops into a cham-

ber to deliver a breath weapon or spell, them withdraws

toward area 4 before returning for another pass.

The characters can linger here for as long as they wish,

but any visible character at the crater rim brings a

swarm of mephits to investigate.

Even  the  main  chambers  in  her  lair  offer

Sventsorggviresh little room to maneuver while she is

in flight, so she usually flies out over the lava pool (area

8) when she needs to turn. To reverse direction in the

chambers, she either uses her Wingover feat or simply

lands and turns around.

ENTRANCES

Physical entrances to the lair include the top of the vol-

canic crater (area 1), a twisting passage leading to area 2,

and a magma-filled vent under the lava pool (area 8).

1. CRATER RIM (EL 10 OR 20)

This area is shown only in the side view of the lair, as

given on the map. The rim rises about 800 feet above

the surrounding terrain and 325 feet above the lava

pool in area 8. Thanks to the glow from the lava pool,

characters can see the craters interior from here at any

time of the day or night.

A steaming crater gapes wide at the volcanos

summit. The opening is a good bowshot wide and

several hundred feet deep. A lake of orange-white

magma fills the crater bottom, and tendrils of

yellow smoke and white vapor rise from its sur-

face, tainting the air with a whiff of brimstone.

Numerous vents in the crater walls emit similar

fumes. Even here, the heat from the lava is like a

physical presence. It rises in faintly visible waves,

like heat from a hot stove on a winter day.

Six very large openings, each 40 feet wide or

more, are arranged along the interior of the shaft

like steps in spiral staircase. A lip of black, hard-

ened lava lies below each opening.

Creatures: A dozen mephits from areas 3 and 8

come to greet any characters they see here. If you wish

to have the characters encounter Sventsorggviresh

early, she too is close enough to catch sight of the char-

acters when they reach the rim.

SVENTSORGGVIRESHS POWER-UP

If Sventsorggviresh has a chance to use all her

preparatory spells (cats grace, haste, invisibility, and

protection from energy [cold]), her statistics change as

follows: Init +2; Spd 70 ft., fly 230 ft. (clumsy); AC

36, touch 9, flat-footed 33; Atk +37 melee (4d6+12,

bite); Full Atk +37 melee (4d6+12, 2 bites) and +33

melee (2d8+6/19-20/+1d6, 2 claws) and +32 melee

(2d6+6, 2 wings) and +32 melee (2d8+18, tail slap);

SV Ref +19; Dex 14; Hide 10.

In addition, her true strike spell gives her an extra

+20 insight bonus on her first attack roll, and that

attack ignores any miss chances that would nor-

mally apply.

The hot fire shield effect reduces any cold damage

that Sventsorggviresh would take by half, and if the

cold attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, she

takes no damage at all on a successful save. Her pro-

tection from energy spell absorbs any cold damage

remaining after the effects of the fire shield have been

applied (up to a maximum of 120 points). The fire

shield also deals 1d6+7 points of damage to anyone

striking Sventsorggviresh with a natural weapon or a

melee weapon (unless the latter has reach).

Critical (claw), Overwhelming Critical (claw), Power

Attack, Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw), Wingover.

Breath Weapon (Su): Once every 1d4 rounds,

Sventsorggviresh can breathe a 60-foot cone of fire.

Each creature in the area takes 16d10 points of fire

damage (Reflex DC 31 half).

Crush (Ex): Whenever Sventsorggviresh flies or

jumps, she can land on opponents as a standard action,

using her whole body to crush them. Her crush attack

affects Medium or smaller opponents within a 20-foot-

by-20-foot area. Each potentially affected creature must

succeed on a DC 31 Reflex save or be pinned, automati-

cally taking 4d6+18 points of bludgeoning damage

during the next round unless the dragon moves off. If

Sventsorggviresh chooses to maintain the pin, treat it

as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take

damage from the crush each round if they dont escape.

(Ex): Whenever

Sventsorggviresh attacks, charges, or flies overhead,

each creature in a 240-foot radius that has 27 or fewer

HD must make a DC 29 Will save. Failure indicates

that the creature is panicked for 4d6 rounds (if it has 4

or fewer HD) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if it has 5 or

more HD).

Frightful  Presence

Spell-Like  Abilities: 8/daylocate  object;

3/daysuggestion (DC 18). Caster level 11th.

Spells: Sventsorggviresh casts spells as an 11th-

Tail Sweep (Ex): Sventsorggviresh can sweep

with her tail as a standard action. The sweep affects

Small or smaller creatures in a half-circle with a radius

of 30 feet extending from an intersection on the edge

of the dragons space in any direction. Each potentially

affected creature in the area takes 2d6+18 points of

damage (Reflex DC 31 half).

Keen Senses (Ex): Sventsorggviresh can see four

times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and

twice as well in normal light. She also has darkvision to

a range of 120 feet.

Equipment: 2 gloves of storing, necklace of adapta-

tion, ring of swimming, wand of chaos hammer (caster level

8th, 28 charges), wand of fire shield (22 charges).

Tactics: Sventsorggviresh, if present, tries to

ambush the PCs by becoming invisible and then using

her breath weapon, as noted in the section above on

her general tactics. After her initial attack, she flies to

area 4 and lies in wait for the PCs.

The  mephits  make  a  casual  approach  from  the

depths of the crater, doing nothing to conceal them-

selves from the party. They simply ride the heat waves

rising from the lava pool, turning in lazy circles. When

they reach the crater rim, they invite the characters to

dive right in, assuring them that the lava is fine. The

mephits do not intend to fight the characters; they

leave that to Sventsorggviresh.

If Sventsorggviresh is present, the mephits arrive at

the top after she has started her assault. They simply

take up positions along the rim and watch the fight.

If the dragon is not there, the mephits are happy to

chat with the party. If questioned, they confirm that

this mountain is the home of a red dragon. They tell

the characters that the dragon can be found in one of

the chambers, and even offer to lead the party there. If

asked for directions, the mephits point out the cave

opening to area 4. Should the characters indicate a pref-

erence for walking, the mephits scoff but the direct the

party to the passage leading into area 2.

The mephits willingly describe the whole lair if asked,

though they claim theres not much to tell. The lair, they

say, has six hot, steamy chambers, including the secret

room where the dragon dwells. In response to questions

about where this secret chamber lies, they give directions

to area 5. (In fact, area 5 is not a chamber at all; its just a

passage with a big sinkhole in the floor. Sventsorggviresh

actually spends most of her time in area 6.)

The mephits claim to hate the dragon because she is

both haughty and domineering. (Both of these adjec-

tives describe Sventsorggviresh well, but the mephits

expect as much and dont really mind.) They claim that

the dragon has disguised the entrance to her inner

sanctum as a simple hole in the ground. (This state-

ment isnt true; the mephits know that the sinkhole in

area  5  is  Sventsorggvireshs  disposal  chute  for

unwanted visitors.) The mephits also warn the party

that powerful magic guards the dragons lair, but they

offer  a  secret  password  (Sventsorggviresh  tri-

umphant) that they claim allows safe passage. These

assertions are true, as far as they go. Area 4 is warded by

a forbiddance spell that is keyed to that phrase (though it

must be spoken in Ignana fact that the mephits con-

veniently leave out). Sventsorggvireshs lair in area 6 is

also protected by forbiddance, but that ward has a differ-

ent password (see area 6).

5

Once the party leaves the rim and enters the lair, the

mephits quickly go to area 6 to warn Sventsorggviresh.

(After all, it never hurts to be on a dragons good side,

even if the dragon in question doesnt really have one.)

Unless  the  party  seems  particularly  unwary,  the

mephits first go to area 2, then travel to areas 7 and 6

through the connecting sinkholes. If the characters

detain the mephits, other mephits from areas 2 and 3

notice their comrades plight and give the warning

instead.

2. UPPER CAVERN (EL VARIABLE)

Groups traveling on foot can reach this area through a

twisting passage that leads here from the volcanos

western slopes.

This chamber lies 300 feet above the lava pool. The

temperature is about 100 F.

This dingy cavern reeks of spoiled food, spilled

alcohol,  and  burnt  herbs.  An  untidy  heap  of

crates, barrels, and other containers stands near

one wall. Several winged creatures lounge on the

pile, eating and drinking.

Three gaping holes yawn in the uneven floor,

and the wide cave mouth admits a lurid, vol-

canic glow.

The mephits refer to this cavern as the Icehouse,

since it seems cold to them. The items stacked here

constitute the mephits treasure hoard.

These creatures accompany the dragon when she

sacks any structure that might contain items of value,

and it is they who go inside the burning buildings and

collect the treasure. Sventsorggviresh seizes anything

of real value that the mephits may find, but she allows

them to keep most of the food, drink, clothing, and

other sundries. She insists, however, that they store

their loot here.

Creatures: Two to four mephits (some combina-

tion of fire, steam, and magma types) are always here

eating, drinking, loafing, and (coincidentally) keeping

watch over the entrance to the lair.

D Fire Mephit: hp 13; see the mephit entry in

the Monster Manual.

D Magma Mephit: hp 14; see the mephit entry

in the Monster Manual.

D Steam Mephit: hp 12; see the mephit entry in

the Monster Manual.

Tactics: These mephits use the same tactics as

their comrades in area 1, though theyre mildly inebri-

ated and thus somewhat difficult to understand. If

attacked, they make a halfhearted attempt to defend

their supplies, using their spell-like abilities and breath

weapons while they try to stay out of melee reach. If

one mephit is killed, the survivors quickly exit through

the chambers three sinkholes.

3. MEPHIT COLONY (EL 10)

All  the  three-dozen-odd  mephits  who  dwell  in

Sventsorggvireshs  lair  call  this  chamber  home,

though there are seldom more than a dozen here at

any one time.

The crevasse in this chamber is only an inch or two

wide, but it constantly belches steam and sulfurous

vapors. Vision in this chamber is restricted to 20 feet,

and the temperature is 120 F (hot enough to damage

characters after 10 minutes of exposure, as noted in the

Dungeon Masters Guide).

The  floor  of  this  chamber  is  dotted  with  low

mounds of volcanic sand that the mephits have gath-

ered from the neighboring areas. These sandpiles serve

as mephit bedding.

Creatures: A swarm of twelve fire, steam, and

magma mephits is always here sleeping, playing knuck-

lebones, or diving off the terrace outside into the lava

pool some 250 feet below.

D Fire Mephits (4): hp 15, 13, 12, 12; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

D Magma Mephits (4): hp 16, 15, 13, 12; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

D Steam Mephits (4): hp 15, 14, 13, 13; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

Tactics: These mephits use the same tactics as

their comrades in area 1. If they are threatened, some of

them flee down the natural staircase to area 4, while

others use the chimneys and sinkholes to escape.

4. CAVERN OF THE WYRM (EL 20 OR 0)

This area is protected by a forbiddance effect and con-

tains a programmed image of an attacking dragon. In

addition, Sventsorggviresh is lying in wait here for the

characters if she has been warned of their approach.

The temperature in this chamber is 150 F (hot

enough to damage characters after 1 minute of expo-

sure, as noted in the Dungeon Masters Guide).

The forbiddance effect  covers  the  entire  cavern

except for a passage extending north and south from

the westernmost column (the square in the northern

portion of the cavern) the entire vertical length of the

cavern. It also covers the entire terrace. The dragon

wants to channel visitors toward area 5, so she has left

the straightest path to that area open.

6

The forbiddance ward does not deal damage, but only

creatures that speak the password Sventsorggviresh

triumphant in Ignan can enter the warded area. The

effect also prevents all teleportation and planar travel

into or out of that area. The forbiddance effect was created

by a 13th-level lawful evil cleric.

anyone

Whenever

a  mephit  or

Sventsorggviresh enters area 4, a programmed image

goes into action, creating the following illusion.

except

A cloud of sulfurous steam billows from the head

of the natural staircase leading north. The head of

an immense red dragon appears within the cloud

and mutters a few arcane syllables, then both the

dragon and the cloud withdraw down the stairs to

the north.

The head appears to be that of  a Colossal  dragon,

though Sventsorggviresh is only Gargantuan. Any

character may make a Spellcraft check to determine

that the arcane syllables were the verbal component of

a wall of force spell.

Creature: As  noted  in  the  section  above  on

Sventsorggvireshs tactics, the dragon prefers to defend

her lair here.

D Sventsorggviresh: See area 1.

Tactics: If Sventsorggviresh can catch the party in

this chamber, she flies in from the crater and tries to

drive her foes toward area 5, using walls of force to

restrict their movements as needed. In addition, she

may use bull rush maneuvers to force opponents down

the stairs.

5. GROTTO OF FIRE (EL 20 OR 0)

The natural staircase from area 4 leads down 50 feet to

this area. The chamber is protected by the same forbid-

dance effect that wards area 4.

This grotto is noticeably hotter than area 4 (180 F).

The air stinks of sulfur and rotting flesh. This smell

emanates from the 20-foot sinkhole at the end of the cor-

ridor. A shaft about 16 feet across drops nearly straight

down to the lava pool in area 8, approximately 150 feet

below. The shafts sides are smooth and well greased

from the scores of carcasses that Sventsorggviresh has

used to smear the walls over the years.

The Climb DC is 30 for the walls in the shaft and

the sinkhole, but this DC is reduced by 10 for a Colos-

sal or Gargantuan climber. Any creature that falls into

the pit takes 15d6 points of falling damage, plus 20d6

points of fire damage per round for immersion in the

molten lava, plus an additional 10d6 points of fire

damage each round for 1d3 rounds after leaving the

pool. A Colossal or Gargantuan climber can use the

shaft to slow the fall and take only 10d6 points of

falling damage.

Creature: If Sventsorggviresh has attacked the

characters in the outer chamber (area 4), she tried to

finish the battle here.

D Sventsorggviresh: See area 1.

Tactics: If Sventsorggviresh can trap the party

here, she uses bull rush to force the characters, one by

one, into the sinkhole, starting with one who seems to

be the worst climber. If she succeeds in eliminating

half the group, she offers to spare the survivors in

return  for  all  their  treasure  and  equipment.  She

demands  that  anyone  who  agrees  to  these  terms

remove all his armor and equipment. Once everyone

has had a chance to disarm, she renews her attack.

Sventsorggviresh does not intend to allow anyone who

has seen the inside of her lair to escape.

6. SVENTSORGGVIRESHS CHAMBER

(EL 20 OR 0)

The temperature in this chamber exceeds 200 F (hot

enough to damage characters after 1 minute of expo-

sure, as noted in the Dungeon Masters Guide).

The crevasse in this chamber is similar to the one in

area 3, except that it puts out even thicker vapor. Vision

in this area is restricted to 15 feet.

is

Clear  off!  spoken

A forbiddance effect similar to the one protecting area

4 covers this entire chamber, including the terrace. The

password

in  Ignan.

Sventsorggviresh has not shared this password with

the mephits, but she shouts it at any of them who are

lingering nearby whenever she enters the cave. Several

of the mephits have figured out what the password is,

but none have tried to use it so far. When coming here

to warn Sventsorggviresh of intruders, the mephits

stop when they encounter the ward and simply shout

out their information.

Creature: Sventsorggviresh spends most of her

time in northwest spur of this cave, resting atop what

seems to be a mound of gems and coins at least 30 feet

in diameter and 10 feet high. In fact, it is a pile of vol-

canic sand with Sventsorggvireshs hoard layered over

it. If she has not already encountered the party else-

where, she is here.

D Sventsorggviresh: See area 1.

Tactics: If forced to fight here, Sventsorggviresh

retreats to her treasure pile and tries to hedge herself

with walls of force, so that her foes must approach her

along a narrow front.

7

If she decides to leave this chamber in order to

expel intruders, she digs one of the mirage arcana

scrolls out of her hoard and uses it to make the whole

chamber look like a pool of seething lava.

Treasure: Sventsorggvireshs hoard contains the

following: 21,760 gp, 2,320 pp, 1 alexandrite (500 gp), 2

aquamarines (300 gp each), 1 fire opal (1,000 gp), 2

pieces of jade (400 gp each), 3 peridots (50 gp each), 3

red garnets (100 gp each), 2 rubies (400 gp each), 4

pieces of smoky quartz (25 gp each), 1 star ruby (1,000

gp), 2 topazes (500 gp each), 6 gold altar plates (200 gp

each), 1 gold and silver chalice with amethysts (2,500

gp), 8 jade scroll cases (500 gp each), 1 jeweled gold

casket, 1 platinum and black jade ring (3,500 gp), 2

scrolls of mirage arcana (caster level 12th), scroll of pro-

grammed image (caster level 12th), +4 spell resistance 13

full plate armor, and a +3 heavy pick.

The coins and gems lie atop the mound. The other

items are buried in the sand, and a Search check (DC

25) is needed to recover them all. The three scrolls are

in separate jade scroll cases, which are included in the

list of items in the hoard. All the metal items in the

hoard are searing hot, and each deals 2d4 points of fire

damage if touched.

7. OLD LAIR

The temperature in this chamber is greater than 250 F

(hot enough to damage characters after 1 minute of expo-

sure, as noted in the Dungeon Masters Guide). The crevasse

here is similar to the one in area 3, and the steam and vol-

canic gases it emits restrict vision to 20 feet.

The bones of the dragon that Sventsorggviresh

defeated when she claimed this lair lie arranged in ani-

mated skeleton fashion atop a big mound of volcanic

sand. Despite their lifelike arrangement, however, they

are just bones.

Sventsorggviresh has laid a clutch of four eggs in

the sand under the skeleton.

8. LAVA POOL (EL 10)

This pool of molten lava is several hundred feet deep.

Lava tubes lead from here to many geysers and smaller

volcanoes  in  the  vicinity.  Sventsorggviresh  has

plumbed  the  depths  of  the  pool  using  her  ring  of

swimming and necklace of adaptation, and she has discov-

ered several tubes large enough to admit her. If faced

with certain defeat within the lair, she dives into the

pool and escapes though one of these tubes.

Creatures: A gang of ten fire, steam, and magma

mephits are always here playing in the pool or in the air

above it.

D Fire Mephits (4): hp 15, 13, 12, 12; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

D Magma Mephits (3): hp 15, 13, 12; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

D Steam Mephits (3): hp 14, 13, 13; see the

mephit entry in the Monster Manual.

Tactics: The mephits use the same tactics as their

comrades in area 1. If threatened, most flee toward area

4, but a few head for area 7.

ALTERING THE

ADVENTURE

Sventsorggviresh is a formidable opponent all by her-

self. To make this adventure even more dangerous,

however, you can give her a mate. She is most likely to

choose a younger male. Sventsorggvireshs mate might

share her chamber, but he is more likely to dwell in

area 4 or area 5. In such a case, Sventsorggviresh wont

bother with the programmed image in area 4, and woe to

the party caught between the two dragons.

Sventsorggvireshs volcano, with its multiple cham-

bers, also makes an ideal lair for a clutch of younger red

dragons. Such a group of young dragons has probably

driven off the resident mephits, or at least thinned

their numbers considerably.

TIBULLIAX,

HALF-COPPER DRAGON/

HALF-ANDROSPHINX

Copper dragons and androsphinxes share the same ter-

rain options and alignment. Thus, it comes as no sur-

prise that an androsphinx tired of dealing with trouble-

some gynosphinxes might turn to an adult copper

dragon for companionship instead, resulting in off-

spring such as Tibulliax.

Tibulliax lives in warm, hilly terrain, enjoying a life

of comfort. Perhaps ironically, he seeks a gynosphinx as

a mate because he appreciates riddles more than his

father ever did.

Pounce ((Ex): When Tibulliax charges a foe, he can

follow with a full attack, including two rake attacks.

Rake ((Ex): If Tibulliax pounces on an opponent, he

can make two rake attacks with his hind legs (+22

melee, damage 2d4+5).

Roar ((Su): Three times per day, Tibulliax can loose a

mighty roar. The first time he does so, each creature

within 500 feet must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or

be affected as though by a fear spell for 12 rounds.

If Tibulliax roars a second time during the same

encounter, every creature within 250 feet must succeed

on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4

rounds, and all those within 90 feet are deafened for

2d6 rounds (no save).

If Tibulliax  roars  a  third  time  during  the  same

encounter, every creature within 250 feet must succeed

on  a  DC  20  Fortitude  save  or  take  2d4  points  of

Strength damage for 2d4 rounds. In addition, any

Medium or smaller creature within 90 feet must suc-

ceed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or be thrown to the

ground and take 2d8 points of damage. The force of this

roar is so great that it deals 50 points of damage to any

stone or crystalline object within 90 feet. A magic item

or a held or carried item can avoid damage with a suc-

cessful DC 20 Reflex save.

Androsphinxes are immune to Tibulliaxs roar.

ARTURIREX,

HALF-BLACK DRAGON/

HALF-BASILISK

Also known as a dracolisk, Arturirex is an abhorrent

creature spawned of magical crossbreeding. Though

she is more cunning and vicious than a normal basilisk,

she is hardly the equal of her draconic parent. The dra-

colisk cares nothing for treasure of any kind, since she

doesnt possess any of the greed common to dragons.

Arturirex that meets her gaze turns to stone perma-

nently (Fortitude DC 14 negates).

AZURIA,

HALF-SILVER DRAGON/

HALF-DJINNI

Despite their differing alignments, djinn and silver

dragons share a heritage of elemental air. In fact, some

sages have argued that genies and dragons may be dis-

tantly linked in some way, pointing to the elemental

nature of each creature as evidence.

Whatever of the reason, it is not uncommon for a

djinni and a silver dragon to find purpose and meaning

in a common goal. Occasionally such a relationship

results in children who, while undoubtedly genies,

nevertheless display their draconic heritage.

Azuria is such a creature, born of the union of

dragon and djinni. She served in the court of Bahamut

for a short while, but left when she began to find the

surroundings too confining for her taste. Since then,

she has wandered the planes, searching for a place

where she feels comfortable and accepted. Though

friendly with both her parents races, she nevertheless

knows that she doesnt really belong with either.

Air MMastery ((Ex): An airborne creature takes a 1

penalty on attack and damage rolls against Azuria.

Breath WWeapon ((Su): Once per day, Azuria can

breathe a 30-foot cone of cold. Each creature in the area

takes 6d8 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 16 half ).

Spell-Like AAbilities: At willinvisibility(self only);

1/daycreate food and water, create wine (as create

water, but wine instead), gaseous form (1 hour), major

creation (created vegetable matter is permanent), per-

sistent image (DC 19), wind walk. Caster level 20th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Whirlwind ((Su): Azuria can transform herself into a

whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that

form for up to 7 rounds. In this form, she can move

through the air or along a surface at her fly speed. The

whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base up to 30 feet wide

at the top, and up to 50 feet tall (at least 10 feet).

Azurias movement while in whirlwind form does

not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if she enters

another creatures space. Another creature might be

caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters it, or if

Azuria moves into or through the creatures space. Any

Medium or smaller creature might take damage when

caught in the whirlwind and be lifted into the air.

An affected creature must succeed on a DC 24

Reflex save upon coming into contact with the whirl-

wind or take 3d6 points of damage. It must also suc-

ceed on a DC 24 Reflex save or be picked up bodily

and held suspended in the powerful winds, automati-

cally taking 1d8 points of damage each round. A crea-

ture with a fly speed is allowed a DC 24 Reflex save

each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still

takes damage but can leave if the save is successful.

The save DC is Strength-based and includes a +3 racial

adjustment.

A creature trapped in the whirlwind cannot move

except to go where Azuria carries it or to escape the

whirlwind. It can otherwise act normally but must

make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to

cast a spell. A creature caught in the whirlwind takes a

4 penalty to Dexterity and a 2 penalty on attack rolls.

Azuria can have only as many creatures trapped

inside a whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the

whirlwinds volume. She can eject any carried creatures

whenever she wishes, depositing them wherever the

whirlwind happens to be.

If the whirlwinds base touches the ground, it cre-

ates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered

on Azuria and has a diameter equal to half the whirl-

winds height. The cloud obscures all vision, includ-

ing darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away

have concealment, while those farther away have

total concealment. Anyone caught in the cloud must

succeed on a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell

level) to cast a spell. While in whirlwind form, Azuria

cannot make melee attacks and does not threaten the

area around her.

Plane SShift(Sp): Azuria can enter any of the elemen-

tal planes, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. This

ability transports her and up to eight other creatures,

provided they all link hands with her. This effect is

otherwise similar to the spell of the same name (caster

level 13th).

Telepathy ((Su): Azuria can communicate telepath-

ically with any creature within 100 feet that has a

language.

Sample TTreasure: Bloodstone (50 gp), two silver

pearls (100 gp each), one star sapphire (1,000 gp),

potion of blur.

GUSTINIAN,

HALF-BRONZE DRAGON/

HALF-STORM GIANT

Though storm giants and bronze dragons differ in their

approach to battling evil, they respect one another

greatly. Every few generations, a bronze dragon takes

giant form and serves as a royal consort to the giant

ruler, cementing the traditional alliance between these

two ancient races. This practice has resulted in a fair

number  of  half-bronze  dragon/half-storm  giants,

including Gustinian.

Once a prince of the storm giants that lived in a

sunken realm, Gustinian left home in his youth to

wander the world. When he returned years later, noth-

ing remained of his palatial home except a few heir-

looms. He now searches everywhere for clues about the

fate of his people.

ASPHIXILORIC,

HALF-GREEN DRAGON/

HALF FIVE-HEADED HYDRA

As if the deadly power of the hydra wasnt frightening

enough, the mad wyrm Asphixias spent several years

fathering half-green dragon/half-hydras across the con-

tinent. Now his spawn, including Asphixiloric, terror-

ize  vast  areas.  Thanks  to  his  acid  immunity  and

increased intelligence, Asphixiloric is particularly diffi-

cult to defeat.

VILYAKIS,

HALF-WHITE DRAGON/

HALF-MEDUSA

Because the savage, bestial white dragons often find

unusual mates, half-white dragons may be the most

common half-dragons in existence. Nevertheless, each

is unique in its own way.

No one truly knows the origin of Vilyakis, and she

prefers it that way. She lairs in a labyrinthine cavern

high in the icy peaks, luxuriating in her vast pile of

treasure. If she becomes aware of intruders in her lair,

she either stalks them through the tunnels or pretends

to be a comely maiden long enough to expose them to

her petrifying gaze.

AURUMPENTE,

HALF-GOLD DRAGON/

HALF-GUARDIAN NAGA

Nagas and dragons share many attributes, including

high intelligence, magical aptitude, and an apprecia-

tion of solitude. Thus, alliances between them are rela-

tively common, and some of these pairings give rise to

half-breed offspring, such as Aurumpente.

Sometimes mistaken for a couatl or even a legless

dragon, the winged Aurumpente lives a secluded exis-

tence deep in the trackless jungle. From time to time,

he emerges from his cave to thwart the plans of evil

creatures in the area or to assist good-aligned creatures

in need.

cerer. He has access to spells from the cleric list and

from the Good and Law domains.

KELOTRIK,

HALF-RED DRAGON/

HALF-NOBLE SALAMANDER

Though red dragons and salamanders rarely share terri-

tory, they can make excellent allies. Sometimes a pow-

erful red dragon keeps a cluster of salamanders as body-

guards, knowing that it can breathe fire without risking

the lives of its protectors. Likewise, mighty noble sala-

manders sometimes raise red dragons as steeds or

cohorts.

One such alliance led to the birth of Kelotrik, the

son of a noble salamander and a red dragon. Immedi-

ately upon reaching adulthood, Kelotrik set out to seek

his fortune and prove his worth to his father, the lord of

a great stronghold on the Elemental Plane of Fire.

Kelotrik plans to amass a small army of evil minions

with which to carve out his own kingdom and, if neces-

sary, claim his birthright by force.

SCYTHIA,

HALF-BRASS DRAGON/

HALF-WYVERN

While half-dragon/half-wyverns arent terribly uncom-

mon, most derive their draconic heritage from evil

dragons, often white or black. Scythia is a raritya

half-dragon/half-wyvern born of a metallic dragon

parent. Scythia never knew her wyvern father, and her

mother told her nothing about him. Scythia often sus-

pects that her hatching was a surprise to her mother

and wonders why her egg wasnt crushed in the nest.

Today, bereft of both parents, Scythia wanders alone

in the wilderness, seeking her own place in the world.

Though a bit slow-witted, she realizes that she doesnt

fit in with her fathers kind or with any of the metallic

dragons.

KALIVIA,

HALF-BLUE DRAGON/

HALF-YUAN-TI  ABOMINATION

A small faction among the yuan-ti seeks to increase the

races power by strengthening bloodlines. One forward-

thinking abomination in this group bargained with a

blue dragon to bear his young, believing that the off-

spring would become natural leaders who could take

the serpent folk to even greater heights of power.

He  was  partially  correct.  Soon  after  the  eggs

hatched, the half-dragon spawn displayed even greater

physical and mental abilities than their father had.

However, they also had a disturbing tendency to slay

one another. Only one of the children, Kalivia by name,

survived to reach the age of six. By maturity, she had

murdered her father and set up an organized inter-

breeding program between yuan-ti and dragonkind.

Though the program is yet in its infancy, Kalivia plans

to create an army of dragonspawn to wipe the conti-

nent clean of humanoid infestation.

Aversion (Sp): Kalivia can psionically create a com-

pulsion effect targeting one creature within 30 feet.

The target must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or gain

an aversion to snakes for 10 minutes. Affected creatures

must stay at least 20 feet away from any snake or yuan-

ti, alive or dead; if already within 20 feet, they move

away. A subject unable to move away, or one attacked by

snakes or yuan-ti, is overcome with revulsion. This

revulsion reduces the creatures Dexterity score by 4

points until the effect wears off or the subject is no

longer within 20 feet of a snake or yuan-ti. This ability

is otherwise similar to antipathy as the spell (caster

level 16th).

Breath WWeapon ((Su): Once per day, Kalivia can

breathe a 60-foot line of lightning. Each creature in the

area takes 6d8 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC

19 half ).

Constrict  ((Ex): Kalivia  deals  1d6+12  points  of

damage with a successful grapple check.

Improved GGrab ((Ex): To use this ability, Kalivia must

hit a Large or smaller creature with her bite attack. She

can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action with-

out provoking an attack of opportunity. If she wins the

grapple check, she establishes a hold and can constrict.

Poison ((Ex): Kalivia delivers her poison (Fortitude DC

18) with each successful bite attack. The initial damage is

1d6 Con, and the secondary damage is the same.

Produce AAcid (Sp): Kalivia has the psionic ability to

exude acid from her body, dealing 3d6 points of acid

damage to the next creature she touches, including a

creature hit by her bite attack. If she is grappling, con-

stricting, or pinning a foe when she uses this power,

her grasp deals 5d6 points of acid damage. The acid

becomes inert when it leaves her body, and she is

immune to its effects.

polymorph(DC 20, into snake form only), fear(DC 19).

Caster level 10th.

Alternate FForm (Sp): Kalivia can assume the form of

a Tiny to Large viper as a psionic ability. This ability is

similar to a polymorph spell (caster level 19th), but

Kalivia does not regain any hit points for changing form

and she can assume only viper forms. Kalivia loses her

natural weapons and gains the natural weapon of the

viper form she assumes. She uses her own poison or the

vipers with her bite attack, whichever is more potent.

Chameleon PPower (Sp): Kalivia can psionically

change her own coloration and that of her equipment

to match her surroundings, granting her a +10 circum-

stance bonus on Hide checks.

Detect PPoison (Sp): Kalivia has the psionic ability to

use detect poison as the spell (caster level 6th).
